Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were, in fact, the players in our blind item back in the spring.
Sherlock kissed him, and stayed close.
I’m not alone anymore. I don’t know if you would worry for it, but in case,
“Early,” Sherlock told him. “Seven forty-something.”
“Iain disagrees with you about that section of my speech you said you liked. He wants to cut it. And about half of the next section, as well. Apparently my youth is less interesting than I thought.”
“Are we not?” Sherlock replied, putting a little gilt of argument on it.
“We really should have thought to dovetail our roadtrips,” Sherlock mused, not wanting to trade his post-orgasmic melting sensation for a stress-induced tightening quite so soon, but the schedule of the upcoming weeks insisted upon causing consternation. “You’ve three nights on the west coast?”
“The beard suits you,” Sherlock commented; Steven wore a several-day stubble flecked with silver. “You didn’t have one when we met before.”
“Then yes.”
Sherlock only moved closer to him and said softly, “No,” and put a hand on John’s arm, there above his elbow to let him know Sherlock was near. It was a surprise to Sherlock when John collapsed forward into him, and how he clutched at Sherlock’s clothes, and shuddered a sound so mournful Sherlock felt it in his own guts. He held John hard and close. “You have her, and you always will,” he murmured, close by John’s ear.
Once they had cleaned up and dressed, with business-like distance and no conversation, Steven sat on the bed’s edge to put on his shoes while Sherlock buttoned his shirt cuffs.
Sherlock snorted a laugh at the mental image of Mycroft Holmes in his Savile Row, double breasted three-piece, standing beside a bench full of spitting, cursing, fully-uniformed hockey players. He wouldn’t know whether to retreat from the imminent threat of bullying, or come in his likely-also-monogrammed silk boxers.
John texted back a wink. From anyone else, Sherlock would have thought it ridiculous, but he knew John fell back on such things as a way to communicate sentiments he would not want to have read over his shoulder in a conference room or a hired car full of colleagues. Knowing John was in the foundation’s office, Sherlock chose to accept it as intended, resisted the temptation to send John something scandalous just to poke him in the ribs.
John pretended to think it over, frowning, checking the clock. He tilted his head toward the landing to listen for any fuss from Rosie, downstairs in Mrs Hudson’s flat. At last he slapped his palms against the arms of his chair and pushed himself upward. “Yeah, why not?”
Sherlock lowered himself into his mother’s twee, too-narrow armchair and pilfered the last of Mycroft’s biscuits.
In no time John’s knees were beside his head, and Sherlock’s chin tilted up and back, sliding his body down the bed to find the angle, while John gripped the (
To Mrs Hudson he said, “There’s a note in her rucksack for him. Just.
she prompted.
John widened his eyes at Sherlock’s display of dirty sundries. “Are we expecting guests?” he joked.
John imagined some men in his position might exhale relief at a few nights of quiet and time to themselves. Without Rosie there to cook a meal for, he fried an egg and ate it on toast, then left his plate in the sink, unwashed. He kept the telly on just for the noise. He made a pass around the room chucking toys into their crates and baskets, standing books spine-out on the little bookshelf. The only glimmer of goodness he felt in her absence was when he dropped himself into the bed—a proper bed  tucked into an alcove that may once have been a cupboard, the only bed in the flat—instead of onto his usual bunk-post on the sofa just barely long enough for him to stretch across. Falling asleep was difficult; but the sleep when it came was thicker and more enduring.
Sherlock’s instinct was to point out that other really quite good thing they had between them—just then tucked into bed in the room above—but held it back in favour of a shrug. “You could just say no thank you.” Sherlock was unsure whether he felt rejected—or embarrassed?—but in any case he put a mild joke in his tone, to blunt the edge of the scold.
Fix it.
The inquiring intonation at the end of her sentences was new; Sherlock was running analysis on the media she consumed regularly, hoping to pin it more on mimicry of pre-teen actresses on television than on some crisis of confidence in a girl who had no reason to think she was less than the Platonic ideal of a child. Her schoolmates were always a graph-wrecking variable; there were so many of them, two dozen control groups of one, and they morphed unapologetically—almost daily—into entirely new data sets. The gingers were particularly problematic.
John typed to his therapist.
that!” she snapped. John moved to do the washing up not only because it needed doing, but because the running water might drown out some of the whinging. “Don’t say I’m a treat and is it bedtime!” she shouted after him.
“Shall I tell you what I’ve been thinking about, as regards our handsome young associate over there?”
OK, so there's that. I've always felt guilty for not mentioning it!
“Oi, now,” Lestrade scolded him. “All I’m saying is this is not something to get your tits in a twist about.”
“Only two,” he insisted.
Rosie dropped dramatically across the red chair in the sitting room, starfish-shaped with the toes of her new, white sandals just brushing the rug.
“I know.”
“If not that, he’s got some highly specific erotic fixation involving unnecessary corrective procedures. Either way: interesting.”
“Maybe it’s for me,” Sherlock asserted. “For adopting you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
As he passed the first of three open-gated entrances to the park, Sherlock eased his pace. John had pointed out a shortcut through the park; the team’s hotel was directly opposite, a beeline along a mostly-straight central walkway flanked by flowerbeds. At the time, Sherlock’s obtuse response had been that the park was a “bad neighbourhood” and he’d suggested they take the roundabout way, adding distance to the run. What John might have made of the comment, if anything, Sherlock couldn’t know; months had passed before Sherlock told John he was an addict, and John seemed relatively naïve to the ways and workings of scoring on the streets rather than through more elevated channels—prescriptions, pharmacies,
Sherlock pursed his lips, biting a smile.
It was Sherlock’s turn to grin, making a quick, urgent inventory of his coach’s reaction to being handed a mental image of what did and did not, in fact, lie beneath Sherlock’s tracksuit bottoms. It took actual effort on Sherlock’s part to stifle a sigh of disappointment that Coach remained oblivious to his obvious charms.
John laughed. “Sometimes I wish I could. Did you know going from six hours a day of full-on exertion to an hour at the gym or a five-mile run doesn’t balance the billion calories I’m used to eating every day?”
John fixed them lunch from what he could find on-hand, which wasn’t much because their landlady Mrs Hudson had recently spent two nights in the hospital getting treated for pneumonia. They’d sent flowers and as John dictated what Sherlock should put on the card, the two half-joked that they should probably not rely so heavily on her habit of stocking their kitchen during Brawlers road trips. Sherlock suggested John arrange grocery deliveries; John fired back that he did, actually, work all week even when Sherlock was not there to see it. Apologies and forgiveness were quickly exchanged, but the issue of who would fill the fridge was left unresolved.
“Right, Madeline. Madeline, Madeline,” John repeated to himself, under his breath. “I’ll remember next time.”
By the time John sat back in his chair to stretch, and looked up at the clock on the kitchen wall (due to Sherlock’s influence, Rosie was the only child in her class who could tell time on an analog clock, and who understood the meaning of “quarter to” and “eight minutes past”), it was already well after eleven.
John made a disgusted noise. “Yeah. No. I’m sure it will feel weird when you go to camp and I don’t. But it was the right time for me to quit.” He sounded as if he were convincing himself. “I promised myself. And Kim.”
“That’s a first,” Sherlock said, only John in earshot. A bit louder he answered, “Still engaged with the first menial task you issued, Mother.”
“You’re a real treat today, darling. Is it bedtime yet?” John was sure his own eyes were as glassy as hers; he’d worked three shifts in two days while she’d been with Sherlock.
Sherlock didn’t know where to begin to explain how much in error Steven’s assumptions were. Then he wondered if it was even necessary to correct him. The silence grew, and Steven broke it rather than wait for a response from Sherlock.
“I think half-six.”
“What’s funny?” he asked, as John let go another low-volume
“Well, the trees are the focal point. This table will be cleared of. . .” he waved his hands in the air over what looked like more than a single year’s worth of paperwork and other clutter. “All of this. It will be the h’ors deouvres table. Drinks on this cart.” He rolled a wooden cart, which John had not previously noticed due to its being overflowing with books and laundry, partway across the room. “Try to keep them out of the kitchen but it never works.”
Mrs Holmes threw a dismayed expression John’s way. To his credit, he only smiled at her apologetically. Accepting it was futile to argue, Sherlock’s mother only rapped two knuckles on the shut door of his father’s little study, and called through it, “Sherlock and John will soon be going; come out and say goodbye.”
John flipped pages. Mycroft at various small sizes, with two fingers in his mouth more often than not. Soon appeared another infant, wearing hats and rolled in layers of blankets—born in autumn.
Mags: I’ll keep at it. Mike, what are you doing for lunch?
Mags: Love that. Do you live together?
“And get busted down to Bridgeport and told to sort my shit out in my spare time?”
“Back to bed?”
“True,” Sherlock agreed. He reached into his coat pockets, quickly drew his hands out again. Looking for cigarettes, then remembering himself. “It’s only that I enjoy watching her. I find her interesting.”
“Christ, Sherlock! He’s joking.” John was embarrassed but not actually angry. Even still, Sherlock thought it best not to press further lest he tip John over the edge, and so took his rhetoric down a few notches to the generally accepted conversational level.
“Of course. It was a fjords cruise and a Viking heritage festival, but they’re the same in spirit.”
Sherlock looked at him blankly. “Road work? Or, have they redirected the flights over us again?” he offered.
Mike: I’ll think about it. But first my boyfriend’s taking me home to meet his family. Can we ask some less serious questions to wrap up?
Sherlock nodded, feeling stunned. Coach Lestrade had clearly finished with him, was drawing LoPresti into a bear hug and thumping his back. There was nothing for it but to get his head in the game, so Sherlock turned back around and went to find a wall to look at while he emptied his mind for a few minutes.
then sneered, “Fuck. That.”
Sherlock laughed a groan, rolled and raised himself to sit, toes brushing the carpet.
“Thank you,” was all Sherlock could think to reply.
It was frost. Some magical meeting of moisture rising from the sink, and cold air seeping in around the not-recently-maintained silicone seals of the window’s corners. He could just make out feathery, snowflake-like crystal formations dusting the tiny leaves. He gently pinched one between forefinger and thumb, and the ice melted away instantly, almost--it seemed--without him really having to touch it. It was that fine. From a distance it had seemed a troubling coating of ice, but up close it was beautiful. Melting it was easier than he’d imagined it would be.
“No—I know.” John nodded his own emphasis. “I’ve never worried over it.”
Lost as he was in his reverie—counting out seventeen shades of colour in a scrap of creamy stationery, and three in the flow of sepia ink, the curve of a long-looping “y” handwritten by an unhappy middle-aged wife in 1898—Sherlock started at a sudden series of thunderous thuds against the downstairs door, jumping so that he knocked a slim pair of tweezers from the seven o’clock spot to well west of nine. The bell went, and then more pounding—the side of a fist, the weight and shape and timbre of the blows all familiar to him. His stomach soured and he lurched to his feet, heart pounding, wanting to flee, running toward the landing.
Sherlock hummed. His late brother in his teens was tall and slender, with a sturdy neck and dark hair that waved across his forehead even though he kept it short in an effort to tame it. This far into the photographic record there were fewer and fewer pictures of him, almost none of Mycroft. Finnish landscapes, bunches of strangers who must have been students and friends of Sherlock’s mother. Sherlock, small and serious, forced to pose beside Christmas trees and fence-gates. Medium-sized in his hockey gear, crouched in front of his net. Lanky and beginning to at last resemble himself in his late teens, sprawled on an orange-flowered sofa with a book in one hand.
“You know the children are likely better off. Or will be, in the end.”
“I don’t mind,” Sherlock said agreeably, and soon enough his long black coat filled the narrow doorway of the kitchen. John fetched the mugs and poured; Sherlock went into the fridge for milk, which he sniffed, and an apple, which he bit nearly in half with one go.
“Mm, good,” John hummed, and arched his back, groaning into the stretch.
“Wake up,” Sherlock said loudly, and found the light switch on the wall, then marched to the side of George’s bed. There was a woman beside him; she looked mildly worried, but quickly vanished beneath the edge of the duvet.
More. Not merely more sex, though of course that would always be a welcome endeavour, but more of a bond, more empathy, more reminders of their better natures. Sherlock wanted more of
“My sister and her boyfriend rented a house; we’re staying with them,” John added, trying to smooth things, bless him. Sherlock would be sure to thoroughly, gratefully bless him later. On his knees. Perhaps in the shower.
“Why did I even invite you?”
“Usually a family tree is a record of who married who, who was whose parent or brother or sister,” John dodged in favour of focusing on the letter of Rosie’s assignment rather than its spirit. “They can get quite big—imagine two parents having four or six children, who all have partners and children—all the cousins and aunts and uncles may not really know each other in a big gang like that, but they’re still technically family.”
, gave off a distinct whiff of desperation, as if Lestrade’s personal happiness—not just his professional pride—hung on Sherlock getting his shit together to keep the team on the right side of the win/loss record.
“You should be ashamed.”
“No shrine to the baby son? No shelves full of junior league trophies?” John was insistent; Sherlock tried to distract him with a few well-placed pinches along the inseam of his jeans. John leaned away. “A quick look.”
“Thanks for getting her from school,” he said. “Unusual to get held up like that.”
“Remember that night in the hospital, with the flu?” Sherlock asked.
“Use your tablet.”
Sherlock reclaimed their not-quite-dry glasses from the dish rack and stood them on the worktop, opened a second bottle of the wine, which was the correct one after all, so clearly not as good as he’d remembered. He made a mental note never to buy it again.
“And it was the first time that I was treated like a stranger instead of her parent. The school’s been very understanding, for instance. But when they took her into that room and made me stay outside, and call you. . .” Sherlock shook his head. “I guess I hadn’t had to think about those things before. The legalities. Because I held her while her age was still counted in hours. And ever since.”
“Fuck fuck fuck fuck. . .”
“Sorry,” came the reply, with an apologetic half-smile. “I’m not working next weekend; Thursday to Monday.”
“Can it be both?” John mused. Sherlock shrugged.
“Asking what to write in the stories?”
“Colin. I know yours. It’s unusual. Hard to forget.” He smiled with very white, very straight teeth, then took Sherlock’s hand and guided himself around in a sort of spin, laughing to let Sherlock know he was being cute and funny. When he came back around, he pressed closer, one hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, the other resting very low on his back. “Check my pocket,” Colin told him, and indicated with a downturned gaze the breast pocket of his shirt.
Steven had again requested permission to penetrate him, and again Sherlock had declined, though he didn’t hate the idea. Instead Steven lay on the bed with one hand behind his head like a reclining emperor, while Sherlock curled up beside his thigh and sucked his average-in-every-way prick. Steven’s free hand held Sherlock too tight by the ankle, then shoulder, and at last clenched hard around his wrist. Sherlock received no praise, nor even any real reciprocity. Once Steven had come on Sherlock’s chin and cheek, he watched with little interest as Sherlock jerked himself, then offered a disconcerting smirk in the wake of Sherlock’s orgasm that made him feel self-conscious.
“Heard from Coach about your start?” John asked.  In sixteen hours, the Brawlers were opening a five-game west coast road trip with a game against the Condors.
“Gladly.” He cranked up the taps a bit and left them to it. Within three minutes, Rosie was giggling, sounding a bit crazed, but John would take sleep-deprived and giddy over sleep-deprived and beastly, anytime.
Sherlock sat. John’s shoulders were soft, and he wore a light, closed-lipped smile. He was doctoring.
“Not really. Though,” Sherlock tilted his head. “I do have something you might be able to help me with. Sure to be mentally challenging. Possibly dangerous.”
“You’re breathing; you’re alive.
“Not much, darling; we’ll do the shopping on our way home.”
John descended the stairs into the sitting room, and Sherlock heard him sigh—a particular one that indicated exasperation—then listened to a long silence broken only by the house’s usual night-time noises of settling pipes and the occasional traffic passing down on the street. Eventually, some movement, not quite pacing, more likely John making up the sofa. Sherlock turned on his side, putting his back to the bedroom door, and mentally berated himself for being so unguarded. Handing John another excuse to grouse about his poor decision-making, to avoid ever spending time in Sherlock’s company.
“Right.”
Sherlock demurred. “Not in your job description,” he said, and John got the message.
“It’s what I would do, in your situation,” Sherlock shrugged.
“Friends stay friends even when they have a fight. Not like a hitting fight, or kicking, but if they say, like,
“It really doesn’t matter either way,” Sherlock said, but it seemed far less than vital to deliver a lecture on ethical non-monogamy to a serial adulterer and virtual stranger so early in the morning, so he did not elaborate on precisely why George’s discretion didn’t matter.
“Will
“She was weepy off and on all night,” John confirmed. “At the appetizers-and-speeches thing before the game, too.”
“I see them.”
LoPresti laughed. “No one told you? You don’t know why I’m late?”
John nodded again, looking grim. “Yeah.”
“You make a keen point about the inefficiency of idioms. However, what that means is: a very bad person, who is crafty and dangerous inside, can sometimes look on the outside as if they are gentle and non-threatening. Like a wolf wearing a sheep disguise.”
“Take your coat?” John offered.
**trope alert!**trope alert!** "I accidentally got yr package" **trope alert!**trope alert!**
“Thanks for letting me intrude on your time,” John offered, letting go a light grunt of pain as his knees straightened.
Just as it became impossible to keep his breath quiet, and the pace of his stroking picked up, blankets kicked aside, wrenching his neck in a way that was nothing like his fantasy—no force to struggle against, only minimally uncomfortable—John shifted his limbs at the other side of the bed, hummed and rolled and moved closer to Sherlock’s side. Sherlock was close, couldn’t be bothered.
,” Sherlock told him, his voice confessionally low. After a half-beat, he added, “It was an experiment.”
“No. Nothing.”
Sherlock imagined he should have been a bit more focused on his level of indulgence in food and wine during his summer vacation—he’d got workouts in, did some running and swimming, but he dreaded to anticipate the number on the scale, his first day at training camp. It would be the same mini-disaster for them all, he knew, but Sherlock feared he might pass his own, arbitrarily-set upper limit, and that would mean extra time in the gym, less cake and more kale. His next draft of wine was deeper and he spared no time to savour, a rebellion against the demands of his career. He would be a hockey player in August; June and July were for being a real person. At least as close as Sherlock ever got.
Clearly sensing Sherlock’s gravity, John let his teasing smile recede.
“Will I pour us a drink?” Sherlock offered, and the relief at a minor diversion from the discussion—and a shift of focus away from John’s weeping—showed in the set of John’s shoulders.
Play continued, so Sherlock had no choice but to check in and guard the house. Off to his left, Ryan tried repeatedly to stand—only to collapse onto the ice again and again—grunting and growling all the while. The Brawlers got the puck momentarily, the Demons turned it over, and lobbed one at him, but it went wide.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Sherlock argued. “Have you checked?”
John was taken by surprise. “My dad?” He frowned. “A bit. Yeah. Actually I’ve been thinking about my mum, with yours pottering around, making us tea and wiping the worktops every few minutes.”
“Hey,” John said, and smiled though he felt grim about it. “Thanks for the card.”
Sherlock reassured him, “Already forgotten.”
Sherlock pinched the stem of his glass and lifted to sip at a sparkling wine from—of all places—Canada, found it toasty and creamy but still fresh and appetite-stimulating. He hummed.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows questioningly.
“It’s been nearly four months,” he replied, not really an answer. After a moment’s expectant silence from Molly, who carried on staring, now adding the torment of an expression of sympathetic concern, Sherlock added, “Open school day coming up. She’s made a tri-fold paperboard display on the life cycle of a daisy.”
JW: So, look. In the end, I think the important bit of all this, setting aside the shock-horror of coming out the way I did—we did as a couple—is that hopefully, having seen or heard about it, others will feel safer about living a truthful life even in a situation that could feel hostile. It was no risk to me—I’ve made my living, and no one’s going to intimidate or harass me in my place of work. Maybe for someone feeling that coming out is dangerous or even impossible because of the environment they’re in, they’ll look at us coming out together, as pro players of a tough game, in a national league, and feel like they can come out wherever they happen to be.
Sherlock cast a glance toward the bench, fully expecting to see coach Lestrade motioning for him to skate in and let LoPresti take over. Though Coach was grimacing, he stood still, with rolled-up papers in one hand, his arms crossed in front of his chest. Sherlock sprayed  a stream of water onto his face, a reminder to focus up, and slid his hand back into his catching glove.
John would not be so easily dissuaded from building Sherlock up, and ranted his scorn for the coach’s choices, the team’s play, and the strange schedule the league had set up for the Brawlers during October and November, not a single week with the usual Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday routine in place. All to accommodate—what?—the television schedule? Ridiculous; no wonder you guys are off your game, with two weekend matinees and an eight o’clock start on Wednesday all in the same week?
John sucked a gasp, then sighed it out shakily. “I was half-mad by the time he finally started sucking my cock. So close so fast.”
“Practice this morning?”
“Something?”
“I’m retired,” John reminded him with a grin. “I’m on holiday until I die.”
John gave a small smile, and acquiesced. “Yes, Mr Holmes.”
The relief of fresh, frigid air outside the building was shocking; John hadn’t realised how stifling the flat had been. Sherlock jotted notes in a tiny notebook he tucked back inside his coat while John stood by, keeping his back to the building until he couldn’t resist a backward glance.
Sherlock looked at the ground ahead of him as they walked, could feel John’s gaze on him. “It was just too easy,” he said. “And some in-built masculine need for territorial pissings reared its head, I suppose.”
“Oh, all right.”
“We’ve met once, I think,” the headmistress said, and reached to shake their hands before taking her seat. “You know Mrs Green, our head teacher. This is Joanna Shute, she’s the school social worker we share with Hawley and Hatton primary schools. And Miriam Rosenberg, school psychologist.”
But he had wanted that before—they both had—John, too—and look where it had taken them. John Watson was dedicated to hard work, went at it with gusto and a sense of duty, did not accept defeat easily—almost not at all. John was loyal; not blindly so, but when respect was earned, he willingly gave it and stood sturdily in defense of its object. If a man like that—if John Watson himself—had born even the slightest sense that

“Yeah? God, you’re gorgeous when you stroke yourself off.”
“You need Dadda’s glasses,” Rosie piped up, and Sherlock instinctively drew the paper closer to himself.
Not sure whether he was relieved or disappointed, John nodded, and rolled the fingers of his left hand against a rising itch in his palm. “Anything I can do to help?” he offered.
They aren’t engaged or anything. (Mike is mentally planning their wedding attire, despite this, just to be ready in case their relationship status updates)
LoPresti would get the next four starts, full stop, no chance of Sherlock stepping back in as lead goaltender during any of those games. During his early-morning meeting with the coach, he was once again instructed to check in with Whitehouse for some conditioning, Raynham for goalie-coaching, and Lestrade made a valiant attempt at building him up rather than berating him. Sherlock felt certain he would have been more comfortable taking heat; something about his coach’s reassurances and expressions of confidence made him uneasy. Lestrade’s reminders that Sherlock was one of the reasons he’d taken the job as Brawlers’ head coach, and that
“Will you? Is CRUZR glitching?”
“Pleasure to meet you, Mr Holmes.”
The bandstand came in view with surprising suddenness; it was nearer the main pathway than Sherlock remembered. Gathered in a sheltering clump to its distant side were a half-dozen people, mostly men, none young, all in a uniform of sorts: old jeans, hoods of their sweatshirts pulled up to half-hide their faces, burning cigarettes in nearly every hand. Sherlock sped up despite the twinge in his shin which was now a true groan—a deep bruise from friendly fire during practice—and fixed his gaze. He could make another left, take himself only slightly out of his way, over a knoll and then back around. He could, but then again.
“Oh?”
John barely moved his lips, but Sherlock knew them intimately and so easily read them as he mouthed,
“So this is for you,” Sherlock said, and held up the ring between thumb and forefinger, “to remind you that I’ve got your back. I’m your man, for as long as it suits you.”
“All right. I’m intrigued,” John said.
“Popular music; not really my area.”
“For you, too,” Colin offered generously, inviting Sherlock to a good time. “Help yourself.”
John swam up beside Sherlock, taut shoulders glistening with water droplets, bright eyes squinting against the brilliant sunlight. “It’s warm as a bath,” he marveled, standing bent-kneed, his arms gently figure-eighting through the saltwater. His smile was also brilliant, in every sense, and Sherlock leaned in to kiss it.
“Oh, Sherlock. You’re so seldom home,” Mrs Holmes protested. Immune to her whinges, Sherlock stood firm.
The barbecue was delicious, cheap and greasy and sweet-hot so Sherlock’s lips tingled. The film he chose was one he’d seen before, a documentary about an artist he was still not sure whether he admired or derided, and his opinion was no firmer for having viewed it again. He moved barefoot around the hotel bedroom, dressed in his warm-ups, clearing up the refuse of his lunch. He sucked soda through a straw to the very bottom of the paper bucket in which it was served, then followed up the hollow rattle of the final sip with a belch so rotund and sonorous he laughed at himself. Within an hour he’d be on the bus to the rink, and was pleasantly surprised to note his own confidence level, which was very near its usual lofty altitude. He wasn’t sure the Brawlers could win, but he was certain at least he’d get his job done. Perhaps as a treat to himself, he’d arrange a CRUZR date during the second intermission, so he’d have something—someone—to look forward to.
Jordan rested a hand on each of their shoulders and leaned in between them. Dropping a quick cheek-kiss on each of them, he smiled. “I don’t think so, but thanks for asking.”
learn?”
“Thanks, Mrs H.” So many moods, in such a short span. Sherlock should do a study of voice tones. How would he? “Mind your granny; bed no later than half-nine, you’ve still school tomorrow.” Sherlock scribbled out the idea of the study. John said, “Love you, Rose, down to your toes,” and Sherlock half-smiled. He loved her just the same.
“Keep looking up,” Sherlock told him. He could see a small clot of eco-tourists in hiking shoes and trousers with ridiculous numbers of pockets rounding the bend behind them. “The last time you scored on me was in Hamilton, three years ago.”
“I love the way you touch me,
He was already putting it on by the time he caught himself. “But,” he started, keeping at the zip despite his conditioned refusal reflex. “Where are we going?”
Sherlock wanted to trust it—John watching on television from the opposite coast—but John was hardly objective. Sherlock thought his hands might be shaking so he put his phone away without finishing their exchange, and yanked up the front of his sweater to pointlessly unfasten and refasten the plastic buckles of his chest protector.
“You owe me.”
At one end of the long bar was a group of about a dozen, some clearly still dressed in at least partial uniforms at the end of workday, others more purposefully attired. The party took up a few bar stools as well as three pushed-together tables in a corner. Sherlock ordered two whiskys—doubles—and John kept close to his back talking upward, loudly, to make himself heard over the cacophony of 1970s dance music and the scream-chatter of partygoers.
Stepping into his jeans, Sherlock burned so bright with a desire to agree, strip off, let himself be used and used again until he was all used up, the heat of it made him hurry to leave. He’d felt off-kilter and stupid since the moment Steven had opened the door; now things felt dangerous, and not only because he’d been spoken to scornfully and held by the throat.
“But it’s a loud and clear reminder that
John pointed at it. “That was the wrong thing to do.” His words were threat and accusation at once. Stepping a half-pace closer, John stared hard into Sherlock’s eyes and gritted out, “You won’t take her from me. Not even with your brother’s sneaky government lawyers, pushing papers through the courts without me having a say.” He quoted, “
“Good night, dear.”
“Thought Sherlock Holmes was dead.”
**trope alert!!**trope alert!!** Fake Dating **trope alert!!**trope alert!!*
“Love you,” Rosie told him, and squeezed him hard around the neck. Once they were through, John lay a hand at the back of her shoulder and brushed her toward the stairs.
“No, it’s all right. Thanks, though.”
“Not at all; it’s an apt metaphor. Sounds like Rosie’s just working through some thoughts about Mary.”
Back in their seats, Rosie went into her bag of artificial-fruit-scented slow-flowing-liquid sweets and fastened her eyes on the screen. Sherlock leaned his chin in his hand, elbow on his seat’s arm rest.
“She never stops tidying,” Sherlock affirmed. “She’ll die sweeping in some already-clean corner. Your mum was like that?”
Sherlock spooled out the story of the case as they ate, and it was fascinating and horrible, and John was rapt. Though nothing personally encouraging was said, he felt more confident about his proposed role in Sherlock’s subterfuge by the time he’d finished the tale. It would be fine. It might even be fun.
“Have a seat, won’t you?” Sherlock offered, his brusque, bored tone at odds with the proper etiquette.
Sherlock had a packet of slick beside him on the mattress already, and so tore its corner with his teeth as he kicked down the covers.
He needed to play. He needed his start. He needed his routine, from the first words off his lips upon waking—
“Uh—another, ah, time. . .”
Sherlock nodded. John was right, and Sherlock agreed with everything he’d said. An insurmountable impasse, irreconcilable differences of perception. They were not getting back together.
“Fuck.
Of course, John himself was no fan of kiddy parties either, but after the first half-dozen or so, it became their default position that he escorted Rosie to all of them. Sherlock never volunteered, and on the few occasions when Rosie asked that he take her, John had let him off easy, making his excuses for him so Rosie didn’t feel rejected. And so it had always been John who stood around small-talking with people—mostly mums, at that—whose names he rarely cared to remember, critiquing the classroom teachers and cluing each other in on the least crowded rainy-day playspaces, reminding the children to keep their hands to themselves, exhorting them to eat something decent before pouring sugar over it, practically begging them to please, darling, I know you’re excited but you must stop screaming. It was John who always came home with his head aching, and who inevitably dealt with the high-pitched, tremulous sugar surge followed by the inevitable tantrumming crash.
John Watson, he’s called. He grew the roses; he’s the gardener. It’s strange I know, it was strange to me--more that he seemed to like me than the other. I knew that about myself. Likely you did, too. Remember how fragile I was, as a boy.
They’d constantly threatened to divorce each other, jokily, with affection—such a stupid threat it could only be funny—and eventually Rosie had gotten in on the act as well, threatening to divorce them if they cooked fish for dinner, or when they tried to have a lazy Sunday lie-in and Rosie was already up and dressed—even my shoes, look!—and ready to
“Hardly fair,” Sherlock said, with sympathy evident in his tone. He lay his palm over the back of John’s hand, still resting there on his thigh, hidden by the tablecloth.
“Special case.”
“That sounds like fun. But you don’t play that game.”
**trope alert!**trope alert!**
Sherlock only gave Mycroft a narrow-eyed glare, unsure of his intention. Mycroft waved him off. “Notable because we’ve never been much privy to that part of your life.”
SH: I was going to say an air of. . .dude. Ly. Ness.
John reopened his laptop. “You need my, what, groove? Vibe.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, still smiling. “Oh?”
“I actually have no idea, but now that it’s out there, I guess I’d better find something.” He laughed a bit, and reached for his phone, began typing with his thumb, narrating carefully, “Fun. Unforgettable. Things to do. . .near me.”
“Shut!
“Fuck.
“Years ago, it was part of my pre-game routine. Just two or three minutes to quiet my head. Get centered.”
Ten minutes later, in the shower, he vomited at his feet.
John twisted his lips between his teeth. “I’m sure he does,” he nodded at her. “We’ll talk about it later. In, in, your teacher’s waiting for you.” He pulled open the door and waved her through, following behind to help her change her shoes.
“You should see the team doctor.”
spelled in pink neon above the entrance doors. John paused to survey the room, but Sherlock followed his instinct and made a beeline through a crush of drunken, dancing bodies to the bar along the back wall. John trailed him, and caught Sherlock’s hand; Sherlock dragged him along by two clasped fingers.
“Have I got cousins?”
There was a long pause where neither of them spoke, then, not knowing why, John said, “It used to feel frightening. Then it made me angry. Now it’s just sad.”
John was nodding, doing that thing with his mouth. “Yeah.”
“Mycroft.”
“Optional skate. I’m exercising my option.” He ran his palm down John’s torso, then up, across his chest, over his belly.
Despite Sherlock’s willingness to have John sit on his face the whole night if it pleased him—and given the grunts, sighs, and curses streaming from John’s mouth, it seemed to—soon enough John rearranged them so he was kneeling between Sherlock’s wide-spread thighs, running hands up the lengths of them, massaging Sherlock’s quadriceps muscles through the rough silk of his trousers. At last he took Sherlock’s prick in his mouth, not deep but sucking hard, licking wet spirals around Sherlock’s crown, nodding and humming and—
“Don’t know about that,” John smirked, and pulled a face. “You can slap my arse as I walk away, if you like.”
“I thought you’d be taller,” his mother commented, as Sherlock slid her coat up her arms and onto her shoulders. “But otherwise, you’re almost exactly as I imagined.” She turned to Sherlock and beamed at him. “You’ve done well for yourself, Sherlock.” Back to John: “You take the best care of him, or you’ll have me to answer to.” There was an edge to the playful warning that made John feel he--if he had actually been dating Sherlock--really should tread carefully lest he get on the bad side of Mother Holmes.
“It helps,” John told him. “You’re neither the first nor the last; you’ll survive it.”
“Three more, then?” John offered, and Sherlock could see by the particular frown he wore that he was thinking Rosie would have to put Mary’s name on the page just to fill in the gaps and satisfy her marking rubric.
“Shall I open that wine we brought back?” John asked halfway through the meal, while the television showed a tour of a mega-yacht anchored near Dubai’s Palm Islands.
“God, you were brilliant tonight,” John told him. Sherlock was as comforted by the sight of the bedroom wallpaper in the background as he was by seeing John’s face smiling back at him from his phone’s screen. “How did it feel?”
“Fuck off.” John was smiling. Sherlock had an odd, burning sensation low in the center of his chest.
“Not that interesting.”
He texted John despite knowing he wouldn’t see it for at least a few hours, aiming for a declaration of desire but landing on something more sentimental. He hadn’t anticipated feeling soppy, though of course it was no small thing he’d done, declaring himself so firmly attached he had no wish to be let go. A ring John would wear to remind him. As adamant as Sherlock felt that he was not holding John too hard, not trying to domesticate him or change anything about all the ways in which they worked so beautifully together, he could not deny even to himself that something momentous had occurred. A mild hope flickered in the back of his mind that John might even reciprocate with a declaration of his own. But even if not, he’d smiled and agreed to wear the ring Sherlock had chosen for him, sealed it all with a kiss on the back of Sherlock’s hand followed shortly by mutual orgasms in the bath.
“Let’s just
“Researchers, yeah. I’m sort of the opening act for their two days of presenting papers to each other, talking about brain and spine injuries.” John shrugged. “Iain will be there; he wants to hear the speech aloud, now we think it’s finally finished.”
“Not that,” Sherlock corrected. He wanted to ask John whether he’d slept with his poet/editor/greatest fan, but bit down on it for no reason he could have explained. “I’ll apologise when we have that drink.”
Sherlock found a purpose. He made moves to duck out and shout at someone to get Rosie’s line started so they could top her up and take her home.
he texted.
“I’ll see what I can find out and get back to you,” John told her, and a glance at the television showed him a text-crawl about explosions in storage and repair facilities for city buses. “I’ll ring you back,” he said distractedly. As he disconnected the call, his phone lit up with a text.
John smiled to himself, and the anxious sensations seeped out from under his skin back to wherever they lurked when not in use.
“You did,” Sherlock said quickly. “I don’t like to think about it.”
Three hours later, they trudged up the stairs they’d thundered down earlier, the still silence of a whole house asleep at distinct odds with the jangling bustle of the city they’d recently slogged through. There was freezing rain, and a cutting wind off the river, and Sherlock was certain as he bent to untie them that his oxfords were beyond saving. John’s boots had weighed him down and slowed them, but his socks were dry. His cheeks were pink and he smiled in a particular way Sherlock had nearly forgotten he had.
“Just like Mike and Mags said,” Sherlock agreed. “He’s underappreciated.”
Sherlock sat in his usual place at the head of the table, pipe close at hand, coat left behind in his room (though his waistcoat was buttoned and the chain of his pocket watch rose and fell with his breath), in an uncharacteristically slouchy posture. To John’s surprise and delight, Sherlock did not resist the festive air of the day--of the room, of the people he usually did his level best to rein in and tame--rather, he indulged it with apparent relish. The paper crown never left its perch, slightly askew to the left, atop his head. He peeled an orange by hand and dropped the skin in a pile beside his plate, ate each segment with quiet exclamations of pleasure and sweetness. Licked the juice from his fingertips.
“Sherlock Holmes,” the man said, and at last turned his focus on John. Bright blue-eyed focus that made him feel he was being evaluated from the ends of his fringe to the polish on his wingtip brogues. Sherlock offered his hand and John stepped forward to shake it.
“If you bend over I’ll have no choice but to ravish you.”
“Oh, are we doing jealousy now?” John asked, not arguing, more amused.
Sherlock’s eyes closed and his shoulders sank forward on a silent sigh. He wondered if George was really so oblivious to the fact Sherlock thought him a cad, and whether he worried the resident weirdy might speak a bit too plainly to the woman he endlessly cheated on. For no reason Sherlock could define, he put on a t-shirt, and then a small, closed-lipped grin, and went out into the sitting room to greet poor Mrs George.
“Yes, that’s Enoch,” he confirmed, and took over as page-turner. “The really important bits come later.” He sped through his brothers’ lives without him, but stopped now and then and tapped his finger. “Their first semi-detached house, in Moorehead Street.” “My father loved that Fiat more than any of his sons.” “My grandmother Holmes. She was French, and terribly elegant. The best one of us by far; I adored her.”
Upon his return, he found John had thrown back the blankets and was lazily stroking his upright prick in his left fist. “Give a bloke a hand?” he asked, with a slight smile in Sherlock’s direction.
“I’ve been posing as a woman, online, these past two weeks. American.”
“True, I like him. But this is not just the worst Christmas song of all time, it may be the worst song, generally.”
Sherlock pulled off, panting, a spider’s silk of spit from his lip to the crown of John’s cock. He cheated his knees a bit wider beside John’s chest, rolled his tongue to break the connection. As soon as they’d shed their clothes, John had fallen back on the bed and drawn Sherlock down—with firm hands on hips and thighs—to sit on John’s greedy mouth. Sherlock followed silent cues to grind his spread-open arse against John’s face until his prick was slick with dripping pre-cum smoothed along by his own hand. Long minutes were passed in that exalted formation, watching John’s cock grow harder and darker, thick-veined and twitching as John groaned against him and speared into Sherlock with his strong tongue. At last Sherlock could no longer resist delivering some fraction of the pleasure he was receiving, and arched forward, resettling them both so that they were both breath-held, open-throated, sucking and swallowing with mouths running wet.
“Didn’t need to know that.”
“When did it start?”
As was their custom, the two tucked into their meal with all haste, and Sherlock managed the exertion required to work the remote, settling on a programme featuring over-the-top luxury vacation spots, from ice hotels draped with fur rugs and blankets, to gilded Parisian apartments with butler and staff included. Side by side with their knees touching, they leaned over food in plastic trays, the chopsticks cheap and splintery.
“I’d had such an eighties-movie vision of it, too,” John said with a stagey, regretful shake of his head.
“Well, you ordered it,” John reminded, cheekily defensive.
“One of the benefits of being just the boyfriend, not the teammate. Now when I boss you about, it’s only for fun.”
“Dirty your white shirt, ripping it open to get to you.”
John did a web-search to confirm what he thought he knew, and decided he likely would not. But who knew? He’d try anything once.
“Quite a high fever. Complaining of pain in her arms and legs. Lethargic and I think she may have been hallucinating.”
“Thanks for coming to this.”
Sherlock had called in a favour from a computer whiz, arranged a place for her to work outside the police station she refused to step foot inside. John crouched beside Sherlock, by the body, and shared his impressions of a wound in the entirely wrong place for a suicide, the handgun beside his leg looking so clean it might never have been fired. He was dressed smartly from the waist up; his lower half, though, wore ragged tracksuit bottoms and vinyl slippers.
Sherlock could read Iain from his newsboy-capped head to his frayed messenger bag to his low-end-of-upscale shoes. He was making a scant living, had at least two cats and at least two housemates, wrote longhand in an expensive notebook. He was single and queer and had a massive crush on Sherlock’s boyfriend. Not that Sherlock blamed him; John was manly, seductive, sex on legs. He himself had developed a similarly massive crush on John roughly four minutes after first speaking to him. So it was eminently understandable.
Back out on the ice getting ready for the second--just before starting his usual choreography of stick, neck, crouch, and settle--Sherlock spent a moment in his crease with one knee on the ice. John would know what it meant.
“Oi.”
John took his time finishing what Sherlock had begun—so slow to finish undressing him that Sherlock regretted his column of maddening buttons rather than a quick and dirty zip—employing a slow reveal that had Sherlock humming frustrated impatience through bitten lips. John liked him partly-dressed—or mostly dressed—but they’d been long days and nights apart and Sherlock was ready to get on with it. Just when he was about to voice a grumbling protest and strip both of them with all necessary force, John peeled open his front placket and took Sherlock’s rapidly thickening prick deep in his mouth, his tongue curl-sliding, not entirely careful with the edges of his teeth. Sherlock sucked a loud hiss of breath and grabbed hard at John’s shoulder.
“Yes, it fucking matters,” John said, too loud. Looked around himself at no one and lowered his voice. “When Rosie’s come down with what is—I don’t know if you’ve heard—a pretty damn dangerous flu, it matters how it developed. What was her temperature when you checked it?”
“He feels the work would be an embarrassment, given that it pre-dates the music for which he has since become known, and he feels it is far inferior. He prefers to recover the manuscripts quickly and quietly, so as to avoid public awareness.”
century papers. The slides had taken nine days to prepare; he wrote his notes longhand and was mildly shocked at how far his handwriting had deteriorated. He thought he remembered it used to be elegant in its precision, square and upright, but now it was slanted, unpredictably sized. Too much typing. Too much texting. Even notices of having gone out for milk were no longer scrawled on envelope-backs, but rather tapped and swiped onto screens with bare fingerpads. Not a week before, he’d noticed an inability to straighten the thumb of his left hand, and since cybernetic enhancements to his own, troublesome body still seemed far over the horizon, decided it might at last be time to riot against technology—get a rotary telephone, write a letter, drape a bedsheet over the television screen. But then what of his lovely new microscope, with its electronic focusing and LED light and vision-protecting tinted lens?
“You don’t expect it to go well? I’m sure you’d both be fine. For Rosie.”
“Worth it,” John told him. “I’ll call you tomorrow. Sleep well,
Sherlock stood by the wide window, between the drapes open just wider than his body. The view was dismal: a service alley for the hotel restaurant, a highway on-ramp, and beyond it tattered houses too close together and too close to liquour shops.
John made no secret he was up the same tree.
“Yes. Good night.”
“Well,” John said, and his tone was not at all what Sherlock had expected. “We do tell her that if she works hard, she can grow up to be anything she wants to be.” He shrugged, and raised his eyebrows, restraining a smirk, clearly recruiting Sherlock to his side. “And surely you know about this one.” He jerked his thumb toward Sherlock. “Shocking things sort of go with the territory.”
Sherlock hummed agreement. “You’re sure you have to go tonight?”
Thank you for joining me this season; these have been a lot of fun to write and I have enjoyed reading all yr comments! Merry Christmas to all of you, and best wishes for a new year that brings you everything you wish for.
) sleek but sturdy headboard, and leaned his arse into Sherlock’s waiting hands, spreading him open so Sherlock could lick and suck and hum against his hole, up and down as much of the slit of John’s lovely, muscley bum as he could get to. Sherlock jostled and pulled with gripping palms and fingers, and John rocked and wriggled, and everything was wet and dark and dirty and delicious. Sherlock’s cock twitched and jumped with need for stimulation; he thrust against nothing, hips rolling in time with the motion of his tongue.
John’s hand slid possessively along the inside of Sherlock’s thigh, beneath the table, and he licked his lips, and Sherlock felt satisfactorily ego-stroked. Once he’d passed over his card to the server he grasped John’s hand, there in his lap, slotting together their fingers, pressing his thumb against the surface of John’s ring as if he could line up the whorls of his fingerprint with their impression in its surface. John squeezed.
"Healthy Scratch": an uninjured player on the roster who does not dress for a game. This is sometimes used as a way to penalize players who misbehave off-ice (such as when then-rookie Tyler Seguin missed a Boston Bruins team breakfast and found himself watching that night's game from the skybox). Given the number of injured players on most teams' rosters, it's pretty rare that there are any men to spare, so a healthy scratch is noteworthy. (The players still gets paid, though, so. . .)
John rang off and dug the heels of his hands into his eye sockets, rubbing away fresh tears. “She had to say that!” he exclaimed, and sobbed a laugh at his sister’s nerve. “Had to say that about my folks.”
Small, familiar fingertips settled against Sherlock’s temples, and he did not know where to look, so stared for a moment at the second button on John’s shirt before he let his eyes shut. Thumb pads nestled gently against his inner brow bones and Sherlock knew to let his head drop forward against them, the pressure reminding him to relax the muscles around his eyes and to smooth the tension in his forehead. John’s fingertips moved in light circles over his temples. He could hear the strands at his hairline moving.
“Well,” John shrugged, his mouth quirking up at the corners. “Not right to sleep.” He gave a pointed look at Sherlock’s lower midsection. “Thought I might tire my jaw first.”
“Eee! Nothing. Go. Go, tell it.”
“You couldn’t help it.” John patted her knee. “We were stuck in and bored, as well.”
Sherlock had fallen asleep, and John studied his lightly parted lips and the dark lace of his lashes, the smooth, the soft curl of his fingers. Flicking his gaze from Sherlock’s soft face and his notebook of rough-textured paper, John sketched quickly to capture him before he changed. Every evening they spent together in Sherlock’s little room, John passed in acute awareness of the tick of every second. Stealing these last few minutes before he must slink away into the night, back to his own bed, was a calculated risk of inviting unwanted attention to their habit of late nights behind closed doors.
Less than ninety seconds later, Sacramento scored again. Sherlock saw the bullet flying, slid aside to square up to it, raised the catching glove, and it went in beside his chest, just below his elbow. He felt the puck brush the sleeve of his sweater.
“OK then. I’ll, ah, leave you to it.”
be there tonight, after nine?” Sherlock’s tone was full of implication, but Jordan stayed cagey.
He nodded, finally met Sherlock’s gaze. Sherlock nodded back, biting down hard on his back teeth. “I appreciate that,” he said, and let his hand drop off the bottle’s neck, took a step toward the sitting room. As if startled to action, John strode firmly in the opposite direction, toward the door, speaking in a more business-like tone.
.” He mugged a knowing expression. “The artist is a lesbian, does custom work, a lot of commitment jewelry for The Gays. In particular, The Wealthy Gays.”
John replied quickly.
At last, blue light from beneath the keypad, and a welcoming triple-chirp, and John pulled the door handle before time ran out. Sherlock groped John through his trousers on the whole, long ride up in the elevator, even as John protested against the side of Sherlock’s throat that there was probably a security camera.
“I’d have been paying attention to how it started. I’d know her temp and I’d know if she vomited.”
There was the sound of Sherlock lifting his book from his table, smoothing his fingers down the page once he’d opened it. Then his low, sonorous voice–“I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind.”–and though John loved to hear him, and enjoyed the story, it was no time at all before he drifted, and then sank.
“Yes, fine.”
John cursed and praised. “Fuck! Oh, you pretty boy, lick me. Lick me. Yes.
John leaned close, even switched on the overhead for more light.
“You’re looking pretty casual,” he commented.
They recovered from their jet lag in an ultra-high-end log house on its own secluded peak in the Green Mountains, with views as far as New York state to the west and Canada to the north. There were rooms enough they might never even have had to interact with John’s sister Kim and her new boyfriend—Sherlock and John’s Boston Brawlers teammate—Shane Thurston, but the four frequently found themselves hovering around the kitchen island, making meals together, or sitting on deep sofas in the parlour, drinking wine and chatting for long hours between daytime excursions and late retirements to their separate wings. It was a proper holiday, one Sherlock felt he richly deserved after the forced march of time spent with his family. He and John visited two wineries, strolled a quaint downtown as unrepentant tourists (John bought Sherlock a horrible ball cap with a three-dimensional, plush moose sticking out the front, and Sherlock retaliated by wearing it publicly for four hours). In the evenings the four assembled dinners and Sherlock talked about the wine he’d bought that day, though it was not for him to say whether the education they received enhanced anyone’s appreciation of it.
“Change of plans,” John smiled at her. “What do you say we go to the shop and see if they’ve got any new cats in? And you can choose what we have for our supper tonight.”
“He teaches creative writing at Emerson. This is his side-gig; they don’t pay academics a living wage anymore.” John draped the towel over the corner of the bed and Sherlock looked his fill of his muscular bum and thighs as he went into a drawer for clean pants.
“So soon? Was that not enough to satisfy you?” Sherlock smirked.
“Yeah, no, I know.”
John was looking at him in a way that made Sherlock feel pierced and pinned. Not accusatory, precisely, but in the neighbourhood. Sherlock dug his fingernails into his palm, fist curled tight, and scanned for perfect recall of the past few hours despite knowing there was nothing to find.
in this room. Fuckin’
John shot Sherlock a covert, quizzical look. Sherlock gestured with one finger toward the floor, indicating Mrs Hudson must have taught her the old-fashioned euphemism. He mouthed,
Sherlock touched his hand, and his chin, and turned him and kissed him. “So how many?” he prompted.
John rolled onto his back and they didn’t touch, not even their thighs. Not even their fingers. They let out noisy sighs, sniffing and stretching. Sherlock worried for the state of his shirtfront. John did up his trousers, then cleared his throat. At last opening his eyes, Sherlock kept his gaze focused straight ahead: most of the ceiling, the top third of the opposite wall. His rapier hung there. The bee picture.
“You need not worry at all,” Sherlock assured him.
He never failed to find interest—if not downright intrigue—in the exploded disconnection of even the boldest, inkiest type under powerful magnification. Spaces so small they were invisible to the naked eye, and even to the enhanced one, but which gaped when viewed through a microscope’s lenses. Ink fell into crevasses and floated over ragged threads—sawdust—once the leg of an insect. Paper was technology, as well, and so was ink, printing, the rollers that churned out the evening news, the binding of his most treasured books. Not all bad, then, and he didn’t use that thumb for much, anyway.
Sherlock sat on his stool at the end of the visitors’ bench in the Canadian Airlines Centre during the pre-game ceremony retiring former Thrashers defenseman and captain John Watson’s number. All the Thrashers players wore their blue home jerseys, their own names replaced by
“Indeed.” Sherlock’s own smile was irrepressible; the preceding hours comprised all the best things about casework: cornering a criminal; a bit of a chase (on foot, hence his ruined shoes); a clap on the back from DCI Lestrade; and the ever-capable and sturdy John Watson at his side. Without waiting for a response to his offer, Sherlock poured whisky, then carried both glasses to the sitting room and lowered himself into his chair. As his back settled against the cushion, John arrived to claim his drink, and in another moment there they were, facing off beside the fire.
“Mm. I did grow accustomed to dinner and a movie with you.”
“I could have just brought her to you when she’s done playing,” John volunteered, preemptively fending off a grumpy reaction from Sherlock about having to put on shoes and coat to meet them in what Rosie was lately calling “the park at home.”
John half-shouted a curse.
“No,” Sherlock admitted. There was a beat of silence, in which he weighed his options. He took another swig of the wine to excuse his silence.
“You didn’t tell me you’d hooked up with Thurston.”
“OK guy?”
“True enough,” he allowed. “Going off resort grounds isn’t really encouraged, so most of the employees here and at the other two resorts nearby end up at our place, Mirage—have you and Mr Watson been?”
Sherlock would not be holding his breath for John to actually take him up on the offer. Anyway, he had a case to solve.
Sherlock could be heard behind him, still opening and shutting doors and sliding drawers in and out.
“Needs a few minutes to open up,” Sherlock said, and resumed his usual place. He cupped the bowl of his glass and gently swirled, trying to give the mediocre wine a breath of chance.
to work.”
Near midnight, John was pacing the lane through the sitting room to the kitchen and back again, still wearing his shoes, looking as if he were searching for something. Sherlock, shirt cuffs unbuttoned, folded himself into his leather chair and rubbed at his temples. Headaches were rare for him, but emotionally taxing situations brought them on. He could feel his pulse in his forehead.
“Of course.”
“Free Christmas biscuits with every purchase,” he said, settling the question of whether or no he would hoard the sweets for himself, for later, just in case.
John laughed more genuinely. “What for?”
Sherlock crouched behind John’s armchair, cheek to cheek, hands sliding down John’s shoulders until he could pluck the phone from his hand—John mugged outrage and said, “Hey!”—and set it on the side table, then left a hot streak of kisses from the notch beneath his earlobe to the edge of his shirt collar. John’s hand on the back of his neck massaged lightly, with more affection than heat. Sherlock arched and stretched beneath the touch, a cat leaning into the stroke of a hand.
Nearly a month had passed since the bus bombing incident, and Sherlock had seen Rosie but once—a too-short visit at 221B, during which Rosie whined that she wanted Sherlock to take her to a movie, John sharply informed her Sherlock wasn’t going anywhere until the brace came off his ankle, and Sherlock insisted it was the wrist splint that needed to go so that he could use a cane, and the ankle be damned. John had arrived glowering and turned downright surly at Sherlock’s use of mildly colourful language, and soon enough whisked Rosie down to Mrs Hudson, then away with no goodbyes.
“Something you need?” Sherlock asked, from a seat in the big grey leather armchair. He was cradling a book that looked quite old, probably priceless, and was dressed in silver-grey pyjama pants, his long feet bare and pale, a black t-shirt, and a burgundy-coloured dressing gown.
“Anyway, it’s ancient history, and what’s that they say? You can’t go back home again.”
“What kind of mood are you looking for?”
“Hey. You’re on speaker; Sherlock’s here.”
Sherlock blew across his phone screen, clearing off specks of fallen hair. The barber pulled too hard at a lock behind his neck; Sherlock grunt-growled his displeasure.
Without skipping a beat, John shifted from addressing the crowd, and then his sister, to addressing Sherlock. He had to look backward over his shoulder to find Sherlock in the crowd, and once they’d fixed eyes on each other, John said, “And Sherlock Holmes, I’m lucky you’ve got my back.” Sherlock smiled at him, and winked, and John—clearly off script for just a moment, said, “I’ve got yours, too.”
“I used toilet roll; I’m not an animal.”
“Get up and get dressed. I can tell already your dad’s not sure about me; let’s not give him the impression I’m one of those people that’s always late.”
her.” His voice broke on it, and his shoulders fell. He pressed his fingertips and thumb against the bridge of his nose, head down, and Sherlock could hear him struggling to calm himself with an audibly shaky inhalation of breath.
“I haven’t said anything,” John repeated, holding his hands up in surrender, or as a shield. “I understand about parents; I had my own.”
“Well, glad to be of service, I suppose. Will I see them at your ‘do on Christmas eve, then?”
Sherlock massaged his bollocks, skimmed his fingertips along his length, teasing his prick closer to attention.
here before,” he said, sounding pleased with himself for having guessed it.
“What time will we expect you tomorrow?” Mrs Holmes called after them. Sherlock shrugged and lowered himself into the car.
John attempted a deep inhalation but it was clear he was so tense his body would not allow it. Sherlock vaguely worried he might hyperventilate and pass out. The colour in his face was very poor indeed.
John leaned and scanned until he spotted the bottle among decidedly not foodsafe glassware and retrieved it. “I’ll pour you one?” he offered. Sherlock hummed assent.
“Yeah.” John shrugged. “I don’t know why I thought you’d just say your goodbyes and she’d be ready to go off to school as normal tomorrow.” His face crumpled horribly, and he covered part of it with the handkerchief in his hand. He shuddered. “I really am pretty terrible at this sometimes.”
“I explained to you it’s hard for him to get around right now, since he got hurt. It’s just easier for everyone for you to stay at home with me.”
Sherlock needlessly smoothed the front of his suit jacket and went to answer the door. John stood in the middle of his single room, feeling a bit swept up in Sherlock’s current, though he couldn’t say he minded. It was something to do.
“My mother could have had a much larger life. Speaking of wasting.”
“You’ll just eat them all up long before Christmas, if we buy them now.”
“Well,” he said gently, “I believe that, too.”
John was truly smiling by then, and they were only a few steps away from the promised platform and a less dramatic exposure to open space. “Did we win?”
A few steps from each to meet halfway, and John nestled in a hand where neck met shoulder, stroked a thumb over the surface of his skin, still warm from the bath.
There was a pot of slippery stuff open on a lower shelf, and Steven dipped in two fingers, scooped up a generous glob. As he rubbed it possessively deep into Sherlock’s arse, he rumbled, “Can I go inside?”
In the room, coach Lestrade talked at them, neither pleased nor riled. Sherlock didn’t hear a word of it, and once the coach turned them loose, he dug out his phone from his duffel and texted John.
The first aid kit was still under the foot of Sherlock’s bed. He clicked the plastic latches back and unfolded its many-layered interior, expanding shelves full of ointment packets and alcohol swabs, wet and dry dressings, strange-angled scissors, a miniature flashlight, and a tube of water-purification pills. In the bottom was a sling, a silver blanket folded improbably small, rolls of beige elastic bandage. His trousers were torn at the knees, the palms of his hands streaked raw and filled with street-grit. As the fabric of his trousers pulled away from where it had stuck to his scraped and bloody shins, Sherlock let out a whooshing hiss, then another, because the first had felt so nice. The back of his head ached where he’d been battered, probably with a length of pipe.
Hiding another hot flush, Sherlock turned halfway away and switched off the fire. “Thank you, John.”
. I’ll let John have it.”
“I see my dad,” she dutifully reported to her teacher, who looked where she was pointing and gave John a wave and a grin as she bid Rosie a good rest of the day. Rosie ran at him, and he bent to catch her; she swung in his embrace before setting her trainers back to earth. “Dadda! Why is it you today? Sherlock is meant to take me home, I thought.”
“Even so. I started hot, but the past couple weeks have been uneven, at best.”
After another few moments John finally gave up on any attempts to repress his amusement and said, “By the way, you’re lucky it’s not you that’s on fire, with your gown flapping about. Take that off. And put on some shoes; what if you drop a knife?” John invaded Sherlock’s space and took over the preparations for the jam. Sherlock looked cowed and shed his robe, then crossed the room and slipped his feet into a pair of his million-pound designer wingtips. John watched out the corner of his eye. “Where’s the candy thermometer?” John demanded, looking for it inside the previous pan.
“What
“Not really.”
“I’ll just sleep here tonight,” Sherlock said by way of reply. “Set me an alarm for half-seven.”
Sherlock found admirable; instead of passing around blame, John had chosen closure of ranks and a staunch, unconditional defense of his own. Sherlock tried not to find this protective assertion sexy, wondered if he was barred from attraction to John simply because their relationship had broken down, decided it was biological and beyond his ability to control, wallowed in momentary appreciation of the particular, firm set of John’s shoulders.
John cleared his throat. Sherlock looked at the shabby building again.
John looked back to Sherlock, standing with his hands in the pockets of his coat. He lifted one out and waved at Rosie, who barely noticed, having already dismissed him.
“Yes. And my answer to why your dad gave you that name is that while we knew her, Mary was a gentle and non-threatening sheep we both liked very much. While she was carrying you, she was the sheep. But once you were born, and came to live with your dad and me, she made it clear she wasn’t a sheep at all. She was a wolf.”
“Not at all,” the psychologist insisted. “Nothing worrisome, in terms of mental health. This is all developmentally appropriate. It’s only that—”
As John struggled to imagine who Sherlock’s mother thought he was, Sherlock interrupted. “There’s a car on its way for you. How unfortunate we can’t stay and chat, but John and I have a dinner reservation, and I’ve promised to let him take me to a movie afterward.”
“The fuck, Holmes?” George squinted and half-sat.
“You’re the face of the foundation,” Sherlock pointed out. “Showing your face is requisite.”
“Not at all. For the moment it’s only an investment property.” He sipped the wine, which was flattening and changing character; Sherlock wasn’t sure he liked the newer version.  After a pause, he said, “For the moment I’m looking only so far professionally as the next game, then the next. Feel like I’m getting my legs back under me but. . .” He waved his hand lightly in front of his shoulder. “You know.”
Sherlock glanced stagily at John, whose mouth had softened slightly. “No children. Project complete, then.” Sherlock laid down his pencil.
“You’re tired, sweetheart,” John told her, feeling truly sorry for her because he had some of the same and knew what it was like. “Let’s put screens away and get you ready to sleep.”
“I like these because of the mirror,” the handsome man said (for John had decided there was no reason not to notice he was handsome). “But I do wonder if, with party lighting--” He moved to switch off a nearby lamp, turned on a more distant one, flicked off the flourescent over the kitchen table in the adjacent room, “--it’s not a bit of a distraction.”
“Good, yeah. Meeting this morning with the publicist arranging my speaking engagements—that’s a bit weird—and then lunch with a writer from the Globe’s Sunday magazine. She’s doing a big story on concussion in kids’ leagues. This afternoon another meeting, with the guy they’ve got writing speeches for me.”
“I’m sure he’s not. Why would you think that?”
“He won’t put anything in writing before he submits the game roster.”
Breathe.
“No shouting in the morning, please.”
“Ice cream, please, Sherlock.”
Sherlock took a key from a false panel in a wooden planter full of evergreen shrubbery, and in the next block, used it to enter a small, nondescript flat. He immediately started making phone calls, keeping his coat on, shutting himself out on the balcony. John showed himself around, wondering how Sherlock had come to know the location of a well-hidden key to a flat in Leeds. Minimal kitchen with attached sitting area--not really large enough to be called a “room”--three piece bath, bedroom. John’s fist clenched tight around his bag’s carrying strap. There was only one bed.
“What’s the feeling there, Holmes?” Raynham asked, skating across to him as Sherlock lifted his mask. “Are you seeing them?”
“No, just ate my arse out until my cock was standing straight up, I was so hard. He loved it.” Watching John’s face was impossible; he jostled his phone so the camera could barely focus. Sherlock liked to hear him talk, liked imagining the scenario he described, and was even more turned on by the fact of John jacking off as he told it.
John lost his afternoon to casual gaming, videos of celebrities singing in a car, and scrolling social media where he was nominally present but inactive, which activated anxiety that sent him back to casual gaming. He stayed in the loop until the uncharacteristic silence above him stretched on long enough for him to notice.
Rosie whinged. “
JW: Do you?
“Not wearing it, though, am I? This is better. This is more important.”
.” Sotto voce, through gritted teeth.
“Drink?”
They walked the last half-block without speaking. John cleared his throat and outwardly composed himself, though his gut ached with the familiar roiling sensation of imminent disaster. He was failing her, again, and hating himself, again. But without time or energy just then to go on scolding himself for bad behaviour, he tightened it all down, and even forced some cheer into his voice as he said, “Here we are, then. Only three minutes later than I’d hoped. Got everything you need?”
Rosie steadied the bag and leaned against his middle, arms around him as much as she could manage while weighed down on one side.
“I don’t feel a burning need to pretend we’re really getting to know each other,” Steven said then, with his own sort of shrug. “So don’t feel like you have to make small talk.”
“--I consider myself married to my work.”
. About the calendar. Next few weeks. Could you maybe make sure—?”
John shrugged. “Movies? Or. . .concerts?”
There was an uncharacteristic seven-second pause in her chat-stream. Sherlock’s shoulders eased downward.
“Sometimes,” Sherlock said. He looked. . .amused? John felt wobbly.
“Too bad for Maynard then. Sure is a bitch when those birdies start flying around your head, eh?”
George’s contract rider called for local beer, mass-market crisps, a video game system, and bags of mixed nuts, the last of which he grabbed on his way out the door. Sherlock left behind an unopened packet of cigarettes and three unopened bottles of wine, at least some of which would no doubt follow him to their next hotel, in Shoreham.
Sherlock smiled despite himself—full of hatred for the hotel bed, a night full of random noise from the other side of every wall, dawn that took forever to come and yet managed to arrive far too soon—and drew one leg out from under the covers as he stretched away another sleepless night from his mildly-aching muscles.
He labeled it,
John’s gaze was penetrating and threatened to break Sherlock’s heart.
“Not particularly,” John replied, and his brow knitted a bit.
Sherlock texted back.
“What did you say?”
John wanted to scoff and dismiss those few weeks of tentative trying as wasted time. But after a calming, deep breath, he replied.
John grimaced, half-shook his head, an expression Sherlock knew would accompany a refusal, and said, “You know what? Sure. Yes. Thank you.” He moved to shrug off his coat, turned to hang it on the hall tree.
in bruises—old ones, newer ones, more than just a hyperactive kid who likes to jump off the top bunk, y’know?”
“It looks nice, either way. Not distracting,” John said. “When’s the party?”
Reality proved even more electrifying than Sherlock’s imagination: kneeling on a fluffed-up, folded-over bath towel while John perched on the tub’s perfect-height edge, the cascading wash of the fully-open tap a surreally sexy soundtrack, now and then punctuated by a gasp or groan. John’s hand cradling his aching jaw. John’s rampant cock silky-salt on his tongue. Semi-racing the rising water, Sherlock’s hands re-learned the shape of John’s thighs for the hundredth, three-hundredth time, the first of a thousand, three thousand, ever and ever as long as you’ll have me I’m yours, yours, oh. . .
“Another championship?”
“We have a heady decision before us, Watson. Consider the options carefully. Ready?”
John laughed out loud, causing Sherlock—curled in his chair in smart trousers, beautifully tailored shirt, bare feet, and silk dressing gown—to cast a questioning glance up from his phone.
John stormed in and slammed both doors to the landing, locking the two of them in together, his nostrils flaring in his fury.
“Sir Paul,” he said, feeling giddy, trying not to giggle. “Pleasure to meet you.”
was home—given how it had ended, and when. He reminded himself of the way Sherlock looked at him now, through his narrowed, stranger’s gaze. There was a wall between them, a mile high, and John had fitted in half the stones. At least half. Certainly he’d been the one to lay on the final course.
“I don’t know who those are.”
“I’m sure. Will you do the alphabet?”
“Ah.”
, had doubtless been carefully chosen to delight him, lay behind pale blue curtains, mumbling his name while he used two long fingers to count the cigarettes left in the packet inside his coat. The women, annoyingly, did not notice. Sherlock scowled more elaborately on subsequent passes.
John fell away, then came right back, sweeter kisses, full of that softening gratitude Sherlock had come to know in all their moments-after. Once John’s breath had calmed, he re-wet his fingers with a quick slip of tongue, and busied his fingertips with the ticklish edges of Sherlock’s foreskin, teasing his crown with slick smoothing and returning, which made Sherlock throb and shiver, his breath gusting out and sucking in, brittle shards of air carrying the barest hints of his dark voice.
“Forgive me, I got my calendar mixed up,” Sherlock replied, and reached for the door, pushing it shut and cutting off any further need for playacting for his parents’ benefit.
Sherlock crouched and narrowed his eyes as play moved toward him, a slow-paced ebb and flow as his team passed around the neutral zone, losing the puck then regaining control only to have it poked away or have a pass intercepted. Soon enough there were red sweaters flying his way, Brawlers in white giving chase and setting up to defend him.
He bit a possessive kiss onto the back of Sherlock’s neck, just above his shirt collar, and finally let him go; as he stepped away from Sherlock’s back, Sherlock had a strange collapsing sensation, despite his hand firmly on the shelf’s edge, he felt as if something that had been supporting him had been suddenly yanked away, and he had to catch himself falling. He wondered if he could trust his legs to keep him upright; he felt weak all over.
He cleaned his teeth then curved down onto the not-quite-long-enough sofa, and gave himself a talking-to about getting sentimental. About loneliness and a need to get back out there. About how Sherlock was still all of the things John couldn’t abide, and still none of the things John had come to need. They’d have a nice Christmas Eve—presents for Rosie and tea with Mrs H, and now crackers so there’d be paper crowns and bad jokes, a proper little party—and then John would come home. At least with Rosie at Baker Street, he’d be able to sleep full-length in the bed.
“Soon as we’re alone for good I’m going to bend you over that desk and lick your arse until you’re begging.”
“Mustn’t fool ourselves into thinking there’s much of anything else between us that’s any good.”
As if on cue, there came the rattle of the garden door, John’s trainers squeaking on the kitchen lino, and Mrs Holmes’s high, wittering voice.
Sherlock whisked his phone up off the table beside the bed—antlers and glass, he’d once liked it but now wasn’t so sure—scrolled and tapped to summon a car. “Let’s get it over with,” he said grimly. “If we can get out in time, there’s a shop in the same street as the agent’s office that has authentic Danish pastries and excellent coffee.”
The bell went, and he listened but did not move. Mrs Hudson answered; Sherlock should not have let her, after dark, one never knew, and he felt a twinge of guilt over it that drove him to his feet.
“You’re probably right,” Sherlock allowed. Only slightly changing the subject, he added, “I’ve been thinking about meditation.”
“If you moved in here. With me.” Sherlock’s gaze was unwavering. It was an outrageous request. John wanted desperately to say yes.
Sherlock punched the pillow beside George’s head, opening his fist to leave behind the drugs; George scrambled to catch it all before it fell and became lost between the bed and the wall.
“What’s our wake-up call time?” George asked, staring into the mini-fridge but ultimately coming up empty-handed.
“Can we buy pizza for dinner, Dadda?”
“Crisps, too?”
“Can’t have Rosie seeing me come out of this room in the morning and getting wrong ideas,” John said, matter-of-fact and distant, that way he had become. After a moment, he sighed quietly and Sherlock could see his head shake, in the corner of his field of vision, then closed his eyes not to see more. “Anyway, it’s not like anything’s changed.”
Sherlock carried on playing even as he grinned and offered, “Time for whisky, then.”
“Perhaps not tomorrow,” was all he said, forcing some false apology into his tone. “Got to run. See you. When.” Another shrug and the driver shut the door.
“Something for my brother.”
“Anyway, just. . .Good to have you back, mate.”
Despite his best efforts and determination to get some sleep, when his phone gently buzzed against the tabletop, he went straight for it.
On nights when they were at home together, John was his true north, the star by which he could navigate, steady and sexy and witty and kind. Being with John was the one and only easy thing in his life, and the ease made Sherlock lazy and slack; while he lay awake for maddening hours in hotel rooms, in their flat he felt nearly narcoleptic with a need to catch up on missed sleep. He dozed on the sofa, in his chair, on the bed when he was meant to be listening to the details of John’s day, watching tapes of his old games, dinner and a movie under the quilts with John’s bare foot resting on Sherlock’s calf. He apologised and John said he understood, didn’t mind, and shrugged it off. Sherlock counted the condoms and packets of slick in the bedside drawer, hated himself for it because of course he could just ask. Anyway, John had once made some comment that indicated he preferred to keep their flat their own. But Sherlock didn’t ask, and he didn’t know why he didn’t ask.
“About Sunday. I’ll text you.”
Mike: Really?
Sherlock fiddled with the steamed-milk contraption, at the edge of the kitchen, nearest the sitting room. “I love Christmas,” Sherlock said. “Always have. I have always tried to make a beautiful, perfect holiday. Decorating, sending notes, a party with lovely food and drink and tolerable people.”
“We’re good at it,” John agreed. “Always have been.” Sherlock nodded and, when he opened his eyes, found John looking down at him, glowing with something warmer than mere satisfaction. Affection.
“Thank you.” John fell away then, making room for Sherlock to stand. With his feet under him, Sherlock contemplated alternative endings, various scenarios clicking through his mind, light-and-dark, like photographic slides.
Someone had slid the post under John’s door while he was at the library. He’d thought the change of scenery might persuade him to concentrate more profoundly on finishing the online application for an NHS position though in the end he’d found a comfortable chair by an upstairs window and read half a Roddy Doyle novel.
Sherlock smiled. “Indeed.” He passed a glass to John, who eagerly, almost reverently, wafted it beneath his chin, letting the scent find him.
“Sore?” John grinned, a bit devilishly, which Sherlock thought a bit cruel; he very well knew how painful the first day at training camp could be. He loosened his necktie and top two shirt buttons, ignored the tea in favour of lifting Sherlock’s calves in his hands so they could share the sofa. He went straight to work massaging Sherlock’s bare feet. “Blister there. I told you to break in those trainers a bit more.”
“Whoo-whee?” Rosie tried again.
John still hadn’t moved. He took inventory of his body’s sensations and could not find the pain that had plagued him from hip to knee ever since he’d left Afghanistan.
“Have you tried calling him?” John asked, and he did begin to feel mildly alarmed, though he was aware at times Mrs Hudson had only piecemeal information and might very well be conflating two unrelated facts. Nonetheless, he walked to the waiting room, where a television set hung in one corner. It was Sherlock’s day to pick up Rosie from school so she could be with him for his birthday; certainly he wouldn’t have been doing significant, might-wreck-Rosie’s-schedule casework a few hours before the end of her school day.
“Yeah, well,” George said, and shrugged.
John shook his head in disbelief of his own tragedy, spoke around a half-chewed mouthful of a cheeseburger. “Over two hours. I nearly wept when they told me it was time to leave. Don’t mind saying.”
“I assure you it will be quick and painless.”
“Christ,” John muttered, and followed it with a tension-release laugh. “Shouldn’t have started this. Can we go?”
John frowned and shook his head. “Dunno.”
Sherlock looked at John for the first time since they’d met at the front door
Sherlock had nodded and hummed assent; he’d liked her, too, before it all went sideways.
“Can I have your ass this time?”
“We miss each other. Love each other.”
“Anyway,” he said, in a lighter, decisive tone, “That’s enough death and depression for one afternoon, I think. Care to see if Mrs Hudson’s got any cake in?”
Even now, as you lie open to me, beneath me, as I trace the hollows beside firm muscle and press my mouth against tender places that sink beneath the pressure of my kiss, there is poetry in my heart that will not rise into my throat or bend my tongue to tell you that you are exquisitely beautiful, that I am a supplicant at the altar of your magnificent body, that you are sweetness and sweat and fine golden hair that stands up when I blow across it, and that all that you are is a perfect gift I surely do not deserve.
“Shit, man. Whatever you want.” His tone indicated that Sherlock surely already knew this to be the case. “If you need something—”
“Tell your face, then, darling,” John said in a tone that made Sherlock laugh and Rosie frown.
“Flying under the radar. The Rush had a piss-poor season last year.”
Best just to come out with it. “You remember once I said that being with you is the only easy thing in my life?”
“Tell your sister,” Sherlock prompted, and turned to the wardrobe for a suit. John dialed, waited.
It didn’t occur to John to argue; he was already shrugging his coat on. “What are you shopping for?” he asked, as the two made their way toward the heavy front door.
“Thought you’d overslept.”
Sherlock, strangely obedient, nodded and started out to the landing. John zeroed out the kitchen scale and weighed the berries.
“Sorry, Mrs H,” John muttered, then shouted, “Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson let out a wittering sound, and Sherlock stepped backward from the door. John’s feet thudding up the stairs, the gentle shush of the front door as Mrs Hudson closed it behind him.
“In that case, consider yourself deputised. Count the heads, everyone out. Out, out!” Sherlock waved his arms at them, shooing them, trailing as he worked his phone. “Lestrade, it’s me. Bomb squad to Hounslow bus garage, soon as you can manage. Orpington, too. I realise there’s only so many available, but there are
“I won’t waste it; I wouldn’t finish the bottle on my own.” Instead he poured tea for both of them, left Sherlock’s black but brought the sugar bowl just in case. Sherlock tipped in only a third of his usual.
George snorted a half-laugh at the mild joke. “Seriously, this conversation never happened. I’m just.” He gestured vaguely with one hand in the air. “Whatever. I’m cool.”
“I miss hearing you. The sounds you make. Slide up a little; let me. . .”
Rosie dropped her overnight bag beside the hall tree on the landing, shook her way out of the straps of her rucksack and her cardigan all in one go and let them fall. She ran to where Sherlock sat on the back of his leather armchair with bare feet on the seat cushion, and tugged at his arm for him to lean sideways. When he was within catching distance, she kissed his cheek.
“Can you not. . .Is it like that? That you can’t be in the same place together?”
“Which is your room, Mother?” Sherlock asked, even as she spread a plastic-paged photo album open before them. John moved his chair closer to Sherlock’s. Mrs Holmes looked puzzled and sounded annoyed, as if she thought Sherlock was making her the butt of a joke she didn’t quite get.
“Say nothing,” Sherlock insisted, gripping the butt end between his teeth as he shook out the match and let it go out the corner of the open window.
JW: That was an astounding moment. That should be the headline.
“See you around.”
It was a terrible expression on John’s face as he rushed up the hallway, and Sherlock had an intense, instant desire to repair it. Another job no longer his, in the larger scheme, but at the moment he could at least make a go.
Sherlock found the landmarks, nodded, worked at Steven’s belt. The hands roaming his torso moved on to resculpt the curve of his arse, brushed hard against the button placket of his trousers, and drifted sideways and down, feeling for the shape of his prick. Sherlock’s breath caught, and the tycoon hummed satisfaction.
“I wanted to choke on it,” Sherlock muttered, and he felt John’s full-body shiver in response, including a break in the rhythm of his stroking.  They kissed again, and one or the other wordlessly suggested moving to the bed, so they took the few required steps and landed on their sides, face to face. Sherlock’s shirt was bunched up beneath his armpits; John’s trousers were around his knees, and he worked one leg free, but left the other.
“So I’ve heard,” he replied, then joked, “Bit of short notice; I actually had other plans.”
“You worry about your drinking,” Sherlock said plainly, out of nowhere. “But you’re not an alcoholic.”
“Ah, moment please.” He limped to the door and unlocked it, pulled it open to find Sherlock standing there in a smart, slim-cut suit and pale blue shirt, with shoes on and his hair arranged, a not insignificant change from the disheveled, partly-mad figure he’d cut the previous day. “What can I do for you?”
John looked hesitant but quickly chose to go along. “I bought some lamb chops. Don’t know how to cook them but I imagine you do, or can find out how and do brilliantly at it.”
“I think
He let his hand come to rest cradled across the broadest part of her back, feeling the rise and fall of her ribcage. John had once confessed he couldn’t bear to feel her heartbeat against his hand, didn’t like to watch her breathe for too long, because it made him feel helpless in the face of her fragility. Sherlock, though, had always admired her resilience and sturdiness, the way she lengthened and toughened with each passing week. She was the most remarkable machine he had ever encountered. He counted thirty of her breaths, then pulled up the quilt and switched off the lamp. Even though it had been nearly three years since she’d routinely woken in the night, Sherlock left the door open just enough to hear her.
“I don’t have her mum’s phone number, I’m afraid.” John chastised himself; he’d chatted with the girl’s mother—a solicitor who hated her job—many times, but their acquaintance was limited to chance though frequent encounters at the park, where both girls burned off energy before dinner, baths, and bedtimes. It had never been necessary before to have a way to arrange an appointment for Rosie to meet up with her friend.
He called John.
“Seriously, I want to come. Unless you really don’t want me to.”
“That’s true,” John said, feeling grim about it but keeping his voice light. “Being angry doesn’t mean you can’t forgive each other. It’s better to keep a friend than to keep being angry.”
“Possibly, but I doubt it. It would have been difficult for you to be there if it wasn’t.”
He moved to pocket his phone but to his surprise, it buzzed to life in his hand.
“Yes, fine. Very good.”
“They won’t let me in to see her. Everything’s fine. But apparently it takes more than a child clinging to you, crying, to prove parental status.”
. . .” She dramatically sloped her shoulders to illustrate.
Shocked into obedience, John followed him. Leading them down the stairs, where John couldn’t see, Sherlock bit his grinning lips. As they reached the lower landing, Sherlock heard Mrs Hudson telling Mycroft in an icy voice, “You can go, too.” Sherlock imagined that despite Mycroft’s obvious desire to make Rosie like him, he would not need to be told twice.
“Every night, after nine.”
“Thursday, you’re right,” he replied.
“Sounds like fun.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said, monotone. It might really be fine or it might not; Sherlock was not giving much away to John these days. His hand drifted up toward his chest, going for cigarettes again. A divorceable offense, five years ago.
“We didn’t win
“Let’s not traumatise the driver,” Sherlock said at last, suppressing mischievous laughter and a semi-erection. He sat back but left his hand on John’s thigh, tracing mismatching circles with the tips of his fingers along John’s inseam.
Sherlock was playing a Boulogne sonata, eyes closed, in front of the fire.
“And so am I.” Sherlock reached for him, and John stepped up into his embrace, which was crushing, and accompanied by another firm kiss in his hair, then on the tail of his eyebrow, his cheek, and finally his mouth. They lingered in it for a few moments, then reverted to Sherlock just holding him. John’s hands were clasped at the small of Sherlock’s back. “Well done,” Sherlock told him. “It was a truly magnificent career.”
Sherlock hummed, nodding, biting his lips.
“Watson would like it. And I find it amusing to watch you in situations so far outside your usual comfort zone. I’ll give her your number and she can text you.”
“Mince pies,” Sherlock replied without hesitation. “And you?”
John rubbed his forehead and returned his attention to his computer. And it started up again, further to his right. He looked at the ceiling as if it could tell him something. The flurry of footsteps made their random, thudding way around the room, then came a scrape and a thud, and a sound like ball bearings rolling down the slight Baker Streetward slope of the floors. Sherlock let out a rumbling complaint--words John could not discern--and silence fell once more.
“The what, dear?”
Sherlock spasmed with pleasure—a body-long shudder from taut shoulders to splaying toes—and he hovered at the precipice, wanting to succumb, wanting to linger there on the edge. He held his eyes shut, knowing that to see John’s hard-edged, gasping face; his exertions evident in his expression; the way he would suck in his bottom lip and bite it—to see all of that—any of that—would certainly end him. He was so close,
“Yes, yes,” John waved him off. “You’ll always be the spring to my autumn, Sherlock.”
“Like I remember you played two years at Michigan, then a year in the AHL before getting a break with the Gold Rush in the post-season. Scored four in two games.”
Mike: So Sherlock was surprised when you just said on television, “My boyfriend’s taking me home to meet his family.”
“Boston’s the opponent that night,” John told her.
“Impossibly so,” Sherlock replied, and pulled John close, settling his knees into the seafloor’s silky sand. They kissed and caressed and it ended with soft laughter, mischievous as if with a shared secret. Sherlock looked around. “No one can see,” he ventured.
Jordan arrived with a decent approximation of afternoon tea—exotic fruits replacing the more expected berries and apples in the bite-size tarts, and seafood finger sandwiches subbing in for ham salad—and set the electric kettle humming while he readied the cups and pot.
“Good then.” Sherlock sighed, and John took hold of his other foot, firmly pinching and releasing his Achilles tendon, then digging into the flat of his heel with strong thumbs.
There came a heavy knock at the front door, then for good measure the buzzer went, as well.
“The fuck—?” John caught himself, flashed a quick smile at the senior citizen at the front desk. “Science thing?” he asked, false casual.
Sherlock could not remember the last time he’d so desperately wanted a smoke, which he recognised as a final and sure sign he had gone too far, and so must give them up once more, and soon. He paced the corridor, scowling at the women behind the desk each time he passed, reminding them the depth of injustice he suffered while a child whose first word,
“Sunday?” Not waiting for confirmation, she stopped suddenly and John nearly ran into her back, side-stepped and laid a hand on her shoulder to urge her to keep moving. “There’s going to be new cats in the Rubicats game; I know because Megan Ashley Plays said yesterday the people who make the game are going to do a daisy cat and sunshine cat for the first day of spring.”
“AnarchoTec is doing something with data collection the Chinese would love to get their hands on,” he offered. “There’s an update soon. And a programmer involved in keeping it all secure hasn’t been a housebreaking victim yet.”
“Calories I don’t need, for the time being,” Sherlock said. “But go ahead if you like.”
“It’s that uncertainty I can’t live with.” John corrected himself, “Couldn’t live with.” Another quick throat-clearing, another fidget with his wristwatch, then the cuff of his shirt.
Shortly, the patriarch emerged, his cardigan buttoned tight across a rounded middle at odds with the rest of his frame, slender to the point of near-skeletal. Sherlock considered his father’s hands a dire foretelling of his own future—familiarly long fingers covered in too-pink, too-slack skin; knotty knuckles some of which no longer fully straightened; pink-brown spots of variant size and intensity. The future was a horror. Best to stay present, where everything—even the hideous evidence of human decay—was as it should be. Mr Holmes swept one of those crepey hands across his forehead, resettling thin, white hair that hadn’t been out of place to begin with. John rose from his chair, out of automatic respect, and Sherlock reluctantly followed, out of a desire to flee.
Sherlock consulted his wristwatch. “We really must go.” His jaw ached from clenching it; bad news for John. He next looked at his own sturdy, smooth-skinned hands, whose beauty and capacity must not be allowed to go to waste.
“See? We’re here safe in our bedroom.”
When they let each other go, each turned away, and they moved apart like objects suddenly unbound by gravity. Sherlock picked up the empty glasses; John went for the door. There was nothing more to be said.
“If you were, it would already have taken you down,” Sherlock said. John shrugged a bit, had a feeling Sherlock was right. He’d have to look at it some other time. “You use your family’s penchant for alcohol abuse as a way to connect with them, as family togetherness was never a strength. But you’ll never get there, so you should strongly consider just enjoying a drink now and then and not wallowing in angst over it. That’s another sort of abuse.”
JW: And that the two of us are together.
The Carolina Vikings were no match for the Brawlers even on their own home ice, and Sherlock got the win in their last game before the holiday break. Christmas eve was spent in Hamilton with John’s sister Kim, and the two took on the challenge of near-silent sex in the guest bedroom in Kim’s little house, holding their breath, swallowing each other’s noises, sensitive to every creak of the mattress or thud of the headboard. Christmas morning she had friends over for brunch; notably absent was Shane Thurston, though when John asked, Kim was quite casual about the fact he’d invited her to join his family for the holiday, but she thought it was a bit soon. John, ever protective of his sister, seemed happy to let the discussion end there, but Sherlock fixed Kim with a penetrating look and she admitted the relationship was quite serious despite the two not spending Christmas together. Indeed, less than an hour later, she answered a call to her mobile phone and drifted away from the party, behind a closed door.
“Tell you what. When you’re with Sherlock tomorrow after school, you can put him on the case, and I’m sure he’ll sort it all out. He’ll send me Lulu’s mum’s number, and we can arrange a playdate for you here at our playground, some afternoon or on a weekend. How’s that sound?”
“A bit. Now and then. You and Thurty up my arse all week hasn’t let me forget it very often.”
“Course you will. Go and get your boots on.”
Later that night, back in his too-expensive, too-little-lived-in flat, they ordered a heavy meal and put half of it away for later. They drank a sweet, cold torrontes wine, the rims of the glasses carressed with a wedge of lime. Sherlock tossed his few remaining cigarettes in the bin and covered them with plate-scrapings. John walked barefoot across the lofty carpets, and Sherlock caught his hand and drew him toward the bedroom.
“No.”
“Don’t
Sherlock set down the empty bottle, let his hand linger curled around its neck, resting on its shoulder. He felt his lips tighten.
“Right after the game tonight,” Sherlock confirmed, then added somewhat snidely, “Do you want me to arrange tickets for you?”
“If typing on a computer is going to be your new definition of fun, we need to discuss a few things,” Sherlock joked.
, he started.
“Yes. . .but,” John began.
Sherlock blinked. He’d quick-drifted—an old, bad habit—and was very far away from all of it; he heard the words but nothing touched him. John’s jaw was set, his face as smooth as it got, which Sherlock knew to be the sign of a dangerous mood. His eyes were dry. He tipped his chin up fractionally, in that particular way he had, and then nodded tightly at himself and his resolve. Moved toward the basket beside the sofa, dolls and a few plastic vehicles, books she hadn’t wanted to hear since she was three.
Without further excuses or explanation, here’s the highlight reel:
“Whisky? If you have it.”
. . .until he ran out of breath. There with his eyes shut and his skin warmed beneath the surface, he could have slipped straight into sleep.
“Not sure. I think poetry. He also teaches two literature courses—I know that for sure.”
“Yes,” he said, nodding. “That’s a good word for it. We’re good together—at this.” He stirred, too, in front of his chest.
“I wasn’t sure,” he said sheepishly.
Sherlock thought automatically, but definitely did not say aloud.
“The luncheon I’m speaking at falls between his morning and afternoon classes.” John raised his eyebrows, then set them back in place. “I don’t know how much I’m enjoying all the speech-giving, if I’m honest.”
Sherlock took several strides away, crouching to catch Rosie as she jogged to them. He embraced her and kissed her head, and let her go.
Sherlock trailed him into the bedroom, stopping on the way to set their empty glasses in the sink, playing the good host by insisting on finding John sheets and quilts, his own old pillows from his own old side of the bed. He hugged the bundle in one arm, layer upon layer, readying it to pass to John, or perhaps to carry to the sofa and make it up himself? Sherlock was unsure where hosting ended and butling began. John had been holding his pillow by its corner and set it on the foot of the bed.
“I’ll just have one.”
“I insist.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows a bit, then let them settle. “Of course you will,” he said decisively, then vanished.
Sherlock gladly accepted a couple dozen bumps on his helmet in recognition of his shutout, showered, dressed, and filed onto the bus. His teammates were jovial and loud, trading praise and insults in roughly equal quantity as usual. Sherlock held his phone low, scrolling and tapping. It interrupted him with a quick double-buzz and a text appeared.
“This place looks amazing,” John said.
“One never knows,” Sherlock mused.
Sherlock fixed his eyes on John, still wrapped at the waist in a towel after the shower they’d shared, and with a deliberate, scanning gaze, silently laid claim to every inch of him from golden-blonde fringe to bare, stubby toes.
“Well that’s good news! I’ll bet Maisy’s glad about that—getting to be a big sister.”
JW: Of course.
John was busying himself fetching out plates and glasses and flatware, while Sherlock took a kitchen chair so as to be more at Rosie’s level. She began to draw out tiny cats and their even tinier accoutrements by the fistful, making a jumbled pile on the tabletop.
“No, I mean we’ll go to our flat, sweetheart.”
“It was—” John said then, and turned his gaze away when Sherlock met it. “Thanks for making me. It was good.”
Leaning slightly closer, John lowered his voice and gave Sherlock a penetrating gaze. “Loads of sex.”
“Take care,” John said to Sherlock’s back, probably loud enough for him to hear though it didn’t matter. He’d got his answer before he’d asked. Sherlock wasn’t open to trying again, and John was no longer in a position to ask that Sherlock justify himself. That was it, then.
“Well, don’t know how much help I’ve been. I’d like to have another go at it,” John volunteered, then backed off. “If you need it.”
“Nothing exciting. Forgeries. Financial shenanigans.” Sherlock’s shins were still scabbed from his last case; for the moment he was relieved for something he could do in daylight, on borrowed computers.
“Tomorrow.”
The two made themselves useful to the elder Holmeses by moving a pair of small sofas, rotating them so that the firmer cushions of the less-used couch got a turn at being flattened by Sherlock’s mother sitting at one end with her knitting, and his father at the other with his book, while the television showed
He nodded. “I agree. Sometimes it’s best.”
Sherlock huffed a sigh out his nose. The barber laid two fingers on his temple to persuade a head tilt and Sherlock found it deeply annoying but ultimately complied. The first half of the email had given him a pleasant wash of that old familiar sensation of
John had been too busy to engage with his online therapist except during their regularly scheduled chats, given the adjustments of having Rosie at home every night, taking her back and forth to school, dance, and vitally important appointments with playfriends. To say nothing of his work, where he was dead on his feet half the time, or of how his back hurt from spending every night on the sofa so that Rosie could have the bed. Time to look for a new flat, he thought, but it was terribly unlikely he’d find anything even the same, let alone bigger—a proper bedroom, or at least the space for two beds, even if one of them was in an alcove, cupboard, or under some stairs—because he was already stretching frighteningly thin, in multiple directions, to cover the rent.
“It’s a vintage cocktail?”
“It’s on the other side of the island. Sounds far but of course you can walk there in less than ten minutes. Classic disco, not my favourite, but it’s friendly.”
Sherlock knew every version of John’s response.
John’s head nodded softly against Sherlock’s chest. After a moment he murmured, “I can’t take her from you, Sherlock. I couldn’t. I was just. . .”
Their words trailed off, and it became full dark with surprising speed. The stars were vibrant and countless, so unlike the sky over the many cities they’d bedded down in as to seem unreal. A log shifted in the fireplace, threw up sparks and a loud cracking noise. They undressed each other slowly, taking time to kiss and praise, to trace shadows and warm each other’s newly-bared skin with sighs. Sherlock sucked gently at the just of bone at the outer corner of John’s wrist. Raked fingers through his chest hair. Rolled up to lie along the length of him, and later rolled down to feel the weight of solid hips and thighs as John hovered above him, adoring eyes just visible in the faded, filtered evening light.
As they approached the main doors, Sherlock found a bin and ditched the cups. At the front desk John introduced them and indicated they had an appointment with Ms Shea, Rosie’s teacher. They were installed in a small conference room with all the chairs alike and uncomfortable—not quite high enough in relation to the table—and sat, still wearing their coats. John folded his hands in front of him on the tabletop; his thumb worked absently against the one pinned beneath it. Sherlock restrained himself from putting his hand on top of John’s to quiet the fidget. He longed for a view, but the windows were high up and narrow, and all he saw through them was the white-grey sky.
. No need to waste future time searching, somewhere else, hurried and insecure, when he knew he could get it just like that, just to have it, just in case.
“Something like that.”
“Learn what in particular, my love?” John replied, smiling and licking his lips. He had never seen Sherlock in such a state, for he was moderate in his every habit; the spectacle of a philosophical, not-quite-maudlin, drunken Sherlock Holmes was as amusing as it was amazing.
To the three guys firing on him—John, Mellon, and Bouchard—Raynham called out, “Go stick side high, one out of three. Fire away.”
“A comparative study of antique paper stock,” Sherlock began, “Fibers, additives, absorption and repulsion of ink and other liquids.”
Sherlock went through his motions as the music blared for the warm-ups, bending his knees, snapping his wrist to catch pucks fired at him by his teammates, stretching upright and then settling into his crouch, rattling his stick against the goal posts—left, right, left—and tossing his head on his neck. He stopped puck after puck, then went to the bench for a final equipment check and to wait for the start. The first game of the season on home ice meant an introduction of the whole team, not just the starters; Sherlock hated the delay but enjoyed his moment in the spotlight, the low, growling cry of “
Rosie stood close by his side and pointed. “This is you on a case about stolen cats and guinea pigs, and this is me helping you find the clues.”
John near-shouted, urging him on, “Yes,
“Fine. Yes,” Sherlock affirmed. “Well.” He had not anticipated difficulty finding words. John looked expectant, and only slightly less worried. He reached for Sherlock’s hand, covered it with his own, then moved to cradle it on his knee. Sherlock felt the muscles of his jaw soften; his man melted him even at times of high tension.
“Another time,” Sherlock said. The edgy finality in his tone persuaded John to drop the issue.
“All right, then. That’s fine. Understandable.” Before Sherlock could say anything more, John lifted his voice and called across the park, “Rose! Home time! Come on now, it’s cold.”
“Wow,” John said, with a fake, we’re-in-this-together sort of laugh. “That’s a bit of something.” He picked up the paper, tilted it toward Sherlock, who made a show of looking at it, nodding, maintaining the frown that might help him avoid trouble later. “A monster?” John offered.
John groaned, and sniffed, and turned his head to rest his cheek against Sherlock’s chest. He went soft in Sherlock’s embrace, surrendering.
SH: And despite what he tells himself, he had no choice. In conclusion, yes, we’re living together.
Sherlock knew the spot. Not every NHL city was one he’d visited while playing in the minors, but a few overlapped. By the time he’d got his call-up he’d sorted himself, but it was easy enough to discover where dealers and their customers were likely to gather just by close attention to stories shared at meetings he’d sought out almost daily when first he’d been sprung, newly detoxed and with a determination so gritty he felt it between his teeth. His memory was such that he could call up the list like an address book of Places Never To Go, with highlighted entries for those Places Never To Go
Well. Not in the new year, anyway.
George’s face crumpled in a smile-frown, and he nodded, all indicative of a suddenly-retrieved memory. “Watson got his bell rung a few times over the years, right? Isn’t that his cause now?”
“What was all the noise, by the way?” John asked.
Sherlock grunted a humourless quarter-laugh. “I would never.”
It was John’s turn to nod. His gaze was ravenous; Sherlock longed to force his tongue into John’s open mouth, hold his head, push him back and back and—fuck’s sake, the wall was a day’s walk from where they stood. It really was a hideous place. John’s voice snapped Sherlock back to the more imperative, present discussion. “I was thinking—listen—thinking about holding your throat while you suck him off. Touching your face. Guiding you by the hair.”
“Those tiny, tiny mints,” she insisted, indicating with finger and thumb. “In a metal, like, box.”
It was hours before Sherlock replied to his text asking about Mrs Hudson’s birthday; Rosie was asleep and John had already scolded himself twice that it was really time he put down his phone and close his eyes, but the sofa he slept on was particularly uncomfortable that night, and he had rearranged himself and his bedding countless times. After completely stripping the blankets off the sofa and switching his head to the opposite end, he’d started browsing flats to let, anywhere in shouting distance of Rose’s school. The rental fees would have made him laugh if he weren’t so discouraged by them.
“The psychosomatic limp.”
“We were objectively better than you guys that year,” John put in, and Sherlock tightened the grip on the back of his hand and began to slowly persuade it along the rail, taking a half-step backwards, urging John to follow him.
“What a help you’ve been, John; I can’t thank you enough.”
“Things.”
Sherlock was given an address and a number to text when he arrived. He joined the flow of his teammates filing off the bus, and while they headed into the hotel lobby through the slow-revolving door, Sherlock peeled off from the group and engaged the concierge stationed at the taxi stand. In under a minute, he was on his way.
Sherlock trailed him, a looming shadow over his right shoulder, now glaring through narrowed eyes. He knew his handsomeness punctuated such scornful expressions, and so pressed his eyebrows nearer each other. His singular focus on firing a laser of his scorn at the women behind the desk made him miss what was being said—John asking, the women too casual in their replies, John apologising—and then John was stalking away after a straight-faced young man in purple-red scrubs. It was only when yet another nobody attempted to bar Sherlock’s entry that John remembered to indicate, “It’s all right; he’s with me. With us. He can come.”
But then there was the fact of Sherlock’s brother, redolent of stinking abuses of power, always able to fix whatever needed fixing, by whatever means required, without it ever coming back to haunt him. Whatever ledge John had managed to talk himself down from, he quickly climbed right back on it, feeling grim as ever. His phone sounded and he fished it from his pocket, leaned back uncomfortably against a wire fence.
“Come
Sherlock let out a soft, sharp, “Ha!” and John worked his eyebrows.
They fell quiet once more, facing each other down but looking away. John drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair, and checked his watch again. Sherlock, still holding the one John had returned, smoothed the pad of his thumb over the crystal bezel.
“It’s hard to know whether there’s a genetic component to international criminal mastermind,” Sherlock offered, and he was far less successful at repressing a grin of his own, “But all the reading I’ve done indicates nurture can override nature to a remarkable extent. We do stay on the right side of the law.”
“Kind of you to join us, Watson,” Sherlock intoned as John took his seat, the mild irritation in his voice mostly put-on, John knew, for benefit of the rest of the staff there gathered. Few of them were listening, lost in their own chatter, and anyway John felt sure he’d soon enough be forgiven for his late arrival.
“You know how it’s Granny’s birthday soon? I think Saturday or maybe Thursday?” Rosie asked, as ever flitting from topic to topic like a water bug skating over the surface of a pond. John reflexively pulled out his own phone and looked at his calendar.
“Good sleep,
“Thank you.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “With steamed milk?”
“And it doesn’t cost any money!” Rosie said enthusiastically, as if she had been frugal her whole life and was pleased at the opportunity to flaunt her thriftiness.
-- Oh. No. Here it is.” John set his phone on the worktop and Sherlock began measuring out the sugar. He looked livid.
Which was a thing he’d done a great deal of with Sherlock, come to think of it, in their last year or so together. Somewhere along the way he’d begun to substitute contempt for his former admiration of Sherlock’s work, his taste, his parenting, the telly he chose, the way he wore his coat. John realised he’d felt closest to Sherlock in the early days, when they were working together, and then, later, when Sherlock occasionally surprised him by taking the lead with Rosie’s care—changing a nappy without being asked, getting up for the two a.m. feed or to reassure her after a nightmare, running her bath after dinner so John could read the paper. John was white-knuckling his way through raising his girl, always, even seven years on, and to have a little of the burden lifted helped him downshift to a place where he could relax and meet Sherlock in the middle.
Sherlock smiled to himself, looked across at the empty armchair that had been John’s favoured retreat since the very first day.
Sherlock was lying back with one arm flung across his eyes. “We’re not the first, nor will we be the last, Watson.”
“Oh, now, it’s not so bad. I’ll pick you up from school Wednesday. I promise you won’t even miss me. But here. Hug, please.” His knee creaked and groaned as he set it on the foamy surface of the play area, and Rosie leaned into his arms. He squeezed her extra hard. “I’ll miss you every second.”
“You had a wife,” Sherlock said. “S’not as if you didn’t try. And I was.” He grimaced. “Married to my work. Because of--what?
He ate breakfast mindlessly while checking scores and stats around the league, assessing the impact of the previous night’s games upon the Brawlers’ standing. They were tied for fourth in their division—not a hopeless spot as February approached, but certainly not where they’d hoped to be. A concussed second-line center from the Milwaukee team meant suddenly the Brawlers needed to keep eyes on the St Paul Grizzlies, while their recent championship opponents, the Shoreham Shock, were showing signs of loose wheels about to come off. As Sherlock poured a third cup of coffee, he pondered these latest shake-ups and watched a few videos of the Kansas City team Boston would face the next night, seeking weaknesses for his teammates to exploit.
“I can imagine.”
Moments later he was out the door, no formalities, no promises, no kiss goodbye. It was fine. A shift of his shirt cuff covered a red mark that nearly encircled his wrist. In the car, urging the driver to do what he could to avoid traffic and just get him there as fast as possible, he scrolled the past few days’ texts with John, triple checking he did not sound preoccupied, distant, or lost. He still wasn’t sure he hadn’t, though he wanted to believe it was all fine. Nearly a week since he’d seen him, over a week until he would again. He should have told Steven to lose his number. His face tingling to numbness. Reminding himself everything was as it should be, even—or sometimes especially—when everything felt wildly out of alignment.
JW: You forgot that, did you.
Sherlock sighed, laughing at himself being caught out in his attempt at denial. John paused the film and looked at him, lifting his eyebrows in expectation of a respons. Generously, he offered, “I have nothing until ten; thought we could have breakfast somewhere.”
,” John prodded.
He so intensely wanted to be plain about it, call it what it was: bullshit. But the venue did not seem appropriate for cursing.
Sherlock said it matter-of-factly, guarding his own emotions, whatever they were at the time, whatever they had become. He wasn’t sure of the names, didn’t trust the sensations they inspired.
“Not immediately, but better safe than sorry. You there, who’s the emergency warden?”
“You’re tired, John.”
Sherlock smiled in the dark, and maneuvered John’s hand between their two chests, cradled between Sherlock’s own hands, to hold him fast the whole night through.
“It’s not
They were walking from the tube station to the flat; the air held a warm tinge of spring and lifted John’s mood higher than it had been in recent memory.
“No, while she was your mother, she was a sheep. A wolf pretending to be a sheep. It’s a metaphor.”
“We’ll look for it. I like that name—Butternut. It’s a yellow one?”
John’s voice lowered, growly and hot. “Talk about rubbing off on you.”
“If you smoke cigarettes, I’ll divorce you,” Rosie said automatically. Sherlock regretted that he and John had ever so freely shared that particular running joke in her presence.
He made it to his door, told her, “Sorry, Mrs Hudson. I’m feeling pretty poorly,” and then hurried past them both to the bath.
Sherlock hummed. He shuffled sideways between the gurney and the wall to slide his fingertips through her hair, which she must have loosened from what he’d told himself was a pretty good Dutch plait when he’d woven it that morning.
“Not sure. He didn’t mention anyone else, but it could be a team thing.”
His thoughts drifted, babies and children, fad toys with their own internet web-series, Rosie pretending to have a YouTube channel the modern version of kids pretending to be on the telly, the movie he’d half-watched a few nights prior then forgot about—mental note to get back to it.
A "bye week" is a week off during the season (part of the players' union collective bargaining agreement), usually in late January or early- to mid-February.
John looked pleased; he’d booked them an island holiday during the Brawlers’ bye week shortly after they’d seen such a place in a television program about exotic travel. There’d be white sand and blue sea only steps from their elegantly-appointed room, with privacy enough for trysts in waist-deep water. John talked of paragliding and guided hikes, but Sherlock wished only to burrow together under soft sheets, to eat unusual fruits soaked in local rum, to sleep at their leisure. To let go of every thought in his head and sink into spoiling pleasure.
John looked surprised, then grateful, to have been asked so pointedly about his potentially mixed feelings, rather than accepting yet more congratulations and thanks. Doubtless he’d deserved to be celebrated and honoured, and had been for the better part of the previous eight hours, by innumerable former teammates, coaches, and less intimate colleagues—not to mention the deafening, appreciative roar of the fans—but Sherlock well knew John’s transition away from playing hockey was still in its early stages. John was very much feeling his way through it, and not every day was it easy for him to find his way. Particularly since the season had started, Sherlock could see him struggling sometimes, despite being busy with other, newer things. John had spent his entire adult life in the routines, trials, and triumphs of a hockey player.
