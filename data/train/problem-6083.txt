Tony peered at her. “I think something big is happening,” he said, “Something that all the universes are experiencing, regardless of the rules in the universe. Something happened in that battle that brought the Avengers together. Someone got in my mind. Someone bad, who wanted to rule the world, remake it in his own image. I think, if he gains enough power, he can conquer not just one world, but all of them. I think things are only going to get worse before they get better.”
Clint winked at her. “I’m pretty sure he’s too in love with you to leave, no matter what he might disagree with. And if he does, you’ve got me as backup.”
Tony was downstairs mixing the pancake better when Steve grabbed his keys from the kitchen counter, Bucky holding on to his leg as he walked. "I gotta go to work, buddy," he said.
Matt took her and in his and laced their fingers. “I’m sorry, too. Do you think we can both try to be better people and communicate with each other more?”
“I’m in the wrong world. I don’t know where this is, but in my world you’re not my daughter, you’re my colleague. And I’m Iron Man, and I’m dating Pepper, and this is all wrong. How the fuck did I get here?”
Neither younger or older Natasha had ever seen Clint look so hurt and shocked at Natasha’s words. “I’m sorry,” she said quietly, “but I’m just trying to see things from both sides. Even if he was mind controlled, what Loki did to you doesn’t get erased or make it easier to forgive him. But you have to be open to the possibility that that’s really what happened.”
“It was mostly S.H.I.E.L.D.’s doing. You and Barton were working as agents, Banner and I got roped into being consultants, and Thor showed up because his brother was literally trying to rule Earth. We’ve been kind of stuck together ever since.”
“You know, when you met Daddy, you hadn’t ever had a nuclear family situation, either. I don’t know what it was like for you, but Grandpa Howard wasn’t a nice guy. Not that I would know, because he died before I was born, but I can hear you guys talking sometimes. About how scared you were to be parents, because you thought you’d turn out just like them. How you were convinced you all were going to screw me and Bucky up. But you got past that fear, and hey, I think you guys did a good job.”
Tony looked at him. "Steve, superheroes don't exist in my world. You weren't born in the 20s. There was no reason for Project Rebirth to exist or you to have been a part of it."
When everyone was cleared from medical, they made the trek back to the base the younger Natasha was staying at. She hugged them all long and fiercely as they stumbled in through the door, and then yelled at them to all go to sleep, that she would talk to them all later about what happened. None of them left their bed for a day straight. When they finally emerged from the depths of their bedroom, Tony took them back to Avengers tower, where they all placed their infinity stones in a neat little row on a table in Tony’s lab and let him deal with destroying them.
he was wrong sometimes, and he knew he wasn’t on some moral high ground like Tony thought. But Steve wasn’t doing anything to show Tony he wasn’t like that, either. Both of them had a perceived notion of the other, and both of them weren’t doing anything to discourage that notion. They could both be better people.
Natasha turned around to face Clint, giving him the most confident smile she could muster up. “Why, thank you, Mr Barton. You ready for tonight?”
Jane thought it was best to let his mind work itself out. "Right," she said. "It felt real because it
Back at the Avengers tower, the heroes were waiting for Thor to come back with the three stones and were running tests on the stone inside Vision’s head. Tony didn’t have the capacity to remove the stone without breaking Vision, but the more Wanda studied the stone with her magic, and studied the way that Vision processed information, she thought she had formed a successful way to remove it without taking Vision permanently offline. Vision was a self-learning synthezoid, meaning he had data inputted, but from there he could learn independently and form his own personality and further his knowledge. Vision had learned enough in his creation that he could be separated from the stone and it wouldn’t have made much a difference in what he knew and how he processed information.
“Not that long ago I didn’t have any friends apart from Clint. It was just us; he was the only person I let past my defences besides my parents. And I was really sad, and really lonely, and I spent my time playing video games instead of exploring the world. And my dads sat me down, and we had a heart to heart, and the other you said the same thing to me. And now I have Clint, and I have my other friends, and I have my boyfriend. And all of us are a little weird and a little broken, but we’re kindred spirits. We get each other in a way that’s comforting. And we don’t always have to like each other or the decisions we make, but at the end of the day we’re always there for each other. And now I don’t know what I’d do without them. You deserve a chance to find that for yourself, Tony. Everyone deserves people they can be real with. And I don’t think the Avengers would be here if they didn’t want the same thing.”
Vision didn’t much care for fighting the humans’ war. After all, he wasn’t really human. He was just a synthezoid, creating from a mix of J.A.R.V.I.S.’ consciousness and Ultron’s metal manipulation. His only stake in the war was Wanda. It was…strange. But Vision felt something different for her than the rest of the humans. He couldn’t really put a place on it. All of is supplemental research told him it was romantic feelings, but he didn’t honestly know the different between platonic and romantic relationships, or how to navigate them. He tried to explain that to Wanda last night, and she had simply smiled at him, taken his cold metal hand in hers, and told him she would teach him. He was fighting for her, and the other Avengers who had taken him in and taught him kindness. No, this war wasn’t his, but he would fight it nonetheless. For her. And for the possible future with her.
“Right. You know that dude is a tough nut to crack, right? I mean, he’s disgustingly loyal to Fisk. I’m not exactly sure how you’re gonna get him to confess any information, but I guess if anyone can do it, you can.”
The thing is, Tony had kind of gotten to know Loki in the few months Natasha had worked there. He had never bought into the “magic” the magic shop claimed to help with, but the store had good business and Loki treated Natasha fairly. He was nice, respectful, and had maybe been a little bit broken. From what he knew from all their conversations, Loki had been abandoned at birth and placed into the foster care system. When he was a kid, he was placed with the Odinson family, and remained in their foster home until he aged out of the system. He hadn’t gotten a long too well with his foster father, but his foster mother was nice and his jock foster brother hadn’t been too bad. As far as Tony could tell, he had just been a kid that felt a little lost. Nothing seemed off or too unassuming about him.
“What was that other world like? Your dad said we were all superheroes, but didn’t tell me really anything else other than they fought to save the world.”
Steve turned to look in the direction of Wanda and Vision. They were seemingly wrapped up in their own little world, whispering together, hands clasped tightly, unaware of what anyone else in the room was doing. He missed that. He wondered if he’d ever have that again. He swallowed the lump in his throat.
By mid-afternoon Thor retired back to his chambers and was surprised to discover Loki on his bed, thumbing through some of Thor’s old Asgardian textbooks he had taken off his shelf.
While Natasha was relieved Bruce might have a happy ending in some alternate universe, Steve was lesser than pleased.
Natasha slept fitfully that night. When she woke up the next day, the sun was shining through her curtains. She checked her cell phone, which had been horrifyingly dead when she got home to it last night. She had plugged it in for power and was assaulted with a bunch of calls and texts from her friends. She sent a few texts to Matt, Clint, Karen, and Foggy, and waited for them to respond back as she descended the stairs towards the kitchen.
"Yeah, but we call him Bucky. Apparently in this world he was Steve's best friend and not his son, so that's weird."
She learned things about Steve, too. How his father had been in the war, came back with PTSD. That he had violent outbursts, and Steve would get caught in the middle of it, trying to protect his mother. When he realised what he was doing and how he was hurting his family, he killed himself. Took a shotgun to his mouth. Steve had found the body and decided he didn't want his life to end up like his father's.
Natasha’s mind was blank as she prepared for the war with Thanos. Her senses were heightened, sharpened, and her body was poised for deadly action. She had everything she needed to succeed on her part in this war. She would not pray. She would not worry. She would block everything out, and fight like her life depended on it.
“If it were Wanda, I would want to go back for her. We cannot leave anyone behind. I say yes,” Vision said.
“I don’t fucking care if the dude was hung by his toenails for a century. He doesn’t deserve to be the ruler of Asgard, not after everything he did.”
It was late when he snuck back into this foster parents’ home. He crawled into bed after taking off his bracers and placing his bow beside his bed. He scrolled through the contacts on his phone until he got to Pietro, pressing the call button before he could chicken and back out.
Steve peered back at Tony as they kept flying higher and higher, away from the scene below them. He couldn’t read Tony’s expression with the face plate in the way. “Uh, Tony?” he asked. “What are you doing?”
“Listen, my dad’s gonna hire a lawyer. I found out Pierce isn’t who we thought he was. He’s not one of the good guys.”
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
The second his fingers touched the stone, he was transported somewhere else. A world, or a void in between worlds, made of just infinite blackness as far as Tony’s eyes could see. He scanned around nervously, before his eyes saw a figure slowly walking towards him in the distance.
“And what about us? What if wielding these powers makes us all power hungry? What if we don’t want to give up the stones after Thanos is defeated? Then what?”
Steve swallowed, and backed away from the door, now feeling more like he was trespassing on a super intimate moment than spying to hear what Tony was saying about him. He grabbed his water cup from the counter in the communal kitchen and rode the elevator to his floor.
Before heading out, Steve heard Tony address FRIDAY. “Hey FRIDAY, can you patch to the Avengers mansion and make sure Ms Stark-Rogers is on the line?”
Steve chuckled. "That's funny. Me with super strength? I don't think I'll ever be super strong. Still little old Steven Rogers, the skinny asthmatic kid you somehow happened to fall in love with."
Steve looked at the kitchen table he was sitting at, looked around the kitchen itself. There were a child’s drawings on the fridge and a tonne of pictures of a family, a family he wasn’t a part of. And yet, he was. As he looked at it, he saw it was a photo of him, Tony, Natasha, and Bucky. He swallowed, because seeing this here, seeing how
Jane smiled. "You do that here, too. Stark Industries is the biggest name in clean energy. In addition to that, you also sell a bunch of electronics that won't kill our environment. You're bigger than Apple."
He also didn’t like the fact that he and Steve weren’t together in this world. Steve himself said he wasn’t gay, which meant they weren’t married in that world.
"What? No, Daddy. He'd kill himself before he did drugs. God, he's so squeaky clean you'd be impressed I managed to find someone who's not an asshole, despite everything."
Loki held the stone out and Thor took it, pocketing it. “If you wish to join me on my search for the stones, you are welcome to,” he said, genuinely meaning.
Loki shut the textbook and placed it on Thor’s bed beside him. “I only joined Thanos for survival,” he said quietly. “I did not think anyone could stop him if he got his hands on all the stones. I did not have faith that any Earthly heroes could rise to the occasion. As such, I did not want to die. So I allied myself with the group I thought would win the war.”
Natasha’s friends weren’t exactly well off. I mean, they weren’t called the social outcasts for nothing. None of them had good lives. She figured if they took this job, their futures were all guaranteed. Then no one would have to worry about money. Plus, she was into to the whole super spy thing. She was good at it. Alexander Pierce told her so.
And yet...until they could figure out how to get him back to his own universe, he was doomed. He wondered if he should just come clean to the rest of the Avengers. Jane and Thor knew the situation and if they updated the rest of the group on the science or magic or whatever brought him here, then they would have to believe him. And then he wouldn't feel the pressure to be someone he wasn't.
“No,” she said. “Absolutely not. If I’m alive, there’s a greater risk of you all not capturing Thanos.”
Everything was so upside down and he wished for normal now more than ever before. He wanted to go back to his two normal kids and his normal husband who grew up living with his cousin Peggy and where Jarvis wasn't an artificial intelligence and he didn't have an arc reactor keeping shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him and he sold solar powered technology and didn't fly around in a metal suit for a living. He wasn't a fan of comics books in real life and really didn't want to live in one.
“Steve needed my energy to get back here. And you all needed to know about Thanos. I took a risk. I said goodbye to Dad, so at least he knows where I am, and he trusts that I’m safe with all of you.”
“I followed you one day. Or, the other Tony followed you and I have his memories. Or…I don’t know. This multiverse travelling is too confusing. Point is, I overheard you talking about it, and while you were gone there was a big thing on the news that Fisk and his assistant Wesley were missing.”

Tony shrugged. “Does anyone know if the dude has any weaknesses we can use against him? Like, how strong he is? Weak points? What the stone he has does so we can prepare for that little piece of magic?”
“Great. Now that they’re gone, how close are you on getting that stone out of Vision’s head?” Tony asked, addressing Wanda.
“Look, Nat, I know I’m not your dad. But I like you in my universe, and I like this version of you. And I like that some version of me gets to be happy and settle down and not be a total fuckup 24/7. So if I can save the whole universe and all of its realities from whoever it is that wants to take over, I’m gonna do it. Okay?”
Everything was playing out like a movie as Clint waited with bated breath, feeling like he was outside himself. He didn’t feel like it was him, hiding with an arrow poised at the man with the gun. He didn’t feel like it was him who let the arrow fly straight into Wesley’s chest as he pointed the gun at Natasha’s temple. He didn’t feel like it was him as he watched Natasha struggle to get the gun out of Wesley’s hands, watched as the gun went off, fired into Wesley’s throat, watched as his lifeless body slid to the floor of the abandoned warehouse.
? Thor felt bile rise in his throat at the thought. He would have to seek council with his father after the war with Thanos and demand some answers for himself.
He led Steve to the garage and unlocked the doors to his 2010 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S and he drove in silence to Loki’s magic shop, a place he’d been dozens of times to drop in and just say hi to Natasha while she was working.
“I know so. I’ve seen the way he acts with you. He’s head over heels for you. If he wants to make it work, he will. Give him some time.”
“Oh gee, I don’t know, your own self-loathing? Maybe Steve doesn’t really hate all your decisions. Maybe you’re just always on the defence about things and pick a fight with him as a way to protect yourself. Instead of having him agree with you, you just assume he’s going to disagree with you and you fight a battle with him when in all reality it would probably be solved between you two easily.”
“Coming alone against all of us, are you?” Tony taunted, displaying a bravado he definitely did not feel inside.
To his surprise, the comms link was still working from their place in space. He didn’t think something like that could reach this far, but apparently Tony was a genius and knew how to make his tech functional.
I intended to post this sooner, but I watched Avengers: Endgame and never fully recovered, so there's that. I hope you all enjoyed the movie and if you haven't seen it, you're living your best spoiler free life.
Natasha rolled her eyes. "No, Daddy, not with Matt. Why do you guys always think I'm talking to him? I have other friends too, you know."
And he told everyone! This was what he was worried about! This was why he built Ultron! He was trying to save the world from that thing that had been inside his mind—that thing that was probably inside Loki’s mind as well, using him as a pawn. The poor bastard hadn’t been the Big Bad they defeated. That thing was still out there, waiting. Tony fucking
Clint made his descent down from his perch, being fast but cautious as he came down. When his feet touched the soil, he raced over to the rest of the Avengers. He passed Natasha’s body on the way over, and fought with himself not to glance over at her ruined form. He pressed down the urge to vomit at the thought of his best friend, just discarded on the ground, her chest ripped open, exposing her inner workings. But he had a mission, and he would grieve for her later.
“Honestly, no. I didn’t need you for this part. I needed Steve. And he’s doing this job wonderfully, but, ugh, shit.” Tony stopped taking for a second and he settled down on Thanos’s arm. He failed to calculate that Steve attacking Thanos meant that Thanos was going to move around a lot. That made Tony’s job of severing his hand even harder. If he couldn’t get a clean cut, then their mission wasn’t going to be accomplished.
He watched Natasha put on a seductive smile, and saunter over towards Wesley’s line of sight, and work her magic. Clint felt a bit like he was intruding on the moment, watching Natasha and Wesley interact. To make up for the lack of hearing, he’d become adept at reading lips, and could definitely understand everything Natasha was saying, even if he couldn’t see Wesley’s responses. It seemed like too personal of a conversation for him to encroach on, but he needed his eyes on Natasha. The boys had it handled with Fisk; Frank was looking out for Wade. Not that either of them thought Wade or Natasha needed backup, but it was better for them to be safer than sorry. Plus, Mr Pierce was watching all of them to be new recruits for S.H.I.E.L.D., and Clint was going to age out of the system soon, and he would be without his foster family or any money for a serious career, and this was his chance to do some good in the world, and not become his older brother.
Any bravado Loki had had disappeared at the mention of the Titan’s name, leaving Loki pale and nervous. “Where did you hear that name?” he hissed, grabbing Thor by his red cape and pulling him into his chambers. He closed and locked the door behind him.
“I need to think,” Matt said. He grabbed his cane and walked out of the warehouse. Tony slunk more into the shadows, his brain trying to wrap around the information he’d received.
“Okay,” Tony said. He was trying not to break down. It was the most emotion Steve had ever seen from him. “You figured out what was making us switch through universes?”
Tony groaned and looked at the clock on his bedside table. It was 7am Thursday morning. He had to make sure his kids ate their breakfast before he dropped Nat off at her high school and drove Bucky to pre-k for a few hours. "Okay, kiddo," he said. "Why don't you go get dressed and I'll make you pancakes before school?"
Natasha and Steve plopped into the other universe, right back into Tony’s lab where it had all started. Immediately Natasha keeled over and threw up on the floor, prompting Tony’s robot DUM-E to come and clean it up. She sat down in a lab chair, clutching her stomach and waiting for it to settle down.
Thor shook his head. “My father no longer runs Asgard. He has surrendered all control to Loki. Willingly.”
Tony snorted. “Yeah, well, it gets even more fucked up when you hear it was my father Howard that worked on the project that made Steve into a living sculpture.”
“That is a good point, Steve Rogers,” Vision said. He frowned for a moment and concentrated, seemingly perusing the database of information. “I don’t see how there could be any lasting consequences, based on the data I have collected. Presumably destroying a stone will just erase its power, never giving a single person the power to control the universe. Nothing less, nothing more.”
“We’re gonna call Pierce, and he’s going to take care of this, okay? And then we’re gonna go home and act like nothing’s wrong, because we can’t afford to freak out anymore, okay?”

So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
“I have the mind stone,” Vision said. “It is the stone from Loki’s sceptre that he used to mind control everyone when attempting to take over Earth.”
Tony got up from his chair and clapped his best friend on the back before leaving the lab and heading upstairs to find out what his girlfriend wanted from him.
Tony nodded. “I’m gonna hire a lawyer. We’ll deal with it. But you have to promise me you won’t get yourself mixed up in this kind of stuff again. I understand you want a career dealing with government facilities, but you’re going to do it the legal way. You’re gonna go to college, and apply for a government program and go through recruitment that way. And I am going to fully vet any government agency that tries to sink its claws into you. Got it?”
"That's good. No, that's useful. Hey, Steve wants to have you over for dinner sometime. And I'm sure our kids would love to hang out with their cool aunt sometime soon, so let us know if you wanna stop by sometime. You know, when you're not busy. Running my company."
needed a drink. “Yeah, I wouldn’t know the first thing about how to discipline a fucking teenaged girl. Right, so back on Steve. What does he do?”
Steve thought that meant that Natasha would see everything Tony saw through his helmet. He didn’t know what HUD meant exactly, but that’s the gist of what he understood when Tony tried explaining it to him.
Tony snorted. "Yeah, I don't think any of us did. Makes you wonder if there's some version of us out there living a less crazy life. With like, world peace. No aliens invading. No people with superpowers. Nothing. Just a simple existence. You think a world like that exists?"
“Okay, so what does this Thanos want, exactly?” Wanda interjected. “What are these infinity stones?”
Something in Steve clicked and seemed to register there was someone else in the room besides Peggy and turned to assess Natasha. “Oh. Hi,” he said, holding out a hand for her to shake.
The Avengers spent the next hour or so talking to Jane and Thor and running through different theories and solutions until they were all talked out. They decided to order some Chinese food and watch some movies they deemed as classic, getting in some team bonding and helping Steve acclimate more to the 21st century all in one go. They fell asleep there together on the couch, momentarily free of worry and their minds away from the Tony Stark situation.
Natasha laughed weakly. “Yeah, I really made a mess of things. I really gotta clean that up when I get home.” She sighed heavily. “You’re really gonna keep the stone and come visit me?”
Matt shrugged. “When you shut down Fisk, there wasn’t anyone else willing to take over his drug runs. Karen couldn’t pretend like she wasn’t an addict anymore, and realised she needed help. The situation with her parents still isn’t a good one, but Foggy’s family agreed to let her live with them until the foreseeable future.”
“I don’t care how much time you’ve had with that stone, we’ll still manage to beat you,” Wanda sneered at him. Thanos detecting the slightest of an Eastern European accent in her voice. Interesting.
Natasha had been dead on about Steve being arrogant and stubborn when he was mad. If Steve realised he was wrong about something, he still insisted he was right, because he didn’t want to wound his own pride. Steve knew he had key things to work on with himself, and maybe he was taking a lot of things out on Tony by not being a bigger person, by not admitting his own faults. Steve
Thor broke into a grin as he took in the familiar sight of Heimdall at his post in Asgard. He clasped hands with the all-seeing man in lieu of a greeting.
“I don’t…” Tony wet his lips and swallowed. “Natasha, you’re not making any sense. Why are you so young? Where am I? Where are my suits? Where’s FRIDAY? Where’s Pepper?”
Natasha looked down at her shoes, too ashamed to meet Tony’s eyes. “We had a mission last night,” she whispered. “I was just supposed to get some intel from this guy named Wesley, who works for Wilson Fisk. Things went a little south, my cover was blown, and…there was a power struggle with a gun.”
“But what if they don’t, Tony? I mean, aren’t you lonely? You’ve kept yourself separate from the world for your whole life. You’ve never completely opened up to anyone before. So you say Rhodey loves you for who you are, but he’s gone in the Air Force all the time and isn’t always there when you need him. You have Pepper, but she’s your girlfriend, not a platonic friend. Don’t you want friends? Don’t you want those people who are always going to have your back? A support system?”
“Um…Clint? How do we ask someone who’s dead?” Steve asked. He sounded apologetic for even mentioning Natasha was dead.
“No. I don’t.” Clint crossed his arms over his chest. “You know what? Fuck you all,” he said, storming off.
Natasha didn’t go home to her own world immediately after the battle with Thanos was over. She and the others took about a week to decompress from the fight and to heal their injuries and psyches. Natasha hadn’t had a huge role in the defeating the Titan—Tony had stayed firm on her not being able to fight—but she was on their comms system the entire time, and FRIDAY had been showing her the footage from inside Tony’s Iron Man helmet, so it was basically like she was in the field with them. She wished she could have done more, but she was also glad Tony wanted her safe enough to be able to go home to her own dads.
Loki nodded his head, still thumbing through the textbooks. “Do you really think the Avengers can beat Thanos?”
But it didn’t. Wanda kept control of Thanos enough for Tony to get the hand off. Thor used Mjolnir to shatter the gauntlet and the power gem. Clint found himself sliding down from his perch and grabbing Vision as he hurled them into space, just like last time.
“Dad?” she said, eyes red and puffy from crying, her hands shaking at her sides. “I fucked up, and I don’t know what to do. I thought I could handle it on my own, and I can’t…I need your help, Dad, please.”
Foggy picked him up around 8:45 and as soon as she watched them drive away and shut the door her fathers were sitting on the kitchen counter, waiting for her.
Natasha clenched her jaw. “Then leave. I’m not changing my mission. I can’t fight with the law like you and Foggy, Matt. That’s not the way I work. I was trained to be an assassin. I’m a spy. It’s what I do. And it’s who I’m always going to be. I’m not going to change.”
“You’re fucking kidding me. He’s a five year old kid. Who the hell runs over little five year old innocent, adorable kids?”
"So you're telling me Steve and Tony are actually married in some other world where none of us are superheroes?" Clint asked. "This is like the perfect plot for a fanfiction. I wonder if anyone's ever thought of his before."
“Because I’m good at what I do, Matt. I’ve been training for this. I can do this. I can be whatever he needs me to be. I can still infiltrate. Trust me. Let me interrogate Wesley tonight while they confront Fisk.”
“I’d like to pop in and visit you from time to time, see how you’re doing. Promise you’re gonna do good things from now on, like
Steve nodded. “So let’s do this.” He held up his shield, bracing himself as Tony started to fly them back down at an alarming speed. Then he just launched Steve at Thanos, his shield hitting the alien square in his face. Steve kicked his feet straight into Thanos’s chest as he did so, earning a small grunt from him. Steve went into a frenzy then, not stopping to think about anything other than the task at hand. He wrapped his legs tightly around Thanos’s torso as he bucked and tried to fling Steve off of him. He held steadfast though, and kept bringing his shield down on Thanos’s face over and over again, letting go of the rage and directing it towards taking down their enemy.
Clint shrugged. “Does it look like he and Crystal are breaking up anytime soon? My crush is useless.”
Steve nodded. “You’re not alone in my world, Tony. You’ve got a great group of friends who have your back. If you’re worried you’re like your father, you’re nothing like him. Trust me.”
Natasha sighed, defeated. "Fine. I'll ask him at school today. But please be nice. And for the love of God, please don't stare too much."
“Tasha!” he yelled and hobbled over to her as fast as he could. His balance was off and it looked like he couldn’t control his movements as much as he used to be able to. Natasha’s throat felt thick as her tears threatened to spill again.
Of course he had been worried! If Tony had looked like he was dead...why wouldn't his husband be relieved that he was okay? That brought a drunken smile to Tony's lips. His husband was so adorable when he was worried about him.
Tony nodded. “Time didn’t pass here, but I was in some kind of void. This Thanos guy is trying to get all the stones so he can murder half the multiverse population.”
“Yes, it is,” Natasha said. “It started glowing. I don’t think you have enough energy to harness it. What if…what if I help you?”
Thanos flexed the gauntlet, showing off the one stone, nestled neatly into its space where it was supposed to be. “Of course I do.”
He headed off towards the elevator doors but Steve deftly blocked his path before he could reach them. “Now, wait just a minute,” he said. “Taking the stone away from Vision will kill him.”
Tony nodded. “Okay. I hear ya. So let’s leave it up to a vote. All of us have a chance to turn the tides. Are you yea or nay on using the stones to defeat Thanos? Vision?”
The secret was out. Now they knew. And none of them could go back to pretending they didn't know what was going on now. He didn't know if they thought he was crazy and they were planning like a rehab intervention or something for him, or if they had actually spoken to Jane and believed the totally and frankly absurd notion that he was from another world. If it hadn't happened to him, he wouldn't have believed himself either. And yet, here he was.
Russian for "shell head." That's Tony's nickname in the comics when he's in the Iron Man costume. She also called him shell head in Age of Ultron.
“No, they banished me from the hospital. I’ve been a wreck since it happened and I haven’t left his side or slept in three days and they all told me I had to go home and shower and get just a couple hours of sleep. But Pepper, I can’t get ahold of Steve and it’s freaking me out and my kid’s in the fucking hospital, I don’t know how they can expect me to just sleep!”
“They don’t need to know you’re helping. All you have to do is tell me where you hid the stone on Jotunheim.”
Matt laughed. "Go spend time with your friend. Pietro and I were having a good discussion yesterday we didn't get to finish."
Natasha drummed her fingers on her thigh for a moment before squinting and asking Tony, “Where is Bruce?”
“No, you won’t, Nat. I’m not going to sit around and listen to you all get murdered. Wesley is not going to sit back and let you all intimidate him into going after Fisk. It’s not going to happen.”
Tony nodded. "We made a deal we wouldn't drink in front of them. I'm not Howard. I don't want them to see me like this. They're not home, are they? James is so young and he won't understand, just like I didn't understand when I was five and my father hit me for the first time."
“With something called an Infinity Gauntlet. It’s a gauntlet made of pure gold that’s held in the weapons room in Asgard, supposedly. The Allfather, Odin, owns the gauntlet and keeps it hidden away so no one will be tempted to use it for ill will. Once you insert all the gems into the gauntlet, you’ll have unfettered power at your fingertips. But like I said, this is just a story I grew up with. I don’t actually believe in the mythology behind it.”
"She's my best friend. We met when she was studying business at Harvard and we've been close ever since. She works for me and my company, and she married and divorced my head of security, Happy."
"Really?" Bucky asked, eyes still wide, a huge grin on his small face. "Okay!" He bounced back off the bed and ran to his room next door. Tony and Steve, now alone, kissed each other softly before both sliding out of bed and getting ready for the day.
“I don’t know a Bruce, but I know Jane and Thor. Thor is Loki’s older brother, and he’s married to Jane.”
“There are six stones of power,” Thor told her, “that give you the power to control the multiverse.”
“Thor,” Jane chided. “His mind’s not in this world. He’s somewhere else. I think, based on his brain waves, he’s in another consciousness. One where he’s married to Steve. Leave him alone.”
Steve fell asleep that night coming up with mock scenarios of him and Tony talking through their issues.
Still, she was strong enough to keep him mostly still, and that was enough for Tony to cleanly cut off Thanos’s hand, gauntlet and all. If Thanos had had control of his mind, Clint was sure he would have been screaming in pain. He hoped it really fucking hurt.
Natasha watched the footage nervously from the compound, fidgeting in her seat. “Maybe it’s time you guys use the stones,” she said nervously. “Make him think he’s lost the infinity gauntlet, or transport him through time or to another part of space, or something.”
Natasha squeezed his hand. "You will. You want to keep the cane with you or do you want to keep it up here?"
“Among other things…that I’m pretty sure are way too grown up for you to hear. What are you, like 15?”
Thanos was still laughing. “No one can stop me,” he said. “Not even your Avengers. Good luck, son of Earth. In the end, you will be defeated. I truly hope you survive the culling.”
Thor nodded, knowing their conversation was over. Tomorrow he would receive the stone from Loki, and then he would be off to Knowhere and Xandar to retrieve the other two.
“Maybe she did,” he mused. “Well, your dad and Bucky are in the activities room if you want to go say hi to them.”
They sat there on the couch for a while, the Tony from a different world holding the younger Natasha as she fell asleep. When she would wake up the next morning, with a crick in her neck, Tony would be gone, just a figment of her imagination. But for now, they were together again, in one universe, under one roof, and all was right in the world.
“It’s in case anything goes wrong,” Tony said. “It’s better to have the neurons downloaded onto my network so that when we are finished with Thanos, we know we can easily remove the stone and keep Vision in one piece.”
“He used Loki to try and take over Earth so he could search for the stones,” Steve also informed them.
universe where he didn’t have FRIDAY or any of his Iron Man suits? How was he going to shield the universe from this kind of shit?
“Why, for power, of course,” Thanos said, like it was the most obvious answer in all of the multiverse.
Clint fell asleep that night listening to Pietro’s voice on the other line, grateful to have a friend like him.
This Tony definitely sounded hurt, though. His voice was cracking, like it physically hurt him to get the words out.
Natasha stared at him for a moment, her head cocked to the side. "Tony, are you feeling all right?" she asked.
Far as Steve could tell, it was just a bunch of crystals and herbs and stuff. Things that were supposed to aid in magic and healing and spells. He wasn’t sure how much they were supposed to work. The only people he knew with magic had their powers naturally, not with the aid of these things.
“We want to bring you back!” he blurted out. “Steve wants to use the time stone to go back before Thanos kills you.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but didn’t comment. He grabbed the yellow stone off the lab table and shut his eyes, focusing all his energy on finding Thanos. Then Tony’s perception seemed to shift and the world once more fell away from him as he found himself in a pitch black, seemingly endless void. Just like last time.
“I’m so sorry, Tasha. That’s so not okay.” Tony took the young girl in his arms and held on tight to her. She fit perfectly against him, his chin coming to rest on the top of her head. She inhaled the scent of this Tony, revelling in the fact he smelled and felt just like her dad did. She wondered if she could ever get back to her universe after this ended, and if she couldn’t, what that meant for her relationship with this world’s Steve and Tony.
She settled her head back on Matt’s shoulder and they spent the rest of the time in silence, small touches of comfort and familiarity between the two.
“Hello,” Loki said, in his post British accent. Steve always wondered how he sounded British when he was from Asgard. “What brings you all in? Natasha isn’t scheduled to work today.”
"Jeez, Tony, maybe you need some lessons in anger management from the Hulk," his best friend, James Rhodes, said.
"Does it have to do with Matt? Some reason why he's never around? Why you don't want us to meet him? He's not secretly a drug addict, is he?"
Tony drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and sighed, finally breaking the silence. “So,” he said, “you’re not gay.”
“Do you know where these stones are located? We are afraid a Titan named Thanos is planning to wield them for evil purposes.”
"Right," Clint said, not knowing how else to respond. "So what else is different? Please don't tell me you live in California full time, because gross."
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
“Yeah, that’s what his father thought. I talk to Karen, you know. She found out Fisk bludgeoned his father to death when he was 12 years old. What makes you think he’d hesitate to do the same to you?”
Natasha's fork clanked against the plate as she put it down, looking up at him. "I guess," she said. "As much as I can be friends with anyone."
“Brother,” he said, simply, and the illusion melted and Loki shifted into his Asgardian form, complete with a sly smirk Thor had become accustomed to.
“But it’ll get you back where you need to go! You need to warn the Avengers of what’s coming. You have to defeat Thanos. If that means I have to get transported into another world, then I’ll accept that. This means more than that.”
Just as he was beginning to panic, the fire licking his feet, choking on the acrid smell of flesh burning from the bodies beneath him, he heard his name being called. "Tony?" the voice said. It was familiar, like someone he was supposed to know, but didn't. "Tony?" it called again. A man's voice. "TONY!" it yelled, and he was gasping, awake, but unclear where he was.
. I was chained to three rocks, unable to look away from the entrails of my dead son. Skadi placed a snake on top of my head and laughed as its venom dripped onto my face. I received this torture every day for months with little reprise.”
Thor knocked on the door and waited for Loki to open the door for him. The door opened and Thor blinked, the face of his father glaring back at him. So Loki had shapeshifted into the guise of their father. He always was clever.
Tony closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, breathing heavily. “Right,” he muttered. “From the universe with the superhero Tony?”
It was a few days later and Steve hadn’t exactly gotten the courage to discuss his friendship failings with Tony, but he had taken time to be more understanding of the genius, the situation they were in, and actually heard him and his theories out instead of jumping to conclusions and automatically opposing everything. Sometimes it was hard to Steve to bite his tongue and not comment on some of Tony’s less than savoury things he had to say—what could Steve say, something about Tony’s personality still rubbed him the wrong way. He chalked it up to growing up in a different time period than the other man—but all in all it was necessary they at least try to get along if they were all going to work together to defeat Thanos.
"No, Man of Iron," Thor said in his booming voice, "that world is real. Even if it exists in your mind. Every world is real."
The older Natasha narrowed her eyes at Tony. “Call me Redhead again and I will decapitate you in your sleep.”
Natasha rolled her eyes and took a swig of her beer. “Somehow I don’t think the world cares about your sex life,” she quipped.
They spent the rest of the night drinking straight from the bottle, getting drunk. Natasha pretended like she didn't notice Karen's bloodshot eyes were from crying. She ignored Matt's calls for the rest of the night and snuggled into bed with her best friend, drunkenly laughing with her and making light sabre noises as they watched
Tony grimaced, and flipped open his face plate. Steve could see tear tracks on his cheeks. It seemed Tony Stark really did have a heart after all.

"I'm fine, baby," he slurred, trying to force himself upright on the couch and bring himself to open his heavy eyelids. "'M still alive."
None of those made any sense to Tony, but it nagged at his mind. Like it should matter. Like it was gospel.
Thanos blinked at the appearance of both his daughters, like he couldn’t even believe was his eyes were seeing. “Gamora,” he said back.
Thanos turned to him, that signature half amused, half condescending smile stuck on his face. “Wouldn’t want to inconvenience you,” he said, before catching Tony off guard and punching him straight in the stomach with the gauntlet just because he could. He took pleasure in watching Tony double over in pain, choking on it, blood dribbling between his lips. Thanos had not pulled his punch, and, after all, he was the keeper of the strength gem.
When Tony was done reading, he sat back and rubbed a hand across his face. There wasn't a huge amount of detail in the files, lots of details were redacted for safety, but he had still learned more about the Avengers lives than he knew beforehand. For instance, he learned that Steve's home life was basically the same...except apparently his husband wasn't his husband, he grew up in the 20s instead of the 80s, he had some super soldier serum running in his veins, he was frozen in time for 70 years, and apparently was rumoured to have had a thing with his father. That was a lot to process.
She shrugged. “I was looking for my parents. Or my past. Back in Russia. I didn’t find anything…but then the director approached us to train, basically guaranteed us a spot in S.H.I.E.L.D. once we graduated. It was too good to pass up.”
“I’m gonna fly us back down to Thanos and the others. I want you to fucking smash your shield into his ugly face and I’ll take off his hand.”
“Will do. Night.” She kissed both her dads on their cheek and dashed up to her room to study more Russian.
“Yeah, me either, really. My parents are good. Still disgustingly in love, still doing what they love. Bucky’s in a good place, too. He finished his physical therapy after the accident and when he was old enough my dad Tony made him a pretty advanced prosthetic arm that he doled out to the market not long after.”
“Maybe if he didn’t already have a stone. We don’t know which stone he has. We have the reality stone, but we don’t know which other stone does what. Maybe if we figure that out…”
Clint again climbed down from his perch and joined the rest of the Avengers on the ground. They gathered around Natasha’s body. Her skin was already taking on a sallow pallor, paler than he’d ever seen her before. He reached down and closed her dull, lifeless green eyes, not able to stand seeing them open any longer. He brushed her hair out of her face.
“Yes. I believe your brother has hidden it for safe keeping. Perhaps you should speak with him about it. He is here on Asgard, if you wish to speak with him.”
Clint groaned. “Fine. But why call in Fury? Why can’t be just send him to Asgard like he did Thor’s evil little brother?”
"Okay," Steve said. "So what else is different about our worlds? I mean, are all of our lives completely different? Our childhoods, our relationships, everything?"
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. "There's more to it than just you being 17. Even Peggy's worried about you."
This chapter is a long one. When I wrote this fanfic, I didn't split it up into chapters per se, but more like sections. That’s because I wrote this story vastly out of order,a nd this was one of the first scenes I wrote like four years ago. So as you saw, the first part was in the alternate word, and then I wrote about the MCU world, and I didn't break storylines up into specific chapters. I couldn't justify breaking this section up into more chapters, considering I wrote most of this together in a few sittings. But something tells me you all don't mind 8000+ word chapters.
Tony noticed this, concerned. “Steve, you can’t use it for anything other than defeating Thanos, do you hear me? I know you wish you could go back in time, see Peggy, maybe save Bucky, but you can’t do it. That messes with the whole space time continuum and it’s generally frowned upon in literally every science fiction thing ever.”
“Yeah, I got it. I’m sorry, Dad. This whole mess happened because I was trying to find out more about my birth parents and my life in Russia. I didn’t think I would get caught hacking into their files.”
He let go of Steve's leg sullenly while Steve picked him up and put him in the island chair. "Love you, kiddo," he said before turning to his husband. "Love you too," he said, pecking Tony's lips before heading out the door.
Fury studied him, then acquiesced. “Fine. But they don’t come into the atmosphere. We obtain the information from communication in space only.”
Clint got eyes on Natasha almost immediately. It wasn’t hard to find her in a crowd, with her flaming red hair on display. She was the most beautiful girl in this place. He often thought about if he had been straight, and if he and Natasha hadn’t started out as amazing friends, they would probably be together now. But that wasn’t a thought he could really entertain right now, not when they were in the middle of a mission.
Everything was still going fine, until Clint saw Wesley ask Natasha if she wanted to go to a more private setting. “Shit,” Clint whispered under his breath, tensing up. He saw Natasha mouth that she needed to tell her roommate not to wait up for her. Seconds later he got a text from Natasha stating she was leaving with Wesley and to follow their car. She shared her location with Clint, and he was going to use it to track her to their final destination.
“Good idea,” Steve said, while he and Natasha followed Wanda into the elevator and up to the common area.
"Dad, I said it's not like that, okay? Matt's Catholic. He wants to wait and I'm respecting his wishes."
Steve wasn’t having it, and charged at Thanos. He threw his shield at him like a frisbee, hoping to strike in a vulnerable place, but Thanos caught the shield and sent it spinning right back at Steve, who was pushed back several steps as he deftly caught it.
Thanos laughed. “Is that so, Stark? Do you really think you can stop me? I have the gauntlet needed to harness the stones of power. I have one of the stones already. You really think you can stop me?”
“Great. So these Titans have the skillset of both Eternals and Krees. That sounds like a not so good combination.”
“Look, I had a shitty childhood, Nat. Nothing I did was ever good enough for my dad. And I don’t have a single clue why he hated me so much. I tried to do everything he wanted of me. I didn’t spend my childhood like a normal child, playing, I spent it all building things, trying to be as smart as my dad was, to prove to him his company would be safe in my hands someday. And you know what that got me? Nothing. My father taught me to hate myself. To assume everyone wanted something from me. To assume no one would love me for me, that I needed to put on an act. I used drugs and alcohol and sex because that’s what people
“I just need a moment to think,” he mumbled. “FRIDAY, turn off all comms except mine, Steve’s, and baby Natasha’s.”
That was, until Wanda figured it out. “My contact got back to me on a way to safely remove the stone,” she said, flinging the email from her phone onto FRIDAY’s network so they could all see it. “Essentially, we just have to re-map all of his neurons, and then we can safely remove it. He’ll retain all of his knowledge and personality, but he won’t have any of the power that the gem provided him.”
Natasha had wondered. She'd heard her dads talking to each other in hushed whispers really late at night when they thought she was asleep. She'd learned that Howard, her grandfather, was in beyond asshole territory. Tony used drugs and drinking as an excuse to bond with his dad, because it was the only way he could spend time with him. He tried to do things to impress him, and nothing was ever good enough. No matter what he did. He was always on the receiving end of Howard's temper, unless they were drinking together.
I’m not your son, Tony thought, but again, chose to keep his thoughts private. This Thanos guy shared the shit out of him.
“Held in a separate safe place Heimdall and my mother chose where my father would not go searching for it. I do not think they accounted for someone else daring to search for it. Thanos must have gotten a hold of its location and used it for the stone he had already acquired.”
At least, that’s what he told himself as he worked on his project until his eyelids grew heavy from overwork and he fell asleep right there in his workshop.
Steve frowned. “Well, no. I’m not gay. But maybe it was to help me get a better understanding of you. I’ve been so hellbent on hating the other you. I never really gave him a chance. I just assumed he was an arrogant alcoholic who didn’t know how to deal with actual people so instead he just buys them with his money. But I’ve seen how kind you are, and I don’t think that my Tony could ever be as heartless as I’ve made him out to be. I don’t think it’s possible. Maybe this was to teach me not to judge him, to learn there’s a lot more to Tony Stark than meets the eye.”
before Steve declared it bath time. Bucky pouted, but Steve promised to read him an extra bedtime story and all was forgiven. He let Steve give Bucky a bath while he cleaned up the kitchen and turned off all the lights.
“You tortured us,” Nebula said, coming to stand next to her sister. “You made her fight against me. And every time she won a fight against me, you would take off a piece of my body and replace it with a machine. You turned me into this.”
“Get this, Thor said his father had the gauntlet in his weapons room, because it belonged to his father, Odin. His mother’s bedtime story was their own history. Odin built the gauntlet and tried to seize the power of the stones once a long time ago and it didn’t go as planned. His second in command tried to steal the power from him, and he sealed her in the underworld and made the nine realms forget she ever existed.”
He heard Peggy’s sharp intake of breath and Natasha muttered, “Holy crap,” as he assessed this other person who was supposed to be her father.
Steve shifted in his seat. “You know her?” Tony had told him Peggy was a part of their lives in this universe, but he needed confirmation again, just to be sure.
"I trust you to lead me around." He handed his cane to her and she placed it next to the umbrella rack. Then she took his forearm and led him to where her parents were waiting in the living room, a deep sigh on her lips trying to get rid of her nerves.
"I guess it's possible," Tony said. "I had a dream that I was a superhero the other night. I guess something like that could exist in another world parallel to mine."
Natasha watched as the Avengers vacated the tower, leaving her alone and a nervous wreck. She spun around in the chair she was sitting in half a dozen times. “Do you think this plan is going to work, FRIDAY?” she asked the AI.
Everyone involved in the conversation shook their heads. Tony scrubbed a hand over his face and sighed. “Okay. Good talk,” he mumbled, turning back to some kind of information FRIDAY was showing him.
Tony nodded. “Natasha was acting weird, too. And I was having memories of conversations we’ve never had, about S.H.I.E.L.D. and missions and things I know nothing about.”
“Okay, but…you said I deal in clean energy? Have I patented the arc reactor yet? I found a way to harness the technology I started at MIT, didn’t I?”
The day she was set to leave was an emotional one for her. She missed her own world, but she sure was going to miss all of the Avengers she had gotten to know. She wished she had a way to keep in contact with Tony and Steve and Wanda, but the multiverse wouldn’t allow her to do that. She would go the rest of her life wondering how things on this world were going.
After a few hours of restless, no good sleep, Tony sighed and decided it was time to go face the music. He cringed at the idea of going downstairs to a Steve that wasn’t his. He missed Skinny Steve. He wanted his husband back. This new Steve seemed nice enough, he guessed, but he wasn’t his husband. It seemed cruel for the universe to make him go through this alone.
Everyone stared in horror at the scene before them. They didn’t actually think Thanos had in in him. But with the death of Natasha, it only made them more determined to beat him. To kill him. To make him pay for the death of their teammate, their friend, their family. All bets were off, and there was no more playing nice. Not anymore.
Tony’s hands were shaking as he still held Steve in midair. Steve held on tighter to Tony, afraid of falling.
Matt shook his head. “How did I become good friends with people who are so cavalier about killing people?”
Childhood: Thor grew up very loved and respected in Asgard, as a prince who would someday take the throne. He and his friends in the palace of Asgard went on many adventures and were never left wanting.
Bucky put his tiny hand in hers and led her over to the table, where he and Steve were in the middle of playing the board game. She sat down in between the two and immediately hugged her other dad.
“Thanos!” Thor’s booming voice cursed. “Yes. My mother used to tell me and Loki bedtime stories about him and his home planet, Titan. Father has the gauntlet that controls the infinity stones in his weapons room.”
"Hello, sirs," Matt said. "I would shake your hands, but I can't exactly see where you are in order to do that."
Another thing hard to process for Tony? The idea of him being in a relationship with someone other than Steve. While it was clear Steve was single and adjusting to 21st century life, Tony's file told a different story. What kind of weird universe was it that let him and Pepper have a relationship? Like, who let him sleep with Pepper? Not that she was awful, by any means, it's just...he and Pepper had been best friends ever since they met in college and she was the only person he could turn to when his parents died, and they were just...friends, nothing more. Sleeping with her seemed like...such an awkward thing.
“I…I have a brother, yes. His name is James, but we call him Bucky. Daddy talked you into naming him James Buchanan, after the president.”
Thor frowned. “Yes. That makes sense. My brother fell from the Bifrost into the void. He must have met Thanos there. He tricked or brainwashed my brother into doing his bidding.”
Thor shook his head. No, that wasn’t right. That kind of punishment was only for the worst Asgardian criminals, the ones who would no doubt be sent to Helheim with their death. Loki was a prince of Asgard. He had led the Jotuns into the throne room, sure, but in his defence he had just found out he was adopted as a spoil of war, stolen from his home of Jotunheim. He was wanted as a war criminal after attacking Earth, but those crimes should have had no bearing on his Asgardian sentence. His father had approved these heinous acts to be committed on their son? He had really ordered the death of one of Loki’s
Tony looked up at her in surprise. She seemed so unaffected by all of this. He suspected she was just as freaked as the rest of them, she just knew how to hide it better.
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.

He knew Steve would probably kill him if he knew he was planning to snoop on his daughter’s whereabouts, and if Natasha knew he was itching to search her room for any evidence, she’d probably never forgive or trust him again. But he wasn’t going to let that happen. Tony knew something wasn’t right; he could feel it in the pit of his stomach. He wanted to know what was going on. He had a feeling his daughter was in trouble, and if that was the case, he needed to be prepared. With lawyers on hand, just in case it was something really bad. Something he didn’t want to know about.
“I can do it,” Vision said. “I can bring anything I wish to life just by believing in it. Perhaps I can appeal to his heart.”
After they chilled out for about a week, Tony hooked Vision up to a bunch of wires and put him a deep sleep so he could remove the stone without essentially killing the synthezoid.
He took pauses along the way to greet the Asgardians around him, friends and others that he had fought with, glad to see him alive and well. On any other day he would take taken time to converse with them over a feast, but he did not have time to reminisce with those of his home world. He had more pressing matters at hand.
“I’m sorry, but no,” Thor said. “I agree. We already have Thanos in our clutches. We cannot risk him escaping.”
Asgard could have been in any state with his brother on the throne; Thor was not denying that his brother could be a little power hungry and generally didn’t always have everyone’s best interests at heart. However, he also knew Loki loved his home, and would never want grave harm to come to Asgard. Walking around and surveying the land, Thor had to admit that Loki on Asgard’s throne wasn’t much different from Odin’s rule. Heimdall had said Odin knew Loki was ruling, and Thor wouldn’t dare imagine his father would leave Asgard in his brother’s hands if he didn’t somehow trust him nor have his eye on the situation. This comforted Thor, and gave a new spark of hope in his chest that Loki had come to his senses and was trying to do some good in the world, in his own mischievous, slightly warped way. It meant there were redeeming qualities in him after all.
