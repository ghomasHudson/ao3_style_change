and more a braindrizzle, ‘cause it
“Yeah,” Dean responds, as he looks at Cas, catches sight of his lashes, pointed with sweat. “You couldn’t have picked somewhere a little more sanitary to jump me?”
“Fine.”
It’s pretty crafty, ‘cause admittedly, Dean was expecting Cas to come in through the same way he did. Judging by Nick’s obvious confidence in his inevitable victory, he was thinking along the same lines as Dean.
“Cas—”
“Dean?”
And by the same token, how can someone profess to truly love you unless they’ve seen the very worst of you? That’s what love is, right? Someone seeing every single part of you, and loving the whole, not only being there to pick up the pieces when you shatter, but knowing where each piece fits, how to fill in the fractures with their love to make you greater than the sum of your parts.
With a completely straight face, Cas replies, "Do you want me to make a joke about cream?"
. I promise you, it's super highbrow stuff.
him, or Cas telling him all the shit he
“You’re so fuckin’ pretty,” Batholomew says again, like it bears repeating.
Focusing on piecing together the fragments — the scent of the creek’s muddy flats, the algae-covered rocks on the bank, the thick, wet rot of moss and leaves — Dean tries to drive down certain neural highways in his mind to get him from A to A Revelation.
Which, what?
“Hi,” the man says, breath ghosting over Dean’s neck. He’s standing too close to be decent, and this ain’t that kind of bar, not at all, but this guy doesn’t seem to give a shit.
incredulity, Cas’ lips quirk, and he amends, “Or, I suppose it could have been the French toymaker dabbling in black magic who built the mechanism into the configuration. Either way.”
So yeah, Dean doesn’t want shy and sweet. Dean wants to be thrown against a wall and
And by ‘huh’ Dean actually means ‘what the actual fucking fuck’.
Castiel.
Then Dean started pulling away from him again.
“All the time.”
It’s a box. Maybe six inches square.
like a zombie. He looks like Dean’s husband, his best friend, his everything. There’s no drooling, moaning about ‘braiiiinnnnns’, or the lingering smell of rotting flesh — just the faint, familiar scent of Cas’ fruity body wash that he swears up and down doesn’t make him smell like a pina colada.
The next morning, Dean wakes Cas up with coffee, a bacon sandwich, and some Advil.
“Cas…”
Back to some horror movie roots here, folks.
“Don’t go,” Cas says simply, and it’s wet around the edges.
There’s a knock on the door — shave and a haircut — and without so much as the socially expected ‘two bits’ response, the door is pushed open.
“Absolutely.” Dean’s fingers curl around the handle of the knife, right as Bartholomew comes up behind him.
Dean will never forgive himself if this is it.
Dressed, splinted, and back with the others in the dining room, Dean helps Cas down onto the nest of clothes they’ve made for him.
To say that Castiel has spent the vast majority of his thirty-eight years on this earth as somewhat of a quiet ‘nerd’ may be an understatement.
The next sound is a female scream. One that Dean heard earlier, but now it’s drenched in panic.
“If you’d just been a
While Jimmy’s sexuality is something he’s battled with, finding it often conflicts with his spirituality, Dean had naively assumed that his family knew of his existence at least. Jimmy’s mom is dead, Castiel estranged, but his dad is alive and kicking (and ultra-religious to the point of puritanical.) Dean’s always figured that the man refused to meet him because he disapproved of Jimmy’s late-in-life discovered homosexuality, choosing to shun the wedding for the same reason. Now though, Dean’s wondering if the lack of familial involvement is an extension of Jimmy’s own insecurities and deity-inflicted shame.
“I did order,” Cas says eventually, eyes tracking up to Dean, looking right into him, seeing him all the way through like he’s always been able to. “I told them not to bring it until you were here though.”
found each other though,” Benny mutters, the disapproving headmaster to Charlie’s schoolmarm.
“Dean, oh—f—fuck,” Cas grunts, and then he’s reaching down with his free hand, tilting Dean’s gaze to look up at him, blue-ringed black meeting green-ringed black. Tears pricking at the corners of his eyes, brain hazy with lust, Dean swallows again as Cas stares down at him, transfixed, eyes hooded, mouth parted on the brink of a curse.
This chapter has been such a pain in the arse to write that I've cast a pox on its family and its family's farm.
Dean knows he’s been coiling himself around Cas, squeezing him tighter and tighter like a python, but now that the idea’s been put in his head, Dean can’t shake the feeling that he’s cutting off the circulation.
Successfully past the tape, Dean pulls the intact paper away from the box inside, lifting the lid along with it.
Except, there are plenty of times when that’s not enough, and tonight happens to be one of them. He’s feeling particularly frustrated by the distance, so after he’s come with a loud cry, spurting white over his fist and up his abdomen, clenching hard around the two fingers in his ass, he sends Cas the evidence of his orgasm — a single photo. His hands are still shaking enough that he hasn’t got the wherewithal to type out actual words, and a picture of his come-streaked chest and stomach, his waning hardness resting against his abdomen, should be worth a thousand of them anyways.
“You’re mine,” Cas says like it’s irrefutable, just a tenet of the universe. He holds Dean’s head in the cup of his palms, and promises, “I’ll always come back for you. I’d come back from the dead for you.”
“Normally, I’d say we should at least attempt to get down the mountain, but thanks to Benny, that’s out of the question,” Dean answers. Then, just to really drive the point home with a stake through the heart, he tacks on, “Cas is probably too injured, and I’m not gonna risk it.”
Calls from Charlie, Benny, and Garth continue to go unanswered.
“All of them?”
“It’s a rental,” Garth responds.
Dean crouches behind a tree trunk. Now seems like a good time to put his shirt back on — ‘cause whatever’s about to come next requires both caution and shirts — so he does, yanking it out from his rear pocket and dragging it on over his head.
Balthazar hums to himself, as they stare blankly at the items in the trunk, “Can we not just put a bomb under her car and see the broad out that way?”
He can see her eyes moving behind her lids, like REM sleep, but nowhere as peaceful, and something horrific abruptly occurs to Dean.
He probably would’ve bled out. And it would’ve been slower and more painful, but this unsub chose to kill the vic there and then, rather than make him suffer.
Castiel’s mouth quirks and he nods.
“Coming from a lawyer? Jeez, I’m honored.”
Dean waits. Nervous as fuck, but excited too. He can’t believe they’re actually going to do this. It’s irreparable, there’s no coming back from this; there’ll forever be a black mark on Dean’s soul. Whether he’s the one who pulls the trigger or not, he’s just as guilty as Cas.
“How about now?” Cas demands, nose brushing against Dean’s temple, his mouth close to Dean’s ear. “How about I fuck you right now until the only thing you can say is my name?”
Cas reaches out and cups the side of Dean’s face, “Anytime.” There’s something heavy in there, something substantial and deep-rooted, giving the word meaning beyond what he’s saying aloud.
Nick hesitates, like he’s protecting someone actually worth protecting before he apparently remembers that Benny’s a waste of a Cajun accent, “He’s in a house in one of those gated communities, not that far from here actually.”
And they say romance is dead.
It shouldn’t surprise Dean, but it does. There are kinks and then there are
Cas is a zombie and has the partially digested remains of a realtor in his stomach.
“Awesome,” Dean says, channeling his excitement at seeing Cas tomorrow into the megawatt smile he gives his husband. “So now we can both look forward to it.”
"Yeah, ya are. Don’t worry, I think it’s cute.”
If this is all he gets, he’d still do the deal all over again exactly the same. No regrets.
try to use some critical thinking skills.”
Dean’s blood freezes and boils at the same time. It’s a miracle that he doesn’t spontaneously combust or rip a hole in the universe. Instead, he makes a grab for the nearest thing to steady himself — which turns out to be Castiel’s waist —and rather than halting the tilt-a-whirl, it only speeds up, spinning into high gear when Castiel pulls back, his heavy-lidded eyes flicking between Dean’s, studying his reaction. “I think he told me to stay away because he knew that I wouldn’t be able to be near you and not have you. He knew how much I’d want you.”
“And you thought it was a prime opportunity to scare the shit out of me.”
Cas follows Dean’s line of sight. “On the bench? Were you alone? With someone?”
Dean jerks away on a sharp intake of breath when it fizzes painfully in a large gash on his jaw. Cas practically rolls his eyes, all
Maybe his
There are so many beautiful people in their element, all moving in sync with the pulse of the throbbing industrial-metal bassline. Cages are chained high above the heads of the writhing crowd, anchored into the rafters of the arched ceiling, containing bodies that dance to their own beat, swaying to some unheard music, ethereal and sprite-like. There are aerial dancers bound up in long swathes of silk, unraveling themselves at terminal velocity until they stop inches away from the ground before wrapping themselves back up again, limbs weaving through the dark fabric as they ascend.
“Not leaving without you, Cas!”
Dean’ll be the judge of that.
Now normally, this wouldn’t be a problem. You meet your hero, you’re disappointed, you part ways never to see each other again. You cry into your pillow a bit for all the jerk off sessions you’ll have to forgo and you move the fuck on.
The guy flounders. There’s no good answer here. Either he retreats now with absolutely no dignity or he gets to find out first-hand about the danger lurking in Cas’ eyes.
The leader of the quartet is deathly white and has pins driven into his head at inch intervals. At his side, a bald woman whose neck is pinned open like Dean’s ninth-grade vivisection frog. Accompanying them is a feature-less creature whose bloody mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle — the exposed teeth sharpened to points — and the fourth is a grotesque, sweating slug-monster whose eyes are covered by dark, John-Lennon-esque glasses.
“We don’t know,” Benny says, inserting himself into the moment Dean and Castiel were in danger of having. “That’s what we want to find out. You’re our best lead. The more we can find out about you, the better chance we have of findin’ this guy.”
The only thing that’s changed between then and now is the official confirmation of death. Just a piece of paper. Whoever this is has waited thirteen years for revenge, all the while supposedly knowing who is responsible, simply needing the confirmation that the dude is actually dead, like a goddamn permission slip?
“A mediocre attempt, brother.”
Unfortunately — or fortunately, depending on whether you’re Dean or not — Charlie chooses that moment to reappear with some coffee. She nudges the donut box to the edge of the table with her knee and deposits a couple of mugs, before going back to get more.
Mostly for Dean, admittedly. He had to squelch home in vomit-filled shoes, because there was no way he was driving his Baby anywhere.
The pieces are all pushed out, raised like the spires of a cathedral.
Sometimes, he sees joggers. Rarely on their own. Especially not women. Which is unfortunately necessary, but ultimately sensible. There are a lot of predators wandering the streets.
Dropping his sweaty forehead to Dean’s shoulder, breath hot and heavy as he comes down, Cas pants, “Shouldn’t have done that.”
more coffee.
Cas knocks his voice up a half octave and, cracking the door just enough to be heard, says, “Hi, Amelia. Dean and I are in the kitchen, but we got caught outside in the storm, and we’re in a state of undress. I would advise against you coming in just now.”
“Amelia.”
Admittedly, it’s not his fault that Dean married the wrong person, but it
The shadows growl.
The seconds that pass threaten to carry Dean away from calm acceptance towards the fear-flag of dread. It’s bad, Dean knows that by the state Cas was in, but is he prepared to actually hear it?
Jimmy merely gestures to the painted-red of Dean’s mouth, says, “You’ve got a little something there… yeah, right there. A little to the left… Now it’s gone.”
“O--kay,” Dean says slowly, and fate-tempting fucker that he is, tacks on, “But I
Pumping sluggish but steady, the blood just keeps coming. Until it doesn’t — abruptly turned off like a faucet — and then… then Dean lifts his hand and it’s like someone pressed rewind on the universal remote because Cas’ skin is healing, fusing itself back together, closing the wound until all that’s left is a jagged red scar, and even that begins to fade to a puffy pink as Dean watches, dumbfounded.
After that, things fell into place.
They couldn’t have gone to Atlantic City or some shit? Maybe hung out with some alligators in the Everglades?
Cas is going home with and fucking until she cries, and that’s a mantra Dean holds close to his heart, wheeling it out whenever she simpers at Cas and tries for the fifteenth time to grab his attention.
“I love you too, Cas. I’d do anything for you.”
about Dean and me.”
Castiel lifts one shoulder in a shrug. In all honesty, Dean’s surpassing his expectations. He’d hoped Dean would kill Benny, obviously – orchestrated it that way – but he thought that once the rage had cooled, there’d be remorse.
Well, shit. They didn’t do
Well. Except for now. Now he’s just annoyed. Sitting on his nice couch, drinking his nice beer, Benny’s being
But Dean cannot stop thinking about Cas. About that fucking box. About what it all means.
“What the fuck was that?” Daniel asks, swivel-eyed and reeling as he tries to peer into the dark corners and recesses of the room.
He can’t quite see Cas’ bitchy eye roll, but he knows it’s there. “Jimmy and I…” Cas starts, but it’s a false one, so he recalls his scattered thoughts and tries again. “I knew I wasn’t straight by the time I was fourteen. I enjoyed looking at people of all genders, finding them aesthetically and sexually appealing. But, of course, my family was —
Dean’s shoulder jostles into Castiel’s armpit as they struggle through the ordeal of getting him to his feet. Even with Dean’s makeshift splint in place, it’s awkward, and for the tenth time tonight, Castiel wishes he’d chosen to break his arm instead.
“Tell me I’m wrong,” Cas demands, licking over the frenulum, watching Dean through his thick eyelashes.
“...I guess so.”
Adding insult to injury, Dean
There’s a long, dangerous moment before Cas silently slips out of him on the slide of lube and come, and Dean clenches his jaw against the urge to break down and cry. Cas disentangles Dean’s arms from the shirt for him, and then there’s nothing behind Dean but the air carrying the scent of his ex-boyfriend.
“We own it.”
“But your brother? Have you forgiven him?”
He drops his attention to the shadow of Cas’ erection pushing at the zipper of his jeans. “Can I…?”
This time, the bellow doesn’t come from Dean or Cas, but the Cenobites. The lights flicker and grow brighter still, the noise building toward a crescendo. Dean has to turn his head, the strength of the light like a minor sun. It burns hotter and hotter, brighter and brighter, louder and louder, reaching a peak that pushes Dean to the cliff’s edge of sanity, staring into the abyss below with unseeing eyes.
“I had a hunch,” Cas says, devouring the sandwich like it’s haute cuisine rather than just something Dean slapped together with the bits he managed to forage out of the carnage of the kitchen. There’s disaster all around them, but Dean only has eyes for Cas as he chews and swallows.
He shouldn’t be surprised that the others think Cas is fucked up or whatever, but it still kinda hurts. As always, it’s the two of them against the world. Nobody understands them. They don’t even try.
“...and then I told Ben that he could smoke crack if he wanted to, because I’ve heard it’s much healthier than meth--”
Of course, Dean had mostly discounted the notion of things getting worse, because, well, how could they?
Dean considers the question. The silence drags on for a while before he manages an unsatisfying answer. “I don’t know.”
“Going that well, huh?”
And Dean believes him.
It’s consecrated ground now, even though Dean was unholy from the start.
It’s Cas’ ankle that Dean’s most worried about.
The police chief is on the main floor of the warehouse, cataloging the damage. He’d wanted to call a paramedic, but Dean had waved it off. It doesn’t hurt to breathe, so it probably isn’t broken. More likely bruised, but it still hurts like a
Like that time he was in the front row at a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert and Johnny Van Zant reached down from the stage and shook his hand, Dean’s determined to never wash this section of his skin.
Cas boxes Dean against the counter, hands braced on either side of his body to quash any escape attempt. Dean’s raised palms press against the firm swell of Cas’ chest as he leans in, attempting to eradicate any remaining space between them. “Dean.”
Cas’ cock feels huge, the head bumping against the roof of Dean’s mouth, his soft palate, with every thrust. Cas’ thighs tremble slightly, stomach muscles clenched taut, pulled tight against the need to shove himself down Dean’s throat.
Dean nods, and with Cas’ assistance, he gets to his feet. He feels stupid and self-conscious when he sees that the person — a dude — is still there, watching them nervously.
Closer than Sammy who became a criminal lawyer for the same reason Dean joined the FBI. Sam didn’t get the John Winchester experience in Dolby-Digital-Surround-Sound-4K-Technicolor because Dean shielded his kid brother from the worst of it, and when they escaped, Sam was barely a teenager, whereas Dean was a few months shy of legal adulthood.
“I’ve never killed a god before, so looks like we’ll be each other’s firsts. Kinda romantic if you think about it.” The demon’s eyes flash onyx. “Though, by the looks of your meat suit, I won’t have to do anything other than wait you out. You’re gonna pop like a pinata. Another couple of hours, it’ll look like a slaughterhouse in here.”
give Castiel the silent treatment. Which is almost worse, because Dean Winchester is ‘king of the petty bitches’ (Claire’s terminology) and he
Cas’ smile is sharp, his gaze like a snare, when he says, “My clothes are probably still drying.”
It’s the fastest he’s moved in hours when he reaches for and unlocks his cell, searching through his videos of last night and finding the one he’s after to make his point.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says and his voice is whiskey-and-cigarettes rough. Practically post-coital, and it has heat pooling low in Dean’s gut.
the week of his birthday and Cas still owes him a hotel called Freckles or Sexy Ass or some other ode to his favorite body part a la Bugsy Siegel and Virginia Hill.
He finishes work earlier than Cas finishes law school on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so, alumni card in hand, he pays a visit to the library to log on to one of the computers and search the digital newspaper archives.
It’s stupid — especially considering how idyllic things have been — but Dean can't help the way his mind presses at the memory of Cas beating the shit outta the creeper for him, poking at it like a bruise, a wobbly tooth.
“How?” Dean asks, tossing his pen away in frustration. It hits the silver-plated frame with a photo of him and Sammy outside this office the day Dean opened. His younger self is so full of hope and excitement for the future. Dumbass. “If you’re so sure that he’s a vampire and is going out to drink from other people, then you don’t need me to follow him, do you?”
“Hmm,” Dean says as he drags his hand across the spines of books Cas keeps in here, despite the library only being on the floor above. “I guess there are some serious benefits to being invisible. I can go search out a ladies locker room — or men’s, I guess — stand there and jerk off into a tube sock. But that’s kinda predictable, ain’t it?” Atop one of the shelves close to the door is a super expensive, super ugly porcelain jug-vase-thing that Naomi and the other crooks at City Hall gave Cas last month as a token of their ‘appreciation’ during a posh dinner. Though they may as well have called the entire night a ‘please-don’t-kill-us-for-underestimating-you’ party.
Castiel laughs quietly as he nearly trips over the cat, half-apologizing to it as he leaps clear and continues on his way, leaving the cat on the sidewalk, staring after him, along with Dean.
Balthazar continues, unaware of Dean’s inner freak-out. “I’m assuming that he’s told you what it supposedly does? The whole pleasure-pain spiel?”
Dean knows that Cas isn’t close to his family, like, at all, so he’s not surprised to hear that he’s planning on staying here.
It’d be pretty rude to let Benny get murdered by himself, so with a disgruntled sigh, Dean follows his friend. As he strides across the porch, the boards wobble and creak beneath his boots. They were strong enough to bear Benny’s weight, but it’s still a nerve-wracking fifteen seconds until he reaches the safety of the foyer’s marble floor.
“He won’t stop until somebody makes him,” Cas says, unhinged and thready.
Castiel laughs despite himself, picking at the label of his bottle. “It does, yes. I’m not permitted to talk about specific cases, but I have seen some rather crazy things.”
There’s a lot to unpack and to hang out to air, but Dean can be patient. After all, he’s waited two years for this. He can wait a few more days. Find some more victims.
Next to him, Cas narrows his eyes. Dean takes a triumphant bite of his donut, pleased with himself.
Dean dumps his cleaning supplies on the floor. The roll of bags unravels across the boards. “Are you gonna tell me what happened? How you got like this?”
A theory that’s confirmed when the dead bulb hanging above Jimmy’s body sizzles impossibly back to life, the filament burning brighter and brighter until it’s excruciating to look at. A high-pitched noise accompanies it, ringing louder and louder, becoming a barrage of color and sound until Dean doesn’t know whether to cover his eyes or ears.
This feels like every horror movie trap and trope ever, but what choice do they have?
“Stop,” Dean hisses, reaching back to slap at Cas’ thigh.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” she responds, her lips pursing into a thin line. “He’s been through a lot and needs his rest. Not to mention that he’s also on a heavy dose of pain relief, which means he most likely won’t be able to answer your questions yet anyway.”
Garth restarts the engine and steers the car up the narrow road. The further up the mountain they go, the thicker the trees get, until they damn near block out the sun entirely, small beams of light dappling through here and there.
Is nobody listening to Dean tonight? Is he just Charlie Brown’s teacher wah-wahing his way through life?
He shoves in, hard and fast. Drags back out and in again, until he’s fucking the moans loose from Dean’s throat, splitting Dean wide around the perfect shape of him, carving out a space inside Dean’s body that’s just for him.
“He always did have a thing for picture-taking,” Cas murmurs next to Dean,
Okay, so it’s surface-of-the-sun levels of hot, but barring any real evidence that Cas is even into him, those kinds of thoughts aren’t helpful, which means Dean has to cut them off at the pass.
there a difference?”
Clearly, Dean’s missing something here.
“And if he doesn’t love me…” Dean continues, unimpressed that he has to explain this logic to a supposedly functioning adult, “Then why are you waiting for him before you shoot me, huh? If he doesn’t give a shit, then it shouldn’t matter what you do to me.”
Dean waits for the noise to die down. “Nah, it’s just me and a takeout tonight.”
The question to end all questions. Dean would suggest another brainstorm, but it’s become obvious after tonight that they lack the proper equipment.
And Sam could visit. No restrictions whatever.
in all its glory, but it turns out she hates silent German expressionist horror films and Dean hates people who think Max Schreck was actually a vampire.
Together, Balthazar and Dean watched Cas go, and as soon as he was inside, Dean turned to Balthazar with a self-satisfied smirk on his face, ‘cause yeah, he was invited to shower with that hotass with puke in his hair,
“The knife too. Toss it over here.”
To get to the Moffitt library (the main undergrad one, rather than the Kresge, which is specifically for engineering and the one Dean usually frequents), they have to cross the plaza. It has Dean hesitating, just for a split second.
There’s a light breeze in the air.
It feels like a momentous task, so instead, he asks, “Where are you? Are you okay?”
Benny pales at the vehemence in Dean’s face and turns to Nick. “I don’t wanna be here for this.”
As he enters their building, Dean’s already imagining Cas hunched at his desk, squinting down at the pages of a poli-sci textbook. He’s probably got that little ineffectual desk fan of his going, ‘cause it’s hotter than satan’s asshole at the moment, and literally
He’s not sure who would be sending him presents. He’s got a few friends in his classes, but he’s definitely not popular enough to be expecting gifts delivered to his freakin’ bed. Could be Jo, but he saw her just this morning, and she didn’t mention anything.
“You try dealing with this,” the Chef mutters to the crew member, “See if all you do is swear.” And with that, he’s shouldering past the poor boom operator to go and terrify another one of Dean’s ‘teammates’.
“Cas!” Garth points at Cas, trying to look as intimidating as a guy can when he’s skinny as hell, flopped awkwardly on a couch, and at least moderately tipsy. “In order to become a true horror aficionado, you must answer these questions three. One: What’s the name of the camp in Sleepaway Camp?”
They watch and eat in silence. Giblet is between them on the couch, pretending to be asleep, but most assuredly keeping a close eye (and ear and nose) on the food situation.
Cas’ fly is still open, jeans slung low on the sinful jut of his hip bones, dick tucked behind cotton again, and Dean has conflicting feelings about whether he wants to go another round or whether he just wants to get the fuck outta here.
“Shit,” he mutters, scrambling to his feet and shoving the lighter in his pocket. Fumbling for the key, and an excuse to justify his presence in the room, Dean makes to leave, but Jimmy’s already in the doorway, crossing the threshold, rushing toward him, right hand clamped ineptly around his left. Blood is flowing in abundance, welling up between Jimmy’s fingers and dribbling down his arm, dripping from his elbow, adding stain to the bare boards.
Dean can’t hide the horrified expression on his face and Nick laughs, “It’s not your old house, don’t worry--” Dean’s not worried, he met the couple that bought his old place before it sold; they were a respectable family, not a fucking nutjob with an obsession, “--That was sold just before I met him, unfortunately, but there are a couple of similar communities around.”
No lecturing. Exchange ideas. Respond to concerns.
The speed limit for this stretch of road is 45.
“Dean, Jo’s dead.”
“So, you wanted to wipe us all out?” Dean asks, and Castiel knows that he’s playing for time. To do what, Castiel doesn’t know, but it sets his teeth on edge all the same. This is a delicate situation, and Dean needs to be careful. “Are you just bored or do you have a plan?”
A couple of glasses of bubblegum gin - which Castiel has to admit doesn’t taste quite like the abomination he had been anticipating - down, he and Charlie are sitting cross-legged on the couch, facing one another.
Or something.
“There you are,” Jimmy says, chest rising and falling lightly with exertion. He steps inside the room, eyeing the mattress in the corner. The mattress his brother and Dean have fucked on more times than Dean can count. “Squatters?”
anything.”
Not quite time for firearms just yet. He ejects the magazine, tosses it across the warehouse, keeps the one bullet in the chamber.
He doesn’t give a shit if he’s considered rude.
His theory is already proven by virtue of his own long lashes and blow job lips paired with the fact that he’s sitting in the passenger seat of a Prius, genuinely considering if there’s even a sliver of a chance that vampires could be real.
Unimpressed and no doubt pulling an epic bitchface, Sam responds, “He’s asking for you.
Dean slams the drawer shut, balled-up shirt in hand. Behind him, he hears Jimmy make a swift exit stage right. Which might be the smartest thing he’s done this morning.
Cas senses his surrender and growls, “That’s it. So good for me, Dean.”
She pauses her texting, slants him a look. “No creative insult for me today? I’m disappointed.” Putting her cell on the table, she glances around at their wood-paneled, marble surroundings, probably deciding (like Dean) that this is not the best place for a bitch-off. “What do you want, handsome?”
Shooed back out into the hospital corridor as a rainbow of scrubs pours into Castiel’s room, Benny drags Dean in close by his elbow and whisper-yells, "Do you actually have a brain in your skull? Or in your empty coconut of a head, is it akin to walkin' down a pitch-black hallway in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar house, just constantly knockin' over vases and end tables?"
Lips to the shell of Dean’s ear, Cas whispers lowly, “What’s this really about?” Dean can’t answer, unable to formulate a response before Cas continues, the words curling wrathful and vindictive between them. “Is this about Meg and me, or is it about you? About your guilt and insecurities?”
“Tell us,” Charlie demands, folding her arms across her chest. “
Dean’s interest is well and truly piqued now, “What are your standard rates?”
“Now do you believe me?” She asks, speaking in a normal tone, and her voice resounds through the basement, damn near echoing off the concrete walls.
Dean’ll do it too. He’s already making murder spree plans, brought about by the way Cas makes these little agonized noises every time his (suspected broken) ankle is jostled.
“Er, hi,” Dean manages dorkwardly, twelve years old again with his first proper crush on a boy two motel rooms down.
“I said…” Dean starts with fastidious patience, “It alright if we borrow your suped up SUV? My dad’s old junker is fucked and according to Sam there’s a hell of a tornado about to touchdown about a quarter of a mile Southeast of here.”
“I doubt he’d approve,” Cas deadpans, the last five frenzied minutes a lifetime that’s flashing in front of both their eyes.
“What did you have in mind?”
Castiel.
Cas’ brow creases in consternation. “Do we have anything to eat?”
Damn near every instinct in his body is telling him to run, to get the fuck outta here, but something else is keeping him rooted to the spot. He keeps on staring into the murk, wanting it to make sense, and it’s then that Dean sees… something. Too real to be a shadow, but something not real enough to exist. Crouched in the corner, squatting and unable to lift itself into a standing position.
Dean doesn’t know what to do. This wasn’t part of the plan. One (or preferably several) of the FBI agents was supposed to return fucking fire and kill Nick - or at the very least maim him so Dean could finish the job with one of their guns. But that didn’t happen and now everyone’s dead. Michael, Nick’s apes, at least six or seven agents, probably closer to ten.
So, before he does something stupid, he makes a tactical retreat to the kitchen for more beer. And then, when he’s sure Cas isn’t watching, he disappears off somewhere quiet with two-thirds of a six-pack, so he can sulk in peace.
“Yeah,” Dean answers, because this dude —
“Uh, a towel?” Dean manages, smooth as crunchy peanut butter, scrambling for seconds and distance before he makes an even bigger idiot of himself. “I’ll get you a towel.”
Dean’s not sure who Cas’ dramatic-bitch eye roll is aimed at, but he likes to think it’s Meg and her clingy AF ways. Only Dean’s allowed to be clingy, goddammit.
Cas says, “You think I did,” and it’s not a question. He moves in closer, Dean’s hands caught between the crush of their bodies. Cas’ cock is branding-iron hot against the naked flesh of Dean’s ass. Dean whines as Cas adjusts himself to get a hand between their bodies, cupping Dean’s ass cheek, palm warm and smooth.
Still. He’s trying here, so he asks, “And you still let him suck you once a week? Because you have to?”
There’s something otherworldly about them, something that lends itself to a sense of uncertainty, a feeling that anything could happen. It’s like being poised on the threshold of the present, wavering between a nostalgic, wasteland past and the irresistible gleam of the future. A better future with a better God. One who listens, one who cares, one who saves.
Sometimes, Dean also forgets that Cas has spent twelve years around Dean and picked up some sarcasm and sass. Though Dean suspects a lot of that dry sense of humor came in his factory settings, settling deep into that crack in his chassis.
A glance up at the nearest clock face on the Campanile tells Dean it’s just past seven forty-five. What a coincidence.
It’s so rare that Dean is actually right about stuff in their marriage, he’s not gonna let this opportunity pass him by, cannibal zombie or not.)
It was exhausting, constantly modifying his behavior to mirror whoever he was talking to. He couldn’t work out how other people did it all the time, before he realized that other people
It smells like
“Anything in particular you want? Nuts? Onion rings?” Gabriel makes a dirty gesture, which Castiel pointedly ignores.
Though, he’s actually kinda (definitely, 100%) into it.
Obligatory photo for their ‘
A strike hits the tender skin of his thigh and Dean bites back a yelp.
James Novak is the older twin by a whole eighteen minutes.
Together, they walk across campus to Charlie and Garth’s place for the final time in their sophomore year. They don’t hold hands, ‘cause Dean’s not a chick, but they do keep super close together, all up in each other’s personal space, and Dean can’t help but feel a little smug about that blond prick from last night who looked at Cas like he hung the moon.
The flame licks upwards, a greenish-yellow, saturating every terrible welt and horrendous boil in a disgusting shade of puce. It seems appropriate somehow.
“Oh.” Dean stares down at his textbook like the mechanical properties of metal will somehow help him out here. “I’m sorry, man. It seemed like you really liked her.”
Meg leans back in her seat, all alpha bitch, as she considers him with snake eyes, framed by perfectly applied winged eyeliner. Jo tried that shit once, and she ended up looking like a raccoon. It’s a good memory at a bad time, and Dean digs the fingers of his hidden right hand into his thigh through his JCPenney pants, willing himself to hold off on his freakout for when he gets home, when he can deal with this alone.
“Hi, handsome,” she says, like oil on water, and Dean’s spine straightens, immediately on his guard. They haven’t spoken since his birthday a few months back, and Dean’s perfectly content with that.
“I don’t know. We could be Mormons or something.”
The audience has gone completely silent. And for one terrifying moment, the world tilts on its axis and Dean thinks that this is it. This is the end of both of their careers.
Dean gestures with his glass. “Lay on, MacDuff.”
“Statistically, most murders occur on a Sunday,” Kevin murmurs off-handedly, like a punctured fact machine, dripping little blobs of
They’re both breathing raggedly by the time Cas pulls away; pink, plush slick of his mouth, and fevered brightness of blue eyes rapidly giving way to the blackness of pupil, as the desperate stilted, rhythm of their hips aligns their erections together over and over again. Dean dives in for another filthy-hot kiss, chasing Cas’ tongue, pleasure winding tight around his nerve endings, Cas’ mouth hot and open under his and it’s good,
stop staring at him, at his kohl-rimmed eyes, the curve of his muscles, the shine of the black latex braces on his bare chest, clipped to the tight leather pants that accentuate the thickness of his thighs and perfect ass.
Two against two.
All the months of pining cease to matter, and before Dean can think better of it, he leans forward, bracing his palms on Cas’ thighs, and kisses him.
Now. Crowbars have a lot of uses and as a hunk of steel, it’s pretty easy to imagine that they’d make an effective weapon.
Stupid smile on his face, Dean texts back:
Cas clicks it on, aiming the initially unsteady beam where Dean directs.
Which brings Dean neatly to something else that has not only worn thin, but torn the whole metaphor entirely, and it’s that Cas has taken to leaving his shirt off overnight now. Which is two things: firstly, mighty inconvenient, ‘cause Dean has literally no time alone to masturbate. Secondly (and unfortunately for Dean’s hanging-by-a-gossamer-string sanity), totally un-fucking-necessary, ‘cause it’s barely 65 out and so it makes no sense in the world for Cas to be existing with his shirt off.
Cas lifts one leg behind himself on the desk and strains to see what’s on the other side. He pushes himself away and shakes his head. “Nothing.”
“The body snatchers one,” Castiel nods at the corresponding case.
Finally, Dean breaks the surface with burning lungs, gasping and shivering. He scans the darkness for a sight of Benny.
Dean grins over the rim of his own mug. “Yeah, Charlie. Get your shit right.”
Dean slides into the booth on the opposite side of the table. “Hey, Cas.”
“How’d the mani-pedi go?” Dean asks, placing his cell on speakerphone at the center of the table so everyone can hear and butt in.
Dean hadn’t planned on letting Cas know about the dude across the hall just yet, but someone —
A little originality wouldn’t go amiss.
Finally, Castiel touches him, but it’s with the silk of Dean’s tie as he binds his wrists in position, right in the dip of his back, just above his ass. It takes an excruciating amount of time where nothing is said between the two of them, so all Dean can focus on is the smooth, cool feel of the tie on his skin, the pattern of the weave of fibers, the slightly rougher rub of the seam running up the center.
, Cas wraps his hand around Dean’s dick properly, smooth — and now mostly dry — palm closing around the sensitive flesh, right as he begins fucking Dean with short, jerky, animalistic thrusts that have Dean's muscles winding themselves into knots. He nails Dean on a particularly brutal one, driving deep, and Dean's whole body clenches, making them both moan.
Fuck.
go out. Not for anything less than operational concerns or to murderize some fucker. Last night, they did the murderizing, tonight they were supposed to go somewhere for
Straightaway, Dean sees what Benny meant when he told him about there being a strange kind of atmosphere. The whole place is abuzz with
Because of course he is.
“That’s not the point.” He sighs and pulls back, slumping into the nearest uncomfortable seat. “I get that this must be hard for you—”
“Really?” He says, only exaggerating his disappointment, rather than making it up entirely. “Wanna run it by me again?”
So, I’m sure most of you have noticed the latest tag to be added. You know that scene in The End, where Lucifer is wearing Sam and he tells Dean in the garden outside the sanitarium that:
“Cas. And he knows about your stalker issues, so there’s only one thing left to tell him, right?”
“Okay, thank you, doctor,” Benny says, sincere and agreeable. Just the kind of man your parents would be proud to call their son-in-law.
And for every fucker who degraded Dean, dehumanized him in the name of their own pleasure.
Castiel.
come between us.”
Purely as a time-delaying-slash-distraction tactic, Dean looks at it.
Smiling serenely, Dean replies, “Just how I’m gonna kill you nice and slow. Or maybe my husband will. Who knows? It’ll be exciting for us all to find out, won’t it?”
“Oh,” Benny says, eyes bouncing from Dean to Cas and back again. He seems to mentally shake himself before stepping past Charlie and leaning across the coffee table to offer Cas his hand. “Nice to meet ya, Cas.”
Classy.
“Cas is either the murderer or the reluctant hero. It could go either way.”
Along the way, ducking in and out of musty rooms, Dean counts how many graffitied dicks they find — like a phallus-based scavenger hunt. By the time they reach number twenty-seven, everyone — Cas included — is playing along, critiquing the artwork like they’re at the fucking Louvre.
Pinhead’s laugh drowns him out. “You think religion can save you?” He spreads his arms out wide, a blasphemous parody of Jesus on the cross. “I... am the way.” The living room light bulbs sizzle with unnatural brightness before dimming again. Thunder rolls in the distance. “We’re more real than your god ever will be.”
This is Dean’s clusterfuck to deal with.
“I know, Jo, but—”
Miracle curls up on the end of his bed.
Cas does that thing where he looks heavenward for help. Dean doesn’t know why he still bothers; it’s pretty apparent that any god that may or may not exist certainly ain’t on their side.
His instinct to shield – whilst misguided – warms Castiel’s heart.
Cas fucks him long and hard, hands gripping at Dean’s hips and thighs, hauling him back onto his dick with a possessive strength that has Dean wishing they could kill the bastard more than once.
“Hey,” the guy says, slick and self-assured, god’s gift to whomever he chooses to grace with his presence. “What are you drinking?”
It takes them a couple of long-winded attempts, picking their way slowly over the forest floor with the flashlight beam, but eventually, they find the place. They know that they’ve found it, ‘cause Benny’s shirt is snagged on a low-hanging tree branch, covered in spatters of blood.
To the man who is technically his superior — at least in name — Dean replies, “Eat a dick, Henriksen.” To Charlie, he says, “‘
“I’ve never seen the point in talking about them,” Cas says tonelessly. “They’re dead and have been for almost ten years now. There’s nothing else to say.”
Hey Cas,
Dean steps over his husband to retrieve the configuration. It’s closed again, as if the Cenobites shut the door behind themselves. But not quite, ‘cause now there’s a tiny snag on the otherwise polished surface, and Dean yanks his hand away with a curse when it pricks his skin, blood welling up on the tip of his finger. He watches with morbid fascination as his blood fills in the infinitesimal cracks, tracing the complex relation of the parts. A blood pact; dark magic binding Dean to his word.
“Sure,” Dean says. He forces himself to keep his eyes on her, rather than looking for a hidden camera which would confirm his suspicion that his asshole brother is pulling some kind of prank. “He’s a vampire. He isn’t having an affair with any of these people, he’s just sucking their blood.”
“--I figured since we’re having a sleepover, we should watch movies, eat takeout and braid each other’s hair,” Charlie’s saying, “It’s what Dean would want. Your hair is too short and perfect as it is though, so this will have to do.”
saying is that I believe Castiel has convinced you that he is a vampire.”
That seems to do it, snap Cas out of it, and he catches Dean’s wrist, shoves it back into the pillow, braces his weight against it as he curves himself over Dean’s body. He draws back, thick length of his cock teasing, withdrawing several inches, leaving Dean nearly empty.
Dean’s laugh is a little hysterical as he rises to his feet, “Not a chance, man.”
“Mr. Winchester,” She’s too shocked to be at her full, bitter, judgy self, brown-almost-black eyes wide and disbelieving as she looks between them, “What on earth--”
See? Asshole.
“You mean besides the lack of sleep, the crappy plane journey, and the person who’s copycatting my father’s murders? Yeah, I’m peachy.”
Which he’s thankful for, ‘cause that would
“You’re still gonna tell us about that, by the way,” Benny reminds them, laying down on his sleeping bag.
Dean lives for Cas. And he’d die for him too.
Cas breaks away, panting, pressing their foreheads together. “Wow.”
Now. He’s fallen for this before and that got him Lucifer’d. He’s pretty sure the dick is dead, but Dean knows better than anybody that things that should be dead don’t always stay dead.
Dean takes the cup, his fingers brushing against Cas’. “Thanks, man.”
Dean doesn’t acknowledge the dig, even as it makes him feel exposed and anxious.
Yeahhh, she’s probably not wrong.
Which
“What happened to your hand?” Cas asks, always worried about Dean. It’s a distraction technique, Dean knows, but he’s willing to humor Cas, just this once.
Scrabbling for his equilibrium, Dean scratches out, “Why are you like this?”
“No fuckin’ way, man,” Dean argues over the roof, “You’re a Madeline.”
Dean could’ve left an M&M trail to follow.
“Dean?”
“It’s at the bottom of the lake.”
He was really hoping to make it through the remainder of his sophomore year without having to have this conversation with Cas, rehashing his humiliation.
Her eyes drop to Dean’s abdomen, where his shirt didn’t fall the whole way. His sweats are slung so low that it’s obvious to anyone with a singular brain cell that he’s not wearing anything underneath.
Sorry this is late. I literally forgot how to write. Still not convinced I’ve regained the ability, ‘cause this chapter has been a nightmare, but I didn’t wanna keep you waiting any longer. There’s a possibility the next chapter might be a week late too; it all depends on my brain and 15x20 (#clownnosefirmlyinplace).
Makeshift flamethrower, fuck yeah.
“What should we do?” Charlie asks. “Follow the stream?”
“Not like I need his permission,” Charlie mutters, dipping the brush into the bottle. “So what do you wanna know? I have a bajillion humiliating stories. Like the time that he accidentally had monster guts on him when he met up with a date.”
Cas clicks his tongue. “I already had Gabriel check in there.”
Dean nods. “Yeah. I mean, we can always get a hotel, right? Actually fuck in a bed.”
“Where we settin’ up?” Benny asks over his shoulder at the foot of the porch steps. “Dining room?”
“That’s what you think.”
Dean’s response never makes it past his lips. Because in the next second, there’s a sound. A loud, heavy clunk, like a pipe hitting the ground. It comes from upstairs.
The party goes on. People come up to Dean, people he’s never met, and Dean isn’t wondering if they’re the ones who took a photo of him or wrote the words ‘I’ll never let you go’. He even goes to the bathroom and doesn’t find those same words scrawled in red lipstick on the mirror.
Cas is hooked through in at least a dozen places; Jimmy’s flesh, Cas’ body. Suspended far above the boards, fresh wounds gouge him, tearing him open in his shoulders, his ribs, his buttocks, his calves. He’s nothing but blood and pain, in the throes of excruciating torment.
Cas hisses when Dean presses the soaked strip to Cas’ hairline, above his left eye.
Cas is all over him, biting, licking, sucking, mauling bruises into Dean’s skin. It’s hot, so hot, the possessive manhandling, the determined way he marks Dean up as his, the little overwhelmed thrusts of his hips, devastated and desperate in the exact same way Dean is.
Cas huffs a reluctant laugh. “Yes. I suppose that’s a good way of putting it.”
Each step is taking him further away from Cas, but each heartbeat brings him closer.
“Thank you,” Castiel says and it’s then that Dean notices how tired he looks. He’s still agonizingly beautiful, but there are dark bruises pressed deep beneath his hued eyes, the vibrancy of which somehow seems muted this time around.
But now? Now he knows differently.
Once it’s safe, Benny steps up into the cargo area, and Dean and Cas follow cautiously.
With that in mind, Dean makes a deliberate point of turning to his boyfriend. Their eyes hold; a silent battle of wills:
“Touch me again and I’ll kill you.” And Dean means it, he really does, even if his hand is shaking and he never thought that his first
In addition, if deemed safe, supports known as rock bolts may be used to strengthen the foundation.
He used to never shut up, was teased mercilessly about it by family members who took him and three-year-old Sammy in while their dad left on his never-ending quest to find himself.
Despite Dean’s best intentions regarding his little brother, he keeps pushing the impending visit back. He and Cas are having the best time, and he wants to preserve this moment for as long as possible.
He and Kevin look at each other for a long moment, neither saying anything, just silently wondering the same thing. It’s Dean though, who gives in first, tapping the photo against his open palm as he blurts, “What the
The worst thing he ever did was walk out on Cas.
“So you heard then?”
To Dean’s credit, he’s not willing to bear Balthazar’s nonsense either. “Fuck off, Balthazar.” To Castiel, he says, “Cas…”
“What you always wanted, James. I’m going to become you.”
in the mood.
They might not be running away, but a couple of them are eyeing him warily from beneath flashes of neon strobe lighting. Sitting at the round tables skirting the edge of the club, Dean catches glimpses here and there of cat eyes, red eyes, goat eyes. Pretty much the whole weird spectrum in one place.
He dithers for a couple of seconds, trying to figure out which way Benny is likely to have gone, before he starts to walk, gravel crunching underfoot. His phone is still in his hand, clutched so tight that he can feel the plastic creaking.
Dean needs to talk to Cas. He knows he does, but that brings him back full circle.
, he wants; hanging suspended between guilt and desire on a gossamer string. Dean’s agonized moans only spur Castiel on, and he sinks his middle finger inside, alongside the dip of his tongue. Fucks it in and out a couple of times, breath hot and damp on Dean’s overly sensitive skin, and Dean’s dick is on the verge of causing a scene, jerking with each broad lick of Castiel’s tongue, with each push of Castiel’s finger, smearing tacky pre-come against his stomach.
He steps inside and the door slams shut behind him, lock clicking into place.
It won’t, and she knows it won’t.
There’s a deathly silence that lasts like radiation until Jimmy asks flatly, “How long?”
He closes the office door behind himself, folds his arms across his chest, “The fuck are you doing, Benny?”
As predicted, Ketch slows down and then stops completely when he comes upon Dean.
They skirt around the piles. This time, they need no prompting to sit next to each other on the couch. Dean (gingerly) sits as close as he can without physically crawling into Cas’ lap.
Life continues. But it’s like Dean is just going through the motions, waiting for the next ‘present’, note, whatever. He’s barely a participant in his own existence. He goes where he’s told, turns up to his remaining classes, hands his essays in, phones in his part of the group project.
At least not until they get to the top of the basement stairs. The basement is pitch-black, and something uneasy roils Dean’s stomach. She flips a switch near the doorframe, and some lights come on. They make the darkness a little brighter, but not by much.
Oh. ‘Course not. He’s probably got a harem of donors.
He’s gonna take a picture for Jo; she’ll love this shit.
There. He’s finally said it.
If Ketch hadn’t wronged Dean – staring him down, creeping him out, most likely touching him in the shower that time – then he wouldn’t have been an easy scapegoat for Castiel’s own misguided attempts to grab and retain Dean’s attention. As an awkward sophomore, the most Castiel ever managed was a stilted, off-topic-but-not-quite comment about women with low self-esteem, in the hopes that it might prompt self-realization, but that would have required introspection without self-loathing, which is not one of Dean’s specialties. Not then, as a fresh-faced twenty-year-old, and not now, as a ruggedly handsome thirty-four-year-old.
Not that Dean minds when Cas gets all sweaty and frustrated, because he absolutely doesn’t. Cas is gorgeous at the best of times, but when his flawless skin is covered in a light sheen of sweat, his dark hair sticking up in spikes where he ran his hands through it, his lips the prettiest, most inviting pink and swollen from all the frustrated nibbling?
“Good to know that you noticed
Dean’s made some questionable decisions in his life; he once took on the Big Texan Steak Ranch 72-ounce Steak Challenge, failed, and spent the next seventy-two hours on his bathroom floor. Once, he trusted his brother when he said: “It’s like the prequel to Alien. You’ll really enjoy this movie. It’s gonna be great.”
None of it touches Dean. Not with the way Arthur is staring at him, hope in his eyes like he’s been waiting on Dean’s response to a promposal.
“Come on, we’ve got all our stuff together. Let’s get the hell outta here.”
It’s not even a lie.
After that, they separate to relieve themselves in peace. Nobody goes too far, and as he begins peeing, Dean hears the others nearby; footsteps mashing forest debris, muttered cursing, splashing sounds.
“Stop fidgeting,” Cas tells him, which no. He’s in fucking
Dean gazes down at the container in his hands. He can see that there’s a note taped to the underside of the clear lid, so he unclicks it, pulls it off.
It’s like a more badass Swiss Army knife.
It’s only through sheer force of will that he doesn’t embarrass himself on the second largest pay-per-view event of the year. Dean has fought hard for his spot near the top of the roster; he’s not fucking it up now ‘cause of some shirtless pretty boy and his muscles and tattoos.
that the second he allowed even the tiniest sliver of it to break through that partition wall in his mind, he’d be catapulted all the way back to that dangerous place where Cas is everything and everything is Cas. After years of him and Cas not being together, experiencing all this craziness first-hand again — instead of merely reliving the memories like worn-through film — is breathing air back into his lungs. The last ten years have felt like stasis; stale and a wash of gray, when he could’ve been living his life in color.
“No!” Chef Novak reprimands, snatching the skillet out of Dean’s hand, “What
“Yeah, Benny,” Dean taunts good-naturedly. “You got schooled, man.”
Admittedly, there’s no way they could’ve known how it was gonna go down before it actually did, but if Cas had just swallowed his pride and asked for help, then all this could’ve potentially been avoided. The commission has the power to stop shit like Nick was trying to pull. Whether they would have or not is up for debate, but Dean and Cas could have at least tried that option.
This is some Psycho shit right here.
It’s nothing at first. Just more darkness, but then he hears the cautious steps of a gait he instantly recognizes.
warehouse anyways.
Cas’ eye roll, “The mafia refers to a specific organization, the mob is a catch-all term for any organized criminal enterprise.”
Thankful for the distraction, he doesn’t bother checking the caller ID before he swipes to answer on autopilot, lifting it to his ear, assuming it’ll be his boss, or Sam or Charlie.
,” Dean smarts, sarcastic, because that’s his go-to in batshit situations like this, when his husband is a
Those blue eyes on Jimmy are soft and warm-lit. On his identical twin, Castiel, they’re calculating and sharp.
Dean releases his grip on the vamp, “Just get me a fucking beer, Benny.”
She’s enjoying this far too much.
“How’d you know that was there?” Dean asks, clambering to his feet and brushing soil and dead leaves from the front of his shirt and picking bits of fucking tree out of his pants.
Cas doesn’t answer.
Hook, line, and sinker.
Breath held, he reaches out and twists the nozzle protruding from the base. The gas hisses loudly and, within seconds, the lantern’s twin mantles glare to life behind the glass chimney.
Cas’ lips twitch into a smile as he approaches. He stops a few feet away, those blue eyes sparkling with amusement; a joke that Dean’s not in on. “Hello, Dean.”
Still, it's an added stress they could've done without. Like a car that won’t start when you’re in a hurry for something, or when McDonald’s runs out of those little sauce packets.
“No lesbian overcompensates that much,” Benny tells her as he squeezes into the booth next to Dean, curling a huge paw around the beer that’s been sweating since Victor bought it ten minutes ago.
“Cas, I just need…”
, Dean’ll give him that. Like, really handsome. His dark hair is artfully tousled, his jaw sharp with a 5 o’clock (AM rather than PM, obviously, owing to the supposed vampirism) shadow, and his mouth is plush and pink. He’s built, but lithe — like he runs — and he’s a lot younger than Lugosi’d been back in the day.
Not who he is. Not who Cas sees -
“You know, fifteen years ago, I would’ve punched you right in your smug fucking face,” Dean tells Balthazar. “But now I have a family, a career, a
By the time Dean and Cas have caught up, Charlie is busy ushering Garth and Benny into poses, facing away from the hotel. She shoves Dean and Cas into position and tells them, “Pretend that you still like each other and that a single touch won’t have you collapsing into each other’s arms like old times.”
Worded in that way, it’s pretty crappy, yeah.
“He was fine,” Dean lies. “And if you’re tryna insinuate otherwise, then that’s on you, man. I’m not sure where you’re going with all this, but it’s not gonna make me forget what you did to him. Not at all.”
Dean’s pretty sure that it’s far too late for Cas’ immortal soul anyway. Gay sex aside, if Dean remembers his Bible correctly, murder is also a pretty big no-no. Committing murder with your boyfriend? Yeah, that’s a first-class ticket downstairs.
happy to take perverse pleasure in using his puritanical father’s house as a base of gay-sexytime operations whenever he’s in the country. It mostly manifests as the two of them fucking on every surface — horizontal, vertical, and everywhere in between — then hiding like naughty teenagers in the attic when the maid comes around, probably wondering why too many of the household surfaces are a little crunchier than usual.
“That’s right,” she says, dabbing at her eyes. “He certainly doesn’t do that...
“Subject is getting angry that the dean is taking a long time to die.”
right though. He’s not thinking things through, too blinded by emotion and visions of the worst-case scenario. Anxiety and panic are the absolute worst things to lean into during this kind of situation. He screws his eyes shut, trying to shove through the crowded thoughts in his mind to get to a place where things are less fogged by fear.
could sum up this entire experience, really. As well as ‘bugfuck crazy’. ‘Cause, what the hell was Garth thinking, dragging them all up here?
“So, let me get this straight. Heaven and hell are essentially competing businesses that fight for market share on a product, which just so happens to be human fucking souls. Hell has decided that they’re sick of losing, so now they’re planning to corrupt souls not in accordance with the rules of free competition. If we stretch this corporation metaphor even further, then there’s got to be some kind of body that monitors them, right? An ombudsman or something?”
“I honestly can’t remember,” she admits. “I was starting to fall asleep. He might’ve been wearing it, he might not have.”
“Pretty sure we just did it, Cas.” Dean grins, and he can feel Cas’ smile against his skin.
On unsteady legs, but bolstered by the fact that the campus is teeming with people at this time of day, and that he has Cas entirely on his side, ready to bloody his knuckles on this guy’s nose again, Dean slowly approaches him.
The three of them start off toward the forest again, hurrying down the steep driveway, Dean praying to an entity he doesn’t believe in that Cas and Benny are okay. They reach the edge of the trees, right where they’d all followed Cas just a couple hours ago. It feels like Dean’s aged thirty years since then.
He’s still winded and wheezing for breath, so he doesn’t really get far before Nick’s on him once again, gun to the back of his head, shoving Dean’s face into the grit, and Dean squeezes his eyes shut. Thinks of Cas, of Ben, of Sam, of Charlie. Fuck, even Bobby, the crotchety old bastard.
Because he’s still keeping his eyes open for the creeper, just in case he pops up in front of him like a shitty jumpscare, Dean isn’t paying much attention to his own door. He stumbles backward into their dorm and only turns his back on the hallway when he hears a hissed, “S
"Okay, Castiel. We'll take care of Nick for you. Consider it a wedding present."
“Jesus fucking Christ, Cas.” He breaks their kiss on a breathless shudder-pant, already shivery and needy, ready to come. “You gotta fuck me.”
Horns, feathers, spikes, nuns, priests, saints, sinners — it’s all here.
He’s across the room in record time, but stops at the door to give Cas a few precious seconds to object, to ask Dean not to leave.
“Yeah, but if you’re claiming something as a trope, then you
“I’d like to see Merlin,” Dean tells him over the pounding bass.
So Dean braces himself for the argument.
Cas’ eyes are glittering black when he finally looks up at Dean. It makes Dean shiver all the way to his dick.
“Well, I’m not."
Dude, I’m really sorry, okay? I shouldn’t have done that. Can we please just go back to how things were?
Dean:
“Cas,” he manages, dropping his damp forehead to the sweat-slick curve of Cas’ collarbone, burying his face in Cas’ pulse. He’s so
occasionally slow on the uptake and probably just now realizing that dragging them all to their deaths includes his.
The kiss is hurried and desperate, years of pent-up aggression and lust poured into the way their mouths move and the insistent way Cas shoves a thick thigh between Dean’s, making Dean break the kiss on a needy pant. “Cas, fuck.”
So. Dean has a freakin’ castle.
That has Cas unfolding and turning over.
Of course, at that time, Castiel didn’t know about Arthur Ketch’s staring or about the groping incident, but he certainly made Ketch pay for it in the end.
They’d been in such a rush when they’d stumbled into the room that Dean barely got an impression of the place beyond the crisp white duvet, the eggshell blue walls, the classy-and-functional style of the Scandinavian furniture. He gets a good eyeful now though as he looks around at every nook and cranny rather than meeting Cas’ steady gaze. As he pretends to take a specific interest in a particularly fascinating lamp, Cas’ intensity gets a touch too weighty and Dean folds beneath it like he always does.
Dean doesn’t know which came first: Jimmy looking like he does those things because he does, or doing those things because he looks like he does.
“Well, what’s the plan? Benny said something about us all leaving?”
“Smart woman,” Dean says, and means it in more ways than the obvious.
Dean’s not exactly firing on all cylinders here.
Dean might not be able to see Jimmy’s face in the darkness, but he can pick out the quiver in his voice when he says, “Him, I expect this betrayal from. But you?”
Dean hums his agreement. “Right? Very proactive. Well, I liked him straight away.”
Sex hair???
And no. No, Dean is not. Dean will
“You not gonna introduce me to a fellow horror aficionado?” Benny calls out to her, eyes on Dean with an intense sort of focus. There’s humor in his voice at the idea of their little club of scary-movie obsessives, but it’s not mocking. More like worn-in fondness.
Dean feels like the belle of the brawl.
Meg finds him as he’s nursing his sixth...
Castiel’s on his feet in double time, pen angled in his palm like a knife, “They must have more money than sense then; I agreed to kill you for our standard rate,
Dean plays along, removing his hand just enough so that Nick can hear “Forty minutes?” He says to Cas, knowing that Nick is listening at the other end of the phone, “There’s no way we can make it back in time.”
Outside of a skin flick, Dean’s never seen so much flesh on display. The place has more breasts and rump than a meat counter, and Dean tries to avert his eyes as he and Cas push through the crush of gyrating bodies on the main dance floor, but it’s impossible. Between the chick in the latex Snow White outfit grinding up against a wiry dude in a full gimp suit, and the nearly-naked-save-for-a-few-well-placed-chains girl swallowing fire, Dean doesn’t know where to look.
Dean absolutely, resolutely does not smile. “You’re an asshole.”
“The following contest is scheduled for one fall…”
Dean’s eyes follow the jogger as he passes by, looking over his shoulder, trying to memorize the way his sweatpants cling to his ass, the way he runs, graceful and steady, like he’s got all the time in the world (but only for those who like silent German expressionist horror films.)
“Can you climb that?” Cas asks, gesturing upwards at the stone wall to their backs. It’s at least eight - perhaps nine - feet tall.
Dean pushes off into a run. He bolts across the lot, past the car and the shattered glass. He’s still fifty feet from the bottom of the porch steps when he glimpses a flash of red hair.
Dean:
Dean hesitates. It would be so easy. After all, this is what he did to Cas, right? Attacked him when he was vulnerable.
And then, to add insult to
Dean trades glances with Charlie, who’s wedged in the backseat between him and Benny.
And not just ‘cause Dean hasn’t been kissed like this in years, but because Castiel is everywhere; so firm and insistent, bleeding body heat all over him as he angles Dean’s head exactly where he wants it.
“Cool,” Dean says, still not looking at his roommate.
Cas feels alive in here somehow. Probably because his DNA is all over this room; his blood sweat, tears, semen. In fact, he hung Dean by the handcuffs still dangling from the beam to the left of where Dean is sitting right now, and came all over him in thick stripes; his back, his thighs, his feet.
Dean feels sick. And it has nothing to do with the weird fish egg thing on a cracker that he ate earlier in an attempt to be cultured. He stuffs the phone back into the purse as he glances around, but nobody is coming over to yell at him for looking through stuff that he shouldn’t be looking through.
“These were on the doorstep,” Cas says. “No card. There is a photo though.”
Back in the ring, he clotheslines Duke and knocks him down to the canvas. Rather than going for the pin, he struts over to Toni, leaning on the top rope above her to flirt. She responds as she’s supposed to; coy and bashful, but definitely interested. It gives Duke enough recovery time to rip Dean away and lift him straight into a suplex. The impact rattles his teeth and whilst Dean’s laying there on his back staring up at the arena lights, getting his breath back, Duke and Toni act out an explosive argument.
Ogling his lover in his husband’s body like this is fucking Dean all the way up; making him both teary-eyed and horny. The former, because having Cas back is exactly what Dean wanted, and seeing Cas inhabit the same skin that Jimmy was ashamed of reminds Dean of the freedom in acceptance of who you are. The latter because, well, it’s dirty-bad and
Jo’s out on Tuesdays. Dean could probably go to Charlie and Garth’s, crash on their couch, but he’s feeling a little insane, a little fucking reckless, a little let’s-throw-caution-to-the-wind tonight.
As he steps inside the elevator and presses the button for the fifteenth floor, Dean reaches into his front pocket for his cell. Cas’ text is on the screen when he unlocks it.
“Yes.”
She’s never known any different; her world has always been steeped in destruction and disarray. It’s a way of life for her, and it’s who she is. She’s never had someone else to want to be better for.
Cas smiles fondly, the edges of his glance soft. “I’d heard that story at least five times before. And probably another five times after.”
Dean inhales sharply when he catches sight of Ketch in his periphery, jogging toward him. Crouched in the middle of the path on the narrow stretch of trail, pretending to tie his shoelace, Dean studiously focuses on making himself look as distracting as possible, which ain’t all that difficult in the criminally tight running shorts Cas persuaded him to wear.
Dean’s not safe anywhere.
after all, and this is the 1914 Christmas game of soccer in World War 1. As soon as they’re done here, all bets are off again and Dean cannot
“It’s that bad?”
The moment stretches on, the truth pulled taut right before it snaps. Dean’s certain Cas isn’t gonna answer until he does, carefully picking his words out of the glittering shards of his psyche. “As I said in the message I left you, I found the box. At a flea market in Düsseldorf. I was still planning to sell it to that buyer. I came back here fully prepared to ask you to leave my brother, to come with me. Once I sold it, I thought we could be together. I’d have more than enough money—” Cas cuts himself off and Dean’s stomach swoops out. He’s heard this from Balthazar, but Cas telling him his intentions directly is something else entirely. “I know we agreed that we were going to experience it together, but… I’m glad now that I decided to try it alone, because what they did…” His voice falters. He takes a beat, two, three, to try again. “My biggest mistake was assuming that my definition of pleasure overlaps with that of the Cenobites.”
“Dean?”
Beyond the shuffleboard court, there’s some kind of long wood-and-glass structure. It’s way off to the left, far enough from the hotel that it wasn’t visible from the front when they drove up. It’s close to the line of the woods at the northern side of the lawn. Several flagstone paths converge around it.
Cas pulls away, satisfied. He cups Dean’s jaw, dragging the flat of his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip, before pulling away and sucking the taste of them into his own mouth.
“Traumatized by what?” Benny asks, coming straight in as usual. Except this time, there’s no pizza, ‘cause it’s still early, but he
Dean flips through the picturebook of his life, slowing down when he gets to the latter pages with Cas, flashbulb memories hurriedly and haphazardly glued in because their time together has always been limited. It’s them in hotel rooms, at the carnival, downstairs in the kitchen a half-hour ago. He’s terrified of putting himself through the agony of what Cas went through — getting torn apart over and over again until the end of time — but he’s more terrified of a world without Cas in it.
Occult clubs are notoriously difficult to get into; people love the
anything, never was. "One that’s coming in pretty useful right about now,” Dean tells them all. “So unless you don’t wanna watch this movie, I suggest you all shut the hell up.”
Dean answers without thinking. "Like being married to a real-life Ned Flanders.”
‘Cause comfortable is one thing Dean’s not. If anything, he’s pretty un-fucking-comfortable right now. His dick, which had been beginning to get the ‘go the fuck away’ message before Cas invited him over here is back on the ‘sexytimes, yes?’ train.
“Here,” Benny says, lowering his bags. “Let me try.”
It’s not a difficult mentality to find within himself and settle into. It should probably scare him more than it does.
Back in the hallway, the light flashes like firework explosions, coloring the walls in too-bright shades of blues and reds and yellows.
Dean has never been more proud of — or attracted to — his roommate.
Garth claps, delighted. “Ohh, Castiel, pulling one out of the archives there with Hellraiser 3!”
Saving them from having ‘the talk’ with Charlie, Garth mercifully appears, stumbling in from his bedroom. He looks a mess with bags under his eyes, and bite marks all over his neck, like he’s been attacked by an overzealous leech.
Yeah, Dean’s the one who feels sliced open with his innards spilling out between his fingertips.
Dean scrambles to obey, rolling over onto his stomach, burying his face in the pillow. There’s a long moment of nothing and Dean’s skin tingles, breath hot and humid in his face as he breathes into worn cotton.
Dean tries to brace himself for something like that.
Cas is in his own single bed, but he’s not the only person in it. There’s a brunette girl, who is being particularly space-conscious by lying on top of Cas. The pair of them are shirtless, and although Dean’s watched a lot of porn that starts this way, this scene is doing nothing for him.
You’re telling me! According to your item location thingy on one of your listings, you’re in Pontiac, Illinois? Definitely a shame that you’re not closer - we could’ve started a book club!
The intensity lifts off of Dean just long enough for him to take a sip of air. Those eyes move to Benny briefly, sharp and calculating but ultimately disinterested before they find their way back to Dean, compelled and with the heated focus of someone scared that the thing in front of them is a mirage.
Cas’ smile is beautiful. More beautiful than anyone receiving an invitation to watch people get brutally hacked to pieces should be. “Sounds good.”
“Show me your suit,” Castiel orders hotly between one kiss and the next. “I want to see it. Show me what you’re going to look like when you promise yourself to my twin.”
“Why are you smiling?” Cas challenges, voice a soothing liquid silk that Dean has learned the hard way is more dangerous than his commanding, pissy tone. His footsteps come to a halt to Dean’s right, near his shoulder. “I must not be doing my job properly.”
beer of the night, feeling sorry for himself. He’s sitting in the quietest part of the house, at the bottom of the stairs with a velvet rope and typed sign that marks this end of the hall as off-limits. She sashays up to him, all casual, like they’re best buds or some shit. It rubs Dean the wrong way instantly.
Dean appreciates the irony, but, "Are you nuts? Do you have any idea how long all that took me to dig up and plant? Nope, no way.”
He hasn’t eaten since the donut this morning, because he’d figured that he and Cas would get a pizza tonight and work their way through Dean’s metallurgy revision and Cas’ constitutionalism stuff.
On that aspect, they agree.
The creature howls again, backing up, but there’s nowhere for it to go. The can in Dean’s hand gets cooler.
Without missing a beat, Kevin says, “Sources vary, but most place it around eleven to thirteen miles.”
The night after is the same.
He can’t wait for their future. He already knows that it’s gonna be amazing.
do and what he’s
At least until Charlie asks, “So, what are you guys gonna do over the summer?”
Still panting, he peers into the water. Benny’s nowhere to be seen. The lake has a clean, glass-like surface, undisturbed, reflecting the moon, completely sinister in its tranquility.
What the hell. So Cas was accused, but let go? The dates add up to almost three years of investigation, which means Cas was seventeen by the time he was finally allowed to live life without worrying about getting picked up by the cops for the deaths of his parents.
Dean grins up at his husband through bloodied teeth.
Which is why it’s kind of a big deal that Castiel called him beautiful. “Pretty” comes with a leer and gravel-pitted knees, but “beautiful” comes with reverence and intrinsic value.
They’ve managed to steer clear of that wreckage-waiting-to-happen in the last week, and tonight, Dean decided to study at the room for once, rather than retreating to the library or Jo’s. Mostly ‘cause he’s not trying to give his secret admirer the opportunity to take more photos of him.
Jimmy turns in place, surveying the room, gaze sticking on the slim vibrator Cas made Dean come untouched on three times in a row. “Or
“Was?”
“I’m not a killer,” Dean says. Even though for fifty thousand, he might be.
For all the money Crowley had, he lacked taste - as evidenced by literally everything in his house and this casino.
The key is to improvise.
, right?
In lieu of literally
“How do you know about all of it? Has he admitted it?”
They fuck bare and hard, the two of them dripping rainwater all over the kitchen, Cas in his stolen body, using his twin’s cock to fuck Dean deep and dirty. Violent pleasure shudders through Dean with every smack of Cas’ pelvis against the meat of his ass, every core-deep drive inside, shoving time and again up against Dean’s prostate with bone-jarring accuracy.
Dean briefly considers lying to his boyfriend, but that’ll set an unfortunate precedent, and the one person he never wants to lie to is Cas. “Meg,” he answers.
“Right. But the main thing is that they can’t remember anything afterward.”
“Oh,” Dean manages, dry throat clicking. “Good?”
The bartender acknowledges Dean with an incline of her head, so Dean straightens up again, knocking the guy’s hands away in a move that could be accidental if the other person doesn’t know any better.
Finally locating the ability to think beyond his own damage and dick (unsurprisingly, the two often go hand-in-hand,
The disdain is almost a physical thing in Jimmy’s voice as he goes over to inspect the items piled up around the mattress. Thanks to the light from the hallway, Dean can see the blush staining his husband’s cheeks as he hums and tuts his disapproval at the range of sex toys.
Behind him, Dean hears what he hopes are the others. The sound of snapping and rustling comes closer, feet crushing foliage. “Dean!” Charlie calls out, and Dean reaches for the flashlight to shine the beam around to indicate precisely where they are.
He’s definitely hoping for the latter.
“You’re hilarious. Hey, does this mean that I’ll finally get my freakin’ hotel in Vegas too?”
— or whether it’s because Jimmy is tip-toeing around the edges of Dean’s (supposed) trauma.
“Ouch.” Jo actually winces.
When he’s finished — eggplant and peach emojis next to his name and all — he tosses the phone back to Cas, who catches it with both hands, the dexterous fucker.
Near the north end of the lake, there’s a narrow outlet. The glassy water reaches north-west at least a hundred yards before it vanishes under a field of reeds and lily pads.
“Does it matter?” Dean asks, shoving open the door for Jimmy, who shoots him a dull look. “Go on.”
Dean never suspected any different, but it still sucks to hear.
As the darkness begins to creep in around the edges of the day, stealing away the light, the five of them make an executive decision to return to the car, get some food and the flashlights, and take a vote on whether they’re gonna at least spend the night.
been through it and so maybe, just maybe, they deserve to reap some of the reward that selling the box would bring them. They could go anywhere, be anyone with that kind of money.
you more days of the week?”
“So what now?” Dean asks, focusing on keeping his voice level. “Where the hell is he?”
“So, what happens when the gates open? How close to opening are they?”
“Will she become a vampire now?”
It moves surprisingly quickly for a thing that shouldn’t be and Dean manages to back up out of the way in just enough time to avoid pin-sharp fangs, but he’s not quite spared a hefty inhale of its sewer breath; putrid urine and swampy feces.
Obviously they don’t have any weapons - Dean might be able to make use of the ballpoint in his pocket on one of these geriatric stereotypes, but that won’t get them far. The doors are guarded and the whole place has cameras covering every inch. There’s no way they’ll be Oceans Elevening their way outta this one.
Cas and Dean carry the huge cooler between them, Benny shoulders the cases of water and beer, Charlie gets the toilet rolls, whiskey and vodka, and Garth carries the snacks, the flashlights, and everything else aside from the BBQ; they leave that in the trunk for tomorrow.
Dean’s not gonna suggest that Cas could always not have jumped him at all, ‘cause they both knew it was coming (heh). And Dean very obviously enjoyed himself.
. He's barely even touched the burger Dean brought him, now that he's finally getting his appetite back.
He’s not sure what to do. Does he get out? What happens if it
. Promised her that tonight was the night that he would kill Dean.
Thankfully, so far, Nick hasn’t deigned to crawl out of the woodwork, and Cas has made sure that all family members and friends are sufficiently protected without a break in their routine. It has meant a diversion of resources, but they both agreed it’s an extremely important one. Lisa, Matt, and Ben are under Gabriel and Jack’s watch, Amelia and Claire are under Balthazar’s. Fortunately, Sam, Charlie, Jess, Dorothy, and Madison were happy to house-sit for Cas and Dean on their trip to Vegas (which they’re taking under the guise of needing a pre-wedding break) and are otherwise watched over by various henchmen.
Exiting the pool building, Dean can no longer see Benny.
After tonight, Dean totally believes it.
He never considered himself that kind of dumbass. But today is a day for unfortunate revelations apparently, because a group of five friends driving through the middle of the woods is right up there with death by sex and chainsaws in the pantheon of horror cliches.
Cas looks up at him. “The tires have been slashed.”
“Which one?” Deepthroat asks as the Chatterer approaches Dean. “Your husband or your lover?”
Over the years, Dean’s found himself subconsciously judging people who’ve had an easy life, people who’ve never experienced any real adversity. How can you really know who you are until you’ve been stripped bare and had to face the darkest parts of yourself?
“Good.”
One shot is all it takes, and suddenly Dean has freckles of blood alongside the caramel ones that Castiel has counted from every angle over the past fourteen years.
“Benny?” he calls out, then adds under his breath, “Where the fuck are you, man?”
. You disappeared together.”
house,
He walks past the toilet stalls to the gym-like changing area. Steam drifts in from the shower room. There’s a single robe left on the bench.
, ‘cause he probably didn’t need it anyway.
The more Dean posits and rambles, the more unfortunate, fucked up sense it all makes.
Sam makes a disgruntled noise behind his duct tape and Dean doesn’t even look at him. Damn fool ruining all the good work that Dean’s being doing here.
Fuck.
Educational too, ‘cause with Cas, he’s learning new things about himself. He likes to be forced to his knees when it’s Cas doing the forcing, he likes to be told he’s a good boy when it’s Cas doing the telling, he likes to go all pornstar foamy with his spit when it’s Cas shoving his cock past Dean’s gag reflex.
There’s something pure in the way Cas turns that homicidal gaze on him, something violent and
As far as he knows, Cas is strictly into girls, but Dean thought the same thing until he was confronted with Josh Adams and his thick biceps in tenth grade. If Jo’s right, then Cas will be relieved that he can finally give up the charade, and they’ll wear themselves out with all the sex they’ve deprived themselves of in the last nine months.
“I don’t have any popcorn on the stove,” Dean tells her, “nor am I Drew Barrymore.”
The intense white that fills the room is too bright for Dean, and he shields his eyes instinctively, giving them a moment to adjust and mentally prepare for what the light is gonna reveal.
“It isn’t?” Dean forever admires Cas’ sense of direction with this place. He still routinely finds himself losing his bearings. Which is of course, a great source of amusement for Ben and Claire (and even Cas on occasion).
Dean’s just thankful that the thing is blunt, because otherwise he’d be getting hauled away for murder right now.
This chapter is 50% smut, 25% suspicious behaviour, 15% foreshadowing, 10% fluff ;)
“Oh.” Disappointment colors her tone. “Yes, yes of course. Marriage is sacred and, like you said about your parents, no matter what happens, those who are bound before God will always be so.” And then because she can’t help her petty self, she adds, “Even if one party isn’t deserving of such a commitment.”
He lets Jo pull him off the floor, deliberately making it more difficult than it needs to be in order to punish her for being sensible. But eventually, he’s up and sitting on the edge of the bed.
Instead, he swallows hard and nods. “Yeah. Yes.” Against every instinct in his body except the urge to protect Cas, Dean steps into the attic, putting himself between the Cenobites and the man he’s willing to go to hell for. “I found Castiel.” He gestures to the body.
They drink far too many beers together and Castiel feels his tongue (and morals) getting loose.
Victor studies the dark-haired guy with green-blue eyes who has been not-too-subtly staring at Dean all night. “That kid is definitely a Prentiss fan.”
Lips parted on something he’s battling within himself to say, Cas settles on silence instead, pushing himself up and away, and this time, Dean gets to watch him as he walks to the ensuite bathroom.
No, he and Cas will figure something else out before that happens. They have to. One thing at a time.
Benny, Charlie, and Garth turn up after the ceremony, having already attended theirs earlier in the week.
booked a room for something like that.
“Hello, Castiel,” Dean mocks, mirroring his ridiculously deep voice. As predicted, the audience laughs. In his periphery, he catches a glimpse of Duke staggering to his feet, and he’s supposed to pretend not to see, so he ignores it in favor of focusing on the man in front of him. In his normal voice, he adds, “What the hell are you doing here? Run outta ways to get your ass handed to you on your quaint little wannabe wrestling show?”
“The creepy guy across the hall? Arthur something, the one you thought was doing all the stalking? He’s missing.”
live around here?” Benny asks quietly, as if afraid to raise his voice in the stillness.
Rage bubbles to the surface, pure and undiluted. The kind of unseeing anger that pushes the bounds of all rational thought. The kind that ends in blood and tears.
(Luckily it’s only a paperback).
there a cure? Is he gonna start eating brains? Should I chain him up?”
They lie there in a pleasant, holy-shit-did-we-just-do-that-and-during-work-hours-too silence for a little while. Until it becomes too much and too heavy for Dean to bear, because holy crap, this has been a
Cas squeezes, punching the air out of Dean. “Stop overthinking this.”
"Nothing,” Dean answers, “'Cause Chronzons are desert dwellers."
Dean’s sticking with the odds. Sure, it’s possible Jimmy’s spoken to Balthazar. But is it probable? Nah.
“Nothin’, I’d gain nothin’. So, yeah, alright, I had a thing for you in college. Maybe even now, but that has nothin’ to do with how I felt about you and him together.”
“Garth?” Dean says, “Dude, you’ve got the tiebreaker.”
to split hairs. It’s the difference between an ex-boyfriend and a boyfriend being the murdering psychopath. This shit matters, dude.”
Dean hates parties.
?” He spits his twin’s name like he’s sucked out the poison of it from a wound.
Forcing himself to let go of Benny, allowing him to push Dean’s arm away from his throat, Dean lays on his back whilst Benny disentangles their limbs.
Dean and Cas stare at each other.
“Dean,” Cas growls, throaty and low, and it’s a warning.
Vampires are always in vogue though, which is why Benny is never short of a warm body in his bed.
Now. If you were a loser holding onto the past, wouldn’t you go for the one that had the same color as your ex’s eyes in the title? ‘Cause Dean’s no expert on how the creeper operates, but he thinks that’s standard protocol.
But, Dean
Though, before tonight, would Dean have listened without deleting?
It makes no difference to Dean who’s on babysitting duty, as long as
— very religious; it was impossible to talk to them about it. I kept my sexuality to myself so I could continue being part of a family who unknowingly hated my very existence.”
It’s an unconvincing lie to say the least, but Dean magnanimously lets it slide.
How it really is just the two of them against the world.
was to make Dean understand that he isn’t interested.
Nah. Benny would’ve said something by now, if he knew anything. He’s just seeing how close they are and figuring it’s unhealthy.
It is. And this warehouse has been making him money for the past six days rather than for Cas and Dean. Giving this one up and starting anew across town is a small price to pay for getting rid of a pain in their ass though. Even if they haven’t been able to actually start over there yet - couldn’t risk Raphael finding out and reporting back; it would’ve ruined everything.
But he pushes all that shit down, lets Cas use their last undergrad summer to heal him, lets Cas fill in the spaces between the jagged pieces of him with his love.
Dean’s not following this telenovela line of logic.
Maybe Castiel is a dude that Dean’s pissed off on another one of his cases and Daphne is his little helper.
"Why are you answering a question with a question?"
Palm over his chest, Cas announces to the bedroom of arguing kids and concerned husband, “I can’t feel my heartbeat.”
“It’s an old house, Jimmy,” Dean mutters, feigning disinterest, even though his heart is racing faster than a decathlon sprinter. He flips another page a little too quickly. “Things creak and shift.”
Which is when he feels a hand on his body — his ass, to be precise — that definitely isn’t his.
In the fathomless, death-defiant way Cas stares at him, Dean can see his boyfriend shoving him face-first down into the crinkle-crunch of leaves. Can feel Cas impaling him, balls to ass, on the first drive in and making Dean scream, clawing at forest soil and grave dirt, as Cas ruthlessly fucks him with just the spit on his dick next to the open-casket funeral of the guy they just killed.
), it’s all been pretty straightforward and vanilla, but this,
“I have a sliver of grace left. I haven’t forgotten all of my angelic tricks. It just took me a while to get to grips with them.”
The main problem with conducting experiments on university property is that anyone and everyone in the medical school has access to the morgue. Which is where Castiel is currently waiting for his beautiful boy to do something other than blink and shape his mouth around silent words.
Still. Maybe things aren’t as broken between them as he’d initially feared. At the very least, their friendship is salvageable. Which is more than Dean could’ve hoped for, really.
Dean’s breathing too loud. He has to be.
On the TV, a busty woman cheerily reminds viewers not to forget the vanilla extract. Dean sips at the coffee made by his husband. It’s slightly too bitter, just like it always is, but it barely registers on his Richter scale of earth-shakes; he’s too distracted by planning his next victim for Cas.
“I’m stronger now,” Cas says, appearing from the shadows, allowing Dean to get his first proper horrific look at the man he loves. There’s ripening layers of muscle over cartilage and bone; the map of his veins and arteries is being drawn anew, thrumming with stolen life. The whites of his eyes are crisper, less bloodshot, and his irises are a brighter, sharper blue again.
Cas barrels past him, fierce and single-minded. Dean follows, but not too quickly, ‘cause he doesn’t want to rein Cas in.
Literally,
“Tell me,” Castiel demands, his palm rising up off Dean’s ass again and coming down even harder.
The vehicle is getting closer, small stones pinging off the metal underside, the slow crunch of sand beneath tires.
Not on its own, anyways.
Garth looks around at all their faces in turn, and apparently doesn’t like what he sees. “Aww, come on, guys, it can’t be
As they get closer, Dean can see that the roof of the main porch has partially caved in due to a fallen tree branch, its jagged stub protruding from the mess of broken and smashed tiles.
It’s tenuous at best. ‘Cause, really, Benny could be leading Dean somewhere in order to hurt him like he did Cas. Or worse.
The breath that Castiel doesn’t need to take catches in his throat.
“Dean, what—”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think that this shit was important to you. You’re always joking about our wedding anniversary being every four years and—
“Papers?” Dean finally says, small inflection at the end signaling that it is indeed a question and not a confirmation.
If Dean could transmit intent through his thoughts, Charlie would be dead. Buried in a shallow grave somewhere with nothing other than a single leaf to denote her final resting place. She likely knows this, judging by the almost apologetic smile she sends his way as she fills all their glasses, giving Dean a half-inch more than everyone else.
Cas — forever the brave one in their relationship — snags it out of Dean’s hand, sniffs at it, then takes a cautious sip.
She steps forward and snatches it out of his hand, then retreats. She considers him for a long moment, her eyes darting between the food in her one hand and Dean on the bench. She offers him the tray of syrupy mess.
two hours.
Uh-huh.
Still, it’s hard to feel vindicated when Dean’s the one sitting in front of something the Cypriots exported just to get it the fuck outta their country. Before that, they were probably flinging it across the border at their enemies.
Behind them, Meg scoffs. “If I wanted to hurt him, he’d be dead, mmkay?”
He jams the muzzle of his .45 into her sternum. Her mouth springs open. “Lose the hammer, sweetheart.”
Dean has the flutter of a sooty lash to decide what he’s gonna do before he actually does it. Before he drags Castiel in and kisses him. Before they surge together, Castiel forcing a knee between Dean’s thighs, their mouths fitted together, lips parting and tongues teasing. Chests flush, Dean rocking down onto the firm thigh between his own, Castiel sinks his fingers into Dean’s hair, thumbs digging in under the hollow of Dean’s jaw.
. The jogger beckons toward the cat, fingers outstretched. “Hey, kitty,” he says in a surprisingly deep whiskey-on-the-rocks kind of voice. “I’m Castiel. It’s nice to meet you.”
It’s hot as hell and Dean makes a hurt little noise.
Dean shuffles to face the wall, ending up with his left cheek pressed against the cool surface, feet knocked apart as far as the limitations of his pants around his knees will allow. He squeezes his eyes shut. Behind him, the sound of a belt buckle and a zipper coming apart, the rustle of clothes being discarded. Dean doesn’t move, does his best not to think, just waits, holds his breath, ignores the tell-tale-heart throb of his dick. Tries hard not to hate himself for it.
Dean repockets his multi-tool, shifts the rock to his right hand. Using his left, Dean flicks up the hook. The door swings open, groaning on its ancient hinges.
They pass beneath streetlights, and in their glow, Dean is able to see the fine shape of the jogger’s body underneath those black sweats and shirt.
There's a short pause and Dean's pretty sure even Sam isn't so sexually uptight that he can't figure out what's going on at this end of the phone. He must've had sex at some point in his life, right? He has a kid for Christ's sake. Unless Madison spawned asexually like an amoeba or some shit.
The front door opens.
Inside, after a quick search, they find a couple of quiet study carrels near a window and sit next to each other.
Dean swims to the dock and drags himself out on shaky arms. He flops onto his back with a wet thwap and lies there, staring up at the inky sky, waiting for his breathing to regulate.
Now that shit’s hilarious.
“Yeah. Just need to find out where he lives. Nick said he’s in one of the gated communities. Not my old one, but another.” Even as he’s saying it Dean barely suppresses a shudder. What the fuck was Benny thinking? Trying to relive what he had with Dean, except all alone in an empty house?
“Of course,” Castiel answers distractedly, knowing he’s already got them both.
Dean fumbles his phone out of his pocket. It takes a couple of attempts, because Cas is being less than fucking helpful and his brain is stuck on a loop of
Well, that makes two of them.
Flat on his back, legs in a wide sprawl, the crown of his head almost at the edge of the slab of rock above the rush of water, chest rising and falling with his ragged, pained breaths, Benny makes for a sorry sight with his likely bruised ass and ego.
Dean flips the lid over to read the note.
“This will hurt a little, but I promise you it’ll feel good too.”
He smiles at Dean as he approaches, a soft, knowing thing that has Dean’s stomach turning over.
It’s not like Cas would say no either; he’s practically vibrating with the need to take it out of Dean’s ass, and it’s a cheap thrill but Dean’s pleased that he can still rile Cas up like this. Even though - according to Cosmo and all those girly magazines that Dean has
“Ask if they have any raw meat they use in the burgers.” Remembering his manners at the last second, he adds, “Please?”
Self-inflicted wounds are a fairly common trick. Daphne might’ve made the punctures herself to back up her insane story. Dean’s witnessed weirder (see: dog hair dude).
Oh, fuck. What does he do?
move; all we know is that they’re trying to scare us and prevent us from leaving.”
He’s never felt as alive, as in tune with who he is as a person, as he did with Cas.
“Dean,” Cas says, touching his forehead to Dean’s. “I won’t let them take you, I promise.”
are.”
Dean’s wearing gloves, because of course he is. Cas isn’t, because of course he isn’t.
Taking a deep breath, Dean scrolls until he finds Cas’ number and hits the dial button. He listens to it ring. Just when he thinks it’s about to go to voicemail, the line clicks and he hears Cas’ slightly breathless, deep rumble. “Dean?”
“Yeah?” Dean sneers, but there’s a fine tremor in his hands. He crosses his arms to hide it.
So maybe Cas followed them and lied about it. It doesn’t matter.
He can hear the sly amusement in Cas’ voice, “Does that make you Miss Prissy?”
In his periphery, Dean can see Charlie’s shoulders shaking. Across from him, Cas pulls his bottom lip between his teeth. Benny’s not making direct eye contact with anyone.
If they’re not setting fires, they’re putting them out, and it’s a hell of a lot more appealing than pretending to be interested in Mr. Williams’ petunias or whatever flower he’s perpetually killing through too much over-watering or serenading with the wrong song.
Dean’s strangely grateful for it. When he joined the unit, fresh-faced and eager to atone for the sins of his father, he’d waited for a couple of solved cases under their collective belts before he told them the truth about his bloodstained heritage. There was no negativity — just as Victor who’d known since Dean’s background check had predicted — only compassion and quiet understanding.
“I’m surprised to see you drinking alone,” the man continues. “Someone like you. Woulda thought they’d be lining up ‘round the block.”
“It’s literally
“If it was so traumatizin’, then why’d you keep the multi-tool?”
“Oh, fuck you, Cas—”
It’s not
Dean doesn’t lean into the touch like an attention-starved cat, but it’s a close thing. It’s been so long since he’s had someone touch him like this. Jimmy loves him, sure, but he doesn’t want or need him with this kind of ferocity.
“I want a popsicle,” Dean tells Cas, pushing pushing pushing, always pushing his goddamn luck.
“Is this…?”
glare she sends his way when Dean doesn’t know Jimmy’s blood type for the paperwork.
(To be fair, Cas’ boss is a douche, who’s been giving him shit about selling the Peterson house, even though it’s
“If we’re staying at a hotel or somethin’,” Benny says, “why are we bringin’ sleepin’ bags?”
Still. This just cements Dean’s opinion that the person doing all this has to be someone they all knew back in college. Or maybe an angry relative or friend of Ketch’s wanting revenge? But in piecing it together, they’d have to have known about Arthur Ketch’s crimes, and that would make them just as bad as him, complicit even. Right?
“Would you be cool with throwing a party at your place? Ours is kinda small, y’know?”
to, but he does anyway.
“Can I stay here?” Dean asks miserably. "I'll even let you be the big spoon."
Castiel scowls at her. Her problem with Dean transcends all good sense. As evidenced by this current situation. If she weren’t so easy to manipulate when it comes to Dean, none of them would be here right now.
He briefly considers that this is some kind of trickster prank, but he’s pretty sure that not even Gabriel would be this cruel.
“Creepers?” Easily twice the size of Garth, Benny ignores him entirely and snags a fistful in his bearpaw.
Cas, please message me back, even if it’s to tell me to fuck off.
A stupid prank in the shower is one thing, but this is on another level entirely.
Dean didn’t have the heart to confess that the potential buyers barged past him on his arrival (he and Cas have a long-standing lunch date, and Tuesdays mean pastrami on rye), muttering about a lack of professionalism and an abundance of puke.
“You’re stealing Cas’ listing?”
Dean waits, willing whatever is gonna happen to be quick. Cas’ breathing is fast and ragged, anger and spite and desperation fueling him the same way it’s fueling Dean. Cas roughly drags Dean’s pants and boxers down around his thighs, gets a warm, clever hand around Dean’s dick, and Dean grunts, breath stuttering.
It’s apparent that Dean’s picking his words carefully. “Worried? Yes. Furious? No. Claire came in with hurricane-fresh hair and Jack looked as deer-in-the-headlights as I’ve ever seen him. Once I stopped laughing, they told me what I’m assuming is a truncated version of what happened, and I— Cas—” he cuts himself off. Regroups. “Whatever’s going on with you is bad, right? I know it might feel good or whatever, and I’m not denying that the way you’re grinding up against me right now is all kinds of amazing, and you bought a freakin’ sports car that’s so renowned for being unreliable that it’ll keep my shop open for years to come, but man. It’s scaring the shit outta me.”
