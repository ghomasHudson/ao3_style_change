Oh, and his face. It must be something about the expression on his own—for the first time the arrogant little prick looks just a bit worried, and that’s as good as anything. But that’s not all: guilt, thrill, anticipation, and hesitation battle for dominance across his face, but above all there is surprise at his own daring, like a child. Like he cannot believe he has accessed the Captain’s quarters, and since he has done so he does not care at all about what happens here, so long as he finds out what happens next.
The seventh of Sherlock’s several dozen mistakes: the gunpowder in the cargo hold isn’t gunpowder. There’s no treasure, and the gunpowder isn’t gunpowder. It’s better—it’s valentine.
The crew makes a commotion at the sight of him—seventeen, approximately (hard to tell without his eyes), small for a ship so large. A few of them get their hands on him, and spit lands on his face. But they take a sharp left, Mole pushing at the back of his shoulders, and as they pass through a door, the sloshing of the sea drowns out the sound of the sailors on the other side, their cat calls lost to each other.
every part of Sherlock’s mind says, but he doesn’t say that aloud. Heeding his own better judgment, he says nothing.
Well, it doesn't matter what I thought, maybe. You're gone. But you're a good man, Sherlock. I don't know what happened with Moriarty, and I never will, but I know you have a good heart. I know you. I can say so. Maybe if I say so enough, it'll bring life back to your face, and we can return to our rooms in Baker Street, and you will love me there. You were always a good man, Sherlock: funny, attentive, impetuous, smart as all hell, and a damn good detective. You were still a good man when you were a moody brat. But we covered that already. Just made me want to jump you. Stop burning eggs, asshole.
“Just like you never tried valentine? Never high on your own supply, Captain?” John had no idea if his wild guesswork was close to the truth, but he was enjoying himself, and on a roll, so as far as he was concerned, he had a royal writhing up against a wall.
“He’s here somewhere.” They stood side by side, John sipping his champagne and scanning the guests. He took two large gulps and turned to Sherlock. “Would you like to dance with me?”
says his head again, but he knows that that’s not quite— “I’ll throw you off the ship,” the captain continues, quieter, and a shiver runs up Sherlock’s spine. He wants to press his head to the captain’s thigh, kiss inside his knees, lick at his ankles and arches—“to preserve my reputation, I’ve got a dummy. And you’ll sleep here in my quarters. We’ll put about for an evening in Baker’s Port. We’ll clean you up, and you can be—”
“No.” He crosses in front of him again, and his right hand curls under Sherlock’s chin to lift his head for a better look at his face. The pad of the captain’s thumb presses against the corner of Sherlock’s lip. Sherlock turns his face into his grasp, mouth opening so he can kiss down the side of his strong, weathered, salt-stained hand. The Captain’s breathing goes heavy, low, and the sound fills the cabin. He encourages Sherlock’s attention as he drags his mouth down, inch by inch. Sherlock reaches the pulse point on his wrist and sucks. He moves back up through the center of his palm, flat of his tongue pressing and tasting as he drags his mouth up the line between the captain’s middle and ring fingers. He’s just begun to suck on the tips when the door opens again, and the Captain pulls his hand away as though burned. Sherlock leans forward, chasing after him, but he’s stepped backwards; Sherlock is left in the dark again.
The man—tall, left leg shorter than his right, ginger-bearded, wiry, hardened by experience at sea—is caught off guard. “What are you doing?”
The book is back on! Life is too boring without fiction. Mary invited me to host a local writer's group at Speedy's; we got a small crowd. You weren't mentioned once--see, you're not the center of my life. Nope, my universe expands to include weirdos in a sandwich shop. A paralegal with a fake flower in her hair compared herself to Tolstoy, which was the highlight of my week. I miss running around with you. (That much is obvious.)
“So they say. But what’s the point of skipping your own party if you don’t even need to show your face?”
Kilgore Trout is a failed science fiction writer for whom I hold a great deal of affection and admiration. There is no figure more romantic than the failure, if only because there is little more insufferable than someone who considers themselves a success. In one of my favorite Trout pieces,
Towards the center of the first courtyard, before the small, curling Baobab tree, a person in an elephant mask with long, flowing dark curls stood on a soapbox, giving some sort of lecture. As John drew closer, he heard the stranger say, “and I assure you, Captain Smith has nothing to do with the valentine trade in this area. From what I understand, he’s never even heard of it.”
“Careful.” The sound of his voice goes straight to his stomach. “I still have half a mind to take you over my knee and show you your actions have consequences.”
He’d asked for his mask to be a bit more fox-like than the ottery contraption he ended up with, but, not wanting to seem fussy, he put it on and continued on his way through the throng.
you get the picture. But John had been so eloquent and effusive and ebullient, after all this time, with ample time to ruminate and gather his thoughts and prepare, but if Sherlock did not say something this instant he would boil over, or at least come in his pants, so he said “I… can’t stay away from you. Even when I’m thinking of other things, I’m thinking about you. I can’t stand the thought of losing you so I’ll work on this ship forever and have you in any little way I-ah-can. Oh. I want you more than anything in the world.”
“You really shouldn’t bring up the fact that you dipped into my cargo when you’re trying to talk your way out of it.”
to write a fix-it third chapter; and one morning on the train I was inspired by the thought that Saint Bartholomew the bear should write the epilogue!
Sherlock’s reaction was when he opened the box and looked inside.  There was no obvious sign of anger or annoyance; neither did he seem impressed or pleased.  He seemed to have switched off completely, continuing to look down into the box but not reacting in any way.  When he finally started to lift his head, John couldn’t stand it and surged to his feet and turned away before Sherlock could look at him.
“Yes, yes, why am I here, why do I keep following you around, why am I pestering you, et cetera.  Never mind that.  Invite him to move back in with you.”
He stopped as he ran out of air and stood glaring at his flatmate who was looking at him with infuriating calmness. Again Sherlock opened his mouth but John pointed at him sternly.
reading – and not storybooks either; he prefers anything factual.  He’s read practically every history book we own, even if he doesn’t understand everything, and then he comes and asks us all sorts of complicated questions that we can’t answer.  With your background as a political history graduate, I’m hoping you might be able to help him better than we can.”
“He asked me to keep an eye on you tonight,” he confirmed, “but I wasn’t planning on going out anyway.  Are you okay?”
“You can’t live in this flat for much longer.  If the damp doesn’t kill you, the landlord probably will.  He’s quite cross with you about the damage you’ve done to his kitchen.”
Anderson scowled at him. “’m gonna go and talk to John and Holmes,” he slurred, “and you should come with me, Mike, ‘cause you’re
I’m sure there have been many other fanfics where Sherlock had a much-loved teddy bear, either as a child or later as an adult, but I was watching something over the weekend (I can’t even remember what, now), saw a teddy as part of the background and had a moment of not-very-original inspiration.
I feel about them?” Sherlock demanded. “You threw yourself in front of me to protect me from the explosion in the factory; you were willing to sacrifice yourself, and I won’t ever forgive you for risking your life just for me.  I’m  angry at seeing you so damaged.  Those scars shouldn’t be there. You got them by being more noble and selfless than I could ever be, and they make me feel ashamed.  I intend to spend practically every waking moment ensuring that the rest of Moriarty’s network is taken down so that they’ll never endanger you again.”
be avoiding his nose and teeth. To prevent the imminent violence, he started talking before Sherlock could speak.
On the day that he was given the keys to the flat he realised that he would have no choice but to go to Baker Street and collect the rest of his possessions.  The thought filled him with dread but he steeled himself and phoned Mrs Hudson.  She was tearful during their conversation, especially when he told her that he had found somewhere else to live, but she said that she understood.  He resisted the temptation to ask her to pack up his stuff for him and have it couriered over, and instead arranged to go there at the weekend.
Abruptly he stood up and walked back around the bed, stopping at the foot and turning to face Sherlock again. He was a little reassured to note that Sherlock had turned his head to follow his progress. He looked into the pale face again.
“It’ll be at least twenty minutes, mate,” the dispatcher told him. “They’re all out on jobs at the moment.”
He had been arguing with the tall man with the umbrella for the last fifteen minutes and didn’t seem to be getting any closer to gaining admission into the hospital room. Anderson was becoming increasingly convinced that the man didn’t even work at the hospital, and certainly neither he nor the attractive woman beside him with her eyes permanently locked onto her BlackBerry looked like the usual type of administrative staff to be found at this hospital.
“She was crying so hard I couldn’t do anything but kneel down next to her and hold her. We were down there for ages while she cried herself out. I remember trying to get her up because the hall carpet was really rough on
John would have expected Sherlock to dismiss the girl from his mind while he focussed on the client’s situation, but every time the girl shifted into a new position Sherlock’s eyes would flicker across to her.  John assumed that he was irritated that her movements were breaking his concentration but there was an unusual expression on the detective’s face.  He looked almost ... wistful?  For a while John wasn’t sure what could be prompting such a look.  It was only later when, as part of her quiet game, the girl gently tossed her teddy bear to the other end of the sofa and Sherlock’s gaze shifted accordingly that John realised that it was the bear and not the girl which Sherlock had been watching.
Thirty-seven months since Sarah had realised the truth, confronted Mycroft and had been allowed in on the secret.
to tell people if she wanted to. And I suppose that in a way you helped her a bit, because she was so furious at you that it kept her mind off Teresa for a while.”
Since his enforced return from Afghanistan, John’s life had been pointless, mundane, meaningless. Similarly, the song listed the singer’s daily boring routine and how it had never varied until someone came into their life and changed it for the better.
from the bakerstreet forum, the woman to whom I flogged my spare £45 ticket for 30 quid on the last Friday of the run (I never got her name!) and anyone else who helped the time pass so nicely.
Sherlock’s face was expressionless when he opened the box, and John never saw the contents again.  John wasn’t surprised; his instinctive purchase had been stupid.
Sherlock returned his smile, then looked at him more seriously.  “What do you think?” he asked.  “Would you consider it?”
she had hidden it – what with Sherlock’s sharp observational skills and John’s medical knowledge, maybe they had started to notice but by the time she had so successfully talked them into thinking about their future together, surely they had been too distracted to concentrate on anything other than their own feelings.
Leaning forward and kissing him briefly, he turned and got out of the cab but Sherlock followed him out and put a hand on his shoulder, turning him back to face him.
his beloved London getting closer, he could no longer trust his mind to count off the minutes accurately and by the time they were only forty minutes into the journey he would have sworn that they had been on the train for at least an hour and a half. John noticed him repeatedly looking at his watch and frowning and once the train had entered the Tunnel itself he took pity on him, leaning across the table and murmuring into his ear.
“Who’s going to remember Doctor Watson best once you’re gone? From what I know of the two of you, you spent most of your time with each other, and he told us he didn’t have a very good relationship with his sister.”
She looked at Sherlock.  “He was here this morning,” she told him.  “He seemed surprisingly upset about all this.”  She turned to John.  “He found out about me and had me moved here from the local hospital.  He said he wanted me to have the best treatment, which is very kind of him.”

Traumatic events affecting the inhabitants of 221B result in Anderson finding himself at the local hospital offering to try and help.
“I have a little boy,” Emily told her.  “He’s four years old.  My husband and I agreed that he would be better off with his dad.”  She smiled sadly.  “He’s very much his father’s son and the two of them have always been inseparable.  I miss him a lot, but I knew he would be happier there than with me.  I see him every few weeks, but only at the weekend, so our visits won’t interfere with my work here.”
: A tiny bit of not-very-bad violence, but otherwise nothing to cause any upset, and an adorable video if you stick it out to the end. (How’s that for emotional blackmail?!) (conveniently ignoring the fact that you could simply jump straight to the end ...)
The Land Cruiser finally found a gap in the traffic and turned right and after another bout of indicator-changing, the driver finally settled on turning right as well. “It’ll be busy in the village,” he said happily over his shoulder. “But never mind; we’ll get there eventually.”
“Then I shall stay, dear,” she replied.  She smiled at him, then added, “... provided you get yourself a tissue and blow your nose.”
The train left Brussels at one o’clock in the afternoon and commenced what – to Sherlock – felt like the slowest two-hour journey ever. He had never understood it in the past when anyone said, “This afternoon is really dragging,” or “How did today go so quickly?” Time always moved at the same rate and he didn’t know why some people’s perception of the passage of time should differ. But now that he could almost physically
on the stage but then the lights dimmed and the opening sequence, which each of the girls had separately told him was amazing, began.
Sherlock drew in a breath through his nose and, still mumbling but with a tiny bit more volume, said, “Saint Bartholomew.”
But now he has to disappear; to vanish from the world and leave no trace of himself behind. At long last he has a good reason to change his name, a reason that even his late parents and his oh-so-very-annoyingly-alive brother will understand and forgive him for.
John glanced across the bed at Sherlock, whose face was somewhat flushed.  John suspected that his own was a similar colour, and he silently willed his friend to do something to end this awkward conversation.  Sherlock got the message and he looked at Emily with determination on his face.
Outside the door where he has been standing since the whimpering began three minutes ago, Sherlock clenches and unclenches his fists rhythmically and furiously as he despises himself for not knowing what to do or how to help, and when the muffled sobbing starts he turns and silently retreats to the living room where he paces frenetically until he realises that he has no bloody choice and even though he would rather throw it through the window than do this, he picks up the phone and scrolls through the menu to find the one person who he knows can provide the help he needs and, with his face full of self-loathing, he angrily stabs his finger onto the button which will call his brother.
Sherlock’s shocked inhale was drowned out by John’s embarrassed exclamation of “Jesus!”  Emily sighed heavily.
side of that story about the chase through the warehouse in Battersea where you ended up half buried in dry pasta shells.”
But just before they reached the gates, one of them reached out and slid his fingers into the other’s hand.  The answering clasp felt like coming home.
Sherlock nodded and Emily looked at John.  “The boys’ parents and I had a conversation when Mycroft turned sixteen,” she explained, “and we discussed whether I was really needed any more.  Anyway, the topic never came up again.  I always wondered why.”
“Oh, yes, I remember.”  She looked at the way that John was staring teary-eyed at the bear.  “Do you want to take it with you?”
When John mentioned it after the mother and child had left, Sherlock shrugged off the loss of his childhood teddy bear at such a young age.  However, when they visited the client’s home six days later to help her save her business by giving her the evidence that one of her partners had been siphoning funds from the company, Sherlock’s eyes swept around her living room with more than his usual speculative and deductive gaze.
“Oh, Jeez ...”  John stood up and walked away across the room, his mind racing.  He turned back and looked at his friend.
A request for a repeat prescription of anti-depressants from a mother of two youngsters who wasn’t coping well with parenthood. A long conversation allowing her to pour out her woes, a suggestion that she seek counselling as a better alternative to help her with her troubles, a list of telephone numbers to call ... and a momentary temptation after the patient had left to write out the ‘scrip anyway and fill it for himself.
He hadn’t meant to blurt it out, and now he and Sherlock fell silent.  Eventually John cleared his throat.
knees, let alone hers and she was wearing a short skirt, but she wouldn’t budge and I couldn’t even get her to shift over and sit rather than kneel. And then finally she felt a little bit better and I got her into the kitchen and made tea for us; and later on I got the call to go to Brixton. She wasn’t on duty that night but she asked to come along, to keep her mind busy.”
Now wait a minute: you don’t think I’m implying that Emily Cleary used to be called Mrs Emily Moriarty, mother of James, do you?  Would I do such a terrible thing?
Emily Moriarty and she used to entertain her son during their visits with stories about the bright young boys she was looking after; and when – many years later – she learned what her boy had done with that information, she never had the nerve to tell the Holmes brothers.
“Exactly.  Crack your knuckles and murder the English language when you’re with him, thank you very much, not in this residence.”
Again he tried to tug Anderson away but again the other man resisted him, protesting, “Leave off, guv! I’m talking to Mike!”
“Yeah, and at least Holmes has become a bit more civil since he met Doctor Watson,” said Anderson, still nodding as if he couldn’t work out how to make his head stop moving. “It’s done him good not spending all his time on his own, and he’s obviously got the doctor on the brain these days ...”
Lestrade looked at me anxiously for a moment, then turned back to his colleague who was swaying dangerously from foot to foot. He leaned closer to him and said soothingly, “Yeah, shush now, Steve.”
“Hello,” he says when someone answers at the other end. “I need to speak to one of your reporters, please.”
And then he’s back at school, on his knees in the playground, his books scattered around him where they’ve been dumped out of his bag, and the big boys and their leader are sneering at him while the playground monitor turns a blind eye. He blinks rapidly, determined not to cry, and the fury grows inside him.
the hottest thing in town, you know – you can’t just roll up to the box office and demand tickets. I’ve been sitting in the Returns queue since two o’clock and the desk didn’t open until six and I’ve only just got two tickets. We’re really lucky someone returned them, so get yourself down here quickly: if you’re not here by seven thirty they won’t let you in for the opening sequence, and that’s apparently the best bit of the whole play.”
John blinked against the prickling feeling in his eyes.  Sherlock stepped a little closer and looked at him pleadingly.
“I’m not sure he’d forgive me. I’ve only just got him back in my life; how can I tell him that his wife’s a killer?”
It’s hard being a genius, with a mind that never stops working even when it has nothing to work on. The sheer frustration of knowing he is smarter than everybody around him – that there’s nobody with whom he can spar on an equal level – makes him want to scream with rage sometimes.
Sherlock was already shaking his head and he resumed his approach to the front entrance, John following with his mind racing.  ‘Oh, dear god,’ he thought to himself in horror.  ‘If it’s Mycroft ...’  He couldn’t even finish the thought.  Despite their behaviour towards each other, he knew that the brothers’ public display of bickering hid a much deeper affection and if Sherlock were to lose Mycroft, John wasn’t sure how he would cope.
Anderson shrugged. “D.S. Donovan heard the news from D.I. Lestrade and then rang me and told me,” he said. “I wasn’t entirely surprised to learn that he’d tried to kill himself, and if I know your brother he’ll try again as soon as he’s well enough, only next time he’ll make absolutely sure that he isn’t found in time. I’m
“Couldn’t resist; saw it in a shop window.  If you hate it, it’s no big deal.  You can chuck it out.”
John gritted his teeth and braced himself.  He had only known her for a couple of hours but he had no doubt that this was not the end of the argument.
John smiled.  “Couldn’t resist; saw it in a shop window.  If you hate it, it’s no big deal.  You can chuck it out.”
at you – you left the laboratory three minutes ago and you haven’t stopped smiling since.  You’re scaring people in the corridors.”
Still grinning, he turned back towards his friend, who sighed dramatically. “Yes, John,” he said in resignation. “I’ll find a way for you to talk to
“Yes, dear.  So, get in touch with her very soon, please.  Make it your new year resolution and give her a call.  If you haven’t been in contact with her before the end of January, I shall be very disappointed in you.”
“What the hell ...?” John ran across the room and fell to his knees beside him as Sherlock landed firmly on his backside. Even as John reached for him, Sherlock turned and burped an alcohol-laden breath into his face while beaming cheerfully at him.
“I’m going to kill you,” John told him straight-faced. “You’ve survived all this time, and now I’m going to kill you where you stand.”
“You know that’s not true.  He worries about you all the time.  Call Mycroft.  I guarantee that he’ll come.”
Sherlock grimaced.  “Like I said, it wasn’t my idea,” he said.  “You taught me how to build the various rooms, and one day I found you in one of the sitting rooms, telling me you liked it so much that you were going to stay there.”  He rolled his eyes.  “Then again, you didn’t stay in there much; you kept popping up all over the place and annoying me with your suggestions and comments.”
John’s eyes were wide and his chest was tightening with hope and excitement.  Sherlock kept talking.
She looked at John.  “I don’t remember reading that you chased off after the person who shot Sherlock in Charles Magnussen’s flat.  You might be a doctor but you’re also a soldier and you must have been torn between duty and honour.  Why did you choose to stay?”
“You can’t do this to John.  If you make him believe that you’ve killed yourself, how do you think he’s going to cope?”
For thirty-seven minutes John fretted at the theatre door, wondering if Sherlock was going to throw a wobbly and deliberately arrive late, but his friend finally came striding across the plaza and allowed John to rush him up the ludicrous number of stairs to the entrance to the stalls, Sherlock taking some of them three at a time simply because he could, the bloody show-off, while John stumbled after him, wishing they’d taken the lift instead. The returned tickets were really good seats, four rows from the stage – and
“When you said those things to me outside the house I wanted to punch you so hard for being so presumptuous and for implying that we were having an affair while all our colleagues were listening, but if I had spoken out and corrected you then everyone would have known Sally’s business and it was up to

I think the inspiration for the fic was the fact that, back in 2011 when only Season 1 had aired, nobody else was writing fic which made Anderson a decent person.  There were fics redeeming Donovan, but not him, and as a new writer of fanfiction I was always looking for something different to write about.  I was rewatching
Sherlock looked nauseous but then took a sharp breath through his nose.  Emily didn’t give him a chance to speak.
Basically it’s nearly 3000 words of sadness and misery.  But I love this story.  It’s the one that stubbornly insisted on being written despite me not wanting to.  After the idea had popped into my head – and I had fought it back, telling it, ‘Are you
Sherlock’s gaze had become a little more focussed and less intimidating, and Anderson pressed on determinedly.
It was just over three years since Sherlock and John had been forced to leave their beloved London, but at nine thirty that evening they unlocked the front door of 221B Baker Street and finally came home.
“Is it my fault that your behaviour has upset me so many times that I can barely bring myself to talk about it?  Very well, then: you won’t be able to afford
Only in soppy romantic fiction do people feel a warm glow spreading through their body.  Despite that, John felt a warm glow spreading through his body.  Almost as if he could sense it, Sherlock scowled at him.
“He tries to be like his big brother,” she continued, “and pretends that he doesn’t care about what other people think about him, but I know it’s not true.  The neighbours’ kids don’t like him and won’t play with him unless they’re made to, and it almost always ends with them running away from him or telling their parents that he’s said something horrible to them.  Most of the time he avoids them, but I can tell that he’d like the company.  Like Mycroft, he needs to have his mind kept busy, and so I’ll need you to keep him occupied and not bothering his brother, particularly when he’s doing his homework.”
In all of these scenarios, John is at Sherlock’s side, quiet, supportive, ready to defend him, protect him – or die for him.
“Oh, John.”  Mrs Hudson sat down beside him and took his hand. “It’s all too much for you, isn’t it?”
“Yes, dear.  So you’ll think about it?  If you want to make a career of this detecting lark, you need to make a good impression, both to the police and to your private clients.”
“I’ve thought about this for some time,” he told him.  “It isn’t a spur-of-the-moment thing.  I discussed it many times with Mrs Hudson before we called in the workmen; I talked about it with Molly; I even discussed it with Mycroft – you can imagine what
“The spare bedroom next to yours is being redecorated and made child-safe,” he continued.  “Again, even if you don’t move back, you could stay over sometimes if you want to, or Mrs Hudson could babysit if we have to go out on a case and Rosie could sleep upstairs.  The furniture is arriving on Thursday.  Mrs Hudson and Molly helped to choose it.”
“So tomorrow night you two go off hunting for some villain,” she said, “and you find him ... in his lair surrounded by a moat full of crocodiles and with a thirty foot wall with barbed wire on the top and trap doors all along the ramparts ...”
“I don’t even want to know what’s causing the stink in here. All I want is for you to add it immediately to the list of items banned from this flat, and that when you find something equally foul-smelling to replace it as you inevitably will, you
“Spoons are boring,” he told him as he stalked slowly towards him, herding John and his dessert gently backwards towards the bedroom. “And only unimaginative people would eat something like this from a
Twenty months since John and Sherlock had tracked down James Moriarty in Italy and had ended his reign as the world’s only consulting criminal. Twenty months since they had realised during his interrogation that he had a much larger network of lieutenants than they had hoped, and that each one of them would need to be found and dealt with before they could safely return home and let the world know that they were alive.
Sherlock nodded, taking off his coat and hanging it on the back of the door.  He turned and looked around the room again, seeming uncertain what to do next.  Eventually he wandered over to the coffee table, picked up his scarf and gloves and returned to the doorway to stuff the latter into his coat pockets and hang the scarf over the top of the coat.  He stood there for several long seconds, absently smoothing the coat down for no apparent reason, then turned towards his armchair before grimacing and turning back to face the kitchen.  John suspected what he might do next.
John moved out of Baker Street shortly after Sherlock’s funeral.  Returning home after the ceremony, he took off his jacket but then couldn’t bring himself to sit down in the living room.  After pacing ceaselessly around the flat for more than fifteen minutes, clenching and unclenching his fists, he went upstairs to his bedroom, changed out of his formal suit into jeans and a jumper, packed a holdall with a few clothes and toiletries and then rang Greg Lestrade.
of us is an annoying sod.” He grinned inanely at me for a moment, then his face became serious as he looked down and concentrated, apparently trying to remind his feet how to walk.
But eventually, deep in the city, John asked the taxi to pull over. Turning to Sherlock he clasped his hand and told him that he needed to go and see his sister and break it to her that he was alive. If her job was still the same, she would probably be working at home this afternoon and he could catch a Tube from here to her house.
Sherlock remained motionless for a while but eventually nodded and went to sit in his chair.  John picked up a book, sat on the sofa and tried not to glance up too frequently to watch his friend as he sat with his hands steepled in front of his mouth, apparently lost in thought.  They didn’t speak for the rest of the evening.
In the hospice, Emily lay back against the pillows, exhausted but pleased with herself that she had managed to hide her pain from her visitors.  Well,
John looked uncomfortable but realised that Sherlock would persist until he knew everything. Unable to meet his eyes, he said quietly, “I wasn’t happy with the idea of you seeing the scars on my back and my legs. I wasn’t sure how you’d feel about them.”
“It’s all right,” Greg told him as John’s throat tightened.  “She’ll understand better than anyone.  Mrs Turner’ll take care of her tonight, and we’ll check up on her tomorrow.”  He put the car in gear and pulled out into the traffic.
Emily nodded.  “I’ll do what I can to keep him busy,” she said, “but it sounds to me like he needs something specific to concentrate on all the time, day and night.”
detective,” Sherlock said derisively.  “I’ll only investigate cases which interest me.  And if the police have cases which they can’t solve, I’ll make myself available to them if they want to call me in.”
Despite driving his own car and not a police vehicle with its helpful siren and flashing lights, Greg arrived within six minutes after breaking several road traffic laws en route.  He pulled up at the kerb to find John sitting on the steps outside the door of 221, his head lowered and his shoulders hunched.  A holdall was beside him with a jacket draped over it.  Greg leaned over and opened the passenger door and John picked up his bag and trudged towards him.
“Yes, they did, Mr Anderson,” I replied. “Sherlock used to spend a great deal of his time at Bart’s and as time went by it became obvious to me that – even though he didn’t actually want to speak with anyone – he just wanted some company. So when John arrived on the scene and was looking for some cheap accommodation just when Sherlock decided to move to Baker Street, I was delighted that they were able to get together.”
, Holmes – a bloody waste of your talent, and your brilliance, and your skill at bringing criminals to the justice that they deserve ...” he stared intently into Sherlock’s eyes, “... and a bloody waste of the memory of John Watson.”
“He may have ignored you when you were with us, but he did like you,” Sherlock told her.  “Or rather, he liked that you kept me out of his hair.  When you left, I was a nuisance to him, constantly pestering him with questions about why you’d gone away.”
While he continued giggling I wondered what percentage of British judges would accept a plea of justifiable manslaughter and whether it was worth the risk, and it was with the utmost relief that I saw Inspector Lestrade approaching us. Anderson almost overbalanced as he turned towards him and beamed cheerfully.
“Oh, no,” Emily said.  “Sherlock refused to have anything to do with me after I left in 1984; never replied to any of my letters to him, wouldn’t take my phone calls.  We haven’t seen each other since Sherlock was ten.”
John returned only once to Baker Street.  Months after he had visited Sherlock’s grave with Mrs Hudson, months after he had started moving from friend’s house to friend’s house, staying in their spare bedroom or sleeping on their couch for as long as they would tolerate him, he finally admitted to himself that he simply couldn’t live in the flat again.  It had done some good to stay away, because the press found it more difficult to track him down and pester him with increasingly high offers of money for an exclusive interview.  Finally the media’s interest in the fraudulent detective was beginning to die down, and at the same time Stella and Ted were starting to drop hints that it was time for John to leave their home.
John thought morbidly even as his mouth twitched a little. The driver was so cheerful that his mood couldn’t help but rub off just a little no matter how grumpy John was feeling.
“Finally burned out your sense of smell, have you?” John enquired angrily as he turned around from the window.
It was thirteen months since John – lonely, frustrated and unable to fight his feelings any longer – hesitantly walked across the hotel room, stepped into Sherlock’s personal space, looked into his eyes and, seeing only welcome and encouragement, took his face in his hands and gently pulled his head down until their lips met. Thirteen months since – an hour or so later – Sherlock asked him, “What took you so long?”
“They talked to me and Mycroft about it,” Sherlock admitted.  “He didn’t care, but I didn’t want you to go.”  He smiled tightly.  “I threw quite the hissy fit, and they dropped the whole idea.  I thought it was done with, and then five months later you left anyway.”
have been.  Why did he kill himself instead of proving that everyone was wrong about him?  Why didn’t he trust me enough to help him?  And why did he keep that stupid ... bloody ... bear ...”
“Don’t bother telling me what your last slave died of,” he told him grumpily. “I think I can guess.”
didn’t make sense. So a character had a long coat – but this should not be setting off the realisations that were smashing into John’s head right now. And yes, the character was tall and slender and graceful and had impossibly attractive curly hair ... and was ludicrously self-confident and arrogant and self-centred ... and unaware or uncaring of what anybody else thought or felt ...
Still grinning, Sherlock took his face in his hands and then pulled him into a deep kiss that left both of them breathless. Afterwards, Sherlock gazed into John’s face for a moment, then leaned forward and buried his mouth in his hair.
Ten minutes later, after giving Mrs Hudson one last hug and promising that he would keep in touch, John piled the last of his possessions into the back of his car and drove away from 221B Baker Street for the final time.
The last and final story in this collection follows.  I thought long and hard about whether to include it here or whether to post it separately – or whether to leave it where it was, buried deep in an LJ blog where nobody would find it.  As I commented on the original posting of the story,
Or, if you’re reading this on a device which doesn’t allow clicking, here’s the first bit of Wikipedia’s entry:
“I don’t want you to leave,” Sherlock said a little louder, then sniffled and swiped the back of his hand under his nose.
together.” He looked closely at John’s shrug. “But that’s not the only reason you’ve held back, is it?”
“You’ll have to get clean first,” Emily told him.  He scowled at her but she returned his look resolutely and made her voice stern.  “You can’t go reeling into crime scenes while you’re under the influence of drugs.  They’ll just arrest
no life; and taking his laptop out of the drawer every morning had only drawn his attention to the pistol hidden in there. If Sherlock hadn’t come into his life and given him something worth living for, John felt it might only have been a matter of time before he had reached for the gun instead of the laptop.
“Yes, all right, I know that sounds just like you, but maybe that’s the problem.  If we come and live with you, you’re going to be responsible for helping to bring her up and teach her how to be a rounded human being.  You can’t just escape to the basement whenever she’s pissing you off; it wouldn’t be right.”
In an attempt to forestall any further conversation he took his phone from his pocket and pretended to be checking his texts but the cabbie had other ideas.
She glanced towards the clock on the wall and grimaced when she realised that there were almost two hours to wait until the nurse brought her more painkillers.  She didn’t mind dying but just wished that it could be less uncomfortable.  If she could just drift off effortlessly, she would happily go today but she couldn’t help dreading the thought of the impending pain.
“If that’s where you want me to stop, that’s where I’m going to stop!” the man replied cheerfully. He pulled up at the pavement, then turned and frowned at John as if surprised he was still in the car. “We’re here. Get out,” he told him mock-sternly.
in people – he asked questions about our work and our lives, and told us about his. There are a lot of people at the Yard who knew John Watson and thought of him as a good man.”
a sannoying odd, he’s not as, umm ...” He trailed off, looking confused, then took another long drink. “Anyway, he’s annoying but not
He had a feeling that he had actually gasped out loud because the person sitting in front of him half turned her head, apparently wondering what she’d missed onstage to provoke such a reaction. The other reason he was sure that gasping had been involved was because, while the pain in his stomach was fading, his chest now hurt. Apparently he had sucked in a large lungful of air but hadn’t yet got around to letting it out again. For some odd reason he didn’t seem to be able to remember how it was done.
“It’ll never be all right, Mrs Hudson,” he said shakily.  “I don’t understand any of it.  Why did he do it?  Why did he lie about making up Moriarty?  I
Several seconds passed and John frowned and raised his head, surprised that Sherlock was allowing Mycroft to talk for so long without interruption.  His eyes widened and he lowered his paper when he realised that Sherlock’s face was pale and he looked shocked.  John sat forward and Sherlock’s eyes flickered briefly towards him but then he stared off into the distance while he concentrated on his brother’s voice.
“What’s happening?” John asked, standing up and turning as Sherlock walked briskly to the door and took his coat from the hook.
“Why do you need to be gay to be in love with him?” Emily demanded.  “You don’t have to ‘turn gay’ or ‘turn bisexual’ to have feelings for another man.  Your feelings for him are irrelevant to how you identify your sexuality.  Admitting that you’re in love with Sherlock doesn’t mean that you have to start looking at other men and thinking, ‘Ooh,
and hardly the vital matter which Sherlock had indicated to John – but had then texted five minutes later to say that there was a change of plan and he would come over that afternoon.
I grimaced. “Well, there were several people and circumstances involved in the two of them becoming flatmates, but I like to think that I played a part in it, yes.”
“So what else is new?” John demanded. “And is the mighty Holmes brain incapable of multi-tasking all of a sudden?”
bring the reports,” John said, breathing hard in a rapidly failing attempt to retain the last dregs of his temper. “I didn’t bring the reports because I was too busy being ever so slightly furious about being treated like I’m nothing more than your personal dogsbody.”
Turning on his heel he almost skidded on something wet that had dripped off the edge of the table – quite possibly the whatever-it-was that was rapidly rendering the flat unliveable. Catching his balance before he fell on top of it and ruined yet another set of clothes, he hurled the kitchen door open, went through and slammed it noisily behind him before storming downstairs and out the front door. With no thought of an ultimate destination, he headed in the general direction of anywhere that wasn’t Baker Street.
Mycroft assessed him for a long moment, then nodded. “Very well,” he said, nodding towards the closed door. Anderson turned towards it but Mycroft stepped into his way and leaned closer to him. “If you make his condition worse in any way, Doctor Anderson,” he told him softly, “you’ll have me to answer to.” He smiled unpleasantly. “And you really don’t want to have to answer to me.”
“Next, please.” John released the intercom and sat back in his chair while he waited for the receptionist to send in his next patient. Despite his attempts to concentrate on his work, his mind began to wander, as it so frequently did even after all this time.
It is never sensible for an arctophile like me to google images of teddies, and I had to firmly stop myself from buying about forty-five of them to add to my already large hug of bears.  But the image above kept cropping up and each time I would think, “He looks about right,” and would click the weblink and then realise, “Oh, it’s him again!”  After about the fourth time, I took the hint.
“I’m almost afraid to let you out of my sight,” he murmured. “For the first time in years we’re safe, but even though I’m not normally superstitious I’m worried about being jinxed.”
Sherlock shivered with delight at the thought. John kissed him once more before turning and walking towards the Tube station, smiling at him over his shoulder as he went. Sherlock watched until he was out of sight, then climbed back into the cab.
with you for not being stronger. Angela and Sally were both furious with their sister and their friend for not being brave enough to stay behind and fight; I think Doctor Watson would feel the same way about you.”
The two of them settled into their seats and began recalling some of their cases, taking it in turns to tell her some of the events which John hadn’t been able to make public.  Emily listened with delight, giggling as they talked about some of the more outrageous moments, and smiling at the many occasions when they cracked up laughing at the memories.  Even when a nurse came in to bring them a tray of tea, Sherlock didn’t stop his current story, just leaning in close and murmuring into Emily’s ear until the nurse had gone again.
The idiot shouldn’t even have been there but, like so often in the past, had found out where the team was going and simply turned up.
a case and Sherlock flares around London with no thought for his own safety or that of others; worse than the times when a case goes on too long and Sherlock is pale, exhausted and trembling from lack of both food and sleep.
There’s one person he might ask for advice, but he knows that his older sibling will probably suggest that he tells a teacher, and then go back to reading those stupid politics books, the big fat idiot. He giggles momentarily at the silent insult, knowing what Mummy would say if she ever heard him say it out loud.
So this one resonates with me. I’ve despised my own name all my life – can’t explain why. It wasn’t an unusual name like Sherlock, Mycroft or Moriarty but I hated it. It didn’t feel right on me, and even as a youngster I took on the name of my favourite TV character at the time – at least inside my own head. The name changed over time but when I was eleven I read the name ‘Callie’ in a book and fell in love with it immediately. Later I decided that if I was ever going to change my name for real, I was going to change the surname as well, and at the age of fifteen – for reasons too complicated to explain – decided that my new surname would be ‘Sullivan.’ And finally, at the ripe old age of thirty-five (fifteen years ago), I made the change official.
“I’ve talked with Mrs Hudson and she realises that she’ll never get round to sorting out the basement flat and renting it out.  She’s agreed that I can have it, can get the damp sorted out and can convert the kitchen into a lab.  The living room and bedroom down there can serve as storage rooms for my equipment and anything else that Rosamund shouldn’t have access to.  The bathroom’s already fit for purpose.  When I’m working I can shut myself down there and stay out of her way.  At the same time the upstairs areas will be child-safe.  She wouldn’t be in any danger.”
He walked towards the armchair on the other side of the bed, Sherlock deliberately turning his head away as he progressed around the bed. Undeterred, Anderson sat in the chair and grimaced at the large bag of blood hanging at the bedside. “I don’t want to be here,” he told Sherlock. “You know what I think of you, but I had to come here to protect someone I care about. Because friendship
much, you know? Embarassing, but possible. My insane attraction to you, at least, is evidence of lunacy (another point that Ella disputes, but these are my letters). When you were alive I was afraid that you'd suddenly vanish. Leave my mundane world to go be somewhere more marvelous. When I lost you, the world lost its colour. Maybe it doesn't matter if I made you up or not.
It was around this point in my friend’s relation of this story to me that it occurred to me how wonderful it would feel to be this very stripper. My friend looked at me quizzically, and I could feel Kilgore Trout, Millionaire witnessing my perspective with agony from beyond the grave.  Kitty was into “really crazy shit,” as she assured anyone, but it occurred to me, from a vague distance, that it may feel good to be the muse of a failed fiction writer. As terribly sad as it would be, holding a bouquet of someone else’s imagination, it might feel quite nice to be adored as thought-turned-flesh. This is a very romantic view of things, however. My friend assures me that cocaine was also involved.
strangers. In this day and age, it was possible, and very in fashion, to arrange colored photons of light into a variety of particular patterns. In the South, this trend had all but ended the need for military oversight of the wealthier sects of the civilian populace. Even in the valentine-heavy areas where John patrolled and studied, the vast majority of citizens preferred to spend their time inside their endless castles of impossible geometry, wearing Nike socks and staring at triangles.
I wrote this several months ago. I have since escaped my spaceship and gone on many more adventures. I love my mirrorbird, which has the capacity to be an enormous arse, when unchecked and untrained, in the service of either advertising, or showing me the patterns of the universe—never sure which. Kilgore wanted to write a story about it called
He’d piloted the tiny cloud clipper skip the army had granted him with Stamford, the best friend he’d managed to make while serving in the South. Stamford was an excellent navigator, but John was glad to be rid of him. As the landscape scrolled by beneath them, shifting from geometric crop formations to thick forests and mountains to brightly colored, irregular fields dotted with castles, Stamford kept mentioning how John was going to thrive in Port Royal, how excellent the new city would be for his gunshot wound. So upon disembarking, when Stamford went right, John took a left, and felt immediately awash the relief of solitude found as an outsider in a crowd of strangers.
My father’s father was a cargo pilot in World War II. He flew injured soldiers over the Himalayas. I have one photograph of him, with his head poking out of his plane. His name was Tony. I don’t know why I’m telling you this. It is just something that I thought you would like to know.
John shoved his own mask to the top of his head and ripped off the elephant mask so he could begin peppering the stranger’s perfect face with kisses. “Hello,” he hummed, holding the man’s face in his hands. His eyes were…
It hasn’t been smooth sailing. Wind’s all wrong. And the crew’s trying to keep their spirits up, God bless them, but they’ve been murmuring about keelhauling Sherlock, he knows they have. And half the time he thinks they’ve got a point.
I have a thin, white, horizontal scar half an inch long running through the center of my forehead. This is a relic from my infancy, when my caring and attentive mother pitched me headfirst into a coffee table. A plastic surgeon used five stitches to sew me up again. Until recently, I considered this anomaly unremarkable. Only a month or so ago, however, while visiting my cousin, I learned that there are private, government-operated schools for wards of the state under eighteen with severe behavioral problems. I learned this from my cousin’s roommate, who works as a guard at one such facility. Some of the problems are “really serious.” One girl, for example, listens to her music all day. Most of the time is makes her laugh, but sometimes it makes her cry, and she has difficulty socializing with the other students. I assumed this was because she was under surveillance all the time, and forced to live in a jail where the condescending staff believe her to have severe behavioral problems. “Yeah, but it’s really bad though,” said my cousin’s roommate. “Some of the students have brain damage from being like, dropped on their heads as kids and stuff.”
This is what I mean about failure and the proper appreciation of science fiction. If you do not know what I mean by now, kindly return to the holodeck.
John sniffed. “You thought I was going to report you to her, when I first spooked you,” John began. “But you’re nothing like an insurgent. You even went out of your way to reassure your listeners as to the innocence of a guilty man.”
So nice to escape into this world! Hope my worldbuilding and stylistic choices aren’t too weird, I have a lot of ideas buzzing around in my head lately and this is something of a siphon. Really wasn’t sure about the time jump at first, but here we are! And, uh, hoping to get more into the mirrorbird telepathy next chapter lol. Wrote this chapter while listening to Stabat Meter by Woodkid, Don’t Be Cruel by Elvis Presley, Colour Me In by Damien Rice, and Eugene and My Blue Bucket of Gold by Sufjan Stevens. I have been listening to tons of new music and would love to listen to more artists you like so please feel free to share a song or two you’ve been listening to. I hope you liked it, thanks for reading :)
, and when they’d had their little tryst, Sherlock had known with certainty that that man hadn’t been,
“I—I’m new here, actually. Bit different from what I’m used to. I just… I don’t know, it’s stupid, really… I just thought I’d say hello. To someone who… seems to look like they know what’s going on, I suppose. This
Mrs Holmes took off her reading glasses and settled back in her chair.  “Mycroft is twelve,” she began.  “If we could afford it, we’d send him to a private school but he’s at the grammar school and he’s totally outshining every other pupil in his year.  That means that he’s finding it hard to make friends but it doesn’t seem to bother him.”  She looked reflective.  “He’s always been the solitary type.  He doesn’t enjoy the company of other children – lord knows we tried when he was younger but he simply wasn’t interested in playing with any of the local kids, and just alienated them if we forced him to.  He devotes most of his attention to his school work,
writers and so, although they each posted the stories in their own Livejournal blogs and may have possibly transferred them to AO3 since, I just felt it might not be appropriate to include them in this collection.
“Why ...?  Good lord, Sherlock, he’s your best friend.  He recently found out that his wife’s baby isn’t his, and now she and the baby have left him.  He’s living on his own in his flat and he’s lonely.  That sounds just like somebody else I know.”
Sherlock flinched from him, starting to turn his head away but Anderson slapped his hand onto the sheet at the side of Sherlock’s legs and the detective’s eyes reluctantly swung back to his.
few – when Sherlock can no longer resist the call of his old addictions and John comes home to find that it’s not nicotine patches that Sherlock has been applying to his arm.
It’s still a shock whenever Sherlock’s anguished voice cries out John’s name, disturbing John from his sleep or from a doze on the sofa. The fear in Sherlock’s voice is horrifying and John wants to bury his head under a pillow and pretend he can’t hear it.
“And we need someone who’ll do more than just keep an eye on them and give them their tea,” Mrs Holmes continued.  “I’m not exaggerating or boasting when I say that our boys are extremely intelligent for their ages and need special attention from someone who’ll interact with them, keep their minds busy, listen to Mycroft if he wants to talk about what he’s doing with his homework, and keep Sherlock busy and stop him getting bored and pestering his brother.”
She giggled at Sherlock’s wide grin.  “Mycroft would get really exasperated with us,” she continued, “but he never complained to his parents.  I think he secretly enjoyed being included in the fun.”
: Major character death (already happened), discussion of suicide (attempted) by major character, discussion of suicide (successful) by original character. Altogether unbelievably angsty and miserable. Have a nice day.
“I tried to teach Mycroft not long after I started working for the family, but he wasn’t interested,” she said.  “He thought the whole concept was ridiculous, but he was almost thirteen when I arrived and he had already organised his mind in a way that would help him retain information, so he considered the Mind Palace to be pointless.  Personally I’ve always found it useful, so once Sherlock was old enough I introduced him to the idea and he lapped it up.”
“I will if you call him.  And when he gets here, he’ll need to know exactly what you’ve taken.  While you’re still able to, you should make a list.”
Sherlock was blinking more frequently now as the other man’s words began to sink in. Again Anderson pressed on, but his voice became gentler.
to see it. Then Sally saw it on Friday and she’s been texting me ever since and saying the same thing. I have no idea why they’re so keen, but I had nothing to do this afternoon so I went and sat in the queue. Nice bunch of people – we had a good time.

It took the world’s most cheerful cab driver to make John Watson realise that he was living an ABBA song.
“Sally and I have never had an affair. She came over to my house that day because she needed a friend, and because I and my wife have been friends with her ever since she and I first met at the Yard. Her sister Teresa had had psychological problems for years, and that morning the police in Croydon had phoned Sally and told her that Teresa had taken a deliberate swan dive off the top of a multi-storey car park.”
by abundantlyqueer. That title immediately gave me the punchline for this story (as well as its own title), but it’s taken over a year to get it out of my head and onto the screen.
“He was one of life’s nice people,” Anderson told him softly. “And for some godawful reason, it’s always the nice people who die early. I don’t know why that is, or whether it’s just that it
Emily looked over the top of her glasses at him.  “Who am I going to tell?” she asked with a small smile.
“He did very major damage to both of his arms, Doctor Anderson,” he told him. “This wasn’t a cry for help; it was a determined intention to kill himself. The fact that he was found in time is nothing short of a miracle, and he is not pleased at having been saved. Do you really believe that you can help him to feel better about himself?”
He had avoided the well-intentioned attempts of his friends to include him in their social lives, choosing to politely thank them while turning down their invitations. Eventually they had given up trying and the phone calls had become less frequent.
Many thanks to Mirith Griffin, who suggested – after I emailed her and other LJ friends about my day – that the driver was so brilliant that I should incorporate him into a fic. It was only then that I realised that

Mrs Hudson came in some time later, worried by the long silence from upstairs, and found him sitting on the side of Sherlock’s bed.  He still had tears on his cheeks.
Sherlock pouted and Emily lowered her book.  “Sherlock, dear,” she told him gently. “If you don’t want me here any more, you can make me go away. You only have to tell me to go, and I’ll leave.”
the girls had been so excited – and giggly – about the scene, but even with his lack of theatrical knowledge he could appreciate that this was something new and very different. Turning his head slightly to his right he could see that Sherlock was already engrossed, his fingers steepled in front of his mouth as he watched. A second character entered, walking right through the audience, but John wasn’t really paying attention to him, his focus still on the actor who had held the stage alone for the past fifteen minutes with an energy that made John feel tired just watching him.
“I think Sherlock needs to be left on his own for a little while,” he said. “In the meantime, why don’t we sit and talk? My assistant has gone to get us some coffee. Sit with me, Doctor Anderson, if you will, and tell me about John Watson.”
John was about to attempt a teasing query about the Holmes family’s connections but he faltered to a stop when he saw a metal sign post set at the edge of the grass near the front porch.  Sherlock stopped too, his shoulders drooping slightly while John read the sign before turning to him in shock.
It was shortly after that that she had a coughing fit when they told her about their visit to Buckingham Palace, choking on a mouthful of tea as John revealed that Sherlock had been wearing only a sheet.  The boys sprang into action, Sherlock instantly raising the top of the bed while John helped her to sit higher while firmly rubbing her back, his eyes on her as he held one hand out towards Sherlock who immediately slapped a handful of paper tissues into it so that John could wipe her mouth.  When she had recovered and caught her breath, she looked back and forth between the two sets of concerned eyes gazing at her, and sighed.
Only in soppy romantic fiction do people’s ...  Anyway, despite that, John’s eyes widened and his mouth fell open.  Sherlock looked anxiously at him.
“Sod that,” John replied. “I swear I’ll never complain about your violin, or eyeballs in the microwave ever again if you find a valid excuse for me to sit in a
. can I not get shot at, or have to chase after some knife-wielding maniac because you won’t let the police do their job and will insist on collaring the bloke yourself, or have to apologise to half the bloody world for your stupid behaviour, or get half blown up, poisoned or driven out of the flat by one of your stupid experiments, or have you constantly texting me because you can’t be arsed to walk across the room to pick up a pencil, or sending me off on your errands because you’re too lazy to collect the samples or the bloody reports you urgently need which aren’t urgent at all ...”
There are many things that John has to tolerate now that he lives with Sherlock, but nobody ever prepared him for this.
Sherlock winced against the pain in his chest and tried to settle more comfortably on the hospital bed.
John suppressed a sigh and tried to concentrate on his newspaper while bracing himself for a long snarking session between his flatmate and the British government, made more frustrating by the fact that he would only be able to hear half of the bickering due to Mycroft being on the other end of the phone.
If you had said to John that one day he would buy Sherlock a teddy bear, John would have shaken his head and (if he was in a good mood) would have told you that you were mad or (if he wasn’t in such a good mood) would have told you that you were

For a moment he looked at me anxiously but then the belligerence of the drunk began to take hold and he scowled, attempted to draw himself up to his full height and poked at my shoulder with a finger. “Now look here, Mike ...” he began.
Despite its theme, it’s the story I’m most proud of writing, and I didn’t want to keep it hidden away any more.
claiming that I can go in there and stop him, but I’m here so that Sally – Sergeant Donovan – doesn’t have to do this instead, because it’ll hurt her a lot more than me.”
I should talk to Harry, but I'm afraid she'll kill me. She keeps asking me to come and see her. Seems innocent enough, but somehow she'll get me drunk and confront me on her sofa, I just know it. She's like that. You should have heard her last time, right after you died. Absolute nightmare.
Oh, look at him. Oh, he is looking at him. He is almost more pleasurable to look at for all the time spent not looking. With such a spectacular nose and brow, he must’ve looked distinguished and mature even in adolescence, though the thought of his diminutive frame suffused with coltish youth makes the Captain turn away again. It almost makes him angry, if that is the word for everything going on inside himself. He’s touching his mouth again, he realizes. Pinching his lower lip. He balls the offending hand into a fist.
You should never trust millionaires, said my friend Kilgore Trout, as he told me of his other self over tea. This was not something I needed to be told. I had read
“The state of your cargo hold is paltry,” Sherlock says. “Yet you docked well North of Mystic Seaport and made no exchange of goods – beyond me. On the run, then, hoping to improve the value of your pathetic stash by harvesting lightning along the way, but you’ve trouble running into a storm that yields any product of consequence. No surprise there, as you’re running on routes that fell dead four years ago. Could be they’re familiar and you’ve got a shit navigator, could be you’re paranoid about police patrols and rival pirates. Quite rightly, I’m afraid – quality valentine’s scarce these days, and you’ve got the highest grade I’ve ever tasted. Congratulations, by the way, it really
at least, is familiar. But the Captain cannot find solid ground in it as he usually does. Isn’t that something, that the Captain might think about the hand? That the Captain might—?
Kilgore Trout, my friend, who visited me in my shipping container, died last year. I miss him every day.
An awkward silence fell between them. Sherlock turned his gaze to his shoes. “I’ve seen sinking ships go down with more grace than the Queen.”
Could you just come back, please, so we can fix everything before you do something stupid? Come back so I can brush your hair from your forehead and kiss your neck and tell you I like the color of your eyes. Everything we didn't get to do, we'll do it. I'm there if you want me.
It must be clarified that the Kilgore Trout of which I presently write is not the same Kilgore Trout as the failed science fiction writer and war veteran who lived by the docks with a parakeet. This man is my friend; we met in the years when I was living in a shipping container by those same docks. Somewhere along his universal timeline, he was not sure where, Kilgore separated into a second self, to become a failed science fiction writer who was about half as prolific, but a millionaire.
“A stowaway and a thief,” says the pirate who introduces himself as Mr. Mole, a name Sherlock is too stoned to scoff at, “the sharks will
“And you shouldn’t have to,” John said, running his fingers into the man’s dark curls and guiding his head backward with gentle pulls to coax him into baring his neck. “Let me do some thinking for you.” John pressed thick kisses along Sherlock’s jawline, then, lower. “I’d like to duel everyone who’s failed to adore you properly.” John’s hands couldn’t make up their mind about where to land, wanting to clutch every part of him. “Show them a thing or two.” He pressed his left into the small of Sherlock’s back and used his right to hitch Sherlock’s thigh more securely around his waist. He moved his mouth down Sherlock’s neck, sucking on the hollow of his throat, then over his collarbone. “About the right way—to treat—that great—big—brain.” Sherlock threw his head back and squeezed John between his legs.  “Brilliant,” John purred. Sherlock gasped when John hit just the right spot where his neck met his shoulder, a small sound. John touched his mouth down again in the same place, tongue darting out to lick the skin. “So good for me.”
he thinks, the back of his neck and ears turning red, as he shuffles through his papers and maps and the book, the bloody book—
It's like the world is teasing me. Do you have any idea how often you come up in casual conversation? Multiple times a week, with people who have never even heard of John Watson before. Unfortunately, most people think you're an arse. I agree with them, most of the time, but for different reasons, so it's not the same. I want to sit each of them down and explain who you really are, but it's exhausting enough to acknowledge that I know you. In my mind, you are a universe unto yourself. I like us best that way.
“Don’t get too close to that leak,” John said, as Sherlock leaned right up against his own reflection. “Your other universes might creep in.”
“Mr—?” Even with the blindfold, Sherlock can hear the scornful expression the captain sends his first mate. “His name is Mike.”
“Captain…” Sherlock’s hands found his hair, “oh God Captain, please… I can’t wait any longer, please…”
Ella doesn't push, though she's very interested in my life as flatmate of famous Sherlock Holmes. I'm an interesting client and my case is Sherlock Holmes, isn't that funny? And she let me leave the Holmes family situation at "crazy rich people bullshit" - her words, not mine. I still can't even think about Mycroft.
“And this criminal obliviousness keeps people thinking your boat’s neutral territory, even though you’re clearly in service to the Queen?”
“Hush.” A finger presses against Sherlock’s lips and draws away again before he can suck it into his mouth. A part of his head—the sober bit—wants to ask,
I apologize for my very American intrusion upon the narrative, and know that it is rude, in the middle of someone else’s story, to talk about myself. But I am lonely, in my starship, in the belly of a whale. I miss my friend. I’m sure my peers, were I ever to have the guts to tell them, would assess that I’ve taken his loss “very hard indeed.” I do not know how I’ve taken it. I thank them for doing me the kindness of not listening to me. I feel better than I used to, and further away. I feel a lot of things. There is so much to think about. I am afraid of war, and failure. Last night, I saw the stars over the Grand Canyon. I have never seen so many. Orion was still there.
“Oh, Sherlock, you’re so good for me,” says Captain Shakespeare. “How could I expect anything less? You may have the rest of the crew fooled, but I have always known that you have the softest, gentlest heart of any adventurer to conquer the horizon.” Sherlock keens and exposes his neck and Captain Shakespeare dotes upon it with kisses. “And the bravest… slyest, cleverest… sexiest…” He did not have enough hands to touch him as he wanted, he could not even imagine where he wants to touch first, he just wants to touch everywhere, so contents himself with shoving up Sherlock’s shirt and running his hands up the natural curve of his waist, where he just might be ticklish, to a gentle touch. Sherlock buries his face in the Captain’s neck and begins to rut softly against his knee. “I’d give anything…
A strange noise sounds from somewhere beyond the mirror, within the labyrinth’s corridors. “What was that?” he asks in a hush, still petting absently at Sherlock.
And his sternum, and his navel, and Captain Shakespeare was on his knees, “I love you. God help me, I love you.”
Instead, Mole pulls Sherlock to his feet and pulls a blindfold over his eyes. “Right. I’m taking you to see the Captain.” He ties Sherlock’s hands behind his back and leads him up the ladder and through the hatch.
You fill up the page. You are my favorite character. You are everywhere; you make the story interesting. And my God, do I love you. You're always talking to me in my head. Your pulse appears under the words and you are almost alive again. It's the best part of writing. I can see you on that rooftop, or smoking a cigarette, or sitting at the end of my bed, resting your hand on my ankle.
“Whatever it is,” says Captain Shakespeare, flipping through a stack of letters on his desk, “it can wait.” He spares the restrained Sherlock half a glance, and smirks at the sight of him.
since the end of last Fall, and so many years had gone by, that even at the urgings of his mirrorbird, Sherlock was not sure if this was the man from the masque. His
“You’ve made an absolute mess of things,” he hears himself saying in that voice that comes out when he’s being meaner than he thought himself capable.
a party,” John finished, sounding more defensive than he meant to. One of John’s best kept secrets was that he got along dreadfully with people. He could hardly stand talking to anyone. And it was all made that much more complicated by the masks. John felt like maybe the stranger just wanted him to go away. He felt like he may be a bit happier if he evaporated.
“I love you too,” said Sherlock after a pause just long enough to feel like a test, as Captain Shakespeare finally wrapped his lips around Sherlock’s cock like he’d been longing to every night for months. Every time he touched himself he imagined sucking him and sucking him and sucking him. “Oh…”
Ella is thrilled and fascinated now that I have opened up about you. I did not need to tell her the obvious parts. Sometimes, when I get caught up talking about something insufferable you did, like shoot the wall, she'll sit up, delighted, and say, "and you liked it!"
“Apologies,” said the elephant, turning to face John head-on and holding out his hand. John was now paralyzed with fear due to the fact that everything he could think to say was boring. “You’re an army doctor, I should have seen that sooner. Invalidated. How are you enjoying Port Royal?”
The Captain’s deft, thick fingers run along Sherlock’s cheekbones, up to his temple, and slip beneath the blue blindfold to lift it away. Sherlock’s breath catches in his throat. He looks—he can’t look too long—it’s like staring into a star. His eyes trail down his neck, his chest, before settling instead on staring at the carpet. Red, oriental. And the captain’s shoes. Oh, God.
“Conversations are intended as dialogues, Mr. Otter, I do hope you will get more varied with your contributions. Ah! I left my riding crop in the mortuary. Care to come?”
John got a dirty look for this, though he wasn’t sure what was so wrong with what he’d said. The vendor turned his attention again to the crowd, beckoning two young girls towards his cart. “Ladies! Best make sure you cover your face for the ball, or the Captain could come kill you in your sleep!”
“Hang what the crew wants, and get out!” The door closes again. The Captain, however, maintains his distance. Sherlock listens to the sloshing of the sea. There’s a dull roar of the sailors’ response as Mike passes on the news of the captain’s dissent. “You think just because you can rattle off a bunch of guesswork about my ship, I’ll forgive you for stowing away, smoking my cargo, and, what—ask you to join my crew?”
Sherlock concentrates all his thoughts on the back of Shakespeare’s head and tries to focus on the few details he can still recall from their night in the labyrinth. He hopes he can just project the past into the Captain’s mind without having to speak his suspicions aloud and betray all the hope that hides in his voice. Sometimes Sherlock gets so sick of himself. He’s always wrong about everything. A fraud, just like they said. What even was truth, anyway?
and he forgot everything he knew about what he wasn’t supposed to do so he could devote every iota of attention to memorizing Sherlock’s chest with his mouth. “I love you,” he said, devoting equal attention to each nipple so neither felt left out, “have I said that yet? There’s nowhere on Earth I’d rather be than stuck on this ship with your brilliant, annoying—”
Maybe you don't want me, maybe you would have done something about it if you did. But I wish I had kissed you. I wish I had sunk into your lap in your chair and tasted your mouth, warm and wet. Maybe you would have let me. Sometimes it is too much to think about what I cannot have. Sometimes it is all I can think about.
“In title only. It’s much more like she works for me. I don’t like handling… er, politics. Let alone our rather chilly neighbours to the East.”
One-eyed girls are involved, and the theory of forms. Nothing is ever new. I am trying my best to write another, original story, as usual, even if all it will ever be is another fading portal to the past. I will finish it someday, as I expect myself to return here, eventually. I have more mistakes to make. I have learned about the trees, for instance: they touch, talk, walk, and listen. They’re advancing; they sow seeds. Even in death—the walls are listening, and have been all along. Matter advances, machines evolve. We’re still here, trapped down a very deep gravity well, generating power. Still here. Still. Staying still—still as static. We move much slower than the trees, our inner ecosystems so complicated it can be hard to look each other in the eye. We write it down, for the record. I’m lucky to be exactly where I am. I am sorry for the mistakes made by my mania and imagination. I am sorry for self-centered moments of bitterness, cynicism, and vanity. I must be going now. There’s somewhere I ought to be, though I’m not sure where. I am happy to keep in touch. I will not be swallowed up by oblivion.
“Yes,” says the hand, head bowed, shy, shuffling in like it’s an embarrassment to even open the door. “I heard you. But I just thought… I mean, since you’re awake, and everything…”
“succeeding” is an illusion sold by the government to a failing species to keep them from panicking as their organic spaceship identifies them as cancerous. The word has no definition, other than alluding to the idea that there is something more to life than eating, shitting, and reproduction. In the end, the success indulgences collapse with the economy, and the main characters meet God. God is a mixture of light and numbers who does not apologize for all the terrible things humanity has done. To err, after all, is divine.
Can't believe it's been over a year since you jumped. You are as close to my heart as ever. You idiot.
“Lying becomes you. Look at that face.” Sherlock’s eyelids fluttered. “Yeah, like that. Never fucked on valentine before, have you? I can tell by how you kiss me.” John pinched again, and Sherlock cried out. “But maybe you’re not a captain. Maybe you’re a spoiled prince teasing at the edge of rebellion… who’s never had anybody rough him up or tell him he’s wrong in his life. Yeah?” He pushed himself up against Sherlock, kissing the larger man’s shoulders and rubbing his body along the length of him, pinning him to the mirror with want. He nuzzled his nose into Sherlock’s hairline and affixed his mouth on the stretch of skin just behind Sherlock’s ear, where the skin is soft as velvet. “Yeah? And I’m making you worse, getting off on the way you preen. Bet you’ve had dozens of me. Bet your family says I’m a no-good soldier.”
“How terrible,” I told my friend, imagining Kitty’s alternatively successful life as a Kindergarten teacher.
His eyes fall on the book, resting on top of the maps. It would be so easy, to open it again. The Book of Souls. To let it devour him.
“Then those that need the most protecting will make compromises with their enemy, the val trade skyrockets, and the Queen’s irresolute and apathetic backbone will be all that’s left alive. Mark my words.”
“Everyone’s got to deal with those. Doesn’t make you any less of a thief. And my only quality product, by your own admission.”
“That won’t be necessary,” the Captain says, and it’s everything Sherlock can do to keep from groaning in frustration. He doesn’t usually—
The following day, Sherlock made his way to the clifftops outside of Port Royal and waited for the North Wind.
God, he’s tired. Oh, how he longs for… something. Not dry land, not a quiet end to his career. Something he cannot allow himself to think about, lest he get lost in his want, lest he suffer losing it.
“What if I… what if I really was? Captain Shakespeare?” John rubbed at Sherlock’s nipples through his shirt.
was the small boat from which Sherlock conducted most of his business, when he was not entertaining at masquerades.
In it, a failed science fiction writer is continually approached by psychical manifestations of his favorite creations, who insist that they’ve known him all their lives. As the story wore on, the writer were to realize that he, too, was his own fictional creation. He had not thought of an ending. The notes were very complicated.
I can't tell Ella everything. It's nice enough to have someone to talk to about you. There's plenty to address without getting into the times I wanted to get my hands around your throat and shag you senseless in the kitchen because you burnt the eggs. Again. Again! Then you'd give me this look across the living room, like it was all my fault. And I'd be caught between thinking, he really needs something shoved up his arse, and what kind of man can't cook an egg? Would you like to be choked? And then I'd worry you could somehow read all this on my face, because I bet you could, so I'd stare at the paper without reading it, and then another night's gone by in silence where I didn't take the proper chance to enjoy what I had. And while I was thinking about all this, you'd go and burn another pan of eggs, just for the look on my face, probably, and I wouldn't mind! See? I simply love you, I do not understand it myself.
John narrowed his eyes at that. Most everyone who sailed on the King’s waters ran into valentine traders whether they liked it or not. Surely Smith had
Why do you have to be dead, Sherlock? Why did you kill yourself? I know you're not a fake, I just know it. So what was it? Fed up? Tired? Needed to disappear? To get away from Moriarty, or me? Was it me?
