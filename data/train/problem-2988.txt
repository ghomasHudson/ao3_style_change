“It’s okay, Dean. It’s okay,” Castiel keeps saying.
“Not broken,” Cas leans down to kiss his forehead. “Just a little banged up is all.”
see you,” he rolls his eyes at Dean’s shape from underneath the comforter, “I’ve never seen you so…content? Peaceful? I don’t know man, but it’s good.”
instead of
“You didn’t need to get me anything, Dean - ”
“Good. You can tell her when she calls you. As soon as I tell her you called, you won’t be able to shut her up,” Sam chuckles fondly.
“So don’t think this changes anything, ya hear? You’re still an Idjit, and you’re still the same person. Just without the bullshit, agreed?” At Dean’s nod he continues, “But can I ask you one thing?”
“Do you even realize what you just said?” Cas squints at him. “Nothing natural is the color green? Does that mean the grass or trees or plants are not natural?”
,” he gasps, immediately closing his eyes again, afraid that the sight alone will make him come on the spot.
Or you know, Christmas shop. Whatever came first.
His stomach drops. He can see where this going. “They-they told me! They told me that I couldn’t have children. He said I’m barely even a…you know what.”
Standing there against Cas’s car, arms wrapped around himself and shivering, he watches Cas and Sam step closer to each other , lips moving in a conversation way too quiet and far away to hear. Cas has got his serious face on, eyes squinted and mouth a straight line, but Sam is smiling a little so he’s not too worried.
As soon as Dean relaxes into the bed again, he lets the two damp fingers get closer and closer to his crack, rubbing gently at the seam. Going up and down over and over until he’s inched his way around his rim. While Dean tenses again as he circles it with his finger, he also moans and bucks again at the same time.
He braces himself against Cas’s shoulder, using the leverage to help him start a stilted, awkward rhythm. He’s panting loudly at this point, heart racing, but he decides to kick it up a notch. Just for Cas. No one else gets him this riled up and reckless.
Later that night, when everything is finally settled, and Dean slips into an exhausted sleep with his head pillowed on Cas’s shoulder with Cas’s arm holding him close, Castiel whispers, “What am I going to do with you, Dean Winchester?”
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas asks, following him over to the chair and standing in front of him.
It was Cas who picked him up last night and didn’t push him into talking. It was Cas who fucking held him last night when the dam burst and he couldn’t tell up from down. This was time and time again now, with just the repeating pattern of
Cas closes his eyes, and immediately a laugh that could really double as a sob makes it’s way out of his throat.
Hungry lips are soon nipping at his jaw, his throat,
“Don’t worry, Dean,” Cas soothes, “I can stop whenever you want. Come here.” He says, patting the spot right next to him. Cas is turned sideways to face him with his legs still facing the front. Movie is apparently forgotten.
this,” Dean says. He knows he’s squeezing Cas’s hands too hard, but he needs something to give him the strength to get the words out. “But it’s so hard. So hard. It was eating me up inside.”
“Are you just saying that because I’m fat now?”
Dean can feel the way his cheeks and ears turn bright pink, can feel Benny’s heavy stare taking in every thing that must be clear on his face. While logically, he knows that Benny and everyone else is aware that he’d had sex with a man, hence the pregnancy, but it still felt
Obviously professionalism won out, because he went to retrieve the file, but instead of taking the chair across from him, he snagged the little rolling stool and rolled it as close as was socially acceptable before looking down at it again.
“It was, smart ass. Couldn’t sit properly for three days…” he trails off wistfully. That was a good night. Too good.
“Food first, perhaps?” Cas snickers, rolling off the couch in one fluid motion, pulling his phone out of his pocket while Dean turns on his side, unwilling to get up. “It’s 5:30. Children should start arriving shortly, Dean. How does pizza sound?”
Fuck, with puppy dog eyes again?…The truth it is then.
And it’s a win-win, because now Cas can rub at Dean’s belly, and Dean has no trouble turning his head to scent Cas’s neck.
With the mention of Cas, John’s face hardens once more after it had slackened with confusion.
“Hey,” he whispers, nuzzling into Cas. “Whatever it is, you can tell me. Talk to me.”
“Uh-huh! So if you’re a boy and you have a baby inside you, does that mean you are a mommy too?” she asks curiously, brow furrowed in innocent confusion.
an affectionate man, so Dean just stands there, arms hanging awkwardly, too shocked to reciprocate it.
“What are you fucking
“I think I’m good,” he takes the laptop, while staring between Cas’s legs. The dude’s still naked. And hell if that ain’t the biggest distraction.
Cas is the one to clench his eyes closed this time, shaking his head and biting his lip.
No more shitty clinics. He needed a legitimate doctor for legitimate answers. He couldn’t go on like this. Especially if he wanted this to remain a secret. Which he fucking did, of course.
Dean just shakes his head, shoveling mouthful after mouthful into his mouth as he stands there next to the door. He’s still wearing the three jackets he’d worn to work, his jeans which felt like they were about to bust at the seams, and his work boots; so realistically, there should have been no way he’d fallen asleep that easy. As the days went on, his clothes got more and more suffocating. He felt like a marsh mellow, but the kind you stuck in the microwave because you didn’t want to make a mess on the stove.
“Will you fucking quit it, Cas?” Dean snaps angrily. “I don’t need you telling me what to do, and I don’t need you worrying over the stupidest shit, alright? I’m fine.”
too many colorful sprinkles. He pretty much made it so that no one would eat the cookies but him, a fact Cas pretended not to resent. While Dean’s sweet tooth had definitely gotten worse with the pregnancy, he saw Cas lick clean a whole spoonful of cookie dough when he’d thought no one looking, shooting a guilty look at Dean when he’d heard Dean’s laugh.
“Alright, alright,” he says, sounding much more like himself, “Lets get outta here before we
“Do that again,” Dean demanded in a hoarse gasp.
“Are you in pain?”
Sam was officially a part of Team Free Will. There was another person in his corner.
They’re everywhere- speeding along hallways, limping with a cane, shuffling papers, tying a shoe, chasing a stray child, staring at him.
Once he’s regained his balance, and he’s sure his knee is clear of anyone’s special bits, he steals the pillow out from underneath Cas’s arm before he stretches out along Cas’s body until his head is cushioned on Cas’s shoulder, and he’s clinging greedily to the man’s body heat.
I know my chapter lengths are inconsistent, but that's just me! Haha and as soon as i'm finished with a chapter, and I like the way it ends, I will post it. Regardless of when i posted last. I'm not one to draw it out, and I will never be one of those authors who will post like every friday or something. When I'm done, you will get it! :)
But only if you are a very good girl, alright?”
“Cas, why?” he laughs, momentarily distracted from the potency of the scent. “Sounds ridiculous, dude. If you have to do it, your bed is super comfortable.”
His head starts to pound as he waits for Cas to say something else. Waits for Cas to do
into it. Only to end up sprawled on his back and flailing awkwardly, he feels his cheeks burn when tries and fails two more times to sit up before giving up.
“Dean. I’m sorry, did I wake you?” Cas says.
“What’s up? Seriously Dean?” and he can just imagine the epic bitch face his brother is sporting at the tone, “I just got off the phone with Dad, and that’s all you have to say?”
Arms coming up to clutch desperately at Castiel’s arms wrapped around him, Dean sobs brokenly as he holds him.
“Oh.” Dean pauses, and then sits up, swinging his legs down to the floor. “You lost me at macaroni, dude. You shouldn’t have started with that.”
Closing his eyes and leaning his head back against the mirror, he listens as Cas looks through his medical supplies underneath the sink. He’d shown Cas where it was when Dean had cut his finger at work a few days ago and Cas had insisted on treating it properly to avoid infection. Such a fucking doctor, he thinks fondly, smiling to himself.
He wants to look away, wants to tuck his head between his knees now that the laughter has completely left his system and the fear is creeping back in, but he suddenly feels himself being hugged within an inch of his life.
“Can’t argue there,” Sam smiles, pulling back and reaching for Jess’s hand.
There’s so much authority tinged with affection in his voice, that Dean immediately obeys, shifting back and down until he feels Cas’s cock waiting and perfectly lined up against his hole.
“Great. Just what I needed to make this day better,” he groans. And then he glares at Ash. “There any ice laying around here? Doctor’s orders.”
He had never had this kind of connection with someone who wasn’t a woman. Did that make him gay? The question kept popping up in his head over and over. Again it was kind of hard to deny with the other
control.
“You could call it a hunch,” Cas smirks before frowning again. “Dean… from what I could tell from our brief encounter… your father is a horrible man. Bitter and jaded. And if you hadn’t broken ties with him beforehand, I would not have felt safe with him around the pup.”
“What can I say? You got good taste.”
“Yeah,” he agrees reluctantly. “No one would’ve known about me if I hadn’t started having weird symptoms.”
As soon as he walks into the kitchen, the smell of cooking meat hits him
He’d been mostly silent the entire appointment, choosing to listen closely and watch, but now Dean really looks at him. Almost leaning over Dean to get a clear view of the screen, Cas is looking between Dean and their child with glassy eyes and a watery smile, clenching his fists hard in his lap like he’s trying to keep himself together.
Cas doesn’t say anything for a few minutes, just shifts so that the arm pinned underneath Dean can wrap around his waist, moving his fingers in circles against the side of Dean’s bump.
“-Just talked to Sam. Yeah, I heard,” Jess smiles a little. It’s still light out in California, the sun shining through the window making Jess look extra blonde. “I’m proud of you for calling, and I won’t pester you anymore today. I just want to be here with you. Is that ok? What were you up to?”
Cas squeezes his hand in between them.
Seeing them there, compared to all the other bland white doors and walls helped put his mind at ease a tiny bit. What could happen to him in an office adorned with innocent little angels?
What the fuck? He did
It all happened so fast.
“It didn’t hurt before! I forgot about it,” he mutters defensively. “Is it bad?”
And yes, I shamelessly borrowed a few lines from a few fucking sad episodes of Supernatural. Sorry, not sorry :,(
“We’re good. You don’t need to protect us any more,” Dean says, deliberately applying more pressure to Cas’s hand. “Stop being an asshole so we can enjoy some breakfast, hmm? I’m just hungry enough that Sammy over there is starting to look pretty appetizing.”
Cas’s eyes narrow at him even more before he pounces; pushing Dean back and rolling on top of him so that they’re face to face. Blinking up at the Alpha in shock, he feels frozen under Cas’s sharp eyes.
“Besides,” Jess says, “doesn’t the person handing out the presents have all the power? They get to choose who opens what first and whatnot.”
Squeezing all his muscles around Cas’s cock, his orgasm blinds him, has him writhing underneath Cas as Cas fucks him through it, fingers digging deep into the muscles of Cas’s back.
“You think I’m leaving because of my
Placing one more kiss on the sensitive flesh on his chest, Cas ducked to rest his head on Dean’s stomach. “It’s not a competition, Dean. As I’ve said before, I’d like to show you. Meaning I am going to do everything in my power to make you scream my name by the end of the night. Repeatedly.”
The man was a fucking Alpha for god’s sake, he had no business being all sensitive and understanding. All his previous misgivings about Alphas had been completely dismissed in the wake of Cas, forcing him time and time again to rethink his prejudice against them. When more than likely…it was just Cas.
“Grocery store. The first one we went to. I’m in the parking lot,” is all he says before hanging up. Immediately, he calls another number.
“I’m Captain Jack Sparrow!” the little boy in the back pipes, “I even gots the same hat and everything! But this isn’t my real hair though. My mom won’t let me have long hair,” he rambles, grabbing a dreadlock to show Dean as he tries to step past the other children. “Look! It feels funny!”
It kind of felt like he’d lost fifty pounds instead of ten, he felt so light. He hadn’t realized it felt like he’d been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders from day to day. Now, without it there, he could be a different person.
“What he said,” Dean smiles, shaking his head in exasperation. “Y’know he has no idea what we’re saying right?”
“This isn’t about trust!” Bobby shouts, finally standing to glower over his desk. “I trust you with my life, kid. But we’re in too deep to go back now. I’m not taking back what I said. This is final, and if you know what’s good for you, you’ll head my words.”
He turns his head to kiss Cas’s nose. “That depends.”
Spinning around to stare at the front door with wide eyes, he’s not even aware of the cup in his fingers slipping from his grasp and shattering all around him.
“So Dean and the pup are really okay?” Sam ventures cautiously. “I know Dean said they are, but you know Dean.”
“Holy shit, Cas,” he gasps, dropping bonelessly back on to Cas’s raised knees. Cas can’t even respond, too focused on getting air back into his lungs as he drops his forehead onto Dean’s chest.
Dean snorts into the phone. “Wow dude, that was
He’d given Dean plenty of time to stop him, plenty of time to move if he’d wanted to, but he remained perfectly still as Cas grasped his face and angled his head the way he wanted before sealing his lips to Dean’s slowly.
“Let me see if I can…” she mutters under her breath, moving the wand down his belly and
Dean tries not to sigh in relief, but some of what he’s feeling must show on his face or in his scent.
“Of course I do. Everyone thinks of themselves, and I am no exception,” Cas says, continuing to stroke the back of his head. “And I’m a selfish being, Dean. That’s why you come before all else. I want you with me always. And I want you to be happy, and loved…”
“G’night Cas.”
As they both get into bed though, bed-side table still on, Dean finally notices how fucking tired Cas looks. Dark bags under his eyes, five o’clock shadow just a little too long, Cas looks 40 instead of 30. For the first time he wonders if he isn’t the only one feeling the effects of the pregnancy. Had he really been so selfish that he hadn’t even noticed Cas’s own exhaustion? He knew he’d been working really hard at the hospital, but he spent any and all free time with Dean, so when did the man take a break?
Dean is so tuned into every word he’s saying, that hopefully it’ll stick this time around.
is your problem, man?” he yells at Sam, shoving him, floppy hair and all, outside the door as hard as he fucking can, sending Sam stumbling outside in shock. “You come here fucking guns blazing,
Because the only thing he did besides work was lay around watching tv or sleep. Despite the rumors that eating makes you feel better, he’d found that it wasn’t true in his case. Nothing sounded good, and at the end of a good day, all he would eat was a pb&j and an apple. Besides the beer, that is. At least his money was going to a good cause.
“Yeah?” he asks, excited. Everything was so much more real now.
He breaks when the bed starts shaking.
Dean could feel himself drifting off again, lulled by the soft rocking movements of Cas’s hips against him. Only moving a half an hour later as Cas’s knot goes down and slips out of him, turning until he can tuck himself into Cas’s warmth again, and sighing as Cas wraps an arm around to bring him closer.
Walking further into the room to see whom the voice belonged to, he sees a dark skinned woman with wide, dark brown eyes, wearing a set of scrubs with purple flowers, and a name tag reading ‘Missouri’.
“Yeah Cas. I guess I’ll think about it.”
Not only is Benny not scheduled to come in that day, Dean forgot to take his anti-nausea pill that morning and ends up puking twice in the bathroom during his shift. Bobby had patted his back in sympathy when he’s cleaned himself up and left the now foul smelling bathroom, but when Bobby suggested he call it a day, he refused.
“Yeah, I told you about Ash, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Both,” he huffs, throwing his arms over his head and groaning. “Now I
one should have to do anything as immense as this by themselves,” He says heatedly, trying and failing to catch Dean’s eyes.
His words are cut off with a kiss. Half smile, half kiss that is.
Silence again, but something shifts a little underneath his head so there’s a good chance he missed something.
Panting as he hears murmuring though the rushing noise filling his ears, he watches the door swing open.
“I’m fine. I told you I was fine before,” he says defensively, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“Cas. I’ve never- I’ve never had someone like you,” he begins hoarsely, his heart fucking racing. “You’re always
Upon stepping through the threshold, Cas ushers him right to bed. Threatening Dean by offering to carry him again when Dean tries to argue. It does the trick even if Dean was only arguing to get a rise out of Cas in the first place.
Hearing foot steps right behind him, he steps forward, intending to escape when he feels fingers in his belt loop pulling him backwards.
Cas starts to say something but then stops himself, biting his lip. He gently untangles himself from Dean’s grip, wincing when Dean makes a noise he can’t hold back. But he only goes far enough to grab some pillows and very carefully stack them under Dean’s foot. Then he’s back.
Dean doesn’t open his eyes again. He takes a deep breath- the deepest breath he’s taken in a very long time- and sinks into Cas. He’s never been warmer. And relief easily gives way to a heavy exhaustion, pulling him first into a light doze on Cas’s chest, then into a deep- nightmare free- sleep.
He’s at Cas’s house, in their bed, with Cas asleep behind him.
“Finally,” he hears Bobby mutter under his breath.
“Yes. He… My brother and I have an…interesting relationship,” Cas begins haltingly. “We’ve never seen eye to eye. Michael never really saw eye to eye with any of our family actually, but out of the four of us, he seemed to tolerate me the most.”
Him and the pup never would have made it this far if not for Cas. Cas had given them a reason to wake up in the morning and
He thought he’d be coming with Cas inside him, he just hadn’t thought it’d be his tongue.
“And how about you, little one?” Castiel says, bending down to lay his head against the bulge, causing Dean’s heart to constrict and his jaw to drop. “How are you feeling today?”
That was bullshit of course, since he was pretty sure he could fall asleep in any position- even standing up if he had to- but Cas doesn’t know that. And he doesn’t need to know about how he’d slept with one of his shirts pressed to his nose in a desperate bid for sleep that ended up paying off. No, Cas doesn’t need to know how disgustingly pathetic Dean had become.
“Dean. Calm down,” Cas tried to soothe him. “I’m sure what you are imagining is not at all accurate. You’ve noticed your chest getting…softer, yes? And more sensitive?”
“You do have a point there,” Dean concedes, lifting his arms so that Cas can pull both of them off, one at a time.
mullet.”
Because omegas were docile, sweet, and submissive. He knew that much. They also needed a strong alpha in their life to take care of them. But that was supposed to be him! His roll was supposed to be the protector, the bread winner, not some delicate flower who got off on some dude on some dude on a power trip!
noticeable.
“Uncle Benny, you’re just old!” she giggles, squirming to get down, but then freezes. “Wait! I didn’t even get my candy yet!”
“I know that, Dean,” he says like Dean is dim. “But I know you better than that. Just go. And please… Don’t fall.”
“You were so
Mistakes are my own! I got really excited writing this, so don't judge me for them! ;)
Not for the first time, he feels extremely unworthy of this baby. Already he is too good, too pure and innocent for Dean. If he carries on the way he’s doing, he’s going to mess up his pup before it even has a chance at making it.
, he thinks to himself.
Yeah, his life is pretty great at the moment.
“Come on, Dean,” Cas murmurs softly, taking his hand, “let’s get some food in you.”
“Shut up,” he chuckles, still a little breathless. Cas has come to sit next to him again and is rubbing a soothing hand up and down his back while Dean tries to catch his breath. “We usually exchange gag gifts at Christmas, remember? You guys are the ones who broke tradition.”
Although it was a date with his doctor instead of the sexy kind like he would have preferred, it was still enough to drag his ass out of bed.
“I’m not
The truth is, he needs a minute.
“Oh it’s very hard,” Cas grunts.
Cas’s hands are immediately there to help him up.
that? You know better than that, Dean. I know you do.”
“How is this okay?” Dean gasps. “How are you so calm right now? We’re both
“What?” he says defensively. He just had a fucking life changing realization today, he thinks he deserves a little slack with his attempt at baby talk. Fuck- he’s tired!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fine, little Alpha,” he says back.
“Highly unlikely,” Cas says, covering Dean’s hand with his own and holding it in place. The pup doesn’t kick again, but they don’t move their hands away either. “You never told me about this tradition, Dean.”
His head started to pound and his breath came fast as he watched all the effort he’d put into the last twelve years literally get flushed down the toilet.
“I got this,” Ash says, stepping in between Dean’s locked arms and the car so that they’re face to face. Blinking in confusion and automatically flinching away from doritos breath, he regrets it instantly when his back twinges. Alright- couch- he could do this.
Biting his lip and scooting closer so that their sides are touching and he can feel Cas’s heat, he only spares Sam and Jess one cautious look before going for it. He’s gonna try and comfort Cas with his own scent like Cas does for him. He wishes they were in private so he could curl himself around Cas, make it so the rest of the world doesn’t exist, but he’s gotta work with what he’s got.
Until Dean attempted to free his steadily forming knot from his pants. That was the moment in which everything had become real, and he’d realized how out of control the situation had become.
He supports Dean’s weight the entire time, holding both of his arms and squatting to lower Dean carefully into the warm water. Once he’s settled, Cas swings his legs one at a time over the tub and into the water. Dean leans forward so Cas can sit behind him, and then back when Cas has either leg on the side of him and wraps his arms around his chest to pull him back.
“No, dude. Just no,” he says firmly.
“Of course, baby. It’s comfortable enough. I’ve slept there many a long nights,” Cas assures, tucking his chin to and try and catch Dean’s eyes. There’s still worry seeping from his skin, and he hates that. He was right. Cas
Cas knows immediately what he’s talking about.
As soon as he’s close enough he’s lurching for the door knob- wrenching it open- when he feels Cas tense and say, “Dean, wait-”
He had agreed, albeit grudgingly, seeing nothing wrong with the way he stocked his cabinets, and now here he was. Fucking wet and frustrated, seriously contemplating if he had enough time to jerk off before Cas got here. If he saw Cas right now, all wired up and tense, Cas would surely know that something was up, and that was
“You don’t know how I could think that huh? Well let me tell you, it wasn’t exactly hard to come to this conclusion. You are the
They knew his heat was officially over when Dean woke up from where he was dozing on the far side of the bed, shivering, and desperately trying to seek out Castiel’s warmth.
Two can play at that game.
He’d been naive then.
“Alright, that’s pretty funny,” he conceded before stuffing the rest of the breadstick into his mouth. “God these are good,” he moans, mouth still completely full.
“I’ll do my best. Try and get some rest.”
Dean pauses, remembering what’s in store for him in the morning. “What time will that be?”
Benny volunteers to take him home since he’s heading in that direction anyway to see his niece and they have to specially order the tires he’d had on the impala.
He huffs a laugh, but then he remembers the purpose of this little shopping trip.
Cas was a predator, and he was about to take down his prey. The noise from before, a deep almost animalistic growl, was getting louder and louder because Cas was running full force past him.
Cas has been staring daggers at that man the entire time they’ve been sitting, but he squints his eyes at Dean’s voice, so he knows Cas heard him.
“I’m not sure I could explain it to myself actually,” Cas laughs quietly, “but I think the best way to put it would be to say that you’re different. I’ve never met anyone who puts me so at odds. And I’ve never met anyone who has reawaken every instinct I thought I’d never had the way you do. And you’re scent, Dean…”
“I know,” Dean finishes for him.
“How could you say that?” Dean asks in disbelief, “How could this possibly be a good thing, Cas?”
After Cas leaves on Tuesday night, and he’s eaten everything except for what’s in the triangle box, he stares at it with disgust. He knows what’s in it. Cas doesn’t always bring him dessert, but when he does, it’s always the same fucking thing. So instead of pulling it out, he grabs his phone out of his pocket and hunts down the note he stashed in his mail pile next to his fridge. All he texts is;
“I am so telling Jess that you ratted her out.”
Rounding the corner he leans down over the desk to get a better look. The first frame holds a picture of three people; a man, a woman, and a little boy. They’re on a beach with the ocean in the background, the man’s arm around the woman’s waist, the little boy sleeping on the woman’s hip. Both the man and woman smiling like they know something the person taking the picture doesn’t. The picture is dated, the color having faded with time, but even if it hadn’t he’d be able to identify Cas. No one had hair like that but him. But he looked so small there, so frail. He was the spitting image of his parents.
It’s not the same thing as referring to Cas as his Alpha or anything, not even close, but it’s still something. A verbal acknowledgement of what they are, that he hadn’t even really thought to make.
Cas rolls off of him to dig around in his duffle, but Dean can hear him grumbling under his breath as he goes. “-Don’t understand why we can’t just stay in the same room.”
Looking down again, Dean presses his face and nose into Castiel’s neck once more. “For you know…uh not knotting me?” Dean says, an awkward hitch to his voice.
Castiel smiled and felt his heart constrict at Dean’s words. It was probably the first time he’d ever heard Dean refer to the pup as “ours.” Placing the bowl -which is still partially full next to the door- Castiel steps over to Dean to lay a hand on his lower back. As much as Dean pretends otherwise most of the time, he can tell the man is fighting his exhaustion. Pulling him close and leading him inside, he can’t help but think tonight was a success.
“I’m not sure that you will like my answer, Dean.”
“That’s what I thought,” Cas murmurs quietly, so calm and collected, so at odds with the way he’s playing Dean like a fiddle. One finger slips inside him, the way smoothed by a very generous amount of slick.
“Your back,” Cas wheezes, rubbing his fingers into Dean’s muscles. “Need to be careful. Don’t want you to strain yourself.”
When Cas didn’t move, continuing to stare at him with those fucking intense blue eyes, Dean leaned over to shove him as hard as he could off the bed. “I said GET OUT!” he screamed as Cas stumbled, trying to catch his balance before face planting on the floor, “Right the fuck now, dude.”
All the while his fingers sink in juuuuust that much deeper. Cas situates himself on top of him-between his legs- and looks content to stay there.
Pausing mid-step, he turns to Benny in question. He’d thought he’d had his “don’t fuck with me” face on, but hey, today was an off day for him.
Castiel showing up to his door at some ungodly hour. Maybe he’d abuse that power sometime in the near future…
The man narrowed his beady little eyes at Bobby but still nodded. Turning for the door, he didn’t wait for Bobby to follow him before walking briskly over to his car.
Watching as Cas spins around to leave, his mouth hangs open as Cas turns to look over his shoulder and fucking
“I think it’s going to be okay, Castiel. I have faith in both of you.”
Thankfully, Dean seems to agree. Turning around and worming his way over to Cas, Castiel lays flat and pulls Dean against him. Dean’s head is pillowed on his shoulder so that he can keep scenting him, and Castiel’s hand immediately goes to pet Dean’s hair again, the other around his bare waist to keep him close.
He knew, he
Taking his bottom lip between his teeth and feeling heat fill his cheeks that has nothing to do with embarrassment for once, he decides on a more
“No, Dean,” Jess laughs, “Just
For as much doubt as he was having now though, he couldn’t really envision another option other than the one he’d come to. It was this or that, black or white, with no shades of gray, and he felt like he was trapped having to choose between the lesser of two evils.
“Are you okay?” Cas whispers hoarsely, continuing to stroke Dean’s stomach through his shirt. There was no kick back, the baby probably doing what they should’ve been doing, and sleeping.
Unless food poisoning lasted a week and a half, he guessed that’s not what was making him throw up every fucking day at random ass times. It was mostly in the morning, usually waking him up early as fuck, forcing him to start his day
When they turn into Cas’s bedroom and then immediately turn for the bathroom, he can see Cas’s eyebrows rise in confusion.
- he’d promised Cas they would watch them.
It was not so funny when it was
one in this entire family born a weak, lost, little
“Fuck!” he shouts. Covering his face quickly with shaking hands before fisting them and banging them hard against the bed. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!” he breathes, thumping his head thrice against the mattress.
“Good morning. Although technically it is the afternoon, I believe the sentiment is the same.” Cas says, while sitting down on the edge of the bed, obviously not catching Dean’s glare. So much for being a people reader.
“I think you got us confused,” he whispers, tilting his head to the right as Cas leans in to scent at his neck while his fingers continue to stroke his stomach. Absently, he lets his fingers tangle loosely in Cas’s hair, the long strands soft against his skin, just as soothing as the brush of Cas’s lips against his neck. “I’m the one who is emotionally constipated.”
be enough,” Cas says through a little smile that’s sure to haunt him for the rest of his life. “I’m leaving.”
“Guess I never thought of it that way.”
Before all this mess had happened, Cas was on his ass going up and down the stairs. One hand gripping one of Dean’s while the other was supporting his back. At the time he’d found it kind of irritating- because he could do it himself, dammit- but now he missed the support; the surety that came with Cas’s grip, and the comfort that came with knowing that Cas would be there to catch him if he fell.
“Can you just…not,” Dean sighs in exasperation. “I don’t want to talk about this.”
The words are accompanied by firmer strokes to the bottom of his belly. “I can’t wait for you to meet your father, little one. He’s so strong and good,” he trails off, continuing to run his hands all over the pup under the water. It’s intimate and so fucking gentle. “I hope you’ll be just like him. The two of you light up my world…I’m certain you know this by now, but I don’t think there’s any harm in repeating it as often as possible. Your father and I love you very much, sweetheart.”
Yeah, not likely.
bedroom, and plus, he has the excuse of putting them in the only guest bedroom with it’s own heater.
“You have to be fucking
He needs something- something to push him over the edge.
As the second week comes and goes, Dean actually uses the number Cas had left all those weeks ago. He has no idea why he hadn’t immediately thrown it away, but he’s kind of glad he didn’t. Because this was important shit.
“You can’t honestly believe you can pick him - ” Bobby starts to say before the words die in his mouth.
Dean laughs loudly and kisses that stupid look right off of his face.
“-Shit. Yeah. I got that,” he says impatiently, almost shoving passed a hovering Cas to grab the milk and a spoon. “I couldn’t sleep. Doesn’t mean you guys have to stare like I’m the newest attraction at the circus.”
Too hard.
They’re naked and pressed together, but somehow Cas still wants him closer. Isn’t that something?
But he makes it through. Even staying an extra two hours after his shift to help catalogue a new shipment that had just come in. By the time he gets back to his apartment and sees Cas’s Prius already in his guest parking spot, he’s ready to kneel over.
“It’s Dean. Need someone to tow the impala tomorrow. It’s in the parking lot of the grocery store on Pine street,” he rattles off without thinking about it.
And it’s everything he’s ever wanted.
There is a heavy weight on his chest at the same time as his mind shuts down. He can’t think about anything other than two things.
“What does that-
“Izz your house, man. Knock yourself out,” he thinks he manages to slur. If Cas’s laugh is anything to go by, he probably sounded like an idiot. Too bad he doesn’t care.
Since Dean hadn’t experienced a heat since he’d first presented, the poor man had probably been completely blindsided. Yes he recalled Dean’s scent being a tad bit off before his departure, but he hadn’t of smelled of heat yet. It must have hit sometimes later. But with the way Dean regarded himself in regards to his gender designation…he’d probably been even more shocked. It didn’t sound as if Dean really knew what was happening or why, and Castiel was reminded of just how much Dean didn’t know.
He could clearly see his dad’s face right before he drew his arm back for the hit; starting the spectrum of emotions at guilty, then surprised, then fucking
Cracking up and shaking his head, he reaches over to grab a bite of his fourth donut and then offers it to Cas who takes a distracted bite and quickly turns back to his task of figuring out how to get the star to light up. The two of them probably look fucking ridiculous right now, acting like kids decorating for their first Christmas, but he really could not care less. This is what happiness feels like.
Whimpering in desperation, Dean’s head snaps up as he immediately obeys. Throwing all his effort behind his movements now, he rides back into Cas faster and harder, tearing sounds he didn’t even know he could make from himself.
Dean starts to squirm underneath him, trying and failing to trap Cas in place with his thighs. Laughing quietly to himself, Castiel keeps moving. Only placing a gentle kiss on the swell of Dean’s stomach before moving lower.
“Alright. We’re in the clear for now. I’m taking you in tomorrow for a more thorough analysis. I’m much more concerned about your temperature at the moment. Come on, you’ve been exposed long enough,” Cas says, stepping close. “Lets get you warmed up.”
“Are you alright?” Cas rasps.
There’s nothing like this feeling.
“Fat?” he mutters under his breath.
of you knows the merits of eating a balanced diet.”
He’s too used to Cas fretting over his every move to do anything other than roll his eyes and smirk up at him. “You’re lucky I’m actually finished, and I’m fine. Just needed a flat surface or these woulda looked a lot shittier,” he nods to the three presents now completely wrapped and ribboned. Not too shabby.
Bobby had pulled him into a hug and hadn’t let go until Dean had stopped shaking.
Walking right to Cas, Dean wraps his arms around Cas’s waist and noses at his neck. Ducking a bit to press his face in close, Dean scents him, breathing him in and holding his breath. It’s something they’ve been doing a lot more often, but still feels significant, feels like something special between mates. And he’s hoping Cas can pick up on the regret in his scent.
“We are,” he agrees. “But I wouldn’t have us any other way.”
Cas smiles back at him, obviously relieved. “Thank you, Dean. Call me if you need anything. I might not be able to answer you right away if I’m attending a lecture, but I will get back to you as soon as possible.”
Cas doesn’t push him for words, only continues to whisper sweet words of encouragement and praise into his ear for long minutes. It’s only when both their breathing is back under control that Dean clears his throat, which is completely raw from the events of this morning.
Dean clenches his eyes shut and hunches over his knees, hopefully covering enough of himself to shield the other men from his shame. God, if he had to stand up, there would be no hiding the mess he was.
“Hey,” he says softly, grabbing Cas’s shoulder when the Alpha reaches for the door handle.
idea, I thought last night was mutual, I am
“-should I get him a bucket or something?” Sam asks. Dean missed the first part of the sentence, but he’s embarrassed enough about the second part of it that he holds a fist over his mouth to clamp it down and shakes his head.
He’s not sure who whispers, “Goodnight, baby,” but there’s a fifty percent chance it might have been him.
“Just listen to what he has to say,” Jess begs for the thousandth time. “Even if it’s just the voicemails I know he’s left you.”
Moaning as he rubs himself against it hard, feeling the jean material underneath him quickly become soaked by all his slick, he claws at Cas’s back and uses his new leverage to press himself down even harder.
Shit, Sam sounded
“Cas. What are you doing here, man?” he asked as he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and tried not to ogle the man before him, “I thought I told you to spare yourself. There’s nothing pretty going on here, believe me.”
Correctly guessing the source of his sudden tension, Cas pulls back from their embrace enough to look down at Dean’s face. Keeping their faces way closer than they would have normally. Before last night, that is.
young man I’ve had the good fortune to meet. Frankly, I’m lucky to have you working for me…”
that was my last pair,” he groans, waddling away from Cas as much as possible before Cas stops him with an arm around his waist.
you. And I certainly don’t love you.”
His whole body ached. He’d thrown off his soiled comforter and sheets and he sat shaking with his arms around himself. He’d barely been able to sleep. He’d thought it had all been a fucking horrible dream. But the puddle of slick around him thrust him into the cold reality that this was now his life. There was no going back.
Another few minutes pass before he’s comfortable with Cas sliding out his fingers. It’s uncomfortable and wet, and he immediately misses the fullness, but as soon as Cas is free he’s rolling to his feet, pushing down Dean’s shoulders when he moves to follow.
He can hear the sigh of relief from the other line, and it makes his heart flutter a little. “That’s so good to hear, Dean. I’m glad you are working with good men, and hopefully, good friends.”
Watching his scent blockers being flushed down the toilet was probably one of the hardest things he’s had to do. Those were the last representations of the life he used to live, and the person everyone thought they knew.
“Yes, Dean?” he hears Cas say softly.
“C’mon little Alpha. It’s just me,” he whispers again, ghosting his lips over Cas’s pulse point before kissing the skin there. He tries to convey his concern and offer comfort through his scent like Cas does for him, but he’s not too sure it’s working.
“Cas,
“He only wishes,” Dean smirk, playing along as he takes her hand firmly in his. “It’s Dean though, if you’re asking. Nice to meet you.”
Cas turns the corner quickly, and then that’s when their eyes meet.
“Never going to let anyone hurt you, pup,” he promises quietly.
,” Dean gasps like he just sprinted a couple of miles. He’s winded and overwhelmed, and thank
He looks over his shoulder at Cas’s chuckle, “Alright. Don’t go too crazy, Dean,” he says fondly, “Find me when you’re done.”
Cas narrows his eyes at him. “Dean Winchester, I know you enough to know that that is a blatant lie. Admit it, you fully intend to go straight back to bed as soon as you return don’t you?”
a lot prettier than you, dude.”
“How long do you guys get to stay for, again?” he interrupts whatever moment they were having. He’d hate for today to be the last time they got to hang out for a while. Especially after the change of venue.
He must miss some exchange between Cas and his brother, because Cas squeezes him and leans down to kiss his forehead, using his scent to send Dean comfort. “He’s okay. Dean’s just experiencing a little bit of a hormonal fluctuation. The last few weeks have been hard on him. It should pass in a few days.”
to acknowledge out loud, like it was a dirty little secret that would condemn him straight to hell for even thinking about it. Like maybe after knowing that about him,
“It does matter,” Cas cuts in softly. “Tell me.”
Except for the tree and the random strands of Christmas lights Cas must’ve hung up along with long strands of garland and fake snow. With the Christmas lights on, there’s a merry sort of glow about the house that has him smiling and shaking his head. Trust Cas to go about making this house look like Christmas in the span of a couple of hours. What he’d done was pretty friggin’ magical, and he could feel his own excitement for the holidays grow because of it.
“Oh thank fuck,” Dean sighs in relief, “Yeah, let’s do it. Can you write it down for me?”
Gritting his teeth and forcing his eyes up while one hand protectively covered his bump, he’d tried to sound as polite as possible when he uttered the customary greeting, “Hi, what can I do for you today?”
But as Cas slowly begins kissing down his body, sending shivers throughout every part of him, he comes to another realization.
Spitting curses under his breath he took the blanket and a pillow and dragged them over to the couch, and flopped unceremoniously in a heap.
an omega rather than being one myself…I- uh… the thing with Cas, uh…God, you’re going to make me say it aren’t you?” he groans.
Absently, he runs his fingers over his belly, brought back to the horror of thinking he’d hurt her- or worse, lost her. He’d been so stupid to risk something like that. He can feel himself getting upset all over again, so he tries to take a deep breath to settle himself before continuing. Damn, everything is just
“Dean… I don’t want embarrass you…”
“I was there, Dean. And I heard you say those were your last pair. Why did you wait so long to say something?”
It was nice to see Cas smiling so much, so he would wait to start teasing him over it for at least a few days.
sick. But you were too blinded by your self-righteous bullshit to see past your narrow minded little world. You jumped to conclusions because that’s what you’ve been expecting since the day I presented, isn’t it?” he pauses, “Did I even stand a chance?” he can’t help but ask quietly.
?! You? A male omega, holy
Fuck, he was off Monday, but worked from 10:00am-2:00pm on Tuesday. That meant he’d have to go to work like this. Shit.
“But I shoulda waited for you to give ‘em on your own time. I know you been struggling. I can see it in the way you hold yourself, man. Did you truly think that I woulda judged you ‘cuz of the way you were born? Or the people who make you happy? I don’t call you ‘brother’ for nothing, Dean.”
“I love you,” Cas says so quietly that Dean stops breathing to hear. “I love you so much, Dean.”
Hopping off the stool and going to where he was directed, he takes in what he can as he walks down the hallway. No pictures, no art, no personal touches that scream
He’s about to leave when he remembers to brush his teeth. Going back to the bathroom, he quickly grabs his toothbrush and squirts tooth paste on. As soon as it touches his tongue he gags and throws up all over the sink. It came on so fast he couldn’t even react, couldn’t even think to take a step towards the toilet. He leans over the sink, trying to not get anything on the floor, but it’s dripping out his nose and dry heaves have him hunched over and looking for any barf free available space to brace himself. He closes his eyes for a second when it’s done, but the revolting smell has them opening again to focus on something else.
Cas smiles and squeezes him once before heading back over to the tree. “Dean. Then Sam and Jess again.”
“Now don’t throw a fit. But I’m,” Bobby hesitates, looking up at Dean, face hardening. “I’m puttin’ you on the register.”
“It’s okay, little Alpha. You’re doing the right thing,” he reassures him gently. There isn’t really anything else he can say. That’s some heavy shit. And of course, Cas
But as soon as he lets it go, he’s leaning away from Dean and towards Cas, whispering obnoxiously, “The pup is
“Are you sure?”
They had finally gotten themselves out of bed, neither of them had to work today, so the plan was to eat and then they were going to take Cas’s Lord of the Rings virginity. Cas was leading the way into Dean’s little kitchen, looking like he was on a mission, when the contents of Dean’s cupboards flashed through his mind. There was a box of pop tarts, a box of lucky charms, and four bottles of empty liquor he’d stashed having told himself he’d throw them away later. The fridge wasn’t much better off. To say Cas was unimpressed was an understatement.
“Casti
“Harder,” he moans, closing his eyes and giving into the pleasure. Cas’s cock feels so fucking good inside him. Why was he freaking out so much before? This was awesome.
Slowly, so slowly he knew he was probably being over dramatic, Dean lowers his head in the dark to look down at his stomach. How
“Yeah,” Dean agrees at the same time as Cas says, “Of course.”
Dean wants to fight Cas on this, wants to insist that he can walk, but as soon as Cas lifts him his back screams in protest and he can’t remember how to work his mouth besides the pained cry that slips out. He can tell Cas is trying to be as careful as possible, cradling Dean gently against his body, but it’s not enough.
“Don’t wait too long,” he sighs, reaching down to rub his bump. He hasn’t felt him kick at all today, he thinks.
Cas takes both of his legs and hitches them a little bit higher- massaging them all the while- getting just a little bit deeper.
Silently.
He moves it almost experimentally, ignoring the pain in favor of watching how fucked up it looks at different angles.
Seeing Sam off was made a lot easier knowing that he’d be seeing his brother again soon. It was weird knowing that Cas and his brother had been the ones to discuss meeting up again, especially after their disastrous introduction, but when he was watching Sam head for his gate, turning around to wave one more time, he’d found himself so fucking grateful for it.
He is damn curious though. Just as he takes a step forward to butt in he realizes that Jess is coming towards him with arms held aloft. Opening his arms instinctively, he gathers her into the circle of his arms and greedily clings to her heat. She’s friggin’ tiny in his arms, squished up against his huge belly, and as she takes a huge, shutter breath, he gets the feeling that she needs the comfort he offers her right now.
“Dean, wait,” Cas says, grabbing his shoulder and turning Dean around to face him.
The pup made him happy.
. It wasn’t till now that he’d realized how much Sam’s opinion actually mattered to him. All this time he’d been holding on to Sam’s words, justifying his silence towards him because of them, but under that he’d been silently stewing over the bigger issue here, centered around Sam being in the dark about the changes his life had been subjected to. Part of him had been afraid that even if he had picked up the phone and spilled his guts, Sam would still end up rejecting him. Hearing otherwise now was a huge weight being lifted from his shoulders.
After he showers, shaves, dresses in a baggy hoodie once more and eats, he’s out the door, only pausing to look down at his phone that shows a text from Cas saying, “Let me know how it goes. Call if you need me.” Besides the text, which made him smile a tiny bit, he shuts down his emotions. Dean is on autopilot. He’s not thinking as he drives to work, and he’s not thinking as he parks his car, walks towards garage, and straight through the doors.
about it!
“You sure about that, Cas?” he thrusts his hips up, rubbing their cocks together in a move that makes them both hiss. “Don’t think either of us would last very long…” he trails off hopefully, lust still evident in his scent and voice.
Breathing hard, he gags as he finishes, not even trying to get up despite the fact that he’s in a public restroom and the floor is probably covered in germs. Closing his eyes and trying to get his hitched breathing under control, he shifts to lean against the wall, sitting on his ass as he brings his knees to his chest. Thinking about that last couple of minutes, he fights the urge to puke again, working through it in his shock.
Cas groans when Dean pulls away, shaking his head against Dean’s forehead and breathing hard. “You don’t have to do this, Dean.”
Cas presses his forehead against him and says, “I don’t know what I would have done without you both…”
Something on Benny’s face changes, and he knows a second before Benny starts to speak that it’s not a good something.
He notices the very obvious way Cas avoids the word “help” in that sentence.
He leans into the touch with a small smile before turning back around when he hears a pointed throat clear.
“What is it?” Cas mutters in the darkness.
“And which point was that, brother? The fact that you been lyin to us all about yourself? Or maybe the fact that you are with an Alpha I ain’t never heard a word about before all this?” Benny smiles humorlessly, and Dean is surprised to steel behind his narrowed gaze. “You shut down for weeks- months actually- and then act like everything is fine? It don’t work like that, Dean.”
“What does it look like I’m doing?” he croaks, curling in on himself even more.
Shaking his head to clear it, he still moans when Cas adds both his fingers along with his tongue. It’s with great difficulty that he tries to find his voice again.
“You’re probably right,” he chuckles, pushing at Cas’s shoulder. “Ok, who’s next?”
“More than happy,” he breathes. “Thank you so - ”
And he’d never seen anything so beautiful.
While those two
Rolling his eyes, Dean opens his door.
“Before I leave, there’s something I’d like to ask you,” Cas says, hesitating warily, squeezing Dean’s hand.
“Finally,” Sam grouses under his breath when they walk into the room.
“Hmmm?” is Cas’s sleepy response.
The other man smiles but doesn’t ask what he and Missouri talked about.
Moving in increments small enough not to bother Cas, he tries and tries to get comfortable; only ending up hurting his back more. He’s so fucking frustrated, wishing he could scent at Cas’s neck like he usually would when he couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t even feel Cas’s heat next to him- having rolled over on his side facing away from Dean- and this whole back thing and this whole not being able to sleep with Cas thing was just not working out.
“Deal,” Dean agrees quickly, releasing one of his hands around Cas’s neck to smooth the worry lines between Cas’s brow. “Now relax, and help me up.”
Alright. Maybe Gabriel wasn’t so bad.
Nothing happens.
after I finally told her what I said to you? She’s an Omega too, Dean, you aren’t the only one I disappointed.”
His hold tightens around him- literally clinging to him like if he clings hard enough they can stay here like this forever.
Cas moves to help him up, but he doesn’t need him. As abruptly as the nausea had come, it seemed to be subdued with Cas’s scent in his immediate proximity. But at least now he knew he wasn’t the only affected by the other’s scent. It was weirdly comforting not to be so alone, even if was prevented by Cas.
“You gave in, didn’t you? Found yourself a nice alpha to submit to, I’d guess. You were always weak, and it was always in your nature. Should have known it was only a matter of time…”
Pushing Cas’s shoulders back a little, Cas gets the picture and lets Dean manipulate him until he’s where Dean wants him. With their bottom halves aligned. Cas is looking at him, confused, until Dean places both hands against Cas’s back and pushes him
Cas hesitates again, his head tilting to the side before he highs and slouches backwards on to the couch, abandoning his attempt at not inhaling too deeply. His face remains tense though, and Dean can tell he’s thinking about what he’s about to say. Probably planning on sugar coating it, then, and if he knows Cas, it’s probably for his own “benefit.”
When Dean hesitates, Cas squeezes him even closer, the space between them nonexistent.
Squirming a little in his panic, Dean only managed to wedge himself closer to the man holding him tight, rocking his hips unintentionally into the hand that was jacking him lazily.
“This might sound a little silly,” Cas starts, but he’s still smiling. “There’s been no definitive studies that support as much…but there’s no harm in trying. Some suggest that parents play classical music while their babies are in the womb. To soothe and comfort them.”
And when he saw that I hurt you, he tried to protect
Since he’s already caused a scene before they’d even had breakfast, he pats Cas’s hands before stepping away and heading for the pantry. He doesn’t look back to see if Cas is following him, and he can’t look at Sam and Jess, who he knows are both staring holes into the back of his head.
Oh, it's on.
“Then we’ll have to change that,” Cas says firmly. “We’ll start now. Going forward, we can start preparing ourselves. We’ll take it day by day, Dean. Together.”
pass my test,” Benny chuckles as Dean walks by him.
“Shoulda said so before, but I was scared,” he rasps. “M’not anymore. I love you, I love you, I love you-“
“Where to even start?” Dean sighs, pulling the blankets tighter around himself. “It’s a lot. My head is still spinning and everything kind of sucks right now. But the short version is; I’m a fucking idiot.”
Trading touches in the dark, tucking himself close to share his heat, to scent him….he turned off his brain and just let himself breath for once. Let himself feel safe.
Stepping back to let Cas in, Cas goes to set down the food he brought, but waits until Dean follows him before sitting down.
He can feel his heartbeat thrumming as fast as hummingbird wings, but a million times more heavy and a trillion times more painful. Each breath hurts. Like he’d just sprinted a mile or five without stopping. He feels another breath, and then he can smell something.
Sam and Jess were already like the doting grandparents this pup would never have, so seeing them climb out of their rental car and head for the trunk was a depressing sight.
He ignores the tears pooling in those blue eyes he loves so much.
Right where a mating mark would go.
The one time he does stay longer that week is Friday. On Friday, he brings enough food for himself this time, and they eat together while they watch star wars. It’s not actually as awkward as it sounds, except for when he has to leave towards the end of the movie to puke real quick. But he recovers like a champ, and even finishes off another breadstick. Besides Cas’s hovering as he did his business, and Cas’s passive annoyance from Dean’s refusal to let Cas into the bathroom, the night was a success.
“Not today, Meg,” Cas says to her, “Is there a table for three available instead?”
All through out work, he could feel the panic start to grow, hot and spiky, inching its way up from his toes until it settled in his chest, weighing him down with it’s gravity. He barely talked to anyone, ignoring the guys when they gathered around in the front to gossip like old ladies, and he couldn’t stomach more than a protein bar on his lunch break. He ended up sitting inside his Baby listening to Zep, hoping the familiar words and beat would put him at ease enough to tackle the rest of his shift.
“Seriously, Dean? I thought we were having a moment,” she sighs, but he can hear the smile in her voice.
“Wow,” Sam whispers in awe, eyes and smile wide. “Dean, this is…”
Dean hikes up his hips around Cas’s back, hissing when the fingers still inside him shift a little, but pulls Cas in closer, whispering, “C’mon Cas. Come.”
“How are you feeling, Dean? Are you okay?” Cas asks softly, continuing his soothing touch over his sore muscles.
Dean’s hair is mussed from sleep and his cheeks are sleep warm and flushed. Green eyes look up at him, trusting and soft, and he’s very tempted to slip back into bed and repeat their morning activities. Dean’s scent this far into the pregnancy was driving his inner Alpha absolutely insane. It was actually almost painful to leave him right now, but they only had a small window of time and it needed to be done.
Cas was trying- just like him- to figure all this shit out. Yet he was always the steady one, always there to provide support for Dean when he felt out of depth and lost. It was at this exact moment that he realized how hard Cas was
He grabs that hand and brings it to his mouth- kissing his palm quickly.
Cas looks torn between not wanting to step farther away from his bed, and going to retrieve Dean’s chart from where he’d dropped it on the floor when Dean had gotten sick.
“You don’t have to go in today, Dean,” Cas says gently, but his scent and the way his knuckles are turning white around the steering wheel belie the stress he’s feeling. He’s pretending to be calm on Dean’s behalf. “I’m sure everyone would understand if you needed some time.”
“I know,” he murmurs after a minute.
“Oh, shut up,” he growls mockingly. “Get your damn phone out and take the picture. My camera sucks ass.”
Knocking again, he waited and listened. Listened for any indication that Dean was there. Even that Dean was there and just didn’t intend on getting the door.
“I didn’t. Not like this anyway,” Dean said quietly, awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck in an attempt to lessen the weight of two pairs of eyes trained intensely on him. “But uh…I’m cool with it now.”
“But-“
Then Cas was fully seated inside him.
Best plan ever.
a mouthful. He seems…nice? Reacted reasonably well to getting punched,” he winces.
feeling small. You made me
Trying desperately to play catch up, and to assimilate the new information
Cas turns and kisses the fingers still pressed against his cheek, but doesn’t say anything for which Dean is grateful.
Fuck- he knew it! The only reason Cas was acting so oddly was him. But why? It was hardly the first time he’d seen him shirtless…
“Just wanted to help you with your coat, Dean,” Cas insisted innocently. He holds up Dean’s coat as proof when Dean scoffs. “It’s freezing out and you seem to be running cold during your pregnancy.”
“Yeah well, I wonder why,” he snaps defensively, keeping his back to Cas to hide his blush. Cas didn’t need to know why he was feeling particularly sentimental. He’d said ‘overwhelmed,’ and he definitely was that.
Immediately Cas is stepping forward and into his space, grabbing Dean’s face firmly on either side. Forcing Dean’s chin up to look him in the eyes. They’re wild in their worry, and Dean flinches from their intensity and tries to hide again. Cas isn’t having it.
“Both,” he sighs reluctantly, not wanting to let go of Cas or move really- at all. But he couldn’t realistically keep Cas here all day- he’d already hogged up way too much time. “Can I come with you?”
“Dean. That clinic has been closed for a month now, due to malpractice.”
“Hey Cas,” he says without looking at him, choosing instead to walk around him to unlock the door, “Sorry to keep you, man.”
Dean lets his eyes close.
to where he needs to be.
Cas nuzzles against his cheek, squeezing him tighter. “Now we don’t have to worry about that. I’m never going to grow tired of your scent. You smell so good right now, Dean.”
As if sensing where his thoughts have wondered, he feels a hand on his shoulder. Opening his eyes and turning his head, Jess’s smile is the last thing he thinks he’ll see.
“I couldn’t agree more.”
And- okay, what the
He had to hand it to the guy, he’d been wrong thinking that Cas couldn’t be more shocked. Cas’s entire face was frozen in a mask of utter surprise that had him scrambling to find words to properly articulate himself. For such a big bad Alpha, the expression on his face was thoroughly amusing Dean.
“Later,” Cas promises, searching Dean’s eyes and leaning down for a peck. “That is if you’re coming back tonight?”
that sings between them, a sweet something that has them both smiling when they break apart.
One, there’s pain from his back, an sharp ache that has him afraid to move further. Two, there’s relief from the pressure the pup puts on his body when’s sitting. Yeah he’s a little top heavy now, but it feels good to stand. Those two things, so different and warring for his attention at the same time, make him even more determined to ride this out.
“Of course little missy,” Benny says. Looking down at the fairy in his arms one more time, he grins at Dean.“Dean, it was good seein’ you. You look good, chief. I guess I’ll seeya soon. You be careful now, ya hear?”
pup,” Cas emphasizes with a nip to Dean’s neck. “Anything you want. Anytime. Your father is joking, he and I will always be there to care for you.”
“Of course,” Jess says. “Don’t worry about anything, Deanie-weenie, we’ll be here when you feel better.”
“Slow down, Dean,” Cas cautions, squeezing Dean’s hand at one point.
“Awwwww…” he hears Jess coo somewhere over Cas’s shoulder, causing him to roll his eyes. He forgot about those two.
And then Cas fucking
“Think whatever you like,” Dean says simply. “I’m done.”
He doesn’t correct her. It would be too complicated. So he just nods.
“I wouldn’t attribute your throat being sore from your heat though,” Cas interrupts, smirking, “It’s from - ”
After he’d hung up the phone with Cas and put his plan in motion, he’d eaten as much as he could stomach, filled up a glass of water to keep by his bed, text Cas that he’d be going to sleep now, and cautiously laid back on the sheets.
“Because, Dean,” Cas says, finally turning his head to stare into Dean’s eyes, another tiny smile on his lips, “I can see how much it has helped you these last few weeks.”
He’s torn out of his trance harshly by the sensation of new slick trickling out of him.
Their sex life had increased since the car incident. Exponentially. And these days, with a little more than week until Christmas, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Every single day, no matter what happened, they continue to get closer and closer. Emotionally and physically. It was all he could do to keep up; the pup continuing to grow inside him, working as much as he could, and touching Cas as much as possible. Since they both had the day off today, you better believe he was going to fucking sleep in for once.
In his entire life- Dean had never seen his dad cry. Trying to picture it was nearly impossible because the idea of John letting himself be that vulnerable or empathetic is ludicrous. Just like the idea of John checking himself into rehab.
Cas looks at him like it might be his turn to cry, stunned speechless.
He would never have chosen this for himself.
“I said, umm. Lets finish up with the presents?” Sam says as serious as he can muster with his shoulders shaking. “I’m going to go with that,” he chuckles, “then we can eat.”
After three weeks, he barely knows the guy.
A beautiful smile lights up her face.
“You must promise to sit if you are in too much pain. And we need to make this visit short so you aren’t on your feet for too long, alright?”
Smiling at the sight, he decides this is going to be a fast trip. In and out. It’ll only take a couple hours, but even that’s too long to be away from Dean and their pup.
“Enough. You don’t get to talk badly about yourself anymore. I won’t allow it,” Cas says angrily, flipping his fingers to squeeze Dean’s between them. If there’s any way to bring Cas out of a freak out, it’s apparently talking shit on himself. Good to know for the future, he thinks wryly.
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas says quietly. “You obviously needed the sleep. Did you get in late from work?”
would be happening. Well his ass could suck it!
Cas kissed him like it was going out of style, and Dean was more than on board with that line of action. Walking through the door as soon as he got there, on the couch as whatever stupid ass show played in the background, in the kitchen as they microwaved the food that they were supposed to have eaten an hour ago, and of course, before Cas left for the day. Fast, slow, fevered, or soft, it didn’t really matter. They never went farther than kisses, or shyly taking turns scenting the other, and Dean was super fucking relieved about it.
HAHA bet you were surprised to see an update this soon! I apologize if it's a bit rough, I was writing like a woman possessed this weekend, so I haven't read over it much. Is it weird that this is one of my favorite chapters so far, though? You'll see why ;)
He has to keep talking or he’ll be distracted by the aphrodisiac that was the smell of Dean’s slick. If he let himself dwell, he was sure Dean would be able to scent his own interest, which was the last thing he wanted right now.
“I’m not gay,” He blurted. Might as well get that over with, he thought as he turned to face the bar again.
“I can see the way you look at him. Dean might be oblivious, but it’s clear as day. You love him, don’t you?”
“It will fade with time and better scents, beautiful,” Cas reassures him, then hesitates. “Your apartment on the other hand…will need to be thoroughly cleaned and aired out.”
“Okaaaay, not exactly what I meant, but yeah, I’m game,” he side eyes Cas and kind of wonders what he’s getting himself into here. “I meant, like wall sex, and shower sex, and maybe hard to walk the next day kinda sex that’s hard to do when I’m …big as shit.”
Everything slows down.
Biting his lip as Cas smirks at him before fucking diving back in, he can’t help the keen that passes through his clenched teeth when Cas twists his tongue inside him again.
“Will do. Try and focus, babe. I’ll see you in a little while,” Dean says, sounding way more confident and upbeat than he feels.
Dean didn’t know which was scarier, the out of control man from before, or this deathly calm that had settled over the Alpha, reminding Dean of a cobra coiling itself tight before its strike.
Before Jess can say another word, he has his laptop closed and fighting his way to his feet.
Dean bites his lip to silence himself, but the absence of his moans only highlights the obnoxious
“This isn’t about me, Dean,” Cas tells him patiently. “This is about you, and your family. I’m sorry if I offended you. I tend to lose myself when it comes to you. I apologize, please continue.”
Three weeks was definitely too long to go without this.
“Damn,” he mumbles thickly, alerting Sam that he’d woken up, “Didn’t mean to fall asleep on you guys. My bad.”
“That’s why I said it’s time for ‘us’ to shower, rather than just you.”
Dean’s scent is practically causing him physical pain, but it’s not the only scent he can smell dominating the room. It’s silent except for the movie and he’s almost positive that not one pair of eyes is trained on the screen. Sam and Jessica’s concern is too strong to be watching anything other than Dean and himself.
He doesn’t wait for Sam’s answer, doesn’t wait to think about what he’s doing or what this means before he’s spinning around to face Cas, angling himself in front of him, putting himself between Cas and Sam, before taking Cas’s face in his hands.
“Good girl,” he praises, lifting all his sweaters so he’s able to feel her better, running his fingers over his skin again and again. “Every where else is fair game. You go ahead and kick daddy as much as you want, okay? I don’t mind.”
“Dean, are you alright? You look exhausted,” Cas worries, Alpha concern flooding his senses.
“We needed to do that anyway, Dean,” Cas throws an arm around him and starts to drag him towards the edge of the bed. “Your brother should be arriving in only a few short hours.”
A startled laugh works its way out of his throat, but the slight vibrations it causes has his brain quickly turning off.
He’s startled out of his pondering by someone knocking on his door. Again.
“I will also try to abstain from cursing,” Cas volunteers, but Dean just rolls his eyes.
“Likewise. Castiel, you better be careful, this one’s a stunner. I don’t know how you managed to keep him all for yourself this long.”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean pants, squeezing the heads with a twist of his wrist. “You close?”
Although he doesn’t immediately recognize the voice, it sounds familiar and decidedly feminine. Turning in what feels like slow motion, his shock is perfectly mirrored in the face staring back at him.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Sam asks him, worried.
Biting his lip and blinking away fucking exhaustingly relieved tears, he takes a deep, shaky breath. Cas squeezes his hand, and damned if that doesn’t make him even more emotional. Turning the corner to the bedroom, grateful that Cas knows his way in the dark, Cas doesn’t let go of his hand until he carefully sits Dean down on the bed. Sinking to his knees a little clumsily, causing a loud thud that disrupts the silence, he unlaces Dean’s boots before pulling them off completely and setting them aside.
“Dean I -”
might not be fragile, but the pup
“That’s a tough one. I’m gonna have to go with the cooking channel. Unless Guy Fieri is on. I don’t know what it is about that guy, but I can’t stand him.”
Turning his head away for a second, John bites his lip before raising his eyebrows and clenching his eyes shut. When he opens them and turns to look at Dean again, he braces himself for the shit-storm his dad is about to release.
Dr. Shurley finally turned back to him, looking distinctly uncomfortable.
he thinks about his own kid. His little pudger. No matter what happened, he would
“Can I ask you a question?”
Apparently his gagging was answer enough. He hears the bathroom door open and then the light is blinding him as Cas switches it on.
Now, he honestly had no clue what his father was talking about. Was John drinking again? “Resist what? Please dad, enlighten me.”
Cas just stares at him a second, trying to see if Dean is lying to him, before he relaxes. And then he’s leaning in- what the fuck? Cas’s face is getting closer to his face! Is Cas about to fucking-
“Only if you bring me back a chocolate donut,” Dean murmurs seriously. “Otherwise, no deal.”
And this is only their first Christmas together. This time next year, their pup would be with them and they’d be like a real family.
“But stairs,” he winces. “Do you know how hard it is to get around like this?”
“No- don’t!” Dean tries to turn away, but he’s trapped.
Cas sighs, and Dean feels every movement of it; the way his chest expands and then deflates, the way his heart beats in a slow, measured rhythm, the way Cas shifts him minutely closer. He wonders if Cas is trying to scent him too.
“Deanie-weenie!” she yells, holding her arms out.
“You mean pills?” he mumbles through a thick mouthful of oatmeal. It wasn’t actually that bad.
there, Dean. It’s a tangible thing. Something I want for you to want more than anything in this world. Because I want it like that. Want you. I don’t wish to scare you, that’s not what this is about. This is about us, and the way you make me feel. How I want to make you feel.
For whatever reason, Gabe hadn’t been able to drop off the food he’d promised last night, but around eleven, he comes by with about a dozen pie boxes and four bags of food piled high in the back of his BMW. He’s got plans somewhere or another, but that doesn’t stop him from pestering Cas in the kitchen, and taking a weird interest in Sam’s height, giving Dean plenty of new ammo in case Sam starts being a little shit. When he leaves, Dean and Sam reluctantly head for the living room when they’re kicked out of the kitchen, and they end up watching football. Neither of them is particularly interested in the teams playing, and Dean ends up falling asleep before half-time, but hey, that’s what you did on thanksgiving.
But by the time he’s pulling into the loading, drop-off only zone, his scent has settled to something a lot calmer.
He’d almost introduced Cas as his Alpha.
“I love you,” Cas murmurs to him softly. “You did so good, Dean.”
“I’m really glad I met you.”
, he thinks, biting his lip, now what? Cas was already pretty much spoiling him. He did not need for Cas to go out of his way more so than he already was. Especially because shit was expensive these days.
“Hey Cas?”
“That don’t mean you gotta put yourself in harms way!” Bobby growls, and Cas finally seems to notice him. Turning to look over his shoulder, he nods at Bobby before turning back to Dean.
His alarm clock blared in his ear, startling him awake. At any other time, Back in Black would usually pump him up, but not when it was the first thing he heard in the morning.
He’s never been in this kind of situation before, but he’s almost positive his immediate reaction shouldn’t have been fear and a sense of overwhelming sadness. He’d never had this kind of connection with another person, let alone actual
“It’s okay, Dean. It’s okay,” Cas says again.
The door opens a crack, and Cas’s squinting eyes and out worldly hair are just visible. Cas blinks at him owlishly for a full minute before his eyes widen, and realization dawns on his face.
“Yeah uh, hi. I need an appointment. As soon as possible.”
“I haven’t lied to you, Dean,” Cas says, continuing to stroke circles into Dean’s stomach. “I have rarely entered into a long-term relationship, and the list of people I’ve
The movement jars the pup in between them, and ever so slowly his hands move down Dean’s body until he has both of them cradling his bump.
“Alright, I’ll be quick,” he says, running his fingers through Dean’s hair once before leaving- Dean’s cheeks turn a little pink in his brother’s presence, but he can’t help smiling a little at the gesture. He’s not heading in the direction of the kitchen though, curiously enough.
“That explains half of it,” Cas’s eyes narrow. “You have to know how dangerous it is to be lifting heavy objects while you’re pregnant, Dean. We’ve discussed this before. And this is exactly why.”
“C’mon Cas,” he whispers, nipping at Cas’s ear lobe before sucking it into his mouth, smiling when Cas hisses underneath him. “I want to feel you.”
“To think I was-“ John pants before spitting a mouthful of blood at Dean’s feet, ”to think I was here to-to-“
Dean automatically murmurs a soft, “woah,” to let the guy know he’s there, cradling his stomach instinctively, he almost loses his balance with one of his feet still mid-step until Cas’s hands are steadying him- but the dude turns to glare when a warning growl comes from directly behind him. He can feel Cas’s breath on his neck, looming over him, possessive hands gripping Dean’s hips.
He could still clearly see it in his head, could remember the scent of Dean’s distress permeating the air as dead eyes stared blankly ahead of him. Dean had just found out that he was pregnant, and he’d shut down completely. When Castiel had first laid eyes on him, he’d thought for one horrifying second that Dean was dead. Ashen and unmoving, his heart had dropped down to his toes.
“How about you stop guessing what I will and won’t like then, Cas,” he says softly, “you’ll save yourself a lot of grief that way.” At Cas’s small smile, he says, “Just tell me.”
And I don’t know if it’ll happen again. You deserve better.”
To his horror, Dean could feel a blush start to rise over his cheeks and neck. “Uh, I think you’ve had enough to drink now,
He closes his eyes tightly and scents his mate’s neck. Cas doesn’t make any move to pull away, so neither does Dean.
Dean’s scent hadn’t lessened in intensity at all, so the entire time, and even after, he’s hovering so close to Dean that it’s as if they hadn’t gotten out of bed at all.
“You don’t have to drive a mini van, Dean,” Cas laughs, shaking his head at him.
If it was so fine, then why did he feel like he’d just signed his own death warrant?
He panics when Cas tries to pull away, his grip turning to claws when he feels the movement, but Cas sounds just as panicked now.
The rest of his shift passes in a blur. He does his job, but at the end of the day, he knows he couldn’t recall exactly what he says or does. Castiel is on autopilot, a setting he is unfortunately very familiar with. He has an hour and a half. Then he can do what he really wants to do. What he really
,” Cas says sharply, “You should have contacted me immediately, and you definitely should not have gotten behind the wheel. What if you had gotten into an accident?!  You and the pup could’ve - ”
, and he finally takes a deep breath and lets it go in the form of an almost moan. Relaxing back a little against Cas, he let’s the man do whatever the fuck he wants. When Cas finally works his fingers into Dean’s hair, massaging the base of his skull, Dean has to admit that Cas was fucking right. He
Hands quickly going to his belly to calm himself down, he rubs circles into the soft skin until another wave washes over him, instantly erasing any thought besides the word
“Oh god, are we the kind of mates who quote Titanic now?” Dean scoffs, disgusted. “When did that happen? I did
him until he could. What used to be something Dean never thought he wanted, was now something he couldn’t
And then, Dean is soaking wet and shirtless in front of him. Looking up at Castiel with lost eyes, almost child-like, looking to him for answers, maybe a solution for everything that had gone so horribly wrong between them. He is truly something to behold though, something he wouldn’t mind looking at for hours at a time, but Dean’s skin is an unhealthy shade of bluish grey, turning his pale, freckled skin sickly looking.
He’s glad Cas can’t see him roll his eyes. Typical Cas.
“It matters a lot though, and you know it,” Dean reasons. “The stakes-”
By the time Dean got to his feet, still cradling his stomach protectively, Castiel was sitting on his father’s chest, pinning John’s arms beneath him with his body weight, and delivering harsh blows to the man’s face over and over again.
sometimes.”
with me!”
His orgasm took him completely by surprise, and he didn’t even try to stifle his moan this time. He was way too over stimulated. With Cas swallowing him down like a pro, and the weird sensation of his ass clenching around the finger inside him, he was fucking gone. All the while Cas kept up his ministrations between his legs, and when Dean finally went lax, Cas let go of his dick and took the opportunity to slip another finger inside him.
Fucking cheater.
“Yes,” he interrupted, “Anything. Money is no issue, just
“Fuck,” he gasps, eyes snapping open in horror as he realizes his mistake.
“You guys can go back to punching each other in the face now, don’t mind me,” he grouses, playfully shrugging off Cas’s hand when he places it on Dean’s shoulder. Cas only smiles and pulls the blanket higher to cover him more before wrapping his arm around Dean’s waist again.
His stomach seizes as he remembers exactly what set him off.
“There’s nothing you can do to get a clearer image?” Cas asks, disheartened but not altogether shocked. He knew this happened sometimes.
Alpha. The thought is so wrong, yet so right for them. Cas is right for them.
Thankfully Cas reads his mind and pulls away- far enough away that their lips aren’t touching, but their foreheads still are- so he can speak quietly to Dean without them hearing.
“Not really,” Dean mutters, looking away. He should’ve known Cas would be able to see right through him. His breathing catches again, and Cas hugs him close.
Cas feels so fucking big like this, feeling impossible long as he continues his slide. When he finally bottoms out, fully seated on Cas’s lap now, he feels completely full.
Castiel groans into Dean as he hears Dean reaction and presses the tip of his tongue hard against Dean’s hole, working his way inside it. The slick that fills his mouth has Castiel’s hips working against the mattress trying to get any kind of friction to alleviate the pressure building up between his hips. Pulling away slightly, he sucks the delicate skin around Dean’s rim into his mouth hard, only plunging his tongue back in when Dean frantically clenches around nothing.
“Can I take two!?” someone squeals as they all surge forward, Cas barely having enough time to open the bag before a hand is reaching inside it.
And it was Cas who he couldn’t wait to go home to. So what if it wasn’t really his actual home? So what if Cas wasn’t technically
smell. Such a contrast to the burning clean smell from before, it smells like Christmas and pie and
Rolling his eyes, almost surprised to find that there weren’t any hearts next to his name or something gross like that, he presses his name and is relieved to hear the distinct sound of his phone vibrating from underneath his nightstand.
Cas, who had been watching the situation unfold silently, finally steps outside, bucket of candy included.
He’d been moaning for it, fucking himself on Cas’s thick fingers like a bitch in heat.
The door opens completely then and Cas pokes his head in, smile in place. It gets even bigger when he sees what Dean’s doing.
“Good,” Cas sighs. Pressing one more kiss to the back of Dean’s neck, Cas lays his head back onto the pillow they happen to be sharing, and falls silent.
“Hey! You haven’t seen my fat pants yet! You don’t know my life!”
“Watch your tone with me, boy,” he warns icily, “I find out you’re an
Cas bites Dean’s neck softly, his tongue poking out to lick at the salt of Dean’s skin. “Extremely,” he murmurs, thrusting his hips faster into the tunnel of Dean’s hand.
Cas resumes kissing his neck as one finger becomes two- scissoring for the moment instead of crooking, not really looking for that spot inside him quite yet, which is fine with him. If it’s this early, he’s guessing the plan isn’t going to entail a quickie like last night.
Dean doesn’t respond, but he doesn’t feel the need to say anything else because he can tell Dean is thinking over his words. That’s all he wants. For Dean to be aware of the fact that he would always come when Dean called. Dean and their child are unquestionably his number one priority, and the sooner that fact got through Dean’s stubborn skull, the better.
“So you weren’t prescribed a new one?” he asks incredulously, “Maybe a lower dosage or a more user friendly one?”
Taking his comment as an invitation to come in, Castiel opens the door all the way and takes a seat on the floor behind Dean, yawning as he does so. “Unfortunately, yes. It could be made worse by the choice of food you’ve been consuming.”
Rolling his eyes at Cas’s little tantrum, “Are you under the impression that family is supposed to make you feel
After about four days of these stupid pants he still wasn’t used to it. No matter how many times Cas reprimanded him for scratching, he couldn’t resist.
“I don’t know. But you’re strong, beautiful. You can get through this,” he continues to whisper over Dean’s quiet sobbing.
And then the connection cuts out and he’s left staring at his phone.
Shrugging out of his jacket and slipping off his shoes, he swings his leg over Cas’s against the inside of the couch, maneuvering himself until he’s against the cushions, on Cas’s right side.
He can pretend all he wants, but nothing is actually normal at all. Dean knows Cas wants to talk about
Cas had pulled him into a hug, coaxing Dean to scent at his neck for comfort, but that night before bed, they actually did it. Sat down with Cas’s head pillowed on his shoulder while they took turns reading aloud. It was kind of weird at first, especially when it was describing weird shit he’s never heard about, but it was also nice to think about the pup with Cas’s heat a solid wall of support right next to him.
“Nothing,” Castiel says, but secretly, he finds Dean’s jealousy endlessly amusing. He’d seen it today when Hester had led them into the room where they’d be doing the ultrasound, and just right now with Meg.
“Family doesn’t treat each other like that, Cas,” he says, keeping his eyes firmly shut, “They are supposed to love you unconditionally, support you when times get rough, and actually fucking
“Son of a bitch,” he hisses, scrambling to get a grip on Cas’s hair, hugging him closer to his chest. “Feels so good, Alpha.”
In hindsight, he knew this to be true, but that didn’t stop his resentful thoughts in any way, shape, or form.
God he missed this.
“Barbie!” he laughs, ducking down a little to hug her tightly. His surprise had quickly melted into a bubbling happiness, and neither him nor Jess pulls away from their embrace. She’s pretty small and he’s pretty huge, so she’s basically being smooshed against his bloated belly.
He tries to ignore it.
“Am I?” Cas scoffs bitterly. “If that were so, then Luke would still be alive.”
In his right hand, he’d been clutching something small and soft in his sleep. It looked like fabric maybe?
Cas had asked a few times of course, but after Dean had bitched at him enough in those first rough couple of weeks, the questions stopped and Cas hadn’t tired again. And after John had paid them a visit, the time had never seemed right, because their encounter was still too fresh. But now that everything was sorta looking up, he’s wondering why he hasn’t.
He remembers all the shit that went down last night, but vaguely, like there’d been a kind of mist or haze over the memory. The thing that stood out the most though…he remembers very fucking clearly.
He didn’t want to speak, didn’t want words at all. But this? He couldn’t resist anymore. Cas was warm and soft and smelled good. And he was solid compared to the chipped, broken thing he felt like and must resemble.
“Are you sure? I don’t mind in the slightest,” Cas wheedles.
“Big fucking deal. I could probably count the number of times I’ve heard you cuss on both hands, maybe one,” he challenges.
“You. The pup. Us. Tomorrow- almost today,” Cas breathes like he’s scared Sam and Jess might hear. “I realize that the pup will add an element of newness next year, but right now,
There is no friggin’ way you could’ve ‘been there for me more.’ You were there when I needed you, every single time I’ve needed you. And I know I might not act like the most grateful man in the world, but I really….I really appreciate it.”
“Depends.”
Cas closes his eyes and sighs, his arms around Dean tightening infinitesimally.
Rounding the corner at the top of the stairs, he watches Cas’s smile morph into a frown as he catches sight of Dean. Dropping the food he has in his hands, he takes the few steps necessary to get to Dean. Wrapping an arm around his waist, Cas pulls him close and waddles them towards the door. He kind of feels like an over-tired toddler being helped to bed, but he’s really too tired to complain.
Instead of answering though, Dean kisses him. It’s short and sweet, tasting of cinnamon and brown sugar, and Dean hopes Cas understands that he’s saying sorry.
They were rendered insignificant in the face of the one thought that kept repeating itself over and over again in his head. It took precedence above all else, making every thing around him fall away.
As much as he’d like to stay, the need to flea is stronger- a driving force that feels like it’s pulling him towards his car as if he were a magnet.
“That’s not what I meant, Dean,” Cas sighs, looking away to hide the hurt in his eyes at Dean’s words.
He’s grunting with effort now, knuckles white, as his grip on the basket starts to slip. The part where it’s braced against him has started slipping down along with the material of his long sleeve as the jarring motion of the stairs keep rocking it.
“You’ve gotten so big, little one,” Cas says softly, keeping his fingers pressed into Dean’s skin even after the icepacks are in place. “Are you comfortable?” he asks Dean, quirking an eyebrow up at Dean.
But he’s had enough words. Enough of feeling sorry for himself and sorry for Cas. And he doesn’t want to hate himself right now, not when Cas just put himself out there for him the way he just did.
Dean raises his eyebrows skeptically.
“Wait Cas. I- I need to say one thing.”
“Me neither,” Dean murmurs quietly against Cas’ skin. Considering the way he’d reacted the last couple times it seemed like Cas had even
of Cas fucking him into the mattress and the headboard tapping quietly against the wall.
Smiling to himself, his hands find his stomach again. Pushing the shirt up to reveal the skin underneath, he closes his eyes as runs his fingers over it softly.
“We’re here, Dean,” Cas almost whispers. “You can sleep again as soon we get you set up in my office. Only a little bit further.”
All that met his angry outburst was silence. No one could hear him fall apart.
“Don’t you even start, Dean Winchester, you told me you liked the way he wore his cowboy boots when he - ”
“Ohhh-okay no,” he moans- pushing Cas’s head away quickly. “You know that shit’s my weakness. Let’s move it along, buddy.”
“You could say that again,” Dean chuckles, shaking his head. “The last twenty four hours or so have been a roller coaster. I’m surprised I haven’t thrown up, actually.”
“Dean? Are you alright?” he can hear Cas’s voice right behind them.
Fighting back his own tears, he moves so that he’s right behind Dean. He knows Dean has to feel the bed move, but he doesn’t react except his breathing goes silent. Hesitating for only a moment more, he situates himself along Dean’s back, wrapping his arms around his chest and pressing his nose against Dean’s clammy neck. Holding him as tightly as he can.
