Two weeks later, Bucky and Clint were laying on the floor behind the counter, surrounded by fallen petals and stem cuttings. Luckily, there were no rose orders today. Otherwise, their situation would be infinitely more painful.
He continued to clean up, assuming the person would either leave, or wait. The water was a safety hazard, and he didn’t need a broken back along with a missing arm. That would just suck. Sopping wet towels in hand, Bucky went into the back room to drop them in the dirty clothes hamper and went back out to greet the customer. Bucky was slightly shocked to see a guy with a shock of purple hair, with a blonde undercut. The man was built well, like a gymnast, with tattoos covering all visible patches of skin. That wasn’t unusual. Heck, Bucky had almost as many tattoos as this guy, and several more piercings. No, the tattoos weren’t what was odd. The odd thing was the way the man seemed very at home, casually inspecting a carnation assortment and rearranging the display.
“At ease,” Peggy laughed.
Bucky shot up from his sitting position, over balancing and falling right back onto his butt. Clint burst out laughing, not even bothering to help Bucky up.
“Anytime, really. I just came around to check out the new guys. You and that guy down the street.” Clint picked up a bouquet of miniature succulents and Limonium. It was a new product he was trying. It was very popular with the hipster types, and most memorably, a woman who called herself a garden witch.
Clint seemed to take it seriously though, nodding and walking towards the counter. “So, any arrangements need making up?”
It was another slow day, Bucky had been having quite a few of those lately. Which was worrying, but he would pull through. He had faith in his shop and community. But, since there were no customers, they had some down time.
“’Course man!” Clint exclaimed, bouncing lightly on the balls of his feet.
The big blonde moved into the kitchen, heating up the chicken noodle soup he had made last week. He poured it into a bowl, grabbed a spoon and a Pepsi, and brought it out to Bucky. Steve watched as Bucky absently ate the food, and drank his soda. Even though he seemed out of it, at least he was eating. All Steve could do now was be there. He swaddled Bucky in blankets, pulling his best friend to his chest, and laid them down on the couch. Not long after, Bucky was snoring lightly, turning over to bury his face in Steve’s sternum. Steve smiled softly, allowing his eyes to slip closed so he could drift into sleep.
“I’ve missed you Bucky. It’s not the same without you.”
He couldn’t enjoy the ride as much, at the moment, because he was too worried about Bucky. The bad days were a constant, when he first came back without an arm. Steve had thought they were getting better though. And lately, Bucky had seemed happier, with their new shared employee. Something was wrong though, and Bucky wasn’t telling him. That was okay. He didn’t need to know why in order to be there for him.
“I’m looking for the knucklehead who owns this place,” said a brash, British voice.
At the apartment, Steve dismounted and helped Bucky down. He stowed the helmets in his little hatch, and led Bucky up the rickety old stairs to their floor. Wiggling the knob and banging just above the latch got the door unlocked and open. Then he led Bucky into the living room, depositing him on the couch and turning on M.A.S.H. That show was Bucky’s guilty pleasure, and Steve was willing to indulge him.
“Oh that’s fine. The blonde muscle mass down the road hired me. I’m the gymnastics coach now. Working with children.” He paused like this was the first time he was processing this. “Huh.”
Bucky grunted in acknowledgment, going to cross his arms and remembering that yeah, that wasn’t a thing he could do anymore. He ignored the phantom pain in his arm and the very real pain in his heart. No one knew how much they took being whole for granted, until they weren’t anymore.
While Bucky was thinking, not wallowing, Steve came into the office. He observed Bucky, unnoticed for a moment. He knew his best friend hadn’t been doing well lately, but something must have set him off, because this was bad. It was days like this that Steve wanted to wrap him up and shower him in kisses. He didn’t have the privilege to do both, but he sure as hell could do one. Which is why he cleared his throat, moving to grab his things and get out. He had already locked up, the cleaning could wait for tomorrow. Right now, Bucky needed him.
Bucky eyed him a minute. “You plan on buying that?”
When he walked into the gym though, Steve spotted him and immediately started shaking his head. “Nope. You are going to wait in my office, and then we are going home. None of this bull today, Barnes. You look like shit.”
Apparently sensing his presence, the man started speaking. “These colors clash, the way you have them set up. I took the liberty of rearranging. Much more aesthetically pleasing.”
“Peg! What are you doing in town?” Bucky scrambled up into a standing position, posture rigid out of habit.
After Clint left, Bucky stayed just long enough to clean and lock up. After that, he was out the door and headed directly to the gym. One thing that could always get his mind off of things was physical activity.
“James Barnes. Welcome to my shop.”
If Clint noticed the haunted look in Bucky’s eyes, he didn’t say anything. If he knew that they really couldn’t afford to close early, he kept that to himself too.
“That was our last order, and I’m beat. We’re closing early today.”
Sighing, Bucky walked around the counter to retrieve the broom. He swept up what he could, wincing at the way the water made all the little glass pieces stick to the broom. He’d have to beat it on the wall out back until the shards fell out. Fun. He was just bending down to clean up the water when the shop bell rang. Fuck, he couldn’t help them right at this moment, and it wasn’t like he had the money to pay any extra help.
Bucky felt his mouth lift at the corner, trying to pull into a smile. “Well, I’ve got about six orders to make up for the day. If you want to stick around and help.”
Bucky gaped unattractively for a moment, stunned. Bucky had just invited him to help, but it was more of a joke.
Over the time Clint had been working with Bucky, they had bonded. Clint was loud, obnoxious, and a little unreliable, but that was to expected from a guy who worked three jobs, one of which he wasn’t even paying paid to do. Bucky actually felt bad for not being able to pay him, so he provided Clint meals while he was there.
His face must have done something funny as he was thinking, because Peggy gave him a knowing smile. He really, really hated that smile. It meant she knew something he didn’t. Before he could ask about it, though, she patted his cheek and kissed his nose.
Bucky slumped, leaning over on the counter. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Agent Carter.”
The man turned to shoot Bucky a brilliant smile and Bucky found himself wanting to trust this guy. Which was an immediate red flag, putting up Bucky’s proverbial hackles. “Yeah. Thanks,” he said gruffly.
When he came back, Peggy was blushing.
Two years after being medically discharged from the Marine Corps, and he was finally getting his life together. He and Steve had moved back to Brooklyn, opening their respective businesses with the money they had managed to save while they were enlisted. Bucky’s savings, truth be told, had been greatly diminished due to hospital bills and physical therapy. The government only payed for so much, and being armless was slightly more than an inconvenience. Either way, he was doing his best, and Steve was a giant help.
Stiffening, Bucky reeled his thoughts back in. No one ever mentioned the arm, or lack thereof, so blatantly. Most people asked awkward, stilted questions, or tried to ignore that it was gone altogether. The easy with which this man spoke of it boosted Bucky’s opinion of him, and he held out a hand.
He had never felt more wanted or perfect in this moment with Roberts’ hands holding him tightly like he was afraid of Tony escaping.
She took two steps towards the bed before Tony dashed and jumped on it. Once the blankets settled back down Tony stared down at his bedsheet like it was the most interesting thing in the world.
That didn’t stop his brain from moving. Tony had notebooks upon notebooks filled with ideas. Sometimes he would be able to get parts from Jarvis to try and make some of those ideas real. But Tony always wanted, needed, to do bigger and better. He refused to go to Howard with anything less. It was never enough in Tony’s eyes. They always ended up in the trash.
With the lower class, soulmates usually meant mating in general. Sometimes you would have mates be two alphas or omegas. Those tropes would resign themselves to close friendships. At least on paper.
(See the end of the chapter for
He would sneak books out of the library that talked about the soulmates. Marks, traditions, mates themselves.
Natalie gave a small curtsy, “Of course Mr. Stark. I’ll return around lunch time.”
He let himself be guided out of his mother’s room and toward the staircase. The murmuring of the guests pounded louder and louder in his ears. How could anyone hear themselves think? Maybe that was the point. Once they were in view of the main level the noise died down as everyone stared at the guest of honor.
“What are you doing?”
Once again locking arms with him Natalie guided (pulled) him alongside her. Jarvis settled back in the car and pulled out his book. Resigned to his fate Tony shook off Natalie’s arm and walked with her. She led him to a small ice cream wagon to get each of them a cone. Okay, so far the walk wasn’t the worst he’s been on.
“I’m sorry, my what?”
He wondered if anyone noticed his now pale skin showed tints of green and quickly looked back at the floor which had the audacity to look better than he did. Guests had begun to arrive a half hour prior while he was getting the finishing touches done on himself. This way he and his escort, aka Maria, could make a grand entrance and garner all the attention.
“The thefts.” Tony nodded.
Two months later his pattern of life was disrupted by his mother summoning him to her sitting room. When he entered the room he was startled to find a pair of dazzling green eyes staring right at him. Tony felt faint. Faint of all things, as he was quickly returned to the night he tried his best to ignore. Blinking once, Tony stared right back into the green eyes to notice the differences.
Tony squeezed his eyes closed and turned his head to prepare for what was coming to him. Instead a loud thud had him opening them up again seeing Scarface bent over holding his head and a black duffel bag beside him. More footsteps caught Tony’s attention as another alpha stepped into view.
Of course, something was nagging at him. He stood up and whispered something to his mother about not feeling well and excused himself. She nodded sympathetically and as he left he heard Howard mutter something about omega’s weak dispositions.
Tony liked Obie. He was always nice to him whenever they were in each other’s company. He would even soften Howard’s words when he was around. That grin though...it didn’t seem as comforting as it used to when Tony was younger. Finding no comfort from that direction he forced himself to try and pay attention to what his mother’s friend Muffy was saying.
A pause.
The boy is nowhere in sight.
“So you want me to get into Nova’s records or what? I can’t do that from here. And it’s not like I can go all the way there and
Bruce mumbles a little. “More like Thanos beat him up.”
Every single breath Tony takes in that’s too deep damn nearly sends him into panic, every beat of his heart is painful and a reminder that soon enough, if he doesn’t do anything –

Natasha’s eyes widen a little, surprised, and she takes a glance to the TV so she can see for herself what Steve is talking about. When she does – when she
this feeling – the feeling of being on the cusp of realizing something, but have it just out of his reach, his mind to stretching far enough to make an essential connection no matter how hard he tries. His brows scrunch together harder and harder the more he thinks about it, but the cloud of haziness doesn’t quit, just muddying his brain the harder he tries to scrub it down; Eyes burning so sharply with the dry feeling that accompanies the bone-deep tired feeling that he, irrationally, almost feels like he’s going to cry.

But when Tony realizes they’re in

to step away, to stop himself from reacting in a way he won’t be able to take back or justify later, when, to his utter astonishment,
He doesn’t listen. He keeps pushing, distressed, even as the wall pushes him back. Even when he can’t breathe, even when he starts to sag and his sweat turns torturously cold. Even when his entire body goes numb and heavy, and he feels himself go empty, even as his mind still burst with static and jolts with unexplained adrenaline and anxiety, a muted cry of despair that goes farther and farther away with every beat; Until he feels like he’s once again trapped inside a bubble, encased inside an armor of foam, everything dull except for the sharp edges of the fear inside his head.
“But you’re not sure?”
Nebula stares at him, divided, her face distorted in a hesitant frown, and Tony can’t wait for her answer and so he leans forward, ignoring how hard it is to do so with his abdomen immobilized, gripping the rails on the side of the bed with such force that his fingers turn white.
“Fast enough. He doesn’t need another update, Howard, he’s fine the way he is.”
Rocket screams into the night like his heart is being ripped out of his chest, and the feeling echoes in Steve’s chest, in all of them, and they can’t do anything but watch as Rocket breaks down, completely, and the blue woman can’t react in any other way than placing a hand on his shoulder, gripping tight, probably past the point of pain, as her own face twists into a grimace in a feeble attempt to hold back her own tears.
“I’m not worried.” Steve says, but it’s not true. It feels like a lie in his tongue, heavy and bitter, and he knows that if T’Challa can see through him, it is only because he is too close to the situation and knows better than to undermine the consequences of all his actions from now on. Anyone else would’ve never caught his lie. He’s gotten too good at it through the years, too good at pushing through barriers of pleasantry and bureaucracy to find himself an opening to act.
. Because it did. It did, every single second he observed their pictures and reminded himself they weren’t coming back.
Thor, in all seriousness, replies:
They set the route to the general direction of the Earth, somewhere around the place Squidward's ship had taken impulse and flown away, because that’s as far as the signal of the armor can lead them to – And he thinks about how fucked up that is, that he is so far away that he has left his planet far enough that he doesn’t know how to get back to it. It’s terrifying, how far away from home he is, lost amidst stars that are too quiet, the endless, terrifying darkness, the very same Tony sometimes still dreams about when he tries to sleep.
“Yeah, you did.” She concedes, but there’s no bitterness to it. “But I got my drink in the end, so it’s okay.”
how hard it is for us when we fight about this, but – I really feel like I should say it, okay? I don’t want you to – to assume the worst and then we get angry at each other and we can’t talk. I can’t do that. So I need you to listen, please.”
“This was all she had left.” He says, not able to look Ms. Carter in the eyes as he does so, feeling ashamed for the way he sounds as he confides this tiny piece of the woman he, to this day, considered a part of his family, to someone who never had the chance to meet her, or her son.
They all stare at the board.
And in the other, when he blinks, tiny sparks of white burst behind his eyelids, and the entire world just tilts right in front of his eyes and he gasps when he feels his body swaying and leaning too much to the left, and he almost loses balance on the chair and falls down to the floor.

So Pepper Potts gets the chance to be the first on the hot seat this time around. Let's set up the stage with the most important issue: What is the thing that constantly strains their relationship? Is it Iron Man, or something else? Let's talk about it. To do that, the first thing we need is some comparative perspective: who is Pepper and who are the Avengers in Tony's life, at this point in time? What do they represent? What does it mean, if Tony chooses to act in favor of one over the other; to himself, to the side he picks, and to the side he doesn't?

Tony flinches hard when the gravelly voice comes accompanied of a touch to his elbow, unexpected, even if soft and gentle, and though the movement is not enough to pull his arm away completely from the brush of fingers around his arm, it pulls away from the pressure, in a gesture that screams of rejection and fear, even if unconscious, and unintentional.
Now, as we're in that part where everyone is just wondering where do we go from here in this fandom, I just want to remind you that the path of this story remains unchanged. Nothing that happened in Endgame affects this fic. Here, we work with IW and no further, and the only information I'll ever use or mention about Endgame will be solely to flesh out the rules of my own plot, to know the limits I can push, or make some nice comparisons for you guys. Nothing that will change the ultimate fate of this narrative. The universe that exists in here works in different rules, different priorities, and also, different results.
“There might be—” Tony chokes, body flinching in sharp pain when he mindlessly tries to twist himself so he can look at his companion, the wound in his abdomen stretching painfully and probably starting to bleed again in his hasty movement. “On Earth. I need to— I need to go back. I need to know who’s left. I need to know.”
We’ll never know. If the Stone can be used on a single object instead of the entire universe then maybe you could reverse Time in a small scale without it all falling apart. But if you can’t, and as soon as you activate it the whole universe just starts spinning backwards – there’s a big chance we wouldn’t
The fucking television turns on in a random channel, a reality show Steve could not give two shits about and while Sam tries to put it on the news channel, Steve turns back his attention to the phone, his mind going haywire with all the horrid possibilities. “Bruce, where is Tony?” He demands, “Did he give you this phone?
“Every place had its own motivation for it, sure, but the PR sure was having a field day going through all the threats and less than polite letters we’d been getting for the past five years.” Tony huffs, sarcastically. “Are you worried about hidden agendas too, like Cap?”
He is very obviously waiting for Steve’s reaction to it, which Steve can understand, considering that the last time T’Challa heard him talk about anything involving the Accords, Steve had been out of his mind, fuming with rage and betrayal, about to start a war with one of his teammates and closest friends.
“When did Thanos get the Reality Stone?” Tony asks, an idea sparking in his head.

and then
(But he has to.)
“Okay.” Tony says, breathlessly. “We do this together.”
“Apparently.” Tony makes a gesture that’s not exactly a shrug, but it’s close. It’s too twitchy to be quite what it should be. “It’s where he lived. His people.”
(You just care about being right.)
They go back empty-handed.
He hears him getting closer, but he doesn’t turn around to greet him in any way. He doesn’t ask what the hell Sam is doing here. He knows. Natasha sent him. Hell, she’s probably around somewhere, listening in, because she doesn’t have the courage to come back and press him more about it. As always, Steve thinks with a dark, twisted irony clouding his thoughts, she might call herself heartless, but they all know how much she cared for Tony. In her weird, often shifty kind of way but she did. Leaving him to find Steve has done nothing to change that.

She supposes Jarvis would’ve been teaching basic college-level material to Anthony already, if not for the incident. Anthony would have been eleven by now, but his mind would’ve been many years ahead, for sure, his quick thinking and logic putting him above his peers easily.
Because Tony absolutely will not be the person that brings that up to him, he averts his gaze and desperately searches for something else to focus on, feeling way too awkward and guilty to just keep staring at Thor’s mismatched eyes, so full with sadness already.
(And neither is Wanda, Cap.)
“And you say you’re not evil.” Barton murmurs, and it hits Tony like a punch like nothing else had, genuinely
“How did he get it?” Rogers asks.

“The Mark L armor seems to have considerable resistance to the direct attack of the Infinity Stones, according to the footage, which includes it in the category of viable options, even if it’s base components are not artificially produced.”
, still, he thinks, and it seems wrong to let Rhodey convince the others Wanda may have been the cause of Ultron’s murderous tendencies. Tony hadn’t known where those tendencies had come either, but – had he never insisted in the program, Ultron could have been avoided completely. So it still is largely his fault. And this is all just theory, right? Maybe the Stones are just evil. Maybe Sokovia was a coincidence. Hell, maybe something in Ultron did remember about Wanda and Pietro, but who’s to say that just wasn’t him simply reaching out to known potential allies?
“Can you?”

Speaking of Ultron.
“A strong opinion, considering you haven’t read any version of the document ever since you left the United States.” The king says, and his amusement sounds like judgment in Steve’s ears.
“Do they have energy where they’re at? Food, water?” Bruce interrupts, stepping forward anxiously to make himself more noticeable.
No, thank you, they say. Please, they say. No.
As soon as the doors open, Tony maneuvers himself out clumsily and passes by Nebula, who stays inside proffering all sorts of insults and threats at him, but Tony doesn’t care.
The only thing that would stop

Pepper’s eyes linger on his for one more second, one long, drawn-out moment, a stretch of time they’re both stealing in a way, like young lovers who can’t win against the world that tries to keep them apart, but then Pepper breaks the connection, and turns away in a slow, careful movement, before heading towards the agents to discuss the addition of their communication devices to FRIDAY’s systems.
Sometimes, after battle, they struggle. Like matches, when provoked with sparks of violence they burn, and they fall back into the old ways. It doesn’t last long, though – actually, every time it happens, it lasts less and less.

Something in that sentence strikes Steve as odd. He can’t quite precisely say what it is – he only knows it makes him feel on
But apparently, Wanda knows him way too well to be fooled by his strategy.
Tony wants to question this, question himself; He can feel the inkling of insecurity swimming around the edges of his rational thoughts, shoved temporarily aside by the focus and the panic required to keep up with the situation at hand, but it’s not nearly strong enough for him to grasp properly and worry about it. It’s just… something in there, hidden deep. He feels like there’s something happening here, between him and Cap, and he can’t quite put his finger into it – it’s not familiarity, that’s not it, but it’s not… It’s not detachment.  Tony thought he would feel detached. And to be fair, for a second there, right when Cap

Tony had never been in any life-risking situation until then. Not really. He'd have Happy follow him everywhere, often accompanied by another four or five bodyguards, even though he didn’t need to, because no one cared enough about a spoiled, selfish brat of a billionaire to try anything like a hit on his life – it had just been a habit. His bodyguards helped keep stalkers or anyone too handsy away. To help him maintain an appearance, to make himself untouchable, and nothing more.
moving forward without looking back – you don’t live this kind of life without consequences. Without getting tangled in messy feelings. And Steve’s feelings are as messy and as confusing as they can possibly get.

Steve doesn’t get angry, of course not. It’s obviously an accident, and if he’s very honest, he could have been paying a little more attention and easily avoided the blow, and the only reason why he didn’t is because he had stopped walking to stare at the gigantic building Tony had been gesturing at, which was, coincidentally,

The visual is enough to stir up memories of chaos old and new, of screams and terror and flashes of war Tony has been familiar with since Howard’s old film reels from WWII. Along the way, spots of flashing lights denunciate the trail of destruction the crowd has left behind, setting abandoned cars aflame, heaps of distorted metal burning in furious blaze as a warning sign to anyone who dares to come close. Even inside the cabin of the Jet, Tony swears he can feel the smell of charred rubber, the gleam of broken glass shards on the floor of the avenues, and all he can remember is the

More often than not, after long hours of going around in circles, he’ll sigh and run his hand through his hair, resisting the urge to tug at the longer strands just to feel some pain, even if it’s the slightest amount, telling himself that relying in pain as a grounding mechanism is not acceptable.
“I can’t promise anything, sour-patch.” Tony jokes, but his words are laced in apology and remorse.
He can’t waste his life.
“You’ve never seen the Accords, Scott.” Steve harshly says as an argument, a little desperate— and then his breath gets caught on his throat, painfully, as the meaning of his own words catch up to him.
Is he – Is he for real?
“All of you?” Thor enunciates slowly. “Or just
uncomfortable with the idea of not seeing this coming. He feels like it says something about his personality that is not all that flattering, but he’s not sure what that would be. He just— he’s not sure how to feel about this. It’s more than shock. He doesn’t know how to describe it, but it’s not pleasant, and it weights heavily on his stomach.
, because it can’t be anything else. How – How can this happen?  This can’t be happening.
, because Tony is selfish and he never denied it, and he can’t deny the only thing keeping him going now is the memory of Peter Parker dying in his arms, because it
Nebula throws him a look like she wants to strangle him, nevermind they have just gone three different plans just so they can avoid Tony dying too soon. “Why is your armor so lethal to your body? It’s supposed to be a part of you.”
He waits and he waits. That’s all he can do.
(But the pieces don’t fit, do they?)
In all honesty, he misses Anthony Stark terribly. He
, itches in Tony’s brain for some reason he can’t place, the nagging feeling of having something he needs to grasp that is just out of his reach.
This is wrong. This is all wrong.
(That is not true.)
(Assuming I will let you.)
And almost immediately, what answers from the other side of the line is—
“Thank you, Tony.”
“Would that take out that many people? In such a short span of time?” Nebula asks.
Tony gives him a dark blue suit, smiling from ear to ear as he says:
Except for—
Tony can see the yellow at the periphery of his vision, suddenly and not at all, the rough feeling of sand scratching between his fingers and under his nails, and he
Looking back and wishing he had done something else. Anything else.
There’s a click, and a rustle, and suddenly, a voice – male, hoarse, definitely not one of theirs – screams into the comms:
(Righteous.)
This arc is an odd one. It includes a lot of characters, two of which you already know about, Thor and Scott, but also more - and so many layers of issues that are related, and at the same time, not at all; and, much like family, it's complicated.
He walked two blocks away when he could no longer risk the small amount of hysterical laughter that bubbled up. He had done it. He had successfully snuck out. He knew that if he were caught that Howard would make him pay. Bad enough his only son had turned out to be an omega, the least Tony could do was not cause further embarrassment to the Stark name. Being out at dark and heading to a bar of all places would cause his mom to swoon.
“Keep wondering.” he told her curtly.
They pulled up to the building and Natalie guided him inside. Literally linked arms with him so he couldn’t do something Tony-like. For example jumping back in the car and locking the doors or bolting down the street. He wasn’t so much looking forward to being a human pin cushion for who knows how long.
Tony was flabbergasted at Hammer’s implications. He quickly scanned the crowd to make sure no one was looking in their direction. Especially Howard. He would not make a scene. He would not make a scene. He would
He slowly made his way down the hall and stopped and tried to listen for anything. After 30 seconds of nothing he peeked in to see Howard slumped over with his head on his desk. Tony did his best not to rush past the open door and when he made it to the dark hallway on the other side he almost couldn’t handle the relief. The biggest step taken, he quickly and quietly made his way down to the kitchen to use the side door.
Natalie waltzed in brandishing a letter.
I’m never writing it again.’
The feeling of being stared at never went away, but glancing around he could at least appreciate that most of the people were being subtle about it. At one point he felt like his head would be on fire if laser eyes were a thing and looked around to see his father glaring at him from afar standing next to his partner, Obidiah Stane. Obie was a stark contrast of Howard. Grinning, actually seeming to have a good time, when Obie looked Tony’s way his grin widened.
She paused and turned to give him her full attention.
Luckily for him Rhodey knew what to expect from a household run by Tony.
Tony glanced up from staring at the ground to see Rhodey’s dazzling smile.
She took a lick of her chocolate ice cream cone.
Tony didn’t really feel a connection. To him it felt like a slight pull only to slam into a brick wall. A block.
“So. Think I’ll take a nap. Been a long day of...meeting new people.” Tony winced hearing how weak  his voice and excuse was. His eyes darted in her direction and saw her standing there with her hands on her hips, head slightly cocked and while her expression was as bland as could be her eyes were filled with laughter.
Out of his peripheral he saw Howard stand up and walk towards him. It was slow and deliberate as Howard exuded power. Tony’s stomach started to twist as he began going over the actions and words spoken. He was always messing up something, always doing something upsetting. The infuriating part was he had no idea what he had done wrong this time.
“It’s been way too long. I gotta say, I’ve rather missed our old playdates. It almost seemed like you had fallen off the face of the map.” Justin took a drink of his punch glass; “Course now you’re all grown up. Wonder if we could get a playdate or two in between these shindigs.”
“The Hammer’s home was burgled last night. This is the fifth house in a span of six months and the damned useless police have gotten nowhere. Jarvis, remind me to upgrade our security.”
anything.
Oh goodie. Even his so-called servants were bossing him around. At least he didn’t have any foolish pretense of free will.
That was the last day that they tried to take Howard out for lunch.
PS: That better have made you smile because
With a new guard dog that apparently took orders from someone else, no Rhodey to visit with, life was repetitive.
The rest of the night, Rhodey finding him and helping him home, was a blur. He’s sure (and grateful) that Rhodes mistook his shakiness because of being attacked. Rhodes passed Tony the black duffel bag Tony insisted on keeping to him just before he snuck back through the kitchen to his room. Howard’s light was now off and darkness filled the whole house.
Jarvis looked at her and then Tony before closing the door and nodding his head.
Masked man, duffel full of most likely stolen goods. Tony would have laughed if he weren’t so numb.
Maybe he would start by throwing away some of the burgled items and just keep the bag. He would just have to be more cautious because those. He should have done that in the first place. Now he would have to work around his hired shadow. Thanks mom.
“What time is it?”
“There’s been some illegal activity lately.”
In his room he stood before his mirror. With a fortifying breath he took off his shirt to see his soul words glaring at him, bright and shiny like fresh scar tissue. He quickly threw his shirt back on to hide them again and curled up in bed.
Everything after the day of being a living pincushion was a whirlwind. With a party to plan Maria was busy and apparently needed the help of both Ana and Natalie. She tried to get Tony interested in it but realized that it was futile. There had been a few times where she would sigh when it became obvious that Tony wasn’t paying attention to the details she laid before him. He knew that she worried about him. It was her job to make sure that her omega child knew what it took to run a household.
“I do think we should start heading back. Your mother should be finished going over details now and we wouldn’t want to keep her waiting.”
There were some nights where the pain would get to be too much and he would curl into a ball and try to will the tears away. Those nights he craved Ana’s touch, even getting so desperate as wanting his mother to help soothe the ache.
He locked his bedroom door and drug out the even heavier duffel from his hiding spot. He stalled for time begging to not find what he thought he was going to find. He unzipped and lifted the lid of the bag and felt nauseous all over again at seeing it filled with valuables.
For the upper class, those with titles or money it was used as another connection. Why waste marriage and a soulmate on one connection; when you could cast a wider net by marrying someone for their connections and keeping the ones that you couldn’t (or could you?) end?
soft pastels; and for a brief moment he got a glimpse of the woman she used to be. A crown beauty still in her own right. People were probably looking at her instead of Tony. Or, you know, looking at her and wondering how she ended up with a son like Tony.
Maria and he made it to the bottom and even with all the eyes; it wasn’t as bad as he expected. He didn’t trip and fall over his feet for one. And his mother looked quite lovely in
But let’s not forget that the universe hates Tony Stark.
Of course, he would have to leave them eventually. The presence of Natalie reminded him of that every morning she came and woke him up. She would pick out his clothes, leave them on the chair to allow him to dress in peace. She seemed as good at following orders as he was. Or maybe she just didn’t follow his orders. He told her every day the first week she was there that she didn’t have to wake him or pretty much dress him. He wasn’t invalid. She would just quirk her head, make a humming noise and then outright ignore him.
“Anthony dear, right on time. I’m very impressed.” The last part of that statement was said to Natalie. Tony had looked at the clock before they left the house and it had been 10 o’clock.
Tony would like the record to show that he’s not as stupid as most people treat him to be, so his next actions shouldn’t be used against him. He panicked.
There. There was the tell tale smirk on Natalie’s face before she schooled it back into place.
*At the very end of the chapter Howard beats Tony. When Tony tells Natalie to "Just Go" is right before the violence happens and it's at the very end of the chapter.
Rhodey chuckled, “Yeah, back from whence you came. We’ll make Danvers scoot over. But you’re only getting snuck one drink. As daring as you are, you’re still underage. And don’t try to give me those puppy dog eyes. I’ll have you know that thanks to basic training I’m immune to them.”
And just like he had known since he was 9 years old and his words became etched in his skin; his soulmate didn’t want him.
Tony looked at the clock. It was only 9 pm. Howard would probably only be half way through a bottle. He had already paced his room probably 12 times. His heart wouldn’t calm down despite trying all the breathing techniques that Ana had taught him.
“Very good Miss Rushman. I’ll be here until Mrs. Stark is finished with her business.”
Tony hoped that the military wouldn’t cause Rhodey to forget his promise. A promise to elope with Tony to save him from any fate that Howard would plan.
He was no better an omega than he was a son. Anything Maria tried to teach him bored him to death. Okay, that’s a little bit dramatic; but how would you feel at 12 and instead of trying to build a robot you suddenly had to learn proper tea etiquette?
‘Dear Tones,
But it was fine. Let her straighten up and then go do...whatever Maria was going to have her do. Maybe help Ana or something, he had no idea what Maria thought they would do to pass the time. Eat cucumber sandwiches and titter about nonsense?
Then he would be reminded of the ticking time bomb that was his 21st birthday. Then he would be an eligible omega of one of the richest families around. They might seem nouveau riche to some, but that didn’t stop people from wanting their fortune. And of course, he had no real say in who he married. It would be up to Howard first and foremost.
He found that despite her obnoxious charm that both Ana and Jarvis fell for, he still had a fun time. There were jokes and light laughter. With the older Starks away for the night, Tony got to glimpse the affection that they both held for each other. He’s sure if he saw that with any other couple it would just remind him of what he’s missing out on, but with them he’s just happy that two people that he loved dearly had it at least.
He wasn’t sure how long he laid there in the darkness just focusing on his breathing. He must have passed out at some point because he woke with a jolt at his door being slammed open and Howard stormed in.
Eventually Howard’s shoes came into direct view. Then before Tony could react Howard’s hand grabbed his chin. Digging his fingers into the skin he forced Tony to look up at him.
“I’ll be there at 11.”
The morning didn’t get much better after that. Natalie was waiting for him by the car making small talk with Jarvis. She was making him smile. One of those real smiles where he was charmed and amused with someone.
For once in his short life, Tony listened. Maybe it was how serious Rhodes sounded yelling at him. He turned and started to run. As best as he could, anyway. As sobered as his mind had become with the threat in front of him his body hadn’t quite gotten the message. His adrenaline made him move faster into trash cans and walls as he tried to remember the route they had taken to get to the mansion faster. He heard crashing and banging behind him and his terror spiked urging him on.
Taking a deep breath Tony turned around slowly to face Justin Hammer.
His body started to walk back on autopilot following her.
Roberts walked over slowly like approaching a scared animal. Probably not that far off at this point. He reached out his hand which Tony glanced at before staring into Roberts’ green eyes. Slowly Tony tried to shake himself back together.
“I mean it Tony. You’re only good for one thing now. If you mess it up or embarrass me tomorrow it will not end up well for you. I refuse to let an omega make a mockery of me without consequences. This is the only warning you’ll get.” He then pushed his son backwards to signal his dismissal.
Tony started to purposefully make a mess with anything he touched to try and get a rise out of her. He tried to avoid and complain her away. Now it was time to go on the offensive. Even that didn’t work. She would see a new stain or mess (Tony ground a bag of chips into his carpet, not his proudest moment) and would clean without any form of expression. He clearly needed to up the ante. This was for science after all. How to crack Rushman’s veneer so everyone else could see what he could.
Even though he moved as slowly as possible with each task given to him Tony ended up sitting in a chair getting his hair and makeup done by Natalie sooner than he wished. He kept fidgeting, she would lightly scold, he would sit still for a minute before shifting and fidgeting again. All the while she caked his face with makeup and his hair with goop. His mind was so preoccupied he failed to notice that the whole time he sat in front of the vanity she had angled him so his reflection wasn’t glaring back at him.
Howard didn’t acknowledge the day at all. He ate breakfast quickly before ducking out to the office. On the plus side, this meant that Tony didn’t have to deal with his father and wasn’t that a win on it’s own? Ana even made him her special banana cream pancakes with cinnamon topping. It was when his plate was 3/4s of the way cleared that it hit him that he had more of an appetite than he had for months. Guess upcoming feelings of doom and dad-defying plans of running off with your best friend could push unrequited love out of the mind.
“Um, Dread Pirate Roberts, would you mind mmph” was all Tony got out before the alpha lurched forward and kissed Tony.
He could feel his facial muscles get whiplash from going from extremely bothered to ecstatic as fast as he did.
When Natalie entered the room the next morning she found him slumped over a notebook opened on his bed. She peered at the contents of it before walking over and opening the drapes to wake him up.
Tony felt his face blanch. He didn’t want any of this.
Tony is pretty sure there was gravity defying involved as he leapt to grab the envelope from her. He tore it open and was about to pull the letter out when he stopped. He looked up to see that infuriating smile on her face.
He slipped through alleyways towards The Bronze. He couldn’t help but feel excited as he got close and pulled his cap closer over his eyes. This was it. He opened the door and walked in. The noise hit him harder than even the smells. Slightly panicked he looked around the room to find a table in the corner with 4 alphas making their own raucous.
This chapter was not nice. It was not nice to me writing it. It was stubborn and difficult and I got tired of looking at it for so long to be honest. But it feels good to post my second chapter to my very first fic in...almost a decade. Thanks for everyone that read the first chapter and left kudos/comments. It really made me happy seeing them.
“You’re getting sassy now, Rogers?”
Tony goes eerily quiet for a dark, tense moment. “Yeah.”

It might be fake.
But he believes there must be a clue somewhere. He uses the old access code Mr. Stark gave him years ago to access as many files as he possibly can inside Stark Industries archives, and he’s honestly surprised when he comes out empty handed.  Howard Stark might’ve been a suspicious man, almost to a fault, but he also had been an engineer. A scientist. And scientists always leave behind annotations.
“He won’t come back for me.” She rebukes, bitterly. “He knows what awaits him if he does.”
inside Tony’s head sparks with a flare of realization, something so quick that its gone before he can properly grasp it, and it only leaves him open mouthed and awkward by the entrance, body stiff as a board, like an old man who has just glimpsed a ghost of his long gone past.
But he says he likes it, so hey, Tony is not gonna worry about it.
No, no,
“Scott hid it.” Sam interrupts, and they all stop to look at him, surprised. “When we were at the airport, we all still had our suits and weapons, and we had no time to hide them. Scott had. He took off the suit and hid it somewhere, and when the Germans came to arrest us he was the only one without a suit.”
He keeps himself busy by taking walks with Bucky in the garden, going over plans with Sam, watching Shuri work in her lab. Mostly, he goes through the motions absentmindedly, his mind always a little too far away from the present, his heart beating tender and sore, still bruised from the fight. He wishes it could heal like his body does, like his fingers did, so he could think about it calmly— and not… not having his judgment skewed by his sorrow.
He sounds distressed.
He doubts it.

Tony has never fought alongside Carter or Ross, and even if he doesn’t doubt that they are skillful in what they do – whatever it is that they do – it’s… difficult to think that not only he will have to work again with the team that has long ago lost all the trust it had in its own, but also with these two people he has never exchanged more than a couple of words with.

As the last person crosses the threshold of the portal – Natasha, of course, taking a glance back to look at Barton until the very last moment, the gleam in her eyes indescribable – it closes behind her with a swift movement, and they are all left staring to the panel on the far back wall, still being displayed there since this morning—

“You shouldn’t doubt yourself.” Thor says, with a gesture of his head – like a king praising his best warrior, commending him, and the comparison is so unbidden but so… weirdly accurate that it actually sparks a little twinge of humor in Tony’s tired heart. “You are trying to honor your mission, as much as it pains you, as am I. You shouldn’t doubt that. You have found a replacement for Uru, and that’s no small feat for anyone who is not one of the Dwarves from Nidavellir. Stormbreaker has been the only thing capable of wounding Thanos, so if we can create weapons and shields out of the same material, and fill them with the power of the Sorcerers of the Time Stone, our chances are better than it may seem.”

Well, for a while at least. I mean, Civil War still happened. The boys are going to have to talk about it eventually.
“You won’t know until we try.”
For a selfish moment, just for a while, Steve allows himself to think only about that for now.
The problem with many of the MCU's unfinished business comes from this very negligence. It's easy to forget what consequences might've happened to all SHIELD agents who were suddenly exposed in CA:TWS, when all we can remember is a cool, self-assured speech that simply states that 'the world is safer now'. Hard to see the consequences of any sort of dangerous document that might pose a threat or not, when that document is forgotten in the next installment. Hard to gauge what is important, and what is not.
“You feeling neglected, Legolas? You want a car on your birthday too?”
That, above all, is what makes his heart squeeze the hardest.
It sounds harsh.

So we can’t get this wrong a second time. Because if I hadn’t gone alone, Thanos wouldn’t have caught me. And he wouldn’t have been able to use me to make Gamora talk.”
“Cap!”
“I’m fine. No need to fuss, she’s done more than enough of that already.” Tony informs her in a placating tone, pointing at Nebula with a gesture of his head as casually as he can, reminding Pepper they are not alone.
It’s empty conversation, sort of – and at the same time, it’s not. They’ve done this a few times before too – when the night was rough, and the morning gentle, but not soothing enough. It just feels comforting. The lack of expectations of the very idea of getting up and facing the day, the lack of expectations between them even; No pressure to be something other than they’re not right now. They’re tired, and it’s okay. They’re lonely, and it’s okay. It’s okay, for a few moments, to just hold each other and get reacquainted with the feeling of sharing body heat, to hide under the covers and just be, like there’s no world outside. Tony is not thinking if there’s any hidden meaning to her words, or her caress on his chest, or anything else. He doesn’t have to. In these moments, they are not being guided by questions or secretive intentions, just the desire of having the other close…
But the world depends on it
But even then, Steve wishes he was alone with Natasha, just for this moment. He knows that vulnerability and Natasha is a very unpredictable combination, no matter how close they are, and he isn’t comfortable pushing these boundaries eve after years by her side. But he will push them. As kindly as he can, but he will, because Steve simply doesn’t know how to keep quiet in moments like this.
, and Steve gulps around nothing and decides he’ll keep this information to himself, as if Tony trusted him with a secret, and Steve will guard it close to his chest, safe, as it should be.
“We thought—” Bruce stutters. “We thought he had killed you.”
“Who’s in DC?” Rogers asks, as they all shuffle quickly to secure seatbelts to what they all know its gonna be a very difficult journey. He’s in his Captain America suit, all rattled and ragged, dirty and dark, and Tony struggles to keep his breathing even and stifle down a very undignified response at the sight of it.

Tony hovers above the hole on top of the plane, for the briefest of seconds, and goes down painfully slow, aware of any wiring or stray piece of foam or any other flammable object he might touch, watching, terribly hypnotized, as the dark interior or the cabin starts to creep closer, and closer, until he’s surrounded by it.

Oh, God. Pepper.
“Damage.” Tony says, shrugging. “In infrastructure, and political standing, and civilian casualties. We had an accident in 2016, where… Wanda accidentally pushed a bomb away from a crowd, but it went into a building, and it hit people. Twenty-three people died, including seven Wakandans who had been there in a peacekeeping mission.”
Since we're on the topic of children, I would like to raise a question for us to consider. There's a reason why I brought up Harley Keener. There is a reason why I believe Tony's determination to save Peter Parker is more important to assess his character than his relationship with Pepper. There's a reason why we're only talking about it now. And if I said Pepper is meant to showcase the duality of Tony's priorities and purpose, children - and whatever they might think of as children - also have a meaning of their own, the very foundation of this second big emotional discussion we truly can't escape if we want to get to the bottom of this.  Responsibility.

The armor finishes closing itself around Pepper’s frame, and as the joints lock up and the faceplate slams down, the eyes light up in a bright flare, just like Tony’s, and the parallels of it make him feel weak in the knees, and his palms sweaty and hot.

But he won’t. He will trust her. They can talk about it later.
“I’m not glad Wanda feels bad.” Clint argues. “I don’t want her to suffer. But if she wants to practice because she thinks she needs to be stronger, I’ll let her. If she wants to make up for the things she did when she was on Ultron’s side, I’ll

“There’s no better place than Grigorio’s.” Tony tells him, with certainty. “But take out is a no-go – it’s in Boston.”
Something has definitely shifted from the way it was before, disrupted from its original axis when Clint, Wanda and Scott left. Or maybe when Natasha brought them the news – and only now, when the rooms are suddenly just big enough for the three of them, and not terribly cramped, he can finally feel the way his breathing echoes against the walls when he’s alone, his enhanced hearing making his own sighs resonate like the sounds of missiles cutting through air; almost silent, always deadly, no matter if no one else can hear them. Like a looming threat that only he can hear.

Sam sits down beside him. Of all people, maybe not counting Clint, Sam is the one who likes high places the most. Steve thinks there might be a joke about birds somewhere in there, but he is too tired to chase it down to fully grasp it between the confusing corridors of his mind. But can tell by the way Sam doesn’t hesitate in throwing his legs over the edge either, not once making a face at Steve, as if he’s weird by deciding to sit in such a dangerous place; Only taking in the sight of the distant city and the nebulous clouds that slowly inch closer from the east, this is a place Sam too can feel at peace, perhaps even more than Steve can, right now.

Maybe he’s about to give Tony one of his sad speeches on how “he gets that Tony is upset, but that was unnecessary”, or how “that’s unfair, they all lost something, and Tony should stop blaming them and focus on what’s really important here”.
“After the attack in New York by the circular spaceship and after you were gone, Boss, no other invaders have been spotted in the United States.” FRIDAY informs, and as she does, she pulls up various images from cameras on the streets or nearby establishments that managed to capture any images of the Flying Donut descending in New York and Tony’s fight with Strange and Wong against the creepy mummy alien. “Ten hours after you followed the attacker leading the spaceship and the capture of Dr. Strange, Captain Rogers and the rest of the Avengers entered the building to meet Colonel Rhodes and Doctor Banner, interrupting Colonel Rhodes’ meeting with Secretary Ross.”
“Stark-Rogers.” Tony corrects, and Steve fully complies when he’s pulled forward by his tie for a kiss. “And I don’t think I’ll need it. I’ve got one right here.”
“Okay. Alright. Okay. I’ll… I’ll see you soon.”, and just as she does, someone speaks, on her side of the call, and Pepper lets out a sound close to the speaker that is too distressed for Tony not to immediately become alert.

Just as he doesn’t chase when Barton stops struggling, heaving in stuttering breaths through his parted lips, staring at Tony like a wild animal, before turning around and shaking the others off, to stalk into the Compound and disappear into the halls before anyone can stop him.

He can’t help but suppress a laugh at the sheer irony of it, of having them here, in this moment, when Rogers and his merry band are back. Christ, Barton is upstairs now too.

“I do not know the name you use, but yes, it sounds like the structure surrounding the star.” Thor affirms. “Stars are dangerous to approach, since they pull all objects who dare to come close into their cores. The structure is circular, and it surrounds it completely, so it stops the pull of the star from causing damage to whatever is outside. Since all power is enclosed, when you open it, it beams light into the forge, lighting it up.”

On his first day on campus, Steve gets a fist to the nose.

Natasha raises an eyebrow at him. “You really think Fury spent all this time after SHIELD shut down playing golf?”
“There are ways.” Tony affirms. “We can fix this, we just need the numbers. If we get enough people maintaining the system like it used to be, water, power, we can work on cleaning the air before it shuts us down completely. Nature does it all the time, right? It’s not her first time. We’re just gonna give her a push. Our species survived the Ice Age, Bruce, we can do this. We have to.”

The problem is that Steve can’t seem to have a single alone interaction with Tony that doesn’t result in bruising, and he’d really like that to stop.

And then, he remembers Jane Foster, and remembers that FRIDAY is still running the search for survivors and has yet to give him a report on who made it and who didn’t – and suddenly, he feels a little nauseous, because he doesn’t know what will happen if the final result comes up negative, and how Thor will respond to that information if he doesn’t know it already.

And for the next week that wish actually came true. Howard disappeared into his office more and more and Maria seemed to be too busy for quality family time. The mansion was filled with decorators and planners and just...people. Way too many people. On the plus side of way too many people, Tony was able to hide out from anyone that might want his attention. He spent his days blissfully alone. Even Natalie no longer dogged him at the moment. Then at night when it was time for food he would eat in the kitchen.
“What offputting activities is Jarvis worried about?”
Which was fine. Really. Rhodes was great, his best friend. Sure, they didn’t connect like...well, like Ana and Jarvis.

A daydream of being disowned and living life with his Honey-bear if nothing else. Too much of a scandal to undo it.

“Not every day a pretty little thing like you shows up. Almost like on a platter. After my boys are through with your alpha we’ll make him watch as we devour you.” the man grinned an ugly smile. Whether it’s the intention behind the smile or the gnarly scar twisting his skin on one end Tony couldn’t decide.
“Make a wish Tony.”
Tony opened up his wardrobe to see the new clothes. He wondered if vomit accented pastels properly or not.
