The germ of the problem lay in the obscurity of John’s motivation(s) for emailing Mary Morstan — an alias (although John was unaware of this) — in the first place. The subject-line of the email allowed for any number of possibilities: was he seeking her out simply to maintain his self-image as the ‘good bloke’ who remained friends with his exes? (Unlikely: he was not friends with any of his other former partners, excepting Sarah, a friendship borne of necessity (working together) not of any especial fondness (that Sherlock could tell); and Major Sholto (though the details of that relationship were scarce).) Even more unlikely, however, was the notion that John had attempted to get in touch with ‘AGRA’ to… attain ‘closure’: did people do that? reach out only to say goodbye? Nevertheless it was a possibility.
— ‘Your sodding brother must think I’m the thickest —’
the plan — not his preferred plan, anyway — but it was none of Mycroft’s damned business.
Sherlock sighed, and smudged his mouth together. But his tone was surprisingly gentle as he allowed, ‘Of course. Please, call me Sherlock, if it will be of use to you.’
They hadn’t spoken all day, but still John’s frown — not even slightly fractured by a laugh — set loose a wriggling eel in his abdomen. Mycroft’s grimace, on the other hand, was satisfyingly thin.
He grinned. He knew, with an acceptable degree of certainty, that she was capable of it. In all their years working together and being (at least John, and probably Molly herself would so-call it) friends, Sherlock had almost never seen Molly blink (figuratively or, most often, literally) at an oncoming threat. Feet secure, hair straight, bearing at times knotted but underneath that, balanced: she made, though she little knew it at times, a formidable, underestimated adversary.
beautiful – had always been staggeringly beautiful, and as strange as John felt to saying such a thing about him, about any man, he realised with sudden clarity that that Sherlock, the aloof, untouchable, untouched just-a-mate downstairs: that person no longer existed for him. Here, in John’s arms, was the man he was mad for, the one he could and desperately wanted to dance with in the sitting room, to call pet names, to kiss on his way out the door, to crawl over and make giggle and gasp beneath him, to hear laughing across a crowded room and know that before the night was over he’d have heard about not only the joke and joker that made the great Sherlock Holmes break into his genuine, stupid, lovely deep bubbling giggle, but also every unspoken secret in the room, every peculiar fact about the canapés and folded serviettes, every construction detour on every street they’d taken on the cab ride home.
‘HA!’ John had scoffed, face smarting with unconcealed fury. (With Sherlock himself? Or with the admittedly ludicrous suggestion that he remain behind?) ‘That’s not — absolutely
was Sherlock at his most indiscreet.) ‘Had you met my husband, you would not need to ask me this.’ Her fluid, melodic voice seemed to vibrate with her accent as much as her evident amusement at this absurd idea. (And, John admitted to himself, no man would be likely to find a more beautiful, self-assured, capable-seeming woman than the Countess, but of course, cheating wasn’t really about behaving rationally.)
,’ he swallowed, very glad that they had the sheet because he wasn’t going to last long enough to use the table properly and he didn’t want to think about the state of the floor.
His kisses slowly became frantic, edged with teeth that brought a full rosy flush to Sherlock’s lips, if only to remind Sherlock which one of them had the upper hand here. Come to think of which…
‘Now who’s being deliberately obtuse,’ John butted in.
‘What’s the magic word,’ muttered Peterson in a sickly chime. John didn’t bother acknowledging the remark but went ahead of her toward the interview rooms.
‘What?’ John wondered, dazed. He wanted to sink his face into Sherlock’s middle and breathe warm, slow, healing breaths into the still-recovering skin. Run his fingers up Sherlock’s sides, maybe while sitting side-by-side on the sofa. He would force himself to stay awake for that, if nothing else.
,’ agreed the voice, and then the static-silence of an ended line.
Had he said it purely to watch the incredibly plasticity of John’s face change arrangements at the speed of lightning, he would not have been in the least disappointed; equally, had he blurted it out in order to test the fortitude of his still-recovering bowels, it would have been a compelling experiment.
, John, you would still fundamentally look like yourself, in which case the problem persists.’
He exhaled, a loosening of his jaw and lungs followed by a stab of guilt. Sherlock had anticipated his apprehension (and hadn’t made him ask, hadn’t made him articulate the niggling, unfair mistrust that sometimes crept into John’s head when he least wanted it there).

With all the coolness of feigned (but familiar) disinterest, he blew out a puff of nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and hundreds of other ingredients (Sobranie, by the smell (and ash) of things) that Sherlock forced himself to remember were unnecessary to his happiness.

out of reach. He could string this out for ages, feeling the hum of winding frustration mounting in Sherlock, almost sweeter than the admittedly excellent symphony still reeling in his ears. Teasing, tipping his head to one side and inhaling only to pull back as the hint of his lips ghosted across Sherlock’s, then changing his feet and tilting his nose the other way, maddening and intoxicating and highly effective — Sherlock, he knew fervently, was an impatient sod, particularly when the air between them was charged and John was essentially holding him on the brink without having to do more than caress his wrist back and forth with a single finger.
Sherlock searched his face for a moment, then seemed to collect himself. ‘Probably not. I should look into Gruener’s finances, and Mycroft will probably have sent me CCTV of where Gruener went after the performance.’
Had Sherlock been standing beside him, he would have had to stifle his smile. Here in the shadows, a foot at a time, Sherlock clung to the margins of the room moving away from him instead of towards; listened to Suze’s fragmented, unimpeded mutterings (possibly high, prepared for anything – unpromising) as he neared his destination, the dais where Gruener (based on Suze’s outstretch gun’s indication) was standing –

It was on my tongue to inquire whether Holmes found fault with the argument itself, or if he was sufficiently convinced that I had enjoyed nothing more tawdry or licentious than a well-turned phrase on the timeless question of beauty itself.

He’d been given dispensation to take his furlough early: his father was dying. For the first time in eight years, he’d made the trek back to what had once been his home. Since his mother died, of course, it hadn’t felt like it, and even then… But it had been like stepping back in time, crossing that threshold. None of the regimental (he’d distracted himself with bad jokes) order or discipline of the military training he was then so close to completing. Almost the polar opposite, in fact: their childhood house greeted him in an absolute

Sherlock slowly, planted his feet on the floor, still perched on the edge of the bed. His everycolour eyes sparkled in the reflected hallway light.
‘I love you,’ said Sherlock.
Mycroft swerved slightly and attempted to catch the parrot in both hands, but received a frightened nip in return. Rather than injure Flint, Sherlock, mentally preparing a monograph on parrot intelligence, moved forward to reclaim her. His brother was squirming as Flint groomed ruffled feathers from her plumage, preventing Sherlock from getting a firm hold. Then, suddenly, Flint gripped Mycroft’s right shoulder tightly, lifted her bright red tail, and defecated on Mycroft’s £780 suit.
‘Many would disagree with you,’ Sherlock muttered.
, such absolution for the fact that Sherlock had been instrumental in the deaths of other human beings, had left John behind, when now he knew, or suspected, that in fact to bring John anywhere was to make the world, and himself, safer. John kissed him, twice (it was always the second kiss with John that mattered: the first was frequently the only one in a series, a gesture of affection akin to a brush of a hand along his shoulder as John paraded by on the way to work; when there was a second, however, it meant he wanted to stay. A second sometimes lapped into a third, a fourth, beyond count, but the second was always the richest, the taste on his palate just right, like the caress of fine, well-aerated Cabernet).
Before he could swallow back the words, he had asked, ‘Do you regret it?’

Not today, though.
After nine whole days, he’d cleared all but two rooms, ingested more bland tea and boring sandwiches than the entire of his army training so far, and started to wonder how he could delay his return if, as seemed halfway probable, his father carried on like this, unconscious but moments away from death, beyond the next week — possibly indefinitely. By that evening, sitting in the room once again, his own voice echoing in the thin walls as he attempted some poetry (

He doubled back the direction he had just come, sliding along the obscured edge of the hall back towards the main entrance where – by the sounds of it – a
Once, not really that long ago (nearly 900 days now), John had not worried so much. Well, all right, he had worried a great deal, but he had been able (once Sherlock had got him out of his head) to enjoy himself – the thrill of the chase, the thunder of his blood at the climactic moment of catching the criminal, the long drunk slide of euphoria during which he and Sherlock tended to laugh themselves silly and wandered back to Baker Street like conquerors – and had even drawn heady strength from the realisation that that had been
‘All right then. That’s… that’s good.’ John checked his watch, attempting to hide a smile. Sherlock wished he wouldn’t feel he had to. ‘I reckon we better get moving, then, if we don’t want to miss the Red Baron’s arrival.’ (The reference, if it was one, went over Sherlock’s head: irrelevant. More relevant: John was smirking, good humour gradually reclaiming its hold.) ‘And you’ve got that damn tuxedo. Another night of poncy women fainting all over you while you’re dressed as James bloody Bond.’
As far as Sherlock was concerned, they had all narrowly avoided being shot, burned, stabbed (again) or assaulted, and he wished to deal with these facts (and the ensuing adrenaline crash, post-traumatic episodes, and/or whatever lurking, banked, fury was still smouldering in the corners of John’s eyes) in the privacy of their own home. (If it still was theirs.
The rhinoceros’s departure left only John and himself amidst the last of the police cars and agents milling around, taking statements. Molly had, Sherlock had insisted, been escorted home (and would be receiving a subtle – if any of Mycroft’s people had a single competent bone in their body – visit from a psychologist in short order).
Only one chapter left—but I hope it's worth it. (I quite like it.)

The long survey of the regions between Baker Street and the pub restaurant at which these (oh, god, already roaring) festivities were to take place had been a productive one, not least for Sherlock’s ability to observe and review outward and inward data on relationships, subcategory: anniversaries.
Christopher practically sobbed a laugh of relief and leapt out of the cab, shuffling past him on clumsy feet as they made for the front door. The cabbie made a scoffing noise and muttered something John emphatically did not want to hear before speeding away into the night.
‘Don’t do anything too dangerous while I’m gone, yeah?’ he’d made Sherlock promise, swearing it right into the grin of John’s lips as they met one last time on the landing. ‘Can’t have you hogging all the fun.’

Whether it was his recent experiences or a side-effect of the medications, or simply a long overdue arrival at a critical mass, Sherlock heard himself say, casually, ‘Not unless you would prefer it, of course. Though, now you mention it, this might be an appropriate moment to state your preference, should you have one.’

(None of his various girlfriends had brought this to his attention, probably because none of his previous girlfriends had been willing to spend much time at 221b, what with the mad genius haunting the place like a ghostly, incredibly untidy chaperone.) Even the strict tidiness of his floor, of his books in their imprecise stacks beneath his bed and his albums (vinyl and disc) in the crate in his wardrobe, caught his eye as never before.
His mind ran through the images he had stored from scanning Gruener’s volumes, overhearing snatches of conversations of Molly and John’s speculations that struck his subconscious as important enough to preserve for study.

A few minutes later, Sergeant Peterson, the not-quite-friendly sandy-haired woman with bizarrely jarring mannerisms, came into view. ‘We’ll have to get you a desk if you keep this up,’ she joked, grinning, as John bid her hello. She looked at – he would nearly call it ogled – Sherlock.

So high that the mark on Sherlock's neck was completely hidden. John frowned.

Instead, he tucks his knees in more tightly and nudges once more with his nose. He doesn’t release his intaken breath until Sherlock squeezes his hand.

‘I believe you visited the apartments of the Countess of Morcar this morning?’ Mycroft pronounced, after a moment. He knew damn well where they had been, and probably how much they had paid for the cab fare and, thought Sherlock mutinously, how close John had been standing to Catherine Cusack before Sherlock had had to break (well, nearly break) an antique Waterford fluted vase.
‘Feed her cat?’
‘Cigarettes, Mycroft?’ Though his words were the typical bandying of brotherly crossfire, something in Sherlock’s weary, rasped tone carried a note of surprise, as though Mycroft’s lapse back into nicotine usage was highly out of character. ‘Low tar. Still smoking like a beginner.’
'Walking back into the flat over an hour later, Sherlock felt a renewed sense of justification in his hatred of most members of his species.'
of was the prostitution ring with the underaged minors — damning enough for Gruener himself, but… He had only scratched the surface, evidently. How were these ‘other parties’ involved? Did Gruener procure for them? Some high-level hypocrisy in the Border Control office? Was the art smuggling a front too, beyond the unseemly pieces Sherlock had already witnessed?)
He shifted his gaze back to Challa, who quite rightly seemed to have realised her positively

‘She?’ John asked, with a strange smile Sherlock couldn’t parse.
Sherlock had determined, halfway through a particularly precise movement of Mendelssohn, that Gruener, being ruthlessly methodical, imperturbable, and patient, would be planning for a long, elegant chess match. Their first engagement (their opening salvos, to borrow from John’s preferred metaphorical terrain: the martial) had exposed their respective
‘Cows were scawy,’ she informs him, voice quivering, and at this he looks up at her. She’s pouting, a remaining sniffle trembling on her small nose. ‘Da cows are too big. Big and they don’t like being petted. I thinked they were my friends because of their pwetty horns. But Papa yewwed at me. I want to see dem anyway because of they were soft and fluffy and they looked like unicorns but with two—dey were orange, Dada! But I’m not stupposed to pet dem even though I weeeeeeally want to. Can we see some orange cows tomorrow, Dada?’
For a second, he dared hope that this news would shock Harry into politeness. (He hated that it didn’t even register as possible that she might be happy for him, even though saying it out loud, for this first time, sent butterflies loose in his chest and a tingle up the back of his neck. ‘A couple’ had just slipped out, one of those convenient insinuating phrases people had been using on them for years.)

‘That should go on the t-shirt,’ Gruener remarked across the room.
Was it really going to go this way? John knew he’d gone further than he meant, in suggesting the case wasn’t important – of course it was. Horner was pretty clearly innocent, if proved no better than the compact, heavy bulge in the inner lining of John’s black leather jacket. More importantly, the cases in general were important: vulnerable people who mistrusted the police, or who simply appreciated (particularly after the disgusting, shattering fallout after Moriarty) that Sherlock was without question a

him, not ‘Sherlock Holmes, Great Detective’ but the lanky mop-headed marble-skinned git of a man who looked at John with dragon’s eyes blown dark. Who shivered as John stepped close and even more when he brushed back his curls, who melted, groaning needily, at whatever rush of words John whispered in his ear, intoxicatingly weak at the knees before John had done much of anything. Sherlock, who folded clumsily into John’s advances, and from there it was no struggle at all for him to want anything and everything from Sherlock’s body. To love him so deeply they were both shaking with it. To want him, all of him, and no one else ever again.
‘I’m showering,’ he announced, trying for (and not quite achieving) his customary authoritative tone, ‘and so help me, Sherlock, if when I get out you haven’t had at least a biscuit.’

He doesn’t know, of course—can’t fathom what spoiled the outing both of his beloved, ridiculous creatures were so looking forward to. Rosie even smells a bit like hay and popcorn and a messy good time.

If nothing else, explaining his logic on paper (well, electronic paper, Bow Street was hardly in the dark ages, no matter how archaic their representatives’ methodologies) had focussed his mind on facts, concrete and unemotional. He felt, in spite of the paraesthesia along his side, steadier. He rose, handing his curt but thorough explanation of events and the copy of private detective’s license (he, unlike John, was under no false impression that that had been Mycroft’s personal payback for Sherlock’s secrecy) to Sergeant Challa.

. It crashed heavily against the fortifications Sherlock had constructed around the information (poisonous, corrosive: radioactive) that Maureen had given him. He had told himself not to burden John with them.
‘God, that sounds brilliant.’ He stepped forward and leaned over, kissing Sherlock through a smile because nothing had ever felt like this – like someone was there to catch him, not just to have his back during a fire-fight or notice when something was wrong just by looking at him (although Sherlock could and had done both). They tipped forward across the bed (well, backward, for Sherlock, flat on his back and petting those beautiful, alien fingers along John’s sides) and John knelt over him, flooded with desire and affection and relief and… hope.
He watched, transfixed by the easy, calm precision of their movements and the slowly resolving shape of the figure (the mandala, he was told later) emerging from their craftsmanship. As the sun rose, patterns of blazing pinks, mint greens, golden yellows, and clear sky blues took on their distinct shades in ribbons and signs which, he naturally deduced, held symbolic meaning for the group. When finally, hours later shaking himself out of the stupor of absorption, he watched the men rise and, bodies aching (his own neck, at the minute angle he’d been watching their process, was sore; he glimpsed, in their muted way, the various strains of knees, shoulders, eyes, and ankles that afflicted them all), nod to him as they exited the hall. The mandala was incomplete (some areas had been traced but not yet filled in), yet already the vast circle of complex undulations, petals, complimentary colours, and dizzying business was demonstrably beautiful.
‘Just gonna keep it in my pocket for a rainy day, then,’ she grinned, then looked conspiratorially at John, who couldn’t help but grin: anyone who could make Sherlock blush was worth having around. ‘But that’s not what I’m here for, as I said. I’ve heard, through m’old job —’

Before he could stop himself, Sherlock had tidied away the ingredients and stealthily slipped up the stairs just as the hot water clunked off.

‘Nearly,’ he admitted, voice slightly hoarse. (Perhaps it had been rather longer than he’d expected. He examined the light through the windows, the sound of the traffic, Mrs Hudson tidying downstairs (did she never cease tidying?): late afternoon. Already.)
‘John,’ he’d therefore pivoted, calibrating his voice for gentle, ‘this is not your preferred tactic, I appreciate that,’ (a partial truth: John’s preferred tactic certainly did involve rushing headlong into danger, but only after more hospitable (boring) options had been exhausted) ‘which is why —’
He needed to think. The fingers of his left hand kept caressing the digits of his phone, as if itching to betray his decision not to ring Mrs St Clair himself, to tell her with brutal efficiency just why she had been crying and preparing to mourn for a man she loved and believed in. Finally, after a tenth or fifteenth turn at his window, his eye caught his well-worn trainers on the sill as the wind breathed a hint of rain over them. He stopped.

‘Very impressive,’ John smirks. Evidently Sherlock’s occasional protestations of being able to cure his various scrapes and bruises have distilled in Rosie’s head into a belief in magical self-healing. ‘How about we take this jumper off so you can get comfy with Peppa Pig? Did you see any real pigs?’
‘Like I say, Mr. Holmes, it’s Maureen you want. She’ll be able to help ya. This guy, though, he isn’t… well, he ain’t intelligent.’

As she disappeared upstairs, Sherlock took two steps forward and leaned over, splaying a hand across the table to peer directly into John’s face, to glower some more.

Instead John lay awake, frowning into his pillow for what felt like hours, listening to Sherlock’s equally sleepless breaths.
John’s gaze had regained its natural self-possessed, unshakeable demeanour, meaning he looked at Sherlock now like it was his birthday and Sherlock was the candle he was intent on blowing out.
‘All friends together!’ clapped Sherlock. ‘Fantastic.
‘Sherlock,’ he growled, left fingers ungripping the pillow to splay over Sherlock’s ribs in soft counterpoint to the rough obscene slaps of their sticky skin. He was close, could go over at any minute if he left himself, and he wanted to get Sherlock there too, to give in to the feedback loop of pleasure that Sherlock’s moans gave him, so he slid his hand down beneath Sherlock’s ribs and found his cock, a forgotten ache, immediately so rock-hard that Sherlock shouted in surprise and frustration, riding John’s angled thrust that pummeled his prostate to push himself into John’s fist, only twice, until he came with a long groan that, in a matter of seconds, triggered John’s hiss and a stream of words shuddering into white noise…

He heard more than saw Sherlock come to sit close beside him on the settee, a rustle of fabric as he pulled up the cloth at his knees. Sherlock had never understood personal space.
‘William Sherlock Scott Holmes,’ John whispered, his nose brushing Sherlock’s, voice firm and sure, ‘
John’s tense resistance like a concrete wall instantly erected around himself, protecting him from Sherlock’s onslaught. (Yet for over an hour, John and Suze had sat there, sharing some unreachable common thread, an inside joke between people who’d only just met. One of John’s well-worn skills, intimacy. All highlighting the simple fact: John needed other people; Sherlock didn’t.)
‘Faint smell of sick, poorly masked by heavy Chanel perfume; distaste for milk even though she prefers it in her tea; recent weight gain and dizziness; and her inflated sense of her husband’s worth as a result of hormonal fluctuations meant to foster relations to inspire equal sharing of parental duties. Incidentally she has not told her husband yet and I imagine we will be sent a confidentiality clause by the morning.’

With ten times more nonchalance he felt internally, he wiggled out from underneath Sherlock (

‘Short of actual
‘How do you — no, never mind that.’ John sat forward in his chair, daring Sherlock to stare back at him as he himself unravelled Sherlock’s words. ‘But “if she were” — hang on, she’s not reachable but your brother’s involved? What, did he need a nurse for a black-ops mission to Eastern Europe or something?’
th morning that week) forced himself to leave the flat.
‘Hey! Hey!’ shouted a short man coming from behind the counter with his arms outstretched as if to herd them back into the street. His thick Indian accent (Sherlock probably knew what town, never mind what province) was the same as on the interview tape Sherlock had purloined from Bradstreet yesterday. ‘You cannot come in! No customers! We are closed!’
‘Well, she…’ Molly looked between them. ‘Never mind.’

John yanked aside the sheet and sighed with overjoyed relief to find Sherlock completely naked underneath — flushed across his abdomen, a little bit hard and breathing unevenly — gorgeous — it had been

keeping it, I promise.’
Sherlock feigned interest. ‘Only if you go to the West End with Mycroft and my parents at Christmas.’
‘Had I arrived at Baker Street before I did, you wouldn’t even have been here.’
‘Please,’ John panted, ‘for
‘I didn’t…’ He licked his lips. Clinical voice: steady, confidant, devoid of judgment. ‘Have you done this before?’
— pause before Greg spoke, more than the braced tension of his voice, settled over John’s riotous blood like frost sinking in to stone.
‘Yes, tea: definitely,’ he repeated emphatically. ‘What d’you fancy, then, Molly?’
A strange, pensive look was dappled across John’s face, so Sherlock checked again that they had Ovid’s attention. One long moment later, John, inhaling as if to prepare himself to dive into a frozen pool, repeated, ‘Papagena.’
, it was not good,
Climbing the stairs, he heard the muffled conversation of the deep familiar voice and — a woman, talking in wide vowels punctuated with a piercing laugh. John could imagine Sherlock’s look of unconcealed distaste. Still surprising, how the smallest things visibly ruffled him, when the enormous things sent him retreating into himself, outwardly still and unmoved.

! Denial, John, that’s what they call it when your flatmate’s got you bent over the sofa –’
, considering when they’d begun this exchange, break over), he set his phone down and began mapping out the circuit he and Suze would take for today’s walkabout: around the Market, Camberwell, then down along the Brixton Road (pausing for side streets with relevant visibility:privacy:traffic:aesthetic ratios)…
Modesty was a false self-conception: certainly there would be a few audience members (of both genders, probably) who spared him an assessing glance. But of course, John’s modesty was entirely sincere: his confidence was founded more upon his experienced seduction techniques than his perception of his good looks. As ever, he underestimated himself.
‘Thank you, Inspector, we’ll be in touch.’
But John had shaken himself out of the reading about international art commissions law to work backwards. ’Don’t mind him,’ he told her. ‘He makes noises all the time. You get used to it.’
‘No, Sherlock, we – we need to talk about this, now, here,’ he gestured in a stirring circle between them. His lungs felt hot and sore and he knew he was opening floodgates, becoming sentimental when Sherlock had told himself in his stupid frightened head that emotions were simply baggage. Still he couldn’t stop. ‘Even if he stole it, Ryder doesn’t have the Carbuncle anymore! All the rest is details!’
‘Right. Well then I won’t say I’m sorry to hear it,’ he ventured with an attempt at humour. ‘Well, if this new bloke is any trouble, we’d be happy to frighten some sense into him.’
Sherlock’s eyes often flickered with amusement; other times he parroted (John’s mind was swimming with puns) a high, elegant trill which grated on John’s nerves as eerily as if it were a siren blaring, ‘Fake

Equally shocked, Sherlock was about to insist his innocence in the bird’s phraseology, but didn’t get the chance.
‘Well, this one’s from the 70s.’
‘Just,’ Sherlock admitted (
The world, tipped on its side and therefore wrong, didn’t seem to affect John, who was next to him, gravity-pressed; yet somehow — physics was not Sherlock’s primary scientific speciality — John was most heavily creased along his brow, the low, pained dip between his eyes, running perpendicular to the earth’s pull. He might be on reconnaissance, for all the noise his breath was making.

She wasn’t trying to flirt with him, not with any real aim in mind, but she gave every impression of the kind of silver spoon young woman who flirted by default and took advantage of most people fawning at the attention.

between them had fractured; a fault opened, John’s trust riven by Sherlock’s fundamental tendency towards logic over sentiment?)

slow as he listened to Molly (playing up, with the instincts of a natural, her breathlessness as anticipation, eagerness to have a fellow connoisseur to share her illicit interests with at last!) and Gruener (smitten, possibly, or sufficiently entertained to push the farce as far as it would go: equal likelihood of both) make innuendo-laden small talk about the putative ‘
‘Dr. Watson? Suze Winter,’ volunteered the (very, very petite, in very loud outfit) woman on their sofa, rising immediately (to, at most, five foot tall) and extending a hand, bracelets jangling.
‘I’m sorry, John,’ Sherlock said, after so long that John wondered if his mind had drifted and he had missed something.
Bradstreet led them to the wide main staircase and down toward the holding cells. As he descended the first step, Sherlock stopped, leaned back, and pushed a finger between his heel and the leather of his lace-ups. John was there in an instant, there to balance Sherlock or prevent him tripping down the stairs. ‘What’s wrong with your shoe?’
, if I’m honest.’
Not that he was eager to repeat the incident, mind. Not exactly a night he’d ever been proud of.
‘What’s –’ the gatekeeper began, shrugging on his blazer and gazing at the house. ‘You! Stay –’
‘You can’t wear a dress wrong,’ Molly retorted defensively.
‘African Grey parrots are widely considered to be among the most intelligent species on Earth, John.’ (John had once shared a

the kind of thing the mad idiot would do.)
‘No,’ he cut across, twisting round to look Sherlock in the eyes. ‘It’s… it’s fine.’ He nodded once to confirm this. The corner of Sherlock’s mouth had a small patch of mustard; the blotch on his neck was turning a furious shade of purple. John found himself staring, somehow, at both. He said, blankly, ‘If you got crumbs in my bed, you’ll be the one hoovering, I hope you know.’
Even so, John couldn’t completely ignore the strangeness of it all, lying here in the dark in Sherlock’s room without him. Having once upon a time laid in his own room, listening through walls and doors and muted movements to Sherlock’s nocturnal

The hard-set, searching look on Sherlock’s face, swimming in his everycolour eyes as though he was worried he’d said something
Sidenote: I really, really, *really* wanted to get this whole fic up before Series 4 hits us all in the face with a crowbar. Alas. Holding my breath--and good luck to you, too.
. He was proud of this accomplishment, and rightly so. Well, not that the great masses of published authors were any proper competition in any sense, but John had worked hard (harder than either of them had necessarily expected to be required) to transform the cases and the blog into a book. A dream of his, he’d confessed to Sherlock, very early on — back when the blog had just started attracting a following, and one of Harry’s comments had piqued Sherlock’s curiosity. To send his words into the word; to see his name on bookstore shelf with his heroes and the other beings whose minds had survived their bodies into immortality.
Sherlock wasn’t sure what to do next. He felt overly aware of his involuntary processes, as though he could hear the gummy reflex of his blinking, the bristle of his leg hair beneath his trouser-legs and socks as he shifted his weight. (No doubt John, being exceptional, had conquered this alienation early in his medical career. Sherlock, being exceptional in an entirely different way, was seldom free of it.) Did John — want to be touched —? or was that inappropriate, in some way —
(Intriguing, but false. How did he account for his relationship — certainly sexual — with Mary Morstan, the woman Sherlock was not supposed to know existed, and the ring John had very nearly given her during that interval? Had he made the same declarations, the same promise, to her?)
from scratch —
‘I DON’T WORK FOR THE POLICE!’ Sherlock heard himself shout, voice reverberating on the glass and porcelain and tile of the kitchen,
you’ll get out again.’
At just that moment, John’s mobile began to buzz in his coat pocket. Meeting Sherlock’s eyes from beneath lowered eyelids, he stared. Didn’t budge for two full rings before at last leaning in the opposite direction, never breaking eye contact, as he went about digging out his phone.
Sherlock rose. (Like cats watching a laser pointer, both of them: heads following him up but neither of them readying to move from their seats.) ‘I’m sorry, Sir James, but I cannot take your case.’ (He wasn’t especially sorry.)
To which end: he pushed open the door to the pub.
Sherlock said nothing in reply, but leaned into the wall beside John with a distant yet alert look. ‘He’s in there, I’m sure,’ Sherlock confirmed to himself. He settled, his elbow knocking gently against John’s in a way the latter still found thrilling. Oh, he had missed
‘Okay, well. That must be fine then.’ His throat felt sore, the same knife-edged panic scuttling around inside him, never entirely quelled, rising. ‘In that case, I guess I just have to be glad the universe bends to the will of the great Sherlock Holmes.’
John allowed himself to roll his eyes at the ceiling. He’d waited more than three weeks since he’d found the dark bottle on his dressed one morning, stopping him in his brisk routine. It wasn’t that the cologne didn’t smell good. It smelt fantastic, of course —firewood, like the smoke from a crisp, cold forest camping fire, combined with the familiar whiff of Earl Grey — posh as hell and, damn the man, in keeping with what John (if
‘ (the reply itself saturated with significance: ‘
Then, with a stifled stretch so as not to wake the faintly snoring man beside him — Sherlock must have gotten up at some point and then (John smiled) come back to bed, considering he was wearing his rattiest pyjamas, exposed infinitesimally to the new day as John brushed a finger along a single curl — John forced himself out of bed. Time to face the day.
(Thus, the source of Mycroft’s great maxim: ‘Caring is not an advantage.’ Because unquestionably it would be necessary to break into Gruener’s estate and search for clues, if not tonight — and it seemed all hell would break loose if Sherlock carried out that mission just now — then very soon. So long as Gruener kept, as Sherlock suspected, the whole or the critical piece of his collection in a place he deemed adequately safe, naturally it would come down to locating said place and plundering it, even against the (frankly, moderate) risk of injury or discovery.)
‘Then again, maybe it would be best if you
He grimaced. How little, at times, John knew him.
After a second to prepare himself, he looked up at Sherlock. The red-rimmed desolate anger of a moment ago had given way to an expression very like when Sherlock’d asked whether John
Suze took a deep, shuddery breath and shook her head, tongue worrying one of her false-brightened teeth until she found her voice. ‘It’s over now. I nearly went broke trying to take him to court — or to put it in print. Lost my job, my references, my lease, every appeal I put in, took out a loan and lost m’great-grandmother’s good china that we’d had since before the war.’ She took another minute to prevent her voice from breaking again.
for nearly a quarter of an hour. Had it not been for the guard (an idiot with a hangover, only marginally more effective than a scarecrow), Sherlock would have located the book, covered his tracks, and been on his way back to Baker Street before Gruener had even made an appearance. Still. Sticking to the script had its uses.
knew his entire (slightly embarrassing) given name, but he found himself slowly, gently divested of the book and instead grasping for dear life to the biceps of John Hamish Watson, RAMC, three years in Afghanistan, a veteran of Kandahar, Helmand, and Barts Teaching Hospital, doctor, soldier, blogger, police consultant, author, brother, friend, and…
For a moment, Sherlock seemed about to flee, but, after a breathless pause, he sat down, almost absurdly bunched across the no-man’s-land which had once been their sofa.
As he finished returning some order to the kitchen, his mobile
still brushing his cheek, even now keeping him warm against such gloriously typical London autumn drizzle… Today his imagination wove fantasies out of the threads of the morning, painting a vision of a moon- and candle-lit villa on the edge of some island beach, Sherlock seated across from him, collar opened at the top of a crisp white shirt, none of him grey or wrinkled but just as he was now, breathtaking, as the ocean whispered over their dinner, long fingers caressing the stem of a wine glass dewed against the tropical breeze, quiet and smiling and all John’s.
‘You never did practise enough,’ Mycroft preened, turning to look at him.
, and plan. Even so far your actions have not gone unnoticed, or unquestioned. I strongly suggest a lower profile. Do you understand me?’ he added, at the loudest possible volume below a shout, as Sherlock had been making sure to clatter everything — their spare salad-washing thing and the various moveable parts on the burners and appliances that could withstand a bit of noisy twiddling — within reach.

Pushing the dial up to hot, he stepped into a brisk shower, scrubbing the last of the day away, the hair-dye and acid cream and blood seeping down the drain, carrying with them the onslaught of dark little voices and screams that he’d heard tonight and would probably hear again in his dreams for a while to come. Pushed away questions and guilt and other people’s consciousnesses, all out of his mind. He peeked into the sitting room on his way, saw Sherlock standing now in front of the mantle mirror, just where John had gone. Still processing, then. Swallowing a lurking gnaw of doubt, he padded on.
‘No, I meant —’
‘Who did that?’ Molly interrupted.
‘—tweeted how scared she is and how she’s going to get all her friends to send you their good wishes.’
She pursed her lips into the sort of tight mousy line it often made when Sherlock was pressing her to do something.
The restaurant itself, on the ground floor of a very up-market hotel, at least offered high-ceilings, so they wouldn’t be completely overheard in their less-than-warm conversation; the bar, thankfully, was vacant of both customers and a bartender, despite looking for all the world like a gold-and-brass piece of a film set, carefully lit beneath an ostentatious double-winged balcony. (As he had told Sherlock, he suspected the only way through this lunch was forward, drink in his — and only his — hand.) Around them, other people appeared to be having perfectly lovely lunches. Such things were, it seemed, still possible, even on grey windy Wednesdays after uncertain domestic rows and more certain everyday madness.
‘John,’ Sherlock murmured, confused, ‘this is not your preferred tactic, I appreciate that, which is why —’
Momentarily John’s face creased with scepticism, before, after evidently making sense of Sherlock’s point, he swallowed. Then — infinitesimally — his shoulders unclenched. Sherlock felt his face burning, but refused to fidget or otherwise betray the enormity of this admission.
John whipped around this time without remembering to guard his expression. Sherlock’s eyes, woozy rather than sharp, met his in an immediate conversation.

The taxi pulled to a halt outside 221 and Sherlock naturally leapt out. John tried not to get ahead of himself as he paid the cabbie. The case was very much on, and even in private he might not get the opportunity to discuss matters right off the bat. And he still had the niggling feeling that Sherlock was very literally putting as much space between them as possible.

Frowning, Sherlock returned his attention to Sgt. Challa and began to pace as he attempted to fit the narrative into alignment with the evidence.

John looked up instantly. So, out of the corner of his eye, did Sherlock. ‘What?’

meaning essentially, 'Let us drink, for we must die'.
He picked up his head limply, nose and lips sighing along Sherlock’s skin, the closest approximation to kisses available in his still-submerged lassitude. He wondered too, as he pressed one proper kiss to Sherlock birthmark — and Sherlock ‘hmmed’ beautifully, a noise that John wished in the unspeakable depths of his soul he could locate in Sherlock when they quarreled, just to remind them both how profoundly right they were together, when there weren’t any words to get in the way — he wondered if any of Sherlock’s former lovers had lavished attention on this delightful quirk of his skin. If they had noticed, or cared.
‘Don’t pretend this is just me, Sherlock,’ he growled shortly, but guilt was now corroding his feelings about the past few days (few weeks). Yet he knew, he
, he might have added, though that hardly merited the name of a ‘deduction’.
Through the white noise of his breathing, the distant noise of someone drunkenly laughing in the midnight hour down on Baker Street: it would not have woken him, had he been asleep.
‘And you don’t remember anything?’ John pressed gently, looking him in the eyes searching for reassurance. ‘I know you said, the other day, but —’
‘Molly, isn’t it?’ Mary went on blithely, evidently in no hurry. ‘I’m surprised to see you here as John’s beard. On top of… Seriously, John, did you really expect anyone to buy the moustache?’ The way her tone curved into familiarity when addressing him – Sherlock wanted to tear the sound to
When he’d been in trekking through Asia (well, on the run, traversing an enormous zig-zag from Serbia that landed him, bruised and shaken, awaiting orders to attend a rendez-vous in Jakarta: but same difference) he’d found refuge temporarily in a Buddhist monastery in Tibet. Nestled into the rocky mountainside, the entire building complex had a stillness that smacked his ears with a hushed, dementing quiet, like nothing so much as the rehab facility he had despised with every fibre of his being ten years before. But the pledges of privacy, safety, and anonymity were too valuable to be refused for the simple matter of his own unfortunate memories. (More recent memories had at that moment been shrieking and hissing in his ears, overwhelming the old ones, analogous to how he imagined electric shock therapy fried whole constellations of neural pathways.)
Outside of a cartoon, he hadn’t known a person could blink as much or as quickly as Sherlock, dazed and possibly short-circuited, blinked at this suggestion.
, Sherlock thought wildly: harmful to the plant that created it, locked inside a glucose-based compound until released by enzymes upon ingestion, causing in a tingling, lachrymatory reaction in the ingesting animal; the potent sting of horseradish, wasabi, mustard. His scalp and insides itched painfully in places he knew he could not reach. It was delicious.
‘But at least they’ve had the oven timer replaced,’ Sherlock went on, upending the lamb over the rice he’d oh-so-elegantly globbed onto a plate. His mouth was on fire (John could tell from the way his nostrils were flared), but the stubborn git was also probably half-starved and definitely more-than-half mental. ‘I was wondering when they would realise it wasn’t just the kitchen staff all miraculously going deaf.’ With two fingers, he swiped around the inside corners to slide the remaining red sauce onto his plate, before licking them clean.
Waiting for a reply (
‘Yes, yes,’ John droned, standing up and collecting the emptied (plastic) water pitcher. ‘Takes away from the victory of solving the riddle.’
Suddenly he swooped down, yanked the cap off Boone, and pressed the hot towel to his face.
And, right back to infuriating.
‘That’s it. You’re telling me you didn’t know about Mary? Fine. I – I can accept that. I may need to punch your brother but that’s... You didn’t have time to warn me about Suze. I get it. I believe you. I didn’t… I’m not good at this stuff, but I don’t…’ He grimaced at his own inarticulacy. ‘Seeing you there, after the hospital, after walking inside that house and leaving you where I couldn’t see you… It wound me up, all right? I overreacted. I’m sorry. But that’s not what I meant, before.’
’No, I d—’ Sherlock began to scoff, turning around from where he was disposing — the single act of communal cleanliness he ever performed — the old coffee filter and dregs, but he stopped mid-way and goggled at… ah. The dressing gown. He’d forgotten.
Whatever life was, fairness didn’t come into it.

‘T’ra!’ Flint wished her cheerfully. ‘Thanks for the cake!’
‘Turn over,’ John encouraged him, scooting back. Sherlock swallowed and turned over.

He blinked a little thickly at the first new voice to speak to him in what felt like a century. A kind smirk met his gaze, on a friendly, carefully stubbled face, honey-brown eyes smiling brightly with mirth (or mischief) echoed by that mouth upturned at such a wry angle.
Sherlock huffed, scowl knotted. ‘I was on a case.’
‘Crawl,’ he repeats, for the rest of them, in case anyone wanted to follow his reasoning.
, it would all have been for nothing — less than nothing — a crime beyond any rational estimation, that John’s hot scratchy skin might have gone cold before Sherlock had had a chance to touch him like this —
‘I love you,’ John (hair gone dishevelled from recent rough treatment) said, for the
Not as such, no. ‘I was thinking about composing a blogpost about it.’
‘Mr. Holmes, I act on behalf of one who wishes to save a young woman, a foolish young woman, whose only real crime has been that of granting her trust to a blackguard. You cannot imagine the grave consequences of your refusal.’
He slammed the car door shut slightly more forcefully than necessary.
he didn’t have to go back to work because, yes, much better: he was going to go to the ridiculous
‘No, no, no, that’s not going to work, don’t split hairs,’ John began, shaking his head and climbing out from under his computer. He rose, and Sherlock rocked backward with the momentary impression that John was going to kiss him – but, Sherlock found with a recoil of his stomach, instead he simply went to inspect more closely their latest interlocutor. Then he looked at Sherlock, a victorious smile poorly concealed on his face. (Of course, Sherlock could tell from the angle of John’s eyebrows and the number of wrinkles on his forehead whether John was pleased about an achievement, but didn’t think it was relevant to bring this up. And in any event, the more opportunities to study the contortions of John’s mouth, the better.)
Lady Ayenat Braithwaite, on the other hand, was completely eye-catching. She was probably, John thought to himself, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in real life. A previous case had involved a lot of (ultimately irrelevant) research into East African goddesses and superstitions; John considered, now faced with the almost literal radiance of the Countess, that he too would have worshipped any woman who sat elegantly, spoke deeply, and smiled widely like that. Then again – as the newspaper photos and caption had reminded him – she had been an actual international supermodel before her marriage, so she was basically worshipped everywhere she went.
‘No point torturing your violin, Sherlock,’ chided Mycroft blandly.
Few things encouraged Sherlock to believe in a vindictive cosmos so much as the appearance, in such moments as these, of his brother on the landing.
‘Any answer,’ John swallowed, ‘is fine. Honestly. I don’t need one right —’
see her body? You’re a clever woman, surely you find that more than a bit suspicious? Do you want to wake up, ten years from now, and realise that all along he's been lying to you? Do you really want to be one of those girls?'
Valuable animals often went on long waitlists, one of which almost certainly contained a ‘Henry Baker’ (as the careful script on the receipt noted). In addition to which, Sherlock was confident, this bird in particular had been trained certain phrases which gave clues as to the residence, occupation, and intention of her would-be owner. Child’s play.
John’s bitter laugh made something slither in his stomach. ‘No,’ he warned, and his voice had dropped to that pitch that meant Sherlock was indeed playing with fire. ‘No. I’m not doing this. Don’t get off subject.’
But sentiment was a sure-fire way to put him off.
‘What’s… Is something wrong?’
He plucked the jewel carefully from her palm, examining it at eye-level. The Blue Carbuncle, as the stock photograph from the Morcar estate archives had shown, was indeed a lustrous, azure gemstone of slightly larger size than a grape, smeared slightly from its recent excretion but nevertheless of visible brilliancy. It had been cut into a precise ‘emerald’ shape but would have been absurdly oversized for any setting smaller than a tiara, which was unsuitable for anyone below a duchess (and even then).
as a friend. He’s such a narcissist –’
But he was exhausted, and at some point, he was out of words. Besides, now everything that mattered was between them, spoken, out, and ready for rest.
His fingers were beginning to ache so he pulled all the harder on the bow, scraping the D-string on the next pass, the calluses on his middle and ringer fingers searing, so he clenched his toes in his shoes to distract his mind from the pain and played as the violin wailed.
Like he still half-expected John to reveal a hidden joke at his expense, at the cruellest possible moment.
‘My beloved Violet has now a necklace of diamonds and a lover whose devotion is impervious to the slanders of devising minds. I can be quite… hypnotic, if I choose, you know, Mister Holmes.’
‘You’re here because I asked Shinwell to send me anyone with information that they had not shared with the police about Baron Heinrich Gruener.’
Fingers tensed, balled, then released — he grabbed two forks. Sherlock’s skin screamed.
Which had prompted his, admittedly less-than-fully considered (
’Help yourself,’ Sherlock replied distractedly. The first bin, so far, showed very little of interest: a pungent array of collapsed boxes of crackers or pasta, gooey heads of tomatoes, apples, lettuce, oil-stained parchment paper from pastries — ‘No grease on the coat!’ he called, as Suze just about made it to the corner —… bits of dental floss, used condoms (these gloves were, blessedly (deliberately), not his nice pair: they were destined for this very bin once his search was complete), takeaway menus and polystyrene containers, plastic packets with the residue of — he sniffed — caviar, another of smoked salmon, a third of prosciutto: rather more splendid a spread than the rest of the contents, all store-brand ravioli and the same faux-healthy bars that John bought (at the same discounted price, most likely). So: approximately two, possibly three, days ago, a posh evening affair, requiring the — yes, here it was — supplements of

The fact that a man curled in half on a settee, at half past eleven in the day, still in his dressing gown, could so orchestrate my actions provoked a flicker of rancour in me, matched only by my rising sense of self-righteousness. I had indeed been reading Morris’s long-since delivered address, having stumbled upon an old issue of the thing while tidying my side of bookshelf in our front room. Nor had I ever been in the habit of going to such idiotic subterfuges as to replace one cover for another. In the past, whenever I had wanted to avoid Holmes knowing — or, since that often was a hopeless aim, to avoid at least his jibing — I simply waited until he was out, or until I was alone in my rooms. But it had been years since I hidden anything from him at all; the teasing was taken in stride; and my appetite for reading, certainly of a companionable afternoon, tended now towards the philosophical, rather than the melodramatic.
at holding your drink. The day after we could go for a walk through Regent’s Park, and you could show off for me and I could pretend not to notice how much you admire the kids when they find good hiding places in the flowerbeds even though their parents will tell them off. We could… We could have a kid of our own, someday, a little clever thing that made you tell her Victorian ghost stories, or dragged you to Bart’s to meet Molly so he could learn how to prepare his own slides.’ His thick murmur wavered for a second, stumbling at the shock on Sherlock’s face, but he quickly went on. ‘Or not. We could take care of Mrs. Hudson if and
‘Dr. Watson,’ she pealed, and for god’s sake when was his life going to stop being a parade of plummy-voiced toffs who thought they were above the law? ‘Do come in, we’ve been expecting you.’
‘What?’ he asked, concerned.
‘You have terrible taste,’ was the only thought that made it out of his mouth, choked thought it was.

Eyes opening again, he sees, just for a moment, Suze bent low over him in the grey bright day, crying, mobile shaking in her hand, ‘Please hurry, there’s blood, oh God, there’s blood all over —’
’ (John understood what such ‘requests’ from well-connected people amounted to) ‘a result as soon as possible, so we have no time to lose.’ He was on his feet, tugging on his coat and circling the kitchen table as he deposited his mug (apparently coffee, considering the smell in the air) in the sink. ‘Horner’s at the station being questioned by Bradstreet, as if that were any use at all, and then I expect we’ll need to see the hotel ourselves, even if the police had trampled all over the scene as usual. Possibly a seven if the security at the hotel is remotely correlative to their per-night rates. Here,’ he added, thrusting a newspaper into John’s hands before grabbing his keys from the high-table and striding out.
An hour later, climbing back into bed, smelling of fried oil and ears chilled by a faint drizzle, John felt his heavy eyes sliding shut before Sherlock was even properly under the duvet.
He felt ridiculous still, somehow childish, in the face of such obscenity, of taking someone else's genitalia into his clumsy-eager mouth, a caveman chasing an evolutionary dead-end, relishing the primal cues of arousal and blood and sour pubic hair so close to his nostrils, along his tongue. He tried not picture himself as though from the outside, ever-failing (he failed more often than he succeeded: such was John’s magic that anyone believed otherwise); tried to focus on John’s marquee-lit display of
The air in the flat transformed to resemble a nothing quite so much as a stake-out. With preoccupied voices, they traded information from documents spread over every available surface, buoyed up by constant fillings and fillings of mugs of tea.
He took a bite of his sandwich.
‘Ever the eloquent man of letters.’
‘… and a bucket of very warm water – not boiling, yes,
For a moment they were all silent. Then John burst out laughing, an enormous smile across his face that utterly erased the tension of a moment ago. ‘You have
There. John would find that interesting, and would appreciate — yes — must be having a tea break — a flush of pleasure upon the vibration of his phone in his hand —

‘Nightmare,’ Sherlock diagnosed without moving. John closed his eyes and focussed on Sherlock’s voice, his real voice, pushing the echo –
the vice-tight whorl of Sherlock’s body, an action, probably more than his words, that well and truly shattered Sherlock’s breath into accelerating snatches.
Neville St Clair was, he told himself as he chewed, nothing new. Money, Sherlock had said, and John supposed, what with the decline in many journalism jobs, and the two St Clair children probably growing out of their clothes every other month, he had only done what he thought was best. The mistake of faking his death had probably been just that: a mistake. And, John added to himself as he rinsed his plate of crumbs, wasn’t it better, in some ways, that it had all been a mistake? That he wasn’t, after all, dead?
Another hour’s research yielded Gruener’s self-published reflection (all self-important lies) on the
‘I already have the appropriate dress selected,’ Sherlock boasted. ‘It’s in your size.’
‘I didn’t even know he was there! I thought he’d left!’ Ryder pleaded. ‘Honest to God, sir, I never thought they’d blame him–’
‘I didn’t say it was funny.’
John tried very hard not to be floored, and failed. His good suit and best dress shirts had been on the back of his door last night, but amidst everything else he hadn’t even registered it. This, on top of Sherlock’s customary peace offering, agreeing to eat dinner. Sherlock didn’t do domestic, much as John badgered him occasionally, but this seemed… caring, somehow. And that final fragment was a minefield of its own:
‘Say, “cheese”!’ John tapped the screen which emitted a faux-shutter snap. ‘Well, that’s the Christmas photo sorted for the year. Check that off my to-do list.’

She bit her lip to keep it steady.
‘I knew you’d be a chatterbox in bed,’ John joked, but then he kissed him firmly again, while his thumb dragged feather-light circles around the inside plane of Sherlock’s wrist, and Sherlock wanted to kiss him until he
Amidst so many variables, the most glaring were the facts of the (returned) engagement ring, and the length of time between their last (known) communication and this failed one. The most unfortunate caveat, on the other hand, was that there was a bland, rational, dispassionate lump of tea and cake who had assured Sherlock, during his first week back to Baker Street, that the assassin who had so nearly been John’s wife (
