not the time.
“Potions,” Sherlock says, lamely. He needs to do better than this if he wants to keep John around. “It’s just I know you want to be a Healer and potions would be important for your O.W.Ls.”
John tears his eyes away from the blonde man and looks back towards Sherlock. His shoulders are tense, his back stiff and John realizes he’s probably uncomfortable, doesn’t know how to deal with flirting or unwanted propositions. John doesn’t think it through, just reacts out of pure instinct as he wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist and puts his mouth close to his ear in a clear show of possession. He feels Sherlock’s body tense, but he relaxes when he realizes it’s John who’s entered his personal space.
“Did you mean it?” Sherlock asks, his voice suddenly serious, but somehow shy.
ridiculous. He’s never even talked to him – no one does – and yet, it’s like he feels compelled to look, like he’s drawn to him by some kind of greater force he has absolutely no control over.
John shrugs, can’t really tell Sherlock it’s because he’s jealous – fine, he can admit he’s a
John feels his blood boiling in his veins, anger gripping his throat as his body vibrates with rage. Sherlock isn’t even his… he knows that, but he still feels the insult deep in his bones, like he wouldn’t deserve Sherlock if they were together, like he wouldn’t be good enough for him. And hell, maybe that’s true. Lord knows how gorgeous the man is. He looks like he could have been sculpted in marble by Michelangelo, his beauty statuesque, all smooth skin and sharp edges. Of course John could never hope to hold a candle to him. There was a time, during his army days, when he was arguably fit, his muscles toned, skin tanned from the blaring afghan sun, no extra weight around the middle. He’s under no impression that he can compare to Sherlock, certainly not now. But he sure as hell would defend what was his if Sherlock had chosen him.
"I don't understand-" John starts and stops, his head shaking vigrousaly before turning to Sherlock "why would someone do this?"
"You... you did all of this?" John asked, halting in his steps to face him "You actually thought of all this?"
"He was right" He laughed, a bark more like "You really do defend him, it's beautiful, really. Also, pathetic. It's taken you years to finally get John Watson, you were to much of a fool to do something before and now you have, it's too late"
"Please don't tell me you boys are arguing again" Mrs Hudson rolled her eyes as she stood in the doorway looking at the two men standing nearly against each other in a puddle of hot mess and breathing problems. Completely unaware "you have no time for it, I'm afraid. You have a visitor"
"Lestrade text" John said, glancing at his phone on the arm rest of his chair "They arrested him around an hour ago - he admitted to everything immediately before they could even arrest him"
"So? That's why you came back? Because you like me? Or?"
"You think nobody would mourn him? Jesus, you're so wrong - Sherlock has friends and family, so many people that love him dearly, some of which have waited and waited for his return, for a sense of security and safety, I waited twelve years for him to come home to me and if I was to lose him now, I would mourn him until the day I die. That's the difference between your brother and Sherlock, nobody cared for him, he was nothing more than a loose cannon that the world could happily live without"
"how can you be so sure?" John asked, his voice appearing as nothing but a faint whisper, all that was needed from the proximity between the two "- Sherlock, you've never been with anyone else. How do you know that this isn't just a fling? Something in your head that's telling you that it's right? You'll get bored, you'll move on and find a new experiment"
"He never left" Sherlock stated, simply. "I felt to be cautious around you, due to my actions. I am still here"
"What I said, Doctor Watson. Unfortunately 221B has been hit with an extremely upsetting attack, the entire flat went up in flames - it is, somewhat, un-fixable unlike last time. The damage has affected the house next door, also"
He scooped an arm around his waist and pulled him into his chest, then placed a sloppy, tired, adorable kiss against his lips "Good morning"
"so, stage one of winning you over is a success? Yes?" Sherlock asked.
"Oh, of course, let me do the dirty work" John laughed, holding his wine glass to his lips. Finally turning his attention to the others around the table.
" Sherlock defended, allowing John to lift him and walk him over to the sofa.
"Mrs H, for the last time, he is not my bloody boyfriend!" John sighed, heading up the stairs.
"What?"
"Of course. Don't ever doubt your fathers love for you - you're his world, always" He confirmed, his eyes still furrowed as he looked at her with complete compassion.
"So" John spoke, the word longing on his tongue. He leant back, glancing over at Sherlock who was still sat in the exact same position that Mrs Hudson had sat him "I assume there's something you need to talk to me about?"
He halted in his stance, completely frozen as he felt Sherlock's hand lace its way down onto John's thigh and then he gripped it, pulling it back so John could no longer hide. And then, much to John's shock, he pressed over his groin, this time gripping it in his hands.
"I'm fine Greg, how are-" he was halted as he heard a shout from the hallway "can you hold on a second?"
"Are you okay?" The question made him jump, he wasn't quite expecting it. He turned to Rosie who was frowning at him with utter concern.
"You're going to have to deal with this sooner or later, Sherlock. The game will begin soon and you will have to react, its in your nature. I agreed to allow you back into London to see Mr Watson but I didn't say you wouldn't deal with consequences of your return"
John stiffened, his vision blurry as the anger took over him "Don't you dare pin this on him, your brother did that all on his own - he chose every move he made, every stupid bloody decision and ultimately, instead of saving himself and Sherlock, he took his own life instead - you lost your brother because he was sick, mentally and physically unwell and he needed help, where were you?"
He frowned, mounting the final steps and noting the odd silence. He stood outside the door, fixing his shirt and hair once more. He sighed "Sherlock" as his hand pushed the door ajar, he wasn't sure what to expect when it opened.
"Uhm" He opens his lips and closes them, his eyes furrowing together as he thought, it took seconds as Sherlock stared at him intensely and then, it clicked "-Shit"
"Yes, well, he was. Until he left"
"She seems pleased" Sherlock noted.
Sherlock's green eyes reflected against the headlights of the cars that drove past, he flickered his sight down to John's clenched fist, gripping so tight it was as though he was just holding onto the last drop of hope he could. Sherlock took a deep breath - extending his fingers to caress his hand, his fingers running circles until John's hand slowly released, finger by finger unclenching until he allowed Sherlock to lace his fingers through his own.
"-Scared that he'd hurt me or worse, not be able to help me. Does he not realise that running away and leaving me alone when I needed him most was the most hurtful thing he could do? That's how he hurt me, but why would ever consider that? He's heartless, always has been and always will be. So you can preach as much as you like about Sherlock Holmes loving me, Mrs H, but the fact of the matter is, he can't love me, because he's incapable of loving anyone"
adores you, I think that maybe her dad going from straight, once married to a woman to suddenly with a man will be confusing in some way or another"
"Isn't this lovely, all of us together again. I'm glad I didn't die, wouldn't have wanted to miss this" Mrs Hudson delightfully spoke, leaning her head in her hands as she looked at the pair.
"Not yet Sherlock" John interrupted "I want answers"
"So" John starts cautiously, sitting himself up slightly "does that mean you haven't worked out his next move yet?"
Her eyes flickered between the two boys, a fond smile across her lips "Well, I'm over-joyed. My two boys finally together, all I could have wished for"
"Should have stayed. I prefer it"
"But why?"
"She adores you, can't see why"
"Okay, you've made your point. I don't know Rosie, I want you to meet him it's just-" he halted, feeling his phone vibrate against his leg. He sighed, attempting to get his phone from his pocket as he carried on "I'm not sure if now is the right time"
"Two beers coming right up" Rosie winked, barging past the two of them.
"What?" Both Lestrade and John asked, both equally as confused as the other - Lestrade's confusion only irritated him, John however,
"so, he wants to burn you to the ground?"
"Yes" Both Sherlock and John spoke together.
"I suppose you're right" he agreed.
"So, how long does he usually sit like this?" Rosie asked, cocking her eyebrow as she meant towards her dad.
"Well, I like you" John retorted.
"Are you sure?" John asked, frowning as he walked over to the fridge to grab the milk.
"Beyond belief" he said, sitting in the chair by the dining table, unbuttoning his jacket "it's like talking to a brick wall most times, she really is a pain in the arse sometimes. She stole my credit card, can you believe it?"
"You're more the type to sit in an office and observe rather than be apart of the action"
He pulled his phone from his pocket, hoping to see Sherlock's name however once again it was filled with nothing more than multiple texts from Rosie complaining about her day.
"Yes"
"Jesus John, talk about blunt"
"Get out" John flushed, slightly aroused and bewildered like every time Sherlock would attempt to be...
Rosie was about to walk away when Sherlock called after her "Don't spend ages on the phone or you'll waste all your minutes before the end of the month"
"Yeah, you are. Would you like a drink? Water, right? Or do you fancy something else?"
"Oh, am I? What were you expecting, Sherlock? You have allowed this friendship of yours with John to remain a friendship for years, you have never allowed yourself to reveal the feelings you have and now he's getting married and you, well, you are panicking - because, finally, you're realising that it's all over"
"Did you really need security?" A voice spoke, not much different from their own enemy, in fact, quite similar - yet the tone was different. "It's a nice place this, very fitting, isn't it?"
"Things aren't that easy" John admitted, sighing into his hands as his head fell. He leant up, his chin resting on the palm of his hands, his eyes still gazed on Sherlock's.
And with that, she jumped up from her seat on the sofa and practically fled from the living room, her exciting squeals still heard as she ran up the stairs with her phone in hand.
"I-" Sherlock starts and stops again, swallowing as he looked at the teenage girls eyes full of hope and need from him. He wanted to refuse to talk about it without John here but he knew she was desperate. He sighed, patting the seat beside him "come sit with me"
"I'm not letting you come home. You're perfectly fine, you're not being sick, you have not got a high temperature and you're not dying. So, why on earth would you need to come home?"
"Nothing" He snapped again, his steps coming to a halt as he pulled his dressing gown over his chest.
"How on earth were you at a loss?"
"Of course I do, Sherlock comes back and now we're all under attack. I know the bloody routine now, Mycroft" John spat, looking up as Sherlock ran past him and up the stairs. "It's Moriarty isn't it? His brother?"
"My brother had only one goal in his life, to destroy you and everyone you loved - he then passed that goal onto me"
had used"
Was Rosie going to get too excited? Was Sherlock going to get annoyed? Was he going to be rude? Would he try and impress her? Will they get along? Constant questions swirling round his head, it was enough to drive him insane.
"Which pair?" He asked, looking down at her feet that were covered by a pair of socks which, if he wasn't wrong, were covered in marijuana plants "Jesus, Rosie, what on earth is on your socks?"
"I used to" He shrugged "I don't really know, I was fed up of waiting for Sherlock to come back and eventually thought that leaving would make it easier. At least then I wouldn't be reminded of him everywhere I went"
"I can't tell you why, John. It's not something I'm quite used to - she just seems to find comfort in me, I don't know why"
He had two hours, two hours to get ready and get himself to the church to accompany his best friend on the supposed biggest day of his life and he couldn't even force himself to go for a shower, even move from his paced steps - he was beyond himself, he had noted his breathing and how it had changed dramatically the more he thought of the situation, he had also noted how he was sweating from his palms - nerves? No, why should he be nervous? All he had to do was deliver some meaningless speech and that was as good as it got. He had no need to be nervous - there was only deduction, one he did not like admit lightly.
"Yes, very well, fair point" Sherlock quickly corrected himself "he soon believed me"
"Sherlock" John groaned, it was supposed to come as a plead, a plead for anything, he just needed something from him.
"Very" Mrs H nodded in agreement, taking a sip of her tea. Her eyes were drifting between John and the clock and John had caught onto this, he had forgotten all about Greg coming.
"Jesus, Rosie. When on earth did you go to sleep last night?"
They both did as told, Rosie left shortly after in a huff that her best friend and dads boy friend had betrayed her like that, leaving another John and Sherlock in the kitchen.
"Oh, no, that was Molly's husband" John spoke casually, swinging his legs "he came to pick up Molly's coat, she left it here"
"You don't miss a thing, do you?" John laughed, turning to look at Sherlock with a smile, he joined him, sitting in the seat beside him and reached his hand out onto his thigh. He felt Sherlock's hand grab his, lacing his fingers through his own. "Well, yes, I suppose we are rather official, I guess. I suppose that happens when you nearly face death, well, it did this time anyway"
"Yes, well, I feel the same" Mrs Hudson laughed, her care-free, infectious laughed, that John would have missed so dearly. "Oh well, life goes on and all that tosh. Mycroft told me that you two have finally made this official, it's wonderful, who would have thought? You were so persistent that you weren't interested in Sherlock, John, I saw right through you"
"You mean, to meet the man who has solved hundreds upon hundreds of crimes? The man who can tell you your life story just from looking at you? And the man who was my dads best and most dearest friend for so long? What do you think?"
He laughed lightly to himself, turning his attention back to his thumbs as they began a reply.
John nodded, turning to Rosie who was still stood, slightly hiding behind him.
And John nodded, he said his goodbyes and his I love you and he did exactly that. His steps were slower this time as he walked down the stairs, he knew what he was about to place himself into and he knew it could go two ways. But he also knew he needed to do this and it needed to be now.
Moriartydefence
"Too bad" The voice was obvious "I'm afraid, you have a few problems"
"Oh, brother mine, please do stop acting so bloody childish and reevaluate this situation. Surely you don't think this is a good idea? No person with a right mind would find this idea even remotely worth the effort or time"
"Jesus, John" Sherlock cringed, his free hand reaching to cover his eyes "no need to be so blunt"
"Very well, understandable"
John was truly losing his mind - he was almost beginning to believe that Sherlock's confession was some spiteful experiment somehow, that he did it all to examine how he would react to it all or something awful like that.
"On the day of John's wedding? Surprisingly not. What I mean, is why on earth have you let this go on for this long" She said firmly, crossing her arms over her chest as she leant back against the sofa.
"Well, seeing as you know me so well, John Watson" Sherlock began, inching forward to mimic John "can you please tell me why I always come back for you?"
"He always says that, don't believe him" Mrs H winked at Rosie before she turned around and head back into her kitchen.
"Yes, well, he made it perfectly clear that he didn't want to be found" John's voice flurried with bitterness.
"Ah, simple. We're going to eat lunch, then we will all go our separate ways - we will meet up once maybe twice a month, as mandatory when involving yourself with
"Because - well, I'm his best friend, it's different. It took him a long time to settle with me, you have to remember that" John tried to explain, poorly.
"Right" She nodded, not believing it for a even a second. "You know, you don't have to act any different around me. I'm not fussed"
"Ah, touché" Mycroft grinned, he loved when someone would battle his intelligence "- I also mean, you're very brave for allowing Sherlock back into your life so easily. I'm not doubting you at all, John, in fact, I'm praising you. My brother is difficult, for years he has battled with his humanity and yet, with you, he's human - you are able to defeat the demon"
"you bloody what?" John asked, his eyes wide as he leant against the kitchen counter with his phone to his ear "Jesus, are you trying to get social services involved? Don't tell people that, Rosie"
Reply was instant.
"sorry, I got over excited. Anyway, all of my friends are so jealous. My maths teacher spent the whole hour just asking me questions about you both, she was a huge fan during the
"Right" John finally exhaled, slowly removing his hand from Sherlock's thigh "I see"
"Is this okay?" Sherlock asked, placing his hand firmly on John's hip.
"I am a dad" John challenged.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, not turning around from where he was brewing tea in the kitchen "I told you, Mycroft. There was no need to arrest the man, he is simply mislead and hurting, he needs help not a jail cell"
"I-" he stopped, thinking about the situation, he had done everything in his power to prevent him from returning to that house at all costs. Usually offering to meet at restaurants and cafes rather than there. But he knew that it wasn't going to last forever and he most definitely couldn't hide forever "okay, I'll meet you there. What time?"
"I think now is better, yes, definitely. It will... Stimulate my brain" Sherlock attempted an explanation.
There was only ever one or the other with him.
"Come on dear, you need to speak to me" Mrs Hudson spoke firmly this time, now lowering herself to sit beside him on the sofa. Sherlock hadn't even noticed, he didn't consider what he must look like - a incoherent mess, shaking back and forth on the sofa like a mad man.
"They don't deserve an answer, they're simply strangers who fixated on two random men who solved crimes. They're nobody to me. I have given my answer to you and that's all what matters"
"I'll note that. For next time"
John let out a breathy chuckle, nodding as he took a sip of his own - the whole situation was blissful, beyond blissful, it was lovely. Neither would have seen themselves sitting here, especially after the events of the day before. In fact, both were equally convinced that it would have lead into fatality. But to be sat here, it was pure luck - utterly wonderful luck and John couldn't have been more content.
"Yes but, she came with me that day. That bullet was made for me, not her, I can never forgive myself for that"
"No, John" Sherlock faintly interrupted, this time turning his head finally to seek John's eyes. "It's not that"
"Oh? Why is that?"
"I'm sure they'd love to hear about the heartless detective who fled from London to save the heart of his best friend" John joked lightly.
"Oh, your standard classroom bin, not too big"
And at that moment, John couldn't fathom the words to say, an urge took ahold of him like it possessed his once calm and stable body.
"So, she's not... you know, upset?"
"You should never do something you're unsure about, you could live to regret it" John said, a sympathetic smile across his lips, he could see the pain in Craig's eyes "- you've already hurt one of our friends, part of our family actually"
"To abandon your daughter to fight a man who most likely wants both yours and my brothers head on a stake, marvellous, really. Who knew you still had it in you?"
"Okay, alright, fine" Sherlock nodded, composing himself until he was sat straight, almost bringing the inner detective out.
"She always rings at inconvenient times. Mainly at three in the bloody morning" he defended.
"We always knew she would be, John. She's a fighter, she's been through more than all of us compared" Sherlock spoke softly, a slight sigh falling from his lips as he stood up.
"Shit" Sherlock gasps beneath him and John is filled with utter lust for the younger detective, but he contains himself, keeping his attention purely on pleasing him - he had never done this to another man before, but as he continues he finds new ways to make him writhe below him, how to make his body twitch in response. His hand working where he couldn't reach, his mouth slipping over his cock as though he needed it, he did, really, he needed to hear him release, needed to see this - and so he did, he continued until he felt Sherlock's legs begin to shake against his own legs, until his fingers had such a lock on his hair that it could have pulled a clump out and then, all at once, he heard an array of swear words escape Sherlock's mouth in the most lustful and beautiful sense of the words and then he released himself into John's mouth, his eyes rolling into the back of his head and his body falling limp beneath him.
"People have been waiting for your return Sherlock, they'll want answers eventually"
"Oh" Sherlock's lips tightened into a thin line, his eyebrows furrowing like they always did when he thought hard "Mike Stamford. I see. He's nice, although I'm not sure how he would cope with-"
"That's not at all-"
"What a day" John sighed, rolling onto his back "it wasn't the same as it used to be"
"I can promise you, John, I am not going anywhere. I'm here, I'm staying. You can trust me. If I have you, then I would never be able to bare even a day without"
"She's okay" John spoke through a heavy breath, his face falling into his hands. "God, she scared me half to death"
"Oh dear, maybe you being here wasn't such a good idea"
"Strange, isn't it?" Sherlock challenged, his eyes flickering over the apartment "to be back"
"When I kissed you? You liked it"
"Yes, well, for all we know. He could be"
He spent the next few hours doing nothing, he had used up as much time as he could to just sit on the sofa and be as lazy as possible, it was a rare occasion that he would get a day to himself, in fact, it was the first day he'd managed to get off work for months.
"We take this slow" John confirmed, nodding his head mainly to himself as he processed it "what happened the other day was far too quick. From now on, if you want this, you need to prove to me that you do. This isn't just an experiment Sherlock Holmes, this is our life and our future together. If you want me and I mean truly want me, then you have to work for it"
The voices grow clearer, more distinct and it seems there are two people laughing darkly while another mutters a frustrated curse. John peeks around the corner, his back flat against the brick of the castle and he reaches in the front pocket of his robes for his wand. He was right, there are two Slytherin’s, a boy and girl, standing together conspiratorially, and – his stomach lurches as he recognizes the other boy immediately, currently hanging upside down, suspended in midair by his ankle. It’s Sherlock, the Ravenclaw from his Potions class and John realizes the jinx he’s been hit with instantly, based on the effects.
John uses the counter-jinx and he winces as Sherlock hits the ground unceremoniously. “You okay?” He asks, holding out his hand to help Sherlock back up. Sherlock looks at John’s offered hand as though it’s something entirely foreign, like he has no idea why it’s there or what he’s intended to do with it. His eyes move up to meet John’s apprehensively despite the fact that John just came to his aid.
“Boys, you have a client,” John hears Mrs. Hudson, their landlady, a sweet Hufflepuff woman John has come to care greatly about, call from downstairs as the front door slams shut. The tea has just finished brewing and John flicks his wand in the direction of the kitchen where a tray with two hot cups of tea comes floating down towards the living room.
The words rain down on him like cold water and his body goes still, mouth still open at Sherlock’s neck. He pulls back slowly, just enough to meet Sherlock’s eyes, his hands falling away from where they were tangled in Sherlock’s hair. They’re both still catching their breaths, panting, and John is still standing close enough that he can feel every one of Sherlock’s exhales against his lips. He looks down to Sherlock’s mouth and the sight of his perfect lips, so full and sharp with that enticing cupid’s bow now swollen and tinged pink from John’s kisses just makes him want to dive in again and capture Sherlock’s mouth with his own.
“It’s me.” The tension in John’s body deflates as he recognizes Sherlock’s deep baritone voice, even in a whisper.
He feels like he’s experiencing one of Sherlock’s deductions when it suddenly hits him that he and Sherlock are in fact at a gay bar. Sherlock still has his hands on John’s hips and John is leaning back into his body and shit,
look at Sherlock because he knows that if he so much as glances at him and sees an increment of what he feels on Sherlock’s face, John would positively lose it.
John watches as Sherlock takes in the image on the box with a perplexed look on his face (it’s not a common expression for Sherlock and John finds that he enjoys his confusion immensely). “Is this some kind of muggle device?”
“We’re fine here, thanks,” John gives the man a tight smile, resisting the urge to politely tell him to bugger off.
John can’t get over the fact that the Ravenclaws need to solve a puzzle every time they want to enter their own room.
“I had no idea either,” Sherlock echoes. “When I told you I was married to my work, I didn’t know that anything could rival how important that was to me. But you did. You became fundamental, you were everywhere, John. It’s like I couldn’t function without you anymore.” John can’t help it; he bends down to catch Sherlock’s lips between his own, the kiss sweet and tender and hopeful.
interested. Just not in him.
“Well… you will have the whole castle to yourselves over Christmas break, so that’d be a great time to throw yourself at him.”
They spend practically every waking moment together. Now that the rest of the school is gone, they can have meals together, and with no classes they have no reason to separate. John finds that he’s entirely okay with that and Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind either. They continue their potions experiments of course, and retrieve needed ingredients when necessary, but Sherlock sticks around when John needs to catch up on work from his other classes and John often observes as Sherlock tries out new, complicated spells neither of them need to know for their courses. They even go as far as sneaking each other into their respective common rooms. Visiting common rooms other than your own houses isn’t allowed but because there isn’t anyone around, they get away with it.
As much as John hates to admit it, Greg isn’t all that wrong. The break might be the perfect time to broach the subject and see if his feelings for Sherlock are… more than one-sided. John can’t deny that his feelings for Sherlock border on more than friendship, but he isn’t sure if he’s ready to give up Sherlock altogether if he doesn’t feel the same way. That’s usually what happens, right? When one person admits to developing feelings in a friendship, everything about the relationship dynamic changes, every word and action becomes laden with a new layer of meaning and expectations, and usually the relationship either evolves into something romantic or dies altogether. He doesn’t want to lose Sherlock, not when he’s just found him. Then again, his feelings for Sherlock seem to be growing deeper every day, with every interaction they have, John finds himself falling just a little bit further. He isn’t sure if he can go on suppressing those feelings, resisting the urge to brush his hand against Sherlock’s and intertwining their fingers, to tuck a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead behind his ear, or kiss him when he deduces something absolutely brilliant.
Hi y'all, sorry for the wait on the update, this week was a bit crazy, but here is chapter two. One more to go after this one! I'd love to know what you think.
“So how do you want to do this?” John’s a doctor, he knows the mechanics, he just wants to make sure Sherlock is comfortable, that it’s as good for him as it’s bound to be for John.
“Right, yes, you can have this one.” Sherlock isn’t used to having anyone sit beside him – most students either have seating partners already or are just keen to avoid him – and he moves his things over to make space for John.
The room seems to disappear between them, only John and Sherlock remain as the chaos of the club fades to nothingness. The music dies out in his ears, the heavy lights stop being so blinding as he focuses exclusively on Sherlock, holding his gaze, and John can feel the blood rushing in his veins, his pulse rapid and loud, thudding against his skin and he lets himself get lost in the vast ocean of Sherlock’s eyes. They gravitate towards one another, both like moths drawn to a flame, bodies tethered together by a magnetic pull. John almost feels like he has no choice in the matter, like this moment is beyond his control, like it’s bigger than him: it’s
Sherlock notices John is the one blushing now. His insides flutter at the sight. “Right, so when are you free then?” John asks as they make their way out of the dungeon, climbing the stairs side by side.
“Simple observations and deductions,” he downplays his abilities and John shakes his head, still smiling and unbelieving.
“You’re a freak!” He hears the shouting again, and he can make out the words this time as he gets closer, followed by the sizzling crack of a spell and some sniggering. He should really just keep walking, but he feels something tugging at his insides and before he’s even made a conscious decision, he changes direction, following the voices on his right.
The blonde man finally takes the hint, a scowl etched across his face at Sherlock’s blatant dismissal, downs his drink in one long swig and turns his back to them, walking away in the opposite direction. John glares at his back for a few seconds, watching as he disappears into the thick crowd of people, but he’s soon distracted by the enticing smell of Sherlock’s hair, clean and familiar. He’s suddenly reminded of how close they are. Sherlock’s back is completely plastered to John’s front, their fingers intertwined on Sherlock’s waist and John’s nose is brushing behind Sherlock’s right ear. John breathes in and even in the middle of a bar where the smell of beer is so prominent, his senses are hyper aware of Sherlock’s distinct aroma, his musky shampoo and that prestigious aftershave he dabs onto his neck and cheeks.
“Nothing, I just couldn’t stand going another second without kissing you. I lost control for a second and my body just took over,” John doesn’t know how else to explain it.
, he’s wondered about the taste of Sherlock’s lips for so long, he nearly whimpers at the thought that this is finally happening. He’s kissing Sherlock Holmes and it’s like nothing he’s ever felt before.
“Oh no, not me. I wouldn’t miss my Mum’s Christmas pudding for anything in the world. But your new Potions partner should be here.”
“Really?” John asks, surprised. He’d just about convinced himself Sherlock hated it. “You’re not just saying that? It’s okay if you don’t like it.”
By the time Snape comes by their table, both he and John have successfully added the last of the ingredients and both their potions look just as they should. Snape eyes John almost skeptically, as though he’d expected him to fail. For some reason, that doesn’t sit well with Sherlock.
“John,” Sherlock breathes out his name and shit, that does nothing to help the raging erection he can’t seem to control. John continues kissing Sherlock’s neck, laving over the sharp ridge of his collarbone when Sherlock’s hands tighten at John’s back, only this time he’s pulling him away. “John, stop.”
"What I mean, brother dearest, is if you miss him so much why wouldn't you just call him? Why do you have to see him?"
Sherlock Holmes is her Godfather, you know?"
"Ah, takes after her mother you see"
"I like her very much" He repeated his earlier statement.
"Sherlock" John warned, letting the hand that was pinching at his nose to fall to his side. "I have no idea what's going on at the minute. I am confused, so fucking confused, in fact, I am beyond that, I'm bloody frustrated, especially with you, you git"
"And what about, Sherlock?" Greg asked.
"I beg your pardon?"
John could feel the shivers that ran down his back, his eyes gazing at the man in front of him - visibly younger than Moriarty, his hair still the same jet black, his eyes though, a piercing witch-like green and a beard much like Mycroft's when they decided to be pirates for the day, less ginger, more natural, brown. He was dressed down, made a change from the tailored suits, he was dressed in a pair of jeans and a checked shirt much like one that John had at home, very similar in fact. He looked - normal. Much beyond expectations.
" he says gesturing between the two of them "is going to be a thing, then I don't think I can bare to lose you - not again"
"Indeed"
His eyes widened, his body stiffening as he sat up straight, looking at his feet where Sherlock was sat on his knees, his eyes peering over the desks, firmly towards the swinging doors.
"That's life I'm af-" before he could continue the line cut off, he sniggered go himself watching the call drop. He had no time to worry about her today.
"It's okay" John cooed as if he was soothing a pained child "It's going be okay"
"I don't know, maybe because you two were walking around London in the middle of the day? You really are stupid sometimes. Anyway, you're the biggest news right now"
"Bi-Sexual, I think. I'm not sure, she definitely had a thing for Sherlock though. They're most likely laughing away together about how truly pathetic I am to have believe a word he said"
"Oh, no, no. I'm actually about to head home, Craig is taking me out for dinner tonight. It's our wedding anniversary, not that either of you would know that, considering neither of you attended my wedding"
"And you will, when your father feels it right"
"You say that now - but, what if she thinks I'm replacing her mother? I would hate for her to think that"
"I promised your daughter, don't you worry that pretty little head of yours" Sherlock winked, leaning back to rest his arms on the back of the sofa and if John wasn't so worried he would have described him as god-like as he sat there, he could still admire him from a distance without admitting it, of course.
"But if only you could have allowed me in a-"
"God" Sherlock's breath hitched as he caught glance of his doctor, noting the scars across his chest and shoulder, noting the struggle that this beautiful man had dealt with and he was so in love "You're fucking beautiful"
"Yes, I do. We simply ignore it"
"You were the one who suggested we watched every Harry Potter film at eight last night"
I'll be posting 1/2 chapters every two days, there may be some delay if I am working or can't find the time but I'll let you know on my tumblr - Moriartydefence or if you follow me on twitter just send me a dm @text_larry :)
"Sherlock, you're going to have to tell me, I can't read your bloody mind" John pushed, his hands falling to his side.
"Hey" John said with a forced smile, shuffling his jacket off and leaning it against the banister of the stairs "how was school?"
He was a mere few steps from him, his heart racing, Sherlock still staring at the wall - that was until John's smaller hands snaked around onto his waist, his finger tips brushing the material of his shirt until they had reached around to meet together in front of his chest, his fingers lacing through one another to hold him in a tight grip - he could feel Sherlock stiffen in his arms, yet he stayed, for a minute or two until Sherlock softened around him and soon, a deep breathe escaped him.
Sherlock was incoherent, his eyes became frantic as he took in the situation he was currently in and all he could possibly do was nod his head, a very faint "please" escaping his lips as he did.
"No yoga, just me, being away made me realise a few things. Much to my brothers annoyance, he too believes that it's time for me to stop"
"I do, not entirely, as I will never understand what was going through that idiotic brain but I'd rather not waste time with the hassle of holding a grudge against you for a few months. Seems useless"
- the only words to describe how they were feeling, a once familiar feeling now nothing but the worst. They were once used to bad situations and dangerous problems but they had never been in a situation that had put their beloved Mrs Hudson into such an awful situation and that was the worst feeling possible.
"I didn't abandon her, I simply took her away from an extremely dangerous situation - you would have done the same, that being if you were ever capable of loving or even advancing on another human being"
"You look like you've been in a war zone, Mrs H and trust me, I should know" John lightly teased, taking a sip of his wine.
"You had a heart this time" John noted, reaching up to rub his eyes "do you see how much it helps? When you have emotion? You understand so much more from their point of view, don't you think?"
"What in hell have you two bloody boys done to that kitchen?" Mrs Hudson shouted, waving her hands around as she walked towards them both.
"Oh, blame me, why don't you?" Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning to Rosie with a smirk "I actually suggested we turned them off at around one this morning however your daughter convinced me to believe you had said it was okay"
He felt Mrs Hudson lift from the bed, her footsteps nearing the doorway to his bedroom and then he heard her "Good decision".
"Not yet" John shook his head, his lips turning with an amused smile as his eyes never left Sherlock's "but I think this will be a good one"
"I have been dealing with a lot of new emotions and feelings as of lately, in fact, they have all been attacking my mind one by one - almost, taking over my whole being" Sherlock sighed, holding onto the inevitable tears that were attempting to drive their way out "it's just, I can honestly say, I have never felt so much pain and hurt in my entire existence"
John turned, watching as Sherlock paced back and forth with excitement, his navy shirt open as his long fingers attempted the buttons.
"The best man"
"That's correct" Sherlock added in "I'll burn them, then you'll never get to see that decapicated head I told you about"
"In the past two weeks you've managed to come back and be someone completely new, you've done flowers and chocolates, dates in the living room, attempted to cook, surprised me, told me you loved me and managed to be my daughters best friend - please tell me this isn't just a stupid investigation or something"
Instant reply, once again.
"Maybe, if you didn't stay up till godly hours of the morning, you wouldn't be so bloody tired all the time" John retaliated, leaning against the counter.
"I mean, come on John, don't make me say it so bluntly. I mean, after the whole leaving your wedding before you even got married sort of thing"
"Water is fine"
"Very well" Sherlock shrugged, this time, he sat back on his heels, his hands gripping the waist of John's jeans and pulling them down in one swift movement and then his finger tips crawled beneath the waistline of his thin boxers, his eyes peered up at John, Sherlock took a deep breath and then pulled them down to reach the jeans.
"I'm glad to see you're not deceased" Sherlock simply said, taking a step back until his feet hit the back of the chair and fell onto it.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, standing to his feet attempting not to show any sort of affection towards his brother and his new found love. "You're very aware of what's to come Sherlock, I hope that the two of you won't become to distracted when the game is at hand"
"That's thanks to you"
He looked around the flat once more, noticing the fine details that concluded that Sherlock really was real and they were, slowly, fading away into the dust, much like the memory of him.
"Not surprising - all murderers enjoy telling others of their 'victims' and their death, it's a malicious joy for them"
"Mycroft" Sherlock's voice alerted John, his eyes finally looking up to see Mycroft and other officials standing around him.
"I fell"
"His name is Craig Moriarty"
They remained like that until they reached the hospital, Sherlock threw whatever money he could find in his pocket in direction of the driver and directed John out of the taxi. They remained hand in hand, walking into the hospital together - Sherlock practically pulled John in, knowing that he wouldn't have coped alone.
"Well, considering you are no longer running havoc on the streets, I saw no need to monitor you any longer, clearly that was a bad decision"
"Not the time John" Sherlock shook his head with a fond smile, they both instantly hid their smiles as they heard the footsteps along the corridor towards them.
"My brother said you were fun, you were always interesting, that's why he liked playing with you so much - I've been watching you since you returned, Mr Holmes, you have not been at all fun. House warming parties, dates, cosy nights in, blah, blah, blah - boring!"
"Oh, John. Not you too. Please, save me the headache"
John took a deep breath, his hand on the handle "Sherlock, we're here" he pushed the door open and stepped in, noting how much fresher it smelt, as though he had just sprayed air freshener at that very moment before he walked in. He gazed up, looking at Sherlock who was sat in his chair, his fingers twiddling on his lap as he looked at John with a look that could only be described as worry.
"Not today. Not now" He frowned, shaking his head "I can't... I'm sorry, I have a wedding. If you would like to come, you are still welcome, I would love to have you there"
John doesn’t know why Sherlock signs all of his notes when it’s obvious who sent them (who else would be inviting him over to the Ravenclaw common room?) but he finds it oddly endearing. Filled with giddy energy, John shoots out of bed. He and Sherlock hadn’t made any actual plans for Christmas day, but he’s glad it isn’t going to be an exception and that they’d probably end up spending most of their time together. Besides, he’s excited to give Sherlock his present. He isn’t sure how Sherlock will react to it: he’ll either hate it or love it and John hopes to God it’s the latter. Still in his pyjamas, he grabs his wand and the neatly wrapped present and rushes out of the dormitory, towards where he now knows to be the Ravenclaw common room.
“Right,” the young man seems to accept Sherlock’s explanation, but he’s still looking at the both of them with too much suspicion for John’s liking. “You should let the bartender know you’re getting married then, he’ll get you up on that stage for a proper celebration.”
He’s never ached for anyone so badly.
He did not just think that. Nope. He’s clearly losing his mind. John shakes himself, willing his brain to cooperate and stop bombarding him with images of Sherlock, beneath him and pinned to his mattress. This is so not okay. John has had very vivid dreams in the past involving he and his roommate in very compromising positions, but he’d always chalked those down to his own libido and inability to get laid to take the edge off. He spends so much time with Sherlock day in and day out, it seems only natural his brain would subconsciously involve Sherlock in his fantasies. It’s entirely normal and doesn’t have to mean anything. He just didn’t expect his subconscious lust for Sherlock to take over so aggressively the moment his mind was loosened by alcohol with Sherlock at such close proximity.
“Alright,” John agrees, and Sherlock is still so flustered he doesn’t remember what John is agreeing to. “I’ll accept your help with potions,
, John has to fight back the sudden urge to wrap his arms around him in a tight hug. “Come on, up we go then,” John says resolutely, and he takes Sherlock’s hand – strictly for efficiency purposes, he reasons – to pull him towards the last pub on Sherlock’s mad list. Only he doesn’t drop Sherlock’s hand as they make their way towards their last stop, and he finds himself relishing in the warmth of Sherlock’s fingers around his own, the way short circuits of electricity fire through his veins stemming from every place their hands are connected, right from the very tips of his fingers and up the entire length of his arm.
“Hey, what’s been going on with you?” He startles at the sound of Greg’s voice as he catches up with John who’d sprung for the door as soon as Miss Sprout had dismissed them. “You’ve been jumpy these last few days, even distracted during Quidditch.”
What the hell?
They both walk to the front of the class to collect the ingredients specified in their textbooks, not that Sherlock needs to look, he’s already successfully brewed this potion before more than once. This would be fairly simple.
He wants everything, his mind is spinning with it, with the innumerable amount of possibilities, all the things they could do, and he wants them all with Sherlock. But Sherlock is right, he needs to decide on one, just for tonight. What if they only had tonight? He knows – he’s hoping he didn’t read too much into Sherlock’s ‘next time’ – that they’ll have time for all the other things, but if this was it, if all he got was one night with Sherlock, he thinks he would want-
“Mean what?”
“Inside you,” he breathes out the words, tongue heavy in his mouth as Sherlock laves at his left nipple. “I want to be inside you.” Sherlock stops, his head snapping up to meet John’s gaze, eyes dark and wild.
not about to put on a show. When he looks back, he notices Sherlock looking around, his gaze eyeing the patrons of the establishment suspiciously, and John can practically see Sherlock’s mind at work, sorting through muddled deductions as he attempts to make sense of his surroundings and come to a conclusion.
“Wouldn’t you regret it?” Sherlock avoids his eyes now and John realizes he’s giving him an out, an opportunity to go back to his fiancé, back to the life he was about to begin with her. He doesn’t want it.
Sherlock nods a bit shyly, and John thinks it’s probably the most endearing thing he’s ever seen, certainly not an adjective he’d ever thought he’d use to refer to Sherlock, but somehow it makes John want him even more. There’s so much he still doesn’t know. They are best friends and they still have so much to uncover about one another, and John is so grateful, the feeling gripping him so tight he loses his breath.
“Not particularly,” he answers truthfully, he’s quite certain he’ll get an “O” for Outstanding in most of his classes, no matter how dreadfully boring they are. His answer makes John laugh and something warm spreads through Sherlock’s stomach at the sound. What is
Sherlock’s gaze lands straight on the gift in John’s hands. He had nowhere to hide the present he’d brought Sherlock, the box quite big and heavy so he just offers it over. “I got you something,” John explains, cursing his body as he feels his cheeks warm again. Damn it, why does he react like an impressionable first year whenever he’s around Sherlock? It’s infuriating.
“I can’t believe we’ve never been here before, it’s quite something,” John says, loud enough for the blonde to hear and he’s aware the other man is watching him with narrowed eyes, like he’s just stolen his prize.
“Shut it,” John feels his cheeks heating and Greg laughs, enjoying himself far too much for John’s liking.
They take the quickest route down to Hagrid’s, walking down the path as the sun sets behind the castle and John feels his heart begin to pump faster as the curfew time approaches, knowing full well they won’t be back in their respective dormitories by then. Then again, maybe his elevated heartrate has more to do with the fact that his hand brushes the back of Sherlock’s a few times as they follow the narrow path side by side and Sherlock doesn’t seem to mind or pull his hand back.
Shit,
Thank you so much to everyone who read, left kudos, or left comments, you have no idea how much it means to me. I'd love to know what you thought of Part 2 ;)
, that has no business feeling
And now they’re here, they’ve
someone, he’s not about to tell Greg that. He kind of wants to keep Sherlock all to himself for now, especially since he has no bloody clue whether or not Sherlock would even be interested in… anyone, least of all him. Yeah, probably best to keep things on the downlow for now.
It was perfectly obvious why John was in the area at that particular time: he’d been on the fastest route to the Quidditch pitch from the Astronomy tower having just finished with Divination (Sherlock had noticed the books John had been carrying at the time, the deduction had been child’s play). It’s also obvious that John had overheard Donovan and Anderson, they had been less than subtle in their glee to have gotten the drop on Sherlock, a feat they’d been attempting to pull for months.
John looks over to Sherlock and back at the instructions in his book, confused. “Really? It doesn’t say so in the textbook.”
The cab ride feels endless. They truly should have walked. John’s sure they’d already be back on Baker Street by now if they’d gone on foot, not to mention the walk would probably have done wonders to calm the ever-growing storm of emotions raging inside him. He feels like he’s about to go mad.
Everyone knows who Sherlock Holmes is: probably the most talented wizard Hogwarts has seen in years, excels in pretty much every course, a positively brilliant Ravenclaw, and honestly John is surprised average wizards like Anderson and Donovan managed to get the drop on him. But it seems his talent is also a curse and possibly why most of the school hates him, John suspects, out of pure jealousy. Then again, Sherlock’s sharp tongue also doesn’t help; he’s known for being cold and unforgiving.
John is panting, still catching his breath when Sherlock tugs at his hair and he forces himself up from the floor, only noticing for the first time the twinge of discomfort in his knees, but he doesn’t mind it so much: not if it’s the cost of seeing Sherlock like this, so open and sated and somehow still hungry for him.
John nods. “I’ll see you around then.” The corner of his mouth lifts up in a shy smile and he turns his back to Sherlock, walking towards the field. John groans internally for having been so damn
. Yes, next time we can experiment,” John agrees, probably with a bit too much enthusiasm, Sherlock kissing a path down his chest and god, he can barely catch his breath. “Anything you want.” He doesn’t care what Sherlock wants to experiment, so long as it involves the two of them doing something that assuredly leads to
. Even if he could control it, he doesn’t think he’d make any kind of move to stop it. John’s hand moves up of its own accord, reaching out to drape at Sherlock’s right hip and Sherlock moves in too, long fingers spreading forward and up, until John can feel the ghost of a touch at his cheek. John thinks he sighs, though it’s likely no one hears in the middle of the club dance floor, and his eyes close of their own volition, head tilting into Sherlock’s touch-
“Right,” John agrees with a shy smile, as though he didn’t think what he’d done for Sherlock was a big deal.
, it’s everything John has been dreaming about for weeks. They kiss until they both run out of breath, giving and taking in tandem, like a waltz they’ve perfected over years of practice, like their bodies are perfectly attuned to one another. When Sherlock breaks the kiss for oxygen, John’s head is spinning. He’s dizzy with it, with Sherlock, the taste of his mouth, the feel of his hands in his hair, and the knowledge that Sherlock apparently wants him just as much as John does.
“I hope you both have been working on your atrocious shielding charms, because I assure you, you’ll regret this,” Sherlock mutters, his face growing red now from hanging upside down for the last few minutes.
“Oh god, oh fuck, Sherlock,” he moans, pleasure gripping him so tight his head spins and it’s a genuine effort not to come on the spot. John’s upper body falls forward, his palms landing next to Sherlock’s head on the mattress and they just breathe each other in, their faces mere inches apart. John dips his head and kisses him, messy and wet and uncoordinated but it’s everything,
Shit. John shakes his head, willing his drunken mind to stay away – far,
He opens his mouth to ask, to get reassurance but all that comes out is: “That was incredible.”
John knows he shouldn’t, knows there was a reason he was staring out the window and keeping his eyes, far, far away from the one thing on his mind, but he can’t help it, he turns and sneaks a look at Sherlock.
Sherlock takes his hand off his mouth once he’s certain John won’t be making any noise to give them away and moves it to lay on the bark, beside John’s head. They’re incredibly close, Sherlock practically boxing him in against the tree as they wait for Hagrid and Fang to get back into the house before they can sneak back up to the castle. John feels his heart pounding against his sternum, but the stress of getting caught has mostly worn off by now and he thinks his elevated heartrate has more to do with Sherlock’s proximity, the way John can feel the long lines of Sherlock’s body against his, how every puff of Sherlock’s breath hits John’s cheek and how it’s the first time their close enough that John notices how good Sherlock smells.
, he remembers that conversation rather well. A little too well. He’d filed away the unexpected feeling of rejection and the sting of Sherlock’s words that night, shoved it to the back of his mind and nearly managed to convince himself he hadn’t felt a thing, that Sherlock had misinterpreted John’s questions as some sort of come on. In time he’d learned it was nothing personal, nothing to do with him. Sherlock just wasn’t interested in anyone. And that was fine. As he’d told Sherlock that same night,
"That was wonderful" Sherlock admitted, turning his head to look at John with the most adorable smile across his face, some sort of wildly adorable embarrassment sweeping over him, as though what they had done shouldn't have been so lovely considering how dirty it really was.
"Do you? Do you really? Because you didn't seem to care much all those years ag- wait, was bloody Lestrade involved in this as well? Jesus fucking Christ, did everyone know about this but me?"
And Sherlock left, leaving John gobsmacked, his mouth wide as the door closed behind him.
"Because you care about me, that's what friends do, they care about each other and whether you like it or not, you do care about me. That's why you always come back - to me"
They watched and waited until the three of them had left the room, closing the door behind them. Soon, John turned to Sherlock, he had finally seen the side to Sherlock he knew so well, the stubborn, selfish, egotistic, arse hole that he liked so dearly.
"Can you, I don't know, refrain from the pda when around me?" Rosie scowled.
Sherlock and John were silent as they rode the taxi to the hospital, utter silence other than the radio playing dimly in the background and the sound of John's unsteady breath.
"When you say our, you mean you and Sherlock? Wow, Mrs Hudson you're right. They are secretly in love" Rosie giggled, grabbing her jacket from the back of her chair.
"Home, of course"
"Were you friends with my mum?" She asked.
"Right" Sherlock said, his cheeks gleaming a crimson red at the thought "I see. So, what I deduced was correct? The feelings are in fact mutual?"
"Come here" John repeated, tilting his head slightly as he ushered him over.
"I just want to make sure, that's all" He sighed, pouring the milk into the two boiling hot cups of tea that he had freshly made, turning round to look at Sherlock who was sat quietly examining the decor of the kitchen "- I know that you get bored easily and really all we'll be doing is watching a film and eating Chinese food"
That was the only text John had received that day even after spamming Sherlock's phone with practically hundreds of texts asking what exactly it meant. He had spent his entire day at work trying to figure out what he had planned, that was the thing with Sherlock, he was so unexpected. He would either be planning a dinner out or a thorough examination of the dead human body 4 days post death.
"You can deny it as much as you like, John. But eventually you're going to have to admit it"
"Look, I know that you're just trying to help. But, if Sherlock really and I mean really needed me, he would be here. He wouldn't be half way across the sodding world on some stupid assignment he most likely begged his brother for. He'd be here, Mrs H, right here"
They stayed like that, even when the front door opened and they heard John's daughter as she huffed and whined as she shoved her bag and shoes off by the door and even when she stepped towards the living room, they simply stayed where they were.
"John has a daughter, he has been out of this now for years, he does not need to be put in danger purely because you cannot handle a situation yourselves. And I, will once again tell you, I am not inclined to your pathetic case or this pathetic character. It is boring. We have done this once before and I refuse to do it all over again"
"I mean, I'm a real adult now, I'm in my bloody forty's, I have a teenage daughter, an actual, real-life, grown up, mortgage to pay to keep a roof over our heads and a job that I actually have to turn up to every day. It's bloody terrifying"
"Tedious, old people really aren't much fun - the only person that can be specified as old and still be wild, is Mrs Hudson" She shrugged, walking into the room and sitting on the two-seated sofa to the side of them. "- so?"
"Did he say that then?" She challenged.
"Says you? The man who would forgive him no matter what he done. He died for two years and you pretended you were angry for a bit and then went off back up his arse again" Mary shot back, John could still note the humour in her voice.
off" John muttered, rolling his eyes as he sat opposite him on the floor "It just seems like a disaster to go there, you've nearly died there so many times Sherlock - who says this time won't be different?"
"Jeremy Kyle" John huffed out a laugh, turning the sound up a few notches "it really is mind blowing that these people and their situations are real, I'm surprised we haven't had a few clients like this"
"You listened to your bloody brother? You actually went to Mycroft for advice? Jesus, Sherlock that was stupid, even for you"
And Sherlock knew he was about to hate every moment of this movie but as long as he had John, nothing seemed miserable.
"Italian. Not Thai, it's boring" Sherlock simply said, walking ahead, knowing that John would follow in his steps.
"Don't. Please, for the love of god, do not say anything remotely smart or sarcastic at this moment" John was breathless, he closed his eyes for a second, taking a step back. Although Sherlock's arms never left his waist.
"I'm going to leave the room, okay?" She said, mainly to Sherlock who looked at her with such pleading eyes "you need to do this, Sherlock. Or else you'll never know or understand"
"Yes, well, blame your boyfriend"
"Excuse me, I hope you aren't attempting to blame me" Sherlock suddenly waltzed in, he always looked wonderful in the morning.
"Fine" She rolled her eyes, finishing her glass of orange juice before standing "I'm going outside to call Sophie, she'll save me from this love fest"
John's eyes furrowed together, shaking his head slightly "Sorry, what? No Sherlock, for my wedding. For me, I need a best man"
"So, he fought with himself? Like he was fighting his own demons?" John asked.
John soon realised, speaking in short breaths "this was your plan, wasn't it? When you asked to cuddle?"
"Because you're an idiot, deep down" John teased "but, I'm serious. Two best mates don't just do what we did"
"I - yes, yes I'm fine. Why do you ask?" He managed to choke out, inching up in his seat so he was sitting up right.
"So you're having a date?" She asked, looking up at him and tilting her head slightly, her blonde locks falling to the side.
"Fuck, Sherlock go and wake Rosie. We'll drop her off at Harry's, we need to see Mrs H" John shouted, standing to his feet and running out into the hallway to get his shoes.
"I can't use card to pay for the bus, can I?"
Sherlock's eyes furrowed slowly, almost into a glare until he lifted his laptop screen up and focused - his fingers typing away and his eyes fierce - the game was on.
After John had left Sherlock's the night before, he has received not a single text. He maybe assumed that his proposition of him fighting and working for John was something that Sherlock could simply not handle and had most likely turned to drugs or a plane journey to get away from the situation. Or - john was just over reacting, as always.
"Are you certain? As I'm not too sure"
Dedicated to Leah because she's a hoe and gave me the idea for this chapter and don't follow her on twitter but I suppose here's her @chaotiquely
"The Harry Potter films?" John finally asked, hiding his smile beneath his cup "- but you hate fantasy and fiction"
"How long until Rosie returns home?" Sherlock asked, peering over his mug at John.
He looked down at the floor, the space now clear with only a mount of cushions piled against each other, one after the other, candles lit around it, the scent of lavender lifting through the room with every inhale. His eyes scanned the scene, seeing the bottle of wine beside it and two glasses. And then stood behind it with his hands twiddling in front of him and his eyes soft was no one other than Sherlock Holmes. Dressed in an oversized sweater with the sleeves clasped in the palm of his hand and it slightly hanging around his thighs and those jeans he loved so dearly.
"Very" he agreed, looking around the kitchen collecting the fond memories he had shared in here. Remembering the hungover breakfast, listening to Mrs H talk about her husband, drugs and all the sex she had and he had to refrain from bulking just like he did the first time "so, did you ever manage to find another tenant for the room upstairs?"
Sherlock smirked, his eyes still focused on the building in front, however his smirk visible for John to see.
"Have what, Mycroft? Stop babbling like a fool"
Jealous of the woman that was taking his best friend and pulling him from their antics? No. Jealous of the way John loved this woman and loved enough to marry and declare their love for eternity? Yes, a thousand times yes.
"If anything happens to us, John-" Sherlock starts, his voice fragile.
"you're such a spoil sport"
"Was it Mrs Hudson?" she asked, making John come to a standstill. His body froze, he wasn't aware of a time he had mentioned her name to her other than when she was very little.
"How on earth could I have missed this?" He said, taking a step away from John, his finger tips moving to his temple as if he was pushing for some sort of clarification "it can't be, why is it always this? Why do they always victimise her? Oh, of course. He would have told him, told him of her vulnerability- but why go so far? Why go so in depth?"
"Yes, I know you but I can't read minds can-"
"Fuck" John mumbled against his lips, his hands found Sherlock's hair, clenching onto the curly strands of sweet auburn as the light hit it from the window behind them.
"Look at you" she snapped, pulling a chair from the kitchen to sit beside John. She sat down, gazing up and down at him in dissatisfaction "I expected more from you"
He reached his hand up to knock once again, however was interrupted as the door swung open in front of them.
They walked quietly, other than greg letting the others now of the situation, there was quite easily 100 police men and women situated in that building, all waiting and ready - a sight Sherlock once would have frowned at, he hated the police at the best of times but this time he was serious.
"Oh shit, wait, Mrs Hudson, is she okay? Jesus, is she alright? Was she there?" John ran frantic, suddenly sliding off Sherlock's lap to sit beside him "Mycroft, is she okay?"
"My intention was never to hurt you. That was noted in that letter and as for the rest of my life, I intend to stick by that. I'm forever in your debt for the way I have treated you, I will always be sorry for the way I left and the years I missed. However, I am Sherlock Holmes, I do stupid things because frankly, I am incapable of human thought processes and that's always who I will be. And I do not ask for your forgiveness, as I do not expect it. However, I do hope that you can work on a way to allow me to continue being your friend even through the actions I have taken"
"More than anything" She nodded eagerly, inching closer in her chair with a wide smile across her face as though Christmas was coming. Oh how naive she was.
"So, you're telling me that you had a case, a real case after so many years and it was that bloody boring?" She frowned, her question almost as a statement "wow, well, clearly old age is making you both boring - what a let down, can't believe I was so excited to hear about what a great case it was and was let down, rubbish Baker Street boys"
"We couldn't shift them away, I'm afraid. Don't mind them, they wouldn't interfere" Sherlock spoke, his voice firm and bold, showing his dominance, of course, John knew better.
"Yet" Sherlock choked out before turning to Rosie with a smile "So, Rosie, how was school today?"
He couldn't do this. He wanted to do this for John, he wanted to make him happy, to see him smile as he stood beside him at the alter but as the time became nearer, he couldn't bare the thought of watching the man he, adored, marry another - not even Mary.
"So do I" Sherlock muttered under his breath.
"Who knows?" John sighed "- it depends, if he's really concentrating, it could be days"
"I see" was all Mycroft could say.
"is that what you're worried about? That I didn't enjoy it? Bloody hell, Sherlock. If I didn't enjoy it I wouldn't have dropped to my knees for you within minutes of being alone"
"and his next move?"
"Sorry" Sherlock spoke softly, his body turning on John's arms swiftly until he was facing him. He smiled, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him close "I was thinking... I didn't mean, you know, I'm sorry, when I'm thinking I forget that I'm not a lone and-"
She sat down on one of the stools, leaning against the counter as John head for the kettle, reaching to get two cups out of the cupboard.
"I can't, you know I can't"
"You knew your brother was psychotic, you knew that he was struggling and instead of helping him get better, you just allowed him to ruin his life - where the fuck were you?"
"Right - so, research possible deaths through fire?" John cocked an eyebrow, glancing at the laptop.
"I have never let anyone in before, not a single person, never have I felt such a feeling as missing someone, but with you, it's always been different, always. Why is that? It took me twelve years to figure it out, it shouldn't take you as long"
"Yes, actually, you do" Sherlock returned firmly and heading towards the door. "Come along"
"Yes well, I hadn't deduced this" Sherlock frowned, his arms folded over his chest.
"Yes, strange" Sherlock said, his hot breath burning against the skin on John's neck.
"What do you mean?" Sherlock frowned, tilting his slightly.
"I didn't know she was there" He stuttered out "I wasn't aware of her, I didn't check, I didn't know that"
"Really?" John laughed, looking at Mrs Hudson who had a permanent smile across her face "Sure, yeah, why not. Send Molly our love"
"Okay, I didn't introduce you two so you could call me names" John huffed, crossing his arms over his chest.
She looked like she was ready to lose her mind at any moment, not to mention the amount of makeup she was wearing, if John had the balls, he would most definitely have told her to wipe it off but he didn't have the balls of the time.
"Thanks for having us" John spoke, stepping in first and gathering Greg into a hug.
"She's a badass"
"I didn't know we had company" Rosie spoke, looking knowingly at her dad as she walked past him towards the fridge, grabbing a bottle of water out "Are you both staying here this evening or are you buggaring off on some date and forcing me to Aunty Harry's again?"
It didn't change the fact that it was boring but most days were boring now, in fact, every day was boring. It was the same routine, shout at Rosie to get out of bed, have an arguing match because she's lost something, a slammed door, get ready for work, deal with idiotic patients, come home, cook dinner, argue with Rosie because she's had a bad day at school, then continue to argue with her because she's thirteen and can't go out at nine on a school night and then another slammed door and back to bed again.
"It smells fresh in here today" She noted, placing the tray onto the coffee table beside John.
"I just know that it's okay to love whomever you please no matter the gender and I want you to know that I'm okay with whoever you chose. As long as you love them, then that makes me happy. You do deserve happiness too, dad and I'm sorry. I want you to enjoy yourself"
"Do we knock?" Rosie asked as her dad walked ahead of her with his hand already gripped on the door handle.
"He is a human, he's the most human man I know, he is full of emotion, love and care and if anyone is brave, it is him, he's the one who has put all of his love on me and my daughter - he's the brave one here, beyond belief"
"Well, I should mention that your beloved Mrs Hudson has in fact awoken, this morning. She was rather delirious, she remembers the facts of the situation, in fact, she woke asking for you both, so if I were you, I would scurry over before she starts scalding the nurses" He said, nodding another goodbye before finally leaving, his footsteps the only sound left until the front door slammed shut.
"Yes, he's a very intelligent man. But he's not great at people, people he doesn't know"
"I'm just, well, you know, watching the movie"
John nodded, walking over to his own seat, he sat, slightly on the edge so he was a little closer to him. He was still nodding, like a lunatic actually, a strange way to prepare himself for this.
"Which would you prefer?" Sherlock asked, his eyes gazing on the floor as he did.
Since moving back in a month ago, he noted how his glances would no longer attempt to be subtle, he would just sit there, staring blankly - Sherlock never mentioned it, of course, although John had caught Sherlock glancing at him every now and again when he had been staring for a minute too long.
"Hello John"
"What do you expect? She's a teenage girl who's dad is all over the news at the moment"
"All that time?" John asked, his voice full of sympathy.
"I can"
"Is she... I don't... Is she going to be okay?" John stuttered out.
"I, well, Mrs Hudson said I needed to start dressing slightly casual. Said I'm getting too old to be wearing suits all the time and it would show my age and well, yes, I'm dressed like this" He shrugged, his hands twiddling behind his back "however, my suggestion on the shirt is highly recognised. You look wonderful"
"You assume I am going to just allow this to brush under the rug?"
"I- I can't, Sherlock, I don't understand"
Okay, I understand if this fic is a bit tedious, even quite slow but bare with me ( all of you who live for smut) it will happen, I just want an actual story. I want you to fall in love with them as they learn to love one another, finally and all at once. Just how Sherlock and John need to.
"Oh, Sherlock" Mrs Hudson spoke, her voice flurried with pity for the younger man. Her hand extended, taking a hold of Sherlock's free one, she held it between both of her hands and looked at him "Believe me, I don't say that to be spiteful, dear. I hoped for nothing more than for the two of you to finally wake up and realise what was right in front of you, but you were both too stubborn, you especially"
"You have made many enemies in your time Sherlock, you surely cannot believe that you can just walk away and it will all be solved"
"I may have hoovered, polished, wiped, scrubbed and dusted the house a little upon arrival. The smell was awful, it smelt like dead people"
"It is, can't you see that? It's always been about you. That's all it's ever been about"
"Of course, if you don't like them I can return them immediately and replace them with whatever your heart desires. I just-"
He sighed, unlocking his arms and leaning over just enough so his thighs never left Sherlock's, he grabbed his phone and frowned noting Mycroft's name - once, that name wouldn't have came as a surprise but as he had decided against contacting him for years he knew this wasn't good.
"Yes, well, it's much more real than the mind-blowing life I used to live"
"In a minute" They both replied in unison.
"That wasn't the right time or place. I wasn't who I am now, I was a blind idiot with no human emotion or care in my bones, I was beyond the point of rescuing before you met me - it took you a very long time to help me, John"
"Bloody hell, Sherlock. How long has this been going on? You know, you liking me and all?" He asked, placing his tea onto the coffee table and inching closer slightly.
He sat back, once again, forcing himself to read the words that had haunted him for months.
"Surprising. My brother always spoke about your connections with Scotland Yard, they like you, don't they? Very much so. Very good friends, actually, how was the house warming?"
"He's as stupid as you. He has no idea how the human mind works, you're both aliens to the rest of us. If you wanted to know how to help me, then you should have came to me"
He could hear Sherlock rummaging around in his room, his steps banging against the floor - John exhaled a deep breath as the door to his bed room swung open and he was readying himself for the inevitable awkward situation.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, heading towards the door, already leaving after such a gesture.
"Yes, I'm more than sure" Sherlock nodded quickly, soon returning his teeth to his bottom lip.
"Why didn't you stop him?" Craig finally stopped and asked, his arms falling to his sides almost in defeat.
"I know" John sympathised, just slightly "just take your time. Bit by bit, okay?"
"- I understand you find this difficult and I know how stressful it is for you, however, I am not just anybody, I am me,
"The whole thing, it was so different - usually, you would be grilling them until they are ready to rip your limbs off one by one, but you didn't, you didn't do anything. Why is that?"
"St Barts, obviously" Sherlock said, sitting down on the sofa, not bothering to put on clothes "It's the only place that we can be assured of back-up and protection, we know the building inside and out"
"We're attending a home warming party? Together?" John attempted not to laugh, this was too much.
"When did you get so smart, hey? You've got your head clued on, more than me"
"Yes, one second dear, bloody kettles not working again" She shouted from behind her own door.
"No, he shouldn't have but he did. And there is no way to bring him back, as much as we all wish we could" Sherlock said, standing to his feet finally. "I wish I could have helped him, he never told me about his past - he was a very in the moment man and he only disclosed certain things to me, if I would have known, I would have tried to help him"
John frowned, his eyes concerned. "What's the matter? Oh god, please don't say you're about to change your mind Sherlock"
"What now?"
"John, I think we may have missed something, something rather big" Sherlock finally spoke, his eyes wide as he turned to John.
"I just - Sherlock is back in your life and all I want is to get to know him like you did, he's your best friend and I want to love him like you do" Rosie spoke, her eyes still focused on the counter. "I just want to be able to understand the life you once had, I guess"
As soon as he had left, he dropped his head onto the table with a sigh. He had been here for five hours now and every patient he had was beyond tedious - stupid reasons to visit a doctor. Or maybe, after reuniting with sherlock his job seemed nothing more than
And just as John was about to continue what they had started, they heard the door handle go from behind them and instantly turned to the now opened door.
"Well yes, considering I'm spending my time with a depressed doctor who's missing his boyfriend. One of us really does have to be optimistic or we'd be sat here listening to sad songs and crying all bloody day"
He glanced up quickly to make sure Rosie hadn't seen the text, the last thing he'd need was for her to see what her beloved father had done today to his best friend. He was lucky, she was still rambling on. He took the chance to quickly text back, nodding every now and then so she would believe he was listening.
"Can you believe I'm actually in 221B? This is crazy, my friends are all going to be so Jel"
John had found himself visiting here, 221b Baker Street, every other day, sitting in his rightful throne that he had claimed as his own several years ago, just waiting for a miracle. But even he knew, that this time, it was different.
"And they just let him?" John asked, baffled "why on earth did they not just fucking shoot him there and then?"
Sherlock walked towards his chair, the chair that John had watched for so long just hoping for it to be filled again one day. And as he sat back, crossing his legs over one another, John felt a release of relief wash over his body. He knew that it was real, that, this time he wasn't imagining it. He smiled, just subtly, before following in his steps, sitting in his own opposite him.
He sighed, walking away from the stairs and into the kitchen. He perked himself on the stool beside the counter, pulling the paper towards him, he licked the tip of his fingers, turning the page. It was the same old news every day, boring politics, boring football and most of all, boring and uninteresting crimes. Where had all the interesting criminals gone?
"This. You really wish to live a domestic life, no tricks? No games?"
"Uhm, Hi" Sherlock spoke, his voice extremely softer than usual.
"Yes, I'd rather not hear about anyone's kinks, thank you very much" Greg frowned, turning to Sherlock, looking him up and down "- you really have dressed for the occasion, that's the same blue scarf you always wore"
Sherlock stayed silent for a minute, his head falling into John's touch, his eyes flickering closed for a slight second before they re-opened piercing into John's.
Sherlock collapsed against John's chest, heavy breath against the crook of his neck - and John was utterly bewildered, completely full of lust for the innocent (not so innocent detective) that lay against him.
The smell was the first thing he noticed, other than the unchanged decor that would most likely still be the same after they were gone, it was fresh, like he had actually cleaned it. John was so used to the smell of dust that he would usually prepare himself with an inhaler in hand before he entered, but not this time, he could actually smell an array of air freshener. That was baffling on its own.
"Easy"
John stayed still, sat in his chair, his eyes not leaving Sherlock's for even a second. He was still certain that this was all some sick dream or some sick practical joke that they were playing on him but as he concentrated more on his features he knew that this was far from it.
She flickered her eyes between the two boys once more and then, she left, closing the door behind her and seating herself on the top step. This was extremely more difficult than her time spent running a drug cartel, that was certain.
"Feel better?" John mumbled against his lips, all love-lusted and dazed.
"Bloody hell" John spoke through a heavy breath, his eyes wide as he looked at her and then at Sherlock. "- what the fuck"
and at the sound of Sherlock’s voice he feels like his body has been shoved off a cliff towards oblivion, burning spikes of pleasure stabbing through him as he comes, buried deep inside Sherlock, his entire body singing, every inch of his skin rippling in release. John feels Sherlock bite down on his neck, hard enough to leave a mark, his body clenching around John’s, fingers gripping him tightly as he holds on and then a jet of fluid hits John’s sternum as Sherlock finds his own release.
“You going home for the break?” Greg asks him after their Transfiguration lecture has ended. The Christmas break is in two days and John has no intention of going home. He’s been dreading the holidays, contrary to everyone who all seem impatient to return home to their families and get a short time off from classes. It might be a long two weeks at Hogwarts alone until the other students return, but anything is better than going home to his parents drinking the holidays away. He’d made up his mind a few days ago when he’d received a howler from his Mum: despite the screaming accusations that he’d abandoned their family to attend school, he could hear her words had been slurred, could almost smell the alcohol on her breath even though she’d been nowhere near him. He’d been lucky the letter had arrived when he’d been alone in the Gryffindor dormitory, just moments before he’d left to meet with Sherlock. No one else needs to know how messed up his family is.
Looking over at Sherlock shyly, John notices his normally marble white cheeks are also tinged pink and John’s insides flip excitedly.
But just as John is about to lean forward, test the waters, Sherlock’s arms fall away from John’s sides, pulling away, leaving John feeling breathless, confused and just a tiny bit worked up.
“Hey,” John can’t contain his smile when he finally reaches Sherlock and he mentally slaps himself because he is the epitome of uncool right now.
, and it seems Sherlock has absolutely no objections. He chases John’s mouth, eager and wanting and,
John takes a few steps backwards, pulling Sherlock with him, and Sherlock seems absolutely unwilling to allow any amount of space between them. John has no idea how they actually make it up the stairs: they are a mess of tangled limbs, their mouths still ruthless, kissing with abandon. John very nearly falls on his ass as he walks backwards up the steps, but they manage to get there quite literally in one piece, as they refuse to separate for any length of time.
me, did you?” John starts walking them backwards, towards the general direction of Sherlock’s bedroom, stumbling a bit because they both refuse to allow more than a foot of space between them, but he’s smiling because Sherlock basically just admitted to getting drunk because John kept touching him.
The words hit John just like a spell would, straight in the chest with a dull impact. He barely knows Sherlock, but John knows enough
John has never considered himself inexperienced when it comes to sex. But he’s starting to realize that maybe he’s not so practised when it comes to love.
“I’ve made this potion before. It didn’t take me long to figure out that the instructions from our student textbook weren’t sufficient to make it correctly, so I experimented until I found what was missing.”
“Right,” John agrees because he isn’t sure what else to say.
“Oh, you noticed that, did you?” John decides to play coy. “Why didn’t you say anything, then?” Sherlock had been adamant about keeping up with their schedule, calculating their hourly intake, even going so far as to factor in their respective volume discharge.
, it’s nearly too much.  John hooks his leg around Sherlock’s hips and flips them easily, Sherlock landing on his back and John pries the lube from his hands.
, Sherlock wants to say, but that would be too forward.
John turns his head to make sure Sherlock hasn’t noticed, and something twists in his stomach when he sees an attractive blonde man, standing a tad too close to Sherlock to be considered innocent and smiling brightly at the consulting detective, apparently chatting him up.
, he could quite possibly just rut against Sherlock like this and find his release fairly quickly – he really is that far gone – but he wants more, wants to take his time with Sherlock. He doesn’t want this to be over so fast, just in case Sherlock decides this was a bad idea once the rush of endorphins and the remaining alcohol in their systems wears off.
John reluctantly lets go of Sherlock’s hand once they enter the pub and his eyes are immediately assaulted by bright lights of varying colors, music blaring in his ears and he stumbles back, his senses taking a serious hit. His back collides with Sherlock’s chest and Sherlock’s hands reach out reflexively to steady him, landing on his hips as John bumps into him. Sherlock’s body is warm and solid against his back and John’s neck is level with Sherlock’s shoulder. John doesn’t think too much of it as he lets his head fall back to rest against Sherlock. They fit together well, their bodies melding, slotting against one another and if he were to turn his head just so, he’d find the long, pale column of Sherlock’s neck exposed, smooth skin mere millimetres away from his lips. All he’d have to do, really, is cant forward a bit, and he’d-
The man smirks at him but looks at Sherlock, his eyes appreciatively roaming over his tall, lean body. “I think your friend here might disagree,” he suggests, smirking at Sherlock.
Anderson scowls, sneering at him but John stares him down defiantly. “What about her?” He looks down at Donovan, lying completely still on the ground, eyes wide open and limbs locked at her sides.
“I’m flattered?”
“Shut up,” John slaps his hands over Sherlock’s mouth, his dirty, pretty, beautifully enticing mouth because fuck, he can’t hear those words sliding off Sherlock’s tongue right now, he knows for a fact he would come before his pants were even off and that just won’t do.
He usually doesn’t care what others think of him, which is why he makes absolutely no effort to filter his thoughts, no matter how rude, he just says whatever he happens to be thinking. People would hate him anyway, so what was the point of mincing words?
The thought is like a tidal wave crashing over him, and he closes the remaining distance between them, touching his lips to Sherlock’s in a kiss as soft as his sweater. He drops his new jumper, lets it fall to the floor to free up his hands, his fingers itching to touch Sherlock’s curls. John pulls back to assess the situation, maybe talk things through to see how Sherlock feels about this development in their relationship but the fingers holding on to the back of John’s shirt tighten, fisting around the fabric and pulling him forward until he falls into Sherlock’s lap.
“Then why would you signal those guys to come over?” He asks, genuinely at a loss now. He should let this go. Clearly this conversation is making Sherlock more uncomfortable than any encounter with strangers in that club, but he
Despite the darkness of the night and the poor lighting in the street, John can see Sherlock’s jaw clench and the bob of his adam’s apple as he swallows hard.
John turns towards him so quickly he thinks he might have stretched something in his neck. “What? How do you know that?” Greg never speaks to Sherlock, he’s never even seen them interact, so how could he possibly know what Sherlock’s plans are for Christmas? Greg gives him an all-too-knowing grin and John might have been worried if he wasn’t so excited about the idea of staying at the castle with Sherlock for two whole weeks.
His sentence is cut short when John brings his palm up to cup him through his pants, applying just the right amount of pressure to appease the growing need for friction he knows Sherlock must be desperate for. “I’m sure,” he says anyway, just to reassure Sherlock. He’s never been more sure of anything is his damn life. Sherlock’s hands are fisted at his side as John reaches up, unbuckling his belt and sliding it past the loops, letting it fall to the floor with a loud clatter as the metal hits the wooden floorboards.
Anderson looks conflicted. “You’ll regret this, Watson,” he threatens, but he turns and leaves in the opposite direction John came from, probably realizing he’s powerless to do anything else without his wand. Once he disappears around the corner, John turns and looks up at Sherlock, who’s been silent since John has made his presence known.
Sherlock nods, hoping he doesn’t look like he’s already counting down the minutes and hours. He is, of course, but John certainly doesn’t need to know that. “Thursday.”
“What do people usually say?”
“I’m not interested in ‘anyone’,” Sherlock counters, and John’s eyes snap back to him, confusion written all over his face. When Sherlock doesn’t elaborate, John pushes further.
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole,
“This is fantastic,” Sherlock exclaims, looking up from the lens and back at John.
“Not particularly, but I want to keep all the horny men in this place away from you.” Okay, that
“About leaving Mary?” Sherlock clarifies, meeting John’s eyes, in a guarded yet vulnerable way. John lifts a hand to brush one of Sherlock’s curls from his forehead, something he’s thought about doing too many times to count but had to hold himself back. He doesn’t have to anymore.
Sherlock enters the dungeon and takes his usual seat at the back of the class, a perfect vantage point to observe the rest of the class, though he’s solely interested in John at the moment. Students start to pour in, and Sherlock notices the exact moment John walks into the room, chatting with Lestrade (Sherlock can’t be bothered to remember his first name), another Gryffindor and, as Sherlock had deduced over the last few weeks, one of John’s closest friends. They head towards their usual seat at the front of the dungeon, which Sherlock quickly notices is occupied by most of the ingredients the class would be using today.
“Oh, I can already tell this one won’t be dull, you should call off your shift at St-Mungo’s, John,” Sherlock suggests, and John rolls his eyes. Although, if he’s honest with himself, he knows he
“Hey,” John’s voice is softer now, he reaches up to cup Sherlock’s cheek in his hand, turning his head gently so he’ll meet his eyes again. “It doesn’t matter,” John assures him, and he finds that it’s true. He doesn’t care about Sherlock’s past, whether he’s had masses of lovers or none at all. “Nothing matters except this, right now.”
“Raided Snape's cupboards when I knew he’d be elsewhere.”
Sherlock hums, thinking over his answer. “You should lose control more often,” he suggests, shifting his hips and looking down at John’s lips, his intent abundantly clear.
Apologies for the longer wait, but this last one is a bit longer, so hopefully that makes up for it! Enjoy 😊
He’s past the point of caring but he is not about to let Sherlock get pummelled in a fistfight in his inebriated state. As he drags Sherlock over to the door, he finds himself thinking how much lighter Sherlock is than he’d anticipated. Sherlock may be tall, but he certainly carries no extra weight. He thinks how well Sherlock’s frame fits against his, how unexpectedly manageable it is to manipulate his body, how easy it would be to flip him in bed.
“Check the front pocket of my robes,” Sherlock instructs, and John is fairly sure he blushes crimson, he can only hope it’s dark enough for Sherlock not to notice. He swallows hard, reaching down blindly and doing his best not to touch or brush against anything that is
"Yes, hilarious Mycroft" John rolled his eyes, he liked mycroft, truly, he did - but like every other person in the world, he found him an utter cock most of the time.
He hated Sherlock for leaving, after everything they had been through together, the physical and emotional pain that no other friends had been through before, it just wasn't right. Why would Sherlock bloody Holmes beggar off because he was scared of hurting him? Sherlock wasn't scared of anything. He had made that plainly obvious for as long as he could remember.
"You're so fucking hot" John mumbled against his lips, Sherlock smirked, one hand drifting between their two bodies until his hand gripped his member again and John gasped "Sherlock - unless you're going to do something about it, stop fucking grabbing my dick"
"But Sherlock likes me, he won't mind if I come too. Plus, I don't want to go to Auntie Harry's, she's boring, she just complains about how hard her life is all the time"
Sherlock nodded "Okay, yes, fine" he finally released, John could feel the regret as it flurried through his voice.
"Isn't it? You see, the only way I can carry on is by remembering my life John. You should never cut off the memories, no matter how hard they are, that's your life. And whether you like to admit it or not, Sherlock Holmes was in fact, the biggest part of your life for many years"
"What?" John was baffled, truly. "You're insane, you know that?"
"True" Sherlock nodded "however, your daughter loves them"
"Well, Doctor Watson, it would happen that Jim wasn't the only Moriarty, in fact, not the only psychopath born to that family. His brother, Craig, is someone I've had a deal of run-in's with. An extremely evil individual, much like our beloved villain."
"Noon" she confirmed, but it seemed like her mind was elsewhere. "You're not in a rush, are you?"
"Yes" Suddenly sounding like a choir had marched the room, as multiple voices chimed together to respond.
"Yeah, okay" She nodded, yawning as she sat up on the sofa with tired eyes.
"Jesus, I don't even know what to say Sherlock"
"No, god - no, that's not it" Sherlock shook his head, slowly releasing his arms from John.
"And what movie do you suggest?" Sherlock asked, smiling as John lay down and rested his head on Sherlock's lap. His smile soon faded as John confirmed his worst nightmare.
"Shit indeed" Sherlock nodded "her husbands name is Craig, Craig Moriarty"
"Well, I didn't actually go to him, Mrs Hudson insisted I needed help contacting you and as you were ignoring her calls, she said you would answer him, as you always did"
John couldn't resist, he lunged at Sherlock capturing his lips with his own. This time his body mounting over his, his thighs across Sherlock's as he reached for closeness. Within seconds Sherlock's hands were firmly grasping at John's arse, pulling him onto him. John's lips parted slightly as his tongue met Sherlock's, fighting for dominance for only a slight second before John gave in and melted under his touch.
Sherlock nodded, heading towards the door, slamming it open like he always had done. It was almost like he had to make a show stopping appearance no matter the situation. Sherlock walked ahead, his feet stomping up the stairs, John shook his head, closing the door behind him gently and following suit.
He froze at that, he felt Mrs Hudson's hand lift from his leg and he knew who it was. The husky but firm voice that sent such chills down his spine, it made it hard to breathe once more.
"There's endless possibilities, John and he will stop at nothing - he will attack everyone that we love, until finally he gets to me, who he needs" Sherlock spoke slowly. "- you realise we are risking everyone's life"
"Yes. Obviously. Look, you told me when I first met you that you were married to your work, the idea of emotions, relationships or any of the sort was completely off limits. So when you told me how you felt, it came completely as a shock, okay?" John began to talk, taking a few cautious steps into the room.
"No, god no - I told you Rosie, that's not what we do anymore" John frowned, shaking his head in frustration as he peered up at the time. Hoping just hoping, that they weren't too late.
Tumblr-
"He shouldn't have died"
"A what?" John frowned, taking the flowers and bottle from Sherlock and placing them onto his desk "when on earth have you ever wanted to attend a party?"
He did as he was told, instantly. He got to his feet, taking a deep breath as he buttoned his suit jacket up. He looked at John and then Rosie, forcing a smile on his face.
Sherlock stayed still, his arms falling to his sides, his eyes a look of mere confusion. He could never understand this feeling he had encountered but to hear it splayed out in front of him so bluntly, it hit him, he, Sherlock Holmes, was utterly and desperately in love with John Watson and there was nothing he could do about it - not now, not ever.
"You don't look a day over twenty one"
"You cocky bastard" John rolled his eyes "get to work"
"Please, refrain from teasing me" Sherlock laughed softly, removing his hand as his eyes turned to the wall once more, noting the pictures scattered across it and the stab marks in the wall and he looked quietly for a few seconds before something hit him and he was suddenly rushing to the wall, his boxers bunched at his ankles as he focused on one particular news article. John watched in bewilderment as Sherlock pulled the photo from the wall, using his free hand to pull his boxers up to his waist and eventually turning to John with wide eyes "I know what he's going to do"
It was always strange reading about himself in the nation wide paper, however, it was interesting.
"Okay" she spoke, surprising John, he hadn't been able to have a conversation with her that lasted more than a minute but yet tonight, she was speaking to him like an adult. "Is it true what they say?"
"Have you seen my shoes?"
"I'm sorry John, I had - I had no idea that's how you felt" Sherlock's voice was like music to his ears, sweet sympathy of forgotten memories and a broken heart. He had forgotten how smooth his voice really was.
"Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your life dad" Rosie shouted, lifting her head up to frown at her dad "it's not my fault mum died, you know? I'm sorry that being a single parent was so hard for you"
"Answers?"
"Yes, but barely. You don't understand, I need to see him"
"What about you though?" She mumbled, still grasping onto him.
"Oh, really?" John smirked, his lips turning at the thought of seeing Sherlock spread beneath him, he leaned in, placing a gentle kiss against his whilst his hand moved between them until he had reached Sherlock's bulging trousers, his hand gripped against his bulge John watched Sherlock gasp above him, his mouth opening slightly and his eyes closing shut, he was truly a work of art "Who am I to deny the detective his motive?"
"I- I can't exactly put into words how I feel for you, however I can confirm it is something along those lines" Sherlock nodded, his eyes finally flickering up to meet John's.
"This time last month, it was you in this situation. It was you who was confused, hurt and bewildered by your own emotions" John began, remembering the key details of Sherlock's face the moment he had admitted it all to him "you know how much that hurt, that's why I'm beginning to wonder why on earth you would leave it at that and allow me to struggle with the knowledge of your feelings for this entire month and you doing nothing about it"
"Unfortunately, I can't always fix problems"
"But, so help me god, if you ever decide to fuck off again and leave then I can assure you the next time you return, I won't be as lenient. That's a promise, okay?"
"You ready?" John asked, turning round with a soft smile as they reached the door.
"I- I find talking about this sort of thing very, in fact, extremely difficult"
The words would hit him, again and again, like a stabbing knife right through the wound that would be his already fragile body.
John and Sherlock were now fully dressed, well, partially. Sherlock's shirt was missing a few buttons and his hair was everywhere, but dressed enough they were. They had a tea each, both sipping it slowly as they tried to contemplate how exactly they had gone from seeing each other for the first time in twelve years to John being on his knees for him a day later. They knew they were both unpredictable at the best of times but this, was something else.
Sherlock was dressed in a fitting suit, his lanyard around his neck and coffee in his hand. His curls now styled upwards, less adorable looking and more gorgeous. He was flicking through the paper with his free hand, every now and again glancing up to John.
"No, yes, but no. It's not a real party as such, we will be going to Lestrades house, Molly, Mrs Hudson and Mycroft will also be attending. He has just moved and is having a home warming party, I think that's what they call it?"
John took a deep breath, lowering his head to look at the ground. His chest was heaving, he had never felt such a rush before.
"Very much so" He nodded, a malicious grin spreading across his lips and the sight caused Sherlock to gulp, the smile so similar to Moriaty's, it was like a flood of memories hitting him all at once.
"Are you okay?" He repeated, this time to Rosie who nodded with a soft smile. "You two are as bad as each other, Jesus, why on earth would you be nervous? Get in here"
"I'll visit this evening" Molly confirmed, mainly to herself before glancing up at John again "I'll send her your love - make sure that whatever bastard did this to her, pays, do you hear me? Don't let them get away with this"
"Molly, she would never forgive you if any harm came to Sherlock Holmes. The man she loved way before she loved you, she cares for him, like she always will. If you killed him, she would leave you"
"Only for you, Doctor Watson. And please don't tell anyone, I'm the Notorious, Heartless, Sherlock Holmes, wouldn't want anyone to know any different" Sherlock smiled softly, lifting his head to place a kiss on John's forehead.
"Oh right" He finally realised, nodding his head.
He thought for a second, peering up at the clock with a glance before sighing and nodding his head, he unbuttoned his suit jacket and sat a seat away from him, his back up straight and his palms on his thighs. Uncomfortable.
"So, like I said, I give it six months, exactly"
"I don't feel well" she tried.
"What if he doesn't like me? I'm his Goddaughter so he has to like me, right?"
"Oh, yeah, okay. That sounds nice" She attempted to act cool although her facial expressions were enough to prove otherwise.
"Yes, until I saw sense and when I realised you were so far up John Watsons arse there was simply no return for you"
"Sherlock, please" John spoke firmer, his tone catching Sherlock's attention finally, his emerald green eyes that he loved so dearly booking onto his own "- you know we can't ignore this, you know what will happen if we do. If we walk away from this, he will find us and we all know what he wants and I
"I didn't know what to do"
"Thank you" Sherlock choked out, his eyes never quite reaching John's.
John's hands stayed out, pulling on the lose strands whereas his lips began to move down the rough of Sherlock's unshaven stubble, below his chin and down his neck, his teeth nipping on the skin under his ear. And John could physically feel Sherlock growing harder beneath him, he might (or absolutely did) have moved so his arse was now sat directly on top of it, he also may (definitely) have began to lift his hips ever so slightly with every kiss and bite just to feel Sherlock's body move with frustration beneath him. He was enjoying this.
"Never. But apparently that's what couples do"
Sherlock smiled slightly before an idea sparking in his head "Gavin" he suggested.
"Dont start, Rosie - we've already spoke about this, haven't we? We're not sending you away because we want to, we're doing it because we have to" John attempted to explain.
"Idiot, idiot" Sherlock spat, his eyes clenching shut.
"You needed to heal, you needed to grieve the loss of your wife, deal with everything. Mycroft told me that human emotions are difficult and if I really wanted to save you, then the best option would be for me to leave you. Allow you to grieve through the pain that I, caused"
"You nicked this idea from some cheesy Twitter account?" John stifled in a laugh, reaching his hand up to cover his mouth "you're adorable"
John arrived home, it was five when he walked through his front door. He was exhausted, he hadn't stayed long at 221B, he didn't speak to Sherlock much after their reunion, they simply sat in the kitchen listening to Mrs H talk about how happy she was that her boys were back together. However, the whole time, John's mind was still in a complete mess.
"John, how are you buddy?"
John sighed "Mary, I'm losing my bloody mind"
They parted lips, their lips still inches away from one another and John could feel Sherlock's unsteady and heavy breath against his own.
"But-" John's words escaped him, he sat back in a daze "that doesn't make any sense. You spent most of your time preaching that normal is boring, what has this bloody trip done to you? Did you seek out yoga? Did it cleanse your mind?"
"So, he either wants to kill Sherlock or make him kill himself? Like Moriarty did?"
"You're not driving my car, John"
"Just this. Sitting in the kitchen of my family home having a cup of tea with you knowing that it'll just be a normal evening - it's strange, usually a cup of tea with you leads to clients and multiple deaths"
"You. You're amazing. You spent so long acting as though you had no heart inside that strange body of yours yet all along you've had a heart of gold - how? I mean, why did you act so cold for so long when this version of you was a thing? Why hide it?"
His hands moved before his mind could process, they gripped onto John's thigh in a tight hold, he could feel John's smaller frame jump only slightly as it sat against him. This was definitely his medication, to feel John's body so close to him, it was like a sweet serenity, if only he had discovered this all these years ago when he had been stressed - noted.
"Look at you two! Together once again" Molly smiled sincerely "I'm still mad at you both for not coming to my wedding. Sherlock, I understand, he's an idiot. But John? What's your excuse?"
"I don't think that's possible"
"Still, I agree, he is sometimes an idiot"
"Well, I might suggest that things are going slightly better than last time I disappeared. You haven't punched nor head-butted me"
John had swapped numbers with Sherlock discretely, waving a short and awkward goodbye as he left for home. It wasn't too far from the city but far enough that he could be comfortable and away from flashing lights, drama and crime scenes, he was content.
"Sherlock, for the love of god, for once in your fucking life, shut the fuck up" John growled "I haven't got a wedding to go back to, don't you understand that? You think if I had just got married I would run over here just to say sorry? Of course I fucking wouldn't"
John pulled Sherlock's jeans down to his knees and then, teasingly and painfully slow he pulled his boxers down to match. He bowed down slightly, taking Sherlock's cock into his hand, watching as Sherlock's head flung back and his eyes closed, he honestly could have came at the sight. Watching The Sherlock Holmes come undone in front of him, what a sight.
"What's what like?" John asked, taking a step back, closer to Sherlock.
"But you love Thai" John frowned.
"oh do forgive me" John spoke, flurried with saracasm "so, was there a point to you calling me or were you just in dire need to attack me with your verbal diarrhoea?"
Mycroft's eyes had slowly widened as John spoke, shocked by his words and yet as he finished all he could do was nod "Very well, I hope that the two of you spend together as much time as you wish"
"Of course, you knew my mum too!" Rosie spoke excitedly, stepping away from her dad as Mrs H brought her in for a tight hug, wrapping her arms so tightly around her shoulders.
"That's utter-"
Sherlock couldn't be bothered with this simple conversation, instead he just nodded, walking past his brother to place the tray onto the coffee table beside John, who was sat, quietly just taking in the conversation. Sherlock lifted a mug from the tray and passed it over to him and John smiled a thank you.
"Right" She nodded, her eyes flickering to her computer screen as she typed the name into the system. It felt like hours let alone minutes until she finally found what they were looking for. "You'll need to go onto the trauma ward, the Rose Ward, you may not be able to see her due to the fact she is in-"
"Fine, but just... You know, be safe, don't... just don't get yourselves killed" She spoke cautiously, stepping down from the stool and grabbing her bag from the floor.
Short update before The game really is on.
"I'm seriously upset I missed that" John stifled in a laugh, his hand reaching up to grasp his mouth to hold it in.
"He asked me to do this. It was his last wish before he killed himself"
"No, but it's a case" Sherlock retorted, grabbing his coat from the side of John's chair. "Come along, John"
"Yes, please do" Sherlock retorted, reaching to place his mug back onto the tray. "Is that all?"
"Hi, I hope you don't mind. I reserved this table as it was away from the windows. I didn't want the media to get ahold of the fact I'm back, not yet anyway, can't really be dealing with criminals and crazed fans"
"I received a warning from Lestrade" Sherlock whispered harshly "He's on his way up"
"Jesus" John sighed leaning his head back against the wall in the hallway, phone still in hand "When will this bloody end?"
"How wrong you are. In fact, it's very possible and I think, it's time you did go home. Back to Baker Street, back to John Watson. I think your time as a detective is over, Sherlock. In fact, I think it's time you lived, normally"
"We wait" Sherlock spoke slowly, walking over to John again, releasing the photo from his finger tips and replacing it with John's hand instead, pulling him up until they were chest to chest once more, his long arms wrapping around John's shoulders, resting his chin against his head. "There's not much more we can do"
"You're so dramatic. He'll be back, I promise"
"I need money"
Sherlock chuckled "No gory details, I'm afraid. Wasn't quite as evil as we assumed, nice guy actually - you'll probably meet him"
"Harry's" John answered, looking at Sherlock with nothing more than complete admiration.
John gulped, closing his eyes for a second until re-opening them to meet Sherlock's, he reached his hand out, grasping his for only a second in a tight grip before letting go.
John. And I need you to talk to me before I lose my bloody fucking mind"
"You're so over dramatic, John" Mary laughed lightly, John could hear the sea rushing around her and a hint of jealousy brushed over him. "Look, Sherlock Holmes is a prick, I know that, you know that. He's also someone who is in love with you and luckily for him, you happen to feel the same - you know he's a difficult man, understatement I know, but this is all so new to him. You need to be a little more understanding, he's probably struggling with it all. Ever thought that he's waiting for you to speak to him about it? He's probably shitting  himself at the idea of confronting you"
He yanked the door open, faced with a smiling and casual looking sherlock. John's eyes scanned over his appearance, noting his curls that were slightly less fluffy today, in fact they falling slightly along his forehead. He looked younger. He was dressed in a black t shirt with a large Burberry scarf wrapped around his neck - where the bloody hell was his shirt? - who cared, he was wearing the tight jeans he had been wearing when John finally saw him again. And 'wow' John thought. He was a god.
He clenched his eyes shut, whispering profanities under his breath, hoping, just hoping that when he opened them it would be like any other dream he had and it would all be his imagination. But as he counted to three in his head, he opened his eyes and was caught in the same situation he was before.
He turned, leaning against the kitchen door, a smug look still spread across his lips.
"You mean, for sucking your dick?" John asked blatantly, he choked out a laugh as he watched Sherlock halt, his tea spilling slightly onto his lap. "I'm kidding, it's fine, you don't need to bloody thank me. Although, we do need to speak about what just happened"
"Oi, oi, did we interrupt something here?" He said, his voice as excited as his posture.
"Well, I'm here, aren't I?"
"I don't think they do. I think that's just you"
were famous, partially, barely in fact. But I suppose
They both turned watching the firemen walk out of the front door with a frustrated looking Mrs Hudson and John really couldn't help but laugh.
"I'm not acting any different, I can assure you"
"I can't speak for later, but I'm pretty sure I'll be hungry for something else" Sherlock slyly side, wrapping an arm around John again.
"About what?" John pushed, he needed these answers. The unanswered questions that had played on his mind for so long.
"What?" Sherlock frowned, the over powering feeling of guilt washing over his body "- Jesus, no, Rosie. He doesn't resent you, not even close. He loves you, so dearly. You're the only being that reminds him of his wife, you are the combination of both your parents love and soul and with you here he's constantly reminded of the love he felt. You're the best thing that's ever happened to him, don't ever doubt that. Without you, he wouldn't have coped"
"We know why, John" Sherlock spoke softly, his eyes never reaching his.
"Oh, don't be dramatic. You're Sherlock Holmes, you're a consulting detective and you will find yourself again. Whether it be a week from now, a month from now or even a year from now"
"If you insist. So - what are you plans now you are home? Are you planning on getting back into the swing of things? Fighting criminals? Chasing psychopaths?"
"I don't think you understand. You underestimate the way Sherlock felt for you, as ever, you both had a habit of that, you were never able to express how you truly felt. You know, we took bets the day before the wedding, myself, Molly and Lestrade all bet that Sherlock would tell you on the day. In fact, I still think if that bloody soldier hadn't have been stabbed, he still would have"
Sherlock and John were sitting in the kitchen, both equally quiet as they sipped their tea, sneaking glances at one another. The past few weeks had been a whirlwind and neither knew how to comprehend it.
"Thanks, love"
His breath hitched, his eyes gazed over his appearance, once beautiful brown curly locks now glazing over with a misty silver, brown still peaking out from underneath. He noticed it was shorter, not too much, but more defined. The once extremely structured jawline was now more full, his face rounder yet his cheekbones still stuck out like sharp razor blades, the eyes, so bright, glazed over with emotion, surrounding by black circles from lack of sleep, as always. His clothes, they were different, yes, definitely. He had never seen him anything but a suit, but today, he was looking at a man dressed in a simple black pair of skinny jeans and an over sized grey sweatshirt. Who was this man?
"We'll be fine, John" Sherlock frowned "I'm not planning to jump this time nor am I planning on getting myself killed - we simply, watch and wait. He's obviously a very self-conscious and vulnerable man, easy to manipulate into doing stupid things, therefor it should be easy enough to manipulate him into leaving us alone"
"Because, I have plans with Sherlock tonight. Just him and I" John rolled his eyes, taking a sip of his water.
John couldn't respond with words, he just held onto him tightly, leaning his head against his chest "Yes" he choked out.
"Yes - I, yes, I suppose it is" Molly forced out, completely taken back, turning to John with a bewildered emotion across her face "- I don't think I've ever heard the word sorry leave his lips before"
"Oh, come on dad! Stop acting like I'm oblivious. You do realise that I am currently in high school, right?"
He heard the music slowly increase in volume, he knew that was his cue to shut up before his teenage daughter came and castrated him.
"He's on his way in now, Dr Watson"
"Fuck, Sherlock" John was wild, he hadn't had any sort of sexual contact with anyone in a very long time and he was certain, even though he had waited so long, for Sherlock to be the one currently getting him off, was the reason he was incoherent right now. Fucking Sherlock.
"You-" Sherlock attempted to speak, his voice cracking, he clenched his eyes shut as he forced words to escape "you"
"How long now?" Rosie asked through a sigh, leaning her head back on the chair.
He shrugged "I suppose, nothing. We haven't spoken about it, well, Sherlock has said he's done with all of that now, didn't you?" He said, nudging Sherlock's arm with his elbow.
"Thirteen. You can imagine, it's the worst year of a teenagers life, hormones and all that rubbish. Painful, for her and I"
"Oh, come on babe. You know what he's like, it was probably really hard for him to admit that to you, he's dealing with it all - he'll speak about it when his mind has finally slowed down" She sympathised.
"I-" Sherlock began, not entirely sure what he wanted to say, quite luckily, John interrupted.
"I am - yes, I am very glad" Sherlock nodded.
"Are you ever going to see him again? He's my godfather isn't he? Well, that's what you wrote"
"Sherlock, Baker Street has been attacked. Your flat was up in flames"
"Dad" He heard the shout as the heavy footsteps followed down his stairs, he rolled his eyes, placing the newspaper down and turning to the door way where Rosie was stood.
Mrs Hudson felt her heart break, to be in front of such a broken and defenceless Sherlock was something she never to see, she would have much preferred an arrogant detective than this. She knew he hated affection, but she didn't care, she reached out, pulling the detective into her arms, she was surprised to feel him fall onto her desperately, his head resting on her shoulder as the cold droplets of tears fell onto her exposed shoulder.
"That way, myself, you, Rosie, Mrs Hudson and a select name of others will be free from harms way. No more silly games or deductions, we shall all simply - live"
"I think-" Sherlock starts and stops, trying to consider a proper answer to her admission "your father only has good intentions for you, he most likely hid our past to help not only himself but you also. It wasn't a very safe or stable lifestyle, Rosie, I can assure you"
"At least I tried" Sherlock tilted his head to smile at John sweetly, leaning down once more to kiss forehead gently. "I'm sorry it all went so wrong, that was not my intention at all"
Sherlock's posture suddenly changed, he was relaxed, more so than John. He took a step forward, closing the space between them, smirking as he reached for the bottom of John's simple T-shirt, pulling it from him without a second thought, then copying John's actions as he worked at his jeans until they were both standing awkwardly and very similar in front of one another.
"What?" Sherlock asked, mainly worried than he hadn't satisfied him. But John gave him no more time for questions, his hands reached up to fumble with the button on Sherlock's beautifully tight jeans, he admired his thighs, he wanted nothing more than to bite them. But, instead, he ripped the jeans open and then pulled them down as far as he could, then, following with Sherlock's boxers.
"Yes, well, not this time"
"Oh, John, did I scare you? I'm sorry, I must have been tired" She teased lightly, holding onto him equally as tight. "Bloody fire, a bloody fire! Can you believe it?"
"Yes, that's literally all you have to do. There's no need to worry that your limbs will be falling off"
"For how long?"
"God, you make me sick" Rosie whined, moving her chair away from her dad and closed to Mrs Hudson "Save me, please. He's like a lovesick puppy"
"You really think you'll be able to stay away from this?" John challenged, lifting his phone up and shaking it in Sherlock's direction.
It was silent, John awaiting some sort of comment from Rosie but there was nothing. Even Sherlock frowned at the odd silence, they both turned their heads at the same time to look at her - both noting the deadpanned expression across her face and after a few moments of awkwardness, she spoke.
"It was a very difficult time" he attempted to defend himself, turning to Sherlock with a look, the look, in fact.
He didn't expect the next response.
. His John, who loved him, who really loved him.
He felt the tear fall from his cheek so effortlessly, burning on his skin like his body rejected it. He hated this.
"He got obsessed with some books, I can't remember the names but they were so weird - he spoke about them for days, they were based on hurting people, for fun almost... eventually his friends stopped calling, he stopped going out and he was isolating himself in his room. It was like he lost himself, mum and dad were so worried, they couldn't even talk to him. It was as if he was fighting with himself, we would sit downstairs and hear him shouting at himself, an argument almost"
He lay there for what seemed an eternity, bellowing in his own self-pity, Mrs Hudson surprisingly staying behind and checking on him two hours after John had left, she sat on the end of bed, her hand rested on his ankle as he simply lay there, tears still streaming down his cheeks and his eyes focused on the plain, pale white wall beside him. Sherlock couldn't fathom out the words she was saying, only noting the name John as it rolled of her tongue and the rest nothing more than a mumble.
"You tried" John shrugged, looking up at the flat.
"Because that is what I would like to do. I, much like yourself, are not getting any younger. I don't believe I am quite as capable as I was"
"Don't use such ridiculous terms"
"Thank you" John closed his eyes for a moment, a sigh falling from his lips "we're in this together, okay? You're not alone Sherlock, I'm going to be right by your side the whole time, the game is on"
, John.
"What?" She edged on the sofa, looking between John and Sherlock, a baffled look in her eyes.
"You can join us, if you like?" John offered as he head towards the stairs with Rosie behind him.
"Do I?" John asked, turning round the look at her "You realise I spent most of my life working, looking after you and then sleeping, right? This is the first time in years I've had my life back"
"Craig Moriarty, he's thirty eight, lives in Kent, once working in Morgue, around dead bodies, no one would hire him, obviously, due to the fact he's a physcopath - only able to work alongside dead people, spends a lot of his time engaging in conversation with them - after his older Brother,
John moved until he was hovering over him, his hands either side of his head, his face only a few inches from Sherlock's and if Sherlock thought he was having breathing problems before, he certainly was now.
"Yeah, probably" she shrugged "can we get a Chinese?"
"And? I need to see him. Urgently"
"Then why on earth are we here?" Sherlock spat, not quite the questioning tone it should have been.
Sherlock took only a few steps forward before Rosie launched into him, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her cheek on his chest. John physically stepped back, a gasp escaping his lips as he watched. Sherlock stood still for a slight second, trying to understand what was happening, John expected him to push her off or even ask her politely to move but instead Sherlock simply returned the favour.
"You're welcome" John chuckled, attempting not to roll his eyes "- Awful, it really is. This is my family Living room, not really the place for Blow Jobs and cum on the rug, is it?"
"Because, like you said, you know me"
"That prick. Ah, I'm sure it's nothing, she's a lesbian anyway, isn't she?"
"What could be worse than burning your kitchen down?" John mumbled to him, leaning his head slightly into his chest.
"You... miss him?" Mycroft repeated, the word so foreign to him. And if he hadn't have seen Sherlock so distressed he would have mocked him, for some strange reason, he found himself sympathising with him. "How so?"
"Yes, well, it's been many years since that era"
He smiled, he shouldn't have but he did. It was only a small smile but Sherlock's words seemed to affect him in all the right ways, although he did leave him, the idea of John being the only thought process was quite - soothing.
Mrs Hudson stared at him, her eyes wide as he watched the single tear roll down John's cheek as he let the bundle of words flood from him like an over-due volcano explosion, everything he had thought about for so long just exploding all at once. And John even shocked himself, he didn't know he was capable of saying. As his breath steadied, his eyes were able to find Mrs Hudson, her eyes teary and flicking between John and the door-way. He had been so indulged with anger that he had forgotten the key part that the front door had opened behind him and he knew he most likely made a fool out of himself in front of Greg.
"If I could take this pain from you, I would, I would take it in a heart beat but I can't. This is a feeling you have to endure, Sherlock, it just proves that you're human, you really do have a heart inside of you"
He smirked at that, remembering how Sherlock had woken both him and Mary up after he had watched Rosie for two hours and was losing his mind with every second, unable to talk to or understand what the baby wanted.
That name hadn't been heard in a long time, the name was foreign to him, he had spent so much of his time trying to forget him and the memories that he had wiped him from his thoughts completely. He spent months, years, even, just waiting and waiting for him to come back like Mrs H said he would but after five years he finally decided enough was enough and that's when he decided to give up. He should have known he would be mentioned.
"Fine, she's just, you know" He shrugged, gripping onto the side "she's bragging to all of her friends how
"I want... Can you undress me?" Sherlock asked, his eyes flickering to the floor as the question fell from his lips.
"What did you get up to today?"
"The fun your brother and I had is over now, it's done, we had our games and excitement and there's no time for it anymore"
"You shouldn't be so understanding"
He couldn't deal with this, not now, not ever.
"Bullshit" John rolls his eyes, his eyes forming into a grimace "you are Sherlock bloody Holmes, the game is always on"
"Mycroft, get out" John rolled his eyes, lifting an arm to point towards the door "you're not convincing him anymore than you have already tried. Just get out"
"So the big question" John began, peering up at Sherlock as he sat in front of him.
"It's nothing of the sort" Sherlock scoffed, slightly offended by John's choice of words "I'm doing everything I can to make you happy, you told me the game was on John, but it isn't a game. I'm trying here, more so than I ever have done in my life"
"I... John, I told you, I... I needed some time to deal with this all" Sherlock choked out, his eyes furrowed into a frown "shouldn't you be at your wedding reception? Where's Mary?"
He slept in comfort, knowing that Sherlock was there, even his jacket, wrapping around his smaller frame, holding onto his body. And he would have slept for longer if he hadn't have heard Sherlock scramble across the floor.
"Don't think negatively. We are free, John - we are safe from harms way, we no longer have to worry about the next time one of us will be shot or thrown into a bonfire, we only have to think about this, us and Rosie. That's it. No more trouble, I can assure you"
Sherlock looks back at him then, his eyes curious. “I told you I was married to my work.”
, the sight of Sherlock like this – desperate, wanting, his head tilted back against the door, cheeks flushed with arousal – is enough to bring John to his knees.
He heads towards the Gryffindor common room to drop off his books and pick up his Potions material when if first occurs to him that he and Sherlock hadn’t even set a time or place to meet up. They haven’t gotten the chance to talk since Tuesday. Could Sherlock have forgotten? It’s entirely possible that something way more interesting than meeting John came up and since they haven’t discussed meeting up again maybe he’d-
“So, you want this, too?” He needs to hear Sherlock say it, clear as day.
, and that’s partly what’s so bloody infuriating. What is so different about John than the rest of them? He doesn’t know, he just understands it as fact, as obvious as how Aconite is used in a Wolfsbane potion or how Bezoars act as an antidote to most poisons.
“What’re ye so upset about, ye blimey beast?” Hagrid mutters to the dog rhetorically, opening up the front door for him and John throws himself to the ground behind an overgrown pumpkin to avoid being seen. The squirrel runs off in the opposite direction and Fang takes off after it. He hopes he’s given Sherlock enough time to get through the back door because frankly, John is out of ideas and his heart is racing, beating hard against his chest. He peaks over the top of the pumpkin in time to see Hagrid come through the door and turn to walk around the hut. John takes the opportunity to bolt for the trees where there’s far more cover. He makes it into the forest, plunged mostly in darkness now that the sun has set completely and plasters his back to the trunk of a tree three times his width, panting slightly as the adrenaline courses through him. Catching his breath, John peers over his shoulder to look for Sherlock but doesn’t see him, though he hears Hagrid come back from around the house. His heart starts hammering again at the thought of Sherlock getting caught inside and he’s considering blowing his cover to buy Sherlock more time inside to look for the Griffin claw. He takes a step forward to walk out of the shadows when he’s suddenly shoved back up against a tree.
? Does he want this as much as John, even after the bliss of release? Something sharp lodges itself inside John’s heart, squeezing tightly and it stops his lungs for a moment too.
Sherlock expects John to look affronted at the comment and even more so at the suggestion that they sit together again, but John merely smiles, apparently unbothered by either.
He was
in front of the best wizard at Hogwarts and he wonders why it suddenly bothers him so much what others think of him. Or maybe he just cares what Sherlock thinks of him.
“Sherlock, are you-”
John’s mind replays every touch they’ve shared since entering the club, taking note of the fact that Sherlock had reciprocated every one. The way Sherlock had held his hand, touched his fingers to John’s hips and waist, leaned back into his chest, how he’d reached out to stroke John’s cheek just before they’d been interrupted. And that look they’d shared.
“Yeah, I do actually, mate.” John’s tone doesn’t leave much room for arguing, definitely a clear message to bugger off. Seriously, could he have chosen a worst moment?
“You’re early,” Sherlock says when he opens the door at John’s knock (no way is he trying to solve a puzzle right now, his brain is running on over drive already) with a raised eyebrow.
Shit,
Stupid. He’d been an idiot not to realize they’d followed him from his Transfiguration class into the courtyard and frankly, he thought he might have been stuck there for hours had John not showed up when he did.
“How could you possibly know you’ll be interested in this client’s case before you’ve even seen or talked to them?” He challenges, just to make sure Sherlock isn’t having him on.
John takes his time, he’s always loved getting presents, and he’s enjoying watching Sherlock squirm from the corner of his eye as he watches John, probably wishing he’d go faster. He lifts the lid, his insides twisting in anticipation and under the thin colored tissue paper, he finds a neatly folded cream-colored jumper. His fingers brush over the fabric and he gasps. “It’s so soft.” Sherlock smiles, a real smile that reaches his eyes and John thinks it’s so rare to see him like this, he can’t tear his eyes away.
“Yeah, that’d be great,” John agrees, appreciating that Sherlock seems to be focusing on things John will need for his O.W.L.s.
“Right then,” the other man says, raising his hands in surrender at Sherlock’s sharp, unforgiving tone and he turns to leave, obviously a little irritated but not about to pick a fight where he isn’t wanted.
“They’ve gone. We should head back before someone realizes we’re missing,” Sherlock suggests, and John thinks he might deliberately be avoiding his gaze.
, he promises himself.
“You are the most complex deduction I’ve ever encountered,” Sherlock says, and John breathes out a laugh because that is such a
John just about chokes on air. “There’s no girl, Greg,” he denies and really, it’s not his fault if Greg formulated his question around an assumption. He doesn’t even have to lie because there is most certainly no girl. And though there
he says quickly, and Anderson’s wand flies out of his hand and into John’s before he even has the time to point it in John’s general direction. He knows he’s probably just made two enemies out of the pair, but he truly couldn’t be arsed to care.
“You should be,” Sherlock confirms. “You occupy my mind incessantly and just when I think I’ve got you figured out, you surprise me. Right up until now, I still had no clue whether you wanted this.” John grins, thinking that might oddly be one of the sweetest things anyone’s ever said about him. He’s always thought of himself as quite ordinary, but if he can keep a mind like Sherlock’s entertained, then maybe he isn’t so boring after all.
Curiosity is definitely normal. Mates talk about this kind of stuff all the time, make allusions to their sexual prowess over pints at the pub, it’s a common topic of conversation. But not with Sherlock. No, Sherlock has always avoided anything to do with sex, and John has always thought it was because he wasn’t interested, didn’t see the appeal.
“Only because
John always hoped he’d become a Healer, live a simple life and perhaps he’d find some form of happiness along the way. Thinking back to his days at Hogwarts, he’d never have predicted that alongside working as a Healer at St-Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, he’d also be writing a weekly column in
Oh god, it practically makes him dizzy, makes the world spin round in a way that rivals the alcohol. He wants to burrow his face in Sherlock’s neck, let himself be engulfed in the intoxicating smell and
Surprised, John’s gaze swings over to Sherlock, and his heart stutters in his chest cavity when he finds Sherlock still looking at him with the same intensity as before. His mouth goes dry and he bites down on his bottom lip in an attempt to keep it together, to stop himself from doing something completely outrageous, something like pulling Sherlock roughly towards him and pressing their bodies together.
“About damn time you admit it out loud, you’ve been pining over him ever since you first had to sit together in Potions,” Greg teased.
Oh god, oh god, oh god.
John hums around his erection and Sherlock hisses, his hands shooting out and latching onto John’s hair, gripping tightly, his lower body bucking, and it goes straight to John’s groin. He moans, his hips rutting against thin air and Sherlock barely has time to warn him, a whispered “John, I’m-” before his entire body convulses in pleasure, and he comes in John’s mouth, eyes screwed shut, holding onto John’s hair, pulling roughly, but John loves it. He looks up at Sherlock and something coils deep in his abdomen, clenching, need ripping through him because holy shit, the man is beautiful. Sherlock is always attractive, but John has never seen him like this, lost in the throes of orgasm, skin flushed and hair an absolutely mess.
“Me too.” And then he’s reaching for Sherlock again, lips meeting his in a fiery kiss, and he lets his hands trail down Sherlock’s back until he reaches his arse, pulling him in until their lower bodies are grinding against each other and fuck,
“You could have used a more damaging curse,” Sherlock says, breaking the silence between them. He lets go of John’s hand and dusts off his robes, his face slowly returning to its natural color. John finds he misses the warmth of Sherlock’s fingers instantly in his, but he consciously pushes the thought to the back of his mind.
“Not badmouthing us now, are you, Holmes?” And John realizes he knows the Slytherins as well when the boy speaks, Donovan and Anderson, another pair of fifth years he usually does his best to steer clear of.
“You want to dance?” Sherlock asks, a bit confused because he knows for a fact that John hates dancing.
John hastily moves out of Sherlock’s arms, but grabs his hand to move him away from the bright white stream of light shining directly towards them and pulls him in the general direction of the bar. They are
“Fine,” he mutters, answering John’s question and he finally takes the offered hand, pulling himself back up to his feet. John’s fingers tingle where their hands meet, something akin to a current of electricity flowing throw the length of his arm.
, 2012
John drags Sherlock over to the bar, still holding onto his hand. No one would think anything of two blokes holding hands here, right? No big deal then. Sherlock follows, but it’s only when they make it to the counter that John realizes they left their graduated cylinders at the last pub in their rush to leave and avoid a fight. He orders two pints of beer from the bartender who gives Sherlock a once-over too obvious for John’s liking, and his gut tightens in an unpleasant way.
“I was,” Sherlock admits, his voice sharp, devoid of emotion. “Problem?”
. His heart rate grows wild, his breathing is laboured, and Sherlock is cursing and repeating his name like it’s the only thing left to hold onto
away – from any thoughts of Sherlock’s cheekbones, or any part of Sherlock’s body, for that matter. That was proving to be a much harder task than he’d originally anticipated given his befuddled state of his mind, the alcohol making his brain feel fuzzy and apparently awfully confused about what he wants.
“I thought you wanted me to come over,” the man continues, now sounding a bit put off by Sherlock’s blatant dismissal. “The way you looked at me was kind of an obvious inv-”
“You don’t?” Sherlock asks, opening his eyes, looking at John in disbelief and John shakes his head. He should probably feel awful about it all, but he can’t, not when Sherlock is here and he
“That’s only because you took the edge off,” Sherlock clarifies, and he is so close to whispering in John’s ear, he thinks he might burst on the spot if Sherlock keeps talking. “Of course, I certainly wasn’t coherent at all when you had your mouth around my-”
John smiles at him: he’d been hoping Sherlock would say that. Ever since Sherlock had mentioned how he’d raided Snapes closet, John had been thinking about how exciting it must have been, the thrill of sneaking around, stealing from Snape (he’d feel absolutely no guilt over that), and praying he wouldn’t get caught. It sounded like mad fun. “I’m in.”
“Not bad, Watson,” Snape admits, which is high praise coming from their annoyingly fastidious professor. “Perhaps you should make a habit of sitting next to Mr. Holmes given these… surprising results.”
John looks at him, raising an eyebrow expectantly. “I think you should be on your way now, Anderson.”
But for some reason, it would appear he
Tonight is between he and Sherlock. He knows he can’t go back to Mary now, he couldn’t. Not when he’s felt what it’s like to have Sherlock’s body so close to his own, had the taste of Sherlock’s lips on his tongue. No. Now that he knows Sherlock wants him, there’s no going back for him. So, no matter what happens tonight, his future with Mary has already been upended: it’s over.
“Sherlock, we’ve practically been all around London, and you can barely stand up straight,” John reasons.
? John clears his throat, averting his eyes, his own cheeks heating, and he brings a hand up to scratch the back of his head unconsciously.
They should talk. They really, really should. But John can’t risk this, can’t stand the idea of ruining things and not even getting tonight. They can talk later.
“God, you’re insufferable.” John kisses him before Sherlock can protest or attest to John’s own insufferable behaviour and drags them through the bedroom door. Sherlock is making quick work of his clothes, unbuttoning his shirt and pushing it past his shoulders until the material hits the ground. He finds that spot behind John’s left ear, the one that makes his knees go weak and how does he even
John pushes all thoughts of Mary and his cancelled engagement to the far side of his mind, grounding himself in the present. Even with all the alcohol they’ve consumed tonight, John can still make out the exquisite smell of Sherlock’s cologne and he has to repress a shiver that threatens to make its way down his spine as his body responds to the familiar odor. It’s a heady mix of cinnamon and green apples, fresh and clean and so god damn enticing, John thinks at this rate he might even have to stop breathing through his nose if he wants to keep from spontaneously combusting from pure, next-to-unbearable want in the back of a taxi.
“Thursday evening?” Sherlock suggests, making it sound like a question though he already knows it would be the best time in John’s schedule considering all his classes and Quidditch. It’s Tuesday today. He can wait two days.
John sniggers and gives him a mischievous smile. “The less I know the better, then,” John grins and Sherlock finds himself smiling back. He thinks of what it might be like to have John at his side the next time he sneaks around the castle after curfew and finds that, oddly, he isn’t at all opposed to the idea. He might even like it.
Thank you to every one who left comments and kudos, you have no idea how happy you've made me! Thank you for joining me on this lovely potterlock ride, it was so much fun to write and to share with you. I'd love to know what you thought of this last chapter and the story over all.
"I know"
John scoffed, rolling his eyes as he turned the page, he didn't want to read about it, especially considering it was most likely Lestrade or Molly who had spoken to the paper - they would be more than happy to tell the world.
"I don't even know what you want to say, how on earth am I supposed to know you can't?"
He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, a small smile on his lips as he held her. And John could feel his eyes welling up, he had no idea what would happen today but to see this picture in front of him warmed his heart. This one moment proved how much they had missed out on whilst Sherlock was away, they could have been so close - best friends, even.
"You do realise that even if I didn't meet you, I still would have met Mary and eventually someone would have came to find her. And if it wasn't for you, finding them, hunting them down and stopping them, there would be a strong chance that myself, Mary and possibly Rosie wouldn't be here today. We lost Mary because of her past Sherlock, not because of you"
Four hours later and to say Sherlock had changed was an understatement, John had thought the old Sherlock had vanished - that was until now, he had already retrieved knives, printed photos and records and pinned each one to John's living room wall. It was soon becoming Baker Street, minute by minute.
"Okay" He interrupted her "You want to meet Sherlock?"
I suppose, this is the end of this fic. Sherlock and John have to come to terms of their new found relationship and life, John is scared, sherlock is worse and Rosie, can't wait for them to get out of the house.
"I give it six months. You'll get bored of it, you always do. You used to get bored after a few hours without a case, you'll never last"
Before Sherlock could comprehend the whole situation, he suddenly had John Watson wrapped around his thighs, his fingers laced through his hair and his lips moulding with his own. John's lips were on his and full of hunger, Sherlock could barely keep up with the way his teeth clasped down on his bottom lip or how his tongue darted out to clasp onto his own. All he could do was allow a sweet moan to fall from his own mouth, practically gasping at the way it pushed John into extreme lust.
