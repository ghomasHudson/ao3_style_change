Their dinner was lovely, and all the more appreciated for the long wait leading up to it. They talked and laughed together for over two hours, dining with indulgent slowness: sharing appetisers, and drawing out the meal with wine and dessert. When the waiter came with their sweet kulfi and strong coffee, John ordered a meal to carry home to Sherlock, thus giving them the excuse to stretch the pleasant evening even further...but eventually, Sherlock's takeaway arrived, and they migrated outside to say their goodbyes.
He nodded and agreed, "Yeah, a little. But London never stays all that quiet for very long. I'm sure something new will crop up soon to keep him satisfied."
He froze the memory in a still frame as John's incongruous voice pushed warmly into the scene. Surprising himself in the next instant, Sherlock wrapped the pub up safely and filed it away with deliberate care, before turning back to his friend in the present.
"But he never got to take the guy down," Sally finished. "He probably never even knew for sure whether he was right."
Anna did want to laugh, just a little, but she couldn't exactly dispute her friend's claim. Andy Hardwick had lived here; he'd struggled with his addiction here; he'd hidden messages in the very
Anna Clark—who in that perfect, crystalline moment turned fully to face Sherlock, beaming at him with an expression of pure acceptance and understanding.
Drink in hand, he noticed that a plate of Mrs Hudson's cranberry scones had been left on the worktop; the stretched cling film stood up higher than the empty plate in two places.
disappointing, but the logical side of her brain was in complete agreement with her bladder, and both were warning vehemently against any sudden moves.
They stood and switched places; Greg peeked through the crack briefly, then put his ear to it instead.
Sally paused with her hand on the door. "I'll have something for you on Beaux within the hour," she promised.
Blondy spat another incomprehensible taunt into his face, this time reaching out without warning and twisting John's aching nose roughly between thumb and forefinger.
Greg's stomach lurched; with the mention of the lead counterfeiter, his shock over Sherlock had immediately been replaced by a wave of unpleasant guilt. He sucked down a large gulp of tea to cover the reaction.
"Oh. Oh, my lordy. Well, that's certainly..." The man's eyes were wide, and he wrung his hands in an unconscious gesture of concern. "Of course, of course I can get you the access. Just, er, give me some time to figure out the arrangements. Would tonight at eight be okay?"
Sherlock slipped the phone back into his pocket, frowning. The reply he'd sent had been distinctly ill-matched to the message he'd received, but he'd had to expend considerable effort not to write something unpleasant. If Lestrade took this as a moderately confusing dismissal, at least he was unlikely to find it insulting.
This seemed to make a natural break in the conversation; Sherlock allowed her to work in peace for a minute or two, appreciating the silence. Quiet of any kind at the Yard was a rare commodity, and it held an appeal that was entirely separate from the quiet at home. There, in the times when John was at work and Mrs Hudson was away with her ladies' club—as it was this afternoon—silent rooms sometimes took on a stifling constriction. Here, every lull in the shifting murmuration of the office was a promise of calm before action, a virtuous readiness.
the stops laying into him!" John set the mobile aside and got to his feet. "Tea? I'd offer you more, but..."
Greg knew quite well how small hurts could grow and fester with time and distance. Bringing Anna to live here would give her mother a surfeit of both...
"All right, all right, keep yer trousers on," he muttered, setting his chef's knife aside and wiping his hands off as quickly as he could. He'd left his mobile on the far end of the worktop peninsula, on the dining room side; he jogged around to reach it and pulled out a stool there to sit as he answered, sing-song. "Hello, hello!"
"I wouldn't have pegged them for yours, either. Don't you have staff, for this sort of thing? Personal shopping service?"
Rapists, kidnappers, abusers, torturers. Murder in seemingly every form possible...though there was always something new waiting to be witnessed, something awful and unexpected to turn his stomach and make Sherlock hop for giddy joy. Greg took comfort in his work, anywhere he could—the knowledge that each solved case and each convicted perpetrator was one more victory on the side of justice in his city; the faith that his efforts, his long hours, and his frequent bone-deep exhaustion all had the chance to make a difference. He tallied up saved lives and their potentialities against the gruesome images in his head, when he found himself too wound up for sleep.
, Sherlock, it was a misunderstanding and your text message didn't come through 'til it was too late..."
that story. I hear about it every time she sees me so much as sniffle! She tell you that happened sixteen years ago, five years before
And, there: that was the crux of it, the painful paradox that closed his throat when he tried to find honest words to offer in return for Anna's selfless trust...because sentiment was a double-sided trap. Sentiment was a comfort he'd learned to crave, and the further he slipped down into its habits, the more of its distraction he desired...
been in it for good, as far as I hear. Sally told me a story last summer about how Bert had to drag you off a case, because you wouldn't stop to get over your 'flu..."
"Go and brush your teeth," Sherlock instructed with perfect calm. "I'll fetch a glass of water for your pain medication."
"Not for a few hours, anyway. I told him we needed some time, tonight, you and I." The phone beeped in response to something John had done, and his mouth twisted to one side. "Damn. I know I had to get a new one regardless, but it would've been nice to have the old one to transfer data from! Count yourself lucky you didn't have to go phone shopping this week."
Sherlock returned his attention to the present day, and the man in front of him. He frowned. "Thirteen and a half months. To be precise."
Her jet lag was nearly conquered, at this point; the dragging fatigue was gone, leaving only a tendency to wake up at erratic hours, suddenly alert to every little noise. The not-exactly-quiet soundscape of pre-dawn London, audible here in the comfortable darkness of the bedroom, was so different than the sounds she'd woken to outside her Chicago house when she'd lived there. It was amazing to her that two large cities could feel so distinct, that the very
"What—yes! Yes, of course you can. I mean, you'd have to decide where things go, if you do...assuming I don't send so much random crap you just get buried in it..." Anna grimaced, thinking of the tedious work she and Liz had undertaken to sort out her things. It turned out that Anna still harboured some packrat tendencies; while her friend was enthusiastic about helping out, she was far less skilled at convincing Anna to part with things than she was at providing emotional advice.
So John did the only thing he could do, given that he was still sitting astride Sherlock's lap and only partially wearing pants and was still flushed with excitement from his performance. He leaned forward until he was millimeters from Sherlock's face, and they felt their breath mingle. Their eyes fixed upon each other with simmering desire and -
“John, I see no reason to stir from my own comfortable hearth for anything less than a double homicide with extraordinary circumstances. Certainly not for the dubious privilege of attending some pompous aristo mating rite in Brompton Oratory.”
"No, John. I was searching for a way to make my apologies without words, without creating any of my usual misunderstandings. I needed to ensure that I could always make things right again."
" - I know you're furious with me...” Sherlock continued in his special calm and condescending tone.
Thus John came home to find a serene and relaxed Sherlock lying on the sofa in his Thinking Position.
Both our lives began all over again then, John thought, on a night when all of London was ours and everything was possible. He felt abruptly overcome with a hot rush of emotion that made him bury his face in Sherlock's neck.
"I... yes, well. Fine. I guess. Warm. Tingly? Uh..." He explored his tender lips with tentative fingers.
But at the 5-second mark John began to thaw, just the slightest bit: Sherlock felt him relax and drop his shoulders. As Sherlock began nibbling very gently on his lower lip, John's heart began beating faster.
“No, wait! I’d like to try, if you don’t mind it being a learning experience for me. Perhaps you had best sit in my chair, it’s not as likely to collapse under our weight.”  Sherlock tugged John up from the armchair, and positioned him in his own leather chair.
“Sherlock, LET ME UP!” John pushed and shoved at him until Sherlock leaned/half-fell off his lap onto the floor.
“John, cupcakes are wholly irrelevant to me but I ate it to please you, and since I am marginally fonder of pink sprinkles than I am of chocolate icing I merely chose the one I preferred. Stop whinging, it’s not as if I ate BOTH of them.”
Then Sherlock slowly, gradually began to rock from side to side on John’s lap, humming faintly to some internal tune. John found the sensations quite pleasurable, and he closed his eyes and began to enjoy himself. This was not nearly as unsexy as he’d feared.
However, John wasn't inclined to express his love for Sherlock with such romantic gestures: the stoic Captain Watson's deepest feelings were demonstrated in gifts of service, loyalty, steadfastness and bravery. John followed Sherlock into the darkest, most dangerous places without a thought for himself, risked his life and health (and sanity) daily, and believed in Sherlock in times when everyone else turned away. But there were no flowers, no sweets, no Valentines. And John was utter balls at gift-buying, forever doing his Christmas shopping in Tesco at the very last minute, or picking up some daft thing at the corner newsagent.
Sherlock sighed in response. “Oh very well. Tell me what it is you want and I will endeavour to deliver.”
Sherlock looked around him, seeing nothing more or less erotic than the sitting room in its normal disarray with all of the lights on, the skull grinning at them from the mantel, and both of them fully clothed.
How gratifyingly ironic that Sherlock now followed him as they moved together across the sitting room floor.
Sherlock held up one long forefinger to halt the conversation while he consulted his notebook again.
"Precisely. Making you angry is absurdly easy; I wanted to see how quickly it could be reversed. And now I have my answer - 30 seconds."
“I swear I will never eat Branston pickle before bed again. Tossed and turned all night. Probably talked in my sleep too, sorry about that.”
"A few seconds of your time, John, and I won't ask for anything beyond that. Just accommodate me in this and there is no further obligation."
And when John felt extra-chilly during the night, he found the coat hanging out of the open bathroom window absorbing the currents of vehicular air that drifted down Baker Street.
Sherlock could be heard singing in the shower, his rich smoky voice drifting out on clouds of steam: “ '…In the hush of night while you're in my arms, I feel your lips so warm and tender…' ”
“Sherlock, calm down. Yes, it smells a little…unpleasant right now, but it just wants airing out. Besides, it’s not nearly as pervasive and objectionable as formaldehyde.”
Well now. That was actually rather virile when one came right down to it: “Standing strong…pointing toward eternity…” Awkwardly expressed, of course, but not exactly something one would write to a girlfriend.
And because Sherlock - all evidence to the contrary - was human as well. And because human nature is inherently faulty and imperfect. And because, despite the great analytical brain he possessed, it was perhaps too easy to overlook the part of Sherlock Holmes that was still an awkward 12-year-old full of unfamiliar feelings and frightening emotions, whose best friend was his chemistry set and who found all of his answers about life in science books.
“Say it in French and I will.” John served Sherlock his egg. Sherlock glared at him and stabbed it with a fork, right in the middle of the yolk.
He tried energy drinks, but they upset his stomach. He tried drinking powdered chili pepper in water, popping ginseng capsules, rubbing his temples with lavender and mint balm. He tried Midol. He would have tried one of Mrs. Hudson’s herbal soothers but she refused to share.
First John found it wadded up in the refrigerator’s vegetable drawer along with an aromatic bag of thumbs.
John stood up and took a menacing step toward him, hands clenched with a massive urge to circle Sherlock's neck and squeeze it until he turned blue.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, knowing he was about to step off a cliff. The whisky had muted the guardian of his brain and tongue; he was dangerously close to revealing a long-concealed secret. But this was John, a man he trusted above all others, one with whom he could share the deepest mysteries of his heart.
There was pouting. Days of pouting. John ruthlessly consigned Sherlock’s sugar-coated drug hoard to Mrs. Hudson’s bins, and heavy emotional weather descended on 221B. Sherlock was alternately manic and withdrawn, demanding Malteasers and sulking when denied. John largely ignored him and spent increasing amounts of time in his old room. He reproached himself for bringing those sweets into the flat in the first place – he should have realized he was tempting a known addict with a controlled substance.
Or perhaps that unforgettable incident in the Scottish Highlands, in a particularly scratchy patch of heather…
Sherlock’s manic good humor annoyed John no end: all this ridiculous fuss about a piece of clothing. “Married to his coat” indeed. And his insistence in banging on about how that relationship predated John Watson, The Blogger Whom The Great Detective Could Not Get Along Without. John did not fancy being a part of some weird wardrobe-centered romantic triangle.
Sherlock dived behind a pile of books, flung the sofa cushions about, scattered papers far and wide. There were none to be found. Not one tiny solitary crunchy and delectable chocolate-covered sugar-filled Malteaser was left in all of 221B Baker Street.
John came home hours later with a white plastic carrier bag of takeaway curry and an improved attitude. Annoyingly Happy Sherlock was far less irritating than Tediously Whiny Sherlock, he had decided. And if Sherlock’s coat was something of a security blanket for him, then so be it. It might be just the one thing that was keeping him (relatively) sane, and who was John to judge him for that.
“I'm sorry, but I’m finding this almost too difficult to believe. Are you sure I’m getting the whole story here?” He fixed Sherlock with his keen bullshit-detecting gaze.
But Sherlock just went on writing and muttering, and John sat down again, suddenly drained of anger as well as any remaining after-effects of the 30-second snog.
First he brought home an ulster, the garment beloved of many Victorian gentlemen: a long, dramatic overcoat with shoulder cape.
“Of course I’ve had it cleaned! Mrs. Hudson usually works miracles with her clothes-steamer and something she calls ‘Persil’.”
“John, we have never had any kind of special song, soundtrack, background music, advert jingle or ringtone to circumscribe our lives, because you and I have wildly divergent tastes in music, and we abide here in a spirit of compromise, which is why there are headphones in this flat. I love you in spite of Queens of the Stone Age, not because of them.”
John only ever wrote him notes about tedious things like laundry and shopping, severed heads in the fridge and eyeballs in the microwave. Back in the day when he’d still had girlfriends, John composed treacly love poems on the laptop, then carefully wrote them out by hand before folding them lovingly and slipping them into a box of chocolates or a pretty bouquet. Sherlock would have died before admitting how much he coveted those little love-offerings. He had openly scoffed at the chocolates and flowers and sentimental verse, yet Sherlock secretly longed for some tangible evidence of John’s affection.
“A bit,” John replied absently. “I really would love to dance with you at that wedding, Sherlock. I’m just not sure I can find anything we both agree on.”
John was elated to be one-up on Sherlock - this was like having kryptonite with which to counteract Sherlock's vast array of mental superpowers.
But something still nagged at John: why had he kept this such a secret? Sherlock loved to boast of his baritsu skills, his head-butting prowess, his narrow escapes from death and dismemberment. And…Greece? When had Sherlock ever been in Greece? And Irene Adler definitely didn't want to kill him, she wanted to…
Finally the long-awaited day arrived. John slid out of bed without waking Sherlock, walked up the street to the dry cleaner and redeemed the coat. He brought it home and laid it across the sofa so that it would be the first thing Sherlock saw when he got up.
“You obviously escaped with your life. But are you in danger now? Has someone come back to finish the job?” John was beginning to feel dangerously excited at this prospect. Drink was re-igniting the adrenaline surge of the previous case, and his craving for action was returning with a vengeance. He wondered whether his service pistol was still loaded.
“John, I did say this was going to be a learning experience, but that’s no reason to… Well, it WAS a dance!” he protested.
“Sherlock…it’s a coat. It’s not your best mate, most definitely not. Now if you don’t mind, I'm trying to read.”
“Now – do I need any instruments, tools, props? I’m assuming no special clothing is required….there’s plenty of light for you to get a good view…. All right, let’s begin!”
“There’s no point in my getting dressed,” Sherlock said. “My coat’s not here, and I don’t feel dressed without my coat even if I choose to not
Sherlock stared at the paper, ignoring John’s expectant face. He flipped it back and forth, frontwards and backwards, just to make sure he hadn’t overlooked anything resembling a poem.
“When it came to me the coat was already permeated with the smells of the chemistry lab, the hot scorch of steam radiators in the lecture rooms, and petrol and river water and a hint of Penhaligon’s Bayolea, which he customarily used after shaving. That simply can’t be duplicated,” Sherlock said, as though explaining something to a remarkably backward child.
He looked over at Sherlock, who had slid so far down in his leather chair that his arse was almost on the floor. He certainly didn't behave as though he felt he was in any great danger. Then again, Sherlock never did.
Of course John knew all the dirty French stuff – those are the first things any schoolboy learns, and John had made good use of this knowledge in his younger days (well, he’d gotten a few face slaps too, but on average his technique had seemed to work well in pubs and at Uni parties). He could not wait to try it on with Sherlock.
“Just look at you, you idiot. Lying there flat on your back covered in bandages, zonked on painkillers, because you would NOT listen. Oh no, the great Sherlock Holmes always works alone! Why the hell would you listen to ME, I’m only a soldier with years of training. By all means, just go barging right through, no worries, I’ll be standing back here with our only firearm…
“No, John, I’m doing well.” He rolled up his sleeves to display his bare arms. No nicotine patches. John was satisfied. Sherlock was deviously content.
"And I did get something out of that. A 30-second lesson in humility – a concept with which I am not completely familiar. As you know.”
“Please enlighten me, John, because nothing offends me and I prefer you to be clear about your wants and desires, no matter how peculiar, absurd or generally weird they may be.”
“But even so…  here I am sitting by your hospital bed holding your hand and pretending I’m just taking your pulse. Because this is a rare opportunity to tell you, without any interruption,  how completely I love you. I have never regretted one moment of our lives together. And if anything should ever happen to you, my own life would be worth less than nothing.
Amid the screeching and smoking of the bedroom battlefield, BAMF Captain John Watson of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers turned and fired on Sherlock.
“John, not only is that garment a sartorial insult to humanity, but I believe you may be making some sort of veiled comment about my obsessive tendencies. I
“It’s not a nursery rhyme, it’s the days of the week in French. Something I learned at school when I was a wee young lad.”
Sherlock winked at him. “Just that one line reminds me of you.” He sang: “ ‘And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart…' ”
"AND you've destroyed my favorite tea mug," Sherlock remarked. "But since I'm more than willing to bring this unfortunate episode to a conclusion, I ask that you do only one thing for me in return."
By the 25-second mark John was fully engaged: body pressed hard against Sherlock's, hands buried in Sherlock's hair. His brain had replaced negative thoughts with feelings of exhilaration, warmth and desire, and he’d already forgotten anything that happened before the moment Sherlock took him into his arms.
John was glad to see that the sitting room was deserted, and faint snoring told him Sherlock was likely to be occupied for some time yet. He opened his laptop. Argh, this was bloody awful. What had he been thinking? Up too late last night plus too much cognac equaled some very sappy doggerel. This would never do.
“John, although you know that I love to dance and have acquired more than adequate skill in both traditional ballroom and ballet dance forms, I must confess that I know little about folk dancing. But if it will make you happy, then I am very willing to learn more.”
“SPEAKING OF ‘UNSAID’!” Sherlock shouted. He threw off the headphones and flopped down on the sofa with a cushion over his head. John ignored the outburst and lifted Sherlock's feet to remove some old newspapers.
The long kiss had flooded his body with an intoxicating biochemical cocktail of hormones, neurotransmitters and endorphins that lit up his pleasure centers like a pinball machine, and John Watson whirled about in the middle of a sexy, emotional, chemically-charged brain party.
“Lapp dance? Traditional folkdance of the nomadic Sami people? You are perhaps planning a holiday in Finland?” Sherlock asked.
John looked at him with sudden surprise. “You don’t speak French!” he said, astonished to discover something else he knew that the great Sherlock Holmes did not.
"I have formulated a theory, but in order to test it I first had to make you angry. And this provocation had to take place somewhere you wouldn't be likely to cause a scene - "
John pursed his lips and did some deducing of his own. Sherlock was clearly mortified at having been proved wrong, but why would he be upset because there was no birthday poem? Sherlock hated his poetry!
“I definitely have voicemail,“ John said triumphantly, and turned up the volume on his mobile so that Sherlock's recorded voice filled the cab with song: “It’s very clear, our love is here to stay…”
Horrors. “Treacle” did not even begin to describe this blob of mawkish twaddle. It rivaled the outpourings of a love-struck middle schooler, written in pink ink in a boy-band notebook. Oh John.
John’s laughter filled the kitchen, bounced off the walls, pounded Sherlock's ears. He sat stony-faced as he always did on the rare occasions when John laughed AT him - silent and resentful. Finally he assumed his usual defensive, elaborately-unconcerned expression. “John, I think my little joke has escaped you entirely,” he said stiffly. “Nevertheless, thank you for your thoughtful gift.”
Drifting from the speakers was a dreamy, jazzy composition with a romantic vocal backed by  the warm underlying notes of a saxophone.
Sherlock then refused to speak to him until tea time, when John reached across the table and put a dab of jam on his nose. “Tu seras mon dessert ce soir.” [
John simmered with fury but held his tongue. Sherlock was right - it was much too easy to rile him. He would not let Sherlock win a contest of wills. Again.
“I was in Greece on a family holiday…” Sherlock began in a annoyed tone. “I was walking through a street market. A …WASP… flew up the leg of my shorts and stung me."
20 seconds... Blood vessels dilated all over John's body, suffusing him with a faint flush and making every nerve end burn like a lighted fuse. His breath came faster. He shifted his weight against Sherlock and his clutching hands pulled Sherlock's shirt right out of his trousers.
"Or rather - let me kiss you. You need do nothing but stand there," Sherlock said, as though this was the most reasonable request in the world.
“John, it’s been plainly evident that you have been writing a birthday poem for me, although you concealed it so badly that you may as well have published it on the front page of the Daily Mail. The poem! ‘Winds of tomorrow, shadow on the shining land…’? ” He waved the paper around in exasperated confusion.
John flexed his knees and knelt astride Sherlock's lap, moving forward and back, teasing Sherlock with the closeness and the heat of his body.
“And 30 seconds of very unscientific bliss with the man I love. I only regret I took such a roundabout way to get there.”
“Dammit Sherlock. You promised me you were quitting those fucking things. They’ll kill you! And think of your TEETH. Spit them out.” He held out his hand.
“It’s very simple, John. After I detoxed I realized that I needed to replace my destructive habits with something more positive but equally as compelling. Something to occupy me while my brain is in overdrive, and yet allow me to maintain the razor-sharp focus I need for deduction. An energizing surge of adrenaline and endorphins coupled with a warm afterglow of well-being. Something positive, pleasurable, easily accessible and calorie-free. Something that won’t isolate me from you. In fact, you are an integral part of my new plan.”
Sherlock glared malevolently and gave a huge convulsive swallow, sending a tsunami of sugar into his system and depriving John of his annoying moral superiority.
Depression settled in like a dense London fog. Day after day, Sherlock lay coiled in his chair, pretzel-like, mournfully staring at the doorway as if expecting his coat to come waltzing through it at any moment. He looked like a patient dog waiting for the return of his absent owner.
The sugar hit his bloodstream full-force and suffused him with the warming glow of a chemical high.  He frantically searched the pockets of all John’s clothes until he found another packet, and he wolfed that down as well. Ahhhhh.  Nearly as good as nicotine patches! Now if only he had one more …
“No, dear, I gave the last of mine to John when he was looking for something to nibble on. Would a sesame and fig bite do?”
Which of course only made the stubborn detective more determined to not admit he’d been bested at something, particularly by John Smart-Arse Watson.
After a stunned moment John began to laugh. He laughed so hard he choked on his tea and nearly upset his mug onto the scones.
During the rest of the day, John took exceptional glee in sneaking up on Sherlock and whispering some filthy little phrase in his ear, then enjoying his slow burn of annoyance. Oh, that pouty face! John felt he was finally putting paid to all those times when Sherlock had flaunted his fund of esoteric knowledge. Sodding showoff.
Sherlock lay wakeful and preoccupied, his fingers tented and tapping against one another. Faint illumination from the streetlight filtered into the bedroom and an insistent little breath of cold air leaked in through the loose window frame. He stared at the ceiling and turned over and over in his mind the case of the previous day.
Sherlock smiled, knowing perfectly well why John had chosen this particular song. It told of a magical London night, two people in love, their excitement and confusion, the stars and the moon and first kisses. It was ideal for a dance at a wedding. Even someone else’s.
But before very long Sherlock craved both the intense high and the relative calm that came with satisfying his addiction; now there were no soothing mood changes to anticipate, no flashes of substance-induced insight, and he didn't know what to do with his hands.
When John Watson was in a good mood he liked to sing. He moved around the flat singing in his light baritone while making tea in the kitchen, tidying up the bedroom, classifying Sherlock's vast collection of books. Most of the time he didn't even realize he was doing it aloud, and most of the time Sherlock simply smiled with amusement.
He read it over once more, searching for any possible shred of redeeming value. What on earth could all this mean?
But John was hardly mollified. “Oh, you think so? Well cheers, mate, I did a bloody brilliant job for you.” He looked down at Sherlock's lap. “Quite obviously.”
Sherlock silently cut up his egg and toast, looking as though he wished John could be called away to a medical emergency. Immediately.
John clasped Sherlock closer, and felt Sherlock’s answering pressure. Their dance became a long, swaying embrace.
John felt Sherlock's long body relax into his as they danced. How could he possibly forget that smile, on the evening of the day they met: the smile that turned Sherlock's angular face into a poignant combination of hesitation, happiness and hope. The firm clasp of his hand. His careless assumption that whatever he asked or demanded, John would consent and follow.
John put every last thing he had into the final line of the song, flinging his arms wide and throwing the newspapers in the air. Then he collapsed with a huge sigh on the end of the sofa near Sherlock's feet.
“Well…I’d like…a lap dance. From you.” John’s face flushed with a bit of excitement and shy embarrassment.
Storming restlessly about the flat one day, he spied a small red paper packet … doubtless one of John’s little indulgences, he had such a sweet tooth. Hmm, Malteasers. An inane play on words, but they looked promising enough: chocolate spheroids of crisp honeycomb covered with a smooth chocolate shell. Sherlock popped one into his mouth. The first satisfying bite, breaking through the thick sweet crust into a little universe of crunchiness. Then he popped another. Then he gobbled the rest.
John, who had seen every inch of Sherlock's naked body and then some, tried to remember any mysterious unexplained scars, and came up vacant. Maybe it was psychological damage? That would certainly explain a few things.
“Dear Sherlock: I tried and failed to come up with a suitable gift for your birthday, but if you will accept this IOU I promise to make it up to you later. With best birthday wishes and fondest love, John.”
“Yes, indeed, John, I am perfection in human form. Never have I felt better, more focused, more acute in my observations. No cigarettes, no nicotine patches, no sugar highs for me – I am now clean and free of foreign substances. You did me the greatest favor of my life by throwing away the poison that was destroying me. Thank you.”
"In short - I postulated that a 30-second kiss would be sufficient to defuse and cancel out anger and to induce a response of warmth, attraction, love and bonding." Sherlock ticked a line in his notebook.
Sherlock felt the vibration of John’s voice echo through his breastbone. He closed his eyes, knowing that John would safely guide him around the furniture and over the edges of the rugs, would telegraph the next turn and glide with his body. There had never been so much certainty in his life, nor such trust in one who held him close.
“Sherlock, you always laughed so mercilessly at my poetry. And you ridiculed the flowers, the Valentines – what else was I to think? You were not the most demonstrative of men either, at least in my experience. God forbid I should embarrass you with any sticky displays of affection. So I just suppressed all those foolish impulses to fill your pockets with love notes and cover the bed with rose petals.”
“If you…had music...” Sherlock whispered. “My favorite is…’You Sexy Thing’… by a group I believe is called... Hot Chocolate?” After which he could not hold it in any longer, and a smile cracked his face. His body heaved with barely suppressed laughter.
"...I am not putting up with any more of your unwelcome, ill-timed info-dumps.” He slammed a mug on the table for emphasis.
So when a parade of plain brown Amazon boxes began arriving at 221B, Sherlock explained them away as “books”, “laboratory supplies” and once as a pick-and-mix assortment of carbuncles. Sherlock's closet was soon crammed with Malteasers: individual packs for on-the-go, multi-packs for out of town cases, quantity buckets for home use. Problem solved. All was well. Sherlock remained placid, John was grateful, and no one was the wiser.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, but there were…body fluids on it, and that’s not good for anyone, least of all the coat. And you couldn’t possibly ask Mrs. Hudson to deal with those.”
“John, please. I just let the joke go too far, and… all right, that was quite unkind of me. And yes – you did a brilliant job. Very, very sexy.”
On his birthday morning Sherlock came yawning into the kitchen to find two steaming mugs of tea, plus a plate of warm scones sent up by Mrs. Hudson. John was cheerful and congratulatory.
He looked at his lover’s pouting face, the handwritten note, and replayed Sherlock's jab about his “flawed thinking” - and suddenly understood that what Sherlock really wanted, but could not bear to ask for, was simply to be wooed. With all the romantic trimmings.
“John, if you can come up with something suitable that we both agree could possibly be ‘our song’, then I will consent to dress and behave appropriately and attend this odious wedding and dance with you. Now, I like romantic standards and anything I can waltz to. No cheesy pop songs, no film clichés, or anything that has the word ‘booty’ anywhere in it, and NO Bee Gees. That ought to give you plenty to work with.”
"John, you are extremely skilled at communicating the exact level of your displeasure, most often by the relative force with which you slam the bedroom door."
Sherlock prepared to do the best acting job of his life. He devoutly hoped he wouldn’t laugh: John was about to pour out his awkwardly-phrased feelings for him at last, and Sherlock had learned enough by now to know that ridiculing someone’s feelings was A Bit Not Good. Luckily there were plenty of decapitated nuns in the Mind Palace to think about, just in case the situation required instant decorum.
The only illumination came from the streetlights outside, filtering through the net curtains. John’s half-naked body was dappled with shadows and his Y-fronts gleamed whitely in the dusk. He stepped up onto the chair seat and planted his feet on either side of Sherlock's thighs, rocking from one foot to the other and wearing a provocative expression.
The music stopped. Sherlock and John stopped. And for an immeasurable moment in 221B Baker Street, time stopped too.
“Spot-on, Dr. Watson. Well. Done. You.” Sherlock said peevishly. He detested it when John laughed at him.
There was one moment of complete, utter silence and confusion before John erupted with riotous laughter.
His response, however, would demand some serious acting skill when John eventually presented him with this birthday gift.
“Sherlock, I’ve got some very nice-looking kale, and some carrots, and I thought soup might be…what are you doing.”
15 seconds... By now John was making contented little sounds (Sherlock loved those little sounds) and his hands rested on Sherlock's waist. When Sherlock escalated the pressure and added a little body English, John’s knees trembled.
John said nothing. He couldn’t be blamed for letting Sherlock hang out there for a moment: he was only human, and he was hurt. He looked down at Sherlock, who was resting his forearms on John's thighs, fidgeting with the edge of John's jumper.
Out of the companionable silence John spoke: “Sherlock….tell me something you've never told anyone else before.”
Sherlock had given up the cigarettes long ago, but now that the nicotine patches irritated his skin, he had decided to try going cold turkey (again) and vanquish his dependence issues once and for all. John was so proud of him.
“Sherlock, you are going to have to choose: it’s either me, or a slow miserable death by malt extract, cocoa butter and glucose syrup.”
"You're not my petri dish. You're a man, and a human being, and you are my love, my conscience, my other half. My better half. You did nothing to deserve that. And I would not have you angry with me for all the world.”
Sherlock didn't come home. He wasn’t with Lestrade, he wasn’t with Molly (either standing over a morgue slab or lying on one). Mycroft was less than helpful. John slept in his chair, waiting and hoping and filled with remorse. He wondered whether Sherlock was holed up in some drug den of Malteaser-mainliners, or hanging around street corners trying to bribe primary schoolers to score him some sugar.
Sherlock opened the bottle and set free the aromatic scents of citrus, spices and woods to float around the sitting room. He dabbed a bit of it under his lapels and pocket flaps. Then he smiled and executed a gleeful, graceful coat twirl.
Then he sat down on a particularly lumpy section of the sofa, and discovered the coat had been crushed under the cushions to collect all of the litter and debris that sifted out of their pockets.
“And allow you to run it through Google Translate? Nope. You’ll just have to enjoy it in audio mode.”
Sherlock began humming loudly but failed to drown out John’s performance. John leaned over Sherlock's shoulder and reached for some stray tea mugs.
John bustled around the kitchen making tea and toad-in-the-hole for breakfast. He sang while he worked, just a little tune under his breath: “Lundi, Mardi, Mer-cre-di…Jeudi, Vendredi…Samedi, Dimaaanche…”
John just shook his head and exhaled softly. He was utterly out of sorts with Sherlock's continual whining.
But today was not that day. John was in fine voice and that voice was shredding Sherlock's last nerve.
“I believe I will,“ Sherlock said. He seldom drank: his vices were few and alcohol was not one of them. But at the successful conclusion of a case, in the late-night glow of accomplishment and celebration, perhaps a whisky was just the thing one needed.
“My favorite one is ‘avoir la patate’, or ‘to have the potato’. Meaning, to feel exceptionally good.”
John just gave him a wink and a smug smile. “Well, I think you’re missing out, but that’s your loss, mon amour.”
Nothing could satisfy Sherlock - he continued to be a bloody-minded git and to swan around in his dressing gown wallowing in his misery. John gave up trying to please him and slept on the far side of the bed with a pillow over his head to muffle all the plaintive sighs.
Being in a cab with Sherlock frequently meant being trapped with his theories and his obsessions, but now it was even worse because John was also trapped with Sherlock's wedding dance suggestions.
“Now don’t be angry. Let’s kiss and make up.” Sherlock adopted his little-lost-puppy expression which generally worked on John when nothing else did.
“John, you are disturbing the entire street with this vocal recital. Mrs. Hudson will be pounding on the ceiling with her broom again.”
But John could not resist. It was so seldom that he had the advantage on Sherlock, he was loath to give it up.
And although John couldn’t see it now, Sherlock’s smile was the very same one he'd worn that night: the smile which had begun unlocking John Watson’s frozen heart, and perhaps his own as well.
“Dr. Bell made me a gift of the coat when he retired to Provence to paint watercolors and farm olive trees. He said he thought I’d have more need of it now than he did.”
Inside the envelope was a folded piece of paper. In John’s awkward slanting handwriting was written:
In the morning, after Sherlock had unlocked the bedroom door and emerged from his self-imposed humiliation exile, he found John in the kitchen eating a greasy fry-up and looking none the worse for his late night. Sherlock shot him a look of disgust while searching for something to ease his hangover.
“Now this is your own fault, Sherlock, you shouldn’t have been snooping in my laptop,” John said, still chuckling.
" - because I needed to gauge your increasing irritation against your heightened determination to resist, and I correctly deduced that you'd elect to put up with the intensification of negative stimuli rather than to deny yourself the potential pleasure of seeing the film. Then I escalated the pressure and ate your popcorn. Well, not 'ate' exactly - I just dumped most of it on the floor."
He handed Sherlock a small black and white package. Penhaligon’s Bayolea: the hallmark scent of the traditional English gentleman.
“No! But John, what it needs is some olfactory rehabilitation - that will restore its former glory!”
“Sherlock – " John was wheezing with laughter. “Sherlock, that wasn't intended for you - it was a cryptography exercise! Codes, ciphers, first letter of every word…? Like the London A-Z book? It was for a blog post!" He laughed till tears came.
Furthermore, doesn’t he know the color of my eyes by now? I’m not the one with eyes like the infinite blue of the heavens…. Hmmph.
“John, I am thoroughly familiar with all Germanic languages, as you should know. Romance languages, however, hold no interest for me.”
"It was years ago,“ he commenced. “In Greece. I was wandering through a public marketplace ...and I was set upon and attacked."
“Sherlock, you are the most insufferable, supercilious, intransigent human ever born. You are an intellectual snob. You are complete bollocks when it comes to emotions, and your capacity for incivility is unsurpassed. You are a knob, a bell-end and a wanker supreme. Not to mention, you are the most stubborn fucking git on seven continents.
For the first 5 seconds nothing happened. Precisely nothing. Sherlock applied his lips to John's and pressed gently. It was like kissing Stonehenge.
After a cuppa and a half-slice of toast (which he simply played with until he reduced it to crumbs), Sherlock was somewhat quieter but still sullen.
With that, the three of them moved apart, Lestrade stepping lively in the lead as a gust of chill wind finally made him shiver. Anna started to follow him at a more reserved pace, shaking her head in amusement.
She stepped closer to peer past him. "Okay—watch for a blue hard-sided one with red tags, and the last one is all black, but I put a gold tie on the handles—there, see it coming around the side?"
Occasionally their weekly video calls weren't entirely satisfying—one or the other of them would be tired, or distracted, and the conversation would limp along unnaturally until they chuckled together and agreed to sign off. In the early days of their long-distance relationship, these instances had caused a bit of needless worry, for both of them; now, Anna took it in stride.
"Shut it, you," a rough voice spoke from somewhere above him—and then he was stepped on, the bad shoulder grinding down into the vehicle's floor under a heavy boot until stars exploded behind his eyes and he was out again.
Sherlock stared down at her fingers, at the paired stones of her engagement ring shining dully in the shadows of the quiet cab interior. The problem
"John. Just leave it." Greg hadn't meant to sound so gruff; he swallowed and tried again, more gently. "What's done is done."
name out of it, once he figures out what you're up to! Anyway, the pen-pals he's had lately have been more harmless crazies than lovelorn pensioners."
They appeared to be in a small storage cellar, or perhaps a large janitor's closet. Water pipes ran in brackets high along one of the rough stone walls, and a round drain grate was set into the floor, its small island of poured concrete surrounded by uneven flagstone; there were, unfortunately, no easy weapons to hand. A careful search of the metal shelving unit bolted to the rear wall turned up only cardboard boxes filled with paper leaflets. They also found a lightweight plastic bucket, which Greg joked halfheartedly about needing to use later.
"Then I suppose I can make your excuses to Greg," he conceded, smiling thinly, and drew him down for a kiss.
Sherlock couldn't pinpoint any particular factor that had motivated him to dredge up the Runnell case again now. If anything, the troubling fact that he had wilfully ignored an unsolved double murder for so long might have made him reluctant to revisit it. But whatever the reason, he'd awoken yesterday with a sudden determination to get to the bottom of it, once and for all.
"Yeah. Well." The DI had the good grace to look chastened for a second or two, but he couldn't hold back his smile for long.
"I know." They gazed off into the kitchen and drank together, letting those words sink in; then Sherlock murmured, "I sometimes suspect he's jealous of you for having known me longer."
John vehemently disliked shopping for himself—his well-worn and utilitarian wardrobe stood testament to that—but his mother had always placed great importance on the giving of gifts. Whatever else she'd passed on to him, that much had stuck. Unfortunately, neither his trained idealism nor the frequent guilt it engendered had made meaningful impact on his purchasing skills over the years.
John snapped his gaze back into focus at the contact, and he looked down as if realising all over again that he stood on a glass floor, one hundred and three stories up. Sherlock meant to speak at once, but he was still watching that amazing, intriguing face—and it was shifting more clearly now as John registered his presence, changing magnificently and
It wasn't Sherlock; or, if it was, he'd made some new friends. Big ones, judging by the size of the shadows they could see moving on the ground. The figures themselves were blocked, for the moment, by the bulk of the skip.
John had so far treated this sensation like a shadow at the corner of his eye, resolutely ignoring it, but now...he was starting to realise where his aimless anger was originating.
A more impulsive man might have been driven to retire for the evening, to take the situation in hand. It was tempting...but it was also barely past nine, and he knew he still carried too much restless energy from his day to be truly satisfied with what he could do on his own. Expelling a long, loud breath, Greg dragged fingers through his hair and willed himself to calm.
Instead, she slipped into his office and closed the door behind herself. "Ronny and I think you're working too hard," she asserted, lifting her chin.
"Oh yeah, I remember. Well, he was tough—seemed like there was nothing too gruesome, nothing too heartbreaking for Jim. He could handle scenes that had the forensic techs heaving. But Justine and Eliza...
"Well, aside from Ms Lipton making a nuisance of herself, how's your day been?" asked John, leaning back in his chair contentedly.
A quiet warning klaxon sounded in Sherlock's mind as he finished his sentence. He saw the downwards twitch of the brow, and the clenching jaw; his own snapped closed. Had he let his irritation slip out too obviously?
"Not quite yet, I'm afraid," John's voice crackled and popped on the other end of the line. "Sherlock's still—"
She threw a friendly glance to Sherlock as she passed him, but made no further comment until she had made a quick substitution of the discs in her CD changer, setting the new selections to shuffle. "Dinner should be ready in just a few minutes," she announced, then left the room once more.
Anna's eyes followed a silhouette as it crossed back and forth behind light-coloured curtains. "I live here, now," she answered, wonderingly. "We're getting married."
"Yes, that will do nicely, Mr Brewster. I'm very grateful. Here, I'll make that list for you." He slipped a pen and a small pad from his breast pocket, flipping the cover open briskly and jotting down a listing of the construction projects for which he would require plans.
After another minute, he reported, "He's sending Blondy and the skinny guy out. Now he's making a phone call..."
Tonight, however, the entire evening routine went quite a bit differently. As the credits rolled on John's favourite Bond film he aimed the remote control to stop the DVD, looking up to find his partner already standing by to assist.
Greg's eyes felt just a bit glassy as he suddenly began to grasp the towering mass of decisions and responsibilities ahead of him...but the smile he wore didn't falter; if anything, it became more genuine. Anna's pragmatic attention to detail would surely make up for any lack on his end of the planning equation. All he had to do was keep his head in the game, follow her lead and help her with the local logistics.
"Getting serious, huh?" Anna asked; she exchanged a twinkling glance with Molly as she provided her with a refill.
While Sherlock ate, he explained the ins and outs of the Runnell girls' case, and how he'd gone about proving their murderer's identity. He didn't get into the details of what had delayed that solution for so long, but John didn't seem overly curious about how it had come to be stored beneath the bed.
The box he grabbed was far smaller than all the others Anna had sent him, and when he brought it out into the light he saw that it lacked the international labelling to which he'd become accustomed. Its return address had been water-damaged beyond legibility; only a piece of packing tape had protected his own name and address from a similar fate.
For a minute or two, Greg couldn't have fit a word in edgewise if he'd tried, but he was quite happy to listen to the energetic nine-year-old chatter on. She thanked him for his continued monthly postcards, then told him about her grandmother's dinner menu, and the Disney movie she'd been watching with Kyle, and how good the smells were in the kitchen...
"Well, it can happen anytime you like, far as I'm concerned," he told her, his voice thickly muffled as he shifted his ministrations over her collarbone and moved his free hand along her side.
"Protocol does seem to be your strength, more than his," he agreed. He kicked his feet up onto Lestrade's desk, ankles crossed, and leaned back indulgently. It really was quite a comfortable seat; he could see why Lestrade enjoyed his rare opportunities to relax in it.
"Yes, well, it's on my short list. Of course, a shade like that is tougher to match, so I'm not sure—I mean, I'd hate to pick something out for you ladies and then find out it's impossible to get stuff like coordinating shoes, you know?"
"I didn't think to ask," he said, not looking up from the action of his whisk. "French toast is okay, yes?"
Breathing shallowly, I lock my bedroom door. The shape of that scar—seared into my eyelids, prickling—I bite my lip, squeeze back tears.
"Yes, Anna showed me some of the photos you sent her when you were moving in. It looks nice and spacious."
Between this building and the next behind it, there was even less light; only two wall fixtures were in working order along the entire alleyway. A tall pile of discarded shipping pallets hulked threateningly at one wall, and a little further down a large and battered-looking skip blocked the sight line to one of the closed shops' rear doors.
she could easily have fired him after their breakup, and would've been well within her rights to do so. (That bloody New Zealand holiday had been an utter cock-up, after all. Really, John remained amazed that he'd even rated polite
He laughed in relief, just as he heard a voice in the background, intruding on the girl's sanctuary.
Sherlock offered no immediate comment. As they sat together in quiet, listening to the others working in the kitchen, he dove once more into the maze of his thoughts. The odd reactions Anna provoked from him were a puzzle, and what was the
Words propelled themselves from his lips before he could even consider them. "No, nothing exciting to report. Been a slow week out here, really."
"John, are you still there? Hello? God." Greg made it most of the way back to his office before the phone rang a third time, and when it connected he spoke quickly. "Look, how about I just meet you at the lab?"
felt guilty, though he'd stopped bringing it up in conversation, because it never failed to upset Sherlock whenever he did. And because he knew the sting of his own shame—the weight of it, sitting like a blurry shadow beneath his thoughts—he recognised the unspoken ache that tinted the silences between Greg's words when they talked.
Another flash of feeling crossed his partner's features, swinging once more towards fond affection, and Sherlock experienced a momentary flush of relief. For a man so complex and difficult to understand, John really had an incredibly expressive face, continually alive with clues and warnings; it was a boon for which Sherlock was thankful every day. It had so far allowed him to navigate the murky, hazard-filled waters of their relationship with at least partial success.
"Nah, most of that gets culled down in the post room. This is weirdo mail, stuff that comes in addressed to DI Lestrade specifically. Or to Ronny or me—not as often, though. One time I had some bloke get obsessed with me after I handled him in an interview. He sent me letters for a year and a half, pretending I was his wife and he was travelling abroad while I waited for him." She gave an exaggerated shudder to illustrate her opinion of the memory.
When Greg's phone began to ring, it was a relief. He stood, replacing the useless file with its brethren on the table, and escaped to the hallway before answering.
"It's annoying, but I definitely don't have it so bad as you. I'm only wearing the sling about half the time—just keeping myself from overusing the muscle while the contusion heals. And I don't need to sleep with it on, either."
In the days since the incident, Greg's been trying hard to regain his equilibrium, at work and at home. Unfortunately, that's not as easy a task as he'd expected it might be.
"Sorry! Had to get away," Sarah replied, a little breathlessly. "Jenny won't give me a moment's peace; all she wants to do is natter on about how I should consider hiring her brother's new business for our cleaning contract. It's driving me
He laughed softly, shaking his head; clearly, there was no way Sherlock would fail to see his brother's hand in the choice of this present.
"It's not as if this is taxidermy for entertainment's sake," Sherlock protested. "It's a tangible, physical record of species as history. Just look; how else might one study the wing extension and specific musculature of the Eurasian Eagle Owl up close, frozen in time? Or, over here: the various breeds of domestic dog common in the twenties and thirties—a fascinating visual example of artificial selection in breeding. See how remarkably
"Nah, I got mine back in one piece," Greg replied, shutting the door behind himself. "The arsehole who nicked it on the Tube—I think Sally and Sherlock put the fear of God into him, frankly."
"I can't even see you from here. Where are you?" The string of words was enough to set off another painful cough. Everything from his ribs to his hips was an indistinct mass of hurt.
"We've been over this, I don't even know how many times. It's like he has the impulse control of a three-year-old," John groused as he pulled out cash for the fare.
Sherlock took a deliberate pace backwards and did his best to regain his customary detached expression. It felt slippery and unstable on his face, his lips too firm and his eyes too wide, but he held it in place by main force as he scrabbled internally for an answer to the question.
! I forgot, duh," she giggled, but then got serious. "At Thanksgiving I usually stay in Seattle with Mommy and Aunt Monica. But
. God, baby, you keep that up and you're not even going to have the opportunity to cook it, French or not."
Straightening in the seat, he tilted his head to study his handiwork. "Did you say something?" he asked at last.
Sprawling and formal as it was, John thought the country home itself rather charming, if a bit more ornate than he preferred. Its shabby rooms were moderately crowded, filled with a buzz of quiet conversation as collectors and bargain hunters meandered through and clustered in small groups with their heads together.
This brought a deep, amused chuckle from Brian. "Still jealous, after all these years? Don't let Pietro hear you."
John's voice was thick and congested. "Had better days. Had worse, too." There was a strange, soft utterance that Greg interpreted as a rueful chuckle.
Liz goes off to the restroom, but Anna doesn't follow. She's nursing her margarita and a case of jetlag.
Four men—no, five. Two of them were big, meaty fighters, two of them quick and vicious, and the last one wielded a pipe or something that he swung in the half-dark. They came on fast, with wordless yells; they wasted no time on taunts or questions, but simply attacked the violators of their territory.
Honestly? I'm looking forward to tonight. No delegation: I've decided to watch for the signal myself.
Within Sally's prolonged silence, he could see a whole series of arguments being thought up and discarded; he leaned gingerly back in his chair, careful of the sling he wore, and met her eyes calmly while he waited.
A balding man wearing a dark suit and a chunky signet ring came by their table before long. Brian stood and gave him a combination handshake and rowdy clap on the shoulder—clearly, this friend went way back.
Sitting here, only a few paces away while Sherlock selected memories from the past weeks to rub out of existence...while he deliberately erased people he'd seen, conversations he'd had, and presumably anything else he didn't deem vital to his work...it felt like standing by as witness to an invisible destruction: strange, and disquieting, and somehow eerily beautiful.
"I guess that's where I can thank the soporific properties of the meds they gave me. How is it I can take a whole day off, doing nothing of any use at all, and still be this clapped out at the end of it?"
The second time Greg dragged himself back to consciousness, there was no movement, and no sound. Eyes closed, he took tentative stock of his situation:
It was the second time Lestrade had used that word, a glaring sign of his sentimental nostalgia. It should have been
"I'm going back to the Yard again, tomorrow," he said. "Sally has promised me full access to the thugs' interrogation footage, as well as a sample of the rope from the church basement. Do you think you might feel up to coming along?"
There was no answer—the room was empty, and the jumbled items on the table didn't seem much different than they'd been that afternoon. No experiment, then.
!" The exclamation rang harshly between them. Greg took a breath and barreled on, surprised at his own agitation. "Can we stop talking about that case, now? God, John, I can't—I just wanna spend
With a small, satisfied nod, Sherlock turned north and strode purposefully ahead. He had a route in mind that would take them directly past a number of locations where a similar treatment would be beneficial. The most sharp-edged memories of the time he'd spent tracking Verrone's activities could be filed down, today, reduced to smooth washes of colour tinted by John's smile.
"In the area. Really? Sherlock, you haven't pounded on my door in daylight hours in—I don't even know how long."
Nodding, Sherlock turned away to gaze out the window behind Greg's desk. "Some time ago. I took the liberty of asking Sally to retrieve the case file for you, she'll bring it by shortly."
He quickly called up a series of mental images and compared them to what he saw before him, like flashcards in a matching game, and confirmed the observation.
controlling, you know you can always just smack me. But hear me out. You feel connected to Andy here, don't you?"
John's face cycled through five distinct permutations of emotion before settling on something straddling tenderness and sympathy. "Oh, Sherlock," he said softly, "you don't need to leave yourself out. I know I make a point of meeting up with Greg on my own regularly, but I don't make you stay home so that I can have a good time
Before he could catch his breath and straighten, the leader had begun to speak, a harsh stream of rapid-fire interrogatory French that John found completely unintelligible. The emotional gist of the angry accusation was clear, but the specific meaning was beyond him; it seemed to John that most of the focus had been on his friend so far, and it wasn't until he noticed the tall man flipping through their confiscated wallets at the back of the room that he understood.
"So sorry, Mr Bond, but I'll never tell you my master plan," she said in a comically villainous accent, as she brought the phone to her ear.
gained a certain position of importance, that was true. Sherlock felt sure, however, that she viewed their mutual accord with a clear regard similar to his.
his friend speak of childhood holidays in France. On at least two occasions, Greg's fourth or fifth shot of scotch had gone down following fluently spoken toasts. John had no problem believing that following the fast words of these men was a tall order—repeating phrases learnt from family was one thing, full fluency quite another, and Greg had already confessed to difficulty besides—but he
He nodded his thanks. "I certainly do hope Sherlock is right about it being an easy collar. I wouldn't want to have to cancel plans; we're supposed to be in Cambridge on Friday."
Anna dropped her hand—she'd apparently been plucking nervously at her collar without noticing. "You're getting a cheeseburger? Here?"
Meanwhile, Greg had remained on grudging desk duty while his dislocation healed, handling a series of routine investigations during which his team had run all of the legwork for him. He'd complained to John of boredom, of course, but the protests had seemed half-hearted. John thought he might understand that, actually. The bland normalcy of his own part-time work at the surgery, once he'd returned to it, had seemed oddly reassuring and safe, where once upon a time he'd spent many of those hours desperate to get away. He knew it would balance out, eventually—that his irrepressible desire to "see the battlefield", as Mycroft had so delicately phrased it, wouldn't stay away for long. Likewise, Greg's inquisitive, purposeful nature was gradually returning to the fore, and once he'd received clearance to stop wearing the shoulder sling he would be ready to take on his usual sorts of cases once more.
He repeated the words silently, feeling the weight of the concept slide down into his gut. His only experience in that arena, thus far, had been Priscilla Kandless: snobbish, controlling and possessed of an incredible capacity for disapproval. Directly or indirectly, the pressures and expectations she'd placed on her daughter—and later, her unwanted son-in-law—had surely lain behind both the genesis and destruction of Greg's relationship with Tracy.
"I really, really don't," Sherlock told her, returning his empty cup to its saucer. "My opinion on the matter should have no bearing whatsoever on your compatibility with Lestrade."
Still, hearing Sally's obvious implication made Anna a little more confident she'd made the right choice.
By the time they'd finally called it a night, everyone had imbibed more than their fair share. It was about eleven thirty when John paid his cab fare and turned to sway across the pavement to his doorstep, patting his coat pockets to check for his belongings.
"Thought not," John smiled, opening the bag and setting its fragrant contents out on the coffee table. "Here, I brought you a chicken tikka from Raj of India. Go on, it's still warm, I ordered it with our dessert."
"Oh, no. Pop never does Christmas; he's holed up alone for it every year since Mum passed. But we'll see him soon enough; I'll tell him you said hello."
"Think nothing of it; it's been surprisingly pleasant to have the company." Mycroft glanced down at the book he held, his hand still splayed across its cover; he passed it across to John as if coming to an abrupt decision. "I'm certain you've already chosen something personal for him; still, this would go over far better with my brother if it comes from you."
"Ah, not completely. I'm good at judging context, though; I get by. And I've always had a knack for the intonation, I suppose. Mum used to tell me I sounded just like Pépère Michel when I got going. Put it this way: I can probably take you to Paris for a weekend and
"What brought this on? You usually sleep in." He teased her earlobe with gentle teeth as he said it.
The stereo system newly added to the dining room was playing something atrocious and dated. As Sherlock entered the room, he could feel the cheerful pop music taking up residence in his molars.
"Most Americans haven't had a famous and supposedly dead detective use their apartment as a base of operations for a whole week, either. 'Course I look you up, every now and then."
"Yeah, none of 'em make any sense. Like...here, this one, from two days ago." She picked a sheet of plain stationery out of the pages she sorted through, and handed it up to him. "Couple like that, the last few weeks."
of unwanted emotion had begun within him that was anathema to the accomplishment of his goals. And then, when things had begun to go wrong—as they so often had, in so many cities—it had been
he thought, turning his steps towards the quiet subdivision that lay east of the main road. He could sulk on Lestrade's sofa, and amuse himself snooping through his things, and likely cause quite a diverting reaction when the man returned home from work.
"God, Sherlock," whispered John, failing to suppress a tiny shudder at feeling the rush of breath behind his ear. "You don't really mean that?"
Greg accepted the slip of paper being brandished before his face. "Okay, calm down. It's no problem. We know where he's gone; he can't have left all that long ago..."
"John's had trouble sleeping. It's improved over the last fortnight, but that's only served to draw my attention to the fact that...I'm experiencing...similar issues."
"I have no opinion on the matter," Sherlock huffed into his tea, "but it shouldn't take very long for you to determine whether there's anything there worth purchase."
Usually he would make himself scarce, while Sherlock did this. It was his partner's private business, after all, this ritual he carried out within the workings of his incredible intellect...but John was buzzing, tingling. He couldn't resist staring.
"It's okay. I know it's important to your family, spending this time with you. Don't worry about me, love; you and I, we'll have all the time in the world, soon enough." He made a little face around a swig of his beer—he hadn't intended such a sappy, cliché line—but she didn't make a joke of it.
John caught up with him, then; Sherlock saw the fair hair in his peripheral vision as his friend moved to stand quietly beside him. Blinking sightlessly at the sparks of sun on the water, he murmured the only explanation he could manage. "I was someone else, when I was here."
Greg had been cleared to remove his shoulder sling on Sunday afternoon; after work on Monday, he'd celebrated his return to full duty by inviting his team out for drinks. John had gone along, gamely accepting the increasingly drunken toasts offered up to his brawling skills and knot-picking dexterity. He'd raised his own glass in turn, praising Greg's clear-headedness and calm under pressure; Ronny had called a toast to Sally's leadership throughout the ordeal, and they'd drunk at Sally's request to Ronny's quick work on sorting through footage from hundreds of traffic cameras. Not to be left out, Phil had recounted Sherlock's extraordinary feats of deduction with something akin to awe in his watery blue eyes. (John had blinked, hard, and drained his drink in one go to stop himself from snorting aloud. The gangly forensic tech had begun to show alarming signs of admiration, especially since Sherlock had returned from the dead; it was probably a good thing that Sherlock had shunned the gathering.)
"Honey, I'm home," Greg called out softly to nobody, as he opened the door to his flat. For just a moment, he could imagine a response echoing down the stairs, or perhaps from the back room.
"Ah, love, he knows who's on my list. The ones who got away," Hugh sighed theatrically, with a hand splayed over his heart and a playful wink towards Anna. "I keep telling you, if your dear, sweet Frances ever decides to cut you loose, you come call on me! Now, Brian, down to the
John moved forward into the house without hesitation, leaving Sherlock to wonder whether the warmth of the proximity had been as noticeable and distracting to the doctor as it was to him. He shook the thought forcefully from his head as he entered, hanging his coat with a mild reproof for their friend. "Save the prevarication, Lestrade, it's obvious you did hear."
The matching up of names and descriptions to the subtle tells John exhibited was nothing too difficult, not after having spent so long in continual study. But, although Sherlock had, as always, succeeded in distinguishing and defining John's emotions, true understanding remained frustratingly out of reach.
Sherlock recognised the first recording within four bars: a Vivaldi recorder concerto, performed beautifully by Michaela Petri. His teeth immediately ceased grinding together; he stood at the far wall of the room, focused idly on a framed photograph of Anna with what were presumably her late husband and her middle sibling, as the gentle ebb and flow of the music soothed his nerves. For he
There was another brief silence as John considered this statement. Mycroft replaced the Keats, and strolled around to the opposite side of the long bin; John watched him warily.
It's been a busy year, for me. Staying occupied in my dotage, I tell myself: my social calendar is demanding.
Fifteen minutes later, they were on the Tube. They sat with heads tilted close together, happily holding hands, all but oblivious to the other passengers while Anna flipped through potential sofa photos on her phone and Greg quietly offered fond critique.
"I've never really understood the lure of taxidermy, myself," she murmured, gazing across the long, arched gallery with wide eyes. "I always thought the idea of stuffing and mounting dead animals was pretty creepy."
But now, the hypothesis of his reluctant sentiment had become sudden reality, and with it came an influx of sensation and emotion that was nearly overwhelming.
At the touch of John's hand on his shoulder, he allowed himself to be drawn sideways into a gentle embrace, his cheek pressed into John's chest, eyes closed as he inhaled: crisp cologne, mingled with notes of spicy dal and candied fennel seeds from dinner.
Sally cleared her throat pointedly, and he brought his eyes into focus with a twitch. She stood in the doorway, with a fat brown case file among the papers tucked beneath her arm; once she was certain Greg's wandering attention had returned, she took a step in and shut out the murmur of the bullpen outside. "So Holmes is gone, already? Not like him at all, to solve a cold case for you without sticking around to gloat after."
It was over in a split-second; a tiny, chaste kiss pecked into the corner of Sherlock's mouth, and then John let go and pulled back to resume eye contact. He dropped his hand to rest flat on Sherlock's lapel for a few seconds more.
Determined John, caring, competent, his eyes fierce. Sherlock: every emotion walled tight, but looking somehow vulnerable nonetheless.
up there too and I nearly got swept away. It doesn't even sound that awful, I guess, telling you about it, but it really shook me up..."
The quicksilver flashes of potentiality narrowed inwards as Sherlock twisted his glass from side to side.
It had been barely two weeks since he'd relocated here, to the two storey terraced house that Sherlock had scouted out unbidden. The move had been meant to occur at the first of the month, but a tough murder had come up to throw a wrench in the works—hardly a surprise, really. Greg considered himself lucky that both his previous landlord and his new one had proven flexible in regards to key turnovers. Now, of course, he could consider himself lucky in a few other ways—not least of which being that he'd gotten all of his furniture roughly in place before effectively losing the use of one arm for three weeks.
John had anticipated his temper, however, and had held the device securely out of reach as he'd sent an affirmative reply. "Sorry, Sherlock," he'd said, smiling fondly across the booth, "it can't be helped. Sarah gives me leeway every single time we have a case, and in return I take my lumps. At least I got to finish eating this time."
can understand the raw data, of course, but I've summed it up simply enough on that first page that the most moronic barrister should be able to produce a conviction from it." Sherlock swept away from the window and headed out, saying, "I'll leave this in your hands now, Lestrade, and trust you not to make a muck of it from here. I've got to be off; Anna and I have plans..."
on Thursdays. (by the way - check it out! It's my new baby!) I'll restart my regular schedule as soon as I can.
"Thanks. And I'll hold you to that, too...but don't worry. I know how busy you get with work; I won't expect you to be involved with
Liz answered without looking up, pointedly flipping a page in her magazine. "You're staring off into space, petting a wall."
Anna looked back and forth between them, wondering what she was missing. Something wasn't making sense.
Because of all this, John was never too thrilled about the lead-up to the holiday season...but he was even more nervous than usual, this Christmas. He had
thinking about all of that. I mean, you could have just as easily decided to take me out somewhere so I could help you choose a gift for John or Greg!"
If that was the case, it was an amusingly inappropriate choice of gift. Anyone who knew Anna well would surely not expect her to plan a church wedding; her first had taken place in a sunny reception hall with a panoramic view overlooking a scenic state park. And as for Greg himself—well, he still tended towards blasphemy in his cursing like many a copper, but he hadn't truly
"Oh, no, I've heard worse," he assured her, turning to slide two freshly finished slices onto her waiting plate, and then his expression turned devilish. "At least
Aside from the sun damage, the mats had been kept in immaculate condition, except that the one before him had been stained by a scribble of marker pen, and there had been only a perfunctory effort made to wash it out. Staring down at the childish mark and thinking back to the information he'd gleaned from the Skype recording, Sherlock suddenly caught a flash of insight that went beyond the dry details.
Anna shook her head fondly and watched him in smiling silence for another minute. Then she spoke up again. "Can I ask you something?"
While he waited, amused, Greg returned his attention to the album in his lap, lingering on a picture that showed the whole family. In this shot, Ryan seemed about the age that his son was now, which meant Anna, the eldest, was roughly twelve; Greg studied the smiling faces of their parents behind them, realising that they'd posed for this shot less than a year before Peter's fatal car accident.
"All right." Nodding, John gamely accepted the book. He tucked it under his arm to extend his hand. "Good, uh, good seeing you, Mycroft."
Her lips tingled with it, afterwards, and her moving feet seemed to barely graze the floor. Dazed, she looked up into a mirror and met the knowing eyes of a younger woman who'd entered just behind her.
Neither of those acclimation periods had held quite the excitement and charm of this time, though. And she supposed that was fitting, after all...it would most likely be her last.
Honestly, with all of the other preparations looming ahead, Anna had expected furnishing the flat to be one more stressful chore to bear. But as she itemised her various ideas for the rooms to her new friends, she was surprised at the giddy excitement she was feeling.
If, sometimes, John felt grateful to be on his way off to an extra shift at work, without having to remind himself of the reasons why...well, that couldn't
From there, the evening's conversation continued to progress in a fairly haphazard way, which wasn't too surprising. Two out of the three of them were busy professionals, with demanding jobs. Opportunities to socialise outside their respective circles of coworkers were sometimes hard to come by, and the freedom to gossip unchecked brought with it a sort of manic, girlish energy, a friendly euphoria only heightened by the alcohol. They hopped from topic to topic with minimal segue as thoughts occurred: from the television programmes Anna had begun to enjoy, they leapt to the recent amusing antics of Molly's cat. Somehow, that led to a sudden suggestion from Sally that they meet at a karaoke bar for their next ladies' get-together—an idea that shortly sent them all into raucous laughter; the consensus was to put the option on the back burner, at least for the time being.
that he didn't reciprocate. It wasn't even that her declarations in regards to their friendship had caused him discomfort—though they certainly had, on some level.
"Not often. If there's something he needs watched, where just one or two helpers won't do...or, if he needs to gather word of mouth from all over the city, fast..."
As John stood frozen by the revelation, Mycroft's eyes shuttered over, and his posture changed; by the time he drew a long inhale through his nose and pivoted smoothly to face John, he'd regained a measure of his usual detached humour.
A tiny voice in the back of his head counted backwards on the calendar from nine, but he ignored it as he took Sherlock's hand.
All it had taken was one external voice to bring his thoughts of John to the surface, and a whirlwind, a
Greg is counting down the days until he's reunited with his love; in the meantime, he's got to solidify his ties to the family she's leaving behind.
They groaned together over the photographic evidence of Gina's poor choice, and then Sally began to relate a horror story from one of her own experiences as a bridal attendant. Even though Anna was busily filing things away in the back of her mind, noting her new friends' preferences and what they were comfortable with, she wasn't too preoccupied to notice that she was enjoying herself immensely.
"They are, at that," Sally agreed, with a smile. "You'll have to make sure you give your Dad my best wishes."
Sherlock's coat was beaded with cold moisture; John clutched at the back of it for balance. "I—I'm sorry. I'm so
Again, the younger man found himself speechless; he narrowed his eyes at Brewster, but was unable to deduce any motive beyond straightforward empathy. He racked his brain for some suitable response that wouldn't tread too heavily on messy sentiment; eventually he simply managed, "...Yes."
John gently put his hands in place and waited for Greg to settle himself; the little he could see of the older man's profile turned toward the still-silent door to the next room, assessing. After a moment Greg faced forward once more, deliberately raising his right forearm to his mouth, and then nodded his readiness.
Sherlock felt the corners of his own lips turn upwards as his glass rang a sweet, clear tone against hers.
A little over an an hour later, Greg left for work, reluctant but grinning from ear to ear. Anna watched him through the small bay window, striding off towards Goldhawk Road with a spring in his step. She smiled, sipping her coffee thoughtfully, and twitched the sheer curtain back into place as he moved on out of sight.
"Ah, the usual. Stress and bother. I've been trying to get those damned compliance reports together, today, but now...I'm considering taking the rest of your appointments myself, just to stay out of the line of sight of the reception desk."
Squinting uncharitably at his new surroundings, Sherlock found himself on Goldhawk in Shepherd's Bush.
"Well, that's that for another couple months. Nice to have a quiet day to get it done," sighed Sally behind him as he composed a quick reply.
Horrified, John watched the blade pause and begin to press gently inward near the centre of his friend's belly; he steeled himself for a last-ditch struggle, to try and lunge forward and stop the man—and just then a riot of noise erupted in the outer hall. He was pulled roughly around with a cry, as everyone in the room reacted with confusion. The door burst inwards; black-vested policemen pushed through with weapons drawn. From the corner of his eye, John saw the quiet one rushing forward with something—
he told himself; he rose from the sofa and slipped Anna's photo album onto a shelf on his way to the kitchen.
"It was a great day, really!" Mindful of the busy atmosphere on the other end of the line, he summarised the case and its satisfying conclusion as he flipped through the pages of old photographs. The album was one he'd sat and perused with Anna's narration, during his Chicago visit, and he imagined her curled on the seat beside him to listen.
Their discussion moved on aimlessly through a number of topics, including the newly hatched plans to save the Chicago house from being sold. Although Greg reacted positively to the news, Anna could tell his attention wasn't really focused.
Usually this notation meant that some time after dinner, when the hour began to grow late, John would kiss his partner goodnight, turn out the lights, and take himself off to the bedroom alone. Sherlock would spend an hour or two motionless on the sofa, immersed in the strange landscape of his thoughts. Then he would slip into bed at last, murmuring a few words of apology for disturbing John's sleep.
"Oh-ho! Well, don't let us keep you, then. I'll just email you the juicy details later tonight, and keep you updated as we go tomorrow. And we'll see you and John on Thursday, yeh?"
Sherlock dragged his eyes away from the man with some effort, closing them as he brought the steaming coffee mug to his lips.
"Big enough that she and Hannah should really have had help getting it inside." She held a soapy glass up to the light, twirling it between her fingers and squinting to check that she'd gotten the last of the dried wine. "They nearly broke one of the carvings, doing it by themselves. I told her she should have at least called
Now, however, Sherlock found himself examining the kind, weathered features of his partner with trepidation.
Most of the people here were idiots, of course, but they were nevertheless a force of good in the city Sherlock loved.
Sherlock hasn't got the time for a silly welcome outing, this evening. The cold case he's finally ready to revisit is tied deeply into the history of his own heart.
A flush of unexpected bitterness warmed Sherlock's neck. "Why should it have done?" He stepped around the bed and pushed past the other man, shoving Anna's skirt at him—but he found his way blocked by a sturdy arm.
John glared at his damaged device. "Bloody junk. First thing tomorrow, I swear, I'm getting it replaced."
John crossed his legs and continued, "Pity that Antoine was one of the ones killed, really. Sally probably would've got more useful stuff from
"That's amazing," said John instead, exclaiming intermittently from the opposite end of the sofa as he scrolled through the typed notes. "I can't even imagine how you thought of testing
John hopped out promptly, but Greg leaned in and put his hand on Anna's knee when she moved to open the door on her side. "Love, how about you just wait here? Won't be a moment, we'll pop your bags inside and then we can get straight to dinner with no delay."
"It's contagious, I think," Sally mused in response, nodding approvingly to her own glass as Anna moved to pour for her. "All you lot, all paired up—I'm running
The older man's eyes lit up with pleasure, and he immediately launched into a torrent of information that interested Sherlock not in the least. He smiled, and nodded at appropriate moments, but his mind wandered to the events that had brought him to take the decided risk of trust in Graham Brewster.
"Hello, love. Not a bad time, I hope?" he asked, remembering the friendly chaos that had reigned in the Faber family home the previous Christmas.
"We have plenty of room, don't you worry. I think you'll like the flat, love. Tell you what: I'll put away whatever I can as we go, and then you can tell me where things
"Well, get me untied and I can help you out," John replied, leaning forward to allow his friend easier access to the tied hands at his back.
“Oh yeah that, i’m fine.” His words sounded confused and he couldn't look at John straight in his eyes. Pupils were dilated and it was not because Sherlock was staring at John.
“The silence John. The peace. Isn't it hateful?”. Sherlock always wanted the thrill of adventure, sitting in a flat with nothing to do while his flatmate read about how the queen of England got a new dress wasn't really his ideal way of spending time.
“Molly? Is something wrong?” John knows that Molly never comes to 221b unless it was something urgent.
“You already have her contact on your phone…. But what if it is not her only contact that she has, so she got a new phone?”
“Her- her number?, but you already have her number don’t you? I’ve seen you call her numerous times.
“No, really. I am the last person you would want for financial aid. You could've asked Mycroft for money”
“What do you mean?”. John’s heart started racing, he started feeling light headed but managed to get a drink of his water and focus on Sherlock’s lips.
“Ooh whoo” came in Mrs. Hudson while knocking on the door. It was only this one time where John really wished she hadn't interrupted them. “There’s someone here for you Sherlock. I’ll just let her in”. With a nod of his head Sherlock got up to see who it was, leaving John and their meals alone. John was debating on what to do either to just sit there and wait for Sherlock to come back or to see who came for sherlock. Either way John needed to see him. Everytime Sherlock left the room he felt like part of him went with him so naturally, he followed Sherlock into the sitting room.
“What’s this?”, John asked as he set the small pile of papers on the table next to the bags while taking a peek inside.
“No, yeah, fine” He could no longer look at sherlock so he looked elsewhere. John got up leaving his paper behind and walked toward his desk where Sherlock tends to leave his stuff. Sherlock always threw the pile of mail or semi-important papers onto the table and it is usually John that organizes everything. Not this time. ¨what's this?¨
“Dinner sounds good”, Sherlock said as he walked over to his chair, took out his violin, and began playing The Thieving Magpie knowing it would bring smile to John’s face.
Sherlock, taking a full step forward again, maybe a little too close this time. “I’ve noticed you were a bit tense this morning, and I took the liberty of collecting the groceries today”.
“I mean, why did you agree to be my flatmate?”. The words felt dry against John’s throat. He had been meaning to ask his flatmate but how would he bring it up. How would he ask why someone attractive ever want a flatmate like him?
Have I been zoning out? Dear God what did he say? Something Sherlock related obviously, with this man he could be talking about anything. John did not know whether to agree or disagree, staring at Sherlock for a little to long know he clenched his tiny hands on his side. “Um, yeah. I suppose”
“Wow, uh...okay. Good.”, John said as he leaned in. At first it seemed that he was going for a hug, Sherlock turned to fully face him but John reached passed Sherlock and grabbed the bags. John sensing the tension in the air broke the silence. “Why don’t I make us dinner?”
Sherlocked opened his eyes and sat up criss cross on the sofa and eyed John. “Are you even listening to me?”.
“No, okay, thats it. Listen to me Sherlock. You need to stop this, we barely have enough to get the groceries this week.” There was no response, of course there wouldn't be one, Sherlock was as high as a kite. Setting his morning paper down John looked at the detective that was sitting across from him and put a hand on his lap. The touch of the doctor sent the detective to put his entire focus on him immediately. John was at a loss for words, sherlock’s eyes were the colour of a clear ocean full of life; however that life seemed to be dying. “Sh- sherlock. Look, I know that you may be going through something, and I get that, but you can’t shut me out like this. Tell me. What is going on?”
“Yes, but why did you agree to live with me. Even with your deductions you could tell that im broke”
“And what’s this?” holding up a small piece of paper to sherlock he could feel something building up in his stomach but managed to set that feeling aside.
It has been a week since sherlock and John helped Molly with a case, but since then, sherlock had not been the same. Something had happened during Sherlock  and Molly’s chat while John was fixing up a cup of tea. John so desperately wanted to know what they talked about, but he was not one for seeming interested in sherlock’s conversations with others.
Dinner went painfully slow. Sherlock and John ate their meal trying to avoid eye contact but there were instances where Sherlock looked up and caught John staring right before quickly looking away. “Why do you do that?”, Sherlock asked setting down his fork and sitting up straight.
“Hm?” this time looking from the paper to meet Sherlock's eyes that were now squinting. “I’m sorry, what?”.
John had been walking for hours with copies of his resume in his hand while the other was clenched into a small fist, as always. He arrived to 221B. Surprised, he saw Sherlock standing over the dinner table with bags of groceries on top.
“Okay, all i’m trying to do here is help you. I don’t know why you are using again and i've been trying to be a good friend and figure out why so I can help you but you obviously don't need me. Never have and never will. I understand that now, so why don’t I go to the grocery store and buy us both food so we dont starve because I still care for you even if you don’t care for me. And you don’t have to worry about me bothering you anymore, i’m sure molly is in charge of that now. “
