John didn't put his gun down "How about you stay where you are. " He doesn't do much else. He wanted to assess the situation before he puts an end to this and calls Lestrade. He just let the man speak .
He leaned over and touched Sherlock's knee. “I told you, you didn't do anything. I'd have to show you what I mean.” John said, a funny little smile crossing his lips. He glanced down at Sherlock's lips then licked his own... If Sherlock pushes him away he could blame it on the alcohol.
"Nothing's going to happen Sherlock. I can handle myself. The worse that going to happen is we get roughed up by some demons again or something.  "
The girl started.  " Name's  Elizabeth, just call me Izzy . " She plops down on her bed and  crosses her long ,tan ,smooth legs. " I want to set this straight . Getting the grace will not  be easy. " her Cajon accent vanishes " I don't work for free , you four handsome men are going to have to get the supplies for me . "
The detective shakes his head "It's quite alright " and it was by all means.... He's never felt this way towards anyone- He licked his lips and keep his face set in a board stone indifference giving nothing away.
John was surprised when the man on the ground eyes flicked to  black. Dean was by his side in a flash . The hunter brought a knife down into the attackers chest and pulls it out just as quickly.   The attackers chest briefly glow with orange light, which flickers out as the man screams in agony.  John jumped back away as the man's body slumps to the ground clearly dead.
Lucas just now noticed a short stout  blond man standing at attention near door . When he was addressed he  relaxed and walked the over to them and held out his hand .
Not that his Sherlock didn't laugh genuinely, it was just this Sherlock was so pure and light-hearted. His  smile met and his sparkling kaleidoscope eyes. That fog that seemed to haunt  his Sherlock's eyes no matter what John did to make him laugh was gone...Had he done that by stopping those men?
Surprised Sherlock said, “Me?” he adjusted himself in the chair and leaned towards John. Genuinely concerned.  He knew he annoyed John when he deduced him and others, put eyes in his tea , body parts in the fridge and the occasional bullet through the wall... but John also knew that is just how Sherlock is and he can't turn off his deductions . It was like breathing . He's gotten better....or that's what he thought.
Sherlock felt a blush creep up his neck"No I can get to the loo my self "He grumbled heat rising up to his face.
Just one hit ....no one will know....sample 7% solution. ...that's all....Everyone thinks he's on a case and he got away from Mycroft's cameras hours ago..
"Sherlock I'm going to talk to Sam and Dean, you can unpack if you want. "John looked over at Sherlock . His eyes were closed and his soft curls fell into his face like a dark halo. John knew the young man didn't hear him, he never does  when he's so deep in thought. He smiled to himself brushed a dark curl from the boys forehead " I will be right back..."He said without realizing those where the same words he uttered before he was sent back in time.
Maybe he should make use of his “deleted” picture of John. He unlocked the device  went to the  gallery and opened the picture of John ....
“Lucas calm down - Henry was alright with the man speaking to him alone- so there is not much we can do. “ Jo said coolly, though it was clear she was not happy about being pushed out either .
John sits back in his seat. Why did this not surprise him. He don't think anything can surprise him any more. It makes so much since why Sherlock ranks his cases.  He always wondered why and how he did it. " So six  and higher are demons. Anything below that is  ...normal people right?" John had to ask.
After she swaggered away John and Sherlock's eyes meet and they laughed again. It's been years since a young girl like that hit on him. Sherlock's face made it even better -Sherlock's laugher echoed around him it was such a lovely sound . He wish he could hear it every day...Soon their laughter died off and they sat there grinning at each other. John wanted to reach out and smooth his thumb over Sherlock's laugher redden cheeks.
John got up and answered ,when he open the door his eyebrow raised to his hairline . "Leeanna?” surprise was  obvious in his voice .
It's clear John is attracted to his future self and it seems he's attracted to  himself in his  current state. So it shouldn't be hard to seduce him-
Abe  wrapped his chubby arms around his fathers shoulders. " Pop’s it's all right. I know it's been rough finding out what finally happened to Mom but- at least you know she loved you,  protected you and gave her lif- "
Dean's smile widens to his eyes “ Alright  feel free to stay as long as you like. Common Sammy we should get some sleep to.”
Henry had been just passed the Y incision cracking open the cage finding out that yet another organ has been removed- he was elbow deep in organs when he heard loud voices outside of the examining room.  He heard young Lucas yelling . The kind ,not so little fool never yells.
Dean looked at John.  John shrugged . The men came up to greet them shaking hands and introducing themselves. The brothers where Dale and Randy and the skinny man was George.  He leads them inside the surprisingly nice home . It had soft tan walls that meet an even softer yellow where the den and sunroom all meet.
“  - Dean you need to rest .”Sam murmured. The older Winchester shrugged “ Almost there Sammy don't worry bout me . We can't stop till we get to Morgan City . No telling when Crowley's goons will attack again ."
"No. I am not part of the men of who ever " "John stepped back and put the necklace back in his pocket "Can you help me or not?" He keep his voice even despite the growing- it wasn't fear is was something else... Who the hell asks for a soul ? What the hall was this guy?
Sherlock made a noise in his throat, not denying it. He would honestly love to have all of John's attention. Having him full-time on cases, in the flat on lazy Sunday morning making tea. He would love to have more of him  or keep things as they were . Just having John was enough . But this woman is cheating on the single greatest thing in Sherlock's life. .” I know a strumpet when I see one. And John is just one of a string of lovers you have in your life .”
John's eyes widened and put his hand over the necklace. Like hell he was handing it over to this guy.
Sherlock smiled to himself at John unease and buried his face in the older man's jumper. He could smell the other man. He smelled like  exotic tea, bringing to mind peppercorns , mint , and trade voyages and the mysteries of the west. But beneath that he smelled  like himself pure earthy and natural,  he buried his nose in the crook of John's  neck and inhaled softly, wanting to taste him . Wanting to memorize this indelible marker of who he is. The only person in the world to stay with him, and care for him so dearly. Sherlock didn't want him to leave . He don't want to wait to meet him all over again ...There was no telling how many more years he will have to be alone. How long he will have to endure the normal idiots that plague his life. He don't want to John Watson to leave.
He hasn't seen her in two weeks; he just got back from a case,  took his shower and just settled into bed when he received a text .
That's another thing Sherlock can't wrap his mind around.  That look in John's eye when he's worried . They only met hours ago....yet that soft caring worried look seemed to follow Sherlock since the moment they met.  John was looking at him like he  most important thing in his life and would do anything he could to make sure he was safe.
Sherlock sat there alone....Johns warmth still lingered all around his words where like a cozy blanket in his mind . He had them on repeat over and over he heard John's words....Words he never thought anyone would ever say.... He took a deep breath his mind finely catching up to the current moment. ..he was alone .....the shower was running..
Sherlock hesitated ...was John  about to....It was the only explanation....he was nervous. ..he's never done this....he's only experimented  with his fingers and small toys....John...John was.....not either of those thing ......but he obeyed willingly. After he had steadied himself on his belly, John trailed his slick fingers down Sherlock’s pale skin. Down his spine and back up again grabbing a fist full of his hair and yanked back softy.  He hovered over the taller man's body as he whispered "This is your first time.... Right?  don't lie to me Sherlock I don't want to hurt you. "his voice was soft and genuine.
Sherlock finally looked at him, his normally crystal clear eyes were dark and filled with fear." We don't know what we are getting into - Mycroft don't know much about these things. Only that they are fast and  dangerous . He doesn't want us to seek this thing out . He keeps telling me to find another way . That he's going to come over here if we even try to approach this angel. “ He bites his lip . “ I keep telling him to bugger off." Sherlock  looks down at his phone again frightened eyes dancing over the screen. . “I know Mycroft is a pompous windbag, but - and it pains me to say this , He knows what he's talking about. " Sherlock puts his hand on John's leg and gave his thigh a soft  squeeze. "We don't even know if she can make the grace you need to get home. What if it goes wrong and..." his voice breaks . " -something happens to you."
Mycroft shook his head. "I don't know them personally . I simply know of them and the lives they lead."
He just got the kettle on when he finally gave up pulling his mobile out he looked down at the multiple text saying the same thing.
Lucas tossed his hands up like a child “ I don't care ! First he calls Henry an idiot then he prances around like he owns the place ! Then he
“You are so Bloody Thick!” John said meeting Sherlock's gaze. He was frustrated, angry, and madly in love, with this git.
A pained smile crosses Wilberforce face .It was so bitter sweet and painful to see someone he cares so much for so sick and weak….but still so brilliant . Pitt started to choke making gurgling sounds his throat constricting his airways making breathing a challenge.  He tightened their inclined hands . After the coughing horror subsides he takes a moment to steady his breathing before he speaks again . We agreed on a succession . “
Leaving those full lips wet shiny....inviting. Johns mouth went dry their eyes met and everything seemed to stop. Time, the sound of foot steps down the hall , his heart even his  thoughts. Everything but the feel of Sherlock's weightless warm body on top of his, the cool puff of the younger man's breath that smelled of sweet tea and mint.
~" the sounds he keeps making  are unwelcome but he can't stop them- Everything's on fire building, building intense heat and longing something he can't seem to control. His heart was racing.  His mind slowly filling with white noise from the amount of endorphins filling his head . All the blood in his body was pooling at the base of his belly.  There is no hope for coherent thought. Slowly he made his way down first rubbing each thigh ..up and down just teasing ...Then finally he wrapped his fingers around the base of his cock. The sharp pleasure made him cry out into his pillow.
……......He was going to be stuck here forever. John felt a tear fall down his face .He was never going to see his Sherlock again. What was the detective going to do without John?  He was going to be so worried. Would Mycroft tell him what happened. ?  That John wasn't coming back…What if by some law Mycroft forgot about John and he was stuck here for the rest of his life . In a past  that was not his own. .. A past where his other self would eventually meet this Sherlock and start a life? Would he meet himself ten years down the road  Broken from war? Would he even see himself?  Would his younger self even  meet Sherlock at all?….Sherlock saved his life…. If he never met Sherlock, a bullet would have meet his skull.
He thought swiping through the pictures His and Leenna's names where not even close in the contacts.
Sherlock made a soft noise when John ran his tongue across Sherlock's bottom lip...Slowly the younger man opened his mouth and let John inside . Letting him deepen the kiss .
Sherlock fell to his knees when he tried to take a step. John was next to him his doctor instincts kicking in and fear of what he seen on the video rushed over him.
His looks over his shoulder at the two brothers huddled over a book and John's necklace. Then over to the angel who don't seem to do much other then stand there and stare at the brothers until they ask him a question . John watched them for a moment .
"I understand you are up set.... " he says  carefully repeating himself. " but , as I said before.  We need you to say calm. We will find you a way home but for the  time being stay with my brother .  Since he's the reason you are here in the first place."
"Come on"John said pushing Sherlock's small body off of his. He cleared his throat and cleared it again . " Let's not keep the Americans waiting"
“ Do you two know each other?” an unfamiliar voice broke through Henry's trance . He couldn't find words , he couldn't stop staring . That name tumbled around in his head over and over in Pitts voice .
That's when the door slammed open and a tall dark-haired man stepped through with Lucas on his heels.
Khoung looked over at him as he dug through the ever expanding mess on his desk ." To be honest Doctor Watson this is out of my field of expertise . I don't have the mojo for this kind of magic ..and as of right now , neither does this world's Mycroft. A magic like this is going to need someone stronger..." He handed John an envelope . "I will have  everything you need to make the call delivered to your room. Follow each one of the directions carefully ."He pointed to the odd satanic looking star with strange markings on the top of the envelope "Draw this on the floor just  as it is right here. Do not make a mistake. Understand?" His blue eyes bore into john imploring. John shivers he hates that feeling of familiarity when he looks at them.  John took the envelope and nodded.  He was confused again  "Wait ... so I just draw this and ?" he arched an eyebrow .
Sherlock lifts the tip of the popsicle to his mouth and nibble at it with his lips . The action causes the melting juice to flow messily over his lips . Quickly he licks some of the mess away only to have half of it fall down his chin. He then wiped  the sticky dribble with his finger and pushed his finger into his mouth with a rather filthy sucking noise.
Sam cuts in "Give us a little time to do some research John....alright. " he leans over and clasp the good doctor on the shoulder. " Get some rest I know you must be exhausted. " Sam's hazel eyes sparkled with kindness his handsome brow wrinkled in worry. " We will get you home man. "
After Dean was settled in  Sam dug in his bag and started drawing symbols that are similar to the ones in Mycroft’s secret lair. John watched curiously. Sam looked over and smiled. John had so many questions and Sam seem to read his thoughts and starts explaining. “Warding sigils are a type of spell work used to hide an individual, or protect a location or building from angels or demons.” John nods watching as Sam puts salt on the window and doors, he asks questions and Sam answers every one of them without having to think. It was so intriguing every symbol protected them from something different. Demons ,Angels,  Ghost . Sam seems to  know a way to kill  or at least slow down everything that goes bump in the night . It intrigues John so he listens , learning all he can -
Her face gets red "No John is not gay stupid. He's bi sexual! ? " She gasped. "Ah!! I don't have another man ! John is  the only man in my- "
John followed Sam to the side of a hill where a metal door stood . It hat the same oblong shaped star on it that the post office  back home did.  Inside was what John was expecting . It was the similar, if not the same as Mycroft's Bunker . The room  centers around a table with an illuminated map of the world. There is also a bank of computers and communication devices. There is a large library with shelves of books as far up as the ceiling . A variety of weapons that John was unfamiliar with where proudly a on display. He looked over at Sam.  The tall man nodded and John followed him down the steps of the balcony the metal clanked under the his weight . It was an ominous sound that echoed in the empty halls of the huge building.  "Welcome to our home, we have enough rooms so you and your son can have separate rooms if you like."
John looked back at Sherlock obviously as lost  as he was and gave Sherlock  a look that said it all.  What on earth where they saying?
John smiles, it reminds him of his days in Uni...Man it feels like so long ago.... After the war and living with Sherlock . Even now jumping back in time ,meeting Sherlock all over again-  it was almost like his life before all of that never  happen....John was so lost in his own thoughts he didn't release they came up to Sherlock's building.
John sat up a bit in his seat. The two men were so casual yet something in the way they communicated. It was like the codependency he and Sherlock shared. John wondered if this is how he and Sherlock looked the outside world . Always gravitating toward each other casting worried glances, soft touches, lingering looks - If these two weren't brothers John would think they were shagging. If he and Sherlock gaze at each other anything like the bothers do. He can see why the yard thinks he and Sherlock have been shagging since they met. John sighs softly and looks out the window watching the gray moss covered trees pass by. The two brothers chatted about who needs more rest it always came back to hunters " two hour nap " . Their voices blended in with the sound of the road and the beautiful rumble of the impala. John watches the muggy foreign landscape pass .
"Yes Doctor Watson.  We will return to the place where you first arrived in our time , Khoung will chant the spell and send you home . I wanted to thank you personally for protecting my brother. I worry about him constantly.  "
"Hello?" Came the same rough voice as before.  It sounded slurred with sleep and a night of getting pissed .
"Just because you enjoy the show don't mean the stores management will. " He teased expecting  Sherlock to roll his eyes make a snide comment, or even scoff . He didn't expect however was for the boys pale cheeks to paint red or his blue gray eyes widen, and mouth fall open in surprise.
"John and I will not snog in front of you, nor engage in any other- activities you seem to have conquered up in that head of yours. "
" You become a extremely good man Sherlock Holmes.  " A thought crosses his mind . " You and I have the most meaningful relationship that I ever experienced. We are not sexual simply because  you want to wait until marriage ." He pats Sherlock's curls and smiles to himself.
Sherlock starts laughing again, Dean falling in line . Sam grumbled and pushed himself up . "M'so funny?"
Sherlock licked his lips and sucked the bottom one between his teeth..... In a way he hoped John don't find his way home. At least for a little while....Especially, if he was going to keep this up.
Sherlock felt them it was more than one man. One at his wrist, one at his feet holding him down so he can't fight back. Anther was cutting his trousers as yet another man pushes his shirt up. He ran his cold wet filthy greedy hands over his slender chest down his stomach over his small pectorals. Fingers pinched and prodded at his nipples ...Then he felt a mouth clasp over his  sensitive virgin flesh .."STOP!" Sherlock cried but they didn't stop . He couldn't fight . They were going to take him.Tears filled his eyes.
"And do continue to take care of him. I am so happy he found a partner.  You two are perfect for each other. I always knew he had a thing for army men. "
When they got to the car ten or so demons came out of nowhere and started after them. Sam shot a few of them  with rapid permission . Dean tossed John some sort of long silver blade. He caught it blindly and when two demons attacked he ducked stabbed the first though the bottom of the chin up though his face blood dripped through the small puncture - he  then spun around and impelled  the other demon in the temple. Just like the first demon they glowed orange and collapsed to the ground.
on him. They  treated him like he was a bar room whore. This is  a horror film.  They  pulled  Sherlock's  curls and cut them from his head.
John however, put his hand up stopping any further conversation. He knew this would happen. Was she really cheating on him or was Sherlock just being well-... No even Sherlock wouldn't do that.
John watched the young man's eyes linger down his torso a little longer than necessary. When Sherlock's eyes finally made their way back up to John's face.
In the four months they been together she never actually met Sherlock but, says she wouldn't mind meeting the man . John always smiles at that . He never addresses the subject . He don't want Sherlock to mess this one up . John is  to happy with what he has . He lays back in bed with a sigh. It been a long day at surgery and to his delight Sherlock was nowhere in sight when he got home .He might actually get some sleep.
"  Let me go! They have Sherlock!" He knew he sounded like a maniac maybe he was after what he just experienced  . He just got his Sherlock back! He doesn't want to lose this one to!
Unable think through the fog of panic John just held up his hand holding the necklace, and  just prayed  to whoever is listening that this works.
“You know, the cases, work... you...” John said waving his hand around as he slouched further into his seat .
Sherlock rolls his eyes “ I don't care I just want to get a nicer room ….you two can stay in that filth and get whatever is Iingering in the sheets ,but I refuse to take one step inside. "
Sherlock hoisted his backpack onto his shoulder and cleared his throat "I have to get to class-" he awkwardly shifted his bag on his shoulder and started to the door.
.... John felt nothing ....No stomach churning lurch. No white noise filled his ears. No yellow light blinding him .....He still felt the touch of Khoung's inhuman cold hands on his.
"Well If I knew all it took was a picture and a bad date to get you to admit you like me I would have done it long ago..."John said with a wink. "I will admit the first was an accident. ..then well"He shrugged at the stunned man blinking at him " I wanted to see if I could get a reaction out of you."
Slowly but surely they took a step back one at a time . He blinks . Again the angel is closer now . He hears Elizabeth scream .
He was on the battlefield again .. gun fire whizzed past him ,  bombs exploding made his ears ring. He could feel the hot blood covering his hands and the stench of burning flesh burned his nose. Only this time he wasn't in Afghanistan he was somewhere else. Still in  a desert golden sand was  pained with blood. The screaming of children echoed in his ears. No this wasn't Afghanistan  this was something different somewhere different . This felt like a dream he once had but couldn't remember the next morning .
John looked down " I have a name you know" John grumbled to his dream Sherlock . "To be honest I don't know... " He scanned the darkening parking lot . No car .He walked out further.
When his eyes landed on Sherlock his heart felt like it jumped right out of his chest . He  padded over to the edge of the bed bare feet leaving small drops of water on the hardwood.
Sherlock looked him up and down his frightened yet calculating eyes took him in like the first time they met. "If not how the hell did you find me ? Not that I'm not grateful it's just ."he looks down at his feet and curled  up, pulling his knees up to his chest. His small frame shaking.
But if you guys want it to continue just let me know in the comments  and It will be done , though it might take a wile .
This young Sherlock will never stop taking his breath away.  Every time he looked over his heart twists and a warm sensation curled its way around his insides. Sherlock is  so small and thin , his skin is flawless and smooth like living ivory. His handsome brow lacked the stress lines of his future self had  permanently embedded there. Sherlock's eyes don't have heavy dark bags under them  -most likely do to his healthy sleep habits . Even his hair seemed more vibrant . His crisp chocolate curls were shiny  and seemed to be even more flouncy then the Sherlock he knew.
“Stop.” John voice is firm , he wanted this.  God knows he wants it. But not like this. Sherlock is so young . John came back and saved him from  rape. He can't force this boy to do something like this.
"I don't have a few days! What am I supposed to do for a few days" he  barked . Eyes still locked with the hissing lunatic  in front of him.
" How stupid do you think I am. Your cock may be attractive, but I do not simply "he makes quotation marks with his fingers " like you.”Slowly he crawled back into John's arms and placed a kiss on his lips.  "I love you , and your handsome cock .”
The demon carrying him tosses him to the ground.  " Why the hell did the king want us to take this boy?"
Sherlock looks up . " I messaged my lard of a brother to see if he knew anything about the stone. " He held up the message for them to read.
Sherlock closed his eyes and tentatively brought his hand up to John's face and softly kissed him back, unsure .
The Smokey mountains are breath taking and I would suggest to anyone who likes to hike, go . Its so warm for being October. Perfect weather!
" What trip?" John said confused by the nickname and the whole bloody conversation .  He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and sat down a few seats away from Sherlock. Best to keep his distance.
The shorter of the two ,Dean swatted excitedly at  his  brother's shoulder. "Just like in  the movies Sammy. " was all he said . That confused John. What movies? He smiled politely up at them as they chit chatted for a moment about how his and Sherlock's names ,were like the ones in the movies. Sam corrected Dean  that the movies were  books first. Dean just  shrugged and rolled his eyes like it didn't matter.
"  You can use my gun. “ Sam tossed it to John and smiles “ You bragged earlier so I wanna see what you can do -” John caught the gun blindly .
His whole body sizzled hotly as he watched John take Sebastian down like he was nothing but a rag doll. Sherlock sucked in his bottom lip . He couldn't explain why he was so incredibly happy .. Okay...Happy wasn't the right word, he
Pitt tightened his grip  and looked up at Wilberforce with tired swollen eyes.  “ We cracked crowns didn't we ? “ he murmurs softly after a short silence .
“Hello Doctor Watson "Mycroft said when John  got inside and closed the car door. "I see you are living up to the job I sent you back to do. "
John looked down at himself his mind racing. His eyes traced over the blood stains from the night before.
"Straight to business then ,I can see why I would have sent you  Doctor Watson. Khoung said he will some  need time to decipher the markings on the necklace. Do not worry it should not take too long. Khoung is fluent in Enochian.”
" The self control you have ." John wants to laugh as Sherlock's face contorted from confusion to three shades of adorable red.
It  was anything but peaceful or judging.  It was sinister , angry, murderous, with its sharp teeth bared ready to bite into him ,rip his flesh from his bone. It's frightening  fingers  curled , long claws caught the fading moon light peeking through the moss covered cypress trees.
"I know I'm right John ." Sherlock said evenly as he sat back, his legs tucked under him. "  I can deduce everything. I can see it in your eyes... the way you care for me . How you are so comfortable  with me like we been working together for years . You know my habits better than I do . What else could you be other than my boyfriend. " he waves a hand at John like it was obvious.  " You are just my type. A tall ,built solder, who's not completely boring and not as stupid as the rest of the world . You smile at my flaws ,and call my deductions amazing. " His voice broke at the end and  he lowered his head curls covering his eyes. " We are ...." His voice is nearly a whimper " together right?"
John took Sherlock's bag and hoisted it up to his shoulder. He smiled down at the short of man.  “ It will be  a lot better with you there . I might need your help . - "
"It's alright Doctor Watson.  If you want to get home let this man see it.  He might be able to help. "
" Well I would like to change that ." Sherlock said simply. " I'm sure my future self will appreciate my efforts. "
Sherlock rolls his eyes “  With the life you two lead.  I'm surprised you don't have a hospital in your car .  It was not that that hard to deduce "
! he found it ! He dug out the small glass case and opened it . With a trembling pale hand he slid his fingers over the sterile plastic hypnotic syringe.
"I  told you to call me Sebastian .I  think you know what I want. Do your little trick. It obvious you poof. "
Of course that's why he wanted to walk him to class.  John was sent back here to take care of him. Why ? Sherlock did not know ,but knowing Mycroft it was to keep him off the drugs. There is no other reason this stranger would want to walk him  to school... Right?... It was just his job nothing else.  John says that he is Sherlock's best friend , but he was best friends with a different person in that time . Someone  from the future, because  here Sherlock didn't have friends... This man was just easy to get on with.  It felt like they have  known each other for years...When in reality it hasn't  been any more then twenty four hours . Sherlock nodded " Well let's go then. It's a three minute and thirty five second walk to my first class from here. "
" I'm sure you can handle yourself John.  I seen the way you fared when they attacked  " Sherlock stated plainly .
He took a breath he didn't realize he was holding. It wasn't that John was a doctor . He has been to many  over caring professionals in his short sixteen years. It was the look in this mans eyes that made his breath hitch. He looked at Sherlock like he had known him for years, like he was the most important person in the world. Like this was normal for them...Like-  they did this every day. To him they where not stranger's.
He sucked in a deep breath trying to steady his heart rate and get some blood back to his brain.   No way he could walk to the bathroom like this....
“ That's what we are here for “ Elizabeth stood up clutching her arm. “ We need that things grace. Do you still have the supplies ?  With the five of us it should be easy to keep the angel immobile long enough to extract it. “
Sherlock tried to sit up, his body protested. After a moment he managed to get up and push the tangled blankets off his legs and carefully got off the bed.
Sherlock leaned up to the front seat " If you guys go head first into this ... something bad is going to happen... "
" You  guys da ones dat  called me? Didn't thank I be meetn an army of good looken men. " Her eyes roamed over each one of them; first John then Sherlock ,Dean, than Sam . Her eyes linger on Sam a bit longer than the others. Her blue irises flowing the shape of Sam  legs up chest to his shoulders . She smiles , pretty pink lips curling up to perfect points.
John swallowed heavily placed the necklace in his pocket. If he is going to get this young version of Sherlock to trust him he is  going to have to play the game.
The woman looked down a her clipboard and rummaged through the pages "He's not on stage today but if you still want to see him he's down the hall in dance room 801. "She gave John a slip and wandered off back to her spot by the door. John glanced over the paper she gave him  as he walked down the hall.
" WHA!! No w'y yous a yankee!! ? “ The man looks over at Sherlock and John like they were some kind of treasure . “ Hay Dion-" he shouted loudly at a burly black man with a white vest and pants that almost hung to his knees .
Now he was in the same situation . A Fist coming down on him for something he has no control over ,words ripping at his self-esteem . Sebastian Wilkes like all of the other people don't care .
"Yes of course . I can be in America in a few days. If you think you can help me. I can bring the necklace. " Why were they surprised? Oh well he didn't have time for that. Mycroft did say that Bobby guy was American so a call from some time traveling British man might be a bit much for them.
" We need to go before this thing attacks again. “ John guided Sherlock away.  " We got what we came for . Elizabeth needs to get that cut taken care of . Come on we have a first aid kit in the car. "
“ No I do not think we have had the pleasure. “ He snapped off his gloves hoping no one would notice how his hands were shaking.
( triple sugar iron agar) they were was positive for Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Though he knew what is  when it grew out on his MacConkey agar plate ,the distinctive large, pink, mucoid colonies that grew out was all he needed, but he did the additional testing just for the fun of it.  Hopefully Mycroft would get pneumonia .He deserves it after sending a man like John into his life then ripping  him away  just as quickly as he came. Why did he send him anyway just to take him away so soon?  If the Doctor  was here to help Sherlock with his drug abuse should he stay longer ? Or was he sent back  just for that time in the warehouse ? Could John been sent back just to stop what ever was going to happen? Sherlock knew if John didn't show up it would have gotten bad ....really bad. He didn't need his deductive ability to see what was going though those men's minds. Hunger, anger , and a frightening amount of lust. Sherlock bit  his lips, got up from the table and started cleaning up. He tossed  the TSI tubes into the biohazard waste and placed  organisms  in a red Biohazard  bag to keep the smell out of the lab, then tossed them out as well.  He bleached his table and hung up his lab coat. He was about to grab his bag when a familiar head sporting a black mohawk rounded  the corner.
John smiles to himself . He did that. He made Sherlock Holmes happy . John  fixed the day that changed his life forever and Sherlock will never know.
His eyes drifted down John's body hidden by a fluffy warm cotton jumper and a pair of sensible sleep shorts. Sherlock seen the strength hidden there...The shape, the art.....
Crowley noticed, Dean cut in clearly not likening that  he was not getting the attention of the rather pretty girl.
"I know you are  desperate to get home but don't risk your self or my county in the process ! We have your jet ready earlier then expected-"
"Incredible. "Sherlock murmured . "I haven't had  anyone deduce me like that, aside from my brother. "
For a moment Sherlock  stood there blushing genuinely stunned. It took Sherlock a matter of fifteen seconds to compose himself ,force down his blush and replace it with a mask of boredom.
John, looked at the impala door , it's been ripped open on the other side.  Sherlock and the girl were pulled out by the demons.
Sherlock sighed and hoisted his bag in the boot.  After all their belongings were packed away  John slipped in the back seat with Sherlock.
The young boy scurried up beside john and linked himself  at  John's side. He wrapped both if his  hand around Johns  left bicep and fells the taunt muscle there. He smiled up at the sliver blond hair man.  "I'm Fine. " Sherlock was ready to set his plan into motion. He had a few good ideas stirring around.
Somehow, young Sherlock found a blue ice pop. He sat on the bed nearest to the wall casualty half naked in nothing but his black silk pants . Miles of flawless ivory skin on display . Sherlock's body was toned and hard from his dance classes . The doctor in him notices -all of his bruising was a gone now. Somehow despite his thin muscular  frame Sherlock's boyish softness only complemented his enthrall beauty. John sucked in a deep heavy breath . The air around him felt like it was sucked out with a vacuum- squeezing his lungs to tight . He wheezes .
! .Soon he was dipping, dancing ,  arms moving like the wings of a swan , toes pointing.  ….he was..
The angel tried to  attack again but it didn't get far. Crowley stopped it just  before it got to the group. He stood there watching it making sure   John Watson got away.
"That's alcohol abuse" Dean said to the leather face man - Wild Bill. The man let out a bellow of a laugh tipped his beer up to his mouth and finished it off in a few long gulps.
" Stop ! You aren't even wearing gloves-" Lucas  tried again in vain. He chased after Sherlock  as the door  swings open.
They made it to Louisiana in a couple hours . The sun began to rise over the endless bridges and the never ending water passing them by . Mile after mile ,they were almost through New Orleans now. The humidity and the unique smell of Louisiana air filtered through the open windows of the impala. John felt his shirt sticking to him. It was an awful feeling. Hot , wet and filthy. How did people live here? He glanced over at Sam in the passenger side . He was curled up . It boggles John's mind: how such a huge man can look so small at times. His eyes drifted to the other side of the car to Sherlock. The young man had a thin sheen of sweat covering his forehead, his breathing was increased but not enough to worry about simply a symptom of  altitude change . His dark curls were wet and plastered to his forehead and neck .
He would be alone with Sherlock ... in the heat ; with Sherlock's already to tight clothing clinging to him .  " Wait. " John said quickly. " You're right Sam should be out here. He knows how to kill demons better than I do-"
John leans sherlock back gently strong arms holding the taller man's weight with ease. He followed him down -
Elizabeth didn't take her eyes off the angel . “ You need to mix the ingredients you  collected,  firsthand me the chains. “ She made quick work at placing the chains on the angel s' wrist . It was a shoddy job the best, it would have to do. The Winchester started mixing the oil with a shiny liquid from a vile . John watched as Dean sliced his finger and let the blood drip into the bole.
He hoped he hadn't overstepped a line....what exactly did he want when John got in here. With Johns loving words from before playing in his head. John said he loved him right?  He could smell Johns arousal taste it on his lips
John looked down at his phone as the dial tone echoed in the empty room ...He couldn't stop the fit of laughter that escaped.  Hearing Sherlock say that was so worth the embarrassment. Sherlock deleted it . They were both grown men ...It was all fine . He laughed for a little longer called Leeanna . Told her what happened they laughed together said their good night and John fell into a rather peaceful sleep.
He grumbled softly  as he looks  around .Dean and Sherlock both looked suspiciously guilty. John made note of his body . No whip cream on his hands , no toothpaste in his nose- he squinted at Dean and Sherlock then glanced around  taking in stock his surroundings  . What did they do ? He sits up looking around then spots little sticky notes on Sam's back .
Sherlock took a deep breath.... he could still smell it....God he really has became addicted...... He glanced down at himself his the fabric of this thin pajamas were straining. ...it seems Johns arousal and sweet words got to him....he licked his lips...maybe John was right its best to head to bed...
To John's surprise Dean calls out the guy's name and that they need his help . He even said something about kicking his" feathery ass."
God what's wrong with him? Sure he's thought about Sherlock once or twice during a wank. The man  is attractive . No question there.
"Of course you can not . Oh ,John when you go inside do be quiet  he is not to fond of strangers watching him dance. "
Pitching the bridge of his nose. Lucas huffs " We don't need any help -" he hissed angry. This man called Henry an idiot . He was the smartest man Lucas knows. "Henry's  perfectly capable of handling this mess on his own . We don't need these two . Why are they here Jo?" by the end of his sentence Lucas was seething. Why was she  not defending Henry against this man? - She knows as well he does ; Henry is no idiot.
John found himself laughing with them. He could only imagine what that poor man was thanking when two large men like Sam and Dean walk in there asking for something so ridiculous. "As it turns out he was a hunter, we told him what we were really looking for " their laughter died down and Dean held up a small black bag . "Only one more ingredient to go. " Sam looks down at his watch : a few hours before the sun goes down . " I'm not sure what a stone from a weeping angel is but don't worry we can do a bit of research. "  John smiles at that." Hopefully this works .  "
Crowley  is going to get his hands on that man no matter how hard the  Winchester try to stop him. The moment John Watson summoned him he knew ; Khoung had kept his word, after millennia of waiting and searching they found him. Even  better yet they found him with the necklace.
"Oh don't flatter yourself old man "He flicked his hand and walked inside with Mycroft’s card in the other. " ...Maybe I should do all your shopping for you~" He said with a playful wink before swaggering inside.
Then he felt the older man's strong hand on his shoulder. "Sherlock. Look at me . You're okay now. You're safe. "
Sherlock made the driver stop outside a clothing store just a few blocks from the dorms ." We can walk from here." He told Mycroft's driver. John sighed softly . It seems he can't even put his bloody jumper on before they go shopping.
"Please stop...I gave you the money-NO DON'T TOUCH ME !" the young man's voice cracked as he curled up tighter into his blankets .
These past three weeks have been interesting as well, a new murder appeared in New York . He  is remarkable, a modern-day Jack the Ripper. The killer leaves no evidence behind and there is always a surgical trophy removed. He had been the one to point out the connection between the kills. The lieutenant was grateful, as it turns out she was glad to have him on the case. It makes him happy that the people in his life  respected him as much as they do.
Sherlock feels arms, strong and warm, cage around him and draw him against a hammering heart. He feels air stir at his hairline. He feels a dry hand press at the nape of his neck, fingers curling him closer as if he would disappear at any moment. He hears an unsteady sigh.
" Enochian? - Hay Dean take a look at this . " The brothers orbit  together ,shoulders brushing, legs melding under the table as they lean into each other .
"Yeah-" his voice broke as the lie fell from his lips.  It came as easy as breathing. What else could he say to explain the tears streaming down his face and  the trembling wrecking his body.
The doctors breath hitched ,he was scared to blank,  scared he might miss something.  "S...Sherlock you don't have t-" before he could finish, his head fell back.  He tried to keep his eye's on the man licking the tip of his swollen head.
he snapped harshly - instantly regretting it when he felt Abe recoil away from him removing his arms off of his shoulders and taking two steps back.
Dean pats  the girl on the back and nods to where he parked his car. "Alright show us what we need to do. We got angel blades if the dicks try anything funny. "The girl nods  and follows them to the impala hiding just beyond Crowley's sight . He  snapped his fingers; that was the signal and his demons where on the move.
Sherlock could hear his blood rushing in his ears . Cold  tremors went down his spin like needles . He wanted to flee, but he couldn't move , he couldn't look away his eyes glued to that thing .  Terror held him in place like a vice-like grip.
" We should call Cas on this one. I don't thank we have anything in the books. " Dean mumbled as he shuffled through the stacks of papers on the table. Sam hummed in agreement. He flipped the pendant in his hand over and over in his palm.
" Well that's just perfect - I bet he and his demon minions are hot on our heels so Crowley can get his filthy little hands on it. Hay Sammy  look up  this Khoung guy see what you can find. Maybe we can find out a bit more about this case. " Dean mumbled . " We need to get you home before he does have a chance to get it. "
"SONOFABITCH JOHN WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!" Dean yelled, "There’s  more coming! They got the kids!!"
Dean huffed . " Well we also could ask a demon so we don't have to take a long trip down to nowhere Louisiana  ."
Sherlock wipes his mouth and sets the paper towel down . " He's on the phone arranging  a meeting with the guy who makes the synthetic grace." As if summon by the thought of him alone John comes around the corner and hands Sam him mobile . " She  said we can meet them tomorrow at 210 Leona around 8 am no earlier. She said they are busy tonight but tomorrow we can start gathering supplies. "
It happens like a slow motion scene in the film. Something grey flashes from behind John.  It catches in his peripheral vision. His body moved ,his fist came up before the gun . John put his whole body into the punch ;he felt the bones in his fingers crack on the impact.  It was like he was hitting stone.
military instincts kicked in. He didn't recognize his surroundings ,so the captain grabbed his gun every hair on his body stood at attention. Ready ....waiting....
They made their way out of the busy airport to the vast parking lot toting their bags behind them. Mycroft didn't pack much but John didn't plan on staying very long anyway.  He followed the two strangers zigzagging through the cars when John found himself face to face with  a beautiful classic, sleek-black 67 Chevy impala.
Wilberforce heart shatters in his chest leaving sharp shards twitching and stabbing at his insides. The words cut him deerper then any knife  and hurt worse than any pain. He takes a breath and askes;
The sound made Sherlock whine.  John was beautiful - Sherlock leaned up and brushed his mouth back and forth over John's collarbone, then moved his soft lips up settling  on the side of the doctor's neck, pressing kisses into it. He moved on to John's ear, licking inside it, nibbling on its lobe. Pulling in a deep breath from the man . Sherlock could feel the heavy girth   of John in his hand , throbbing,
Sherlock watched the doctor. He must have someone at home...someone he cared about .It was clear he was thinking about them. The way his face lit up and his eyes soften his pupils dilated.
The angle shakes his head " It won't work -" he said pointing to the object of interest. " He was sent back with this and he needs to get sent home with this. "
Sherlock want to groan they weren't getting a hotel room?! How was he going to seduce John before he goes home if they stay here?! Sherlock hits his forehead on the seat in front of him. "Alright....I am coming John. "He said as evenly as possible. ..Theses two men better not rush this. Sherlock took a deep breath through his nose . Into battle then.
What was he summing ? The devil ? He scoffed and continued . This was all to much he shook himself and started chanting before he could talk himself out of it . After everything he had been though that might not be impossible..
John's demeanor transformed into his professional medical persona, critically examining Sherlock from where he lay. He lifted Sherlock's legs and sat down placing the slim roots on his lap. He then lifted up Sherlock's pajama legs slowly checking his ankles. The swelling has gone down but the bruises are a lot more prominent now. Nothing to worry about if he wraps it¹ and stays off it for a few days ; he will be fine.
Suddenly he spotted Dean standing as still as gravestones around them. John tried to run past him but Dean grabbed his arm.
Slowly he opened  envelope. Pages of what looked like copies from old handwritten book  fell out . John looked over each page of old handwritten notes.
“ This is impossible.  “ Henry shift his weight from foot,  he wanted to reach out touch the ghost from his past just to see if he was real.
Sherlocks whole body was a flame the look on John's face was unbearable....pure hunger.... Love and the same admiration hung his his blue irises. He licked his lips his eyes moving down to John's exposed body his shoulders  were shaking. the muscles on his arms strained against the beautiful bronze skin ....down down his eyes wondered over the beautiful plans of his flat stomach memorizing every scare mole freckle dip of muscle into his mind palace...soon his eyes made their way to the prize waiting between John's legs.
That voice...It sounded like Sherlock....but this voice was a pitch higher. Not by much.... Almost as if Sherlock was a teen . The sound of rustling and fighting, grunts and fist meeting skin made John move quickly. What if Sherlock was in danger?  He lifted the gun and made his way quietly around the corner.
”Turn around. On your hands and knees." His voice was gruff and quite but it held all the command to send A shiver down the younger man’s body.
Long, glistening and hard against his stomach, lying against neatly groomed light curls and tan skin.
Henry coughs” yes the case -  I'm quite alright I assure you Detective Martinez. Now let me show you what we  were discussing.” he leads them over to the body and starts on his long descriptive  explanation about the surgically removed organs.
"Mycroft?" he said wiping his mouth even if nothing came up . He looked around. ...What the hell? Where did he go ? This was not funny.
Sherlock  spun around to face Dean. He crossed his arms and stared defiantly up at the much taller man." I am to aloud in there. I am a grown man! It's not like it would be my first time in a place like that." He gestures to the door  Dean was blocking . Dean grins down at Sherlock amusement visible on his face . " You're what? Fifteen ? Sixteen ? Sorry kid you gotta be  eighteen in the states . Now back to your booster seat. " Dean teased.
Sherlock was board ,hot and miserable. Nothing has happened since the demons attacked. His legs were cramping, and he couldn't stop sweating even with the cool air blasting from the vents. He was ready to get a room ,preferably one with a strong air conditioner , good water pressure and John . Sherlock glanced over at the blond hair army doctor . The shirt Sherlock chose for him was sticking to his body like a second skin. The one good thing about this terrible humidity and the miserable weather is the way John's clothing clung . He was sweating but not enough for it to bleed through the fabric in nasty wet spots or darkening circles under his armpits. It was just enough to make the cotton cling just the right way over his broad chest complementing every dip of muscle hidden underneath, the cotton hugged his biceps deliciously.
He sucked his bottom lip and nibbled....Eyes glued to the picture . Less than half of his cock was covered by the small red pants John seems to favor. The fabric was straining against the girth....the foreskin was drawn back revealing beautiful shiny wet head that rested near his navel...
"I told you what you seen this morning was a mistake . John slipped I tried to catch him but fell with my bad ankles . "He rolled his eyes and waved his hand at his swollen ankles. " He's also  not gay Mycroft. Do keep your worries to yourself. John is more then welcome to stay with me for his remaining time ! I have a bed in the spare room and all of his clothing are  at my place anyway. "
Something caught his attention. A small whimper came from the room he and  John shared . Licking his lips he put his back to the wall and peeked in through the small crack. He froze eyes wide.
" Hay where do you think you're going shorty." Dean said  grabbing Sherlock by his small shoulders and steering him away from Digglers small black door.
Sherlock took a deep breath arms in the air...slowly  he excelled.  He brings  his arms down with that ending his practice for the day . The class ended  bit earlier  than normal.  Sherlock didn't mind, it just gives him time to head to the lab and  check the incubator to  see if that bacteria "
“That's why you are meeting me before the sun goes down silly boy. I knew you would find most of the list but I didn't think you would find them so fast. Listen to me. How about you and your friends meet me at the cemetery in an hour .It will be easier to get the angel when it's still light. " Sam nods even if she can't see it.
" You scared the hell out of me Sammy ! You can't just run off like that." Sam bumped Dean's shoulder with his playfully.
"Calm down. Sherlock is in no danger at this moment. In fact he is sleeping on the sofa as we speak. "
"Let me see the necklace "He said taking John's hand in his like the Mycroft in his time did. John shivered at the touch but didn't pull away.  How could one man's hands be so cold?
"  Hello detective.  " he said a cold feeling flushed over him. There in her hand was the  picture of him, Abigail  and baby Abe .
"I don't know if they can help you Doctor Watson.  The Winchester's may be talented but they have a tendency to cause more problems than it's worth.
Soon they were headed back to Sam and Dean bunker . In  another day or so John would be on his way back home. He smiled … It had been a long week . He has  learned and seen so much . Enough to change his life - and Sherlock’s forever. He watched as the foreign landscapes  change from state border , to state border . He won't ever forget this. Unless of course , some law of time travel makes him forget … He doesn't want to. He looked over at the dozing Sherlock sleeping curled up at John's  side . His little face burred  in John's shirt. John don't want to forget this…. The time he fell in love with Sherlock all over again. He runs his fingers though the messy mop of curls. Most people don't have the opportunity  to find real love once in their lifetime. John is - he got to experience it twice. He smiles and closes his eyes. They were all tired, but he couldn't sleep; so instead they drove all the way back to Lebanon, Kansas.
When the blonde man standing on the boy lifted him up by the hair . All the air left Johns lungs suddenly everything fell into place .
During  the drive  to the airport Mycroft sat watching his brother and the time traveling doctor talk . He has never seen his brother smile this much. He and this Doctor Watson fit like a snug puzzle piece. He couldn't explain it. When John made a joke about the supernatural , Sherlock let out a laugh Mycroft hasn't heard since his brother was a kid. He tapped his fingers on his umbrella his observant eyes on the two not missing anything. Sherlock thought he was hiding his  developing crush keeping his face turned away from Mycroft but he could see through it .  The politician smiled to himself. Sending Sherlock to the US with John might actually do the boy some good.  Time away from the boredom and the drugs  could only help. No way he would pass up this opportunity.
“They tell me you are improving Willy . “ he purred softly. He tucks the tails of his coat under him as he sits down on the bed where his hand once was. He’s much closer now…
The tip was an angry red leaking pulled back from the foreskin.  it curved beautifully up past his belly button......He was ....rather large....not monstrous , no just something most men would envy and make women's ....and Sherlock's mouth water.
Dean was about to laugh. He remembered the first and last time he punched the angle- he thought he broke his fist.
John was breathing heavy, the rage still burning throughout his body... “I need a drink.” he scoffed.
A weak smile crosses Wilberforce face just a flesh of a smile. Their eyes meet , Wilberforce's brown eyes  lost  themselves in the odd arawy of silver,gray green eyes of Pitts...  the only can his eyes can be described is..... angelic...
“Your not gone yet . “Wilberforce squeezes his hand feeling a sting behind his eyes ...his vision started to get so blurry ...he didn't want to hear these words.   It's to soon…
"You could say that. Your brother's pet psychopath had me summon a demon who wanted my soul in return for sending me home . You know the bloody usual. " John said with dismay.
"Wha.." Sherlock started to ask before John wrapped Sherlock's fingers around the base of his cock.. keeping  his hand on top of  of Sherlock's, using  both of their hands to stroke up once...
John tapped his chin as a thank you. " That don't sound like a bad idea actually. " he admitted light-heartedly.  " Could work and I don't have to worry about hurting your angel friend.  "
The black man . Dion tosses his arms up and shouts back . They weren't yelling Sherlock noticed . They were all just .....Loud.
All of it. It's all out there.  Of course it is. It makes since. He has seen things in war that no human could possibly do.  The gruesome and unexplainable . He always questioned in the back of his mind but never asked out loud like a good l soldier. Finally it all had an explanation. The logical part of his brain ,like any other ordinary man wants to dismiss it to forget it all and just go home. He sighs softly and rans a hand through his short sliver blond hair.
Johns breath hitched his heart started to race.  His hand shot up and griped Sherlock's thin wrist and pulled it away from his neck ...Hot liquid arousal shot though his body at the sight of Sherlock on his knees shuffling over to him ...night gown falling over his delicate shoulder.... he swallowed loudly with a click.
John was shocked to find out the odd ingredients were not as obscure and unobtainable as he thought.  The first ingredient :
John choked on his saliva and fell into a fit of laugher and choughs. "My son? You mean Sherlock? Heavens no. He's my best friend."
The man fell back with ease. John nodded not really knowing what sherlock was asking but at this point he didn't care.....
,,"When you put it that way. How can I say no?" Sherlock smiles up at him  " Thank you John." The words
Standing in front of him just a breath away WAS what should have been standing on one of the gravestones ; a stone angel  stood there watching hollowed eyed and dangerous . It had  pieces of stone crumbling  off but never fully breaking apart. There were cracks all throughout the angels stone robe , though it wings and body...
"Find out what makes it tick. And Mycroft, set up a jet for two. I want to be in the United  States within three days no later. Understand? And Khoung if you figure that out before then we won't need the jet. " He strolled back over to the car got in  and slammed the door leaving both men standing in shock.
“John do try not to break all the dishes.” He walked into the small kitchen and leaned against the table. “ Put the brandy down let me make you a cuppa ya. ?"
John is in the bunker alone with Mycroft's - freaky -friend? Khoung , and gets an envelope filled with strange instructions.
Home , Sherlock , 221 B , Mrs. Huston everything seems to be slipping through his fingers. He don't want to hurt an angel by taking it's 'grace' or whatever if it can render them powerless or mortal . That would be awful. John don't want that on his conscience . There had to be another way. John scrubbed his face. If the grace thing was the only way to activate the necklace then how the hell did Mycroft send him back? There is no way Mycroft Holmes was an angle.
"Everyone keep looking at it. " Elizabeth said as she cautiously  walked over to the angel " " John, Sherlock stop making out and come help us!”
He tries to impress them with his best skill ,deductions. Again a fist to the nose or a variety of colorful names and phrases. Why can't they just for once say " W
"The dorms sir. A about a mile south of here." Sherlock mumbled in a small voice. John felt the small boy tremble in his arms. Something about the way 'Sir ' sounded coming  out of Sherlock's mouth sent bolts of something sweet though John's veins.
He lays back not bothering to shut the light off.... This might end up being fun. He lays down and instantly gets a reply.  John quickly opens the message . This time the picture is her facing the camera nude with the same wicked smile.
There is 1.372 meters....So that makes 4.5  feet between the two beds. The room didn't leave much space for bags and other personal items. Good . Closeness and crowded quarters provide opportunity for 'accidents' like tripping on John's bag and falling on top of him landing on the  floor or his bed....Maybe even walking in on John as he takes off his shirt. But...if he takes in the sound vibrations and density of the walls . It could prove a problem. If he did managed to seduce John the chances of the two brothers hearing them could be from zero to ten. He needed to find their rooms to get an accurate distance for sound travel . It wouldn't have been a problem at a hotel; but here  the two men knew how old or about how old Sherlock is . In the USA 16 was illegal and that in itself could cause trouble for John. They might decide not to help him if they deemed him a pervert who preyed  on underage boys. Sherlock scoffed he was not a boy he was a grown man-
" We found a hunter down in Louisiana that makes synthetic angel grace. We want to see if we can get some from him. " Sam said as he slid John a cup of coffee.
John finally got out of the car;  the humidity instantly hitting him like a brick wall. " I can stay with him." He really didn't want to go into a sex shop with a man he just  meet a few days ago... to buy chains- and he definitely didn't want to go in after his dream.
" Maybe later we need to get a room ..." John looked back at Sherlock obviously as lost as he was and gave Sherlock a look that said it all.
The nurse patting away the sweat from Pitt’s brow turns to leave, the others follow seconds after. Once they were out of the room Wilberforce finished his journey to his best friends bedside.  He places a hand close to Pitt’s hip not touching- never touching it's too dangerous. From his spot on the bed he could feel Pitts fever radiating through the thick wool covers.
They walked down to the black Sudan waiting in front of the dorms. "This is insanity you expect me to believe this man is from the future? " Sherlock grumbled at his brother.
.....Arousal is a better way to put it.  How could someone be so...damn gorgeous kicking some poor sods arse?
Once they stopped laughing the young dark hair waitress came back with their tea. She placed Sherlock's down first, then brushed her shoulder against John while placing his hot cup in front of him . She gave the older man  a wink and dropped a piece of paper next to his hand .
John put him down carefully. The doctor was breathing heavily, but he wasn't in as bad shape as his Sherlock seem to think he was. John may have gained seven pounds but what the madman didn't know was John's been going to the gym with a few mates from his rugby days .He gained muscle weight unlike Mr. bones over there. He smiled to himself as he dug for the key. He wished he could show his Sherlock he could pick him carry him across town. Surely he didn't weigh much more than this Sherlock did. He was about a foot taller then this kid  but he could still show him.
"Oh god." he said when he seen who was sent the message. How the hell did he send it to Sherlock! !!? Panic and embarrassment flared up and pulled him under . Quickly as he could he pushed the call button ...
Dean looks at Sam, and he shrugs sitting down next to him. Sherlock's head pops up from the other side of the pile with his mouth full of food. Dean looks over at him with amusement "Looks like you're going to need a bigger mouth."
Crowley  stood by the large stone mausoleum shrouded by the  large cypress tree looming over him. The long grey moss that seemed to grow on every surface of the ground made for easy cover . He  watched as the familiar sleek black Impala rumble up the driveway of the cemetery to a spot in the distance that couldn't be seen from the road or any other passer-by. A smart tactic , always  the ever vigilant Winchesters. He's been following them since his demons failed to grab the doctor .
It seemed like the skinny man heard him " yuz looken for Izzy?" He said with a smile that showed nothing but black teeth and darkening gums. " She said she be having friends over- she inzide go head get hur. " His thick Cajun accent was grovel like he smoked to many cigarettes with bronchitis.
"Client? This late ? " Thank god for distractions. .John's head was still spinning with embarrassment.  He can't handle much more of this. Sherlock was acting so casual like he didn't get a picture of his best friends prick and a provocative pin up of him on the kitchen table.
Dean didn't even have the boot open before they came at them. Sam shot a round into  one of the demons head , then another , it didn't fall. Dean tossed Sam a knife and tossed John the same sliver blade he had   in the last attack. John didn't need it he still had Sam's demon killing gun. Two shots ,two demons down, but they still keep coming . They were close now.
For a moment John forgot his dilemma of being stuck in the past -with this jealous young man who couldn't keep his eyes off of him .
"Leeanna... uhm.... what are you doing here? " he didn't want to sound rude but she did just show up unannounced and  just barged in . "Not that I'm not happy to see you its just... well..."
John flinched. What the hell was that! Something about this man was unnerving and made his heart race.-
John held Sherlock close....they stayed like that for what seemed like forever ....riding their orgasmic high . No words were needed ...Just each other was enough to know. ..this this was all fine they were fine...better then fine....they were finely where they belong in each other's arms....
"Of course I am . I won't let Sherlock get hurt like that  again .  Let's just cut to the chase. What did ol crazy hair say about the necklace ?"
John comes back from his phone call and sits next to Sherlock being mindful not to get to close . He looks' over the food on the table and pokes  at one of the red steaming creatures. " Well can't be worse than what the army made us  eat. " John joked dryly .
Sherlock couldn't help but to smile when he heard the soft sound of  John's phone falling to the floor in the bathroom .
John felt Sherlock's small warm hands on his bare arm . The feeling  sent small shivers down his spin...He and his Sherlock touch all the time ..but not this much...never in public. It was always simple touches . Like a hand on the small of  Sherlock's back or their feet tingling when they sat across from each other in the comfort of their flat, a brush of fingers when John hands Sherlock his tea. Pressing their shoulders against each other in the cab with their bodies buzzing with  adrenaline after a good chase through the streets of London. One thing that never seemed to change with Sherlock was that look in his eyes. That  madding intelligence and the way he could see right through him . Even at this age.
He waited, butterflies making a mess of his stomach. Sherlock wasn't use to all of these emotions ....it was a bit ....unnerving.
Sherlock never felt so exposed and ...if he was honest...He was …. frighted he knew John wouldn't hurt him.... But he couldn't stop his heart  from beating , his face from burning with embarrassment and fear from showing on his face . So he covered his face and held his breath . Embarrassingly enough: a whole five seconds of terrifying delight . John leaned forward brushing his hand against the underside of Sherlock's pale  bottom with one and experimentally touching behind his balls with the other.
" DAMMIT " the demon hollowed when Sherlock gave him a rather nasty bite. The boys sharp little teeth broke skin.
When he turned around Khoung was standing there with a black  umbrella over his head it had ...John hated to say it :cute little red skulls hanging off the ends of it like something out of Wednesday Adams wardrobe. Sherlock would of had a field day with this loon.
Soon they were pulling into the bunkers secret garage, the door came up and Dean parked his baby with the other classics cars that lived there.
"Sam!" Dean called, quickly grabbing his gun. He runs over to the window his back to the wall using  the muzzle of the gun to push back the curtains just an inch to see outside. It was dark , why did Sam let him sleep so long? .
Sherlock’s baritone washed over Henry’s skin like a warm sun rise and a fresh spring morning breeze. “ After you eliminated the impossible. Whatever left remains however improbable must be the truth.”
Lucas pushed past the man and into the lab still chattering on “ Henry I am so sorry I really did try to keep them out but this man wouldn't take no for an answer - Jo just said let him see the body”
John and young Sherlock were inside his dark,messy, cluttered, flat now and for once John was thankful for the darkness and clutter. It helped cover his blush John let out a chuckle.
"Right yeah...uhm.  It's the old warehouse just a few minutes away from here." John said his eyes still glued on the strange man . Why didn't Mycroft  say anything about this man  in his time? And why the hell is he wearing sunscreen !? They were in bloody London!
Rage blinded him, his body was shaking. He couldn't read the look on Leeanna's face, he didn't care. Lying and cheating behind his back then coming over in the middle of the night to meet Sherlock. That was over the line -
They were all writing , reading , taking notes and working on the switch boards.  It was like a busy office with crazy glowing markings  painted all over the walls.
He don't say any of that . He just smiles at Mycroft and holds out his hand to shake the other man's " Well he does seem to have a good taste in men ."He joked softly.
“Thank you.... You knew didn't you ? Probably before you even met her.... Thank you for not telling me .... "
Dean collapses on the bed face down ." Just two hours Sammy." He mumbles his deep voice muffled by the scratchy pillow case .Sam sits next to his brother and adjust the flannel on his neck . "Get some rest Dean.”
He felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. The doctor moved away from Sherlock to the kitchen,  since he was up might as well make tea to keep his hands busy so he can  ignore the constant buzzing in his pocket.
" Fine." the younger man pouted. If Khoung couldn't get  John  home in the next two days he has a chance of spending time with the Doctor alone when they go to United States. He rolled over on the sofa to hide his smile. He might even get to share a hotel room with him . A giddy feeling swelled in his gut . Better make the most of it while John is still here.
She told them how she got the cut - by jumping in front of Sherlock when  the angel  attacked . John couldn't be more thankful.
He watched as his brother climbs inside with a stranger from the future ....before Sherlock disappeared inside the jet Mycroft states "If you need my help bother .Just say the word. "
Harry's heart stopped. This can't be. The word him like a tidal wave it's been over 200 years since he's heard that name, that voice. This is  impossible-
Another car putters up the driveway ; a small  shiny deep-blue Volkswagen beetle. It didn't park as discretely as the boys had, so who ever it is don't care if they are seen.   Crowley watched as a short , fit girl with short purple and blonde hair got out . She wiped the perspiration from her forehead and looked around.   Her face lit up when the Winchesters and their two lovely companions walked down the path; she met them half-way.
Dean smiled back at him “ Welcome home boys better get comfy we got a few hours before we head out tomorrow. "
" Why don't we just kill em?" The Demon said his  lips curling into something nasty his black eyes shimmering with sick humor.
"My ,My how did you get your hands on that? You must be  part of the British men of letter. "He seemed like he wanted to take a step closer but didn't move.
The other man's face turned the same shade of red as an apple .Sherlock seen it coming.  The fist came fast, but he  ducked  away in time his ankles ached with the movement.  After his dance classes his ankles swelled up and the bruises really started to ache. He lost his footing for just a moment  and the next punch got him right in the stomach.
Loud American classic rock echoes in the air around them. Dean sat singing to every song on the radio . His hands tapped the steering wheel to the  beat of every song. Sam was sleeping in the front seat next to his brother.
John's eyes snapped open...Something resembling panic rose up from somewhere deep inside John.   A panic he hadn't felt since he was shot.
John looked up from his brandy and smiled at Sherlock, how can a man so smart be so slow on somethings?
Yes he is smarter than everyone. Of course he doesn't understand how normal ordinary people work, and yes he is a homosexual .
The door creaked open  and John poked his head in "W...what do you want? "he cleared his throat and cleared his throat again . He felt as if this were  a dream and he was about to wake up. slowly he entered the bedroom ,suddenly feeling  exposed.
Sherlock looks at him like he's crazy . "Transport?." He scoffs.  " What kind of man do I turn out to be if there's a man like you in front of me and I don't want to….. " he licks his lips and his eyes travels  up and down John lazily  ,slowly.  His eyes saying it all.
The word dropped from Sherlock lips like a stone in the water , only this stone was about to cause a title wave.
He hasn't been able to stop smiling ,even young Lucas noticed.  Today when the cops found a new body they believed to be connected to the Laxx case. Lucas promised Henry he could work on it in  quiet alone . All in all it's been a lovely three weeks.
John just glared back at him waiting for him to do something,  hissing like a maniac or not John was not about to scurry away.
What if the two men  find a way to activate that necklace and send John home  before Sherlock can help his future self get past first base. He needs more time.
John looked over at Sherlock. The boy had  been eerily quiet . "Hey you alright? " John places a hand on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock jumps a bit.
...God he was going crazy a month  without a case higher then a three, John has  been with that girl and at surgery.
Sherlock tilts  his head looking up through his lashes , eyebrows knitting together.  "Most close partners are best friends? That's how is supposed to go." He said it like a question. Of course he did.
The man chuckled softly , a warm rusty sound. "Ah I see . Well my help comes with a price. "He straighten his shirt cuff and looked John in the eye. The look made cold gooseflesh rise up the back of John's neck.
He pulled his pants down and gave himself a few teasing strokes ...Arousal pulled at the base of his spine.  He could feel the blood rushing away from his brain , soft stroke, after soft stroke, slowly he brought himself to full hardness. Carefully he pulled his pants up just to cover part of his shaft . No way his pants could cover it fully erect  . He angled his phone just right and took another very flattering picture. He nodded to himself he has  never been one for taking pictures but this is and exception.
His first instinct was to push away, but he couldn't.  He  sat there ....Unable to process any thing- his brain off line.
Sherlock fought back the need to grit his teeth. He don't mind freak but... poof? That stung more than it should.
When the two men notices John, Sam smiles weakly at him then looks back at his brother "let's let him decide.  "
The taller man's eyes narrowed "And what makes you think I will help you after you assaulted my  brother ?"
Crowley tilted his head , the way she is talking is nothing like the angels he has  met. This girl must be leading these boys on..
Johns eyes widened . He felt his face heat up. Unable to hide the blush that he knew was there . Of course that's how Mycroft sees them.  That's how everyone sees them. Though Sherlock don't feel things that way - in his time anyway. A  disturbing thought crossed his mind .
Sam shrinks away from the man's touch and steps closer to Dean " Maybe later we need to get a room ..."
Sherlock smirked "You seem worried bother. Don't be.  I'm sure John is a quick study. "He pulls his arm out of his brother's grip and skips over to John's side .
And yes...the liquid was blood ....lovely. .At least he didn't have to cut himself or sacrifice a virgin.
"Sherlock.." He whispered. John's finger slipped and his gun fired hitting the bald man  right between his eyes. His brain matter flew all over the floor and wall behind him ,some even got on his blond buddy holding Sherlock by the hair.
"I know this grate café with sweet tea and biscuits. "He took John's arm again shuffling the bags around so he could hold the older man's elbow.
Sam looks over at Dean the brothers are use to life treating hunts but they don't know about their campions. " Well ?" Dean ask clearly meaning
Sherlock spun around  now facing John tears were falling down his cheeks mixing with blood . He went to say something.
John lets out a soft affectionate chuckle.  "That don't make you a man . Or any less need of rest . Off to bed with you. "
“ Should I tell him about the semen marks on your mouth . Or maybe I should tell him what I see on your fingers and in the wrinkles of you clothing.” Sherlock was not to surprised to hear about John's Bisexuality, he had more pressing matters to worry about... A woman cheating on John. She must be as foolish as she is rude. Imagine, someone like her calling him stupid, that's just comical, he took a step closer to John. He didn't like the look on the shorter man's face .
He crossed his legs and straightened his back . John pulled  the door open ,slid in across from Sherlock then slammed the door shut.
Sam clears his throat and  fills in for his brothers stunned silence." Cas this is John Watson he's the reason we called."  The angle didn't say anything just  stared at him. John started to feel uncomfortable.  He rubbed his arm ,shifted his weight foot to foot, then stepped back and held out his hand " I really am sorry about that.  My name is John. Thank you for coming to help ."
"Morning Sherlock "The sliver blonde man greeted him cheerfully  with a  broad smile on his face. John's heart swam as he took in the sight of  a soft sleep rumbled younger version Sherlock flop dramatically on the sofa. Some things never change.
Sherlock eyes traced the shape of John's  hard length then looked over the doctor's face for reassurance. ..pupils blown wide ,his body was flush from  face to his chest,  pulse elevated.  It was obvious he wanted this....
He bit his lip . He had so many questions ,but all he wanted to know is: How the hell does he get back home !?? John must have been lost in thought for a while because Sherlock was setting in front of him with an empty plate and an equally empty cup of tea.
After that embarrassing display John grabbed the first pair of clean clothing out of his bag and ran to the large communal bathrooms  to clean himself up.
He tilted his head making his curls fall across his forehead and pouted out his bottom lip making it impossibly fuller and  snapped the shot.
" Stay here ." John said stiffly. He got out and quickly shut the door behind him. The soldier straighten his shoulders his posture streaming authority. It made Sherlock's knees go weak. Even next to the to Winchester's John had an air about him, he could handle his own. Sherlock licks his lips, honestly hoping for a fight. Watching three gorgeous men box it out in the heat would make it worth it. He sat up in his seat getting ready for what he hopes to be good show. Maybe Sam and John's shirt could be ripped off;  Sherlock  smiles at the thought .
getting the dog tags ." He put them back on the shelf so the lady at the desk can put them back. " I have my own. "
Sherlock crossed his arms and fought to keep his face set in stone so the blush he felt creeping up would not show on his cheeks.
The man's eyes widened. He went to move but stopped like something was holding him in place. He glared down at the strange star John had painted on the floor then looked back at the necklace.
Sherlock looked up at John though shaggy black curls ,bright curious eyes met his. " Sixteen" he replied.    "Thank you for that...."Sherlock nodded to the bodies lying on the ground. " But I would really like to go now . If all possible...Can you take me home ? "
He saved Sherlock Holmes and now he's a normal ,hormonal , homosexual,  sixteen year old ,sassy soon to be detective . He smiles and holds back the pain he feels for the other Sherlock and the fondness he feels for this one . He leans over and kisses a very confused  Sherlock's cheek.
is growing on Mycroft's pillow. His brother deserves a good case a pneumonia.  He wipes his towel across his face to hide the smile dancing at his lips.  He walks   over to the other side of the dance studio to grab his bag . He needed to change before he left . He couldn't just walk into the lab in a  blue leotard. He bent half way  down reaching for his bag when something caught his eye. He glanced up and his inside froze over .
He licks his lips and pulls off his sleep trousers. Leaving just his tight red pants on. He adjusted himself slightly and took a rather flattering picture  of the nice bulge in his pants. He wasn't hard yet but still...he was impressive either way.....Another thing to be proud of- he  sent it with.
But dreaming something like that was... to much even for him.  He's in his mid thirties.  He don't need to be having fantasies like that about his best friend.
He is not going to give up on this so easy. He's not that type of man . John shot up to his feet straightened his back. His blue eyes growing dark. He strides over to Mycroft and grabs his posh suit collar .
Talking about selling souls like he's  some demon . There is no way he would agree to something like that . Yeah he wanted to go home -but for all he knows and after all he been though - this guy could be the devil or something ."How about no- Do you know where I can find an angle? I rather deal with them then a demon."
Sherlock walks up behind John and places his hand on the taller man's shoulder and pressed in close "What are you two talking about . 2017 is ten years away."
The chant begin...it sounded darker coming from the low rumble of a Russian accent then Mycroft's polished posh voice but the word sounded the same...
"We can't guarantee we can get you home . But this sounds like our kind of gig. See ya then. " the dial tone echoed in John's ears.
" It's nice to meet you "The blond girl gushes "John been keeping you for himself.... "she pouts and playfully smacks John's arm " Now I see why. You are just as handsome as he says ..." she gives Sherlock's an appraising once over " Gorgeous . "
Sherlock moved his hands away from his chin and blinked. Instantly he regretted leaving his thoughts. The building they were currently parked in front of is worse than the other place the Winchesters tried to get them to say at the night before.
A shiver ran down the younger man’s spin . Lighting bolts invading his senses, his cock pulsed in his pajama. "J..John" he murmured up to the older man. Their eyes met and they stared at each other for a long moment. Just looking at one another . Deep  blue eyes falling into crystal silver gray-  breathing each other in....  Was this really happening?
" Sherlock , Elizabeth  in the car now !" Dean shouted . John stood in front of  Sherlock as the onslaught of demons came . He reached behind Sherlock , opens the door  to the impala with his right hand and held the gun with his dominant left . He never takes his eyes off the demon onslaught  . Shot after accurate shot. He watched them fall .
No way he should just die now . There was no way he can explain this ..... He changes back into his pajamas . Meekly he walks into the sitting room ...The music long since stopped. ..and Sherlock stood there ..staring at his phone...
He could smell Johns alcohol induced arousal ...it was nothing new.... he always smelled that way after a few...only this time it was stronger.....after he said those words....it grew and builded around Sherlock....He couldn't breath.....that arousal became something more the moment john placed his hands on Sherlock's legs and pecked his lips with a chasit kiss..
" The pendent is shard from a core of something called a TARDIS. To activate it you must read the incantation than feed the pendent with a life force. In this particular pendants case ,an angles grace is used as the power source."
Sam pulled the bag off his back and held out the chains they bought at Digglers. “ Let's get started."
He tentatively raised his hand to the side of John's face and ran a cold finger down John's throat following the path of the water droplet.
" Wait until their guard is down, get him alone.  Then we  can get him " Crowley said before he disappeared leaving the demon alone in the hotel.
Henry was surprised by that statement, until he felt something wet slide on his cheek. Quickly he wiped the moisture from his face. " This ?" He said with a laugh . He tried to come up with a reason. How could he explain that dream to his son. "I was just -"  he scrambled for words.
Dean pulled him again and pointed to something ahead of them. Bodies. Demons littered of the ground of the moon lit graveyard..
John just shrugged shucked  the blade toward the ground to flick off the blood. " I was an army doctor. " he said as he  climbed in beside  Sherlock .
Sherlock was typing on his phone when he let out an unhappy grumble his face twisted into confusion . "  It won't be easy to get that stone... " Dean looked back at Sherlock though the rearview mirror. " What ya find out kid ?"
John took that and returned the hungry kiss . Tongues slid against each other , wet ,smooth muscle the mixture of flavors sweet tea, mint ,with a hint of brandy from earlier...it was perfect..
John felt all the tension leave his shoulders when he looked down into those familiar eyes...All the overwhelming fear, anger , adrenaline and fight  drained out of him .  His shoulders relaxed ."Alright."
They all think he's been clean and he has been. He told himself he would only touch this stash if it were an emergency.. Well today happen to be one .He was antsy his mind was like a train about to meet a mountain side....
Saliently he creeps over to the table clears a spot to sit amongst the science equipment. If this doesn't win the game then nothing will.
John moved slowly waving his gun at the other men. "Get away from him.  Move over there where I can see you !"   One of the men tried to make a move and John shoots out his leg.
John never heard Sherlock stutter. " Marriage?!" Sherlock fumbles away from John and covers his bright red face. "M...men can't get married." John leans forward and whispers like he hiding a big secret . " Not yet … but in 2014 the act of same sex marriage will be written up." John sat back and smiles to himself  as Mycroft's words from their first meeting swirl around in his head .
John reread the list in his head and voices the question floating around in every ones head. "What is a  weeping angel  ? "
John rubbed the back of his head " Would this Cas guy be able to help out any...?" Dean nodded and Sam tossed the necklace back to John
John wanted to gag but he politely wiped his mouth. It was no worse then some of the food he had in the army ." That's fine thank you.  " he set the burger down.
He waited...no reply - Oh well he quickly sent the picture knowing her game . She always played hard to get but once he  gives her what she wants- she is  putty in his hands.
Sherlock made his way to the bedroom, as he passed the bathroom he heard the shower running and stopped, he debated for a few seconds on whether or not to enter,Just to tease the doctor...but even even knew that was a bit not good'
" You are not going to pass out in me are you? Your face is red. " Sherlock slid in next to him and shut the heavy door . Slowly the boy crawled over the long seat; his long legs bent at the knee his shoulder blades pointing as he approaches like a mountain lion  ,slow and steady before the attack.
Sherlock rolls his eyes “ No way I'm calling that fatty.  I will get my own plane home." A silence fell over the car .
He got up and turned around to start cleaning up when he heard a gravelly male voice greet him from behind with a soft -
He straightened his back and held the man's gaze .How could someone's eyes change color like that ?If he hadn't seen it for himself he wouldn't have believed it . After all he's been though he shouldn't be surprised. He put his arms to his side and put his feet together . ."Khoung told me to give you a call. "He said with an even straightforward voice "He said you could help me with my problem."
"How about you lay back yeah?"John said pushing the boy back to lay on the sofa. Once he was sure Sherlock was somewhat comfortable he placed the frozen peas on his ankles and used the shredded pant legs to hold them there .
He let out a yelp -jumped up and fell back tripping on the plush rolling chair. " BLOODY HELL! " John shouted in  utter surprise getting his balance back quickly he rears back and slams a fist into the angel's face.
Dean laughed from the other side of the table " Sorry we couldn't get anything better than Mickey D's.  It's the closest thing around. "
“ How are we going to get the grace from a statue?” Dean huffed as he and Sam bend down to collect the items from Sam's bag . They started sorting through the supplies.
Oh crap the divas meet ...I had so much -to much fun with this. Johns girlfriend is a bit of a well you will see...
“He's right Leeanna you better go.” John said not looking at her. His hands are  at his side shaking.
His curiosity was about to get the best of him when he spotted John headed toward the car. His shoulders were tight  and his brow is frowned and he's  steadily clenching his fist at his sides; something Sherlock discovered John  did when he was trying  control his temper. Quickly Sherlock ruffled his curls and straightened  his tight blue shirt.
Something inside clicks . That explains it ... The rape... it made Sherlock frightened of men and sex maybe even sentiment  and love . He didn't want to be hurt or reminded of that night so he  didn't let anyone in emotionally or physically . He stayed celibate and keep people from getting too close . That's why everyone calls him 'the virgin ' because they don't know he was just a …frightened and hurt little boy.
He don't understand, even when  he tries to hide those  parts of himself  it still happens over and over.  Everyone he has ever met they are all the same.
She let out a giggle " I know, I know I should have told you, but Johnny I know you would have said no . This was the best way. "she wandered over into the main room over to Sherlock . "So this is him hua? "
" I'm sorry. " he whispered guilt filling his belly. He was lying to his son. He was happy to finally find out what happened to his wife after so many years. He felt a weight lifted off of him the moment he found out he  became content, happy even. He found his wife ,stopped a maniac Immortal from exposing him or harming what was left of his family. He thought finally he could move on maybe even find happiness.
Crowley watched but only the short blond man was all he was seeing . John Watson stool tall and proud back straight, arms at his sides. Ever the soldier ,Crowley felt himself smile. It won't be long now. He made eye contact with a few of the demons hiding waiting for his signal. He watched as the group spoke.
He is standing on a balcony surrounding a large circular room containing a ham radio, telegraph, and switchboard. There is also a chess board. Leading off of  this room is a large library, full of books, weapons, and an extensive card file. At the far end is a large telescope and glowing marking painted on the walls. Men ,woman ,and young adults  alike are scattered about in black suits . John suddenly realized how naked he is  and pulled his arms closer to himself .
Only in vain….Pitt stopped coughing ….stopped breathing .Wilberforce had to leave he needed to find a quiet place to sob out his grief , away from prying eyes…
Sherlock looks up and down John's bare chest and smiles " I don't thank they will have a problem with you walking in like that.  "
They are off to get the the items on the list Elizabeth gave them. And end up at as sex store called Digglers.
He sits up and pulled off his night shirt  and turns his  light back on. He held up his camera and took took picture of his chest from the neck down showing off his broad chest tight muscles and that soft little V where his pants meet his hips.
He took a deep shuddering breath . His palms were sweating and his hands were shaking. He knew that warehouse.... It was the first drug den he found Sherlock in years ago. He sighed heavily again. This was never going to happen. ... He was going to put a stop to this . He needed to save his brother. It was in the past yes, but that would not stop him.
He sighed closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Brother if you plan on having intercourse with someone please don't butt dial me." he drawled evenly.
After hours of convincing Jo that the man they were after , was his stalker and that was the  reason why she found the picture at the crime scene . Henry's stalker  took that picture as a plan to frame him again. It took three hours of explaining a made-up story about him and  the woman in the picture , finally with  Abe’s help she bought it. The story was of his late wife. Who had killed herself ( not for the reason Jo had in mind) - and the child she was carrying ( Even if that child stood beside her as a old man) .  It didn't take much after telling her that - She bought into the story with tears in her eyes. She didn't hug him when she left, only gave him a look of sorrow, like she was seeing him in a new light .
John tried to speak. He cleared his throat and cleared it again. Shock took over.  There was no way anyone could have faked this. What could John possibility do to help with that. Going by the date it happened nearly ten years ago.
To his and Castiel's surprise  the angle staggered back from impact  of short man's fist. A heavy silence fell over the room for a split second before John recovered and started to apologize.
going there...two sets of Cupid bow lips where to much. John shivers  at the image , he jumped at the sound of Sherlock voice .
Sherlock's eyes snapped open just in time to see the demons' corps fall to the ground.  He blinked , the other demon fell. Suddenly Demons start running from the shadows-
Soon, but not soon enough Dean comes out smiling holding the key. " Come on guys let's get our things -" Dean pulls Sam by the arm and bumps John's shoulder and nodded for him to follow. To Sherlock's surprise the men keep talking even after they walked away down the small sidewalk to the  room and continued even as Dean opened the door . They  continued to chat  in a friendly manner like they were family  and continued  up until Dean shut the door .
John moved a stack of books and slid some papers over trying to keep the grimy little drips of his burger from spreading all  over something important.  John pulled out the stale brown napkins and laid them out on the table . He  examined the flat  thin  meat patty and took a hesitant bite . A strong overpowering taste of pickles swamped over his tongue , sauce dripped down his chin , quickly he leaned forward and caught the white-red drip of juice on the brow paper towel he found in the bag.
To Sherlock's disappointment one of the seven men smile his white teeth a striking contrast to his shoe leather colored skin. The crispy looking man started to speak. Sherlock couldn't quite understand him . Curious  he got out of the car and stood behind John taking a long glance at his arse in those army fatigues.
" Woah! Woah! There buddy! Who are you ?" He said stepping in front of the man . Lucas  puts his hand on the strangers chest just so he would stop pushing through the lab. The man glared down at him like he just now noticed that Lucas was there and it was somehow it  was Lucas's fault that he was in the way. " Where is the body ?" The man growled .
I think you should hold on to this  " Sam handed John the vile filled the swirling sparkling grace.   Johns face lit up " I hope this works. "
That would  work … He wanted to scoff at the thought. It's bittersweet now-  with the knowledge of two centuries of being a doctor- He looks back and sees how easy it would have been to save Pits life .
part of  their relationship yet. Sherlock grinned he might just have to help his older self out. Sherlock  might not have a lot of time but  he can figure something out. A new plan was forming in the young man's mind.
"He might be after this necklace… " John said as he fingered at the pendant.  " He mentioned he wanted it - though he insisted I bid  my soul and in return he would send me home. "
John knew this feeling, what he was seeing isn't real, he knew that.  But, he couldn't pull himself back. He was watching  children die again and again. Their screams of agony yelling for their doctor.  John was shaking, not scared just angry. The screams echoed around the gun fire .. John... John!! Help...! JOHN!!!
Sherlock had a plan: Act like he fell asleep and put his head on the doctor's shoulder. Only problem is, that the doctor keep staring at him. It made it a little more complicated than previously planned. Originally Sherlock was going to wait an hour nod off then fall over. It's been two hours now....and the doctor couldn't seem to keep his eyes off him.
“Leeanna, Sherlock don't lie, he can read anyone as soon as he meets them.It's just what he does . He may be an insufferable prick but he don't lie...Wouldn't lie . Not about this” John said, the hurt clear on his face. “Is it true? Have you ever been honest with me?" His face with struck with hurt.
Sherlock groaned in protest , muttered  a few choice words , got up glaring daggers at the floor like it was the culprit of making time go by to quickly .
"What now ?"he grumbled as  reached through the shower curtain  grabbed his towel , drying his hands then grabbing his mobile unlocking it .
...he looked down at his mobile, the picture of John half naked surround by his experiments supplies this could have been an accident but ....what if.....
" Let's go up top  Pop's I'll make tea" Abe said with a pat on Henry shoulder. After Abe vanished to the top floor Henry slouched forward and laid his face in his hands. With another long sigh he took that moment to calm himself and warm his center .
Could these two be demons.?  John shook that thought off  . It didn't matter as long as they could get him home without bargaining for his soul.  They could be aliens for all he cared , as long as they can help him get home.  He  helped Dean with their bag " Come on Sherlock we got work to do" John said almost cheerfully.
He looked at the picture.  It wasn't anything like John had sent him, but there was no mistaking the it was an attractive picture
" Oh god." John feels his voice crack with a  hysterical laugh threatening  to burst though.  He closes his mouth before it escapes  .
“ You two want me to call Cas or do you wanna rest first? “ Dean asked as he got out of the car. He smiles when he spotted John holding a sleeping Sherlock in his arms. “ We better rest first… “
"John - do not use my experiments and equipment as a background for your provocative photos .... Use the sofa or even the skull. "He huffed and flopped down on his chair flipped himself over so his feet where on the back and his curls brushed the floor.
The doctor looked down at the boy in his arms.Sherlock looked genuinely frightened of him.So John slowly put him down. "Sherlock you know I don't work for him. I told you that . He asked me to come get you....Because he found that tape in your room"
John was just in the middle of lathering up his body with his favorite soap when his phone pinged....the hot water was helping subside his buzz..the steam rolled into the bathroom's fogging up every glass surface.
"I love you to Sherlock Holmes. " He murmured between chuckles. Eyes glued on the best thing to ever happen in his life .
Sherlock looked down at his feet . "Yeah...I'll try  ."It wasn't a lie he. Was going to find a more reliable dealer.
Dean smiles " Oh us , we are from Minnesota. " the lie came out  smoothly . " but my friends here are from England.  "
John was about to hang up right then and there but he stopped hearing the strain in the other man's voice.
The man was about to open his mouth when the hotel's room slammed open and a strange object like a grenade got tossed in. A bright light filled the room, right before the light became to much John seen a red smoke erupting from the man's mouth.
"Your boy in there to ?" a  woman next to him asked as he sat. John didn't take his eyes off of Sherlock's movements . "Ah...yeah he's in there. "
Sherlock looked back at him his face unreadable.  " Thanks..."The word came out as soft breath.  "I hope we meet again soon.. I won't mind having a doctor around it could be helpful. "He holds out his hand "It was nice meeting you Doctor John Watson.
Sherlock was frozen to his spot in the living room. His mind trying to process what John just said.' Of course I love... Sherlock?".. 'he wouldn't cheat one me?'.. Love me.?.. What could this mean?
Sucking in a harsh  breath like he just come from underwater.  Sherlock forced his body to move rip his eyes from the sight in front of him . He can't be caught  watching .
Soon they were on the road the impala rumbling beautifully under them  as miles stretched on and on under her tires.
Sherlock grabbed his hand and pulled himself up. His legs wobbled under him. He adjusted his pants and pulled John's jacket closer to his bare body. "Wonderful where is the fatty -". Sherlock doesn't want his bother to see him like this. Bad enough he knows about this mess..
Sherlock on the screen lets out soft pleas and cries for the men around him to stop, but the mockery continued . His brothers painful cries echoed out the speakers neverending . The men around him shouted at him and slapped  his bother till his skin was red. They - fucked him , hurt him,
John's heart raised. If he could find an angle it could read the writing on the necklaces give John some of this ' Grace' stuff then they could send him home? Angles are the good guys right? So he had to help. " Where can I find him?"
John and Sherlock's eyes never left each other.....John moved his hand away from Sherlock's wrist and brushed it through Sherlock's inky curls. " Sh...Sherlock?"
I have a whole new respect for people who write this kind of stuff,  It is fun and challenging I hope I don't make it to cheesecakey
The boy pointed to a small kitchen . John got up and  rummaged through the icebox surprised he didn't find any lingering body parts;  just frozen food and a few things of meat . He took out two bags of peas and wrapped them in flannels  he found on the sink.
It made his heart stutter and his gut float like a million butterflies fluttered around  inside him. Johns deep blue eyes were hypnotic....
Sherlock rolled his eyes. " Then take them with you I'm sure my future self will appreciate the change in style"
"I guess you two are looking for us?" John said nodding to the sign the shorter of the two of the rather tall men is holding.
John thought.   Ballet ...Sherlock does  ballet . The Doctor shakes himself out of his hypnosis and finds a seat next to the few other individuals watching the students.
He misses London...the cool air ,the cloudy sky...The smell of gunpowder, leather and tea... The soft scent of Sherlock's expensive shampoo when he gets out of the shower. The sound of him playing soft melodies as John tries to find sleep and Sherlock knows he's plagued with nightmares. He misses his adrenaline fueled chases over rooftops. He misses the smell of Mrs. Hudson's cakes and scones. The sound of the London rain patterning on the windows..... John wipes his forehead the slick lingering sweat made him cringe . Hopefully not to long now .
His fingers barely  touched  around the girth, slowly the detective ran his hand up the shift then back down.
John's heart stops .... Then a mischievous smile crosses his face . This won't be easy with Sherlock in the flat -but if the detective happens to be in his mind palace -well he's going to win .
Henry snapped his gaze away from the too familiar silver- gray - green eyes and pulls his hands out of the body.
They stayed like that rutting against each other John cock slipped between Sherlock's thighs. Throbbing with each thrust.  John pushed past Sherlock's balls up under his cock . He keep a steady rhythm on Sherlock cock, soon they were lost in each other ...nothing but the sounds their voices , their pleasure and the slapping of skin could be heard.
Sherlock staggered back and dropped his bag to cradle his throbbing gut...he sucked in a harsh breath.
“Why should John tell me anything when you haven't even answered his first question!!.” Sherlock challenged “It is best you go ”
Dean was sitting in the large open room at a wooden table. It was covered in stacks of books and papers that looked like they belonged in a museum.    He had a  beer in one hand and a burger in the other. The tall rugged handsome stranger looked up when he heard John's footsteps . "Hay man. We been doing a bit of research since you called. We found a few things. " he patted the seat next to him and pushed a greasy McDonald's bag toward him. " Take a seat , eat , then we can get started.  "
John leaned in close to Sherlock's face ,the detective could smell the brandy on his breath, he looked down into John's eyes. He could make out the gold flecks around his iris. John's hand was still on Sherlock's leg . He was trembling.
John looked down at Sherlock. ..flushed like a virgin, panting with need...Something he had seen in his dreams ...but this ...was unbelievable… the man under him put Apollo to shame.
John's heart pinches Sherlock  never says ‘Please.’ He stands at attention spins around and walks out. “ Come on “ he snapped at the two dumbfounded Americans still standing looking to the Henry , who nods and gestures to the door .
John looks down between his legs spotting the massive erection gracing his presence.  Just as quickly as he woke up his eyes darted around the bunkers small room looking for any signs of Sherlock.  Oh god...if he seen the way John just woke up.   There was no way Sherlock would  not have deduce his dream.
" That is  what I said john , you know I hate repeating myself . " Sherlock sat up his eyebrows raising  to his hairline at the sight of John in nothing but his cotton towel...he licked his lips taking the other man in- His  eyes caught a single drop of water  dripping from John,s short blond hair down his ear it pulls down his strong neck right down the pulse point ....then drizzled down his honey over the bare honey bronze skin. His ice gray blue eyes followed the gleaming drop disappear into the sharp dip of his collarbone… He wanted to lick it off.... Sitting up he scuffled over to John on his knees his feet tangling  in the sheets slightly as he made his way to the end of his bed.
John awoke to the sound of  baritone and gravely laughter mixing like  an odd sort of melody... Okay so maybe it wasn't laughter it was more like snickering . Feeling the ever so gentle press of fingers on his back.  John groans and flipped over. "S'lock?"
Sherlock was sitting in the back of the car bouncing his leg . Mycroft told him ,quite forcefully to stay in the car. Normally Sherlock would protest and follow him up to John's room anyway but his ankles are still  hurting when he walks . So he sits waiting; scrolling  through his phone when something caught his attention.  It happened for only a half a second, like light reflecting off of a window.  Blinding for a moment then gone.
The door opens “ Times up Sherlock you better not have harassed the man" Came John's voice . Henry and Sherlock pulled away from each like they touched something hot.
And there  is mentions of  suicide at the end of the chapter just to give you a heads up since its not in the tags -
“ You always looked up to your uncle. But to take his name ?  Tisk tisk .” Sherlock said with a smile .
Sherlock  snarls. " Good luck you bastards John will be here any moment, and he will rip you apart just like he did your friends back there !"
Please bare with me guys~ and thank you guys for the vote of  confidence you been giving me ! I am so thankful for your kind comments!
John stares at him bug-eyed. What the hell is going on in side that  funny huge brain of his? "No you don't get what I'm saying we are not a couple . You don't do relationships. Your body is just transport . You said so yourself."
Henry was about to say something when Lucas started sneering . “ Now wait a second listen here you can just barge in here and start demanding -”
Sherlock shivered and let out soft baritone whimpers that sent a sweet shot of titillation down John's  spine. Slowly he pulled the garment over Sherlock's head no words were spoken and the kiss only broken when the fabric slid over Sherlock's head .
“Oh.”  Pitt ducked his head if his face was not red from the fever  Wilberforce would have seen the blush creeping up his neck. It has been so long since he has used his nickname ...it sounded like bells in Pitt’s ears.
The white door to their left opens and a short ,well-built girl with cropped spiky  blond hair and long purple bangs falling over her eye comes out. She had some anime on her black T-shirt and striped white shorts that came up a bit to high on her long tan legs .  She looked up through her purple bangs  thick black lashes make  her blue eyes bright.
In the shadow of the lamp, John could see that Sherlock’s mouth was parted a little. His mouth was even fuller like this, its generous heart shape emphasised through the dim lighting in the room.His eyes were half lidded pupils blown .... he looked....hungry
"We?" Mycroft arched an eyebrow . Ah...he means Sherlock. He smiled - this John Watson is a wrecking ball of a man whom stunned a  vampire and sent a shiver of fear though the British government . He is impressed . Mycroft  walked back to the car umbrella twisting  in his  chubby fingers. No wonder why he chose this  John Watson to protect his brother.   He would bet this man  keeps his future brother in line..... Oh, how he likes this Doctor Watson . If he can't get him  home Mycroft might just hire him to look after his brother for good.
"J..John this is a bit.-" Sherlocks body was on fire again. That overwhelming feeling to claim and be claimed...to worship boiled down to his stomach.
Also if you want to give me a few pointers on how I can make my smut skills better that would be greatly appreciated!
John held back a smile. If he stayed too long he might end up doing something he might regret. This Sherlock is  so open . John would put money on it that the boy don't even realize what he just said "Alright you have a point."
Once he got to his room there was a rather large box in front of his door marked in scratchy  hand writing .
Sherlock found himself leaning into the warm gentle touch of this stranger.  He didn't trust his voice so he just leaned over and pressed him self against the doctors side....He was safe now....
" Wait ? Where are we ?" John asked his hand instinctively  reaching for the gun tucked away in his belt. Sam and Dean both got out of the car and closed the doors at the exact same time.
John tosses the necklaces up and down in his hand . He pins Sherlock with a stare . " Your full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes . You are the world's only consulting detective, a profession you  created for yourself. You have a keen interest in unusual or bizarre crimes, without which you  rapidly becomes bored, relying on nicotine to keep your brain active, although in the past , well present in this case you dabbled in illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine  for entertainment.
Johns eyes widened , his  heart hammered inside his chest . Home? He was going to be able to go home ? So soon ? He could finally forget about this nightmare .? Well maybe not forget about young Sherlock.  The rest can be forgotten. A smile breaks across his face . He felt like he could hug Mycroft, though that would be petrifying.  He huffed out a soft laugh "s..so you're telling me when senior psychopath translates that necklace.  I'm going home ?”
John began moving his hips, thrusting forward keeping their hands steady,  soft sounds escaped though his lips as he rocked into the circle of their fingers.
Sherlock was looking at a few army clad khaki cargo pants when John came up behind him . The boy just smiled and pushes a pair of cargos right into his arms "These will look great with that . "He said pointing to the green T Shirt John randomly slipped on.
Sam looked down at Sherlock as John and Dean started talking about the car . Dean pulled the hood up and to show off the insides to the Doctor.  Sam sighed. " He just became my brother's best friend.  "
Once he was finished he went out to the main room . When he entered he heard the two brothers arguing.
Sherlock grabbed his shirt from his bag and held it close to his chest . He could feel the blood fluid  to his cheeks. "What are you doing here John !? I told you I would be home in a few hours."
no I'm going to let you enjoy this.... "Slowly John reached around and griped Sherlock's throbbing almost forgotten cock. They’re pressed together Sherlock's back and John's chest  pressing bare skin on bare skin …  thighs pressed together. Sherlock could feel John's erection pressing into his arse cheeks.
He so seems so plain under his fluffy jumpers ,neat hair and kind blue eyes. Mycroft could see there was something more to that man. The moment John  showed him the necklace, to the moment he looked at his brother he could tell  John was more then just a doctor or an army man. This man possessed something Mycroft  him self wished he had.Something he's glad John has because this man...this terrifying, kind , passionate, heart filled man- is the man his brother chose to spend his life with. Mycroft smiled to himself.
John sighed, relief flooding over his tense muscles he didn't relax but the tension in his shoulders lighted up.
Some how though he knows it's real that it has  happened  that he as been here before... but where is here ?
Second  : Set up a romantic vibe with  sexy music....with roses on the floor. That's what they do right ? He needs more research. …
John watched, cataloging every movement Sherlock made with his tongue.  Quick flicks at the glands under the head ,long laps up from the base of his cock to the tip....
After they left the store. Sherlock dragged him in and out of stores of all kinds . Somehow he ended up with more clothing than he had back home.
