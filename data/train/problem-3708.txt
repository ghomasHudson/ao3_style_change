" in case he wiped the smile off Castiel's face.
"Do you want me to switch it off?" he asked quietly.
"Wasn't there a reason we came here?" Castiel asked, almost as if he could read Dean's mind.
Before retrieving Castiel's bag from where he'd left it, Dean hurried to swap his uncomfortably wet jeans into a drier pair.  When he picked up the tattered bag a small part of him was tempted to look inside; to see what few items Castiel possessed, but he knew that would be a breach of the trust Castiel had placed in him.
Castiel contemplated this for a moment. "Blind?" he asked.
He knew the answer to that, of course - his name had already come up in conversation.  It had been a year, however, and shouldn't
"Hey, Cas?" he asked, his whisper seeming loud to his ears.
Playfulness brightening Castiel's face, he scooped some onto a stick of celery and held it in front of Dean.
Castiel's eyes darkened at the thought of getting Dean
"Excuse me," he said, squeezing past a couple of teenage girls as he spotted the section for friends.
"What?" Bobby grumbled when he noticed Cas staring at him.
"I don't know what happened there because you never told me, and I'm not going to pry into what's not my business, but do you even know this guy?"
Dean groaned as his hips jerked involuntarily.
"I can do that," he said, more confidently than he felt.
thinks I am?"
"No."
"Team Milton," Cas piped up.
about them, though.
"Thanks," Dean said, turning to leave.
That wasn't what he was trying to say at all but Dean, ever the coward when it came to talking about his emotions, didn't correct him.
"Fine."
He looked at what Ben was holding.  "Do you think you could perhaps find something... with more fabric?" he settled for.
"That's quite alright, Ben."
On the other end of the phone Sam sighed.  "How much do you need?"
"I want... something
"Well, you know I don't really believe in the man upstairs, but thanks," Dean told him.  He pressed a chaste kiss to Castiel's mouth, then dropped his forehead against his.  "This is all because of you," he said.  "Thank you, Cas."
"Make some for me, would you?" Alastair groaned ten minutes later, grabbing Cas's glass of apple juice and draining it in three gulps.
"You can't stop me from pressing charges!" the man insisted.
"Admittedly.  Though they
"No," Dean said softly, running his fingers up and down Castiel's arm.  "I just didn't peg you for the cuddly type."
"It's good to see him looking happy," Father Reynolds confided in Dean as they returned to their duties.
"I'm gonna go to bed."
"Then I'll be honest, it probably won't be very productive," she said, but as Dean moved to stand she added, "However, this hour's free.  So why not stick it out?  You're here anyway, after all.  How
Dean turned to Cas helplessly as the doctor walked away, then looked down as if only just realising that Cas was holding his hand.
"Really?  You're going to tell me 'I told you so' after our first fight?"
"Excuse Ash's bad decorating," she said as they slid into their seats.  "You can tell who
Shaking his head, he took the shaving gel and massaged it into his face and neck before giving himself the quickest shave he could. He looked much younger without the beard that had been building up since the last time he'd been able to shave, but it didn't make him look any less tired. He instinctively reached for the deodorant that sat out and it wasn't until he sprayed it and he thought it smelled different that he realised it was Dean's; his was still in his back in the living room, with his clean clothes.
"Do you know her?"
"Cas, do you want to make a start on that?"
Dean sighed.  "Probably not.  But then, I guess that's why I'm dragging my sorry ass to Pamela's."
"Has Balthazar told you I'm no good for you recently?"
having sex.
"What?"  Balthazar couldn't be serious.  Could he?
"Where are we?"
Unbuckling his seatbelt as he saw Balthazar walking along the pavement, he gave Dean a quick hug before stepping out of the car.  Giving his approaching friend a quick wave of acknowledgement, he turned back to Dean before shutting the car door.
"Look, uh, I haven't had breakfast yet and I'm starving," Dean told Sam as he reached his front door.
Chuck as well when they got home.  "Yeah, we'll take the bill now, thanks."
Dean looked a little relieved, and squeezed Castiel's hand.  "Good.  'Cause we could have had cake if you wanted."
"Unfortunately, I am very under-qualified for most of these."
"Dean?" Cas asked breathlessly, concerned.  "Are you alright?  Dean?"
"Because we live in a world that is full of intolerance and hatred," Balthazar said bitterly.
Castiel looked up at him, blue eyes raking across his face trying to determine what it was Dean wasn't telling him.  With a sigh, Dean switched the TV off and tossed the remote back on the table.  He sat there silently, chewing on his bottom lip and when he glanced up at the photo by the TV he was aware of Castiel looking rather guilty out of the corner of his eye.
, but..."
Bobby waved a hand to silence him as he drank up.  "Keep 'em coming."
Dean had been doing his best to avoid his apartment all week, however subconsciously, but sitting in it on Saturday slowly began to drive him mad.  There was a half-eaten microwave burger on the table in front of him, and he couldn't remember if it was left over from Thursday or Friday.  Either way he was pretty sure he hadn't eaten anything all day, but the latest in a long line of whiskey bottles he was cradling between his legs was causing the days to blur into one another.  He hadn't shaved in a few days, either, so his usual stubble had almost become a thin beard.
* * *
Cas chuckled.  Ben was sticking his tongue out as far as he could, imitating the giraffes in the background.  He copied it into a folder named 'FOR LISA' and continued clicking through them.  He added some good shots of the animals, along with short video clips of them high-fiving the monkeys and the penguin parade.  One of Ben feeding an exotic bird, several more perched expectantly on his arms and shoulders, made them laugh so hard they got a harsh
"Ready?"
"I'm fine to keep playing, if you are.  But...  I

"Dean, my life has always been dedicated to serving God and helping those less fortunate than I—"
Dean just laughed softly. "You know what? I really fancy some chips. You can't come to the beach and
* * *
Dean scowled.
There was a large black bag in the middle of the room that he'd been throwing crap into for the past twenty minutes.  It had stopped raining so, unless it started again, he wouldn't have to pick Cas up.  Cas liked walking home after his sessions with Pamela, because it gave him time to 'process' as he put it.  Dean gathered more food wrappers from down the side of the chair and tossed them in the bag.  It was a wonder the chair didn't rustle when he sat in it, the amount he'd shoved down the side.  It was a terrible habit he'd gotten into as he sat, watching the TV, and stuffed his face.  A part of him wondered what the hell Cas had to
to take His name in vain."
Guiltily Dean jerked upright, so quickly he hit his head off the hood.  "I—  Agh!" he exclaimed, rubbing his head as he grimaced.  "What?"
"Sam?"
that I need," Cas stated firmly.  "Do you like this?" he asked, mouthing at Dean's cock again.
Beside him, Cas stirred.  "You okay?" he asked, his voice rough with sleep.
"Where's Jess?" Dean asked, looking around.  "I'm sure she'd get a kick out of the time you got dressed up as Batman and you jumped off the shed because you thought you could fly."
"Cas-cheel Novak?"
Dean just grinned, because he knew Bobby was only pulling his leg.  Bobby disliked Gordon as much as Dean did, and knew just how short Dean's temper could be.  He was lucky he hadn't gotten to take a proper swing at Gordon, so Bobby could just let it go.  He and Cas looked at each other in silence for a moment.
Dean chewed on his lip.  "It's gonna be expensive."
It might have been childish, but he refused to acknowledge Dean as they drove to the store; instead studying the list like he'd never seen it before when in fact he'd written it the night before.  They would have to budget this trip carefully.  Thanksgiving dinner would be expensive
"Woah, back up - Dean doesn't have a girlfriend."
"It was okay.  I got a free juice from the flight attendant."
Scowling, she threw her cloth at him.
"Sure thing."
"How are you?" Castiel asked, feeling his way into the room.
"I'm starving!" Ben declared.
"Debt."
"And now that he's
"You know me," he grinned, tucking the menu into the stand and sitting back.  "I'll have a cheeseburger, extra cheese, and fries.  Oh, and if you do any of that side-salad crap, I don't want it."
Dean dried his hands and took one of Cas's in his.  "I promise," he said, looking into Cas's eyes, "that it won't be forever, okay?  And the day after tomorrow, I am
"We should probably wait until payday."
"On second thoughts, I feel fine," Dean said, casting his gaze around the room.  He'd been booked in quieter police stations after getting arrested when he was younger - shoplifting, solicitation...  There were some things Dean wished he could undo, or at the very least forget.  But, at the end of the day, it had all been worth it when Sam graduated from law school.
sorry about that. This place keeps me busy as hell. But I definitely would have set some time aside if you’d told me there was a freak’in
Dean nuzzles into his throat and wraps his arms around Cas’s neck and lets him pull him up and out of the car. The wind blows all around them, trees swinging at it’s force, but Dean feels warm for the first time in too long as Cas helps him limp steadily up the drive towards their home.
Cas kisses both his feet and the inside of his ankles. Switching from one leg to the other, he adorns Dean’s skin with touches and kisses that could only be described as worshipful. He works his way up slowly, kissing up his calves, his knees, the insides of his thighs- carefully avoiding his now interested erection-and pays special attention to his enormously round stomach, stretch lines and all.
“His nightmares exacerbate his morning sickness?” another voice that is not Cas’ whispers just as quietly.
“Dean,” Cas laughs, shaking his head at Dean’s crudeness. “You can barely keep your eyes open, and you just asked me to wake you up early.”
His heart is still racing and the smile is probably permanent-so he doesn’t say anything. He’s too excited, too hyped, too
“That doesn’t explain how you know,” Dean points out. “Or Sam and Jess.”
Damn he hated it Cas’s argument was
The people passing him shoot him sympathetic- even
Cas is stiff against him, holding him back from taking the final step. When Dean looks up at him, his face is a mask of hesitation and concern. When he opens his mouth to protest though, Dean covers his lips with a single finger.
“Cas?”
“It will be, I promise.” Cas starts kissing him all over, the top of his head, his ear, his eyebrows, cheeks, anything he can reach. “You and I. It’ll be good again. Soon.”
“Helloooo? Anyone home in there?” she asks his stomach, turning her head to the side and regarding him seriously. When the baby doesn’t move, she squints her eyes and pouts before scooching herself closer on the bench so that the two of them are side by side. She then proceeds to press the side of her face directly to his belly, face paint and all.
Gabriel was clearly… excited? He’d had this grin that Dean could already tell meant trouble when he said they would be seeing a lot more of him now. And he even dropped the word “Uncle” like he was ready to be involved with the pup in a more involved way. Cas’s whole face had lit up as he’d stared incredulously at his brother, and Dean had been hard-pressed to respond with anything resembling intelligence.
“Mate,” he sighs, breathy and so goddamn happy. He’s starting to get hard again, for christ’s sake. How is that even possible?
“Where you going?” he grumbles sleepily, struggling to turn onto his back to see where Cas was headed.
It’s more than enough.
“Dean, this is my older brother Gabriel. Gabriel, this is who I’ve been talking about. This is Dean.”
“Cas,” he says, trying to keep his anger in check. “I do not need a babysitter.”
“No, Dean. I have a proposition for you. But I don’t think you’re going to like it.”
“Deal.”
While most the parts needed to be replaced, he’d promised to salvage what he could from the original make. Which was why he was bending low to grab a relatively untouched piece. Tugging on it, surprised when it doesn’t budge, he grunts and pulls harder- the heavy weight of it suddenly in his hand- it’s too much. Too heavy.
Dean quickly spun around on his stool and did manage to catch two or three people hastily dropping their gaze from their direction. They could just be staring at Castiel though… he was pretty good looking.
fun or anything,” Dean inserts awkwardly. “But can we get on with this? I’m kinda stuck here.”

He presses his face closer to Cas’s neck. He doesn’t want to answer.
“I like it. What else you got?”
earlier than he was comfortable with, but then it was happening at work, in the middle of the night, and it was driving him crazy. And getting harder to conceal. He knew the chinese food couldn’t have fucked him up
“Merry Christmas to you too, Dean,” Jess rolls her eyes up at him, letting Sam have his turn at hugging the pregnant dude. Sam’s hug lasts even longer
Sam picks up after two rings, his face all up in the camera, worry clear on his face.
“Cas, why did we think it was a good idea to invite tweedle dee and tweedle dum over here? They’re nothing but trouble.”
He’s never actually seen someone pass out after sex before, but he figures today is as good as any for a first. Even with his body still tense around his fingers, the rest of Dean is loose and content in sleep.
A whimper that makes his cheeks turn pink sounds from his throat when Cas nips at his bottom lip and his fingers are suddenly buried in Cas’s hair, grip tight and unyielding. Cas has him burning up from the inside, hot everywhere until he feels like his entire body is an open flame. He missed this more than he could possibly explain. This more than anything feels like coming home.
,” he starts defensively, crossing his arms across his chest under the blanket. “I just don’t understand why
All four of his tires are slashed, and scratched neatly into the side of his baby, is the word,
“Can you stay, Cas?” Dean suddenly whispers against his neck, barely audible. “Please?”
Sam chuckles quietly but Cas doesn’t at all, and he’s yet to hear a peep from Jess. He does hear his moose of a brother flop back down to wherever he’d been laying.
“Oh fuck, Cas,” Dean pants, then moans at a particularly hard thrust. “Oh god - ”
“It’s out the way we came, to the left. Do you want me to go with you?” Cas asks, eyes wide and sincere as he watches Dean stand hurriedly.
At the touch though, Dean’s eyes slowly move from the wall in front of him to look at Castiel, without moving his head. It doesn’t look like he’s completely aware of what’s going on. Nothing registering enough for any emotion to flicker in those green eyes. His eyes remain glazed and unfocused, but at least he has his attention.
His eyelids start to droop in a pleasured haze, leaning his weight forward to give Cas more room to fuck up into him, but he still looks down. He can’t see his own dick- being blocked by his belly and all- but he can feel it slapping Cas’s stomach, the sound of it only turning him on more along with the wet sound of Cas’s balls hitting his skin over and over again.
Dean was panting and whimpering as Cas continued to thrust in and out of his body, going deeper and deeper, trying to find that spot that would make Dean go crazy. Grabbing a cheek in each hand, he spreads Dean’s ass open as he works his hips harder, leaning over him to change the angle a bit, Cas started to fuck him in earnest, still watching where he disappears into Dean’s pink little hole. He’s never seen a prettier sight.
Both him and Cas were playing catch up at work after all the time they’d missed. Dean more so than Cas since Cas technically didn’t miss any work during Dean’s heat. He’d missed most of the medical conference in his hasty departure, but the day after was scheduled as a down day in anticipation of his travel fatigue. Now though, as he’s trying to muddle through his exhaustion and put in a few more hours, he figures he should let Cas know not to come over. He’s probably sick of Dean anyway after all the time Cas had been forced to stay.
Was being taken care of- cared
“Dude, I’m beat,” Dean groans flopping onto the couch and closing his eyes before Cas can stop him. “You were right about the kids, man. I shouldn’t have underestimated them.”
“But nothing. I’m tired, you’re tired, let’s just go to sleep yeah? We can talk boundaries and feelings and shit tomorrow, I swear.”
Dean hums in agreement, the vibration of it sending pleasure spiking all along his spine- signaling the edge of the cliff. Which is not where he needs this night to end.
"So after all you've done for each other, how is it that you have both become so estranged from each other?
Tears were falling down Castiel's cheeks. "Then there is nothing more I can say to you, Dean, for I have no-one. Not any more."
"Goodbye, Cassie," he told her softly.
There were a few more slaps on the back before a pointed cough from Bobby had the mechanics moving towards the garage - with the exception of Andy, who walked with Cas to the office.
"I got you something," Dean interrupted as he opened up the trunk, pulling out a baseball and glove.  "I thought we could toss the ball like we used to."
"See you later Cas!" Dean shouted, and when the door clicked shut behind him Castiel went to raid the bathroom cabinet. He was not fine. He felt like someone was squeezing his brain.
," Dean grinned.
* * *
"Yeah," Dean agreed quietly.
Kicking the door closed behind him, he said, "Let's get you to bed."
"You know, I think having this friend stay with you is good for you too, Dean."
Smiling to himself, Cas ran a hand up and down Dean's back.  "Good night, Dean."
When they walked into the empty Roadhouse later that night and sat down at the bar, Ellen took one look at their long faces and asked humorously, "Who died?"
"Hmph."
"It's not fair on me, Dean.  If you can't figure out what you want - if
His throat tightened up until it became harder to get the words out but he pushed himself on.
It seemed like Castiel was waiting for him, appearing in the hallway as soon as he'd opened the door.

about what he'd do without Sam. "Thank you."
and—"  A finger on his lips silenced him.
his mom."
Engines were simple, and they helped him think.  But it didn't help his thought process much that Bobby was pissed to see him buried in an engine, and got even more pissed when he fixed the right parts on the wrong car.  In the end, after giving him an ear-bashing about not paying attention, Bobby sent him home at lunch telling him that he didn't want to see his sorry ass 'til next Monday.
, okay?"
"Do you want a ride down?"
Pinching Castiel's nose and tipping his head back, Dean exhaled twice into the other man's mouth. He paused to check if Castiel was breathing, and was rewarded by him choking in his ear. He rolled Castiel's rather limp form over onto his side as he wretched up water.
"What, like drinking and watching TV?  Besides,
Maybe there was something to be said about having good manners...
Fear churned in the emptiness in his stomach at the thought of losing Cas, and he took four steps forward so he standing right in front of him.  "We're together," he said, cupping Cas's face.  He studied his friend's - no, his
"I only wanted two or three," Cas grinned.
"Anyway, thanks for keeping the noise down at night," Ben teased with a cheeky grin.
"What?  Cas, come on—"
Not having any other choice at this point, Castiel followed him.

Castiel stared at him.  "That has no relation to our lack of money."
to feel comfortable talking to them about personal issues.
"I worry about you, too."
Dean pointed Cas in the direction of his tape collection, and he shoved something into the player.

going to lose Cas.  Throwing himself at the man and fisting his hands in the guy's jacket, which steadied him as the room started to spin around him, he growled, "Look at me!"
"Ohhh!" Benny and Andy exclaimed together as Bobby slapped him round the back of the head.
"Look me in the eye, and tell me that this isn't because of Bobby," Cas said, turning over to face Dean.  "That it's because you're
Telling Cas was easier said than done, Dean mused as he walked down the stairs out of the building.  Cas could be so understanding, and had the patience of a saint, when he was being rational.  But he was in love, and sometimes his heart ruled his head, and
"We meet again," she said loudly.
Dean opened his mouth but then closed it again, swallowing a joke about ditching his therapy sessions.  "I could stop drinking again," he suggested instead.
Cas looked confused but said nothing.
Collapsing on the shingle on the riverbank, he lay down beside Castiel to catch his breath.
"Does it matter?" Cas asked, getting defensive.  He didn't want to tell Dean
"I'm just so used to people – well, my father – telling me what to do," Castiel admitted.
She looked confused at his seemingly random outburst, but flipped him off before pocketing her tip with a smile.
"He is," Dean agreed quickly.  "He's the best."
"You'll knock 'em dead."

Eventually the insistent

"Why should I?" Dean retorted.  "The guy's a dick.  He was asking for it."
" before apologising for telling Dean what he could and couldn't do, but insisting that he was only concerned for Dean's health. (He wasn't too impressed when Dean joked that he got his vegetables on pizza.) However, they quickly fell into a routine that involved Castiel seeing something and deciding what he could cook with it, and then asking Dean if it sounded like something he liked, or would like to try, eating, but the time they were halfway round the store the contents of the cart were probably five times what Dean would usually buy for himself.
.  You put yourself first, Castiel.  I'm proud of you."  She noticed how torn he looked.  "How do you feel about the decision you've made?"
Cas put his pen down and clasped his hands together.  "Dean, I
Castiel's eyes widened, but Dean shook his head and laughed.
By the time they got into the town, they were running to shelter in one of the shops.
Castiel kissed him.  "I love you."
"Watch the light!" Dean yelled at Cas, his eyes on the ceiling.
It was no wonder Cas continued to have doubts about Dean's commitment.  Hell, if Dean hadn't been too drunk to pay attention he'd have had the same doubts before Lisa told him it was over.  During the last couple of months of their relationship, she wouldn't touch him or instigate anything - but would always seem willing whenever he made a move.  They'd used each other, trying to find what they needed in the other, but it had all fallen apart.

"Save your breath, Dean.  Jess and I have talked about this.  The answer's no."
A frown appeared on Benny's face.  "What - he didn't trust me?!"

"Going where?" Dean asked. "You said it yourself, you've got nowhere
"You saw her today?  I didn't think you had an appointment."
Dean awoke with a start, blankets tangled around his lower half and his when he reached for the bedside light he fell out of bed with a dull
"Okay.  You know, I can't believe you know how to use one of those," he said conversationally.
"Yeah, to celebrate," Dean clarified, as he led him back towards the car.
"I'm hoping to change your mind about this computer."

"There are cars in the garage, so what the hell are you still standing out here for?"
An embarrassed chuckle burst past Dean's lips.  "Yeah.  Um, about that..."
"Like your porn magazines?" Cas asked wryly.

"Well, there's nothing wrong with trying to spread a little happiness."
Castiel stayed there until Dean fell asleep, brushing his other hand through Dean's hair and thinking that it was just as soft as it looked.  When a deep snore rumbled in Dean's throat, he eased himself out of the bed and returned to his own.
Except Bobby was dead, Ellen was grieving, Jo was supporting her mother, Andy and Benny were fearing for their jobs, and Sam was hundreds if not thousands of miles away.
Castiel thought about it.  "Probably not."
"I could watch you do that instead."
Eventually Castiel got his shoes off, by which point Dean was nearly in the water. He gathered their shoes and socks and hurried after him.
"By the way, did I thank you for what you did for my boy?" Bobby asked her quietly.
bed, not that it was even a proper bed.  And he wanted to go
"Dean!" Castiel shouted above the music as they passed their pool table.  "The drinks!"  He pointed at the bar.
Dean frowned, wanting to know why Castiel had been turned away; why no-one who knew him would help him. But the desperation in Castiel's eyes made him bite his tongue – for now – and he let the matter drop.
"Macaroni and cheese.  I thought you were helping Ben with his game?"
Dean shook his head;
"Yeah, but there's a difference between
"Good.  We're going out tonight, actually, but ...  I've moved back in with Dean."
He forgets all about it when a noise fills the room. He can hear Cas gasp quietly next to him, but everything goes silent except for the thrumming now echoing in his ears. Mouth dropping open in awe and tears springing unbidden to his eyes, he stares incredulously at Pamela, desperate for her to explain what’s happening even though he’s pretty sure he already knows.
Wiggling around a bit so the pup’s weight shift off his bladder, he’s interrupted by a swift kick right where he’s trying to alleviate the pressure.
Cas was probably the most selfless, kindest, gentlest person he’d ever met. If he ever met that asshole, he better watch his fucking back.
“Yeah. We get it,” Sam laughs. “Newly mated. Call us tomorrow when you’re wearing clothes.”
He could forget about what he was.
Dean at least makes it half way through the movie before he finds his nose pressed against Cas’s neck and his eyes too heavy to open.
“You tried to hurt him, and you succeeded. Yet he is
“I mean,
What a loaded question. The world was the problem.
Closer and closer, until Cas is a solid wall of heat and warmth all along his side.
He’s seen the messages and voicemails of course. Seen them replace the ones previously left multiple times, as Cas, Sam, Jess, Bobby, and even Benny try to reach him. Seen them, and ignored them. He hasn’t picked up his phone or read any of the messages since the night he left Cas’s. He’s not ready to answer them, or even hear his-
Sam and Jess watch them cautiously, Jess pretending and failing, to look occupied by the menus sitting in front of them all. Sam doesn’t even pretend like he’s not actively listening.
Cas presses against his throat until he’s able to kiss Dean’s mating mark, slipping just enough tongue against skin to have Dean groan loudly. The smell of slick gets stronger, and Cas’s kiss turns into a low growl against his throat.
Fucking hell, he was screwed.
It’s like they were both waiting for a sign, some indication that it’s okay to move.
Of course it’s Cas. Who else would it be, honestly?
Slowly, he nods his head. “Yeah Cas. Okay.”
. Cas was hardwired to protect Dean. Just as if they were mated.
Hey peeps. So real life is starting next week- be prepared for slower updates unfortunately! Love y'all- hope you enjoy!
“Are you still with me, Dean?”
“Dean is very strong. Strong and extremely stubborn. I doubt I had much sway over any of his decisions thus far.”
The name has Cas growling possessively against his skin, and his fingers slotting back into place in his hole- harder now and definitely nudging his prostate this time, causing Dean to throw his head back and bite his lip. Cas zeros in on the motion.
“There is a million things I could say to you right now, things I’ve been waiting to say for the majority of my life-“
But I guess that’s too hard for you, huh?”
“Babies love me,” she giggles as they both feel another kick. “See?”
. And here he was moping over some hurt feelings.
“I also know you’re full of shit.”
Hopefully the fun shit will be coming soon (meaning a certain sexy angel), so hang in there!
“Hello, Dean,” comes Cas’s customary greeting- and Dean finds himself smiling at the sound of it despite the circumstances. “How are you?”
?” Cas says just as sharply. “What were any of us supposed to say, Dean? This is
Smirking still, he trails behind Cas as they arrive at the door still adorned with paper angels. He wants to ask where they came from, but before he can, Cas is opening the door and stepping through. Without his nice work clothes, Cas pretty much looks like any patient in the waiting room with his jeans and dark blue pullover.
Once in the car, he'd played something at almost deafening levels and refused to let Castiel turn it down.  When they got in they unpacked the groceries in silence, and as Castiel took the toilet roll to the bathroom Dean stomped into the living room and put the TV on.
A dark-haired woman, very obviously pregnant, stood drinking orange juice out of a champagne flute.
Dean felt guilty.  "That's not...  I didn't mean..."  Dean put his hands on Cas's shoulders and looked him straight in the eye.  "I'd listen to you.  If you wanted to talk...  I'd listen," he said awkwardly.
"Ah."
"I guess."
Dean sighed.  "It would have been free."
"Such as?"
There was a clatter in the corridor.  "Son of a bitch!"  Another slam – that would be the bathroom door, Castiel deduced.  A few minutes later Dean came storming up the corridor and into the front room, his hand wrapped in toilet paper.
Cas tiptoed closer.  "Dean," he pleaded softly, "don't shut me out."
"No," he lied.  Not completely, anyway.
"Then shut up."
"You're
"What about you?" Cas asked, moving the subject safely away from himself.  "Do you live with anyone?"
.  Dean was hurting, and lost.  He wanted to feel something and nothing.  He rubbed his fingers along Dean's lower lip, then back again.
Dean laughed.  "Well I think that definitely rules me out for the priesthood!"

Dean let out a huff of disagreement.  "I don't think Sam can beat my level of stupid," he said, turning round in Cas's arms.  "I mean, I manage to pick fights with my...
"I want to.  I want you to understand.  To know that it wasn't because of
"Wow, thanks," Cas replied sarcastically.
When he was close enough, he backed into the door and forced it open, rushing back into the darkness of the bar and bumping into two people in his rush to get outside.  Just as he was about to clear the last table, a hand gripped his forearm and spun him around.
"You don't know
"And that hurt you?  Made you angry?"
For a moment Castiel thought he meant the colour – the rich, deep blue paint matched his eyes – but then he realised Dean would be more technical than that.  "In what way?"
"I think," Cas said, kissing him hesitantly, "that we were about
"Like a plan," Dean grinned. "I'll see what I've got in the cupboards – there's not much, but I should be able to scrape something together that'll survive the cooking process."
"No.  But I can hear your voice."
"You look disappointed by that."
, he thought to himself, the vulnerability of the small creature already chipping away at his resolve not to have it in the apartment.  "It's so small!" he whispered, a tickling sensation building in his nose.
Charlie shot Cas an innocent smile.  "I'll just get back to familiarising myself with the databases."
hurt him.
Dean stared sullenly at him.
Then the doctor's hand was resting on his shoulder.  "He's still out of it just now, but you can go in and see him whenever you want."
Dean swallowed.  "It was hard," he admitted, keeping his voice low.  "Trying to take Dad off the pedestal I've put him on for so long is tough, but it's getting easier."
"Dude, I think you just gave me whiplash," he joked, rubbing his neck.
"I know it's not."
Leaning forward and putting the plate on the table, he turned and threw one leg over Dean.
Swallowing, Dean replied, "I want there to be."
"Come on!"
Dean would ask for pie, but the two forks was a surprise.  Under the table, he rubbed his foot along Dean's ankle.  A moment later, he was rewarded by a pink tinge colouring Dean's cheeks.
"He's not as scruffy as when I found him," Cas told Bobby, as Chuck explored the office.  "He's had his vaccines, and he's now a much healthier weight."
He slumped against Dean, dick twitching against his thigh, and sighed contentedly.
"Dean—"
not driving, so would you excuse me while I get another?" Cas asked them, holding up his empty glass.  "Excuse me."
Dean grunted like a pig, mocking the noise Castiel had made.
"'S no excuse, Cas.  The guy turned to me, and I'll never forget his eyes until the day I die.  They were yellow.  I mean, I know no-one has yellow eyes, but... they

Dean didn't know when the rain had started to fall, but when Castiel shivered he realised that the poor man's shirt must be soaked right through.
"'M fine," he mumbled.
why it was so important that Cas like you, wasn't it?"
"Love isn't complicated," Cesar told him.
"Whoa, take a breath.  You don't have to pay me back," Sam interrupted assuringly.  "It's not like Dean does."
Castiel narrowed his eyes playfully.  "Maybe.
Cas shrugged.  "It caught my eye, that's all."
"Dude, if you're gonna tell me to open the tunnel for the train, I swear to God—"
Cas turned to Father Reynolds, shame turning over in his gut as he met the disappointment in his eyes.  "I'm sorry."
"I've got to get to work."
Father Reynolds tutted.  "Perhaps your sessions with Pamela aren't going as well as you have previously suggested, if you can't acknowledge your own feelings.  Honesty is important, Castiel."
for a few more weeks if it means spending more time with
"Of course," she replied.
"Yes."
Castiel splashed himself with another handful of water.  When he looked up, he saw the man from the bar in the reflection of the mirror.  "Hello again."  Droplets of water dripped from his face into the porcelain sink.
"Balthazar, huh?" he asked, finding Cas in the living room.
"Yeah.  I wish I could say I'm a modern day Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but it's nothing like that.  Companies pay me to hack their security systems to find weaknesses so they can have them patched before criminal hackers find them and exploit them."
"Jo.  His -
"I don't want to sound like a chick, but I don't even want to think about us breaking up.  I want to keep you all to myself, because I'm selfish and greedy like that."
"You treated us to a nice dinner," Cas reminded him.
"It's not 'cause you're a
"So you two didn't hit it off, then?" Balthazar asked.
Castiel followed him over to another desk, and tilted his head in confusion when Dean began to untie his laces.  "Dean?"
"It's okay," Jody assured him warmly, placing a hand on Dean's shoulder.
"Hello?" a female voice answered sleepily.
There was a pause before Cas replied.  "He doesn't like that I've gone back to you."
* * *
"A few weeks ago," he said. "Maybe a month?  Maybe a bit longer?"
He waited until he'd stopped shaking before finishing drying the dishes, and called Balthazar.  He didn't mention Dean; simply listened as Balthazar told him about things he'd done.  It was calming.  Unfortunately Balthazar couldn't stay on the phone all night, so when he had to go, he sat on the far side of the living room, away from Dean, and filled in some crosswords in the book Dean had bought him.
"You're so full of macho bullshit, Dean.  I always thought it was just who you were, but maybe you're subconsciously overcompensating."
"Speak for yourself," Cas told him.  "
"What is it, Dean?"
?" Castiel protested, for Dean had been passing judgement all week.  "Just shut the curtains already!"
"No, but—"
"Let's get a central line in here now.  Get him out of here."
"Joanna Beth, there are thirsty customers dying of dehydration in here!"
want one?  I could get you one."
"I could count them for you - make sure you've got all ten."
" he'd said.
He faltered a little when he laid eyes on a familiar red-haired woman at the computer instead.  He'd forgotten Castiel's replacement started work today.
"Afraid?" Dean echoed, confused.  "Of
"What did they do?" Jo asked, her tone like ice.
Castiel's treacherous feet took a couple of steps towards his outstretched hand.  "I..."  He looked everywhere but at Dean, trying to work out what the right thing to say or do would be.  His eyes locked onto the sofa bed, pulled out and made up for him.
Dean's mouth opened and closed several times, before he said, "Sorry I took you to a strip club with chicks."
"You'd better hope so.  Can we just... get to the end of this, and then get some food?" he pleaded desperately.
"No," Dean said glumly.  He knew he'd overreacted, but things were going so
, and—"
Jo shrugged.  "Neither did Mom.  I just paid attention."  She sniffed.  "She's been lonely since Dad..."  She trailed off, before trying again.  "Bobby made her smile."
"I don't think I want to die," Castiel said quietly, with the dawning realisation of someone who'd been calling black white all his life.
Dean ran a hand through his hair as he walked into the kitchen the next morning, yawning.
"I'm here, Dean.  I'm not going anywhere.  I promise."
"I'm the oldest," Dean told her.  "When dad wasn't around, it was on me to look after him."
Cas laughed.  "You're right.  I

race off like that again!" he admonished his friend, realising that he was coming across as the parent in this bizarre scenario.
"What did you— No, I don't want to know. Just fix it."
"I know."
Father Reynolds cleared his throat in the doorway.  "If you two are done having a moment," he asked pointedly, jerking a thumb back at the soup line, "there are a lot of hungry people out there."
"Good news?" Dean asked.
"When the elevator's out it'd be a pain in the ass to drag a wheelchair up and down three flights of stairs."

Noticing the way Dean's eyes slid over his body, Castiel straightened slightly.  He could feel himself getting aroused under Dean's gaze so, in what he hoped was a subtle movement, he moved a hand in an attempt to hide the growing tent in his towel.
"Really, I'm happy where I am."
"You mean
"'Cause they're idjits," Bobby told him gruffly.  "Are you going to be much longer?"
Dean groaned as his whole world narrowed down to the feeling of Castiel's warm, wet mouth.  "Keeping track of what?"
"How do you feel about women lusting after pictures of attractive, well-built men?" Castiel asked.
"Dean, please – I don't want a fight," Castiel pleaded, taking a step backwards.  It was dark in the hallway, and somehow that felt safer right now.
"That's not a
Dean stared at her, realising with a sinking feeling that he'd said far too much.  "She's letting Ben come over for Easter," he revealed guardedly.
"We've been together for five minutes and everyone thinks I'm going to break up with him!" Dean hissed quietly, too angry to be self-conscious about his word choice.
to sit with me.  You could always spend some time in your room until you're recharged and ready to talk to me.  You can read, or listen to music, or just lie down.  I'll respect your need for time alone."
"Cas, you need to lighten up. We'll go out tomorrow, have a good time."
"So...  Guys?" Lisa asked after a moment.
"Dude..." Dean shook his head. "You don't know what you're missing."
"Now you boys aren't going to start a bar fight on me, are you?" Ellen asked, setting three drinks down in front of them.  "Because I'll have you out on your ass sooner than you can cuss me out."
Castiel merely nodded, the turn in conversation making him uncomfortable.  "I should get started on this," he said.
"It's perfect, Dean.  Thank you."
"No, I'm not looking at that car," Cas called back.
were distancing themselves from
Castiel's brow furrowed, but then he smiled.  "Admit it, you're watching it for Kate Winslet, aren't you?"
Cas relaxed slightly, but couldn't help the small chuckle that escaped his mouth. In a twisted way, he found it funny that Dean – a damn near stranger – cared more about his wellbeing than anyone else in his family ever had, and the thought made his stomach twist. "You're a good man, Dean."
"The who?"
The boy grabbed the box out of the cart and looked at it.  "Peppers and onion," he said.  "And chicken."
"In here!"
As he came to this conclusion, he tried not to feel too smug knowing that Cas had told Balthazar he loved
"We were.  Before mom died."
The doctor smiled.  "He's going to make a full recovery.  He'll need to take it easy for a few days, though."
"It's
"It's not like baseball, or basketball.  So can we go?"
"And so you
Dean looked at him for a moment.  "You're right," he said eventually.  "It sounds mental when you put it like that."
Castiel sucked in a breath.  "Yes," he admitted, after a moment.  It wasn't like Balthazar hadn't already figured him out.  First Balthazar, then Andy, now Jo.  His friends really
Dean ignored him and started looking for an empty table.
"Um...  Not really," Dean said unsurely.  "I, eh, I'm having these, ah, counselling sessions.  Talking about stuff.  Sometimes...  Sometimes it's tough."
Cas shook the mouse and the screensaver faded away, revealing an image of Dean.  Cas couldn't help the smile that spread across his face as he closed the garage's website down.  Andy and Tracey would be okay.  And so would he and Dean.
"Okay, so first, I—"
"She died."
"Maybe

At this, Cas finally looked at Dean with an exasperated and mildly disapproving look on his face.  "She's his
"Hey!" Dean complained with a laugh as he spilled some coffee on the carpet.
"Here," he said, pulling into a small parking lot.
"Have you all been good boys and girls this year?" 'Santa' boomed, purposefully deeper and huskier than Cas was used to.
"So what did Father Reynolds want to talk to you about before?"
Dean's grin faded. "So what stopped you?"
"No, the show's called
Dean stared at him.  "Okay, good.  I don't want you to feel like it's a

Dean fell silent after that, but Castiel didn't want them to fall into an awkward silence. He liked it when Dean talked.
"Come on," Castiel urged, tugging at one arm.  "Just a few quiet drinks."
"If you don't mind.  I don't think I'm ready for
"Mmm," Cas agreed noncommittally.
"He seems like a very busy boy," Cas mused, scanning his eyes across the page.  Warmth blossomed in his chest when he noticed that Ben was also part of a computer club.  Even though he and Ben had bonded during his vacation, it was nice to find things they had in common.
"I'd just want you to have what you need!"
By the time they pull into a large restaurant called
me? Boom.”
Judging by Cas’s reaction though, maybe he should’ve done it a little sooner if it meant making Cas this happy.
“No Cas,” he says as he finally shoves the Alpha’s fingers away. “I’m not wearing ear muffs.”
His dad was right about him all along. He was so fucking weak. What he had thought was a way to prove his father wrong last night, only served to do the opposite. And now here he was, naked and shivering, with someone else’s come painting his backside and insides like a common whore. Head pounding, the nausea swept through him, making him feel hot all over, so disgusted with himself he thought he was going to puke. There was no going back now.
His eyes snap open just as a huge shiver wracks his body, and for just one second he starts to panic and struggle; completely disoriented.
“Cas,” he says quietly, crooking a finger to get him to come closer. Cas looks nervous, but he complies, leaning in so that Dean can whisper into his ear without Charlie hearing. “I’m gonna kick your ass for this later. I might even name this kid Big Bird, just to get back at you.”
Dean whines quietly at the sound, quickly lapping up the blood and pressing his nose against Cas’s new mating mark when the blood stops.
“You like when I talk though,” he says breathily when they part for air. He let’s his hands smooth down Cas’s toned back until he has a solid handful of Cas’s ass in both hands. “Don’t you? Especially in bed.”
As soon as he had finished work, he had been so excited, he’d actually called Cas instead of their usual text, forgetting that he was probably still working.
stupid. This whole plan was fucking stupid. If he couldn’t take a few nights of no sleep without complaining about it, then he really was a pussy.
“What do you want, Dean?” Cas asks him in a whisper. Cas’s scent is driving him absolutely insane, and he has to focus in order to string words together.
Cas continues to kiss a pattern up from his chest until he kisses Dean’s lips, smiling into it, and huffing slightly when Dean nips at his bottom lip.
Cas doesn’t stop walking, but he does pull back a bit to shoot Dean a skeptical look that Dean doesn’t buy for a single second. “I’m glad you think so, Dean. I’ll make sure to use that strength next time we’re in bed.”
Bobby isn’t mad at him. He’s mad
He thinks he nods but his whole body is still shaking so he’s not too sure. Apparently there was no off switch after he gets going. He is very tempted to roll his eyes at himself.
, he stumbles off the bed as fast as he could, trying to keep it in until he got to the toilet. Upon collapsing in front of the toilet and leaning over it, nothing came out except bile and a few wet coughs. For the first time since he’d gotten sick, he wished he had more to throw up. At least it would have given him more relief. Now he was still nauseous but with nothing in his stomach. He wanted to throw up a hundred times over to distract him from what was going on.
It was tiring being on edge all the time on top of already being generally exhausted!
“I know you’ve mentioned it in the past, Cas, but I don’t think you realized how accurately you hit the nail on the head,” Dean mumbles through an increasingly tighter throat. “I hated myself. In my…in my darkest moments I wished…god this sounds so fucking depressing….I wished I’d never been born. Not as an omega, anyway.”
“Dean what - ” is all Cas manages to say before Dean is kissing him.
the baby. All his life John has scorned the existence of male omegas; and was particularly disgusted by their ability to carry children- citing them an abomination, calling them unnatural and perverted. Dean had had it drilled into his head so many times even before he’d presented that by the time he did, he’d dismissed ever being one of
He walks all the way back up to Cas, but instead of kissing him again he wraps his arms around his neck to press their foreheads together.
Working his hips, meeting each of Cas’s thrusts now, he’s barely aware that he’s moaning- long and loud now- the sound only synchronizing with the wet
“Yeah?” he questions like he doesn’t already know that. Cas needs to tell him. Cas needs him to listen.
“You,” he stutters, taking a step backwards to distance himself from Cas’s hands “You’re fucking crazy, man. You have no idea what you’re saying.”
While he’d anticipated his moping period might last longer than a day or two, it was almost a month later and he still felt so
“Why not?” he pouted without thinking. What the fuck had gotten into him?! First he’d let this man finger him, and next he wanted his knot? It was fucking crazy, but Cas’s apparent disinterest in knotting him made him feel horribly insecure. He knew he probably wasn’t all that great in the sack, considering his inexperience with men, and he knew he’d lost a few pounds, but he was hoping Cas wouldn’t have noticed or cared.
“No problem, son.”
“Brother, from the smell of things…I’d say you were goin into heat.”
“Your father said this to you, Dean?” Cas asks quietly, anger coloring his voice and scent. “When was this?”
to do. He’d been riding the high of false confidence last night, and that had obviously dried out.
“You’re too good for me,” Dean whispers. It’s been weighing on his mind for a while now, but recent events have made it abundantly clear that Cas has no idea.
God knows he usually wasn’t, as he’d scheduled himself at work as late as he could, but today was different.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hair either matted down or sticking up in random tufts, soft blue eyes trained on him and an even softer smile….the four inches between them seemed way too far.
asked him to tell you that.”
With that, he ducks down to kiss Dean’s forehead briefly and makes his exit.
“You told people about me?” he turns his head to meet Cas’s eyes in schock.
“I just… feel so unprepared. Like the pup isn’t gonna wait for us to get our shit together, and we don’t really have a lot of time. I mean, look at it!” he says, shaking the picture a tad bit desperately, “It’s already trying to be a person! It has fingers and toes and a brain! I feel like everything is going so fucking fast and we don’t even have a foot in the door!”
“Please Dean, it matters very much.” He had a sinking suspicion he knew what the answer would be, but he was fervently hoping that would be wrong.
“Dean what - ” Cas starts to question him, but Dean shushes him immediately.
“You gonna eat too?”
“Forget hurting me, dude. You basically took advantage of me while I was drunk. You knew I had too much to drink, but that didn’t stop you, you
, he thinks.
Originally, he’d just pulled Cas in by his damp shirt, forcing him to strip in stilted, hurried movements until Cas was naked against him. Not bothering to undress himself besides sliding down his boxers- too distracted by Cas’s tongue and teeth and lips, he’d dragged Cas’s hips against his own. He was so fucking turned on, so drunk on Cas’s scent and body, the sweat gathering all over him and making his fingers slip when he tried to get Cas to move closer, he’d quickly wrapped his hands around both their dicks and started to stroke them as Cas attacked his lips and neck.
Smirk softening into a smile as he looks down at Dean’s stomach, Cas offers his hand. When he takes it, Cas leads him out of the living room and into a spacious kitchen.
(See the end of the chapter for
In a way, he’s not wrong.
God, something this fucking wrong should not feel so fucking right. It definitely shouldn’t feel so fucking
weakness, but he could feel tears gathering at the edges of his eyes now, clouding his vision and turning everything around him blurry. He was so tired. So done with all the shit being thrown at him around every corner, he thought as he sat down and wrapped his arms around his knees, trying to keep himself together.
They had their road bumps of course, three in the last few weeks that stood out in particular, but after each of them he felt a little bit better or at least calmer.
At his words, Dean opens his eyes to consider Castiel again. No one has ever said that to him before. No one has willingly reached out to him to let him know that they supported him or wanted to be there for him as a source of comfort or companionship. But could he even allow that now, after everything? At least he agreed that he needed time even for this.
And it was only at this point that he realized that that hadn’t been his roll in his encounters with Cas. They may have been on their sides, or with Cas behind him, but Cas had
His life had seemed to revolve around the pup, Cas, and work; endlessly circling those three things with Sam and Jess popping their heads into his inner circle every once in a while. He wasn’t currently speaking with either one of them, so he had nothing to circle but his pup, who could only contribute a well-aimed kick to his bladder every once in a while.
He’s pulling out pans and tin foil when he asks if he wants something to drink.
“Uh…” this was so fucking weird. “I just hit the six month mark yesterday.”
They’re not horrible looking. And with his shirts and jackets, the black part probably wouldn’t even show.
Two more weeks go by before his body starts to revolt against him. Probably fed up with the way he’s been eating and drinking, his stomach decides join in on all the fun and good times.
Cas doesn’t say anything else, doesn’t stop Dean’s mad melee to his car, but Dean still feels his eyes until he turns out of Cas’s cul-de-sac. Taking a deep breath, his eyes widen and he immediately regrets it. The scent attached to the sweater he was wearing is
At first, he’d written it off due to lack of new spank material, his old fantasies just not able to do the trick anymore, but even after he’d let his mind wonder to a certain blue eyed Alpha, he still couldn’t reach completion.
” she presses.
He doesn’t bother knocking when he gets there, just walks in on the old man shuffling papers around on his desk.
He shakes his head quickly, but he can’t help but chuckle wetly at Sam’s attempt to make him smile.
“He called yesterday,” Dean says, flushing and looking down at his knees. “It was uh- right before I called you.”
He hates to bug the guy more, especially after pulling off such a spectacular feat, but he needs to make a call. As soon as fucking possible.
Castiel smiles as Dean relents, surprised Dean gave in so easily, and moves the wash rag carefully over Dean’s skin. Biting his lip, he gently presses it to Dean’s face, wiping away the sweat and tear tracks quickly before Dean turns his face away.
“Why don’t you lie back? You’ll have to in a minute anyway. Relax, Dean,” Cas soothes, now lightly massaging his scalp like he knows he likes.
after fifteen years. You been runnin’ around this whole time pretending to be a Beta, hiding from I don’t know what, instead of owning up to it like a man. What about that screams ‘adult’ to you?”
“You just don’t get it,” Dean sighs, “you aren’t the one born at the bottom of the food chain, and you aren’t the one who’s… you know.”
Dean blinks in shock from under the blanket still. “Yeah?” he mumbles hesitantly.
“Why does that even matter?” Dean says in confusion, twisting around so he’s laying on his side to face him. Only highlighting how thin he’d become since he’s seen him last.
And don’t you dare tell me what I deserve. You might have a low opinion of yourself, but I happen to think that you are the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Sorry for the short chapter, I just wanted to update before I leave for vacation. Plus, this is chapter leads up to the one I've been dying to get to! Enjoy! :)
It’s overwhelming in it’s headiness, making Dean feel like he’s high on it; a thousand times more potent than his regular Chistmassy smell. He’s never encountered anything like it before, and he can’t help but burry himself in Cas’s shoulder to get as much of it as possible. And it’s fucking contagious as well, as he finds himself smiling despite himself. This is fucking crazy, and here they are,
He was kind of implying a ‘next time,’ but he was hoping Cas wouldn’t notice.
Cas nods, blue eyes sparkling in the moonlight shining through the window, and steps forward to crowd in close. At first Dean thinks he’s going to kiss his neck, but when Cas just presses his nose to the delicate skin of his throat, Dean automatically tilts his head to the side to let Cas scent him, demonstrating his complete trust.
“ – Cas, stop,” Dean interrupts angrily, taking Cas’s face between both hands. Cas’s eyes are turned down, so he tilts his head up like Cas has done to him a million times. “That’s bullshit, man, and you know it. I’m going to completely throw out the ‘letting me leave’ part, because I wouldn’t have let you stop me. But that other shit? Cas…”
His eyes are open now- only half-lidded really-and looking down at the crazy head of hair as he nips and sucks on the perfect spot for a mating mark.
The water shifts around them quiet and intimate, dripping off their skin, lapping gently against the side of the tub.
“Dean,” Cas’s strained whisper comes closer to his ear than before. “Baby, please. Tell me what’s wrong.”
a tradition,” Jess squints her eyes like she’s searching for words. “Christmas shopping is just hard. Especially because we’ve known each other for so long now. It’s different with a pup on the way,” a beautiful, excited smile lights up her face as she looks at Dean. “So get ready to be spoiled. You and the pup, Dean.”
“But you kind of are though,” he insists, clenching his eyes closed. He takes a deep breath and lets it out noisily. He can fucking do this. He knew no better way to let Benny know that he had Dean’s trust. Even though this fucking hurt. “Benny…the thing with Cas is that he was… he was my first.”
It was almost covered completely in little cut-out, obviously hand drawn, paper angels. Each one colorful and unique in it’s own way.
But from the way Bobby is up out of his chair, red face steadily fading to purple, he might be mistaken. There is no mistaking the look on his face now, and the record for not scowling is officially broken. Bobby is
“You love me.”
Smirking at Cas’s wrecked voice, he pulls his hand away to lick it quickly, ignoring the saltiness of it as he brings it back down to stroke Cas in earnest now; creating a wet channel he always tries to duplicate in the shower. Squeezing from the base to the tip as fast as he can now, he bites his lip to stifle his moan as Cas groans loudly into his hair and circles his hips into Dean’s hand.
"I just want a better look!"
it represented.
Heading back to his room before he sought Cas out in the kitchen, he rummaged in the bottom of his sock drawer until he found the small wrapped box he'd tucked away.  As he was doing so, his cell phone started to ring, and he picked up the handset without looking at the caller ID.
Their Hallowe'en pumpkins were long gone - thrown out after they'd started to go soft - but Cas had kept the carved out flesh to make soup and, when it had become apparent that there was more than necessary for that, pie.
"Deal," Cas grinned.  "But that goes in the bedroom."
"I take my allergy pills damn near every day - that doesn't mean I want you kissing me with cat mouth!"
The sofa shunted slightly as Castiel flopped down beside him.  "You came in late last night."
"Don't fear the reaper
"Oh, wow, are you really giving me the 'it's not you, it's me' speech?" Dean asked, looking awkward and pained.
Reluctantly, Castiel released the door handle and walked away.
"I'm not taking no for an answer." He saw Castiel's reluctant expression and mistook it for disapproving. "Look, I promise I won't drink. Much. You shouldn't have to sit here with me, anyway. I'm not a pretty sight right now." He leant back over the toilet and retched once again.
Sam sighed. "This friend..."
Dean took a breath, tearing his eyes away from the list.  He knew what his brother was trying to ask.  "A few things.  Like Dad...
"No, you didn't."
"It's just a little fun, Jesse."

"No, today," Sam told him.
"You seem to be intent on changing that, though," Castiel pointed out.
"Oh, that's lucky," he groaned sarcastically.
Pamela smiled.  "Are you starting to see how this is all connected?"
Dean said nothing.
Castiel sighed dramatically.  "The AC/DC shirt was grey."
As Cas unpacked the last of the groceries, his mind was buzzing with worries about their finances.  They still hadn't heard what was happening to the garage, and if Dean was going to have to look for a new job it needed to be sooner rather than later.  They didn't have much in the way of savings, and he'd spent more than he'd meant to in the grocery store - but it was all stuff that they needed.
November 2nd.
Boyfriend.  That was the second time he'd heard that word today.  It was like the universe was trying to tell him something.
Dean also seemed to be ignoring him, not striking up meaningless conversations about football scores or his work at the garage like he usually would, and turning the music volume up in the car an extra couple of notches.
"What the—"
"Cas, what happened back there?" Dean asked softly, frowning as he moved towards him.
"I thought you were okay. I mean, you've been pretty happy these past few days. Or at least, you've
He owed Pamela an apology, too, for storming out of their session.
She put her hands on her hips, causing her tank top to rise up and expose a sliver of pale skin.  "I'll have you know that the the reason I'm single is because I haven't found a man worth my time yet," Jo informed him assertively.
"If you're worried about him, the time to meet him would have been when Ben
Dean opened and closed his mouth as several ideas flew through his head; including buying shorts, and not going jogging.
Ben grumbled, but any signs of attitude disappeared as soon as he heard his mother's voice.
"So what about you?"
Immediately Cas's eyes closed, hands finding him and pulling him closer.  His books fell to the floor with a thud.
"Okay, now I
"But how I spend it's up to me. And I want to help you out." He wanted to do a better job of helping Cas out than he'd managed with his own brother.

Castiel nodded.
"Dude.

"Oh, no you don't—"
"Do you
Dean stared at his back.  "You're always the one telling me that it helps to open up about things," he coaxed, his tone gentle and mildly teasing.
"I won't." Dean swallowed. "If you ever meet my brother and tell him this I'll kill you, but the first time I saw Bambi I cried." He didn't know what had possessed him to tell Castiel that, for he classed that as one of his most embarrassing memories. He'd been drunk, so he'd put it down to the booze. And what had a kid's movie been doing on at three in the morning, anyway?
"But you haven't seen any of the best movies!" Dean protested.  "I have a
"Did you say this was a franchise?" Dean asked, a couple of minutes later.  He licked his fork.
He smiled.  "It's kinda loud, right?  You wanna go somewhere quieter?" he asked, taking a step towards the sink.
The sky's a different blue..."
"Lisa."
have happened, when those possible events hadn't come to pass.  Suddenly, Dean was kissing him and he stiffened in surprise. Just as he started to relax into the embrace, however, Dean quickly pulled away.
me we had - is an embarrassment to you."
"I try.  He don't make it easy, though."
"It's kind of early, isn't it?" Dean asked, when he got in.
Castiel nodded absently, obediently following Dean down the hall to the bathroom where he stood, still clutching the blanket around his shoulders, as Dean filled the bath.
the covers, before deciding that Dean's room was too cold.
His head was spinning.  The garage was going to get internet, Charlie would design it a website, and if all went well there would be more customers to serve.  Bobby might even be able to afford to pay Dean overtime!  He bit his lip.  Best not to get
His eyes are closed when Cas nuzzles into him so that their foreheads are pressed together, the sweaty skin sliding against each other until they find a comfortable position. Both of them managed to keep their shirts on strangely enough, so Dean uses his grip on Cas’s, to steady himself for whatever Cas is about to say.
“Cas,” he all but whimpers. “What are you-“
When Cas wakes him, he’s momentarily confused as to where the fuck they are.
Grumbling to himself but left with no other options, he grudgingly slips the material over his head, working his arms up and through the arm holes before pulling it down over his stomach. It was a tight fit. He’s not even tempted to look at himself in the mirror before he’s leaving the bathroom, heading right for the door as he hears a quiet knock.
Small as the action is, this will help Dean feel better.
See? Ridiculous.
“Are the two of you very close?” Cas asks.
sounds as Cas ramps up his rhythm, biting down harder on hip lip, trying desperately to hold back his moans. Mortified by his body’s reactions.
It can’t be.
“Mmmm,” Dean hums, closing his eyes and widening his legs a little in invitation. A finger immediately dips inside him, just the tip at first then up to the first knuckle. The single digit starts sliding in and out of him, twisting, before a second slides in him just as easily.
“Oh come on,” Gabriel says, “Sit. You’re obviously stessin’ Cassie out.”
“I want to see you again in a month, Dean, and when I do I want nothing but a sparkling report. A clean sheet, okay?” Anna asks, reaching over to pats Dean’s hand.
The drive to the airport is dead silent- not even the usual strings of classical music to fill in the places words would normally take.
“No more trips to the strip club, no more one night stands. Been doing too much of that lately, if you know what I m-“
“What?” Dean asks, confused when Cas sits him down and then pulls away. He pulls Dean’s blanket away from his legs and then kneels in between them. “Cas what are you-
“Brother, is that- that you?” the bear of a man stutters, gawking.
Cautiously, feeling like his heart has somehow made its way into his throat, he brings his hands up to cradle his slightly protruding belly on both sides- hands almost touching- and waits.
On shaking- well everything- he stumbles his way to Cas’s enormous bathtub. Swinging his legs over one at a time, he sits. Pulls his legs up so he can wrap his arms around them and his pup, then lets his head drop on top of them.
“-Don’t try and blame the pup for this, Dean,” Sam cuts in before he can finish his sentence. “You have deep bags under your eyes from lack of sleep. You’re pale and sickly, Dean- and god-
Swiping at his eyes quickly, he laughs at himself as he scoots back over to Cas- shaking him awake probably far less gently than he should of.
“Don’t,” Dean gasps, squeezing his eyes closed and clenching his fingers in the front of Castiel’s shirt. “Please. Don’t- don't leave me.”
Rubbing his hands over his belly, where he knows Cas is looking now, he smiles when his stomach flutters under his touch again.
swear that it will be the last,” Cas says, just as gravely, eyes going soft for a second as stares back at Dean.
,” he says in wonder.
It’s not until the thing in his arms starts to cry that he realizes what it is.
But Cas shakes his head, determination setting his jaw. He readjusts, holding himself above Dean’s face, sharing his air between them as he quickens the pace of his hips.
Holy fuck, how did he not notice that he was harder than a fucking rock?! And holy fuck- a dude was doing this to him! He’d never, ever, thought that he’d be in this situation. He’d never thought he could even be turned on by a man.
Cas ducks then and kisses him softly, telling him without words how much he loves him. When he pulls away shortly after, he presses kisses to his nose, his forehead, his cheeks, his chin, and to each closed eyelid.
Cas gently takes the sheet from his stiff fingers, and suddenly Cas is rolling them until Dean is on his back with Cas kneeling over him, carefully keeping his weight from crushing Dean. But every part of them is still touching, Cas is still mouthing at his neck, and Dean’s eyes widen when his legs automatically shift to make room for Cas in between them.
Dean would argue, but the look on Cas’s face…. He can’t find it in him to dampen the joy he sees there.
can do?” Dean echoes angrily. “The least you could do is have
“I’m actually at work right now,” Cas huffs, “And they’re having me stay late tonight  as well as tomorrow,” he says, sounding seriously annoyed.
Gasping as the baby shifts slightly again, he doesn’t even realize he’s smiling until a single tear makes it’s way down his cheek- feeling the wetness pause momentarily in the indentation due to his cheeks being pushed so far wide.
When Dean doesn’t answer right away, Cas leans into his space to kiss his forehead, scenting the distress and panic coming off of every inch of his skin Automatically, Cas’s hackles start to rise, bristling, in reaction to Dean’s obvious fear, and Cas’s scent thickens like a shield- a shield made of over-protective Alpha.
Dean is frozen. Physically and mentally, everything just stops.
Getting bored with whatever monotonous murder mystery was on, he’d rolled over from his side to his back to look up at Cas- only to realize that Cas had already been staring at him beforehand. He’d smiled at him slightly when he’d met Cas’s eyes, but Cas remained unsmiling as he stroked the side of Dean’s face softly, face serious and intense before Cas slowly started to lean down.
Pressing his face into Cas’s shoulder and inhaling the scent of masculinity mixed with contentment, he smiles to himself a second before he opens his mouth to bite at the hard bulge of Cas’s muscle. It’s only a nip, just enough for him to taste the salt of Cas’s skin really, but it gets the job done.
went on the attack?!” he spits heatedly. “Does he really look like a guy who would go looking to pick a fight, man?”
Cas readjusts his hold around Dean, trying to see Dean’s face, but Dean’s already back to his spot and doesn’t allow himself to be budged from his spot against Cas’ neck. “Stop movin.”
“What makes you think I’m miserable dude?” he said defensively. Was he that obvious?
Right for his father.
“Eight o’clock,” he murmurs against Dean’s skin, sending goosebumps up his spine. “It was six fifteen the last time I checked. “Did you want to get up and find breakfast?”
With all that had happened with Castiel, he’s forgotten to worry about his scent- what he knew others would smell now. He was a fucking idiot to have forgotten. He should have expected this, but he really hadn’t. That’s probably why he’d reacted so strongly. Cas made him feel like nothing had changed, treated him like being an omega was perfectly normal, and he’d believed it- forgotten that there was anything wrong in the first place, and gone on as if it was any other day.
“Where are you going. Dean?” Cas calls, and he can tell Cas is scrambling to follow him. “We need to talk about this, please don’t leave.”
(See the end of the chapter for
At least he didn’t need to answer any of his personal information or sign a bunch of shit like he was sure he would of at the doctor’s office he was supposed to go to today.
Ahhh, pregnancy hormones. Gotta love em.
Not that he would get very far with Dean’s new guard dog that is, he thinks with exasperation.
Cas is dead serious and waiting for his response, so he keeps the cracks about getting him into position to himself. “Okay.”
“You see what I mean,” Cas says quietly, leaning in to kiss Dean’s cheek sweetly. “Let’s get you out…so I can get back in.”
“Good,” Cas says softly. “Try to stay as still as possible. I’ll be right there.”
Cas pushes against his hand to place a kiss against the pup, and then gets to his feet.
Doing a perfunctory rinse and shampoo after he’d given up, he turned off the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist, heading towards the bed immediately, not caring that he would be getting his bed wet. It would be getting wetter soon. He was tired, even just the small effort in the shower had exhausted him. Hopefully, he would sleep until Tuesday came.
He’s so fucking wet, there’s no need for extra prep.
“Has he been playing the pregnancy card this whole time?” Sam asks Cas.
“Okay, yeah,” Dean agrees. “I got it.”
Narrowing his eyes and feeling his irritation level going up with the word “help,” he crosses his arms and waits, giving him an expectant look, and maintains the safe distance between them.
“So this is what mated life is gonna be like, huh?” he tries to joke as Cas discards the tissue, reaches for another one, and gently wipes Dean’s mouth clean. “Gotta say, I was expecting something way less gross and a lot more nudity.”
Cas tips his head up. “You don’t need words. Just tell me this makes you happy.”
Cas’s smile is more genuine this time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The pup has been moving?” Cas says in excitement, renewing the speed of his strokes over Dean’s belly. “I haven’t felt anything yet.”
“Dean again.”
“Hands. Gimme,” he demands on his next breath. He has to drag them away, his own slick making Cas’s fingers shiny and wet, and he places them on the cushions on either side of him. Pressing them down firmly. ”Stay,” he whispers hotly against the shell of Cas’s ear. When Cas opens his mouth to say something, Dean presses a single finger against his lips to silence him.
Cas kicks him lightly. “There is absolutely no reason to worry, Dean. Pamela is a friend of mine, and she’s very good at what she does,” Cas assures him, shaking his head with a small smile. “She may try to get your number though.”
Dean swears his heart stops beating.
potent. It goes right to his head…then right to his ass.
Dean shakes his head instead of answering, and starts to rise a little only to slide back down. It’s barely a rocking motion, but it feels good, and Cas seems to lose the ability to make noises more intelligent than a grunt.
Dean rolls his eyes but smiles fondly none the less. “I bet you’re hungry too. You’re just way too eager to use the pregnant guy as your excuse.”
Hoisting Dean’s legs up high, Cas finally finds the angle he was looking for, judging by the way Dean reacts.
“Hey Cas?” he whispers.
“What? What is it?” Dean asks him.
Logically, he knew he shouldn’t care about what ignorant assholes said or did, but in his head, he kept repeating the ugly words over and over again, burying his head in his knees and rocking back and forth a little bit, trying to calm himself down. When he finally got his breathing under control again, he leaned his head back against the tiled wall wondering how much time had passed, and if Cas had noticed his absence.
And then Cas is holding his hips in place while Cas fucks up and into him, setting a fast and brutal pace right away, giving him no time to catch his breath or find somewhere for his hands. He ends up gripping his sheets for dear life as Cas grunts in his ear, filling up Dean in every way possible, cock slapping relentlessly against Dean’s ass.
“Hey,” Cas whispers, bumping his nose against Dean’s cold cheek. Dean refuses to open his eyes, but presses his face to Cas’s chest, tense and nervous after the last forty-five minutes. “It’s okay, Dean. I’m not going to drop you.”
For the people who are like me and hate errors- please forgive me. I'll go back and edit all of this when I have the time! Hope you enjoyed and aren't too mad at me <3
It seemed fitting that they were here, where everything had began.
“And I thought I told you,” he says softly, “that you being sick doesn’t bother me at all.”
“I’m in heat, dumb ass,” Dean deadpans, narrowing his eyes at Cas, forgetting for a second that his brother is still knocking on the door and that he was two seconds away from a panic attack.
salad right now, aren’t you?” he teases. “Sam here, is all for ‘going green’ or whatever those hipsters are calling it these days, isn’t that right?”
, but from the way he felt. The rug had just been pulled out from underneath his feet, and he’d lost his bearings completely.
like that again. But we’re good now. More than good,” he trails off, lowering the blanket enough so that they can see his fresh mating mark.
“You like that, Cas?” he gasps, finally getting the hang of the motion, and using it to squeeze Cas on every downward thrust. “Do you like it when I ride you? Or do you like that I’m fucking myself on your cock, and you aren’t even-
“Mmhmm, living in the present, Cas.”
“Let me go, Dean!” Cas snarled, spitting the words between his teeth as he struggled to continue the beat down he was currently delivering. “This man doesn’t deserve to take another breath.”
“Sassy. I like that,” he murmurs against Cas’s lips. “So you wanna be my mate?”
Cas sniffs hard likes he’s talking through tears, and it’s only then that Dean notices his own sliding slowly down his face. The first time he’s allowed himself to cry in over two weeks.
The thing he’s feared being this entire time. And not only was he going through this for the first time, everyone around him would be as well. Come Monday, he’d have to confront Bobby. And at some time he’d have to see the guys, his customers, his neighbors, acquaintances at the store and what not; there were so many people who believed the façade, and they would all
Closing his eyes against the terror he can still feel tugging away at his chest, he tucks his nose against Cas’s neck to scent him, fucking relieved he didn’t wake Cas up for once.
“It’s very likely that he wasn’t, Dean. How long ago was your appointment there?”
That’s all he manages before he’s shoved against the door and lips are silencing his own.
“I guess so…” Dean trailed off awkwardly.
“No,” he says uncertainly, because he’s not sure how he feels about it. Now isn’t the time though to think on the boundaries of their odd relationship, though. Now it was time to shower and eat. Then he’d find out the sex of his pup. Holy
him unless Benny had been purposely avoiding him. The dude was a fucking bear.
“It’s okay, Dean,” Cas is whispering to him, the only thing he’s hears besides the roaring in his ears. “Breathe. It’s okay, it’s going to be okay.”
“Hey, guys? Can I call you tomorrow?” he asks, distracted. “There’s still stuff to talk about but it can wait, right?”
Smirking and shaking his head a little, he moves on to the third frame, freezing when he finally notices a very familiar picture taking up residence on Cas’s desk.
“I am if I say I am,” he mutters petulantly.
happy to see me.”
“Yes?”
“Barely,” Dean mutters, raising his fingers to ghost over the lump on the back of Cas’s head. Cas doesn’t wince this time.
“ – I’d be fine. I’m getting stiff from sitting like this anyway. So it’s your move, buddy. One way or another I’m bustin’ outta this chair,” he says firmly, tightening his hold around Cas’s neck and maintaining eye contact. He’s not going to blink first.
“So you go and call my Dad? Bobby, come on, I’m a fucking adult!”
“No Dean,” Sam rushes to defend himself, “that’s not what I meant at all. I just know that you said this wasn’t a planned pregnancy. And alcohol was definitely part of the equation. I was asking if maybe you planned on giving it up for adoption?”
Closing his eyes and resting his head back against the head rest, he tries to relax as much as possible with heart pounding away in his chest. He’d done his best. Now, it was out of his hands. Hopefully Dean had heeded his words and taken steps to care for himself. This was going to be the longest, most painful flight in the world.
Dean’s arms shoot out to brace himself on Cas’s shoulders, smiling around another moan as Cas does it again and again. Cas is staring into his eyes, a single minded ferocity lighting him up from the inside out.
Cas starts stroking his hair and back again as soon as he’s settled.
“So what you’re suggesting,” he says softly against Dean’s sensitive skin, “Is that I fuck you so hard tomorrow morning- you’ll sleep the rest of the day? Is that what you want, Dean? Is that what you’re asking for?”
“What the hell dude?” Dean says incredulously, feeling his eyebrows pretty much touching his hairline.
He’d thought of Dean many times since that night. Of the beautiful beta who had made such a horrible day into something he wished he could relive over and over. Dean was absolutely perfect. Even now, having suffered the obvious consequences of sickness, he had still managed to take his breath away and fill up his thoughts with green eyes and freckles.
Dean hadn’t been able to stop shaking, hadn’t been able to stop the stuff soaking the back of his sweat pants, while his dad sent him back into his room without looking him in the eye.
He feels like fucking screaming as his ass forces his entire body to feel like it’s going through withdrawal, he feels like breaking something; anything as long as he’s not the one breaking.
“Dean,” Cas sighs, the sound altogether not quite unhappy. “As much as I wish otherwise… sex does not cure our problems.”
Fuck, Cas must’ve been really upset if he hadn’t heard or scented Dean’s presence. But of course, as soon as he sees Dean, Cas’s face morphs into a fake smile, wiping all traces of his previous emotions off his face. Like he has to be strong for Dean.
But when Cas comes around the other side of the car to offer him a hand out, he can’t help but be grateful he isn’t alone this time.
“You knew that soon?” he deflates, not for the first time regretting how much of himself he’d sacrificed for the charade he’d been pulling for all that time.
“With sprinkles?”
Staring at Cas’s fingers in front of his face for a second or two, Dean made his choice.
“What? I have wor - ”
Cas is kissing his mark over and over, whispering, “My mate, my mate.
Pup doesn’t respond of course, but Dean settles back down and starts running his fingers in a gentle rhythm over his baby girl, the soft material over her bringing a smile to his face. He’s got a couple pillows propped up under his neck and shoulders, so he’s basically at eye level with the peak of his belly.
knowing it, well…maybe they wouldn’t be interested in being friends with him after all.
“What the hell,” he muttered under his breath, as he goes to get the door. No one knocked on his door. Well, besides Cas, no one knocks on his door.
“You better be,” he sighs, shaking his head. When Cas is all the way out this time, he rolls onto his side and opens the computer.
Nibbling on Cas’s lower lip and breaking away, he pecks Cas once on his nose before slouching back in his seat, ignoring the now even more surprised look on Cas’s face.
“DEAN. Just open the door so we can talk. I know I owe you an apology, but you won’t pick up your stupid phone. Come on, man, I must’ve left you at least a hundred messages…” Sam says, letting up on the knocking while he’s speaking, then getting right back to it.
After a quick and disgusting shower, he chooses another hoodie and black jeans this time, just in case anything were to leak through. Even just the thought of that happening has a thrill of fear shooting up his spine.
As it turns out, there’s not a lot of places he can go though.
“Your face is difficult,” Dean mutters back smugly, closing his eyes but moving as Cas directs him all the same, shrugging off Cas’s helping hands. He ends up in the middle of the bed, head and shoulders cushioned against his pillows, and he has to agree with the dude. It was more comfortable.
“Ahhh,” he gasps, tilting his hips up towards Cas’s questing tongue. It flicks against his hole, teasing him and driving him crazy, before Cas readjusts his grip and points his tongue, working the wet, warm thing inside him.
Rolling his eyes at how much of a drama queen he’d become, he shifts a few spare parts away from the one he actually needs underneath them. The car had been crushed, it’s back end taking the brunt of the impact, so he had a hellova job ahead of him. Honestly the cost to fix it would be more than scrapping it and buying a new car, but when Bobby had tried to tell the owner that, they’d out right refused. Sentimental reasons. He could respect that.
you are. Your flaws including. I want you, all of you, during the good, the bad, and the ugly. That is, if you’ll have me.”
“I don’t think so, Dean. Yeah I’m a little miffed that you didn’t tell me, but how could I be seriously angry when we both are obviously where need to be? And who we need to be with.”
He suddenly remembers all the cryptic warnings from the airport, and his shock turns to anger. “You knew. All three of you knew, and you didn’t say anything? How?”
It was quiet as they exited the shower together, towels loosely wrapped around both their waists, Dean having to hold his while Cas’s was tucked in. But instead of following Cas to Dean’s closet to get something to sleep in, he bites his lip, frozen on the spot, staring at the bed he hadn’t slept in for almost two weeks.
“Young?” she scoffs. “Age has nothing to do with awesomeness, Hand-maiden!”
can eat first. It shouldn’t take me long.”
“What are you even- what? You think I? That we-me? NO,” Dean stutters frantically, tripping over his words. “We’re not
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” Dean groans. “Not even born yet, and the kid’s already trouble.”
, he forgoes the wash cloth completely, lathers up his hand and reaches behind himself quickly to scrub between his cheeks, gritting his teeth at the accidental pleasure the touch causes. It shouldn’t feel good dammit! It never had before, and he wishes it didn’t now. It just made him feel like even more of a freak, even more uncomfortable in his own skin.
“Well would you look at that,” Pam shatters the silence and recaptures both their attentions. “Seems someone felt like cooperating today. Congratulations gentlemen, it’s a girl.”
, it’s all he can do to keep himself on his side of the bed.
Cas rolls his eyes at him.
Biting his lip anxiously, he shakes his head at himself one more time before leaving the bathroom.
“God bless you.”
he had a purpose. He was supposed to be doing something!
When Cas feels him tense, he laughs harder and touches his nose to Dean’s cheek.
Too heavy for Cas, and Dean closes his eyes and holds his breath when Cas’s hold seems to dip.
Not that anyone had tried, he thinks, anger coloring his thoughts as he sees the drop off sign inching closer.
“You’re not in trouble. Not that I know about, anyway,” Bobby rolls his eyes and then sighs, looking much older all of a sudden. “I wanted to have this talk with you later, but after the last time I saw you, I gotta do it now. And I know you’re not gonna be too happy with me once I do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
So much fluff oh my god.
had put there…Fuck.
“Well,” he starts hoarsely, aware that Cas’ undivided attention is on his face now, “I’d call that a mission accomplished.”
Listening as Cas makes his way blindly to the other side of the bed, Dean pulls the comforter up and slips underneath. The bed dips as Castiel does the same. On opposite sides of the bed, both of them lie on their backs to look up at the ceiling. They’re close enough to smell each other’s scent, but far enough away that Dean can’t feel Cas’s heat. He secretly wishes he could, because even with the blankets, he’s still cold. But this will have to do for now.  And it’s enough, because he can still absorb the comfort of the Alpha’s scent without seeming too needy. He’ll take whatever he can get right now.
How reassuring.
“Do it, little Alpha. I want you to,” he says softly.
“Are you sure it’s me stressing him out?” Dean grumbles but relents as he sits and lets Cas push his seat into the table slightly. Cas takes the seat right next to him instead of the chair across from him like before, and he can’t say he’s complaining as he gets a whiff of Cas’s scent. It smells… happy?
“And what, I’m guessing this is a bad thing?”
“Yeah? Well fuck you,” he mutters, chuckling wetly when he immediately feels another kick.
God, he could just imagine those thighs- so thick and strong from running- thrusting against him vigorously, the meaty muscle hitting the back of his thighs, skin slapping-
together. There was fucking
“-Don’t say that you are fine, Dean,” Cas huffs. “You’re not fine. But you will be. Just…Just let me do this.”
sexy, Dean.”
“Sure, whatever I guess. A free drink is a free drink.” He relented. No harm in hearing this dude’s story. Just because bed head was interested, didn’t mean anything would come from it. “But you gotta tell me what’s up with you before I drink anything.”
The baby kicks again and they pull apart- Sam smirking, Dean wiping quickly at his eyes like he’s hiding the evidence of his emotions.
“I don’t have to wear a costume or anything, right?” he asks cautiously, only half joking.
He can hear a scoff at the other end, “It’s not just your own anymore, Dean. Dad said he’s pretty messed up. Said that other Alpha attacked him. Care to explain? Because I don’t get it.”
to be blind- and didn’t that sting? So he turns to smirk at Cas.
He doesn’t even try to deny himself the comfort of Cas’s touch, not now. As soon as Dean lays down on his side, all he has to do is scooch back and touch Cas’s hand to give Cas the signal to spoon him. Only this time, the way Cas automatically presses himself to Dean’s back to cradle their pup instinctively has him tearing up with sadness instead of happiness. Cas didn’t need much prompting to wrap his entire being around Dean.
The second attempt went much better than the first, so a few minutes later he carried two plates of food through to the sitting room.  Dean started moving the cushions next to him to make room for Cas, but after handing one plate to Dean without a word he sat on the other sofa.
"Okay,
"But speaking of presents..."  Dean hurried down the hall to grab Ben's gift.  "It's from both of us," he said when he came back, and handed it to him.
"Yeah.  I don't know..."
Dean's hand fisted without thinking and then Rufus and Bobby were wrestling him away from Gordon.
"On Gordon's car, not his face," Dean added.
"No."

"And that's one too many, Dean.  I'm sorry, I really do want you to be a part of Ben's life, but until I can trust you with him I can't—"
Pamela glanced up at the clock.  Dean's appointment wasn't over, so there was a chance - however slim - that he'd return if and when he calmed down.
"It's most likely gang-related, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask:  does anyone know of any reason they might be a target, in case this turns out to be unrelated?"
Or maybe
Slowly, Cas sank back into his seat as well.
"No," Dean said through gritted teeth, clearly annoyed at having his own analogy thrown back at him, "but having a bad leg would affect your life."
"Hmm," Bobby mused. "Well, there are some people who just slot right into your life like that." Bobby looked at his watch. "Look, I haven't got the money to pay you the overtime you've been putting in lately, so why don't you take off home now. We'll manage here, and you can talk to this guy. Cas, was it?"
Castiel shot him a look of mock surprise.  "You're letting

with me, and that I'm wasting my time loving you."
"A website," he stated.  "Bobby should have a website."
"Well, for a minute it did," he concedes, trying to will away the returning tension in his body.
"Your brother loves you."  Cas placed two fingers over Dean's mouth when it looked like he was going to argue.  "He
Castiel chuckled to himself as he got the drinks.
"They're not 'mystery friends'," Cas grumbled back.
Dean glanced down just in time to notice himself slide the blade down mere millimetres from his own flesh.
"Fair enough," Dean acknowledged, before aiming his own hose at him.
"I didn't really want to come."
* * *
"Because he doesn't like it that I call him out on his bullshit."
"Yeah," Dean agreed as he hurried down the stairs.  "I'm glad things are getting better between us.  So, uh, what else did you get?  Did Jess get you anything kinky?"
"I think it's just because I've been standing over the cooker," Cas heard himself saying.
"I'll put another application of this on the paint and head back into the office again while it gets to work," Cas told him.  "Unless you needed me for something else?"
"Okay," Dean said thickly.
"Yes."
"Same,” Andy chuckled.  Thanks again, Cas."
"That's at least something to go on just now.  We can take a full statement tomorrow.  Either you can come in, or I can swing by the garage..?"  She trailed off as she realised Dean might be listening, but he wasn't
Slowly, teasingly slowly, the fabric was dragged across his dick.  But was Cas teasing Dean, or himself?  Or perhaps both of them?  Finally he sprang free - disappointingly, not a freckle to be seen - and Cas yanked his shorts down the rest of the way, tossing them onto the floor before lying down with his face beside Dean's crotch.
"Did she call?"  He was seriously beginning to regret giving Jo his number.
"Trust me, you're going to want to save room for dessert."
He shot to his feet when the door opened, barely registering the surprise on Pamela's face before blurting out, "I just need five minutes."  So much for sweet-talking...  "Please."
"I'm going to get cleaned up," Dean said, motioning to the grease all over him. "Is that nearly ready?"
Castiel's attention was on his buttons, so he was caught by surprise when Dean suddenly grabbed his face and kissed him.
."  That had to mean that, on some level, there was a genuine attraction there.  He just hoped that Pamela would be as good for Dean as she had been for him.
"Then why are you so convinced he's wrong?  That you can't make him happy?"
When he got in his car he'd barely put the keys in the ignition when his cell rang. He checked the caller ID before answering, and he couldn't hit the answer button fast enough when he read the name.
This will probably be the last update for the year as work will start to get busy in the run-up to Christmas.
happens here?"
Dean smiled and ruffled his hair.  "'Course you can."
"I understand."
A shiver ran down his spine.  "So now what?"
"Cas?" He flicked on the light switch in the living room. "Castiel?" he called, louder this time.
Castiel put a hand on Dean's arm.  "When you're ready, Ellen
, yeah, he can be.  But not when it comes to other things - like money, or self-control.  He's a loose canon.  He doesn't
"Given the crowds of children gathered round the reindeer I'd say yes."
, Cas thought.  It took a moment for Dean's words to really sink in.
Dean sighed.
"Earth to Dean?"
"We're good.  Ben's at a friend's."
Dean stopped talking after that; just let himself be held and lost himself in the sensation of Castiel's fingers in his hair.
"Dean?" Castiel asked cautiously.
"Suit yourself," Balthazar shrugged, ushering his 'guest' in the direction of his bedroom.  "My door won't be locked if you change your mind."
"Yeah," Dean agreed.  "I guess I was kind of lost in thought, too."
Castiel sighed again. He seemed to be doing that a lot lately. He lowered his eyes to where his hands were clasped in his lap. "But, what if it's too late for that?" he asked, more to himself, before looking up at Dean and catching his eye.
"This was a much preferable choice of evening, I think. But if you still want to go out, please, don't let me stop you."
When had he ever laughed enough in his life to cause them?
"I thought I'd take a turn at cooking dinner tonight," Dean said.  "I'm pretty sure I can't go wrong with soup – I watched my dad make it often enough."
"Uh-huh."   He turned back to the phone.  "Sorry."
"So, uh, what did you get up to this morning?"
the tree?"
"What?"
The characters - or should that be the writers? - seemed to have thought of this as well.  Just moments after, in a well-practiced movement, Dr Sexy reached out and pressed the 'stop' button without taking his eyes off Dr Piccolo.
Dean poked at his food, unconvinced.
"Thank you," he told her again as he alighted the bus and began the short walk to Pamela's.  Everywhere he went, people travelled in their own little bubbles.  Though he was certainly grateful for people who paid attention to others - despite his attempts at being friendly to other bus drivers, they wouldn't have paid enough attention to warn him he was about to miss his stop.
"Likes my feet, you mean.  What's so funny?" he asked as Cas unexpectedly burst out laughing.
"Okay."
Returning to the desk, he filed away the few last pieces of paperwork for the day as he waited for the computer to shut down.  Once the last update had installed and the screen went black, he switched the power off at the wall and retrieved his coat.  Dean wasn't yet out of the garage, so Cas hurried around the back of the building before Dean could tell him that 'he didn't need to look at a car he surely knew by heart by now'.
, being around Cas.  He couldn't explain it.
behind it.  And he'd bet money he didn't have that none of
Blinking, he wondered how it had gotten dark so quickly.  When he'd gotten home from the beach the sun was still high in the sky, but it was now early evening.
"Swept up the glass.  Health and safety, and all."
Castiel swallowed.  The way Dean spoke was so matter-of-fact, and there was no hint of the usual regret he conveyed on the rare occasions he's mention his brother.
"Good," she said, moving to walk away.
Dean's heart calmed slightly, but it was still beating an anxious rhythm in his chest.  He shrugged his shirt off his shoulders and pulled his left hand out, but his right hand refused to slip free.  He tugged and yanked at his shirt until it did finally come out and he threw the shirt across the room in annoyance.
Ten minutes later, Cas was doing his best to undress a snoring Dean before he tried to roll him over enough to pull the covers out from underneath him.  "You're lucky I love you," he told him half-heartedly.  The truth was, he was afraid that this wasn't just grief but that Dean was going to regress back into the drinker he'd been when Cas had first met him.  While his boyfriend wasn't an alcoholic, he relied too much on alcohol to numb whatever feelings or memories he didn't want to deal with.  It wasn't healthy to bury emotions and responses.  He knew that, and he knew that Dean knew that.  But
wonderful, isn't it?"
"Jo!" Castiel exclaimed, rather loudly.

have gotten a little carried away making sure Dean's presents got enough bows to make up for the lack of them on his childhood gifts.
, but I feel that, for the moment, at least, it would be better coming from him."
"Cologne," Dean interrupted her softly.  "Cas got cologne for his birthday.  Tried it on."
"Alright," Castiel conceded.  Bobby was too good to him.  To
"Dean," Jo smiled when she saw him.
"None!"
"Whatever," Balthazar said, clearly not believing him.  "You need to get out.  It's just dinner - nothing loud or over-the-top."
"What's wrong?" Dean asked through a mouthful of food.
Castiel obediently climbed into the passenger's side.
As soon as they'd finished eating, they paid for their meal.  As they stood waiting on Castiel's change, it was impossible to miss the disapproving looks exchanged between the waiter and the manager - it was clear that they both felt the same about homosexuality.  Castiel suddenly bitterly regretted working so hard to save up to surprise Dean, only to book a table at such a homophobic establishment.  He turned his back on them, unable to stomach their bigotry any longer.  If they could afford to, he'd leave without his change and to hell with them.  Dean's hand on his arm failed to soothe him as it usually would.
"It's about a murderous rabbit."
"Well the last time you were in hospital it was because you'd got drunk and nearly wrapped your car around a tree."
"You got a change of clothes in your bag?" he asked Castiel over his shoulder.
"Don't you think you should mind your own damn business?"
Cas grabbed his ball from the ball return rack and moved towards Dean, tensing when two firm hands suddenly placed themselves on his hips and gripped him tightly.
that love.  I don't ever want him to doubt how much he means to me."
"Alright."  Cas slipped out of bed.  "Just let me urinate and brush my teeth, first."
"Much better," Dean manages to say eventually, answering Cas's earlier question.  "Last night...  Thanks.  I needed that."
nice.  And very supportive of people like us."
"What made you get back in touch
The saleswoman was returning, and Dean slid his hand out of Cas's and got to his feet.
"Bloody Mary," Balthazar said.  "Just don't say that three times while looking in the mirror!"
"Oh, nothing important."
"They're not necessarily
"How many of these chicks does he take home?  None - he always goes back to
"I don't want a beer!"
"Well, I'm definitely in need of the practice," Cas smiled, kissing him.
Silence again as Dean did everything he could to avoid her gaze.
"Why're you so pissed?" the man asked.  "It's not
"I know, I'm sorry," Dean grinned.
"It's not like I haven't seen them before.  You
Dean narrowed his eyes suspiciously.  "What makes you ask that?"
Jody crossed her arms and met his irritated expression with a steely-eyed glare.  "If last night's anything to go by, probably disorderly conduct and resisting arrest."

"Good," Cas smiled.  "I thought... after dinner... the
be his responsibility. And yet... He just couldn't let the guy leave without anyone or anywhere to go to. For all he knew, Cas was just some con guy looking for his latest target – and Dean had given him a key to the place and left him home alone. He tightened his grip on the wrench he was using. If he got home and his TV and stereo had gone... He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Cas didn't seem like the type. And he had honest eyes. And getting those bruises must have hurt like crazy—
"There are a lot of cars," Castiel observed.
been before Cas left.  "Maybe more like all of last week?"
"Oh.  I'm...  Yeah, I'm good too."
The world doesn’t end, nothing explodes, and John doesn’t come running into the room. Nothing happens, when he feels like it should. Something to mirror the way he’s feeling right now. All there is after he finally gets the words out, is silence.
Dean automatically flinches away from the question, leaning back just enough to so that Sam gets the picture and retracts his hand, looking a little hurt. Carefully laying his palm across the top of his stomach where Sam had been feeling for kicks, he narrows his eyes at Sam.
“Dean?” Cas breathes before immediately dropping to his knees and reaching for him. The door is still only open a crack with Dean blocking it’s path, but Cas is still able to run his fingers through his hair and down his clammy neck. “Oh, Dean. Baby, what happened?”
Without even opening his eyes, his senses filled with
They sit there together in silence for some minutes just holding each other. Just breathing in each other’s scent and feeling how each individual breath makes their bodies move.
He noses against Cas’s neck, scenting him, as he slowly slides his hand down Cas’s body until he’s lightly stroking the base of Cas’s dick, making his intentions clear. Cas must agree with the direction this night is going, because he doesn’t stop Dean, doesn’t do anything other than lean back into him as he coaxes Cas to hardness with varying pressures on his strokes. He can feel himself getting wet, the scent of slick beginning to fill the room along with Alpha arousal, but he ignores it for now it favor of making Cas feel good.
The laugh around his dick does make him smile fondly though.
“I’d like to see you try and carry a pup inside of you for fucking-“
Almost.
When Cas just looks at him like he’s lost his damn mind, he pushes his chest harder. “Come on, you goof. Just do it.”
Cas is smiling at him, grabbing his wallet and keys before leading Dean to the door, but he can’t help but think Cas’s head is miles away, distant and calculating. The whole ride to the restaurant, Cas is smiling. Keeping Dean’s hand as classical music fills the car with it’s soft tinkling, the music only serves to ease his racing mind slightly before they’re pulling into a spot right in front of the entrance.
“I could try,” Cas pleads, wrapping both arms around Dean’s waist. “I don’t want you putting any weight on your ankle.”
He doesn’t know what he was expecting- a kiss, another hug, gay declarations of affections- but none of that comes.
“Sure,” Jess says easily.
“Dean, let’s get you back in bed, we can finish this conversation at a more decent hour.” He says, trying not to worry too much. He sounds like a mother hen. But Dean’s immune system is not at it’s finest at the moment, and it can’t hurt to be too careful.
“I told you,” Sam grumbles and pats her shoulder. “Now stop hogging my brother. Weird nick-names aside, he likes me more.”
“If I could, I’d spend the rest of my life in bed with you, Dean,” Cas murmurs roughly. “I’d never let you leave. I’ll never get enough of you.”
Well, he wasn’t going to argue with the guy now. They both finished their shots, before slamming the glasses down once more. Okay- Dean was definitely drunk. But the room wasn’t spinning yet, so he was good to go!
“You ok, man? Are you a little bit disappointed it’s not a boy? I know you had your heart set on one,” Sam probes gently.
He wouldn’t know. Dean can honestly say it’s been a few years(at least) since he’s had a traditional Christmas. And then, he’d never been the one handing out presents. For reasons.
Quickly standing up, the doctor gestured to his newly vacated seat, “Please, Mr…” he looked frantically around before Becky rolled her eyes and handed him the paper he had just signed before leaving the room and closing the door, “Winchester?  Mr. Winchester, take a seat. What seems to be the problem?”
He can’t resist worming his way closer, trying to absorb the heat as quickly as he can.
Wincing as his ass touches the cool leather, he can’t look over a Bobby as the material makes a wet sound when he scoots over. He’ll have to clean the seats too, he thinks, clenching his eyes shut and trying to ignore the distinct smell of distress mixed with the new scent his body was giving off.
His vision is starting to go blurry as Cas sucks at him again, only brushing his tongue against his hole occasionally, and he knows he’s about to come. Can’t hold it off any longer as something builds and builds inside him.
“Hi,” Dean breathes when he pulls away, meeting sparkling blue eyes and a fucking smile that’s all his own.
If he’s caught he could be fined- or worse, the media could get ahold of it and there’d be hell to pay. He’d never hear the end of it, and since the game is tomorrow, he really couldn’t afford the commotion that came with that drama.
The next thing he knew, his head was fuzzy, something was tickling his neck, and his alarm clock was shining right in his face. He barely slit open his eyes to see that it was seven fucking thirty in the morning on a fucking Saturday.  Light was barely starting to make it’s way through his mostly closed blinds, signaling a new day. A day he was not ready to face. Especially before eleven.
Cas turns to regard him incredulously for a second, before bursting out in laughter. It’s not the little amused chuckle he’s seen in the past either, it’s a full body kind of laugh that makes the man look ten years younger. And it’s fucking contagious. What was just minutes before was a completely serious and tense atmosphere, is now the two of them gasping for air between their laughs.
told Dean that he was-?” Sam thunders with wide eyes.
“What the…” Sam trails off and then abruptly throws his head back in laughter.
Cas sigh.
Maybe he’d pick up the phone next time the little turd called.
And that’s what scared him the most.
It could be minutes later, or a fucking hour when the feeling of something of wet rushes out between his ass cheeks, startling him out of his daze. Blinking in shock as the stuff quickly soaks through both his jeans and his jumper, fear fills him when he hears foot steps coming his way.
“CAS? Is that you?”
Without leaving his name. But Cas obviously understands as he can see the three little dots meaning Cas is writing something back.
Cas does not look too happy to be interrupted, but he stops, lifting his head to poke over Dean’s stomach but leaving his fingers where they are; curling them slowly while Cas looks to him in question, something shiny around the edges of his mouth.
“We’re very sorry for the inconvenience sir. And we hope you’ll choose to come here in the future if any other problem arises. Have a good day!”
It’s Benny. Another Apha. But he’s too shocked to be embarrassed. He watches dumbly as Benny cautiously comes towards him, mouth and nose plugged with a meaty hand.
to be. All he wanted to do was jerk off then sleep the rest of the day away.
to let them out. Smiling to himself, he rubs one hand over his side surreptitiously and hopes Cas won’t notice. Ever since he’d let Cas feel the pup move that first time, Cas had been just as addicted to the feeling as he was, and they didn’t need anymore distractions.
Leaning backwards as Cas finds that spot on his neck that turns him to goo, he accidently pushes his hips down harder onto the finger inside of him, causing him to moan and try it again. Cas lets him, watches him and feels him as Dean thrusts his hips back and down to try and get Cas deeper.
Holy shit, if he thought he was struggling for words a second ago, it was nothing compared to the feeling
Smiling a little, his anger finally melting a little at little Cas, he moves on to the next picture. Cas is much older in this one, probably early twenties, and two men have their arms slung over his shoulders with Cas sandwiched in between. The one on Cas’s left is blonde with strong features, a barely there smile quirking his lip up as he looks down, while the one on the right seems to be in the middle of rolling his eyes. Cas’s eyes are lit up with amusement, mouth slightly open as if in question. And all these reactions seem to be caused by the man on the floor posing as if he was in
“How am I supposed to know that?” Benny cuts in, leaning forward in his irritation. There’s a lot of hurt in his expression though too. “I thought we were friends, Dean. I count you as one of my best friends- yet you don’t trust me enough to tell me the important things. You’re hiding now- under all them layers and such. I saw you that night, so why all this nonsense,” he gestures to Dean’s bundled up appearance.
as well. That was all the proof anyone would ever need. By now, he could admit that Cas was a fairly attractive guy, but that didn’t mean he wanted to be with him like
A wave of something so powerful and heavy hits him right then, and he has to turn his face into Cas’s neck as it racks his body. It makes his chest warm and his breath quicken. He recognizes the feeling of course, but he’s never let himself dwell on it, let alone begin to articulate what he’s feeling.
“Uhhh. Yes and no,” Dean begins hesitantly, and he can hear Cas inhale sharply on the other line. “I’m fine, I just - ”
Smiling and breathing a sigh of relief, he forgets what he was about to say to Cas. Turning to sit down on the bed, he rubs at the spot he felt the kick, making a small circle with the palm of his hand and using his fingers to lightly stoke the skin.
The first thrust is slow. And so is the second, third, and forth. But by the fifth, on every thrust in, right before he pulls out, Cas starts to swivel his hips in a figure eight motion so that he’s just brushing against his prostate with only a hint of pressure.
“A couple weeks?” Dean tries to think back, but so much has happened since that it’s mostly a blur. Especially in the beginning. That shit was dark. “I was having some
“But he wasn’t a doctor, Dean!” he says loudly, voice echoing in the small room, finally losing his calm and collected demeanor completely, “And as much as you would like to deny it, we had unprotected intercourse that very night and the morning after!”
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean groaned, “I didn’t peg you for a dirty talker. How the hell am I supposed to compete with that, man?”
“Fuck,” he gasps into Cas’s shirt. It’s damp now, but he ignores it the best he can. “Hormones. Sorry.”
I know some of you are probably pissed at me for not updating sooner. Believe me, I like it as much as you do. But my school schedule and work load is ridiculous right now, and I'm lucky if I get a few minutes here and there to write. Just know that as soon as I can update- I will. If it takes a little longer, rest assured that I'm trying my best!
“Guess it’s just you and me this morning, little guy,” he sighs, side-eying the door longingly. “Hopefully that other dude you like will be home by the time we get out,” the pup kicks him like he understands and agrees. “And he better get us that fucking donut, right? Right. Or else I’m gonna tell him how active you’ve been this morning, and he’ll be really jealous,” he smirks, patting his belly conspiratorially.
In the end, he decides to go grocery shopping.
He looks completely serious and focused on what Dean is about to say, which means he can’t give himself away and ruin his reaction.
“Well…” Dean whispers. “Fuck.”
Contemplating if he
Cas sighs and starts to pull him towards the bed. “Last I checked it was 11:25.”
It rings three times before cutting off.
“Dean,” Cas sighs in tired exasperation.
Important? Then why does he feel so goddamn small?
Dean has kept the poor guy waiting for god knows how long, and here this guy is smiling at Dean like he hung the fucking moon. And it’s not even that little smile he gets most of the time when Cas is amused or someone says something funny on tv, no. It’s that smile that he saw a glimpse of yesterday, the one in which Cas is just genuinely happy to see him- and it makes his stomach sink.
When Sam finally whispers, “Dean,” a few minutes later, he still doesn’t have enough control of his emotions to look his brother in the eye.
“Am I in trouble or something? I feel like I’ve been sent to the principal’s office,” he tries to joke, gulping nervously, and taking a seat. Was Bobby going to fire him for missing so much work?!
It was different. Even during the heat of the moment- with Dean moaning like a cheap whore on Cas’s cock- he’d felt…wanted? Desirable? Something like that. Cas kept shooting him these wide-eyed looks, kept whispering praise and sweet nothings, and the way Cas had touched him….thinking about it made his throat feel tight and his eyes feel heavy with some kind of emotion.
And he felt deeply when someone he
A soft sound from Dean this time.
The sound he makes this time sounds infinitely more pained as he tucks himself against Cas’s throat and scents him, panting. Cas got his engines revved up and ready to go so fucking fast, turned him into a whole ‘nother creature way quicker than he’s proud of.
“Cas….” He bites his lip against all the emotion building up. “There aren’t words.”
Which he’s not, obviously.
Carefully leaning against Cas in the booth, too close for public really, he gets up in Cas’s face until there’s only a couple of inches between them and the ridiculous urge to kiss him strikes again. Cas’s eyes are wide and searching, and when he noticeably gets a hit of Dean’s scent, the corner of his lips quirk up just a tiny bit.
fault!” he yelled, shaking, but with anger this time.
“Want to tell me what happened?” Cas’ quiet voice interrupts the peacefulness of the moment. Dean’s eyes had fallen shut on their way here, and he doesn’t try to open them now- too lost and content in Cas’ scent to bother.
“Dean?” he rasps incredulously, opening the door more to take Dean in. “What are you doing here?”
Cas’s smile is gummy and huge before he’s leaning forward to kiss him. It’s a soft brush of lips, but it still makes Dean feel a little better.
“I- I it’s not a big deal, Dean. I didn’t want to trouble you with my trivial grievances,” Cas speaks quietly against the skin of Dean’s forehead. This close to Cas, the smell of sadness is much more potent.
, compared to what he’d originally been thinking throughout the day. Probably the whole month, actually. Dean hadn’t been overtly encouraging or enthusiastic, so it’s no wonder Cas correctly guessed his previous intentions.
“I’d much rather it be me than you,” Cas tells him simply, speaking for the first time in what feels like forever. Cas had amazing control on his temper apparently, because he hadn’t trying to join in his conversation with Sam at all. Content to sit back and glare at Sam threateningly as long as his own blood was the only one shed.
