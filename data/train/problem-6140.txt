“Really? I thought she was in space?” Tony asked, suddenly very excited for their guest.
“No problem, boss.”
“I want. I-“ He was looking at them, almost desperately. “But I can’t.”
“Hey there pumpkin. You okay?” She nodded.
“I want to, Tony. May I?”
He was pretty sure there was someone sitting next to him. He had no idea where that was, where he was, although if he had to guess, the first guess would be hospital. That is, if he was actually still alive and not, you know, waking up in heaven or something like that. Not that he believed in that, but he had met, fought and befriended aliens, so he was not really sure in what to believe anyhow. It seemed like everything might be possible, these days. Maybe even wielding a gauntlet made for gods.
“Yeah. That’s how it always is, you know that. I mean, if you want to-“
“So, you know how Steve went and brought those stones back to where they belonged?”
. But Steve didn’t seem to mind, he was smiling a lot, laughing about Morgan’s shenanigans. They also talked about Steve’s experience leading group therapy, about how those people were doing now, with loved ones back. It was hard, still, because many people had moved on, eventually and now people were suddenly back. They didn’t dwell too long on difficult memories and hard times, because this was a date after all, and they wanted to have a good time.
“Good night,” he murmured and for once, it didn’t take either of them long to fall asleep.
“I’m sure we’ll find something to do. Morgan wanted to go show me a movie, I think. Something about a princess and a frog, maybe?” Tony laughed. They were gonna be alright.
“Maybe. I think they, well Shuri- I think Shuri wanted me to have another name, in case I decided to not use Winter Soldier anymore. Which yeah, makes sense. I don’t wanna be him anymore, so…” He broke off.

Eventually, they did pull apart, if only because Tony needed to breath and Steve probably needed to sit down. Or go back to the hospital, holy fuck.
“I love you, too,” he said, “Tony. I love you, too. I had to- I never imagined that I could get another chance, when- when you married Pepper, I thought…” Tony smiled at him, but then he hesitated. He didn’t want to risk ruining the mood, but this was important.
It had taken them a while, Pepper and him, to work out what kind of relationship they needed. After everything that happened, after Thanos wiped out half the population of earth and they had miraculously both made it, they had both needed some time to realize what they really wanted, really needed. Tony had always preferred open relationships and it had been hard for Pepper sometimes, to understand that the fact that he loved other people too, didn’t mean that he loved her any less. She did love other people, too, or had loved them when Tony and her hadn’t been together. But in the end, it didn’t mean than she stopped loving Tony, just because they weren’t together at some point. Just like she never really stopped loving some other people.
“How is he doing?”
“I think Peter’s right. It’s a really beautiful story, about how horrible it is to have to hide yourself, your true self and how freeing it can be to receive and accept help. And how important it is to accept your kids as they are, no matter what.”
He shoved some more pasta into his mouth, before getting up and pulling out his phone. He made his way outside on the porch, leaving back a kitchen full of laughing people.
Tony woke up between the two supersoldiers, both of them cuddling up to him as if they were afraid he might leave. Not that he had any intention to do so, at least in the near future. It was a good feeling, actually, to be in the middle, with a gorgeous man on each side. He remembered the conversation of last night with Bucky, him not being sure about joining them, somehow clearly wanting but also afraid, so afraid. Now that Tony knew that Bucky might be asexual, it made a bit more sense. It was very well possible that Bucky had been afraid that he could not join them, if he didn’t want sex. Or that they would push him. Tony still wasn’t sure if the hadn’t already done that, but the fact that Bucky had decided to stay, hadn’t left during the night at least pointed in the right direction. Maybe he really did want this. Maybe all he had needed was a word, a concept to understand that he was normal. Well, as normal as anyone’s sexual or romantic orientation ever was.
“I- I can’t,” he then said, sounding lost and dejected. Tony couldn’t help himself, he had to reach out, taking Bucky’s hand in his.
“Or if it is. With both or with one of us,” Steve interjected. Tony nodded.
“Okay, discussion for later,” Steve said. “Cuddles now?” Tony gave him a look, unsure if Bucky actually would want the closeness but also remembering all the times that he had cuddled up to Steve or Tony. Or both of them. He hesitated for a short moment, then opened his arms und gave Bucky a small smile. It was immediately answered by Bucky coming closer, letting himself be held.
It smelled like lavender and something herby that Pepper would probably recognize but Tony didn’t, by the time that Tony helped Steve into the bath. Steve hissed as the hot water hit his skin, but moments later he was settled, eyes closes with a blissful expression in his face.
Tony opened the door, knowing that no matter how quiet they were, Steve would definitely wake up. He took off his pants and then stole one of Steve’s sweatpants and offered them to Bucky. Then he changed into his own PJs. He sat down on the bed and watched Bucky change. He didn’t seem body shy, didn’t seem to mind getting changed in front of Tony.
“Okay,” he said, not really knowing what else to add. But then again, his job was to listen right now.
“Villainy. Or at least that’s what I call it. Basically, it means every bad thing you did because you were forced to, everything that you’d never have done if you’d have had a choice. But you didn’t.” Bucky frowned.
“Oh.” Steve was smiling at them. “That is a really nice interpretation, I like that.” The others nodded and now it was Peter’s turn to hide.
“Yeah, it’s perfect, thank you,” Steve said, taking a couple of sips before he gave the bottle back. “Everything okay downstairs?” Tony nodded, then realized that Steve had already closed his eyes again.
“Thieves and liars, all of you,” he mumbled fondly, before he slid his arm around Steve’s waist to help him inside. “Come on, let’s get you settled. Wilson, Barnes, you’re on babysitting duty.” At least that had them stop laughing for a minute. Ah well, they’ll live.
The kiss was soft and unhurried, because they were, they had time. Steve didn’t need to leave, he could just stay here, right here in their kitchen, smiling and talking. But then Steve seemed to realize what they were doing, because suddenly he took a step back, eyes wide and mouth open. Tony wanted to close his eyes, lean in again, or at least turn around and not see the rejection on Steve’s face. But of course, he could do neither of these things.
“That’s bullshit,” Tony returned. Steve smiled, shrugged.
“What?”
“No, that’s not what I’m saying. Stuff like that happens sometimes, it’s nobody’s fault. But you should let me look at it. Or, I mean-“ Now Tony broke off, suddenly unsure. They had been fine, these last couple of weeks, but it was still very much work in progress, and he had no reason to assume that Bucky would be comfortable with him looking at his arm. “I can call Shuri, ask her if she’d-“ But Bucky was already shaking his head.
Tony loved it, too. It was good to know that there was always someone around for Morgan, which made days both Pepper and he spent working (because Stark Industries still existed, even if Tony had hardly anything to do with it anymore) so much easier. Especially Steve seemed to love playing babysitter, which was good, because he was around so much that Tony was just kinda waiting for the day Morgan called him papa. Not yet, of course, but at some point, it might happen, maybe. She was still young and didn’t care at all about relationship conventions, so she might not see anything wrong with having a mom and two dads.
“Look, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done that, I know- well no, I don’t know, but I still shouldn’t have-“
“Come here, kid,” he said softly, and Peter crashed into the hug within seconds. Tony felt the last of the tension in his body melt away, content with holding the kid as long as either of them needed it. He wasn’t even surprised when he felt his shirt getting wet, when he felt the slight tremors going through him.
“Yeah. It’s pretty normal, to be honest, just as being gay, or bi, or poly. So yeah, you don’t have to have sex, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be in a relationship, if that’s a thing you’d like.”
“Later, maybe.” And that was apparently the thing that sent Tony into a giggling fit. Troll. Steve chuckled, but didn’t laugh, which was probably wise, considering he had broken ribs. Which was a thought that sobered Tony up pretty fast. Almost too fast, judging by the startled look on Steve’s face.
“No, I- that sounds pretty much perfect, to be honest.”
“Okay. Okay, just for dinner.”
“No, I- I didn’t expect-“ He broke off, started again. “I transitioned a couple of years ago, have been on T for a while now, so- no, definitely he/him pronouns. I just- I just wanted to tell you, I guess.”
“Steve. I’m the best example of how loving more than one person works out perfectly fine. What on earth made you think I wouldn’t be okay with that?” Steve blushed, ducked his head.
“Come on,” Tony said again, smiling.
“We destroyed it. We- Steve he-“ Oh crap.
“You should probably still be in medical care,” he said, even though he really didn’t want Steve to leave. Someone snorted next to them.
This is a fill for T4 "Picture of Tony standing in front of the cave"... Also I just realized, this is my first bingo!! Yay ^^
“Fine,” he managed. His voice was rusty and slurred and he was grateful for the ice chips that Rhodey slid into his mouth. “What happened?” he asked, as soon as he felt like he had enough energy to get the words out.
“I don’t know. Maybe, I guess. But then again, it’s not like the suit with a binder is really uncomfortable, it works fine most of the time.”
“Sure, boss.”
That- was a good question, that he had not so far considered. How did he feel? Still surprised about being alive, but other than that… He was sore and tired, but nothing hurt.
She stared at him, surprise clear in her black eyes. He sighed, pulled her along into the kitchen.
“About ten minutes ago. Have been standing here for two of them, by the way. Aren’t you supposed to have spider senses, Peter?” he asked, grinning. Peter blushed.

He definitely still didn’t swim, but Morgan loved to and she had persuaded both Steve and Bucky to go swimming with her. She had them wrapped around her little finger, which did not surprise Tony at all. Also, he couldn’t say anything either way, because as it turned out he couldn’t resist the combined force of their puppy eyes when they all pleaded with him to join them.
“No, I don’t.” He could hear someone clearing his throat, someone else laughing, but he didn’t care. One day he was going to run out of second and third chances, but apparently it was not today. And Steve didn’t seem to mind, judging by the way he was kissing back.
Steve pulled him in again, hugging him close and pressing kisses into his hair.
“Yeah? He used to be.”
“What?”
“Okay.” God, he sounded so young, so lost.
This is a fill for R3 on my TS bingo card :) Also my third and fourth bingo ^^
When Pepper and he had decided on a place for their home, a place where Morgan could grow up, safe and happy, the lake had seemed perfect. And it was. The house was beautiful, it was calm but still close enough to all the important places and big enough for his new, even bigger family. Sure, Tony still wasn’t the biggest fan of large (or small) bodies of water, but the lake was beautiful, and his girls were happy, so he was, too.
“Hey boss.”
Peter was staring at him. Tony frowned, worried again.
“Yeah, sure. I mean, I don’t know him enough, but he seems like a nice guy.”
This chapter is a fill for K4, Laughter.
“Oh Tony… Does he know? That you love him?” He nodded. It didn’t matter.
“You- you could do that?” Steve asked.
“I’m here. I- I have to ask aunt May. I mean, she probably won’t mind, I don’t think, since it’s Friday and- did you, is it okay if I come- I could come another time.” Tony laughed, couldn’t help himself.
“Hey Tony,” he said, as soon as he got close enough.
“His suit, mostly,” he said, which was definitely true.
“You’re not coming back,” Tony realized. Well, that hurt. A lot more than it should, after everything that had happened, and yet. Or maybe not, maybe it hurt just the right amount. Because they made it, they made it through and he had hoped that they could have their friendship back, at least, if not more and this- yeah, this hurt. But Steve was already reaching out towards him, taking a step closer, eyes wide.
“Both, I guess.” Steve nodded.
Steve pulled them into his room, laughing and smiling. He looked so young and happy here, with Tony and Bucky. It was almost surprising in a way, to see him so happy. After everything that had happened, after all these years. To think that they could have this was.
That made Steve blush, for some reason. He shrugged.
“Morgan?”
“I would have come to see you, idiot.”
“Which one?” Tony wanted to know. Morgan began rattling of all the movies she knew and liked, which were basically everyone with a princess in it.
“Do you mind getting wet?” Tony frowned. Bucky nodded towards the beach, which was empty. Tony immediately made to get up, but Bucky held him back. “They’re fine. I think they’re planning on surprising us and at least Morgan was pretty wet when I last saw her.” Oh.
Tony grinned. “I don’t mind getting wet, as long as no one empties a bucket over my head of anything like that,” he said.
“Sam then.” Tony nodded and then looked at Barnes.
“Right, what he says.”
“I think- I don’t really see how else it would work.” His eyes were wet and he could feel a sob crawling its way up his throat. Pepper looked at him with soft eyes for a moment, then she pulled him into a hug. He buried his face in her neck, let himself cry.
“It’s not- It’s not that.”
“Hey, you okay?”
“Yeah, but they came for a visit. The others are still at the compound, but Nebula wanted to know if we could come and see you. I- I assume that’s okay?” They hadn’t really seen each other during those five years, which was obviously something that Rhodey knew.
So I decided that this one is a fill for my free space, A3, which also means that this is my third bingo ^^
“Uncomfortable how?”
“You really came straight here, didn’t you?” Steve nodded, a little sheepish.
“Has that happened before?” Tony wanted to know. He had never noticed, but the arm was Shuri’s work, so he hadn’t had any reason to.
“Daddy,” she cried and almost launched herself onto him, only stopped by Rhodey’s tight grip on her.
“I love you, too, Steve. Even if I think you have way too much faith in me.” He grinned.
Bucky stared at him with wide eyes. Tony sighed.
“So, not that I’m not happy to be here, but- how? I know Rhodey said something about Dr. Cho last night, but I- I should be-,” he broke off, not wanting to finish that sentence, not ever and definitely not when Morgan was sitting on his lap, hopping around and singing a quiet song to herself.
“Yeah,” Tony said, throat closing up. “Yeah, she is. Love you, pumpkin.”
“Fuck,” he whispered. Steve looked- almost worse than he had after the battle with Thanos, but he was alive. He was here. Before he even knew what was happening, he too was running over to the car.
“Who, Clint or Bucky?”
“Thank you,” he whispered.
“I’m not so sure I believe you, but you know what, I’m not gonna argue. I made it, which is already more than I expected. Also, I’ve learned by now that you are always right, so…” He grinned at hear, pleased when she grinned back and leaned over to give him another kiss. Even if his kid decided that they were being gross and also didn’t pay enough attention to her. Which meant that the next couple of minutes were filled with her shrieking and laughing, as they paid her all the attention she could stand in form of cuddles, kisses and tickling.
“You could have called.”
“What do you mean?”
Clint and Natasha were clutching at each other, desperately, whispering to each other in Russian about god knows what. Probably insults, the way Natasha’s laugh sounded, all wet and relieved.
“Yes. Yes Steve, that is okay, what do you think? Even if I didn’t like the guy, who am I to dictate who my daughter’s allowed to talk to or not? I mean, as long as the guy is not a sociopath or something like that.” Steve stared at him, wide-eyed.
“So, is he gonna be the new you?” someone suddenly asked, which made Tony realized that he’d been zoning for a while now. He had not heard anyone enter the room and he had definitely not realized that Rhodey was here.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to- I can go-“ Bucky started, but he fell silent as soon as Tony hold up a hand. He took a deep breath and very deliberately relaxed his shoulders, then raised his eyes to look at Tony.
“Steve, I-“ Steve must have known what he was going to say, because he was already shaking his head.
“That’s a thing?” he asked. Tony smiled, nodded.
“You’re an asshole,” Tony choked out (desperately hoping that his daughter did not hear what he was saying), before pulling Steve down for a kiss.
“Nah. Nebula’s cool, you’ll like her.”
“I’m fine, honey,” he said to her. Then: “Peter? You still here?”
“Yeah. They’re adorable. And I- I don’t know, I’m just really happy.” Steve and Bucky both smiled.
Natasha and Pepper were sitting in the kitchen when Steve and Tony finally made their way back down. They had devoured the cupcakes and fruits Tony had brought up and then Tony had spent some time patching Steve up. He was right, it wasn’t that bad, not anymore. The hot water had helped for the various aches and pains, so the main thing Tony did was tape his ribs. He’d wanted Steve to sleep some, pretty sure that that would take care of the rest, but Steve had insisted on checking on the others. Maybe he wanted to see Bucky, that would make sense. And Tony did want to see Natasha, too, so in the end they just got dressed in comfy clothes and went downstairs.
“Not much. It’s Wakandan tech, so probably at least in parts vibranium, but other than that…”
“That’s all I’m asking for. I know you have more than enough love for both of us, for more than both of us. I know you, Tony.”
“Are you wearing a binder?” Peter frowned and Tony quickly shook his head. “I’m not- Actually, I don’t care about that, I just- That was never a factor that I included in the making of the suit and I was just wondering if there was anything I could do to make it, you know, more comfortable. Safer, too, I guess.”
“Yeah sure, but you already did that two days ago.
“Accidental villainy,” Clint said with a grin.
“Okay. I’m glad.”
“You’re not- Steve, you’re not hurting me. Sure, it sucks, and I wish you could stay, but I understand why you can’t. It’s okay, I promise.”
“Yeah, the kids are definitely alright.”
“I like Cinderella,” Peter said after a moment and Tony decided that this was as good as any other choice they could make.
Nebula was very fascinated by the videogames that Peter and Morgan played. She was definitely interested in the colorful games that Morgan favored. Her favorite game at the moment was Plants vs. Zombies, which struck Tony as weird, but the game was fun, pretty light-hearted (for a shooter about plants and- well, zombies) and she could play it with Peter or somebody else, which was perfect.
They all had dinner together and while Peter seemed a bit star struck by all the superheros sitting at the table. But Pepper and Steve didn’t have any problem to include him in their conversation and the rest was taken care of by Morgan, who was delighted to make a new friend. Tony really needed to make sure that she saw Barton’s kids more often, right now she was mostly in the company of adults. Which she didn’t seem to mind, but it would be good for her to have friends in her own age range as well.
“What?”
“Did she put you up to this?” he asked, when it became clear that neither of them was going to say anything. Wilson grinned, but Barnes shook his head.
“It’s not Shuri’s fault,” Bucky insisted. Tony smiled.
“Sure, ask away.”
“It’s not. It’s really not fine, god, I swore to myself I’d never hurt you again and here I am…”
“Did you know that they called me White Wolf in Wakanda?” Bucky suddenly asked. His voice was quiet, almost as if he didn’t want to give the thought too much room, too much voice.
“Are you hurt?” Steve shook his head, to which Tony only raised an eyebrow.
“That’s good, thank you.”
Pepper shook her head. “I don’t really know. I don’t think the doctors know either, at least not all of it. It seems like the stones had- I don’t know, a mind of their own? As if they didn’t want to let you die, maybe.”
“I- yeah, okay.” Tony smiled at him, before he turned around and left Steve sitting on the bed for a moment.
“Hmm. But you’re not supposed to wear a binder while exercising, right?” Peter shrugged.
This is a fill for S1 "dark" :)
This is a fill for R5 "Music" :)
“I don’t know. It’s not- it’s not that I thought you wouldn’t be okay with it, it’s just- it’s hard, that’s all.”
Clint was looking at him with watery eyes. “Thank you, Tony,” he whispered. Tony frowned.
It was Bucky who spoke first, after a while: “Of course I forgive you, it wasn’t-“ He broke off, shook his head. “I’d like to be friends,” he said then, a small smile on his lips. “Steve speaks very highly of you, always did and I- I’d like to get to know you.” Tony smiled.
“Yeah. I feel old, though.” Rhodey laughed.
“Okay, you’re gonna make me cry. Let’s go feed your daughter breakfast before that happens, I’m an ugly crier and you do not want to see that.” He was still blushing, but he also looked incredibly happy, so they were probably fine.
“Good morning, princess,” he said.
“Thank you,” he whispered, before turning away and fleeing to the kitchen. Nobody called him out, or back, and even Steve gave him a couple of minutes to compose himself. He had always known that Clint saw more than he let them know about, of course he did. It was his job, had saved his life (and Natasha’s, if the stories could be believed in) countless times. But to be seen, so deeply, by Clint was- devastating, almost, even if it was in a good way.
“Not your boss anymore.”
In the end, it was Morgan who woke them all up. Tony must have fallen asleep again, because he didn’t hear the door open, didn’t hear her little feet on the floor. It was Bucky who heard her, who sat up and caught her as she jumped on the bed, just before she could crash into Tony and Steve.
“Looks like it, Mrs. Potts. What are you gonna do about it?” Pepper laughed and leaned down to kiss Tony herself.
“Yeah, I know. But that doesn’t mean you have to do it alone.”
That was- unexpected. Steve was looking at Tony, clearly at loss for what to say and Tony was almost amused that he was apparently the “adult” in this relationship.
Tony managed to usher them all into the kitchen. Peter definitely needed to eat something, and he’d learned that people in general usually felt more comfortable when they were sitting around a table. Food was as good an excuse as any. Even though that might not be true for Nebula, seeing as she wasn’t really “people”. Although he had to admit that she’d learned a lot during her time on earth. Especially since Rhodey had taken her under his wing, which Tony could say from his own experience, was great. Nobody gave better hugs than Rhodey.
Steve was sitting on the porch, watching Bucky and Morgan play by the lake, as sad little smile in his face.
“Yeah, which is accurate.”
“She is a good kid,” Nebula said. “Loved. You are a good father.”
“Oh, for god’s sake, go hug her,” Tony said, laughing as they both suddenly moved, clashing into each other in the middle of his living room. What even was his life? He had thought that it was over, all of this, them crashing his place whenever they felt like it, but no. No, even after all this time, they were still here, freeloading his food and gadgets, playing hide and seek with his daughter.
“That’s true. How are you doing, Happy?”
“Yeah, you could help us, I’m sure you’re much better at it than I am. And you don’t have to go swimming, Bucky and I can watch her in the water,” Steve added. Tony sighed.
“You know,” Tony said after a while, “Pepper and the kid aren’t gonna come back tonight, they’re spending the night at her parent’s. If you wanted…” He drifted off. He was pretty sure that Steve would decline, wouldn’t stay the night either way, but he wanted to offer, at least. Make sure that Steve knew that he wanted to. But Steve was shaking his head, even before Tony had finished his sentence.
“Okay, thank you for telling me. Do you- do you want me to use different pronouns or another name or anything?”
“Is that- is that okay?” Jesus, what was it with those guys and guilt?
“I don’t know. All of it. Coming out, telling someone, it’s always hard, no matter how much you- well.”
“I’ll come back,” he promised, then his fingers slipped out of Tony’s hand and he could hear footsteps on the stairs. He opened his eyes, just in time to see Steve looking back, one last time, before getting into the car and driving away. Fuck. Fuck, that hurt. He’d known, he’d told Steve that it was okay, but really, it wasn’t.
Thank you to everyone who read this story, left kudos or wrote comments, you guys rock!
When Morgan finally fell asleep, Nebula stayed next to her bed for a moment, before she turned her head and looked at Tony. She got up and joined him.
It should have been weird, this whole constellation. But it didn’t take long for Steve and Bucky to join them in the living room, sitting down next to Morgan and cheering on her. This of course meant that Rhodey started cheering on Nebula, while Pepper supported Peter. They all looked at Tony, awaiting his decision. He laughed.
“Did you, did you not know that? Shit Steve I’m sorry! I didn’t- I wouldn’t do that. I mean, I obviously did, I should have asked-“ He broke off, unsure what to say and mad at himself for ruining the moment. He could have just let it pass, just ignore it, but no, he had to go and ruin what was possibly his last evening with Steve. Fuck. They had been dancing around each other for years now, but never gotten anywhere. And now he’d gone and fucked it up.
“I blasted your arm off,” he said, almost helplessly. “I-“
“Hm?”
“Get some rest, Tones.”
“What is hard?” Peter shrugged.
“Save Nat,” Steve answered, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. And yeah, maybe for him it was. But for Tony it meant losing him again.
It was still hard to believe, some days, that he might deserve this. That he actually might be able to keep it, too. Happiness was something he hadn’t really known for so long, not the way he was happy now. All the second and third chances, all the missed opportunities. All the ways he had fallen in love with people and people had fallen in love with him. To be here, with his family, after all these years was more than he’d have ever dreamed of. And he definitely planned on never letting this go. No one could take his family away from him.
“Don’t lie, you love it.”
“Yeah? That how it is?” Tony nodded.
“I’m fine, mostly. I’m okay with showers, and baths too, most days. It’s just- well, I definitely don’t like swimming anymore.” Bucky nodded again. Then he suddenly straightened a bit.
“Come on,” he said, voice soft. Bucky stared at him, clearly not knowing what Tony wanted. He tugged at him, until he got up, too. Tony led him into the kitchen first, made sure that they both had a glass of water, then to the bathroom. They brushed their teeth in silence, washed their faces. Tony took Bucky’s hand again and led him upstairs. They walked past the guestroom Bucky usually used and he could hear him make a soft, questioning sound, but he didn’t protest, didn’t stop until they were standing in front of Steve’s door.
“Mister Stark-“ Peter started, looking kinda overwhelmed. Tony shook his head.
So yeah, it made sense that Rhodey came back home with them. Tony wanted, needed to have his family close, after everything that happened. He had been sure that he would die, after all, sure that this time, is was actually over. To wake up to find Morgan and Rhodey and Pepper and all of them waiting for him, was more than he could have ever hoped for. One more chance, and he definitely planned to make the most of it.
“We kissed,” he added, because this was important. “We- had a date, in a way, made dinner together and- well, made out on the couch, for a bit.” He took another sip of coffee. He knew that Pepper would understand what he meant, what had happened.
“I- I’d love to!” Peter sounded really excited and Tony could almost see him, moving around in his tiny bedroom, so much energy to stay still. “Are you- I mean, are you still-“ He heard Peter take a deep breath, but he didn’t continue. Tony frowned.
“Clint, I-“ He broke off, not knowing what to say, but Clint only smiled at him.
“I’m Morgan and my favorite animals are sloths.” Peter laughed.
Bucky stared at him, looking misty eyed, too and he could feel Steve pressing his face into Tony’s neck, hiding his surely blushing face. It was sappy as hell, but also nice. To know that they felt it, too.
“I really didn’t think about calling, I-“ Tony shook his head, smiling.
“I know, I know, I’m tragically late in realizing that. Actually no, I realized that pretty much an hour into that whole mess, back in Germany. But- well. I should have told you, I should have told you years and years ago and I’m sorry. I’m glad we made it, I’m glad we got to this point here, but- I wish I hadn’t hurt you the way I did; you didn’t deserve that and, well… as I said, it wasn’t worth it.”
No bingo fill this time, but I just wanted to let you know that updates might come a bit slower these days, since I'm not at home atm... But I'm still here and the story will definitely be finished (I guess there will be around 35 chapters ^^)
“Tony, I-“
“Can’t sleep?” Bucky shrugged, winced.
“Hey Steve. Fancy seeing you here.” Steve grinned at him and pulled him into a soft, but firm hug as soon as he’d climbed the stairs to the porch.
“I don’t know. I thought I might try out this ‘getting a life’ thing that you were always talking about, you know,” he said, now grinning, too.
“You’re hurting.”
“But it could be better?” Peter shrugged, clearly already thinking. Tony smiled. “Wanna find ways to make it better?” Peter grinned, nodded.
“Yeah. Just- It’s nice. Thank you.”
“Maybe find a quiet place for a second.” There was a pause.
“Pepper!” He sat up and then had to close his eyes for a second, until the world stopped spinning. By the time he opened them again, Pepper was next to him, her hand on his shoulder and laughter in her face.
“You did it,” Rhodey said, smiling. It was a nice smile, all big and relieved and honest. “We made it.” He laughed, as if he couldn’t really believe it. “We actually made it.”
Nebula stared at him, obviously speechless. Tony carefully reached out to her, put his hand on her arm.
“What is it?” Please don’t reject me now, he thought, I can’t take it.
He sat down next to Rhodey, moving close enough that their shoulders were touching.
“Before?” Steve leaned back a bit, onto the railing, carefully avoiding his eyes.
“You should come to bed.” Bucky glanced back to the closed door of his own room, but Tony shook his head.
“Didn’t know what?” Tony asked.
“Tony?” Bucky asked softly, still hesitating but obviously hopeful. Tony reached out for his hand, pulling him close. He took a step closer, but didn’t sit down yet.
By the time that Tony tried to follow Peter’s conversation with Nebula again, the boy was talking about the New Wave science fiction movement of the 60s and 70s, before moving on to an ode on to Blade Runner. Which yeah, Tony had to admit, was not only a very important movie for the whole cyperpunk genre, but a really good one, too. Steve and Bucky might enjoy that one, even though it did have some dark themes. Ah well, movie night (without Morgan) would come soon enough.
They were sitting in silence, both of them almost afraid to break it, neither of them knowing what to say. Bucky was still staring at him, eyes shining with unshed tears. He looked young, so incredibly young and tired. Which made Tony realize that he was tired, too. Steve was probably already sleeping, as was Pepper, and he knew that both of them would welcome him in their bed. But he couldn’t leave Bucky alone, not like that. He hesitated for a moment, thinking.
And then Morgan ruined all his efforts by saying: “They’re evil and you have to kill them, aunt Nebula.” Which, to nobody’s surprise, worked way better at getting her to play the game than any kind of explanation Peter gave her ever could. Mostly, because Nebula was absolutely smitten with Morgan.
“Steve, let me go,” he said with a grin, not trying to get Steve to let go at all. “I need to get clothes, mine are all wet thanks to you.” Steve shook his head, still smiling.
“You okay?” Steve wanted to know, voice quiet and calm. Tony nodded.
“Yeah. Yeah, I understand. I don’t like it, but- yeah… Does Barnes know?” Steve nodded.
It was Pepper who found them hours later, sitting over holograms of binders and the Spiderman suit, throwing around ideas. They were having fun, so Tony couldn’t even pretend to be surprised by the fact that it was already two in the morning. They both smiled sheepishly as Pepper ushered Peter to bed and then dragged Tony along. The scene was familiar and new at the same time. Of course, Pepper had dragged him away from his work a thousand times, and this hadn’t changed that much after they got Morgan. But still, sitting there and working with Peter was a novelty that Tony could never have imagined that he would have one day.
Clint was standing in the door, frozen, staring at Natasha. She was sitting on the couch, equally frozen, equally longing.
Peter slowly reached out and shook her hand. He didn’t even try to hide the way he was looking at her, obviously fascinated. Tony could understand him, he had felt pretty much the same, the first time he met her. Or rather, during the time they spent together in space.
After that, Bucky found his way into Steve’s bed more often. Tony knew he sometimes slept there when Tony wasn’t there as well, which was probably good. Neither Steve nor Bucky slept well alone, and they tended to have less nightmares if they could cuddle up to each other (or to Tony, which for some reason both of them seemed to prefer).
“Do you want to be in a relationship with us? Or one of us?” He was looking at Bucky, knowing that he was probably way to straightforward, but not really knowing what else to say. They needed to be open with each other.
This is a fill for K5 "Zombie" :)
“You think he’s going to sacrifice himself for her,” she said. He shrugged.
“Wasn’t sure if that’s still open,” Nebula said, leaning casually on the kitchen door frame. She looked good and seeing her made Tony realize how much he’d missed her. But before he could answer, Peter saw her.
“Aw, kid, that’s sweet,” he said. “So, now that you have finally noticed me, I brought a guest,” Rhodey said with a nod in direction of the kitchen.
Tony went through his bedtime routine as a way of finding his way back from work mode. When he emerged, Pepper was already in bed, but clearly waiting for him.
“Mhm,” Tony said. There was a stool in the corner, usually used while giving Morgan a bath. Tony pulled it closer and sat down next to the tub. “He’s good with kids.”
“You okay there, kid?” Tony asked quietly. Peter nodded.
Okay, now Tony definitely didn’t know what to say anymore. Steve’s smile was still there, but sad and small, not brilliant and hopeful anymore. He wanted that one back, that one had been so much better. It had been a while, Tony realized, since he’d last seen that smile. So, in the end, it wasn’t that hard, figuring out what to do, what to say. He squeezed his hand a bit, as if to make sure that Steve was still holding it, was still there.
“Yes. Clint, I promise, she’s here, she’s alive. Come see her.”
“And she’s okay with it?”
“Okay, can we- can we talk about that later? Bucky and me, we’re fine, we’ll get to know each other and soon we’ll be a combined pain in your ass, okay? Let’s just- let’s get you cleaned up and in bed, I think that’s more important right now.” Steve nodded, as grateful look on his face.
“We-“ That sounded too good to be true. Maybe he was dead after all, and maybe there was such a thing like heaven. “Everyone?” he asked, because if this was heaven, then he had no reason to be afraid of the answer. But Rhodey nodded, still smiling.
“What did you expect, then?” Tony asked, trying very hard not to let his voice show how much the thought hurt, that Peter might not have trusted him, that he might have expected him to react badly.
“Yeah no, that does make sense, at least to me. I-“ He hesitated. Fuck it. “I don’t know how much you know, about me, about how I became Iron Man, but I used to have an arc reactor, right here.” He tapped his chest. “It has been gone for years by now, and sometimes I still wake up feeling like there’s something missing. It didn’t belong there, but that didn’t change the fact that it was part of me, that it- it belonged
“I’m glad it worked,” she answered, equally quiet, “I’m glad you made it.” He pulled back a bit, looking at her. She- looked tired, but good. Happy. Probably just as happy Tony had been, with waking up when he’d been sure he never would wake up again.
“I was only wearing it for a couple of hours, before the fight in Wakanda, before… Well, before that. And after, it was never really the right time and I mean, it worked, didn’t it?” He shrugged again.
“We talk from time to time, yeah. Why?”
“It sounds bad when you say it like that.” Steve shrugged, but didn’t step away, didn’t let Tony’s – admittedly rather weak – attempt at diffusing the situation pass. Tony nodded. “Yeah. She knows that I kiss other people.” He refused to feel guilty about that, even though he knew that it would hurt, if Steve judged him for it.
Bucky never joined them when they had sex, wouldn’t even come after, even though both Tony and Steve made sure that he knew that he was always welcome. The whole relationship was strange, at least right now. They hadn’t talked about it, not really, which meant that they didn’t know, if Bucky wanted to join them or if all he wanted was to share their bed sometimes, just to sleep. Whatever he decided, both Tony and Steve were happy to have him, but it was hard sometimes, not knowing if they were risking pushing Bucky too far, too fast or if he was just waiting for them. Tony knew they had to talk about it and do it soon. Communication was key in any relationship and especially so in a poly relationship, because they needed to know that everyone got what they needed, that everyone knew where the other stood. So, in the end, they just asked. It was still early in the evening, but the three of them had decided to turn in early and they had been laying around in bed, clicking their way through cat videos on youtube, because that was something that both Steve and Bucky seemed to never get bored with.
“No. What makes you think so?” She looked at him for a moment, thinking.
“It’s good to see you away, too,” she said, just before Morgan apparently decided she was done with her breakfast and wanted to do something else. Namely, jumping up on Tony’s bed, shrieking with laughter for some reason. Pepper caught her before she could land on Tony’s chest, which was probably good. She did let her crawl all over him though, after looking at him for a moment, so it seemed like he had passed muster. Actually, that was a good question.
“Nah, I’m good, you stay there.” He put the plate down next to the lavatory and passed one open water bottle over to Steve. “Water still warm enough?”
“The betrayal!” he cried, watching his daughter and Bucky get comfortable. Steve snorted next to him.
Tony pressed a kiss on Rhodey cheek, just before he noticed Steve and Bucky watching him. He raised an eyebrow, which made Steve blush and Bucky grin. But they didn’t look jealous, so it was probably okay. He needed to find the time to talk to them soon, just to make sure that everything was alright. Poly relationships were so much work sometimes.
“I know.”
“He’s good with kids,” Tony offered.
“What?” he asked breathlessly, almost silently.
“Yes please!”
“Good morning,” she said, handing him the coffee as soon as he was upright. “How are you feeling?” He wondered if she knew, if Steve had been in contact with her before coming here.
“I know. But does it make you happy to see them, to have them here?” She immediately nodded. Which was good. Tony hadn’t been too worried, but it was still good to be sure.
And maybe it was just because Tony was paying attention now, but he started to look too. He’d been looking at Steve for years now, almost a decade even. But Bucky was new, obviously, but not any less intriguing. He was calm, almost shyly so, but also incredibly kind. Not only was he amazing with Morgan, patient and always willing to listen to her, without ever treating her like- well, he never really treated her like she was anything less than a tiny human being that needed help sometimes but was otherwise just as intelligent, just as valid as anybody else.
Bucky found him an hour later, eyes red but with a small smile on his lips. He joined Tony and Morgan on the couch where they were watching a cartoon before the kid needed to go to bed. He snuggled up to them and pressed a small kiss on Tony’s temple.
“I’m… I’m just-“
Tony was staring at him, speechless. That- escalated quickly.
Silence. For a moment, Tony wasn’t sure if Peter had hung up on him, because there was absolutely no reaction. Then:
“Not necessary. I mean, it could be trauma, of course, but it doesn’t have to be. Did you- did you like sex before?” Bucky stared at him.
“I need- I think I need to think about this some more. But- yeah, I- I think that might be me.” He looked relieved and Tony could definitely relate.
Tony sat down on the bed, content to watch Steve and Bucky interact. He did shrug out of his own wet shirt after a moment, though, because sitting around in wet clothes was no fun. And besides, it was only fair, since both Steve and Bucky had lost their shirts by now. Tony smiled as he watched them, wishing he could go over and cover them in kisses, but knowing that Bucky would definitely not feel comfortable with it. Steve knew that, too, if the look in his eyes was anything to go by. He made do with touching, never getting too close but also never far away. Bucky smiled at him, indulgent and relaxed.
“Oh no, I wanted to come, I wanted to call you, but- Happy said you were still recovering, and- I didn’t know, I thought maybe you didn’t want-“
“You don’t have to decide right now, Buck,” Steve said. He smiled, looked happy even. This was just so like him, to be happy for others, even if it could mean that he would never get what he really wanted. But then again, Bucky was still here, still holding Tony’s hand, still looking at Steve with soft eyes.
“I- I don’t really know, to be honest. He wasn’t at to compound when I woke up, and then all I wanted was to go home. I- I didn’t realize it has been so long, I guess. Has he said anything?”
“What do you think?”
Bucky was laughing, too. Even he looked younger than he had before, calmer, more settled into himself and in their relationship.
“Yeah, that sounds good.”
Now that Tony knew what he was looking for, it was easy to see. Steve’s love for Bucky was obvious, but it didn’t take long for him to see Bucky’s love for Steve as well. It might have been different, somehow, but it was there. He wasn’t really sure if what Bucky felt was romantic love, which was also because Bucky didn’t seem to know. Tony noticed that Steve was not the only one being watched by Bucky, he himself was too. He wasn’t sure if that was because he was currently (sometimes) sharing Steve’s bed and if what Bucky felt was jealousy, or if Bucky wanted them both, wanted to join them. Or if it was neither, if he didn’t even love Steve that way, although Tony was pretty sure that was not it.
“They would also have fun if you’d join them, you know that, right?” Bucky smiled.
“You’re welcome,” he said, before leaning down for a soft kiss. “I’ll be back soon, okay. I’ll bring you something to drink, are you hungry?” He seemed to consider that for a moment.
“No, I- I think I mostly tried not to think about it. I mean, I hoped you would see, that it wasn’t him, but I also- I should have told you and I was afraid that my mistake was too big, that you wouldn’t ever want to talk to me, to us again.” Tony sighed. Yeah, he could see where that thought came from, not only after Siberia, but also after he came back from Titan. But maybe now was not the right moment to talk about this, with Steve hurt and Tony only just beginning to realize that yes, he was actually back, he actually got to have that.
“Crap.”
“But-“ He broke off, obviously at loss.
“Sometimes… I think-“ He broke off, staring out into the dark.
“Yeah, she is. You’d like her, I think. Actually, I wanted to ask if you felt like coming over sometime?” He tried not to let the hurt show in his voice, but he wasn’t too sure if he succeeded.
Tony stared at him for a long moment, until Bucky tried to pull his left hand back and Tony instinctively held on to it. Then he realized what he was doing and let go, giving Bucky the chance to move away. He didn’t.
“You don’t have to be the White Wolf either, Bucky. You don’t have to be anything you don’t want to.”
“What did you work on?” she wanted to know. Tony hesitated.
“But- I called her a cyborg?”
“Good. Lot to do, still, but it’s going well. The world is slowly getting back to normal, I guess.”
“Tony…” He shook his head, clenched his hand into a fist, willing it to be still.
“I could eat, yeah. If you have something, otherwise I’ll be fine for another couple of hours.”
This is a fill for A2 "Phobia" on my Tony Stark bingo :)
“Yeah, she’s a real sweet kid, Mr. Stark.” Ugh no.
“Good morning, daddy,” she answered, and snuggled deeper into Bucky’s lap. Tony laughed.
“Okay. And… why did you kiss me?” That was a question Tony had not expected.
“Okay, so- just to make sure we understand you correctly. You don’t want to have sex. Just with us or in general?”
“Yeah, I’ll do that. Thank you, Happy.”
“Why not?” Happy then ask, clearly thinking that this was a stupid thing to do. Tony agreed. Maybe he had waited too long.
“Yeah.” He hesitated. “Too close to the water,” he added after a moment.
And a special shout-out to  professionaldumbass who's been rooting for that story from the very beginning and also just for being the amazing friend and wonderful person that they are!
“Bucky…”
“It’s not fine!”
This is a fill for "sharing clothes" with is R2 on my TS bingo card :)
“Not in the same way. It was magic in my case, but the end result was the same. No free will and you’re nothing else than a weapon that goes in the direction they’re pointing.”
And here it was again, that incredible openness, the willingness to trust, to love even, after everything that had happened. Tony swallowed, suddenly feeling heavy with that feeling.
Pepper and Natasha had retreated to one of the guestrooms, which meant that Tony brought Steve into the master bedroom. Which was good, because that was the room with the biggest and best set up connected bathroom.
“Yes.”
“Good. Doing good, just as last time we talked. Two days ago. What’s going on?” Damn, Happy was way too good at this. But then again, they had worked together for ages, so it kinda made sense.
“Haven’t talked to him since- well, since he came back.” There was a pause.
Tony spent his nights alternating between Pepper and Steve, depending on the mood and if Nat was here or not. She usually spent the night with Pepper, in which case Tony ceded the bed to them.
“Just uncomfortable,” he admitted after a while.
Maybe it had helped, that one of those other people was Rhodey. Because she knew Rhodey, trusted him, loved him even, if not exactly the same way Tony did. Rhodey and him, they weren’t meant to be together, not with the way their lives were, but they always found each other again. Tony was curious to see how it would continue, now, with Carol in the picture. Not that Rhodey admitted anything. But either way, it had time.
“Okay, so you know how I say Peter is my kid, even though he’s not my biological son? Not the way Morgan is my daughter.” She nodded.
“Yeah, I’m-“ His voice sounded wet, but Tony didn’t comment on it. There was nothing he could have said, not with the tears on his own face. Morgan was watching him, reaching up to touch him cheek.
“Hey, you okay?” Tony asked, as he passed him a cup of tea and sat down next to him. Steve nodded.
Bucky looked at him with wonder in his eyes, as if the whole world suddenly made sense again.
“I love you.” This time, Steve didn’t stop him (or maybe he wasn’t fast enough). It didn’t matter.
“Oh. Right.” He grinned. “You have a hammer now.”
“Did it help?”
“I- what?” Tony smiled at him, trying to be as reassuring as he could be.
“Yeah, I’m wearing a binder. It’s not- well I guess it’s not optimal, but I try to take it off as often as I can. I don’t really know if there’s anything that could make the suit more comfortable. I mean, it already feels really good, so…”
“Tony-“ But Tony was already shaking his head.
“I don’t want to have sex.” Bucky wasn’t looking at either of them, instead he was staring at his own hand, the one not in Tony’s lap.
“I- I don’t know, to be honest.”
“One late night won’t kill me.”
Steve smiled at him, sad and small.
“I- yeah, in an open relationship? I mean, we’re not monogamous, never were…” Steve was staring at him with wide eyes, surprised, so that was definitely a new information.
“What the- what are you doing?”
“Please dad, it’s gonna be fun. Steve is going to help me build a castle.” Tony wasn’t too sure how they planned on doing that, since the beach of the lake wasn’t sand, but that didn’t really matter.
“Uncle Bucky, noooo,” she shrieked, laughing as he held her loosely in his arms.
Eventually, Tony got up again and walked over to Steve’s closet. He was pretty sure that Steve’s offer of clothes was not just charitable, but that he actually wanted to see Bucky (and possibly Tony) in his own clothes. Which was fine, definitely. Tony loved it when Pepper stole his shirts, so he could definitely relate.
Tony watched as Nebula brought Morgan to bed with an endless patience for her questions and stories. The fact that Nebula was blue and partly machine didn’t seem to bother her. But then again, she grew up with Iron Man as her father, so maybe it was to be expected.
“Mister Stark?”
Waking was- surprising. He woke up slowly, like drifting through mist or sirup or- something. He was kind of confused, if he is being perfectly honest. Confused about his own metaphor, a bit, but mainly confused by the fact that he was, well, waking up. That was not something he’d expected to do, after all. After Thanos, after the battle, after the gauntlet. It worked, it must have worked, because he didn’t know what he’d do if it didn’t. But if it did work, then he should be dead. So, why was he waking up?
After a while, Peter seemed to calm down. He let go of Tony but the hesitation was very clear in every movement. He even tried to hide his face, although Tony wasn’t sure if that was because he was embarrassed about crying or something else. So in the end, he decided to react just as he would with Morgan: something nice to drink and cuddles on the couch.
“Good,” he whispered and knew that this time, he meant it with all of his heart. “Hey, Rhodey?”
“Tony. Don’t mister me in here, I live here.” Wilson laughed.
“Oh… Yeah.”
“He brought Natasha back.” There was a clatter on the other side, then silence. Tony waited and it only took a moment for Clint to be back.
“There’s something I need to tell you,” Peter finally said, which did not help against the worrying at all. Tony nodded.
Steve was looking at him, but not how Tony would have expected. Contemplating, more than anything else.
“I-“ he broke off, took a deep breath, let it go. It was very obvious that he did not want to say what he was planning on saying and yet. Tony had half a mind to just stop him, but it was obviously important. Peter took another deep breath and then said: “I’m trans.” Which- was not what Tony had expected at all. But okay, he could work with that.
“Haven’t tried yet.” Tony frowned at him. Bucky was holding his left arm pretty stiff, as if it was hurting him. Sam hadn’t said anything, but still, it was suspicious.
“Hey. Hey, no it’s okay, you don’t have to if you don’t want.” But Bucky was already shaking his head.
“Not Cap anymore,” Steve said after a moment. “Shield’s gone.”
Of course, just when he was beginning to feel better, a car drove up to the lake. It wasn’t one he knew, not the one Steve had come in, so he wasn’t very hopeful. That didn’t change that fact that he went outside as soon as he heard it, of course, and if it only was because Morgan was playing outside. Sure, Pepper was with her, but one could never be careful enough. Ugh, or maybe he just wanted to see who it was.
“I will. But I’m too tired to make another trip right now.”
“Doesn’t work when I’m feeling- well, safe.” That worked very well in preventing any further teasing from both Rhodey and Tony (mostly because Tony was trying very hard not to cry, which meant that Rhodey would definitely concentrate any teasing on him).
Tony found Bucky sitting outside on the porch after breakfast the next day. He was holding a cup of coffee in his hand but not drinking it, not really. It seemed more as if it was only there as a prob, as a reason to linger for a while, here, before starting the day. Not that Bucky had any plans, at least as far as Tony knew.
“Steve was here last night,” he said. She looked surprised and Pepper had no reason to fake it. Not that it mattered either way.
“Did you ever hear about asexuality?” he asked. Both Steve and Bucky stared at him. Tony was pretty sure that Steve had heard about it before, but Bucky just looked confused.
“Steve, I was angry with you, because you didn’t tell me. That was not okay, and it sucked, yes. But I was never angry at Bucky, not really. I know it’s not his fault, I’ve always known that. Jesus, what- did you think I hated him?”
“What do you mean?” Peter shrugged and very obviously didn’t look at him. Did he-
“Oh, Happy told me about her I think. She sounds great.” Tony smiled down at his daughter, who was now almost asleep in his arms.
“But I- I have to do
“This is perfect, thank you so much, Tony.”
They were silent for a while, watching Steve and Morgan play.
Bucky and Steve decided to watch a movie after dinner, but Peter seemed to restless for sitting around on the couch, so Tony asked him, if he wanted to go for a walk. He had other motives as well, of course. He had found that walks, just as long car rides were a great possibility to talk, because there was always the option of looking at the scenery, if looking at the other person was too difficult or anything like that. Peter seemed very much in favor of that idea.
“I have to try. I can’t just-“ He shook his head. “I have to try.”
“Asexuality. That’s a sexual orientation, with- well, it describes the lack of sexual attraction, which does not mean that one might not fall in love or be in a relationship. It just means that you might not feel sexual attraction towards your partner. Or partners.”
“It’s worth a try. I’ll call Clint to ask him, okay?”
“Oh my god!” By now, both Bucky and Sam had the most shit-eating grins on their faces, Morgan was demanding to know what was going on (which Pepper answered with “they’re just being bad at communicating, sweetie”; thanks Pepper).
“You can borrow some of mine,” he said, as if that was reasonable. As if Bucky didn’t have his own clothes just in the next room. But Steve still didn’t let go, obviously determined to keep his lovers as close as possible. Tony gave Bucky a look, trying to figure out what he wanted. Just because the man was calmer now, more comfortable around them, didn’t mean that he would feel comfortable getting changed in front of Steve and Tony. But apparently, this was not a concern. Bucky shrugged, gave Tony a small smiled and took his shirt off. Okay, not a problem, then.
They did in fact spend the next hour on the couch, eating cookies and watching Steve Irwin documentaries. At some point, Morgan joined them, apparently not bothered at all by the teenager sitting on their couch. Maybe Happy had told her about him. Or maybe she just didn’t care. Tony smiled when she sat down next to Peter, looked at him for a moment and then declared:
Tony closed his eyes shutting what little light there was out. He could feel a single tear rolling down his face, didn’t try to stop it. Soft fingers brushed it away, then Steve pressed a kiss to his cheek.
They sat down on the couch, because all Tony needed to begin with was to just look at it and maybe have FRIDAY scan it. Bucky seemed pretty relaxed, sitting down next to him and offering the arm as if it was normal. As if Tony didn’t know for a fact that not even Steve was really allowed to touch it most days. As if- Well, on some days, Tony was still working on believing he deserved good things, or love, or trust. It seemed like tonight might be going in that direction. He shrugged it off. He could freak out later, but right now Bucky needed him to focus.
“It was either coming here or going to Clint’s first. And well-“ She broke off, looking at Steve.
“What is it, then?” Tony asked. He knew he shouldn’t push, but Bucky was clearly hurting and that was not okay. He was not willing to watch the people he loved being in pain, not anymore. Not if there was anything he could do to change it.
“Daddy! We’re baking, daddy,” Morgan said, before she ran over to him, demanding to be picked up. He was sure he was gonna end up with frosting on his clothes but eh, whatever.
“No I- I’m at home, I- it’s good to hear you, Mister Stark.”
Tony frowned. “They- Pep, that makes no sense.” Pepper laughed, short and dry, before nodding.
“I-“ Barnes obviously hesitated, then looked at Sam, who just gave him a look.
“Pep,” he murmured again, staring at her with what had to be stars in his eyes. God, it was so good to see her. “It’s so good to see you,” he said, just because he could. She smiled at him and leaned down, pressing a soft kiss on his forehead, then on his lips.
“We don’t trade lives,” he whispered, almost choking on the words. He knew that Steve had said that, to Vision, years ago. He also knew it hadn’t mattered, in the end. The only link that he might have still had to JARVIS had been dead, destroyed.
“Oh hey, no. No, that wasn’t the one implanted in my chest, I took it out years before that happened. It’s fine.”
“Were you brainwashed, too?” Clint shrugged.
Morgan was sitting on Pepper’s lap, grinning up at her father when they came into the kitchen. There was food, pasta with tomato sauce, easy stuff, but good, filling. Tony pushed Steve into a chair, while Bucky was already filling bowls for them, giving Tony a very shy smile when he passed them over. He put one down in front of Steve, the other one next to him and then went and pulled Natasha into a hug.
“I’m not gonna force you, if you don’t want, but… please?”
As expected, Bucky stared at him with wide eyes, like Morgan did when she was caught with her hand right in the cookie jar. It could have been almost comical, if it wasn’t so sad that Bucky was still expecting the worse, was still almost breathlessly waiting for the moment the pushed him out of their bed. So yeah, they needed this conversation.
“I forgive you,” he said, simple as that. He had more to say, someday, not now. More conversations to be had, more old hurts to be soothed, but right now, this was it. This was the only thing that really mattered. And the way Steve sagged down, tears falling from his eyes and the smile back again, grateful and soft, if a little surprised, as if Tony’s answer had caught Steve off guard. He pressed his forehead to their joint hands for a moment, took a deep breath. His eyes were still wet when he looked up again, but the tears were not falling anymore.
“Right, okay. Fine.” He rolled his eyes but couldn’t help grinning when they all cheered. Even Bucky, though much quieter than Steve and Morgan.
“Nebula, meet FRIDAY. FRIDAY, meet Nebula.” He pointed at the ceiling, not because that was where FRIDAY was (of course not, no matter what Steve said), but because that was where her voice was coming from. “FRIDAY is an AI, an artificial intelligence. She doesn’t have a body, she’s mostly just a string of code. And she’s my daughter.”
That must have been all of the adult talk that Morgan could stand, because she began to squirm in Rhodey’s arms, reaching out towards Tony. Who wanted nothing more than to reach back, but no matter how not-dead he felt, he was still too weak for that. But Rhodey must have realized what he wanted, because he helped Morgan get up on the bed, where she immediately curled up against Tony, tiny little hands clasped tight around his shirt.
“How does it feel? Usually?”
He sat there for a moment, phone in hand, thinking. After a while, Morgan came outside and climbed on his lap.
“Hm?”
“I’m not sad.”
“Yeah, everyone’s fine. MJ and Ned are a pain in my-“ He broke off and there was a sound, as if he had just slapped his hand in front of his mouth. Tony laughed.
So this is how he ended up sitting on a beach towel in the sun, watching his daughter playing and running around with Steve. Bucky mostly sat next to him, apparently content to watch them as well.
Hi! I'm still here. Sorry for the delay, I was in Paris last week and I kinda couldn't find the time to post... You'll get two chapters today and then we're back with the usual one chapter per day from tomorrow on. Happy reading :)
“Would it still be okay if I kiss you some more?”
Aaaallllll the fluff and cuddles!
“Okay, so we’re definitely not deciding anything right now and you take as much time as you need. I can give you stuff to read, if you’d like.” Bucky nodded.
“You want a shirt?” he asked, but Bucky shook his head. He was wearing Steve’s sweatpants and the prosthetic was gleaming softly in the low light of the bedroom. Tony turned, looked at Steve who had been watching them for a while now. They smiled at each other and Tony shook his head, just a bit, at the question in Steve’s eyes. That was for later, right now, he just wanted to make sure they were all safe.
“Careful, Morgan, your daddy’s only just woke up.” Then he looked at Tony, eyes bright and shiny. “Hey Tones. How do you feel?”
“Oh. Is he coming to visit?” Tony smiled, nodding. Steve smiled back.
“Mhm. I- I’m kinda aquaphobic.”
“Steve?”
“Tony, you’re married,” Steve said, as if that was the most important thing. But then again, maybe it was. Although Tony had always been very open about the kind of relationship they had, he had thought Steve knew.
“Goodbye? Why would he- Is he not coming back?” Tony took a sip of coffee, leaned back against the headboard and held out a hand for her.
“Yeah, I know. None of it makes sense, but you’re here and- well, it looks like we’ve got our second chance, doesn’t it?”
“Who is it? Is it someone fun?” Tony asked, already getting up and stretching. He was not made for sitting over a project for hours at a time. Rhodey grinned.
“Should I be worried?” Peter wanted to know. Rhodey shook his head.
“It’s fine, kid. As long as you don’t say that in front of Morgan, everything’s fine.”
Steve was blushing. Why was Steve blushing?
“I don’t need to drink.” Yeah. This was exactly the problem.
Steve was still looking at him with wide eyes and Tony got the sinking feeling that yes, that was exactly what he had thought. But then he shook his head, sitting up a bit more (and fuck, they definitely needed to take care of those ribs, that did not look healthy).
“Tony-“
“I’m fine, if that’s what you’re asking. I’ve recovered pretty well, way better than I ever expected, to be honest. It’s- it’s nice. Steve and Bucky are around pretty often, and the rest of the new Avengers come to visit us from time to time, too. You should come. There’s- there’s always a place for you here, Peter, I hope you know that. I realize I didn’t- I should have told you. Should have called you sooner. I wasn’t sure if you- well, I wasn’t sure.”
“Did you ever try hot chocolate?” he asked. She shook her head. He spent the next couple of minutes thinking about what he wanted to say. He wasn’t sure if Nebula would understand him, would understand the concept of a found family, but he had to try. She deserved a loving family, more than anybody else.
“Bucky.”
“You’re very welcome, Peter. I’m looking forward to seeing you, okay?”
“You were on your way to bed.” Not a question.
Eventually, the kids got bored of their game and decided that they wanted to watch a movie. Morgan demanded Disney and she was immediately supported by Peter. Nebula didn’t know what Disney movies were, but she seemed to be in favor of everything her siblings wanted, so Disney it was.
“Tony-“ she whispered. He smiled at her. It would be worth it, even if-
“Thank you, Tony. Really, I-“ But Tony only shook his head, taking the body wash and a washcloth in hand. They could talk later, they could even apologize again later, but right now he just wanted to enjoy the moment.
“I- Because I wanted to. Because you might not come back and I hate missing chances, even after everything that happened and… I don’t know, I just wanted to, I guess.” Steve nodded, face still serious and calm. Unreadable in a way, which did not make the whole situation any easier.
She snuggled into his arms, clearly intending to stay for a while. Maybe that was what he needed, a bit of moral support.
“Your daughter?” Her voice was disbelieving, which only made Tony sadder. “But she’s not- human. She’s not alive.” Tony sighed, then pushed her cup of hot chocolate closer to her.
“I don’t know. It’s not exactly the same experience, magic and brainwashing.” Tony shrugged.
“Third. I- I already got my second chance, with you, with Morgan. I-“ She smiled at him, all soft and full of love, even though her eyes were kinda sad, too.
“You know I still love her, too, right? I’m not gonna stop being with her.”
“What is positive in a story about a girl whose family is horrible to her?” Nebula asked about halfway into the movie. Peter shook his head, a faint blush visible on his cheeks.
“Hey, can I let you soak here for a moment while I go check on Morgan?” he asked after a moment. He was pretty sure Steve wasn’t going to drown, with his head on the little pillow, stretched out in the big tub. Steve gave him a soft and lazy smile.
This is a fill for A5 "wolf" :)
“Well, steal him back of course,” she said with a smile.
“No. No we don’t trade lives, you’re right. But Tony, you have to understand that I have to try, at least. Don’t you?” And that was just it. Because he did understand, of course he did. He knew Steve, after all. So, he nodded, even if he wished to could just shake his head and pull Steve closer, pull him away from all danger and into his arms. He knew that Steve would come, willingly. But Pepper was right, neither of them could rest at night, knowing that they hadn’t tried everything that they could possibly thing of.
“I’ll see what I can find,” he said and then left the bathroom. Steve’s clothes were all over the bedroom floor and probably needed to be burned. Or at least washed, but there was no way he was gonna be able to wear those again anytime soon. Tony added searching for clothes to his mental to do list and then went to look for his daughter.
“Hey. How are you?” Tony asked softly. Rhodey smiled.
And there was nothing else that Tony could say to that except: “Yes.”
“Okay perfect. Can I talk to you for a second, Bucky?” That had him sending an almost panicked look in Sam’s direction, but he didn’t protest. He set down the bowl of frosting he was holding while Tony passed Morgan over to Sam and then followed him outside on the porch.
It was Steve who found them, half an hour later, still sitting there, phone in hand. The screen had long gone dark, but he was still kinda staring at it.
So yeah, working with Peter felt very similar to how he had felt all those years ago. But it was also very different. Not only were they not in an underground workshop in a fancy house in Malibu. They spent most of the time right here, in the living room, playing around with holograms and FRIDAY. They would of course move to production trials very soon (which meant moving over to the garage, which was still something that made Tony laugh), but for now, they were content with research and hypothetical trails.
“Hey, everything alright?” Bucky nodded and took one of the cups in his hand.
“We’ll talk about it, okay? When I come back.” Tony nodded. If, he thought to himself, but didn’t say it. For now, they still had time.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said, which was very obviously not what the man had expected. Which made it all the more important. “I’m sorry for what happened in Siberia, for attacking you. I’m sorry for accusing you as well, and for the fact that I didn’t help you when I could have.”
Tony took a deep breath, nodded. “Yeah, I know. I know, Steve.” He reached out his hand and smiled when Steve took it, as if it was the most natural, obvious thing to do. Maybe it was. Maybe they just should have reached out sooner. “And yeah, I’d like that. Friends, I- I’d really like that.”
“What?” Tony said, confused. Steve blushed some more, then ducked his head.
“I don’t think either of us should be alone right now.”
Bucky nodded. Tony hesitated for a moment, weirdly reminded of the night before. They sat here just like now, in silence. He wasn’t sure what to say, wasn’t even sure if there was anything at all that he could say. To make this better, easier somehow, even though he didn’t really know what
“Yeah, cuddles now,” Bucky mumbled against Tony’s chest, sighing contently when Steve draped himself over his back.
“How are you feeling, Tones,” Rhodey asked, as he sat down next to him. Tony smiled at him, suddenly desperately grateful to be here, with his family.
Steve was alone. No Barnes, no Wilson, just him. He looked- good. Calmer, as if he’d had a good night’s sleep and a couple of good meals, more settled. And he was smiling, which definitely was a big improvement to the last time he’d come here.
“Are you sad, daddy?” He frowned.
“Well, she’s not as murderous as she used to be, so I guess you could almost classify her as fun,” he said. Tony frowned. Did he know murderous people? Apart from Natasha, of course, but she didn’t really count as a guest anymore.
“Yeah.”
He stood there for a while, in the dark. Not really thinking about anything, just feeling. Eventually he went inside. They had cleared the table together, but the dished were still in the sink, waiting to be washed. He hesitated, stared at them for a moment and then decided that he didn’t have the energy to do them now. And besides, he wanted the reminder. To know It was real, even if it could only ever be one date. To know that Steve had been here, that they had laughed about Morgan being a sneaky little kid, finding ways to get ice cream in the middle of the night. To know that they had sat on the couch, making out, soft and unhurried. If Steve didn’t come back, he wanted, he needed those memories. If they were all he could have.
“No. Tony, no. I understand that you forgive us, and I’m incredibly thankful for that, if not for myself then for Steve. But… please don’t say it was fine. It was wrong, it should not have happened and if Steve knew that, if he knew what the arc reactor meant-“ He broke off. His right hand was shaking, while the left one was still lying in Tony’s lap, soft and pliant.
“I’m in possession of a phone, yes Steve,” he deadpanned. Oh, would you look at that, even more blushing. Bucky was laying all over the table by now, laughing. “I’m surrounded by a bunch of idiots.”
It was dark outside when Steve left. They were standing on the porch together, underneath a sky full of stars. It was weird to look up and not feeling scared anymore. After everything that happened, he could finally enjoy their beauty again. Still, he was mainly looking at Steve. They were holding hands and Tony could feel him controlling his strength, clutching his hand without hurting him.
“I fought my way out of that cave, years and years ago. The arc reactor saved my life, but after that- They wanted me to build weapons and I refused. I don’t- I build the first armor instead. Clunky thing, could hardly even move or see where I was going. Didn’t have many weapons either. Flamethrowers, mainly. I remember, standing in the entrance of that cave, looking outside, seeing all those weapons that I had made and that had found their way into the hands of terrorists. I burned them all, everything. Then I flew away. I-“ He paused, took a deep breath. Bucky was staring at him with wonder in his eyes, as it this whole thing was something to admire. Tony sighed. “The arc reactor isn’t what makes me Iron Man. Yes, Steve destroying it sucked, but he didn’t- he didn’t destroy Iron Man, not really. He could never have done that. And he didn’t kill me. He could have, but he didn’t.”
“And then?” he could help asking. Bucky smiled, a small and fragile thing.
