I was surprised, yet glad Watson hadn't jumped at the opportunity to defend my status. It allowed me to do so myself.
His thin lips were slightly parted, so as to allow the passage of air. The closed lids quivered slightly, and, although I could not see them, I was aware of the thin purple veins covering them like intricate ornaments. Marvelous, how so strong and remarkable a man could look so delicate.
Admittedly, he had always struck me as rather unlikable, and a little too sure of himself; both traits which are certain to produce a confession in some way or another. Arrogance can be intimidating, after all. He was clearly trying to produce the same effect on me. A fact which was very suggestive, if not alarming.
At last, I was able to insert myself back into the conversation before Watson was could grab his coat and pay another, less professional visit to the Marquess.
I made my rounds asking other guests whether anyone had seen anything out of the ordinary- or if anyone had spotted a woman at all.
“Well, I believe she is the daughter of some local country squire. Undoubtedly, she is on her way to Paris to seek entertainment fit for a lady of her standing.”
"If the evening progresses like this, it will no doubt be a successful party." White said with uncertainty.
“Very well. I understand this kind of social gathering is nothing for you. I will burn the letters from the ladies, and let Mr. Trevor know we will not attend his party.”
A murmur went through the crowd, as a man entered the room. Although he was short and of feminine build, Sir Thomas Peacock positively radiated with flamboyant energy. His entrance would best be compared to an actor walking on stage at the beginning of the first act. His dress only added to it, for he had chosen to sport the attire of an 18th century nobleman, and he did it in a way which would have been certain to make Mozart blush.
I averse of the idea of gaining my information by causing harm- it is a tactic reserved for the official police- however, I am equally aware that desperate times require desperate means. I had exhausted every other way of opening the chest, yet he still refused. Now I had no choice but to fall back on my last resort: Blackmail.
The day of our departure was overcast and melancholy, much like Holmes' mood. The moment I woke him in the morning I could see his health had relapsed slightly. Apparently, he had spent the night tossing and tuning in bed. It didn't take much imagination to understand he had been haunted by how narrowly he had avoided colossal failure.
He closed his eyes with the same  satisfied expression of absolute relaxation he only showed when we were attending his favourite concerts. Was it the effect I had on him? I hardly dared hope so, but then again, we had not seen each other in almost eight weeks.
“You have got me there.” he admitted humorously. “Well, we shall see soon enough which- and how many faithful friends shall keep me company in my retirement.”
I rather think he simply enjoyed himself, and revelled in the excitement with which his unique skills were received- even if it was only a game of Forfeits.
He smiled, and declined with a jovial wave of his hand. "Pah, we have all of tomorrow to dwell on old times." Stepping back he continued. "Now, gentlemen, let me introduce you to Mr. Elias White. The public knows him as my valet, but really, he is my better half."
I had no intention of reacting to this show of self-pity. “My dear Reverend...I notice that you are a chess-lover...I trust you will excuse me, but I can never resist the appeal of an unfinished game.”
I stooped to pick it up with shaking hands. An invisible barrier had appeared between myself and Holmes' door. I reminded myself I could take as long as I needed, which seemed to ease my agitation. Nonetheless, reaching out for the knob again cost me all that was left of my strength.
I hardly know what I expected after all I had learned about him- but it had never occurred to me to find the graveyard completely deserted. None of his self-proclaimed "admirers" had come to bid him adieu. Neither had those who owed their lives and careers to my friend- nor his enemies. Such was the state of his reputation.
“Since you always marvel at my methods, I thought it might be entertaining to help you acquire them for yourself.”
I could not bear the thought of food. My heart and stomach were still weighing too heavily on my disposition.
Despite this little incident, and my presence in a professional position, our stay proved to be a lovely holiday, filled with a number of blissful moments similar to those recounted above. We took walks together, as soon as Holmes felt strong enough to leave the room the next day, and even went out for dinner to a small but excellent restaurant. We basked in the sun and played chess in the park adjoining the hotel.
My nose was pressed against his back, allowing his scent to pour into my consciousness. After all these years, I still find it hard to describe it. Perhaps the idea of walking down a street around Christmas, where a Barber's, a bookshop, a chemist, and a Pub are located next to each other, would best describe it. There was, of course, the eternal odor of tobacco, which characterizes most men, as well as smoke from wood- and coal fires- then there was a hint of sweat (for which I suppose I am to blame), something akin to paper, the faintest ghost of expensive eau de toilette, and a hint of acid or some other chemical.
What little had been left of my patience evaporated at once. My eyes narrowed at his childish defiance. He wanted the police, so he should have them- but not before I had finished my investigation.
“Anything of interest?” Holmes asked. Clearly I was not the only one to hope for some change in the deadly boredom of our days.
"Quite understandable." Holmes nodded. "What puzzles me, however, is why you would agree to host such a large event when you have only just settled in."
I was delighted at the offer, as it spoke of the trust he put in me. I sometimes tried to imagine what this great brain of his might produce when unleashed during the night. Eventually, I had reached the conclusion that he must be one of those men who do not dream; that he simply shuts down at night, like a vampire in his coffin.
He would never turn around to greet me, but I could read quiet joy in the smile reflected in the glass. My eyes went searching for those of his mirror-image, wondering, part of me even hoping he might do the same.
I lifted my head. His black moods worried me, especially now I myself was not in prime condition. It meant I might not be able to shield him from the infernal temptation of the cocaine bottle.
"Ah, Mr. Holmes...how did you know I was here?" The sentence resembled an actor who possessed the emotional range of a log of firewood.
The woman lifted her head to reveal an even ghastlier sight, for that white makeup which marks the Italian harlequin, had been distorted by a long stream of tears. Some dust clung to the white-and-black paste covering her face, tinting parts of it a dirty grey.
My eyes scanned the area for anything of importance I might have missed, and detected a severed finger on the floor, next to the chair where the Bishop was tied up. A rather strange discovery, given the fact the victim, despite all of his wounds, still possessed all ten of his. I took it before the Reverend could notice and start protesting again.
It only intensified my dreams that night, as my hapless brain attempted to answer impossible questions. Nothing made sense from the very start! How did the mysterious theft of the Samoan necklace lead to Holmes committing murder and suicide? What had he hoped to gain by releasing one of England's most dangerous criminals from prison?
It was true that we had not yet had the fortune of spending an entire night together- a fact which has since changed by the time I am putting this short account to paper.
There was a moment's silence before Holmes spoke again. "That will do, thank you..." he then turned to face Sir Thomas. "As it is in our best interest to keep what happened quiet, and those two men, are unlikely to turn to crime again, I would suggest a milder punishment. Perhaps in the shape of a journey to America aboard a transport ship full of tea?"
"That I cannot tell you, but we shall soon find out. The Bishop is afraid of something, therefore it must be important."
Before I could ask what those golden particles were, the fabric and its contents disappeared in one of his vest-pockets, and he continued his search.
I even applied Holmes' favourite approach of directly asking the men whom they suspected. Needless to say, it did not yield any great success.
My work is often met with sensation-seeking scepticism, especially within the realms of tabloid papers, which increases exponentially as my name becomes more widely known. I therefore chose not to pay any mind to the subject, and made no attempt at hiding this sentiment. Like so often, the good doctor had managed to get himself worked up over something so trivial as my reputation.
Naturally, I was not solely attracted to his character. There was a more basic, physical aspect to it. He wore his favourite grey suit that day. Which was, as it happens, my favourite as well. Its perfectly tailored cut complimented Holmes' lean frame, making him appear even more elegant than usual.
Relief washed over me, once I was done with my routine, and I placed a loving hand on his chest. “Thank God it is nothing serious. You should be quite yourself again in a few days...” I paused and looked sternly into his eyes. “...provided you eat enough and take proper rest, that is.”
I obeyed. As soon as I had claimed my spot, Holmes sprawled out lengthwise on the sofa, with his head rested firmly in my lap.
And then, at long last, after having sifted through the ashes in the fireplace, Holmes raised his voice.
Without taking my eyes off of the policeman, I continued a little more sharply than I had truly intended, "You may accompany me, Watson, if you care to do so."
"This is nothing but a vulgar copy." I concluded. "And at a glance it would appear that the forger has intended for it to be seen as such."
Holmes looked around, seemingly taking in every detail. He then proceeded to move one of the chairs, and examine the polished wooden surface of the dining table. Once he had satisfied himself of whatever needed proving- or disproving, my friend looked closely at every single one of the baroque candlesticks which were placed around the room.
"Hiding something." Continued Holmes. "You ran upstairs to prevent anyone from going downstairs. By appearing at the scene when you did, you ascertained that you would be asked to help. You knew nothing about her presence, which means you were entirely honest when you told us about the strange person dressed as a harlquin and "making eyes at Sir Thomas", as you put it, Parker. She had nothing to do with your deed, so you saw no reason in holding it back. However, you did not split to search the house as you said you would- or you did, but only very briefly. Your first mistake was to tell me you had started your search in the attic, when there were no footsteps matching your boots atop the stairs, Willis. Instead, you went to the dining room, where you planned to resume the real coup: which was to steal from Sir Thomas."
Well...I suppose I am doing him an injustice. The more I got to know the great detective, the more he revealed himself to me. We had hardly been together a year then. Both of us have changed- though I am confident to say- mostly for the better. Now we are approaching "middle-age", and the last remnants of youth give way to the first signs of age, we begin to settle down. Even Holmes' once endless resources begin to show signs of slowing; which I, who has had my share of adventure long ago, can only appreciate.
I removed the rug, and found a corresponding stain on the floor by the desk. The rest was child's play. The cloth had been used to hide a large chess piece- a knight, to be exact. The checkered tiles lent themselves perfectly to be used as a board. A square of 5x5 tiles had been outlined with charcoal. It was just large enough to be covered entirely by the rug.
I smiled and turned around. Holmes was still asleep. He had turned his back on me. Carefully, I wrapped an arm around him, trying my hardest not to wake him. Although his skin was warm, I was certain his hands and feet were freezing cold. They almost always were, and it was nearly impossible to find a remedy.
A new set of tears was streaming down her cheeks when she lifted her head to look her husband in the eye. She had resumed something of her natural grace, now she was sat in the comfort of a sofa.
Therefore, I settled with placing my hands where it was most comfortable- my right gently playing with his hair, and my left quietly resting on his chest.
Just as he said it, the crowd parted, and Sir Thomas entered our little circle. He bowed, according to his costume.
“Good. The fourth and final pair, however, appears rather out of place. While they too are size 9, they are of a better quality and certainly too expensive for our killers. If you take a look at the direction of those prints, you will notice, that the smaller hobnail boots entered but did not leave. The expensive pair, however, left without having entered. Now, what do you make of that?”
Holmes' voice echoed in my mind, giving a disgruntled sigh followed by a brief but ever so polite "Would you please put this book away for me, Watson? There's a good fellow."
“That aside, I must answer the other question you put to me earlier: After I fainted for the third time within two days, the concierge had me brought up to my room, and sent for a medic. I cannot fault him, as I was certain I would not see another day, but still refused. I knew that...I knew that your absence was as much part of my demise as that of sleep.” He had hesitated, which was quite out of character. “It might be for the same reason I say those things now, but you did ask. So, I would not have anyone else until they agreed to wire to London.”
Sir Thomas was the first to see reason. "Given Mr. Holmes' countless successes, I see no harm in listening to him. Hayes, you will take over Parker's duties until he has recovered."
None of us had taken note of Parker's arrival. Only when someone- presumably White- exclaimed, "Watch out, he's going to faint!"
Lady Peacock gently shook her head. "No, I need to confess my own sins, Mr. Holmes. You see, I never intended to cause any harm but...." a loud, ugly sob shook her body, "I killed that man Huntley! That awful, awful man!"
Should I yield to my instincts and stroke his handsome head? Should I simply place a hand on his chest? Or perhaps both? No, that would be too much. He must have expected me to touch him, otherwise he would not have sought my company. Besides, I could not miss the opportunity to freely express my own affections.
I admit that the change caused me great joy, though I knew- and, was in fact glad, it was only temporary. It was not his real character after all. He was of a much more inward nature by default, only allowing others to see what he wanted them to, while perfectly concealing any internal processes that would put him at a disadvantage.
"Not that I know of, Mr. Holmes, sir. I let in the guests, and when everyone's arrived, I locked the door and went to help out with the drinks as per my instructions."
"But why go to my wife? She has nothing to do with the whole matter! And why would he want to sabotage my marriage?"
This particularly amused Trevor, for he laughed loudly and exclaimed. "Goodness, Holmes! My late Dad would roll over in his grave!"
I then turned my attention to the footprints near the exit. Luckily I could stop my colleague from trampling right over them.
“I know, I read of your exploits in the papers. You are one of the most celebrated men in Europe at the moment.”
"You must promise me that you will believe every word I tell you. I only came here to convince myself of the truth- and to talk to you. All I did, I did to save face- yours as well as my own."
“It hardly matters when I am bound to the bed like that,” he shrugged lightly, but I knew he enjoyed the praise. “But perhaps it is as well. At least I am certain never to suffer from boredom again within the next decade.”
“No, Watson, the man was executed by a group of workers. He was a member of the District Council of Poplar. The suicide theory is merely a ploy put in place by the police to keep the public under control.” He let himself fall back into his armchair with a gesture of indifference. “A pretty mess they made of it, Watson...allowing their secret to surface in the papers. I wonder if Mycroft knows...Well, I suppose it can't be helped. Perhaps it is for the best....”
"No, Martha...but, I must be honest with you...there have been some... Huntley was quite right. I often hosted these events to give men of...well..of my sort a chance to be free- if only for an evening. And I did enjoy my share of intimacy."
Inspired by these rare words of praise, I did my best to connect what I had observed with what I had learned from six years in Holmes' company.
My friend chuckled in his silent, inward fashion. "I can hardly fault you, dear fellow. I admit, it almost slipped my mind as well, had I not found the invitation during the hunt for a certain file."
"I'll try, sir- but there really isn't much to tell. I was looking for anyone who shouldn't be here, but didn't encounter no one- until I came down to the kitchen and found him lying there- god rest his soul. That's when I ran to tell Sir Thomas."
He proceeded to take our hats and coats, and guided us into the sitting room, where he announced our presence.
We had to change in Paris, in order to catch the last train to Calais. It was a little past ten when we alighted. I felt rather drowsy, as it had been my turn to sleep for the past hour or so of our journey. I only awoke to Holmes touching me lightly on the shoulder. Another six hours were spent on a train before we reached Calais, whence a ferry would take us back to British soil.
As I started to unwrap the ominous costume, brown paper gave way to, what appeared to be red silk and velvet, delicately embroidered with golden thread.
I had only been able to put the rug back where it belonged when two sets of familiar footsteps echoed down the corridor once again.
Nothing of particular interest happened that day, except for the fact that we did venture out into the cold, much to Holmes' dismay.
"Of course." the businessman replied humbly. "Well, perhaps then you'd consider sharing some of your cases tonight. It is all hallow's eve after all, and a few of your more gruesome stories would be the high point of this party."
"I would very much like to finish my story, if you don't mind, gentlemen...Where was I...? The costume- of course. I...I had a costume made, which was certain to disguise my features- and anything the suit could not hide, my corset and makeup certainly would. Anxiously, and with a heavy heart, I waited until the 31st. I considered returning home- to somehow pay that dreadful man, and never think about it again. But then I realised that he might ask for more- again, and again- bringing certain ruin upon us. So I dressed up, took my invitation, and attended the party." she paused again to breathe. "Well...after I confirmed what I feared most, I went to seek the man out who was holding me on a leash like a pet dog. When I saw him...with his air of superiority, and that satisfied grin on his face, something took hold of me. I never meant to harm him- I don't believe I really understood we were standing at the top of the stairs- I simply pushed him...and he fell...only when he lay dead at the bottom of the staircase, bleeding, did I grasp what it was I had done. I screamed in horror, and ran away. I had hardly reached the front door, when I heard footsteps nearing me. I hid in the cabinet, intending to wait until everything had calmed down before finding a way out of the house...Which I did- but rather than outside, I found myself locked in the cellar." It must have cost lady Peacock considerable strength to restrain her emotions.
To my great surprise his expression changed in an instant, now speaking of tenderness. "You are right. I have given you my soul long ago."
"...and you deceived me all along. Damn you! I wish I had seen through all of your lies! But now...it is over. It is all over."
I chuckled quietly. Although his idea of humour was strange (as he was aware of, and even said himself on several occasions), I could not help but appreciate it.
His eyes followed me as I closed the curtains and lit a candle, and I put myself in his shoes, or rather- put him in mine. I pictured what he saw and put him in my stead- his slender frame vaguely outlined underneath the coarse fabric of his nightshirt against the light of the candle.
Like a caged tiger, Holmes too would invariably fall into the blackest depression, when taken out of his natural habitat.
“See? I was telling the truth!” he blurted out. “That is quite enough. This time you won't stop me!”
My companion quietly acknowledged the information before continuing. "How are the staff doing now? Have the tensions resolved?"
I took the liberty of watching him for some time, for it was rare to see him in such a state of absolute peace.
"Not to worry, doctor." Trevor confirmed. "This goes for you too, White. I am not spreading any rumours, and nothing has happened. But I would be surprised if you hadn't noticed the tension among them. You could cut it with a knife!"
"I would very much like to witness your work in person someday- see what is true, and what has been embellished for the narrative's sake."
Of course, I had turned my head to meet his gaze. The genuine concern for my wellbeing was impossible to ignore.
“Well done, Watson! You are getting better and better. But, there are a few errors in your chain of reasoning I feel compelled to correct, if you are to learn from your mistakes.”
The woman in question was seated right behind Holmes, facing in my direction. I could only guess how he knew about her presence, considering she arrived a good while after us.
The discussion slowed down over our meal, which was, I suspect, when his natural curiosity got the better of my companion. "I could not help but note the formidable assortment of boys which makes up your staff. Quite unusual, I must admit."
The October of 1887 had been a particularly trying month- not merely for me (my old wound was constantly plaguing me on account of the weather; making me rather unpleasant company), or Holmes, who struggled to find sufficiently intriguing cases, but for the entirety of the United Kingdom, as the tension which had been building for the past 20 years or so, due to the ever-growing divide between man and politics, slowly became tangible.
His eyes darted in my direction. Confusion was clearly written across his face. “So? What do you want now?”
"Again, it is one of the reasons." He grinned at his little, private joke. "Since those who avail themselves of my services like to compare me to a magician, I could not deny the irony in turning into one for an evening."
"Welcome, gentlemen! I'm delighted to see so many of you decided to flock to this old house one final time. After all, they don't say the more the merrier for no reason, eh? Don't forget that you are among friends, so there is no need to hide. Not tonight. Other than that, I can only ask you to enjoy yourselves and celebrate until the early hours of the morning! Thank you!"
The stone had covered several letters. Terribly fanciful love letters from a woman to the cleric. Most of them mentioned marriage and children. This was vital knowledge.
We were again caught in one of our little games. One could it say it was our way of narrowly avoiding conflict.
"No! I can't go on lying, Willis! Don't you see they found us out?! None of this would have happened if you'd been honest!"
My friend said nothing in return. I had hurt him. My heart sank at the sight. He made me feel vulnerable, and I detested the idea.
Every second, from the moment he placed the cigarette between my lips, to my first drag before he let go offered much-needed relief. He knew nothing of my disposition. Perhaps it was for the better.
"Oh really, Victor. There's no need to spread rumours. The poor lads have enough on their minds as it is."
“That is fortunate! I will send a reply at once!” Holmes migrated to his desk, where he jotted down a quick telegram, as was his custom.
“The window, my dear boy! We were passing through a tunnel when she entered, allowing me to watch her occupy the space behind me. Now, shall we?”
"Now, Watson." my friend said proudly, with a hint of uncharacteristic nervousness. "The time has come to reveal your costume. I commend your patience, and thank you for it."
Needless to say I was utterly perplexed. Although we were nearing our anniversary as “intimate companions”, I still considered him as an isolated phenomenon with neither kif nor kin- nor close friend for that matter.
"Dear me, Watson!" he laughed, and flung himself down on a sofa, once the game was over, and we had joined Trevor and White in the music room.
Given the state of affairs I should have known I was going to be the one looking down the barrel of a gun instead.
Another thing which is not often granted to those of the invert-variety, are quiet mornings in bed. In most cases those mornings, if they take place at all, are cut short by housekeepers, maids, or worse still- clients. Not so there, as every inhabitant of the house was the same way inclined.
"Yes, but you did so some time after you were sent to look for her, since you told me you started your search at the top of the house. Most likely, we have you to thank that she is still here at all. So let us go see her."
"It is unnecessary. Such allegations collapse on their own- like one of Mrs. Hudson's soufflés. Let us leave the police to solve this problem and turn our attention to the matters in hand." I hoped to convey my disinterest and impatience.
“With the help of the maid, who was also kind enough to provide me with this small meal. I was craving some fresh air.”
"Do whatever is necessary to avert a scandal. I beg you." he dashed down the stairs towards the entrance, calling out for the Butler. He received no response, except for some frantic footsteps and a door opening.
The soul-crushing emptiness of our living room caught me off-guard once more. His ghost seemed to idle between the window and table. A shiver ran down my spine.
“Much better, thank you. You rather saved me from a strange dream, you know. An unpleasant affair, Watson. Unpleasant indeed. But I shall spare you its macabre details.”
There was no alternative. I had to get to my feet and make my way over to the bed once more, hoping the soft carpet beneath my feet would swallow the sound of my steps. Luckily, he did not so much as stir when I knelt down by his side.
"Willis took one of the candle sticks and finished the job. But Parker is known to faint at the sight of blood, so you agreed to send him back in- for one so you could avert suspicion, but also to keep him from fainting."
As soon as we had parted Holmes brought his cheek to mine, and muttered, “Good night, my dear fellow...”
"They were evidently unworthy children, Reverend. Now do please try to calm yourself and focus, because we will need your assistance. Do you have any idea as to the motive behind this?"
"Now that you know the truth, gentlemen, I would very much like to know what you intend to do with me?"
"Well...we could not say for certain. We have only been here for about three weeks, and haven't any reason to complain so far, but..."
The first three minutes of our journey were uncomfortable at best. I was aware there was something on Watson's mind, but uncertain whether to address it or to wait if he would do so by himself.
"Sir Thomas! Sir Thomas!" Willis, the footman pushed his way through to us. "Something terrible's happened!"
"Abracadabra!" he exclaimed, waving some sort of crooked, wooden wand. The whole outfit somehow made him appear even more elegant and authoritative than usual.
“How lovely! I wish you both a pleasant evening!” I chimed. “Might I ask how you came by such a splendid opportunity?”
"And I am trying to do my work. How often must I say that I am running late for an appointment before being listened to?"
"Well, Watson?" Holmes said cheerfully, as he stood by the fire, lighting a cigarette. He was still fuelled by the euphoria of a job well done. "Have you decided on a costume yet?"
In an instant, Sir Thomas, White, and even Willis were by the boy's side. The latter attempting to hoist him to his feet while growling "Parker, you idiot..."
“No indeed, Holmes. I didn't come all this way and worried myself half to death only to be subject to your masterful nature.” Although I was effectively reprimanding him like a naughty boy, my tone was still gentle. I was too relieved and too glad to finally be near him again to be harsh.
My friend shook his head. "What is to be learned about a person from looking at their choice of costume. It is most suggestive."
Minutes turned into hours as I minutely put all of Holmes' stray belongings back into their rightful place.
The length of his stride at the approaching speed told me a man was walking towards us- light in build, and taller than myself. Those deductions were confirmed the next instant, when a young cleric appeared around the corner, obviously distressed. He was a Reverend, in his thirties, and a man who liked to bend the rules to fit his own narrative- so much I could learn just by looking at him.
I was glad to hear Holmes speak of his plans for the future, as I hoped it would give him a reason to take better care of himself.
"It appears he took quite the beating, Holmes. His nose is broken, as is his left arm. Then there is this large wound on his head...and there seems to be some sort of metal in it."
Save for his brother and our landlady, I am, to the best of my belief, the only one who has the privilege of knowing the many sides  of Holmes' remarkable personality. Not simply his strict sense for justice, his impatience, and his often cold and reasoning nature, but also his burning passions, his sense of humour, and above all, his great kindness.
“Splendid! Anything else?” I could tell from the gleam in my partner's eyes that he was enjoying himself; much to my delight. There was hardly a greater joy for me than to see him in so excellent a mood. There was nothing left of the disgruntled old man he had seemed at our departure.
He had turned to face the fireplace, therefore I could not see his face, but I could have sworn to hear the rasp of sleep in his voice as he said, “I am afraid it is time to continue the old charade, my boy. Mrs. Hudson is bound to return presently.”
The footman unlocked the door leading down to the cellar of the old house. It was pitch-dark, but the smell of hot metal told us a lamp had been burning for some time. Our own light was hardly enough to cover the whole area.
Of all our intimacies, I cherished our kisses the most. The feeling of his firm lips against mine, his familiar taste (in this case, infused with the smokey aroma of our excellent whiskey), and how his every move tickled my mustache...
"Oh, I am asking out of curiosity, rather than professionally. For as I understand it, the story is not suited for the public eye- at least not without some drastic changes."
Granted, the alcohol might have been partly to blame, but I find it highly unlikely, considering the events which took place later that night.
I had never doubted the importance of this case, and I would not let it go for worlds- especially now my client had met so gruesome an end. Bringing the police into the matter would mean bringing in Baynes. No, I had to gather as much information as possible on my own.
"Thank you. Now, it happened as follows: I have had reason to believe you were unfaithful for about a year- however I did my best to trust you, and vanquish those thoughts- but, as time went on, and you spent more and more time away from home, it became harder to maintain my trust in you. I started to feel lonely...abandoned even. I tried to speak to you about it, but you always dismissed my concerns. Then, in August a letter arrived at the house- it was addressed to me. It's contents were terrible...someone named Huntley, who claimed to be your Butler at another house, demanded money to keep quiet about your supposed other household. He mentioned a harem of young men..." Lady Peacock took a deep breath. "I said I would do nothing before he could not prove it. Huntley replied by sending me an invite to tonight's masquerade...he told me to see for myself, and that I should give him the money that very day."
“Nothing, Holmes. I am sorry. Only the usual letters of admiration, and an invitation for a masquerade on All-Hallow's Eve.”
"She must have come in by a window then..." He muttered. "Watson- go and speak with the guests, and see if someone knows something. I will have a look at the windows on this floor."
“It's child's play Watson. We will begin by eliminating the contaminating prints: ours, and that of the Reverend-” I threw a quick glance over my shoulder. “-who was so impatient to call the police. Now, what is left?” I put aside my magnifying glass and measuring tape to better be able to explain the prints to Watson, who had joined me on the floor. He was regarding the ground with obvious confusion and interest, pen ready to note down any vital information.
Best friends began to suspect each other, and gossip was being shared. Some told us the house was haunted- which, in their minds, accounted both for the scream and the absence of a woman in the hall. Of course, Holmes dismissed the notion.
“He's...he's escaped...I hope your motivations... are founded, Holmes. I don't much like skirting around the edges of the law like this.”
"Doctor? But...you arten't the police?" he looked at us with fear in his eyes. I could hardly fault him for it.
Sir Thomas' hands were curled into fists. Confusion and anger were written on his face. "That blaggard...To think I trusted him all those years?? Whatever prompted him to turn against me in such a cowardly fashion?!"
My body ached at the memories forcing themself into my head all at once. I wished I could have cried; could have shed as much as a single tear, but found myself unable to. All I could do was shake my head slowly, and continue my monologue. Those final words weighed like anchors on my chest, dragging me further down into the dark abyss of eternal uncertainty. I needed to bury them along with Holmes.
"I cannot blame you for thinking it. And, to be entirely honest, it did occur to me- but no. There were other reasons. Mostly because nothing else was available at such short notice- well, at least nothing suitable. Knowing your love for high quality silk, I rather thought you would like it."
The building was just as lovely as the rest of our surroundings- an archetype of Georgian era architecture, with only a few, more modern elements.
Minutes passed in appreciative silence, and I had begun to think Holmes had drifted off to sleep, when he raised his voice unexpectedly.
I spread the whole thing out on the bed in front of me, and could not help but laugh when I saw what Holmes had found for me. It was a silken devil's costume- complete with tail and hood with horns attached to it. The velvet I had noted on unpacking really turned out to be a cape.
"Would you like to recount tonight's events, or would you prefer I do it for you, m'am?" asked Holmes.
A sigh. “I suppose rightfully so...” there was a brief silence. “I wonder...what does it take to regain your trust?”
"It is simply curiosity, Watson, I assure you. No crime has been committed as far as I read it, therefore there is no reason for me to do anything but listen." he intertwined his fingers with mine, and I knew I had lost.
The sudden quiet of my surroundings greatly helped in easing my agitation. Time was of the essence, but I was confident now nothing stood in the way of efficiency.
A butler appeared to welcome us, before I could lose myself in my thoughts. "Welcome, Messrs. Holmes and Watson. Mr Trevor is awaiting you, and your room is prepared. I will have your luggage sent up at once."
I have often tried to pinpoint the beginning of our misery. Now I am in possession of all the facts, it is safe to say that it was the moment Baynes set foot in our lodgings. Therefore this must serve as a starting point for my narrative- for, unlike Watson, I prefer to tell stories in their right order.
He touched my wrist in such a way I was uncertain whether he did it out of affection, or because he wanted to convince himself I was really there.
I could understand how no one had recognised her as the lady she was, for anything feminine about her appearance was masked by the costume.
"Costume?" It struck me the moment the word left my lips. I slapped my knee in anger over my own forgetfulness. "The masquerade! Of course!"
"They came with the house." White explained. "And since the legal papers are still in the works, we will not be able to sign the contract until November."
“I am afraid he left me no choice. The end justifies the means, dear fellow. Now, if you will excuse me, I must prepare some chemicals I need to analyse today's evidence.”
The cupboard next to the desk proved to be of interest, as it contained several devices for self-mortification, and a safe which the Reverend refused to open, further adding to my vexation.
“But what does it all mean, Holmes? I can make neither head nor tail of the situation...espcially this unnecessary brutality.”
"Trevor here told me you were acquainted, but I wasn't aware he would invite you. I am pleased he did. You see, I'm a great admirer of your work, gentlemen. Both of you."
My friend returned soon thereafter, having found nothing except the fact that all windows were bolted, and no one had attempted to gain entrance.
Holmes smiled tiredly at me, then looked at the anxious woman who had opened the curtains and windows at my request.
“Perhaps you are right...” he said, finally putting out the cigarette. “I often forget there is more to this vessel than wits.”
"The poor Bishop...he was not only killed, but horribly mutilated! He was such a good man...how could anyone be so brutal? Look at him, he's barely recognisable! How could any of God's children be responsible for something like...like that?"
“Very unlikely, as the decoration on her hat is also very distinctly Alpine. Moreover, I know she does not speak French well because she keeps looking about her in such a peculiar fashion. It is typical for someone who is trying to read something, but has a hard time deciphering it.”
Those moments of absolute freedom always felt strange to me; overwhelming, even. When two men spend their days and nights doing everything in their power to hide their love from the public, it becomes second nature to them. Subsequently, they forget how lovely, yes how vital true intimacy is to the human soul. When it does occur, however, I am reminded of how blessed I am to have found someone who allows me to express this strange affection, and who never fails to remind me that I too, am loved.
"Given the fact that there is much at risk for all parties involved, I believe we can settle for a quiet solution..." said Holmes sombrely. "Especially because you strike me as an honest woman, Lady Peacock, who was driven to extreme measures by fear and blackmail. As you said- you were merely trying save face. Of course the Butler's death will have to be accounted for, but I will gladly use my influence to tell the police he died of an unfortunate fall down the stairs."
"I suppose we shall see soon enough." a tranquil silence fell over us, until an idea came to my mind. "Holmes?"
I smiled back at him a little awkwardly, trying to shake any emotions and continue with my examinartion. Luckily, his temperature was only slightly raised.
"A harlequin?" he paused. "Yes, I believe I have. Though I have no idea who he might have been. I haven't been able to greet everyone in person tonight, due to the high attendance."
"Perhaps, but I know what happened." Holmes' voice was stern, but his manner relaxed as he lit a cigarette. "A confession would bring you a considerable advantage, as it is the only way we can help you."
"Yes, the Bishop of Knightsbridge. I put his address on our map of London, on my desk. Would you get it for me, please?" I waved an arm vaguely in the direction of the living-room.
I could feel Holmes' intense gaze upon me the entire time, from the moment we entered our room. My heart was pounding with anticipation. There was no need for quiet that night; no need to bite my wrist in order to muffle those sweet sounds of passion.
"Yes, Thomas. It is me. Although I understand your own wife is the last person you's expect to see at this sort of party."
"Dear me...Trevor always has been an old romantic. I see his taste hasn't changed." Holmes remarked with some amusement, as the carriage came to a halt.
"That's better. Well, as I have told you, it all started at university. It was on a Sunday, and I was on my way to chapel when-"
It appears he has reached an agreement with his wife, which allows both of them to live life to the fullest without falling under public scrutiny.
A sidelong glance at the mantelpiece told me there was no time to be lost. It was then I first noted something was...off.
Time froze as we stared into each others eyes. Aeons could have passed without either of us moving, until, at last, Holmes broke the spell by putting his own gun against his head and pulling the trigger.
"Adequately." There was mischief gleaming in his eyes as he turned around to face me. He had been joking. "And yourself?"
But then, in the autumn of 1887, when we were barely 30 years of age, and much of my friend's life and character still seemed an enigma to me, I jumped at the chance to learn more.
My friend smiled sarcastically. "With respect, Sir Thomas, but my expertise is crime- and as much as I shall be happy to take on any little problem which you might present to me, it means something unpleasant has happened."
His voice had begun to crack towards the end of the sentence. I needed to direct his attention back to the facts in order to learn as much as I could.
We are in the prime of our lives- Holmes 33, and I 35, yet, the unkempt shock of brown hair on my friend's head made him look almost 10 years younger.
"It's a sign, Holmes...I'm not meant to be in England. Death follows everywhere I go. After all this, I'm only too glad to return to my tea...Still- it was good to see you again, old chap. Perhaps we'll meet again in 12 years." They shook hands, and lingered for a while.
Holmes chuckled somewhat bitterly. “I should think not. It is a strange fellow indeed who shoots himself in the forehead at more than an arm's length.”
Trevor cocked his head. "He hasn't told you how he came by it yet? Well, I'm hardly surprised." he turned to my companion. "You always were dreadfully secretive about your relations."
“Then I have no choice but to comply with your condition.” I removed my collar, and slipped into the warm sheets beside him.
I rewrote most of this chapter because I didn't like it to the point where it was ruining the stoyr for me. I hope you guys ejoy the updated version! :D
I beamed with excitement. Never before- and never thereafter, has my friend lauded me in such a way, regarding my meagre attempts at the art of deduction.
How long I sat staring I do not know.  But it is safe to say that I had spent much longer, wallowing in tristesse, had it not been for Mrs. Hudson knocking on my door to let me know breakfast was ready.
He entered, accompanied by two uniformed policemen as if to make an arrest. His tie was done with so much effort, and his back was so forcibly straightened, it made him appear entirely artificial. So much so, I half-expected him to offer to read our fortunes for twopence. It was rather unsurprising to hear his tone matched his posture when he greeted us.
Betraying weakness would invariably lead to questions- questions he was undoubtedly asking himself already, but had no reason to say aloud. As much I  would have loved to lay every inch of ,y soul before him, I could not do it- not with a case of this magnitude.
“Doctor Watson wold not allow me to contact anyone else! What manners! I am a man of the church!” the other man whined.
Life inside the music room had resumed. Drinks were being poured to steady nerves and ease minds. The news had spread quickly, putting an end to the festivities.
“His nephew came to visit him yesterday at his Excellency's request. I found this a little peculiar, as the young man very rarely visits. Both of them seemed agitated when he left. I asked his Excellency what was the matter, but he simply told me not to worry as it was a family matter.”
Again, my friend appeared rather amused- this time in a mischievous manner. "I think no one would appreciate a drunken stable boy, or an old priest on the premises. Although it would make for a fine practical joke, I will admit it."
On most occasions, when one wishes to make a toast, or deliver a speech, one needs to attract the attention of ones guests first- I believe I need not mention that Sir Thomas was the exception that proves the rule. Everyone's eyes- including mine and Holmes' were already fixed on him.
My friend's surprise and disappointment were evident. Guilt gnawed on my conscience, but I was unable to show it, as it would mean allowing the Reverend to gain the upper hand.
Another one of those rare smiles passed across his features like a ray of sunshine between two drifting clouds. “Anything is to my liking if it is presented by you, my boy.”
Holmes' gaze idly followed the passing scenery. I could imagine only too well how he sneered, in his head, at those provincial little cottages.
Holmes then slipped into the mass of costumed men, surely to ask those questions which had not occurred to me. I followed behind, if for no other reason than to learn.
“But I digress...Since I cannot possibly keep bees in the city, I shall move to the country. Where, I have not decided yet, but I would like to take up a small farm there...perhaps keep a dog or two, if my health will allow it.”
My reply was the usual, polite summary of my deductions and an, I'm afraid to say, not entirely serious, welcome. There could be only one reason for his visit.
One of the other lads who had been serving drinks made his way into the hall in order to let everyone out. One by one the men, who had arrived in such high spirits departed- no more than frightened shadows of the colourful personas as which they had arrived.
One single breath was enough to transport me back home in my mind's eye, and relive a great number of happy evenings.
His tone had assumed a slightly melancholy ring. In fact, his whole demeanor was that of a fatigued man. Once again I simply put it down to a relapse in his recovery.
“Mmmh, Watson...” he muttered sleepily without opening his eyes. “I have always wondered what it would be like to wake up by your side...”
The clouds had parted to pour golden rays of sunlight onto my friend's formidable face, and giving his dark hair the appearance of having been set ablaze. His eyes shone in the lightest grey as he caught my smitten gaze. A smile lit up his features, and I could feel his foot brush against mine.
Baynes finally saw sense. It did not earn him my gratitude, but I did spare him a retort for addressing me by my last name only. That is a privilege reserved only for my friends, and a friend he was certainly not.
"Be that as it may-" Chimed Trevor, reaching for his glass. "Let's toast to Sir Thomas' generosity, which made this unlikely reunion possible."
At this, Holmes' eyes opened, and I believed to sense a flicker of something akin to concern in them. “Certainly. Do our adventures never dog you in the night?”
We proceeded to spend some more time seated in the sun, before clouds conquered the sky and forced us to resturn inside lest Holmes should catch a cold on top of his already weakened health.
We had gotten to our feet, and were now facing each other. A sparkle of delight entered Holmes' eye.
Of course, I had always been certain my love for him would have to remain a well-kept secret. Holmes was married to his work, and neither woman nor man could change that. All in all, I was quite content with serving as his guard and conductor of light. As long as he allowed me to accompany him on his cases, I was happy. But then, everything changed. Why had he refused to confide in me? If none of those rumours were true, why had he made no attempt at all in convincing me of it? Of course there was only one reason. If he hadn't tried to prove his innocence, most likely because there was nothing to prove.
“You say you are a gentleman, but I hear nothing but the words of a blackmailer. Just...just open it and leave.”
Sir Thomas gave a start at the idea. "What?! That's ridiculous! I never laid hands on my staff! Most of them are former rent boys whom I picked off the streets and offered a future! Those boys have been through enough!"
“Where else could I have hidden them? My own chambers offer no cover. I knew, however, that his Excellency- may he rest in peace- knew nothing about chess, and would not notice my game.”
“Splendid.” Holmes smiled at me in the fshion of a husband who had successfully redeemed himself. He then stretched out a hand for me to take. “Will you join me now?”
I knew, the moment I stepped through the door that staying at Baker Street would not be an option. Holmes' scent lingered in our rooms- his soap and cold tobacco. Of course, I had not noticed before. It was, after all, the smell of home. How was I supposed to come to terms with past events when even the air reminded me of him? How then, was I supposed to forgive?
It is impossible to say whether Sherlock Holmes is a heavy, or a light sleeper. Often have I attempted to make sense of his sleeping pattern, without success. At first, I believed the depth of his sleep to be dependent on his work, such as everything else in his life. This changed however, when I found he could sleep as soundly during a case, as without one. Certainly, there were times such as these, when he would work for days on end without much rest, but he would (more often than not) make up for it when his work was done, and rest until he was his very own self again.
One large ink stain on the rug on the floor, located on the opposite side of a small desk, and a piece of cloth jutting out from behind the same.
In the hallway, we encountered Hayes, the temporary page. My colleague muttered something in his ear, to which the boy nodded and left for the music room. We then progressed into the smoking room, to hear Lady Peacock's story.
"Well, doctor it's a lengthy story, the whole business, but I'll attempt to make sense of it." he paused to think. Suddenly, there came a loud thump, followed by the high, terrible scream of a woman.
A handsome lad, hardly 25 years of age, awaited us upon our arrival. He showed us to a Clarence, or Growler, as they are more commonly known these days, and stowed away our luggage.  Polite as he was, there was an air of anxiety about the boy- like someone who is afraid of missing an appointment. I decided to keep my thoughts to myself, knowing the staff were preparing a party back at the house. Yet, my friend's strained expression told me, he too had noted something.
A warm spring breeze lifted the delicate white curtains of the open French window, and brought with it a hint of tobacco. It was followed by a jovial, “Out here! Come join me, Watson!”
Like so often, my friend must have read the question from the puzzled expression on my face, for he cocked his head and smiled good-naturedly.
“Look here- this print was made by well-worn boots with an odd pattern on the soles. They are size 9. I have taken a small fragment of stone from them. Who knows what it might tell us. Those on the other hand, are hobnail boots, like those worn by labourers.”
Barely could I withhold a sigh of relief when the cleric finally gave in. He scowled, but took the key from his pocket and threw it across at me.
Holmes successfully informed the police about the Butler's death being a tragic accident- after which we were able to return to our safe and comfortable quarters in Baker Street.
The boy looked at his partner in crime with reddened cheeks and eyes, but remained silent when he received nothing but an icy stare.
It was good to see that, underneath the sickly exterior still lurked the man whom I loved, with his gallows humour and the intelligent twinkle in his gray eyes. It might be a selfish thing to think, but I feel, at least a little, that my presence had already improved his spirits.
Some strange instinct forced me to bring a hand to his head; touching him, as if I could thus make the moment linger.
He gave a short laugh. “Well, I am glad to hear it! There is much at stake, so I must do my best to be exemplary.”
Driven by sheer panic, I fired at the man whom I had considered my most intimate friend for so long. I had feared for my life as my gun failed again and again. My heart pounded faster in my chest with every quiet click. He must have foreseen my reaction and taken the bullets from my revolver. Terrified I dropped my weapon. Was he really prepared to shoot me? I could not say.
Finally, we heard the long-awaited sound of the front door. My friend did not lose an instant in getting to his feet, and moving to the sofa.
“By jove! What a surprising turn of events.” He looked up at me. The spark had returned to his eyes. “Say, friend Watson. You would not mind two or three days in the country-” he raised a meaningful eyebrow. “-among like-minded bachelors? He had the kindness to invite both of us.”
“Oh yes, doctor. I should. A man who up and leaves to another country to look after his friend deserves a good pie in my books.” she chuckled in her amicable way. “Well, gentlemen, I hope you can quite sort yourselves out after dinner. I'll be going to the theatre tonight.” Again, she laughed. “Can you imagine? Mrs. Turner and I in a box at the Adelphi?”
He gave a short laugh, yet I continued. Holmes liked to present himself as a man of perfect reason, who- in his own words- "does not rank modesty among the virtues". Though he repeatedly contradicted this statement by downplaying his own abilities, or quietly blushing at compliments. So it came as no surprise to me, when his reaction was to laugh at the idea of fame.
The festivities continued for about two hours. Groups were formed, splitting into smaller fractions of men, who pursued different recreational activities. Some migrated to the smoking room to chat, some (most likely partners who seized the chance to finally express the pent-up, unfulfilled romance which is the fate of our kind) danced a slow waltz near the quartet, and others ventured into the large dining room to play games. Somehow- I believe it was the fault of Sir Thomas' gift of persuasion in equal parts as the sentiment Holmes felt towards both myself and his old friend- we found ourselves among the latter party. In the beginning, my colleague restrained himself, in order to make an actual effort at allowing others to win. Sometime between the Minister's cat and Charades, however, our companions discovered Holmes' identity.
A noise had alerted me. I had rushed over to speak with him- to demand answers once and for all. Why I thought my revolver would help me in the pursuit of the truth was a mystery to me. To Sherlock Holmes a weapon was perhaps the least convincing argument.
I chuckled. “Forgive me,, Holmes, but I cannot imagine a man of your character keeping a Labrador. Surely, even age cannot change your quick and eager nature!”
When I felt his gaze fixed upon me, I was certain I had become the object of his judgement now the cottages were out of sight.
"Ach, god-damn it..." Willis' voice was weak with resignation. "Fine...have it your way. It's your fault if they hang us..."
"-I rather think my readers would be very interested to learn how you came about your profession. Especially because you take every opportunity to remind us you are the only consulting detective in the world."
“I am sorry to disappoint you, Holmes, but I have had dealings with much more difficult men than you.”, said I, upon taking my seat at the dinner table.
The window was wide open, but his scent had prevailed. I wondered if it would linger there forever, just like a part of his spirit had remained by his desk.
Finally, the rustle of fabric gave away her whereabouts. A sob followed, and a figure, dressed as a harlequin, stepped into view.
"See? The doctor agrees. There is nothing more to it." White exclaimed with a mixture of relief and frustration in his voice.
"If you would be so kind as to wait until I have left the room, so the surprise will be more effective. It pains me, as I would not mind seeing you with no clothes at all- but it is a sacrifice I must make."
Again, my companion smiled. "I never knew you were in the habit of taking your notebook to bed with you."
My companion was fast asleep, and had been so for some time. Nonetheless, I kept on reading hoping; wishing it would help in some way. Perhaps the idea was not so far-fetched after all, as the look on his face was one of content.
"It's just...." he paused and took a deep breath. "If all of this becomes public- I'll be out on the streets for good. No house will ever want me again...it...it frightens me, sir."
This lock proved rather easy to pick, as a needle from the dead man's Cilice opened the door almost instantaneously.
A small group of us followed Willis into the kitchen, where we found the Butler. The poor devil- eyes wide open, a broken nose, and a terrible wound on his head. One glance was enough to confirm that he was beyond human help.
"I am not frightened of an intruder, Watson- if there even is one. What worries me is the thing which caused someone to let out such a harrowing cry. There is more to this than meets the eye."
As so often, he inspected every surface minutely, paying special attention to the door knobs and a cabinet, which stood near the cellar door. I believed for an instant, he was about to return to the dining room, but Holmes stopped in front of the door. It seemed he had discovered something on the doorstep.
“I solemnly swear- on my honour as a gentleman- to refrain from tobacco until my health is restored. Was that quite satisfactory, doctor?”
"I don't doubt you have an endless supply of costumes..." I mumbled, rather annoyed at the fact I had no means of procuring any sort of appropriate dress. Bitterly, I considered using my old uniform, as it served as little more as than a reminder of my time in the army, and the injury which had sent me home, and, indirectly, into Holmes' arms.
He raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Because she must have been locked in the cellar at the time of Huntley's death. You see, Watson, there was the smallest trace of makeup on the Butler's suit. I almost mistook it for flour or chalk- but upon closer inspection, I understood it to be too adhesive to be either. I found the same traces on the door of the cabinet, and the cellar door- which means whoever pushed the Butler still had a chance to escape through that door before it was locked. It also meant whoever pushed him must be unfamiliar with the layout of the house. In addition to that, the chips of golden varnish you discovered in his wounds had no possible way of getting there in the hall. But the dining room was practially littered with those baroque candle sticks. No doubt you remember the way I examined them. That was the moment I realised, that, not only did the coating visibly correspond with those I had taken from Huntley, but the very absence of one of the candlesticks proved indicative. Another thing which struck me, was the absolute absence of blood. I found but a single drop, which undoubtedly originated from Huntley's broken nose as he staggered into the dining room, looking for help. Whoever finished him off, must have had enough time to thoroughly clean the place. It was you who told me the wound must have blead considerably- so I hardly doubt you notised the kitchen floor was perfectly spotless- telling us he was already dead upon being carried there. It must have cost Parker all his strength to help his partner transport the body." He looked at me with yet another mischievous twinkle in his eye. "The things we do for love, eh Watson?"
Holmes and I were met by Trevor and White the next morning. They thanked us for coming, and informed us of their plans of returning to India.
A smile briefly lit up his features. There was nothing he enjoyed more than surprising someone else. "The diffuse shadows on the curtains speak volumes, Watson. They also tell me the fog will, likely enough, not lift all day. Hence, the assumption that we will remain inside, where it is warm and dry."
I decided to let the matter rest for a while. Curiosity did get the better of me over luncheon however, so I addressed the mysterious invitation.
Despite his age and grizzled hair, the butler's appearance spoke of grace and respectability. I was certain the lines on his elegant face were the hard-earned fruits of a life of labour.
“As you might have guessed, resolving your small chess-problem allowed me to discover some very interesting letters...”
My heart sank again as I walked away. This was the day our misery began, as it was the day Dr. Watson, the most loyal man in England, began to lose his faith in me.
Mrs. Hudson had done her best to restore order to the chaos caused by the police after Holmes' disappearance following the incident at the Mill- however a brief glance was enough to tell me some things were not placed correctly. Reluctantly I picked up a book from his desk. It was a treatise on light spectra in chemistry- something I could never begin to understand.
"Now, gentlemen- let us reveal the lady who has given us such a fright. Willis, would you be so kind as to accompany us in case she plans to escape?"
"I don't know how the reporter got hold of the information, but it's true...about the necklace, of course. I wouldn't permit myself to question the integrity of Mr. Holmes."
“I'm afraid I cannot do that. Not just yet. Come, Watson, it is time to open the safe. I am eager to discover what remarkable treasure could justify such an act of barbarity.”
It took some time until we could sober up from the intoxicating effects love often has, and to pry ourselves away from the other.
Two days later, on the 29th, we found ourselves on the train to Norfolk, where Mr. Trevor's residence was located. The two of us were vibrating with excitement- I rather more than Holmes. After all, I had almost given up hopes he would ever voluntarily leave London purely for recreational reasons. The holiday also gave me a chance to find out more about his past- perhaps even his youth. The prospect of meeting someone who could...humanize Sherlock Holmes was thrilling to say the least.
Suddenly, overcome with a sense of domestic bliss, I felt that, if he were ever to disappear from my life, it would equate to a piece being taken out of the centre of my very own jigsaw, leaving it dissatisfactory and incomplete.
I chuckled, and, upon passing him, moved a hand gently through his hair. He had not pomaded it at all that day, by the looks of it. The sight was a rare, but not unpleasant one.
Watson lifted his hands in an appeasing manner, ready to explain who we were. I put a hand on his chest to stop him. It was vital he should speak before us.
"You shall be forgiven- but only this once." He replied half sulkily, half teasingly. "Now, do you want the story or not?"
At last, we decided to have breakfast brought to our room. It was a great joy to see him devour two omelets. It showed his rapid improvement.
My body forced my eyes shut at the sight of the carpet. No doubt Mrs. Hudson had ordered someone to have it taken away and cleaned- if not replaced. But for now, Holmes' blood still marked the spot where he had decided to take fate into his own hands.
The next moment, he had vanished into the adjoining room. I was left behind grinning like a fool and shaking my head at Holmes' eccentric manner.
He dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. “Puh, puh, Watson! She has neither the posture, nor the marks upon her nose! Her eyesight is in perfect order! So- on to the next point. You said she is the daughter of a country squire. The fact she does not understand French well utterly invalidates the claim. Had she had the fortune of the education wealthy children receive, the language would be second nature to her. Her face and hands speak of a rural upbringing, certainly, but not a wealthy one. No, my bet would be on an agricultural background. Her family has risen in the world not too long ago- through an unexpected inheritance. I wager it is her first time out of her native country.” His eyes wandered from girl's faint reflection in the window, to meet my gaze
By the time I had dressed for the funeral, the unanswered questions brewed into a fresh wave of anger. The constant change in my emotions proved to be rather exhausting. My lack of sleep only adding to it. I acknowledged the exasperation towards my friend with no little remorse.
"Au contraire, Watson. The case itself is easily published- but I am afraid you will be disappointed. I might have solved the matter, but only played a very minor part in it. Besides- the story lacks the satisfaction of justice your readership craves. There is a decided element of sensationalism, however."
As soon as the Clarence rattled into motion however, our thoughts returned to the holiday ahead of us.
“Very well...we have reached an impasse. You are a stubborn man, Reverend.” I continued, still glaring at my bis-á-vis “Watson, escort this man to the police station, and return with Inspector Baynes. Baynes and no-one else. I shall wait for you here.”
He looked intently into my eyes. There was a fire burning in them- a sign he was taking the incident more seriously than he allowed anyone to see.
Sir Thomas broke the silence. The crowd of men began to move again, as if simultaneously awaking from a trance. "Please, gentlemen! There is no need to fret. We will find an explanation for whatever happened. We have no proof anything...unfortunate...has happened- and until we do, I suggest you go back to the music room and have a drink. After all, we have the famous specialist Mr. Sherlock Holmes on our side."
For a moment, my mind, riddled with grief and anxiety, tricked me into believing there were sounds coming from the adjoining room. It took some effort not to jump to my feet and burst through the door to Holmes' room.
“Now, must I really ask how you came to be this way? Or why, despite the great number of excellent doctors in France, you summoned me?”
Reluctantly I dressed myself. By the time I emerged from my room the sadness had been overshadowed by numbness. Even the sight of Holmes' beloved analysis table failed to provoke the slightest emotion. It only called to memory a distant echo of what must have been love and loss.
"Well, Huntley had no desire to risk his good reputation- at least that is how I read it." Said Holmes with a shrug. "As to the latter point, it is impossible to say now. A personal motive seems to be the most likely explanation. Jealousy readily suggests itself to me."
I had tried hard not to look at him. I could never withstand the kindness of those hazel eyes, so I folded my hands in front of my chest in protest and stared defiantly at the closet across the room.
Quickly, I replaced the brush. To my great dismay I found a few other things Mrs. Hudson had misplaced.
“You know me too well, dear boy.” he said eventually, looking back into my eyes. “I might have won in the eyes of justice, but I'm afraid I failed myself in the process. For eight weeks I worked tirelessly- hardly ever less than fifteen hours per day...well, it appears my method works splendidly over short periods of time, when fascinating but simple matters need solving. Two months I have hardly rested or eaten in any way you would condone.”
Holmes smiled warmly. It was enough to give him away. “Better not question your luck, Mrs. Hudson. I too wish you a pleasant evening.” he said blandly, but I knew the joy he felt at having done something good for the old ladies.
"Goodness, no. We will have to make some changes once the house is ours. Speaking of the devil- here he is."
Alarmed, some of us stormed out into the hallway, where the sound had come from. To our great surprise the place was empty, save for some concerned guests.
As for Sir Thomas, he entirely dissolved his Norfolk household, and has founded a charity for the care and education of London's steet-urchins.
“Not quite. I was trying to break force the chest. It was only chance which put me in possession of those letters.”
Thankfully, the case kept the two of us occupied for a fortnight. I had forgotten all about the invitation until my companion mentioned it to me a few days after the successful conclusion of the latest problem.
"That is excellent news, Watson, for it tells me whoever alerted us must still be in the house. The return of the page and the footman will tell us more. Did you find anything of interest?"
My friend raised an intrigued eyebrow, which instantly alerted me. I had no desire to spend this holiday alone among strangers while he disappeared to solve crimes. Any attempt to keep the old hound from catching a scent would be hopeless- as I had to learn during the Reigate incident earlier in the year.
Tired and tense, we sat in silence for a several hours, until luncheon, when we made for the dining car. A meal and some conversation greatly improved Holmes' spirits. His eyes glistened once and again and his face resumed a healthier colour as he rambled on about gardens and what to deduce about a person from the plants they keep.
The latter proved to be the right choice. He stopped fidgeting with the map, sighed, then lifted his head to look at me.
He bit his lip, frowned for a moment, then gave me a tired little smile which held all the kindness in the world. It told me much more about his real state than his actual reply.
The house was beginning to fill with strange and outlandish characters, and each of them in the perfect temper for a pleasant evening among like-minded men. Some of the more noteworthy costumes we encountered were a bat, Robin Hood, and a sans-culotte.
I woke up drenched in cold sweat. I had jolted upright in an attempt to escape my demons- in vain. They chose to linger; to haunt and mock me in the shapes of those who had lost their lives in this dreadful affair.
“It was not my intention to worry you. I am sorry.” he smiled at me again in the same fashion as before, and I paused with my hand still resting on his forehead.
"Come, come, my boy! I promise you will hear the end of the story as soon as we have some time to spare, but I have no desire to do my toilette with cold water. Perhaps this will console you for the time being." Before I could respond, a soft, lingering kiss was pressed against my lips.
After I had changed my clothes, Holmes instructed me to go down into the lobby and inquire for a suite, so we could continue to share rooms. Being his doctor proved to be a rather splendid excuse for many intimate liberties.
Finally, his facade began to crumble. He took off his hat and slowly walked towards the stained-glass windows.
My heart hardened at the thought- the pain amplified by my affection for Holmes. All my trust, wasted. All my admiration misplaced. What a fool I had been. What a lovesick fool...
“First of all, that the lady is no Frenchwoman. She is either Swiss or Austrian- but I think the latter more likely. She would be able to speak better French, even if she were from a Canton where it is not used primarily. Which leads me to your next slight-”
"More than you might think, Thomas. But...before I tell you my terrible tale- you must make one promise."
We sprang to our feet. The sound of china breaking echoed in the hall. We arrived at the scene seconds later, only to find Willis and Parker rolling on the ground together.
I turned to Watson, who was scribbling in his notebook. He had recently come up with some sort of system to keep track of my deductions. It seemed to be quite efficient. His efforts were commendable, and I informed him of it. As a result of which he raised his notebook, evidently trying to hide his blush from me. I, in turn, faced the other way to conceal a smile.
My hand stopped at the last second, as if blocked by some invisible force. It all played out in my head once again with overpowering force.
“Nonsense, Holmes. My life with you offers enough excitement. I could not have asked for anything more fulfilling.”
"How could we have been fooled by such a blatant imitation? I don't understand." Interjected Baynes.
Upon stepping out of 221b, I realised the weather quite befitted the occasion. Dark and heavy clouds covered the sky. An autumnal thunderstorm was brewing in the distance, and the trees were shedding their leaves in mourning for the Great Detective.
"I say! Holmes! Dr. Watson! Welcome to our humble abode!" The blonde man got to his feet to shake us heartily by the hand. He lingered after greeting me. "It is an honour, doctor. I've been thoroughly looking forward to meeting you in person. You must tell us all about your adventures over dinner."
Reluctantly, I put it on, wondering why my partner thought it appropriate to have me dress up as the Dark Lord. A glance in the mirror gave me the answer. Without wishing to flatter myself, I had no choice but to admire the effects the red silk had on my appearance.
"Holmes?" I asked, once we were sat comfortably in our armchairs, smoking, and enjoying a Whiskey and soda.
The estate was situated about a thirty-minute ride from the station. Never before had a country homestead struck me with such beauty. The large fence surrounding the premises was lined with oak trees, which had turned the most beautiful shade of orange. The leaves gave the appearance of having been set ablaze, as the last rays of golden sunlight shone upon them. The drive up to the house too was lined with clusters of orange, which gradually turned red as we approached the vine-covered old house.
"Aye..." Willis raised his voice at last. "And I thought he'd give us away if he were the one to tell them Huntley had died..."
He pouted at this. "Very well, I will tell you- but I have you know that I do not take every opportunity to remind you. I simply..." Holmes paused. "...use it to underline my authority before uncooperative persons."
"Reverend, when the Inspectors of Scotland Yard find themselves at a dead end, which they quite often do, I assure you, then they turn to me. If you will allow us to continue our investigation, then you shall see justice done."
He leaned back and shook his head. His knee brushed against mine as he adjusted himself. I cannot help but think it was not quite on accident.
The statement alone would have been enough to alarm me, however the smell of burnt flesh mixed with blood solidified my concerns.
So I began reading to him. The assortment of poems was rather strange, without any rhyme or reason to the selection, worse still- most of them were of an almost intolerably romantic nature. I chose to omit them for my partner's sake. Still, there were some I was certain he would enjoy.
Breathless I stormed into the room. I had done nothing for the past 24 hours, save worry about the life of the man dearest to me. Even during my countless train journeys I had hardly been able to catch a wink, for when Mr. Sherlock Holmes' iron constitution gave in in such a way a doctor needed to be summoned, there was little room for optimism.
Baffled, I stormed onto the balcony. There he was, basking in the sun with a cigarette in hand, and some tea and, what appeared to have been a croissant on the table next to him.
It was one of those moments in which my friend suddenly opens up to reveal his innermost feelings to me, and giving me the honour of a quiet glance in the innermost aspects of his vulnerable, human side. I have learned not to ask him about it. He would only speak of those things when he pleased- much like when I had asked him about his boyhood a few days prior. It was clear then, he had no desire to share it with me just yet.
It was my turn to smile. Sherlock Holmes had his own way of expressing his affection towards me, which was never direct. While I appreciated the subtlety of our romance, my heart leaped at this straight-forward gesture.
Holmes joined his hand with mine once more, but rolled his head to one side with a sigh. I could feel his heart beat slowly but intensely in his chest. Were his cheeks not already flushed, I could have sworn he was blushing like a maiden.
