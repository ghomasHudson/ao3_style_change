"Why is it that so many women have come and gone in your life, John?"
John just looked at him, nonplussed.
"Nothing, John," Sherlock repeated, ruffling his hands through his hair.
Baker Street was quiet when he finally reached it. A street lamp was out and the remaining lights left an enclosing dark shadow across a large portion of the road, including 221B. John waited at the foot of the steps for some time, unable to make that final move to either the relief or the devastation of what he must do.
"I want you to stop talking and kiss me," he said, and John did as he was asked, heart thumping at the command. Following orders wasn't something he'd considered once he found himself out of the army, but with Sherlock giving the commands, John loved it. He groaned against his friend's chest, holding fast still, neither willing to let the other go. His hand went to his own cock and he rubbed through the layers of clothes, continuing the kiss whilst trying to get as much friction as he could through his jeans. A second later he huffed out, "Why did I get dressed?"
And that was before the sex had happened. Now, when he was watching, being reminded by John to eat his own food, tapping glasses with John, drinking the wine, which this time had a certain dryness to it that made Sherlock's tongue tingle and want more, the whole process was just leading up to them getting back home to give each other orgasms. It was all heightened this evening by the fact that John clearly couldn't concentrate because of Sherlock's jeans.
John was late to work the next morning, making a fresh pot of tea to help Sherlock through the first couple of hours of the day, and popping in to ask Mrs Hudson if she could please make sure Sherlock didn't run out of tea before John got home with a new kettle.
. "Kiss me again," Sherlock demanded and John thought he might come in his pants.
"Ok, well, it's late."
John put down his fork and hid behind his wine glass for a while. "Yes, I would," he answered, when he could speak without his voice shaking.
Sherlock stood up, led the way to his bedroom and in a moment they were lying together in the comfort of Sherlock's bed. Sherlock reached out an arm and John rolled to his side, wrapping an arm over Sherlock's chest, his forehead touching Sherlock's cheek.
"John, this isn't anything to do with him. I wanted to do something for you, to say thank you for your friendship."
"Well, this is great," he said, too loudly. "The guy playing Christopher is remarkable."
"Nothing," John repeated.
He ruffled his hands through his hair and sat down heavily on the edge of his bed. Why - why had he started that at all? A misplaced hand on a knee and now here he was even more frustrated than usual.
"I am bloody relaxed," he blurted, tensing up instantly and feeling the irritation flow through him.
"Did we?" Sherlock's voice replied.
The feeling in his stomach was only heightened when the end of the play came and Sherlock turned wondrous eyes on him, asking how he felt, wanting to hear John's opinions. He was chivalrous as they left their seats, holding John's coat as he put it on, leading him off the balcony, through the dispersing audience, holding doors open.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Hmm," was his only response, followed by John being shoved backwards again and Sherlock managing to straddle his thighs, despite the sheet, which was pooled loosely around his hips, exposing so much lean, pale, skin John's own chest was heaving again just from the proximity. He currently had a solid erection and if Sherlock moved just an inch further into his lap, he would know all about it.
"No, no, it's fine, that's... yeah, great, I just thought- it's no problem at all. Shall we go?" He cursed inwardly at his fumbling, but Sherlock only smiled at him as they went out into the hall.
Sherlock was frowning when John glanced up but he didn't hang around, he nodded and tried to clear the emotion from his face, knowing what he must look like, as he backed out of the room and closed the door with a quiet snick behind him. He stood for a moment, hands going to his face and he released a silent groan. That was so much bloody worse than what he had feared would happen.
He had also heard a fair bit of pacing around, tea making and general non-sleeping from Sherlock through the night. He didn't expect to see him awake before he left for the surgery. John had wanted to go down to him, to try and talk about it again, but what else was there to say?
John nudged Sherlock when they pulled up to the door of 221B, leaned forward and paid the driver, before climbing out and feeling like a chauffeur as he rounded the back of the cab and opened the door for a still lethargic Sherlock.
Sherlock sat opposite him and held up a large serving spoon. "Ahhhhh," he said, rubbing his hands together, a wide and slightly manic smile on his face. "Are you hungry, John?"
"Ok," John drew out, wondering why Sherlock was so calm and happy.
"I'll be in touch," Mycroft finally said.
Sherlock stopped at the bathroom door and turned back to John. "I'll just be a moment," and John, suddenly flustered, remembered his clothes were all upstairs.
He pulled back a little, taking Sherlock's face in his hands again. "You ok?" he asked softly.
"You don't have to abstain for me John," Sherlock said.
"I've found it difficult to sleep, recently," Sherlock said, quietly. "I could only imagine you upstairs, lying there alone. I've missed you."
"We have lube," Sherlock said again, and he tried to reach to his bedside table but couldn't quite manage it with John straddling him.
"Hey, hey," John said, taking his face into a gentle grasp. "Now who needs to relax? I've got you," he assured his friend. "We're doing this together - I haven't ever been with a man, Sherlock, and there are some significant differences here. But I'm not going anywhere - if all we have is kissing, that's fine. That's more than fine. I'm here for
"Ok, you're all right. It is just a sprain. Lie down and I'll get an ice pack."
"Headache?"
"John, I want to tell you something."
"We're just watching the play," Sherlock said slowly.
He smiled as Sherlock continued to caress his hand. "Your hand is warm," Sherlock whispered.
"Oh yeah, so I am," John said, grasping Sherlock's shoulder for support. "Sherlock, you're going to kill me."
Finally, Sherlock chipped in, "Ah, but John's not around much, he seems to prefer the surgery to accompanying me these days. Isn't that right, John?"
John looked at her with his head tilted, trying to believe her words. He had never seen that. Sherlock dismissed him as often as he did everyone else in his life. Until this recent spate of socialising, and odd moodiness. "So, what should I do? He's really trying to make some sort of effort, coming out for drinks, dinner - he took me back to Angelo's, but he made sure to let us both know that it wasn't a date." Just as John had done the first time they'd been there together... "What the hell is he doing?"
he could do this. He closed his eyes and tried to control his breathing so that his thoughts stayed calm as well. He felt Sherlock's hand against his cheek, resting lightly. "Do you want blatant honesty, or should I break it more gently?" John asked softly.
"No, I wondered if you would mind me joining you?"
"You're trying to be more socially acceptable, but if it's not you, that's ok. God knows, I'm the last person to give you advice on how to act on a night out. Why do you think I like a drink?"
"Of course," Sherlock replied simply.
He finally broke the kiss but Sherlock still held him close. "John," he whispered, leaning in for another kiss.
Lestrade drew back, eyebrows raised. "That's it? No further explanation? Come on Sherlock, you've never had a date in all the years we've known each other. Does John know?" he added, seemingly as an afterthought.
"Hmm," John nodded.
John stood up too, a little unsteadily, and they wandered into the hall.
He took another moment to consider exactly how drunk he was. He felt a little... spinny, slightly over-excited, considering he was slumped and sleepy in his chair a couple of minutes ago. The prospect of being this close to his friend would do that though, certainly aided by the alcohol, but he knew what he was doing. He wasn't certain that was the same for Sherlock though - he really didn't drink much. He moved closer, keeping his hand on his friend's thigh, leaning his face close to Sherlock's. "Are you sure?" he whispered, and Sherlock raised his head, noses nearly brushing, eyes huge in the dim light of the living room.
John sighed and swallowed. "I've tried not to, I didn't want you to feel any pressure."
"Yes. I feel as if I spent the entire night with you."
"Yes - more," Sherlock demanded.
Sherlock nodded and then picked up his cutlery and waited for John to do the same. They ate in silence for a while, John's heart was racing a little and the kitchen was really rather warm, he tugged at his shirt collar and cleared his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So," John said. "Good sleep?"
John looked them both up and down and smiled. "Nope," he admitted. They had always been clothed to some extent so far in bed together. There really didn't seem any point now.
He would if he could get a word in, if he could find one amongst the adjectives flying around his head, forcing him to do this, to bring out these feelings- "Damn it!" he said sharply. "I can't live like this, Sherlock." He clambered to his feet. "Where were you? I can't... how can I relax if you're off
"Nope, you sit down John, I've got breakfast sorted," Sherlock told him, shooing him away.
John swallowed heavily. Sherlock wanted, what - "More of this?" he asked, tentatively giving his knee a light squeeze, fully aware of where his hand was now.
"We've had maybe a bit much to drink, don't you think?" John asked.
Sherlock shifted and began sliding his hand beneath John's neck. John lifted up a little to allow the very welcome move. Once his arm was underneath, Sherlock tugged gently and brought John closer. John's skin felt too hot as he rose onto an elbow, shuffled in and looked down at Sherlock longingly.
Sherlock answered by sweeping his hand down John's torso and over his now flaccid cock. John flinched and Sherlock's hand stopped moving, raising both eyebrows as he waited.
Back at the flat Sherlock's coat was hanging on the peg where John had seen it earlier. The man himself was settled on the sofa reading when John opened the lounge door.
"Not really!" Greg boomed, and Sherlock was suddenly sitting upright and blinking in the confused manner of someone who has no idea where they are.
John didn't reply. He'd read them eventually, but the last thing he needed at the moment was a reminder from his sister as to how difficult it was for his family to maintain contact with each other, without an ulterior motive. He didn't want to know any more about his sister's new woman, or how much money she needed, and he didn't want to answer questions about Sherlock. About John and Sherlock. Harry had always made assumptions about John, and up until very recently he had been able to tell her she was wrong, out of order - stop pushing it. Maybe that was why he couldn't bring himself to have the talk with her now. She would see through him immediately and know that she had been right all along. He wasn't ready to apologise when she should be the one apologising to him for using him all these years.
Sherlock gave him a disparaging look. "But perhaps yours is a little too high?" he asked softly.
drink too much," Sherlock said, ever honest.
"I'm kind of glad about that actually," John said, before rinsing his mouth. "Ok, I'm ready."
"Nice, Sherlock, yes," John said, slumping back onto the sofa in relieved defeat.
John finally drew back and Sherlock was the one to stare now, they were in public and John had never done anything so brazen before. Mind you, Sherlock was the one who had kissed him first, he should have expected it really. He smiled as John seemed to come to his senses and apologised.
He found that he couldn't quite place the time when that had happened. Somewhere between John confessing his own feelings that fateful night downstairs, and him beginning to open up to Sherlock, and discuss his past relationships. Sherlock wanted him anyway, despite any of his past. His past made John who he was today. But he had needed to know that John wouldn't treat Sherlock as just a date.
"Uh," John started, pushing his package behind his back.
John was quick to reply. "Of course, absolutely, and I'm not saying we should start with that, we'll build up to it..."
"I bought lube John, I thought we might need it."
"So, tube or taxi?" John asked, as they both shuffled their feet. He was feeling tipsy, not unpleasantly, just nicely drunk. Sherlock was looking a little flushed in the low light coming from the pub and from the overhead lights.
. And Sherlock's lips were beautiful; plump, soft, parting to clack their teeth together oh-so-gently, tongue lightly tracing the tip of John's...
"You don't need to worry about me - physically."
"Hmm, well there's no blood, that's one thing."
they were... So for another moment he kept quiet but it was impossible when he looked back into those kind, warm eyes. So close to him now...
"You, not wanting to work with me. I don't believe you feel that way."
He nodded again. "Yes, yes of course. Tea?" he added.
"I don't want to make you uncomfortable."
"Yes, I'm nearly finished," Sherlock said, draining his own glass. "Don't you want dessert?"
"Whose bedroom do you want to share?"
, he'd said. And yet, he knew - he knew he was lying to them all. John walked back home slowly, avoiding the short cuts, reliving all the times he had denied his affection for his friend, needing as much rehearsal time as he could get before this conversation that he knew needed to happen.
"What will you be doing up there, while you're lying in bed thinking about this?" Sherlock asked.
He was still sitting there, head resting on his drawn up knees, when the front door opened. John's head shot up and there was Sherlock - collar raised, of course; scarf perfectly placed, perfectly knotted. One hand went up through his curls – magnificent – John knew it all. He saw each tiny detail of Sherlock's face in his best and worst dreams. His infatuation with this man was so extensive that he couldn't bear to think of the days before they met. Admitting that his obsession was more than an admiration for Sherlock's work, for his mind... could he do it?
A group of loudly chattering people jolted him out of his thoughts and he cleared his throat, rubbed at his eyes and drew himself up to his full height once more.
He needed someone in his life, and he was so grateful that that person was Sherlock.
"See you boys again very soon, I hope?" Angelo said, as he shook Sherlock's hand.
John stared at him. "The chicken that ended up being dissected before you fried it over your Bunsen burner?"
John felt a small smile turn his lips up. He relaxed a little for the first time since this morning. "It looks good."
"Ah, John, glad you made it," Sherlock said, turning around to him. "Would you like a drink before we go in? We still have a few minutes."
"Isn't it?" Sherlock asked, innocently. "Only yesterday you texted me to say you couldn't make our appointment and would I take that chicken out of the freezer because you'd be late."
"All we have left boys - it's Friday night."
Sherlock picked up a card and waved it enticingly in John's face. "My offer still stands," he sing-songed, and John narrowed his eyes at him. "Get Out Of Jail card for Mayfair."
Sherlock frowned and looked back to where they had left Mike at a little table near the stairs. "Maybe one more drink? I promise to attempt to be more... socially adept."
"Oh, years," she agreed with a wave of her hand. "And he has never once been affected by anything like he has by you."
"John, is that your hand on my knee?"
John nodded. Whatever Sherlock wanted he could have.
John's breath began to come in shallow huffs as he pulled at his cock, toes curling, legs stretched out as he found his rhythm, hips giving erratic thrusts into his fist, other hand clutching the sheets as his orgasm hit and he came with a gasp, his pent-up tension released along with his cum.
"Sorry, I- I didn't want to pressurise you. With... y'know..." He reached apologetically under the sheet, palming himself for a moment and hoping that explanation was enough. The warmth in his cheeks was annoying.
"You didn't ask," Sherlock told him and surely that was a good point, logical, direct Sherlock maybe would have told him, had he been asked.
John was everything to him.
Gradually, it became a more subtle thing, a gentle brushing of lips and John hummed stilling his hand for a moment. "Sherlock," he mumbled, trying to extricate himself from his lips when he really didn't want to. "What shall we do about this," he asked, words muffled by their closeness. He pressed his palm against Sherlock's cock, then in another moment of boldness, he grabbed Sherlock's hand and pressed it to his own cock, adding, "and this?"
(smiling, handing her the phone)
Once the tea was ready, John carefully made his way into the sitting room carrying two mugs, one which he set down at the side table near his own red chair, the other he handed to Sherlock.
SHERLOCK
Oh! Hello.
(dismissively)
Well, if you must know...
Molly gravitates towards the shopping bag.
(grinning)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock quickly strips off the glove, applies a condom and a generous amount of lubricant to his cock. John watches the whole scene hungrily over his shoulder.
MRS HUDSON
Yes, I'll see to it.
SHERLOCK
John has the same expression on his face.
Ah! Sherlock Holmes, I presume. I am Dr. Herscher.
If you hadn't done such a good job covering your tracks, it might have been higher.

INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - LATER SATURDAY EVENING

SHERLOCK
Or maybe not. Ms. Adler certainly took care of your virgin situation for you. But I know, Sherlock, that you still retain certain... "hang-ups" when it comes to sex.
Ah! There you two are!
INT. POLICE CAR - 6:05PM
I'm her father, don't you think I should have the final say?
SHERLOCK
Okay, but nothing goes into my anus, do you understand me? It has had enough of a workout for one day.
I wouldn't say "new", per say. Started dating someone, though.
John at last opens his eyes, but he still looks upset.
FLASHBACK CONT. - LATE AFTERNOON
Well, no, I --
ROSIE
Goes against the flatmate agreement...
Really, don't you think you're --
(crossing arms sternly)
But more importantly, it was about how Irene and I fit, or failed to fit, into each other's lives. Can you imagine me living comfortably in her well-appointed boudoir? And how would she fare in the jumbled disorganization that is Baker Street? Quite poorly, I imagine. She would be miserable.
I'll go settle Rosie.
I've basically lost my erection at this point, Sherlock.
Friend?
Oh God!
Molly, Janine, Jim from IT, your hordes of fans... that one Tesco clerk... God, every damn time!
John nods, a bit breathless, and Sherlock gives him a lingering kiss.
She has been lurking in the back of your mind for weeks, ever since we took her case. Let's get this out in the open, John. I do not want Irene, do you understand?
John stands up, walks over, and turns off the baby monitor. With a sad smile, he leaves the room.
Only once John has settled does Sherlock slowly retract the toy and release his hand from John's spent cock.
How's your bum? Feeling all right?
CLERK
He is about to grab the pink potty when John hustles down the aisle with the trolley.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks so forlorn that John takes pity on him.
Oh my! Look who is asserting dominance all of a sudden, my dear Sherlock!
Yeah. I got a call from school. She's come down with a cold or something. So, I picked her up early.
SHERLOCK
"Operation Flirt to Make John Jealous."
Absolutely.
Ulna.
Hello, Molly.
LESTRADE
Not perfect, but I survived.

MRS HUDSON
"That it was," Sherlock agreed.
Sherlock pushes his member hard into John's hand.
Chips? I don't know about chips.
MOLLY
Sherlock clams up. John sleepily reaches a hand over to pat Sherlock on the arm with reassurance.
I'll just sleep here.
ANGELINE
"Nazir is a big snitch!"
(wistfully)
(sighing)
(under breath)
Sherlock gives the head of John's penis another lick.
Sh, sh, sh. Sherlock. It's okay. It's absolutely okay. Here. Turn over.
Why the sudden interest in all these, John?
SHERLOCK
He's probably waiting for you to pronounce your love in a more suitably romantic setting, Sherlock.
John can only whimper in response.
So, yeah, I think I'm blooming amazing at keeping mum.
Shhh! No talking, I said.
Hello John. Hello Sherlock. Fancy meeting you here.
SHERLOCK
John settles in, covers himself up with the duvet, and cuddles up to Sherlock. Sherlock sighs happily in his sleep as John wraps an arm around Sherlock.
(snickering)
SHERLOCK
Ut-oh Sherlock. What happened? Your heart? Let me...
Sherlock opens the door carefully and stands in the doorway with a smug smile on his face. He spies John's red underpants on the dresser and his face falls in confusion and dismay. He closes the door carefully, but then opens it up again, wanting to confirm what he's seen. The red pants are, indeed, still on the dresser, unworn. Sherlock frowns again and closes the door with more force this time.
John...
MOLLY
VIVIENNE
Yes. But that doesn't answer the question I originally posed to you: Would YOU like to spend the night in my room tonight, John?
(chuckling)
Sherlock! We just haven't practiced much on you yet, is all.
MYCROFT
Yes, I gathered that. Here we go...
ROSIE
Saying it aloud isn't necessary.
Ah, yes. That Charity Shop smell. I recommend spraying them all over with vodka and letting them air dry. Acts as a deodorizer.
A date, Sherlock.
Mine came back negative. Never been a fan of the stuff. I like a clear head when I work. Marta's on the other hand...
Holmes!
SHERLOCK
Please, Ms. Adler.
SHERLOCK
John returns his focus to Sherlock's groin, to give it the close inspection it deserves. He runs a finger down Sherlock's well-endowed penis. Sherlock squirms.
John looked Sherlock right in the eye.
Hey! Audrey! Sherlock! Wait up!
Sherlock bends his knees and makes room for John, who sits down heavily, tired.
(with a grin at his lips)
Trying to catch someone's fancy, are we?
"If you think I'm incapable of being wrecked by
John, there's something...

SHERLOCK
There are nursery schools all over downtown London. There's one only five blocks away, in fact.
SHERLOCK
John emerges from the bathroom with the now-clean toys in tow. He sets them on the dresser. Sherlock sits up and rests his back against the headboard as John approaches. John crawls onto the bed and places his hands on the headboard on either side of Sherlock’s face and kisses Sherlock deeply. John smiles and sits back on his haunches between Sherlock's spread legs. He looks down and watches Sherlock masturbating, then grabs the lube and slicks up his own hands. John's hands join Sherlock's on his hard cock. For a moment four hands work Sherlock's balls, shaft, and tip before Sherlock lets John's skillful hands take over.
We'll get going soon, Rosie. I promise. Want a snack?
LESTRADE
AUDREY
IRENE
(politely)
John strokes Sherlock's rock-hard penis more firmly while massaging his prostate more intensely. Sherlock buries his head into his forearms in preparation.
Well, I can't cuff the other ones, and they are all too long... and that pair is a bit loose at the waist unfortunately, although I really like the color...
Surprises are overrated. Is it dinner and a movie? I know that's cliché, but you're a bit of a traditionalist, John.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Dr. Herscher sits at her desk. Sherlock sits in a chair across the way, clearly agitated.
And suddenly it was clear. Sherlock was smiling now. "I'm sorry," he said, completely unapologetically.
Well, he could prove to John that he was able to perform in a normal situation and buy him dinner. He considered calling Angelo again to tell him that things had changed and that he and John were together, as a couple. But the wording was tricky. He had no idea what John would want him to say. Probably nothing. So he left it.
"Oh, John," Mrs Hudson said softly, and John felt her hand cover his on the table top. "What did he say?"
"Oh, ah... maybe upstairs? Thank you, Mrs Hudson."
"Why? I thought we were ok?"
"Yes, I imagine you will." Sherlock's answer was non-committal, doing nothing to lift John's thoughts - clearly Sherlock was undecided about whether regular platonic dinner dates were a good idea.
Sherlock passed the bottle to John and resumed his gentle cleaning. John tried to will himself not to react because he didn't want to seem insatiable, desperate, or anything else for that matter. He took a deep breath and squirted some soap into his palm. With his other hand he touched Sherlock's shoulder, wanting confirmation that it was ok to touch him back.
"I'll call her, arrange something," he said quietly, as they rounded the corner onto Baker Street, Tesco bag in hand carrying their dinner.
"Lucky you," Sherlock murmured, letting his hand fall away. John left him with his tea, glad he had the tolerance these days to avoid a hangover.
Sherlock stood behind his own chair, looking a little too much like a waiter for a moment, before he said, "No, thank you, John, for being there for me last night." He leaned both hands on the back of the chair and his eyes showed nothing but sincerity as he gazed at John. "I wasn't feeling myself and you took hold of me - I don't just mean medically. I really appreciate it. And I realise the conversation we had was... surprising to you, I need to rethink how I go about approaching this."
So... Mary. I popped her into this story in the smallest way possible, just as I would have preferred in the show. No Mary hate here, I just think short and sweet is good ;)
John was still feeling like a twat when Sherlock came into the living room. He was wearing pants. Blue, tight, leave-nothing-to-John's-vivid-imagination, pants. Flowing around his lithe frame was the new dressing gown.
The man rushed over as John pulled on his jumper and Sherlock grabbed his jacket. He didn't put it on. "How was it Sherlock, are you leaving so soon? No more wine for you? We have profiteroles tonight, extra special."
"Why don't you make the tea and I'll order pizza?"
"I can't complain, John," Sherlock murmured. "And you don't ever need to apologise to me."
those words more and more these days. His mind palace included areas entirely devoted to John. Those were his favourite spaces to be now. Apart from being beside John.
"Um, Sherlock, just so you know, I am... enjoying this. A lot," he said.
"I tripped on the tube, blundering after a bag-snatcher."
"Was it?" John said, innocently.
"Mmm?" Sherlock said, from where he was sprawled on the sofa, bare feet planted on the soft leather, head tilted towards John but not really appearing to see him. Sherlock hadn't been focusing on much lately and John knew he needed to find a decent case soon, although he was working, so John couldn't really see what the problem was.
"Oh," John said, understanding dawning.
John looked up at the slightly panicked sound of Sherlock's voice from the hall.
He sat down heavily at the bar and tried to avoid downing his fresh drink. He wasn't alone for long.
"I did?" John said, looking around as if whoever it was might still be there. "But I wasn't here," he added pointlessly.
"Would you?" Sherlock asked.
He was impatient now for the evening to start, for the walking to the restaurant, the watching John over the table, the ridiculous warmth and nervous tingling he experienced whenever he was close to John - and whenever John looked at him with

INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - WEDNESDAY EVENING
(smiling shyly at Sherlock)
"Yeah. Why not. Lemme get a couple of things and I'll meet you there in a few." John squeezed Sherlock's arm lightly as he stood up and wandered off.
No, not exactly. They do psychic readings and natural healing. Tarot cards, reiki, crystals, that sort of thing.
So. Here we are.

Don't take it personally.
Yes, Sherlock. Yes, I will.
As you two became more firmly installed here, I saw Irene less and less frequently.
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
You do.
John turns off the kitchen light and walks down the hall towards Sherlock's room.
Sherlock slams the car door. Nazir pulls back into traffic. Sherlock hails a cab.
Please?
Well then. Shall I treat you to some chips? There is an excellent chip shop just around the corner.
(huffing)
Tea, John?

SHERLOCK
Sherlock becomes a little flustered.

Yes, yes, I am a horrible person for not tending to my supposed heart condition.

"Always say?" By my calculations, we have done this exactly twice.
AUDREY

Sherlock scoops her up in a hug.
Dorian wears a sand pail as a hat and marches around them singing.
Absolutely! Come Dorian, let's join Rosie in the puddle like Peppa Pig.
It's nice, isn't it?
(whispering loudly)
Note to self, never put the two of you in the same room together.
Sherlock reaches for the lubricant and squeezes some on John's hand. Then Sherlock possessively slides his hands across John's hips and stomach. John grasps his own cock and begins stroking it from base to tip.
(pause)
SHERLOCK
Huh? Oh, yeah. Of course. It's... It's the case.
Peruvian cocaine.
SHERLOCK

John, still holding Sherlock's arm, takes his pulse briefly. He's not happy with the results.
I imagine so. I'd like to hear them.

You didn't have Bill Wiggins poison their morning tea, or anything like that?
finally having Sherlock, John never wanted to let him go—and Sherlock feared he might melt into a puddle at this realization.
You're not likely to have a bout of it during your sleep.
Come now, John. We can do this. But first let's take a step back.
You've ruined an otherwise perfectly enjoyable evening, John.
SHERLOCK
But the truth of the matter is that I left you, and you chose her. I had to accept that. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to endure. My only condolence was that you and Mary allowed me to be in your life to some degree. You let me be involved.
MYCROFT
What does it matter? I will find some brand new mistakes to makes, surely.
No, not quite. More like a little trip down to Human Resources.
(aside to Sherlock)
John leaves through the kitchen and Sherlock returns to his phone.
You and Rosie could take the upstairs bedroom. Although, I believe my room might be slightly bigger and you may prefer to be closer to the bathroom anyway... therefore I could move upstairs and you two take my room.
Yes. That noise.
He collects himself and returns to relieve Rosie of her dirty diaper.
You'll distract all your patients.
SHERLOCK
Even though I am explicitly banned from conducting experiments on either you or Rosie per our flatmate agreement?
SHERLOCK
(throatily)
It's either a very clumsy or very overwrought way of going about framing someone... why only attack a third of your clients? Unless that third is rather well-heeled or otherwise targets of blackmail?
(sighing)
SHERLOCK
(while texting)
SHERLOCK
Stop panicking.
Sherk?
All I am saying is one should keep their heart and mind open when a second chance is presented to them.
SHERLOCK
Mmmm... stroking.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
IRENE
Is this supposed to cheer me up?
Rosie, you know what that sound means! Time for a potty break. Come on Rosie! It won't take but a moment. Come on, then.
SHERLOCK
IRENE
"A particularly busy week."
It's not my fault the credit card companies have rubbish internal security, Nazir.
Perhaps, so. Then again... perhaps not.
What? No...
Definitely not slow! This is full steam ahead!
I reward them handsomely. Turn around, please.
Just as you did, we'll begin in the kitchen. You, in the buff, on your back, splayed out for me on the kitchen table. Those long limbs of yours reaching out wide. Are you with me so far, Sherlock?
(dismissively)
EXT. ROSIE'S NURSERY SCHOOL
Sherlock lifts his head to look at his flatmate. John's asleep, head leaning against the wall.
Sherlock suppressed the urge to point out that a crowded dance club with subpar house music was obviously
SHERLOCK
Jesus! I'm completely hard. Bloody hell.
(rubbing face)
John picks up a photo and holds it closer. He points out something to Nazir and Sherlock.
John purses his lips anxiously.
The corners of Sherlock's mouth quirk up in a grin and he reaches for the towel. Despite John's feeble attempts to stop him, Sherlock uncovers the sex toys.
Sherlock grabs the container and drizzles it onto John's waiting hand. John sits back on his heels to access his own cock, while continuing his ministrations in Sherlock's bum. John gives out his own moan of pleasure as he strokes himself. Sherlock observes with interest.
It was my birthday, if I recall.
(with a forced smile)
Sherlock, go faster....
(passionately)
HIM. WRONG TARGET. HE HATES WHEN YOU FLIRT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?
"Yes. We did. You were delighted and brought it straight up to your room to display it on your chest of drawers. 'Like a trophy,' you said, if I recall correctly."
Sherlock leaves a trail of kisses from John's bent knee down to his groin.
Sherlock seeks out advice on his love life yet again. He finds himself looking inwards and discovering that his sentiments for John stretch back farther than he realized.
Just listen to the whole story, please Sherlock. Now, when Lucky and Thistle were put in the same paddock, they would settle down and be fine. I say "fine", but those two horses would still nip at each other, their ears flattened back... they annoyed one another to no end. But being near each other was infinitely preferable to the alternative. Frankly, it was better for everyone that they were together. Far less noisy, certainly.
Sherlock now has both hands under John's jumper, thoroughly exploring John's torso.
SHERLOCK
Is this all supposed to make me feel better?
SHERLOCK
Let's go!
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
MOLLY
(with a grim smile)
(alarmed, furrowed brow)
You can help me find the rest of my ornaments.
(cheekily)
LESTRADE
Woo! It smells like you've been hard at work in here, Holmes.
John nearly drops everything in surprise. He steps into the sitting room.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock searches Ella's expression for a reaction, but her poker face is too good.
It's only because he and Rosie happen to share a common interest. The reason Mycroft so enjoys complaining about my supposed childhood obsession with "playing pirates" is because I always refused to play his favorite: knights and castles.
John nods, sadly. Sherlock closes his eyes to better recall the scene.
Starting off slowly... impossibly slow. Slower than you can stand it. And then increasing in speed. Alternating between quick and slow until you are whipped up into a frenzy.
John looks at Sherlock, with an expression of surprise, longing, a bit of sorrow. He glances away.
Not quite. A string of overdoses, of an accidental nature.
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ahhh!!
A lack of erection doesn't necessarily mean he's not aroused.
It is indeed raining. Rosie is happily stomping in mud puddles on the dirt path. John stands nearby holding an umbrella over his head. Sherlock stands under a tree trying not to get wet. John shoots him a "I told you so" look.
I'm heading to bed.
Fine.
(smiling nervously)
John, in bed, is reading a book with his reading glasses on. Sherlock exits the bathroom in his pajamas. He giggles.
packed dance floor, hopping into the fray while John sat there with his mouth hanging open in shock.
(sighing)
AUDREY
Sherlock stares anxiously at his phone while John takes a moment to respond. His reply: NO PROMISES. BABIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE
SHERLOCK
Well, he's a very cocky detective.
Mrs. Hudson and John chuckle at this.
John nods and gazes forward, deep in thought, as they continue walking home.
MRS HUDSON
And things had been going so smoothly lately...
Please, John. It's totally fine that you did.
Uh... I don't know? A fair amount? I'll definitely need to talk you through that part.
(angrily, to self)
Thank you.
Oi! It most certainly is!
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock makes a move to bust past Audrey into the house, but Lestrade restrains him by placing a firm hand on his shoulder.
"You should go to sleep, John."
(surprised)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Molly witnesses Sherlock and Nazir staring each other down.
A proper boyfriend.
Audrey rallies and catches up to John.
I have no doubt in my mind that Mary Morstan loved you, ardently, John. But did you love her?
I don't smell gasoline... so probably not Columbian?
(raising a questioning eyebrow)
FLASHBACK - INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SITTING ROOM - 20 MONTHS PRIOR - MORNING
Oh, we are?
SHERLOCK
Still, the current arrangement simply won’t do. A decision must be made.
SHERLOCK
Angeline hoots with laughter and grabs Sherlock's arm to steady herself. Sherlock beams proudly. Audrey sighs heavily and walks off in defeat. John frowns and head over to join the kids, plopping down grumpily in the sandpit.
Sherlock smiles in triumph and continues to caress John with his left hand while stroking him with his right. John has some happy genitals right now.
Although, I must say, he still looks good.
SHERLOCK
LESTRADE
MRS HUDSON
Oh! Yes, of course.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(sadly)
John only pursed his lips and doubled his efforts to spearfish the piece of fruit. Sherlock sighed and slid heavily into the booth.
He will.
ROSIE
SHERLOCK
Sherlock nods.
"See you then, ta."
SHERLOCK
I'm just realizing that now.
Mycroft looks absolutely dejected. Sherlock hesitates slightly, and then gives his brother a stiff but gentle hug. Mycroft tolerates it for a brief moment.
"Good. I'm glad we're on the same page," he replied. John sensed his cheeks and ears burning, and hastily turned back to setting off once again.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
All right, but... I don't want you to lose him by NOT telling him how you feel, either.
This chapter ends on a frustrating note. John, I'm not sure your plan is emotionally healthy for anyone; although, you are getting a lot of cardio.
Standing up? John, please tell me you don't stand up to poo.
I don't recall YOU having so many issues the first time I penetrated you.
What? It would definitely bring things to an immediate stop.
(licking lips)
But mostly it is your scent all over my bedsheets.
SHERLOCK
He gives her a piggyback ride over to the fridge. John, put at ease, takes a seat in his chair.
FLASHBACK - INT. IRENE'S FLAT - SITTING ROOM - DAY - TWO YEARS PRIOR
(calling quietly)
Yes, in fact, it is. John Watson would never believe this about himself... he fancies himself to be low maintenance... but in reality, he is quite demanding in a relationship, as you no doubt heard from our various loud arguments.
Oh yeah.
(after a wink)
Sherlock averted his eyes with guilt.
It's nothing! It's not even mine!
Red pants!
Could I turn off the light now?
Er... I'm fine. How are you?
Mind your volume, John.
No, no. I get it. Kind of a "I love you, bro" sort of a moment, wasn't it? No worries. Really.
SHERLOCK
AUDREY
What's up Sherlock? [Answer: Your John Thomas, but only while you're sleeping, apparently.]
Hello again. Come. On the bed, on your hands and knees, please.
Inspector Lestrade, across the park at a food cart, has just added the perfect amount of condiments to his falafel wrap. He is about to take a bite when, out of the corner of his eye, he spies the couple mid-snog. Lestrade does a double take.
SHERLOCK
(also softly)
John leans over, looking about to faint. Mary starts laughing.
SHERLOCK
Not necessarily. Maybe he has a low sex drive. Perhaps it is a medical condition... could be impotence. He may be ace. Asexual. Or a myriad of other reasons.
Sherlock is stunned. John pokes him in the chest with his finger.
Sherlock responds with a long, deep, satisfying kiss. Sherlock repositions himself to lie on his side next to John, propping himself up on an elbow so he can get a good view.
Sherlock listens for more noise. First nothing. Then a small groan and footsteps from upstairs. Sherlock plugs in his mobile and dims the lights. John enters groggily.
And a little more pressure for the stroking bit, correct?
You can't know what a lovely sensation it is to feel you like this.. to know how much pleasure it must be giving you.
(growing serious)
Sherlock, carrying Rosie, rushes after Angeline and Mica. John wanders over to Audrey. Audrey has a questioning grin on her face.
Quite cocky, actually.
(imploringly)
, John? You could stand to be a touch more verbose tonight, you know."
Sherlock is distracted, gazing out the window wistfully.
MYCROFT
Starving!
No, not really. It seems rather random, actually.
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
Sherlock simpers.
"All right, Sherlock," he instructed, "Just stay seated, okay?" John turned to the others.
If you could possibly pull yourself away from Sherlock to chat with Angeline a bit...
I'm a handy problem-solver, John.
The vast majority of the time I don't climax. And when I do, it takes an incredible amount of time.
SHERLOCK
SH:  DOUBT IT
(without taking lustful eyes off John)
Yep. Mary was a piece of work.
Come again?
(giggling)
MRS HUDSON
(snapping back)
How dare you?! I'm working! And in the foulest mood, remember?!
Mr. Holmes, you are a very smart person, and that can be very intimidating. Because of this, you most likely gravitate to others who genuinely like you for your brilliance... who appreciate it despite being intimidated by it.
It's just one small step. But if you feel we should take even more steps --
Where is your umbrella? Look at you! You are all wet! Really, Sherlock... didn't you get my note?
John does so, and Sherlock kneels on the bed directly behind him. Sherlock notes that the lubricant is already waiting on the bedside table for him. Sherlock generously lubes up his right hand and plunges it down John's red pants, wrapping his fingers around John's hard prick. John responds with a gasp but does not let words escape. Sherlock strokes and strokes, setting a steady pace up and down John's cock. Sherlock presses himself against John's arse. His left hand snakes down the back of John's pants caressing said arse, massaging it, grabbing it. His thumb runs up and down John's cleft and circles and presses against John's hole.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER
She went to sleep almost instantly. Mrs. Hudson certainly has a knack for wearing her out.
"It's not like I actually like it," Sherlock explained, "It's really just a means to an end, John."
Mycroft, are you even listening to a word I'm saying?!
(chortling)
That looks lovely. So, where was I? Oh yes, the three alligators. So, my husband takes down his...
Sherlock leans down over him. John gives Sherlock a deep lusty kiss. John's hands roam over Sherlock, including Sherlock's growing erection.
Marta shows Sherlock and John in.
And you underplay it! You believe you and Rosie are marooned on this sad little island, when in actuality you have people all around looking out for the two of you: Mrs. Hudson, myself, Audrey, even Mycroft in his own inscrutable way. Why don't you try letting people into your family, John? It's not that hard.
SHERLOCK
(noticing the outfit clerk is holding)
SHERLOCK
countless times... in Buckingham Palace no less.
(pouting)
Do people send paper memos anymore?
Then I'll head to bed. Upstairs.
No, a few centimeters away in fact.
MYCROFT
Yes, very much so.
Where to begin? Since you brought up "relationships", let's define that a bit. Will this merely be a flatmates-that-kiss thing, or something more substantial? What kind of relationship do we want to have? Casual or Serious? Strings-attached or no strings-attached? Romantic? Physical? Sexual? Exclusive or not-exclusive? Will we be "boyfriends" or some other label? Will we want to make it public or keep it on the down low?
"Um, yes, ok." John stepped back a little before changing his mind. "Are you sure, though?" he asked, eyeing the jar on the counter closest to where Sherlock was, in fact, chopping carrots. John could imagine that those circular things inside were pickled onions, but he knew better. "Did you want me to clear up at all? Or..."
He had taken so long to come to terms with the fact that he wanted to be with John for more than work, for more than the occasional game of Monopoly, even for more than the talking that happened sometimes late at night in their arm chairs across from each other.
"Really. That's charming, John," Sherlock told him and he turned to continue along to his bedroom, leaving John by the stairs. "I'll be having a wank," he said over his shoulder.
"It won't be the same, there's no filter," Sherlock grumbled.
He looked at his toes, couldn't quite drag his eyes to Sherlock's face again, words started to come out of dry lips and he cleared his throat.
"John," Sherlock said softly, close behind him.
"Oh, no, not at all, Sherlock. This is not your problem - I like a drink, I always have. I can't end up like last night again - I'm a bloody doctor," he shook his head, furious with himself. "But I don't blame
"Missed me?" John repeated, keeping his voice low. "How could you miss what we've never had before?"
"What the hell was that Sherlock?" John said as Sherlock wandered ahead of him towards the tube.
"Why not," he said, and turned to lead the way along the street.
"John, I'm sorry, I think I'm hysterical," Sherlock said through his giggles.
"Well, maybe if you kept to our arrangements more often you'd be home in time to make dinner," Sherlock mumbled towards the table.
There was gentle caressing of lips, a gradual teasing slide of tongues. John had never kissed anyone the way he kissed this man - slow, almost tentative brushes of lips, wanting desperately to know what would turn Sherlock on. The look in his eyes seemed to John to be adoration. He wanted to rush, to see what other looks might cross Sherlock's face - but they had to go slow.
Sherlock's eyes were closed when John dared to open his again. John reached out to him, put his hand on Sherlock's good shoulder. "I promise you, I won't ever feel this way about anyone else."
Sherlock frowned, raised an eyebrow as he looked at where they were touching. When he met John's eyes again he was smiling. He nodded jerkily. "I don't mind," he murmured, and John's heart began to thump.
Sherlock shifted and rolled towards John. The dressing gown slipped and John tried to look away but all he could see was pale skin, a lean, muscled stomach and the hugely distracting flash of blue cotton.
John considered for a moment, gently moving his fingers under Sherlock's hand, over hard flesh covered only in a thin layer of fabric. "Are you wearing pants?" he asked.
"No, not at all, nothing-"
John gasped a little and covered it with his hand, clearing his throat before he answered quickly, "Yes, yeah, we should do that."
Another non-date and a surprise visit.
Sherlock was studying him, concern across his face. He started pacing.
"Why didn't you tell me about this before?" Sherlock asked accusingly.
He still hadn't made eye contact, and as he stood up Sherlock's hand shot out and John met his eyes as Sherlock grasped his wrist. "Thank you," he said, easing back into his shirt.
"Yes," Sherlock replied at once, and John thought he might be sick. "But, more realistically, it's me, thinking about you. It's not you that is the problem."
Sleep helped, most of the time John felt better after sleeping it off, whatever
"No. Not this exact- not this thing that we're talking about, no."
Back!!
"Dinner?" he said, watching John carefully. Maybe they could have dinner afterwards, he thought as John took one more step and Sherlock felt the wall at his back.
"You were very late, I was bored."
"I can't believe she came here. You didn't give her anything, did you?" John asked, failing to reign in his temper even though Sherlock didn't deserve it.
He was on his toes, Sherlock pulling him easily up to meet his lips as they kissed again and again. John really didn't want to stop, the couple of glasses of wine were keeping his adrenaline levels up and his whole body was buzzing now that they were home, able to touch properly and his hands went to Sherlock's arse, squeezing.
"Ah, so, not funny then...?"
"Long day?" Sherlock asked as they drank.
"Fuck," John breathed. "Ice." He got up.
This is tiny but I do like it. Sherlock talks to himself and John talks to Mrs Hudson.
John put a hand on his hip, looked around the room, trying to find something to focus on other than Sherlock.
"I like to be clean," John said, trying to avoid spitting toothpaste at the mirror as he looked up at Sherlock's reflection. "How long does it take you?" Sherlock always looked pristine. He must have a stock of products he kept in his bedroom, because there wasn't much of his in the bathroom cabinet.
Sherlock's hand shot out and John looked down as Sherlock gripped his elbow. "Did you sleep well?" he asked, a slight smile on his lips but a definite accusatory undertone in there too.
Sherlock frowned for a second, then both eyes opened and he smiled up at John, his face now serene and beautiful. He nodded and then a chuckle rose, jolting John sitting so close to him, "I'm ok," Sherlock got out. "John, that was fantastic," he said through his laughter. "Where the hell did an army doctor learn how to do that?"
John was trying, he really was, not to question everything that Sherlock suggested. But now they were en route to Angelo's. The place of their first meal together - which, of course, was not a date. Definitely not a date. But what about this, right now? Sherlock had invited him to dinner after a long week, he had booked the table and here they were, with Sherlock holding open the door for John, and Angelo fussing around them as if they were honoured guests, as he always did with Sherlock, of course.
SHERLOCK
Okay, don't get yourself too worked up over Rosie. She seems plenty well-adjusted. The adults of the household on the other hand...
wished he didn't.
Well, John may not have heard. He certainly didn't respond to it.
Come on, Rosie. Breakfast! Leave Sherlock be.
SHERLOCK
Audrey furrows her brow with concern and waits patiently for John to elaborate. They continue their walking before he finally does.
(worried)
Thank you. So, I'm in love with him. He's not in love with me. And so... what now?
(pausing to text back)
"Is it because you'd rather I be flirting with you, John?"
LATER THAT NIGHT
No, no. That won't be necessary. Thank you, John.
It was a bit beastly, actually. I am a person who isn't daunted by those smarter than myself... I find them rather endearing actually... but I dislike when people use their intelligence as a weapon. Your brother doesn't seem to respect client-therapist confidentiality. But don't worry, I sent him packing. I've dealt with his type before: they think they’re so cunning, but they don't seem to know what to do with a straightforward 'no.'
SHERLOCK
And don't think I haven't noticed the nicotine patches, Sherlock.
(peering into the stroller)
I don't.
(firmly but kindly)
AUDREY
AUDREY
(embarrassed)
NAZIR
Erm, yes.
MYCROFT
I bet you wish you and Molly were as chummy.
have to both flirt and watch for suspects in equal measure, but it was a balancing act Sherlock was sure he could manage. It was time to get to work.
Uh-huh. Exactly.
Breakfast. Time for breakfast.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock complies, trying to steady his breath, recovering. John leans over him and peppers his face and neck with small kisses.
You are horrible at pep talks, you know that Molly.
Well, yes. With some frequency.
"I almost hope he is," Mycroft responded in measured tones, "If it’ll save you from this." He held up the list of drugs Sherlock had meticulously written out. Sherlock made a lunge for the piece of paper.
SHERLOCK
What do you say Sherlock? On this day of experimentation? Up for trying something new?
It's too bad I'm gone this afternoon... we could have some fun while Rosie napped.
John blinked at him, not sure he had heard that right. "Closer, yeah," he said, wide-eyed. "Closer is good. You mean more cases together, letting me know there's trouble before it happens, that kind of thing?" he rambled on.
"How are you feeling?"
Sherlock didn't look entirely convinced. "So, we'll stick to a drink at home? I think that's best, don't you?"
"I'll make some breakfast for you, shall I bring it up or do you want it down here?"
"I know, but still..."
"John, what's happened?" Sherlock was standing in the kitchen doorway, watching John curiously.
"Harry was
"Um..." John covered his eyes for a moment. "A little bit, yes." He took a breath. "But you have lube and I have patient fingers," he murmured. "We'll be ok."
"John? John!"
Sherlock had realised that John deserved more than he had been giving him so far. He needed to attempt a certain new level of social interaction. With John. Out in John's world with him. Maybe that way they could become more of a normal couple and John would want to stay with him. Because despite the wonderful amounts of sex they had been having, Sherlock realised that there was more to life.
He sat down heavily and Sherlock got in beside him, pulling the door closed with a too-loud 'clunk'. "Baker Street, please," Sherlock told the driver, shrugging down into his seat and resting his head back, closing his eyes.
He sat looking out of the window while Mike was in the toilet. When he came back John would be ready to tell him he was calling it a night. He wasn't rushing home to see Sherlock, he was just tired, that was all. He squinted through the glass to the street - a shadowed figure in a long coat was passing under an awning across the road from the pub. It couldn't be Sherlock, surely? Too much of a coincidence, and he had no reason to be checking up on John. He turned back to his beer and thought no more about it until a woman began trying to attract his attention by asking him about his work, and then it was purely circumstantial that Sherlock entered his head again. Time to go. He stood up and left a tenner on the bar top, headed over to where he could see Mike reappearing and nodded to the front doors when he caught his eye. Mike followed, questioning of course, but John gave his excuses and they parted at the tube station.
"What day is it?" Sherlock asked, groggy, sleepy-voiced.
"Um..."
"You wore the jeans, Sherlock," he whispered.
"Mycroft, he's been hearing rumours apparently. Wanted to warn me off in case I hurt you."
Shopping with Sherlock. At least the day might end on an amusing note.
"I'll keep an eye on her John, you don't have to worry."
"Yes, I really don't know how you manage it, John. Is this really a fulfilling day's work for you? How do you stay awake?"
"Don't let Mycroft, or anyone else, bother you."
I have taken some of Lestrade's speech directly from TSOT in this chapter, because I couldn't resist. Not trying to pretend his words are my own of course!!
"I hate you," John said aloud, and Sherlock gave him a wink before slipping into his room, leaving John wondering what the hell had just happened.
"You're an idiot," John told him fondly, as they started up the stairs. "But meeting you will always be the best thing that ever happened to me."
"Because you are an insatiable romantic yourself John. I've always known it," Sherlock told him. "Now," he said loudly. "Can all of this business wait until the morning? John and I do have plans you know." Mrs Hudson immediately took to her heels and bustled out of the room, holding the door as she waited for Greg.
A hand to his cheek, John closed his eyes again, sighing into the press of Sherlock's palm.
He put a gentle hand against Sherlock's chest, easing him back whilst still clutching him with the other hand. "I need to catch my breath," he said with a chuckle.
"This is it now - come off the drink," he told her quietly. "I'll help you through rehab, but I'm not funding anything else, not anymore." He felt the emotion in his throat before the tears came and Harry took his hand, passed him a tissue.
"Probably not, no," John said immediately.
John frowned at the sharp tone, always immediately put on edge by Sherlock's brother. "What can I do for you, Mycroft?" he said, as he tucked the phone under his chin and carried on with making his lunch. He should have made his sandwiches last night but he was... distracted.
John pulled away the collar of Sherlock's shirt but he already knew he would need to get it off. "Um, do you mind?" he asked carefully. "I need to see the joint."
"Have you two had a falling out?" Mrs Hudson asked, forehead scrunched in sympathy.
"I woke up with my cock in my hand, wishing it was your hand," John told him shakily, heart racing, palms beginning to sweat with the admission, but he kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock's, determined not to let this go.
He sighed out loud, threw back his duvet and thought that at least Sherlock would be fully dressed when he saw him again. Hopefully.
John drew back slightly, frowning at his friend. "No, I'm not."
"I've got you," John said, running a hand slowly down Sherlock's back, marvelling at how smooth and soft his skin was, that he was able to touch now, to revel in the feel of their bodies pressed together. When he had let himself dream of these things, it had never felt like this - he couldn't have imagined how good it would be.
John spat out some toothpaste to cover his surprise. Sherlock was leaning against the door and he moved to sit on the edge of the bath.
"I am, it's ok," John told him.
"Please don't sleep on the sofa again, John."
"Oh, John! What are you doing standing out here? I thought you must be on an all-nighter?" She looked around and added, "Sherlock not with you, dear?"
"Hmm, I was thinking of something a little stronger, but I know I shouldn't," John admitted.
John blinked, lips pursed, completely unable to move, feeling somehow overdressed in a t-shirt and pyjama trousers. He raised a hand stupidly in a small wave and smiled inanely.
So... this wasn't going to be awkward. Not at all.
"Yes," Sherlock said quickly, eyes warm and pure as he met John's.
"I enjoyed it thoroughly," Sherlock said grandiosely, and he looked down to John's hand as John looked at him.
John was so turned on he could only attempt to join in, blindly meeting Sherlock's every move, trying to ensure Sherlock would come back for more.
"Yes, John, show me what else there is, I'm ready," Sherlock said, voice husky, words running over each other.
"You will kill me if you keep that up."
"Oh God," John choked out. "Sherlock-"
Greg stood behind the desk, huge grin on his face, handing over various items in plastic bags, clearly enjoying himself far too much as he returned their possessions.
"No, it's good, Sherlock, sorry, that was involuntary I promise you."
"I want you to move back here," Sherlock said, and that was something John never thought he would hear.
Finally, Sherlock looked back at him. "It didn't go exactly to plan, did it?" he admitted, opening the door to the taxi and holding it for John. "I apologise. It was my suggestion to go into that... fruit bar. I should have agreed when you wanted to flag that taxi down."
Sherlock smiled and they went their separate ways again, John changing quickly in his room before padding back downstairs and seeing both the bathroom and Sherlock's bedroom doorway open.
"I think, we may need to be even closer, if I'm to succeed in my work, as well as in a relationship with you," Sherlock said slowly.
John opened his eyes, blinking in the dim light and a blanket landed on his head.
Meet in the foyer
They held hands until the cab turned into Baker Street and then John reluctantly pulled away to reach for his wallet. He shoved the notes through the little window to the driver, a quick thanks and they were outside on the pavement.
"I wasn't being serious, you know," Sherlock told him softly.
Sherlock was quieter when he spoke again. "John, I feel that I've come to be more aware of certain things, recently. Of your feelings, certainly, of my own feelings-"
"Ok, so what's happened to the heating and why didn't you just light a fire?" he asked as they set off.
He had to be honest with himself now, as well as Sherlock. He knew he liked women; well some of them. Not The Woman certainly. He had never considered a man attractive, not once looked at a man and felt drawn to him in any way other than friendship, comradeship. But then Sherlock arrived in his life and since that day, John felt that he had no real care for another living soul. He dabbled in relationships mainly due to boredom, frustration, desperately trying to avoid acknowledging his real feelings for his friend.
John's eyebrows rose as he pulled his lower lip between his teeth, a slow grin forming. Trust Sherlock to put the blame onto John here. "Would you have listened if I had?"
"Sherlock," he murmured eventually, "I want you." He took Sherlock's face in between his hands in a gentle grasp, waiting until Sherlock opened his eyes before he kissed his lips - pushy, demanding entry, probing and sucking. Their bodies pressed together, perfectly aligned from chest to groin, John could feel Sherlock's movement's against him, sinuous, strong and wanting.
When he got home later there was a blank cheque sitting on the little table by his chair in the living room, a bottle of bleach holding it in place. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John smiled and took the bottle back into the remarkably clean kitchen, returning the cheque to Sherlock's desk drawer before he made himself some tea. Sherlock was too generous and John wouldn't take his money. Not so that his sister could avoid her problems.
John studied his reflection in the mirror on his wardrobe, stifling another yawn. Tired. He just looked perpetually exhausted. He certainly felt it right now after the worst night's sleep in some time. He was certain he had heard the bloody birds singing before he even closed his eyes.
"Broken?" John asked, and Sherlock shook it again.
"What did you tell him?"
"Will you please have a seat?" Sherlock said, directing John into the living room where John could see orange juice and a coffee pot already set out next to the newspapers.
"What time is it?" Sherlock asked as they climbed the stairs, together, slowly.
John coughed a little and smirked.
"Mmm?" John looked down. "I'm not sure..." he said slowly. "Do you want it to be?"
"Look, give me a week, I'll see what I can do." They said goodbye and John slid his thumb across the screen to end the call just as he looked up to see Sherlock standing in the open doorway to the kitchen. He looked concerned about something. "Oh, hi, everything ok?" John asked, as he stood up, slipping his phone into his back pocket.
"That was pleasant, we should make plans for next week, if you'd like?"
"You didn't think this could be your little secret, did you?"
"Sherlock, I have patients to look after, I don't sit here making bloody puppet shows, and asking impossibly rude questions about other people's bathing habits."
Sherlock frowned a little. "I'm not sure what I'm ready for, I really have no idea, I'm sorry."
"Fuck, fuck, Sherlock-"
"Sherlock," he said, slightly slurred. What was in those cocktails? And why the hell had they ended up drinking cocktails anyway? "I am going to kill you."
Finally, Sherlock brought a candle to the table and put down a bowl of salad in the centre. John looked twice at the candle but didn't mention it. When Sherlock had suggested he cook for them both John hadn't dared to think he had anything in mind except some cooking practice. But there it was - a lit candle in between them at the neatly laid dinner table.
But Sherlock hadn't quite cleared up from his latest experiments and John had definitely seen some suspicious jars lined up on the counter earlier. He really, really wanted to believe they weren't there now while Sherlock was chopping carrots, or whatever he was doing.
Finally John pulled back and looked into Sherlock's flushed face. "Oh my God, Sherlock," John gasped out.
wrong. I don't know how I could react that way with you-
John's heart was thudding painfully as he slowly brought the parcel to his front and took a step towards the bed. He dropped it down beside Sherlock - still staring - and muttered, "If it's no good I can return it, just thought you could use it."
"Yes, Mary did mention she was leaving, do you have an application form for the role?"
"I'm sorry, John."
Sherlock wondered how long it would take before John touched him, or whether they would make it back home. Either way, he was enjoying their date very much.
"Are you hungry?" John asked. He was starving.
John didn't want to be in the pub from the minute he sat down with his first pint. Mike was great, he had introduced John to Sherlock, they'd known each other for years, on and off - he was a good friend. But really, right at this moment, John just wanted to be anywhere that Sherlock was. The trouble was he felt that way more often than not these days, and it was disconcerting. Especially now, since he had admitted everything, well, almost everything, to Sherlock. He couldn't discuss his feelings with anyone else though, and he was running out of excuses as to why he wasn't chatting up women.
He saw Sherlock move from the corner of his eye, standing up, moving back a step. John turned hurriedly to him. "I shouldn't have come," Sherlock said, in a rushed half-question. "I... John, you should have said something, I wanted to try and get to know this other side of you, but-"
"We should talk, you know," John said before he could think better of it.
"Hey!"
"I discovered that within a short time, yes. But your sister didn't seem to mind."
John just nodded. He wanted a shower and some decent sleep. He looked over at Sherlock who was shrugging into his coat and apparently refusing to make eye contact with him now. He clearly wasn't up to any sort of discussion either.
Sherlock was smiling now and his eyes were brighter than John had noticed before.
"Yes," Sherlock nodded, lips pouting as he looked down at the table.
"John, please stop talking about what we consumed, I have never eaten so much in one sitting in my life."
"Ok," he said, nodding a little and rubbing at his tired eyes – definitely only watering because it had been a long day, no other reason. "You're right. It's fine. This is fine."
He shook himself, frowning over at Sherlock. "What the hell?" he croaked.
. I started all this. Maybe I needed a bit of help," he conceded, "while you worked through your stuff." While John's own feelings deepened and he tried to work out what he would do if Sherlock didn't come into his arms... "But it's ok, we're ok.
"You will," Sherlock told him, and John wanted to believe him.
Sherlock carried on despite his outburst. "You are drinking more, since we began to... have a physical relationship," he said slowly.
He ordered garlic bread and made sure Sherlock ate some too. Sherlock seemed less able to relax the longer they sat there and spent most of the time looking out of the window, only looking at John to answer a question. Instead of feeling irritated though, John could only admire his friend. He was putting himself through these awkward experiences and although John didn't fully understand why, he appreciated it. Trying to get him to talk about something other than work proved to be tricky. John decided to give up on trying to engage him and talked randomly about his day instead, laughing to himself about how many times his receptionist had needed to stop an elderly man from barging straight into the surgery, ending up more stressed than John by the end of the morning. Eventually, John realised that Sherlock was watching him, just looking at him, arms folded, slight smile on his lips. John smiled back, pleased that he had managed to get his friend to relax a little. Angelo brought out their food and they each had pasta in a pesto cream sauce. It was delicious.
"You never have to worry about that. It's all in your hands. And I'm fine with that," John added, sincerely.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can't even send a text to let me know where you are? Or how about damn-well asking me for help once in a while? We're meant to have each other's backs, isn't that the point? We're a partnership." But even as the words came out he knew, it was a futile argument. They had never declared it to be anything other than a working thing. John had no hold over this man. He knew it, even as Sherlock looked at him in a way that made John want to cry. John took a breath, no idea what more to add.
John picked up a Bourbon and looked at it instead of his landlady. "Is it just me, Mrs Hudson, or is Sherlock making more of an effort these days?"
"Where there's something to regret I'll be the first to admit it, John."
glad... I'm just being an idiot. Stay, please."
Sherlock's head rested on the back of his chair and John took a deep breath and put his knee to the carpet, balancing himself.
"What d'you mean, twelve hours? John, I need tea!"
Sherlock rounded the bed and pulled back the covers, watching John as he stood there. Finally he moved, well-aware of his lack of clothes when the air reached his damp parts as he closed the door.
Still watching John he made a quick motion with his hand and murmured, "The same, please." Angelo moved off with a thank you from John. "What is it?" Sherlock asked softly.
Sherlock looked into his eyes, fingers digging into John's hips, not allowing him to move away. "Yes," he said again, nodding intently. "Please, John."
(whispering desperately)
John is relieved these two are acting civilly towards each other. Rosie climbs off John's lap and onto Sherlock's lap.
INT. SWANKY RESTAURANT - TUESDAY EVENING
SHERLOCK
John lets out a laugh.
John rises and starts pacing around. Sherlock watches him a bit anxiously.
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
After a bit more giggling, they finally settle into sleep.
(exhausted)
SHERLOCK
Yes. You certainly do prefer it "fast and hard" over "long and slow", don't you?
I'm not a germaphobe!
ROSIE (V.O.)
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
LESTRADE
(truly confused)
Your scent. Your natural aroma.
- The group of four eat and chat around the kitchen table in 221B. Takeaway containers are staggered across the tabletop.
(truly shocked)
Yeah, sure.
Inspector Lestrade smiles uncertainly in the vestibule. Audrey and the teacher glare at him. Rosie and Dorian are in the background playing in the classroom.
The things I'll do to you tonight, John...
Sherlock inserts it carefully as John coughs out a series of moans.
Three, four times a day. On average.
SHERLOCK
Eurus. It's me, Sherlock. I've brought Mycroft with me today.
MOLLY
(a little shocked)
he thought. His phone buzzed and he almost didn't pick it up, but curiosity got the better of him, as it always did.
John throws back his head in chagrin.
Having found his target, Sherlock picks up the pace, thrusting more firmly into John.
Sherlock suddenly stops and turns to Molly.
John. Finger me.
(taken aback, glancing down the path)
SHERLOCK
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - UPSTAIRS STAIRWELL /LANDING - MONDAY MORNING
SHERLOCK
Well this IS Sherlock we are talking about. It's nearly impossible to keep a surprise from him.
"Okay," he said, yawning and turning on his side.
I have no idea, Sherlock. Can I continue please?
(in desperation)
What do you want to do tonight to help you feel more relaxed? Putter about in your laboratory? Watch some crap telly with me?
John kept his face close to Sherlock's, observing him closely.
May I?
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
to deposit a kiss on his lips. The kiss deepened, and the men's touches became more fervent. Hands drifted to waistbands.
No... merely here for friendly chat.
(opening one eye and fixing it on Sherlock)
SHERLOCK AND JOHN
(with a smile)
INT. SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
"Perhaps we can try again at home," Sherlock offered. John chuckled at this.
(with renewed determination)
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - JOHN AND ROSIE'S ROOM - SATURDAY NIGHT
Maybe. Maybe.
"Failed relationships"? As if you ever cared about such things! "Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock." Remember?
Molly is too stunned to speak for a moment.
SHERLOCK
(silkily)
Sherlock nods in understanding. John rubs a hand across Sherlock's chest and rests it above Sherlock's heart, checking for an irregular heartbeat. Sherlock can't help smiling at John looking out for his health.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - FRIDAY - EARLY EVENING
MRS HUDSON
SHERLOCK
Oh, I'm sorry, were you there when I was shot and in recovery? Know everything about it, don't you?
John kisses the back of Sherlock's head affectionately.
Definitely not stepping out for a smoke or anything.
Perhaps you're just not sexually aroused by me, no matter how much you might like to be...
How would it even work, Sherlock? Is there even room for three here?
SHERLOCK
(impressed)
Yeah, well... it was all very one-sided, wasn't it?
And I can go as fast or slow, as hard or soft as you want, Sherlock.
MRS HUDSON
John bends down to lick Sherlock's bell-end once again. With a cry, Sherlock rocks his hips upward.
(calmly)
So pudgy.
I'm sure your purpose will reveal itself eventually, John. Bumbling into the key to the solution, isn't that your forte?
Nothing?
ROSIE
"Fine. Ah! Here's our drinks. Thank you, dear." Sherlock simpered to the waiter while John bristled at his side. Sherlock took a quick swig out of his glass and stood up, adjusting his outfit.
(snidely)
See, it didn't take long to recover, did it?
SHERLOCK
And if you do a good job with your dinner, we'll go find a biscuit at my place. Your father won't mind.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock, it's our first time like this... I couldn't stand myself if you got hurt.
STD testing, Sherlock.
Love in the abstract or how it pertains to you personally?
(in a rough whisper)
SHERLOCK
No, Audrey's doing that and should be here any minute.
SHERLOCK
When Sherlock only response is more staring, John elaborates.
INT. 221B BAKER STREET - SHERLOCK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sherlock huffs and shakes his head no.
It not about necessity, I'd just really, really --
No, I've grown accustomed to them now.
John rolls his eyes knowing Sherlock has probably already solved the case and is just toying with him.
SHERLOCK
He is very protective of you, darling.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
(fuming)
What? I take everything to the cleaners.
He pauses and inhales deeply. He texts her again: I'M IN LOVE WITH JOHN
-- Awful!
All right, that's quite enough of that.
Audrey bursts out laughing. The kids in the strollers start giggling as well.
John is at Sherlock's side.
John stops outside the door, pulls out the scratch paper from his pocket, and confirms that he has the correct address. As he is about to enter the shop, he spots some handbills and flyers in the window. He taps on one for the London Symphony Orchestra. He takes a pen out of his coat pocket and scribbles down some notes. He pockets the pen and paper and enters the shop.
SHERLOCK
"Yes, it's fine. More than fine, really."
"To the sofa, John."
(over his shoulder)
Come, John. We need shower sex.
SHERLOCK
How much pressure are you using?
I don't think that's possible!
We don't have to stop. It's not triggered by physical stimuli, just emotional.
It's the development of other parts of our relationship that I find myself struggling with.
SHERLOCK
John suddenly closes his eyes and sits back on his haunches with an agitated sigh.
A few questions about tonight.
John leaves. Sherlock remains standing in the middle of the kitchen, lost in thought about all that has transpired.
SHERLOCK
They sat in silence during the cab ride home, each gazing out of their respective windows. Although, to Sherlock's surprise, John ran a steady knuckle up and down the side of Sherlock's thigh. Sherlock reveled in the tingly desire it generated in him.
Yes, very stinky, Rosie. And where is that stinky father of yours, by the way? He should be home by now.
He froze. He turned and found Sherlock standing close behind him. John thought he spotted Mrs. Hudson gently shutting the door to 221 Baker Street in the background. Sherlock took a moment to gather himself together before speaking.
SHERLOCK
Are you thinking Madame Imelda brewed a concoction to kill her clients? But why would she kill herself then?
(chuckling, wiping away more tears)
John turns back.
Sherlock still paces and can't meet John's gaze.
MOLLY
But Sherlock is long gone.
SHERLOCK
(half-asleep, satisfied with blanket)
We've been friends for over a decade now. Been through quite a lot during that time. That'll affect things.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
"Okay, your turn on the dance floor," commanded Sherlock.
"Why not?" John exclaimed, "You'll either end up going home with multiple dates, or get thrown out for being a perv, that's why!"
Oh...
I don't mind it as much coming from you.
Yes, I'd say so. Some fairly significant occasions of him manipulating me emotionally, I'd say.
SHERLOCK
Irene: It better be John.
Mrs. Hudson bursts out laughing.
NAZIR
SHERLOCK
Sherlock sets a rhythm, bobbing up and down on John's cock. Sherlock uses the fingertips of his left hand to caress John's scrotum, while his right hand freely explores the cleft of John's arse. John stiffens when Sherlock's fingertip presses up against his arsehole.
It’s the perfect puddle splashing spot, is it not?
SHERLOCK
NAZIR
(a little surprised)
(pulling away)
(joking slightly)
There you are! Now, I really must be going. I am sorry about last night. It's sweet you care so much.
INT. NEW SCOTLAND YARD - GREG'S OFFICE - WEDNESDAY - MIDDAY
(chuckling)
Yes! Please!
MYCROFT
This and more.
AUDREY
(aghast)
John looks over at Sherlock bravely.
. John was being more astute than normal.
Molly and Nazir watch him dash out.
Nice work, Nazir. Of course, I thought of that... but I've checked all their credit card transactions and there's nothing.
(loudly)
Shh, shh. You're exhausted, remember? Go to sleep.
If you say so, doctor.
Sherlock rises to his feet and John immediately lies down, taking up the whole sofa.
SHERLOCK
John shrugged and said petulantly, "Talk."
Would you really, honestly, like that, Sherlock? For me to spend the night tonight?
Obviously not, brother mine.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
John peers into Sherlock's face. Sherlock's expression is deadly serious, anxious.
SHERLOCK
What?
How vain you must think I am, John.
Pardon? What do you mean by "urgent", exactly?
The medics had to work, Sherlock!
SHERLOCK
It's okay?
No! Too good! You need to turn it off right now!
John hustles to get out breakfast and items for Rosie's packed lunch. He looks over at Sherlock, questioningly.
(looking at her softly)
(scoffing)
(deeply)
SHERLOCK
IRENE
John looks confused.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock scoops up Rosie protectively. She squeals with delight.
John tugs on Sherlock's robe collar to bring Sherlock's mouth closer to his own, kissing him again. This kiss is longer, more intense. John's hand travels the nape of Sherlock's neck and into his dark curls. Sherlock, unsure of what to do with his hands, finally settles them on John's hips. Sherlock gently presses his body into John as the kiss continues.
Sherlock plunges back in and starts up a stronger pace. John keens with pleasure.
IRENE
Let's see... Cheekbones, lips, neck, luscious curls, tight shirts, seductive eyes, legs for days, nice booty if they're looking close enough... giant prick if they are really looking close enough...
Scratch that, you are both equally bad... sneaking cigarettes left and right... and neither of you have ever been able to say no to a piece of cake.
Your war wound. Is it sensitive?
ADLER:  SWEET DREAMS LUV
Sherlock, you must give up those silly notions of what you think romantic love should look like and feel like. What you and John have is different. This is mature love we are talking about... it's more subtle, much more durable.
Hmph.
Two solid months, Molly.
SHERLOCK
They eye each other carefully.
It's hardly necessary, Dr. Herscher. Mycroft already knows everything. And my life is routinely splashed across the newspapers as well as John's blog.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock's mobile text alert sounds: "Ahhhh!" Everyone turns to look at Sherlock in shock.
Sherlock regards him softly before getting back into bed and snuggling up to John, with Sherlock's head on John's chest.
Yeah, I'll need to let you finish washing up on your own because apparently I can't even bloody touch you in the shower without going rigid.
(impishly)
Sherlock takes a doll off his chair and points to its bare foot.
SHERLOCK (O.S. OFF SCREEN)
I’ll require more equipment than I currently have at home, and I assume Irene would appreciate that we refrain from involving the police at this juncture --
MRS HUDSON
(to Sherlock)
Oh Sherlock!
Sherlock!
MONTAGE - FAMILY EVENING AT HOME
- John feeds and talks to Rosie in the kitchen. Sherlock sticks his head in to observe them momentarily (they don't notice him). Sherlock grins, pleased with his new flatmates, and leaves unnoticed.
(whispering)
Carefully, John. Slowly.
And one for you.
(sighing haughtily)
(in thought)
John grabs the phone off the nightstand and hands it to Sherlock. John sits back down on the bed next to him.
Really? And that works?
END OF FLASHBACK - RETURN TO PRESENT - SHERLOCK'S BEDROOM
Sherlock's breath hitches as he says this. He grabs John's hips for leverage as his body takes over and he pounds rhythmically and hard into his beloved's sweet arse. John matches the stroking of his cock with Sherlock's intense thrusts.
SHERLOCK
So, Sherlock, where did John take you? I'm dying to know. John wouldn't even give me a hint!
(giggling)
You act like I wasn't trying to get a reaction from you all weekend long.
Well, rainy Saturday, laundry day...
(in hushed tones)
Exactly. And if Human Resources gets wind of a non-employee harassing one of their staff members... well, things could go very badly for you, Holmes. Your morgue privileges stripped, for starters.
All right. I'm going to use the loo. Brush my teeth. Get dressed. I'll be back in a jiffy.
(deflecting the compliment)
SHERLOCK
DR HERSCHER
Well, no worries. Mum and Dad are joining me this time.
He kisses Sherlock's neck, then moves to the collarbone, the shoulder, the pectorals. Sherlock's eyes roll up with pleasure, but he still has lingering concerns.
Love you!
Blimey!
John opens his laptop. Sherlock kneels on the bed behind John, looking over John's shoulder.
Understood.
John exhales in despair. His head resting on Sherlock's chest feels like the safest spot for him to say what needs to be said.
Assume the position, Dr Watson.
(a bit embarrassed)
IRENE
Sherlock groans loudly and rolls over in agitation. John waits for Sherlock to settle back into sleep.
Where do you get all this energy for intercourse, John?
Yes. Yes, I would.
MEDIC #2
SHERLOCK
No! Sherlock, no. I just wanted us to slow down a bit.
Sherlock looks grieve to hear this.
(gasping)
Sherlock!
Finish up breakfast Rosie, we have a big day ahead of us.
Sherlock looks at him, dismayed.
That was at a particularly bad time in my life, and I felt... I believed... you and I didn't stand a chance. No chance at all.
ADLER:  TRY FLIRTING
John continues undoing the shirt buttons.
SHERLOCK
Audrey shoots him a disappointed look.
It was a wonderful meal and a lovely chat with Mrs. Hudson. All too soon, it was time for John and Rosie to leave. John hoped to have her home before naptime.
John rubs his face and paces around.
SHERLOCK
Rosie!
(more steadily)
(gesturing to the tissues)
Of course you are, dear.
But when exactly?
SHERLOCK
Ahhh!
Yes, I'll make it simple for everyone. I'll stop my sessions with you. No need to bother John with any of this. He started working with you first, after all.
Yes, very much so.
Does she use any candles in her sessions? To create ambiance and whatnot?
SHERLOCK
Hmph.
(See the end of the chapter for
Please, John. Permit me.
Yes. That was something. A bit hard to take, that was.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock yawns. John lifts his head and regards Sherlock's face.
SHERLOCK
ANGELINE
NEED TO INVESTIGATE THE UNI ROOMMATE
MYCROFT
Damn it, Sherlock. We know it's not your fault, you and your sensitive heart... but damn it, you are cockblocking yourself and everyone else.
You never know.
SHERLOCK
John pauses to text Sherlock back.
She points to a burned-out light bulb in the overhead lamp.
(sighing slightly)
SHERLOCK
John chuckles and smiles appreciatively at Sherlock's joke. Sherlock has a small smile on his face. John and Sherlock gaze at each other for another moment.
Lie on your side. I want to try something, John.
The room grew very quiet.
He plops down a brown paper gift bag on an exam table. Molly looks at it suspiciously as she walks over.
SHERLOCK
John's hips thrust up, but Sherlock is prepared; dutifully working John's cock to climax.
DR HERSCHER
John retrieves a rice cooker from a cabinet.
Sherlock curls his body and reaches up to give John a deep kiss. It catches John by surprise, but in the best possible way. When the kiss is over, Sherlock's head flops back on the pillow and John continues to plow into him. John doesn't have the concentration for experimenting anymore: desire and instinct have taken over and his thrusts come more quickly now.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Rosie runs back into the kitchen.
SHERLOCK
Hello, Irene.
Sherlock tries in vain to pull John out of his chair.
Well, if you are comfortable with it and don't feel it would betray their trust, you could share what advice they had for you. Perhaps it would also serve as an avenue to express your own thoughts about your boyfriend's feelings for you.
John exits the change room in the spiffy outfit to check himself out in the long mirror and the clerk rushes over with a gasp.
You assume correctly.
What?
SHERLOCK
Molly pulls a dildo from the bag.
Brother mine, that is you and John to a tee.
(blowing a kiss)
Noxious fumes of some kind? Carbon monoxide?
John cocks an eyebrow at Sherlock and leans over to the side table and checks the time on his phone. He looks crossly at it and sits up.
Get in.
Sherlock hissed internally in vexation.
John began again, "Why am I always the last to know, hm?"
DR HERSCHER
FLASHBACK - INT. MRS. HUDSON'S KITCHEN - EVENING ("A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA")
So, what side of the bed do you sleep on?
(reading it aloud)
We can fix that.
Sherlock, let me know when I can move.
Sherlock ran a thumb across his lips and knitted his brow.
John returns from a jog to find the sitting room turned into a blanket fort. He can hear Rosie giggling within. John sits down cross-legged on the floor next to the entrance of the fort.
Dr. Herscher smiles, amused.
John glances at his watch.
(playfully)
SHERLOCK
(pausing)
SHERLOCK
(gathering self together)
SHERLOCK
Sherlock looks startled.
SHERLOCK
Yes. Erm. There's a distinct lack of shagging going on. Well, there IS, but it's very lopsided.
MYCROFT
It is not a very mature way to deal with my emotions, I admit. Albeit, dealing with my emotions has never been my forte.
Not when you are trying to give your boyfriend a mind-blowing orgasm, it's not.
I think you overplay your significance in her life.
SHERLOCK
Of course it is!
Hush now.
Hello? Yes, I'm him.
SHERLOCK
SHERLOCK
Sherlock tries to hide his delight at her praise.
(breathing into Sherlock's ear)
Understood. What else?
(grumpily)
Yes, I'm either a "complete machine" or "a bit overly-sensitive" as people are fond to point out to me. Frankly, I think it makes me a better detective. But, let me be clear, I'm under no illusion that we have the exact same level of sexual attraction to each other.
Sherlock, really, that's so... personal.
ADLER:  YOU'RE CLEVER. I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
I doubt it.
John contemplates Sherlock for a moment, and then leans over with his head next to Sherlock's ear.
Unlike laundry, I am not totally useless in the kitchen, John. You'll find I'm excellent at chopping things. Big dice is one-centimeter cubed, small dice is a half-centimeter cubed, minced is two-millimeters cubed. Which do you want?
No, the agreement was that we shouldn't spend EVERY night together. By my calculations it has, in fact, been several nights since we've slept in the same bed.
I'm going to visit Eurus tomorrow.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
(quietly)
John looks up wonderingly at Sherlock. Sherlock responds with an impish grin. John reaches over to the nightstand for lubricant, gloves, and condoms. John squeezes lube out on his left hand. Sherlock watches everything carefully.
Sherlock reached for one of John's hands, brought it to his mouth and kissed the fingertips, murmuring, "You can touch as well as look, John." He placed John's palm on his chest. The look of wonder and desire on John's face was deliciously fetching, and Sherlock just
Mummy! Loo! Loo!
SHERLOCK
Uggghh!
Sherlock glides his tongue along John's shaft once more, making John shudder one last time.
Well, I'll certainly need a nicotine patch now. Probably two. Thanks a lot, John.
AUDREY
END MONTAGE
(serious again)
Mrs. Hudson!!
MRS HUDSON
John kisses Sherlock with adoration. He lets go of Sherlock's coat reluctantly.
John straightens his legs on the bed and lies back reluctantly, still lifting his head to watch Sherlock work. He doesn't want to miss a thing.
Sherlock puts his book down again, giving John the same perplexed look as before.
I hardly know what to think anymore.
LESTRADE
You barely give me any notice of these Sherrinford outings, you know.
Erm, nothing really. You picking up Rosie is help enough, believe me.
(leaning towards Sherlock)
Well! Now that we've had an opportunity to exchange pleasantries, let's get down to the matter at hand, shall we? Irene, do enlighten us about the case.
John clears his throat and looks down again, unable to meet Sherlock's eyes.
Or you, trying to carry on a frivolous conversation with John's obnoxious boy--
It'll be fine.
It reads: I'M JUST CHECKING IN
His stroking increases in frequency and pressure, his hand closing over the tip of his cock and sliding roughly down to the base over and over. John's body begins to shudder; he moans quietly, rhythmically, with the intensity of it all. All too soon, John's orgasm comes fast and hard.
Have a nice time sleeping in your own bed tonight!
Yeah, but it's much bigger. And heavy.
I feel like I owe you a huge apology.
SHERLOCK
John?
Did you get good sleep, John? While I was gone?
NAZIR
Sherlock! Your... er... shopping bag!
SHERLOCK
Sherlock goes tight-lipped.
John finishes washing the dishes and removes his rubber gloves. He crosses the kitchen, turns off the light, and enters...
Bye-bye!
SHERLOCK
John stares her down angrily.
Riiiight. I'm sure that's it. Carry on.
As I am right-handed, I will need it for the... delicate work... so I will put my left hand at the base... firmly?
Sherlock quickly sets down Dorian and rushes to John, fussing over him.
Okay.
Oh lord, listen to this Audrey! "How will I know how to dress if you don't tell me where we're going?"
Packing up the diaper bag, John lifted the library book out of the cardboard box.
John raises the umbrella to cover both their heads. Sherlock gazes down softly at John. John glances away shyly.
And you’re welcome.
LESTRADE
MYCROFT
Sherlock gets quiet. So does Dr. Herscher.
Oh, yeah, good idea. I'll be sure to get us some.
Okay, just take it.
(reaching into bag and pulling out a box)
SHERLOCK
FLASHBACK - INT. BANQUET HALL - WATSON WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT ("THE SIGN OF THE THREE")
John, alarmed that Mrs. Hudson can hear, quickly looks towards the kitchen. She has, in fact, heard everything, but she bustles around the kitchen pretending she hasn't.
(low but firm)
Okay, but no sneaking off this time.
SHERLOCK
John would want to be prepared though. He wouldn't want to run the risk of the tickets running out. No, he's reserved them under an assumed name, and he's picking them up today. He couldn't pick them up any earlier or I would have sniffed them out.
"What do you mean, you have a date?" Lestrade had the tone and expression of complete disbelief, and Sherlock just smiled.
Sherlock sighed a little and seemed to relax further under John's weight, still holding him close. He joined the kiss, searching out John's lips and John struggled to stay still on top of him. He would need to move, any minute now or this would become awkward. He just couldn't stop kissing those lips.
Where was he going wrong?
. "Wear these again? Please?" John said.
John watched with interest as Sherlock's lithe body stretched out beside him. "Hmm," he murmured. "Fire's gone out." They were slouched comfortably together, feet touching ever-so-slightly on the coffee table in front of them. "Should get some more blankets in here," he thought aloud.
"Well, I think you maybe should, that man was
But he did allow a tiny spark to ignite, marvelling over the thought that Sherlock might actually, seriously, be considering this - considering them.
He groaned into Sherlock's mouth, needing and wanting and holding his entire body back from pushing beyond Sherlock's limits. Sherlock held him fast and John took whatever he gave with pleasure. When they parted Sherlock was breathing hard and John had never seen him look so rumpled and downright sexy in all his dreams.
"I have a late surgery, won't be back before eight," John called out again, but there was no response this time. He pulled a yellow sticky off the pad by the fridge and wrote out a quick note:
John managed to gently disentangle himself and reached for Sherlock's hand, rather more discreetly holding it close beside their bodies. Although by this point there was no need to be discreet.
John read the text vaguely before putting his phone down and continuing on with his paperwork. Must be a case, but Sherlock hadn't mentioned anything. Still, it wasn't unusual for something to crop up that Sherlock simply
"And it's remarkably different is it, to having intercourse with a woman?"
"The perfect amount I'd say," Sherlock replied, voice deepened by said alcohol, John supposed, or maybe he was just tired, he clearly wasn't quite himself.
"Do you need any?" Sherlock asked seriously.
Sherlock turned back to him on the stairs. "I can't believe that for a moment," he said.
When they were alone again, when Sherlock had made tea and John felt a little calmer, he knew they had to talk about it. But he still didn't want to.
But John ploughed on into whatever territory this was...
"Oh, nice, a single?" John turned to look through the tiny barred window behind him and caught sight of the officer shaking his head at them both.
"Oh, on the house Sherlock, of course!"
His busy morning was made worse by several missed calls from Harry. He couldn't respond so he had to keep her in the back of his mind all day and hope that she had received the cash the other week and was just calling to say thanks.
"John, I want to say something, and I feel that I'm the best person to say this, because we spend so much time together. I'm not being fair to you by allowing you to drink so much."
Sherlock frowned harder and he slowly shook his head. "No," he finally said, and John had never experienced the thing his chest did at that moment.
Seeing Sherlock here, seeing he was ok, getting better at least, it helped. A tiny amount, but it did help.
"I don't think we'll make it," John said softly, "do you?"
Sherlock freed a hand from under the sheet and reached out to run his fingers along John's arm, shoulder to elbow - leaving goosebumps, raising John's pulse - trailing along his forearm to where John's hand rested on the pillow. Sherlock's fingers closed around his and John jerked a little at the tickle on his palm, at the unexpected touch.
*sneaks in with final update after 7 months*
John took a shaky breath, thanked him and walked heavily across to his chair. He could have done with one of Sherlock's crazy experiments to take his mind off things. He would settle for tea and just sitting with his friend for a while. Sherlock seemed to know just what he needed and it wasn't long before they were discussing a recent case and John could start to unwind.
"She didn't ask for money," Sherlock clarified. "She did ask whether we were a couple."
John smiled, hiding the disappointment that Sherlock hadn't imagined that they were on a date, even if just for the experience of it. He did appreciate Sherlock's easy manner and the confirmation that he was making about their friendship.
"Specifically asked not to be disturbed."
John withdrew from the kiss with an unintended slurping sound. He leaned up on his elbow, chewing on his bottom lip, staring at Sherlock as he held John's other hand in place. "Oh, nice," he said, grinning.
"Of course, yes, very much so."
"I'll take this side," Sherlock conceded, as he sat down on the edge of the bed. "Will you join me?" he added softly.
Sherlock made a perfect 'O' with his mouth. "Oh, I see," he said.
"I do John, I have no concerns about your intentions."
They settled into a corner table, Angelo brought out his candles but Sherlock stopped him. "Not necessary, thank you," he said. As an aside to John, he added, "I don't want to make you uncomfortable, John."
say?"
He didn't even look around. "Good time?" he murmured.
"But... my tea!" Sherlock complained, still clutching the kettle as if it could help him now.
"So, this is where you spend your time."
Sherlock didn't leave his mind as John prepared for bed, when he lay down, his hand rubbing over his cock as he closed his eyes. Sherlock was right there while he stroked himself through his underwear, watching John, just watching while John's hand went inside his pants, his fingers gripping in just the right place to get himself off as fast as possible.
He held Sherlock close and rubbed his feet against Sherlock's calves. "'Morning," he answered softly.
Sherlock shuffled over and kissed him, wrapping around him and caressing John's cheek. "I think we may have missed dinner."
SHERLOCK
(smiling sweetly)
(commanding)
Oh, that one... it has been a while since I've worn that one. Not sure where it is?
Oh! Hello, Mrs. Hudson, didn't see you there. Not a problem.
These drug rings get violent and destructive in a hurry, Sherlock... we'd be preventing a lot of lives from getting ruined.
I don't know exactly why he hasn't said it back to you yet, Sherlock. I know it must be disheartening. What was his reaction when you told him you loved him?
That's not actually helpful. Or possible. Some of those things were mutually exclusive. A relationship can't be both casual and serious at the same time, for one.
(sternly)
Oh, John!
LESTRADE
Sherlock nods in confirmation.
Sherlock looks crushed. So does John, for that matter.
Sherlock's only response in one cocked eyebrow. John regards him for a moment and begins to feel guilty.
