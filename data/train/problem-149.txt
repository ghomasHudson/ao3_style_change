For a few moments, they silently cling to one another, swaying to the music of the storm. Sherlock's presence makes everything beautiful. The rain becomes tranquil. The wind becomes invigorating; the air thick and sweet like honey.
"Good." Sherlock smiles sinfully at him before returning to their kiss; desperate and open mouthed and depraved.
Moriarty gestures to his coat pocket; she eases her grip, allowing him to retrieve his cell phone. As he types, she keeps her eyes close and her blade closer.
"It's fine, Sherlock. " John smiles tightly. "I'm fine. I don't need to know. You aren't entitled to share your past with me."
“Ah.” John turns his body to face his, blocking him from proceeding. “Well, considering I pay for half of it, perhaps we can share?”
Was it Einstein who said that the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and hoping for different results? John stares at the entryway for a few seconds, thinking about his warm bed. Ultimately choosing to risk madness, he walks into the bar.
John moves his gaze to the sofa, where yet another woman is seated. He wasn’t expecting a fourth—although she seems vaguely familiar. She’s thin, with fair skin and dark brown hair, and she’s dressed simply in a black jumper and black slacks.
"It's not what you think," John reassures him. "I'm simply being polite. It doesn't take much effort to be friendly. Or to read a name badge, for that matter."
It takes both of them a moment to process what’s just happened; finally, Sherlock peels his lips away from John’s.
They tear through the sky, welcomed by pink and white cotton candy clouds. Wrapped up in each other, their hearts in their throats, they feel the purest joy. It swells in their chest, threatening to burst open like a monsoon rain. The building above them grows smaller, and they leave one life behind, rising from the ashes to begin their lives together anew.
“God." Sarah curiously sets her hand over the letters. "I don’t know, but I’m beginning to feel pretty weirded out. We should probably go."
"Pistachio?" Sherlock repeats, gracefully tossing his belongings to the ground and whisking himself off the sofa. "Wait. Since when do you bake macarons?"
Sherlock extends his arm towards the wall behind John and leans against it for balance. With the leverage, he continues to steer his hips forwards and backwards, rubbing their naked cocks together. The friction it creates is sublime. John exhales shakily, his eyes twisting shut. The room becomes filled with every sigh and moan that isn't captured by their mouths sliding together ravenously.
Later, John wakes up again, and the room is completely dark, and he’s not alone. Sherlock is settling into the bed next to him, getting beneath the covers.
“So happy indeed!” Sherlock bats his eyelashes at John coquettishly. At this point, he’s simply playacting. “If you really love me, John, you’ll get me the beautiful blood succulent!”
He only wishes he had something to stimulate his brain. A new case, perhaps. It would be a welcome distraction from the only thing that seems to be on his mind: John Watson. At the moment, the only temporary relief is the annoying daily text message he receives from his brother.
Once John joins the table, he receives a warm welcome from Marci and Elizabeth, two American students studying accounting at UMass Boston. Marci takes a liking to him immediately; she pats the seat next to her in invitation, and John accepts, sliding in beside her.
John quickly collects himself, letting go of William’s collar. “Doesn’t matter. Just...look, this isn’t about me, alright? It’s my friend’s birthday, and I’d like to buy him a drink or two. So could you just get over this...whatever it is...and make a bloody Crown and Coke? And an Old Fashioned for me, if it’s not terribly inconvenient of me to ask that you do your job?”
This is why he treads through twenty centimetres of snow, through empty streets, because nobody else in Boston is enough of a nutter to be outdoors. This is how he braves the bitter wind and snow, making his way slowly towards The Strand, regretting every decision he’s ever made in his life.
“I think Molly’s right,” Marci chimes in. “What’s done is already done. John has already fucked himself over by being here. If he’s in danger, he may as well understand what he’s in danger of.”
“I’ve given you my contact information,” she says. “If you need anything, you can call. We’ll be here in a heartbeat.”
John glances away from the television screen and up at Sherlock. "Hi." His expression is worried and amused at the same time. "You alright, there?"
With that, she ventures outside and into the blistering cold, leaving John and William alone in the silent, empty bar.
“John.” Sarah’s voice is stern enough that John finally glances up at her. “Have you even been to Vegas before? It’s probably not a good idea to pursue a dangerous situation like this on your own, especially with little knowledge of the city…”
John kisses his crown of curls and holds onto him tightly. “I’ve got you,” he says. “Let go. You’re safe, Sherlock. No more guilt or shame or fear of what may come.”
He loves this even more than he thought he would; he quickly knows how easily this could become an addiction. And John seems to be loving it just as much as he does, his pelvic floor tense, his arm shielding his face from crying out, the twitching rings of his arsehole.
He takes both of her hands into his, looking her in the eye with unbridled gratitude. “No words can express how grateful I am.” He places a quick kiss onto the back of her hand. “Thank you. I will never forget this.”
“Home.” John feels a rush of bliss spread through his chest. “Our home, correct? In the year—“ he ventures a guess. “Eighteen hundred and—“
William loosens his grip on him—but he doesn’t let go entirely. He leans away, his gaze falling to the ground.
”I don’t understand, John. You’re in my presence constantly. In fact, you’ve been sitting across from me for most of the evening, where I have been well within your sight range. Do I not look the same as always?”
The pleasure burns into John. His fingers curl against Sherlock’s back, and he digs his fingernails into his skin.  Sherlock doesn’t break eye contact as he slowly pushes in deeper, the look on his face becoming more passionate still.
She laughs again. She’s got a nice smile. She comes off as shy, and proper, and pleasant, but John is entirely sure that she can curse like a sailor, and could probably drink him under a table.
So the two men lie next to one another in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Predictably, they say nothing.
And yet, his friend sits in his armchair across from him, gaze unwavering, sapphire eyes twinkling as though he said it on
Who knew that attention from John could be so addictive? And in true addict form, Sherlock wants every bit of it—which seems to work in his favour, because tonight, John is giving it all to him.
“You love me,” Sherlock states. Though his voice is timid, the words feel like sweet honey on his tongue.
"Sherlock," he utters breathlessly. "I swear to you, you are the most exquisite thing I've ever laid eyes on."
John's studying to be a doctor. There's a lot he knows about putting together a seemingly unrelated series of clues in order to form a hypothesis. In the practice of diagnoses, there's a balance of skill, knowledge, and reasoning—but John can't find any semblance of reason here.
Once Gabriela comes, her voice becomes muffled once again—John can only imagine that Irene is back to straddling her face, rocking against her until she can take one final orgasm from Gabriela’s tongue.
John rests back in his seat, watching his craft. “You’d be surprised. Most bartenders around here don’t have any idea.”
“Who?” John reaches for William’s sheet and attempts to cover their bodies. He glances around the room they're in. The walls are bright white and mostly barren, other than a few framed portraits of people who appear to be royals. “Where are we?” he asks.
Molly gives him a playful punch on the shoulder. “I’m good. And Sherlock’s not with us, unfortunately, but he’s safe.”
Mycroft leans away, releasing John’s hand, giving him an unveiled look of disapproval. “It isn’t over yet, Watson,” he says. “Far from it.”
“You saved me the pain of having to do it myself,” she finishes. “And you owed me absolutely nothing, but I can’t tell you how much of a relief it was.”
One moment, he wanted to kick William in the shins for embarrassing him and his friends. And the next moment, the two were practically fucking on the bathroom counter with their clothes on.
Sherlock beams at him. "Oh, yes! You're right! That's fantastic, John! You've got your memory back!"
John takes his head into his hands, kissing him firmly on the lips. "You are incredible," he says. "Thank you."
"Hello!” comes a woman's voice, bright and peppy, from the other side. "I'm just here to record your vitals."
And the love he has for Sherlock fills him up whole; fills his body and brain, and soul, and somehow surges far beyond that.
Although they forgo their typical evening routine, they eventually fall into their natural form: John’s face in the curve between Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, Sherlock’s chin resting atop John’s head. Between this, and stolen kisses, and flirtatious grins and hushed laughter—they slowly retrieve their clothing, piece by piece.
"Same thing, really." John turns another page. "You just have to learn to breathe through your feet. And there are a hell of a lot more Journey songs."
John looks at Sherlock adoringly, thanking him for being so thoughtful. He’s not faking a thing, although Sherlock doesn’t need to know that.
“Nothing is ever certain,” John says. “But I will most certainly be there for him as long as I am able.”
"Right. Well. I suppose I could go shower.” John sits up, moves to the edge of the bed, and leans down to collect his clothing.
“Wow! Same here.” Sherlock blows out a breath of air. “Anyway, I’m starving, and the bag of crisps in the kitchen is calling out to me.” He hops up from the floor. “Quite an impressive trick, though, I must admit.” He tilts his head to observe the area. “So how did you do it, Hudders?”
John allows himself a few more seconds to admire Sherlock's beauty. He then turns over, shuts off the bedside lamp, and settles in for sleep.
Quick note: Uhhh I forgot to tag this in the first chapter, but Mrs. Hudson’s brownies are like...the special kind of brownies 😅😅😅. So I’m letting you know now in case that’s not your thing.
John laughs, sucking playfully at Sherlock’s bottom lip. Sherlock groans with disapproval (although he approves wholeheartedly), scolding John with a nudge of his tongue, and John repays him with a large sweeping motion of his own.
In response, Gabriela clutches onto the front fold of Irene’s robe, pulling her in until their mouths meet. Irene takes in a sharp breath, cupping her hands behind Gabriela’s head to press her closer. Gabriela sucks delicately at her bottom lip, tightening her grasp. Their kiss quickly becomes passionate, tongues peeking out of their mouths as they slide them together. They seem to have forgotten that they aren’t the only two people in there.
He turns off his phone and stares out the back window of the cab. It’s not even quite noon, but daylight hours are almost half over. He begins to doze off a bit, until his phone buzzes in his lap, notifying him that someone has posted a new photo.
With his answer, Gabriela’s face lights up, and she grins widely at him before returning to her book.
All he knows is that the man he loves more than anything in the universe is in his lap, frotting against him, kissing him desperately as though he knows it will be the last time.
John hopes she’ll keep Sherlock distracted for a moment—because it’s imperative that he doesn’t hear what John is about to say.
Who knows what tonight will bring, after all? Is it possible that he’ll find comfort in the familiar: a few drinks and Sarah’s bed? He never really felt a spark with her, but perhaps it’s safer that way. Because a spark, he’s learned, can burn an entire house down.
Within an hour or so, the vehicle pulls into the parking lot of an abandoned motel. The rooms are dark and empty; the sign has fallen off, and they are surrounded by nothing but empty desert on all sides.
It’s difficult, sometimes, for John to convince himself that it’s not real. That with every kiss, he won't be kissing Sherlock until they're old. That they won't always hold hands and call one another beautiful. That every climax doesn’t bring pleasure and pain all at once.
Gabriela turns to her, returning from her daze to give Molly her full attention. She’s brilliant at that, John thinks. She has a way of making everyone around her feel as though they’re the most important person in the room.
The corners of John’s mouth turn up slightly. He does the absurdly seductive thing where he drags his tongue over his bottom lip. “Sherlock. My love. Bit busy at the moment.” His gaze flits downwards in demonstration, and then back to him. “Would you like me to take a break from pleasuring you so we can have a chat about it?”
She makes a tiny gasping noise and begins patting down her pockets. “Oh, no! I don’t have any matches!” She turns to Lestrade. “Have you got any I could borrow?”
Time skips again. One second, John is looking down at her body—and the pool of blood forming beneath it. The next, Sherlock—who is very much alive—is embracing him fiercely, shaking like a leaf.
John's kissing Sherlock because Sherlock asked him to, and he can't say no to the taste of his honey-sweet lips. John's kissing him as if he's waited to kiss him forever, and forever felt far more likely, but he's grateful that forever has turned into now.
John groans with embarrassment. “Thank you. I suppose I gave you a good opportunity to pay it forward.”
love," John proclaims. "A love I've been waiting a lifetime to find. It's the greatest love I've ever known, and we don't even get to tell others, because they knew first!" He shakes his head with discontent. "It's monumental to us, Sherlock, and our closest friends can't even celebrate it! Don't you find it a bit disappointing?"
John grins, but his smile quickly fades to a defeated sigh. “I don’t know when we’ll see one another again, Sherlock. But it will happen; you have my word. You’re stuck with me. Wherever you run off to, I’m going to follow. Whenever you fall, I’m going to hold your hand. I’ll scale mountains with you, swim oceans...I’ll hop onto a spaceship to the bloody moon. It doesn’t matter. We’re in this together.”
But from time to time, even then, as he watched other children in his neighbourhood through the windows of his bedroom—riding their bicycles, playing games, and chasing fireflies— he wondered what it might be like to have a friend.
John slowly presses himself into Sherlock, and everything else fades away. Everything but John, growling lowly as he encases himself in Sherlock’s heat. Everything but their bodies, drenched in sweat, sliding together over the mattress. Everything but John pumping into him, gruffly calling out Sherlock’s name as he frots against the mattress.
"I understand why you feel that way, John." He brushes another kiss to his temple. "Utterly and completely. And I appreciate you telling me."
"You are?" Sherlock's voice jumps a half register. He draws a breath. "Of course you are. I mean, being married to me is—"
is. Sitting together on the sofa in their flat, their conversation flowing as easily as wine from the bottle. Time passes, and they laugh about this and that and this, and Sherlock asks himself why they've never done this before.
No. He’s not going to talk about William. He smiles. “I think I’m just a little intoxicated, that’s all.” He gestures towards the two of them. “So tell me. How did it all happen?”
Sherlock leans into him with all of his weight, whining with displeasure. Yet John still stands there, arms crossed, wearing that dull, arrogant (captivating, charming???) grin on his face.
He arrives at Sarah’s apartment at half past nine. The party is well underway. The place smells of sweat and vapes and cheap beer, and downtempo music booms from speakers. People at various levels of intoxication laugh and snog and murmur in the dim light.
Gabriela turns her head and seals their lips together for a messy, open-mouthed kiss, and she spins her body to Sarah’s to embrace her. Her hand returns to Sarah’s upper thigh, and she slides her fingertips under her skirt. She hikes it up over her bum, revealing that Sarah isn’t wearing underwear.
John’s heart rate is so elevated as he approaches the door of The Strand that he’s convinced he’s going into cardiac arrest. But he takes a deep breath, thinks of William’s soft lips, and pulls at the door handle.
Two rounds and one draught beer in, their game of “pool” becomes a game of “strip pool." It's exactly like regular pool—but with less clothing.
Sometimes, John visits Molly’s Instagram. And it’s not because he hopes to see a picture or two of William; he truly enjoys multiple daily pictures of food and K-pop stars and cats.
It's not because he desperately longs for John. Or craves the king-sized warmth that emanates from his fun-sized body. He doesn't try to guess the temperature of John's skin. Doesn’t observe John's REM cycle patterns, or the twitching of his eyelids while he dreams. Doesn’t watch John’s chest rise and fall as he breathes twelve to fourteen times per minute.
“I hope to god you’ll never again have to deal with one of these,” he mutters to the old woman, and walks back out into the cold. And now, he’s even more annoyed, because after that little scene, he’ll probably have to find a new café to study at.
John’s got questions, but the desire to consume William overtakes him completely. He thrusts his tongue into him, thrashes and sucks and licks until William's arsehole is wet and pink and throbbing, but he doesn’t stop to come up for air—he doesn’t need to. This is only a dream, after all, and breathing is boring.
He then becomes concerned for John’s current state of mind: has he had a bit to drink? Has he finally gone insane, driven to the edge by a life of danger and mystery and adrenaline? Because such compliments aren’t a typical part of their conversational repertoire.
Sherlock knows nothing about this game, but he’s fairly certain Molly hasn’t read the directions carefully enough.
Sherlock returns just before visiting hours are over. He brings things he thinks John will enjoy: his laptop, some crosswords, his favourite tea, and a few of his medical journals. He also brings some sort of oddly shaped neck pillow—which he says is for John—but John soon learns that Sherlock actually plans to use it to lay his head on the bed in a manner that isn’t tortuously uncomfortable.
"It's beautiful," John says in awe; Sherlock finds that he is looking directly at him. He's panting and out of breath, but he looks happy.
It’s past midnight, and they ring in the second day of the year by sitting at a cafe booth holding large mugs of lukewarm black coffee. John orders frozen yoghurt and the girls share something called a whoopee pie, a Massachusetts staple that John can't even say the name of while keeping a straight face.
you." He slides his fingers over William's neck, over his cheeks, and through his curls. "So I’m going to kiss you now, and if you kiss me in return, that will speak more clearly to me than a hundred words.”
John tells Sherlock that his hair is every bit as soft as he imagined, and that he’s brilliant and beautiful—just as they practiced, too. He brushes a very soft kiss against the crown of Sherlock’s head—which is something they did not practice. He didn’t plan to do it. It was sort of automatic, given the proximity, but very subtle—perhaps Sherlock didn’t notice.
When in doubt, however, he’s learned that kissing is the obvious solution—so he seals their mouths together.
John nods. "That's my guess. And if Molly was involved somehow...or Irene... I don't think they would have come right out and said anything about it. Possibly to protect William. Or themselves. Or even me. Molly could have purposely, perhaps falsely, checked in at the MIT library to lead me there...and to lead me to the Get Sherlock message."
The two men stand there, completely still. Sherlock’s jaw trembles as John’s hovers inches from his, their bodies fitting comfortably together from chest to pelvis.
"Very observant." Sherlock rolls over to his side, away from him. He knows he's being a brat, but he desperately wishes John would leave and let him sulk in peace.
"It's fine, Sherlock.” John smiles tightly. "I'm fine. I don't need to know. You aren't entitled to share your past with me."
that Sherlock’s brother kidnapped, threatened, and interrogated him—but Sherlock figures it out before he does.
And John, already harder than a diamond beneath him, clutches tightly to the headboard to steer his own hips in their sweaty dance. Slides up and down against him, drags his wet mouth over him everywhere he can reach, leaving nothing graceful about where his lips and tongue are going.
John feels dizzy; he wonders if he’s stopped breathing. He doesn’t know how to feel about a single word William has just spoken—so as he turns the door handle, he takes a deep breath, and he simply feels nothing.
Sherlock delicately weaves their fingers together. He skims his fingertips absentmindedly over John’s hands, over his wrist and his callused knuckles. Over John's fingers, and the wedding band he continues to wear.
Oh, god. The absolute intimacy of this moment grips Sherlock like a vise. He moans, reigniting the arching of his hips.
"Yes. Yes, Alright." Anderson brings his phone up, muttering the words as he types a message. "Dear...Sally. I love...the way...you are
After a few moments—(or maybe more than a few, as these particular moments are frankly some of the most intense moments of Sherlock’s life) (and he may have lost track of time) (and possibly space and every other dimension)—Sherlock’s cock is rock hard, throbbing, and begging to be touched.
The food selection is scarce, so they decide upon a Bloody Mary breakfast. William almost convinces John that the drink represents all of the main food groups, until he unironically cites salt and alcohol as food groups of their own.
Once they're both ready, he takes Sherlock by the hips and helps him into his lap. Sherlock wraps his legs around his waist and straddles him; wraps his arms around his shoulders and continues to kiss him. The kiss is dirty. Messy. Unrestrained.
“That must be Greg at the door!” Mrs. Hudson hoists herself off the floor, giving Sherlock and John a covert nod. “He mentioned bringing a friend along. Perhaps someone you know?”
This cuts into John like a knife. He knows Sherlock meant well in saying it, but the very thought of John being replaced—No. He’s being ridiculous; Molly has helped Sherlock with his cases for a long time—since before John even met him. It’s nothing to be concerned about.
Strangely, Mrs. Hudson carries on as though the situation is completely ordinary. “Heading out for a case, I take it,” she says. “Past midnight? Rather late. Though I suppose healthy sleeping patterns are generally lacking among the criminally insane.” She clicks her tongue against the roof of her mouth. “They ought to consider getting more sleep—might lower their homicidal tendencies. On that note, I’m off to bed! Goodnight, you two!” And with that, she disappears into her flat, closing her door behind her.
John thinks. Nothing out of the ordinary. One of them always seems to be saving the other. Still, his face grows oddly warm at the thought of Sherlock waiting there next to him, day and night, like a stone. His heart begins to thump irregularly, and he curses the heart monitor for making it apparent.
"Being polite is certainly an effort," Sherlock states. "Too much of an effort. Being disliked by everyone is far easier."
The alleyways are filled with people crowded around the bars, but he pushes through them, breathing in the icy air until he’s sure his lungs will explode. He’s terrified and ecstatic and wants to scream loudly for a half dozen reasons, but he tries to focus on the end goal: taking William into his arms. Brushing his fingers through his curls. Telling him he loves him, and that his love isn’t going to fade. Kissing him, if he’ll allow it.
When John arrives, the sky is pitch black and covered in clouds. The frigid wind even pierces through his winter coat. But it doesn't compare to the chill that runs through him as he approaches The Strand. Perhaps it was the crowds and the New Years energy the night before, but tonight, the building looks different. It looks utterly abandoned and empty, as though it belongs in a ghost town.
The sun sets, and the room grows dark—but Sherlock doesn't need to look at John to know that in this moment, he is utterly breathtaking.
Through many breaths and ticks of the clock at their bedside table, they slide in and out of one another’s mouths. They consume one another, drink in one another, pressing their lips into the slick, velvet skin between their legs. They fuck each other’s mouths in a steady rhythm until John becomes weak in the knees, collapsing on top of his lover.
John wraps an arm around his shoulder and kisses his cheek, and he gives in, as long as John keeps touching him like that. For a bit, William seems to actually enjoy the film, but within an hour he becomes needy and bored.
John takes Sherlock's hand before letting his eyes fall closed. As he drifts off again, Sherlock squeezes his hand gently, because he wants to be sure John knows he's going to stay.
“—the Whitechapel murders,” Sherlock cuts in with enthusiasm. “Yes. From analyses of blood found in the scarf of Catherine Eddowis, one of the five canonical victims of—“
Sherlock is grateful for their arrival, and for their careful handling of John as they take him to the ambulance. He's
my life, Sherlock. Or at least, that I didn't have much of one before you came into it. I knew then that I loved you. And I regretted that I didn't know it sooner, because I would have told you."
Moriarty pauses directly in front of Sherlock. He lifts a hand, gently tracing Sherlock’s jawline with his forefinger. He tilts his head slightly, regarding him with the eyes of a hungry lion sizing up its prey. “You’re very taken with him, aren’t you? Then tell me something.” His voice drops quieter, and he speaks with a chilling tenderness. “Do you allow
As they walk into the building, John has a crushing feeling in his chest. The place is exactly as it had been a little over week ago, but with one very obvious, tall and beautiful and bright light missing. The lack of William there causes the place to be disturbingly quiet; the type of silent that's so persistent, it almost shatters your eardrums.
“I like this place.” John looks over at the enormous bookshelf on the wall. “I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. It captures your essence. And I—wait. Is that a human skull on the bookshelf?”
Sherlock’s eyelids fall closed. He sighs blissfully as John cards his fingers through his hair, gliding them over his cheeks and tracing his jawbone, brushing his lips with his.
"Oh," Sherlock says absentmindedly. "I suppose so, yes. Must have pulled a muscle when you dragged me to the kitchen floor."
Sherlock leans in until their foreheads are aligned. “I simply wanted to inform you that I love you, too.”
The weeks and nights go by without any more kisses or love confessions, but their bed is far from empty—there is body heat and warm breaths and murmurs of happy things. Cold noses bumping together; smooth curls and shallow exhalations and eyelashes whispering against bare skin. Cold ears pressing themselves into warm ribcages to listen to the
He continues to apply the perfect amount of pressure to Sherlock's biceps, making his way over his shoulders and down his arms bit by bit. Sherlock's eyes drift closed as his surroundings and the knots in his body melt away. John massages his upper back and over his spine, in deliberate, unhurried strokes, and Sherlock releases a rattling sigh; all that's left is the feeling of John’s hands on him and John’s legs around him.
If she’s surprised or caught off guard by his question, she doesn’t show it. No hitching of her breath or quickening of her pulse; no movement, yet no signs of hesitation.
John’s hands roam over Sherlock’s back, come trailing down his spine, linger at his hips. He allows them to wander down past the small of his back, and he moans into the kiss without meaning to.
looms just below the door frame, and takes up nearly a third of the door’s height. Beneath is the letter
”Do you know how to make an Old Fashioned?” he asks, leaning over the bar. “Bourbon, a splash of water—“
John says nothing further; he only looks back expectantly. Sherlock, for the first time, realises just how lovely those bright blue magnets are, and that perhaps he might
The next thing he hears is Irene’s voice whispering into Gabriela’s ear. “You can’t see it because of the blindfold, but I’m wearing my favourite strap-on. I’m going to slide into your wet pussy and pump into you, hard. And I’ve had a lot of practice, so I’m going to fuck you until you’re coming so explosively that you see stars.” The sound of a kiss. “Relax,” she says. “And tell me you want it.”
William strolls towards him, pursing his lips in annoyance. “I’m afraid that’s impossible. We’re closing soon.”
Sarah greets him at the door with a warm smile and a soft kiss on the cheek. “John,” she says, embracing him tightly. “It’s so great to see you. You look fantastic.”
They may no longer be in their perfect little corner—but here Sherlock is, standing in front of John, waiting for him to say how he feels.
“Gabriela remains with her family for the time being. Sarah has been made aware of the situation, minus some of the specifics—so have Mike Stamford and his partner, Elizabeth."
“I assure you, by the way," Sherlock says, rustling John’s hair with his words. “...that for everything I've mentioned, the feeling...the desire...is completely mutual.”
After a fourth time, he tucks the card beneath the vase of the succulent. Slumps down into his bed. Admires its beauty for a fair amount of time. Sprawls out, buries his face into his pillow, and screams.
John studies every fleck of his irises, every crease of his brow, desperately wishing he knew what that expression meant—that he could somehow read Sherlock as well as he seems to read him.
“John…” She turns to him and takes his hand. “Whoever it is that you’re fighting for...they sure as hell better be fighting for you just as hard. Because anyone who doesn’t...well, they’re a complete fucking fool.”
John stares. Sherlock is somehow very charming when he pouts. The way his eyes become wide, his forehead crinkles, and his lips form into a perfect heart shape. It's rather nice.
“Excuse me,” John says to the driver. “My plans have changed. Can you take me to Barker Library on the MIT campus?”
As she falls back onto her pillow and shuts off the light, John's chest swells with affection for her. Her open, loving heart; the innocence she possesses, regardless of her intelligence, strength, and wit. The way people seem drawn to her like magnets, and yet she doesn’t bat them away, as other beautiful women might do; instead, making an equal place for each of them.
Hoping to beat him there, Sherlock executes his characteristic long, graceful strides; John, his characteristic scamper, and yet, remarkably, the smaller man catches up.
But John knows; he knows how madly in love he is. He also knows that at best, Sherlock loves him as a friend. But that’s an issue for Future John to deal with. For the time being, he’ll focus on healing and on being an adequate pretend husband.
Amidst the absurdity, it takes Sherlock a full fifteen seconds to realise how they’ve landed. He’s propped onto his elbows and knees, sprawled across John, who lies on his back beneath him, still clutching onto the collar of his shirt. Upon this realisation, Sherlock’s laughter halts abruptly; however, John’s continues.
Sure, John seems calm and collected at the moment, but Sherlock once again observes otherwise. The leaping pulse. His neck, glistening with sweat. His hands splayed over his lap, working very hard to hide the fact that he’s becoming aroused.
John kisses the damp curls where his hairline meets his neck. "You are my forever safe space, Sherlock,” he continues. "You are radiant in every sense of the word, and I'm the luckiest man in the world to be caught in your afterglow."
William’s mouth drops and his cigarette falls to the floor. “Have we met?” he asks, peering into his eyes with obvious defiance.
“Oh, we’re playing pretend, are we?” Moriarty stops at arms-length, pinning Sherlock to the wall with eyes as black as ink. “
He bends forwards to kiss John on the mouth. "The before times were terrible. And I understand why you might be afraid to face those feelings. But I was in the same place you were back then, and I am in the same place you are now. This time, however, we're in the same place at the same time. And anywhere we go, we go together."
Donovan laughs nervously, her body tense. “I wouldn’t say normal, exactly. Something similar happened a couple of times with my grandmother. I was too young to know if it was real, or if she was just making it up for fun. But I do remember always thinking she had some type of gift.”
Sherlock frowns as he approaches one of the female agents in the centre, one of the few people in the room actually appearing to be calm and collected.
“In future, if this happens again, I’ll just tell you flat out what I think. Remember, you can’t possibly ever force me to do something I don’t want to do.”
It’s understandable, it really is, Sherlock thinks to himself. John’s been told that his best friend is leaving him forever and he hasn’t even been told where to or why.
And that's all folks! Honestly, I had so much trouble penning this chapter because I was still feeling bummed about season 4. But writing this chapter has really given me the chance to heal, to remember what I enjoyed about the series and the characters that I had come to love. And nothing can take that away from me.
Sherlock flips open the back of the frame, pulling out the metal stand, revealing a yellowish, flimsy sheet of print.
“I’m here,” he repeats, slowly guiding the two of them down onto the ground, John clinging onto him like a lifeline as they slide slowly onto the carpeted floor.
Sherlock answers in kind, giggling a little as John presses one more kiss to his nose before walking over to his side of the table, sitting down once again.
They eat in silence, with the occasional clink of metal against ceramic as Sherlock devours his breakfast.
Moriarty screams as he falls, a loud, high-pitched sound that resonates in the night air. Sherlock steps forward towards the edge, gazing down at the chasm below them, watching as the dark abyss swallows Moriarty up.
Sherlock’s brow furrows in confusion, his eyes narrowing as he does a full sweep of Mycroft’s face, trying to figure out whether the man is joking or not.
There’s an audible sigh from the stairway as the door swings open to reveal a very dishevelled looking Greg Lestrade who fumbles into the room. He looks like he hasn't slept in the past few nights.
“No,” Sherlock responds, hoping that Watson isn’t trying to get at what he thinks he’s trying to get at. God, the fictional, Victorian version of John Watson is seriously a menace.
“At least I didn’t attempt to kill my best friend’s lover,” Sherlock retorts. He knows he’s getting angry, maybe a bit too angry. He knows he should break off communication with Cameron at once but he can’t stop himself.
Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise as John half-carries him over to his bed, setting him down gently.
They climb down the stairs in silence, Sherlock knowing full well that each step he takes will be a step away from John.
Sherlock hasn’t changed much since they’ve gotten together, John muses as he splashes his face with water. He’s been as insufferable as ever, leaving things in a mess around the house, consistently endangering himself on a monthly basis and on occasion, been frustratingly emotionally obtuse (though he’s definitely been making a concerted effort to improve in this area).
“I didn’t know you could dance like that! I mean I knew you could waltz, that much I knew... but that! That was another thing altogether!” John gushes, his grin wider than ever as Sherlock averts his gaze, twisting away from John so that he won’t be able to see the blush that he’s certain is riding high on his cheeks.
“I wish I could believe you,” is all he says as he rolls over, back to his spot on the sofa beside Sherlock.
“Fill me up,” he mutters, almost in a daze, as John continues to plunge into him, “Make me yours. I want to be yours. Make me-”
That seems to draw a smile out of John, the corner of his lip quirking as he sighs, ruffling Sherlock’s curls playfully.
OH MY GOD Y'ALL. I'M SO SORRY. I had school up till about May and got stuck with a bad writer's block :<. But here we are! At the end. Finally. I hope I gave our boys the ending that they deserved. Enjoy!!!
“Thanks,” he breathes, blushing a little from Sherlock’s praise. It’d always meant more when Sherlock complimented him, partially because the man almost never compliments anyone and partially because he’s one of the few people that John constantly seeks to impress.
“Excited, now aren’t we?” he teases as he gives Sherlock’s cock another vigorous pump. Sherlock throws his head back in response, his cheek digging into the pillow as he lets out a loud moan.
Sherlock appears to hesitate for a moment, his eyes flicking from John’s face to the packaging before he shifts over to John’s side, reaching for the chopsticks.
“And your scalp, oh… oh so sensitive,” John murmurs, eliciting a throaty rumble from Sherlock, “You like that don’t you, when I play with your curls?”
“What?” Sherlock breathes, his nose scrunching up in confusion. “What the hell is going on, why am I here?”
John watches him out of the corner of his eye, his whole body on edge as if waiting for an imminent objection.
Sherlock’s sides are aching, his lungs gasping for air but despite that, this is the happiest he's been in ages.
“Just- Like- You,” she finishes, punctuating each word with a short press to Sherlock’s nose, causing Sherlock’s hands to ball up into fists.
Sherlock sighs, proceeding to lather on some shaving cream haphazardly before putting the razor to his skin, listening to the mechanical whirring of the machine as what remains of his morning stubble is sheared off.
It doesn't work, Sherlock’s starting to succumb to his mounting hysteria, his whole body shaking violently now.
John’s voice is still raspy, a bit worn and tired and yet, he sounds much more light-hearted, his voice having lost the sad, sorrowful weightiness of before.
“Okay,” he responds, rubbing his eyes. Propping himself up on one arm, he watches as John grabs a towel, making his way to the washroom.
“Well, you technically already know half of the story,” Sherlock answers, struggling to keep his composure.
Yes, Sherlock thinks, smiling at Watson. “Pretty damned smart,” he professes, blushing slightly as Watson flashes him a knowing smirk.
That was the turning point, he muses now, where, for the very first time, he had decided to delete a huge area of study he had dedicated the best part of three years to... But then John came around, questioning him about the solar system, showing him the stars in the London sky, making Sherlock realise that he hadn’t actually deleted the solar system, he’d just locked it away, somewhere very deep inside.
He extracts his keys from his pocket, furiously fumbling till he finds the one that he wants, listening as John locks the car door, stalking up to him with firm footsteps. However, no matter how hard he tries, he can’t seem to fit the key in the keyhole.
There’d been a lopsided smiley face at the bottom of the note as well, a speedily scribbled smile that mimicked the one drawn across Sherlock’s features as he moved quickly to grab a chair and spoon. He’d slurped the soup up in greedy sips, trying to prevent himself from grinning and failing miserably.
It hadn’t been anything remotely similar to how people had described it in romantic comedies. It’d been nothing like that “finding the other half of your heart” kind of bullshit but rather… Sherlock complements John in ways that he could never have imagined.
But he had come back and found John with Mary. He'd come back and found John in the midst of a marriage proposal.
It's then that John's fingers stop moving. A soft whine escapes from Sherlock’s lips at the loss of contact. He immediately clamps his lips tightly shut before he makes any more embarrassing sounds.
They arrive at Baker Street eventually. John tips the cabby as Sherlock exits the car, still chattering about the quality of fabric of one of the blood-stained dresses he had seen and how it’s key in figuring out whether the case had really been a murder or suicide. John listens attentively, hauling the bags out of the cab as he kicks the door closed.
“Fuck,” is all John can muster as he pulls Sherlock into an embrace, a finger dancing along the rim of Sherlock’s sphincter, meeting sticky warmth there, “Fuck-”
“I love you,” John says simply, his eyes ablaze as he focuses his attention on Sherlock’s neck instead, lapping at the skin there before sucking gently, easing a sigh out of him, “I love you so much.”
Sherlock sees the man fall in slow motion, just like on that fateful day on the top of Barts. He watches as Moriarty tumbles, hitting the ground with a thump as blood spurts into the air…
There’s an openness there now that has never been there before, John thinks to himself as he takes Sherlock’s hand, leading him to the living room.
The man is already breathing heavily as he drags John into the room, tugging him almost mindlessly towards himself. Thankfully, John still has enough presence of mind to lock the door.
“Come on love! I’m running out of chores to give Bill to do! Please do come down and entertain him or at least help us with the table setting!” she hollers again, her voice reverberating across whitewashed walls as she stands, her arms akimbo, glaring up at the dark space at the top of the staircase.
It really feels like the old days, when it was just the two of them. The thrill of a new mystery and the lure of adventure being their sole companions as they waltzed into danger and into the unknown. And for the first time, in a very long time, Sherlock feels alive.
“Sher- Sherlock,” John’s nearly breathless voice rings out amidst crumbling static, the abject fear in his voice practically bleeding through the telephone lines.
“You’re being absolutely childish, this is extremely unlike you,” Sherlock huffs, turning his nose up and pushing his plate towards John.
“Mary,” he says, “I’ll have to follow Sherlock to Baker Street. Make sure he’s okay and everything. Is that alright with you?”
However, there is one thing that is certain. As evidenced by the lack of blood on the bed, the stabbing was clearly something that had been done post-mortem.
“John… John? Whadya mean?” he murmurs, wiping his eyes once more as John chuckles softly, almost sadly, pressing a chaste kiss to his lips.
“No Sherlock if there’s one thing I’m certain of it’s that I’d never abandon you,” John asserts, his voice firm.
“Yes baby?” John answers, his hips beginning to thrust upwards into the ring of their fists, “How does it feel?”
“She told me not to,” David is sobbing now, his head shaking as he rocks back and forth on his heels, “Said bad things would happen to me if I did… I didn’t know what to do. I’m sorry.”
“His name was Redbeard. And… He was my best friend,” he can feel tears threatening to well up in his eyes, the memory of his loyal Irish Setter holding sway on his emotions as he continues.
He pours the egg and onion mix onto the frying pan, which gives a satisfying sizzle, before proceeding to stir it around with a pair of chopsticks. After about 3 minutes, the omelette is a golden yellow, fluffy and puffy. Sherlock gives a broad smile before proceeding to transfer the omelette to a nearby plate.
“I’m touched. I’m honoured,” he says, still smiling rather creepily at him as Sherlock steps forward once again.
“Also Sherlock,” she says, her eyes glancing knowingly in his direction. Sherlock shivers slightly, clutching the duvet tightly as he steels himself for the worst.
“No it won’t,” John shudders, shaking his head as he burrows further into Sherlock’s arm, “Sherlock she had images of us, on that fucking day. I thought that this was over the moment that demon lady left our house. Well, apparently it wasn’t.”
“I’m going to make us some tea,” he calls to John as he fills the kettle with water, “Mrs Hudson brought up some biscuits in the morning so we can have those as well.”
“I just… Look Harry and I haven’t spoken for a while and I feel like I need to check on her and all that, okay?”
As far as he knows, John has never been prone to dramatics and it’s simultaneously surprising and worrying to see his friend behave like this.
He rises from the bed, the piece of furniture an outlandish addition to the scenery surrounding him.
“Don’t worry it ended up being pretty superficial,” he says, clearly having noticed the discomfort on John’s face, though misconstruing it for something else. “It just hurt like hell.”
John’s gaze rakes across the expanse of nothingness before him, the sea of white blinding his eyes as John registers that it’s suddenly gotten much… much brighter.
Sherlock stares down at John’s chest, refusing to make eye contact as his eyes threaten to brim over with tears.
She’d promised him that she’d give John her whole world and now… What exactly had she provided him with?
Mycroft shifts in his seat, getting up from the sofa to take a seat in John’s chair opposite Sherlock.
“If you like,” Sherlock smiles, “He’s going back on Sunday so you will have the whole of Friday and Saturday to catch up.”
He’d clearly planned this. How had Sherlock not figured it out? How- oh. That was why John had said that he would be back later on Friday. Stupid! How hadn’t he seen that?
John glances up at him once, shrugging in silence before turning back to the window, clearly deep in thought.
“No, I wrote all that,” Watson says, interrupting Sherlock’s thoughts as he sits up a little straighter. “You’re quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.”
They eventually pile into a cab, John clutching their shopping bags tightly while Sherlock gesticulates at thin air, his hands dancing in an elaborate tango as he runs John through some of the interesting cases. John watches on, absolutely enraptured as Sherlock postulates some of his theories regarding the more convoluted cold cases, listening carefully to Sherlock’s deductions and responding to them appropriately when Sherlock pauses for breath.
He remembers them doing this… quite some time ago. When Sherlock had made an omelette for John the day after he’d returned.
It’s not true, it really isn’t. He had taken the drugs of his own volition. And even though Mary had passed him the drugs and Mycroft had locked him up, it was still he who had made the final decision.
It’s then that Sherlock feels light fingertips whispering across his skin. He hears John give a shuddering breath before he presses a palm to his back, feeling the ridges of the scars that mark his back. John’s fingers caress his skin, tracing the lines from the top of Sherlock’s neck to the waistband of his trousers, leaving a trail of warmth from the top of his back to the base. With every stroke of John’s fingertips, Sherlock feels like the horrible memories that these scars have come with are fading away, that they’re being replaced with the fresh memory of John’s skin on his and it feels absolutely cathartic.
Sherlock groans, shaking his head. God, he took the drugs so what. There’s not much else they can talk about. He’ll probably be put in rehab for a while if Mycroft had his way, his brain rotting away from disuse. There’ll once again be countless doctors attending to his every whim and fancy - doctors that aren’t John and Sherlock isn’t looking forward to it...
He lowers his gaze eventually, meeting John’s eyes. They peer up at Sherlock’s face, John's expression full of unmasked affection. John seems distracted though, his pupils swirling into distant specks of dark blue before he grounds his gaze once again, tethering it to Sherlock’s as he takes a step forward, startling him a little as he moves closer into his personal space.
He continues to stare after the small opening in the road, half-expecting the car to turn back for him, that this is all just a sick joke and he’ll soon be jolted free from this nightmare.
They’ve had a lazy Saturday in, no cases, no experiments, nothing, just the two of them enjoying each other’s shared space.
John starts the ball rolling without much preamble, his tongue licking a slow line up and down Sherlock’s parted lips before slipping through. Tangling their tongues together, John buries calloused fingers in Sherlock’s hair, the pads of his fingers rubbing circles into his scalp.
“I’ll be fine,” he says as he gets up from the table, pushing his chair in and grabbing his travelling bag.
“So soon after breakfast?” Mrs Hudson queries, sounding slightly indignant. “You haven't even finished your crumpets!”
And on the other side of the glass panes is a crystal clear body of water, the water rushing and rolling onto the shore as John sighs, toeing off his shoes and moving to stand.
He heads for the kitchen, dumping the tray down on the table. He doesn't want to talk to Mrs Hudson right now, especially after that embarrassing moment, god the thought of it gives Sherlock chills. Anyways, she'll come up to retrieve it eventually. Sherlock makes his way to the living room, dropping down on his leather chair.
Lestrade leads the way into a bedroom, where the bodies had both been found. It’s a beautiful room, as nicely decorated as the rest of the house. It has an extremely earthy feel with its walls painted in light brown. Not to mention the fact that it is fitted with glossy parquet flooring and beautifully crafted wooden furniture. The centrepiece of the room is a four-poster bed, its duvet and pillows encased in red bedsheets. The only thing that’s out of place are the lines of white chalk on the bedsheet, outlining the silhouettes of where the two women had lain. There is also a bottle of uncapped bleach on the bed, it’s approximately half full.
They spend most of dinner reminiscing about the past year, John piping up between mouthfuls of chicken and rosti as Sherlock recounts the case with Cameron Campbell (the man now behind bars thanks to their teamwork), of how they’d shared Sherlock’s bed that night for the very first time and of how he’d felt when John had held him in his arms the morning after.
“Like what you see, huh?” he teases, eyebrow half-raised as he leans up, planting his lips on Sherlock’s once again.
“Oh indeed, brother mine,” Mycroft sighs, shaking his head as he crumples up the sheet of paper that Sherlock now believes to be his drug results slip, chucking it into the bin, “You really did scare us there for a second. Thankfully you didn’t take them, otherwise Doctor Watson here would have more cause for worry.”
In these cases, John had almost always been impossible to read, his stubborn gaze absolutely uninterpretable till Sherlock prodded him for more information, hoping that John's facial expression would change to reveal something new.
Once they’ve shut the door behind them, they both tiptoe up to the flat. Mrs Hudson is probably home and neither of them really want to have a conversation with her at this time of night, especially since she still doesn’t know that John is back. Heck, that’ll probably result in a lot of unnecessary probing into the reasons for John’s departure that Sherlock’s sure John isn’t ready for yet.
They remain silent for a while, John continuing to trace patterns into Sherlock’s back as Sherlock exhales softly into John’s jumper, nuzzling wearily into his chest.
“We’re to leave for Sussex tonight,” Sherlock says as he rests his phone down on the kitchen table of 221B, “Will that be okay with you?”
Extra cup left lying on the sink rack in the kitchen, two bath towels hanging from the rack in David’s room…
“Good afternoon to you too, brother” he sneers, dumping another can into the cupboard. He listens as it gives a satisfying rattle before striding back into the sitting room, taking a seat on his own leather chair.
“Children… At school…” Sherlock cuts him off, his electric blue irises suddenly losing their shine, turning a darker shade of sea blue, “Used to remark that I looked like an alien.”
“However, there were other factors to take into consideration, like our baby, her terrifying past, her impeccable assassin skills and I was at a loss, so I decided to turn to the British government for help.”
“I-I’m beautiful, gorgeous, amazing, handsome, attRACTIVE,” Sherlock yells the last word as John begins to speed up his thrusts, pummelling into Sherlock with all that he’s got.
His head comes to rest under John's chin, his forehead pressed against John's Adam's apple. John smells the same as he always does. He smells of his body soap and the salonpas he uses to keep his shoulder from aching, a scent that's uniquely his.
“I love you so much,” John murmurs, flipping them over so that he’s once again on top of Sherlock. “I love you-”
Sherlock watches on greedily as John’s hips stutter before his cock pulses, spilling all over Sherlock’s chest. He continues to pump John through it, milking the man till his thighs begin to tremble.
Sherlock smiles weakly at him, wondering whether he should tell John about Redbeard or if he should just keep mum and speed out the door.
John loves him, John still loves him after all that he’s done and Sherlock is the luckiest man on Earth.
“Same for me I guess…” Sherlock replies, coming back to himself, “You were such a force of nature and I… I'd repressed too much of myself for so long so when you came along… frankly, I was terrified, about how willing I was to be so open with you, of how willing I was to let you in.”
"So we got really curious and decided to do some research into these two women’s lives. We looked into their social media accounts, their messages... everything! But nothing shows that these two women have ever met before this, let alone known each other"
, Sherlock thinks to himself as John rolls them over onto their sides, his hands carding through Sherlock’s hair as the other jostles the chain on his neck, the chain marking him as John’s.
John grins widely at this, his face positively radiant and Sherlock can feel his own face mimicking John’s.
“Was it the show with the blue dog?” Sherlock guesses, digging deep into the recesses of his memory, “the one where the owner is a sorry excuse of a detective? Personally, I’ve always felt that the dog was better at it than he was.”
There's suddenly a soft pressure on his side. He raises his head in slight confusion and is greeted by the sight of John leaning against his right arm, his head is resting on his shoulder. Sherlock’s breath catches as John turns to face him. Their blue eyes lock onto each others before both of them sigh simultaneously and relax back into the pillow behind them. John reaches for Sherlock’s hand, which Sherlock gives gladly.
Sherlock snorts at this, his eyes sparkling in silent laughter and in that moment John would have loved nothing more than to have captured his lips in a searing kiss.
Sherlock scrutinises John once again, hoping to pick up some new evidence now that John is back. He narrows his gaze, almost squinting before relaxing back into the sofa, giving up completely. He’s still unable to successfully deduce anything about John’s recent trip. No location. No contacts made. Nothing. Zilch.
He feels like he’s grasping at straws, extremely out of his depth for once as he begins to rub circles into his palm, scratching the surface of the skin as he struggles to think.
“With my new name, I was able to put my past behind me, giving me greater control over my emotions. It helped a lot… but I suppose it made me far colder than I had been before.”
He remembers John coming home on those mornings, his hair ruffled and his clothing creased, smiling at Sherlock as if Christmas had come early. He shivers at the memory of those days, knowing that John’s smiles were not actually meant for him but for the person he’d slept with the previous night.
“So I laid low and decided to keep tabs on you by keeping tabs on John. I knew you’d contact him first if anything. And boy, did I have fun.”
The question startles John for a moment, his eyebrows shooting up before he regains some semblance of composure, fixing Sherlock with a sincere gaze.
He lifts the photo up to the light, smoothing his fingers over Redbeard’s frozen form. He remembers the day they'd taken this photo. It’d been 2 weeks before The Incident, before Sherlock’s world had been turned upside down, before he decided that William wasn’t a suitable first name to go by.
Smiling at the sight, John presses a gentle kiss to both of Sherlock’s closed eyelids, chapped skin meeting smooth and Sherlock’s breath hitches.
“Facilities she could have easily obtained elsewhere and more covertly with a smaller risk of attracting trouble,” Sherlock rebuts, “There’s a reason why she came here. A specific reason.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” he interjects, watching as John turns to him in confusion, his brow furrowing even as he grins up at him.
The moment the door closes behind them, John is on him in an instant, pinning him to the landing wall in one swift motion. Thank god Mrs Hudson isn’t around, otherwise, the sound of that ‘thud’ alone would have woken her up.
“I’m here,” he says as John lets out a loud sob, fisting his hands in the front of Sherlock’s shirt. “I’m here. I’m here. I’m here.”
And then there was the intimacy. Sherlock shudders just thinking about it, feeling a phantom pressure where John’s head had leant against his forehead, a ghost of hot breath on his lips. Why had they gotten so close? John had never done that before... the John he remembers from before the fall would have asserted his heterosexuality painstakingly. But then again, John had changed after his return, he’d changed a lot.
“John, we’re going to need to shower,” Sherlock blurts out all of a sudden, fixing his eyes on the man in question.
“Why? You may ask, well let’s review the evidence once again. The mud was indicative of illicit activities near a river, most likely the Thames. How do you run a lucrative, illegal business near a river? You deal with drug shipments.”
“The East Wind – this terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path. It seeks out the unworthy... and plucks them from the Earth…”
He rushes in immediately, pressing the ground floor button with such a ferocity that John gifts him with a frightened gaze, one which is quickly masked by confusion.
Just then, the timer for the chicken dings, Sherlock rushing to retrieve the chicken with a tell-tale blush still riding on his cheeks.
Sherlock tenses up, every muscle in his body feeling like they’re being pulled taut. Has John changed his mind? It’s only been two minutes!
“You didn’t know who I was?” Mary tuts, shaking her head, “My my Mr Holmes, you’ve been getting slow.”
He scrutinises John closely, trying to dampen the terror that’s slowly threatening to drown him. And that’s when he notices, the barely perceptible rise and fall of John’s chest. Good, he’s still alive, for now.
Screw it, Sherlock thinks to himself, he turns his body so that he's resting on his side, his head facing John's. He shuffles a bit closer, not sure how close John wants him to be exactly but John meets him halfway. Sherlock realises belatedly that he should have put on a shirt but he really cannot be bothered right now because John's arms are coming round to encircle him like a protective barrier, pulling them both impossibly closer.
“Sounds good darling,” he whispers into his ear and Sherlock is certain that he might’ve just spontaneously combusted right there and then.
He watches forlornly as they race away into the darkness, cheering like hounds on the scent of a hunt. At any other time, this would have been extremely humorous to him, but now? It just makes him feel a little abandoned and unwanted.
“Good… Better than good…” he purrs, dragging John’s head downwards and burying his nose in John’s hair.
“No I’m not,” Sherlock whispers, startling a gasping laugh out of John as he presses his lips to the apex of Sherlock’s spine, leaving an imprint of a smile on Sherlock’s singlet.
It’s probably the cheesiest thing that he’s ever said but that doesn’t matter. It’s perfect for the moment.
“We don’t have to do that, you know,” John says when he’s finally regained his ability to speak, “We can do all the stuff we’ve done before.”
“Like that time you elected to conduct an experiment concerning the effects of bubble gum on refined wool.”
The space surrounding him seems far more empty now that Sherlock’s voice isn’t there to occupy it, far less enticing… As if nothing means anything anymore without Sherlock’s presence.
Although, do me one favour… I do want a moustache. I quite liked it even though you and Mary both hated it. Just humour me a little bit alright?
“Hello, Mary,” he says, maintaining a tone of indifference, “What compels you to call me at this late hour?”
However, she pauses mid step, the steps creaking as she turns around to face the doorway once again.
“And then I’d say something… something so simple and honest and your self-control would burst. You’d handle me roughly then, biting, scratching, pulling, tugging, leaving my skin red and puckered and bruised and throbbing.”
Sherlock smiles a little at this, seeing as how his mother’s huge impact on his life even shows through his speech patterns. His father had also played a large role in his life, though his influence had truthfully been mostly confined to his teenage years.
John’s eyes seem to sparkle in recognition at this, clearly remembering Sherlock mentioning the case before. Well after all, John was the one who had taken him to the crime museum, the man’s memory isn’t that bad.
“John, you’re getting a bit hysterical,” Mike mumbles, rolling his eyes, “And I’m pretty sure that wasn’t the exact phrasing that Sherlock used.”
“Hey yourself,” Sherlock rumbles, pressing a quick kiss to John’s neck, nuzzling into the crook there gently.
“Sounds wonderful,” John chirps, the muscles in his face relaxing visibly as he reaches a hand forwards to gently ruffle Sherlock’s hair. “I can't wait.”
It’s a strange and weird feeling. He’s done this with a few of his other boyfriends before but this? This feels… different somehow, probably because it’s Sherlock.
“I sort of suspected too…” Sherlock adds, “Before the wedding even. I warned him when we talked about his duties-”
He fixes a questioning gaze on his lover, eyebrows furrowed as he finds sadness mingled with regret in John’s sea blue eyes...
There are clear outlines of all the planets as well (including Pluto). They’d been stickers that Sherlock had bought from a makeshift market that used to set up shop every Sunday.
“Sherlock, are you there?” John’s voice comes again, this time sounding a little more resigned, as if he hadn’t expected anyone to open the door in the first place and is getting more and more disappointed by the minute. This is followed by three soft knocks and the unmistakable thump of a head against the door. Jolting himself back to reality, Sherlock quickly makes towards the stairway. If there is one thing in the world he cannot stand, it’s disappointing John, although of course he has done so on numerous past occasions, the thoughts of which still irk him to his core.
It's exquisite. It's amazing. It's everything Sherlock had expected and more. He'd always thought about it, about how kissing John would feel. Would he be gentle? Would he be rough? Or-
Mary’s wailing is soon drowned out by the sound of police sirens, Sherlock watching as Mary buries her face in her hands, tears streaming down her face as the gun in her hand falls to the floor.
On a peaceful evening in February, Sherlock leaves Baker Street on his own to go out and prevent a murder. (This is his first mistake, according to John.) The would-be murderer: Mrs. Mila Petrova. Thirty-six years old. Wife of Nicolai Petrov, the London Symphony's principal contrabass player. Mrs. Petrova has recently discovered that Nicolai is romantically involved with Ai Lin, the symphony's harpist, blah blah, she's definitely going to kill them both.
Soon, the morning comes, and the weeks and days and nights continue to go by. And somewhere between the blankets and the walls, it all fades back to a dream.
“Yes, yes. Good." John drops his gaze to Sherlock's lap and bites his bottom lip with satisfaction. "You are so fucking gorgeous when you touch yourself like that. So fucking gorgeous."
In fact, the poor man’s observation skills are so incorrigibly poor that Sherlock frequently wonders if he may be legally blind. Why else would he be following him to the kitchen, even after he made it abundantly clear that he was not at
Although John is no longer overcome with anxiety over William, he’s a bit coursing with hatred towards this man. He’s not sure that it’s much better.
“Yes.” John nods his head solemnly. “I see what you’re saying. But it’s different now. Things are different. Sherlock is different. And I would never let that happen to him.”
Baker Street is exactly the same as John remembers. Every wall, every step of the stairwell, every unique scent. Mrs. Hudson greets them at the entrance and gives John a long welcome hug, promising to bring him lunch later, once he’s rested up.
“Wow. Okay.” John carefully sets a hand on William’s shoulder and gives it a few stiff pats. “First of all—not trying to kill anyone. Secondly—I was reaching for the bottle of Belvedere.”
He hasn’t even had William in his bed. Sure, he’s had him everywhere else: the floor. The table. The bathroom counter. The wall, the alleyway, the kitchen. And now, he’ll have him nowhere at all but his dreams.
“Your valliance and courage are admirable traits, Doctor. You’ve proven this to be true many times. But given your unrelenting need to ensure
But for the most part, their unspoken arrangement works. It's as if they've got the best of both worlds. Friends, to sunset. To lovers, to sunrise, to friends again.
William’s mouth forms into a crooked grin. “No. That part’s always free.” He leans towards John again, pinning him with his crystalline eyes. “Worth it, don’t you think?”
William’s cheeks are flushed, and his chest rises and falls with short, accelerated breaths. “You were only gone for a couple of hours." He narrows his eyes.
It’s likely that most of the time, he goes unnoticed by others. Perhaps he sits besides a mother with her child in her lap on their way to Trafalgar Square. Perhaps he calls for takeout and tips generously, giving them a polite nod and a wave. Perhaps you saw him crossing the street once; or waiting for a lift to the fourth floor. Perhaps he held the door for you while you carried your bags; and then you continued your day, unaffected. You did not run away, nor warn others of his presence.
“We can get a message to them, letting them know you’re alright,” Lestrade says. “But we won’t be able to tell her of your situation or whereabouts.”
Gabriela nods in agreement. “And once you’ve collected your beautiful man—“ she says with a mischievous smile—“you bring him back here, and we can all have fun together.”
"Yeah," John chuckles. "Would you like to try some?" He pulls a large bowl from the other side of the counter, dips a mixing spoon into the buttercream and holds it up to offer Sherlock a taste.
Sherlock admonishes, and then looks over to Mrs. Hudson. "Both of you! ...Ugh." Truth be told, he's not actually cross with either of them, and he's sure they know that. Indeed, perhaps he ought to be, but the glow in his chest he feels at the mention of John's name overpowers everything else.
Moriarty exhales a puff of laughter into his ear. “Honey, I’ve always known. I’ve got eyes and ears all over the place.”
“Molly,” Sherlock notes. “If you’re attempting to put out the candles, perhaps you ought to light them first.”
He also knows that he needs the warmth and closeness of John's body right now. So he doffs his clothing, allowing them to crumple into a heap on the floor, not giving a damn about designer silk. With a sleepy, contented sigh, he slips beneath the covers and slides to the far side of the bed. John is on his side with his back towards him; Sherlock wraps his arms around his waist, enveloping him from behind. He doesn't overthink it. He simply wants to be near him. No need for it to be more complex than that.
Sherlock gives him a solitary nod. Oh, he's truly got no idea what he's doing. No idea at all. But with John as his partner, it's a mystery he's very keen on solving.
Though it’s dark, he notes that Brook’s expression conveys a similarly emotional state—a rare combination of pride and awe.
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. He drives his gaze into John as if he's attempting to drill a secret message into his brain.
end." Sherlock's voice trembles with desperation. "I will jump, and it will be over. You will be safe. And Molly will be safe, and Irene, and Lestrade, and Mycroft."
“Sherlock!” John lifts his feet and kicks Sherlock squarely on the front of his shins. “Cut it out!”
Sherlock uncovers his face completely. “And would you maybe want to be...friends...who kiss sometimes? I’d like that even more.”
Though Sherlock is not yet fully roused, he feels his presence before he appears—the phantom in the doorway with a clownlike smile, beckoning him to follow.
John lifts his head to look at him. “You’re alright with that? You’re no longer going to try and keep me away?”
They're flatmates, and that's it. And after tonight, possibly flatmates who kiss occasionally. John is his best friend—the best friend he's ever had. He can't let that slip away. And if John wants to, he can even be the best friend who touches him a lot, and who maybe allows Sherlock to touch him back. That would be a nice friendship, wouldn't it?
Sherlock then makes his way over to speak with Molly, who latches onto him, buzzing about how ecstatic she is that their plan worked. He wraps his arms around her shoulders and thanks her, and she buries her face into his chest, tearful and squealing happily.
"Oh! Hello!” she acknowledges. “I'm sorry, I ought to introduce myself. I’m Doctor Torres. Doctor Watson and I attended Barts together."
John and Sherlock return to the Strand that night. When they enter, John finds that the dark building is now candescent with happy memories. The bar itself, of course—where he laid eyes on Sherlock for the first time. The many walls and surfaces they’ve kissed on and beneath and under. The television, the table linens, the piano. Even the bathroom, where they first gave in to their mad desire for one another.
If frustration is, in fact, what he feels. Of course, it would also be helpful if he could figure out his feelings. He thoroughly enjoyed everything that happened between the two of them in their heated moment of passion—that’s definitely not the problem. John’s snogged men before. He’s enjoyed intimate moments with many types of genders.
Sherlock ignores his statement, because he's obviously lying, and he turns the laptop screen to face him. “Look.”
John sets a kiss on his forehead. “Don’t bother. Obviously, it didn’t work.” He kisses Sherlock’s neck. “...And I can think of
Molly sets the envelope in John’s hands. He stares down at it for a few moments before opening it. Tries to take in the enormity of this, Sherlock’s gift.
"Of course." John gives Sherlock a reassuring smile, taking his hand hand into his. "Would not want that."
John's expression doesn't falter. "My priorities are fine. I will never, ever regret saving your life. Even during that whole ordeal, while I was falling from the building, there was only one thing from my entire life that I regretted." He hesitates; he's said something he wasn't supposed to say.
“My dear Watson. What libations did you partake of this evening that you don’t recall the year, or recognise your own home?”
How can he? How can he ruin this perfect moment, this sequence of perfect moments stacked on top of one another? How can he strike them down, toppling them over like a house of cards?
"Of course they do!" Sherlock says as he finally takes one. "Mrs. Hudson's Famous Fun Brownies. I've told you about them."
In turn, Anderson sets a hand on his shoulder. “I hate you too, Sherlock,” he says. “I hate you a lot.” And in Sherlock’s heart, he knows he means it.
One of the women orgasms with a loud moan; John’s not sure which one. And then there are more sounds of orgasms, and more, and more.
His sighs become low hums of satisfaction as John reaches his lower back, his capable hands pressing against his spine in all of the right places. Sherlock doesn't even know anymore what sounds he's producing; he's too relaxed to care. John appears to be unaffected, remaining every bit as thorough and attentive while his hands make their way back to his shoulders.
the reaction Sherlock was hoping for. He pulls his tongue messily back out and sinks in further, and out, and in, delighting in John’s delectable taste. Widens and flattens it and twirls it in circles against John's opening. Presses in as far as he can to open John up, though he’s already relaxing considerably quickly.
Sherlock clears his throat and summons the nerve to continue speaking. “Apologies for the interruption, sir. There must have been a mistake. I’ll leave you to your texts.”
Molly bursts into laughter. “God, no. I mean, I’d love to be. Been madly in love with that bastard since the moment I met him. But he’s not attracted to women, and, well.” She looks down to her breasts, and then back up at John. “You think a smart girl like myself would have moved on by now, knowing that, but...nope.” She sighs deeply, slumping her shoulders. “Seriously. Fuck my life.”
"It's alright if you don't want to hear about my past, John," he continues gingerly. "But there's one very important thing I must say to you: sexual activity is not always contingent upon sexual arousal. And it most definitely is not always contingent upon feelings, even for myself. I know that sexual attraction, for me, is somewhat of a question mark--I always have. And so I did what many others do: I endeavoured to find an answer. What I discovered was a lack of interest. But I am most definitely interested in sex with you--so I suppose in this manner, you've got every bit of me as well."
“If it is true, Moriarty, that love is both madness and death—let’s not wait for the morning sun. Let me go, so that I may do what needs to be done. And in doing so, not only will you have won, you will have been proven right.”
With that, Sherlock’s movements come to a halt. He brings his head up and gazes at John with a curious expression—a look in his eyes that John has never seen.
John sighs. Gabriela is, by all means, as beautiful as ever. The sundress she wears hugs her curves, and it shows off her long legs and perfect, glowing skin. John may have been tempted by her in the past—but right now, for him, it’s Sherlock. Only Sherlock.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade admonishes, but there’s no vitriol in his tone; in fact, John thinks he can detect a flash of amusement.
For a few seconds, John is rendered speechless, and all he can do is smile at him tenderly. “I love you, Sherlock,” he finally says. “I know my words aren’t as…poetic as yours. But they’re the words I came here to say, and I just want to be sure that you hear them.”
“Oh!” Gabriela jumps suddenly, flinging Sarah away and nearly dropping her phone in the process. “John!” She points to her phone screen urgently. "Look! It's her! It's The Woman!"
fault, you know!" he hisses. Suddenly impassioned, he swipes the candle off the table, watching as it rolls noncommittally onto the floor.
Sherlock is trembling all over with anger, his heart racing so fast he can barely speak. "If you didn't want me to figure it out...why on earth did you set yourself up to be caught?"
"I will," John replies quietly. With Sherlock next to him like this, it would be hard for him not to.
Now, John is thirty-eight years old, and has kissed more women and men than he can count. But there are times he still doesn’t really know the true message behind a kiss.
John halfway expects her to be joking. “I can’t ask you to leave your own party. I can just... get an Uber.”
As they kiss, Gabriela softly guides her back towards the sofa. Sarah obediently sinks down, rests backwards onto her elbows, and spreads her legs open, showing off her perfect pink wetness.
John doesn’t understand what’s going on, but he finally feels as though he’s taken the lead in their absurd little game. His smugness moves up a notch. He takes Marci's hand, squeezes it, and whispers into her ear.
Dim light. Blue walls and floors, spotted with blue squares like a Monet. The overpowering scent of chlorine and water.
He gratefully accepts, wrapping himself up and downing half the glass in one gulp. “What time is it?” he asks.
Taking Sherlock by the hand, he urges him to come along, and they make their way back to the flat. He’s uncharacteristically silent for the remainder of the evening.
John opens his mouth to speak, and something tickles his lips. He reaches up and discovers that he’s got quite the mustache.
“I don’t know,” John says hesitantly. “I’m really very tired, and my muscles are still sore from all the walking I did earlier."
He knows the scent of his cologne, and the scent of his hair, and the scent of his skin. He knows the sound his heart makes as it beats beneath his rib cage. He knows the way his forehead crinkles when John says something he finds repugnant, and he knows the shape of his pupils when John is about to kiss him.
It's not until John is carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair that he notices how small the space between them has become; and he doesn't notice how drunk they both are until he's letting him.
He wants to tell Sherlock that he’s missed this. That there’s so much he wants to say, but he’s afraid to say it out loud. He wants to tell him that he will continue to love him no matter what the cost, and that his love is not contingent upon Sherlock returning it. That he will continue to wear his wedding ring, because although their marriage was an act, his commitment to him is very real.
Sherlock had always considered himself a sensible man, but mourned one poor soul after another as he watched them become pierced and poisoned by love’s razor-sharp claws.
“The difficult part of it all,” Sherlock says, “…and also the most irritating…is that Mycroft’s not entirely wrong. About my tendency to go off the deep end when faced with certain emotions. It’s happened before, and I’ve ended up in very dark places. Mycroft has always been the one to pull me out.”
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his phone, and he shows it to Sarah. “I received a text message the other day from what I assumed was a wrong number, so I didn’t give it much attention.”
It makes sense, John thinks. Their limbs have become pleasantly bosom beneath the table, so he supposes this is a logical progression of body to body contact. And assuming neither of them have additional limbs, he can only imagine what might ensue.
Sherlock separates his middle and ring fingers, peeking out from between them. “Is that what you’d want?”
“Nobody.” Sherlock uncovers his face, which John is standing directly over, rascal that he is—and Sherlock can’t
Their hips rock in unison as the slick, wet, warm heads of their cocks slide together, over and over and over. And they sigh with the pleasure, and they groan, and they sigh, and they groan, and they sigh, and they whisper one another’s names as if it were a prayer.
"I'll tell him," he says. "I’ll tell John about my past. I trust him enough to do so." He means it, too. He's going to share everything. Eventually. Probably not tonight. After dinner with these two, he's sure he'll be a billion percent talked out.
Sherlock has always fancied himself a ravishing, gifted, and humble man of creativity and intellect. Ergo, he is skilled at many things. He's skilled at deducing, for instance. He's skilled at murders (the solving, not the committing, though he possesses the wisdom to be skilled at that as well). He's skilled at the pirouette a la seconde, and he's skilled at playing the Kayser etudes on his violin. He's skilled at not sleeping. He's skilled at avoiding people. He's skilled at making John laugh until his eyes begin to leak.
Thanks for your patience on this update. Life has been wonderfully crazy lately...I actually got married! Like, for reals married! My wife and I are in a haze of wedded bliss, so the emotional and angsty nature of this chapter made it challenging to write—but it’s finally here! I hope you find it worth the wait :)
Sherlock's mouth opens again as he prepares another completely legitimate argument, but he's unable to get a word in before—
“John!” She bends down to kiss him on the cheek, letting her lips linger for a moment. “Come in. I’ll take this,” she says, gripping at his coat and sliding it off his arms as Sarah guides him to the sofa.
She giggles. “Ignore me. I’m just living vicariously through you. Been single for awhile now.” Molly decided months ago that she was done with “losers” and that she was going to take time to work on herself.
“It’s closed, dude. Check out the sign," a man calls out from behind him, and John doesn’t actually turn to see who he is, but John hates him. He recites a string of words, most of which begin with the letter “F,” and he notices the sign on the window next to him. He reads it, and there’s a thousand-pound weight in his stomach.
"Oh, shit. Oh, god." John's face, already overheating from the temperature and the passion, positively catches on fire. He takes a step away from Sherlock, and another, and another. "I'm so sorry, Sherlock. I shouldn't have done that."
A surge of panic stabs Sherlock in the chest as he recalls Moriarty behind him—he hasn't made a peep since John arrived. Sherlock begins to turn, but John firmly clasps the side of his cheek, pulling him back to face him.
Sherlock's face lights up with a happy grin. "It's settled, then—we'll go to Tanzania. After all the murders have been solved."
“Nonsense.” Sherlock bends down to knock on pieces of floorboard, inch by inch. “However, Mrs. Hudson deserves every penny for putting up with that imbecile of a husband for so many years.” He pulls at a board, yanking it loose. It reveals an empty space beneath, and he looks up at Mrs. Hudson with a triumphant grin.
John never mentioned the time he saw Sarah at The Strand with the mysterious man, and he hadn’t intended to. But now that she’s opened up, he feels he probably ought to as well. “I don’t really know how to tell you this, but..." he shifts in his seat. "I’m fairly sure I saw you at The Strand with this bloke—nice suit, dark hair? Arm around your shoulder, whispering in your ear—”
“You have a point, Lestrade,” Sherlock interrupts. “I suppose I ought to be thanking you both for saving my life. So yes. Thank you."
"I'm--" John sputters as Sherlock rouses him with a deliberately restrained touch. "I'm yours, too. God, I'm yours, Sherlock. Wholly. Completely."
John chuckles nervously. “You’re my mate, Sherlock. Mates want the best for each other, right? It simply isn’t right that you’ve never been kissed. You ought to know what it’s like.”
John looks back to William—whose eyes roam over Marci’s body. Not in a predatory manner; he simply appears to be observing her. He then studies the four daiquiri glasses at the table: three empty ones, and another that's almost entirely full.
He wants to tell Sherlock how happy he is right now. And that Sherlock looks happy as well. He hopes they both remember this happiness tomorrow.
"When a person washes with soap," John muses, staring intently at the ceiling. “...they get clean. But does the soap also get dirty?"
John stares at him, with so much to say, none of which, he’s sure, Sherlock wants to hear. So he only says: “Have fun.”
The man’s lips curl in disgust, and he closes his eyes, taking a moment to compose himself. John smiles with the satisfaction of having wiped that smug smile off his face.
“Relax,” Sherlock softly urges. John gives him a half-smile before steadily moving in towards the laptop.
"Completely worth it.” Sherlock bends down and presses their lips together. And so they remain for an indeterminable amount of time.
It’s a new chapter. There's a lot of playful banter, which was super fun to write. Also, John has a beard, now. This should come as a surprise to nobody who has read my stories before.
”John.” William’s voice remains hushed, but he regards him with an alarming intensity, his eyes sparkling like gemstones. “Please tell me the truth. Why did you come here tonight?”
In a minefield of unknowns, John is sure of one thing: as long as the two of them are fake husbands, the kissing practice must go on. They can sort the rest out later.
Molly's eyes are sympathetic. "And have you talked to him about the things that happened to you before? Explained why you're hesitant?"
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “A simple parlour trick,” he says blandly. And it was. Of that, he’s certain. And he will figure out how certain it is. In a moment, once he’s calmed down. Calmed down, of course—not from the unexpected and seemingly autonomous movement of the planchette. Nope. He’s just hysterically thrilled to be here.
Sherlock speaks without a trace of doubt in his voice: "I believe we owe it to ourselves to practice that technique, now that we're able to. For the sake of our art. Don’t you agree?”
He picks up the card, gingerly pulling it from the envelope, and he reads it. Then he rereads it. And then he rereads it again.
It contained useless descriptions such as “you see a future together,” blah blah blah, “united passions, sees you for who you truly are.” Drivel drivel drivel, “makes you laugh, you could spend hours doing nothing with them and have a wonderful time.” Et cetera, et cetera, “their happiness is essential to your own, and it feels as though they are the best person in the world.”
“Yeah?” She yawns, stretching her arms over her head sleepily. “Go to Youtube and search for videos of cute, fluffy animals. That’s what I do when I need to forget about something awful.”
No. They aren’t bloody from the wound; they’re bloody from disuse. From relentlessly clawing at Sherlock’s chest.
John gives in to the upwards tug of his lips; but he instantly decides he doesn’t need to hide it, so he holds his head high as he follows them to the car. Lestrade opens the door for them, and they get in. John takes a seat behind Mycroft. Clearing his throat, he leans forwards to speak to him:
Sarah pulls John in and kisses the top of his head. “I know it isn’t exactly what you’d hoped for, but…Happy New Year, John.”
He follows the echo of footsteps through the alleyway opposite the bar, where he finds William standing in the shadows, his back against the harsh brick wall.
"Oh.” John squirms in his seat. “Is it, erm...expensive?" He drinks wine often, but knows very little about it. Sherlock rarely drinks, but possesses a fair amount of knowledge of ethanol and fermentation.
John smiles. He's glad he met her. She's pretty, and nice, and her laugh is quite addictive; he finds himself wanting to do what he can to hear more of it.
It’s one in the morning, and the two of them have been laughing boisterously over Brook’s retelling of a case that involves a well-known political figure and a few embarrassing credit card purchases.
“Are you sure?” John quietly asks. “That you’re happy, I mean. Forgive me for saying it, but you don’t really seem so.”
“Sherlock, I’m happy to talk about this,” although the tone of his voice is more on the side of impartial. “But I think we should discuss it in person once you’re home. That alright?”
For several moments, they say nothing, but stare at one another reverently. Then, John gets onto his knees in the bed. He drapes his legs over Sherlock, lowering his body down to straddle him.
And since the last time he tasted him, he’s been over and under and beside himself over what to do next. He’s come up with no successful solution. There is one thing, however, that his body and his mind have been screaming with complete certainty over the past 72 hours.
Next up: The final chapter! A little fluffy fluff. A little smutty smut. And all is right with the world. :)))))
John chuckles and kisses Sherlock's forehead. "Regardless, may I offer my shoulder? Perhaps you can lay your head there until your eyes are dry."
The tug at John’s abdomen becomes impossible to ignore. He dips his head, pressing his lips against Sherlock’s throat; against his jaw; at his earlobe. He threads their fingers together, softly guiding Sherlock’s downwards past his abdomen and between his legs. Sherlock takes the hint, wrapping his fingers around his own hardness to take control of his pleasure.
John takes Sherlock’s hand as he begins combing his other one through Sherlock’s hair. “I’m very happy with you, Sherlock,” he says. “I’m sorry I haven’t been more vocal about it. I didn’t want you to be scared or overwhelmed, so I was taking it slow. But I suppose I ought to have communicated that to you first.”
The days go by, and beyond their bedroom walls, there is no fluttering of lashes or tracing of lifelines. Beyond the walls, they simply readjust to life at Baker Street: early morning coffee. Afternoon television. Arguments about refrigerated body parts and whose turn it is to buy the milk.
"Good point.” John brushes his callused fingers over Sherlock's cheekbone. Down his jaw. “And probably this.” Down his neck. "And this." Across Sherlock's silk shirt, just over his clavicle.
John can feel it: he and Sherlock share the same urge to leave, but they also share the same—stronger—urge to linger.
“Hm. Good idea.” Sherlock obviously misses the joke entirely. But it’s fine—because he leans towards John with enthusiasm, and when he does, their knees become gently pressed together beneath the table.
Gabriela begins using a low, breathy voice to share her fantasies with Irene, and John gives in and listens. He’s sort of got to, right?
“Dammit, Sherlock! I've been looking all over for that! And why is it in your bedroom? Please don’t tell me you’ve been—“
John’s body melts into laughter, his hands settling on Sherlock’s hips. “Yeah. The view from arms-length is pretty clear; I’d say there’s a decent chance.”
"Ah." John nods and gives him a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. Nothing has changed. Promise. If you want to hold my hand, you can. But if you don't, that's alright too."
Mary awaits them at the top of the driveway; John and Sherlock walk over to meet her. Somewhat unexpectedly, Sherlock sets a hand on her shoulder and kisses her cheek. “Thank you for doing this,” he says.
“I’m sorry, John.” Sarah is now visibly embarrassed. “Oh, I’m a complete jerk—I should have mentioned something before you came here.”
That vision seems to have played itself out, but as he faces his own mortality, his brain becomes filled with flights of fancy.
"One summer," John begins, "when I was ten years old, perhaps eleven—my parents took Harry and me to visit their friends’ lake house in Texas."
He rests and recovers in a cold hospital room as various medical instruments beep and tick around him. Real. Sherlock is there, next to his bed. Dream. Close enough for John to touch. Close enough for John to kiss. So John does. Dream, dream, dream.
“No, that was just John,” Sherlock says, face shifting into a mask of indifference as he stalks towards his bedroom. He doesn’t desire conversation with anybody right now, not even Mrs Hudson.
“You have no idea-” John mumbles when he breaks away for air, his breaths ghosting across Sherlock’s lips as the man shudders, clutching John’s shoulders tightly, “- how beautiful you are, god.”
This seems to infuriate Mary further because the woman grunts, her shoes squeaking across the dusty floor as she holds her gun up, pointing it at Sherlock.
John’s eyes flick downwards to the vee of Sherlock’s chest, raking his eyes over alabaster skin that disappears into thin T-shirt before turning his gaze to the long, pale column of Sherlock’s neck. John's tongue darts out, licking a long stripe up his lip and Sherlock is absolutely mesmerised.
He fixes his eyes on John’s and is shocked to see a tinge of sadness lurking behind the blue of his bright eyes. He has to say something… fast.
John’s naps usually last about an hour or so. Mycroft might very well call before he wakes up but that’ll be better for the both of them, probably. Seeing John, calm and sturdy John jittery will most definitely worsen his nerves.
Mrs Hudson winks at this, looking like a cat that's just gotten the cream. Sherlock feels like he's physically shrivelling into a ball of nothingness as their landlady shoves the door open, shutting it soundly behind her.
“John take a look at the label. What does it say?” he finishes, turning to John who’s already speed-reading the text on the metal plate.
Because walking down that road could have severe repercussions for both John and him and Sherlock is sure as hell not ready to face that.
He lets out a deep sigh, tears threatening to form at the corner of his eyes. He wills them to disappear as he rinses the remains of the cream off, turning to grab his toothbrush.
Sherlock sighs deeply at this, mumbling something along the lines of “wonder when you got so observant” as he slides down the headboard, his head coming to rest on his pillow.
“You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty,” he says, watching as Moriarty flashes him a rather sinister grin, “I admire it... I concede it may even be the equal of my own.”
“Your mum asked me to tell you to come down for lunch, said she’s been trying for the past 5 hours,” John’s voice comes again, the sound sending chills down Sherlock’s spine.
“Nothing… Nothing,” he shrugs, shifting John’s hand off his shoulder, the absence of John’s warmth burning into his skin, “It’s alright. I- Is there anything else, can we leave now?”
John chuckles, chucking the towel away as he captures Sherlock’s lips with his own once again, tugging gently before shifting off and rolling Sherlock over so that they’re now both resting on their sides.
“But I do appreciate the apology, thank you,” she finishes, changing her tone completely as she smiles sweetly and innocently at him, proceeding to gingerly transfer John's cup and saucer over to his side of the table, setting them down gently.
Sherlock only stops periodically to take bites out of the sandwiches on his plate, choosing to prioritise the never-ending stream of deductions that his brain seems to be churning out. He doesn’t notice that John is slowly piling more and more food onto his plate, and he most definitely doesn’t realise that’s he’s slowly devouring all of it.
“Fuck,” he murmurs once again when he tastes himself on John’s lips, bitter and tangy and oh god, it feels absolutely filthy-
The man is everything Sherlock is multiplied by at least 10, he’s practically a splitting image of him and John has never seen two people so suited for each other.
People make mistakes, Sherlock reasons, maybe she’d just been that desperate to keep John? Maybe she’d just loved John that much?
Sherlock nods vigorously in response and John pulls them up and off, shifting downwards to drag them off his legs. His cock springs free the moment John gets the piece of fabric out of the way, the tip flushed pink and coming to rest near his navel.
He seems to have a lightbulb moment a few moments later, though letting out a soft “oh” as he proceeds to draw his arms away from Sherlock’s body, tugging at his shirt gently to force him to turn over.
The bedroom will probably be next he thinks. He hasn’t changed the sheets in three weeks and they’re starting to smell a bit foul. Yeah, he should probably get on that-
When Sherlock is finished, he wipes his hands on the towel next to him, smiling down softly at the pleased look on John’s face.
“Moving on…” John murmurs, said more as a command to himself than anything else, “your collarbone. Oh-”
“Scoot up on the bed a bit,” John continues, expression morphing into one of doctorly concern, “It’d be better if you rest against the pillows. This might take a while.”
John's breath hitches at this, his hand stilling momentarily. Sherlock’s lids lift slowly, his lashes fluttering as John lets out a soft gasp.
“Shall we go over together?” Moriarty yells, “It has to be together, doesn’t it? At the end, it’s always just you…”
He sets out to guide him, licking a seam down Sherlock’s lips, eliciting a shudder out of the man as he takes over the kiss, angling his face sharply so that their lips slot together without their noses bumping.
John reaches for the dog tags. They’ve stopped pulsating, the tags limp and lifeless as he takes them into his hands. This time, nothing happens when he touches them.
“Your hips, fuck they’re so sharp and angular,” John mutters, “I love it when you wear low waisted jeans you know, really do show off those curves of yours. And that freckle in the corner-”
“But that’s just the thing!” John sighs, “Never willingly. Sherlock, I came this close to telling you to stay away from Victor yesterday.” He pinches his thumb and index finger, holding them up for Sherlock to see.
John might decide to hold back just this once. And regardless of Sherlock’s feelings on the matter, he will probably accept whatever choice John makes.
“Fuck,” he breathes, his cock softening in John’s mouth as the man pulls off, smiling triumphantly up at Sherlock as he scoots back up the bed, his lips meeting Sherlock’s once again.
He blinks, his eyes crinkled shut due to the glare of the Sun but Sherlock can still make out the sadness in his gaze, the sorrow and the regret… And Sherlock’s heart breaks at the sight.
“I’m sorry… that you had to find out in that way,” he murmurs, gazing apologetically up at Sherlock.
John could’ve died, he could’ve very well died. The fact that they’re both alive right now is nothing short of a miracle and Sherlock is determined to treasure it.
“Remember when I came back to you?” John murmurs, raising an arm, his hand pointing to the door. Sherlock smiles in answer, he remembers all right. “I thought that I’d only end up staying here for a little while. Maybe a week or so… But then dinner happened and I realised… I just couldn’t lose you. I had to stay.”
John had looked so beautiful, his eyelids crinkled shut in sweet slumber, snuffling softly into his pillow. The streetlights had shone faintly into the room, stretching their fading arms to caress John’s sleeping form, throwing his face into a brilliant masterpiece of light and shadow, a greyscale chiaroscuro of previously unfathomable proportions and Sherlock had been absolutely entranced.
Sherlock leans back onto the pillow, sinking further down till his face is level with John’s. John seems to sense this movement because he shifts to rest his face against Sherlock’s.
The man is practically radiating happiness and satisfaction, his eyes gleaming in the lamplight as John’s eyes rove across his chest, admiring the bruises that are starting to form along his hips and the dark purple one that looks like it has been inked into his collarbone.
No this can’t be happening, he’d planned everything out so well. How could his subconscious have breached a gap in his mind palace? And why now, of all times-
Sherlock practically melts into the mattress at the gentle touch, his head thrown back in ecstasy as the figure continues to stroke his cheek reverently, leaving soft kisses on his exposed neck.
“-I want it too,” he murmurs, “I want it so badly - to let everyone know that you belong to me and I belong to you.”
“We bonded over our mutual love of Chemistry and as an added bonus, he lived just down the road so we’d meet up every day to study and sometimes play with Buster, his dog. Because of this, we became really close friends in the span of... about a week?”
It’s everything and anything he has ever wanted, Sherlock thinks, everything and anything that he has ever dreamt of because John’s kisses taste like heaven and Sherlock simply can’t have enough.
“Sherlock,” John sighs, nuzzling into his curls and Sherlock’s breath hitches, “It’s fine, totally fine.”
His hands dart lower eventually, taking their time as they swirl circles into Sherlock’s abdomen and Sherlock tries his hardest not to make any embarrassing noises.
He had drifted off to sleep eventually, listening to the sound of John’s breathing, a symphony of soft inhales and exhales, a gentle lullaby that had slowly lulled him back to sleep. When he’d woken up again, John had already left.
If Moriarty definitely had nothing to do with the case… Then, there’s only one reason for his sudden appearance.
He picks up the bottle of pills and cocaine from the bed, bringing them over to the squatting toilet in a corner of the room.
He starts by pouring some of the hotel-provided shampoo into his lover’s hair, taking great care to work it deep into his scalp as John hums, his chest vibrating in answer to Sherlock's ministrations. Scooping up handfuls of water, he lets it run down John’s hair, trickling towards his neck, before lathering again.
John groans in answer, his chest seizing as he reaches for Sherlock, pressing a firm kiss to his chapped lips as he licks the remaining come off of them.
“I promise we’ll tell you everything when you wake up,” he says earnestly, reaching down to grasp Sherlock’s hand tightly. “Just get some rest alright? Trust me, you’ll need it.”
“And now…” John murmurs, his fingers trailing down Sherlock’s cheeks to rest on the hinge of his jaw, “...onto your neck.”
Sherlock hesitates for a moment, stopping in his tracks, fearful of the additional nightmares that the rest of the night could bring before John brushes past him. He slips under the covers as Sherlock watches on like a deer in the headlights.
His fingers gloss over John’s chest one last time, shivering at the thought of the muscle below the layer of skin, before shifting down to John’s belly, smoothing his fingers over the soft surface and caressing the tubbiness there.
“Moriarty must’ve given her an offer she couldn’t refuse,” John continues, sighing deeply, “Who knows really. Whatever it is, she started working for him, playing an active part in his criminal web… Well until he died of course.”
Sherlock has told Lestrade to wait in his car till they’ve completed the investigation. Police presence is often counterproductive when it comes to situations like these and judging Cameron’s current state, any interrogation in that sort of charged atmosphere is definitely not a good idea.
He lets the question hang open-ended in the air, feeling John’s answering smirk against his skin as the man bends down to kiss him.
He angles his face upwards, the back of his neck resting on the head of the chair, watching as the dust motes dance circles in the morning light streaming in through the windows.
“I have a theory,” Sherlock responds, “But I'll need to confirm it. Lestrade can you take us to the crime scene?”
“You said you wanted me to be yours didn’t you?” he starts off tentatively, “Wanted me to belong to you.”
Silence once again descends upon them, except that this time, it isn't the kind of awkward silence that has haunted their conversations since the beginning of John’s return. It's a warm kind of silence, it’s edges smoothed with affection and Sherlock wants nothing more than to drown in it.
He’s never seen John shirtless before, the man is normally too self-conscious. And because of that, this is the first time he’s ever gotten to see John’s scar.
Sherlock nearly steps forward, making his way into Watson's arms before someone groans in disgust, uttering a loud “Ugh.”
The sweat on his body has cooled, leaving him feeling icky and gross. He shivers, trembling in John’s arms as a cold draft seeps in through the window that he’d left slightly ajar.
He sighs in relief, crisis averted. When he's certain that Mrs Hudson isn't looking, he gives an exaggerated eyeball roll which nearly causes John to choke on his omelette.
“Don’t.” Sherlock’s eyes whip back to John’s face, meeting deep, blue eyes that match his own grey-blue ones. “Please, just don’t,” John’s voice seems to crack.
Sherlock as I am typing out this message, either one of us is mere metres away from each other, separated by a thin ceiling of concrete. And I swear to god Sherlock if you don’t start telling me exactly what you’re going on about, I will go down there and have a word or two with you.
John sighs, bringing Sherlock towards him, just one last time as he wraps his arms around his torso. John holds him tightly, inhaling deeply, breathing him in before he lets go. He steps away, his body shaking as if it’s a feat in itself to separate himself from him.
“I’m here,” he whispers one final time as John lets out a broken sigh, sending shuddering static across the receiver.
But Mycroft has turned away from him, moving off towards the side of the plane to chat with his security guard and Sherlock feels his stomach plummeting like a stone, his heart now heavy laden with sorrow.
“Why haven’t you switched the heating on Mr Campbell?” Sherlock questions, gazing curiously at the thermostat in a corner of the living room. Its surface is covered in a thick-ish layer of dust, as if the buttons haven’t been touched in a very long time.
“Another story for another day,” Sherlock smiles, raising a hand to stroke a long line down John’s back. “For now…”
“Hey. Um… Sherlock?” a voice calls, startling Sherlock for a moment. The photo nearly slides out of his hands.
To make matters worse, there’s a madman in his living room, striding up and down the dusty carpet, acting as if he owns the place.
John obliges, timing the thrusts of his index finger with that of Sherlock’s, each round sinking his finger deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s arse.
He watches as John's eyes slide further southwards to his crotch, drinking his fill before turning to look up at Sherlock expectantly, as if waiting for something. Feeling a little self-conscious, Sherlock blushes again in response, refusing to meet the man’s gaze as he tugs his underwear down and off of his body.
Sherlock grunts in response, lifting his hands up towards John in invitation so John sighs, chucking the soiled flannel onto the floor as he falls into Sherlock’s arms, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
“I didn’t say anything,” Sherlock mutters as he swoops his cashmere scarf into a loose knot, trotting past John who sighs and follows in his wake.
“Sherlock has told us so much about you! When he first met you he had me on the phone for an hour, yabbering on and on about how he’d finally found someone ‘worth tolerating’. It’s so nice to finally meet the man in person!”
They’ve fallen into comfortable conversation, keeping to safe topics like horror stories from John’s clinic and Sherlock’s experiences with the dull, idiotic people from the hospital. It’s better than nothing and Sherlock’s just glad that they’re talking again.
Dumping his toothbrush back into the cup on the holder, John makes his way back into his bedroom. It’s a medium-sized room with concrete walls, adorned with a plaid-sheeted bed and drab, dull curtains.
They decide on Pret A Manger for lunch since it’s the cheapest and most convenient option. Sherlock grabs a tuna sandwich while John grabs a watercress sandwich and some fruit cups. As they pile their purchases onto the counter, they discuss the exhibition, bantering back and forth over the ingenuity of the cases or the idiocy of their perpetrators.
“She was HERE?” John all but yells, 5.5 feet of pure rage towering over David’s shaking form as he moves swiftly to stand. “And you didn’t TELL ANYONE?”
“So how does that feel?” John teases, pivoting in and out of his Sherlock’s body as Sherlock shudders, his arms coming upwards to wrap around John’s neck.
He’s only taught John how to do the “male” part of the dance so he lets John take the lead once again as he directs their steps, matching John’s clumsy, unsure footing with his practiced, controlled steps as they twist and turn around the room.
Sherlock puzzles over this for a moment before flopping down onto his bed. He crosses his arms over his eyes and groans.
“Same as before,” Mycroft responds, nodding at John who nods back, “We’ll wait till Mary gives birth to plot out our best course of action… Except that now, she's ten times more dangerous with Magnussen dead. But until then, John will have to keep close tabs on her and try to maintain their relationship.”
He can’t believe that they just had sex in a bathtub and that John is here, right here with him… Never in a million years could Sherlock have anticipated this.
“Hmmm… interesting… one more question for you Mr Campbell,” Sherlock drawls, “Did the girls have any pet names for each other?”
, he thinks to himself, gazing at his reflection in the mirror. All he sees is riotous curls and a face that is way too angular to belong on a human being.
“Perks of dating the British government’s little brother?” Sherlock jokes, trying to diffuse the tension.
“The moment you said ‘Afghanistan or Iraq?’ if we’re going to be honest,” he smiles, surveying Sherlock’s shocked face with glee.
“And only the jumper”, he finishes as John gulps, locking dark eyes with him for a moment before turning back to his suitcase, grabbing a beige jumper and handing it to Sherlock.
The figure sighs softly, an arm reaching around Sherlock’s body to rest on his shoulder, pulling him gently onto their lap.
Chapter Two is here!!! Finally! My internet was down so it took me a while to post. Btw this isn't beta'd so you might have to wait for me to get my wifi stability back so I can edit lmao. Enjoy the chapter!!!
He’s resting on top of Sherlock now, one hand snaking its way into his hair as the other reaches out to cup his cheek, pulling Sherlock’s face close.
“I’m going to show you how beautiful you are,” John breathes, his breaths ragged as Sherlock nods, his hair in complete disarray.
Cameron Campbell is a 30-year-old man who lives in a 2 bedroom apartment in East London. He’s tall, blond-haired, loves watching cricket and is currently crying quite viciously into his shirtsleeve.
The floor is coated with a thick layer of dust, stretching wide and far off to the corners of the room. The ceiling is covered with a sprawling mass of cobwebs, spanning the area from the front of the door to the windows in front of him.
“The creek was a place of solace and wonder for me as a child, mainly because the water would bring in new creatures with each day. It really made you feel like you were an explorer making new discoveries.”
“Well, why was he crying then? If he loved Jemima so much he wouldn’t have just killed her,” John questions.
“Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe,” he says, forcing himself to sound as bored and nonchalant as possible.
“You’re beautiful…” he mumbles when they break away for air, Sherlock struggling to kiss back as pleasure starts to overtake him. “Gorgeous, so amazing… mine.”
“I haven’t seen you around here for quite a while,” Molly Hooper chirps as she makes her way across the lab.
Sherlock blushes in answer, his cheeks reddening as John giggles, pressing a soft kiss to the skin there.
“Are you one hundred percent certain that John and I are in danger?” Sherlock prods, watching Mycroft carefully.
“I’ll take it from here,” she mouths to Mike who responds with a comical salute, turning back to his textbook to study in peace.
He knows it to be true though. It’s Redbeard all over again. Another entanglement, another attachment that could possibly break him the way Redbeard’s death did so many years ago. But then he turns to look at John. John with his stupid wind-tousled hair and his stupid sea blue eyes that demand to be drowned in and he thinks to himself that it wouldn’t pain him much to have his heart broken if it was John who broke it for him. Besides, hasn't he already promised to stop being selfish? If what John needs right now is him by his side, if what John needs right now is a safe harbour to collect himself in before returning to Mary, he will willingly give it to him. He's already promised himself that he'd make the best of the time he has left with John anyways. And if he is to burn in the process, then so be it.
“But why did you have to lie to me?” He finishes, swallowing the words as if they had burnt his tongue the moment they’d touched it.
That’s Sherlock’s voice, his brain helpfully supplies as John calms down, resuming his seat on the bed. That’s the voice that was in my head.
He peels off the pillow and sits up, a frown plastered onto his face, finding himself staring at a John Watson whose eyes are sparkling and full of mirth. He's trying to reign in his chuckles but is failing miserably.
But that can’t be right… they’d ever discussed Sherlock’s friends from sixth-form… well not so much friends as enemies technically, and never once had Sherlock ever said anything about a “Victor”.
“Sherlock, I know I've asked you this before, but where is my chair? I mean, it was here the last time I was here,” John questions from the middle of the sitting room, gaze locked onto the discoloured ring of carpet where his chair used to sit. He turns inquisitively towards Sherlock who realises that he is still standing like a fool in the doorway. He swiftly shuts the door, with a lot more force than he had expected, rattling the hinges. Oh god, Mrs Hudson is going to lecture him about this later.
“I thought Mary would be enough, I was content with our relationship… Not madly in love with her as you’d have expected me to be. So when you came back, I was torn Sherlock. I was- Really. I loved you so much but I had her, a stable point in my already unsteady universe and I was terrified of what would happen if I left her and went back to you instead. Would you leave me again? Would you completely ruin me again? If I went back to you?”
There’s a brief silence, a short moment where time seems to come to a standstill. It’s broken by a soft exhale onto Sherlock’s back.
“A bath sounds nice,” John smiles as he pulls away, his breaths leaving lovely, puffy warm patches on his lips. “Why? What do you have in mind?”
“Well if the bleach was placed there after death, then how did it get into their systems?” Lestrade questions.
Strange, Sherlock thinks. John’s asked him this before, sort of, when they’d practised for his wedding, when John had carried Sherlock in his arms and it had been easy to imagine, even if only for a second, that John was his and he was John’s.
Watson flashes Moriarty a wide smile, lifting his revolver up into the air, cocking it with a resounding “click” before aiming it at him.
“John please just, god just…” Sherlock babbles as John hums around him, finally releasing his balls as he jerks up off the bed, “FUCK ME ALREADY PLEASE-”
“Thankfully, my aunt had given me a book of constellations as a birthday present so I spent my time memorising every single one of them.”
“There’s supposed to be a mechanism that allows us to link up with various pods. By right, I should be able to appear along with your consciousness… But I suspect that our ship must’ve hit an asteroid or something, resulting in the two of us being disconnected from the mainframe-”
He’s always thought that Mycroft eyes looked like chiselled scratches carved roughly into hard granite, like those of still, unfeeling marble statue masterpieces. However, this time, there’s a roundness to them, slight curves around the edges that make Sherlock stop in his tracks and look just a little bit closer.
“These,” he whispers, raising tentative fingers to the dips and creases in Sherlock’s back. Sherlock’s breath hitches in response, his body stilling as John runs his fingers up and down the lines of scars crisscrossing the pale skin.
John obtains an alcohol swab, ripping away the paper packaging before proceeding to dab at Sherlock’s wound a few times. He then sits back, surveying his work quizzically.
“Do you really think that this is what's best for him? Living with a flatmate who is well known for cocaine addiction and destructive tendencies?”
“I’ll come back when I want to ALRIGHT? ... ... DON’T YOU DARE GUILT TRIP ME, YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING SO FAR,” John bellows at his phone, fingers gripping it tight. Sherlock notices that his knuckles have gone white.
He’s loved nature ever since he’s been young, his obsession with it beginning with bees. He remembers being highly impressed as a child with their amazing skills of organisation, with the way that they compartmentalised their jobs and their hive. He'd been so intrigued by the little creatures that he'd come home to his parents once with his long, gangly legs covered in bee stings. He remembers the shocked looks on their faces and the triumphant look on his, eyes bright with excitement about the observations he had managed to make about the bees.
He plants a kiss on her cheek as she does so in turn, his heart plummeting further when he is reminded that he’s hugging the woman who nearly killed him.
“Thank you,” John Watson breathes into his shoulder, a soft whisper meant for just the two of them alone. There’s a warm patch on his shoulder where John’s lips have been and it’s like little threads of liquid gold are radiating from that very spot, threading through his arteries and veins and it feels like his heart is melting.
The clock on the table reads 11:54PM, which doesn’t seem right because how can John not be home yet?
It’s then that John groans, sitting up from his spot on the ground, his body in a cocoon of dust as he shakes his blonde hair, turning to gaze at Sherlock.
What were these things? Were they hallucinations? Errors in John’s universe or something far more sinister…
Sherlock scoffs in slight annoyance and grabs his fork, proceeding to stab at and mix the noodles around his plate for a bit before picking the strands off little by little.
He speaks the words softly, the sound carrying like a voice on the wind. However, it’s not quite soft enough for John not to hear.
“I’m fine…” Sherlock mutters, his eyes falling closed as he buries his face further into John’s chest. If he looks at John one more time, his heart might just explode. “Just… sorry for falling asleep so fast-”
“I love you too,” Sherlock answers, tilting his head to give John further purchase, enjoying the feeling of soft pillow beneath his curls and warm, wetness on his skin.
Irene flashes Mike a Cheshire Cat smile, her lips curved upwards into a sleek grin before she turns her attention to John, her smile faltering.
So what if he does, John retorts, It’s not like Sherlock would want to be in a relationship with him just because he found him sexually attractive. And regardless of the fact, John would never push Sherlock into doing anything he didn’t want to do, especially a relationship.
Sherlock listens, waiting for the footsteps to recede before springing into action. He races to the kitchen, swooping his mobile up in one swift motion.
Something tells John that this time round he didn’t do a very good job of masking his emotions because Sherlock stops in his tracks, blinking at him in confusion.
“You ready?” he exhales, turning to look at Sherlock who nods affirmatively, his body shaking with anticipation.
“I love you, Sherlock,” John breathes when they part for air, Sherlock’s heart racing as John fixes him with a reassuring gaze, his eyes open and sincere, “I love you so much and nothing on Earth is going to change that.”
“Sherlock,” John murmurs, pressing one final kiss to the nape of his neck before curling around Sherlock snugly.
Sherlock has barely any time to react before John tugs forcibly at his feet, sending his head flying off his pillow, coming to rest under the duvet somewhere towards the middle of the bed.
A lady (who for some reason looks like Lady Carmichael?) walks down the aisle, probably the captain. She flashes a broad grin at him, uttering a  “I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir” before nodding at him and walking away.
He takes a tentative step forwards, his body turning inwards so that he’s facing John as he draws up the covers.
"There’s a warm patch on his shoulder where John’s lips have been and it’s like little threads of liquid gold are radiating from that very spot, threading through his arteries and veins and it feels like his heart is melting."
John’s heart swells in response, tears threatening to spill over his cheeks as he kisses Sherlock’s cheek one more time.
Sherlock had been glad that John hadn’t been able to see his face that time because if he had then their facade of “best friends” would have been over right then and there.
The man groans in response, the sound echoing across Sherlock’s lips as Sherlock takes John’s cock in hand. It’s already slick with lube and Sherlock is not quite sure when he missed that happening.
Thanks for your continuous support guys :D I know this chapter is up a bit late but I had a pretty tiring week (I interned at a hospital). My schedule is back to normal this week though so I should be able to get the next chapter up sooner. Also, thanks for waiting so this chapter is longer than normal as a present :)
However, instead of being greeted by disdainful, scathing remarks, John had gotten something entirely different.
Sherlock keeps his head turned towards the window, watching as the sky grows darker. The trees cast looming shadows as their car trundles along the dirt road, its high beam switched on due to the lack of lighting in the area.
They stay that way for a while, Sherlock heaving into John's jumper as John continues to stroke his forehead gently.
He pushes away the burgeoning disappointment that’s starting to pool deep in his stomach again at the thought of John’s name.
“I find it easier to think when I view situations from your perspective. It helps me see the world through the eyes of the common man and your chair aids me in that process.” Sherlock hopes that he doesn't sound like he's bullshitting because to be honest, this response is probably the least plausible excuse he has given for anything... ever.
They drive off in silence, tyres squealing against rough gravel as they set off, back on the dirt road in the direction of the highway.
“You’re also really beautiful when you’re eating too…” John hums, blowing a raspberry on Sherlock’s tummy as the man breaks out into a fit of giggles.
His gaze lingers on the scars near Sherlock’s spine, the dips and creases in his skin all the more prominent in the dim light. John’s eyes shine as he gulps down a wave of sudden hurt and regret.
He finishes in approximately 28 minutes, including the time required for blow drying and combing his hair. He’s decided on a white shirt and a black suit for the occasion, admiring himself a little in the mirror as he searches for any stray curls or creases in his jacket.
There’s a short pause before the man on the other end of the line bursts into giggles, his laughter echoing across the static between them and Sherlock heaves a heavy sigh of relief.
“Well if you really think so,” John continues, giggles subsiding as he tries to collect himself, “then go ahead and talk to the head of the NHS. I’m sure that you of all people will be able to convince them if you tried hard enough.”
And with that, John’s lips sink back down onto his cock, raking his teeth gently down the shaft as he takes Sherlock’s balls into his hand, tugging hard.
His hands and legs have been roped swiftly into a solid, steel chair, clearly, one that Mary had brought along with her. There’s no way one could have found such a nice piece of furniture in this decrepit building.
John produces a bitten off laugh at this, as does Mike. Irene smirks at both of them, certain that she’s finally gotten through John’s thick skin.
“What is it concerning him that’s bothering you?” Sherlock bends into John’s personal space, fixing him with a frustrated gaze, as if John is a child caught eating the last cookie from the cookie jar and refusing to own up.
He’s imagined up worlds with castles, dense forests with thick undergrowths, skies never ending with clouds all different shades of beige.
But if John really prized his relationship with Mary, then wouldn’t he have avoided snuggling up to Sherlock at all costs? Wouldn’t he have seen that as an infringement on the vows he made to Mary? After all, bed-sharing can hardly be considered a platonic act.
And that is when Sherlock is sure, that if he had the chance to pick a moment to prolong in this hallucinatory, drug-induced dream of his, it would be this one-
“John’s worth it,” he spits, a bit of saliva landing on Mary’s face, which she wipes off with a scowl.
“You can’t possibly be serious,” Sherlock all but yells, his face livid as he glares at John, searching the man’s eyes for an answer.
“It's what?” John replies, a little bit of surprise evident in his voice. His brow furrows, as if trying to puzzle out why his chair is in Sherlock’s room in all places, which means that he has to act fast to make sure that John doesn't find out the tru-
Sherlock turns back towards Mrs Hudson who is stirring the tea so violently that he's afraid the cup might crack.
“I’m a possessive bastard Sherlock,” he mumbles, trying desperately not to think about the bulge in Sherlock’s briefs that has just aligned with his thigh, “This night is supposed to be about you, not me. I don’t want to make this bad for you-”
After having lived together with him for so long (one year, four months and 3 days to be exact), it’s become harder and harder for John to remember a past where Sherlock Holmes did not exist and easier and easier to envision a future where they are together (preferably forever).
“I fell in love with you…” Sherlock murmurs against John’s lips, “Probably shortly after we met. It was after we came running back to Baker Street, before you got your cane back.”
John’s face fills up the bottom right corner of the photo (clearly the photo had been a selfie), trying his best to mimic Sherlock’s foul expression.
“However, his company ran into debt due to the economic crisis so Mr Trevor had to shift back to Sydney to sort things out and eventually... so did his whole family.”
He draws up a stool from beneath the sink, watching the tub fill for a few seconds to determine when exactly he’ll have to be back to turn off the taps (6 minutes) before getting up and walking out.
"The warmth of John’s fingers, however, are a stark contrast to the cool of his skin. So when John begins to draw patterns once again onto the scars, the dips and creases of mangled tissue on his back, Sherlock feels them all the more strongly, as if John’s fingers have left fiery trails across his body."
John draws his face away from Sherlock’s slowly, coarse stubble brushing against smooth skin as he pulls away to get a good look at Sherlock’s face.
The moment those words are out of his mouth, Sherlock instantly regrets them. He sees John’s face harden, his knuckles a deathly white as they grip the steering wheel tighter. Clearly, he’s touched a raw nerve.
”Deal,” he finally croaks. She loosens her grip on him, but she doesn’t let go completely. That is, until William returns to the table.
Sherlock grins. “Good.” He kisses one corner of John's mouth, and then he kisses the other. "John, John." Kisses the tip of his nose. “John.” His forehead. “John.” His mouth.
This series of actions is so unlike Sherlock that it takes John’s breath away. It’s almost startlingly intimate—bordering on erotic—much more than he would have expected. He’s got no choice but to sink into Sherlock as well.
“John.” Sherlock gives Molly a knowing wink, and she groans. “John, am I your boyfriend, or am I simply an incredibly sexy, charming genius you put your lips on in your spare time?”
I’ve put so much of my soul into this story, and by reading this, you’re allowing me to share my soul with you as well. That’s not an easy thing to do, but it begins to sum up how meaningful it is that you’re here.
Sherlock laughs. “I do enjoy bartending. But I suppose my passion is helping people. We’re alike in that regard. Whereas you heal their bodies, I heal their hearts.”
John's cheeks become flushed at the observation. He spreads his fingers so that his palms cup the sides of Sherlock's face, and he tilts Sherlock’s head slightly back. He moves closer, closer, until his breath tickles Sherlock's lips, and Sherlock does not stop him.
John falls onto the sofa; his body still tense. He takes a swig of his drink before setting it onto the side table.
Sherlock huffs dramatically. "No!" He's sure he's grinning like an idiot. "I mean. You don't typically speak to me in that manner. Ever. And the playful, childish banter? And the touching? Oh, the touching. The petting!"
“There has always been something between us,” Sherlock continues. “It may not have a name, but it's there. You and I appear to have a chemistry that is, at the very least, undeniable—at its highest level, unprecedented. And I
Once he takes note of John’s hesitance, he inhales with a surge of amorous impatience, pressing John’s head inwards to deepen the kiss himself. John gives in, his tongue finally meeting his, and Sherlock smiles against his lips, emitting a low hum of happiness.
John is skilled at things, too. He's skilled at doctoring. Soldiering. Doctor-soldiering. Orgasms. Carrying himself in an oddly endearing manner while dressed like a man twice his age. He's also astoundingly skilled at the Sunday crossword. Sherlock knows approximately thirty percent of the aforementioned due to personal experience; the other seventy percent, he's simply deduced.
"And although Lestrade is an idiot, he does have a point: they've been happy for us all along, and we finally have a chance to partake in
Sherlock gives himself one final tug. His cock pulsates as he comes too, gasping for breath. Their orgasms pour out in unison, pour out onto one another's skin, sticky and hot and wet.
Harry always teases him for being a homebody. Says he ought to stop studying so much and go out once in a while to enjoy American nightlife. But tonight, he’s far too sober for the crowds and the biting temperatures.
Sherlock presses his mouth to his, slowly and sweetly. “Ten minutes ago, I thought I would never kiss you again, and here you are. These are happy tears.”
Sherlock carefully closes his book and retrieves his phone to check the time. It’s been twenty minutes. His grip tightens. It’s fine. He opens up his texting app to type a message.
Sherlock's hand in John’s is not. It's very, very pleasant, in fact. It fits as if it were tailor made for John's hand alone: effortless. Instinctual. Amazing, fantastic, brilliant.
John. Every hour, every moment of every day, for as long as you will allow—and that, to me, is the loveliest thing of all."
He leans away from Sherlock to look him in the eye. "They're sending me home tomorrow. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I guess I just wasn’t sure how.”
I waited for him to complete the verse, but when he didn’t, I finished for him. “I say unto you do not resist an evil man: if he strikes your right cheek, turn your head and offer him the left one.”
The intensity of the pleasure is so great that John nearly sobs—but William isn’t done with him yet. He quickly pulls his head away and seals his lips over John’s cock once more, sucking and licking at it fervently, his sweat-drenched hair plastered to his forehead, and he’s so fucking beautiful and amazing and—and God, John is coming again, shivering and groaning as he empties himself completely into William’s mouth.
Sherlock opens his mouth, but whatever rebuttal he planned catches in his throat. He purses his lips together and shrugs. "John says many things, you know. But let's not also forget that he was very concussed, and—"
“More,” Sherlock rumbles softly against his neck, cock still twitching at John’s fingertips. “Want more of you, John.”
John kisses him on the earlobe. “Absolutely. Just...give me a moment to gather my thoughts? I’m...not really used to this kind of thing, you know.”
But at this particular moment, Marci’s head on his shoulder, and he’s feeling a little bit smug, and he finds himself needing to know for sure. His eyes dart to the bar, meeting William’s— just as he predicted—but the other man lowers his gaze immediately.
But John is gone. And Sherlock wants to go after him, but his legs are so, so heavy, and the mountain trails are steep and infinite. And he tries to call out John's name, but his throat is quicksand, and the words are trapped in his mouth.
"So will I," Mrs. Hudson says. "And you never know—perhaps sharing difficult experiences will strengthen the bond between you two."  She unhooks her arm from Sherlock's and sets her hand into the solidarity pile. "John's not going anywhere, you know."
“Yes. An involuntary reaction brought on by a boost of adrenaline, often preceded by heightened emotions. And sometimes, when one becomes cold.”
I didn’t ask what he meant. I already knew. An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. A life for a life. I had all but taken his.
by S. Holmes. It's clearly newer than the other books that surround it. John takes it from the shelf and opens it, skimming his fingers over the introduction, the summary, the author's biography.
"I suppose it doesn't really matter," John continues, eyes wandering. "It's not as if we ought to hide it, I just—"
“Please, just call me Brook. And likewise,” he responds warmly. “The Science of Deduction? Brilliant. It’s so good to meet you, Sherlock. I have a feeling we'll work together quite well.”
“John.” A pretty, short-haired woman looks over the threshold at him. She’s changed from her earlier black attire and is now clad in a loose-fitting shirt and boxer shorts. “I wasn’t so sure you would come. I know this is a bit sudden and strange.”
John gulps. “And I would kiss you like you were the most precious thing on Earth. And I would make sure you felt safe, and valued, and—and also, loved.”
Sherlock shrugs. "I've spent hours holding your hands. I've memorised everything about them. I know everything there is to know about all of your fingers, too, like the fact that your left pinkie is slightly shorter than your right."
“Careful. Don't burn yourself," John warns, ignoring the accusation. Sherlock's standing very close to him, per usual. "Just waiting for them to cool a bit. Then I'll add the buttercream filling."
Mycroft performs an odd twirling motion with his umbrella before setting the tip of it back on to the floor. “I came here to ensure a smooth departure for you. And offer you a ride back to Baker Street.”
“Ooooh,” Moriarty drops his jaw dramatically. “Dear lord, he speaks my language. But I suppose it’s not so rare that one would die for their lover. The question I have for you, though, is this: Would you do what I've done, Sherlock? Would kill for the man you love?”
“I don’t know. I see. Would you like to see as well?” He smiles at John, then—and with that smile, John suddenly feels no fear.
John peeks over her head to survey the room. Gabriela is on the bed next to Irene, her hand resting on her knee. It’s no surprise that she’s already comfortably intimate with The Woman, he thinks.
"There is another option, you know." He lifts a hand to Sherlock's head, twirling a curl between his fingers. "Think about it."
But will normalcy even be possible after tonight? After their sweet words, and the even sweeter touching of fingertips?
Sherlock continues to stroke his hair. Per usual, John is very pretty, and he smells very nice. Sherlock thinks he could do this for hours. Has he been doing this for hours? Maybe. It feels like it. Time is odd.
Sarah walks her backwards until they reach the wall. She pins her against it, moving a hand to the back of Gabriela's thigh.
He didn’t even take Sherlock’s pulse. Sherlock was lying there on the ground, and Mary had a gun, and John was so completely overcome with panic and grief and confusion that he didn’t take Sherlock’s pulse.
"That must be dinner." John hands him the glass and sets the bottle on the countertop before walking over to answer.
And it’s fine. He and John will make their way in good time—and the victim will surely still be dead when they arrive.
This must be what it's like to be happy, he thinks. And although he's got no means for comparison, it must mean that John is a wonderful fake husband.
Sarah calls John’s name from the crowd. She shoves her way towards him, and once she’s next to him, she takes his head into her hands.
His skin glows in the low light; snowflakes land in his curls, forming a halo around his head. And his perfect lips part when he exhales, painting the air with his frosty breath.
Sherlock feels his face go beet red, but he doesn’t allow himself to be deterred. Scowling at John, he inhales deeply, summoning all of his strength. He winds back and sprints forward, ramming into the other man with his upper body.
John beams. "Same." He pauses. "Only not right now, because you're going to follow me. We were speaking in terms of figurative following, like in a romantic way, right?"
The florist lowers her voice. “Let me know once you set a date,” she says with a wink. “I could probably move you two lovebirds up on the list for the blood aeonium.”
Sherlock's lips move to the collar of John's shirt; he slips his fingers below the hem and pulls it over his head, and John is speechless and still with anticipation.
After the nurse leaves, the two of them settle back in for the night. For reasons unclear to Sherlock, they don't continue to practice their intermediate to advanced techniques. They fall asleep the same way the usually do—the way that's become their normal.
“I loved it truly, but it soon became apparent that even though I was improving much as a dancer, that it was something that would eventually become a mere hobby, nothing more.”
“I thought you would’ve quit when you realised that I was to be engaged to him,” she sneers, shaking her head, “And yet you still went on your merry way, doing all those… wedding preparations and whatnot. I thought you’d given up already. I guess I was wrong.”
But he stops himself, knowing that if he allows himself anymore closer to John, he might just give in to the anguish and turmoil and kiss him.
“... don’t you?” Moriarty finishes as the room continues to shake. “It’s tearing your world apart not knowing.”
Sherlock wheezes, stumbling back, his deerstalker slipping off as he raises a hand to his throat, clutching it securely, preventing Moriarty from doing any further damage there. However, Moriarty seems to have anticipated this and seeing Sherlock’s hands occupied, he rushes forward, grabbing Sherlock’s ears, twisting them roughly before shoving him into the wall.
Sherlock looks away sheepishly, opening his mouth to say something before being interrupted by another loud gurgle.
Well guess what! After serious deliberation... I've decided to split the chapter up! Again! HAHA you have my friend to thank for this update uwu
He feels like a teenager that has just received their first text from their crush. Not that he actually knows what that feels like, seeing that no one had ever actually liked him back in secondary school. But it is a wonderful feeling all the same and Sherlock finds himself humming as he flicks on the taps, watching the water race down from above.
They have become something akin a team, making up for each other’s failings and building on each other’s strengths.
“Mycroft wasn’t supposed to tell me,” John interrupts, his voice instantly hardening, “I’d asked for a paternity test soon after Lily had been born, but it had been six weeks and I’d suspected that something was up. That’s why I called and basically threatened the information out of him.”
He’d ignored it back then though, believing it to be the result of a shared camaraderie between two very new friends. He’d chosen, unknowingly, to mask his affection for John with cold-hearted detachment as he distanced himself from John, referring to him in his mind palace as “friend”, “colleague” and “flatmate”.
“David, you know what we’re here for-” Sherlock starts calmly, leaning forward to appear more sincere. Something is up and he’s not quite sure what it is-
He sends the message, eyes riveted to his mobile as the text bubble floats up slowly onto the screen. He waits a miserable three and a half minutes, most of which is spent furiously twiddling his thumbs, before he gets a response.
“Let’s just say that whenever we hung out, all we ever talked about was you,” Victor continues, John listening intently as Sherlock makes a sound similar to that of a dying fish, “It was always John is so good at this, John really likes doing this-”
“You of all people have had first-hand experience,” he says before pressing a kiss to the shell of Sherlock’s ear, deliberately dropping his voice an octave, “I’m known to be insatiable.”
Sherlock is not quite prepared for the pain of rejection that he feels. In nearly four years, the two of them have never worked on a case without each other.
“Think about everything that I’ve told you about. All that’s happened in the past day or so, to me, and to the two of you. One clue, leading to another. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence. Maybe somehow...those clues are leading me to William."
Marci screams in disgust, swiping her hand over the table and knocking her daiquiri into the air. It flies outwards, covering John's shirt with bright red juice.
And then, John returns to the kitchen holding a bag full of food from their favorite Chinese restaurant.
“I don’t have a girlfriend. I mean, I did. But we broke up. I’m sorry, Marci, I should have mentioned—“
“You…erm, missed a spot,” John murmurs. “Here. Let me help you.” He brings his hand to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, using his thumb to wipe off the last bit of buttercream. He waits for Sherlock to end the moment somehow—by letting go of his hand, or moving away from his touch, or—anything.
That's when he catches John out of his peripheral view. He turns, and they lock eyes. Sherlock’s grow wide. He pulls himself up from the grass, the glow of his skin fading as if all the blood has rushed from his head.
It's Sherlock who rips his lips away first. His forehead is damp with sweat; his mouth is swollen from kisses. His eyes are dark, his expression displays only unbridled affection.
On another of those nameless days en route to New Years, John drinks. He drinks until he’s convinced himself that calling The Strand at midnight is a fantastic idea.
Sherlock doesn't think he'll mind. This was his idea, after all. And Sherlock’s mixed his own drink to give himself no more than a pleasant buzz. There will be no touching tonight.
This, however, is not half as endearing as what follows. Because once their hands return to the tabletop, their fingers become drawn together, bit by bit—as if Sherlock's hands were the sun and John's were the moon. It’s not long before Sherlock’s palm slips over John’s, his fingers lightly settled on the pulse point of his wrist.
“Funny.” Lestrade’s voice is flat. He awkwardly rubs his hands together until Donovan offers him a seat next to herself and Anderson; and he settles in, chatting pleasantly with the two of them.
John ignores him and presses on. "When you and I looked at the flat together for the first time, Mrs. Hudson presumed we were together."
Gabriela watches her as she leaves, her eyes in a daze, her lips stained with scarlet. “Good lord,” she exhales. “The Woman. I cannot
John’s cheeks turn hot and red, and he’s grateful for the lack of electricity in the age of—whatever age they're currently in.
Lestrade pauses, doughnut halfway to his mouth. "I—I've been here. The security booth is in the adjoining room. You didn't notice me pass earlier? Dimmock even greeted you as he and I walked by."
(deep) down—that doesn't dislike being saved. It causes him to feel strange things like "protected" and "cared for" and "safe," and those are things he doesn't feel very often.
“Then consider the offer on the table. Though at the moment, I’m content to simply be lying here with you.”
"Sherlock." John says his name steadily, because after Sherlock's explanation, it's become apparent that he might benefit from some empathy and patience. "It's fine."
Who knew that attention from John could be so addictive? And in true addict form, Sherlock wants every bit of it. This seems to work in his favour, because tonight, John is giving it all to him.
“Of course,” Sherlock responds, raising a suggestive eyebrow. “But we’ve gone to bed together for the past three weeks, you know. Shall I expect this to be different?”
Gabriela bends over to pick up the book. As she stands, an index card falls from the pages and floats onto the floor. She kneels back down to read it. "Find the woman. She will tell you where you need to go.”
“It’s fine,” John reassures him. Mycroft seems to bring out a side of Sherlock John’s never seen: sulky and a bit petulant; the superb level of annoyance reserved only for beloved family members.
Sarah pushes Gabriela away, and the two of them look over at John bashfully, dissolving into a fit of giggles.
Sherlock frowns, bringing his chopsticks to his (pretty pink heart-shaped) mouth. “An app for what?”
"Yeah." John looks up beneath his dark, shadowy eyelashes. "I don’t think I saw stars like that again until Afghanistan." He gives Sherlock a nod of encouragement. "And how about you? What’s the best memory you’ve got from your childhood?”
He turns around twice, carefully scrutinising the back of his pants and hair until he is decidedly satisfied with his appearance. He looks decent enough for a trip to the museum. His hair doesn’t quite exactly have the volume that he wants but that’s okay.
Sherlock freezes, his blood running cold as memories of that night, that night when they had had the Big Conversation, come flooding back to him.
They’ve come a long way from London, a long way from home and Sherlock feels sick to the stomach as he watches the Rolls-royce he’d arrived in do a three-point turn, revving off into the distance.
Sherlock nods sleepily, following John into the dining room. He doesn’t really feel hungry but he’s got barely enough energy to protest right now.
John seems to have noticed because he pulls away, continuing to stroke Sherlock’s hair, grounding him as he whispers.
“Missed you a lot, love,” John whispers when they part for air, “I’m sorry I probably can’t do what we talked about over text but-”
“John?” he breathes, watching as the figure blinks, their fingers coming up to rest on his right cheek, caressing his skin softly.
He stuffs the gleaming metal object back in its casing, slamming the lid shut as he dumps the box back into the drawer.
“Sounds delicious,” John answers, turning reluctantly away from the oven, his stomach gurgling as Sherlock laughs.
John stares up at him with wide eyes, his gaze tinged with fear as he steps into Sherlock’s personal space.
He raises the sheet of paper containing Sherlock’s list up in the air, waggling it in front of his face.
This must have been taken sometime after he’d come home to London because Sherlock looks more gaunt, more weary than he normally does. And it must have been on one of the few occasions that John had come over to Baker Street since the photo has clearly been taken in their kitchen.
John and Lestrade are looking absolutely gobsmacked as usual. John’s jaw hangs loose before he recovers himself, beaming at Sherlock.
Sherlock shifts so that he’s lying sideways, his head and shoulders cushioned by soft down. He rubs his eyes gently as he jumpstarts his brain, the gears in his head beginning to rattle and turn as he struggles to make sense of his earlier conversation with his brother.
He could have done so much better, could have realised that there was something off about Mary before he jumped off a metaphorical cliff in his mind palace. In fact, he probably should have had his guard up ever since she shot him… NO further back than that, when he deduced that she was a liar.
“In that case, I will suggest that you allow my men to set up perimeter security here at 221B,” he posits, sounding defeated. “It won’t be anywhere intrusive or invasive- although cameras monitoring the access points of the flat will be needed.”
He bends Sherlock’s knees impossibly backwards, thrusting home as Sherlock groans in pleasure, his head falling backwards as John seats himself deep inside him.
It feels like an eternity before John’s fingertips fall from his skin. Sherlock takes this as a cue to turn around.
He remembers crying after, ugly tears dripping down his face as he finally came to the conclusion that he was trapped here forever...
They arrive home and quickly make their way up the stairs. Sherlock charges ahead, dumping his coat on the rack before making for his bedroom door. The very last thing he wants to do right now is to talk to John.
The house in question is situated just on the fringe of the downs. It’s a two-storey cottage complete with a small stable in the backyard. Apparently, the previous owner used to keep ponies. However, Sherlock has been informed that it’s now more a storage shed than anything else. Mycroft has also promised him Wi-Fi.
So in light of the evidence, it wouldn’t make much sense for John to be standing right outside their door right now... but the man clearly IS standing outside their door right now, which means that there is a factor that Sherlock has neglected to consider... which makes him very worried indeed. Judging by the tone of his voice, John doesn’t seem to be angry at him so an argument is probably not what John came here for. In fact, Sherlock would even go so far to suggest that John sounded a little… scared.
“I’m here,” he repeats, slowly guiding the two of them down onto the ground, John clinging onto him like a lifeline as they slide slowly onto the carpeted floor.
He gazes into Sherlock’s eyes, admiring the ever-shifting cerulean orbs there as he strokes Sherlock’s lip. Sherlock’s closes his eyes in response, awash in sensation as he seeks out the pressure from John’s thumb.
The bushes are adorned with sweet-smelling roses and carnations, attracting their fair share of bees and butterflies. It prompts Sherlock to stop and stare, marvelling at how such beauty can be found by the doorstep of possibly the coldest man alive.
He stalks into the bedroom, following John who reaches into his tiny suitcase, pulling out a pair of pyjamas.
”That’s the whole of it,” Sherlock continues, a warmth in his chest blossoming as he gazes down at the smile on John’s face. “If you’re looking for baby names.”
he thinks to himself as he relishes in the light, alternating pressure around his temples, purring contentedly.
“I’m so sorry Sherlock,” he says, planting another kiss on his spine, “I’m so so sorry you had to go through all of that-”
Mycroft’s house is just as he’d remembered it, which is strange, considering his last visit must have been at least 4 to 5 years ago.
It's not that he hates supermarkets but that he hates queues and will hate them to the end of time. He buys everything he needs off eBay and Amazon half the time to be honest, preferring to wait a week or two for his package to arrive rather than waiting 10 minutes in a queue.
Sherlock feels the man’s jaw shifting over the fabric of his dressing gown, feels the steady thrumming of John’s spoken promise in the press of John’s torso against his and instantly feels a little bit better.
“As women should be allowed to do,” Sherlock interjects, watching as Cameron’s face contorts into something quite unpleasant for the human eye. “But please, do continue.”
He’s somehow managed to botch the case of Eustace Carmichael, essentially killing the one man that he was supposed to have protected and to top it off, he still isn’t any closer to solving the case than when he first started
“I thought you would have been better off if you had hated me entirely,” Sherlock’s lip is wobbling, making the words come out sloppy and slow. “I thought you would have missed me less, that you’d have thought ‘good riddance’ and moved on-”
“Sure darling, of course,” he says, smiling as Sherlock nuzzles into John’s neck, sighing happily, smelling the tang of sex there mixed with the fragrance of lavender bath salts.
“I’ve mulled over this for ages, thought about what I could do to fix this, fix all of this. Because look, Sherlock, I stopped loving Mary the moment she put a fucking bullet in your chest. No amount of marriage counselling is ever going to fix that!"
Six weeks since she’s given birth and she’s already fit enough to outrun a whole pack of MI6 agents. Truly impressive.
Scrutinising the floor, Sherlock scans the layer of dust for footprints of any kind, trying hard to figure out where Mary could have gone when all of a sudden, the door behind him creaks open once again.
He'd begun the afternoon a worried mess, pacing about the apartment frantically like a madman, conjuring up, ridiculous but still possible, dangerous situations that John could have gotten himself into within the 3 hours after he had left.
the voices start to chant in John’s head but John shakes them away. He can’t be like this all the time… He can’t.
“Don’t worry about that, Mrs Hudson had me covered,” Sherlock replies, flashing John a worn out grin.
“John, it really doesn’t matter,” he replies, resting his palm on the bed beside John’s leg, his pinky finger only just about brushing his thigh.
He pours out the wine as Sherlock sets the plates of rosti down, placing the roast chicken on a trivet between them.
“Redbeard?” Sherlock breathes, looking out into the darkness, wondering for a moment if the happy-go-lucky Irish Setter is out there right now, wounded and alone.
“I- I’m sorry. I just- I doubted you sometimes you know, doubted whether you were even real. I- It was just horrible. For the first time in my life I felt reality shift under my feet and I wanted something a bit more solid, a bit more safe, a bit more stable. That’s why-”
He’d always been certain that Mary had an underlying affection for John somewhere, that she had loved him to a certain extent. But this? This is brutal, cold-hearted slander.
He takes the head into his mouth and sucks, licking across the flaps of foreskin and Sherlock’s hips buck off the bed.
“Sherlock, what do we do?” John questions, his gaze filled with fading hope as he turns to Sherlock, expecting an answer.
