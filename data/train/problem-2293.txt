John throws the door open and stares in surprise. A tall man with curly blonde hair matted on one side with blood, wearing a ripped suit and a wild expression stands panting on their door mat.
John scowls at him, hating himself that even in his anger he would still blindingly follow Sherlock just because the man told him to.
If John thinks about it now, he would say that actually, she was really quite boring.
“Language, Mr Trevor,” Mrs Jones scolds, slamming a plate down in front of the boy. “Eat your cake.”
John gratefully follows them down the road, and can’t stop glancing at himself in the windows of every shop they pass.
” John says, looks back at the elder man with wide eyes. “
Shifting around, Sherlock turns and rearranges his long limbs so he’s sat cross-legged facing John on the duvet.
John doesn’t doubt the threat for a second and everyone immediately turns their eyes to Sherlock, who shoots John and Victor a betrayed look.
On John's computer, there is a file. And in that file is a word document. And in that word document is a list. A list that John admittedly reads more than he updates, but one he is very fond of nonetheless. Whether Sherlock knows about the list, John doesn't know as he has never mentioned it. But considering his flatmate's temperament of being a nosey little bastard, John wouldn't be surprised if Sherlock has the list memorised.
John flinches at the sound, groans deeply and rubs at his eyes.
Sherlock gives him a hooded look, flicks his eyes up and down John’s body in a considering manner. He shrugs.
The older man sucks in a delighted breath, glancing at Sherlock with a large white smile before slapping John’s hand away and pulling him into a strong embrace.
As they had taken their seats, Sherlock and John opposite one another, the doctor had asked him quietly if they had help with the running of the house.
nothing but honesty; in the twinkle of his eyes, the tilt of his lips, the line of his shoulders.
John’s eyes close as he hears the man’s bedroom close softly, feeling everything and nothing at all.
“So, the last thing you remember is being in bed in London,” he begins, eyes hooded and brows raised.
It’s now Sherlock’s turn to crack up, pointing at John’s face and nose crinkling as deep laughs bubble up from his chest.
“What’s in it?” John asked outright, too ill and tired to play any games.
“Well, where is he then?” Rachel asks a bit desperately.
“I love you.”
“Anything interesting?”
and then Sherlock was being dragged inside by their teacher.
John allows the sharp nails a moment more of indulgence before trying to twist his head away again. Sherlock is mouthing along his jaw now, and as much as that feels
“Good school,” Mr Holmes nods at him in approval.
John’s heart falters and he grips the banister hard as another round of, "Harder, Jesus, go harder!" is heard through the wood.
The first floor consists of a stretching hallway with many closed doors. Sherlock had vaguely pointed out his own room, before leading John further down the corridor to a bedroom at the very end.
Suddenly the panic returns tenfold. Where the hell is Sherlock? Rosie? He glances around himself furiously as if to spot them laying on the grass a few feet away.
John stumbles to a stop. Then hears a shout, "Sherlock!"
Sherlock slowly tilts his head back, exposing the pale column of his throat. A clear sign of submission. And John wouldn’t have been able to stay put even if he were chained to the damn door.
Sherlock moans, now pumping John’s cock with a rough hand that makes his toes curl.
“Did he hit his head?” John throws at the brunette girl, the blonde man standing next to her and looking down at Sherlock with wide eyes.
“I’m sorry, was I the only one who just got chased down by a maniac who was threatening to
“No, no I’m not attacking you,” John reassures gently, “I just…why didn’t you think I would care?”
“Things should be back to normal by tomorrow though,” Toby shrugs.
John spins to see Sherlock incline his head in acknowledgment, face impassive.
Sherlock stares at him for a moment before taking in a deep breath and letting it out slowly. “I guess. While I was away. I realised how much I-cared about..” he glances around the room as if trying to find the right word in the shadows, “People. You.” He swallows and glances back at John before quickly lowering his eyes, “And I was selfish. I didn’t realise how much I had hurt you until I came back and-I don’t know. I just didn’t think you would…” he trails off again, looking pained.
John sat up, ignoring a wave of dizziness before reaching out and hooking his arms under Sherlock’s.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looks at his friend, lips pursed. “We kissed.” He blurts.
." Sherlock looked (and sounded) like a big moody teenager with his face pressed deep into the collar of his coat, even managing to somehow shove his hands into the pockets considering he was carrying a plastic bag in each. They dangled awkwardly from his exposed wrists, digging into the sensitive flesh and looking terribly uncomfortable.
“Nor the last, I’m sure,” John knows this as fact.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock’s asks immediately, but his voice is as soft as John’s, as if he is reluctant to disturb the peace of the room too. “Is Mary okay?”
This room in particular had reminded John strongly of the Holmes’ cottage. The entire space seemed happily lived in, the smell of cooking strong in the air and a fairly large but intimate table was situated in the middle of the room.
He heads for the ensuite and slowly gets ready for bed, smiling softly when a fresh plaster tumbles out of the towel when he shakes it open. He washes his face in the sink, peeling off the old plaster Evie had given him and cleaning the gash on his temple again before patting it dry and sticking the new one on.
John fell down on the sofa, exhausted and Sherlock slumped down next to him and tilted his head back, closing his eyes.
Teddy grins. “Yep! I’ll have to pop round! If that’s alright with you, of course.” It’s more of a statement than a question but Sherlock doesn’t hesitate to answer anyway.
The best thing to do would be take his daughter and go. Leave in the night. Let Sherlock wake up alone and get on with his life.
A warm hand rests on his knee. It isn't the one he wants.
“Said he thought he knew of the assailants and had a hunch where they were squatting. He snuck in at night and stole it back. Couldn’t find my phone or wallet but those are replaceable. As for why,” He pauses and gives John an amused look and John lowers his eyes in embarrassment, “I don’t know. He’s a good person and his best friend’s friend got mugged? Honestly, I don’t know why he didn’t just go to the police if he knew where they were and get them to find the watch but…” He trails off with a shrug and smiles down at his watch again.
John is about to speak but Sherlock beats him to it. “I fell in the shower this morning. It’s nothing.”
“But I thought he admitted to it?”
“What time is it?”
seeing you again Rachel. I do so hope you will stay in touch. If you’ll excuse me.” With that, he glides from the room.
"I know. He expressed that,” Sherlock pauses before a nasty smile tilts his lips. “He was really...grateful." Sherlock says slowly, raising an eyebrow.
John flies his hand faster, can feel the tell-tell tingle in his balls, and then Sherlock is coming. He pulls his head away from John’s and it falls backwards, nearly colliding with the mirror behind him.
The shout is right by the door now, and John raises his eyebrows at Sherlock when he hears the distinct sound of a body being shoved and wrestled with.
Sherlock looks up, hesitates for a moment before nodding his head once in concession.
"Sitting down?" John croaked.
John raises an eyebrow, hand still on the door handle. “Bit dramatic.”
“Yes, exactly,” Sherlock said quietly, “You are sick and tired. Literally. You need to rest.”
Sherlock’s eyes slid down to his lap again and said in a monotone voice, “I fucking hate conferences, why is this old fart explaining to me the many uses of pie charts? Think anyone will notice if I leave?”
Sherlock had shrugged, ignoring that comment because it was a stupid thing to say but he didn’t want to call Victor stupid because he thought maybe that would make him sad.
“I already made you a cup.” John says, pointing at the tea on the unit.
After a moment of silence, John pads towards him, turning to lean his back against the wooden railing so he can look up into Sherlock’s face. Close enough to touch but pointedly not.
John slowly makes his way up to his bedroom, feeling defeated. He lays on his bed, and wonders at Sherlock going out of his way to find Teddy’s watch. It was nice of him. John hopes selfishly that that’s all it was. As his eyes close in exhaustion, John debates adding the Teddy situation to his list, but he can’t quite bring himself to do it.
Sorry for the delayed update-writer's block and life intervened.
Sherlock reaches up with his left hand and touches the delicate skin of his eye as if he can feel the damage in the flesh around it. “Yes. When I was nine, I accidentally administered out-of-date eyedrops when I irritated the surface during an experiment with smoke. The contaminated saline paralysed the muscles of my iris.”
The man’s eyes flicker open, with surprising clarity considering, and settles almost instantly on Rachel's distraught face. He takes in her watering eyes and lets out a low groan. He struggles to sit upright.
Sherlock looks down at the empty mug innocently, “Nothing, I thought you didn’t want tea?”
Thinking about Rosie makes John sigh and collapse onto the bed. He misses the little grizzly thing with her big blue eyes and feather soft hair. Kind of misses Sherlock, too.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I knew that already.” John complained, thinking of the young and shifty sales assistant who had only worked with them a couple of times that week.
"You always get funny when you come home and there are dead things in the kitchen," Sherlock muttered sleepily.
John catches his chest with one hand, the other now wrapped around his own aching cock, and pushes him gently backwards.
"Sherlock..."
When the punishment had ended, a few days before the two week mark was up due to the fact that his parents couldn’t take his sulking anymore, Sherlock had nearly exploded with happiness.
Sherlock hums, inclining his head in a mockingly indulgent manner.
Sherlock considers the question, reaching up to cover his hands over John’s still resting on his cheeks.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock asks, sounding a little panicked.
Sherlock groans, John sighs and Victor grins at them. Then he looks closer at Sherlock and frowns.
“Open up, Sherlock!” Victor’s voice calls through the door.
Sherlock explains slowly, taking the milk out of the fridge.
The taller man’s eyes dart from the floor to John’s and he grimaces slightly. Either at the question or the daunting prospect of addressing what was happening between them. Sherlock tugs slightly at his wrists. It’s the lost expression on his face that makes John let go.
There was some satisfaction in that.
Experimenting with drugs on an odd occasion is very different from ‘taking drugs’, John thinks.
Next chapter should be up super soon!
“Yes, and?” John snapped, annoyance causing a hot flush to rise up and engulf his body.
“Hey, what’s going on? Is he okay?” A loud voice barks, a big burly man pushing his way into the ring.
Although, with these two, it probably is.
“Your erection.”
“I’ve known him since he was a boy. He’s always been the same.”
"When have I ever forgotten the milk?"
“You alright?” He asks again.
“Good.”
“Where are you going?” John barks.
“How’s the head?” John asks, stepping back over to Sherlock and reaching up with gentle fingers to probe at the back of his skull.
"He does." Sherlock replies haughtily, either not noticing or ignoring John's mood.
“Come on then, you definitely seem to need it.”
imagine Sherlock with a man either, if he’s being honest with himself. But then again, he’s never seen Sherlock kiss a man so who knows what that would look like.
John hesitates, shakes his head. “Not about this.”
“He won’t tell us,” Victor mutters in irritation.
The boy, who had been following the movements with keen eyes suddenly broke out into a large toothy grin. His small hands came up into sight and he fluttered his fingers around in such quick succession that John couldn't follow the movement.
“And then, well you were engaged and—I just wanted you to be happy. After everything. After I ruined everything.” He gives a small causal shrug that is a contrast to his sad face and picks up the fairy lights again and John
And he ignored the man’s advice.
“They’re nice,” Sherlock allows, looking like he’s eaten something distasteful.
Sherlock scoffs and reaches behind John to grab the door handle. "Goodnight John."
Many hours later, John wakes again, this time on his side, face buried into the back of a warm neck.
Sherlock holds the stand for a few seconds before his elbows suddenly give and he crumbles hard onto the floor with a grunt.
John frowns in confusion, then darts his head up when a breeze of cold air ruffles his hair from the opening door.
Victor gives Sherlock a bit of a desperate look and his friend actively ignores it, heading towards the door.
"Don't!" John exclaimed tiredly, leaning away, "You'll catch it if you get too close."
John had never seen Sherlock drunk before, had seen him feign intoxication many times for cases, but as much as John liked a drink, Sherlock hardly ever indulged with him. John supposes it isn’t really his drug of choice.
Sherlock uses his free hand to slide up and under John’s shirt, fingers skimming across his stomach and torso, nails dragging lightly on the way back down and making John jerk.
John grabs at Sherlock’s wrists sharply, tugs his hands away and pulls his head back to regard the flushed features and flickering eyelids.
“I suppose.”
Sherlock blinks at him with a blank expression, large eyes unfocused like he doesn’t know where he is.
“Hold still.”
The two blondes had met at university and were close enough, both living in the same dorm, and had kept in touch in a relaxed email-every-few-months-or-so kind of way. Teddy was studying psychology at the time, but was now working in business if John remembered correctly. He was a kind man, happy-go-lucky and always up for a drink and a laugh. John hadn’t got along with all of his other housemates, someone was always falling out with someone else, but Teddy and he had always been a strong unit.
“Okay. Where’s this payphone?”
seven years
“Saw the opportunity.”
Rachel lets out a whimper. “What am I doing here? What are
John collapsed next to Sherlock on the sofa and huddled into the corner, shivering.
giving me a strange look. I’m going to assume whatever Alex slipped me was a cocktail of many different substances, not certain why I lost consciousness though, possible over-exuberance and dehydration?” Sherlock blurts all this in a mad rush of stumbling words, pacing a circle into his carpet with his eyes darting rapidly around his room. He brings up his hands for a moment, palms together as if in prayer and rubs his fingers against his mouth in a painfully familiar gesture. After a second of concentrated rubbing, he unclasps his palms and stops dead near his bed and simply stands there caressing his lips with feather-light strokes.
Sherlock turns to face him fully, leaning one hip on the railing and shaking his head at John as if he’s a child who has just announced he’s Spiderman. “You are. I understand, maybe I have alluded towards...
“King’s College London,” John smiles over to her. “I’m hoping to stay on to do my Bachelors there too.”
What comes out of his mouth though is a polite, "So when did you pop round?"
Sherlock snaps his eyes up at John then, his eyes fiery. John holds his breath. "Or does it make you feel better, knowing someone else is even worse of a person than you are?" Sherlock's voice has gone quiet. John stares at him, can't look away. "Does it make you feel superior, getting to look down at someone for once? Not having to feel so pathetic about your own miserable life, when you can judge someone else who's so obviously
...” John growls in warning.
John licks his lips, glances up pointedly at Sherlock as he does so. Sherlock bites the inside of his cheek to hide a small smile, eyes downcast coyly as he sways in time to the music. Sweat beads at the base of Sherlock’s throat and John fights an overwhelming desire to lean over and lick at the salty skin.
“Alex is a drug dealer isn't he,” John says tiredly, straightening up and crossing his arms across his chest.
John looks up at the ceiling for a second. “That I should keep my distance, something about you being a ‘bad egg’.”
John shakes his head. “It was weird. It felt…”
Sherlock was turning back to John now. “He lost his parents in a crowd and didn’t know where to go.”
“Afraid not,” John slumps in his chair.
They turn down into a street that once would have been full of suburban houses, but now contains what John can only describe as a building site. Some houses are still standing but in terrible condition, broken windows, paint flaking off, overgrown gardens. Some are simply piles of brick and concrete. Outside one of the houses is a large wrecking ball, quite obviously recently used. The taxi slows to a stop and John shoots Sherlock a questioning look as the man pays the driver.
John swallows, twists his fingers together where they rest on his stomach.
“Ballet, really?”
The awful blame he put at Sherlock’s door, after Mary had died, it hadn’t been logical. The
A throat cleared behind him and John jumped slightly, turning towards the sound. The officer was looking at them a bit pointedly, a vague look of amusement playing around his mouth.
right. Like it was many years coming, in a way. But John’s only known
Rachel blinks again. “My purse?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Go on, I’ll meet you outside in a moment.”
John turns to survey him, suspicious. “Why do you want to help me?” They could both be working for Eurus, for all he knows. Or whoever has dumped him here.
Sherlock seems to really consider the question now he knows John isn’t trying to start a row, and he pauses for a long moment before saying in a small voice but with utter conviction, “Because no one ever has.”
a nice day. It is
“There’s no point,” Sherlock says airly. They both turn to look at him. “There is only one bus to London a day and it leaves at 7am. You’ve missed it.”
Blood rushing in his ears, John inches his fingers higher up Sherlock’s thigh before sliding ever so slowly inwards to run across the seam of his jeans.
Mrs Holmes inflates slightly at his tone, opens her mouth undoubtedly for a scolding but John quickly jumps in.
John didn't hit him that hard, Sherlock didn't even stumble, but the intent was clear. John wanted to hurt him. And he did.
“I have every intention to,” Sherlock growls, scowling up at him.
“Yeah, think it must have been your sister. I hope so, anyway, or I think maybe we should be calling the police.” John lets out a nervous laugh.
Hope you enjoy this chapter, again thank you all for commenting! It truly brightens my day <3
John murmurs in appreciation as Sherlock’s long torso stretches out in front of him.
“You stole drugs from Alex.”
“As I was saying, I’m fairly certain that it was Joel,” Sherlock explained quietly.
The three boys all hold their breath, waiting for the inevitable comment about The Dog Incident. But it doesn’t come.
“I swear, it’s like he
Dressed in his soft and borrowed pajamas, John pads quietly back down the hall, taps on the wood once to let Sherlock know he’s entering before opening the door. Sherlock has changed into a faded, too-big and baggy tshirt with ‘The Jam’ logo on the front. It reaches halfway down his bare thighs and the arms just past his elbows. John stares at him as he softly closes the door behind him, wondering where on earth he got it from.
“Nothing,” Sherlock murmurs, a bit petulantly.
“You don’t understand…”
Sherlock blinks at him, jaw grinding silently.
“This doesn’t concern you, ma’am,” comes Alex’s drawling voice, a dangerous edge to his tone.
Rachel gives him a wary side look that screams guilt before stepping away from him smartly and turning to address Sherlock.
Sherlock is lying in a heap on the ground, eyelids quivering as he struggles to take short shallow breaths.
“Don’t take it personal, mate, he’s jus’ a slut.”
John sends him an easy smile and shrugs. “Curious is all.”
“I know,” Victor chuckles, and John really has to wonder at the boy’s intelligence, if he’s ever actually
“Alright there, Victor?” The man behind the counter smiles over at them, wiping his hands down his apron.

which has in turn caused you to reach some sort of conclusion. I apologise for that, admittedly I do have a tendency to play up dramatics. Just ask Victor. Or my mother. Or anyone, really. But, truthfully, you are worrying about nothing.”
"This is the hardest I can go!"
John drops his hand, quirking an eyebrow at him. Sherlock takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly, looking utterly spent.
“You don’t have to apologise. Like you said, I don’t know you. And it is
By the time they get home, the beer is forgotten. Rachel is forgotten. And John makes his way over to his laptop with the intent of typing up a new bullet point.
John nods again. “I guess I’ll just have to ask someone else, then.”
“No,” John lies, but he’s hardly going to tell this stranger that he fell out of bed, hit his head, then somehow transported himself into a park in the middle of the night.
“Wait!”
“You must see it,” John snaps desperately, the other man’s lack of concern irritating him. “How can you not see it? You see
There's probably a plethora of grammatical errors as I am posting this after just a quick skim through, so sorry about that!
"Where are they now?"
They find themselves in a garden, a child’s swing in one corner. Sherlock sprints to the other side towards another low wall, jumps over it too.
When the day came for Enzo to leave, Sherlock shook his hand impassively before turning away. The man then grabbed Sherlock’s arm, tugging him into a fierce embrace, wrapping strong arms around his back. Sherlock had frozen, forcing his body not to lean into the touch. Enzo cupped the back of Sherlock’s neck, reaching down to murmur into his ear.
“Yeah, I lied,” Sherlock shrugs, shameless.
“I feel strange, feverish, hot and cold at the same time. And my muscles keep locking, are permanently tense. I understand now why you want to check if I can urinate John, very clever, a usual symptom of MDMA is struggling to release the bladder. My constant thirst could be a symptom of speed, but then again that could be down to excessive movement. My sense of touch is heightened, my thoughts are racing a mile a minute, too fast for my mouth to keep up with. I feel euphoric- Oh, I wish you were expericaning this with me, John- I want to touch you but I won’t, might make you feel uncomfortable, you
John looks at him sharply. “Why not?”
“Oh. Right.” John frowns, feeling somewhat wrongfooted, not expecting that answer. He supposes maybe he’s been overthinking this. Always tends to do that when it comes to Sherlock.
Again: Beware smelly, foul grammar.
“So, why do you have to do community service in a bookshop? Bit random,” John asks, curious of the reason and if Sherlock will speak openly now Victor isn’t here.
He casts around for something to say, the distant sound of the other two boys bickering drifting over to them.
Sherlock’s eyes finally slide open, the mismatched irises vibrating as they flick over John’s face, around the dancefloor, to the ceiling, back to John.
Sherlock takes a few deep breaths, the pink staining his cheekbones gradually cooling into a normal colour.
“That’s reassuring.”
“And before that?”
John stared at his friend as he communicated silently with the small child, utterly baffled. It shouldn't really surprise him that Sherlock knew sign language, he had never come across a language Sherlock couldn't speak at least some-what fluently, but it still took his breath away every time he witnessed it. The sheer intelligence and talent this man possessed should be the cause of jealousy, but John never could muster up that particular emotion. It was simple awe. And pride. And love.
John glances over his shoulder, spies Mrs Hudson ruffling curly hair with a fond look and Sherlock doesn’t even try to pat her hands away.
Sensing his weakness, the old woman narrows her eyes at the boy and gradually raises the pin into the air.
When Sherlock doesn’t reply, John continues, “You were so…” he shrugs in lieu of an insult, “Before. And when you came back you were,
"What's your name?"
Short and sweet. Just like John.
“Pourquoi?” Sherlock had murmured quietly.
They hang up. John closes his eyes, rests his forehead against the glass window, handset still pressed to his ear. His head is still pounding a bit, but the dizziness has subsided thankfully. He wishes he had memorised Mycroft’s number. Mrs Hudsons. Molly’s, Greg’s, anyone elses really. Now he’s utterly lost. Figuratively and literally. There’s a sharp rap on the glass under his face and he jumps away in surprise. Toby is grinning at him, he mouths, ‘Any luck?’ and John shakes his head. He places the phone back and steps out of the box.
Sherlock grins at him, glances back at the man who is slapping his hands on his thighs uncontrollably.
“Or should I say; not so little anymore! My, you look like a greyhound. Get him to the races Will!” The man laughs loudly at his joke, placing one hand on top of Sherlock’s head and sliding it across the air to line up to the bridge of his own nose, going cross-eyed in the process. “Almost, almost.”
Suddenly feeling like he is intruding on something, John turns away and makes his way into the living room, collapsing on the sofa with a sigh. He purposefully doesn’t look towards the kitchen where he can hear another of Teddy’s deep chuckles and turns on the TV.
With this is mind, John simply tilts his head in affirmation and smiles back. Mycroft quirks an eyebrow then turns to leave once more.
"Why do you have someone else's fish?" John narrowed his eyes at him.
“Yes?” Mycroft asks expectantly.
“I think-” She stops and glances down. Her hand slides down his arm and rests over his hand. “I think...I’ve made a terrible mistake.” She looks up at him through her lashes. John stares in disbelief.
“I’m twenty-three,” John affirms.
“Are you playing ‘Wine Connoisseurs’ without me?”
John licks his lips, watching with a thrill as Sherlock’s eyes dilate and he sucks in a little breath before moving back, a hint of a flush high on his cheekbones.
Well, no better time to emerge from the safety of his room than now. It's not as if he can barge into the living room and demand that they talk about what on earth happened last night while a hysterical client in sat right there.
“See, Sherlock here-” Emelia starts.
“Is this a jar of frogs legs?”
Sherlock stirs again, murmuring something incomprehensible. John wraps his free arm around thin shoulders, feels Sherlock shiver.
“Yeah, alright,” John snaps in irritation, sitting up and glancing around for his jeans.
“Where is she, anyway?” Mr Holmes asks the table in general but his eyes are on Sherlock. Emelia turns to look at their son too, in question. Sherlock glances between them and shrugs.
Sherlock opens his mouth, closes it again.
is a new occurrence. As if, only now, he is allowing himself to admit the feelings he had been suppressing for so long.
Sherlock eyed him without turning his head. "What?"
Victor turns a disbelieving stare towards John, who blinks at him from behind his cup, and the boy lets out an incredulous puff of air.
"Well, last time you forgot my-"
John’s right hand reaches out to grasp at Sherlock’s jaw, fingers tucking under his neck where his head is laying on the mattress. He tilts the face under his palm slightly, and Sherlock allows it before brushing his tongue against John’s bottom lip.
Rachel looks like she’s about to start crying again for a moment before anger fills her expression. She snatches up her coat and bag and, without looking at John, storms out of the door. John slams it shut behind her.
“Go on then!”
Sherlock decided he was quite right, and pushed away the horrible pain in his heart, surrounded the delicate muscle with a tall wall, and had left his room for the first time in a week.
“Just repaying the favour.” Sherlock replied, smiling slightly as they both recalled when John punched that hideous inspector in the face after arresting Sherlock and calling him names.
John doesn’t move until she’s gone. Waits a beat. He sits up quickly, reaching over to switch on the lamp beside his bed. The room is unchanged.
Sherlock muttered something unintelligible and John frowned and started heading back towards his friend. "What?"
Sherlock turns his head towards him, face impassive. This angers John even more for some reason.
Sherlock scans his face for a long moment, and John is sure he is reading the real fear he is trying so hard to disguise. Although, there’s nothing truly substantial to be concluded with that discovery, as it would seem rather odd if John was perfectly accepting of being woken in the middle of the night by a stranger watching over his unconscious form.
John nods in agreement, stroke the inky curls and Sherlock shivers.
“You’re
John opens his mouth but nothing comes out. For the first time since he woke up under that tree, John is overcome with the desire to tell Sherlock
had made the sound.
Suddenly, a loud screech fills the air coming from the house and they both blink a startled look at each other, conversation momentarily forgotten, before darting through the door into the kitchen.
John extents his hand, “John Watson, a friend of Sherlock’s.”
when John rolls his hips against his thigh.
John thrusts harder, pumping his fist to meet every roll of his hips as he stares into those odd eyes, fingers digging into Sherlock’s neck brutally.
“You’re always welcome.” They smile at each other and John suddenly feels quite invisible.
Sherlock stopped trying to move towards John’s retreating form, blinking up at the ceiling momentarily as John gestured angrily up at the black and white cat.
“How!?” John asks, flabbergasted. “Why?” he adds without thinking.
“What did she do?” Sherlock asks, watching him carefully.
They all stop breathing, dread filling their chests as they stare at each other with wide eyes. Then, the footsteps start again, this time walking quickly towards the shed and they all tense. Sherlock raises the plank of wood higher, John clenches his jaw and tenses the muscles of his thighs, Victor plants his hands on the floor ready to propel himself forward.
John freezes for a second, then pulls away with a gasp, rolling onto his back.
There’s a pause where John pretends to look disappointed by this news and Victor gives Sherlock an oddly calculating look. “Did you know that yesterday?”
John looks back at the young man, shakes his head.
Sherlock just blinks at him rather pointedly.
“I don’t know what happened, we were just dancing and then-”
“No. I mean while you were away. What happened to you?”
and Sherlock told himself he didn’t care.
John recalled the case from the week before. It had been short, only lasting a couple of days, and he couldn't remember ever going to the victim/murderer's house. "So you took it?"
John darts a look at him, then back at Sherlock, then notices another figure, much bigger even though further away, also sprinting towards them behind the boy.
Enzo had gripped Sherlock’s face between his large palms, gently but firmly detaching the boy from his skin and holding him at arm’s length. He had smiled sadly at Sherlock’s anguished expression. Stroked his thumb over a sharp cheekbone.
“Unfortunately,” Sherlock mutters. He jerks suddenly and John has to fight not to grin as Sherlock scowls across at his father who seems to have kicked him under the table.
“Medicine,” John smiles, giving in to the man-handling.
“Sherlock,” John called quietly, “Sherlock.” He reached out a hand and shook his friend’s shoulder gently. Sherlock mumbled something before blinking glazed eyes open part-way.
She had only found his body an hour ago and was still trembling from shock, and with her white curls and denim dungarees covered in soil, she had really
“Any progress?” John asked quietly, after glancing around for any eyes or ears.
“Seems strange is all, that being the first conclusion he jumps to.”
John nods jerkily.
Or just paid someone else to do it. The latter being more accurate come to think of it.
Once, a young boy whose name Sherlock couldn’t remember, asked the grumpy boy if he wanted to play pirates during playtime. Sherlock had been
“Hello.”
John huffs out an breath that is half exasperation and half a laugh. “I’m not angry with you, Sherlock.”
Victor flushes a deep red and stares down at the table. John raises his eyebrows a bit, glancing over towards Sherlock, whose lips are twitching.
No, he didn’t want to play pirates! Why would he want to play pirates with anyone other than Victor? This boy, this
“I took ballet for eleven years,” Sherlock murmurs, eyes closed and keeping impeccable balance. He slowly lowers his leg, toes pointed, then does the same pose with his left.
It should have been awkward, the heavy tension as Rudy had stared down the glaring man with an impressive lack of emotion, if John didn’t absolutely
The rapid mood swings are exhausting, so John just shakes his head and slips out of the door.
Sherlock says in a voice of epiphany. “John, I think I was drugged.”
“No I-how old do you think I am?” John huffs a nervous laugh.
John sniffs and clears his throat roughly, willing away the burn in his throat. The mania and terror from the last 24 hours has left him exhausted but his brain won’t stop it’s excessive whirling.
John rolls his eyes with a smile, opens his mouth to retort. Suddenly, he hears the sound of distant yelling, and looks past Victors shoulder. Further up the street, a figure is sprinting towards them.
Sherlock reads something in his face and slumps a little, leaning forward to rest his forehead against John’s.
Thank you to everyone who commented, I love hearing your thoughts on this!
John catches his arms and holds him at arm's length. Raises his eyebrows expectedly. He knows Sherlock is coherent enough now to understand what’s being said to him. True to that deduction, Sherlock rolls his eyes in exasperation and bends forward, flopping his forehead down onto John’s chest.
“Hello to you too, little brother,” Mycroft quirks an eyebrow around the room before stepping inside and planting a kiss onto his mother’s smiling cheek.
"Trust me."
Not that it is a mystery at all, if Sherlock is telling the truth about knowing where the man is. John himself is rather sceptical.
“Fine, it’s fine,” Sherlock says quietly, tilting his head away with a roll of his eyes.
Hope you enjoy this chapter, it was giving me grief for a while!
“I have an idea,” Sherlock says back lowly, titling his hips inwards again so John can feel the tightness of his groin in all its glory.
“Cheap,” John murmurs to himself in surprise, thinking it rather nice that the town had kept the phonebox in the same working condition as he can remember of them when he was younger. Rare to find one that even works at all, these days.
Sherlock had curled up in a fetal position, a strange sense of déjà vu accompanying the ache in his chest.
They’ve never actually talked about what he had done while he was ‘dead’ since the day of his miraculous return. And John had been so angry at the time, he hadn’t really been listening. Never even really wanted to know. But with the peaceful air, the dark room and Sherlock’s face soft in the dim light, he suddenly realises he needs to.
“Me, not you,” Sherlock replies calmly.
John shrugs. “We get on.”
"I suppose not. But maybe it would be good to..." He trails off, grimacing slightly, "...talk about it?"
Sherlock gives him a look that says ‘obvious’ and John smiles.
John waves away the offered pack with a shake of his head.
, this is confusing and utterly insane, but they really are the same person and John would much rather be kissing that ridiculously soft mouth then
A few hours later, after having Lestrade scream at them that they were hereby forever banned from going undercover again, and Sherlock muttering ‘We’ll see how long that lasts’ which resulted in more furious screaming, the two friends finally got home.
Ten minutes later, when Sherlock has begun to slowly reach for his violin in warning, Mycroft picks up his umbrella and heads for the door.
Sherlock Holmes hasn’t had many experiences of love, but in his opinion he’s had enough to be getting on with. And he knows without a doubt, he will experience it endlessly until the day he dies.
“Didn’t mean to startle you. Bad dreams?” Sherlock is peering at him with interest, dressed in a pale blue t-shirt and baggy grey jogging bottoms.
“Here we are!” Sherlock stops in front of an open door and flings out an arm towards the room with a flourish. He’s got a horrible smile on his face as he looks at Rachel and declares, “Ladies first!” with a small mocking bow. Rachel doesn’t move. Sherlock shrugs and moves to enter the room.
“I don’t give a rats arse, bugger off before I call the police!”
“He isn’t my boyfriend,” John snaps, hears himself mentally echoing that statement in a great many other scenarios and huffs a dry laugh.
Sherlock jolts a little at his touch, letting out one long exhale into John’s neck.
Sherlock.
running through his mind.
“He didn't just leave! He wouldn't do that! We love each other!”
When she’s gone, John makes his way over to the table, taking a seat at the head and giving Sherlock a disapproving look. Sherlock blinks back at him, a picture of innocence. John reaches over and snatches the cup of tea in Sherlock’s hands, taking a large quick gulp when the younger tries to wrestle it back and causing some to slosh onto the table.
“When you kissed me?” Sherlock prompts lightly, scrubbing a hand in his hair and making it stand up in every direction.
Before he had the chance to explain himself, Enzo had reached out with one hand and brushed back the curls at Sherlock’s temple with a small smile, tucking the hair behind his ear.
"Oh my god, I told you, I am not buying you tampons ever again. Stop going on about it."
“Well, John, you been drinking?”
“Wanted to do this-since I met you,” Sherlock breathes quietly, letting out a small gasp when John pulls his head away and reaching down to suck harshley at the skin over his pulse point.
“I need to get to a phone.”
"You just did." Sherlock growls, trying to close the door again.
expression on his face as he passed John a mug.
The shadow is smaller than Sherlock, he belated realises. The black halo around its head too long to be Sherlock’s hair.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, simply stares down at the older man with infuriating calmness. John starts to feel uncomfortable at the scrutiny and darts his eyes around the room.
“Sherlock, for god’s sake-”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything in response to this, not admitting nor denying the accusation. He pauses on a channel and chucks the remote onto the coffee table, settling back into the cushions.
Sherlock's eyes come up and rest on John's face, flickering across it. He offers a small smile that is more a grimace than anything. John huffs out a tired laugh and rubs his eyes.
“Can I ask you something?” John says after a while.
Sherlock simply pointed into the alley and John squinted into the shadowed space. There, huddled into a corner, was a small figure. John took a few steps inside the alley, noticing the tremors running through the tiny frame.
Nothing worked, and Mycroft turned up the next day. Sherlock locked his door.
He feels a little bad that that was probably going to be their last conversation in this world, convinced that once John falls ‘asleep’, he’s most probably going to wake up back in Baker Street with a whining toddler as an alarm clock.
Warning for grammar errors, it's my weakness.
He doesn’t even register who voices the query, thoughts spinning wildly and he looks over himself. His face is smooth and wrinkle-free. Hair the dusty blonde he remembers before it had developed the silvery highlights of age. He glances down at his hands, at the soft and plump flesh only the youth can possess, at the uncalloused fingertips. “Oh my god,” he breathes, reaching upwards to brush those fingertips across the delicate skin of his face. He pulls at the neck of his jumper with a shaking hand, tugs the material down and to the side to bare his shoulder. Inhales deeply. Nothing. Not a mark. He prods at the undamaged skin. Checks his other shoulder, just in case. Nothing. “Oh my god,” he declares again. He looks up in astonishment. Toby and Evie are looking at him like he’s officially lost the plot. Maybe he has.
Why does John care anyway? Sherlock is a grown man, he can take care of himself. He can do whatever the hell he wants. It’s none of John’s business. They two curly haired men obviously like each other. Even if they’ve only known each other three days. Even if
“Want me to call an ambulance?” the man asks, frowning at Sherlock as John begins slowly pulling him upright.
Sherlock, still giggling, slides his feet to the floor and stumbles a little before rightening himself, tucking himself back into this jeans and zipping himself up.
“Shut. Up.” Sherlock says quietly, pronouncing the ‘t’ and ‘p’ with deliberate care.
Teddy treats Sherlock a bit like one would a child, humouring and gentle, as if Sherlock is something precious or delicate. To be honest, John finds it all rather condescending. Although, maybe that isn’t fair. Sherlock usually looks deeper into everything everyone ever says to him, as if expecting to find a subtle insult. Which means if there is an insult hidden beneath surgery words, he will always pick up on it. He doesn’t with Teddy, so John forces himself to admit that maybe he’s just hearing what he wants to hear. Why he wants to hear Teddy insulting Sherlock, he isn’t entirely sure. As that is a bit mental. It isn’t so much wanting Teddy to
John wipes a tear from his face, grimacing suddenly as he smears the content of his palm over his cheek.
“Stop telling me to calm down!” John screeched, stumbling away from his housemates arms and trying to ignore how his shivering had evolved into full-on trembling. “You’re trying to kill me, the cat is about to fall down and I am sick of all this
John stiffens at the tone and word.
would be all wrong, he would get the game wrong, he would ruin it!
The boy nodded immediately, moving to stand as Sherlock fluidly rose and held out his hands. One for the child to take and one for John to grip as his leg protested as he tried to rise. John didn’t know whether to feel relief or concern over the child’s unhesitant trust, but then again he was very young and was just grateful Sherlock had spotted him before an unsavoury sort did.
John bows his head, trying to control his breathing. He reaches blindly behind him for the beer bottle but comes in contact with a smooth, warm hand instead. Snapping his head up he realises Sherlock has taken the bottle away and is emptying its contents down the sink.
“I nearly punched Jules tonight,” John says conversationally as Sherlock enjoys the warmth of his palms.
“Listen to me, moron, these potatoes were green when I bought them and I want a damn refund!”
“Yeah. Bit weird, eh?”
John huffs, irritated, and looks away from Sherlock’s cold profile.
Mycroft scoffs delicately. “Why on earth would I have people spying on my little brother?” he asks in a condescending tone. “Who lives at home, with his family and friends?”
When I had regained my composure, Holmes resumed his seat, refilled, and relit his pipe. I lit a cigar and uncorked a bottle of wine. “You don’t often speak of the war, my dear Watson,” said Holmes as I handed him a glass. “It is, no doubt, a deeply painful topic.”
I suppose that, in my misery, I had thought Holmes would surely be asleep in his own bed, vanished, as remote as the rest of London. I was startled to see a fire burning bright on the hearth, and Holmes sitting cross-legged before it on the rug in the old mouse-colored dressing gown. He did not turn his head as I entered, though I knew he must have heard my precipitate descent from above, and I hesitated, almost ready to flee back to my desolate solitude rather than disturb him further. But I was desperate. I came and sat in my old chair. The Meerschaum pipe smoked between his lips, and he looked at me.
“Maybe you could take Eurus?” Mrs Holmes supplies, watching her children.
As Sherlock disappears, John glances around the room feeling vaguely smug, and notices Mrs Holmes’ eyes following her retreating son’s back. Mycroft, however, is staring at John with narrowed eyes. John smiles at him innocently, as Mrs Holmes follows Mycroft’s gaze before giving John a little wink. John nearly spits out his wine.
Even so, John is very fond of the list and sometimes looks back on it just because he can and because it makes him smile.
“Why is that ‘understandable really’?” John asks, folding his arms across his chest.
before.”
An hour later finds them sprawled on the floor panting, backs resting against a wall and surrounded by broken glass, china and wood. John grins as he looks around at the disaster around them. "That was honestly, the most fun I think I've ever had."
Sherlock watches him for a long moment, his smile growing softer, and suddenly he looks incredibly young. Pale eyes glance down at his fingers and he picks at the skin around his thumb, almost shy. John watches him fidgid in wonder.
“No, I will, just..” he doesn’t finish his sentence, just pulls John into his room and locking the door.
John bites his lip, stirs pointedly, and Victor starts a little when he notices him.
“No no,” she cries desperately, “He's gone missing!”
Jules is giving John an unfocused frown. “Why’d you wanna know?”
Instead, the woman leans back in her chair and takes a sip of tea.
you look-”
Enjoy! xo
John shrugs nonchalantly and opens his mouth to speak.
Sherlock had thrown a new outfit at him when they had got home to change earlier in the day; tight black jeans and a plain grey t-shirt that clings to John’s torso like a second skin. Sherlock is adorned in something similar, but with a white t-shirt and an over-large, burgundy plaid shirt slung stylishly careless and open over the top with the sleeves rolled up halfway up his forearms. The overall look makes him look even bonier and ganglier than he is, but with a delicate and almost feminine air that John finds helplessly endearing.
“Is it the light?” John asks lamely, flicking a hand towards the lamp in the corner of the room. “Because I can-”
John wanders over to the window, watching passing families absently.
John nods with a strained smile. He wants to ask what happened in Sherlock’s room, but also really doesn’t want to at the same time. In the end, he doesn’t need to. Teddy gives a bright grin and lifts up his wrist to John’s face, allowing something shining to catch the light. John stares.
“What have you taken?” John asks in a deathly low voice.
“What happened to your neck?”
“I’m not a ‘thing’,” Sherlock had scowled and shook off the man’s hand.
"Yeah, thanks for that. I feel awful," John grumbled. He let himself sit for a moment, feeling out the ache in his legs before hefting himself up off of the sofa. Just as John was standing upright, a warm hand enclosed around his wrist and tugged him back down onto the cushions. John landed with a huff and blinked into Sherlock’s very blue, and very close, eyes owlishly.
Mycroft glances down at John’s hands and smiles. “In all but paper.”
"It is
Sherlock doesn’t look away from his book until John is standing right next to him, forced to lean over his body to grab the bundle where is sits on the other side of the bed. John pauses momentarily as Sherlock runs an utterly shameless eye over his chest, and feels himself flushing slightly in response. He escapes back to the bathroom.
The man stepped closer to the till, trying to lean over it intimidatingly. “Can you not understand me? Are you so slow that I have to spell it out for your stupid little brain? I. Want. A-“
A thought suddenly occurs to him. He looks back at Sherlock, who’s making his way back into the living room, and frowns. “If you knew who he was, why did you look through all of her other pictures?”
Mrs Jones looks back towards John, reads his expression. She nods.
“I thought you were cleaning the kitchen?” John asks, a bit harsher than intended.
John takes the offered hand and pulls himself upright. The world tilts alarmingly for a moment, and he shuts his eyes as it rightens around him.
Acting on impulse, John slips out of bed and trots quietly downstairs. It’s dark, all the lights are off and there is now silence behind Sherlock’s door. John pauses, at a loss. Now he is here, he has no idea how to proceed. He raises his hand to knock on the door and stops just before his hand makes contact with the solid wood. What is he doing? It’s nearly 2am. What if Sherlock was simply rolling over in bed, fast asleep? John would be even more of a dick if he went and woke the man up simply to satisfy his own sense of guilt. His raised fist uncurls and John rests his hand gently on the cool wood.
“For fucks sake! I didn’t want to buy green fucking potatoes!” The man screeched. A child started crying and John was seriously losing his patience.
John blinks his eyes open, his nose cold, his legs too. But his chest, his stomach, his arms, they are all warm. It’s early, too early. Birds are singing outside the open window, where a cool breeze is drifting into the room accompanied by the gradually lightening streaks of oranges and pinks panning across the carpet. Dark patches of the night are still lingering around the edges of the window. He can’t have been asleep long.
Sherlock follows slowly, stopping to regard John with a creased brow as the older boy walks over to the door.
John gapes at them, eyes unfocused. A thought occurs to him. It’s impossible. Utterly absurd. Asks anyway, in a whisper, “What year is it?”
“Shut up.” John rolls his eyes, leaning forward to capture those smirking lips with his own as he lines up their cocks, wrapping a loose fist around them both. He gives a slow thrust forward and they both groan at the sensation of skin sliding against skin, John’s eyes fluttering.
Sherlock tilts his head to capture John’s lips again in a bruising kiss, one hand sliding out of his hair and down his back. His hand comes to rest against John’s arse, and he squeezes the flesh, bringing John’s hips down to slot against his own.
Then he was gone.
Not going to speak openly then, it seems.
“Sherlo-”
“John-”
John heard a sharp intake of breath behind him and suddenly Sherlock was sitting next to him on the cold, dirty ground with his legs crossed. John watched in bemusement as Sherlock's right hand came up and he rested his middle and index fingers to the side of his brow, before brushing them away and twisted them forward into the air as if he was flicking away an errant hair. He pointed towards the child before wagging his finger in front of him.
“Tu es beau,” he had said tenderly. Titled Sherlock’s face to make sure he was making eye contact, then switching to english to make the message clear. “But you are a child.”
“Train strike-”
John gives him a moment, rubbing his hands roughly over his face, then walks over to the open door. He leans against the doorframe, watching Sherlock wash his hands.
She nods, looking him up and down in a manner that reminds John of Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes followed the movement and he took a step into John’s personal space. John’s heart stuttered and he stared up at the expressionless face inches from his own, not knowing what he wanted except that he
The manager had suspected one of his employees, as no one else had access to the freezer and CCTV, and so John and Sherlock had gone in there to find out anything they could. Lestrade had been a bit reluctant to let them, seeing as every time they went undercover something went wrong. But Sherlock had twisted his arm and the DI had allowed them three weeks top and after that they were to give up.
He can’t
Sherlock rolls over too, yawning and rubbing at his eyes with one fist. “I said it’s fine.”
John can practically hear the face Sherlock is pulling behind him. “In a way.”
let alone my siblings.”
Sherlock shrugs away his thanks, picks up John’s pile of dirty clothes and heads out of the room. John glances back at his book left on the mattress, shrugs and follows.
“Tu es confus, oui?”
very pretty, though.” He tugged Sherlock towards him roughly, making the other man stumble and catch himself on the bar to stop him falling into the broad chest.
After a minute, Sherlock’s eyes dart quickly down John’s body, resting for a fraction of a second on his crotch, on the bulging evidence of his desire. Sherlock’s eyes have darkened considerably when they flick back up to John’s face and John can’t help a little pant from escaping his mouth.
“What for?”
Victor finally raises his head to glare over at him. He really does look like death. Tanned skin now a sickly pale and the whites of his eyes are bloodshot.
Sherlock lets out a little snore, shifts a little in front of him, edging backwards into the warmth of John’s body and causing his bum to nestle flush against John’s crotch.
They had sat on Sherlock’s bed, chatting lowly about Sherlock’s school work in an attempt to ignore the strained situation. Then Enzo had asked Sherlock why he had been hiding from him. Sherlock had denied it at first, stating he was busy composing, and the man had given him a doubtful look.
there, isn’t there?”
“Hush, its fine. Go back to sleep.” Sherlock’s deep voice lulled him back into darkness just as John felt the cool flannel press gently back onto his forehead.
John had wandered over towards the loos, monitoring who was stumbling in and out, and Sherlock had situated himself by the bar to try and weasel information out of the bartenders.
John wanders aimlessly around Sherlock’s room, taking in his possessions with interest.
He’s never allowed himself to think of these moments as being anything other than Sherlock simply being utterly unaware of how normal people interact. He pushes these thought forcefully from his mind, reminds himself again that this younger Sherlock is different.
Rachel and her young artist had ended up in an blaring row. Jed didn’t seem, or rather didn’t want, to recognise the severity of the situation. The young man hadn’t even known how long he had gone MIA. Didn’t really seem to care. In the end, after ample refusals to go to the hospital, they had shoved the young man into a taxi back to the flat he shares with Rachel. The woman, cold and vicious at that point, had demanded he collect his things and go.
John can’t stop the whisper from passing his lips, wishing for the first time that he was laying here with
“S'il te plaît?”
about the age gap between them, regardless of the body he now possesses. Makes him feel a little dirty.
When John awoke next, the sun was pouring into his room through the windows and he had pretty much forgotten everything that had happened the night before. He sighed and rolled over in bed, feeling not
As they head off, Evie mutters, “I still think we should get you to a hospital.”
“What happened to you?”
“Really rather unremarkable, a true reflection of your character-”
Thank you again for all your comments and so on and so forth, I love you all! Keep sending me your thoughts and predictions, I LOVE hearing them!
John’s room is grand and airy, decorated in pastel blues and dark woods. It’s immaculately clean and not for the first time, John had wondered if they had a housekeeper or servants, but he hadn’t met anyone along the way. An old wooden door sitting adjacent to the wardrobe leads to a small ensuite fitted with a shower, much to John’s delight.
“It’s a lovely surprise, put that bottom lip away young man!” Ms Bennet swats Sherlock on the behind as she passes him, rushing forward to accept an embrace from the older Holmes brother.
“Maybe he just left you and didn't say goodbye?” It's Sherlock who voices John’s thought and not for the first time John wonders if the man can actually read his mind. Sherlock is glancing up at Rachel now, face half hidden behind the cup as he takes a sip, eyes wide and innocent. John snorts.
In the space of one minute, John’s euphoric arousal had turned to concern, suspicion, anger, then hurt.
The figure doesn’t respond.
John feels his eye twitch. “So you
"No, let me speak!" John slams the door closed behind him, shutting out the light. Its dark now, dim light from a lamp post outside is filtering through the curtains, making Sherlock's eyes glow angrily. John knows he's pushing it, and tries to create a calm air about him. He doesn't know why Sherlock makes him so angry, why he makes
“What?” John asks in confusion, glancing around again. The grass is a beautiful vivid colour, he can vaguely spot families strolling along a path many yards away.
"John, this place is going to be smashed down tomorrow regardless, there's no point crying over its unwanted interior." Sherlock points out.
The door doesn’t open, and then a second later someone bangs a fist against the wood.
“What do you mean?”
“I had a visitor last night,” John states with deliberate carelessness.
“Come on.” The sky moved away from John’s sight, and the next thing he knew he was tucked up in bed shivering madly. John opened his eyes at a squint and saw Sherlock watching him from where he was seated on the bed’s edge.
John clenches his jaw, staring unabashed at his long, lean frame.
Suddenly, the sharp sound of the door handle twisting causes both boys to start violently, and Sherlock rips his hand away as John dives upright, heart in his throat and rapidly scrambling away. Sherlock sits up quickly, staring at the door with wide eyes as they both pant as quietly as possible.
"Oh?" Sherlock steps forward again, now in John's space. He waits for the final blow. "Maybe you're right," Sherlock’s tone lightens. John frowns, confused. "Maybe it’s just a distraction from your lonely, loveless life. Just like your sister’s is a bottle.”
someone?” He says the word like it’s utterly preposterous.
He thinks about John Watson, currently whispering Sherlock’s name in his sleep, his mind forever fixated on Sherlock even when he’s not conscious. Who
Enjoy! xo
John reaches up with with probing fingers and winces as his head stings from the salt of his finger tips. He brings the digits back into his line of sight and nods at the flakey dried blood on them.
“Lovely.” John drawled.
His fingers collide with metal and a soft thud penetrates the silence as it’s knocked onto the carpet.
“You must be John,” she smiles.
John smiles down at the soapy water beneath him, Sherlock’s matter-of-fact answer drifting clearly over to him.
No one speaks for a long moment, and Mrs Jones’ hand slowly reaches out towards a rolling pin in the middle of the table. She fixes her eyes on John, who leans as far back in his chair as it will allow, watching her warily but keeping his mouth shut.
“What?” A gruff voice demands.
Toby was right, it was a short walk. John had stared around himself, wary, as they crossed the road leading out of the park and down a street towards a row of shops and tried and failed to find recognition in any of his surroundings. As the ache in his muscles subsided from sleeping on the ground all night, or so he assumes anyway, John had started to feel like himself again. Actually feels pretty good, considering. He was absently surprised his shoulder isn’t as stiff as a board from the position and the cold.
Sherlock, of course, didn’t know what being in love
“Stay strong, Victor,” Sherlock murmurs quietly.
“John?”
. Like he, too, believed the punishment was warranted.
"She broke up with me." John deadpans, eyes sweeping the contents before grabbing the last bottle of beer.
John closes his eyes. “I don’t know. We were fighting, he said something horrible and I snapped. And I hit him,” he grimaces there and Teddy frowns again but doesn’t interrupt, “Then the next thing I knew, we were…” he trails off, gesturing vaguely.
John blinks. They had never spoken about the list before. John always assumed Sherlock knew of it, but to have it thrown in his face suddenly takes him by surprise. Is that why Sherlock is so angry? He doesn't approve of the list?
“You look older than the others,” she points out mildly, popping a piece of cake into her mouth.
“-Uncle Chris found out, threatened to tell their parents and Joel…” John trailed off, raising his hand and swinging it like a bat, making a popping sound with his mouth like he had connected with something.
Sherlock has reached out, holding the ankle of Toby’s jeans in weak fingers.
John’s breath hitches.
John snaps his eyes open, scrambles his hands back onto Sherlock’s face from where they had dropped to the floor moments before.
Sherlock had flushed, silently berating himself for the idiotic excuse.
“How are we...feeling about that?” John asks, grimacing a little at his choice of words.
John’s phone pings and he glances down at it.
room. You’re allowed to kick people out of it when they’re being intrusive.”
The sound of rustling grass outside stops, as if Alex, too, has frozen. Sherlock edges the wood bit by bit nearer, and John reaches out to grab the other end when it’s close enough and helps lift it from the floor.
John breathes, eyes drinking in every fluid movement of the agile body as Sherlock cants his hips forward teasingly into John’s body. Sherlock gradually lowers his arms, resting them on John’s shoulders before pulling him closer so that their chests slide together as they move. John tilts his head upwards, resting his flushed cheek against Sherlock’s.
There’s a loud yelp and then silence.
Well, John supposes it doesn’t have to be right away. They should probably fix the flat up before opening any cans of worms. One thing at a time..
“Are you sure you don’t want me to call an ambulance?” Toby asks worriedly, glancing around as if a payphone will magically materialise nearby.
"Dennis!"
“And I’m abnormal?” John raises an eyebrow.
"Get out." Sherlock demands instantly, his voice low.
John stares up at his mad, vicious, lovely, friend and the sudden urge to kiss him punches into his gut out of nowhere.
John stares at Sherlock’s lost expression and feels his heart break. He swallows down a lump, he knows Sherlock truly means it. When he doesn’t reply, Sherlock continues.
Mrs Jones gives him a long, considering look before asking, “Shouldn't you be working in the shop today?”
Sherlock’s eyes flick momentarily down to the cup in John’s hand before returning to his face.
(Beware grammer)
"The fish," said Sherlock, as if that were obvious.
John stares down at him, conflicted. By all means, he should go to a hospital. But he knows Sherlock, the man has never liked anyone checking him over other than John. His face is scrunched up in a painful grimace and John knows that if his eyes were open they would clearly depict a certain level of desperation.
"Let go of me!" Sherlock cries again, furious now. He yanks his wrist away and this time John let's him go. He doesn't reach for the door again, though, and he retreats back a few steps.
Sherlock nods, appraising John thoughtfully. “You do seem curiously at ease.”
Rudy is now standing upright, dabbing tears from his face with a handkerchief. He smiles at John, shaking his head in a self-deprecating manner.
John blinks as cloudy blue eyes settle on his face, mind desperately trying to keep up with the rapid change of subjects. The man speaks much like Sherlock does when he’s talking himself through a multitude of deductions and evidence, as if his brain is running too fast for his mouth to keep up.
Sherlock lifts a shoulder awkwardly like a child, then catches himself doing to with a frown.
“Not like you to give up a case so easily.” John remarked. Sherlock shrugged again, “It’s solved.” John smiled at his friend fondly, then gave into an impulse and reached down and ruffled his curls. Sherlock’s eyes snapped open.
John follows cautiously, glancing around in surprise. The house is surprisingly still full of furniture, a table and lamp in the hallway, sofas and a TV in the living room. Pictures have been taken down off the walls but a few remain of scenery and the odd cheap painting. There are glasses and plates on a dining table, as if someone was setting it for dinner but then left suddenly.
"Where are we going Sherlock?" John asks the detective for the fourth time since their journey began. He thinks longingly of the wasted beer down the sink and makes a mental note to buy some more on his way back from whatever hell Sherlock is dragging him into this time.
“I mean, as far as kisses go, that was hardly something to write home about.”
“I get it!” John interrupts, shooting Sherlock a glare. Spies a glint of amusement in his pale eyes. John squints at him, suspicious.
"Come on." Sherlock mutters, hopping out of the car.
“Mm.” Sherlock grinned.
Mycroft’s drawl is heavily layered; flippant, mocking, curious, reluctant, pleased. John doesn’t know how he can convey so much in one carefully worded sentence.
“…you’re back in London for a business conference, but you find it boring which is why you decided to leave early and go for a stroll. Resulting in your mugging and thus, ending up here.”
John stares at him in amazement, at the rapid rise and fall of his chest, the flush of his neck. When Sherlock’s arms begin to tremble where they’re holding his upper body upright behind him, he moves to slump against John’s shoulder.
John blinks, willing his brain to catch up with the words. “Huh?”
“Hey!” He frowns suddenly. “Are you okay?”
“You have an annoying tendency to overthink things, John,” he states in such a matter-of-fact way, considering their positions, that John blinks and can’t help himself from huffing out a laugh.
“What are you doing?” John asks again, nodding down at the lights.
John stares at his friend. Sherlock is breathing harshly and glaring at the floor.
About three months ago, John and Sherlock found a child. Not while on a case, not while intentionally looking for said child, but by pure coincidence. They had been walking back to Baker Street from food shopping and were bickering about the whole ordeal. Sherlock explaining that it would be far easier to do their shopping online and get it delivered to the flat so that they didn't have to go outside, John explaining that he liked to actually
Sherlock turns to look at her with a rather vicious grin. “Let's go and see.”
Sherlock sucks in a little breath, then sits up suddenly, staring at John with an intense look.
Happy Mother's Day to all mothers!! <3
Sherlock had shut his eyes tight, inhaling deeply. Then he had unlocked the door and opened it slowly. The man on the other side smiled winningly at him, and Sherlock’s chest had grown tight at the sight.
was and exclaiming how,
Teddy went on to express his appreciation at John living so near and letting him sit in for a while.
“Oh. Cheers, you’re a lifesaver.”
Sherlock,” John had muttered desperately.
John jumps in surprise and glares back at Sherlock who is standing in the doorway. How is the man always sneaking up on him? Sherlock doesn't need an answer and John isn't going to give him one. He slams his laptop shut and gets up, stomping to the fridge.
“Sherlock?” John whispers pointedly, shaking out his legs.
John sighs and rolls over onto his back. He hears movement in the bedroom below him.
“That I can definitely imagine.”
They head outside, nodding their thanks to the man, and hover outside the shop window, leaning their backs on the glass.
Mrs Jones lowers her arm again, looking satisfied and places the pin back on the table before turning those fierce eyes onto Sherlock again.
Mycroft scans his face for a few seconds before humming a small chuckle. “He holds quite an influence over you, I see. Although I cannot say I’m surprised, you do seem the type.”
Which is odd, in a way. John has never really been able to picture Mycroft as a young man, just assumed he came into this world looking vaguely stressed with a receding hairline. John watches as his blue eyes pan over to his brother as his mother pats him affectionately on the cheek, and John wonders at their relationship in this world.
Sherlock jerks upright, fixing a pained smile on his face. “I said ‘cheese and rice”. John asked me what I used to eat at university.”
Sherlock breaks out of the kiss with a gasp for air, and John immediately attaches his mouth to that pale throat, grazing his teeth down to suck at one sharp collarbone.
“Yup,” John nods, shifting his own body to mirror Sherlock’s position. Takes a moment to relish the fact he can cross his legs without any twinges in his joints.
There’s a tense pause, then Mycroft sniffs and raises an eyebrow. “Don’t get too comfortable, Mr Watson. Remember, you and my brother have only just met. Do not fall under an assumption that you
The first time this happened, Sherlock had curled up in a fetal position on the sofa, heart aching in a way long-forgotten, and was utterly convinced he would never see the doctor again. Then, hours later, John had swung back into the flat, smelling of alcohol and sweat, had stumbled into the kitchen to turn on the kettle before padding into the living room and stopping short.
“And?”
Rachel flicks an aghast expression between the two of them and John shakes himself.
So yes, as much as it
“Stop punishing yourself like dis,” he kissed Sherlock’s cheek. “Au revoir,
"For fuck's sake."
Sherlock is still laying sprawled, this time with his book held open above his face. He must of nipped back to his room while John was in the shower.
Sherlock makes him feel like a teenager again. Flustered, excited, aroused. He wonders if Sherlock from home has ever made him feel like that and nearly snorts out loud.
“Of course.” Sherlock sits up and looks John up and down again. John crosses his arms over his chest, scowling.
people, no.” Long fingers flex air quotes, accompany the word.
Sherlock nods next to him, "I particularly enjoyed smashing up the TV with that big plank of wood."
Sherlock turns his head away from their loud questions with a grimace, muttering something about
Before he can answer, Victor is giving Sherlock a rueful look. “I swear, you’re always covered in bruises.” He shakes his head, eyes now trained on the older, now yellowing, bruise on the other side of his neck.
Rachel gives him a disgusted look and turns away, aiming the look at John instead. “How can you live with someone like that?”
“Alright there, Sherlock? Heard you had a little tumble.”
"Is this what this is all about?" John asks, irritated, "You don't like to be reminded that you're human?"
“John, ma’am,” he corrects politely, taking a gulp of hot tea.
He doesn’t tell John he loves him. Not that night. Or the next.
“You play?” John asks moving towards it, never really having given thought to Sherlock being able to play multiple instruments having only seen him with a violin under his chin, bow in hand. Seems ridiculous never to have entertained that thought before, considering.
The woman is sitting in Sherlock’s chair, which looks all wrong, and she raises her puffy and bloodshot eyes at him pitifully before all but leaping out of the seat.
When she turns around again to grab some bread, he flings the cloth at Victor’s face where it lands with a wet slap.
John moves closer, eyes devouring Sherlock’s face, his chest, his softening cock and limp thighs as he pulls his fist over himself. Sherlock watches him, enraptured, and then slowly inches his t-shirt up over his flat stomach, exposing the tense muscles of his abdomen.
“I think you’ll find it’s
Then, Mrs Holmes is snapping her eyes away as Alfie moves to pass her, heading towards the door where Sherlock just escaped. With surprising quickness, she grips onto his arm, stilling him, and tugs the man closer into the conversation. John can’t hear what she’s saying, and her face seems pleasant enough, except he can see that her eyes are hard, as are the corners of her smile, and for the first time John wonders with a pang, just how ignorant she really lets on.
John has to accede that was probably a fair point and just shrugs in reply with a look of resignation that makes the man chuckle again. John glances around, notices the cups of tea left abandoned on the unit and two thoughts pop into his head. The first being;
One of the most surreal moments of John's life was when he and Sherlock had to go undercover in Tesco. As sales assistants. For three weeks.
"Where are you parents?" John tried again.
Rudy all day since Mycroft and his Uncle’s arrival. As far as John could see, Alfie hadn’t even greeted the elder man. And it wasn’t until much later on in the evening (when lunch had turned into drinks and drinks had turned into more drinks, which had then turned into dancing which had turned into pre-dinner drinks) when Alfie had then begun telling a loud and rather derogatory story about a man who used to work with him and Emelia years prior, when Rudy had cut across him saying;
Sherlock's eyes slide to meet his then he quickly looks away again.
Sherlock ignores her completely as his eyes flit over the screen. His eyebrows twitch upwards for a second before his face turns expressionless, the movement so quick John couldn't be sure he hadn't imagined it. He studies the picture for another moment before using his thumb to swipe right. Rachel twitches slightly towards him as he glances through her photos, but drops her hand just as quickly. After a minute or so, Sherlock stops swiping and pauses at a picture. He glances up at Rachel with a puckish look. She turns a deep red, huffs and holds out her hand expectantly. Sherlock's lips twitch but he tosses the phone at her without looking back at the screen. She fumbles to catch it, tapping the screen off as soon as it's steady. Not that John was looking.
They stand there, panting, eyes boring fiercely into each other. John wants to grab at him, shake him, to hit him again. He wants Sherlock to hit him back. He wants….
John’s eyes narrow dangerously and opens his mouth to give a scathing response, but Sherlock beats him to it.
He does, however, sometimes goes back to it for a nostalgic read-through.
John lets go of Sherlock’s arms, slides his hands into the curly hair. “Why?”
Sherlock’s teeth bite into his bottom lip in an attempt to muffle the low noise trying to rip from his throat, and if they were anywhere else John would have forced his lips apart to hear it.
Greg flicks his eyes between John and Sherlock, throws the former a knowing smirk and clears his throat.
“We were smoking last night,” Sherlock nods over to the mug on his bedside table where the ash from their spliff still sits inside. “That’ll be the smell.”
“He said he can’t give you a refund. Have a nice day.” Sherlock drawled, his eyes narrowing on the man still sat stunned on the floor.
“No,” John forces a casual tone, “Just finishing a blog entry."
about what was happening between them. But this is John and Sherlock. The epitome of poor communication and English aloofness.
Afterwards, when his sweat was cooling his flushed skin, he would roughly scrub himself off with an old t-shirt and then punch his pillow over and over again.
When Sherlock couldn’t take it anymore, the ache in his groin too much and worried the man could hear his rapidly beating heart, he would give Enzo a side-eyed glare, careful not to turn his head towards him too much, and the man would chuckle and retreat. Sherlock’s relief and disappointment following him out of the room.
John is starting to feel quite unsure of himself, wonders what on earth the detective is thinking. As a show of bravado, John spreads his hands up in a shrug and leans further back into the sofa, a perfect picture of ease. It lasts for about a second. As soon as John moves, Sherlock follows and crowds into him. Onto him. Knees pressing into the cushions on either side of John's hips, hands mirrored on either side of his head, gripping the back of the seat.
And then Sherlock had grinned and grinned and the ache in his chest had switched from painful to
Sherlock locks his own fingers around the back of John’s neck, leaning his face down into the muscle of his shoulder. He breathes shallow and rapidly into the material of John’s shirt, shivering madly against him as they gyrate shamelessly into each other.
Sherlock sucks his bottom lip into his mouth, hesitates for one second before darting a quick look over his shoulder. He visibly relaxes, letting out a little breath and not meeting John’s eyes.
“Where’s Sherlock?” Teddy asks, glancing around as if the man is going to emerge into view.
They sit like that for a minute. Two.
John had briefly wondered if Rudy and Alfie had ever met before, would be surprised if they hadn’t, but that interaction just cemented the fact that: yes, they knew each other. They just didn’t like each other. And it was endlessly refreshing.
He gives John a small quick quirk of his lips and John grins back at him, watching him stroll leisurely away.
“Don’t apologise,” comes a sleepy murmur.
“Uncle.” Sherlock corrected smugly.
Rudy gasps loudly, placing an offended hand over his heart.
John stomps over to the front door and flings it wide. “Bye, Rachel.”
Sherlock keeps staring at him. John rolls his eyes, pushing him towards the kitchen door. “Just do it, please.”
John almost spills the water. Teddy frowns again.
“Okay,” John says, shrugs away from Sherlock and back into his room.
But then again, this isn’t
“Oh, John!” She wails, throwing herself into his arms and sobbing. John catches her to stop himself toppling over, glancing at Sherlock with wide eyes.
Victor raises his head slowly, staring at them as if they’ve gone mad.
slip anything into my drink?”
he’s trying to memorise the feeling with every soft brush of his fingertips.
John tried to answer but his throat was unhelpfully made of sandpaper. Sherlock reached over to the bedside table, dumping what looked like a damp flannel on the wood before bringing a glass of cool water to John’s dry lips.
“And that was yesterday?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“A’right John?”
Feeling a bit unsettled, John sends a quick searching look down a his hands, relieved to find them still smooth with youth.
When they arrive at the cafe, John has somewhat cleared his head. Well, as much as is possible considering he’s fairly certain that somehow he has gone
“You passed out.”
Suddenly Sherlock stops, takes three quick steps towards John and wraps his arms around his shoulders in a fierce embrace.
“John?”
Mycroft hesitates, glances over his shoulder. “Both of them.” He slips back inside the house.
They stare at each other for a long moment, both breathing shallowly as they rest on opposite sides of the room.
“No really, I’m fine.” When she gives John a side-look of doubt he says, “Trust me, I’m a doctor.”
“Tea?” Sherlock holds up a mug in John’s direction.
“Pretty thing has a mouth on him,” the man had smirked, eye’s gleaming dangerously.
She opens her mouth again but nothing comes out.
John hesitates, not wanting to hurt Sherlock’s feeling while he’s in this vulnerable state. Sherlock, however, picks up on this instantly and says, “He was bad-mouthing me, I take it?”
“And remember to put the milk away.”
Done is the time for teasing, John can’t stand the ache anymore and he reaches under the waistband of Sherlock’s pants and grips the long, silky soft flesh underneath.
John reaches out instead to grasp Sherlock’s waist, hands sliding slowly around to the small of his back. Feeling bold, he tugs Sherlock forward, their hips slotting together deliciously. Sherlock’s teeth make a quick appearance, biting at his bottom lip for a moment as he closes his eyes.
John had stared at his friend, wondering he had officially gone mad when Teddy had laughed again, this time in delight. Sherlock gave a small smug smile and produced his hidden hand, his phone in it and Teddy’s Facebook page on the screen.
“I’m not sure,” John answers Evie truthfully.
The admission came from nowhere, Sherlock didn’t even know he had been thinking it at the time but he must have done, because he said it.
John hadn’t even blinked. Had snapped, “I love you too,” right back and crushed his mouth to Sherlock’s with bruising force.
“Alex!?” Victor cries, also looking back and stumbling, dropping his chips.
"Great."
Maybe this younger Sherlock, not traumatised by his sister’s actions, is less guarded when it comes to relationships. Maybe this Sherlock
They stare at each other for a moment, eyes intense and the air is heavy with unspoken words. There’s still so much to say, but now isn’t the time. It’s too raw. John breaks the eye contact and nods towards the sofa. “Shall we see what’s on?”
John frowns, heart thudding for a different reason as he feels Sherlock’s trembling intensify as the man fights to get impossibly closer. John darts a quick hand under Sherlock’s shirt again, turning the backs of his fingers against the now-freezing skin and he stops moving abruptly.
John, from experience as a student
“I’m sure you’ll survive,” Sherlock murmurs lowly, sliding a hand up John’s arm to rest on his shoulder.
This is probably the closest thing to a compliment Mycroft has ever paid John and considering he’s known this Mycroft a good ten minutes at most, he suspects it was said more to cause alarm than approval.
It frustrates John how seamlessly he slots back into the space when it’s been almost over three years he last slept here.
“What?” John snaps, losing patience. “Your mobile! I need to use your mobile!” He wiggles his fingers expectantly.
“John,” John replies absently, thinking furiously. How the hell did he get here? Has never be known to sleep-walk.
in despair. Sherlock simply raises his eyebrows at this, quite obviously feigning interest and making John snigger silently.
John splutters, spins suddenly to look himself over in the reflection of a shop window to his right. He stumbles to a stop. And stares. Moves closer.
Sherlock couldn’t bare to be apart from his friend, it was the oddest sensation. Not dissimilar to when Mummy or Daddy would drop him off at school, the longing to stay with them and not have to interact with the other noisey girls and boys. It was a deep ache, a nauseous feeling in his chest, and it made him irrationally angry. He would lash out and shout at the other children in his class, couldn’t understand why they kept asking him stupid questions or why they didn’t understand the tasks they were set.
John nods slightly in understanding. There’s an awkward silence where he doesn’t know what else to say. If he’s being perfectly honest with himself, he kind of wants Rachel to leave. The day’s adventure had been uncomfortable and unsettling for John, with awful reminders of who Sherlock used to be. He’s not angry anymore, but he still would rather like the day to be over. He feels a confusing mixture of satisfaction and guilt over what they had discovered. He wants to just sit and watch some crap telly with Sherlock and not have to think too hard about anything before heading to bed for an early night. He’s not going to do anything tomorrow, he decides. Nothing at all.
John belatedly realises there is no point trying to deny the fact he was reading his list again. He is curious to know how familiar Sherlock is with it, however.
They stand together on the porch for a few long moments and Sherlock’s face doesn’t soften as John expected, in fact his face hasn’t changed at all since he came outside. Since the confrontation in his room. His hooded eyes flick over John’s face, expression closed, before darting past John’s shoulder for a quick second towards the house. Sherlock abruptly pulls out of John’s grasp and takes two steps to the side, turning around to face the garden once more. John lets him go, hands dropping to his sides.
To Sherlock’s dismay, tears rapidly filled his eyes and he looked down quickly to hide his face.
“Probably not,” is all Sherlock says.
Victor’s eyes widen in alarm, he grimaces and blurts in a rush, “Sherlock took something from Alex D and he wants it back!”
Mycroft’s eyebrows quirk in confusion. “Alfred is Sherlock’s godfather,” he states unhelpfully.
“I’m fine!” Sherlock shouts back, winces a second later. “I fell asleep,” he grumbles.
John starts at the word, spinning around to see Mycroft standing motionless by the closed door, hand on the knob with his back turned and tense.
There; a small flicker in his eyes. John would have missed it if he wasn’t looking for it.
Either way, John is going to keep his promise. But not for Mycroft’s sake.
“Okay,” John murmurs into the sky.
with his old friend is doing something awful to John’s insides.
They had very recently come back from a crime scene, in which Sherlock had proceeded to execute his routine of yelling aggressively at a victim in order to make them speak quickly. John is rather used to this, but it still makes him shake his head in disapproval or snap Sherlock’s name in warning. This time, however, it was a very old lady whose deaf husband had been found dead with multiple stab wounds in their bathroom.
. For once, it really, one hundred percent, wasn't Sherlock’s fault John got dumped by
"No-"
he is.
Rosie is prodding at his foot. How did she get out of her cot? God, his head hurts.
“I am.”
Teddy raises his eyebrows in surprise. “Really?” John nods. “Then why aren’t you dancing around in joy?”
Sherlock shrugged, eyes still closed. “I told Lestrade what I knew once he had stopped his caterwauling. He can sort it out.”
John stares at his mad, insane, genius, occasionally caring friend for a moment before giving a grin and throwing the glass at the wall opposite.
Not for the first time, John can’t help but wonder at the massive effort this family goes through to be as melodramatic as possible.
“I’m looking for-” Alex begins, starting to sound a little flustered as the sound of rapidly approaching feet drifts towards them.
“I’ll pop it in the machine for you,” she smiles, heading over to the door leading into a small utility room.
"Don't worry, they're finished for the day. Won't be back until morning." With that, Sherlock eases his wrist out of Johns grasp and opens the door, stepping inside.
“Wait, go for a piss.”
John nods and smiles back with a low, “Hopefully,” as he thinks rapidly for an excuse on why that won’t work. There’s not much point heading back to London, John has no idea when he’s going to appear back in his own time and considering he’s lived through university once already, he would much rather stay here with Sherlock.
an option, and if someone hurt him he should walk away and tell a teacher.
“It works for someone else I know,” John gives the similar reply he gave to Victor, who voiced the same question those few days ago.
John stops and looks into his eyes. Glances at the girl. One pair unusually pale in contrast to dark skin, the other a warm brown. Both look concerned. Both look sincere. John slumps. He doesn’t trust them, not really, but at this point what can he do? He needs their help.
“What’s your name?”
Sherlock flaps a hand in his direction vigorously to silence him, eyes peeking out of the space.
, smiles.
“Oh?” John can’t help but stare up at the man, his face shadowed in the dim light of the living room.
Rachel gives him a look, face still blotchy and swollen from crying. “Not really.”
“What the-?”
“Woah, hey. Stay down for a moment.” John catches his shoulders and lowers him gently back to the ground. Sherlock tries to pat his hands away, but gives up after a moment, staring up at the ceiling with slowly blinking eyes.
“I’m going to bed now,” Sherlock announces abruptly, face passive. He nods towards the door.
Sherlock glances up at that, gives Victor a smile. “Victor.”
"Well that's wonderful. Now everyone is suitably de-stressed, let's clear up the blood and guts yeah?" John spins away and shoves off his coat, chucking it at the hooks behind the door blindly.
Seeing Sherlock in a uniform, serving customers and stocking shelves wasn't something John could possibly ever get used to. Or Lestrade, who would come in everyday under the pretext of buying a Meal Deal and wait at the end of an aisle until Sherlock was on till so he would have to serve the inspector.
John slides his fingers between Sherlock’s, watching with a grin as Teddy stares up at Molly with wide eyes. A small smile gradually lights up his face and Molly blushes, bites her lip. Smiles back.
John stared. "You have really strange priorities."
John crouches next to her, reaching out and feeling for the young man’s pulse. Its strong but rapid. He taps on a pale cheek gently with the back of his hand. “Jed? Can you hear me?”
The memory of last night makes his eyes snap open again, he pulls back. Takes into account where he is.
“Not too late,” the girl replies smoothly to her mother's back. A second later she drops her hand and moves around the table over to Victor, brushing her hands at him in a ‘shooing’ motion until he rolls his eyes and slides into the chair next to him, shoulders a bit hunched. She takes Victor’s vacated seat and turns to John deliberately with those unnerving pale eyes, almost identical to Sherlock’s.
“No, no, wait-” Jules grips tighter. “He’s a bad egg, as eggs go,” he huffs a stale laugh over John’s face before growing abruptly serious once more. “‘E’s not right in the head, he’s all fucked up.” Jules twirls his hands around his temples as he says this and John pushes away from the wall in a sharp movement.
Excuse errors, I really am not a very good proofreader.
John groans, rubs at his eyes as images of cold ice-coloured irises enveloped in darkness fills his vision. “Something like that.”
Sherlock lets out an odd laugh suddenly, glancing back at John with a casual air. He rolls his eyes, smiling ruefully. “John, you’re overthinking this.”
John hesitates for only a second, thinking of last night when his prying ended with Sherlock expelling him from his room. “What happened to your eye? It’s anisocoria, right?”
Sherlock stared at John for a second. His eyes darted to the left before coming back to rest on John’s face with a furrowed brow. “Milk?”
John glances up in surprise. He doesn’t deserve the lie, and from the dark look in Sherlock’s eyes he knows the sentiment is shared.
John shuts the door, feeling inexplicably tired all of a sudden.
“Open your eyes.”
“No, no, Sherlock-” John tries to push his prying fingers away.
Sherlock catches his wrist, holds John’s hand in his hair and blinks up at him with a soft smile.
John slams the laptop closed without thinking, his eyes snapping up to see Sherlock leaning against the doorway of the kitchen, face closed. His impossibly pale eyes glance at the laptop before flickering up to John’s face. He raises an eyebrow and John wills himself not to flush.
“It’s really fine-”
been. He hears Rachel gasp behind him as she enters the room, dropping her hand from his jacket to cover her mouth. John turns to Sherlock expectantly.
No, not really. “Sher-” That’s all John can manage. Wants Sherlock to help him up. He really should be helping him up. He tries to open his eyes. A stab of blinding light, too bright, and John has a moment of absent panic that he’s actually gone and blinded himself. Did he really hit his head that hard? He tries again. Ah, no, not blind. Just outside.
John heaves a sigh, glances at the floor before meeting Sherlock’s eyes again. "I guess I wanted to apologise for earlier."
“And that thing you took from him, it was drugs wasn’t it.” It isn’t a question.
In the corner of his eye, John sees Sherlock's left hand twitch and he hold his breath. After a moment's hesitation, Sherlock shifts it over onto John’s leg, just above the knee where sensitive nerves sit under the skin and squeezes back. Hard.
“Oh, it’s nice to be home-OH!” He sprints around his room, switching on his fairy lights with a burst of manic energy.
Teddy shook off his concern, explaining how it was only superficial. John had gone and taken a proper look at it regardless.
John clenches his jaw, biting back a retort as Mycroft turns away towards the door once again. John takes a deep breath, striding over to the railing to grip onto the wood with both hands, knuckles white. It’s infuriating, he knows
” John sits up hurriedly, nearly headbutting Sherlock in the process.
“What?”
“Yes, he bloody well should,” Victor says disapprovingly, shooting Sherlock a glare.
“What happened?” Evie asks, looking like she physically restraining herself from rushing over and giving Sherlock a hug.
"Yes."
Sherlock huffs a small laugh makes for the door, opening it a crack. Rudy’s face appears in the small gap, pressing unnecessarily close into the wood on either side and causing the skin of his face to stretch wide.
John scoffs. “No, I think without a doubt there’s only one Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes, yes your purse! You’ll have a picture of him in there won’t you? That’s what you people
“-Again,” Evie interrupts with a roll of her dark eyes.
She had ended up coming back to Baker Street with the two of them, refusing to go back to the flat to see the artist, and had dropped promptly down onto their sofa and hadn’t moved since.
“No it’s fine!” Sherlock interrupts, his voice unnaturally chipper. “You’ve got the baby coming and-I wouldn’t expect you to-I can’t imagine how busy you are.”
“Your cigarette is the wrong way round,” John mutters, pushing himself upright on the wall.
“What's wrong?” John aims the question at the detective but Sherlock shows no sign of hearing.
“Shut up!” John snaps at her. “Toby, go and find someone who works here, get an ambulance.”
“Thank you for breakfast, Mrs Holmes,” John waves over to her. She smiles in reply and nods that its no trouble.
John notices now the water damage on the wooden floor and the furniture. Mostly everything in there is unsalvageable, no wonder it was left behind.
“Sherlock-” John starts, warily.
“Alright?” John had smiled cheerfully up at him, before smashing his fist into the man’s large face, knocking him flat. He was still smiling, that beautiful smile he does when he’s
John blinks, "Shit, sorry." Then starts chuckling. He watches as Sherlock’s lips twitch and soon both of them are roaring with laughter on the debris covered floor. Through his laughter, John watches Sherlock. His blue eyes are bright with tears and his rare but genuine smile is huge and only for him and John thinks;
Sherlock looks up at him sharply. Cloaks his expression to mildly curious. “Oh?”
“Mycroft is our eldest,” Mrs Holmes nods. “Unfortunately we don’t see much of him due to his work in London, but he visits when he can.”
Sherlock’s eyes dart to the right for a second before coming to rest instantly back onto John’s face. “The deaf boy. How fitting.”
John’s eyes flick up to him again, a bit affronted. “Okay..”
Sherlock stares at John in silence, face impassive.
“Can I be a pain and ask to use your washing machine?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a bit but then brightened considerably. "Oh! You were jesting! You did get the tampons after all!"
Sherlock looks surprised. "Stop what?"
Teddy laughs incredulously, "Really? Even living with Sherlock?"
Mycroft stops, casting John a questioning look over his shoulder. John reaches out and pulls the door closed once more, peeking into the window quickly to check no one has noticed. Mycroft takes a sharp step backwards, as if John’s close proximity is accompanied by a bad smell. John stops himself from rolling his eyes.
“You did? Why?” Sherlock asks, eyes still closed but a small pleased smile titling his lips.
John didn’t have the heart to tell them they were actually both wrong and that it’s impossible to digest chewing gum at all but it would come out eventually… And he certainly wasn’t going to tell them that the only reason he knew that was because he and Sherlock had had the same argument about three years ago that had ended with a quick google search and the both of them simultaneously muttering, ‘
“Huh?”
Sherlock's hands slide down to John's stomach as John's creep down the wall, reaching under Sherlock and grabbing is arse, roughly tugging him forward. The friction is intense, and they pant into each other's mouths. Sherlock's hands slide back up to John's chest and pause there before adding pressure. John growls low in his throat, pushing himself further into the body pinned against the wall, utterly undone. The pressure coming from Sherlock's hands increases and it takes John one second longer to realise the man is trying to push him away.
It’s dark and cold, occupied by a lot more people than any other room they had walked past. Most are scattered around on blankets on the floor, a few piled onto a collapsed and stained sofa in the corner. No one pays them any mind, too out of reality to comprehend what is happening around them. John sees Sherlock’s face in them all and wants to hit something. He’s never seen his friend in this state, thankfully, but that doesn’t mean he never
“Shh!”
Not really.
to kiss that Sherlock? Sure, the man is attractive, John has always thought so. But that doesn’t mean anything. Mary used to go on about how
John can’t stop looking at Sherlock, he never stops looking at him. Anywhere, everywhere, at any moment he feels the urge to point it out, he won’t stop himself from indulging.
“Amnesia!? How fascinating,” the man cries, still holding onto John tightly. “I’ll have to pick your brains when we get a free moment,” he says, prodding a sparkling finger at John’s undamaged temple.
John huffed out a small laugh and shook his head. "Nothing, nothing."
