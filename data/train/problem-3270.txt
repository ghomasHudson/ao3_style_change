As his tattered shirt fell to the floor, Castiel was lifted up into the air, wrapping his legs around Dean's waist instantly as his hands ran through his hair and his lips sucked at his neck. The feel of Dean's big strong hands gripping his ass tightly, made his cock twitch valiantly, he'd come less than half an hour ago but this was Dean, the guy he'd been crushing on for weeks.
You take me away from my love… and replace him with your sweaty hands… If I had teeth I would bite you. Take me to my love, you fiend!!!
As he’d ran through the trees, thorns had scratched and cut up his ankles and legs, the scratches burnt and bled and the blood mixed with the rain on his legs, making them look like bloody waterfalls.
"Yes," Said Balthazar he said rolling his eyes at his phone "I'm sorry, just give me a second" He looked at the message and frowned "He wants to go out on Friday night with his friends..."
“He never tried to bite me again,” said Balthazar calmly. Dean’s eyes travel from Balthazar’s hand back to the image of Castiel curled up on the floor, he is naked, his face and body is littered in bruising and he is clutching his mouth, from which a stream of blood is running and in that pool of red, lies a bloody molar.
“Right. That and chefs are aggressive little fuckers… Although you shouting that his food tasted like a case of the squints after curry night probably didn’t help...”
"Cas..." Began Garth and Jo squeezed his hand under the table like he had done to comfort her earlier... "There is something I need to tell you... I should have told you sooner... But... well..."
At that moment Castiel wandered into the kitchen “You’re talking about Balthazar?” He asked looking from Sam to Dean.
Dean grinned as he walked past his brother, lying his bag and laptop on the table in the hallway “Course, why’d you think I brought two?”
The song finished and Castiel opened his eyes, rewinding the tape and pressing play again, he allowed himself to get lost again in memories of his husband. He remembered the night they had spent together before Dean had had to leave, he remembered Dean kissing his throat and telling him how much he loved him, how he was so grateful that he had him and how he’d come running back to him as soon as he could.
He had a feeling Lisa had gone out to give him some space to gather his belongings and to avoid an awkward ‘goodbye’ scene. He was grateful, it wasn’t like they wouldn’t be seeing each other again and they had said everything they’d needed to say last night. He felt his phone buzz in his pocket and pulled it out, taking a deep breath before answering.
to you? Well, I didn't see your name on it... So, if you're not going to fuck me. I'll go and find someone who will." says Castiel confidently.
Dean climbed carefully on to his boat, wincing at the pain in his ribs. He realized he hadn't even taken any of the painkillers yet and went to get a glass of water and take one straight away. Then he pulled out his phone to turn it too loud…
This note is just in case you notice something doesn't quite seem to fit, you know that I have (hopefully) gone back and edited that small bit for future readers.
“You are home.” says Castiel firmly, “I don’t want to hear you say that again, do you understand? I won’t be happy if I hear that again, Dean. This is your home now, soon you’ll come to love it… You’ll come to love me.”
"Some guy Cas has been messaging online," Said Charlie “So wait - he wants to meet, what did he say?”
“Oh, er…” Dean’s expression was full of shock and Castiel could feel it coming before Dean even said it… “I’ll talk to Sam about it.”
He could see Dean watching from across the room, see his cheeks flushing... It was right there, just below the surface, slowly bubbling up in him, with each and every grind of Castiel's ass over Luke's crotch; the jealousy, that oh so delicious possessive flare behind those forest green eyes. He was getting to Dean, any moment now, he could feel it...
An open hand smacks against his head, dizzying him, fingers lock into his hair and pull his head forward, making it even more difficult still to breathe. That is when he feels something hot and fleshy pass through that cool ring of metal and touch his tongue...
Dean made his way back through the club to the table where Meg and Charlie were stood, talking to the vampire doctor Benny.
“Well, that’s good, because I have your gift here. It’s a little smaller…” Dean reached into his pocket and pulled out a sprig of mistletoe. He turned back to Castiel, “Do you know what this is?” Castiel nodded and Dean stepped closer, he raised the mistletoe in his hand over their heads, “Good, cause I’m going to kiss you now.”
He’ll definitely have cooled off by now. Maybe I’ll suggest we go to couples therapy. Balthazar had seen that Heavens Library had closed its doors, Castiel was now out of a job, probably feeling pretty low… The perfect time to try and win him back.
“Always, Cas. Always. You and me.” Dean winces slightly as he tilts his head up to catch Castiel’s lips against his own, “You and me.”
"Winchester Books... Yes... As in they’re going to take over everything..." Said Balthazar shaking his head “The nerve of him to come and speak to you when he must know full well that he is going to damage your business”
Castiel opens his mouth, ready to argue but Dean gives him a look that dissolves his objections in his throat and instead he settles on “Thank you, Dean… for everything”
Shaking the tempting thoughts of his friend from his mind he lay down, his back to Castiel's front. That was safe, right? ‘Normal’? He pulled the sheets over them both, falling asleep not long later, as the warmth from the comforter washed over him.
He makes some cheese on toast and settles himself back in front of his computer, taking sporadic bites of his food while he writes down more notes and ideas for another hour, then finally he gets up and gets dressed, finding his phone in the pocket of yesterdays pants, he checks the time and realizes he has a text from Charlie.
"Well, Gabe..." Said Garth "Balthazar warned me not to tell my friend, Cas... I'd seen him and when he realized I had he lashed out. Charlie slapped him... like a badass by the way (Charlie made a noise of approval) Then he punched her in the face, heard the crunch... Bastard. And then..."
"Some guy called me a prick last night apparently," Said Dean thinking back to what a pompous ass Balthazar had seemed. With a pang of guilt, he remembered the look on Castiel’s face when he’d confirmed who he was.
Jo and Garth stood up, both looking slightly guilty and sheepish, they followed them to the door. As they all reached the street outside they heard Balthazar call...
“Dean, if you aren’t 1000% serious about this… about us, I will never forgive you for kissing me.” Castiel was surprised at himself for saying it, but he meant every word. He could have gotten over Dean, maybe, if he’d never experienced the hunters' lips against his own. If he’d never known the feeling of Dean’s body pressed closely to his own. He could have tried… He could have tried to move on, somehow, maybe with Dale, maybe with someone else, maybe alone. If Dean rejected him now, he didn’t think he would ever recover.
'I like the color blue. Like the ocean on a really sunny day,' He paused, for a moment thinking 'Have you ever been sailing on a really calm day, when it's so calm that its more like drifting than sailing and everything seems to slow right down and it's just you and the water... And it's so blue that you get lost looking at it... That's the kind of blue I like. My car is going to the doctors tomorrow, a little garage a friend of mine recommended, I imagine this is what it must feel like when your kids start school and your leaving them with strangers for the first time... I don't actually have kids myself so I can't really compare but I'm dreading leaving my baby with strangers tomorrow. She was my dad's car, and he passed her on to me... To make matters worse I have to attend a dinner tonight with my girlfriend that I really don't want to go to, but she always comes to events to do with my business so I guess I'll grin and bear it for her... as long as she doesn't force-feed me salad again. Win67'
He slips in some mud but regains his balance quickly by gripping on to a tree and pulling himself up, his lungs are burning, his feet are screaming in protest. He stopped and doubled over, gasping in deep gulps of air, he wraps the towel around his waist, knotting the two ends together tightly to hold it in place.
Jack’s eyes flicker slightly as his body starts to convulse on the bed before him, thrashing around horribly…
Yes, his chest… under his skin… his bare… naked skin… Oops… Sorry about the awkwardly timed boner there dude…
Castiel sighed and crossed the room towards Dean “Thank you, for the offer… But it is unnecessary I assure you. You’re staying here because your my friend and I offered to help and as I have already explained you are helping me in return anyway. Please, stop worrying about it and try to relax… Have a shower or a bath or whatever you like and if you still feel the absolute need to ‘repay’ me in some way in the morning…” Castiel smiled “I like bacon bagels”
Dean who had walked around the block thinking had decided to 'grow a pair' and go into 'The Triangle'. If he explained things to Castiel maybe it would alright... and if not at least he could close the book on 'Shopboy' for good. Besides, he really liked ‘Shopboy’ and didn’t want him thinking that Dean had just stood him up.
After everyone had had breakfast, plates of pancakes stacked high and topped with blueberries and raspberries, Castiel had thanked Sam and Jess for their hospitality and gone to wait for Dean in the Impala. Sam had told Dean not to do anything stupid if he came across Balthazar and after Dean had promised he wouldn't, he and Castiel had left to drive to the police station.
"I'll get you a bottle," Said Benny moving away towards the bar. Castiel caught Dean's eye and mouthed 'Sorry' to him, Dean gave him a small half smile in response. Castiel then followed Benny to the bar and Dean’s smile slid off his face.
“You think because you’re not saying anything that I can’t see that you’re upset?” Castiel tilts his head to look into Dean’s eyes, “I can see that you are hurting my love, I just don’t understand why?”
Dean tries to shout out but the words are so slurred that even he can’t remember what they were meant to be. As he jerks his head, trying to dislodge the ring of metal in his mouth, he feels the weight of the other person on the bed shift. Legs climb over him and someone sits on his chest heavily as the string around the thing in his mouth tightens around the back of his head, holding it in place. His stomach knots as he feels four sharp prongs dig into his cheeks, like the metal legs of some disfigured spider.
“I’m sorry, I will make things right… I will try to be better.” Balthazar looked at Castiel “How can you forgive Dean Winchester for putting you out of business but not forgive me?”
His eyes fall on the foreign leather jacket that has no place being hung up on his coat stand, no place in his house, he scowls at it. ‘Deans’. The strong leather smell suddenly seems to wash away the perfect coconut scent. Balthazar shakes his head and moves away from it, he stalks silently around his house, seeing more little pieces of evidence of ‘Dean’ as he does.
The next few weeks are slow and tedious. Sam doesn’t leave Castiel alone with Dean, so he never gets a chance to talk to him on his own. After learning what had happened to him, Dean decided that recovering his lost memories, was not a priority and he refuses to speak to a therapist about anything more than learning to accept that he has lost time. The therapist warns Dean that over time, his subconscious may begin to unlock what happened to him in the form of dreams… or rather nightmares.
Sam rolled his eyes, smiling “Of course, the pie… Did you remember that it’s for sharing?” Said Sam laughing.
Castiel had been about to say that he would be fine, but as he looked at Dean an idea struck him "Do you think..." He cut off shaking his head.
“I’m sorry,” Said Balthazar slowly “I hurt you… and I hurt your friends. That is not something I ever wanted to do. I know I have made mistakes, but please… We can fix this. I just want to come home, I just want you back”
Castiel got up from his comfy bed before it had the chance to take him hostage again in its warmth. He straightened the duvet out and put his laptop back on his desk and reconnected the charger before beginning to look around for some clothes to get changed in to. After finding the lesser crinkly of two shirts he pulled it on, it was an almost tartan pattern of greens and blues and white. He found a skinny black tie and some black jeans, which he changed into after finding a fresh pair of boxers. As he walked out of the bedroom and into the kitchen he grumbled when he noticed that Balthazar had finished the rest of the pot of coffee. In the past when Balthazar had finished all the coffee, he'd left little notes and some change...
Castiel sighs “I know there are a lot of sayings that ‘change is a good thing’ but… Basically, I think it’s just a nice way of saying that something you didn’t want to happen at all, has happened. I miss the store, I miss seeing you and Charlie every day, it’s not even been that long but I do… Did you know they are turning the store into a GameStop”
Dean’s crying again, silent sobs that Castiel is only aware of because of how the man’s body shakes when he sobs, but Castiel does not offer him any comfort. He doesn’t speak to him at all. He tucks himself back into his pants and stands up, leaving the bedroom without a backward glance at Dean, whose left handcuffed to the bed, naked, with Castiel’s come painting his rear.
"Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you more than you can handle..." Castiel's blue eyes shined as he looked at the young man before him "What's your name?"
So, Sam had lost Eileen, he had lost Cas and they had both lost Jack. It was just the two of them, driving back from Eileen's. They stop for the evening in a field, deciding to take their first ever night staring up into the sky, their first night under the stars, looking up - with no one looking down on them. Chuck is gone, they are finally free… so, why did it still feel like losing?
This was originally going to be a piece in The Ultimate Guide To Destiel Sex, but I thought because of it's darker themes that it would be better to put it as a stand-alone piece. That way it could be tagged properly and I'd avoid triggering anyone.
he walks over to the trolley, his hands hover over the items there, lingering for a moment over the hammer before finally, landing on the knife. He picks it up, turning back to the door, he starts towards it, whispering to himself…
'Haha that made me laugh, If I wasn't into that I doubt I would be messaging with a guy. Only moved a few things out, still got to go back and get the rest of my stuff. That will be the awkward part, giving her back the key. But that's tomorrow's problem, right now I just want to chill and read the new book I got today. Win67'
The door closes slowly, Castiel watching as Dean walks in. He quietly turns the key to lock the door and removes it. Dropping it into the soil of a large potted plant and covering it as Dean looks around the living room, unaware.
She hesitated for only a moment before sagging and saying "It's my book dinner tonight. I just feel a... bit nervous about it"
Just as his eyes spotted a road through the trees, he heard an awful sing-song voice close behind him,
"Maybe we should make a deal with her? For every so many books sold here they get a free coffee at Meg’s or a loyalty card with her where if they buy five coffees, we do a book token for a couple of quid or something." Charlie was clearly deep in thought and walked away without waiting for a reply.
"Dude! Yes. We just talking food, or full-blown face masks and pillow fights in our undies?" she laughed.
Balthazar had tried, he’d pleaded with Michael… Begging him to leave his wife, telling him that he had broken things off with Castiel for him. Telling him that Castiel had meant nothing to him and that he was the one he wanted but Michael had told Balthazar his wife was pregnant and that it had been the wake-up call he had needed.
"I know 'Shopboy' and Cas like Win67, But do they like me? I don't know" Dean scrubbed his hands over his face “And the longer I don’t say anything, the guiltier I feel about it… He tells ‘Win67’ things he might not want me to know”
It had been over three weeks since Castiel had dragged Balthazar out of his house, he'd mailed all his remaining belongings to his office taking great pleasure in addressing them to 'That cheating asshole Balthazar'. He'd cleared out any trace of him, the photographs had all been shredded and used as packing for Balthazar's laptop it that had been very satisfying, to know that he would see it when he opened the box. Castiel had completely cleansed himself of Balthazar, he felt so much better, his friends had been there for him, checking he was OK and being supportive.
“Put your arms behind your back,” he commanded. Dean obeyed, deciding that not pissing Castiel off further was his best chance of getting out of this alive.
His words stabbed through the tension in the air like a sword as he gripped the angel's face and closed the space between them once more, “Well, I'm starting it. Right fucking now.”
“Oh,” Said Castiel accepting his answer “Well, come in. I’m starving actually so your timing is perfect.”
He set about getting the easiest items first, five golden rings, no problem. He walked right into a jewlery store and purchased five simple gold bands. Next he went to a garden centre and bought a small pear tree, he took these items back to the bunker and hid them in the huge underground garage. He moved some of the cars from one side of the room to the other so that he could set up pens for the animals, one for the goats, one for the chickens and geese, one for the swans, one for the partridge, turtle doves and calling birds.
Screaming Gabriel launches himself at a clueless John. He gets in a couple of decent swings before Victor hauls him off John, Victor cuffed the older man. Placing him under arrest and driving him to the station.
When you’ve reached the absolute limit of fear, when you’ve had all that your mind can handle without going insane, there is only one way to go…
He pushed the rejection from his mind, thinking how maybe it was unfair of him to expect Balthazar to get up early with him on his day off to have a quick tumble between the sheets, last night had proved, hadn't it? That Balthazar did still care... That would do - for now.
Hot guy wore a t-shirt again today… No... I am not sulking, just observing. Hope the weather is nice tomorrow. Maybe I should take up running? Nah, fuck that. Ohhhh I could do weights on the front though? Christ Dean, why don’t you set up a fucking lemonade stall you big girl.
"Let me go and check in with Sam, five minutes and I'll come with you, OK? Just... don't do anything yet. OK?" He almost begged
Internally he rolls his eyes, but outwardly Castiel smiles back at him, “I want to thank you again for allowing me permission to visit Dean.”
Balthazar looked at her lazily "Come on Charlie, we both know you wouldn't drink anything I made for you anyway, right? You're more than welcome to go and help yourself" He said while pulling yesterdays paper off the table and opening it across his knees.
He walked out of his front door closing it behind him, wondering again where the roses had come from, there were a few options, maybe Dean although, highly unlikely. Then there was Win67, which was slightly concerning, how would he know where Castiel lived for starters? Then there was Balthazar, which was even more concerning… Castiel shook his head at how messed up things were that it was preferable to have been sent roses by a stranger he talked to online than his ex… Then, there was Charlie.
"Yeah, I shouldn't have hit him, I shouldn't have done that... but I couldn't stand seeing him all over you like that." Dean took another step toward Castiel, "I wanted it to be me."
He walked down the stairs slowly, his ribs were much better now, but still twinged a little from time to time. Jess wolf-whistled at him. Sam raised an eyebrow at her.
"Balthazar... What are you doing here?" Asked Castiel deeply, standing still near the front door as he locked eyes with him, visualizing him bursting into flame under his glare.
“So you like Dean and ‘Win67’,” Said Charlie struggling against a deep desire to spill the beans that Dean and ‘Win67’ were, in fact, one and the same. A part of her felt deep guilt, almost shame at keeping this information from her friend. However, she truly wanted for her friend and her new boss to be together, she believed that Dean could make Castiel happy and after Balthazar, after losing his store, he certainly deserved a little happiness. She hoped that keeping the secret, just a little longer, could ease the frictions between Castiel and Dean and open Cas up to the possibility of considering a relationship with Dean.
“That’s blood,” snaps Gabriel, pointing at John’s shirt and looking back to the officer, “that, right there! Blood. And look at his knuckles,” turning back to John, Gabriel shoves at his chest wildly, “What the fuck did you do?”
Alright… I’ll let you… But dude… Get your fucking head in the game… Do you know how long it has been since we saw another cock? A penis has needs damn-it!!
"What? No, of course not" Said Castiel looking at him "It's not like that... He had a girlfriend, we're just friends. He split up with her a few days ago and I'm guessing that's why he wants to meet"
Dean picked up his beer and took a long swig from it, glancing over his shoulder back at the angel and the vampire. Who now seemed to be sharing a fishbowl cocktail.
This is stupid, none of my clothes look right… too casual, too formal, too small, too big… fuck sake all my socks have holes in… Why am I even compelled to meet him?!
He uncuffs Dean’s other arm and takes a few more pictures, him kissing Dean’s cheek lightly, him wrapped around Dean, him smiling up at the camera with Dean’s face just behind him.
Garth looked at her sadly, "The way I see it the internet is just another way for me to get rejected... so no."
It was after lunch and Dean was checking his laptop again, was it the third or fourth time now? Eh, who was counting. Still no new messages, no word from ‘shopboy’, he huffed.
They ate the takeaway Castiel had bought with two large vodkas and cokes and watched an episode of Will and Grace.
"Good, that's good, because I want you to be mine. I don't want anyone else touching you, you're too beautiful to be pawed at by different men all the time... I don't want to share" Castiel jacked Dean a little harder, pressing his front against his ass again so Dean could feel how much the man wanted him.
“And I'm sure Dean will be very glad to see you when he wakes up,” says Sam attempting to lighten the mood and shake Balthazar from his thoughts.
Charlie and Garth were still there for him, as was Meg. And Jo had become a good friend too. It wasn’t like he stayed in all day, every day… But he did miss having someone. Lying in bed with someone…
“So needy. Do you want to come, Dean? Can you say my name for me as you do?”  asks Castiel conversationally.
Castiel came back into the store with a coffee and a breakfast muffin for Garth "Here, you can go home.. after you've eaten this"
"Why did he hit Charlie?" Asked Dean looking from Jo to the redhead, he’d overheard Castiel speaking to her by name.
Charlie swung her legs off Castiel and pulled her long winter coat - that had been used as a blanket off her and rolled it up.
Castiel blinked awake suddenly, as something heavy and warm shifted against his front, nudging his...
"Well he asked if it would OK with me if he did and I told him of course, I'm happy that you two will be alright," Said Castiel, he'd never admitted to them that he had asked Dean on their behalf.
"I agree, good luck with your new book," Said Castiel to Lisa, before turning one glare on... “Mr. Winchester” He nodded curtly at Dean before turning and walking away, with Balthazar at his side.
Suddenly, Sam is there and he is shouting, grabbing Castiel’s hand and pulling him up. He tugs him along with him down the cave towards the light in the distance. A growling creature rushes at Sam from the shadows, shoving him forcefully away from Castiel.
Castiel leans over the bed and takes the oxygen mask from Balthazar’s face, resting it against his neck. He glances back to the door quickly and then his voice drops to a chilling whisper and Balthazar’s eyes widen with each word.
The only thing that had stopped him from acting on it yet, was that Castiel had only just broken up with Balthazar, three weeks is nothing after a break up with a long term partner and Dean didn’t want to be a rebound. He also wanted to tell Castiel the truth about who he was before anything happened, he didn’t want anything to start with Castiel not knowing that Dean was ‘Win67’. Plus there was the fact that Castiel was in the middle of losing his book shop - thanks to Dean.
Dean shakes his head, breathing rapidly and trying to keep calm, he doubles over and makes an angry grunt at the floor that sounded something like ‘fucking-what-the-fucking-hell-Fuck!’ whilst punching out at the air wildly. Before straightening up and turning back to face his brother… Much calmer this time he says “I just got a call from the docks… My boat burnt out last night…”
The door creaks as it opens and Balthazar’s face comes into view, he looks taken back at the sight of the two men but before he can even ask who they are John has pushed his way into the room. Sam follows looking less confident and quickly shuts the door behind him.
Dean’s face split into a wide smile and he suddenly threw his whole body back and laughed. He reached out an arm, grabbing wildly for Castiel so he didn’t lose his balance, he laughed and laughed, until his sides hurt.
Charlies advice was kind of confusing… The ‘do nothing, just be his friend for now’ felt like two opposing ideas. Dean didn’t really know for certain what constituted as ‘doing something’... Was him asking Lisa to meet up with Cas ‘a move’ as Charlie had put it or was it just him being friendly… Either way, he’d asked his ex to meet up with Castiel to give him some help as he started his venture into writing children’s books. If it worked out and Castiel managed to get published, Dean already had it in his mind that he would be placing a big order on Castiel’s writings and stocking them at the Winchester Superstore to help get his name out there, if Castiel agreed of course.
“No. I want you, right here. Right now. I’ve waited long enough and I can’t wait another second…” Castiel pulls at Dean’s shirt, rolling it down from his shoulders and tugging it from his arms while Dean smiles cheekily above him.
The drinks were flowing, the group had all been dancing and having a great night. Charlie, Meg, Garth, Jo, Castiel, and Dean were now all stood around the small circular table. Looking at each other, eyeing each other with serious expressions, like something from a cowboy movie.
"Wait." he heard himself say softly, stepping forward and placing a gentle hand on Dean's arm, "Forgive me... What I should have said, was that you would live to regret it if you came home with me tonight." he shot Dean a flirty smile.
Once outside, in the rain and darkness of one of the grimy back alleys by the club, Dean pushed Castiel's back up against wall. Castiel's heart was racing and he was loving every second of it, but acted shocked.
Meg and Castiel nodded and the four of them headed out of the door, to find the nearest chip shop. Castiel’s mind still trying to process that Dean may be interested in him.
“YOU!” came the roar of a dangerously angry John Winchester as his eyes glared venom at Castiel through the fence, “I warned you to keep away from my son!”
PLOT heavy chapter - A little look into why Castiel is, the way he is. Please leave me a comment and let me know what you think <3
"Well, I had an old Match.com profile and I logged in to close the account as, you know, I'm with Balthazar," Charlie rolled her eyes but Castiel ignored her and continued, "Anyway, he had sent me a message and I don't really know why but I decided to reply and we just got talking about books and music and New York. I don't have a profile picture and neither does he, we don't talk about anything personal. So, no names, or what we do for work or anything like that..."
He taps a finger on the steering wheel, gathering his thoughts, "Thing is? Yeah, I've been kinda wanting to fix things- but it wasn't just for me. Dean's the one with the bigger complex about the guy. I mean, dad, he- I'm always gonna admire him some way or another, but the more I find out about him and about back then- I don't know, maybe we do need a little space."
John slaps him on the arm as he passes, chuckling, "Alright, we should get moving anyway. I found a case."
. Nothing special, just backup. Another body. The obvious exceptions being the Winchesters, and a few choice friends from their collective group. Claire, for instance, he still cares whether she completely dislikes him. Jody, of course. Alex, Donna, Charlie... those he loves. Everyone else is simply background.
Cas is just... different. But that's what makes him so great. He cares about so many things that Dean would never even think about, or would never cross his mind- and then there Cas is looking at a flower like it's the eighth wonder of the world, grinning up at Dean. He just...
Crowley takes that moment to peer over at John, who's still frowning his way. He leers, sliding his eyes up and down John's body hungrily, "You
Sam, Dean and Cas are stuffed in a booth in the aftermath of the lunch rush, waiting on three burgers when Cas blinks back in to their presence.
"I can group with the angel this time round." John cuts in with such unarguable certainty, Dean sputters for a moment, watching his father sidle up beside Cas- who side-eyes him suspiciously.
Perhaps it's a side effect of middle America. These vast expanses of grassy hills spanning for days on end- it leaves little to do but settle on thoughts and thoughts and thoughts.
Dean slams the door shut, eyeing the 'NO TRESSPASSING' sign like it's more a suggestion than a warning, "Looks like we're walking from here."
He carries both mugs back to the table and slides one over to Cas before taking the seat directly next to him. Technically this had already been Dean’s seat so really Cas is the one that sat next to him first. Technically.
"Yeah, just, uh," Dean clears his throat again, kicking the toe of his boot in the dirt, "Wrong pipe."
But it's not just these guys either. It's his dad always leering at Cas like he's about to sprout talons. And, hell, even Sam talks about the guy now and again like he's... something else.
He doesn't know when it happened, or what Dean said to make Cas think he's a temporary fixture around here- but it must've been Dean to say it if Cas thinks John's a more welcome housemate than he is. That John's more family than he is just cause he's blood. Hell, their blood family's on such short supply, they've gotta protect every other person they've got. With Cas it's as ride or die as it gets for Dean.
He turns on his heel, continuing the same way he'd been, this time with even longer strides. The demon hurries from his stool at the bar, shuffling behind to catch up as Cas shoves the side door open.
Dean'll admit that he doesn't think all too well of himself most of the time, but that doesn't mean he's just gonna let someone get all up in his face about it, either. You've got to have at least a sliver of self-respect enough to beat down the shit-heads gunning for you.
”No, I’m not. Says who?” He snorts, playing it off, and shoots Sam a look, which seems entirely lost on his brother.
If he wasn't a fan of this guy before, he definitely isn't now. In fact, he's earned a hot spot in the Dean Winchester bible of shit-stains.
He can feel his face getting hot, just at this incremental exchange, and looks down to hide his face from the table as he sits, “Shower’s free, bud.” He says.
"That place..." Dean's voice shakes at first, but he firms it up the moment Cas, too, looks his way. "There was only one way we were getting out of there and it wasn't breathing... so I made a call."
Cas takes Dean's hand from the seatback and threads their fingers together. With a squeeze, he brings his hand up to plant a soft peck on Dean's knuckles. Some of the tension starts to leave his shoulders again.
Cas simply looks at him, not understanding this less-than-grand motive in the slightest. "Why?" he asks.
So Cas thinks Dean wants to get his rocks off and that's it? He can't blame him. When has Dean ever been upfront about caring more than that? He can't expect Cas to read his mind and understand. Although part of him kind of hoped for it.
"No, Donna, you take it. We're fine, really." Eileen says, nodding and pushing Donna towards the room.
Dean continues untying Sam, and helps him to his feet, eyes never truly leaving Mick- but he does flick an almost imperceptible look over to Cas as if to ask
how happy I am for you. For the life you got to live, for your family.” He shook his head and placed the trivet back on the dining table. “I couldn’t have asked for more.”
“Okay. Good. Jack thinks it’s a win-win situation! When I appear to a group of faithful to announce a glad tiding, my true visage makes them insane. Jack wants to redesign all of the angel squads eventually, and make us much more compact!”  Cas began to glow a little brighter.
Dean stood as well, and followed John down the steps and over to the car. “Listen, you give my best to the Singers, and kiss Mom for me.” The two reached out for each other simultaneously, and hugged each other tight. “Thanks, Dad.” Dean said as they broke apart. “For the garden, but also for understanding.”
“I always hoped you’d find a good woman like your Mom, here.” John smiled and put his hand on top of Mary’s resting on the table. “Have a few rug rats for me to spoil.”
“Yeah. I asked him to tell Cas how I felt. Don’t know if he heard me though. I know Jack had Cas help him rebuild Heaven but I don’t know where he is now.” Dean shoved his hands in his pockets and slowly rocked on his feet. “Who the hell am I kiddin’ Sammy? Even if he is an angel in Heaven, he told us his real form was the size of the Chrysler building. Remember?”
“I’m not! I just wanted to help, maybe find some information about Celestial romance, that kind of thing!”
John was admittedly shocked, and he was sure he must have mistaken the meaning of Dean’s words. “I got no problem with it. Nothing wrong with two good friends sharin’ a space. That’s all this is about, right Dean?”
“Well some things never change!” Ellen laughed and wiped up the bar. “Room’s yours, Dean. Ash moved out a long time ago, he and Jo have their own place down by the river. Tomorrow you can dream up a house for yourself!”
Dean’s heart, if he still really had one, swelled. He knew that Eileen’s love had surely been reciprocated. His brother’s capacity for love was unending.
. I’m so proud of you, and Cas, and what you’ve done here.” Dean paused, checking himself. No. He was done. “That’s it, I guess. Good night.” A flash caught his eye, and a violet and green Aurora appeared above and danced across the sky. He lay back and watched it until  it  receded. Later, as he and Miracle snuggled into bed, he thought he heard Jack’s voice: “
“Yes. I’ll be going to bed here, awakening here, eating here. Whipping your ass at foosball here…” Cas smiled fondly at Dean and the smile he received in return made the micro matter construct of his human
They had been sitting on the porch, admiring their handy work and having a cool drink, when John’s phone rang. After a brief conversation John closed off and polished off the last mouthful of beer.
“I remember; you said he was from one of the warrior garrisons.” John murmured as he downed the last of his bourbon.
“I was headin’ back from Sam’s house and saw you out here, so I called your Mom and asked her what would look good by your porch.”  He set his flat down on the ground and gestured with his spade. “If you don’t like the colors, blame her!”
Ellen took it and refilled it from one of the bottles behind her. “Take it easy, boy, this may be Heaven but you can still drink enough to spew up here.”
When they reached Sam’s house Dean called Miracle over to the car and let him in. Sam urged him to stay for lunch, but Dean was in no mood to socialize. He begged off and headed home. He spent hours working off some tension by digging a new garden around the porch, all the while debating with himself whether or not he’d really heard Jack speaking to him.
Dean took a long sip of coffee and smiled as he watched Sam and the dog become reacquainted. He was glad to know Miracle had had a good life with Sam and his little family and yet it pained him that he’d missed so much.
After eons of hard work and a concerted effort by the Consolidated Garrisons of Angels, the new Hell was finally complete. Dean hosted one of his now-famous barbecues to celebrate the grand opening and to honor Castiel for his new role as Director of Demon Rehabilitation. Dean walked around, greeting the many guests, throwing a few Bocce balls, and eating two red hots and some of his Mom’s peach pie. He barely remembered his death, or what sadness or worry was like.
Dean waved and as he pulled out of the driveway and headed toward the meadow he felt that ache again and he knew exactly where the sadness came from. He’d been faced with a pure and perfect declaration of love in the Bunker's interrogation room, and he hadn’t reciprocated. He’d let his fears deny it. Fear of admitting to feelings  he’d been taught to disparage.  Fear of being one of those people he’d mocked with his father as a teen. Fear of having his friends and family turn their backs on him. Fear that people could see it like a brand on his forehead
He sat up and grabbed at the phone, rolling Miracle off of his legs and onto the bed. He peered closely at it. Seemed standard issue. No brand insignia, but the name Sam was blinking on the screen above the red and green arrows. He swiped the green one and held the phone to his ear.
Dean began to moan and he arched his back as a wave of ecstasy coursed through him. On his cushion, Miracle twitched his paws as he chased butterflies in his dreams, and a short way up the road Sam and Eileen played Monopoly with their son.
awesome. Oh, and technically I am not a man! As I explained in my previous visit, my current  form is very similar to yours. It is a construct of micro matter, not a human ‘meat suit’ as you call it. ”  He patted his ribs and grinned. “We’re using it as a prototype for the reconfiguration of the Angel Brigades!”
Sam snorted. “Yeah. Look Dean, I know Dad always made a big thing about gays and alternate lifestyles and all that but—that didn’t mean it was wrong. It meant
“You won’t, Dean. No hurry, no worry. Just take your time. And remember, Castiel is a whole lot less experienced than you are.”
Dean nodded and smiled sadly. “Yeah.” He shifted and poured himself more lemonade.  “ She was there. It wasn’t her nest, but she seemed to be in charge of the vamps. Sam took her out. He had my back. Well, until a rebar got it!” He snorted at his own joke until he saw the pained look on his parents’ faces. “Hey! Hey, listen, it was fast, didn’t hurt much at all. And Sam, he was great, he was… He was
“You told me Cas was taken by The Empty. Him and Billie. You said it was summoned because he’d made some kind of deal to get Jack back, like a trade or something. And Dean, I did a little research back then, and according to the lore the Empty can’t--”
“No, Dean. Jack understands the desire for two people who love each other to want to express that love through intimate physical contact.” Dean was slightly pissed to find himself blushing. “He certainly doesn’t want your soul exploding across the Universe. And yet, I must remain a Seraph. I
"What the hell, give me a shot of your favorite tequila-" Dean winks, egging her on to finish that sentence with a name.
Instead, she tosses up her right hand, high, flat. A yellow light leaks out from the center of her palm, accompanied by a high-pitched sizzling that only grows alongside a rapid, blinding brightness.
"Right." Sam calms, leading them down the stairwell, "The fix sounds fairly simple. You just find the witch who did it and kill it."
Ishim stares, and no one speaks for a good minute while the woman angel slowly steps across the diner and out the front door, clearly in no real rush. The bell chimes.
And that's how Sam ends up dropping the bags in his hands and getting smushed up against his brother, hunched low enough so that Donna can get her arm around his significantly higher shoulders.
The one smidgen of saving grace in this situation- at least it’s not Sam who must do it. That thought alone might give Cas his last bit of extra resolve.
Alright, fuck it. He's not an invalid, he'll grab some ice, make themselves some drinks, cool off. Not think about the way he left things with Cas. Not think about whatever the hell happened last night.
"Sam said we can make s'mores! I've never had them before!" Jack grins, scooping up a mouth-full of cookie crisp.
Usually when a soul is so scarred, the person doesn't last much longer in this plane of life. Likely due to similar reasons to John- the loss leading to a type of madness. An obsession. One which beckoned his children to follow in his wake and shoulder the burdens of the father at the cost of their lives several times over.
Dean jolts, slipping right back into hunter-mode at the sound of his father's even tone. He slides the phone in his front pocket and sits up.
"I was sick" Castiel cut across Charlie and lied quickly "I've had enough," He said pushing his half-drunk beer towards her "You want the rest of that?"
"I don't know, he was just passing, I guess... Here's our cab," Said Castiel as a black cab pulled up next to them. They both got into the back and the cab pulled away.
Dean looks back at the wall, he feels his insides twist horribly as his eyes land on a new image. Castiel is chained to the bed, the same bed that Dean’s been cuffed to for weeks but unlike Dean, Castiel isn’t on the bed, but suspended above it by the tight chains. His face is a picture of pure agony, he’s naked and his mouth is red with dried blood.
"Take them shopping?" suggested Sam, "Thought you would have loved the excuse to go and buy loads of junk food and spoil them. Take them sailing, if its calm. Take them fishing. Whatever you want to do."
Sighing heavily he turns away from the fire and picks up his empty mug from the table, padding through the wooden cabin, passing the bare Christmas tree on the way to the kitchen, his eyes glance at the tree briefly as he passes it, it’s nakedness another reminder of Dean’s absence. Since they had been together, they had always decorated their Christmas tree together.
Sam struggles into a second hospital chair, placing his crutches down on the ground beside him, “It’s alright, it’s good that Dean has another visitor, it’s good he hears your voice…”
“I made mistakes, I admit… But Castiel and I can work things out. That is if he isn’t already shacked up with Dean?”
Charlie knocks on the office door and it opens after a few moments with Sam Winchester stood behind it “Charlie, everything alright?”
The first tear escaped without permission and as Castiel reached a hand up to wipe it away, more followed, trickling down his face before he could stop them.
He closed his computer down and put his phone back in his pocket. After putting his shoes back on he left the store, checking the sign was clearly visible in the window as he locked up. He walked home, trying not to think of anything, he just wanted to get home and wash off everything that had happened last night, and brush his teeth he was sure he had beer breath. He thought of Dean, who'd suffered two broken ribs, defending him and his friends. He thought of their talk at the hospital and felt a sudden rush of affection for him, followed closely by guilt. How badly he had misjudged him?
"You belong to me, Castiel. Got it? Me!" said Dean before turning and starting to walk away. Leaving Castiel, breathless, exhilarated and utterly confused. Where was Dean going? Yes... he'd come but that hadn't been his goal. He knew what he wanted, and he wasn't letting Dean get away that easily.
"Are you going to let someone else pay for these, this time Dean?" Charlie asked him as they gave their order to the barman.
"I'm popping out for a bit," said Lisa, "Take your key, you can leave it tomorrow when you come round." She smiled at him before walking over to the front door and leaving. As soon as she had closed the door Dean stood up. He did a last sweep of the house for anything important he may have missed - remembering his toothbrush. And then looked around, he was moving out... He knew it had been coming, he knew they both needed it, but it felt weird. He’d spent his last night at this house and he'd spent it on the couch.
"No, I'm coming down now. We're heading straight out to the boat. See you in a sec." said Dean, grabbing his bags and heading for the door.
"O-okay..." Jack's brow is crinkled in confusion again, and silence weighs between the two of them as they start unloading the cart to check out.
John’s eyes widen, and shift to Dean as though seeing something different in him for the first time. Dean drops his gaze to his plate.
”Better be.” He mumbles, circling the pew to stand at Cas’ rear. Maybe it’s to keep a better eye on Lily, more likely it’s so he doesn’t have to look Cas in the eye for five minutes.
People are so fascinating. There's so many that are nearly the same and yet not. There must be a thousand, a million truck stop waitresses all over this side of the country. She has an entire story to her. Why her voice is so raspy, where her jewelry comes from, how she got this job... Does she like working the night shift, or is this simply the only job she could get? Maybe she has children, or a parent she takes care of.
But Dean has to. He just can't do it and get the job done right. So, he waits. Pushes it away, but only for a little while. Only 'til he can let it hit him full force.
Grumbling and looking down at the phone- as if on cue, John trails out from the hallway, brows raised, looking between Dean and the cell, "Any news on Sam?"
Dean nods, "Yeah, he's still alive too. He's-" he doesn't get out the rest of his sentence before bolo-tie scrambles out of his seat and darts into the living room, "Okay, good talk."
Beth directs Sam to a box behind him stocked so full of files it's cap is skewed on the top. Any number could be a culprit holding her personally responsible for their family's separation. It's sad, really, how someone just trying to do good in the world can so easily be deemed the bad guy depending on who's the one telling the story.
Dean evades his eyes, gripping the wheel, so Sam turns in his seat, "Remember a few years back, when we put the Impala in storage?"
He wants to reach over and slide a hand through the angel’s hair and fix that lock sticking in a weird angle just behind his ear. He wants to move closer and see what it feels like to press against Cas’ side when he’s freshly awake like this. He must be so warm.
It's about a six hour drive from here to the bunker, and in that time Cas doesn't see or hear a single soul. He stands on the edge of the property the whole time, patrolling in different areas and hoping for a better angle through any window. No cars pull through, no one screams from inside, nothing.
Cas looks up from the table, watching a grey SUV pass with a decal on its side reading: "Dr. Gregory Marion: Veterinarian" with an accompanying phone number. The vehicle pulls into a driveway beside a sign for the same clinic.
"It's not like I just turn into a boring small-town sheriff when you guys are gone." She shrugs, shoulders high, "I do stuff. Shouldn't be surprised that I'd enjoy the company of a ruggedly hot man."
Kaia is the only other person in the room, and she’s nursing a coffee in the corner of the table, leaning against the wall with her legs tucked up to her chest. She offers a small smile to Dean in greeting. He plops down at the table across from her.
It had taken a bit of convincing a year ago to get Dean to truly warm to the idea of using Bobby's old salvage yard for a place of his own, but eventually he came around. Cas may have had to bring Sam in as the final nail in the coffin to convince him that this was something they could make work. Sam always comes through.
rough hands and strong arms to shove him into the thing he wants. Cause then maybe it won't look so much like he wanted it so desperately in the first place.
Dean's breath shallows out, his clothes rustling. And he clears his throat- but in the sleepy way where he might be asleep when he does it. Cas isn't sure.
Mick enters the basement first- a cold, stone room held up by old wooden beams and lit by a couple of loose bulbs dangling from frayed ceiling wires. A sink to the right has piping that leads up the wall and to a fixture overhead Sam in the center of the room- where he’s tied to a chair, alive but clearly wet, beaten and covered in splotches of his own blood.
That's when his eyes catch on the whiteboard newly minted beside the map table, plastered with a mess of fine blurry snapshots of Kelly and a slue more of documents outlining her past. It's not a whole lot of info for some random chick that'd have no real reason to hide her past, but he guesses it's something. Who knows, maybe getting hired at the white house staff means wiping out your past with a fine-toothed comb.
Before Sam can even respond with much more than a stuttered half-syllable, Dean ends the call, already walking back to dog-guy with the phone outstretched in one hand.
Before he can even think about it, Dean stops. Abruptly. He shoves Cas away like he wasn't just the same person pulling him in. He shoves him away like a cheap date. Which he's not.
The way he smiles to himself when flipping through his records, looking for the next best one to introduce Cas to. The glisten in his eye that's so rare these days, when he's watching Cas and waiting to see if he likes the song as much as Dean does. The gentle rise and fall of his chest. Soft puttering of breath on lips when, finally, Dean falls into a comfortable sleep over the covers. He stopped wearing his shoes to bed a long time ago in the bunker, but sometimes he still wears his jeans. Sometimes Cas stays beside him a little longer than he knows Dean would accept out loud, just to make sure he doesn't fall into a nightmare and grasp at the sheets alone with Sam's name on his lips.
Dean sighs, unlocking the Impala's trunk. The kid sure isn't shy about getting to the root of an issue and talking it out like a grown ass adult. "Yeah, it is. And we will. I just need some time first."
"Yeah." he straightens, immediately peering about the room, "Okay. Uh, maybe wish you hadn't had done that just yet."
He catches John’s eye- who nods in agreement, a small smile touching the corner of his mouth. Then, Sam- who’s unconvinced- but needs someone to believe in it.
Dean's not meaning to pray right now, but words are coming through anyway. Like an old radio where the wires can't quite land on a wavelength the correct way and a dull static blankets the sound.
“And that entailed resurrecting... your father?” It's an odd choice. Dean loves his father, of course, but it seems that distancing himself from him and the childhood the man created has brought Dean far more peace than having him back ever would.
"Cas..." Sam exhales his name out, and strides forward without having to mentally recouperate and restart the way Dean's currently stuck.
It's like watching Dean turn into a character of himself. An old, tired face he pulls signaling some sort of internal shut off. The sheer fact of implementing it is only a hope in tempering down whatever emotion he's putting on lockdown inside.
How many times are they gonna have to do this before Dean nuts up and takes things for what they are? How many times is Cas gonna get beaten to a pulp just for giving a shit about Dean, for being perfectly fine with dying for him? Because of him?
"This is L.A., I know a lot of people." He twirls on his heel with a flourish, pointing a singular fingergun at the receptionist- who winks as he passes by, "Come on now. Group tour."
What grown man gives the object of his affection- an angel, who's unlikely to even have any idea what this even means- a mixtape? Of all things.
It's Thursday, which means karaoke. A few hunters are spotted around the bar already, but with the sun still up, most won't be appearing until much later. Cas is in the back office, filling out an inventory restock when Dean shows up in the doorway with two beers. He hands one off to Cas and keeps the other, grinning. He plops down in the couch beside the desk, peering over at the list. Cas can feel him eyeing him and looks up.
”Yeah you got a little something, uh, right there-“ Dean taps his forehead, Lucifer’s color darkening- rotting away- by the second, “I mean, face it, rock is dead.”
For once, he almost wishes John would yell at him. Call him a dumb son of a bitch. Screwed in the head.
"I'll tell you what," Dean raises his brows, "Why don't you take a walk, and she can face those consequences right here and now?"
likes guys. Has Cas been checking guys out left and right for years and Dean's just been completely unobservant? Surely he would've noticed that. He saw Charlie checking out girls all the time... so it's not a gay thing. It's just... has Dean just never paid attention? How has Cas paid so much attention to Dean over the years that he went ahead and fell in love with him and he feels all these things and has all these nice things to say but Dean can't even tell you if Cas has checked out a dude once in his life? Screw love interest, what kind of a
Dean curves his neck back, sucking up the last drip of his coffee and placing the mug down hard on the table, "This chick have a name or she just 'vessel?'"
For the first time, this seems to have a minute reaction. Dean tilts his head, brow furrowed, "Sam?" and he looks over to Rowena as though she might hold the answer.
”No.” Dean hates now much he sounds like a parent deciding that their kid isn’t going out to the mall with their friends but, just no. “You just came back from the dead, you’re taking a vacation too.”
To his surprise, it's Dean that answers her, jabbing back, pink-faced and with an uncertain smile, "Not possible."
"To family, you goob." She chuckles, but straightens up, "I know we're a little patchwork quilt made of mismatched pieces of different families all put together... but I'm glad some little good coulda come outta all that bad cause I can't imagine life without you all."
"...turns out this ape did read a book or two." Dean says, moving over to Sam to start unfastening his ties.
The moment passed with them just locking eyes for a minute. The one where Cas would read Dean in a way that no one else ever did, and somehow it had become a language of theirs over the years. Neither would ever acknowledge it but it was always there.
Claire breaks the tension by punching Cas in the shoulder across the table. If he were human it might’ve actually bruised pretty bad from the looks of it. “What the hell? You died? And you-" She reaches over and punches Dean’s shoulder, too, adding more spilt coffee to the puddle in front of him, and yep, that’s gonna bruise.
Oh he does not like this. Nothing about this conversation. Nothing about Crowley's sly and devious ways of extracting information and hoarding it like gold. Not when he's the focus of it.
"Look, maybe this isn't my place, and this is epic stuff... but, you know," She takes a breath, setting her jaw, "If I could have my son and my husband back? I mean...
Dean sits on the sofa, picking up the guitar discarded on the cushions, "Well, so what, Lucifer's a dork? That's good to know." he starts strumming a few loose chords- they come out tinny through the electric guitar, but their structures are actually sound. He never knew Dean could play guitar.
"Right," Dean frowns at that, shifting his gaze. It's the same thing that's on both of their minds, but they're not going to talk about it. What else is there to say? Cas made a choice- left them, left Dean. Now Lucifer is free.
"And now you owe me one." Billie says evenly, dark eyes staring him down- completely detached of emotion. But that cold stare turns away and lands on John, "This one. This one right here."
"What's the matter, you only fight women?" Spat Dean angrily as he dodged a punch Balthazar threw towards him.
The man looked at Dean, loaded down with all his bags, "If you want you can leave some of your shopping on that free table by the back room? Might make browsing easier."
"Har har," Said Castiel some tension left him as he smiled at Charlie "I'll call him later to see if he is alright"
"You mean for the shop? That's a good idea. We should order some decorations and do a display..." began Lisa, becoming excited at the idea of a project.
"Well, maybe a fortnightly thing," said Castiel after he finished chewing, "Am I getting... Do you think I've put on weight?"
That night as Gabriel raised a glass with his oldest friend, Victor Henderickson (who just so happens to be as gay as the day is long). John Winchester stared at the iron bars of his cell, while Dean and Castiel held each other close on a train, heading out of the state.
Walking out of the police station, looking tired and worried Castiel turned to Dean “Do you want to come back to mine now?”
"Would you mind if, I mean..." he scratches the back of his neck nervously, "Would it be alright with you, if I asked Dean out, do you think?"
