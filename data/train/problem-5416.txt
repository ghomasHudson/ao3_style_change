Tony startled, wondering how long had Jarvis been in the room without him noticing. He raised a teasing brow at Jarvis’ address. “Better not let anyone else hear you calling me that, my friend.” He smiled accepting the cup, noticing it was one of his personal sets. A delicate porcelain with red and gold flowery details that had been a gift from Pepper for his last birthday. Nothing too extravagant, but very much suited to his tastes. A favourite, no doubt in an elaborate effort of the worried staff to lift his admittedly not stellar as of late mood.
When he was packing his meagre belongings to leave for the war front, Steve had left behind everything that he associated with Tony, anything that would remind him of the man who broke his heart. Everything but that wooden box.
“You’re tired,” Steve stated when he felt Tony’s head once more droop against his shoulder. He felt him shake his head, letting out a sound that Steve supposed was meant to be in protest.
Now, this chapter comes with an update to the tags and the added warning of a very brief mention of past attempted noncon, definitely not between Tony and Steve.
It was unfortunately a tough task to manage. All through the evening, during what was to be a welcoming dinner held on the night of his arrival in his newly purchased home, Steve found his gaze wandering to the man who had previously owned it. The disgraced former Lord Stark. He'd caught himself cataloguing the details of his looks, the expression in his still handsome face, his out of fashion worn on the edges formal wear, his overeager smiles and loud personality, still desperately trying to be the centre of attention, even after all that had come to pass.
Her eyes widened in shock. “Do you actually listen to yourself? Who are you and what have you done to my friend Steve Rogers? He would never have stood for such behaviour!” she asked, her voice devoid of mirth.
He chose not to go on into further details, and Jarvis definitely knew better than to inquire about things that didn’t concern him.
Tony was by no means a blushing maiden, but each night with Steve felt like being touched for the very first time. It was both agony and elation being able to hold Steve in his arms, to be allowed to shower him with the passion he had held for so long, even though he fully realized that while this meant the world to Tony it meant nothing to Steve.
Natalia, no doubt picking up on Steve’s discomfort, tried to cover the awkward silence. “Do not for a moment forget it, Mr Stark,” she said playfully. “We womenfolk can be twice as cunning as a man, and far more dangerous too. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you about women using their special talents to accomplish nefarious goals. We shall soon rule the world!” she exclaimed happily, leaning on a nearby tree for rest.
Each day, Steve struggled to keep to his preconceived notions of Tony, while the man effortlessly proved each and every one of them wrong.
Inside the house, Tony went straight to his rooms in order to change before he ended up coming down with a cold after all. He resurfaced in time for supper, which was served in one of the private dining rooms of the manor, since these days it was only himself and Steve at the table.
Steve was reading a letter, Tony noticed, taking a moment to look up from his -futile- search. It was not a long one, that was obvious, since it was only a single page that had been folded on itself, and what seemed like a scarce few words written upon it.
He took out the succinct letter Fury had sent him and once again struggled to make sense of its few sentences and the hidden meaning behind them.
“Don’t look so startled, my lord. You need to be more careful. Young love is a wonderful thing, but think of how it would seem if people were talking about you two sleeping together. The awful things people might say, I dare not think of them! That you lie with him for his money, that he’s using you for your body, after first taking the last of your fortune,” Jarvis admonished, shaking his head in abject horror at the thought.
“It would have to be very short notice, you realize, my dear. I have to be back in town next week, so the only possible date for a ball would be on the eve of our departure, a mere six days from tonight. You can’t possibly be asking that of our host!” Dugan pleaded with his wife to see reason.
For several moments, Steve found himself unable to move. He just watched, mesmerized as Tony’s fingers slowly disappeared inside his body, one after the other. It felt oddly perverted to watch Tony do something so sensual, so arousing, without the man knowing he had an audience.
It had been clear from the start that these people thought of Steve as a victim of Tony’s schemes. They had even been doubtful that Tony was actually working for him, oblivious in their gleeful contempt for the man, and it was little relief that there seemed to be no word of him serving as Steve’s mistress in addition to his secretary.
“Hmm… perhaps,” Barnes muttered, accepting them, then lazily perusing. “What have you been reading?” he asked, not looking up.
He and Stone were playing a dangerous game. But seeing the man somewhat subdued after their earlier confrontation cemented Steve’s earlier assumption that, despite him claiming otherwise, Lord Stone really did
He pressed on. “My point is this: don’t let Betsy or anyone else tell you what you should feel. And don’t
Still, despite all that, Tony’s effect on him was maddening. Steve had tried to ignore Tony in their everyday dealings, for the most part. He had tried, and at times even succeeded to separate Tony the temptation from Tony the servant. It was a dangerous game to play, especially for his vulnerable -already thoroughly broken- heart, and every day that passed, it was getting harder and harder to keep it all up.
“Tony… you don't understand. He’s so much different from what I had made him to be in my mind. I think… Buck, this Tony, the one I’ve got to know these few months, he would never do that to me. He’s changed.”
Maybe Steve was finally finding it in him to forgive Tony? Maybe he was leaving behind the picture he’d constructed of Tony as an amoral libertine, unworthy of the respect of men better than him, and was willing to get to know him once more?
The warmth of Steve’s release inside him was what finally brought Tony over the edge. He came, softly whining around the still twitching cock in his mouth.
When Steve saw Tony that morning, looking once again his perfectly poised self, with only the hint of dark circles rimming his eyes to betray the events of the previous evening, Steve could only admire how adept Tony was at masking his emotions.
Steve’s eyes sparkled with amusement. A rare smile added to the man’s handsome features to the point of completely distracting Tony.
Steve wished he was allowed near him. He desperately needed to hold his delicate frame, to offer comfort with his touch. But
Tony willed himself not to be overcome with emotion. But, oh, was it hard to manage. He had almost lost all hope of it ever happening. He had spent hours thinking about how wrong it felt to only hear Steve address him as Mr Stark, or -even worse- just
Tony could see himself in Peter, he always had. He was as impulsive as Tony had been at his age, and just as bright. They even looked like they could be related too, with their dark curly hair and almond-shaped eyes. It had caused quite a bit of a gossip at the village some years ago, when Peter had first arrived with his aunt. People had claimed he was Tony’s illegitimate heir, invited there to be raised as a Stark. Thankfully, May had cleared things up quickly.
Lust must have been evident on his face because he soon caught Stark hurriedly lowering his eyes, cheeks darkened. Steve paused. Surely the famous Anthony Stark who’s had more lovers than money these last few years, wasn’t one to shy away from their deal?
“They have, my lord, and I’ve arranged warm baths for all of them. Peter is tending to the horses, all is well,” came the swift reply from the elderly butler and Steve nodded, gesturing at Jarvis to return to his task.
“Of course. You’re right, Mr Stark!” Peter said, finally smiling. “We’ll find a way to keep in touch, me and Ned.
Perhaps he was going about it the wrong way. If Steve couldn’t keep Lord Stone away from Tony for the rest of his visit, then he would just have to keep
After the service had finished, Steve lingered in order to meet with Mr Coulson, as he had originally intended.
Steve strolled down the winding path towards the church, following the rhythmic peal of the bells that called all parishioners to gather for Sunday service. He did his best not to pay any attention to the curious looks and whispers he attracted on the way there.
At night, Tony would cling to Steve tightly, would tremble with passion in his arms and it was getting harder and harder for Steve to convince himself that the look in Tony’s eyes was only lust.
Slowly, maddeningly, Steve started moving against Tony, his crotch dragging against Tony’s, both men moaning at the feeling of the other’s member against their own. Steve had his face buried in Tony’s neck the entire time, while Tony was left dazed, writhing in the pleasure Steve was giving him.
“Mmm... Perfect as always,” he complimented, sipping the tea in delight. When you lose everything, Tony supposed, you learn to enjoy the little things in life.
“Will you slow down for a second!” Tony cried, holding the reins tighter while he struggled to catch up with Steve. He swore when he heard the other man laugh and urged his mare to go even faster, though he knew she was no match for Steve’s stallion.
? This he was sure he hadn’t misread. Steve recognized true fear when he saw it. One couldn’t live the life of a soldier and not be intimately acquainted with it. And Tony
The atmosphere during dinner was strange, to say the least. Steve tried to keep up with his duties as a host and act jovial, while his heart and mind were still in turmoil. Predictably, Lord Stone was uncharacteristically reserved tonight, a fact that hadn’t gone unobserved by Miss Hill and the Carruthers, who kept shooting curious glances at both him and Steve himself. Thankfully, Sharon and Mrs Dugan were happy to chatter away like they had done every evening, and thus kept at least some semblance of normalcy.
Reverend Coulson was waiting outside the main entrance to the building, along with some of the women who lived there.
Once again, Steve felt ashamed of his conduct. Not only had he not made his presence known to the pair, but he had also stood there eavesdropping on them like some gossiping busybody. But, in Steve’s defence, it had been so long since he heard Tony like that, actually excited and
The days had started growing colder, and, now that Tony’s attention had been drawn to it, the familiar chill of autumn was creeping up his limbs. The sky above them looked ready to open up.
“I wondered about it, too. Fury thinks there must have been interference from someone of a higher rank. There was a case of treason, selling weapons to the enemy. The public needed to see someone pay. Even with the official charges being dropped, Stark was the scapegoat. He got off light, really. He could have very easily lost his head.”
“Maybe Robinson Crusoe? If you like a novel? Or maybe something different. The Age of Reason, by Thomas Pain?”
Steve wished he first discussed this with his secretary, but the man seemed to have simply disappeared. So, Steve would have to deal with the matter himself.
These woods were some of the finest in the land, and had been one of the reasons Tony’s father had decided he would build the manor there in the first place.
He knew he definitely had to tell Rhodes that he’d sold the estate. Tony surmised it wouldn’t come as much of a shock, since he’d been quite thorough in detailing his abysmal financial situation in his last letter. But, as much as he wanted to unburden himself to his best friend and most trusted confidant, he knew he could never tell Rhodey the rest.
If anything Steve should be the one to be pitied. To have loved someone so deeply, to have been brokenhearted for so long only to finally learn that he had fallen for a traitor, a liar and now a whore. He steeled himself before he turned and sure enough, there was Anthony Stark, his
“No, don’t be like that, Tony. Please...” Steve interrupted him,  insisting, though still quiet and reluctant, to learn the truth. He tried to voice his gravest concern, the one that he had dared not to think about before: that Lord Stone had - heaven forbid - meant to
After a brief proclamation of surprise -which Tony gathered was more of a formality than anything else - the visiting party took to Tony’s new position in the household as if it were a most natural progress of events.
It was too much, too good for Steve to be able to last any longer. He sped up his pace, his hips ramming into Tony, coaxing louder and louder cries of pleasure to fall from his lips.
“I say, my friend. You are terribly distracted this evening. Is everything alright?” Dugan asked him finally, voice filled with genuine concern.
The squick of the old door hinges was almost too loud in the deafening silence that filled the room. Steve supposed he should ask Jarvis to oil them as soon as possible, part of the house maintenance of course. Or better yet he would have his secretary see to it.
Steve cleared his throat. “Yes. The ladies insisted. I figured it would be a nice way to celebrate the railway deal and also make it known to the public.”
They moved as one body, waves of arousal flowing through them like lightning on a stormy sky, desperate and devastating all at once.
“I’m not saying you shouldn’t be with the man you love, Tony. Just, maybe keep some things for the wedding night,” he finished, squeezing Tony’s shoulder in a rare physical gesture of fatherly comfort.
“Ah, a new face!” he exclaimed, offering a hand. “There’s only one person this could be. Welcome to our parish, Lord Rogers! I am Reverend Phil Coulson. I was wondering when we would have the honour of meeting the new owner of Stark Manor.”
want his affair with Tony to be made public. Stone couldn’t actually walk away from this deal so far into negotiations without raising a lot of eyebrows and at least as many questions.
After he first moved in his rooms, Steve had, more than once, caught himself staring absently at the closed doors of his new study, as if he were conditioned to listen for the slightest of sounds, the barest of noises, the signs of Tony’s presence coming from the room next door.
Barnes smirked. “No. A book, Stark. After all, this used to be your collection. I would expect you are the best person to ask.”
“No… He’s never mentioned anyone to me.” So… Tony had a man in the navy that he trusted enough to send on such an important task. Something inside him protested the thought of Tony trusting anyone but Steve with his secrets.
Peggy, of course, had been able to see right through him, even then. Her advice was to not pay too much attention to what people said of Lord Stark, because people were cruel more often than not, and to just be glad Tony was still around for Steve to hear news of him. Peggy’s great love, a man she had hesitated talking about with Steve, but would to her dying breath swear half her heart belonged to, had been parted from her too soon, not by circumstances but by death. To this day, the knowledge that Peggy, after her passing, was finally reunited with her Daniel gave Steve a great deal of comfort.
His hands grabbed Tony’s calves and he pushed the legs to spread even more. Still licking Tony’s dick but never really putting it in his mouth, he brought one of his hands to the cleft of Tony’s ass only to still as he were, when he found a surprise waiting for him.
“Why the long face, honeybear? Someone stiff you on a job?” Stark calls out as he unclips and lowers himself from the safety harness to greet his friend. “No really, you look like your favorite hound just died.”
“Looks like it’s you and me,” Steve says, a thin hand clasping Tony’s shoulder, releasing with a pat. “Fair warning: I kick in my sleep.”
“And now you know better. So what if I fuck men too? What are you going to do about it, huh?” Tony can suffer a lot of shitty things in his life; Steve’s reproach is not one of them. “Gonna sell the story to Fortune 500 or the National Enquirer? Don’t bother; I’m already a disappointment to the Board.” He can’t fill his father’s shoes. They’re too stiff, too square, and he believes he’ll never convincingly pull off a leather dress shoe with all the certainty of his twenty-one years.
Stefanus picks up his sword as he rises to his feet then looks to the editor’s box where the local magistrate, Barbatus, holds out a closed fist. He holds his breath as he watches the thumb emerge from the side, momentarily suspended between life and death before turning upward, much to the vocal displeasure of the crowd.
“Come on, Rhodey,” Tony begs one day. “All we have to do is get some of the guys together, dismantle a car, and make some cosmetic modifications to it to make it look like a campus police cruiser, then reassemble it on the roof of the Great Dome.”
Flustered, Steve stands, barely sparing a glance at his groaning opponent. “I’m going to forage for more food.” He dusts off his robes. “Don’t follow me.”
Steve had made a similar miscalculation back in the early days. He still remembers the screams, the torn flesh, the fevered look in Dum Dum’s rapidly-yellowing eyes, the irises turning milky and unfocussed–
Steve doesn’t drop his weapon. “You are a Mandalorian, a bounty hunter. How stupid do you think I am?”
It’s only been a week, but perhaps withdrawal from his pheromones has hit Stark harder than most. He had been exposed to the highest concentrations after all. Still, not nearly enough time has passed for the man to progress to Step 9 of the Twelve Step Process, but if he’s going to beg for his penance, who is Purple Man to stop him?
Stefanus cuts a fine profile in his utilitarian tunic, dagger at his side and a keen eye for their surroundings. Antony wishes he could cut the evening short and see exactly what he has to work with underneath all that off-white wool. He had declined Priscus’s offer to examine the man in the nude before final purchase, preferring to be surprised the night of, but now he wonders if he shouldn’t have prepared himself in some way. If Antony had been interested in topping, Stefanus’s cock would require little consideration beyond aesthetic preference, but his plans being what they were…
It hits him the following morning as he looks down into the waste bin of his lab at the full blooms peeking through bloody mucus he had spent the last fifteen minutes hacking up.
So Tony clarifies, “You were drooling over some girly magazine when I know you don’t really like that stuff.”
He knows Barton killed Natasha, but “You should let up on the poor guy. He’s going through a lot right now.” Not to mention, after what she did, the woman had it coming. He didn’t exactly approve of how Barton had gone about it, but it was understandable at the very least.
Something in Tony’s chest dies a little at that, but he buries it deep, soldiers on. “It’s not a real first kiss. It’s just practice, so you won’t mess up the first time with Peggy.”
They don’t talk about it again. In fact, they barely talk at all. Not after that night nor over the next six years until Howard dies in a car accident one icy evening just before Christmas. Tony attends the funeral in a drunken daze while Uncle Obie handles the specifics – greeting guests, the eulogy, the burial.
“My uncle is staying with us, and my mom got mad he brought ‘trash’ into the house, so she threw it out, and I managed to snag it before the garbage man did,” Pinky tells the others, pulling out a coveted Playboy from his backpack.
Saturnalia was in mid-December and included many festivals in honor of the god, Saturn. This was a time of gift-giving, public carnivals, the munera (gladiatorial games), gambling, and the temporary role reversal of slaves and masters.
“It’s not…” He narrows his eyes at Steve’s drawing, zeroing in on its design flaws. “Well, what about yours? What’s with the wings on his head?”
“I am more than just thinking about it. I have already offered to take him in as a Jedi Initiate,” Master Erskine states, his tone still frustratingly calm and even, further raising Master Phillips’s hackles. “The Force is strong with this one.”
Steve grabs the stick when it goes in for a third jab. “Quit doing that. I won’t tell you again,” he says through grit teeth.
Had this always been the plan? Had Antony lied to him, manipulated Stefanus into thinking there was ever a chance both he and Bacchus could walk out alive then convincing his father to let him deal the final blow should Stefanus win?
If Tony had missed Steve and their friends during fall semester, those feelings become more acute the following spring. Having sampled a taste of his old life during the break, Tony feels their absence as classes start up again. He misses Manhattan as well as having friends and being among people his own age. Life at MIT feels so barren by comparison…
Steve tries to come up with the words to make it sound less ridiculous than it all had been, finally settling on: “I might have… made some assumptions that were inaccurate, and I thought… well, I thought that maybe you were being taken advantage of?”
“Ah yes. The boyfriend.” Dracula positively glares at Steve as if he is a leper or rather something Tony tracked in on his shoe. “Tell me, Steven, how would you smite Anthony’s enemies, hm?”
Steve isn’t blind. He can see Tony is an attractive (if utterly annoying) man, but sometimes… Sometimes he wondered if Tony’s company wouldn’t be more pleasant if he couldn’t talk around Steve’s dick stuffed in his mouth. And if Steve had gotten off to the fantasy early that morning after a fifteen-minute catnap due to Tony’s frequent tossing, well… He isn’t proud of it – it crossed all sorts of professional and moral lines – but it is what it is. He needs
“This is nice,” he sighs, his head dropping back to rest on Stefanus’s shoulder. He tilts his chin up to face Stefanus. “A man could get used to this.”
Maybe after he’s come down, Steve will suck Tony off. He’ll make it sloppy, his thumb pressed into Tony’s hole, trying to keep his cum inside as Tony cries out and his legs turn to jelly. He’ll keep him upright though, make sure he doesn’t fall. Cap’s always been considerate like that.
“We’re just friends. And is this really appropriate conversation right now?” Tony asks, eyes not-so-subtly flitting to Steve who is sitting right there, clearly visible and in his father’s line of sight.
“Yeah. About that.” Suddenly, there’s an explosion outside, and a bevy of shouting followed by gunfire. “I already called in the cavalry to this location. That would be S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Fury always loved making an entrance.”
But then Steve covers Stark’s hand with his own, his thumb worrying the space between Stark’s thumb and index. “I can get you something for that in a bit.”
of all people. And now that he had reverted back to an adult, there is only one thing left to do about it, the only sane recourse left after such a lapse:
“I love you,” Steve grinds out again, nearly choking on the words from fury or heartache, Tony cannot be sure. “And I don’t care that you don’t love me back, okay? I don’t care that it’s not me. None of that matters right now. I love you, and I don’t want you to die.”
As if reading his mind, Steve calls out from the kitchen. “I just moved in a couple weeks ago. I’m still getting situated. It’s not a permanent set-up.”
Bruce is on them then, his blurry face framed in horn-rimmed glasses hovering over Tony as the edges of his vision darken. “What did you do?! What the hell did you–”
“You told everyone!” he fumes. “You told everyone about us, about me! You told them I let you fuck me!”
“You’re right. The desk would be easier to clean.” Purple Man pulls Stark’s rolling chair away from the desk then turns his attention to Rogers. “You. Come over to this side and bend over the desk. Let your leader see the goods.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” and off go the pants along with his underwear. “My mouth gets me in lotsa trouble, that’s for sure, but I can also put it to real good use if you’re up for it.” Steve stands, naked as the day he is born as he advances on Tony. “Now, you sure you won’t be needin’ my help, Mr. Stark?”
“Okay, I got it,” Tony agrees, sounding defeated. There’s another beat before he asks, tentatively, carefully: “Is it… do you always have to think about that?”
“You wanna go? Let’s step outside, ya cockeyed bastard,” Steve had slurred at the larger, much burlier man who had made a comment about the rank smell of rotted fish stinking up the first-class lounge.
Please check out the moodboard, which served as an inspiration for this fic. Additionally, the Bingo square was a picture of LEGO Cap and Iron Man standing side-by-side, so I incorporated LEGO in the fic.
“In private,” he nearly hisses. “In private, you belong to me and I to you. What is wrong with the arrangement we have? If you will stay regardless, if this is the only way for us to be together, for me to support and spoil you as any man would his concubinus, then why does your status matter?”
“I know that!” Steve says, his jaw tight and voice a touch too loud and way more aggressively defensive than Tony had been expecting. “You shouldn’t joke about that stuff, Tony.”
Really, what would Steve say if he knew? Would he apologize? Would he lie through his teeth and claim to love Tony? That would be very on-brand for Captain America, but the thought does nothing to sway Tony from his resolve to keep mum. After all, the only thing worse than rejection is pity.
“Okay fine,” Tony declares. “But I’m hiring you to make a logo for a new division of Stark Industries. I’m thinking green energy or something.”
When he believes he has collected enough dry wood, Steve traces his footsteps back to their campsite, but upon entering the clearing, he finds nothing but their bundled belongings and a smoking fire pit, still warm from earlier.
All in all, Steve gets the distinct impression that not only is his presence unwanted, but Dracula dislikes him entirely on principle.
Stefanus sighs and rolls onto his back to face the ceiling as he taps his forehead. “Have you ever had a friendship not predicated on what you can provide for the other person? Someone who cares not for your money or influence?”
Also, in regards to the prostitute, Julia: Prostitution was legal in Ancient Rome, but adultery was not. Most prostitutes were slaves or freedwomen (former slaves); however, some prominent women chose to register themselves as prostitutes to avoid being prosecuted for adultery. Julia has been married several times and no longer desires to be, and she registers as a prostitute (specifically a meretrix or high-class call girl as opposed to a lower-class prostitute, the price of the latter being about the same as a loaf of bread on the low end) to have control over her own life. Some prostitutes became very wealthy, but most were destitute and desperate. During the late Roman Republic/early Imperial time, meretices cross-dressed, wearing togas (outfit of a Roman free male) in bright colors as opposed to the stola of respectable free women. Prostitutes also often wore breast bands, even during sex.
Tony sucks even as he slips off Steve’s dick with a slick pop. “Language,” he admonishes him, two fingers crooking in his ass.
“What do you like about it?” He’s curious of what Antony could possibly get out of it, having never been a fan of receiving himself.
(2) Nat would have stabbed him. Though considering the death glare she had sent his way when he started horning in on Bruce, it is still a distinct possibility. Her jealousy is an interesting development; one he will puzzle over later had he more time for such things.
“It just seems to me that you’re lying low because you’re embarrassed when you shouldn’t be. Howard was a hard man. He was smarter and more competent than most and as a result, expected a lot out of his fellow man,” Steve pats him on the shoulder in easy camaraderie. “It couldn’t have been easy being his kid.”
“My pen name. It is quite common in my field. My real name is Pepper, Pepper Potts, but I go by Frank Finley professionally.” She accepts the handshake with a firm grasp of her own.
“School just hasn’t been the same without you,” Jacques says as they sit in the shade of a large tree, the weather too hot and muggy for much else. “Freddy’s been trying to horn in on Peggy since you’ve been gone.”
“Do you think I asked for this?” Steve retorts. “Do you think I wanted to see everyone I ever cared about, everything I’ve ever known and loved dead and gone?”
Later, after Tony has sat them on the couch and fussed over both of them, applying unnecessary bruise cream to Steve and admonishing his father for starting the brawl in the first place, he secures a promise from both that they won’t fight while he goes out back to check on Billy.
He thinks of the very first time Bacchus helped him don the toga praetexta, his eyes full of sorrow and resignation. He had told Stefanus that he will endure.
“Hey,” he interrupts. “No PDA. I’m right here,” before he mutters, “though that didn’t stop you last night.” He needs to set his own limits before this… whatever this is… goes any farther than it has.
This is usually the part where Steve smiles in relief, imparts some well wishes, and (most-importantly) leaves, but instead he hovers at Tony’s bedside, his arms crossed, the expression on his face being one that Tony recognizes as a precursor to his disappointed-dad routine. “So… I met Ryan this morning,” he begins.
“And? What did you say!” Nat demanded, a bit of a gasp in her voice. She slapped Steve’s arm, lightly, to emphasize the question.
“Plus, if you would so kindly rewind to just a few minutes ago,” Nat continued, “I believe I singlehandedly revived your love life from the dead. So. You’re welcome, times two.”
“Hey! Romeos, you think you could stop making out for one minute and take your burning cookies out of the oven?”
The next morning, Nat was in the kitchen pouring herself a bowl of cereal when Steve came into the living room. His hair was sticking up in all different directions and he was wearing winter-themed pajama pants, sky blue with white polar bears in red christmas hats—appropriate for this time of year, being that it was a week from the holiday.
“You sure everything’s okay?” He knew the answer, already, but he felt a need to double check, just in case.
Tony was startled. He hadn’t even noticed that he was, and, besides, he wasn’t expecting any kind of reaction because he had assumed—mistakenly—that Steve had already fallen asleep.
Steve’s face was scrunched up, looking confused, and somewhat offended—although not enough to argue, at least not at this juncture—so Tony continued, quickly.
Nat physically felt a pang in her chest. God, none of this was right. Tony? At a loss for words? It didn’t make sense at all.
“Nat,” he sighed, “I really don’t know what you’re talking about, okay? I just wanna work on this.” He broke eye contact.
Tony rolled his eyes, smiling, and then continued, “The guy, Matty, he puts tiny cardboard Jenna’s—Jenna is the name of the girl he loves—in the house, doing Jenna things, like reading this magazine she’s obsessed with, and he does the same with himself, and the whole thing is decorated in this way that’s so simple but, also it kind of shows that he knows her better than anyone else? And there’s obviously so much thought that went into it, you know? And, well, I don’t wanna spoil the movie, but,”
When he turned around, Steve had his eyebrows raised, and a hint of a smile on his face. Tony could’ve lost his mind right then and there, looking at Steve in his Santa-suit Christmas apron, cookie dough way up near his hairline, where he had clearly swiped his hand across his forehead without knowing it would leave cookie remnants. Tony’s heart was
Tony could’ve made some remark about how she was going to ruin her own surprise by peeking, and how she ‘should warn a guy next time,’ but the truth is, he actually didn’t mind much at all that she was here, asking that, because he had been dying to get a second opinion on Steve’s gift.
Lost in thought, he must’ve begun to cry a little, and a tear from his eyes rolled down onto one of Steve’s knuckles.
Nat spoke up. “I wish I would’ve known sooner, Tony. I wouldn’t have questioned for a second why you were acting the way you were, you know?” She felt so embarrassed, even though she knew it didn’t make sense to feel that way. There’s no way she could’ve known what was going on, but she still wished she could have, somehow.
As he stripped the layers of penguin-snowflake wrapping away, and then opened up the box, Steve felt his eyes begin to well up with tears.
“Fine. He’s gonna go for a run. At 5, he’s gonna wake up, and go for a stupid run. But you proved nothing! You knew it too, so what,
He was genuinely unbelievable. The absurdity of it all—Clint’s sleeping habits, Tony, this conversation—it was
He paused. “Except, I couldn’t really get anything done? It’s sort of been a disaster. I mean, how can you focus on anything when someone tells you something like that?”
up Steve, you are unbelievable!” Steve was laughing so hard that some syrup had spilled from his mouth down onto his chin. He wiped it with the back of his hand.
“Yeah, yeah, she helped.” He admitted. “Okay, she did everything. All I did was show up in her room and wake her up from what was probably a lovely dream about Deputy Director Hill.”
Still, she couldn’t actually be mad at Tony, even if she knew how tough this was for Steve. If anyone knew what it was like to have no control over who you did or didn’t love, it was Nat. Besides, it didn’t exactly seem like this whole fiasco had been easy on Tony, either.
“Is that cardboard you and Steve watching a cardboard TV screen with the fucking movie on it? Romantic
Nat could’ve slapped him. “You know what? I think both of you could really use ‘on the nose’ right now. Desperately. So, I say, be as obvious as possible, and then actually? Be more obvious than that. Because, clearly,
“Nat!” Tony was definitely laughing now, even if he was trying his hardest to glare at her and wag his finger disapprovingly.
sense that whatever was going on with Tony had at least something to do with Steve. Maybe everything to do with Steve.
Nat rolled her eyes, but nodded her head slightly as she did it, signaling that she agreed with that course of action.
Tony’s voice got a little quieter when he said that last sentence. He started looking down and tapping on the counter with his fingers. He looked unbelievably adorable, Steve thought. It was actually unfair.
“I know you’re rambling, because you’re nervous, and you didn’t wanna talk about this in the first place. And you don’t have to if you don’t want to, really. But if you do, I’m here, and I’m the last person on earth who would make you feel bad about whatever it is that happened, okay?”
She debated those questions for a few days, until she didn’t exactly have a choice. Tony made the decision for her when he knocked on her bedroom door at three in the morning.
Steve had continued his breakfast mission all throughout Tony’s interrupting, so he had a mouthful of syrupy sugar at the moment Tony dropped that last bit of information.
Steve had one arm wrapped around his front, near the reactor, the other tracing lazy circles into his skin. Tony felt at home in a way he didn’t think he would ever feel. Home had always been a word that he spoke with disdain, when he was growing up. It wasn’t the warm welcome that greeting cards and holiday commercials made it out to be.
He exhaled a big breath before continuing, “I know it’s nearly four in the morning, and you should be sleeping and all, but as for me, well, we’re actually at peak functioning time for
“Neither can I. Who knew engineering geniuses could master plain old arts and crafts?” Steve smirked, stopping short of rolling his eyes at Tony because, hey, it was Christmas.
Nat knew something must really be bothering him, for him to show up like this. Regardless, she certainly didn’t mind. She was just glad he was letting himself ask for help.
Steve started to speak again. “About a week ago? We were sitting here—me and Tony—on the couch, I don’t know, we were probably watching
He paused for a split second, and then, “Me, specifically. I ... I love you. Um, I don’t think I’ve said that, yet? I think I said ‘in love,’ but I don’t ... I’m not sure if—oh well. I’m saying it now.”
Nat played along. “Oh? Interesting.” She rolled her eyes, not that Steve could see her. Then, “I was just wondering how things went the other night-“
Steve could feel the confidence hiding behind Tony’s careful words, masked by the trepidation in his movements as he shifted his own hands towards Steve’s. But it was there, nonetheless. Like Tony knew what Steve would say, like he was positive about it, but he still wanted to hear the words before he let himself feel any real sense of accomplishment.
Captain America. Super strength, lightning fast reflexes, whatever it is you took a 70 year nap for, and you still couldn’t figure out that I was in love with you? Sheesh, embarrassing.”
There was something divine about the places on his body Steve touched, something sacred in the way those places were remade and reshaped and the way he felt brand new every time Steve spoke his name with adoration, or spilled kindness and pride and tender words over him like holy water.
He stepped away from the litter of crumpled papers and loose screws crowding his workspace, made his way over to the couch in the opposite corner of the room, and sat down. He looked rather defeated; his hands were covered in grime, his hair was hanging in oily strands down into his eyes, and the clothes he was wearing were rumpled and worn out. The look on his face was that look a toddler might have right after they find out they can’t have a lollipop, and right before they start to cry.
dramatic, but what can he say? That was his way of dealing with the absolute mess his life had become.
”Why thank you. Just for that, you two can get back to your kissing. We’ll look away, promise! Right guys?”
stood him up for your usual sparring match. Maybe Bruce hasn’t said it, but I know it’s hurting him that you won’t work on anything with him anymore. You’re always doing things alone. Steve-“
“I can’t believe you did this,” Steve answered, finally. He grabbed Tony’s hand in his, and then clasped over their interlaced fingers with his free hand, kissing one of Tony’s knuckles so gently that Tony just might have imagined it.
He always figured something must be wrong with him, to not speak of home with reverence. To not even, truth be told, understand what it meant or could mean, beyond the dictionary definition. Now, he understood.
At this point, it’s been almost a year of Steve hopelessly pining after someone he thought he couldn’t have, even in his wildest dreams, and a year of everyone else wishing that their team leaders weren’t such absolute idiots.
“It’s not the speech that’s bad, Nat. Or my acting, for that matter.” He laughed a little. “I mean okay, my acting
As Christmas morning rolled around, Tony could hardly contain his excitement. He was seriously thrilled about his gift, and he couldn’t wait to see Steve’s reaction.
Nat was pretty confident that he believed her, like he knew that all along and just needed to be reminded. She smiled to herself.
Tony was staring off into space—his line of sight matched up with a picture on Nat’s dresser, but looking more so through the thing than at it. He had the same sort of faraway look in his eyes that Steve had had after he and Nat’s conversation.
“Me? I’ll have you know, no one else would sit here and listen to you fake complain about Rogers’ eating habits like whole wheat bread was your love language. Clint would’ve been napping five love-sick details ago and you know it. You’re lucky to have me.”
He opened one eye, partially, and looked at her as he said, “Promise!” and then promptly fell asleep.
If they were both very tired from fighting bad guys, Tony particularly so—because god knows the man does not sleep when he needs to—and so he fell asleep before the happy ending, and his head sort of made its way onto Steve’s chest, that would be
When his nightmares made him relive tragedies, made him feel like a fracture of a person, he wished on the stars outside his bedroom window, for clarity and for peace. For
Tony was making the joke so he wouldn’t get too emotional and weep like a big baby right here in front of everyone, and he knew it. Steve wouldn’t stop looking at him like he just rescued a kitten from a burning building, though, so he didn’t stand a chance.
“I wanna say no,” Nat admitted, “but you’re right, at least about the ‘I should be sleeping’ part. I don’t think anyone’s ‘peak functioning time’ is four am, though, no matter how much you’ve tried to make that work. You’re not like, a bat, Tony. You’re not
“You’ve been working a lot lately,” Nat countered. “Like, an unhealthy amount. I’m not the only person who’s noticing, either, Tony. I’m asking you because I care about you, and I care about the team, and they’re all too awkward to say anything.”
Steve took one look at him, then the box, and started peeling the paper away. Tony just looked so happy, and excited, and it was making Steve brim with anticipation now, too. What could possibly have him so eager?
guys have watched that movie like, a zillion times. So it was just, weird? But, hey, he’s obviously gotten the ‘I’m busy’ message you’re sending out to everyone, on every frequency.”
What I’m asking is why are you saying that in the first place? It just seems like, I don’t know, kind of a painful hypothetical? Considering?” He gestured loosely at himself with one hand.
“Thanks. I—um. This ... this has been, like, crazy, by the way.” Tony put his arms up on Steve’s shoulders, clasping his hands closed loosely around the back of his neck.
“I’m talking catastrophically unaware, Rogers. And honestly, this one’s kind of on you, I mean, I’m just a guy in a suit, and being a mess is one of my—many—charms.
“... Everything.” He divulged. “Well, okay, not everything—we would’ve been there all day. But! I asked him if he ever got lonely, right? And-“
Nat was kind of tired of leaning over the couch, so—believing that Steve just indicated they would be here a while longer—she did a 180. This way, she could sit on the back of the couch instead, with her legs crossed and the balls of her feet touching the floor. She looked up at the ceiling and waited patiently for Steve to explain.
When he was in the middle of making breakfast—he didn’t make his usual stop at Jenny’s, he just wasn’t up for it—Steve nearly flung the pancake he was making right up into the ceiling.
“I just don’t know what I did wrong, you know?” Tony asked, rhetorically. “I keep running it over in my head—everything he told me—looking for answers, and they just aren’t there. I’m confused, more than anything. I don’t know.”
Nat was curled up on an armchair, doing almost the same thing, except she seemed more like a detective, genuinely determined to guess what was in the packages.
A dollhouse, just like Jenna’s, except in the places it wasn’t. Pink glitter sprinkled over the roof, but instead of the pastel pink and lavender of Jenna’s suburbia, the house itself was painted a shiny silver with electric blue accents, like the Tower, complete with the Avengers “A.” Cardboard cutout people, like in the movie, but it was
because a healthy jog apparently wasn’t enough to make him stop thinking so much. And he was going to lose his mind if, well, if his mind didn’t cool it. He needed to go take out a couple of punching bags.
mean, I literally don’t have the mental capacity to pull off a ‘gotcha!’ right now. The sun’s about to come up and I’m sitting here talking to you, remember?”
Later that day, in the afternoon, Tony went looking for Thor so that he could make up for their missed sparring session.
until you think you might actually burst, into tiny bits of the person you once were, and float away.
Tony was pretending to be mad, but you could see in his eyes that the statement wasn’t entirely sarcastic. Nat was trying and failing to hide her giggling.
Neither of them spoke for at least five minutes. Tony watched the time tick away on Nat’s alarm clock, desperately trying to find the words he wanted to say—to remember why he even thought it would be a good idea to show up like this in the first place.
When he was handed a gift, he would hold it up and shake it next to his ear. “Ah, what could this one be!” He’d say, bright eyes and wonder in his voice.
It started off so small, so imperceptible, that it took Steve himself months to really decide it was a problem. Steve and Tony had been close for years now, so it wasn’t like there was anything strange about Steve wanting to spend time with him. If, after a mission, Steve asked Tony if he wanted to watch a movie, and Tony said yes, and they half watched half made fun of some harmless rom-com, that wouldn’t be strange at all.
He loved Nat, of course, and under ordinary circumstances he would have talked to her about anything under the sun. They had no problem doing that. Today, though, and for the last couple weeks, actually, Steve just didn’t feel his best. He wasn’t in the mood to talk about anything, really. He wanted to sit on the couch and mope and pretend like it mattered deeply to him that Kate and Ryan pick house #3, the ocean-front bungalow.
“You’re a self proclaimed genius,” Steve mumbled through chewing, “How is this my fault?” He looked at Tony innocently from where he was leaning against the counter, one hand holding his plate and the other continuing to shovel food into his mouth.
“So, yeah. Everything’s been awkward since then.” At that, Steve started chewing at his bottom lip, and reverted back to his previous, curled up position. Both arms were draped around one leg, and he let his cheek rest on his knee this time, face still turned towards Nat. He had a faraway look in his eyes.
“Okay, fine. Let me show you.” Tony moved past Nat and into the closet, and she heard him rustling some things around before he reappeared in the doorway carrying a rather large contraption, concealed with a pink blanket that was draped over it. He set it on the floor between the two of them.
“Well—no I’m just saying, Tony, I know you don’t ... but–but it makes sense that he might think so,” her words were becoming more of a ramble, everything said with an air of detachment, “and that he would fall for you, because you just, I don’t know, you talk about him like-“
A couple minutes passed, of them just like that. And then Steve pulled back, enough so that he could look at Tony’s face, but not so much that they were disconnected—Steve’s arms were still slung loosely around his hips.
“Let me get this straight. You thought Steve—Steve Rogers, Mr. America, the man, the myth, the legendary fossil himself—had time for some secret double life, in between being an Avenger
He looked up at Nat, when he started to ask that last question, and then he cut himself off. She was smirking, and she looked wildly pleased with herself. Clearly, Tony had walked into a trap, once again.
They would be in the kitchen, and Steve would be making an omelette, or something, and Tony would come up behind him and stand on his tip-toes to get his head just above Steve’s right shoulder, and he would say, “Are you makin’ some for me?” And it would always be an unnecessary question, because yes, Steve was always making food for both of them, or whoever else was home and hungry.
Nat felt these teensy secondhand butterflies in her stomach. For a moment, a picture played in her mind, of young girls at school gushing about their crush of that week. It was silly, but she felt like the feeling she had was the feeling those girls would have—this sort of vicarious energy you get when someone you care about is ~doing a big thing~.
Nat knew this inquiry was on its way the moment she was awoken from her sleep. That didn’t mean she wasn’t still dying for any reason to get out of answering. But there was nothing to be done.
He sighed, again, much louder than necessary, and tossed his head back onto the arm of the couch. Steve wanted to be able to get all of these ridiculous words out, sure, but he knew things would go a lot smoother if he didn’t actually have to
Tony had been sort of mopey lately, always sighing, spending way too much time working on projects that seemingly had no point, and, consequently, losing his temper fairly easily due to a serious lack of sleep.
“Well he’s looking at me so intensely, like to the point where I felt like my skin was burning, okay? And I say ‘Yeah, right. Yeah.’ Not sarcastically, or anything, but just. Yeah, he’s right.”
see. So all of this,” she gestured at the presents on the dresser, “was just a distraction? Unbelievable, Stark. You really didn’t want me to find ... whatever’s under there, huh?” She raised her eyebrows at him.
Tony thought back to last night, to the feeling of being in the arms of his favorite person in the world. His tears slipping onto Steve’s skin before he had a chance to be stupid and worry that he shouldn’t let himself feel so much so soon, that he wasn’t worthy of real love, or whatever preposterous ideas his mind might have conjured up had Steve not been there.
“... Well? What do you think?” Tony asked him, all timid and skittish but somehow so sure of himself at the same time.
Cardboard Steve and Tony in front of a cardboard TV, a piece of paper glued to it on which Tony had drawn modest renderings of Jenna and Matty in sharpie, and their very own itsy bitsy dollhouse that started it all.
Tony felt sick, and he just wanted this conversation to be over. All he could manage to say was “Oh.”
“I hope that’s okay,” Tony said, quick and under his breath. And then he looked at Steve, now that he was finished, ready for the consequences.
“Seriously, Tony. I panicked and bought you a watch! I didn’t think we were going all out with, like, three days notice. God, I’m never gonna live this down.” His face turned serious, before he spoke next, his body gravitating toward Tony’s instinctively, pulling on the bottom of the other man’s Christmas sweater absentmindedly, looking down at nothing. “I can’t believe you did this for me.”
He cringed a little bit, just the thought of what happened next making him feel the embarrassment all over again, in real time.
Some people do things on accident, and it’s okay, because the stakes aren’t all that high. Maybe they forget to pick up milk at the grocery store one night, and in the morning they find themselves staring down a bowl of dry frosted flakes. Or, they set their alarm for PM instead of AM, and the next day they face the wrath of a boss whose mandatory meeting they slept through. But for others? For others, the stakes could not be higher.
“Okay okay,” Tony conceded, “Can I get yelled at for my sleeping habits later? One debacle at a time, please.”
“Yeah?” She answered. “Oh my gosh, Tony, did you create a miniature replica of the house they live in, or something? I mean, you
“Well no, of course not, couldn’t be. Ordinary dollhouse wouldn’t warrant a million, let alone a zillion viewings,” Nat said, faux-seriously.
Nat was thrown off guard. “... No. He didn’t, actually. I was about to say that Steve hasn’t said anything, but I know this is bothering him too. Last night, he asked Clint to watch
Nat laughed, and then reached over to grip his shoulder lightly, trying to comfort him through touch. Trying to say
“Tony, please. Did we not already go through the you-know-him-better-than-you-know-anyone-else conversation? I thought this was settled over whole grain bread,” Nat recounted, not bothering to lookup from her investigation of Tony’s purchases.
He stated it matter of factly. There was a sadness in the way he said it, but his voice didn’t break, and he didn’t put his head in his hands or even so much as frown as the words came out. It was as if he was merely professing an unfortunate fact, like a weatherman announcing that there would not be snow on Christmas Eve.
It was nighttime now, the gold star and multicolored lights on the tree being the only thing brightening up the dimly lit living room. Thor and Bruce had clearly figured things out, once again with the help of Nat as, apparently, everyone’s own personal Cupid. The two of them were sitting close together on the floor, practically in each other’s laps, and Thor was holding his unicorn up in front of his face and making it talk in a high-pitched unicorn voice, no doubt telling Bruce how handsome he looked in the black and green plaid sweater he was wearing.
“You don’t know what unicorns are?” Bruce exclaimed, seeming genuinely distressed by this information.
Tony was pretty glad that he got to throw Steve’s disapproval right back at him, but he also felt like maybe he might throw up? So, he wasn’t in the clear, yet.
“Okay, okay,” Tony interrupted, rolling his eyes. “Yeah, this is all just one giant comedy special.”
“Yeah. I mean, I just, I never thought I’d have this,” Steve said. “I didn’t–I didn’t think that, here, in this time, that I would get another chance? That, um, that people would love me again. I thought I was just supposed to save the world. Does that make sense?”
”Good. Because it’s actually very romantic, thank you, and after this conversation is over, you’re going to be losing your mind over just how impeccable my gift giving skills are.”
“In our defense,” Nat claimed, “How could we not be looking at the pretty, shiny dollhouse-Tower? The rest of us are holding, like, socks right now, okay? Plus, I can see myself in there! What am I
Steve loved cooking for his friends, because it made him feel strong in a different way than he was used to. He liked that.
—his family. Steve’s family. Cardboard Thor sparring with cardboard Hulk in one room. Cardboard Clint and Nat in another—the kitchen, Steve realized—standing over a playdough pot filled up with yellow string to look like spaghetti.
Tony seems vaguely disappointed at his acquiescence. “Oh darling, always the romantic. Do stop. You’re making me blush,” he deadpans before turning to face Director Fury. “Leave the announcement to me. I know just how to spin this trainwreck.”
Chapter title is from Horace’s Odes, specifically Ode XXVIII: “Omnes una manet nox, et calcanda semel via lethi” which means “One night awaits us all, and the path of death must be trodden once.” Night in this sense means death, and the phrase basically means everything must die. Ancient Romans believed that people went to different afterlives depending on their deeds. Warriors and heroes went to the Fields of Elysium while regular people went to the Plain of Asphodel. However, if a person committed crimes, they could be sent to Tartarus to be tortured until their debt was paid.
Stefanus’s head lolls to the center, his eyes focusing on Antony’s concerned face. “Why do you hesitate?” he asks. “You demand I submit, and I cannot stop you from taking anything you desire.”
So a futurist and a man out of time walk into a restaurant, angling for a fight they don’t know they can’t win. The man out of time is a brute – nothing but experimentally-enhanced muscle, a well-balanced shield, and an oversimplified notion of right and wrong – he is easily dismissed, but the futurist… well, the futurist is interesting or so the protagonist of the story, the dapper and endlessly benevolent Purple Man, thinks. The futurist (Tony Stark) doesn’t deserve his help – he had mocked him after all, had made him look stupid – but the Purple Man will do it anyway, because he’s just that kind of guy.
– the rhythmic squeaking of mattress springs. God damn Steve and his weird aversion to Tempurpedic mattresses. Who cares if memory foam is a heat sink? At least it’s
“Great. Well, now is the time to put those to use. Use your Jedi powers or whatever to find us a water supply.”
“It’s about Mamma.” Tony plunks down his research, pushing it across the desk, desperate for his father to see, to
Tony puts his hands on either side of Steve’s shoulders and pulls him forward just as he closes his eyes and leans in, too fast for him to think better of it. He briefly presses his lips to Steve’s then just as quickly pulls back, releasing Steve as he returns to his original position. Steve blushes. He holds his fingers to his lips, his eyes wide.
“Right.” He starts packing up the items on the table, preparing them for take-off and passing a stack of Outer Rim coins popular in this sector to Rhodey in payment for his services. “So it’s been a pleasure, honeybear, but uh… we should be going. Duty calls and all that.” He gives him a small salute. “Until next time.”
It’s important that Tony doesn’t forget, doesn’t lose himself, when he is writhing under Steve an hour later, after they’ve eaten and their dishes are hastily abandoned in the sink to soak.
Antony’s face twists into one of anger and more than a little shame. “Because a man who owns his own body will not stoop to share it with another in that way, at least not in the bright light of day.”
He’s still wearing that ridiculous spandex, his uniform hugging every curve, every bulging muscle, and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination. It’s unseemly, but it’s not Purple Man’s disgust that matters. If it were solely up to him, Captain America would be manning a solitary outpost in Siberia, but Stark lusts after the man. Having spent nearly a month amongst the Avengers, that much is obvious to Purple Man. Stark’s eyes follow him like a lost puppy, his body language more open to Rogers than to his own bodyguard even. He trusts him, defers to him when he’s allowed, and is hopelessly taken by the man.
The myth of Ganymede and Zeus is the basis of Greek pederasty (the relationship between a boy and an older man), specifically Cretan pederasty. Ganymede was a beautiful mortal youth who Zeus abducted to be his cupbearer on Olympus. There is a bit of a role reversal here with Steve and Tony. Steve is younger and lower-status compared to Tony, yet Tony is the receptive partner, which would normally be scandalous should anyone come to know of it.
Tony would settle for being a good man, but even that feels like an impossibly high bar to clear these days, all things considered.
Stefanus grasps his friend’s bare right shoulder. “Take care, Bacchus.” He doesn’t know what he would do if–
“…You’ve spent way too long trapped in that mansion by yourself,” she states as she holsters her machete and begins to scale the fence.
“I like having options,” Tony counters. “Besides, I saved space by not packing any nightclothes.” He smooths his palms across the bed on either side of his thighs, giving Steve a saucy wink. “It’s sweltering, and I sleep in the nude.”
“Rise and Shine. We’ve got an itinerary,” Steve says, turning on the room lights as Tony groans. “We need to maximize our time outside the villa so you can be approached by arms dealers. First up for today is…” He checks his notes. “Yoga and meditation.” So, some new age crap. Tony should like that.
“And there is… I have a friend back in the ludus. I will do anything you ask, find any way to repay you, but if you could free him as well–”
pushing him forward. Stefanus looks into those beautiful brown eyes, half-hooded with pleasure, and has never been happier, more fulfilled.
Howard can disown Tony for all he cares; Tony is 18 – an adult – and there is little his father can threaten him with that will keep Tony under his thumb in such matters.
So Steve runs. He disappears into the treeline, leaping over root and under branches, cutting a zig-zag path through the underbrush. He wipes his blurry eyes on his sleeve to clear up his vision, never pausing in his retreat.
Antony spins around. “You do understand that if you were free, we could not be together, at least not publicly,” he says, his tone wounded.
“You do not have to pretend, not with me. I understand the need for discretion in such attachments.” Antony has spent his whole life hiding his own procilivities, to various degrees of success.
“What’s with the peach fuzz?” Bucky had teased, zeroing in on the change in Tony’s appearance almost immediately. “Trying out something new for the ladies? Does it tickle?”
“The oil, if you please?” Though if he chooses to act the sadist, Stefanus has no recourse but to endure the experience. He’ll be able to walk after; he’s certain of it. Surely, Priscus wouldn’t suffer damage to his property, not without a sizable fee for the privilege, arranged in advance and paid upfront.
“And whose fault was that? You were never around, too busy chasing after a ghost to see what was happening. Hell, maybe if you had stayed, she would have changed her mind or not fallen in love with someone else in the first place. You ever think of that?” Tony had begged him to stay, and yet the man still chose to abandon her – abandon them – for
The title means “Either fuck me, or let’s fight” and is from a poem recorded by Martial. He references this epigram supposedly written by Octavian (the future Augustus Caesar) to insult a powerful female opponent Fulvia, whose third husband was Mark Antony, in defense of his own dirty poetry.
Rhodey concurs, “That could work,” before turning to Stark. “They’re also checking all outbound flights. You’re gonna need to find a place to hide him onboard in order to pass inspection. Otherwise that’s an armada of tie fighters on your ass.”
Antony chuckles at that, and Stefanus can feel the beautiful rumble of it. “Quinctius can wait until after my meeting. I can suffer the old windbag’s company later.”
But Steve just waves off his concern. “So he time-traveled or something. It’s not important. He’s the new hero in town, ready to punch bad guys, some of which are totally Nazis.”
Tony feels bereft of the man’s touch, but he has no recourse to complain. It’s what he asked for after all. Still–
“You’re dead again,” Fidelis tells him, grabbing him by the shoulder and forcing him to stand straight. “I don’t know what has gotten into you, but that fancy benefactor of yours isn’t going to save you in the arena, boy. So, shape up and give Bacchus a fight he can learn from.”
“Wait,” Tony holds up his hand, causing Steve pause. “There’s a dance coming up next month. Do you want to go with me?”
Left-handedness was looked down upon in Roman society, with the exception of gladiators. Left-handed gladiators were advertised as such and trained to fight right-handed gladiators who were used to anticipating and blocking moves executed in the opposite side than what a left-handed combatant would do. This generally gave left-handed gladiators an advantage in the arena.
. Jan practically lives with Tony at the Stark Mansion serving as the team’s headquarters. Yeah, Tony can be self-centered, and his mansion is enormous to an almost grotesque degree, but had he really not noticed her presence?
Accensum qui pedicat urit metulam = The one who buggers a fire burns his penis. (Ancient adage meaning ‘don’t stick your dick in crazy’)
Tony’s mouth is a hard, thin line. “If the thought of sleeping next to a man is enough to throw you off your game, then you should have said something. I’m sure Thor could have protected me just fine. Hell, send Jan. Our targets would probably underestimate her.”
His floor-mate rolls his eyes, his hand over the receiver. “You planning to take this or not?” he asks. “I don’t got all day.”
Ah yes, Master Phillips: the face of an Ugnaught and the heart of an insect. Steve is about to imply as much when Phillips suddenly grabs Steve’s robes, jerking him down as he ducks himself, twin plasma blasts scorching the pillar in front of them where their heads had been.
He’s talking up an attractive blonde from BU when he spots Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome, made to appear even taller with his stylish flat top.
“Oh come on, there’s always a but,” Tony nearly sneers, running his fingers roughly through his hair. “You’re upset. The fact that I had a man in my room last night upsets you.”
“Is your sister aiming to take over as paterfamilias once your father has passed?” Antony quips. “How progressive.”
Steve’s belly betrays him, grumbling at the sight of crispy meat as his nose samples the savory scent wafting towards him.
They face off, each in deep concentration as they engage in the familiar dance of retiarius and secutor, shuffling back and forth in a circle around the other, Bacchus with his net looping around his left hand and Stefanus with his Celtic shield raised and wooden sword at the ready. Suddenly, Bacchus’s face alights as he looks over Stefanus’s shoulder towards the gate. “Isn’t that Staius over yonder?”
“I spoke to Mr. Rhodes, and he told me to come here to meet the client for my formal interview,” he explains as Tony stares at the ad, silently cursing his one-time assistant. Mr. Rogers fidgets a bit, trying to smooth out the wrinkles of his best (threadbare) work shirt. “I know I don’t look much the part, but I’m a good worker, sir. I don’t much mind strong-headedness – have a touch of it myself –” he catches himself on the slip. “That is to say, I can get on with just about anyone of any temperament.”
“I’m certain we can come to an understanding,” Antony says. “I have an event tomorrow, and it wouldn’t do for me to go unguarded.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark,” the stranger sticks out his hand for a shake. His wrists look delicate, thin enough for Tony to circumscribe its entirety with his thumb and pinky if he had the notion. “Steve Rogers,” he introduces himself.
“Fine,” Tony concedes. “Far be it from me to assume you’d want to get your dick wet during our honeymoon.”
“…Tony needs to find another emotional support animal?” Granted, the unicorn had been a logistical adjustment in all their classes based on sheer size alone, but Tony had insisted the creature’s separation anxiety was so bad that he couldn’t in good conscience leave it in the stables. The last time he had tried had led to more than a little horn-based property damage. Mr. Fury almost got gored through his remaining good eye trying to reign it in.
“Your mother died to bring you into this world, and this is what you do with that gift? My conscience in this matter is clear; is yours?”
Tony hisses – “Watch it, Cap,” – as he readjusts his position so that the wire shelf doesn’t press so hard against the bruise blooming across his lower back. Just because J.A.R.V.I.S. medically cleared him after the Avengers’ last mission doesn’t mean he wants to exacerbate his injuries. The janitorial closet in Corridor 3C of the Triskelion may not be particularly spacious, but it will do in a pinch.
“Not right now, Steve.” The Mandalorian is tearing through an engine of a junker ship, but it is unclear whether he is looking for something specific or if he just wants to destroy something.
Tony shrugs. “Alright… What kind of movies do you have?” He looks over at their TV set up, “Hey, where’s your VCR?”
“I go where you go, Stark,” he explains, slipping into the man’s now-empty chair and rolling off to the side for a better view of the action.
“You should get dressed, patatino. Mr. Morelli will be here soon,” she tells him as she carefully fixes her makeup with a moistened Q-tip.
“Would you like a refill on that drink, Mr. Stark?” a barmaid asks him, an old-fashioned primed and ready on her tray.
“Alright, but if he fails on his first outing as secutor, don’t say I did not give you fair warning.”
“Yeah, I’m right. Now, you’re going to bed,” Rhodey unplugs the phone before grabbing an extra pillow and blanket for Tony to sleep on the couch.
“It has to be you, Stark,” Director Fury interjects. “You’re the bait, the brain behind the weapons they want; Captain Rogers is the muscle we’re sending to keep you safe and out of their hands. Need I remind you: we don’t need a repeat of Guatemala.” Tony’s face darkens at that but the man continues, “Besides, you’re no stranger to controversy. The press has already documented your many…
He had considered having kids when he was younger, but it had always seemed like a distant possibility, something he’d get around to eventually in the undefined future. He had time; there was no reason to rush…
What if Stefanus is comically small and unable to complete the deed? His mind wanders to the graffito he had seen that morning:
“It’s a simple dig. A tomb for a pharaoh so obscure and likely buried in haste wouldn’t require such elaborate traps.”
“I want to use the radio,” Steve states evenly, his hand not retreating from his lightsaber. “I need to check in with someone.”
Master Phillips knows what that portends. “He doesn’t have the temperament,” he says, pointing out the obvious.
“I’m not coming back. I just got here, and you should really think about staying out of it as well.”
“And lube. You can never have too much lube. Don’t use baby oil though, because oil dissolves latex, and uh… see rule number one about protection.”
Steve is disoriented, being tossed within his harness as Stark deftly navigates between and around the fighters, firing off return blasts. They’re much smaller, more agile than his craft, but Tony has experience under his belt, and he’s able to take out three before long.
“Do I really hafta spell it out for you?” Steve rolls onto his stomach, head cradled on curled fingers propped up by his elbow as he gazes up at Tony with a languid stare. “I can suck cock with the best of ‘em. Interested?”
“I was once a retiarius as well,” Stefanus points out, his eyes narrowing. “Are you really going to reject good coin?”
They both dress, and Antony calls for late night service for two of wine and various delicacies from pork-stuffed dormice to fillet of ostrich served with a sauce of honey and expensive spices to be delivered to his room.
Suibne tips his head forward then sharply up, butting the buyer’s nose in a gush of red, just as his seller yanks the chain connected to his iron collar, choking him as he falls to the ground.
Steve doesn’t want the second disagreement to come to blows so he volunteers, “I’ll collect more wood for the fire if you find the flint to light it, yeah?” He doesn’t even wait for them to confirm the plan before he sets out down a well-trodden path into the forest.
“Too scared are you?” Dum Dum challenges him. “Lady Luck favors young Gabriel of late, and I would like to pit her goodwill for the man against her ire for Steve.”
The ship in front of them, surrounded by discarded palm fronds, is in no way space-worthy. With the reinforced metal siding removed, the internal shielding is exposed to the elements. Even the door appears to be missing, with what appears to be the contents of the ship spilled out on the ground outside and picked over by scavengers.
“By the Sith. The Republic… the Jedi, they fought alongside us and helped free Mandalore recently, restored our government,” Stark clarifies. “That’s part of the reason I took this job. The Jedi helped Mandalore, and so when one of them asked for a boon in return…” – another pause – “The pay wasn’t too bad either, but it isn’t the main reason. I don’t know the details of what’s going on with the Jedi Order or the Republic right now, but I have a mission, which is to deliver you to Tython, and I won’t fail.”
“Perhaps you should get a second opinion.” Tony knows he’s had several for his own ailment. “I can get you one when we return stateside. My treat.”
“We really should be leaving soon.” There was never a set time for these things with the rich operating on a more leisurely time table that the lower classes could ill-afford, but Stefanus knows Antony would like to get it done quickly, before his meeting with the city planners to go over his improvements to the aqueducts. It was a built-in excuse to evade an extended visit with an important paterfamilias he found personally distasteful.
“Not you, boy. The editor, Barbatus,” Fidelis grits out, leaning over to spit into the dust as if the very name proved sour and fetid on his tongue. His wrinkled visage contracts into a scowl, the lines of his face deepening. “He never reprieves losing retiarii, no matter their skill or popularity. Hell, with your helmet dislodged and face bared, it would have been you with your neck outstretched and pierced at his pleasure had you lost. That sick fuck has a thing for beautiful blonds.”
“When I first came to this cursed city, I had everything taken from me. I owned nothing, and this place… it just continued to take ever more than I thought possible,” Stefanus says, turning to look at Antony. “But then I met Bacchus, and he was… he was kind to me even when I had nothing to give. He gave me hope, a goal to work towards even when I was at my lowest. If not for him… do you know how many times I thought about it? How many times I considered murdering the men who touched me, about what I would do if I had nothing else to lose, but I couldn’t leave him alone in that place. It is what I held onto in my darkest hours.”
This story takes place in roughly 49 BC during the waning days of the Roman Republic before the establishment of the Roman Empire and at the peak of the gladiator games (munus/munera). It is approximately 5-6 years after Julius Caesar first invaded Britain and coerced many of the native Celtic tribes to pay tribute and send hostages. Generally speaking, conquered peoples who fought against Roman forces were usually enslaved wholesale, but if they surrendered, they were spared this fate. Steve’s tribe did not surrender. Caesar is assassinated five years later in 44BC. So anyway, I did some research, but it’s very hard to narrow down every single detail to the same specific time period so bear with me on any anachronisms.
It’s Steve’s own fault. He had been waiting for the perfect opportunity, like some world-ending cataclysm where he and Tony were the last two left standing, and as they faced the multitudinous horde (with – and this is important – absolutely no chance of survival), Steve would then look to Tony, desperate and hopeless, hold him close and tell him how much he meant to him, that if these were their last moments alive, he was glad it was with him. And maybe then, Tony would hold him back, not safe exactly but comforted in the knowledge that he wasn’t alone–
Bacchus’s eyebrows draw together in confusion. He draws a deep breath then nearly shouts, “I AM BACCHUS,” as if the increased volume will somehow aid in comprehension. He points to Suibne. “STEFANUS.” Then to himself: “BACCHUS.”
“It’s kind of hard, you know,” Steve says. He doesn’t look up as he clarifies, “Moving sucks. I liked where we were living, and I miss my friends. I didn’t want to leave, but Mom says this neighborhood is better.”
Tony straightens his suit, picks off a speck of lint on his sleeve, and rotates the bouquet 27.2 degrees to ensure optimal viewing angle from the door. Each of the flowers are perfect, hand-picked by his personal florist for freshness and superior symmetry, but some of the blooms are slightly larger, and he would prefer they be the focal point of the arrangement when he picks up his date for the Maria Stark Foundation Charity Gala.
” – he can’t help but roll his eyes – “to refuse. Plus, his old nemesis – who is a Nazi, alright? – has resurfaced as a top villain in world affairs.”
“What do you think of this amphora?” Antony asks Stefanus at a stand selling antique décor the following week. The figures of a nude man and youth in the color of the original terracotta clay, presumably Zeus and his lover Ganymede, stand stark against a painted black background. “Is it not a fine example of old-world Greek pottery? And the subject matter…” Antony gives him a heated look.
“Of course I’ve forgiven you. I’ve always…” there’s another sigh over the line. “I’ll always care about you, Tony. You’d have to do a hell of a lot more than that to push me away.”
And true to his word, Stefanus saves every copper As he earns, earmarking them towards his and Bacchus’s freedom, foregoing the pleasures of the prostitutes that visited the barracks in favor of his own left hand despite Bacchus’s frequent insistence that he should find some comfort outside their daily grind. Stefanus is sorely tempted sure, but his earnings always seem low in comparison to his purchase price as it is, though he figures that once he starts winning in the arena, the gap will decrease.
“They are Gardenias, sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. informs him rather unhelpfully from above. “I believe they signify secret love.”
The guy stops, turns to look at him, disbelief clear on his face. “We talking the blonde student you were chatting up tonight? Amber?”
Though it might be easier to do so if his former partners weren’t accosting him every fifteen minutes, Tony supposes.
Tony gets dressed and waits the requisite ten minutes until the painful scratchiness in his throat and ache in his chest become unbearable. He exits the closet then power walks towards the nearest restroom, quickly locking the door behind him and nearly throwing himself into the nearest stall to hack up copious amounts of bloody petals and half-formed white flowers. He retches and vomits more, his gag reflex not abating even after he’s empty and his lungs spasm and burn. Finally, when he’s calmed and exhausted, he rests his cheek against the cool toilet seat, unable to muster up the disgust to care where he is.
He presents it to the group. “That meat grinder Tony was going on about,” he replies, holding it out to Tony. “Found it in the back. Maybe now we can finally put your crazy-ass obsession to rest.”
“Let’s try this again, but with less commentary from the peanut gallery,” Tony begins. “Due to recent circumstances–”
“Well, you know what they say. Nature has a way of balancing things out. The big beefy ones are always dumbasses. Their height and muscles compensate for their severe lack of brain power.” And if Tony is including Bucky in that assessment, he’s not going to say it overtly, but Steve is smart. He’ll pick up on the slight and then make some half-hearted remark in his friend’s defense.
Steve places a hand on his knee. “That’s still two days away, isn’t it?” He slides up his thigh, looking over at Stark’s impassive helmet and trying to imagine the expression of the man underneath.
“Hear me out before you refuse, Stefanus,” Bacchus is saying after Stefanus’s first bout in the ring against a more experienced secutor had ended in defeat, with the editor having spared his life. “We can go halves on the fair Livia for the hour. She does not mind.”
He crosses his arms, steeling himself against Tony’s infamous determination. “I worked hard to get where I am. I’m not blowing it on a prank.”
“No, but you told him where we are going. ‘Safe Place’ and then spelling out T.Y.T.H.O.N.? What were you thinking?”
“As you say, it is an election year,” Antony reasons, “and I do not like the look of Hadrianus’s opposition. Harm may befall me on one of my many social outings to
Mr. Rogers seems to hesitate, then replies, “My mother was a nurse at the ward, but no… never been diagnosed with that.” His eyes flit away then back. “Does the… the client – do they have tuberculosis?”
“You should have seen your face just now!” Tony crows, but when Steve looks put out by the joke, he tries to play it off. “Aw come on, Cap. Don’t be like that. It’s not like you were actually in danger.”
“Jerk.” Stefanus looks out towards the light, the roaring crowd calling out for bloodshed, to cheer his friend’s victory and his demise both. “Be careful.”
Tony’s fingers curl into claws then fists as he rests his forehead against the wall and schools his voice to something cold, detached. “What’s the matter? Don’t have the stomach for it?” he grumbles before musing, “You think a cattle prod will bring out the Hulk? I have a hypothesis, and Bruce doesn’t seem opposed to human experimentation, all things considered. You both seem to have that in common, though that doesn’t have to be the only thing you two have–”
Well, nicer than usual. Perhaps this is just what Stark is like around a man who so recently saved his life. He makes more of an effort to obtain food to Steve’s preference, lets him sleep in an extra hour, and no longer pesters him about his Jedi ways (though perhaps that’s the least surprising development, all things considered). Their conversations are less confrontational as a whole, bordering on pleasant even.
Steve is defensive as he protests, “I told you I wasn’t good at it.” He pushes aside the slumped body, hurrying for the door panel to close and seal it.
“Not necessarily. Just hear me out on this one,” Tony says, waving his spoon in the air. “There’s this guy that I like.”
“It’s not happening again,” Tony repeats, with all the conviction of a man fully in charge of his mental faculties, of his urges and desires. A man of action, of spotless integrity…
“I must have left it at home seeing as how we needed to make room in the private jet for your extra swim briefs,” Steve replies, unzipping his duffle bag. “Now be serious; we have a job to do.”
There had been a point to this meeting, before it devolved into wild speculation on the identity of his sperm donor (as Tony had taken to referring to Cap in his head).
He then crosses the room and leans over to caress Antony’s cheek in a mimicry of affection he does not feel.
It isn’t until their midday break that Bacchus approaches Stefanus, having brought the latter’s rations to him while he rested his bruised and aching body.
Bacchus gives him a lopsided half-smile and pats his upper arm in easy camaraderie. “Have fun. I want details later.”
The gala is a mistake, a poor choice for an occasion of such import as his very first date with Steve. He had thought it would be the perfect way to charm the man, an excuse to get gussied up and show how his larger-than-life persona could be channeled into something good, something pure.
“We just got to keep moving, take it day by day,” Steve tells Tony, ever pragmatic. “That’s how we survive.”
“Staius, you’re here! Come sit beside me while Valerius regales us with tales of the brothels in Antioch!”
Steve had moaned when Stark’s fingers closed around his own erection, sliding his pre-cum down his length. He thrusts futilely, trapped between Stark’s hand and his cock.
That was one of the first things Captain America had said to him on the day they met, when he has stared down Tony with contempt, had sized him up and found him wanting.
He had wrinkled his nose around Steve even after he had washed up and was newly fitted with a uniform supplied by the Academy. “Ugh,” he had stage-whispered to another boy during their recreational hour in the open-air courtyard. “You can’t wash off the smell of failure. It just seeps out of him.”
“Hey Tony, how about you and me get out of here?” A woman in a tight-fitting blue dress accosts him. Tony had found her confidence sexy the first half-dozen times they hooked up, but there is a time and place for that, and it is not now.
“My apologies.” Dracula sounds anything but sincere. “I didn’t see you there.” But he doesn’t let up on trying to close the door on Steve until Tony intervenes, gently pulling him away to let Steve through.
“It doesn’t always hurt. If a man uses oil, if he’s slow… sometimes it doesn’t feel half-bad,” Bacchus replies. “Some people like it – older men even – especially if…”
He grunts in pain at a particularly rough thrust, his fingernails clawing Steve’s back and legs shaking. Tears prickle at the corner of his eyes, and he wonders if he’s bleeding, if Steve has torn something deep inside.
?” Steve begins, uncertain how to even broach the topic now that he has Tony’s attention. How else could he lend his support to a guy whose teacher is victimizing him if he can’t even figure out how to talk to him about the violation in the first place? “It’s just… if he’s forcing you, you know there are people who will believe and support you. You don’t have to take it.”
Oral sex was every taboo. Os impurum meaning filthy mouth or impure mouth implied those who provided oral sex and was an extreme obscenity. In comedies, oral sex causes toxic bad breath and may turn a fine perfume to fish sauce or a hot cake to excrement. The graffiti Tony finds referring to his father is adapted from the original Pompeii graffiti Isidorum aedilem oro vos faciatis optime cunulincet meaning “Vote for Isidorus for aedile, he licks cunts the best.”
Steve pauses at the foot of his bed, his back rigid and Tony replays the words in his head and realizes his grave mistake. Before he can figure out how to fix it, how to take it back, the man is back at his side. “I do love you,” he reiterates, and something in Tony’s lungs begin to loosen, to feel a touch lighter, less painful. But then Steve continues, “Even if you’re a real dick sometimes. I don’t understand it myself, if I’m being honest. You are an insubordinate, unrepentant jerk with a God complex who’s always pushing my buttons on purpose – don’t think I haven’t noticed – and you can’t ever say anything nice to save your life. It’s like you’re allergic to sincerity, and don’t even get me started on how you–”
Antony steps out of his bed chambers to find a bustle of activity. Iovianus is directing various domestics to gather up the grave offerings of woven flower garlands, violets, wheat, salt, and wine-soaked bread to be ferried to the Staius family mausoleum located outside the city limits. It is a mass exodus of sorts, with the entire city closed for business and emptying out into the surrounding countryside to visit loved ones and long-dead ancestors, the living offering up all matter of goods at monuments beside the main and branching roads in an annual renewal of mourning and familial obligation.
Antony juts out his chin and tries to angle his face so the youth can see the barest whisp of hair upon his face.
Just then Steve walks in with nary a limp. His super healing must have worked quickly as there isn’t even a trace of what had happened the night before in his gait. No stiffness, no favoring of his backside. Nothing. He is a sturdy one; not that there had been any doubt about that.
“You will find that Mr. Stark would prefer a… shorter sabbatical as it were,” Jarvis tries to warn him.
It is their last night before taking off for Tython, before they either bid each other farewell forever or die trying to escape the planet’s surface.
Ancient Roman naming convention allowed for up to three or four names. The first name (praenomen) is a personal name. The second name (nomen) is a family surname and the most important of the three. Some people had a third name (cognomen) which was at various times, a nickname or a way to identify a particular branch within the family. Occasionally, it highlighted an individual’s achievement, usually in warfare. Some people even earned a fourth name (agnomen) for additional victories. The upperclass usually used the third name to refer to each other. For instance, Caesar’s name was Gaius Julius Caesar and Cicero’s name (sometimes known as Tully in English) was Marcus Tullius Cicero. However, not everyone had a third name (e.g. Mark Antony’s name was Marcus Antonius). In English the –us is often dropped from Roman names, so Marcus Antonius becomes Marc Antony, Plinius becomes Pliny, Constantinus becomes Constantine, etc.
“Very. How else is he to ensure my safety?” Antony tilts his head to the side as he regards his friend’s curious expression. “What?”
“I’ll be happy to get back to civilization. Maybe we can even get the laundry working on the ship,” Steve replies, itching at his robes, containing the musk and wet heat of several days. He had feared washing his clothing in the stream, afraid they’d never air dry in this humidity. Sweat was preferable to mildew after all. At least Rhodey is bringing an extra change of clothes. With Order 66 in place, Steve can’t go around wearing his robes anyway.
Tony explains anyway. “There was a Last Unicorn convention where all extant unicorns get together and fight it out for the title of Last Unicorn standing. It’s supposed to be ironic, I guess.” As if unicorns are capable of understanding irony. “Sparky here is the grand champion for the second year running, especially after I redesigned her armor.”
Steve thinks. The Republic is thousands of years old. How could a single man, the leader of its governing body, undo generations of tradition in one declaration? Is this what Master Phillips and the Jedi High Council had sought to prevent? Was this the hill they chose to die on? The line in the sand they tried and ultimately failed to defend?
Steve holds him closer. “Thank you,” he murmurs. “That will also give me some time to get some supplies. I uh… I did not expect anything to happen tonight, but you can stay if you’d like. I have an extra T-shirt and sleep shorts you can borrow.”
“Spirit only gets you so far,” Fidelis grouses. “He’s destined to be a laughingstock, derided and reviled in the arena as he prances around in a tunic with gold streamers glittering in his wake. I need men, not the lanista’s trussed-up little pusio with perfumed hair. The crowd will eat him alive.”
They had been disposing of their food waste a short distance from Stark’s ship, but that proves short-sighted when the refuse attracts a pride of saber cats. Steve had run towards a shout that quickly morphed into screams until he came across Stark pinned by an eight-legged creature. Two already lay dead while two others pounced onto his flailing limbs, trying to use their teeth to get around the beskar and leather.
“Let me get this straight, just so I have a clear understanding of the situation at hand,” Bacchus says later when Stefanus tells him about Antony over a meal of barley and eggs with goat’s milk. “You have a… let’s call him a patron, who likes you enough to purchase exclusive rights to your services. He buys you nice things and does
“Of course not. That would require him to string together words and thoughts into something a human person can understand.”
Antony doesn’t quite remember who or what started it – if one were to ask him later, he would say it was Hadrianus – but it had ended with Antony stomping off into the brush to cool down, lest he said something he regretted. (Everything he had said to that point was perfectly fine and within bounds to his adolescent mind.)
“I’ll figure it out. It’s not like you’re graduating anytime soon,” he looks over at the dessert menu on the small laminated marquee on their table. “Want to split a slice of apple?”
And now Bacchus seems a touch cagey, but still he confirms, “Yes. We are allowed to buy our freedom should we come into the funds through victories or… or doing that.”
The situation isn’t ideal – Steve had had it all planned out; he had wanted to take Tony to Paris or maybe even the white villas of Santorini to pop the question – but he isn’t sure he’ll live that long. He has to know. “Tony–”
Stefanus’s knees give out. He falls to the ground, dropping his sword to embrace a still-living Bacchus.
“It’s best not to think about it,” Steve replies. He takes out another one and then another, his knife zipping from the eye of one then into the pate of another’s head. The zombies are always slower and easier to deal with in the dry heat of high noon. “And even if I did, I don’t think I would recognize them in this state.” Anything that had made them human, had made them individuals worth knowing and loving, is long gone.
“Oh, I’d say pretty stupid,” the Mandalorian says, taking a step forward, stopping just outside lightsaber range. “Relax; if I had wanted you dead, you’d be on the ground with the others. I was hired six months ago by your master to protect you should the worst happen, to ferry you to the planet Tython where you could be safe, hidden with a small enclave of your kind.”
Amber seems to size up his date, finally settling on: “Hmmm… aren’t you a tall drink of water? But then again, Tony has always had impeccable taste. You want to watch? Maybe tag in? Tony isn’t shy; this would hardly be his first Devil’s Threesome. It wouldn’t even be his fifth.”
Steve turns to face Tony, almost grief-stricken that one of his best friends turned out to be a filthy degenerate. “I just want you to be safe.”
“Whatever transpires… neither of us are at fault, Stefanus,” Bacchus tells him. “This day, though unwelcome, is not unexpected.”
It wasn’t until he was twelve that he realized Hadrianus was simply uncertain about whether he would lose Antony too, unwilling to emotionally invest in his son until he survived early childhood. But by then, it was far too late; Antony had built up his emotional walls until both he and his father were closed off to each other. Their relationship remained strained, tense, almost cold, and Antony liked to stress his father’s patience on many an occasion. It was one of the few ways he could hope to garner his attention if not his love.
“The black pudding is delicious,” Steve tries once again. Tony had told him such fare is only served on special occasions. Steve is surprised his father deigned to serve it to an unwanted interloper such as himself. Then again, perhaps Tony’s return to the homestead is special enough. He clearly dotes on his son even if he can’t countenance Steve. “Tony says the ones I get at the Eastern European specialty shop aren’t nearly as good as yours. Perhaps I could get a recipe, Mr. Dracula?”
Steve looks at his arms and around his back, then gives Tony a once-over, focusing on his legs where the zombies had almost gotten him. “No, I think we’re fine.”
“Thank you, Jarvis. You’re a lifesaver,” Tony says absently, before turning back to Steve. “If you like her so much, you should call her.” He isn’t sure whether the man is into sloppy seconds. Truth told, Steve rarely seemed interested in anyone these days.
“You taking this no-good, stinking-drunk mackerel snapper back to his homeland?” the man shoots back, his gaze fixed on Tony. “If so, you’re doing the Lord’s work.”
“I’d ask if you brought flowers, but uh… I think we both know I’ve had enough of those,” Tony rasps and tries to laugh it off, but it comes out a wheeze.
He slides in closest to the hull, lying on his side faced away while Stark slips in behind him, an arm thrown low over his middle. There are lips on the back of his neck, pressing soft kisses upon the skin there, as Steve drops into a deep, satisfying slumber.
Master Phillips mulls it over. “Okay fine. Satisfy your curiosity and move on.” Master Erskine will see that the boy is mentally unfit to be a Jedi Initiate despite his obvious aptitude, and that will be the end of it.
Tony only rolls his eyes and sighs. “Don’t tell me you’re still saving yourself for Peggy Carter.” He can’t possibly still be holding a torch for her after nearly a decade of little to no contact.
“Then you would have perished long ago,” Bacchus interjects, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth despite the grim circumstances. “I did not have the heart to tell you, but I suppose if this is our last confessional and we are to be honest with each other… You were a disaster with the net. The shield and sword suit you much better.”
“Oh.” In hindsight, that explained why she kept mentioning needing to refresh her drink or be literally anywhere else, and Tony had followed her around like a lost, exceptionally-clueless puppy. Perhaps his audience wasn’t even as charmed as he had imagined they were and were silently wishing he’d just shut up, but he couldn’t take a hint. He had wanted to fit in and instead had come off as some weirdo with boundary issues, hadn’t he?
Tony thinks frantically. He pushes back against the wall, trying to buck off Steve, but when that doesn’t work, he starts to cough around the fingers still in his mouth.
An unfamiliar fire sparks within Stefanus, low in his belly, growing until it consumes his entire being with want, with a singular desire centered on the wonderful man before him. It’s different than what he had felt for the prostitutes that regularly visited the barracks, the attraction that drew his gaze and tempted him to open up his coin purse for an hour of distraction that did not originate from his own left hand. He had thought that had been the extent of desire, but it was an anemic facsimile of this burning all-consuming need that now engulfed him.
Antony can only laugh. “Julia was a gift,” but Stefanus can tell he is pleased nonetheless at the turn of events.
“I thought it was the staff. Didn’t expect our visitor to push past me into the room.” Tony throws him his clothing from the floor. “Now get dressed and finish packing, we have a long day ahead of us.”
to advertise our plans in advance. In short, I was determined not to repeat that mistake with my husband, and Captain America… Steve, he understands. He knew Tasha and has been there for me every step of the way.”
“Hey, you mind if I…” Steve takes out a pack of cigarettes from his pack, tapping one loose. “They’re prescription. For my asthma.”
“I don’t mean to imply anything. I’m sure we’re good, but if we could go to the clinic first, and maybe get tested…”
Stark seems to reconsider his statement. “I didn’t mean that,” he says, “I know you’ve lost, you’ve suffered, and grief isn’t a contest.” He momentarily pauses, withdrawing from the bowels of the ruined ship to turn and lean against its hull, sliding down to the dust. “It’s just… we made mistakes, but we had just gotten it back. Mandalore, that is. The rebels won with the Republic’s backing, and now that same Republic has betrayed us.”
“I can’t… I’m not like you,” Steve tells him forcefully, turning to face him. “It’s easy for you to say that because you’re Tony Stark: hedonistic billionaire extraordinaire. People expect you to sleep around. But Captain America… Captain America comes with different expectations, a higher standard of behavior.”
Two weeks to end war, to end famine, to crush any opposition to their all-consuming power. They provide free energy, security, and are working down the list towards social equality. Everyone is happy; everyone is safe in a purple haze of contentment and unquestioning loyalty to Emperor Stark and his right hand man, the power behind the throne.
Tony leaps over the back of the couch, dropping into the end seat next to Steve sitting in the middle. “Come on.
“I was thinking of adding canons, maybe some missiles, give the suit a little more oomph, if you know what I mean,” he says, the wiggle of his fingers mirrored by the Mark LIII. “Just imagine it, Cap; all that firepower dancing at the tips of my itchy fingers.” One bad day away from total destruction.
“What did you do?” he asks, the minute they’re alone in Antony’s bedchambers. “What did you do to Ignatius?”
He barely hears Antony tell him “I will show you I can please you better than Bacchus” through the white noise in his mind. He doesn’t even react when he feels a wet mouth engulf his cock, sliding up and down his burgeoning erection. His vision blurs, and then the feeling is gone, and Antony’s unfocused face invades the periphery.
“The mission. I’d like you to take it more seriously,” Steve says, voice gruff but still more gentle than he had anticipated five minutes prior.
Bucky must see the truth of the situation on his friend’s face, because he tries to backtrack. “Well, maybe it doesn’t mean anything, you know. It could have– well, maybe the unicorn… died?” he finishes lamely.
“You’re going to tell me where you’re keeping Tony,” he demands, adjusting his hold to allow the man to speak while still keeping him steady.
Hadrianus sponsors the next Gladiatorial Games to boost his popularity, hiring Priscus’s ludus to supply gladiators and choosing Stefanus to fight a highly-successful retiarius for the main bout. Antony worries his father will take the opportunity to execute Stefanus and arranges for his seasoned competitor to be unavailable.
“What I should have done is gone with you today,” Steve says. “I left you alone. That was unwise and outside mission parameters.”
Though much too late to fool anyone, Steve quickly plops back into his bed, rolls on his side away from the door, and pulls the covers up to his neck, feigning sleep.
“It’s Bruce Campbell,” Tony counters. “Did you see his abs? I want to know that guy’s workout routine. He looks almost as good as you.”
Tony does go inside, but he refuses to divulge the cause of Steve’s exit. Rhodey is already aware of his sexual proclivities, but he knows nothing of Steve’s.
Can’t Cap see Tony is doing this for his own good? He’s trying to be noble, damn it. This is the one thing he can do for Steve to ease his burden, and here the man is trying to ruin it with good intentions.
Stefanus and Bacchus circle each other, alternately charging and retreating as necessary. There is a jab, a block, then parry, and back again. Stefanus stepping in close with his sword as Bacchus falls back, trying to keep his distance, to ready the net. They have practiced these moves thousands of times before. Stefanus knows his every move, his every tell, but Bacchus also knows his as well. He sees the feint and blocks the strike with his shield, his senses on high alert. For several tense minutes, they continue, neither gaining ground on the other as they exchange blows, try to find and exploit a flaw in their defenses. It is the way of the retiarii, to bid their time, to dance just outside the radius of danger as their opponents tire under the weight of their armor. Stefanus knows he has to end it soon; he just needs–
The last thing Tony needs is commitment. He can’t even commit to a regular sleep schedule, much less a whole other human being.
Tony is still dictating his movements. “I am now walking towards the parlor, and…” he rounds the corner, his tense shoulders visibly relaxing at the downright domesticity of the scene before him. “And good. You haven’t killed each other.”
“Hadrianus is running for re-election, and he believes it is my duty to show my face at such events,” he admits. “I can be charming in small doses, but most find me tiresome after a while. Outside of Romulus – he is an old friend from the academy – I do not get on with most people. Should we continue our… arrangement, you may find yourself growing weary of my various eccentricities as well.” There’s a pause there where Antony must expect his companion to protest, but when Stefanus stays silent, he continues, “Would you like that? If I were to extend our arrangement?”
The child – Rogers – hits him alright. His form is weak and his fist inexpert, not enough to do any proper damage on its own, but the Force behind it packs a wallop, causing his opponent to practically fly across the street and land unceremoniously on his back, wheezing and winded.
Steve captures Tony’s hands then spins him around to plant them on the wall as he pushes Tony’s chest up against the cool surface and plunges in with one smooth thrust. It’s too much too soon. Tony grunts in pain and his body clenches, seizing up against Cap, trapped as he is between the man’s bulk and the cold cement. To Tony’s disappointment, Steve stops at the show of pain and gently tries to withdraw, the hands on his wrists loosening, caressing the skin there in an almost-soothing fashion.
After the money and product have changed hands, and he’s walking away, his companion Master Erskine informs him, “You could have talked him down to sixty-five.”
“Is it always like this with you?” Antony whispers in the dark. He’s lying on his side, one arm thrown over Stefanus’s middle, cradling him close.
Tony notices more of the divergence between Steve at home and Steve with the boys, the facets of his personality he displays and exaggerates in each situation, and he can’t right tell which is closer to the truth or why it matters so much to him. Perhaps Tony has always been greedy, because he wants all of Steve. He wants to know the real Steve behind all his masks, to be the one with whom he can be his true self, but the longer he knows the boy, the more he realizes that maybe Steve is right. None of them are one thing to everyone; even Tony modifies his behavior based on company. Perhaps Tony doesn’t understand who he is either.
“Your body language is more honest this way.” Bacchus sees an opening, aiming his false trident to spear his knee. “…And had this bout been real, you’d be crippled, possibly dead.”
He straps on the shield, sliding into a defensive stance. “J.A.R.V.I.S.? Resume the training session.”
(1) Bruce is a man whose alter ego could theoretically go toe-to-toe with Cap himself, making him the best male option next to Thor, who had returned to Asgard and is thus unavailable.
Steve looks dubious, but he doesn’t call Tony out on his transparent lie. “Oh-kay… so, um… what’s there to do around here?”
And now Antony sounds deflated. “You hate it, don’t you?” He reaches out to take back the offending gift. “I’ll get you something else, something–”
Reminder that this story takes place from 1981 through roughly 1992, during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. People were terrified of catching HIV to the point where they avoided even casual contact with HIV-positive or potentially positive (e.g. gay male) individuals.
Purple Man’s voice drops low. “You’re trying to resist me, aren’t you? No one can resist me at this range,” he says, hovering just behind Tony by his ear so as to not obstruct his view of Captain Rogers. “It’s not like I’m even getting anything out of this. This is all for you. I’ve seen how you look at him, so don’t pretend you don’t want him on my account. Just think of this as a reward for all your hard work.”
“To Aemilius,” Stefanus agrees, tapping his cup against Bacchus’s with a dull clink. He drains the contents completely only for Bacchus to refill it anew.
A ‘regard’ was a bonus paid to the leader of the retinue, in this case Bucky, that was split amongst himself and the men to pay for their armor, horses, and other equipment.
But the woman is persistent. “Hmmm.. yes, you said that, but it seems to me that a woman wouldn’t neglect her husband so soon after their nuptials unless there was trouble in paradise.” She looks at him through the curtain of her lashes. “We could go somewhere a little more… private, if you want to tell me all about it.”
Tony can only roll up the copy of the engraving, stowing it away in its leather storage tube with a snap.
Vernae: A slave born in a household or on an agricultural estate. They had no legal fathers but were sometimes the children of free men, possibly their master (dominus). Vernae were typically treated better than other slaves, and there was more of a social obligation to take care of them.
Steve crouches in the grass and peers through binoculars to assess the target: a dilapidated Home Depot in the middle distance, a large S.O.S. comprised of weighed-down faded orange buckets peeking out of an overgrown rooftop garden. He lowers his gaze to view the front entrance, clearly barred from the inside, wooden slats clearly visible through the shattered sliding doors. The parking lot is full of copious amounts of immobile desiccated zombies, having long dried out in the California sun. A few still amble around aimlessly, stumbling between busted-up cars and the corpses of their brethren.
Steve’s vision narrows; he feels dizzy, and there’s suddenly not enough air, and Tony? Tony is still talking. Why is he still talking?
Steve grasps either end of the towel, pulling it taut across the back of his neck. He shrugs. “You’re looking mighty sore, and I’m just saying, you could have made it happen if you focused on one.”
“They will forget within a matter of days,” Antony replies, pulling away, “especially after I do this.” He turns back to the crowd, holding his fist up for silence. It takes a while, for the cries to crest then abate until there is only a low rumbling of discontent.
They’re talking in circles with Stefanus unwilling to commit to a response one way or the other, much to Antony’s frustration.
Master Phillips massages his temple as if to stave off a headache. “Right. And what about his size?”
“You have no authority to grant the rudis,” Hadrianus admonishes him, his face tight and drawn into a deep scowl of disapproval and disappointment.
He draws back, his eye on the target, then he lets the arrow fly, executing a perfectly-centered bullseye.
“Did you remember to bring the goat?” Tony asks Steve for what has to be the third time on their drive from the City to rural Pennsylvania. He cranes his neck, peering through the dusty back window into the pickup bed to ensure the goat is still harnessed and tethered in the back of their rented truck.
“I will choose to ignore that. Let’s call it generosity of spirit,” Dr. Pym replies, his tone stern as he reiterates, “After school. My classroom.”
The man is whistling an ambling tune Clint doesn’t recognize as he stands at the stove flipping the last of a stack of pancakes. “Sure did.”
love with him. He might be fond of Tony, sure, and very very fond of his ass. They are sort of a package deal, so it makes sense that Steve is somewhat invested in Tony’s survival.
It doesn’t matter either way, but with nothing better to do before Stark’s friend Rhodey picks them up, Steve finds himself curious about his companion.
“Obviously,” Steve repeats, hooking his arm around a clone to swing and take him down while sweeping another one off his feet and stabbing him through. He rolls onto his feet back into a fighting stance, his lightsaber drawn as he arcs it in a figure-8 to block more enemy fire.
And so, he cuddles up next to Steve, faced away so Steve can kiss the back of his neck and along the plane of his shoulder.
“Okay, we need to break it down. Be careful; they might be scared and armed, which is never a good combination,” he warns the others.
“Mm hm.” She scratches something else down. “Do you often use humor to derail uncomfortable conversations?”
“We’re not… we’re not your puppets,” Stark says, even as he slips a slick finger into Rogers’s ass and begins to pump in and out. Rogers fidgets but remains silent as commanded.
But the Mandalorian only holsters his blaster. “That’s not my mission. I wasn’t hired to take you out.”
“Tony, you should pay attention,” Howard had interjected. “Your mother and I rarely see you these days, and we’d prefer you be present when possible.”
It could have been avoided entirely if not for his affair with Antony, Stefanus thinks bitterly, but he tells Bacchus instead, “I wish it did not have to be so. Perhaps if I had stayed a retiarius–”
Master Erskine hums, leaning forward, observing the boy with a critical eye. “He is so much bigger than you. You must have known you couldn’t win.”
The search for Atlantis had been their last case, the very last installment of Tony Stark Adventures for “Marvels: A Magazine of Men’s Adventure.” After Munsey’s death, Pepper’s kidnapping, and Rhodey’s retirement, Tony had contemplated the price of his recklessness and finally accepted he would never find the cure for his affliction, for the mechanical heart beating in his chest. As a result, he had cancelled this personal undertaking to focus on more important ventures of international importance, or so he had told the reporters swarming his hospital bed. On the record, naturally.
The look on the man’s face is almost worth the two-hour refresher course on S.H.I.E.L.D.’s sexual harassment policy.
And so Purple Man reclines onto his cot, his arms folded behind his head, and laughs and laughs and laughs.
“I know you know,” Tony lies. “I’m just saying it so it’s out there. None of that unspoken crap, because we’re men, and men don’t do that.”
Clint would normally call bullshit, only… Steve looks so ashamed that the whole fiasco had been a result of a childish bet rather than the vastly-more-respectable explanation of bed-busting sex.
“And I do not.” Tiberius drops his chin, turning away entirely. “Did you not hear what I said? It is uncomfortable for me. I would like to continue kissing you, but if you cannot do this one little thing–”
“Hey Winghead! Catch!” Tony tosses Steve a minifigure painted in the likeness of Captain America. “I thought since he’s going to be more-or-less a permanent fixture of the Avengers, he should at least look like himself.”
“Translation is more an art than a science. This will be something for scholars to puzzle over for generations after we–”
“What do you think of taking a day trip to Kho Tao?” Tony says as he tries to show Steve some promotional material on his StarkPad. “We could go scuba diving.”
Steve grabs the receiver, switching to channel SR107BB, where a message is already transmitting in intergalactic standard, the same word over and over.
There’s rustling as Bacchus carefully rearranges his own bonds and flips sides so that his head is closest to Suibne’s feet. “Where are you from, Sheev-na?” he murmurs in the dark. When Suibne doesn’t answer, he prattles on. “I hail from a villa in the countryside. Born and raised. A vernae is what I was. Before.” He hears Bacchus shift onto his side. “Do you know what a vernae is?”
“So, not that I don’t love a good fight, but you want to maybe get out of here before the cavalry arrives?” he offers, tipping his head south. “My ship is a couple klicks that way. I can have you off planet and on Tython in a matter of days.”
Tatooine will sooner flood and freeze over than Master Phillips agree that Steve is ready. After all, he had never taken to the (not-so-)young padawan. From the very first day Master Erskine and he had picked him up from Pax at the ripe age of six, Master Phillips had deemed him unworthy of the robe and saber of a true Jedi. Steve isn’t entirely sure why he took him in as his padawan after Master Erskine’s death, but he thought it likely that the old bastard did it in order to hold Steve back, to keep him from so much as attempting the Jedi Trials and becoming a knight in his own right.
“Yeah and now I’m asking Tony!” Steve pushes him back, nearly kicking him off entirely. He flips around on his belly to look up at the love of his life. “Tony, I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.” Dracula is on him again as they tussle across the floor, knocking over various knick knacks on the side table, until Steve is able to place him in an arm lock as Dracula spits and hisses, trying to break his hold. Steve grunts at the exertion. “Will… will you… marry… me?”
Tony looks Steve in the eye, his line of sight hovering a good six inches higher than he had anticipated. “You grew,” he says after a beat.
Tony thinks the same moment he replies, “Yeah, it was hard, but I got through it. Got the chip to prove it, too.” Their conversation is too stilted and awkward, more so than it has ever been between them. “So, I thought I’d ring you up and let you know that.”
Stefanus spills him across the bed, each stripping off the remainder of their clothing until he is nude and hovering over Antony with Antony’s thighs spread wide to accommodate him. Their lips meet once more, and then there are no more words between them.
“Oh, you know how it is. Work hard; play hard,” Tony had replied flippantly, being purposely vague as he redirects the conversation back on Steve. “How’re things on your end? Did Bucky ever get around to teaching you how to fight?”
And now Tony just looks miserable, so Steve stops, retracting his hand only for Tony to dart out and hold on.
“…Are you really using that ‘old man’ excuse again?” Steve isn’t even that old, physically-speaking.
Tony isn’t sure why. Carol sounds great. An ambitious ace pilot with a bright future in the Air Force; what more can Rhodey’s parents ask for? “I’m sure they’ll love her–”
The others groan when Dum Dum approaches with Steve in tow, his long-standing reputation having preceded him, having lost the thrower and his ilk more shillings than they cared to admit in their time together.
“You can never have too many missiles,” he says. He pats Tony’s shoulder when the guy pauses outside his locker, and then he’s off to the next period.
Instead of pushing him off entirely, the guy grabs his shoulders and holds him at arm’s length. “In high school?”
“You really don’t know?” And now Bucky sounds confused. “Only virgins attract unicorns, and if Stark’s unicorn is missing…” he lets the implication hang between them.
Tony looks at his mostly empty glass. “I’m still working on this one. Perhaps if you get me a Coke instead…”
Tony is at his wit’s end. “Don’t tell me we’ve fucked too, and you want to ‘rekindle our romance.’” He doesn’t even remember the guy behind the bar, and he usually remembers all his sexual partners, except for the ones that happened to be masked at the time, and the man doesn’t seem the type to be invited to that sort of event.
“If we are to be family, we must learn to trust each other, Steven. So, until further notice, I will trust you not to harm my son, and as long as you can manage that task, nothing… untoward will befall you,” Dracula insinuates before making his threat more explicit. “Make him happy or else.”
Antony can’t believe it. Hadrianus had ridiculed Caesar for doing exactly the same thing when Antony was but a child. “Mother has been dead for over twenty years.”
Steve draws his lightsaber, and tosses off the first saber cat with a forceful wave of his hand. That draws the attention of the remaining two, who growl at the intruder, unwilling to relinquish their prey.
He leans into Tony, kissing him fully, gently pushing him into the mattress as he strokes his partial erection and nudges his knees apart with his leg.
Another boy with long brown hair done up in a messy bun walks up to the duo to stand between them, snapping, “Oh shut up, Hodge. I heard you’re only here ‘cause your Dad donated a dormitory wing to the Academy.”
“No need to play coy. There are guards enough outside; we will not be disturbed.” It is a warning wrapped up in a promise of privacy, as if someone walking in on them is Suibne’s only concern. “Now, would you like a cup of wine? A braised tongue of flamingo perhaps?”
