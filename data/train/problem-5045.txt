Dean was standing over a pot on the stove stirring what could only be chili. One of the things Dean could make that Cas had yet to be able to duplicate.
“You should have picked a better spot to circle then huh?” Sam smirked at his brothers complaining. There was no heat behind any of it. This was more like a pre-trip ritual. One of them would complain the entire time before they got on the road. They would drive a little make a pit stop and load up on snacks which would cause another debate.
Gabriel is leaned against the hood of his car, sucker in his mouth and his arms folded across his chest when the bus pulls up. Castiel gets off and retrieves his bags, without a word, just a shared glance the brothers get in the car.
When they got in the car Sam insisted on driving, he needed to be distracted from all the tension in the car, and he had to make sure they ended up in the right place. He had his own secret, they weren’t going for a tour of Chocolate World, he’d gotten them tickets to make their own chocolate bars. His own way of saying thank you to Castiel for their awesome rooms.
to go home. All I see is how these are not the people I love. These are shells with a few facts and fabricated personalities. I’m going home.” Castiel marched toward the front door of the beach house.
“Castiel”
Charlie sent a text to Gabriel saying she had Cas and was going to take him with her to the mall while he handled the issue back at the apartment.
*$*$*$*$*
*$*$*$*$*
Castiel raised his eyebrow in question tilting his head in the process. “I’m not exactly sure what you’re trying to say, Dean.” Castiel wasn’t exactly well-known at the school, he kept to himself did his work and generally did his best to blend into the background and go unnoticed. “I don’t know who you think I’ll tell.”
To Sam and everyone around them it was so obvious how they both pined for each other. Neither believing that the other could ever actually be interested. Dean still had issues about being an omega because of all the hateful things their father used to say. Castiel being the peaceful and quiet alpha that he was made him less-than in the eyes of his family and therefore had so many self-confidence issues the two of them could right a book.“I know for a fact, that Cas is not working over break and has no plans, Dean.” Sam stood up aimed once again for the map.
category.
“Cas!! The barbeque is tomorrow, and it just won't be the same without you….or your potato salad. You see for mine I put a little dry mustard, celery seed, red onion….white onion??....“ Jess was spending her day with Cas since she had everything planned and he was the only other person she could talk to about the baby.
Cas sat back and thought about his life. Everything was coming together. Everybody would be at the party in two weeks, meaning he wouldn’t have to worry about anyone showing up at the hospital.
Cas had a trying day working the helpdesk; it was like every freshman in the department managed to come up with the most rudimentary issues for him to solve. As irritating as they could be, Cas was grateful for his mind being kept busy. If not, he’d be forced to think over Gabriels words. Maybe even be forced into action because of them
“WHAT THE HELL IS THAT NOISE?!?!?!?” A severely hungover and disheveled Castiel appeared in his doorway looking like he was an android set on destroy. “I don’t ask for much Dean, but if you don’t turn that shit off NOW I will break it into tiny pieces and feed them to you!!!” Castiels eyes and scent agreed with the sentiment causing Dean to practically long jump to his stereo and turn it off. “ I don’t complain when I come home, and there's a crowd of people in the house! I don’t complain when I can't sleep through the night cause some girl you’ve got makes it her mission to break the sound barrier, but
“The princess is all clean and ready. Go ahead and start the movie, I need to put on something….dry.” Castiel couldn’t help but laugh at his husband. He’d learned long ago that Claire took baths like splashing was an Olympic sport and she was going for the gold.
Castiel sat in the chair across from him and placed a sketchbook on the table between them.
“A bee documentary….and are those honey cakes from your new favorite bakery? I feel like there is an ulterior motive here Dean…” Cas smirked back at his husband. “Nope, not at all Cas, I just made a promise to myself ever since……
“Home sweet home.” Dean held open the door and assisted Cas to the couch.
Almost immediately after Dean slid the cover back into place, Cas threw his body into Deans' arms.
"Hey guys!!! I didn't expect to see you here tonight" Jo smiled at Cas and winked at Dean as she sat down their drinks.
If they answered the question honestly the other would instantly jump in and tell them everything wonderful about the other and once that ball got rolling…..there was a real chance of admitted feelings.
Castiel sat down and let his mind go blank. Once a week he had to design a new piece, with the promise that he would eventually make these creations for Pam to sample.  This week's creation turned out to be a
Dean gestured over his shoulder pointing at the Hershey kiss shaped street lights in growing smaller behind them.
“Ok, Cas.” Sam got up and walked out of the room, he desperately needed coffee and time to wrap his mind around it all.
“That’s easy, the day I got my baby. It had been rebuilt from the frame and I was finally allowed to drive it. That was the one day I didn’t mind waking up early. I remember I cruised down the road and pulled up next to Cas here,” Dean gestured over at Cas.” He was walking and I picked him up. He was the first person I let get into Baby.” Dean let his memories take him back to that sunny day.
“I have to admit I came here for more than just checking up on you Castiel. I..um...Dean asked me..” Sam hesitated because he was not used to lying for his brother anymore meaning Castiel could instantly see through him like a screen door. Castiel arched his eyebrow like a disapproving parent and Sam crumbled like tissue paper in the rain. “Look, I’m here because Dean is seeing someone….a professional. And she wants to have him bring the kids to a session, but to do that we need your permission since...yeah.” Sam looked anywhere but at Castiels face. It's not that he was embarrassed by the request but he wanted to let him go through the emotions of realizing that not only had Dean actually spoken to a therapist but that clearly some progress was being made.
“Deal”
“Where in the hell is he?!?!” It was one of the alphas searching for Cas, they still hadn’t managed to find him and it was almost time for sunset. That wasn’t the only angry alpha Gabe had stumbled upon in his search for his brother. When the sun was fully down all the alphas started heading for the tree line, each looking a little more dejected than the last. Gabe slipped out of the woods and back into the crowd unnoticed. Once again he saw Sam stroll away with that smug grin on his face.
“Becky…”
“He could die because of you!!” The rage and fury that burned in Sams' eyes was something that Dean had never seen before. Sam had always been the understanding one. The one who always believed in second chances, always controlling your emotions and not letting them control you. If Dean had broken even him…..was there even hope that it could be fixed?
“I cant lose him, and if he can keep something like this from me….then I’ve already started to…I…” Dean trailed off as his voice left him.
A 5 o’clock meeting meant another late night. He’d have to put off finishing the paperwork until after just to make sure he didn’t miss anything. Dean made a mental note to let Cas know that he wouldn’t be making dinner, so he should go ahead and eat without him. Which now that he thinks about it…. had been happening a lot lately. He shrugged, at least this time he was giving him notice instead of having Cas probably wait around. Cas could appreciate the heads up this time at least.
“Don’t worry about it Samsquatch, I’ve got it all taken care of. You said you were only giving me this one chance, so I left nothing to chance.”
“Don’t worry Cher, we’ll get you all settled in and I’ll bring you some of that honeyed toast you seem to like so much.” The nurse whispered as he walked down the corridor. Cas looked up at that moment finally responding to the outside world.
“Oh, did you really think I didn’t know? It’s my job to know everything about everyone. That’s how I’ve grown to be so successful Dean. The world survives on secrets. ” Ramiel punched a code into the pad on the wall and the glass door swung open. He sauntered in and slowly circled Dean still bound in the chair. “ My most favorite of secrets of yours, however, is that delicious husband of yours.” Dean tensed up in his chair. Not Cas, he couldn’t let his family suffer for his poor decisions. “Now, be a good boy and sign here on the dotted line. I’ve already got an assignment waiting for you.”
Then ran off to play with his little brother in their yard“ Castiel answered the question without looking over at his counterpart. He highly doubted that Dean even remembered that day.
Castiel began to have so many mood swings even a hormonal teenage girl would’ve told him he needed to just chill out for a second.
“WHAT THE F—“ Deans entire body jerked and he immediately sat up. Jess had been trying to adjust the blanket on him that he kicked off in his sleep. Dean looked at her like she was about to smother him in his sleep. “Geeze Dean calm down, you got tangled in the blanket. I was trying to help you out. “ Jess rolled her eyes and made her way back to the kitchen where she was prepping a pot roast for the oven.
Castiel smiled for the first time in the last two days. “Gabe I need you to do me a favor, a couple of favors actually.”
“Hello Castiel, I didn’t know you were working the help desk today.” Hannah strolled up and leaned over the desk tracing her finger over the pen he held in his hand.
“Lucky the elf whats your favorite color?”
run that Dean declared his intentions to Castiel.
“Get dumped or majorly screw up? Names Cain by the way.” Cain signaled the bartender ordered an old fashioned.
“That is a good thing. He’s breathing on his own now. He’s a fighter. The more autonomous behavior, the more he is waking up. Small steps. But this is good news.” Sam couldn’t hold back he wrapped his arms around the nurse and just cried.
Dean was so lost in his own fantasy that he hadn’t noticed Cas wasn’t even standing in front of him anymore, but had moved to the couch and was asking about his day. Thank goodness for that because the kitchen was slowly being taken over by omega arousal instead of the dessert in the oven.
“Okay buddy, you have a deal…IF I can add 2 more carrot sticks to the pile.”
The shifting blanket was the only response she got. That was enough.
“So umm… Cas I know we said we trust you with the directions in all, but I’m pretty sure we passed Hershey Park back there.”
“Ugh, I knew you weren’t listening, finish your coffee and have a donut before we talk about it. You’re not really present until you’re properly caffeinated and had some sugar first thing in the morning, worse than a teenager.” Charlie called over her shoulder not so subtly rolling her eyes.
Dean strolled up behind him wrapping his arms around his waist.
Charlie kept him occupied with conversation until she received a text that Dean and Sam had just pulled up in the parking lot. She cued up the signal and set the plan fully into motion
It was an early Saturday morning. They both were awake at the ungodly hour of 5 am because Castiel had reached the impossible to be comfortable stage in his pregnancy. It happened faster than he expected because there were two babies in there but still he was allowed to be a little upset about it. At least while they were both awake, there was time to discuss the important things, like baby names.
Ninety-percent of the house was in boxes.
“Papa?“
“we both know you did great and got the job. Now we’re going to celebrate. I also have some good news to celebrate so have a seat and let me be all domestic. It’s a rare occasion so you better enjoy it while you can.” Dean pushed Castiel towards his seat.
“Back with us? Good, get up I have a hard workout planned for you today.” Pam turned and walked out of the room not waiting for any kind of verbal acknowledgment. She walked away confidently, Castiel absent-mindedly wondered, how did she know that would work? No warnings, no gentle shoulder shakes. Whatever he needed dry clothes and apparently todays session was going to be gruesome.
“Seems to me it might not be as hard as you’re making it out to be.” Cain squeezed Deans shoulder for a grounding moment and walked away.
“I was in town on business and I decided to stop by and check in on our friend here, gotta make sure to keep his spirits up.” Cain gave Jess a smile as he continued on his way. “Hmm..that was weird don’t you think?” Sam looked over at Jess wondering if she got the same vibe that he did. Jess waved at a few nurses before she answered: “Not at all, everybody loves Cas, there’s always somebody visiting him these days.” “Yea he is a popular one.” Missouri chimed in from behind them causing Sam to jump. He always swore that woman was magic in some way, but never said it aloud. Missouri was the only woman Sam feared as much as Ellen.
“Cain? Yea it's...it's Cas… he’s got the shakes and a fever, I just ran out to the store for a second to get him more snacks.. and I came back he was like this….I….I don’t…..okay…..okay…” After his almost incoherent call, Cain was sending an ambulance for Cas, if he spiked a fever, that meant things were getting bad and Cas no longer could stay at home for his care.
“You know you don’t really have to go, Dean even said it's your trip as much as it is ours.” Sam tried to convince Castiel one last time. He could see the remorse and love in his eyes. “And yet, he can’t even be around me. Look this was supposed to be a surprise for you guys today but here.” Castiel reached into the side pocket of the duffle he was holding and pulled out two bracelets.
“So it seems that medication we gave you is no longer an option. Somehow your body decided to reject it and that increased the rate of deterioration of your kidney. Now I'm not gonna sugar coat it, this does mean we should think about more aggressive measures.”
Castiel couldn’t help but stare, but he still glanced away, keeping an eye on the kids. Dean noticed his wandering eye and smiled. “The kids are building a sand wall to protect Aidens castle, they are away from the water and safe. Plus how could you ignore this?” Dean stood up and started flexing muscles like he was part of the Mr. Universe pageant.
Lenox sat in his seat quietly taking in the argument between his sister and daddy while taking bites of his burger loaded with a little bit of everything. “
“More like a criminal accomplice,” Dean mumbled but didn’t interrupt the story of their latest adventures.
Sam and Jess weighed the desire to do anything to keep Cas alive with the potential of risking Jess and the safety of future children. Charlie would be risking her independence and freedom. She had been on her own for years and being a post-transplant donor put too many eyes on her. She’d be tracked and monitored meaning she couldn’t pick up and take off like she tended to do from time to time. Even Cain weighed the options, but his advanced age added an additional danger factor, it was possible he wouldn’t wake up due to complications with the anesthesia.
Positions already secured neither of them even gave a thought to final exams. They already were looking to the future. Plus there were more important things to think about, like how long they were going to keep the apartment and when would they finally mate.
Uncle Sam and daddy were around but clearly, they were just too busy. Daddy would cry at night after he thought they were sleeping. During the day he did what he could to help with the kids, but it seemed no matter what he did he just couldn’t seem to get used to the morning routine that papa had set up.
“Cain, I didn’t know you were here working today.” Sam paused after seeing the doctor pass him in the hallway.
Uncle Sam was around a lot more than she was used to but that was okay because when he picked them up from summer camp, he would let her play in his hair. His long wonderful hair that she could braid and put into ponytails.
“What the hell? Where is everybody? What is going on?” Dean was uneasy, to say the least. The only time this place was ever this empty was when it was closed. His inner monologue of questions was no longer on the inside the more frantic he became.
The week before his first run, he begged his family to reconsider and let him at least finish school before making him do this. Neither of his parents seemed to understand his resistance. Then again, neither of them were omegas. His dad Chuck was a beta and had no idea about any of it as he had come from some hippy community in California, his mother, Naomi was pure alpha. Naomi had been taught from childhood that omegas needed an alpha to control them and train them. Once she had convinced Chuck, there was nothing Cas could do.
“Hello Hannah, I decided to pick up a few more hours to get more experience as well as help guide young students such as yourself.” Castiel looked up with nothing more than a professional smile in her direction.
“I will find some way to redeem myself to you, Dean.” The words were softly spoken as a single tear fell down his cheek. “I will find a way to redeem myself to everyone else as well.” Cas grabbed Deans hand bringing it close to his chest, the closest he can get to hugging at the moment.
“Castiel, Dean. I’m talking about Cas. We should invite him.” Sam hit Dean with his best puppy dog eyes slumped his shoulders and even sat on the bed making himself smaller than Dean in every way. Also making him look so pitiful he was impossible to resist.
“DON’T YOU EVER THREATEN MY FAMILY AGAIN!!!”
“Dean? Yea I’m here just give me a second and I’ll call you back.” Sam hung up the phone before he gave his brother a chance to respond. His patients needed his attention but he also needed a second to prepare himself for the screaming that he was about to endure. His guilt over keeping a secret from his brother had already been eating at him, now he would be forced to deal with the anger resulting from that decision.
“My umm… that’s the day I presented.” Dean blushed a little bit thinking about that day.
C: I can stay away, I don’t want to intrude
He directed the question to Missouri as he could tell the family of three were in their own little world for the time being and he would not be the one to disturb them.
“Sam ran some tests and made some calls to an old college buddy of his because he wasn’t going to tell me anything unless he was 100% sure what the results meant. One of my kidneys is starting to fail. We thought maybe we could wait for the specialist to come here since we seemed to catch it early but my legs and feet have started to swell so it was decided that I need to get to him for treatment as soon as possible. Meaning this weekend.” Cas said the words and couldn’t bear to look Dean in the eyes, he knew there would be tears and he couldn’t handle that. “I still hadn’t said anything because it just felt like it had been a secret for too long, Dean I….I’m sorry.” The tears hit the table below Cas betraying his unwavering voice.
“Hey, Charlie, or should I be bowing to the queen?” Dean caught Charlie as she is on her way out of the door talking with a friend.
“Yea, you can call.” Castiel shrugged his shoulder and reclaimed his position in a ball under a mound of blankets, that was all the energy for interaction he had for the day. It didn’t matter if she had more to say, he was done. He’d given her permission to sign him up to be a part of the
Sam stood there for a moment and contemplated his options. If these two could just get some time together away from it all, things inevitably would fall into place.
When he pulled up to the house he steeled himself for the conversation ahead. Charlie had only told him that Cas was sick, she hadn’t said what actually was going on. Dean walked in the door trying to stay quiet, a nice surprise lunch and flowers were way less than what Castiel deserved but it was a start to the endless doting that Dean would be doing from this point forward. He peaked into the bedroom to see if Cas was there, only to find a half packed suitcase on the bed.
“Dean?” She followed him into his office and shut the door. “Earth to Dean” She tried again this time waving a hand in front of his face snapping him out of his zombie state.
“Claire leave daddy alone! You gotta eat your breakfast! Uncle Sam will be here to pick us up soon.” Aiden’s voice echoed out of the kitchen where he was putting a sandwich into her backpack.
“So tell me about this conversation between you and Charlie.” Cas tried to keep the mood light, maybe she hadn’t given up the secret and it was something else. Deans shoulders noticeably slumped as he sat the sandwich and a glass of strawberry milk in front of Cas.
Castiel got home that night to an empty house and a note left on the counter from Sam that the kids requested a sleepover. This was the final sign he needed.
*****
“Hey Cas, I brought you something” Dean strolled through the door with doctor-approved treats in hand. He glanced over at the tv noticing yet another documentary about butterflies playing. There was no way this was a new one so Cas probably had already memorized every fact by now since he didn’t have the sound on.
“Oh cool, Cas.” Sam chimed up from the backseat.
“I’m working on my thesis. I’d appreciate it if you left me alone.” Cas glanced up over the edge of the laptop just long enough to make sure Dean was witness to the soul burning glare then returned to his work.
They don't need him around and will do so much better without him.
There was one auto shop just outside of downtown that Dean really hoped did call. He’d gotten a chance to speak with the owner and had an interview on the spot. A real down to earth guy that just loved to work on cars. The man was in a pair of greasy overalls and elbow deep in the engine of a ford classic. He eyed Dean while they talked about his experience and availability. There were a few trick questions that were tossed out and he easily caught them all. Minor things like attributing parts to cars where they didn’t belong or mentioning the wrong fix for the problem described. Dean didn’t feel bad about making the corrections when he noticed the slight smirk on the owner's face, clearly, he’d just passed a test. Not only did he prove that he knew cars, but he also proved that he wasn’t just a ‘yes man’ and could speak up when needed.
Gabriel was still in shock but his scent broadcasted his joy.
why?” Deans emerald eyes glistened with unshed tears.
Dean walked in the house floating high in the clouds. He was beyond excited to be home before the sun went down. The meeting with the police chief had gone amazingly well. Apparently, he had fixed a car for the police chiefs son-in-law and had done such a good job between the car and customer service that on his recommendation alone they decided to give the shop the contract to fix all the police cruisers for the city.  Yea it would mean more work, but it was a sign that he was doing something right. He'd hire a few more people and it would all work out.
“Thank you for your honesty, now Castiel this time you lift the lid and reveal your prize.” Charlie nodded for him to proceed.
She was sworn to secrecy but watching Dean fall apart in front of her eyes broke her resolve. She couldn’t let him fall apart like this, knowing the only reason Cas kept him in the dark was a failed attempt to keep from stressing him.
“Dean”
“Cas I’m home!” Dean called out as if their apartment was huge. There was no answer, so he started to search. What he found was his mate already passed out in the bed with a bowl of green tea ice cream next to him. The moment was too precious to interrupt but he moved the bowl out of the way and draped a blanket across Cas and went back to the living room for a beer.
Dean chuckled putting his sister at ease, “I was going to ask you to do it anyway, you just beat me to the punch. I’m gonna get changed, which car is mine?” Dean sauntered off towards the locker room so he could put on his blue jumpsuit and start working on cars.
“Just a few more lines of code and a door code and we’ll be golden.” Charlie’s fiery hair was pinned up and she had a pencil clenched in her teeth. Gabriel glanced over to realize she was in fact not working but playing some RPG and losing the battle.
Finally getting everyone in the car with a hot cup of coffee, he’s bombarded with fate forcing him to feel.
“Castiel I’m here for my shift at the desk.” A young man with brown hair stepped behind the desk only leaving enough room for Castiel to slip by. “Eli, you’re a little early, I wasn’t quite expecting you yet.” Castiel gathered up his belongings and relinquished control of the computer at the desk. “Fair warning, it seems to be Murphy's law type of day for the freshman.” With his last comment, Castiel pat Eli on the back and walked in the direction of the parking lot. He was not going to question being set free early.
Castiel decided one night he needed to be proactive about his own possible future. Researching places that they have previously lived, instantly deciding they weren’t moving back to the Midwest, both the children seemed to be happiest when they lived on the coast. Either side of the country had the promise of decent employment and friends they’d previously left behind so he wouldn’t be without some sort of support system.
“Yea that sounds like a plan Dean except Cas is booking himself a ticket home on the bus and leaving because he ‘
They spent time at the zoo. Aiden was enamored with the alpaca and the alpaca with him. Claire went crazy for all the tiny monkeys. He sat back and watched her run back and forth in front of the enclosure for at least 20 minutes. Almost as if they had been friends since birth.
“Hey, babe you wanna go to our favorite spot and get you those maple bacon donuts that you love so much?” Dean was crouched next to the chair, skin glistening in the sun. His freckles stood out in his perfect golden tan.
“Really Gabe that’s what you got for me? Well you already know that third one is more your style than mine, and I refuse to mate anyone that mom and dad approve of, they’re still in denial that I like guys.” Cas realized as he was giving reasons for each of his brothers’ suggestions, he’d really only left himself with two options, step up or step out of the way. Both were equally intimidating for different reasons.
The phone rang and rang and eventually went to the voicemail. Deans heart sank, what if this was the last time he heard his husbands voice? A recording, a cold impersonal recording.
“Look at him Sam just look at him! This is what's best!” Dean yelled back. They both were clearly under the impression that he was still asleep. Castiel decided to keep his eyes closed so he wouldn’t interrupt.
as Dean would’ve said.
“I’m sure he would greatly appreciate it. Since you’ll be seeing him today to drop it off, I assume, can you also inform him that he has all of next week off?” Charlie was putting the finishing touches on the new schedule and sending it out to all the employees. No complaints had come back and some were even happy to work the extra hours.
going to handle it on an empty stomach.
“Cas are you sure you’re alright with this? I mean I don’t want to make you uncomfortable but I’ve been thinking about this since the last time we were here.” Dean whispered into Cas ear, keeping his tone gentle and low.
“Ummm…wheres my normal doctor? Has he decided its easier for a clean break when kicking me out if someone else does it?” Castiel shuffled his feet near the door, hesitant to actually take the seat being offered. There as no point in getting comfortable just to get the boot.
Dean jumped as he was pulled back to reality. “Aww come on Cas, don't be like that. If I left you, who would keep you company?” Flashing his million-dollar smile. “I mean don’t get me wrong, it's not like I wouldn’t rather be elbow deep in an engine right now but I know how stressed you’ve been about this paper. I figured I could come to lighten your mood.” Dean dropped his magazine on the table and switched sides taking the chair right next to Castiel
Castiel put away his bag in the back and finished off his coffee before getting right into work and making ribbon candies. Something about his hands made him perfect for pulling candy, or so that’s what the manager said when he was in his trial period. Lost in his own world working with the sweet treat this was his small piece of heaven. Working with his hands, the evidence of his exhaustion right there in front of him. Seeing the joy in childrens’ eyes when he chooses to make special shapes, sometimes there are flowers or pinwheels. His personal favorite is when he takes the time to build a bumblebee, using lemon and blueberry flavorings to match the dyes in the ribbons.
“Cas look, man, that’s, you’re putting me in a tough spot man. I mean I get it, you’re tired of the single parent life. It’s not what you signed up for and it’s not fair for the kids, but is divorce really going to fix that?” Sam just had to ask the obvious questions
“Thanks but I gotta go, Dean will be here any minute, and I’d rather not be discussing this when he walks in.
Cas stepped into his apartment to see his brother and two best friends gawking at him as if he’d just walked in wearing a sequin bikini and high heels. The day had been long enough already, Charlie and her gift obsession had worn his patience thin.
“The way you’re talking you’ve got somebody in mind, spill Sam.“ Dean crossed his arms over his chest. Sam had been clamming up on him way too much lately, and if he had to get all “big brother” on him, omega or not, then he would.
*$*$*$*$*
“Oh honey, that’s a bunch of bull and you know it. But if you’re so determined to get out of here, you can come home with me when you’re released. It would put an old womans heart at ease to know you're okay.” Castiel couldn’t argue with the last sentiments. The last thing he needed to do was add the guilt of stressing out the nurse who clearly cared for him.
When he turned back towards the library the world seemed to spin. It was the first time he’d gotten dizzy lately, but it was far from needing special attention, he’ll just keep it in mind.
Dean finally realized that forcing his daughter was going about as well as if Sam tried to stuff vegetables in his own mouth and gave up.
“Sit down and shut up boy. Castiel, your husband was admitted here last night after an attempted suicide. Your brother was the one who found him when he brought the kids home earlier than planned.”
“Cas… I…me?” Dean was at a loss for words, did Castiel really mean it? His heart couldn’t take it if this was really just a question and nothing was to come of it.
Dean looked around the place and realized he had some work to do. He began opening windows to get rid of any lingering scents, changed out the sheets on his bed and before he knew it, he was deep cleaning the entire place. Dean moved around like it was a choreographed dance, there was an apple and cranberry crumble baking in the oven, hardy loaded baked potato soup in the crock pot and the beginnings of peanut butter and jelly cookies waiting to go in the oven. The fact that these three foods were among the top of his Castiels list of favorites, the exact reason he was making them. Together or not, Dean was going to take care of Cas like a mate until the day he was pushed away for another.
. He made his favorite soup and even made a dessert other than pie, that should be enough of an apology right? But now, he’d gone and slept with Lisa, the girl he was running from when he agreed to move in with his best friend.
“Castiel?” The same sassy brunette nurse called his name. He followed her back almost on autopilot. His mind was going over every possible illness it could be. Some were worse than others, some that popped into his head were practically impossible but it would be his luck to be that one-in-a-million case you always hear about.
“Would you like to come in? Maybe share one of these treats with me? I bought more dark chocolate hot cocoa and I restocked your supply of Ring Pops.” Sam stepped to the side holding his arm out ready to escort Gabriel inside.
*$*$*$*$*
Dean tried to stay reassuring to the kids and keep up a positive front that Missouri just wanted to talk to the kids. They could tell her about anything they wanted to talk about. The kids stayed in the room with Dean while Missouri spoke with him. She was taking many things into consideration while they talked. How the kids interacted with the new environment, how they interacted with each other, and how they acted towards Dean. So many psychological things could present themselves subconsciously in a child's behavior. She was able to establish a baseline without having to say much to them at first.
Aiden just pulled his sister closer, he finally decided that adults are stupid and clearly it was his job to protect his sister.
Castiel let himself drift off. He was going to have to rebuild his life alone, he might as well be well-rested for it.
“Man, how are you friends with me and Charlie and don’t recognize Lord of the Rings? Silly alpha.” Dean started to sit up only to be yanked back down into the bed.
Get the kids up
“Up the stairs you two, now” Castiel stood at the bottom of the stairs, arms folded across his chest.
“Well, I guess we know who wins the best uncle battle.” Cas rubbed his husbands back.
“Whatever, how are we going to pay Cas back for this, cause we are way out of our league here.” Dean turned around only to realize he’d been left alone and was talking to no one. He sat on the edge of the bed and slowly sank backward. Memory foam. Dean was in love.
“Hey!!” Someone was running after them. Before he even bothered to turn around Castiel started mumbling something about leaving a decent tip, only to be silenced when he realizes that it is Dean Winchester calling after him, jogging out the door to catch him.
and less
Dean tried not to read too much into it, Cas had been really tired lately, no doubt due to his daily early wakeups.  He went about his daily routine, making a stop to pick up his morning infusion of caffeine and today Dean even went as far as picking up some donuts and bagels for everyone at the shop.
He hadn’t even thought about the fact that spring break was coming up. Its only been twice but it's been a tradition for them to spend it together. They would throw a dart at a map and have a road trip in that general direction. Whatever Sam is planning is putting an end to those plans. With a good number of people at the shop also being students, Deans got a good shot at picking up some extra hours. Less time at home is less of a chance he’ll have to face Lisa again. He never could really tell her no.
Sam was pretty sure the Roadhouse didn’t open until 5….
“Your chariot awaits my good sir.”
“Gabriel, can I ask you something?” Castiel walked into the kitchen and leaned back against the counter top. Suddenly the pattern on the floor was extremely interesting and he couldn’t meet his brother’s eyes. ”You just did bro, but sure go ahead.” Gabriel was building a massive sandwich, one that Castiel was sure they’d have to unhinge their jaws to actually eat.
*$*$*$*$*
“Umm.. not really anything is up Charlie.” Dean bumped shoulders. “I just hadn’t seen you in a little bit, I know I’ve been caught up with my own stuff I figured we could get together and catch up.” Dean had already ordered for the both of them and was glancing around praying for the waiter to come with his burger. If he had food in his mouth then he wouldn’t be able to answer the questions that were no doubt bouncing around in her head.
Thinking how good it would be to punch Dean in his perfect freckled face.
Cas walked into the waiting room feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders. Clearly, Sam was taking him out for his last meal, this was it whatever he had was terminal and he only had a matter of days left. Cas was sure of it.
“Cas?”
“Sam I think it would be best if we call it a night. I should get back to my room.” Castiel stood taking the wet cloth napkin with him. “Um.. yea you do that Cas I’ll um, I’ll see you in the morning if you’re feeling up to it.”
The taste of the pb&j in Cas mouth soured, it's amazing how guilt can turn something delicious into sand. Cas chewed slowly trying to decide his words carefully, he wasn’t ready to talk about it and he knew that wasn’t fair to Dean.
“Its time?!?! Oh!! Cas lets go!!” Grabbing his jacket and practically carrying Castiel to the car once the contractions got closer. If he broke a few speed limits in his baby he didn’t care. It was time to meet his babies.
Dean plopped down in a chair somewhere in the room, the mumbled prayers let him know that Dean was somewhere to his right.
Even with the enlarged amount of space, each run seemed to bring them closer together.
*****
“Nonsense Dean, I’m happy to do this for you.” Dean was fidgeting with the key trying to resist the blush trying to fill his cheeks. Sam had been standing there the entire time, but he might as well have been on Mars at that moment.
“Sam what the hell man.”
By the end of his speech, even Missouri had tears in her eyes.
“Hey honeybee, glad to see you decide to stay with us. My names Ellen, I’ve been your nurse since they brought you in a week ago.”
After checking in and getting the appropriate kitchen gear (aprons, hair nets) each of them was assigned to their own guide and walked through the process of making their own bar. Sam went with a simple dark chocolate bar with caramel. Castiel mixed in some peanut butter chips to his classic milk chocolate. Dean, however, tried to fit as many different things into that bar as they would let him.
*$*$*$*$*
“Sam, its all my fault, I shouldn’t have left him. Maybe if I hadn’t…..Sam what am I going to do I can’t lose him, I owe him so much.” The words barely had sound. Dean’s world was crashing down around him. It was only at this moment he truly realized how much he had taken Cas for granted. He assumed Cas would always be there, and he could leave things unsaid because there would always be time for that later.
Dean and Castiel sat in a heavy silence. Castiel looking over at his friend while Dean suddenly found the grain pattern on the bar deeply intriguing. Castiel couldn’t tell if Dean wouldn’t look up because he wanted to spare Castiel the embarrassment or if he’d finally realized that Castiel was lost on him, either way, the look on his face and the scent radiating from Dean was Castiels fault in some way.
Gabe bent down to the passenger side window “ Your shoes are in your purse.”
“Well, my sickeningly in love bro, I came to let you know that everything is set for graduation. Mom and dad are coming, I’m making your cake and we’re going out to dinner. Our other loving siblings can't make it but they send their regards and knowing them most likely there will be gifts in the mail soon.” Gabriel found his way to the kitchen and proceeded to make a mess under the guise of making lunch for both of them,
Gabriel set the coffee on a timer, perfectly. The coffee was hot and fresh, the pot maybe 5 minutes old.
********
Steeling himself for what would be the longest night of his life, Dean secured his weapons and thought over the plan. He slowly slipped into his cold and distant calculating self.
“You and I both know there are a multitude of conversations that need to be had, but I’m going to do you a favor and send everyone home. Your vitals are great, you are responding to the treatment well. You’re on your way to recovery.” Cain turned to walk to the door only then realizing that Dr. Loki had been standing there the entire time. He didn't utter a word, he wasn't even eating candy, he locked eyes with Castiel nodded his head and walked out.
Suddenly the crowd of people was gone.
When the day came to take the children with him to see Missouri Dean couldn’t stop fidgeting. He double and triple checked that he had anything and everything for them to feel comfortable. He packed spare clothes, coloring books, crayons, a few action figures, some of their favorite snacks, and a couple of juice pouches. Of course, once the snacks went in the bag Dean realized they might make a mess so he threw in some wipes and a few folded-up paper towels. By the time Sam arrived to go with them, Dean looked a wreck.
“Well I’ll make you a deal….” Dean paused realizing that although he recognized the overly serious boy standing in front of him, he had no clue what his name was. “Castiel” Castiel rolled his eyes.
Dean cringed listening to the entire speech. Dean hadn’t made it known among his professional circle that he was married to a man. They all knew he was married due to the paperwork having a spouse listed as the next of kin. He didn’t outright lie, it's just when they saw the name Castiel they made assumptions and he never bothered to correct them.
The doorbell rang, jolting Dean out of his frozen stupor. Sam was there and ready to plan their trip. First to pick a reasonable destination and then maybe pick a few stops if something was impressive in the area.
*$*$*$*$*
“Hey, Dean! Did you mean to leave this stuff out on the table?” Cas called out to Dean after he got out of the shower. Towel wrapped around his hips, he searched the house for his roommate.
When Bobby first went out just to heal, Dean picked up the slack with the understanding that it was only temporary. Cas knew the extra stress for a week or two would have an effect but he just wished that Dean would talk to him. That’s what people who are married to each other do, they lean on each other when stressed out and overworked. Not Dean, he always felt like he had to do it on his own and never mumble or grumble.
Dean just realized the flaw in his flimsy plan of avoidance, they live in the SAME APARTMENT. Dean came out of his own mind to realize that someone was knocking on his door.
Castiel tried to take in everything she had said. Dean was here, Sam was here, the kids had been here. He wondered how much they knew about what happened to him… how much would he have to explain?
“Double bacon cheeseburger with onion rings just like you wanted.” Dean points at the food as he laid it out on the table next to him. “If I wasn’t afraid of Missouri I would’ve brought you a beer, but given the circumstances, I like all of my appendages right where they are.” With a smile, only Dean could give he leaned down kissing Cas with all the words he couldn’t say.
“Right Dean, and risk chasing you off? It took him forever to get you to go on a date with him, I doubt he would so much as ask you to switch seats with him.” Sam couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was a harsh truth but if anyone could put it out there and actually be listened to, it was Sam.
“Does Dean know? I mean I know he means well and he feels he needs to make more than enough money to take care of you all.” Sam tried to explain Deans need to be the caregiver all over again.
Sam grabbed Lisa by the arm passing her shoes and purse to Gabe.
“Yes hun, a week. Between you and me, I knew you’d pull through, but I didn’t tell that to that husband of yours. He needed to sweat it out for a while.”
Castiel walked in the door and immediately stopped.
“Come on Cas, you can do it, you’re a fighter, you’re strong. Come back to me baby.”
Dean knew his choices had done damage to Cas, but he hadn’t taken the time to think about what all of this was doing to the kids. This outburst coupled with the one from Castiel, Dean couldn’t possibly feel any worse about what he’d done to his family. At this rate, Claire was a ticking time bomb.
Charlie didn’t know the words that her best friend needed, but she could hold him and give him support.
“He’s leaving.” Dean barely said above a whisper. “There’s someone else and he’s leaving me.” Dean hadn’t said the words out loud but they were on an endless loop in his mind.  His whole body started to shake with tears he hadn’t realized were falling.
At this point Cas couldn’t stay in the shadows, he could tell Dean had had enough and was about to break the poor girls heart and destroy her feelings.
Dean dropped back on the couch and put on a movie. He loved that he and Charlie could just co-exist and not need to talk constantly.
“I need your help to figure out how to apologize to Dean.” Castiels eyes at this point were finally fully opened, and the low growl in his deep voice had subsided, he was ready to deal with the waking world.
Aiden’s first steps
Back in the control room, Sam glared at Charlie and Gabe, but there was no real anger behind it.
“Umm..I’d rather…yea it can wait.” Dean wasn’t too crazy about waiting to talk over the prospect of his extension if they were going to fight, he wanted to get it over with, so they could reconcile before he left, he needed Cas to understand it would be for the best.
“You have one?! Can I see it?” Jo was bouncing around like a hyperactive Chihuahua.
“I guess I will. “Castiel finally sat on a stool
“But Dean you didn’t even ask me how it went. For all you know I flopped and ruined everything.” Castiel didn’t miss the rolling eyes.
“Yes, Cas I’ve wanted you since I can remember, now get down here and make your omega happy.” Dean grabbed Cas by the back of his neck pulling him down into a passionate kiss.
By the time the machine beeped Sam was walking through the front door.
Maybe his senior year wouldn’t be so bad…. but Castiel kept that thought to himself./p>
“Hannah, Castiel is a stereotypical alpha in that he prefers omegas.” Dean left it at that. Hopefully, that was enough to help her decide on her own to move on.
Castiel took strength from his characters and added Dean to his visitation list, he was walking out of this place, he wouldn't lose to loneliness again.
Having to start work as soon as possible meant he had to put the children in a summer camp right after they arrived. Luckily he found one that was closer to Sams’ place, meaning it made more sense for Sam to pick up the children in the evenings. He was lucky there were still spots open. It was an arts camp and a STEM camp run right next to each other that shared a cafeteria meaning siblings in different schools could still see each other during the day.
Castiels heart started to race. The extended moment of silence made him fear the worst.
After going through the photos of 4 different houses, Claire looked up. “I like the blue house!!! It has a big kitchen with two ovens so we ALWAYS have room to make cookies!!!” Castiel couldn’t help but chuckle at her reasoning.
“Now you’ve done it”
He was worse than lonely
“Dean I need to get to sleep and you’re right you definitely need a shower.” Castiel walked off to the bedroom leaving his husband standing there confused as to how he’d been left to handle the situation in his pants all alone.
The day they brought Aiden home.
“I know that’s what you think bro but have you seen the way he looks at you? I think Dean-o might feel the same.” Gabriel had witnessed it too many times to count how no matter who was around or how many people surrounded him, Dean always tracked Castiels movements, making sure that he always had what he needed. The look of longing when Castiel would smile, the look of jealousy when another person would make Cas smile or laugh. There was something there.
Back in the room, Castiel had already begun to gather his items. He’d heard enough to know that Dean was putting him out. There's no need to fight to get better if he has no reason. The kids were the light in his life, they would soon be gone. At least this way he could save Dean a little on the medical bills.
They had to hate him for what he’d done. Claire wouldn’t understand, but Aiden would. He would hate him for trying to leave, for being so selfish. Luckily Claire is young enough that she could completely forget about him, it was for the best.
Castiel turned and glared attempting to burn a hole through his brothers face “Gabriel, if you’re going to interrupt, you could at least be...”
When the session was over, most tears had been dried and treats were had from Missouris candy jar. They all filed out of the room to a clearly nervous Sam.
Dean knew she didn’t mean anything by it, all of the registering of school and most interactions had been taken care of by either Sam or Castiel. “I believe your husband informed us that you were out of the country. Welcome back.” But it still hurt, just another reminder of how much of a ghost he’d been in his children’s lives.
According to the doc, these mood swings or ‘emotional rollercoaster’ that he was on was a step in the right direction for healing. The doc told him that these ups and downs meant that he had been pushed out of being comfortably complacent. His mind was no longer resigned to being miserable and was trying to sort through all of those emotions that he had repressed over time.
Castiel woke up a few hours later already tucked into his bed. On his desk a note saying he had an appointment with this therapist first thing in the morning.
“You heard them, Ellen, just as much as I did, Dean doesn’t want me. He’s putting me out as soon as I’m released and taking the kids. I have nowhere to go, no family, so no reason to be here anymore. Just let me go and forget I was ever here.” Castiels speech was swallowed by sobs. Ellen wrapped her arms around the broken man.
Cas looked up from the book he was reading over the new flowers in the hospital garden. Maybe he could….no he wasn’t going to think about the future, just enjoy the present.
. I know it's not as catchy but it makes sense.
“Trouble?”
Dean felt like an idiot but he held up his part of the deal, Charlie was paid overtime and he was getting his costume together for a weekend spent being her handmaiden.
!!!! How could you even
“Oh, you poor baby.” Missouri stroked his cheek “I’m here to help you get back on the right path sweetheart. It won't be easy and it won't go quickly but if you want to win that mans heart back then we need to get started.” Missouri went back to dicing onions and dumping them in the pot she’d already had going on the stove.
“Should I assume you're the husband?” An older nurse looked down on him with barely hidden contempt.
By the time the other two came down, it looked as if Dean had decided to take a shower with all of his clothes on while Claire was all smiles with damp hair.
“So…I’m not taking you back to your house, we both know you’d only get in your precious baby and go harass the people at the shop and they don’t need that.” Jess glanced over at Dean. She knew he wasn’t really listening but she had to fill the silence.
“Sweetheart I hear I’m still the only name on that list of yours, you should let those babies come see their papa. I know they’re worried about you. It would probably put them at ease to at least see you.” Ellen wasn’t wrong, the last time they had seen him was when he dropped them off with Sam to hang out before all of this happened. He wasn’t sure if they’d seen him in the hospital while he was unconscious.
Its alright we both think this is a pretty crappy thing to do to you. you alright?
Sam chuckled “Same old Dean.”
“Dean, yes you were inconsiderate of the schedules we keep, but your heart was in the right place. You haven’t been home lately so I understand your desire to spend time with the kids even though your efforts were…..misguided.” Castiel had to give Dean credit for at least acknowledging he’d been wrong and he even took the time to call Sam and figure out exactly what he’d done wrong.
When the timer for the pie went off, Cas didn’t let himself lose hope, so Dean was a little late, he said he’d be home for dinner. After Cas checked his phone for the 5
Sam and Dean were probably packing up the kids and making it so Cas would never see them again. Castiel would sign away parental rights with no fight. The kids didn’t deserve to have to deal with his downfall.
Castiel pushed back the thoughts again locking them away.
This time Aiden wrapped both arms around Dean's neck and squeezed hard.
Cas scrambles and runs.
Castiel ran himself a hot bath, made a cup of his favorite tea and dumped in the contents of a pouch he’d been keeping in his nightstand. All he had to do was fall asleep and it would be over.
*$*$*$*$*
“No prob Charlie, I’ll see you at Sunday dinner, and yes I’m always on your side……. as long as your side involves Game of Thrones” Sam chuckled as he headed back to his appointments for the day. At least this was a step in the right direction.
******
“Don’t worry about it Dean, just Mr trickster and the queen up to some shenanigans I put a stop to it though.” Sam shrugged with his back still to his brother, not sure how much he should say.
No sooner than Castiel walked out of the door dressed in his suit and lucky trench coat Dean had his phone to his ear.
“Hey Sam. Thanks for stopping by, I can only watch so much Jenny Jones or Dr. Sexy reruns.” Cas chuckled to himself, he only watched the show because Dean loved it so much he had no choice but to develop a fondness for the medical show. The silence that hung between them, heavy with curiosity, Sam really wanted to ask about what he had heard, but maybe it wasn’t his place and that’s not what he was here for.
Ramiel clutched at his throat as blood gushed through his fingers and down his body. Dean took the pen and stabbed him again to ensure that he would die. By the time Dean had finished freeing himself from the rest of his bindings, Ramiel was just a cold body on the cellar floor.
take our responsibilities seriously. Now I promised that I would be the one to fill the order and that’s exactly what I plan on doing. I’m going to get the kids to school and hope they haven’t missed too much. You can do whatever the hell you want with your day, but we all have places that we need to be.” Castiel had gotten eerily quiet towards the end of his rant. He pinched the bridge of his nose, took a deep breath and went to finish getting dressed.
Castiel put on a strong façade when it came to working. Although now he got a billion questions about the mystery husband who called the store. Mostly he was questioned by Charlie, and that girl was persistent, but wearing headphones constantly got his message across
Jess sat back down in her chair and looked to Sam for the answer. “Well, actually beside us…” “And Missouri” Jess chimed in. “yes and Missouri you’re the only person to know. We wanted to tell you because Jess let me in on the secret plans for the nursery that you’ve helped her put together and we only felt it was fair.” Sam gave the two conspirators a glare but there was no heat behind it.
Dean had so much more to do that he’d previously thought. Looking up at his angel laying in the bed. He looked as if he was merely asleep.
Castiel should have known, Gabriel couldn’t be serious for more than five minutes at a time, and he could never resist making a scene especially if embarrassing someone was the result.
Make dinner
Charlie left later that day with a container of soup before Cas came home. As soon as she sat down into her car she made a phone call.
Suggestions?
“I don’t want to think about it, he’s not interested in….he deserves more than me.” Castiel wouldn’t say the name. “He’s also made it clear that he will not date men so even if I were to admit that I may possibly harbor any amorous feelings towards a certain omega, it’s a moot point.” The little car pulled into the parking lot where Gabe was waiting outside.
Sams professional persona slipped back into place while he wrote down which tests he need to draw blood for. “Just Cas can you at least promise me you’ll consider talking to Dean about this? Just give him a chance. I know he’s stressed out about work, but he’d never want you to have to go through something like this alone.” Sam nodded and gripped Cas hand before he stood up to walk out of the room. He was understandably tense, he hated keeping things from his brother, especially something that had the potential to be life changing.
“What Dean? I have an exam to study for, semesters almost over you know.” Sam was clearly distracted and tired. Dean kind of felt bad but nothing could kill his high.
“What? Umm yeah sure.” Dean had no clue what he’d just agreed to. Hopefully, it involved chocolate in some form.
build a sand
. Cas he couldn’t fix, well not until he found out if he was a match, but cars, cars he could fix.
“Yea that sounds like the moose.” Dean finally joined the conversation even if only to comment on Sams obsession with research.
“Cause I know you worry princess.”
“Look I get what you're trying to say but leaving is not the answer, you need to stick it out and let them know that you’re home for good, that they can put their trust in you again.” Sam squeezed his brother's shoulder trying to be reassuring. Before walking away Sam told him about a call he got from Ellen.
“You and I both know that I can’t do that” Jess didn’t even bother to look over at Dean. She shook her head and continued the drive to her home. “Sam would kill me and Cas would get up from his hospital bed to tell me how wrong I was if I took you anywhere but to food and a bed.” Jess took on what could only be defined as a ‘mom voice’ and tilted her head in Deans direction.
Neither one of them had even said happy anniversary to the other
“Without you two we wouldn’t have been able to have this, it’s only right.”
“Oh babygirl, you have no idea what I want to do to you tonight.” Strong words for a wolf who was in denial of his true nature. Dean knew that because of his build he could always get away with whatever he wanted but his true desires, he chose to keep buried deep within himself. No one would ever know that he was disappointed with the way he presented.
Can stop for a minute and be by your side
Castiel crumbled to the floor with his back against the wall. He was just so drained. So tired. And so DONE. All that resilience and fire to survive this place was gone, it left him along with the rage, the pain the tears. All that he held onto was gone.
Dean laid in bed with Cas wrapped around his middle in shock.
“Earth to Dean” Charlie was snapping her fingers in front of his green eyes. “You alright man? I asked you a simple question and not only do I get no answer you go all
*$*$*$*$*
Cas didn’t even get a chance to say bye before the line disconnected. He didn’t care, he was practically vibrating with hope as he detoured to the store for all the ingredients he needed. He even decided to spring for the organic cherries for his signature cherry berry pie, this would be their first dinner eaten together in weeks and he was going to make sure that it was perfect.
With the kitchen complete he decided to attempt sleeping. Bundled up in his sleeping bag Castiel stared at the ceiling, completely zoned out from reality.
“Wow Jo, tell me how you really feel,” Dean commented as he passed through the living room on his way to the kitchen. “Well, it's true Jerk.” Sam couldn’t help but say it with his perfected bitch face.
. Not his typical cartoonish flowers and animals but it was what he was feeling. This particular creation would have three flavors. The leaves would be flavored apple, the stems would be pear and the trap itself would be pineapple. Castiel chuckled to himself at the thought. Pineapple is said to have enzymes that try to eat you as you eat the fruit. It was too perfect not to use.
Missouri stepped into the doorway of his room
Jo stopped by their table to say hello and grab their order…as if it ever changed...and winked at Dean as she walked away. She was up to something…. Dean couldn’t quite figure out what…but it was something.
“Look, man, I’d be a shitty mate because I’m not any kind of good. I’m too big to be an omega, too much muscle. Not that smart, I mean I barely got into school here. I’m barely surviving. I can’t stay committed in a relationship for shit.” The whole time Castiel is sitting there purely dumbfounded that his best friend even felt this way. How could he see how amazing he was? Deans mouth was still moving, meaning he was still listing reasons he honestly believed he was a crappy omega.
Everyone laughed at Dean and Cas and their fierce protective natures.
C: Well, that depends on what you’re making…
“I wasn’t going to…okay yes I was, I don’t want to make Dean uncomfortable in his own home.” Castiel hadn’t even let himself think about the scent of omega arousal that had answered his own that night.
“When is the last time you talked to him?”
“Look I’ve got a way to save Cas I just need you to give this to him and tell him to trust me.” Sam shoved a piece of folded up paper in Gabe's hand and gave him the biggest puppy dog eyes he could muster.
After they were seated and the waiter brought their drinks Sam looked like he was going to vibrate out of his seat with information. “Ok Cas, let me put you out of your misery, I can see that you won't enjoy this meal if I wait until the end. First, let me tell you that you tested negative for all the big bads. No cancers, no Ebola, no pneumonia. So you can breathe. This isn’t a final meal or something.”
“I want to talk to my family first Dean. It wouldn’t be right to blindside them with this and my parents are currently out of the country on business. Be patient with me, please. Now that I have you I want to do this the right way.” Castiels deep blue eyes pleaded with him the first night they laid together in
“Sam.” Castiel walked up from behind him. Looking mountains better than the last time he’d seen him. Honestly the fact that Castiel was up and walking on his own was a vast improvement.
“Ramiel, umm.. sir, well I wanted to talk to you about the contract extension that you offered me.” Any other time Dean was the most confident man in the room but sitting opposite his boss he couldn’t help but fidget and stutter like a prepubescent teen.
“Under them?” Gabe was so confused.
“Oh uh yeah, looks like we’re sharing a room.” Dean held up the key for Cas to see. “Why don’t you go ahead and I’m gonna go talk to Sam, and so he knows when to meet us for food.” Castiel nodded and grabbed the key. As he walked away, Dean, for lack of a better word, melted over the way the muscles in his back rippled with each step. Only for a brief moment did he allow his eyes to drift lower and take in his butt.
“Keep it down!!! Destiel out there doesn’t know we’re here.” Charlie shushed Gabriel and his antics.
The more wholesome mornings he would wake up with either one or both of the children in bed with them. Whether the reason was nightmares or just middle of the night wandering. Having two mini furnaces curled into them, feeling the bed full but not overcrowded. His whole family right within his grasp. That was the best memory that he would relive from time to time.  Moments he wished he could stay in, instead of waking up to reality. A reality where his husband…or ex-husband depending on how you looked at it, was in a psych ward. A nicer one but still basically a nice room with padded walls.
“What….um ok well then, I guess Cas gets his room after all. I can bring him up first thing in the morning.”
“Sam?” Dean's voice grew more urgent, demanding.
“So we have a winner. I thought you guys already talked about this stuff?” Charlie picked at her fries giving Dean a chance to settle himself before the flood gates opened.
“Jo what the hell?!?!” Dean whisper yelled before she handed him the microphone.
Dean stood and tried to readjust his clothes. “I am.” Normally, Dean would turn on the charm and make her smile, but he didn’t deserve her smile, he knew that he deserved whatever speech she had reserved for him. All that anger melted from her as she took in his remorse. “If he pulls through this, you better make it right. I don’t know the situation and I don’t want to know. But know this, I will be checking up on him. Those precious angels deserve him in their lives. He deserves happiness.”
Sam knocked on the door gently, figuring that after the day they had Dean, Cas or maybe both would be sleeping. Dean answered the door clearly looking like he needed a drink. Alcohol was always Deans go to for solace, but with Cas needing him to be sober and solid, Dean couldn’t indulge.
“Woah, guys how about Aidan you help me make the batter for apple pie waffles? And Claire you’re going to be in charge of helping me make my cinnamon whip cream? Let's leave dad to relax for a little bit longer okay?”
This actually caught Castiels attention. “Come see you?”
Dean couldn’t help but chuckle, ask them if they remembered to wash their hands right after they leave the bathroom and they can’t remember, ask them to locate a sucker they haven’t laid eyes on in weeks, they pinpoint it with deadly accuracy.
, the kids you begged him for?” Sam was laying the guilt on thick, and he was not sorry for it.
Castiel shrugged at the question. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed but he hasn’t exactly been around enough to notice. If it doesn’t involve running the shop, right now its not a top priority for him.” Cas gave his answer in a matter-of-fact sort of way, the hurt in his voice was still there. His husband had once been caring, doting and present, but ever since he took over the shop, he’d been a ghost in the house, only coming home hours after Castiel had gone to sleep, always seeming to be up and out the door before Cas could get out of the shower in the morning.
“Okay I’ll make you a deal if you can get that dart to land in…. this circle.” Dean drew an impossibly small circle on the map. “ Then I will invite him. If you don’t then you have to tell me why you tried to ditch in the first place. Oh, and you have to do it blindfolded.” Dean stepped back proud of himself, this was a win-win. He wouldn’t have to ask Castiel to go on vacation with him, and he’d get to the bottom of Sam being weird, all without the chick-flick talking.
“I can’t do that, and you know why I can’t. He’s always only ever dated women. Yes, they were of all secondary genders, but they were all women. He could never want me Gabe. If I tell him he will move out and I will lose him forever, I can’t risk it.“  Castiel believed in his heart that he’d never love anyone as much as he loved Dean and he was okay with that. Dean would go on and find someone to love and Cas would live out his days throwing himself into his work. As long as Dean was happy, that’s all that mattered.
need their father. Do you know Aidan won't acknowledge you exist some days? ”
Claire wasn’t his concern because she seemed content to just go with the flow. Papa wasn’t there but daddy was, she just accepted it the same way she accepted that remote control cars don’t take baths, but her Bumblebee Transformer could. Aiden was the wild card. The boy was so observant and had zero filters when he wanted to say something, he felt was important. Aiden even in his few years in the world could always seem to say things that would go straight to his heart in both good and bad ways. At times he lit Dean's soul with pride while at other times a seemingly casual comment had destroyed him. Lately, every negative thought that had swirled around in his mind was in Aidens voice. All the thoughts of how bad he’s messed up for their family to get this bad. Thoughts of how both children were going to need to be in therapy for probably the rest of their lives all because of him and his issues. Some of the thoughts came out as whispers while others blared like a loudspeaker he couldn’t turn off.
The next stop they made was at Deans favorite auto shop near the park. Cas had made an appointment to get baby detailed inside and out. Can’t pamper Dean without taking his precious Impala into consideration. They walked hand in hand in the park. Castiel stopped at the local vendor and got them both cotton candy to enjoy.
Walking out of his advisory meeting with the head of his department Castiels plan was once again derailed. “Hello, Castiel. Can I talk to you for a minute?” Daphne, a brunette omega, strolled up hooking her arm in his and guiding him to a bench near the path. She was exactly the type of omega his family expected him to end up with, professionally minded, submissive and eager to please. None of which were positives in his mind.
You be my honeysuckle and I’ll be your honey bee.”
“Alright, snowman it’s time to melt you down and get my little girl back.” Castiel held Claire out in front of him so he didn’t get any of the shaving cream on him. Sitting Claire down in the tub, Castiel started the warm water, Claire immediately started smacking her hands in it, getting water everywhere. Usually, he would discipline her and explain that it's not proper bathtub etiquette, but this time Castiel decided to cherish the moment. He sat on the tile floor, back against the wall and really looked at his daughter. He looked at the ringlets in her bright blonde hair, the dimple in her smile. He took notice of how her fingers would bend forming her hand into a cup right before it hit the water for a maximum splash.
Cas slowly opened his eyes, he was back in his room but surrounded by everyone. Dean, Sam, Jess, Missouri, Charlie, even Bobby, and Ellen are there.
“Think about it, you didn’t know her beyond the fact that she was your nurse, she could have been some crazy woman who kidnaps patients. Why trust her?”
“Just hear me out, having more people means more drivers. More people to spread the costs around and just you know maybe even….bond with……. I mean as friends” Sam knew he wasn’t being subtle about it, at least he didn’t think he was.
“Hey guys”
with your law firms name on them. More specifically your name!?” By the end of the question, Dean was screaming.
“Well, Cas….I guess you’re just gonna have to be like the smartest character in the Harry Potter books and kick it in the ass like Hermione.” Charlie giggled at her statement, this was always an argument between them. She always sided with Hermione and he always said Neville was underappreciated for all he did. The distraction was exactly what her friend needed and even though Cas knew exactly what she was doing. He couldn’t help but be drawn in and away from his own destructive thoughts.
“Hey Cas, Hows my favorite brother in law?”
“What exactly would I say to him, Sam? ‘
and close those deep blue need you eyes"
“Your final question is: Why would you make a terrible mate?” Charlie cut the feed to their tv so that as far as the boys knew they were left alone.
“I’m worried about the kids, but I’m worried about Cas more. You didn’t hear it. He just, he wasn’t himself you know? Look I’ve got a meeting to go to. Come home Dean” Sam hung up the phone without waiting for a response. He knew it would be nothing more than placating words and justification based on dollar signs.
Every day that passed made Dean more and more anxious. Aiden and Claire had finally adjusted to him being around instead of their papa and had gone back to their normal daily schedule. Dean would pace the new house in the middle of the day, debating with himself about going to visit Castiel. Or at least trying to. Once Ellen had told him that she had gotten Castiel to the facility, he did all that he could to make sure Cas would be comfortable. They already had many of the comfort items he’d sent ahead but there were a few that Dean was hoping he could give to Castiel in person. One, in particular, was a specific hoodie of his that Cas would always take when he was home, or if they would allow it, he would bring Cas favorite mug or his favorite brand of honey.
was missing but he wasn’t ready to admit anything yet.
as Gabriel had informed him it was called, none of them were men. Also knowing Dean grow up he could see how he denied his omega side. Sure he embraced his love of cooking, but that wasn’t gender specific, look at Gabriel, he was a omega but he worked at a bakery and had been making confectionary art since he could see the counter tops.
“Of course not, but we haven’t had the sweets from the new bakery that opened up down the street so I wanted to give you options. Don’t worry I’ll make sure nothing goes to waste.” Dean was snacking on his second tartlet at this point absent-mindedly flipping through a magazine that Jess had left in the room earlier that week. “Oh, I almost forgot” Dean reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a ziplock bag that held two pb&j cookies. Contraband. “Jess told me to make sure you get these. I'm guessing they're a bribe.” Cas loved the smile on his husbands face, almost childlike.
“Ok spill, what the hell happened?” Charlie plopped down in the booth across from Gabe who already had his hands wrapped around a mug of hot cinnamon cocoa.
The plot thickens
“Where is the facility?” Castiel didn’t want to go but he had to admit if he was going to stick around in the land of the living, which it seemed she was determined to make him do, then he might as well try. Ellens efforts couldn’t go to waste.
Every bit of rage dissolved into desperation, he thought he’d kept them away from this life, safe from any reprisals. He’d been so careful to never mention them, their names weren’t on any paperwork. He’d tried so hard to protect them.
“Your precious? Ha, you sound like Smeagol.” Dean laughed. He looked over his shoulder, Castiel was half awake and no two strands of his hair were in agreement.
” The underlying threat was clear.
Castiel started to punch the bag a little harder.
“Tell them hi for me and can you send some pictures? Jess has been harassing me for some new ones.”
Dean called the twins into the dining room for lunch. On the weekends he really loved being home with the twins while Castiel went on hippy-dippy trips to the farmers market or to see some indie movie with Sam. This time Dean took Sam's advice and instead of making fries to go with his burgers, there were veggies.
