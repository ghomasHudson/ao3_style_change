221 drabbles of 221 words each.
“This way.”
I am not going to end each one with a word starting with B or give them a secret like they did, but I am going to do 221 drabbles of 221 words each. They won't be in any sort of chronological order. For the most part they should be mostly canonical, except that since the detective and the doc are a couple, there is no Mary and no Rosie.
“Yes?” All of his senses were on high alert, his chest tight.
The smile on Sherlock's face made all the annoyance worth it.
Harry, who was half a world away, quite literally.
Sherlock frowned. The man had no idea what they two of them had been through in the past, how many hospitals they had visited. They had even been to this one several times, as The Princess Grace Hospital was the closest A&E to Baker Street.
The man he fought for. The man he died for.
The title of each chapter will be the prompt that I wrote it for.
“Doctor Watson.” Sherlock corrected.
John swallowed the pills dry, slammed the container down on the edge of the sink, and stalked out of the loo, back towards their bedroom. “I'm gonna be late for work.” he grumbled, a lame excuse to leave the situation.
He looked to Sherlock for confirmation, but the man had stopped dead in his tracks, mid-step. He was staring straight at the doctor, unblinking.
These are 221 of them.
One look sent Sherlock's heart racing, and his stomach plummeting.
“I.. think I have something else that requires your attention.”
“Of course.” Doctor Morgan got up from his chair and walked over to his office door, opening it. “He is resting now, we are keeping him sedated for the time being. Be warned, we had to shave part of his hair, and he has a bandage on his head, along with several IVs in a central line in his neck, and machines to monitor his vitals. It may be a bit of a shock to see him as he is now.
A moment of silence.
That lasted all of thirty minutes, when Lestrade's heavy footsteps thumped up the stairs.
Much to both the chagrin and pleasure of John Watson.
“It's not too bad. But if you want, I can kiss it and make it better.”
Sherlock jumped up, the eye almost forgotten. “Of course.”
Despite everything that Doctor Morgan said, nothing would never had prepared Sherlock for the sight in front of him. The room was dark, the lights off, but there was enough ambient light from the door and the slight break in the blackout curtains to let Sherlock take in the room.
“Easy, John.” John felt a strong hand on his shoulder. “It isn't so bad. Lestrade knows what building we're in. It's not large, so it won't take them long to sweep the rooms and find us. I'd say we have... no more than three and a half hours before we're found.”

These are 221 of them.
Sherlock Holmes, John Watson
“John, why do I have to do this?” Sherlock tugged at the collar of his tuxedo. This was far from the first time wore one, but despite his love of well tailored suits, he could never get used to how constricting and itchy they were.
When John put the digit in his mouth again, he used his teeth to scrape against the sides of his finger, careful to avoid the cut. There was a hiss of pleasure and pain from Sherlock at the attention his finger was getting.
He looked like hell.
“You need to be in bed, John.” Sherlock's tone brooked no argument. It was a tone that he so rarely ever took with John, and he knew that would get the doctor's attention.
The man who was currently asleep in his bed after a rather vigorous round of lovemaking.
When John told him they'd have their own personal beach, where they could make love under the moonlight, Sherlock was on board.

Last night.
“John?” Immediately Sherlock was up and out of his seat, reaching the doorway to the stairs at the same time as John, almost bumping into him.
Sherlock Holmes, John Watson
And what he saw chilled him to his core.
“Sherlock, no. You can't even see out of your left eye.”
And, every by his side, has been John.
He just had no idea how long it would be.
“You look quite handsome.” John leaned up, giving Sherlock a kiss on the lips and straightening his black tie.
“Whadda ya mean, the door isn't working?”
“Yes?”
With one last plaintive look out the window, Sherlock turned towards the bedroom, and his certain future.
It didn't long for Sherlock to find one of John's weak spots- teeth. More specifically, Sherlock's teeth on whichever of John's body parts he could reach.
Sherlock couldn't help but look over to his side, where John was laying on his back- splayed out, the covers rucked down to his waist, giving the barest hint of a light brown trail of hair that led from his belly to places below.
And now this.
It was a long, anxious, sleepless night. Sherlock kept vigil over John's bed, only moving when a doctor or nurse made him get up as they did their hourly rounds. Sherlock distracted himself by deducing them. There was a young lady who was trying to sleep her way through the rest of medical school, and another older woman who had been married but was now widowed and only went back to nursing to get out of the house and have something to do.
Mrs Hudson laughed. “I wouldn’t worry yourself, dear. It’s been many years since anything that exciting has happened here. I highly doubt you’ll have any murders to solve during your stay.” She patted him on the arm.
“Sherlock,” John admonished. “Take a seat and calm down. You’re scaring her.”
Doyle smiled almost sadly. “When I knew him, he was rude and anti-social, and very withdrawn. He often looked sad when he thought no one could see him. Otherwise, he tended to keep his emotions hidden, but I could tell he was unhappy.”
“Yes, I would,” John said quickly, and he filled out the guest book just as it had been when he found it in the attic. His business now complete and wanting nothing more to do with Mr Hudson, John turned to leave, but before he could exit the foyer, he noticed Martha sat curled up in a chair, looking forlorn. He made his way over to her.

Hope you liked it! As always, I'd love to hear your thoughts!
Sherlock looked intrigued at his answer, and, to John’s surprise, a little nervous as well. “I’m sorry if I startled you when I came up behind you,” John said, hoping to show him that he meant no harm.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock finally asked.
I hate to leave you in suspense, but I'll be away all next week on a trip for my grad program, so I won't be able to update until Sunday (or Saturday evening, depending on how late we get back). So for now, I hope you enjoyed this chapter, and I'll be back with more next weekend.
John found the hotel theatre in the park, situated in a picturesque location by the lake. He entered the theatre and immediately felt in the way; people were rushing about, setting up for the performance the following night, and there was a rehearsal in progress on the stage. Still, John was not to be deterred. He approached two men sitting towards the front of the theatre, overhearing a part of their conversation.
Sherlock took a deep breath, and then he slowly brought his free hand around to rest at the small of John’s back. Then, finally, he started dancing again. John let Sherlock lead him around the floor, his confidence seeming to grow as he lost himself in the music. John’s own confidence grew as he realized that dancing was easy, enjoyable even, when he had Sherlock Holmes leading him.
“Oh, I was just exploring,” John lied, coming up behind Sherlock. He was surprised to see that the attic was even more cluttered than it had been in 1980; now it was a complete maze of old crates, trunks, and hotel memorabilia, just waiting to be explored.
“I…n-no…I wouldn’t dream…” John stammered.
Sherlock looked Mycroft straight in the eyes. “You’re wrong,” he said. “I love him, and he loves me. He would never leave me.” He had examined the evidence and come to the conclusion that it was impossible for John to have left of his own accord. Therefore, although it seemed so improbable, something must have happened to him. He tried to keep the rising panic out of his voice as he said, “I don’t know what has happened to him, but I will find him, Mycroft. Don’t you dare try to stop me.”
“No, I don’t think so. We broke up.” And with that, John walked out of the clinic.
“I wish to God I didn’t,” the first replied. “Fine, if he’s so anxious to get out of here, let him doff his fine coat and help us tear down the set.” He turned abruptly to John, who had been standing awkwardly next to the two men. “What?!”
John nodded eagerly, eliciting a sigh from Doyle. “I should never have written that biography in the first place,” he muttered, and then said more loudly, “I’m sorry, I don’t wish to speak about Holmes today, or any day for that matter. You’ll have to go.” He started to close the door.
Maud snorted. “‘A nice conversation’? Is that what you call it?”
He started walking down the hall, but abruptly turned around when he heard the door he had just come out of re-open and pretended to be coming from the other direction. He must not have closed the door quietly enough.
John stared up at the ceiling for a few minutes before coming to a decision. He didn’t want to live anymore, that much was certain. Not without Sherlock. But when Mrs Hudson got back, she would likely hover over him – she seemed the type – and he would have no chance to get away. If he was going to escape his empty life, he had to do it now.
Sherlock lay wide-awake on the top bunk of the sleeper car. He had spent the past couple hours pretending to be asleep, but now he could hear the slow breaths coming from the bunk below him that indicated that Mycroft was finally asleep. Careful not to make any noise, Sherlock eased out of his bunk and grabbed the clothes he had left on top of his trunk when he had undressed earlier. He tiptoed out of the car and gently shut the door behind him, breathing a sigh of relief. He headed to the lavatory, where he changed into his clothes and left his nightshirt on the floor, and then, double checking his pockets for the money he had stolen from Mycroft and stashed there, he went to wait by one of the train’s doors.
“For God’s sake, Sherlock!” Sherlock was jolted from his thoughts as Mycroft entered the room without bothering to knock. “Wipe that ridiculous grin off your face; it makes you appear unintelligent.”
“W-what?” John stammered. “Sherlock, I don’t know how to do that!”
, John decided.
“Why not?!” John yelled, finally losing his temper. “If you really want what is best for Sherlock, why would you keep him away from the man he loves?”
John choked on his tea, coughed, and started laughing.
Enjoy!
Mycroft raised his eyebrows. “Concerned from a medical standpoint, are you?”
Sherlock looked uncertain, but John gave him a hopeful little smile, and Sherlock caved. “Alright,” he said, handing John the key. “But just for a moment or so. Mycroft will be coming up shortly to make sure I’m getting ready for tonight.”
There's a story behind the title to this chapter. While trying to come up with a good title, I happened across a Freddie Mercury song called "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow," which I had never heard before. Turns out that, in addition to being very "trmojas" in general, this song perfectly fits this point in this story. So this chapter is dedicated to Freddie :)
Enjoy the next chapter!
Anthea shook her head. “No, I’m sorry.”
“That’s amazing,” John complimented, causing Sherlock to blush. “Does that help you with your acting?”
John didn’t know how to respond to this, so he simply said, “Yes.”
“Flirting! You were flirting with him!” Maud accused.
(See the end of the chapter for
Martha’s eyes grew impossibly bigger, and she quickly shook her head, looking back down at her lap. John pursed his lips. The little girl had confided in him yesterday. It had seemed like she trusted him. What had changed?
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you,” Sherlock choked back.
As the humming grew louder, John couldn’t help his curiosity: he opened the curtains ever so slightly, just enough to peek through. The woman was bustling about the room, apparently getting ready for dinner. She was currently in only her underwear and shoes, the corset and heels combining to show off her fine figure, and John couldn’t help but stare for a moment, before remembering Sherlock Holmes and immediately feeling ashamed. He quickly brushed off the feeling of guilt, however, because in the next moment, the women moved into the next room and John saw his opportunity to escape. He tiptoed out of the closet and toward the door of the suite, but he stopped short when he saw the door handle start to turn. Someone was coming in! Without enough time to get back in the closet, John dived behind a chair just as the door opened.
Mike looked at him quizzically. “Why do you need to learn how to travel in time?”
I'm busy tomorrow, so I'm posting early this week. Many thanks to those who left comments and kudos! I hope you enjoy the next chapter! The title is, of course, a tribute to Oscar Wilde.
Sherlock snorted. “Is that the best you can do?”
John took that as his cue to move things along. He led Sherlock over to the canopied bed and sat him down on the edge of it. He kissed his forehead, then kissed down his face, between his eyes and to the tip of his nose. He gave Sherlock’s lips extra attention, slipping his tongue inside Sherlock’s mouth and nibbling on his lips a little, while simultaneously freeing Sherlock from his necktie, before continuing down, kissing under his jaw and down his now-exposed neck. Sherlock groaned, and John was surprised by how arousing he found the sound.
“No,” John choked out. He had to get back. He had to get back to Sherlock. Grasping the back of a couch, he pulled himself to his feet. The moment he put weight on his right leg, a sharp pain shot through it. John ignored it and half limped, half stumbled his way out of the modern 221B and back to his old room.
Sorry. I hope Mycroft has redeemed himself a bit at least.
“I suppose I could manage to eat something,” Sherlock said. He picked lightly at his food while John dug in.
Sherlock spun around suddenly. “Where is he? What have you done to him?”
Lestrade nodded. “I’m a Detective Inspector for Scotland Yard. I investigate homicides.”
Mike playfully flipped him off. “Just you wait, John. One day, I’ll discover the secret to time travel and build my own Tardis. Then won’t you be jealous! You’ll be begging me to teach you my secret!”
“Stop correcting me when I’m trying to compliment you,” John said. “You’re extraordinary.”
, John decided. There was work to do.
. Let’s not bury the playwright before his time.”
“Excuse me, sir,” John heard Sherlock say. “I appear to be lost. I’m not from around here, and I seem to have lost my way and wandered into a bad part of town. Please, could you point me in the direction of the river? I should be able to find my way from there.”
“So, you’re teaching now,” John said, once they were both comfortably seated with cups of tea.
“John,” he breathed when John was stood before him, totally naked. “You’re huge.”
“Yeah, that’d be great!” Mike grinned. “But we won’t be able to start until late. It’s Doctor Who tonight!”
Thanks for reading! I'll be back next week with the next chapter!
Thanks to everyone leaving comments and kudos! Enjoy the next chapter!
Sherlock looked frustrated. “No, I can’t figure it out. Mycroft’s probably figured it out, but I’m not going to ask
, he thought.
The door to the shed burst open, and Sherlock ran inside. “John! Oh, John!” He knelt beside him and began untying the knots, releasing John first from the gag and then from the ropes. As soon as Sherlock had freed him and helped him to his feet, John threw his arms around him and held him tight, feeling overwhelmed with emotion. Sherlock hugged him back, murmuring into his hair, “Are you alright?”
John shook his head. “No, it’s not like those times back in uni and med school. It’s real this time. I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Except…” He trailed off, unsure how to explain his predicament without sounding completely insane.
“John Watson,” John replied.
“If you insist…” John took a breath. “Ok, I’m in love.”
“Um, what?” was John’s elegant reply.
“Thank you,” John said, and hurried away as fast as he could.
John stood back to admire the vision that was Sherlock, now completely undressed. Sherlock blushed a deeper red and moved as if to cover himself, but John reached out and stopped him. “You’re beautiful,” he repeated. He sat down on the bed beside Sherlock and reached around the back of his neck, pulling him in for another long kiss. Sherlock responded with enthusiasm, his hands coming up to feel the muscles of John’s arms and chest. John’s own hands wandered over Sherlock’s body as he revelled in the feel of soft, silky skin. By the time they finally broke apart, they were both panting. John took Sherlock’s hand in his own and looked into his eyes. “What exactly do you want, Sherlock?”
John took a deep breath and closed his eyes, his heart speeding up in his chest, before turning the page. He opened his eyes tentatively, and his breath caught in his throat as he recognized his own handwriting. There was his name! He had apparently signed into room 416 at 9:18 AM on 28 June 1912.
“We are, but we have a show in London tonight,” Sherlock explained. “We’re not staying long, though. We’re not even staying at the house, because Mycroft wanted everyone to stay together in a hotel near the theatre.”
Mike grinned. “Yup! I did it, Johnny! I’ve discovered the secret to time travel! I’m basically a Time Lord now.”
Martha looked uncertain again, but she must have decided to trust the kind man, because she replied, “He doesn’t like it when I interrupt him when he’s with his special clients.”
UPDATE: I forgot to mention when I posted this earlier that this is the last fully-happy chapter. The first half of the next chapter is very happy, and I will let you know when to stop reading if you want to read half the chapter and then stop before it gets sad, but if you want to be extra careful, you should stop reading after this chapter.
John was so immersed in the pleasure of lying in Sherlock’s embrace, their lips and bodies pressed tightly together, that it took him a while to realize there was a problem. He pulled back slightly with a murmured, “Shit.”
“What was that?” John asked, ducking his head and trying to catch Sherlock’s eye.
Sherlock. They would be together now, John would make sure of it. If Sherlock couldn’t leave the theatre company, then John would just have to travel with them.
I reached a milestone in the past week - this story has now had over 1000 hits, which is very exciting for me! I can't thank all of you enough for the interest and support you've shown this fic.
Still, John had to learn more about him. He continued searching the library for information when he struck gold: someone had written a biography of Sherlock Holmes! John checked out the book and headed back to the hotel, where he devoured the biography in one night. However, upon finishing the book around 2 am, John still felt dissatisfied. He read the author’s note; apparently, the author – someone named Arthur Conan Doyle – had known Sherlock Holmes. And yet he hadn’t actually written that many intimate details about him. It was as if he were holding back information. Well, that just wouldn’t do. John pulled the phone book out of his bedside table and looked up Arthur Conan Doyle’s address, deciding to visit him in the morning.
Upon reaching the suite, he knocked lightly on the door, but was greeted with silence. Surely they couldn’t be at breakfast already? John knocked again, a little louder now, and this time a voice from inside yelled, “Shut up!”
“If you have a message for him, give it to me and I’ll see it reaches him,” the man snapped, before returning to his conversation without giving John a chance to respond.
“Everything’s great now, thanks!” John turned and sprinted back in the direction of the hotel, leaving Mrs Hudson shaking her head and tutting after him.
“John.” Sherlock tested it out, and John thought he had never heard anything better than hearing his name in Sherlock’s voice.
“Um, no,” John said firmly. “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I know you want to be a detective, but this is really beyond either of us. We need to notify the police.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, I know, they’re idiots,” John continued. “But they’re the law and they need to know about this murder. If we didn’t tell them, we’d be obstructing justice.” Sherlock sighed, looking dejected, and something in John broke. “Look,” he said gently. “Maybe they’ll let you help, if you show them how smart you are. I’ll just nip down to the front desk and ask them to contact the police, and meanwhile, you can stay here and start deducing.”
Sherlock didn’t have to wait long before the train stopped and he was able to disembark. Hurrying into the small station, he bought a ticket for the next train to London.
Sherlock, whom he had now abandoned to a long life of loneliness and drug addiction.
, he thought.
“Where are we going?” he asked, once Sherlock had slowed down the carriage enough that John felt safe starting a conversation.
,” he breathed.
“No, of course I will.” John hastily pulled himself together. “Sorry, I was just laughing at the way you asked. Of course I’ll marry you, Sherlock. I’d be honoured.”
John sat down at his hotel room desk, where earlier he had left a tape recorder he had bought. He picked up the microphone, pressed “record,” and began to speak: “It is the 27
Reminder to anyone who wants a happy ending that you may want to stop reading now (although the first half of the next chapter is still happy).
, John thought, as he noticed Mycroft lurking near the doorway, watching them. “What’s with him?” he asked out loud, nodding towards Mycroft.
“No,” Sherlock said, before turning and walking down the street.
A knock on the door startled John from his dark thoughts. “Mr Watson?” a woman’s voice came from the other side of the door. “Are you okay, dear? The maid says you’ve been in there for days.”
, it read.
Intrigued, John read on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s beautiful,” Sherlock commented. “What is it?”
Sherlock huffed. “It’s a brothel, John!”
“Sod dinner!” Lestrade retorted. “There’s been a murder, and I’m on the case. I hope we can agree that’s a little more important?”
Sherlock groaned. “What could have happened to him?” He grasped at his hair in frustration. “Think, think!”
, John thought.
Before long, Sarah came and asked John to get her a drink. (“Your sister’s by the drinks, and she always hits on me when she’s drunk. I’d rather keep my distance.”) John obliged, and soon he found himself back at the centre of the party, with everyone wanting to talk to him. He had just finished speaking with a friend of his father’s, and was turning away to seek out Mike again, when he found himself face-to-face with an elderly man. The man was tall, and very thin; his thinness combined with his old age made him look like a breath of air could knock him over. He wore a long navy-blue coat over a black suit, and on his head was, of all things, a deerstalker. Poking out from underneath the deerstalker, John could see grey curls, still thick despite the man’s age. John had never seen him before.
Such was the force of John’s outburst that he didn’t notice the door behind him open and somebody enter the shed, or Mycroft’s little nod to the person now stood behind him. The next thing he knew, he felt a prick in his neck. As his vision started to go hazy, John briefly tried in vain to fight off his attacker, before everything went black and he lost consciousness.
Mycroft’s eyes shot up, and he stared John down. John stared back, undeterred.
Sherlock stared at him, and John realized his mistake. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude. Do you prefer I call you ‘Mr Holmes’?”
Sherlock looked back at him for a moment, and John could see longing written all over his face, but then he looked back at Mycroft and shook his head minutely. “I don’t know,” he said sadly, before returning to his brother in the restaurant, leaving John alone.
“Martha?” he said gently, crouching down in front of her. Martha looked up at him fearfully, and John changed his initial assessment. She didn’t look forlorn. She looked traumatized. “Hey, it’s okay,” he said, keeping his voice soft. “Remember me from yesterday? You don’t need to be afraid.”
John had to learn more. He found a librarian and asked her if the library had any theatre biographies, giving her a winning smile that convinced her to go search for the theatre magazines they apparently had in the back. She brought him a stack of several magazines, and John sifted through them, looking for anything relating to Sherlock Holmes. His heart sped up when his eye caught the title of one of the articles in the last magazine: Sherlock Holmes: The Final Years. He flipped to the page the article was on, and what he saw shocked him: staring out at him was a picture of the old man who had given him the pipe eight years previously!
John caught up to Sherlock and Wiggins, who were now loitering casually in an alleyway beside a building. “Sherlock, what’s going on?” John asked.
“What?” John asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
On stage, the maid leaned conspiratorially towards Sherlock. “He does have money though, sir.”
Maude looked incredulous. “You’re supposed to be on holiday! All you ever do is work; that’s why we took this holiday in the first place! We’re supposed to be spending time together but you’ve barely paid me any attention since we got here! First, the flirting with the theatre manager, now this! I don’t believe it!”
“Oh, banker Harwell,” said the maid.
Suddenly, Sherlock giggled. “Were you really flirting with my brother?” At Lestrade’s questioning look, he clarified, “The theatre manager.”
“He’s been buying and selling something,” said Lestrade, rifling through a ledger.
John went down to the dining room for breakfast. As he was eating alone, he grabbed a newspaper and was soon absorbed in the day’s news. It was fascinating to see what made the news on 28 June 1912. John was so absorbed in reading the newspaper that he didn’t notice the man heading in his direction until he had sat down at the table. The man cleared his throat and John looked up, dismayed but not entirely surprised to see Mycroft Holmes sat across from him.
John hurried down to the lobby and was just about to head over to the front desk when he spotted the man whose room he had arrived in the previous day.
John decided not to ask) “– the hotel manager basically raised me. I started working here after I finished school and I’ve been here ever since.”
John awoke to sunlight streaming in through the windows and feeling happier than he had ever felt in his life. It took him a moment to remember why he felt so happy, but then he remembered everything that had happened in the past 24 hours. He gazed fondly down at Sherlock, who was still sleeping peacefully in his arms, and just thought about how much he loved him. He was more in love than he had previously thought possible.
John smiled back and they held each other’s gaze for a long moment. John briefly contemplated trying to kiss Sherlock again, but decided not to push his luck. Suddenly he had an idea. “Hey, I know you said you outgrew the pirate thing, but are you still interested in looking for buried treasure? Because I know a place where we could explore and we might find some cool stuff. At the very least, it will be pleasantly spooky.”
When John opened his eyes, the first thing he was aware of was the pain in his lower back. At first he was confused, unsure of why he was in so much pain or even where he was, but then he remembered everything that had happened the day before. Traveling back in time. Meeting Sherlock Holmes. The dance. The almost-kiss. Mycroft’s untimely interruption. Left alone and without a room until the following morning, falling asleep, fully dressed, on a porch chair.
“Oh…um…” John tried and failed to quickly come up with a lie.
Martha looked up at him, recognition in her sad-looking eyes.
Sherlock shook his head, looking frustrated. “I can’t.”
Final chapter! This chapter title was originally supposed to be a reference to a song by the Wizard Rock band "The Ministry of Magic," but I realized that it's also a line from "Hamilton." So it's a reference to both.
“No, I’m sorry, Mr Holmes,” she said, following him to his dressing room. “He wasn’t in his room, and they haven’t seen him at the front desk.”
“Relax,” John whispered. He put his free hand on Sherlock’s hip and caressed his sharp hipbone with his thumb. Gradually, he felt Sherlock’s muscles relax around him, and he slowly pushed farther in, giving Sherlock time to adjust to the new sensation. Once his finger was fully in, he started working it in and out of Sherlock until Sherlock was writhing, moaning, and asking for more. John removed his finger, slicked up a second one, and pushed two fingers back in. He scissored his fingers, stretching Sherlock further, and before long Sherlock was ready for a third finger. Sherlock was moaning constantly now, and when John brushed his fingers over his prostate, he cried out loudly.
,” John hoped that would butter him up. “How would you like to let me in on your secret?”
John sighed again as he stood up. He couldn’t help but think that if Mycroft Holmes was as powerful as he claimed – and he didn’t doubt he was – he should stop using his power to control his brother’s life and instead focus on taking down the likes of Mr Hudson.
“Leave within two hours after the show’s over?” one man was saying. “The man’s insane!”
Hope you enjoyed!
“Oh, yes,” John replied. He knew it shouldn’t surprise him that Sherlock could read his thoughts. “Does your friend live in Whitechapel?”
Inside the hotel, John checked into a room and, at the clerk’s request, signed the guest book. “Mrs Hudson will show you to your room,” the clerk informed him, and John turned to see a small, kind-looking old woman gathering up his bags.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice held a tone of warning. “You are not to go with that man.”
He moved to unlock the door, but John stopped him. “Can’t we talk for a little longer?”
Sherlock walked over to his dressing table mirror and pretended to check his hair. He saw Mycroft’s reflection raise an eyebrow at him. “Your performance in act one, I must say, was somewhat eccentric.”
“Yes, some young chap,” John lied. “Ran that way.” He pointed down the hallway.
Sherlock, however, simply stood there, his eyes locked on his brother’s in an icy glare, which Mycroft returned. Finally, Sherlock broke the silence. “No,” he said simply, before turning and grabbing John’s arm. “Come on, John.” There was an empty carriage by the side of the road with a horse attached to it. John had just enough time to think that it must belong to a guest who had just arrived at the hotel before Sherlock had dragged him to it and scrambled onto the front seat. John climbed up after him as Sherlock picked up the reins and slapped them over the horse’s back. As Sherlock drove them quickly away from the hotel, John turned around and tipped his hat to Mycroft, who stood on the front steps watching them drive out of sight.
“Oh, what is it, sir?” the maid asked sympathetically.
need it for?!”
“I’ve just spoken with Scotland Yard,” he told them. He turned to Sherlock. “I think you were right to suspect the desk clerk, and my boss agreed that Martha’s behaviour was suspicious enough. We have a warrant to search his office.”
“What are you doing in my office?” he asked, voice cold.
John felt a physical pain in his chest at the thought of Sherlock Holmes being so unhappy. “But he wasn’t always that way, was he?”
“He doesn’t even want to be an actor; did you know that? Did that thought ever even occur to your brilliant mind? Did you ever think to ask him if he still wants to be doing this? Yes, perhaps it’s what he wanted when he was sixteen, but that boy doesn’t exist anymore. He’s changed. He grew up and you never noticed.”
John approached the young man, intending to clear his throat to announce his presence before introducing himself, but before he could make a sound, Sherlock stiffened, as if he sensed John’s presence, and whipped around. Bright eyes, which impossibly seemed to be blue, green, and gold all at once, narrowed as they took John in. Then Sherlock opened his mouth, and John was awed by the rich baritone voice that came out of it. “You’re a doctor, always wanted to be one, but now are dissatisfied with what you’ve found to be a completely boring occupation. Just broke up with a beau, too, but you’re hoping to start a new romance soon. In fact, you already have a woman in mind, and you came here hoping to woo her. Interesting. And there’s something else…something strange…you’re not from around here, but where?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes again, before they suddenly widened. “Oh! It’s you, isn’t it?”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” Mr Hudson growled.
John and Sherlock sat and talked for a long time. They talked about any- and everything: John’s job (which Sherlock conceded sounded even more boring than his own), their favourite past-times (John enjoyed hearing Sherlock talk about his love for the violin), their families, their childhoods (John was amused to learn that Sherlock had been obsessed with pirates), their hopes and dreams, their fears. John told Sherlock about Martha, her abusive father, and how worried he was about her. Sherlock confided in John why he had had a hard time opening up to him and why he had been nervous when they first met.
“You’re just nervous,” John said gently. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of.” He took the lock pick from Sherlock. “Here, let me try. You talk me through how to do it.”
John switched the tape player back off and hid it under his bed, before lying back down and beginning once again to murmur to himself. He spoke with renewed confidence about room 416, about checking in tomorrow morning at 9:18, and about Sherlock Holmes already being in the hotel. This time he knew that it had to happen. He had seen the evidence; he knew that he was there. John continued to murmur to himself until he eventually fell asleep, his mind still full of 1912 and Sherlock Holmes. As he slept, a contented smile took over his features, as if his subconscious already knew that he had succeeded.
“I don’t believe you,” Sherlock said, but he couldn’t keep the fear from creeping into the back of his mind, the little voice that told him that Mycroft was always right, that surely he must be right about this, too. “Why – why would he leave?”
“Wonderful?!” John repeated in shock. “Sherlock, there’s a man lying dead. Being excited about it is a bit not good.”
“I’ll never give up trying to take care of and protect you–” Mycroft started, but Sherlock shouted over him.
John finally let out the eye roll he had been holding in. “Yeah, I know it’s a little lame. But hey, we could always go out tonight and have our own celebration.”
Fortunately, Sherlock didn’t seem to actually care about the explanation, as he continued on as if he hadn’t asked John a question in the first place. “I’ve always wanted to try smoking a pipe, but Mycroft won’t let me. May I?”
Short chapter this week, but I hope the content makes up for it, because as the title suggests, we finally get to meet Sherlock! This chapter title is a reference to John's blog post "A Strange Meeting," but if you've seen Somewhere in Time, you'll know why I decided to call it "picturesque" instead!
John watched Sherlock talking animatedly, feeling more besotted by the moment. “It sounds like a dream,” he said when Sherlock stopped for breath. “I love you.”
John found Mike at St. Bart’s, where, according to the inside book jacket of
Sorry :(  Blame the creators of "Somewhere in Time" haha.
Sherlock looked down at their joined hands and mumbled something unintelligible.
“Sherlock and I were raised in a quiet village in the country.” Mycroft dove into his story without preamble, staring down at his umbrella as if speaking to it, rather than to John. “Our parents gave us all the love we could possibly want, but they couldn’t provide us with intellectual stimulation. Sherlock had a happy and carefree childhood, writing plays to perform with his dog, but after Redbeard died, he was lonely and bored. He had no other friends, and he soon became restless and moody. So when I decided to move to London to start a theatre company, Sherlock begged to be allowed to go with me. He was only sixteen years old, but brilliant and talented. Under my tutelage, he began to thrive as an actor. He was happy again. That was nine years ago, and over those nine years, I have nurtured him, cared for him, moulded, taught, and developed him, and he has grown so much.” Mycroft looked up then, looking John in the eye for the first time since he had entered the shed. “I am so proud of how far he has come,” he said, and John was shocked by the amount of emotion in his voice. “But he still has so much untapped potential. He could be the greatest actor of his generation, if he only remains focused on his work. Are you really too dim to understand that?”
“Fine,” Greg snapped, following after her. “I’ll go alone then.”
He ran into the foyer, where Mrs Hudson was just bringing down his bags (he was supposed to be checking out that morning). “Mrs Hudson!” John skidded up to her. “I’m so sorry, but could you actually put my bags back in my room?”
Martha just continued to stare at him with wide, terrified eyes. John sighed. “Is it your father? Did he hurt you again?”
Back in his room, John changed back into his suit and lay back down on the bed. He started the tape player, and then paused, staring at the machine in his hands.
John sighed. “It sounds crazy, you probably wouldn’t believe it if I told you.”
Within moments, John stood at the edge of the roof, looking down at the busy London street below. He felt no fear, only relief. “I’m coming back to you, Sherlock,” he whispered. Then John spread his arms wide and flung himself from the roof. It was a dramatic fall; Sherlock would appreciate that.
John next wandered over to the stage, where the director was critiquing the actors. “This is a comedy, not
“Go on, then,” Wiggins urged him.
After walking aimlessly around the hotel for a bit in an effort to calm himself down, John went back to the Hall of History. He stood in front of Sherlock Holmes’ portrait for a long time, staring at it longingly. Eventually, a couple entered the room, and John, not wanting to seem suspicious by spending too much time looking at the portrait, moved away from it and feigned interest in the items in one of the display cases. That was when he noticed the words on the cover of the large, leather book laying inside the case: “Guest Registration.” A guest registration book! Of course! The hotel had every guest sign the registration book, so, if John had been there in 1912, his name would be in the 1912 book! But where was that book now?
“Martha?” John asked in amazement, suddenly understanding her fear. “His young daughter,” he added to Lestrade.
John buried his face in his hands, horrified at Sherlock’s speech. Lestrade gaped at Sherlock. “You’ve figured these things out?”
John’s days dragged by in an empty blur. Before meeting Sherlock, he had never noticed how dull and grey his life was, but now, without his beautiful ray of sunshine, it was like all the colour had gone out of the world. Despite the pain that inexplicably remained in his leg, John walked by the lake where he and Sherlock had met; instead of the beautiful setting it had created that evening, the shore was barren and cold. He sat on the steps of St. Paul’s, where Sherlock had first told him about his dream of becoming a detective; now, the steps were littered with rubbish. Even the Hall of History seemed darker, although Sherlock’s portrait still glowed bright. John stared at it for a long time, remembering the night it was taken, before approaching it, reaching out towards it as if to caress Sherlock’s cheek, and finally leaning into it, resting his head against Sherlock’s shoulder in the closest thing to an embrace possible.
“You didn’t leave when you got married, then?” John asked.
On the wall was a photograph of a young man. John found himself drawn to it, and without quite realizing what was happening, he crossed the room, needing to be closer to the portrait. As he got closer, his face lit up in a smile.
Lestrade smiled at him. “What can I do for you?”
John looked up to ask Doyle for an explanation, but before he could open his mouth, he noticed a beautiful violin lying on a table next to a record player. Book temporarily forgotten, he knelt in front of the table and stared in awe at the beautiful instrument.
Sherlock’s head snapped up, eyes bright with excitement again, but before he could run off, Lestrade gave him a stern look. “No more running impulsively into things, though. If you want to help with this case, you need to stay calm and follow my lead.”
Mycroft anxiously hurried down the hallway of the Baker Street Hotel. He had woken that morning to find Sherlock missing, and suspecting where he had gone, had immediately transferred trains to return to London. He could only hope that he was in time to find his little brother before the boy did something truly foolish.
John smiled at the boy. “There’s no need to apologize. And thank you very much.” He looked down at the key and felt a rush of relief. It was for room 416. “Thank you very, very much!”
Mike studied John for a moment, before seeming to make up his mind. “Ok,” he said, setting down his teacup. “Listen carefully.” And he began with his tale: “I was in Venice a couple years ago, staying in a very old hotel. I mean, very old. The structure, the furnishings, everything; the whole atmosphere was aged. In my room, it felt like it was a century or more earlier.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I promise we'll actually meet Sherlock very soon! See you next week ;)
Martha pulled away from him, looking like she was trying to disappear into the chair. “Nothing’s wrong,” she whispered, sounding close to tears. “Please, just go away.” She buried her face in her arms and turned her back on John, effectively ending the conversation.
, he thought.
Ignoring the lump in his throat, John lunged forward and kissed Sherlock again, deeper this time. And this time, Sherlock didn’t hesitate, but kissed back with enthusiasm. When they pulled back from the kiss, they stared into each other’s eyes lovingly, still caressing each other’s cheeks. “Shall we go back to the hotel?” John whispered. Sherlock nodded, and, their arms still around each other, they walked through the park in the cool dawn, a gorgeous sunrise to their left guiding their way.
, John reminded himself, putting the phone down without placing the call.
hurt him!”
Now I have an idea to float by you: I am going to really miss this universe, and I received a couple comments last week saying the same thing, so I am now considering writing some "missing scene" one-shots to go along with this story. I want to be clear: I am a slow writer, and I need to feel inspired by the idea to enjoy writing, so I can't make any promises. However, if anyone has ideas for missing scenes in this universe you would like to see written, please feel free to let me know, and I may write them (but again, no promises).

“But what about now?” John asked worriedly. “You don’t believe that, do you?”
John looked down. It was the woman from the dressing room, now fully clothed in a gaudy purple dress and hat. “Hello,” he said politely.
“Oh, dear,” tutted Mrs Hudson. “You look awful. When was the last time you ate?” She felt his forehead as if checking for a fever, then hoisted him up out of his chair. John let her manhandle him over to the bed and lay him down. “Now you just rest here,” she said. “I’m going to go get you some tea and a bite to eat. I’ll be back soon.” And with one last worried look at John, Mrs Hudson left the room.
He ran through the hotel, out the back door, and down the porch stairs, then made his way across the back garden to Mrs Hudson’s bungalow. He pounded on the door and windows, making as much racket as possible. “Mrs Hudson! MRS HUDSON!” he called repeatedly. “Wake up!”
“We’re going to visit my friend, Wiggins,” Sherlock said suddenly. “You were wondering why we’re going to Whitechapel.”
John moved about the backyard of his parents’ home, joking with his mates, hugging extended family, and shaking the hands of family friends that his parents had insisted on inviting to his graduation party. It was mingling to the extreme, and it was exhausting.
“Why?” Sherlock demanded. “Is he the one?”
John looked at him curiously. “Why are you an actor if you hate it so much?”
Later that night, Sherlock Holmes sat in his hotel room, room 221B, staring into his mirror without really seeing his reflection, a dreamy smile on his face. From the main room of the suite, he could hear Mycroft talking to the maid, Anthea, most likely giving her some sort of instructions, but he wasn’t listening to their conversation; he was too busy thinking about John Watson. John Watson, of origins so mysterious that even Sherlock couldn’t figure out where he had come from. John Watson, who didn’t allow Mycroft to scare him away. John Watson, who had come a long way just to be with
, thought John.
His hunger now long forgotten, John found himself becoming increasingly obsessed with the image of Sherlock Holmes. He stood in the Hall of History, staring at the photograph, completely entranced. He tried to distract himself by going to dinner, but found that his mind kept returning to the beautiful young man.
Undeterred by Mycroft’s threat, and figuring the Holmeses would be dining in the hotel restaurant, John headed there that evening. Walking into the restaurant (the maître d’ let him in without question when he said he was dining with Sherlock Holmes), John was once again overwhelmed by the glamour of the hotel’s guests, wearing fancy evening wear and eating meals that looked like they cost the monthly rent on John’s flat. John looked around him in wonder as he wandered through the room in search of Sherlock.
Sherlock looked up at him from where he was sat on the floor, wrapped in a bed sheet and clutching a pipe, face covered in tears. “John’s gone,” he choked out. Mycroft’s anger must have shown on his face, because Sherlock quickly added, “But he didn’t want to leave! We were going to get married! We were so h-happy!” His breath started to hitch. “And th-then he j-just disappeared!” Sherlock began to cry in earnest, his too-thin body wracked with violent sobs.
“Yes. Sherlock,” John shook his head. “You just solved the Jack the Ripper mystery. No one’s been able to solve that before. It’s legendary.”
John stood up slowly, gingerly flexing his muscles. He felt a little strange, but was glad to feel that his journey hadn’t injured or harmed him in any way. He was just making his way over to the mirror, to make sure he hadn’t accidentally left an eyebrow or something behind in 1980, when he heard a woman humming in the adjoining room. He froze, then came to his senses quickly enough to dart through a curtain into the closet that lay behind it just before the woman entered the room.
“This could be very nice,” John replied, looking around the room approvingly. “Very nice indeed.” It was perhaps a bit stark – plain white walls, dark blue carpet, little decoration beyond the dark floral curtains – but the bed looked comfortable enough, and there was a telly in the corner. It would meet John’s needs just fine.
century? I closed my eyes and started telling myself, ‘It’s 1578, I’m in the hotel De Vecchio.’ I spelled out all the details for myself and did it again and again.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly back in his comfort zone. “She was horribly boring. I only agreed to dance with her to get away from my brother’s nagging. He wanted me to eat dinner.”
Mr Hudson turned his glare on the boy, who cowered into the corner. “I’ll deal with you later.”
Mrs Hudson smiled and gave a little shrug. “I guess I just can’t imagine ever leaving. I’ve been here nearly my entire life.”
John opened his mouth to ask Sherlock where he wanted to walk, when the front door of the hotel opened and a furious-looking Mycroft stepped out. “William Sherlock Scott Holmes!” he exclaimed. “I won’t ask you again. Get away from that man.”
With a growing sense of excitement, John made his preparations. He found a vintage clothing store and bought a suit that the clerk assured him was in style in 1912. He gave himself a haircut, using old photographs for comparison as he styled his hair the way it was worn then. Looking at his reflection, with his new suit and his new haircut, John couldn’t resist the temptation to practice what he would say to Sherlock Holmes when he finally met him. John tipped his hat at his reflection and said, using the cocky voice he usually used when picking up women, “Good evening, Mr Holmes. You don’t know me, but you will.” John paused. That had sounded stupid. Had that voice always sounded stupid? Perhaps it was simply that Sherlock Holmes was too good for the “pick-up line voice.” John tried again, this time going for sincere. “Good evening, Mr Holmes. You don’t know me…but you will.” Was that any better? Maybe a little bit?
The boy’s eyes widened, and he scampered off to the side of the room. “Good lad,” said Lestrade, and they started searching the office.
John turned the book over to see the title:
Mycroft looked down, studying the handle of his umbrella, as he often did. “Presumably it was your…confession during act one that drove him away.” He looked up at Sherlock then, and his expression was cold. “Did you really think he would love you back? You, a silly, stupid, obnoxious little boy? He probably heard your little speech and fled.”
That wasn’t as reassuring as Mrs Hudson seemed to think it was. If the murder had happened “many years” ago, how old was Sherlock Holmes now? “So when did this all happen?” John asked.
“Hi, are you Mr Doyle?” John asked.
John could only nod, his throat suddenly tight at the prospect of getting to actually hear Sherlock Holmes play the violin. It was more than he could possibly have hoped for.
“Since I was met with a very unsettling sight the last time I entered a room you were in unannounced,” Mycroft replied with a meaningful look at his brother. Sherlock felt himself blush.
They returned to their breakfast, and the conversation moved to other topics.
Doyle led John to a storage room. “I have a lot of his possessions. He was the last in his family and had no real friends, so I was the only one he had to leave anything to.”
John shook his head. “You and your obsession with that show. You know that time travel isn’t real, right?”
“Well, I wouldn’t say
John was somewhat alarmed to hear that Sherlock was skipping dinner and wondered if he skipped meals often, if that was why he was so thin. However, John decided, that was a conversation for another time. “Right,” he said, bringing the conversation back to Sherlock’s question, “so I decided to save you from having to dance with her any more. I hope I’m less boring than she was?” Sherlock smiled down at him in confirmation. “But that’s not the only reason I wanted to dance with you,” John continued, lowering his voice seductively. “I’ve come an awfully long way to see you. You see, that was a pretty brilliant display down by the lake, when you figured out all that stuff about me.” Sherlock looked pleased and a little surprised at the praise, a light blush colouring his pale cheeks. “But you did get something wrong,” John continued. He leaned up towards Sherlock’s ear, going a little on his tiptoes, and lowered his voice to a whisper. “It wasn’t a woman I came here to woo.”
“John Watson,” John responded, making a mental note that he was supposed to call his new acquaintance “Lestrade,” not “Greg.”
John nodded, holding Sherlock’s gaze for a moment in an attempt to provide him with some silent comfort. Then he left, leaving the brothers alone. As soon as he exited the room, he heard Mycroft’s voice. “I’ve told you before. Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.” John clenched his fists. It took every ounce of his strength to resist going back there and decking bloody Mycroft Holmes.
John started grunting around the gag, knocking his shoes against the wall, doing anything he could to try to make enough noise to alert Sherlock to where he was.
Sherlock then turned to John abruptly. “Your turn, John.”
. John Watson, who had wanted to dance with Sherlock. John Watson, who had wanted to
“What did you want to talk about?” Sherlock asked. John just walked over to him, staring up at him heatedly and licking his lips. Sherlock blushed and swallowed hard, but he didn’t back away. John gently grasped Sherlock’s chin in one hand and angled his head down. His heart began to beat heavily as he felt Sherlock’s skin heat up further beneath his touch. He brought his other hand to the back of Sherlock’s neck, tangling his fingers in the curls at Sherlock’s nape. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut. His lips were parted, and he was panting slightly. “Oh my God,” Sherlock whispered in between pants. “What’s happening?”
“Oh, don’t be boring, John,” Sherlock whined. “People die every day. Are murdered every day. But this time, the culprit didn’t get away with it.” He rubbed his hands together. “We discovered the body, and now we can solve the case!”
“I’m so sick of you treating me like a child! I’m 25 years old! I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!” Sherlock was seething. He glared furiously at Mycroft, who glared back.
“This was the only piece of music he ever recorded.” Doyle placed the record on the record player and started the music.
He put on another burst of speed, and John grasped his hand tighter and allowed him to lead him through the back streets of London, trusting that he knew where he was going. Finally, the Thames came into sight, and John saw Tower Bridge ahead of them. He and Sherlock ran onto the bridge, pushing people out of their way as they dashed across to the south side of the river. John spared a glance behind them as they left the bridge and joined the bustle of activity on the streets of Southwark: the police were nowhere in sight; they seemed to have lost them. Sherlock must have come to the same conclusion, because a moment later he let go of John’s hand and collapsed against a wall, gasping for breath.
John returned to his room just long enough to grab a torch and change his clothes, in case it was dirty in the attic, and then he rode the elevator to the top floor. From there, he wandered around until he found a door labelled “attic,” which was mercifully unlocked, and climbed the staircase behind it.
John watched Sherlock walk out into the street, looking around himself in what appeared to be nervousness. John thought that was odd, until he realized that Sherlock was acting. Sherlock stopped a gentleman outside the brothel, and when he spoke to him, he spoke loud enough for John to hear.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the dressing room door. Sherlock’s head shot up as hope surged through him. He rushed to open the door, but was dismayed to find not John, but Mycroft stood in the doorway.
Not wanting Sherlock to feel uncomfortable, John wracked his brain for something to say to distract him from what had just passed between them. It occurred to him that Sherlock had just done all that running after skipping the previous two meals. “When was the last time you ate?” he asked.
“Yes, dear, what –“ Mrs Hudson started to ask, but John interrupted her.
“Oh for God’s sake!” Sherlock exclaimed, suddenly more indignant than nervous. “How many times do I have to tell you? Of course I want this!” He threw off his shirt and pulled John up for a kiss.
Mike stared at him for a few moments, mouth agape. Finally, he spoke. “You’re right, it does sound crazy.”
“Only you can know for sure,” Mycroft replied. “But as you seem too obtuse to figure it out, I’d rather not risk it.”
At 1 o’clock, John was stood outside the hotel, waiting for Sherlock. He didn’t have to wait long before Sherlock appeared, his face breaking out in a grin when he spotted John, who grinned back. He quickly made his way down the front stairs and over to John. John offered him his arm, and to his delight, Sherlock took it, blushing slightly. Sherlock looked down at him, and his lips twitched up into an amused smile. “What have you done to your face?”
They moved in simultaneously and kissed each other. Sherlock tasted of tea and sweetness.
“East End, Whitechapel,” was Sherlock’s succinct answer.
Heart pounding, he burst into room 221B. One glance around the room told him everything he needed to know: Sherlock had reunited with John Watson, who had gotten his way with his baby brother before disappearing. Mycroft’s blood began to boil. “Oh, Sherlock,” he sighed. “What have you done?”
John felt like his heart was splitting in two at the thought of Sherlock going so far away, but he just nodded stoically.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So if it’s so difficult for you, why do you work here, if you don’t mind my asking?” John asked her once they were in the elevator.
John caressed Sherlock’s jawline. “Do you want this, Sherlock?”
John wandered aimlessly around the ground floor of the hotel until he came upon a room with a sign over the door reading “Hall of History” in fancy gold letters.
Wiggins sighed at his defeat, but he accepted the gift of Sherlock’s coins with a grin and a “thank you” all the same.
Suddenly, John felt a tap on his shoulder. He startled slightly, and looked up to find a large man in a dark suit standing over him. The man handed him a piece of paper; looking down, John saw that it was a note, written in neat, precise handwriting. “Sir,” it read. “I must speak to you immediately. This is a matter of life and death, so do not fail me. The guard will take you to me. I suggest you do not resist him.” It was signed simply, “M,” but John had a pretty good idea who that was. His heart beginning to pound in anticipation, he stood and gave the guard a short nod, then allowed the guard to lead him out of the theatre.
He noticed one couple that were less fancily dressed than the other guests and didn’t seem to be eating much, and he realized with a start that it was Greg and Maud. “We couldn’t even afford to stay in this posh place,” John overheard Maud saying as he walked past the table. “This whole holiday is a disaster; we should never have come in the first place. Why don’t you ever listen to me?” Greg clearly wasn’t listening then, instead staring at something on the other side of the room. John followed his gaze, and saw Mycroft Holmes sitting alone at a table for two. So Mycroft was there, but where was Sherlock?
Sherlock looked surprised. “Why not?”
“You don’t remember…” John shook his head. “Okay, you need to eat.”
“He died that night?!” John’s shock must have been evident in his voice, because Doyle finally seemed to believe him. He opened the door wider. “Won’t you come in?”
Sherlock jumped up from where he had been crouched down, examining the floor. “I can pick locks.”
“I don’t think you understand, Watson,” Mycroft said. “I have more power at my disposal than you can possibly imagine, and I won’t hesitate to bring down the whole of the British government on you if necessary. This is your final warning. Leave my brother alone.” He picked up his umbrella. “Good-day.” He turned and walked away, leaving John seething but still determined.
After finding his new room, which was very nice and just as ornate as the rest of the hotel, John set about getting ready for his date with Sherlock. He headed to the shared bathroom down the hall, where he showered and shaved; he struggled with using a straight razor, and by the time he was finished, he had cut his face in several places. Most of the cuts were small enough to be barely noticeable, but when he tried to shave his upper lip, he made several deeper cuts. Grimacing, John covered the worst cuts with bits of toilet paper to stop the bleeding. He examined his reflection with dismay.
Hoping it would have the desired effect, John pulled Sherlock Holmes’ pipe out of his pocket and showed it to Doyle. He was not disappointed. “Where did you get that?” Doyle asked, sounding shocked.
Sherlock rushed off the stage as soon as the curtain closed after the cast’s first bow, leaving his fellow actors flustered that he had only taken one curtain call. But Sherlock had far more important things on his mind. At one point during the play, John had disappeared from the audience. Between acts, Sherlock had sent Anthea to see if she could find him; he now sought her out. He found her on the way to his dressing room.
“Uh, I’m looking for Mr Sherlock Holmes, please,” John stuttered out as the woman made kissing noises at him.
Sherlock blushed at the endearment, but still managed a haughty, “I wasn’t worried.”
John didn’t understand what this meant, but since Sherlock didn’t seem inclined to elaborate, John shrugged and looked around at where they were now driving. Sherlock had turned onto a narrow street – it was the dirtiest street yet, and the smell was horrible. Dirty people in tattered clothes sat huddled by the side of the street, watching the carriage as it passed them with hungry eyes. John suddenly realized. “Your friend is homeless, isn’t he?”
Soon Sherlock was clutching at John and moaning again, or else chanting, “John, John, John,” in time with John’s thrusts. John was close, but he wanted Sherlock to come first. He changed his angle so that he could hit Sherlock’s prostate, and Sherlock let out a loud wail. It took only a few more hard thrusts into Sherlock’s prostate before Sherlock was coming between them, screaming John’s name into his neck. The feeling of Sherlock pulsating around him was all it took to send John over the edge, and his vision went white as he experienced the most intense orgasm of his entire life.
Sherlock cut him off abruptly. “What’s your name?”
John saw the pavement coming up to meet him, but before he hit it, his vision went white. Sherlock appeared out of the white fog, looking young, beautiful, and vibrant in his suit from the play. He held out his hand to John, and John took it. Then, feeling content and secure, hand-in-hand with his love once more, he allowed Sherlock to lead him to the other side.
“No, Greg, I suspect you do not!” she snapped.
“No, I continued working here even then.” Mrs Hudson made a face. “That was almost as much of an area of contention between my husband and I as my keeping my name. I go by ‘Mrs’, but Hudson is my maiden name.”
“Obviously,” Sherlock scoffed.
The next morning, John returned to the Hall of History once more. Sherlock Holmes’ intelligent-looking eyes stared out at him from the portrait. “The way you look at me, it makes me feel like you know everything about me,” John told him, not caring that he probably would seem crazy if anyone saw him talking to a photograph. “I want to know everything about you, too.” And suddenly, John knew what to do.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Really, it was obvious from the traces of cocaine and blood on the floor, the ledger books, and everything we already knew.”
Sherlock gasped, Mycroft’s words feeling like a dagger to his chest. He furiously blinked back the tears that prickled at the corners of his eyes. Of course Mycroft was right, of course someone like John could never love someone like him. He had been stupid, so, so stupid! But then Sherlock remembered the time they had spent together. He remembered dancing with John, and how John had said that he had come a long way to meet Sherlock. He remembered John coming to his suite to ask him on a walk, and John worrying about him not eating. He remembered the day they had spent together – the laughing, the flirting, the hand-holding, John’s praise. He remembered how upset John had looked when he had said he was leaving London that night. He remembered John kissing him. He remembered the look on John’s face when he had come backstage after Sherlock had confessed his love to him. And suddenly, Sherlock knew that for once, Mycroft was wrong. John did love him.
“Who?” John asked, and when Sherlock didn’t answer, he pushed, “Me?”
Sherlock swallowed and nodded frantically. “Yes, John, please.”
Will Mike have the answer John is looking for? Find out next week!
“Martha,” the little girl whispered.
Sherlock immediately looked panicked. “What is it? Did I do something wrong?”
John couldn’t believe his luck. “Then you’re just our man,” he said. “My friend and I were up in the attic –” Lestrade gave him a funny look. “Just looking around,” John explained. “And we came across a dead body. It looks like he was stabbed. I left my friend with the body while I came to get the police.”
