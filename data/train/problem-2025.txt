John smiled, glad Sherlock could joke a little.  “Hardly old.  And hardly boring.  You love being the Queen’s favourite advisor, gleaning information from the network you have developed.”
“You did act up when Irene or Janine were around,” Sherlock purred, kissing along John’s jaw.  “But I was just as bad when you were dating somebody, doing everything I could to disrupt your dates.”
He could only smile weakly, resting a hand along Sherlock’s cheek.  “It was so, so good.  Perfect.  I feel fine.”
He fell back against the pillows, panting, exhausted, but his head light and body still tingling with aftershocks of pleasure.  He closed his eyes, vaguely aware of Sherlock throwing what was left of the icy condom into the bowl and crawling to lie beside John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I know a few.  But that wasn’t a Christmas carol.”
Sherlock grinned.  “Yes, embarrassingly fast.  I woke up before you, after all.”
“The buzzer.  Sally is signalling us,” Sherlock said to John, who was already pulling his clothing straight.
“As if you are one to talk.  You chase criminals in bespoke suits and Italian shoes, even when there’s six feet of snow out there,” John shot back, but with little heat.  It was an old debate.
Sherlock pushed him on to his back, his eyes gleaming.  “Can I touch you?  Everywhere?  I’ve been wanting to for so long.”
John ran his fingers over it, smearing it over his skin.  Sherlock always seemed to cum more than John did, and he idly wondered if it was because Sherlock was a few years younger, or was it due to him not jerking off as often as John did.  John still did it most mornings in the shower on his own, but doubted Sherlock did.
Sherlock had turned just then, and seen the look on John’s face before he could change it to a more neutral one.  His eyes widened, and he seemed to freeze in shock.
Entering the flat, he could only shake his head.  The fireplace was blazing, and Sherlock had pulled his chair directly in front of it.  His legs were splayed, his feet close to each side of the hearth, and his body buried under the largest blanket they owned.
It was even easier with men, doing the things that he liked and just fine tuning it to each guy.  He got good at sucking cock, and occasionally bottomed with the guys he liked the most.
Arching an eyebrow, John pinned him with steady gaze. “What about Irene Adler?  Something was going on between you.”  It had bothered him like crazy, and he had been so jealous.  Counting those stupid moaning text alerts.
“I trained for a few weeks in Canada one winter.  Hypothermia is a risk, especially for someone as slim as you are.”
“Let me do that for you,” John said, chuckling, and hopped up on to the vanity.  He spread his legs wide and guided Sherlock to stand in front of him.  He undid the crooked bow tie and concentrated on tying it correctly.  “You need to calm down.”
That got a weak chuckle, and Sherlock pulled back, looking a bit more himself.  “No, no.  What’s the point.  He will leave soon of his own accord.  But what did you pull me away for?  Was it actually something?”
John sat up, and stared down at his boyfriend.  He lifted up his wet hand and defiantly licked it clean.  When he was done, he leaned over and gave Sherlock a deep, raunchy kiss.
John was distracted from his thoughts when Sherlock reached over into the bowl and pulled out an ice cube.  It was something they had played around with last summer, but hardly something new.  John relaxed, reaching over for one of the towels they kept nearby.  Something else they’d learned in the last year.
“Not at first.  But by the time we finally... yeah, so, so often.”  Sherlock admitted, his skin flushing a bit.
Mycroft turned to face his brother, his easy smile slipping, his lips pressing together into a firm line.  “Sherlock.  Or do you prefer to go by William Scott these days?”  There was a bit of bite to his tone, a flash of challenge in his eyes.
“You’re doing so good, baby.  You feel so hot and tight,” John said, pressing a few kisses on Sherlock’s upper back.
“You really should come round soon for supper.  Mother and Father haven’t seen you for a decade, I should think,” Mycroft said, and started towards the door when Claire waved to signal his carriage was out front.  “And bring Dr. Watson, of course.”
“Mrs Hudson! Doctor Watson will be taking the room upstairs,” Sherlock called out after her.
The ice in the bowl was melting too, and Sherlock fished out a couple smaller pieces.  John sighed, half-relieved that the ice was almost gone.  As pleasurable as this had been, he had been aroused for a long, long time, and just wanted to cum.
With his hands still on Sherlock’s head, John followed his request.  This was one of his favourite things, knowing he didn’t have to hold back, that Sherlock could take it all.  He sucked and flicked his tongue as John thrust into his mouth, getting closer and closer.  He came hard, pushed in all the way.  Sherlock took it all, swallowing it down.
“Well, Mycroft is at least seeing the full scope of Sherlock’s success and influence here.  When they do talk in private, I think it will go better than their last meeting,” John said.
Grabbing a damp facecloth, John cleaned up his hands and Sherlock as well as he could.  Most of the lube was mopped up anyways.  They could take a hot bath later on.
“We will need to share all those old fantasies,” Sherlock said, sitting up and stretching.  “Quick shower?”
Pulling him down into a kiss, John smiled against his lips.  “Yes.”
Crawling over his prone flatmate, John grinned down at him.  “I vote for testing it out now,” he whispered, and gave Sherlock a very thorough kiss.  It felt good when Sherlock groaned in response, his legs and arms coming around John to get him even closer.
John felt a flush of pride, standing at Sherlock’s side.  He knew in that moment that he could handle this.  “Good to meet you.  Enjoy the party,” he said to Mycroft.  He gave Sherlock’s forearm a comforting squeeze before letting go.
Sherlock was breathtakingly gorgeous like this.  Completely naked, his ivory skin smooth and perfect, a little flushed in places.  His hair mussed from when they were kissing in the kitchen, before moving to the bedroom.  His knees spread wide on the sheets, giving John the best access he could.
John thought, getting off the sofa and being drawn to Sherlock like he was a magnet.  Sherlock held out his hand when he was near, and tugged John towards his bedroom.  Arousal kicked up hard inside John at that.  Who would have thought they would be together in Sherlock’s bed even yesterday?
John eventually pulled back, taking Sherlock’s hand as they walked back to the house.  They sat close together after that, on the sofa as they sipped tea to warm up.  John wanted more but didn’t want to scare Sherlock, or screw up their friendship.
John sighed.  “But not for ages!  With you being away, me moving out, Mary, and all that.”
Mycroft was looking at him as well.  Sherlock considered if he had changed as much.  Mycroft likely had memories of him as a college graduate, all lanky limbs and a skinny, boyish face.  Or that horrible time Mycroft had appeared in the opium den, his face tight with disgust.  Sherlock had been skinny, unwashed, and sweaty.  Hair tangled and dirty, face unshaven, clothing in rags.  He doubted the quick glances Mycroft had of him more recently in London society had erased that image from his mind.
They towelled off and changed the bedsheets, cuddling together under the covers.
“Yes.  No sex or as much as you want. I just want to be with you,” John said, and meant it. He hasn’t dated anyone for a few months.  Maybe it was a part of getting older, and not needing sex as much.  He could take care of his own needs.
“And mine to consulting detectives,” John replied.
“Yes, but I have an ‘unfortunate romantic attachment’ to you as well.  Would that bother you?” John grinned, unable to resist teasing him.
But instead it was a calm, serene setting.  Mycroft rose from a sofa as they drew near.  “Goodnight, Miss Davenport.  Good to meet you.”
Nodding, she left and they heard her descending back to her flat with a mutual sigh of relief.
“Sherlock still plays his violin, and we go to performances like that quite often,” John said, but then wondered if he had sounded too familiar.
John ran a soothing hand down his sweat-damp back, Sherlock curling up into his touch like a cat.  He loved seeing Sherlock in this state.  So aroused and responsive, totally focused on the moment and the sensations John was immersing him in.
“I do love it,” Sherlock confessed, his eyes gleaming.  “She has distanced herself from many of the idiots and leeches that were around her-“
Rolling his eyes, John again tried to keep it together as he bent to pick up the gloves Sherlock had dropped on to the floor, and set them on a side table.  He helped Sherlock take off his long coat, and hung up.  “Why don’t you take off your shoes here and go upstairs to warm up?”
Sherlock let out a defeated sigh.  “To insult me to my face, it seems.  He was quite verbose.”
Sherlock’s expression shifted to one of concern the longer the silence continued.  “Oh John, forget I said that. I’m an idiot.  You are still welcome to stay here, just as friends, of course-“
John knew the garden well, and cut through it.  He headed to a deep area with a willow tree and a bench.  Sherlock’s favourite spot.
After all that build up, it wasn’t long before Sherlock was shuddering and moaning beneath him.   John came seconds after that, pressed hard against Sherlock’s beautiful ass.
The biscuits did smell good, and John carefully took a bite of the warm buttery treat, but still managed to get some crumbs on his jumper.  He brushed them away as he popped the rest into his mouth.  As he chewed, he thought he heard an unusual sound, and gazed over at Sherlock.
This was it.  Sherlock and Mycroft standing alone, in a sea of people.  Their conversation was intense, their eyes only on each other.  People around them could sense they wouldn’t welcome interruptions, and let them be.
Claire graciously escorted Mycroft back to the lobby, and staff were given orders to prepare his carriage.  She entertained him with polite chit chat.
He awoke later, not really sure how much time had passed.  Blinking, he rubbed his face and glanced around.  Sherlock was mostly in shadow, the firelight flickering over him, and he seemed to be looking his way.
“I’m rather ‘bothered’ by you right now,” Sherlock said, his tone lowering.  He rocked his hips, a distinct hardness brushing against his own.
Sherlock rested his head on John’s chest.  John was stroking a lazy hand through his messy curls, enjoying how relaxed Sherlock was against him.  He was practically purring.
Sherlock shuddered beneath him, his ass tightening around John in a way that made him want to move fast and hard.  Thrusting into him, pounding into him, seeing how much he could take.  Make him cum fast and hard.
Sparks were there right away, even if it was a bit awkward at first.  Sherlock hadn’t kissed anyone for a long time.  John was quite expert at it, stepping closer and tilting Sherlock’s face to the perfect angle.  Arms wrapped tight around each other, they shared kiss after kiss on that snowy lane.
He started with his neck, kissing slowly all over it, like he had wanted to for ages.  By the time he kissed Sherlock’s collarbone, he was already breathing faster, and shifting restlessly on the bed.  John claimed his arms next, stroking his smooth skin, kissing down along it.  Licking the thin skin of his inner elbow, feeling the pulse beneath his lips jump.  Massaging his hands, those long fingers.
“The one that won him the Alhumbert Prize?” his mother asked, leaning forward.
Within a few minutes, they were lying together in an exhausted but satisfied heap.  Sherlock traced a hand down John’s sweat-slick back, and John pressed a open-mouth kiss against his neck.
“I love you,” Sherlock said simply.
“OK, OK,” Sherlock chuckled, his eyes sated, but happy.  “I never thought sex would be like this.”
The letter was short and simple.  A bald request to meet with Sherlock William Scott Holmes.  Signed Mycroft Holmes, with all his titles and honorariums.  The use of his full name proved he knew Sherlock Holmes was the medium William Scott.
“You are thinking far too hard,” Sherlock said softly, kissing close to his ear.  “Did you change your mind about this?”
“So, you’ll move back?  With Rosie?” Sherlock pulled back to say, his eyes glowing but still a glimmer of doubt there.
“We’ll take things slow.  For all our sakes,” Sherlock said softly.
Something deep inside John surged, a wave of emotion, and he urged Sherlock upwards into a tight hug.
Sherlock had supported the Queen, discouraging her contact with those he knew were awful, and encouraging the best and brightest to be with her more often.  They formed connections with her, but also with each other, and Sherlock was already seeing the results.
John sighed, looking up at the ceiling.  “Yes, I had a lot of partners before you, and enjoyed sex.  But you’ve spoiled me for anyone else.”
“This next election will be quite a shock to Mycroft and his party,” Sherlock chuckled.
But Sherlock pulled away, pushing John on to his back and practically diving under the covers.  John could only groan again, pushing his hands into Sherlock’s hair as he took him all in.  It was shockingly intimate, entirely unexpected, and had John cumming hard within a couple minutes.
He had never expected this, Sherlock taking the lead.  He thought he would be the one making Sherlock comfortable, like a shy virgin or something.  But it made sense.  Sherlock was satisfying his curiosity about John’s body, in a way a friend couldn’t.
Sherlock scoffed.  “How can she even run like that in those heels? In that narrow skirt?”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around him, pulling him closer.  “I won’t let you get bored.”  He kissed John, his eyes warming.
Sherlock seemed bewildered, looking up at John and blinking slowly.  He was not himself.  It sent a surge of protectiveness through John to see him like that.  Clamping a hand under Sherlock’s arm, he hauled him to his feet.  “Please excuse us, Mr. Holmes.  If you go back to the ballroom, Miss Davenport will see to anything you need.”
The comment had Sherlock locking eyes with his brother.  Mycroft had only been shown the main floor of the main section of the house, not his private wing.  How had he found out about that?  He knew the staff wouldn’t talk about him, they were too loyal and professional.  There was only one way Mycroft could know about it.
“Yes, your mother still enjoys all the plays and concerts,” his father added.
Those sage green eyes flicked upwards to meet John’s, a smirk on his lips.  “My libido seems to be limited to army doctors that I live with.”
Sherlock moved off, stroking him as he moved his talented mouth to his balls, taking them inside.  John was soon arching off the bed, panting in pleasure.
Gradually, John could feel him relaxing, becoming more himself.  “Do you go to the manor house still?”
“He obviously wants something from you, or he wouldn’t request a meeting,” John had said gently, holding Sherlock close, stroking his back.
He had gotten his reputation in the army as ‘Three Continents Watson’ because of it.  Many of his female partners said they had never had good oral sex before, as most men didn’t really understand the female body.  He took his time, learning what each woman liked, and took great pleasure in giving her orgasm after orgasm.  He usually would just stroke himself as they came, getting off on it.
“He likely had time to rethink his strategy.  I don’t doubt he will try to charm us if we do deign to go there for dinner.  Lure me in with the only carrot he has; familial access.”
“How are you tonight?” John said, his tone friendly.
John was shovelling hard after the latest snow dump, feeling warm and even a bit sweaty from the exertion.  The snow banks are almost as tall as he is now, making it even more work, having to lift the shovel higher and fling the snow on top.  He’s got a rhythm going, and doesn’t even notice that Sherlock has returned, and prior to entering their building, has stepped close to tell John something.  Instead, he gets a big shovelful of snow right in the face.
“I think you’re OK,” John said after a couple minutes, standing back up.  He extended a helping hand towards Sherlock.
There are many things that should never go near a vagina, and ice lollies are up there. The ice can stick to the delicate skin of the vagina and cause real trauma and damage.
John was breathing faster from all this attention already, and he let out a small moan.  “Yes, yes, Sherlock.  You can do anything you want.”
Sherlock clamped his teeth together, glaring up at his brother.  “You can leave.  The sooner, the better.”
He was about to scramble off him, kneeling again, when Sherlock rocked upwards, pressing back against John.  He moaned himself, pushing back.  They started rocking together.  John’s hands went to Sherlock’s hips, dry humping against him, kissing against his back.  Sherlock was moaning softly, his hips moving too.  John realized he was rocking against the bed, and shifted to be in even tighter contact.
-A/N:  A slightly different ending to ‘The Lying Detective...
Sherlock smiled back, his eyes dipping down to John’s mouth before meeting his again.  “I’m sure we can figure it all out,” he said softly, “but there’s just one thing I should let you know.  Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.”
Both John and Sherlock looked away, shifting uncomfortably.  She just chuckled, picking up her recycling and stepping out of the door.
That had John bursting out laughing.  “Is that going to be your new excuse not to dress properly for this weather?”
-"It's not the size of the boat nor the motion of the ocean, it's whether or not the Captain can stay in port long enough for all the passengers to get off." is from someecards.com.
That whisper made Sherlock let out a panting gasp, his chest heaving, turning his head to look at John.  Still stroking.
“Um-“ John started sleepily, turning his head.  His words were cut off by a deep kiss.
-Merry Christmas!  Happy holidays!  Happy New Year!
From then on, after rugby practices, he would check out other men in the showers.  He looked the same.  Eventually, on a drunk night, a friend explained it all.  John was not a grower.  His erect penis got slightly thicker, but did not change much in length.  After that, he kept sex focused on his partner, hiding his cock from direct view and wandering hands.  He developed his techniques.
A few minutes later, Mycroft turned away, walking through the main floor of their wing.  He saw many of Sherlock’s things scattered around, like thick books on science, and a beautiful violin.  But there were also novels and tomes on subjects like history, which he knew his brother abhorred.  A large sofa had rumpled blankets on it, with two sets of dirty dishes from the evening meal waiting for a maid to clear away.
“Anytime,” John said, and meant it.  He was still working through his emotions over everything that had happened, but his anger towards Sherlock was gone.  He could see that part more clearly, at least.
As he watched, John’s eyes widened slightly, and then dipped downwards.  Staring at Sherlock’s lips in a way that made him feel self-conscious.  Making him feel desperate to lick them.
Sherlock looked a bit lost, the hurt so evident in his eyes.  He shook his head.
“He used to work here, but doesn’t any longer.  Is that correct?”
Sherlock lifted his head, blinking a few times.  Adjusting from looking through the microscope to looking around the room normally.
John knew that look.  After being lovers over a year, he knew when Sherlock had a crazy, sexual idea.  Something new he wanted to try.  For all his previous inexperience, Sherlock seemed determined to make up for it now.  Trying everything and anything John would allow.  It had led to some spectacular mess ups, a few minor injuries, and some truly mind-blowing orgasms.  Usually John welcomed that maniacal look, knowing he was in for another one of Sherlock’s adventures.
But John didn’t get the message.  He lifted his head to grin down at Sherlock triumphantly.  “Exactly!  And it’s supposed to be even faster with less clothes on.”
Sherlock took a deep breath, letting it out as he closed his eyes.  “I’m trying, but after how badly things went last time-“
Sherlock sighed, thinking.  “Playful, raunchy.  So open, vulnerable.  But that’s what makes it so intense.”
He nodded to himself.  He had seen it with his own eyes, and just needed conformation.  “Thank you.  I think it is time for me to leave.”
Sherlock sat up, pulling the blanket over his body.  John sighed, and did the same. The mood had been totally spoiled now.  He took Sherlock’s hand in his, and was happy that he allowed it.
“You were just as into the cases as I was, and shot a guy for me,” Sherlock continued.  “I think everything changed for me from then on.”
After a few minutes, Sherlock nodded to himself.  “Then don’t move in here.  Not yet,” Sherlock added, sensing John was about to object.  “Let’s set up a room for her upstairs, and you can keep your apartment for now.  She can start staying over with me some weekends, and maybe you will stay over too.  Or maybe she can stay with her aunties for a weekend, and you can be here.”

It is composed of degenerating leukocytes (white blood cells), tissue debris, and living or dead microorganisms.” (Britannica)
John’s eyes met his again, a heat in them that was totally new but so, so welcome.  Sherlock felt an answering surge of warmth through his body, his heart thumping now.  He opened his mouth to gasp at this, and somehow they were kissing.  Wet and hot.  Warm lips pressing together.
“Which room will I be taking, Mr. Holmes?” John said softly.
“It is completely your choice.  But could you let this opportunity slip by?  Aren’t you curious about them?  Don’t you want to see them as they are now?  As you are now?  As a mature adult?”
“It’s my turn now, alright?” John asked, knowing he’d have to check in with Sherlock a lot.
John must not have looked convinced, as Sherlock began to sing.
He kept his eyes closed, feeling Sherlock trace lightly over his skin.  It was thorough, those fingertips making John feel more alive, sensitized, with every area he touched.  Sherlock seemed to map out his body, and John was sure he was cataloguing it all.
John felt Sherlock bouncing his leg a little, and reached over to take his hand.  It was a blatantly a gesture of a long term couple, right in front of Mycroft.  Mrs. Hudson had told John about his questions at the party, and knew he understood the nature of John’s close relationship with his brother.  It was highly illegal, with many rich and powerful men fleeing the country to avoid harsh punishments.
Like most men, John usually woke up with morning wood.  A nice firm erection that he often indulged with a good wank.  A good way to start the day.  Today was no exception, his cock stiff.
Sherlock nodded, clearly thinking it over.  “Thank you for that.  I haven’t been with anyone for so long, I’m not sure what I want.”
Sherlock played around with all sorts of angles and speeds, finding what had John shaking under him, and took him down deep.  His hot, hot throat tight around his cock, while that icy cold dildo pounded against his prostate.
John could only grin to himself and nibble on some shortbread as the four Holmes got involved in an intense discussion about germ theory.  They were surprisingly well read on the topic, even Mycroft.  He could have added more to their conversation, but held back.  This was about the four of them.
Sighing, John tried to quell his concerns.  He had been with Sherlock after that meeting, summoned by Claire.  Sherlock had been quiet and withdrawn, staring into the fire.  Clearly disturbed and upset.  It took a lot to get him talking.
John sighed.  “We wasted so much time.”
Things progressed fast after that.
They talked it over, long into the night.  The next day, he sent a reply to Mycroft, inviting him to the next monthly ball.
“So, your party can’t rely on its old bribery and favours to secure its continued power.  You are at the whims and wishes of the public now,” he chuckled.  “I doubt I could do anything to counter that.”
With his lips pursed in distaste, Sherlock followed the directions and scampered up the stairs in his damp socks, slamming the door of the flat behind him.
Saying that earned John some more intense kissing.  Sherlock had started out a bit awkwardly, but was a quick learner.  John lost himself to it.
He had said the words without thinking, and they seemed to hang in the air between them.  The room seemed suddenly too quiet, and Sherlock could only look at John, still so close, feeling incredibly aware of the sound of their breathing.  His own heartbeat seeming to get louder, and faster.
“Sherlock, please,” he replied, pulling John into a hug.  “How about Rosie takes over your old bedroom?”
Now, he eased in slowly, knowing Sherlock would take the first few inches easily, but the rest would be much harder.  He didn’t want to overwhelm Sherlock, have him think it was too much.  The thickness was the initial challenge, and John made sure he was well lubed, using shallow thrusts as Sherlock relaxed more and more.  He wanted it, pushing back against John, groaning at the intense sensations.
Sherlock scoffed.  “If it was only that, you could leave now.”
John rolled his eyes at Sherlock throwing his own comments back at him, and took Sherlock’s hand.  He felt the familiar nervousness of being fully naked with a new partner for the first time.  It was a bit of a relief that it was after they had just orgasmed, since it would be OK to be soft.  Unerect, he looked like other men.  Should he say something now?  Warn Sherlock what to expect?
He was promptly dumped on to his side as Sherlock wiggled out from beneath him and was securing the door.  He leaned back against it, his hair messed up by their make-out session, his clothing rumpled, and his eyes almost glowing.
“Powerful enough.  It brought you here, didn’t it, despite all your misgivings about my corrupted state,” Sherlock drawled back, and he was the one to take a few steps away.
Sherlock gave a noise of protest when John got up, but then curled up on his own chair, legs tucked under his blanket.  He stared into the fire moodily.
4 minute
But Sherlock took a half-step closer, making John realize that they were about the same height with where he was standing.  Sherlock really had beautiful eyes, an intriguing mix of jade green, aqua blue, and gold.  He stilled, caught up in them.
“I can’t go any further until I know that door is locked.  No chance of getting interrupted,” John said, a bit breathlessly.
John felt his mouth go dry.  Aroused, but also nervous.  Sherlock obviously wanting more than just an intense make-out session.  “Yes, of course.”
It had been a shock.  Sally had brought the letter straight to them in their wing, not waiting for a meeting of the senior staff.  It was obviously a very private matter for Sherlock, and she knew John would support him.
“But the lyrics simply refer to winter conditions.  No mythical saints or savoirs, no virgin births.”
“It’s not that,” John stated firmly.  “You are good with her.  It’s just I don’t want to move her and then have things not work out.  She’s been through so much lately, she needs some stability.”
“This time you are prepared.  We all are.  It will go better.  You are on your home turf, after all,” John smirked, patting the completed tie.
Sherlock met his gaze, not saying anything.  His eyes were searching, looking for something.  It reminded John of when they first met, when he was so thrown off by this intense, younger man, with such sharp, observant eyes.
A month later, Sherlock and John alighted from their elegant carriage.  They were let into the Holmes residence by a butler Sherlock didn’t recognize, and brought to an empty sitting room.
Sherlock leaned in to give him a firm kiss.  “I love it when you get all protective of me.”
“You asked for this meeting.  Why?”  It was direct and bald.  No wiggle room.
Sherlock took a throw and dropped it over them.  His hand found John’s under the covers, holding it, their own little secret.  John appreciated the need to appear normal in front of his family during this visit.  They’d have time to explore things more when they got home.  He was just happy Sherlock was wanting to stay in contact too.
The men were so involved, they didn’t notice the man lurking in the doorway, watching them.
Scoffing, Sherlock unlocked the door, and waved John inside.  He shut and locked it behind them before answering.  Some things just needed privacy.
“Come on,” John said, pulling him down a corridor.  “Lestrade just got a good bottle of French brandy.  I think we could both use a glass or two.”
“And she is thinking of forming a society for suffragettes,” Claire added.
“There you are,” John said loudly, acting like he hadn’t overheard anything.  It took a lot, steeling his face to appear neutral as the brothers straightened and turned towards him.
It felt like the orgasm was ripped out of him, his body surrendering to the intense sensations, and Sherlock keeping it all up.  Eventually John weakly pushed at his shoulders, “Enough, enough.  Shit, Sherlock...”
John scoffed, lowering his arm to glare at his boyfriend.  “Promise!  How can you
Sherlock pulled him down to the sofa, cupping John’s head to pull him in for a kiss.  They had stolen many private moments to do this the last few days.  “What is the next step?”
Mycroft arched an eyebrow, and turned away slightly, examining a nearby rose bush.  Delaying.  Playing with Sherlock.  “Your name has been bandied about more and more these days,” he said, and turned his gaze back to Sherlock.  “Or should I say both of your names?”
Sherlock nodded, pondering it all.  John left him to his thoughts, putting more wood on the fire and refilling their wine glasses.
It was like a slow paced duel, their sharp foils causing many small cuts and injuries.  Circling each other, looking for an unprotected spot to strike next.
He was looking better.  His skin had a healthy colour back, his eyes were clear, and he’d had a good enough appetite to eat two cupcakes during their visit with Molly.
His father had a full head of silver hair, with some waves that hinted at it being curly when he was younger.   His square face reminded John of Sherlock’s, and so did his tall, slim frame.
“Fuck my mouth,” Sherlock said, glancing up at John under the fringe of his messy hair.
Sherlock climbed over John, lying between his legs, already hard.  Frotting as they continued to kiss.  John grabbed the vial of oil they kept on the bed stand, and passed it to him.
“Let’s take it slow.  We can figure this out together,” John said, breathing a bit harder as Sherlock moved back to kissing near his ear.
Letting out a little whimper at that dirty image, Sherlock tensed up, his whole body shifting on the bed.  He was getting close.
He smirked as he cuddled along John’s side.  “I love doing that with you.”
Chuckling, John had to nod in agreement.  “OK, OK... not in that verse anyways.  Why are you singing it anyways?”
John tugged him closer, and kissed Sherlock.  It took a second or two, and then they seemed to sink into it, into a real kiss.  John’s hand slid to the back of Sherlock’s head, tilting him to a better angle, keeping him close.  Really kissing him, letting out all the emotions he had buried over the years.  It didn’t take much for them all to come rushing back, eager to be let out.  Finally.
John shrugged a shoulder.  “We will leave immediately if he does.  If he wants the benefit of your connections, he will have to resist that inclination.”
“I caught some of that, at the end,” John said, pulling Sherlock into a dark shadowed area.  “So, he wasn’t affected at all by what he saw here tonight?”
Nodding at the women, John walked briskly towards the veranda.  He slipped out.  It was a mild autumn night, fully dark now, with lanterns along the paths lighting the way.  Many couples walked along them, wanting time alone, away from the party.
Sherlock moaned, his head hanging down as he pushed back towards John.  “Fuck.  Yes, yes, John,” he begged breathlessly.
-Ice condoms:  Common to use on women after delivering babies, to soothe external lady parts:
Sherlock’s eyes met John’s, studying them.  “You think I should go.”
Taking a deep breath, John let it out slowly as he thought it over.  “Your parents must be elderly by now.  They likely want to see you with their own eyes.  It could be closure for you all.  Face up to your past, look them in the eye, and let them judge you for who you are now.  I know you as a self made man, building up a successful business and considerable wealth.  You have overcome drug addiction and got through those years of being the Courtesan.”
“Wait, don’t-“ John said, tugging at Sherlock to stop that.  “I said I’d clean you up.”
Eventually Sherlock stirred against him, climbing off the sofa to head to the washroom.  When he came back, he held out his hand to John.  “Come upstairs with me?”
Clothes started coming off, and it really hit John then.  Were they really doing this?  Was it taking things too fast?  He hadn’t been with a man since his army days, and he didn’t think Sherlock had much, if any, experience either.  But was it better like this?  Having sex now, before he moved back in?  Testing the waters of this new thing between them before committing to more?
Sherlock gave him The Look, which despite what they had just been doing still irked John.  He let out a huff of frustration.
Sherlock turned his face to look at his brother, asking him, Sherlock, for a favour.  A big favour.  One he couldn’t get from anyone else.
He nodded.  “Some information,” he started, pausing to think of how to phrase it.  “That doctor, Watson…”
“Would you roll over?” John asked gently.  Sherlock had explored his shoulder scars thoroughly, and he wanted to do the same for his back.  In a way, allowing these marks from the past to be touched in such an intimate way was a way of accepting the other’s past.  Acknowledging it.  Knowing how bad it had been, how painful, and showing they weren’t bothered by it.
He watched for Mycroft’s small reactions as they chatted and walked through the ballroom.  It was delicious every time he was surprised, at the refreshments, the orchestra, the guests.  Mycroft didn’t reveal much, but Sherlock could still read him.
Rolling his eyes, Sherlock shifted on to his back, staring at the ceiling.  “I’ve never had a connection like this with anyone else.  Many men and women have found my body attractive, and I’ve had sex with a few of them, but it wasn’t good.  They didn’t understand me, and I couldn’t fully relax around them.  Couldn’t be myself.”
Sherlock agreed, but John could see he was a little tense.  It was harder to lie back and be the passive partner sometimes, giving up control.  John felt honoured that Sherlock felt comfortable enough to allow him to do this.  He had been wanting to touch Sherlock forever too.
-Ice lollies (popsicles) in vaginas warnings:
He had the upper hand for sure.  It took a lot for Mycroft to send the letter, to show up here tonight, to mostly act civilly.  This was The Moment.  He had the power to say yes or no, to make a huge difference in his brother’s life, his professional future.
Reaching out, John brushed some snow from his cheek.  Sherlock’s breath caught at the light touch, and he closed his eyes.  John slid his hand into his hair, holding him in place as he leaned in for a kiss.
Those ideas started a spark in Sherlock’s eyes, his whole expression changing.  “You are right.  I could have him come here.  Make him see what I have achieved.”
Going through to the kitchen, John started the tea and peaked inside the refrigerator for dinner ideas.  There was leftover soup Mrs. Hudson had brought them yesterday.  He could make some toasties later to go with it.
The trio watched Sherlock and his brother talking as they walked around the ballroom.  Eventually, Sherlock led Mycroft  out to the veranda and to the manicured gardens beyond.  A quiet place they could be alone, and finally talk freely.
“Like what?” John asked, really interested.  Sherlock hadn’t had that much sex in his younger years, a fact that still shocked John.
John took a deep breath, calming that urge, and slowly turned his hand, rocking it from side to side.  It moved within Sherlock’s well-lubed ass, pressing against his prostrate, bringing out more shudders of pleasure and a bit of a keening moan.
“Perhaps coming to visit me while I recovered has brought those old memories back a bit more,” Sherlock said, glancing downwards.  “Thanks for helping me through it.”
Sherlock paused in putting a handkerchief in his pocket, sending an amused glance his way.  “With you, always.”
John’s breathing got even quicker at that.  “Um, no, not at all.”
John went to stand with Claire and Sally, watching the brothers from across the ballroom.  “How do you think it’s going?”
Sherlock thought about it, really thought about it.  He had been raised by nannies, went to boarding school for half his childhood, and then to university.  He had travelled in Europe afterwards, and started down the unfortunate path that led him here.
Rubbing his back, John was pleased that the earlier tension was gone.  He moved his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders, massaging them until they relaxed under his touch.  “The bigger ones are what some people think fight disease.”
Sherlock’s sharp eyes were scanning over his brother, taking in what John just had, but likely much more with his deduction abilities.  He was still and silent.  John waited, watching for his response.  Was he ready for this?  Even with all their planning and preparation, it all came down to Sherlock.
He had several long term girlfriends that he had eventually allowed to explore him more fully.  They had been kind, giving him head or an occasional fuck, but he could tell they weren’t really into it.  Doing it out of duty mostly.  Instead, he used his mouth, hands and toys to keep them satisfied, and quickly took care of himself.
“Is he here yet,” John asked her, in a quiet tone.
Mycroft entered first, greeting them.  “Our parents will be along soon.”
Sherlock had stiffened in surprise at first, but as John stayed wrapped around him, he relaxed little by little.  John was warm, very warm, and the heat was sinking into to him in a delicious way.  Not just on the outer surface, but sinking deeper.  Thawing him out from the inside.  He shivered at the fast change in his own temperature.
Sherlock scoffed lightly, rolling on to his back.  “You mean if I’m fool enough to accept Mycroft’s invitation.  Fool enough to give him another chance to attack me.  To give my family another chance to reject me.”
An hour later, the three Holmes were standing at their doorway as Sherlock and John got back into their carriage.  Once on their way, John hugged him hard.  “I’m so proud of you.  That was a difficult thing to do.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, Sherlock,” John said as he set his shovel to lean against the snowbank and moved towards his flatmate, one corner of his mouth struggling to break into a smirk.  “Are you OK?”
Sherlock just stared at the telly, not conceding to John’s points.
Dipping his head down, John captured Sherlock’s lips in a deep, hungry kiss.  Almost immediately, he felt Sherlock’s arms and legs wrap around him, pulling him in closer.  John couldn’t help but groan at feeling something hard pressing against his hip.
John ran his hands over the pleasing roundness of Sherlock’s ass.  It was one of the things he found most attractive on his flatmate.  Sherlock knew it, wearing tight trousers perfectly tailored to show it off.
“Good.  Because you are doing that to me tomorrow,” Sherlock said, stretching out beside John, looking like the cat that got the canary.
That had Sherlock pulling back, his eyes searching John’s.  “You would be willing to be in an exclusive relationship with me with only kissing?  No sex?”  He seemed surprised.
John shook his head, exasperated.  “I don’t want some idle chit chat.  I meant about Sherlock and his brother.  They must have come back by now.”
Sherlock’s whole body tightened up, his back arching.  John almost cried out at how tight his ass was around his hand, but just pressed firmly against his prostrate, stroking even faster with his other hand.  Sherlock came hard, groaning, shuddering all over, a huge load spurting out on to the towel beneath him.
“Please, John,” Sherlock gasped, his voice deep and scratchy with need. “I’m ready.”
Sherlock knew he had won then, and his kiss was deep and thorough.  Despite the heat, they couldn’t keep from pressing together.
John took Sherlock’s hand as they entered the ballroom.  It looked quite magical, with the massive windows along the back wall facing out into the lush gardens.  The wall sconces glowed with their gas lights, and candles were clustered on tables and other surfaces, giving off warm light.  The orchestra was on a dias, and lavish buffet tables ran along the far wall.  Small tables covered with tablecloths surrounded the large dance floor, each with fragrant bouquets from the rose garden.
Sherlock moaned at that, his hips arching upwards as his motions sped up.
Johnlock.
With his other hand, John cupped Sherlock’s cock, stroking fast with lots of lube.  He knew the signs, knew Sherlock was close, and just wanted it to be great for him.  “That’s it, baby.  Give it to me.”
John grinned, glad that Sherlock wasn’t having any post-sex regrets.  “The weatherman said this cold snap could  be around for the rest of January.”
John shifted back to his feet, tugging his clothes back in place.  “Did it work?”
John hugged him tight.  “I love you so much, Sherlock.”  Living together, fully sharing their lives, had deepened that bond for both of them.  “You know you have a family here.  Me, Mrs. Hudson, Sally, Greg, Claire.  We all love you, and will be here for you, no matter what.”
“Because, like it or not, they are your family.  And you are a lot like them,” John replied, and kissed Sherlock thoroughly.
It was always about a 50/50 probability that Sherlock would eat when presented food.  John tended to just set it out and hope for the best.  Sometimes, he would wrap it up and put it in the fridge if Sherlock didn’t eat it.  Sometimes he’d leave it near him, hoping the berk would eventually notice it and eat the cold food because it was convenient.
“Tuck your feet under my leg,” John said, grabbing a throw from the back of his chair to drape over his body.
“Um, together?” John asked, a little stunned.  Again, things happening faster than he ever expected with Sherlock.
He returned the favour enthusiastically, feeling even more connected to Sherlock.  Anything that felt good was explored.  They both used toys on each other.
John nodded.  “I won’t do anything you haven’t done with me, OK?  Just exploring your body.  Getting to know what you like.”
John gazed into those incredible blue-green eyes, loving the intelligence and pure joy of trying new things that showed there.  The boyish enthusiasm for exploring whatever captures his interest.  It was hard to resist him like this.
“Some desperate attempt to have more influence with certain circles for the next election.  He turned sour quite quickly when I refused.”
Running his hand up Sherlock’s thigh, he gently cupped his balls.  “Yes, yes...all drawn up tight.  Ready to give me a big load.  Let me see it, beautiful.  Come on, my sexy man.”  He stroked and gently squeezed, knowing he was right on the edge.  “Imagine if I came into your bedroom, when I had just moved into the flat, and saw you like this?”
A few drinks later, John knew it was time to go.  Sherlock was more relaxed, but not drunk.
“Woo hoo,” Mrs. Hudson called out, knocking once before opening the door.  “I just finished this shortbread.  It’s best hot from the oven.”
“How long?” John finally asked, his brain finally able to function again.  “How long have you-“
Finishing his drink, John set down his glass, and snuggled along Sherlock’s side.    He ran a hand down his chest, loving the smooth skin, with barely any chest hair.  After the year together, he knew the gentle caresses Sherlock liked.  They were comforting touches, not meant to be arousing.  John knew Sherlock needed time in his mind palace to sort this out, and just wanted to stay at his side for that.
“My feet feel even colder now, without the socks,” Sherlock grumbled, ignoring John’s comment.
Seeming to take pity on him, Sherlock didn’t even roll his eyes as he sang another verse.
Sherlock dropped down on to the bed, still breathing hard, sweaty and flushed.  His limbs were slack and completely relaxed now, in a way John rarely saw him.
“There!” Sherlock said, his voice triumphant.  He stood up, and waved John to take the stool.
It had been one of the hottest days ever recorded in London, and John was exhausted.  The clinic had been busy, mostly with heat-related problems.  He had treated heat rashes, sunburns and dehydration.  Warned people who didn’t know how to swim to wear a life vest when going in the water to cool off, to prevent drownings.  Advised people to check on elderly relatives and neighbours.
He rolled off, breathing hard, and Sherlock shifted to lie on his back too.  “Um, are you OK?”
He found Sally and Claire.  “What happened while I was gone?”
Mycroft shook John’s hand, his grip firm but not too tight.  His gaze was direct and assessing, his eyes a deeper green, with more hazel tones, than his brother’s. “Dr. Watson, I have heard much about you.  Pleased to finally meet you.”
“You could move back, you know.  You and Rosie,” Sherlock said, still watching John closely.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Hudson rushed to Sally's office and hit the buzzer three times.
“Never mind that.  I’ll explain it once we get to the lab,” John said, still walking briskly.  “What happened with Mycroft?  What did he want?”
Sherlock was panting hard, his body tensing up as he got closer and closer to the edge.  He dropped his head to his pillow, resting the weight of his upper body on to his forearms, rocking back against John’s thrusts.  “Yes, yes...,” he moaned.
It was something John had never expected, when things became sexual with Sherlock.  He had always been focused on his partner’s pleasure, and was extremely good at oral sex.
The sun had just set, and the lanterns along the path helped guide them as they walked in the deepening twilight.  Sherlock walked fast, in the lead, knowing Mycroft was close behind him.  They got to his favourite bench, and Sherlock took comfort from the memories of better days here, with John.  They had the rest of their lives together to make more.  That thought helped him turn and face his brother, mentally braced for the worst.
This was so different.  Having a partner concentrating on his pleasure so much.  Taking such enjoyment from it.  John smiled, pulling Sherlock closer for a deep kiss.
It was only the sound of someone coming up the steps that halted things.  John pulled away with another swear under his breath.  He sat up at his end of the sofa and yanked his blanket back in place.  Sherlock followed his lead, pulling his own cover over his recumbent form.
Sitting down on the bench, Sherlock stared into the dark water of the pond.  “How could she help, if I decide to discuss it with her?”
Before John’s sluggish brain could catch up, Sherlock was pushing his hand into his pants.
Chuckling, John thought fondly back on the their first meeting in the lab at St. Bart’s.  “I already know about your violin playing and not talking for days when you are in your mind palace.  Or do you have some new bad habit?”
John loved the view, the obscene, raunchy sight of his hand up Sherlock’s tight ass, stretched snugly around his wrist, dripping with lube.  The wet squelch sounds mixing with their panting, and the creaking of the bed.  Good sex was noisy and a bit nasty, and he loved that Sherlock was just totally surrendering to it all.  Completely in the moment and loving it.
Sherlock wiggled his toes under John’s leg.  “I seem to be handling it fine.”
Mycroft just showed a pleasant expression as he wrapped a scarf around his neck, and drew on gloves.
“Um,” John said, shifting on the step, “I really should get home.  Rosie will be wanting to try her cupcake.”  He held up a clear plastic container with a pink frosted treat inside, tied up with large blue ribbon.
Sherlock gave John’s dick a few long licks, when it looked like his erection was flagging slightly.  “Calm down, doctor.  As much as I’d love to rim your cherry flavoured ass, this is just water frozen in a condom.  You are prepped, and I will keep it moving.  No chance of ice burn.”
“Perhaps you’d better show me my room then?  So I can make sure it’s suitable?” John leaned in for a quick kiss.
“I was holding back before, you know.  I am aware you are no longer a whore, but you are still a pimp.  A flesh-monger,” the taller man sneered, leaning over Sherlock.  “A complete disgrace to the family.  You disgust me.”
“Do you want to go?” John asked.
John was the one lying boneless and panting as Sherlock grabbed a towel to clean up.
The comment put a warm glow deep in John’s chest, and he smiled in return.  It felt amazing that they had been together this long, and still felt so strongly about each other.  “When this night is over, we will test that theory.”
“It better not be a fucking ice lolly,” John groaned, head flopping back against his pillow.  “I’ve had to warn so many people at the clinic against it.  It’s even been in the news.    Infections, irritations, damage...”
Sherlock gave him a small smile.  He hadn’t heard that story before.  “John is too busy with his practice.  He also mentors new doctors, and helps older army doctors get established in London.”
He chuckled, shaking his head.  “My father carved me a wooden pipe for Christmas one year.  I tried to learn how to play it, but was quite awful.  Eventually my older sister snatched it and threw it into the Thames.”
It felt like a long time, but was probably about twenty minutes later, when John noticed his arrival.  Sally’s posture shifted into complete alertness, ready for anything.  She waved to Claire, one of the most senior consorts. Within seconds, the new arrival was surrounded by three of the most beautiful women in the room.
Sherlock pulled him up the stairs, and within seconds they were in his bedroom.  John pushed him on to the bed, crawling over him like he’d fantasized doing so many times.  The kissing was intense from the start, a simmering need that had grown since that first kiss.
Sherlock chuckled, tugging at his pants.  “Yes, except for this.”
It had almost become more of a massage by the time he moved to Sherlock’s legs.  Stroking over his skin, the light amount of hair there compared to the rest of his body, kneading lightly into his muscles.  His legs were long, and strong, from all the running he did around London.
Sherlock noticed his diverted attention, and followed his gaze to the doorway.  John felt him stiffen with tension, and his eyes flicked to his face.
Right now, only staff were rushing around, getting everything ready.  Guests were not due for another 30 minutes or so.  Sherlock toured around the room, still holding John’s hand, his sharp eyes taking in every detail.  By the time they were back at the doorway, John could tell he was satisfied with the set up, at least.
He rarely asked like this, and John knew what he wanted.  Sex.  Wanted to have that deep, elemental connection with John, getting lost in each other.  John wanted it too.
He headed back to the ballroom, still full of many wealthy and influential people in society.  Unashamed of being seen in the home of the notorious Courtesan.  This was an invitation only gathering people worked hard to come to.
“We could have an elegant dinner party, full of the best guests and food.  Wine and dine him, make him wait until afterwards for a private audience with you.  Let him see you for the man you are now,” John added.
John had prepped him thoroughly, with lots of lube and working his fingers in gradually.  He teased Sherlock lots, occasionally stroking his cock or rubbing more firmly on his prostrate.  Working him up to this perfect, almost delirious state of desire.
Mrs. Hudson dropped what she was holding with a clatter, and rushed to his side.  John was already squatting beside Sherlock, checking for injuries.
-A/N:  Thank you for reading!  This little sequel wasn't really needed, but there were some comments asking for more about the relationship between Mycroft and Sherlock, and I decided to explore it.
“It’s the perfect time.  The house has never looked better, the consorts have never been in such high demand.  And wherever I go, the name ‘William Scott’ seems to keep coming up,” John chuckled, patting Sherlock’s thigh.
Sherlock smiled widely, his eyes shining.  “It is so ridiculous.  Why should I care what these pompous windbags think about me?”
“But still, if we did this,” John waved a hand between them, “you can’t do stuff like that anymore.  OK?”
He didn’t wait for a response, dragging Sherlock away from the hateful man.  Suppressing the urge to punch him, repeatedly, right on his pointed nose.
“Next you’ll be telling me about people  sleeping in the same sleeping bag to stay warm,” Sherlock said, rolling his own eyes.
Sherlock had totally shifted into science mode, sitting on his stool, peering through his microscope, adjusting the focus.  John was glad he had such a good distraction at hand.  This was their happy place, where they still spent hours each week dabbling in whatever interested them.
Sherlock simply smirked, his eyes warm.  “Well, we need to test if it’s quicker to warm me up without clothes still, don’t we?”
John just smirked back at him, and they walked briskly back to the main part of the house, prepared for the worst.
John chuckled, carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair now.  “I never thought I’d be grateful to have someone ask me to look at a sore tooth.  As soon as he opened his mouth, I could see his gums were so swollen with infection.  I lanced the area, collected the discharge, and he felt a bit better.  I gave him the name of our dentist.”
John scanned the room, usually very good at picking Sherlock out of a crowd.  He didn’t see sign of him either.
John didn’t know if he should bow apologetically or tug at his forelock.  What was the proper thing for a peasant like himself to do to appease the nobility?  He chuckled, mostly to himself, at the thought.  Glancing at his work, he decided he had done enough for now.
Sherlock jumped back from John quickly, but slipped on something, falling backwards with a big flailing of arms and long legs.  He landed hard, letting out a grunt of pain.
The biggest part was Sherlock preparing himself mentally.  This wasn’t a chance meeting like last time.  He went over what he wanted to discuss, reviewed it with John, worked through many lingering emotions about his past.  Knew what he wanted to achieve.  This could be a restart to their relationship as brothers.  A clearing of the air, a basis for going forward.  A way back into acceptance by his family.
Sherlock released John’s hand.  “OK if we mostly undress?”  His hand was already on his shirt buttons.
Sherlock gave him a fond look. “It’s only natural.  You did live here for several years.”
Before John could decide anything, Sherlock’s hand was rubbing over the head, precum making his hand slick.  John moaned, loving the sensation, and was even more lost to it when Sherlock’s erection pressed against his ass.  They rocked together, faster and faster.
Nodding, he took his hand and they rushed to their bedroom.  In seconds, they were naked on the bed, kissing deeply.  John let Sherlock take the lead, matching his intensity.
I imagine Sherlock giving her good, unbiased information, as he seeks no personal gain of money or power from her.  He also advised on who she have around her, using his deductions and investigative skills to weed out the greedy gits, and bring better people into her sphere.
It was a good start.  John could see them eventually going to concerts and plays with Sherlock’s parents.  Re-establishing some sort of relationship there.  Mycroft was more crafty and self-serving, so it may be better to have a cautious connection with him.  John would be there, supporting Sherlock through it all, watching that he didn’t get hurt again.
Maybe it was his lack of experience or long suppressed sexual side, but he explored John completely.  John had never had a lover touch and kiss him all over, and was surprised at how many erogenous areas he found.  Sherlock learned to play him like his violin, drawing out his pleasure.  John had never felt so accepted and treasured.
It had been a few days after Christmas.  They were staying at the Holmes country house, an hour out of the city.  John didn’t mind Sherlock’s parents, but Sherlock needed breaks from being around them so much.  They ended up bundling up to go on a long walk.  It started snowing, big fluffy flakes, and John’s breath had caught just watching Sherlock staring upwards in wonder.  Snowflakes were landing on his dark curls, his face, his long, dark coat.
John steered him into the doctor’s office, picking up a test tube with a stopper on the end.  “I have something kind of exciting, actually.”
“There are so many here,” Sherlock said, his voice full of wonder.
John sighed, and took off his own winter gear.  He had a thick parka, but found it a bit too heavy to wear snow shovelling.  It was hard physical work that got his heart pumping and warmed him up.  A thick jumper, a scarf, gloves and thick boots were all he usually wore for this.  They were soon stored away neatly, and John headed up the stairs, carefully avoiding stepping on the wet spots with his dry socks.
Sherlock didn’t seem convinced.
Sherlock grinned at the pieces, his eyes lighting up with an idea, and he put them in his mouth.  John could see his cheeks bulging a little on each side, the only warming before Sherlock took him deep into his mouth.
“Very few connect William Scott to me,” Sherlock said back, not rising to his bait.
Sally shook her head.  “We haven’t seen either of them.  And we’ve kept a close watch, of course.”
They both turned their attention back to the movie.  It was one of the better film noirs, with a good storyline and a very beautiful actress, glorious in 1950s fashions.
John nodded, and started the fire. He poured them large brandies.  Sherlock had already stripped off his shoes, tailcoat jacket, and was working on the tight cravat at his neck.  John did the same, getting rid of all the confining formal wear.  They took off everything except their underwear, crawling under the blankets on the huge sofa, sipping their drinks.
“And now I’m a boring, old man.  Puttering around, doing my hobbies, living with my better half,” Sherlock gave John a light kiss.
They got up, John taking Sherlock’s hand, something they had done lots the last few days.  On their walks, under the table at meals, under a blanket on the sofa.  But this was different, heading to Sherlock’s bedroom together.
Leaving the west wing, he looked around the impressive foyer with staircases flanking each side, fine tapestries on the walls, and a dome of glass above it all.  Staff were rushing around, efficient.  Likely a hundred people living and working beneath this roof.
John kissed the side of his neck, feeling sleepy now.  “Did you really jerk off, thinking about me?  Back then?”
She levelled a knowing look at each of them in turn.  “And what I just saw?  Was that you giving Sherlock his birthday present?”
“Are you humming?” he chuckled.  “That sounds like a Christmas carol, a week too late.  I’m surprised you didn’t delete them all, actually.”
It hadn’t been the best blow job he’d ever had, but it was certainly the most enthusiastic.  Sherlock’s eyes gleamed as he let John go, licking his lips.  There was no sign of disappointment.
John nodded.  “And I lost touch with my sister for so many years.  But we’ve been able to develop a real relationship now, despite our troubled pasts.”
Sherlock wasn’t a very emotional person, but John looked at him a bit closer at the tone of his voice.  Was he OK?
“We stay in London for the season, and retire to the country for the rest of the year,” his mother replied.
Feeling very distracted by the kiss, John blinked a few times before he could answer.  “Um, well, being in a romantic relationship, I guess.”
The squawk of outrage and the sputtering as Sherlock shook his head and scraped the wet clinging snow from his hair and face had John turning to him.  His expressions went from distress and worry to amusement as the detective’s red, wet face emerged, his eyes firey.
Sherlock did at least shift his big chair to face John, and lifted his right foot to rest it on John’s knee.  John worked the thin, damp sock off, and examined his foot by the firelight.  His fingers traced over it, looking for signs of frostbite, like areas that had gone pale and numb, from the blood flow stopping to a damaged place.  He sighed in relief when he could only see skin that red from cold.  He gave the other foot the same review, and set it on the rug.
His vulnerability had John gathering him close, hugging him hard.  “You never have to see him again.  Shall we ask Lestrade to get his strongest men to throw him out?”
Sometime in the last year, they had realized that Sherlock had a bit of a thing for John’s dirty talk.  It amused John, since he didn’t think his voice was half as sexy as Sherlock’s, but he wouldn’t argue against what seemed to work.  He liked having this power over him.
Sherlock was shocked for a few seconds, but then wrapped his arms around John tight.  John grunted at that, swearing softly and shifting to be in even fuller contact, sinking against him.  Sherlock wasn’t just warm now, he burned.
Sherlock shook his head, sweaty curls clinging to his sweaty skin.  “I’m too horny and hot for that now.  Would you just talk to me, while I...,” he said, picking up the lube bottle and pouring a generous amount into his hand.
Mycroft spoke, even though Sherlock was still turned away.  “The election will likely be called next year, with three times as many votes being cast.”
“John Watson.  What about him?”
“You are just trying to distract me,” Sherlock sighed, moving away.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “That was just dirty talk, John.  You were just saying that to make me cum.”
“I felt that too.  Like they couldn’t accept me fully.”
-This idea popped into my head yesterday and I wrote it just for fun.  Maybe they could have ended the series this way or make 4.3 about them adjusting to living together as a couple instead of all that Eurus stuff?  Lol
His father nodded.  “Mycroft mentioned you have a large laboratory in your home.  Is that true?”
John nodded and urged Sherlock further into the room.  “Let’s talk with our guests like we normally do.  I’ll watch Sally for her signal.”
By the time they got to Baker St after New Years, John was feeling excited yet a bit scared.  “So, are we doing this?  Taking this next step in our relationship?”
This time, Sherlock stayed bundled in his blanket and sat beside John, eating the food without complaint and watching the movie.  It was times like this when John enjoyed sharing a flat with him.  Someone to share a meal and a quiet meal with.  So much better than those lonely nights in his bedsit.
“It’s about time,” she said with a smirk, and continued on her way.
John let out a chuckle, drawn towards him.  “Sorry, just ignore me.  I’m in a funny mood,” John said, a weak excuse.
Chuckling, Sherlock grabbed a towel, and moved John’s hand away to mop himself up.
“I didn’t see my parents much, growing up.  My brother is many years older than me, and went off to school,” Sherlock tapped his fingertips lightly against the brandy glass.
“You go from drug addict to whore to what?  A flim flam artist?  Plundering widows of their fortunes with far-fetched dross?”  He turned to look back at the massive house, with light shining out of its many windows.  “Congratulations, little brother.  You must be quite spectacular at it.”
“You know I love her,” Sherlock said, looking a bit hurt.
Sometimes it was better to prove a point instead of arguing about it.  At least that’s what John told himself as he pulled back Sherlock’s blanket and laid down beside him, before tugging the blanket over both of them.
He didn’t have much time to ponder it before they were under the hot water.  Wet soapy hands were going everywhere, even less inhibited after what had just happened.  John felt comfortable with this, knowing he was pretty fit.  Sherlock spent a lot of time on his scar, and John reciprocated.  The light was better here, and they took their time.  John liked feeling Sherlock’s hands on his slick skin.
“I’ve never seen you like this, Sherlock.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?  Things are going great for you. Why rock the boat?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I’m not the one with a nickname related to my sexual prowess.”
Sherlock was looking back at him calmly, and John just shrugged internally and shifted to allow Sherlock to slide his feet in place.  His flatmate would complain a bit less if his feet were warm.
-Reform Act 1867:  “Before the Act, only one million of the seven million adult men in England and Wales could vote; the Act immediately doubled that number. Moreover, by the end of 1868 all male heads of household were enfranchised as a result of the end of compounding of rents.  The overall intent was to help the Conservative Party, yet it resulted in their loss of the 1868 general election.”(Wikipedia)
That last action had John grabbing Sherlock’s head, and shifting down to kiss him.  Harder, deeper than he had before.  A really sexual kiss.  Open mouths, panting against each other.  His tongue teasing in, pleased when Sherlock reciprocated.
He could only hope that tonight would.  Dressed in immaculate black tie, Sherlock knew he looked his best.  He had come into his own after turning thirty, getting some muscles over his skinny frame, his face becoming a bit less angular, in better balance with his eyes and prominent cheekbones.
“Well, you shut my flirting down at the restaurant.  I was happy to just be around you.”
After a few minutes, John pulled back for some air.  Sherlock whined in complaint, kissing his way down his neck.
Nodding, John took the offered hand.
Sighing, Sherlock had hugged John tighter, taking comfort in their embrace.  “It’s likely something political.  He wants to exploit my connection with the Queen.  I’m sure that’s all there is to it.”
John relaxed into his own chair.  The tea hit the spot, quenching his thirst from all the shovelling.  It was a good workout, actually, and he rolled his shoulders, checking on how his weaker one was doing.  If anything, the frequent activity was making it stronger.
He had come home exhausted, stripped off his sweaty clothes, and taken a long cold shower.  Drank a couple litres of icy water.  Now he was lying naked under a fan, but feeling hot again.  When would this ever end?
John awoke to bliss.  A warm body pressed along his own, an arm draped over his chest, and lips planting teasing kisses against his neck.  John moaned softly, shifting closer.
John went to Sherlock’s side, drawn like a magnet.  The man he loved was under attack and he had to get him away.  “Sorry to interrupt you, but there is a rather urgent matter that came up.  Something that needs your skills.”
Sherlock was definitely more alert than John.  His hands were running over his body as the kisses continued, becoming more bold.
Claire nodded in agreement.  “Like when Mycroft was at that event last year.  I didn’t even realize something was going wrong until so much time had passed.  Sherlock normally only talks to guests privately for 5 or 10 minutes.  But they talked for over twenty, never raising their voices,” she confided.  “It was only when Mycroft left, and Sherlock refused to see more guests that I saw how disturbed he was by it all.”
“Come on, let’s get you inside and warmed up,” John said, trying his best to keep a straight face.  He grabbed Sherlock’s arm to guide him into the building, and set his shovel down in the entranceway.
Sherlock moved to be on his side, facing John.  “I think we needed that time as just flatmates and friends.  Getting to know each other so well.  When you finally kissed me, it just felt so right.”
Having a plan in place helped relax Sherlock slightly.  He shifted into his Courtesan persona, holding a glass of white wine in his left hand, shaking guests’ hands with his right.  Greeting and chatting with them as they worked through the crowd.  John mostly guided them along, his eyes often on Sally and the doorway.
“Come here,” John said softly, his eyes going down to those full lips.
Drarry.
He heard raised voices, two men obviously arguing.  He could make out an occasional word.  “Disgrace”, “disgusting”, and “peddler of flesh” were some of the ones that set the tone.  By the time he could see the men, Sherlock was sitting on the bench, his head hanging low, his shoulders slumped.  Mycroft was standing over him, barking out further insults.
He took his time on his scars, remembering treating most of them during their years together.  He pressed a soft apologetic kiss to the bullet scar near his heart, and his eyes met Sherlock’s.  He gave a little nod, and John continued on.
It was a good jab at his brother.  Mycroft surely knew that the Queen’s favourite advisor was the infamous medium William Scott.  He had seen William Scott in action a year ago, and privately confronted Sherlock behind the screen.  It must be torture for a monarchist like Mycroft, knowing his younger brother had her ear.
“Lube, do you have-“ John got out, before Sherlock almost hit him in the head as his arm shot out, fumbling around in the bedside table.
Sherlock was insanely curious, wanting to do and try everything.  For someone who claimed he had little interest in sex, John was surprised how often cuddling on the sofa led to more.  He was the one holding back, being more experienced, not wanting to pressure Sherlock into more than he could handle.  Lazy kisses became more intense, and hands started going under clothing.
They both moaned when the thickest part was in.  John stilled, marvelling at the feeling, letting Sherlock adjust to it as well.  “That’s it.  You are taking it so well.”
“I like that.  Let her ease into the idea.  Let us get used to it too,” John replied, feeling some of his earlier stress fading.
“Well, Mycroft was the one who wrote to Sherlock, the one who wanted to meet with him,” Sally said, exchanging her empty glass for a full one with a passing server.
“Let me look again,” Sherlock said, excitement in his tone so evident.
-A/N:  Just a fluffy winter fic.  It just snowed a lot where I live.
:  Classic movies, Foreign films, Documentaries, Current releases, Criterion Collection.
Sherlock just smirked at him.  “She’s into women.  I’m gay.”
Pretty soon, the ice was gone and John was lost to the bliss of Sherlock’s normal blow job technique.  Sucking him deep, swirling his tongue, flicking around the head.  His lubed fingers playing around his ass, working inside as Sherlock took him deep.  Tapping and stroking over his prostate as John shuddered and moaned.
“Can I kiss you?  Everywhere?” Sherlock asked.
John loved the reaction, and knew Sherlock was getting close.  “Mmmmm yes.  I want to watch you cum, Sherlock.  Wrap my hand over yours as you stroke out each shot, covering your chest with thick stripes.  Make a good mess for me to lick up.  Lick you clean.  Want every drop.”
She set the plate down on the coffee table, and chuckled at their blankets.  “Warming up after being outside, are you?  Maybe move closer to the fireplace, dears.”
Turning his head, Sherlock looked down at John warmly.  “But it was different with you from the start.  You kept saying how brilliant I was at that first crime scene, and in the cab, and it wasn’t faked to just have sex with me.”
The thought of Sherlock rimming him made John close his eyes, the thought intensified by that very tongue swirling around the tip of his cock.  He groaned as Sherlock pushed the condom more firmly, and felt the icy phallus entering his ass.  The combination of feeling that fullness, the stretch, along with the coldness in such a hot place was almost too much.
John had been hard for what felt like ages, so into pleasuring Sherlock, to make the experience as good as he could.  His erection had faded a little, but quickly came back completely.  He groaned, clutching at Sherlock’s head as he sucked and licked.
He wished he could be there at Sherlock’s side, supporting him.  Arguing on his behalf.  Pushing Mycroft to go past the incorrect assumptions most of society had about Sherlock Holmes, the infamous Courtesan.  Make him see him as the intelligent, caring and successful man he was now.  Be as proud of him as John was.  But this was Sherlock’s fight, and John could only support him before and afterwards.
“What would that involve?” Sherlock asked, his eyes going down to John’s lips in a most distracting way.
Sherlock gingerly got back on his feet.  “What did I step on?”
Sherlock grinned at that, and took a long pull from his glass.
Eventually, Sherlock steeled himself, and suggested they get some air in the garden.  His brother met his gaze and nodded slowly.  This was it.  Away from everyone, their polite masks would come off.
Sherlock had balked at the idea of meeting with him.  Years of being cut off and shunned by his family because of his opium addiction and apparent work in prostitution were not easy things to overcome.
But Sherlock didn’t just kiss.  He licked, he sucked, he bit.  John writhed underneath him, not holding back his responses.  He could tell Sherlock was learning him, seeing what drew out the most reaction, and trying it other places.  He learned that soft, dry kisses worked best when moving up his arms.  Light bites along his inner thighs.  And his nipples got rock hard when he sucked and licked them.
“Maybe you could take a really hot bath.  Warm up that way?” John said, feeling a bit exasperated.  It was like living with a six foot toddler at times.  But his doctor instincts kicked in.  “Turn your chair towards me.  I need to check your feet.”
“We were just talking with Lydia Becker,” Sally gushed, excited.
“Still cold,” Sherlock said, setting his empty cup down on the floor near the hearth, and burrowing back below his blanket.
“...infections, irritations and damage.
“Mostly based on your advice,” John added in.
Dimly, John heard a soft noise, but he hardly paid attention as Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him tight. He was doing the same thing, and it felt so good. So right.
Fuck.  John closed his eyes at those words, feeling a surge of pure desire shoot through him.  “Yes, anywhere,” he replied, his voice a bit strangled.
It had been an ongoing debate between them, ever since the snow started accumulating on the streets.  John had told him to use warmer footwear outside, but Sherlock had turned up his nose at the idea of wearing winter boots.  It had gone as far as John even buying him a pair, but they sat untouched by the door.  John bugged him about ruining his hand-stitched Italian dress shoes, but even that hadn’t swayed the stubborn detective.
Setting a large ceramic mixing bowl on the bedside table, Sherlock crawled on to the bed, lying on his side next to John.  Not touching, since it was too sticky hot for that.  “Come on, John.  I promise you’ll like it-“
“Well, I have researched it thoroughly and the theory is sound.  I have taken sensible precautions,” Sherlock cajoled, lowering his voice to the sexiest, lowest rumble he could, knowing it was John’s weakness.  His kryptonite.
“No, I’ve had this one for a long time,” Sherlock said, and then moved closer.  He tilted his head, and then his lips were pressing against John’s.  A light kiss, but firm enough to leave his lips tingling when Sherlock pulled back.  “An unfortunate romantic attachment to you.”
He was cut off by Sherlock moving, his intent clear.  Within a minute, he was pinned down and Sherlock was taking him in his mouth.
He had never done this before, with a friend.  They really didn’t need to date to get to know each other, did they?  What should they do next?
John glared at him, feeling frustrated.  “It is surprisingly effective.”
After spreading out the towel, John settled back down, and prepared himself to enjoy Sherlock.  A few more kisses, and then Sherlock was dragging the ice over his lips, letting him suck the melting water off of it.  Kissing him again and savouring the way his cooler tongue felt against Sherlock’s warmer one.
Mycroft drew on his coat, doing up the buttons.  “Very observant, little brother.  Thank you for the opportunity to see the operation you have here.  Over the years, I have been in places in the same line of business as this, but have never seen one run so effectively.”
He had learned the hard truth as a teenager, in those first intense make out sessions with girls from his school.  It had been in the years before the internet and the porn he had seen was mostly just pictures of naked women.  Things progressed to dry humping and eventually his zipper being undone.  It felt wonderful, a small hand wrapped around his hard dick, but then things seemed to grind to a halt.
His nipples got teased mercilessly, Sherlock fascinated by how hard and tight they became under the ice, and sucking them eagerly, warming him, making the nipple soften to a more normal state.  Repeating it again and again, until John was arching off the bed, panting with need.  “Fuck, Sherlock, your mouth,” he groaned, at the combination of sucking, licking and light biting.
“A whole weekend, just by ourselves?” John said, turning to cuddle against his side.
-Queen Victoria:  She was the Queen from 1937, at age of 18, to her death in 1901.  After her beloved husband died in 1861, “Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism in the United Kingdom (the political movement of moving from a monarchy to an elected head of state) temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered.” (Wikipedia)
John chuckled, tilting his head to give him better access.  “It’s good to have you finally admit it.  It would also mean doing more of this, as long as you are comfortable with it.”
-A/N:  There is just one more chapter to this short sequel.  I’ve done the draft and will post it as soon as I’ doing editing.  Thanks for reading.
“Mr. Holmes, I could say the same to you.  Welcome to our home,” John replied, his most charming doctor demeanour on display.  He had been dealing with the upper crust as patients and as guests at these parties for years now.  He had no illusions about men like this anymore.
Sherlock rolled away to peel off his underwear, looking so delicious completely nude. John ran an appreciative hand along the elegant curve of his back, delighting in the shiver that ran down Sherlock at his touch.  After a year, it was amazing that they were still so into each other.  He’d never had it this intense, for this long, with anyone else.  Was it from both being men?  Having higher sex drives?
Mrs. Hudson tilted her head slightly, obviously wondering what he was getting at. “That is correct.  He started his own practice.  Did you want to see him as a patient?”
Sherlock came into the bedroom, just wearing dark red boxer briefs, his eyes gleaming.
John touched the scars, and then kissed them all.  Sherlock had been tense at first, but by the end, he was relaxed, and breathing harder.  John loved his reactions, his small moans and gasps.
“When we started this, didn’t you say something about not being very sexual?” John chuckled.
John scoffed.  “You really have a selective memory.  Have you already deleted from your Mind Palace how much you were complaining about being cold an hour ago?”
After many exchanged letters, Sherlock had agreed to come for tea.  It was a shorter, less formal visit than a full meal.  John was happy that it wouldn’t be a long evening of forced politeness.
“Molly bought Sherlock some cupcakes for his birthday. That one was for Rosie,” John explained.
-I think John in this fic is slightly smaller 'downstairs' than average, but doesn't have a micropenis.  Small enough that he feels a bit self-conscious about it with lovers, but it looks normal when flaccid.  Not much of a grower.  But he makes up for it with his 'special skills'.
They left the west wing, locking the door behind them, and moved towards the ballroom.  The orchestra was already warming up, and uniformed staff were rushing along the corridors, laden with trays of food and bottles of wine.  The monthly party was always a chance for the house staff to pull together and shine, completely dazzle the guests.  Word had gotten out that this party was even more special, and they were rising to the challenge.
“Um, OK,” Sherlock said, shifting to lie on his back.  “But I should warn you.  I’m not as responsive as other people.  I’m not as sexual.  Maybe it’s low hormones or just the way I am.”
of what John & Sherlock could likely see in their microscope.  Watch it on mute.  Around 20 second mark, Red blood cells (RBC) are very visible.  Around the 40 second mark, the larger White blood cells (leukocytes) can be seen.
“Having raunchy gay sex?” John joked, feeling very relaxed and happy.
Mycroft blinked at the question, and he got that same expression that always bothered Sherlock when they were boys.  A smirk with a gleam in his eyes that said he knew more than Sherlock did, and thought he had the upper hand.
John almost jumped when he felt something pressing against his thigh.  Realizing what it was, he glanced over at Sherlock.  Was this a thing now?  Was he going to let Sherlock tuck his feet under his leg whenever they were sitting close to each other in the living room?
“Oh, I-“ John started, stumbling over what to say.  He normally had time to prepare what to say, how to explain to a new lover, give them a warning.  He hadn’t with Sherlock yet, and tensed up defensively.  How would he react?
“Not now?” John asked, glancing down at his boyfriend’s erection.  He was tired, but he wanted to please him too.
Mrs Hudson held up the crushed cupcake container, with half the contents still smeared across the hardwood floor.
-Louis Pasteur (1822-1895):  “He was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine.  His works are credited to saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honoured as the "father of bacteriology" and as the "father of microbiology" (together with Robert Koch, and the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.” (Wikipedia).
Shifting down the bed, he traced a new ice cube down John’s fully hard cock.  Moaning loudly, John looked down at the gorgeous man lying between his outstretched legs, slurping his way up the side of his erection, and knew he was a very lucky man.  His hand went into Sherlock’s hair, clenching into the curls, when he swirled the ice around the tip, and then took it into his mouth, tongue repeating the motion.  “Oh my God,” John moaned, closing his eyes tight at the sensations.
He ran a hand along Sherlock’s right arm, feeling the muscles shifting with his strokes.  “Fuck, this is like my own private sex show.  A beautiful man, lost in his pleasure.  Sweaty.  Tasty...,” he leaned closer to lick at a drip of sweat running down Sherlock’s neck.
