The officer, whose daunting eyebrows cut him an intimidating expression, peered behind him at the shivering woman huddled on the steps. When he didn’t immediately respond, Castiel called out “Anna!”
The two of them headed back into the hallway, Castiel pointing out the two remaining names on the list. “Hamon or Paschal. Try to find their display.”
It shouldn’t feel dirty. It shouldn’t feel wrong. He shouldn’t still feel the heat of the flames fanning his shame from eleven years ago.
Castiel let the silence stretch on, aching for Dean to meet him halfway. Him showing up at the hotel again, now here, it renewed the hope that had been quashed when he walked out the door. He hoped it meant something, but even standing at the foot of his bed, Dean felt too far away.
The spirit’s form flickered again as his face twisted and he reared back, about to rush them. Dean braced for getting flung against the wall or worse, but it didn’t come; a long overhead slash dissipated the ghastly saint, revealing Sam wielding a crowbar. “Dude, let’s go.”
But Dean scrunched his face. “Well…half real. It’s Winchester. Dean Winchester.” He still reached over and shook Cas’s hand. “Bulsara is, uh, it’s Freddie Mercury’s given name.”
“Some demon tracked me down,” Dean said, looking around like any of the bystanders flocking to see the ruckus might be its new host. Chances were high; it seemed to like a show. “Cas got hurt.”
Dean held his ground as Dr. Novak searched his gaze, but it was difficult not to squirm. The doctor tilted his head to the side just so, and said, “Am I supposed to take your advice when you don't even believe in it, Agent Bulsara?”
Sam was deadly quiet, the shadows of the falling night cutting across his face, hiding his expression from Dean. “We can still figure out a way to save you.”
Alex took a deep breath but then seemed to lose his nerve, shaking his head. “Nevermind, I should go. Thanks for the notes and everything.”
From there, they fell into an easy rapport, bantering back and forth like they hadn’t met only hours ago. Dean even offered him the last few cheese curds, which Castiel got the impression that that put him in a select group of individuals. Soon, over an hour had passed and most of the dinner crowd started to clear out.
“Hey, that’s not fair.” Dean held up his hand, then shrugged. “Well, the relationship part is true, but I respect women.”
It was much shorter than Cas’s other messages, but Dean figured he deserved that. It’d taken him hours to compose that one sentence, though. He’d trashed a full-length essay, workshopped ten different versions of ‘please don’t give up on me,’ and spent twenty minutes on thesaurus.com looking for alternatives for the word ‘date’ before he decided to throw caution to wind.
“Tell that to your brothers,” she said. “They have a little too much of their father in them for their own good. Your sisters make a point to visit at least once a year, but I don’t see much of the boys anymore.”
“No, it’s not—” Dean ripped the door open and clenched his jaw, steeling himself to look up at Cas. When he did, Castiel saw the sorrow spilling over, its flood masking the fear underneath. “I just can’t.”
Dean eyed a few women in high heels and sleek professional dresses, and a group of men all wearing ties and shiny black Oxfords. “Damn, how dressed up do you need to be to hear about the devil being a dick?”
“Not for another couple weeks,” he answered, “but I’ve never taught a full semester course like this. The summer class was just an intense few weeks, but now I have to stretch enough material to cover through December.”
They had circled or underlined only a handful of names from the extensive list, but only a few of them sounded familiar. He ruled out the women first, and that left seven names to choose from.
Sam was still tapping away at his computer when Dean answered the call of his pillow. The tension in the room was still palpable, and Dean didn’t think that would make Sam amenable to letting him check his email. Cas hadn’t called back since they had driven into New York, and Dean took that as a sign that his case was going well.
A shout followed by another glass case shattering pulled his attention, and from across the room he watched Conrad crawl backwards, propped up on his elbows, as the ghostly figure advanced on him. This time it was Dean that lunged forward with the crowbar, but just before he reached it, the figure threw out his hand and Dean went flying across the room.
“Because I think I like the guy, okay? Because I like…guys. Happy?” Dean closed his eyes, regretting his tone as soon as it escaped him. Sam didn’t do anything to deserve being bitched at.
But he blinked back his surprise, tempering his voice to its usual gentle timbre. “None of this is your fault—or
Sam waited in the courtyard, and he jogged over to meet Dean when he finally made his way out of the hotel. “What’s going on?”
But Sam scoffed, shaking his head. “Looks like the deaths put the opening of their new exhibit on hold.” He scanned farther. “The exhibit’s headed by two different curators. Sounds like a good place to start.”
“You’ll see; we’re up second,” Castiel told him. He grabbed his drink and swiveled around so he could watch the show, crossing one knee over the other.
Family came up in conversation often, with Dean confiding in Cas his concerns about Sam, telling him as much as he could without revealing how Sam had come back to life. Cas took everything in stride like he’d been dealing with resurrected brothers and demon-killing guns his entire life. Even if he didn’t have any answers, he provided a sympathetic ear, someone Dean didn’t feel like he had to put on a front for. Cas, in turn, told him about all his siblings which made Dean feel like he lucked out having only Sam to worry about.
“This is Dr. Milton,” Castiel gestured to Anna, “and I’m Dr. Novak. We’re colleagues in charge of the exhibit in question.”
Dean stared at the plants for a moment before his eyes slid over to Castiel. “Do you turn everything into a poem?”
century occultists and mathematicians, Enochian provides us a lens through which we’re able to deliberate symbolic, cultural influence. Rather than argue over the authenticity of their claims, to debate angels and demons or man, I encourage you to instead approach Enochian as theoretical, linguistic artwork. Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder—perhaps truth lies within the mind of the interpreter. Thank you.”
Dean fished around in his pocket until he pulled out a scrap of paper. He tapped it against his fingers a few times, walking slowly over to set it on Castiel’s side table. “That’s my emergency number, and an email. If you ever need anything.” He emphasized ‘emergency’ just a little too strong, but Castiel got the message all the same.
Castiel picked up his bowl and pushed out his chair, leaning over to kiss his mother on the forehead. “I love you.”
With a sniff, Dean swiped his hand across his nose and finally turned around, forcing his expression neutral. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Just all this religious crap made me think of it. For a people that preach peace and love, they can do some pretty messed up shit, huh?”
Only the shadowy outline of him was visible, but Dean recognized the gruff but fretful tone. “Damn it, Cas.”
“I’m glad you didn’t,” he said, holding his glass steady while she poured. “As complex as our history is here, it still means everything to have a little paradise to come home to.”
He turned back to her, playfully backhanding her shoulder. “Mom, I’m in my thirties, not in high school.” She didn’t even have to say anything before he added, softer, “Is it that obvious?”
Castiel reached out and laid a hand on Dean’s knee. Dean almost pulled away, like an instinct, but he stopped. “Not to sound ungrateful,” Cas began, “since Conrad and I undoubtedly owe you our lives…but there is an absurd amount of property damage back there. Not to mention your brother set fire to an artifact worth thousands of dollars.
“I think I always knew,” he continued, turning the wrapper over in his hands, “but once dad sort of caught on, well…” He didn’t say anymore, and he knew he didn’t have to.
If you’re wondering what I lied about, I’m writing this correspondence from my new (temporary) desk at a university. Yes, Professor Novak at your service. While I hoped not to return to a life tethered to a desk, I needed the money, and they offered me the opportunity to work while I research my book. I’m teaching a religions course for the summer quarter. If you ever change your mind about giving it the old college try, I’d be happy to have you.
As Sam strode down the hallway, Dean felt his stomach grumble and turned back to the office. When he pushed the door open, Cas flinched, straightening to attention. When their eyes met, Dean recognized the all too familiar terror eating away at him, and the poor guy didn’t even know the real threat. Never would, if he was lucky.
“Right, well, those are the greatest hits, so to speak.” Castiel rounded the corner and held up a hand, stopping Dean from going any further. Police tape still cordoned off the whole area where Jonah’s body had been found. He could swear it almost felt colder here. “That’s…um, that’s where Jonah was killed. Up against the far wall.” The most gruesome aspects of the crime scene had been wiped away by the forensic crews, but the jagged holes in the stone were more than enough to paint a vivid picture in his mind.
Castiel laughed at the joke in spite of himself, clipping on his badge and grabbing his key ring. “Ask him how the weather is up there.”
He searched Castiel’s face for some kind of forgiveness, even if it meant he didn’t want him there anymore. But Castiel cocked his head to one side, sticking out his bottom lip. “Isn’t that just the sweetest thing?” he said. “Really just makes you want to cry, huh?”
Sam barely glanced up from his laptop, a half-eaten banana in his hand. “You want to go out on another case? I still haven’t caught up on sleep from Lincoln.”
He unlocked the door and stepped inside, and Dean followed, trying not to gape at the digs. With a king size bed, plush carpets, and glittering chandelier, it was easily the most expensive hotel room Dean had ever been in. Castiel walked past the bed into a lounge area that was sectioned off by a folding glass divider. “Damn,” Dean said, joining him and collapsing onto one of the champagne-colored sofas, “most of the motels we stay at still have body shaped tape on the carpet.”
“I’m actually leaving for an appointment soon,” Anna said. “If you give me a couple minutes, you can just use my desk.”
The old farmhouse had seen many renovations, but its bones were over a hundred years old. The bright blue shutters were a modern touch against the aged white siding and brick chimney, an original feature. The wrapped porch creaked and groaned when they reached the steps, and Cas remembered sprawling out on the floor by the rocking chair there to listen to their father’s stories. Hearing his father tell Bible stories was where his love for the book first originated. His father had a captivating way of spinning the tales as if he were there; Castiel and his siblings could never get enough.
“It’s a psychology thing,” Cas lied, his mind racing as he tried to decide what to do next. If Alex was in danger, he had to do something. But if that meant desecrating a grave? The thought made him sick to his stomach. “Just remember that the best thing you can do is not keep these feelings bottled up. I’m glad you came to talk to me.”
“Don’t worry,” Castiel assured her. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll do most of the talking if you want, as much as I can anyway.”
“Feels like longer sometimes,” Castiel acquiesced with a long-suffering sigh. “My Bachelor’s is in Fine Arts, and I studied painting mostly. But I always loved art as a culture—I enjoy making art, but what I’m passionate about is seeing how it affects people, inspires them, brings them together. It’s so fundamentally…human, the way we are driven to express ourselves and grapple with concepts beyond our understanding through art.” He caught up to himself, suddenly shy, and he rubbed the back of his neck. “Which is just a flowery way of saying I went to get my Master’s in Art History, which is how I found my way into museums. From there, I pursued my doctorate in religious iconography, and my thesis was mostly to do with Biblical studies.” He felt his cheeks further redden when he realized Dean had listened with rapt attention, taking in every word.
“That depends on a lot of things,” Dean told him, “and again, not really something you can look up in a textbook. It’s possible, but is that a risk you’re willing to take?”
Castiel huffed a laugh. “I figured, although it would explain the alarm system if the perpetrator had no corporeal form.”
Dean cracked his knuckles one at a time, taking a few extra seconds to think of a response as he just reveled in hearing that voice again. “Not great stats there, no. Does that mean you have good news for me?”
The realization hit Castiel with a cold dread just a split second before he heard it said aloud: “St. Peter was crucified upside down.”
Castiel skimmed through the booklet of available tunes and told his selection to the woman, but Dean couldn’t read lips well enough to tell. When Cas returned, his spread his arms. “Well, what have I been signed up for?”
Dean polished off the last of his Coke and set the glass down with a resounding thud. “Not for nothing, but if there was ever another person that would understand a complicated relationship with religion…” He gestured to himself.
As she disappeared, Sam stuck his hands in his pockets and leaned back against one of the empty lab tables.  “Why do I get the feeling that you’re not buying this theory?” he asked.
Sam squirmed in his Carhartt and ripped jeans, and a woman came up to them, not bothering to hide the patronizing sweeping look at Dean’s leather and plaid. “Is there something I can help you with?” she asked, voice pinched.
“Why am I your responsibility?” Sam said, his voice rising. He wasn’t yelling, but there was desperation there. “Because dad told you to look out for me? I’m a grown man now, Dean. If you believed everything dad said, you wouldn’t have just told me what you did about Cas. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and you matter just as much as anyone else.”
“Sammy, lemme use your laptop,” Dean said. With his feet kicked up on the arm of Bobby’s couch, he motioned for Sam to bring it over.
He was disarmingly close, and if Dean wasn’t so overwhelmed by the haunting possibilities in front of him, he would have more time to be distracted by that. As it were, he puffed out his cheeks and released the breath. “Damn. That’s a lot of dead guys.”
He could read Sam like a book, and he was sure it went both ways. Sam eyed him, probably certain something was up, but he couldn’t put his finger on what. So he just said, “Yeah, pretty crazy…” He let the moment drift away before he slipped into the bathroom and the shut the door behind him.
“I don’t blame you for what happened,” Castiel said slowly. He meant it. Despite their friendship’s incredibly short tenure, Cas couldn’t bring himself to believe Dean had a malicious bone in his body. Misguided, angry, hurting maybe. But at his core, he knew Dean wanted to help people, to save them. And Cas knew enough to see that when Dean failed to do that, it ate away at him, piece by piece.
In spite of the grim situation, Cas sat down on his bed with a smile, his stomach fluttering. “I’m sorry to call so late,” he said. “I hope you know I wouldn’t bother you if it wasn’t for a good reason.”
He still felt like he could sleep another twenty-four hours like nothing, but a different pain gnawed at his stomach, and he realized how hungry he was. “Would it possible to have something to eat?”
the label. Deep down, he knew that was ridiculous, and he knew he didn’t need a label to make his feelings real. But he still envied people like Cas, who could so confidently and without fear speak who they were.
They stopped in Sundance, Wyoming for the night, picking up some grubby diner food and parking the Impala at a rest stop. Sam stretched his long legs out in the back seat, facing opposite Dean. Dean picked at the food in his uncharacteristic silence, the grease settling heavy in his stomach. The burger tasted bland, and he hated that he craved those cheese curds from the diner with Cas.
Cas smiled when she saw right through him, and against his better judgment he opened his laptop again. “There’s no way to say any of this without it sounding completely embarrassing.”
Resisting the urge to throw himself on the bed like a teenager, Castiel instead pushed open the door to his balcony and stepped out into the summer air. His room faced the enclosed courtyard, and he preoccupied himself with people watching for a while, thinking about all the winding paths each of them walked to bring them to this spot. Which paths were predetermined? Which were forged? Maybe you never really knew. Maybe it was enough to enjoy the journey.
I know you intended for this email to be emergency only, so I just want to assure you that I’m not in any danger. If you respond back telling me to stop, I will, but I know I would regret it if I didn’t try to reach you. I’ve known you only a brief time, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that you changed my life. You’re something special, Dean. I get the impression that even if people tell you that often, you don’t believe it. I believe it.
“It’s not that simple,” Dean muttered. He logged into his email account, heart pounding at the handful of notifications. He scanned through, dismissing the spam, and bit the inside of his lip at the sight of a reply from cnovak04. He flicked his eyes up to Bobby, but the man had already turned back to his project, paying Dean no mind.
“Oh, I have every faith in your capabilities,” Castiel assured him. “But as long as it’s okay with you, I would like to stay and help. As much as I tried to convince Anna otherwise, I can’t help but feel like all of this has to do with me.”
“It’s okay, mom. If I’m honest, it’s a little strange coming back to the text itself again. Working the curator job for so many years, I was just surrounded by what it inspired. It was easy enough to keep things separated in my mind that way, only having to deal with the relics and the paintings and the artifacts. But…reading the book now, yeah, it’s hard not to think of dad.” Cas brought his fist to his mouth, not expecting to confront those feelings in his attempts to avoid feelings about Dean, but a very poignant sadness washed over him anyway.
Castiel took his hand back, cupping both of them around his glass. “You think I earned that art degree with crayons?”
Dean didn’t buy for a second that Sam was going to let the situation lie, but he’d cross that bridge when they came to it. For the time being, it was enough to let the familiar routine take over. The motels, roadside diners, long stretches of open road, the rush of the hunt, the wash of relief when the job was done. It was a song Dean had memorized, and he could carry the tune without much of a second thought. It was the kind of autopilot he needed to keep from thinking about how terrified he was.
Another retreating pair of headlights flooded the room, and Dean looked over at the parked cars. “Is this the staff lot?” Cas nodded. “If your guy did show up, is this where he would come?”
When we talked about our parents, I told you about my mother. I hadn’t seen her in a long time, but I’m sitting in my old bedroom as I type this. I spent too long running from home when she was here with open arms all along. That was a blessing I took for granted. I know you don’t have the same opportunity, but I can tell you’re running from something too. Just don’t forget that you have people to fight for you; don’t take that support for granted.
Chewing on his lip, Cas inhaled deep through his nose. “Can I call you again if I run into trouble?” he asked, avoiding the question.
“Let’s get it down to one,” Dean said. “Sammy!” Out of breath and harried, Sam looked over from where he was hauling Conrad up. “Buy us a couple minutes, we’ve almost got him!” He dropped the crowbar on the floor and gave it a hard kick in Sam’s direction.
But Cas, even with the distance Dean put between them, was now faced with this world a third time, and Dean couldn’t ignore the sinking feeling that it wouldn’t be the last time either. He finally fell into a restless sleep, plagued with thoughts turned to dreams of Castiel plummeting into darkness.
Frowning, Sam tried to sound reassuring. “We’re going to do the best we can to make sure everyone else stays safe. Do you have a list of the people involved with the show? If it includes the character they play, that would be great.”
Dean typed out a reply and hit send without spending too much time second guessing his words. Despite his anxiety already spiking in anticipation of Castiel’s response, it was the most at peace he’d felt in a long time. It was small, but it was the first steps he’d taken in that direction of his life since John had burned it all away.
Shaking his head, Dean squinted up at the moon. “Being stuck in limbo like that, not being able to pass on to the afterlife…it twists people, drives ‘em crazy. Maybe what once was some kind of holy mission spent four hundred years rotting in the veil, coming out the other side like this.”
Once he spoke it, once he made it real, there would be no more rationalizing it away. And Dean didn’t know if he was ready for that. Admitting to one thing meant owning it all, and the tangled web he was stuck in wasn’t going to make that an easy task. The booming rock pumping from the radio pushed the sticky thoughts from his mind.
“Is this another boy you want but can’t have?” she said, the smile taking the sting out of the words.
Dean’s green eyes held a pool of murky despair, but it was barricaded, and Castiel could tell that whatever was fueling that sorrow wasn’t for him to know. Instead, he lifted his head so he could reach out toward Dean. “Well,
Cas fidgeted while Dean seemed intent on staring a hole through the table. “Is he, um, still around?”
The knock at the door sent him out of his skin, as lost in thought as he was. But when he gathered himself, his heart pounded against his ribcage. Maybe things weren’t so broken after all.
This time, Dean started to look away, but he brought himself back, and Castiel tried to immortalize that expression in his mind: some unbearable softness choking underneath a hardened shell, but reaching for the light all the same. If he had to make a guess, it would be that Dean hardly ever let himself feel anything, and maybe some days in this life he led that was for the better, but there was a part of him deep down screaming to heard.
Propping one arm on the back of the chair, Cas leaned over to point at the sections of the list. “So, the first part is the individual’s name, then their designation, followed by the type of remains we have, and lastly the method of display or containment,” he explained. “I know where most things are if you need to look at something, but if you need ID numbers or anything, just let me know.”
In all the warring back and forth with himself, Dean forgot to figure out what to say. He laughed, a bundle of nerves. “Hey.”
Hazy memories of his brothers and sisters chasing each other through the rows of vines and getting in trouble for trampling the family heritage flitted before his eyes. He imagined being that young and carefree again, the dirt on his knees and tangles in his hair, laughter echoing through the open sky. But he turned back to his mother, seeing the driveway from the same perspective where he watched his father drive away for the last time. Cas remembered why it took him so long to visit home again—for all the happy memories that lived here, this was also where he was abandoned, and that emptiness soaked into everything.
If there were any security guards on rounds, Dean didn’t encounter them. His heavy footfalls echoed ominously in the cavernous museum hallways. He retraced the path Castiel had taken him on the day before, skidding to a stop at the double doors that marked the entrance to the gallery. He jiggled the bar on the off chance that things would be easy for once in their lives, but it denied him. The key ring he’d swiped off Castiel had almost a dozen keys on it, indiscriminate aside from the colored caps on them. He fumbled the keys in the dim light until he found the orange one, hoping he recalled correctly.
“I can show you.” Castiel led Dean down the hall toward the new installation: a sunken amphitheatre. The stage at its center was taped off too, and Dean bounced down the shallow steps to reach it. Castiel followed and took a seat on a bench a few yards away.
“Awesome, keep me posted. Sam should be back any minute—hopefully he’s got something that’ll shed a little more light on this.”
“It’s late, I gotta get back.” Dean pushed himself off the couch and marched toward the door, and Castiel scrambled to follow him.
They stayed long enough for the police to gather their last details, then, after they both provided contact information, they escaped into Castiel’s car. As he drove them through the city, an uneasy silence descended upon them. He caught glances of her reflection in the window, staring out into the midnight black, gaze hollow.
“Fortunately, it’s a literature class—I don’t have to write sermons or anything. I’ll even get to talk a little about my research and religious artwork.”
“So what’s the play? I don’t think it’s gonna go over well if we just burn every single holy relic in the joint.” It was impractical obviously, but the fact remained that were going to have to burn something, and that presented a problem of its own. Dealing with the alarms and security system would be one thing, but Dean’s second thought flitted to how devastated Cas would be at the loss of something he worked so hard for.
Dean squinted too, like there was any mistaking the real reason he’d hauled them across the country. “Oh yeah,” he said. “Maybe so.”
“No one lives forever, Cas,” Dean said, draining the last of his whiskey. “Might as well make it the ride of your life.”
“I think I should have figured this out when you told me you were an FBI impersonating ghost hunter, but... you’re insane.”
“Well, now you’ve gone and jinxed it.” Dean threw up his hands in mock exasperation. “I’ll start looking into the history of the other disciples, see if there’s any pattern to the deaths.”
Sam took the photos back and inspected the marking again. “’False witness,’” he repeated. “Like the Ten Commandments?”
Cas opened the door wider, and Dean crossed the threshold, hands in his pockets. With the door shut, Castiel slipped around Dean and into the kitchenette. “I’m glad you’re here,” he said, splaying his hands on the counter.
A nurse hurried into his room, making note of his vitals on one of the screens. “Mr. Novak, glad to see you awake,” she said. She messed with some of the equipment, though Castiel could only guess its purpose. “How are you feeling?”
His mother pushed the door open and set his suitcase at the bottom of the stairs. “Would you like something to drink?” she asked. “We’re working on putting out a new white I think you’d like. Very sweet.”
Before he had time to panic, a dark shape covered him, and he blinked up at Dean crouched over him, both arms braced against the wall, shielding him with his body. Then there was a metallic click, a flare, and beyond Dean he could just barely make out the advancing figure stop and contort with screams as his body burned away to embers.
The wind died and the temperature warmed, and all at once it was eerily quiet. Dean’s breath tickled his ear, but with a herculean sigh he pushed off the wall and collapsed on his backside. The three of them sat in silence, catching their breath, regaining their bearings.
On the bench in front of the hotel, Cas waited for the taxi he’d called. He just didn’t know where he wanted it to take him yet. The world was his oyster, he supposed, but it felt lackluster on his own. An idea struck him, and he pulled out his phone, scrolling down to the contact he hadn’t made use of in far too long.
A few tears slipped out of Alex’s eyes, and he quickly wiped them away. “My dad didn’t just die,” he said, voice cracking. “He killed himself, and I think it was my fault.”
She gave him a gentle smile. “Unfortunately, you’re going to feel that way for quite a few days. The good news is, your surgery went perfectly, so with time you should make a full recovery.”
If he wasn’t listening for it, he would have missed Dean’s slight intake of as he slowly moved his hand back, letting his finger travel the ridge of knuckles and down along his thumb. For one beautiful second, Dean stretched his hand out in anticipation of the coming gap, but all too soon he tensed and snatched his hand against his chest. “I should go.”
Careful to keep his papers in hand, he stepped in and gave Dean a hug. It seemed to take him by surprise, but after a second he returned the hug with two quick thumps on the back. Cas pulled away, shifting his things so he could offer a handshake to Sam. “It’s good to see you guys; what brings you all the way out here?”
Castiel couldn’t help the smile that formed when he saw the two brothers, and he kicked himself for not realizing who must have been responsible for ensuring his safety. Vague recollections of Dean’s face over his swam in his memories, but once the demon had evacuated it was hard to remember through the haze of agony.
By the time they released him from the hospital, Castiel had to evaluate his life all over again. The conference board let him out of his contract, so he didn’t have to continue traveling around the country. Aside from the hit to his income, he was grateful for that. But that left him without a job, stuck in Utah with no one.
There will always be a little part of mind that hopes that you are okay out there, but I think this is a good time to admit to myself that this is enough. Best of luck, Dean.
Dean could tell Castiel was wavering, but he braced himself for the disappointment of being turned down. But Cas took a deep breath and scrubbed his face. “Fine,” he said at last, “but I get to pick the song.”
Dean looked at Sam, but his brother didn’t seem to have any input for him; he just kept his hands in his pockets, smiling down at Dean. When it was clear he wasn’t going to say anything, Dean cleared his throat. “Uh, yeah, sure. We’ll see if we can make it.”
“You’re like his protector, aren’t you?” Castiel asked. He stood up to get some glasses of water from the kitchenette.
When Dean returned with two disposable coffee cups and an armful of vending machine snacks, Castiel was still plugging away at his list. His dark hair appeared more unruly, but it suited him in a way. It gave the rest of his crisp, put-together image a wild edge, like there was an untamed spirit just waiting to break free of its vessel.
The question seemed to take Alex aback, and the reaction only intensified the dread rooting in Castiel’s bones. “Yeah…how did--?”
The hands covering his eyes could only belong to one person, the smell of her favorite lotion so familiar it almost made him cry. “Guess who, little cherub?”
A stupid smile worked its way onto his face as he stacked the flimsy motel pillows on top of each other and climbed into bed. It diminished all too quickly though, as the remorse seeped back into his thoughts. The burst of pride in his chest that he felt when he found out Cas was tackling a case on his own was devoured by the guilt that Dean had opened that door for him. A door that was impossible to close once someone had peeked through it. Dean survived on a haggard four hours of sleep a night so he could fight to keep that door closed for as many people as possible. It was too late for him, but if he was fast enough, smart enough,
When the door shut behind him, Castiel let out a breath and ran his hands through his hair. “You met him yesterday, Cas,” he said to himself. “And you thought he was a tool, get a hold of yourself.” He turned back to his task, flipping to the next page in the binder.
He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Shit, no. I meant to make some calls, but something else came up.”
They worked in silence for over an hour, the only sound the tapping of a keyboard or the scratching of a pen above the museum’s industrial ambience. Dean checked his watch when the hallways echoed with locking doors and fading footsteps, most employees heading home for the evening. He looked up at Castiel, who either ignored the departure of his colleagues or was too invested in his work to notice.
The knowledge hit Dean like a kick to the chest. After Maple Springs, they’d driven through downstate New York, keeping their ears to the ground. If he had to guess, he’d say Cas had to be no more than four hours away. His chest tightened.
--that’s my own choice. But I can’t get close to anyone else.” He breathed deep. “They’d just be another person I’m leaving behind.”
He drowned out the anxious thoughts and whispered conversations and delved back into his notes. But his concentration was cut short again, this time the culprit being his phone. Anna’s number glowed on the screen, and he hurried to flip it open. “Hello?”
Dr. Novak dropped his head at that and slowed to a stop, turning to face him. “No, that’s not—” He took a breath, loosely crossing his arms. “Jonah and Ezekiel were friends of mine; Ezekiel was even here because I personally recommended him. For them both to turn up dead like this in the name of an exhibit that was my idea? Let’s just say it’s hard not let it weigh on my conscience.”
The question took him off guard, and he fought the urge to react with incredulity. Of the two of them, Anna had always been the more grounded one—sometimes literally with her archaeology background. For her to wonder about something as implausible as magical influence, whatever she’d seen must have really shaken her.
They tossed their meager belongings in the Impala and Dean pulled around front while Sam took care of check out. Dean watched his brother trudge back to the car and couldn’t help feeling like Sam’s shoulders slumped with an unseen burden. They’d go on pretending like everything was okay until they couldn’t anymore—that was their way. And Sam was right: Dean had made a selfish call, but it was one he was ready to live with.
Cas pressed his fingers below his eyes, trying to keep the tears from falling. “I’m sure you weren’t planning on interrupting your Hell’s Kitchen marathon for a conversation like this,” he joked, trying to laugh.
Coming from anyone else, being invited back to a hotel room from a bar would have been the surest sign of a come-on, but this was Castiel. He made the request sound innocent enough, but Dean’s mouth still went dry. Maybe drinks were a good idea.
Castiel gathered his notes and stepped away from the podium to scattered applause, pausing to shake the hand of the moderator as they crossed paths. He concentrated on manifesting a clear path to his hotel room, hoping a nap and room service were in his near future, assuming nobody stopped him to insist that his presentation was a complete farce. When he agreed to join this conference circuit, the booking agent said nothing about how the primary demographic was the type to disagree with everything they heard unless it was quoted from the Bible. But maybe he should have expected that.
“Oh, hi, cherub. I didn’t even look at the caller ID; I’ve been catching up on Hell’s Kitchen. The season finale is tomorrow.”
Dean nodded and set off to the task, taking one side of the hall while Castiel took the other. Cas could almost hear a clock ticking down in the back of his mind. Chewing his lip, he jumped from one case to the next, trying not to think about the brawl in the gallery.
Before he knew it, he and Cas were exchanging emails almost once a day. Once the dam was broken, Dean stopped worrying about crafting the perfect one-liners and analyzing every single word. Cas didn’t care about being performative, and it was so much more real when they stopped spending so much time verbally dancing around each other and just spoke the truth. Dean confessed things to Cas that he hadn’t even told Sam; being open about his sexuality was brand new to him, but it was liberating to talk about it to someone who understood him, understood the journey. Cas told him stories about the first time he kissed a boy in high school, how he came out to his mother. Dean envied the happy ending of it all, telling Cas how he never had the chance to have the same stories.
The security guard waved them through, and they retraced their steps to the prep room from the day before. The main area was lined with shelves and drawers, stacked with documents and boxes. Dean figured there must be some kind of system, but it looked chaotic to him. The rest of the room was sectioned off according to purpose: restoration, photography, documentation. To the right was an area that was vaguely reminiscent of the high school science labs that Dean didn’t bother paying attention in, but this was clearly more advanced. A couple of technicians stood working around a ventilation tube that curled down from the ceiling, and beyond them Dean spotted Anna talking to a frantic man in a sweater.
“Well…no. I mean, I’m alright, but I think—I’m worried I might have another case on my hands.” He quickly explained what happened with Alex, telling him about the signs and similarities to the ghost back at the museum.
Dean heard Sam sprinting through the laboratory not far ahead. When he emerged into the wide open room, he saw his brother’s silhouette scrambling around in the dark. The exit toward the museum exhibits was to the left, but Sam disappeared to the right.
Sam furrowed his brow as he rolled up the paper and tucked it under his arm. “Listen, I agreed to the whole ‘one last ride’ thing, but you don’t gotta bring it up every five minutes.”
Dean didn’t laugh, didn’t even acknowledge him, just stood with his hands in his pockets and his eyes cast down. Sam at least pretended to be amused, and he tried to nudge Dean into speaking. When he didn’t, Sam cleared his throat and said, “We’re, uh, glad you’re doing alright. They told us about the procedure and everything.”
Blushing, Castiel ran a hand through his hair. “I mean, maybe, but how am I supposed to continue the conversation when I feel like such an idiot?”
Sam rolled his eyes, but he closed his laptop. “It’s not much of a bet when you take the only clearly plausible option.”
The Impala roared along the highway, leaving the east coast in their rearview. As much as Dean wished they’d hit up Atlantic City while Sam still had the rabbit’s foot, it was nice to see his brother loosen up a bit, regardless of their gambling fortunes. And after Bela had taken off with their lotto winnings, they were due for a cash grab. Unfortunately, Dean had better luck at the pool table than the craps table, but it was better than nothing. Maybe he wouldn’t manage to say as much to Sam, but at this point he valued their time together more than money.
He hovered in indecision, cursing under his breath. All their gear was still in the trunk—it wasn’t exactly inconspicuous as an FBI agent to come waltzing in carrying a loaded shotgun. If he ran now, he had the chance to head Conrad off, but should the spirit show up, all he had on him was a flask of holy water. Useless. If they tried to make a break for the car, they risked the ghost intervening, either getting to Conrad first or locking them out when they tried to get back in.
“I never saw anything personally, but they said none of the alarms were tripped, and the video itself just goes to static right before they’re killed. Which is perplexing since the museum spends a lot of money on the security system.” Castiel hugged his arms around himself, the creeping dread settling in his stomach the longer they stood around.
Castiel inhaled shakily, scrubbing his jaw. Some indecipherable look passed between the agents, and Cas felt out of his depth. But another thought occurred to him, digging the pit deeper. “Agent May—”
The seats squeaked as Sam shifted forward, resting his elbows on the back of the front seat. “I don’t understand why this is literally the hill you’re willing to die on,” Sam said, the hint of an edge in his voice. “As long as it’s been you and me, we always fight to do the right thing. To find the way that saves people. I can’t believe that there’s a world where saving you isn’t the right thing.”
There was silence on the other end, and for a few terrible seconds Cas was afraid he was going to hang up. But then, softer: “Cas…hey.”
But lurking underneath, that word had a fatal permanence to it. One which Dean could feel coming all too acutely.
The tears spilled over, and Alex brought one hand up to cover his face, trying to stifle it as best he could. “I’m sorry,” he choked out. He took a minute to compose himself, and when he was breathing normally, he said, “I’ll miss class on Thursday for his funeral.”
Dean’s smile hurt him more than the probable concussion.  “I know you have, like, five degrees and are smart as hell, but…try and let this one lie? The world just got a whole lot bigger for you, be careful not to get lost in it.”
Alex held his book close to his chest and wove through the desks to the front of the room. The meek behavior was a stark contrast to his normally sunny optimism. Cas was never as perpetually cheery as that, but the kid’s dedication and fascination with his craft reminded him of his own college days. Maybe that’s why seeing Alex so broken hurt so much.
He missed his trusty boots and worn-in denim, the suit stifling as he ran. He tugged loose the tie while he searched for any sign of Conrad or the spirit. Heading in the direction of the stage, he passed through the hallway of reliquaries. They’d narrowed down the massive list to sixteen names, but that was still too wide a net to cast. Right now, the priority had to be taking the target out of the picture—if the spirit had nothing to draw its attention, it might buy them enough time to take sixteen down to one.
But the prospect of digging up Alex’s dead father wasn’t lost on him, and he prayed he could find a way to ensure it didn’t come to that. There became the matter of figuring out where to begin. He sat up and fetched his laptop. If there was one aspect of hunting, he knew he could tackle, it was research.
Dean didn’t answer, but the sudden cut of the music caught them both off guard. A voice on a microphone spoke out, and Castiel searched the room until he noticed a woman on a small stage at the opposite end of the lounge.
Dean watched him make his way up to the stage, his white shirttails rumpled where they were untucked in the back. It was far more casual than the way he had dressed at the museum, with his tailored vests and matching ties. Despite being covered nearly head to toe, it was somehow like catching him in a state of undress. Dean tried not to think about the distinct lack of layers.
Getting drunk again to distract himself from the torrent of emotions swirling inside him was only a little appealing, but the headache convinced him to reach for a glass of water instead. As he drank deeply, a tiny voice in the back of his head wanted to celebrate—
Cas rolled his eyes. “Nevermind.” The doors pinged and slid open, and Castiel led him down the hall, lifting his shirt to pull his keycard out of his back pocket. “I might be surrounded by crazy people all day, but I can’t say they don’t compensate well.”
Dean looked at his hands clasped between his propped up knees, and Castiel thought he might actually look embarrassed. “Yeah, maybe a couple times,” Dean said.
Anna sighed, tucking her hair behind her ear. “Neil. He’s another one of the actors for the interactive exhibit, and he just told me he quit. Not the first, either. And I can’t blame them, can I?”
“Cas, do you hear me?” Dean yelled over the gathering wind. He jostled him again and Castiel finally blinked his shock away, concentrating instead on Dean’s intense stare.
“Absolutely,” Cas said. He gathered his things and gestured to the door. “We can talk in my office.” Alex was silent through the hallways, staring at his feet as they walked. He’d visited for office hours on several occasions, eager to discuss his opinions and learn from Castiel’s experience. Castiel readily encouraged Alex’s professional curiosity, but he had also taken on a mentor role in a more personal capacity. While he didn’t broadcast it, Castiel didn’t hide the fact that he was gay, and he had a soft spot for students struggling to emerge and find their place in the community. When Alex told him about being transgender, Castiel immediately felt the urge to take him under his wing, the experience hitting close to home. He told Alex about his sister’s transition, something he hadn’t even brought up to Dean.
Dean waved him off, dropping his head back. “Ah, that was nothing. There are some big bad motherfuckers out there.”
“I love you too, darling, but let me take care of the dishes. I know you’ve got an email in your fingertips itching to be written.” She winked.
The two men stood straighter as they were addressed, and they both flashed their badges with a practiced flourish. The tall one spoke first: “Yes, we’re looking for Anna Milton? I’m Agent May, this is my partner, Agent Bulsara.”
“Hey,” he said, brushing a stray tear from his cheek. “Any chance you’ve got space in the guest room this week?”
“Cherub, I’ve seen you naked covered head to toe in honey to become one with the bees, I think everything is uphill from there.”
Castiel nodded, extending an arm to direct him toward the right through the gallery. “Yes, it’s been a huge effort that Anna and I have been working on for years. The idea was to showcase art and relics that allowed the viewer to follow the life of Christ from His conception to His ascension, and all the lives He touched while he walked the earth. We’ve petitioned churches and other museums for hundreds of artifacts. God only knows how many letters I’ve written the Vatican.”
Dean let the question go unanswered, dropping his gaze as he stepped around Sam to walk down the hospital hallway. The Maple Springs case didn’t turn out at all like they suspected, with fairy tale murders and comatose ghost children. It was a ridiculous premise, but the aftermath hit him harder than he expected it to.
As he climbed out of the shower and toweled off, he stared down his reflection in the mirror. The face looking back at him seemed too young and too old all at once, the eyes having seen more than should but not enough. He heard his dad’s voice in his head: “I put too much on your shoulders. I made you grow up too fast.” And yet, those words from the same man that sent him to Riverton, Wyoming all on his own.
At last, he cleared his throat, rising to his feet with the pictures clutched in his hands. The boys looked up, all ears. “So, Enochian’s tricky,” he began, coming out from behind his desk to approach their side of the room, “it’s not exactly a direct translation, but my best interpretation would be that it means ‘false witness.’ But sort of like a label? A scarlet letter, you could say.”
Despite having the luxury of both a home office and his desk at the museum, Castiel preferred to set up shop at Rocky’s after a long day. Of course, he never brought anything with him he was afraid of losing—it was next to impossible to bring something into the diner without it leaving dipped in grease. Still, armed with a cheap notebook and a copy of an article on Christian symbolism, he sat hunched over the counter, idly doodling in the margins as he read.
“Don’t do that to yourself,” Castiel chided her softly. He spared a polite smile for the waiter as they dropped off the cheese curds. “You couldn’t have known—”
“Castiel,” Dean said, rolling the name around on his tongue like he was tasting a new food. “Do you mind if I call you Cas?”
Dean turned away, biting down hard on the inside of his cheek. “If there’s not a way to save me, then there’s no point. What I believe about myself aside, I can’t ask Cas to willingly board a sinking ship.”
“Agent May wants a list of all the human remains we have on display,” he answered, making a face. “I’m a little afraid to ask why.”
The slip of paper was right where he left it, and he held the phone with the dialed number in his hand, hesitating. Even with their recent email correspondence, there was still a distance between them that felt comfortable, necessary. For Dean’s sake more than his, maybe, but that was okay. He hadn’t actually heard Dean’s voice in months, and that felt like a bridge he wasn’t supposed to cross.
Warily, Castiel settled into the seat beside Dean, casting an anxious glance at his old spot across the table, the one that kept him a safe distance away. “Okay, let’s hear it.”
Grumbling, Dean finished off his shooter and picked a second one. “If we’re being cutthroat, I’m gonna assume that you’re one of those people who reads their horoscope every morning.”
Leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, Dean interlaced his fingers. “I don’t know how much of a chance you stand at beating me at a drinking game, but I respect the confidence.”
Sam eventually caught back up to him as they made their way out to the car, the mood between them tense and heavy again. They went through the motions, the routine so second-nature to them both that they barely had to exchange words. Motel, dinner, gear check, research, sleep. Rinse and repeat. Dean had the unsettling thought that he could live the rest of his life on autopilot, just wind him up and set him loose. Maybe the demon deal was a little above his paygrade, but he had no doubt he could take down his fair share of things that go bump in the night before his time was up. Whether his heart was in it or not.
Castiel’s singing voice wasn’t anything to write home about, but he kept the tune well enough, and the gravelly edge to it lent itself to gritty feel of the song. As much as he had protested, he seemed to lean into the performance, miming along to the lyrics. He pointed his fingers like he was firing a gun at Dean: “Out of the doorway the bullets
Castiel thought. Plain brown robes. “Hamon!” he shouted. “It’s Hamon!” He and Dean read frantically, every second passing feeling a little more like failure. The sinking feeling that Hamon was one of the few displays they hadn’t prepped yet, therefore still sitting back in the labs, started weighing on him.
It sounded silly for some reason to say it out loud, but Castiel told him, “Anna and I always come here the cheese curd flight. There’re two different batters and four dipping sauces.”
“We all have room to grow, Dean, drink up.” Castiel relaxed back into his chair, chin lifted and a smug little smile on his face.
Isidore, Gerard, Paschal, Hamon, Stanislaus.” He dug through his memories, thinking back to school and his religious studies. An image of St. Gerard came to mind, a modest looking man with close-cropped hair gracing a prayer card for expecting mothers. It didn’t fit. Stanislaus Kostka had died young, but Castiel remembered a marble sculpture of the boy—too young and small to be the terrifying figure in the gallery.
Dean dropped his gaze and wouldn’t look at him, and it was difficult not to read the gesture as shame. But that didn’t make sense. Castiel waited for them to explain what he was sure was something obvious, something the professionals would see as a pattern in this case that he was missing. But Sam opened his mouth, struggling for words.
Dean gripped the foot of the bed, his knuckles white. “If I hadn’t come here, you wouldn’t be hurt. Simple as that. So don’t try and tell me it’s not my fault.”
As they stood face to face, it was hard not to notice the stormy blue of his eyes. They had a trustworthy depth to them, and Dean found himself believing the sincerity of the words. He slipped his hands in his pockets and huffed a sigh as well. “For what it’s worth, I know a thing or two about heavy consciences. I can’t say it goes away, but it does get easier.”
He shuffled off the plane, careful in the crowd to protect his wound, and made his way to the baggage claim. He kept his eyes peeled for familiar faces, but with his attention divided between the luggage carousel and the shifting throngs of people, he missed her approach.
Castiel stood up and went around to put a hand on Alex’s shoulder. “Whatever happened, nothing good will come from you blaming yourself. It’s normal to feel guilt tangled up with the grief, especially if things were tenuous. But trust me when I say that holding on to that blame will only make you sick.”
But Dean recovered, clearing his throat and rotating on the stool to face forward. A waiter dropped off a menu for him and he spent a few minutes reading it over. Castiel tried to surreptitiously watch him as he did so, studying the slope of his nose, the little pinch and protrusion of his brow, the chiseled cut of his jaw. And god, his eyelashes. What a beautiful subject he would make.
As the months slipped by, Dean tried desperately to keep Castiel’s voice in his head. It was so distinct, but the longer time went by without hearing it, it started to muddle in his memory. He’d made the intentional choice to give his number to Cas, but to not take Castiel’s in return. He knew the temptation would be too great. And through some unspoken pact, they’d avoided sharing any identifiable details in their messages. Dean knew that Castiel was teaching a literature class at a college, but he could have been anywhere from California to Maine. And Dean moved around so much that even if Cas had wanted to track him down, Dean wouldn’t be in one place long enough to find.
They approached the entrance and stepped into the gilded lobby, immediately and keenly aware of how much they stuck out. Sam stuck his hands in his jacket pockets, leaning over slightly to whisper, “Should we…go grab the FBI suits?”
Castiel didn’t say anything for a few moments. “I’m worried about Alex,” he finally said. “He traded one poisonous feeling for another. And as long as he continues to be confronted by his dad, he’s not going to be able to put this behind him.” A shuddering sigh rasped over the phone’s speaker. “I just—I don’t know if I can do this your way.”
“I just feel like it wouldn’t hurt to treat ourselves every now and again.” Dean sat down heavily on the bed. “Especially now, since—” He cut himself off, but he could see that Sam had finished the sentence on his own anyway.
“Damn, I’m sorry,” Dean said, rubbing his neck and blinking like he just figured out what he said. “That was…a lot to just throw out there. Needless to say, I got some family issues.” He finally looked back up at Castiel. “What about you? Are you close with your folks?”
“Reliquaries. Dr. Milton mentioned that a big part of the new exhibit was a bunch of pieces, literally: bones of the apostles, teeth from saints, hair and clothes. All kinds of human remains.”
“Some of those pieces are incredibly valuable, but nothing’s been stolen so far. Do you think this is about money?” He flipped the binder open, trailing a finger down the page until he found what he was looking for, then he clicked open a blank document on the computer.
When they sat down in Castiel’s office, Alex bounced his knee, still avoiding eye contact. Cas kicked the door stop, propping it open before he made his way to his desk. “So, what can I do for you, Alex?” he asked, keeping his tone light.
“Since when is a museum your idea of fun?” Sam asked with a disbelieving grin. Pushing out his chair, he followed suit and packed away his laptop before pulling the article closer.
The silence stretched between them, but finally Castiel cracked a grin, just the corner of his mouth quirking up. “That was almost a poem,” he said. “Maybe I’m not the only with a rambling soul.”
Castiel opened his mouth to respond, but he was interrupted by the ring of Dean’s phone. He flipped it open and listened intently to the voice on the other end, his partner Castiel presumed. They exchanged a few words and Dean nodded before saying “Yeah, I’ll be there in ten.”
“Anything you need,” Dean assured him, an almost tender tone to his voice before he cleared his throat and the gruffness was back. “I’ll talk to you later.”
Pressing a hand to the glass, Castiel let out a breath. The silver reliquary was modest compared to some of the ornate gold and jeweled boxes or painted busts. Shaped like a cross and engraved with various religious symbols, it could fit in the palm of his hand. “Dean,” he said, “I found h—”
“Don’t you think I would have told you if I found out something more interesting than his alma mater?” Dean shot back. He ignored the tiny part of his brain that implied there was anything to be defensive about. He’d just gotten dinner and happened to run into some guy. Nothing special.
“Hester,” Castiel said, getting the attention of a blonde woman poring over some documents by a stone tablet. She looked up, and he asked, “Have you seen anyone come in here? We’re supposed to meet with some FBI agents.”
Castiel stared down at his feet, dreading the sound of the ambulance approaching. Somehow, he knew when it arrived, this would end. “So, Dean Winchester, what happens now?” he asked.
Acrid black smoke shoved its way down Castiel’s throat, filling every inch of space inside him until he felt pushed from his own body. Trapped inside his mind and unable to move, the presence controlled his limbs like a marionette, spoke using his voice. It laughed at his feeble attempts to break free from its hold, and Castiel let the panic consume him, screaming with no sound.
They settled up their tabs and took the elevator down to the third floor. Castiel stood by the buttons, looking up at the numbers ticking down, and Dean stood what felt like an appropriate distance away. But when Castiel glanced back, he tilted his head. “I’m not contagious or anything,” he said.
Dean’s stomach dropped, his mind immediately racing through all the possibilities of what could go south on a ghost hunt. “What’s wrong?” he asked, and he could hear the business wash over his tone.
Castiel watched as Dean took the sheet of paper and glanced it over, but it didn’t seem to mean much to him. He stood off to the side as Anna cleared off her desk and gathered her things; Cas was probably imagining things, but it felt like Dean was looking anywhere but in his direction. Before he could dwell too much on the thought, he turned back to his binder.
Dean pressed the towels to Cas’s stomach, careful not to jostle the knife. But he shook his head, allowing a hint of a laugh. “Wait ‘til you take on werewolves.”
Cas laid out on the bed, his arm under his head. “That’s the other thing. You told me before that being trapped in limbo so long is what drove Hamon to violence. If Alex’s father has only been dead a matter of days, isn’t it possible he doesn’t mean Alex any harm?”
“Yeah, hopefully that just means we can get to the bottom of this sooner. We’ll all be able to rest easier once they figure out who did this.”
It was funny how words worked. The way that one word held so many meanings, the line between them thin and fragile. The way it can change from one moment to the next.
Dean followed Dr. Novak through the museum hallways, keeping pace with the man’s brisk walk. With his white shirt sleeves rolled up to his forearms, tailored vest, and blue plaid tie, Dr. Novak had a professorial look to him that Dean did his best to not study too hard. Instead, he cast his gaze to the art that lined the walls, the glass cases full of history.
is what I’m talking about, Sammy,” he said, gesturing to the columned entrance, the marble fountain, and the valet standing by the double doors. “This is classy, we should stay in places like this more.”
Anna’s voice was strained. “He texted me this morning to say he was dropping out, but I haven’t heard from him since, and he won’t answer his phone. He’s the only one I haven’t been able to reach.”
“Shut up,” Dean told him, lacing their fingers together when Castiel’s grip started to slacken. “Once they patch you up, we can do a rendition of ‘Keep Yourself Alive.’”
The demon spoke with Castiel’s mouth, but it was so distinctly not Cas that Dean berated himself for not noticing sooner. “You’re here, aren’t you?” it mocked, bobbing its head. “He’s involved with
“You sure about that? ‘Cuz now you owe me twice,” Dean joked, swallowing back the lump in his throat. He didn’t mean it—the thought of holding this over Castiel’s head made him sick, especially since Cas wouldn’t have needed saving if it weren’t for him.
If Castiel thought he had a complicated relationship with faith before, he wasn’t sure that English had an appropriate word to describe the way he felt now. Like a trap door had opened in his soul, and everything he thought he knew fell through.
The question made Dean laugh, and Castiel couldn’t decide if that made him feel better or worse. “If they are, they ain’t talking to me,” Dean said.
As much of a Romantic as Castiel was at heart, he tried his best to keep himself from being carried away by his imagination. The wing of the museum where Jonah was killed was roped off to visitors, of course, but despite having clearance to pass that way, Castiel took the long way around to his office. He jumped through as many mental hoops as it took to prevent himself from thinking the word ‘haunted,’ but he would be lying to deny that there was some kind of miasma lingering in the halls.
“What’s crazy to me is that the spears that killed the first guy were props,” Sam was saying when Dean tuned back in. “That takes some serious force to get a plastic toy to skewer a guy.” His eyes darted back and forth like he was scanning the encyclopedia in his head.
“Stop talking, you idiot,” Dean hushed him. He switched out the towels, willing the paramedics to hurry their asses up.
lit up the screen, but Dean recognized the number at once, however hard he fought not to memorize it. “Cas?” he said, flipping it open after the first ring. “You okay?”
It was a fair enough observation, but Dean still pursed his lips at being read so plainly from the gate. “Alright, but an easy bet considering you know I spend most of life in motel rooms.” He chugged half the little bottle, making a show of it. “Me next. I assume…you’ve never been to a strip club.”
Sam shook his head, turning to read the roadside signs for something to eat other than Biggerson’s. “So, since when are you a TED Talk guy? Especially for one we have to drive halfway across the country for.”
“Looks like it was burned into their skin, yeah.” Sam squinched his brow. “I’ve been wracking my brain, but I don’t think I’ve seen this before.”
The Impala sputtered off, Dean pulling the keys from the ignition. “I’ll take the win,” he agreed. “Maybe we can grab a full night’s sleep for once.”
Out in the night, Dean took a few gulps of the fresh air. The lights of the city hardly allowed it to feel dark, but he drowned in the neon lights like it was an abyss. Sam was only a call away, but his hands wouldn’t pick up the phone. As terrified as he was of turning around, he knew that if he didn’t go back, Castiel would be one more regret to take the grave.
“Well, ‘speak’ is not really accurate, but I have studied it in a symbological context. Call it a hobby of mine.” He gestured behind him, and Dean looked up at the towering painting of an angel wielding a spear that hung behind his desk. He shrugged like Castiel understanding some niche, occult language made all the sense in the world.
Castiel heard Dean say something under his breath that sounded like “Ramble on…” but he didn’t quite catch it. “What was that?”
He checked his watch, scowling. It was a bit late to be traipsing out to the vineyard. Even though he’d taken the university gig closer to home, it was no paltry drive out to the countryside. Still, being nearer to his family, particularly his mother, had done wonders as he traversed this new Life After Winchesters. Having a wine business in the family didn’t hurt matters either.
That made Castiel’s smile widen, but it diminished as soon as the next song crashed in. Dean flinched too at the dynamic intro to “Crank That,” and the two of them shared a distasteful look. But then Cas leaned forward. “Hey, I’ve got some shooters in the mini fridge of my room. I can at least vouch for it being quieter than this.”
Once he got started, the rest of his story poured out, and Castiel sat dutifully quiet, listening intently. “I’ve always been close to my dad, but I don’t think he ever really accepted me. I came out after high school, and we had this huge fight. I didn’t talk to him for almost two years when I left for college. Then I went home over summer break this year, and I thought we were patching things up.” He swiped at his eyes again. “But we got into another argument right before the semester started, and I came back to school before we had a chance to smooth it over. He kept calling me and calling me, but I didn’t want to talk to him. Eventually he stopped calling, and I put it in the back of my mind. But not long after I got the word that he was dead, and now—” His voice gave out, and he buried his face in his hands.
“I’m not sure, but definitely something weird,” Sam said. He flipped open the folder and pulled out two photos, taken of each of the victims. Dean noticed the symbol immediately, but it wasn’t one he recognized either.
The look on Castiel’s face spurred him on; he was good enough to impress someone at least. They bounced through the next chorus together, the audience starting to clap along. For everything else that was surprising about Castiel, Dean half expected him to break out into masterful dance moves. But no, he was dorky and awkward, but he didn’t look like he knew any different, just inhabiting a world of his own as the music flowed through him.
“It’s…not that simple,” Dean said. He turned to look out the window over the dimming landscape. The hulking silhouette of a low mountain swallowed the sun, and the spindly pines cast long shadows along the grass.
the security footage that must show us all being thrown around like rag dolls. I don’t suppose the fake FBI has any plans about that?” The deadpan humor of the words contrasted the sincerity of the gesture, and that seemed to put Dean more at ease.
“Not off the top of my head, but…” He turned back to his computer and punched in a quick search. He scrolled through a few results, scanning the information quickly as a pit formed in his stomach. “It’s not historically certain,” he concluded, “but there are theories that he was attacked and impaled with spears.”
He turned back to Dean, twisting the crowbar in his hands. “Looks like we’re gonna have to make some decisions, fast.”
“Leave him alone; he’s got nothing to do with this,” Dean said slowly, a hand held out like he was trying to calm a wild animal. His mind raced for options: exorcism, holy water, salt. Time consuming, painful, not enough.
It’s crossed my mind that you might find these emails annoying, pathetic even. Perhaps they do highlight my loneliness a little more than I’d like to admit, but I confess that it’s cathartic to write these to you. It’s like keeping a journal, or writing a newspaper column for an audience of one.
“Cousins…?” he wondered. He had quite a few, but who would have told them about his accident this fast? And they all lived in places far from Salt Lake City at least.
They sat down with the finished casserole, and Castiel was warmed through by the smell of the garlic and creamy egg noodles. The old favorite recipe kept the emptiness of the house at bay, and he shoveled it down, filling his bowl with seconds.
“Not if we can help it. Do you have their numbers? It would be best for them all to avoid the museum for a while,” Sam said.
Do you and Sam take time out of your busy schedules to do normal people things? Go the movies? Shop at the mall? Visit museums that aren’t haunted? I walked through an art gallery last weekend, and I spent hours there just losing myself in that world again. I remember looking at this painting called “Mind In Motion,” which was a simple white canvas with a winding blue line. For some reason, all I could hear was your voice in my head saying “It just looks like the guy sneezed right before he started to paint and then called it a day.” It made me laugh trying to picture you doing things like that for fun. But I hope you’re finding time to do something that makes you laugh too.
Cas turned back around in his seat, and the look on Dean’s face was full of trouble. “Oh no,” Cas protested, hunching down in his seat like Dean was going to physically drag him up there. “Absolutely not.”
They excused themselves, leaving Castiel alone in the office. This job was supposed to be boring, he thought, pressing his palms to his eyes. Boring and safe. Fending off some psycho religious serial killer was not in the career trajectory.
True to form, Rocky’s Diner lit up the street corner despite the late hour, shining like a beacon for weary, lost souls looking for a respite. The curling, red neon script flickered every now and again, and reflecting off the dinged stainless-steel paneling. It had the unfortunate aura of being a place one was likely to be murdered behind, but Castiel kept the observation to himself.
“I, uh, just felt like I owed you an apology,” Dean told him. He sighed. “You gotta know that my life is all kinds of messed up, and I don’t want you to think that you did something wrong. It’s just…I don’t—I can’t let people get close.”
Castiel searched Dean’s face for any sign of facetiousness, waiting for the punchline. He realized all at once that Dean was serious. He ducked his head with a laugh. “You know, I think there’s a certain allure to never knowing for sure.”
“Be careful yourself, wherever you are.” He listened to the sound of Cas’s breathing for a second before the phone beeped and the call ended.
Dr. Novak kept his eyes forward but gave a curt nod. “Dr. Milton and I are headlining it together. I’m sure you can understand why it’s especially important to us to have this case solved.”
“I’ve tried just about every conceivable food you can chuck in a deep fat fryer, and I haven’t met one I didn’t like. So try me.”
“You know what they say, variety is the spice of life. But I get the feeling this isn’t the reason you called either.”
Dean spotted a diner on the corner and swerved into the parking lot, shutting off the radio with a shaky breath. The powerful aroma of greasy fried food wafted through the open window, setting his stomach to rumble. Grateful for the distraction, he honed in on the feeling, shutting out thoughts of anything but the bacon cheeseburger he was hoping to find inside.
Shifting in his seat, he squeezed her free hand. “I promise I came back for more than boy advice,” he said. “I know it’s been too long since I’ve come to visit.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said with an amused squint. “And you, agent? Anyone at home waiting for you to come back with another successful case?” He asked mostly out of polite courtesy, but he was surprised at how relieved he was when Dean answered in the negative.
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel said, dropping his shoulders like that was the saddest thing he’d ever heard. “You’re lucky the Queen song I picked was ‘Another One Bites the Dust’ and not ‘I’m in Love With My Car.’”
But he took a deep breath, reminding himself that folding under pressure wasn’t in his nature. Fear is a catalyst, a weapon as much as it is a shield. Wield it, and carve a path to greatness.
And there he was. Dean took the empty seat to his right and propped his elbows on the bartop and ordered a whiskey. Cas asked the bartender if she could bring that second drink after all.
“There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man, and bring him to the ground,” they sang, and Dean strutted his way to the opposite side of the stage, Castiel taking the cue and passing him in the middle. They played off each other like they’d rehearsed it, jaunty and as slick as two idiots could make it, and the end of the song came all too soon.
Sam ran a hand through his shaggy hair, and even if he couldn’t relate to this specific feeling, Dean knew Sam had his own history with their father that was just as riddled with trauma. Some days he didn’t understand why either of them still looked up to him, idolized him even.
“Of all the gin joints in all the towns…” a voice behind him said, trailing off as the speaker came into view. Castiel looked up to find the FBI man from earlier, dressed down in a sturdy leather jacket over flannel and jeans.
“I wanted to apologize for how I was acting at the museum at first. It was callous and uncharacteristic of me,” he said.
“You’re looking at it,” Castiel said. “This was part of an attempt to ‘reach a new audience,’ with interactive exhibits. Both Jonah and Ezekiel were actors; they were part of the reenactment of Holy Week.”
“We spend so much time on the road; it’s not really in the cards for me.” He folded his arms on the counter, dropping his eyes.
This time Cas was quiet, staring at Dean with a growing pressure on his heart. He had the feeling Dean could tell his eyes were on him, but he refused to look up. It was clear that Sam was uncomfortable with the tension in the air, and after a moment it got the better of him. “I’m gonna wait in the hallway.” He clapped Dean on the shoulder and stepped out of the room.
They shut their office door behind them, stepping out into the hallway and making their way down to the conservation laboratory where all of the artifacts and artwork still being cataloged and prepped for exhibition were being held. Half a dozen other curators and staff milled around the room, intent on one task or another, but Castiel didn’t see any unfamiliar faces yet.
Rubbing his forehead, Castiel dodged the question for the time being. “Just wanted to call and check in. Needed a break from lesson planning.”
“You can figure this out, Cas,” he said instead, rubbing his forehead. It sounded more dismissive than encouraging, and he cursed at himself. “Just…be careful, man.”
Castiel followed the rules, but he flung the empty bottle at Dean. “This one’s a bit out on a limb, but I’m going to assume that despite your whole…badassery vibe, you don’t have any tattoos.”
Taking in shuddering breaths, Alex looked up at Castiel with fear in his eyes. “It’s not—there’s something else,” he said. “I feel like I’m going crazy, and I know it’s probably just the stress of trying to process everything, but I keep seeing him.”
“Absentee father,” Castiel told him, a little shocked at how easily the admission came. “But I love my mother, and she’s always done right by me. Which wasn’t always easy since I’m one of five.”
The obvious choice was to return home, and he knew he would have to eventually—everything he owned that wasn’t in his suitcase still sat in his place there. But without the museum job, it didn’t feel like home anymore. He winced at the thought of the phrase ‘ghosts of his past.’
Cas, it seemed, had turned into quite the Sherlock Holmes, his emails recounting his work on the case with Alex reading like a serial. What the police had ruled a suicide, Castiel surmised to be coercion. He dug up information on the father’s job, part of their family-owned business. He collected old gossip about the souring of the relationship between Alex’s father and his siblings. He pieced together news reports and rumors of his death, comparing it to stories he had coaxed out of the family. While it may not have been enough admissible evidence to bring the matter to court, Castiel appeared to have drawn his own conclusions. But what stuck with Dean the most was that he’d done all of it on his own--without fake badges, called in connections, or an arsenal of weaponry. With just his wit, resourcefulness, and a healthy dose of charisma, Castiel had taken an open and shut case and at least given everyone a reason to second guess.
Even with his face buried in his hands, Castiel couldn’t fight the smile blooming on his face. “I love you, mom,” he finally said.
Guilt gripped his insides. Cas must feel like he did something wrong, or worse, that Dean couldn’t tolerate part of who he was. Dean could still feel the ash inside of him, what the fire left behind. Castiel hadn’t let anything or anyone smother his heart like that. Dean envied that about him, but he left Cas with little other choice than to assume that Dean was just one more person to put him out.
The end of the hallway was fast approaching and Castiel whispered a prayer just in case there was a god listening. Only four displays left. Three. Two. Then—
“First, I’ve yet to meet the person who can successfully talk you out of anything that you set your mind to. Second, from what you’ve told me, it sounds like this boy could use someone in his corner. Brothers are one thing, but they aren’t everything.”
Given that he didn’t even recall having surgery, he supposed that was the best way to break the news. “How long was I asleep?” he asked.
“Fine, fine. Let’s just get on the road. It’s less than two hundred miles from here; we can make it by dinner time.”
“Well, surely you have some experience if you qualify as a special agent for the FBI,” Castiel said.
“Alright, fine.” Sam held up his hands. “I’m gonna go see if I take a look at the reliquaries while they get those lists.”
He held the words on his tongue, felt the static in the air between them, and let the suggestion die on his lips.
After thirty minutes, he started to lose hope, stirring a straw around the dregs of his drink but declining the bartender’s offer of another. Technically speaking, Dean didn’t actually commit to coming—they were probably busy after all. Castiel tried to ignore the terrifying implication that demons were another real threat to consider; he was still working on ghosts. Either way, Dean likely had better things to do than waste his evening in a gaudy hotel lounge with a guy he met once.
“Of course, Castiel, idiot,” he chided himself, scrambling to his feet. He jogged down the hallway, eyes scanning the plaques and signs posted near each display. He found Isidore first, reading the information as quickly as he could. “St. Isidore the Laborer, a Spanish farmworker…” A humble working-class man—not someone who could or would wear golden threaded silks.
“I assume…that given the opportunity, you would make a damn good hunter,” Dean said. He propped his arm up on the back of the couch, making a face that said ‘prove me wrong.’
“Alright,” Dean said with a bob of his head. “Anyone shows up, we’ll have eyes on ‘em, no worries.” As if to demonstrate his point, Dean adjusted his chair so he had a better view of the window.
“I only have three, you ass,” Castiel insisted as red flashing lights turned the corner and Dean started to stand up.
Looking him over, Castiel waited for the sarcastic comment to follow, but Dean just drank to finish his turn. Castiel had a burning question on his mind, but he had the feeling that if he asked it, or rather assumed it, out loud, it might break whatever they had going.
“Alright, everyone,” the woman said, “it’s Karaoke Thursday! We’ll get started here in about five minutes once we get the monitor hooked up. If you’re interested, come talk to me and we’ll get you in the lineup!” She clicked off the microphone and tucked it under her arm, stepping off stage to direct the men setting up the equipment.
Absently, Castiel thought about Dean acting in the stead of a guardian angel. The idea almost made him laugh, but he pushed it down and returned to his work. Flipping through his notes, it felt like he had all the pieces, he just had to fit them together in order to understand the picture they were creating.
“Give me some time, but I’ll get it to you as soon as I can.” He turned to go, meeting Dean’s eyes first and giving him a nod. “Dean.”
Castiel laughed. “True to my word, I tried to let things go like you said, but comments like that make me morbidly curious about all the things I must be missing.”
His feet moved before his mind decided to ignore the command. Taking a deep, steeling breath, he turned the handle and stepped out into the dim hallway.
“I’ve already given my statement to the police. You’ll hear about it in the papers tomorrow anyway, I’m sure—you might as well hear it from me first.”
“I’m feeling pretty confident in my twenty bucks, but there’s all kinds of old shit in there. How are we gonna figure out which old shit has a bone to pick with actors?”
As if on cue, the side doors to the museum crashed open as the EMTs guided a stretcher covered in a white sheet toward the waiting ambulance. They watched them load it in and shut the doors with an alarming finality. Castiel kept his arm around Anna’s shoulders, and she sniffled, wiping her eyes.
Castiel set the icepack down, hugging his arms around himself. “If ghosts are real, does that mean angels are real too?”
Shards of glass crunched under Sam’s shoes as sidled over and fished the silver cross out of the case, fiddling with the closure.
The woman looked up, eyes searching the fray until she noticed him waving. She wobbled to her feet, and Castiel took the acknowledging grunt from the officer as permission to slink through the barrier. He ran forward to meet her, and she collapsed into his arms.
The ghost’s face distorted, its mouth yawning open as its neck snapped sideways. Dean felt a hand clutch the front of his jacket, and he looked over to find Cas stricken, frozen in place as he beheld the ghost bearing down on Sam.
Dean ran his tongue over his teeth, staring down into his lap. “I knew Cas was going to be here,” he managed, the next part sticking in his throat, but he pushed on. “And I wanted to see him.”
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t think so, but Anna was pretty shaken up. And other than the fact that neither murder was caught on the security feeds, the police seem to think it’s some kind of serial killer based on the nature of the deaths.”
“Mind if we ask you a couple of questions? I’m sure you’ve spoken with the police already, but we’d like to follow up on a few things,” the shorter one said. His bright green eyes swept over Anna, and Castiel instinctively took a step closer to her.
As Castiel watched him go, he wondered how it was that every time Dean walked out the door, it felt like the final time.
“Two grisly deaths at a museum. No suspects, no alarms tripped, no leads.” Dean slapped the newspaper down on the table, keeping his eyes on his brother to watch his reaction.
They found seats at the counter and ordered a large platter of the locally famous curds to share, and Anna stared down into her glass of water like she was trying to drown her thoughts in it. Castiel struggled to find something to say, but he was spared any further agonizing when she finally spoke, soft as a whisper: “Do you think we’re cursed?”
Dean let the word knock around in his head freely instead of stamping it down. This was how he began to clear the ash and finally let things grow again. One email at a time.
“That’s what I’m here for,” Cas told him, standing up too. “You’ll let me know if you need anything.” He said it as a statement, waiting until Alex nodded before waving goodbye to send him off.
The guard nodded, moving aside for them. Castiel flipped through his keys for the orange capped one, unlocking the double doors just long enough for them to slip inside. The lights were off in this section of the building, but enough sunlight streamed in through the high windows that it was easy to see. Still, that eerie feeling permeated the air, and Castiel resisted the urge to shiver in front of the agent.
The waiter delivered Dean’s food, and the look on his face reminded Castiel of a kid on Christmas. Castiel watched, fascinated, as approached the appetizer like a science experiment: each variety of cheese curd on its own as a control, then systematically tasting and combining each sauce.
“I’m thinking about it,” Cas replied, his voice weak. He blinked back the tears forming, feeling stupid for them.
“I work here,” he told them, flashing his badge as he spotted a crown of red hair through the uniforms. “Please, that’s my friend.”
Cas narrowed his eyes. “Don’t tell me…” But he held up a finger. “No, wait, that reminds me of a game we can play with these.”
“Just give me a moment to grab my keys,” Castiel said, nudging Anna back in the direction of the office. She gave him a sidelong glance but followed his lead, looking back over her shoulder at the agents who had already been distracted by the various accoutrements laid out on the tables.
“What? Why? What’s going—” Castiel cut himself off as Dean gave him one more imploring look and let his hand slip down off his arm before turning on his heel and following after Sam.
The hotel bar was lit like a nightclub lounge, the walls cast in vibrant blue hues, and the bar lit up from underneath in gold. Instead of blaring music though, ambient soft rock played over the speakers. Castiel scanned the tables and rich leather armchairs for any sign of the Winchesters, but most were occupied by larger groups, probably more conference attendees. When he didn’t spot them at the bar either, he claimed a stool for himself and ordered something fruity while he waited.
Alex kept fidgeting, now chewing on his nails. Castiel let him sit in silence as long as he wanted, letting him come around to the question when he was ready. “What…” He took a deep breath. “What do you believe happens to people after they die?”
As his plane landed in Delaware, Castiel watched the scenery below him come into focus, recognizing landmarks he hadn’t seen in years. The nostalgia hit him harder than he expected it to, and he tried to think of a good reason why he hadn’t been back in so long.
If his one sentence reply was dipping his toe in the water, this time he decided to try the whole foot. Maybe nothing would ever come of it, but Bobby was right in a way. Even if he couldn’t bring himself to seeing Cas again, this was the next best thing. At least they were talking. One day, eventually, his emails would just stop, and Cas would be left wondering what happened to him. But that had to be better than letting him get close only to be forced to witness the rollercoaster hurtling toward hellfire that was the remainder of Dean’s life.
“Wha…?” Castiel attempted, but he was still dizzy from the impact. But he forgot all about Sam when the hem of a white robe flickered into his line of sight.
Castiel held his hand out, and Sam gave him the picture to study closer. “If you give me some more time, I think I could parse it out. I have some of my notes here.”
complicate things, but I think that made it worse? Although, in our line of work, I guess that’s not that surprising. How many people can say ‘the spirit of my dead father helped me and my resurrected brother kill the demon who burned my mother alive.’”
“I’m your big brother. It’s my job to protect you, always has been. If I can’t save you, what does anything else matter?”
“I just don’t understand what could be so terrible that he left you alone at the hospital after you were attacked,” his mother said, looping back to their conversation about Dean.
When they drove up the winding dirt road leading to the house, the sight of the surrounding vineyards made Castiel’s heart ache. His mother parked the car next to an old pickup and helped him haul his suitcase out of the trunk. “Just like you remember?” she asked, noticing him gazing out over the fields.
“I guess you’ll just have to trust me,” Castiel told him. He tipped his own glass back, then ran the straw along his tongue. “Wait here.”
“I don’t mean to sound sour, Cassie,” Elizabeth said. “I’m proud of you, and I’m so happy you decided to stay in town longer. But…well, you know I’ve had enough sermons to last me a lifetime.”
“Damn it,” he said aloud, the adrenaline starting to flood his veins. He shook out his hands, rolling his neck. “No risk, no reward.” He took off to the left.
Cas sniffed. “Good to know it was more of a professional courtesy and not out of any genuine worry for my well-being.”
“I just got a call from security,” she said. “There’re a couple of FBI agents at the front desk wanting to talk to us.”
“Why apostles though?” Sam wondered. “That’s what I’m stuck on—these are purposeful killings, not just random acts of violence.” He set a hand on his hip, the other stroking his chin. “We just need more time. Hopefully Dr. Novak keeping the actors out will buy us enough.”
Castiel guided him to take a seat in one of the desks at the front row, sitting himself in an adjacent chair. “You’ll have all the time you need to get your projects in—that should be the last thing on your mind. You’re an exceptional student, Alex, but just recognize that if you push yourself too hard, you’re only going to make it worse for yourself in the end. It’s okay to take time to grieve.”
If I were a smarter man, I would probably burn all my bridges, change my name, and move to a different country. Needless to say, I got a little carried away with the self-medication, and frankly I’ve never been more embarrassed in my life. All I can do is apologize and hope you don’t judge me too harshly.
“Thanks,” Alex said weakly, taking the paper and slipping it in the front cover of his book. He stood up, but he didn’t move anywhere, looking like he was deciding on whether or not to say something. “Dr. Novak, can I ask you something kind of personal?”
Feeling the beginnings of a blush, Castiel put a hand up under his chin and turned back to his notebook. He cursed himself for acting like a school boy. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”
“Why do you say that like my masculinity is in question?” Cas asked, dutifully taking his shot, but he stuck his tongue out at the taste.
He startled when balled up foil hit him in the face, and he looked up to find Sam staring at him with one eyebrow raised. Dean fished the wrapper off the floor and threw it back. “What?”
He looked over to where Sam was sitting with Conrad several yards away. Conrad had taken a heavier beating, tossed around and battered, but he would be alright too. The memories of the night would scar far worse than any physical injury.
He considered bringing up what happened in his latest email to Dean, but he thought about what Dean had said about his own father, and Cas decided to keep it to himself. Dean had become a regular chatterbox, and he hated to say something that might cause him to clam up again. The latest message from him included a raunchy anecdote of a sexual encounter gone wrong when Dean was eighteen, and it gave Cas the laugh he needed to shed the gray thoughts.
The unexpected insight of the question hit Dean a little too close to home, and all he could do was laugh. He looked Dr. Novak up and down, re-evaluating his first impression. He supposed it was no surprise that someone with at least three degrees was intelligent, but the rawness of the question spoke to something deeper. “You can call me Dean,” he said at last, avoiding the question altogether.
The silhouette whirled around as the double doors behind him slammed shut. Dean heard Sam saying “No, no, no,” as he brought up the rear. The four of them convened at the doors, Sam elbowing through to rattle the bar to no effect.
The demon lifted its hand, revealing a kitchen knife that it spun with a deft flourish. “Oh, believe me—there are plenty of little hellions that would love to make you punch your ticket early.” It dragged Castiel’s fingers over the edge of the blade, drawing blood. “Me, however? I’m content to let you drag this out to the last possible second. Maybe I’m just a sucker for suspense.” It shrugged, taking a few lazy steps out of the kitchen area. “I just don’t think you should have to wait until your deal’s up to get a taste of the destination. Let’s call it a free trial offer.”
“I am not nearly intoxicated enough to make a fool of myself like that—” Castiel stopped talking as Dean fished out some cash and slapped it on the bar.
as I can watch before I pass out. Have you ever seen it? There’s nothing spooky about him, but I wonder if Dexter would make it on your radar. I bet you could take him down.
“Only if you leave,” Cas finished for him. The words fell on him like rain. “You didn’t come to check on me, you came to say goodbye.”
“What kind of homework do they have you doing?” Anna asked as Castiel sat down at his desk and pulled out a thick, tabbed binder. She swiveled back and forth in her chair while the printer chugged out its command.
The wheezing of the printer interrupted their quiet symphony, and Castiel rolled over to fetch the contents, several pages long. When he stood to staple them together, Dean hastily clicked out of the tab and turned his attention over to the documents as Castiel set them on the desk before him.
He averted his eyes when Castiel looked back with a grimace as the first pair up at the mics began a rendition of “Snap Yo Fingers.” Cas leaned over so he could talk over the music. “Don’t worry, I picked something classier than this. Something more in line with your interests.”
Before he could stop himself, Castiel reached out and wrapped his hand around Dean’s wrist. Dean didn’t pull away, but the touch put him on edge; Castiel could feel how taut his body was, on the edge of flight. “I know you won’t listen if I ask you to stay,” he said, “but just…don’t close the door when you leave, okay?” He squeezed gently, hoping that Dean understood.
The absurdity of it made Castiel laugh, which was clearly not the reaction Dean had been expecting. “What? Don’t got a thing for red heads?” Dean continued, with a short laugh of his own like he was feeling left out of the joke.
“Ah, I see, you were trying to be clever.” Castiel turned back to his article, but he could see Dean in his peripheries, and it was clear that he was not used to his lines falling flat. It was actually almost endearing in a way, seeing the little stab of hurt on his face. He almost felt bad.
He might not have guessed it without Dean saying so, but as he looked over at Sam, it made sense. Maybe they didn’t look exactly alike, but he could see the family resemblance in the way they carried themselves. Both of them shouldered this enormous weight with a staggering dignity even if it was rough around the edges. Castiel had only learned the big secret less than an hour ago, and he could feel it threatening to tear him apart. Who knew how long Dean had held that secret like a sickness inside of him?
“Maybe?” Sam said. “I guess I remember you being gone, but obviously I wasn’t there if you went off by yourself.”
For a moment, it looked like Castiel wanted to argue, but he just nodded as they loaded him onto a stretcher. Dean moved out of the way, watching him go. He’d made his promises, but he saw them wound into a cord connecting them both—the farther he let Castiel get, the tighter the cord stretched. Too far, and it would snap.
“I need you to figure out who he is,” Dean continued, pointing back toward the gallery. “There’s not time to explain, you just gotta pull through for me. Can you do that?”
“What do you want from me?” Dean growled. “I’ve already bought what you’re selling—you’ll get my soul when the time comes.”
It took them another two days to reach Salt Lake City, and they stopped by Bobby’s place to check in on their way. With the Colt still a work in progress, Bobby kept pretty holed up, but he made sure to let them know he was only ever a phone call away.
“I think…I think I prefer ghosts to demons,” Castiel said, even managing the tiniest glimmer of a smile.
“What happened with the surveillance?” Dean traced his fingers along the wall, drawing a line from hole to hole in the shape of the cross. When he pulled away, he rubbed his fingers together then brushed them off on his pants.
“Tell me a little about the exhibit?” Dean asked, squinting through the dim light at all the pieces already on display. “I read it’s called Footsteps of Faith?”
Cas was struggling to breathe, his chest rising and falling with short, anxious breaths. Dropping to his knees again, Dean made him look into his eyes. “I’m gonna apply pressure to the wound, okay? It’s gonna hurt like a son of a bitch, but it’s better than dying.”
“Well, it’s the Bible, darling, I think you’ll manage to scrape together enough content. God knows modern Christians continue finding things to pick over. Literally, I’m sure He knows,” she said in a bitter tone Castiel knew well.
“Dr. Milton is getting us a list of all the actors you’re employing; until we can look at that, do you mind getting us a copy of all the names of people whose remains are on display as part of the new exhibit?” Sam asked. Dean had to give him credit for no-bullshit way he framed questions like that. Again, the badge gave them a lot of leeway, but sometimes they had to ask some insane favors.
“I don’t think I’m going to the be the last one you hear from about this,” he was saying as Sam and Dean approached. “I’m sorry, Anna.” He looked up as they arrived but cast his eyes back down and hurried out of the room.
When he realized he actually sent the garbled mess of drunken babbling that morning, he was ready to disappear into the ether. It took every ounce of willpower to send the follow up without pulverizing the whole computer before or after. And now he had Dean’s reply to process too? The great unending beyond looked more and more appealing by the minute.
“Oh, come on, gay or not, that’s like a rite of passage! Not even right when you turned eighteen just because you could?”
buy it, I guess I just don’t see how all the pieces fit yet. Sure, ghosts are crazy bastards sometimes, but—”
“Life is all about risk, Sammy. It’ll be fun.” Dean snatched his jacket off the back of the chair, throwing what few belongings he had scattered around the hotel room into his bag.
“Let’s just say Anna and I are incompatible on a much deeper level than that,” Castiel said. But he watched the puzzlement run rampant in Dean’s expression, so he took pity on him and clarified: “I’m—I’m gay.”
“Of course,” she told him. “We’ll take it slow, but I’ll have something brought up for you. And if you feel well enough, I’m sure your cousins are anxious to see you.”
Rubbing his hands together, Dean seemed to think on it for a moment, finally looking up at Cas with something like an apology in his eyes. “Man, as grateful as I am for your help back there, I would give anything not to have you know what you know now.”
“We’ll see about that.” He caught her up on the response-less email string, the drunk message, and Dean’s brief but timely response. “So? Better or worse than bees?”
“I’m not judging you for doing what needs to be done, but that just feels so disrespectful,” Cas said. “I don’t know if I can bring myself to that. There has to be another way.”
Castiel did his best to look mad, but he was far from successful. “You might as well keep drinking, because I assume you’re the type of guy who refers to his car as a ‘she.’”
“A lot. I know.” He stood up from his desk and walked around to take her hand. “If security sent them back already, they should be getting close.”
Castiel expelled a breath of tense air. “I know, I’m sorry. I guess I’m a little more worked up about all this than I thought. Which is ridiculous considering what you’ve been through; I should be—”
There was another creak as Sam settled back into the bench, irritated that they were going in circles. “Right now we still have time on our side; we should use it.”
The nurse finished up her duties in the room and closed the door behind her, leaving Castiel bewildered. On top of the pain in his abdomen, his head was fuzzy, his limbs like lead. He didn’t imagine that the doctors could diagnose post-traumatic demon possession symptoms, but it seemed likely there would be some kind of negative physical response to having a hellish entity forcefully manipulate your body.
The concierge spared him a confused glance as he powered back into the hotel, slamming the call button again. He willed it to come quicker, losing his nerve with every tick of the lobby clock. When it finally opened, he pushed himself to step inside, clenching and unclenching his hands. The red numbers on the screen dialed up with agonizing slowness. “Come on…”
“I—I hear you,” he replied weakly. He still had the list Dean had shoved him clenched in his hand, and he unfolded it, shaking. The words swam in front of him, but he tried breathing deep and purposeful until they settled back into place.
Agent May drew his lips into a line, reading back over the sheet. “Dr. Novak, do you know how Thomas died? I have a bad feeling I can make a guess.”
They barreled down the interstate toward the museum, and Sam unrolled the newspaper again, reading the article more in depth. “This is one pissed off ghost, if that’s what we’re dealing with,” he said. “It says the second vic was ‘pinned upside down to the wall by his wrists and feet.’”
Shutting the phone and letting it clatter on the table, Dean held his head in his hands. He couldn’t tell anymore what was the truer of his motivations. Was he keeping Cas away, or keeping away from Cas? Did it matter?
“I mean, the police aren’t getting anywhere,” Anna said, shrugging one shoulder. “I guess I just feel a little intimidated. And having to relive that night again…” She rubbed her eyes.
“He does, but I don’t push him,” she said, swirling her wine. “Ever since he got married, he’s kept to himself.” She shook her head, putting a smile back on and laying a hand on his arm. “But you’re here, my love, and I’m so happy to have you. Why don’t you tell me a little more about this fella of yours that’s such a mystery?”
The slim hope that Dean would come riding onto the scene to save the day sputtered out, made worse by the fact that he was so close and yet too far. “No, that’s—do what you need to do, I just need some advice.”
Dean set the coffee on his desk along with a granola bar. “You know, once you finish that list, you don’t have to stick around. Sam and I, we can handle this.”
But Sam let it slide off, just nodding slowly. “Have you always—I mean, did you ever…you know, before Cas?”
The slip of paper with Dean’s information on it was tucked in the pocket of his coat, and he fished around for it, just to feel that it was there. Not knowing where to go next hardly qualified as an emergency, and despite the urge to dial the number, he didn’t think he could do it.
Castiel sat at his desk with his head in his hands, staring without blinking at the one line email that had popped up in his inbox. Months of no contact, no replies, no acknowledgement, and then this? “Son of a bitch,” he whispered. Still dealing with a dull, throbbing headache after drinking too much—and saying too much, apparently—Castiel snapped the laptop shut.
This wing of the building with all the labs and storage had a distinctly industrial atmosphere, and he and Anna had done their best to counteract that, making the office feel as much like home as they could. Of course, they had their diplomas and awards featured over their desks, but they also hung replicas of some of their favorite pieces: Castiel’s soft, sweeping landscapes and billowing robed angels, and Anna’s bright abstracts and muted Impressionists. Each of them displayed pictures of their family, and Castiel tended to a host of plants on his side of the office. They draped table runners over the sideboards, spruced the shelves with statuettes and little framed sayings or jokes they’d printed out, and stuck kitschy magnets all over the side of the filing cabinets.
The end of October rolled around, and Sam came to him with a case in Maple Springs, New York. Things with Sam were tense lately now that they’d fixed the Colt. Bobby did his best not to take sides, and he knew better than to jump the gun without a fully idealized plan, but Dean knew that he was working with Sam to try and find a way to terminate the contract. Messing around with the deal and losing Sam again as a result terrified Dean, so he did what he did best and put up a wall. Sam did everything in his power to tear it down, but Dean was too practiced to let it go that easily. Instead, they set off to New York with the mood between them prickly and ready to blow.
“Shh, just let me imagine for a minute.” Dean closed his eyes and took a breath, then shook it out. “Alright, I’m over it.”
As much as he loved reading Cas’s poetic musings and daily commentary, the drunk email at two in the morning was by far his favorite. Something about it was pure in its unfiltered glory, typos and all. He’d be lying though if he said part of it wasn’t the validation that Cas wanted him over some other guy. Because he couldn’t deny to himself the flare of jealousy when he read about the dates they went on. Then to hear that Cas was relieved they broke up because he wished he could have Dean? Dean’s masculinity flinched at the term ‘butterflies’ but there was no other way to describe it.
Once they were out of earshot, Sam fell back into step beside Dean. “It’s not that big of a deal to go change,” he said.
Castiel smiled, not backing down. “See, here’s the rules. We take turns making assumptions about each other. If we make a statement that’s true, the other person drinks; if we make an assumption that’s wrong, then we drink. Make sense?”
When they reached the arched entrance to the hall, Dean grabbed two handfuls of Castiel’s collar and shook him until he had his attention. “Listen to me, we need your help.”
Alex wouldn’t look him in the eye, staring at the floor and visibly fighting back tears. The muscles in his forearms tensed as he clutched his book tighter. “I can’t afford to fall behind,” he said in a small voice.
“If you saw the look on his face, you would know why I was afraid to ask,” he said. “He must have his reasons, and I trust that they’re good ones, but…”
“I don’t know, but this whole business has me freaking out. I just know I won’t be able to calm down until I know he’s safe.”
He flushed, but he handed her the bowl, not about to argue. He gathered his bags and hauled them up the stairs to the guest bedroom, setting the suitcase aside to tackle tomorrow. From his carry on, he took out his laptop and set it on the bed. Dean’s slip of paper was right where he left it, and he situated himself against the headboard with it clutched in his hand.
“I ran into him last night when I was looking for grub, and we got to talking for a little while.” Dean shrugged.
Dean ran his hands through his hair, droplets of water misting the air. He collapsed in his bed, tucking one arm under his head. Eleven years ago, and he could still hear the ringing in his ears when Dad gave him the case. First time out on his own—it should have been a reward if it didn’t feel so much like a punishment, a warning.
“Those sound like magic words,” Dean said, rubbing his hands together. He pushed the menu away and put in his order with the waiter. Castiel got the distinct impression Dean wasn’t going to let them sit in comfortable silence.
Both of the others looked over to him, and Agent May appeared spurred by the validation. Dean looked back and forth between the two of them before asking: “Upside down? Why? Isn’t the upside-down cross sort of…Satan-y?”
“That’s the thing—I don’t know. He’s…a mystery,” Castiel said, propping his chin in his hands as he watched the trees whiz by.
Castiel finally took Dean’s advice and stopped talking, working on regulating his breathing as they waited in tense silence for the ambulance. Dean jumped when the hotel door crashed open and the paramedics rushed in. He made sure they knew about the woman in the bathroom, but then he squeezed Cas’s hand one more time. “I gotta find Sam,” he told him. “We’ll meet you at the hospital.”
Hester raised her eyebrows, but she shook her head. “No, just the usual team this morning. The FBI is getting involved? That’s—”
He’d hoped it might be easier when he finally reached the door, like some sort of clarity would take hold and the path ahead would be lined with yellow bricks. Instead, he felt like he was going to throw up. Shuffling his feet, he steeled his nerves, closing his eyes with one final breath.
Alex nodded. “And even though it has to be something wrong with me, it feels so real. Like I can feel his presence in the room, or I’ll think things moved on their own. And when he appears, it’s like he’s trying to tell me something, but then he’s gone again.”
“And miss out on that roadside charm?” Sam quipped. He took off his jacket and draped it over the back of the chair in the dinette.
Anna silenced him with a hand on his forearm, then folded him into a quick hug. “Go on your tour; I can handle Twenty Questions with the May pole.”
Dean noticed Castiel slowly ease out of his chair, his instinct to help battling his apprehension. Dean had seen enough dead bodies, burned enough corpses, and decapitated enough monsters that it barely phased him anymore. Sometimes it was easy to forget that most people still recoiled at the prospect of death, and it of course was especially difficult if it was someone they knew.
They were interrupted by a knock on the door, and after a second, Dean poked his head in. “Hey, just wondering if there’s a place my partner and I can set up shop.”
“You fucking teenager,” he muttered. The elevator descended to the ground floor, his stomach sinking with it. Had he stayed, he wouldn’t be toeing the line anymore. Flirtation for flirtation’s sake was one thing. That he was good at--it was familiar, even if Cas was different. But the minute he started to let it feel real, he lit the dynamite. This was supposed to be where he didn’t have to feel like a time bomb. Just when he was starting to feel claustrophobic, the doors opened and stepped out into the lobby, making a beeline for the doors.
“I appreciate it, ma’am,” he said, holding his smile as he walked away, leaving Sam to follow after.
They talked about everyday things, and it was funny how different it was for each of them. Cas complained about grading papers, unruly students, problems with his landlord and nosy neighbor; Dean bitched about bruising from being thrown around on a case, dealing with witchy bodily fluids, and the trouble they had tracing demonic omens. As much as Dean loved Sam, would trust him with his life, it was refreshing having someone else to vent to. Cas even leant his expertise on a case or two, which gave Dean a strange sense of pride. Of everything they told each other, Dean still kept his deal a secret. There never seemed a right time or place to bring it up, and he didn’t think he could bear to put that on Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean leaned into it, clasping his hands behind his back and casting a cursory glance at the clock on the wall, “we’re looking for the ballroom. I believe the panel we’re interested in begins in about half an hour.” He smiled.
Dean let the fiendish little thoughts chase each other in circles in his head for a minute before he muttered “fuck it” under his breath. He typed
As Dean pulled into the motel parking lot, Sam looked at his watch. “It’s not even ten,” he said. “Aside from the mad dash there at the end, we pulled that one out pretty quick.”
“Oh, for god’s sake,” he cursed at himself, dropping his arms to his sides. He forced himself to walk away, to be content with whatever combination of indecision he ended up with. Grabbing his wallet and room key, he shut his door behind him and took the elevator up to the roof level.
“You’d think that would be good for your business,” Castiel joked. He knelt down at the mini fridge and loaded up with as many shooters as he could fit in his palms. He dumped them all on the coffee table, and he and Dean both set to standing them back up.
He slid to a stop not far from Cas, grimacing from the impact on the hard marble. Castiel ran over to him, falling to his knees and gingerly setting a hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
Whatever scared Dean away had to be more than one stray demon, and as terrified as he was, Castiel intended to get to the bottom of it. He’d spent long enough abiding by Dean’s advice to let things lie. The supernatural had its turn coming after him; now it was time for Cas to return the favor. Dean had saved Castiel’s life twice, and he didn’t plan on letting Dean walk away without letting Castiel save him too.
that you have the ingenuity to succeed at whatever you decide to put your mind to.” He tapped the back of Dean’s hand with every syllable of the last few words, deciding in a split second to let his hand rest there at the close.
“There’s some fucking crazy guy trying to kill me!” the man spluttered, grabbing on to Dean’s jacket like a lifeline.
It wasn’t that he was afraid Sam wouldn’t understand. Even if the shame and the self-hatred still simmered inside him, he knew that if anything, Sam was probably more open-minded than he was. Maybe it was a little bit that he was embarrassed like he had a schoolboy crush, but he couldn’t pretend that was it.
As the second verse came around, Cas bowed in his direction as if to say “take it away.” Dean snatched the microphone from the stand and gave it everything he had. Maybe he was no Freddie, but he wasn’t thinking about being good or bad, he just wanted to let loose. “Are you happy? Are you satisfied? How long can you stand the heat?”
“It does sound like our kinda thing,” Dean agreed. “But we’re on our own case right now, on our way to New York.”
While I was at the gallery, I met someone. We got to talking about art, and it turns out he got an art degree from the same college I did. He’s older than me, so we never crossed paths while we were there, but what a moment for the universe’s curatorship. He invited me to the theater tonight, and I said yes. I’m not sure if it’s a date, but I’m nervous either way. I know you’ll be absolutely shocked to hear this, but I don’t make friends easily. It’s nice to have someone to connect to.
Dean scratched his jaw, then grunted as he stood back up. “We should head back.” He came and stood by Castiel who rose to join him. “Can I ask you something?”
Castiel tried to unpack that sentence piece by piece, but he got more and more lost the further he went. He gawped, struggling to find something to say in response to that. Perhaps most puzzling was the fact that Dean hardly appeared bothered by it, like any one of those things was just another day in the life of a Winchester. Maybe it was. And Castiel thought a vengeful saint was a lot to process.
“I appreciate that, but you don’t have to babysit me.” She smiled, contrasting the exhaustion in her eyes. “I know I can handle it, it’s just—"
“I’ll keep an eye out for him,” Castiel assured her. “The agents are still here working the case; I’m sure we’re all in good hands.”
With a soft little smile, Castiel looked down at his hands. “I was just born with a rambling soul I suppose.”
Dean got to his feet and hurried to the bathroom, skidding to a stop when he flung the door open. “Ah, fuck.” He recognized the green coat of the woman in the hallway—the demon’s ride in, apparently. Dean crouched down to check her pulse, relieved to find she was still breathing. But he returned his focus to Castiel, grabbing a handful of towels from above the toilet.
“Hey, we gotta move!” he shouted, grasping Castiel’s wrist. Conrad had taken off in the other direction, but Dean hauled Cas toward the reliquaries. The curator dragged behind him, still peering over his shoulder although Sam had sent the spirit running again with another swing.
He cried out, and the effort exacerbated the throbbing pain in his gut. When he tried to move, he noticed all the tubes and wires connecting him to machines around the bed.
“Yeah, good, let me know when he finishes with that list.” He glanced at his watch. “I’m gonna try and catch the medical examiner, see if there’s anything else we can learn from the bodies.”
“Come on, dude, these past few days have been…weird. I can tell something’s up.” Sam wiped his hands on his napkin before cocking one knee and resting his arm on it. Dean had to give him credit for trying to bring it up as casually as possible. Sam was a smart guy; the chances that he hadn’t at least made an educated guess on what was happening were slim.
The grin burned through him, to where he almost missed the wink and the gun salute that accompanied it.
He cleared his throat, like that would clear the lump forming there. Sam’s absence from the seat beside him made the feeling starker, and despite the traffic breezing around him, Dean was struck by how utterly alone he was.
But Dean cleared his throat. “Nah, that’s, uh…that’s the most accurate assumption you’ve made all night.” He drained another shooter.
“Did the two vics have anything in common?” Dean asked, kneeling down to inspect the gouges in the stage.
“Hey, uh…Cas,” Dean said. Castiel didn’t miss the quick sideways glance from Sam at the nickname, but the disbelief of seeing them here overruled any social analysis.
“Well, I’m honored to join the family,” Castiel returned, “but just as a suggestion, I feel like the initiation should include a little less bodily harm.”
“I’d love a glass,” he said, looking around at the framed pictures on the stairwell wall. The farther he traveled up, the older he got in the photos—it was almost surreal seeing his life laid out so succinctly, from smile to smile, when it was so much more complicated to live out the moments in between. “I can’t believe you’ve kept up with the winery after all these years.”
Cas folded his hands on his desk, looking over to the window where most of the potted sprouts reached for the sun. “Thank you. Anna thinks it’s silly, but I feel…comforted knowing I’m keeping something alive in a place surrounded by things that are dead. Art and history are beautiful, timeless in a manner of speaking…and when you work in a place like this it’s all too easy to forget that life keeps going all around you. Taking care of them helps me remember that.”
“Tell me about the ‘doctor’ thing,” Dean said, sipping on an old-fashioned Coke bottle. He’d complained about the lack of beer a number of times, but he was strangely giddy about drinking Coke out of a glass bottle. “I can’t say I know much about ‘higher education.’”
“Don’t say that like it’s a negative trait,” he said, “as if being loud and boisterous is fundamentally superior.”
Cas bit his lip, shaking his head. “Cute, but we haven’t started yet.” He plucked one of the shooters from the pile and cracked it open, Dean following suit. “Okay…so despite your snide comment, I assume you have
“Sure…I can go print it out,” she said. Dean could hear the confusion in her voice, and he was reminded of the influence granted by the badge they carried around. She didn’t ask any questions, just trusted that they had some kind of rhyme or reason to the request. Lucky for the world, Dean thought, that they were trying to do some good.
“Dude,” Dean gushed, mouth still full, “if you got more suggestions like this…” He trailed off, eyes closed as he savored.
Another yell from Conrad cut him short, pointing somewhere over Dean’s shoulder. A wind picked up out of nowhere, rattling the glass panes and knocking frames against the wall.
his brain finally recognized. The images came flashing back: the smoke, the knife, the ambulance, bright lights. Dean. He gingerly placed a hand on his stomach, feeling the thick bandages, but he winced in pain again.
But the following week when Alex returned to class, Castiel thought about the question again. Alex looked pale and thinner somehow, hands shaking as he took his notes for the day. Maybe having the closure of a funeral wasn’t all Castiel thought it might be. When class ended, Alex hung back and waited for everyone else to leave.
My mother has the patience of a saint (although this phrase has been tainted forever, thanks), and she has loved having me here. But I know I can’t stay forever. With touring off the table and the museum long gone, I truly don’t know what to do with my life. I’ve been thinking about you and Sam, the way you just let the wind carry you. I don’t know if I could ever live like that, but there’s something exhilarating about the prospect of it. Maybe you’ve lived it too long to see it that way, and I wouldn’t blame you. Do you ever stop and smell the roses, as they say? To step back and take a moment to think how incredibly extraordinary your life is?
“Yeah…we did our part; I guess you’ll just have to use your five degrees and figure something out,” he said.
“Aced it.” Cas’s smile faltered, and he squeezed his eyes shut. When he opened them again, focusing in on Dean, there was a sheen of panic in the welling tears. “I’m glad you came back.”
But Castiel swallowed his trepidation and joined them at the desk, cocking his head to see the symbol upright. “That looks like Enochian,” he said.
He clicked on the email thread, grinning at the memory of receiving the typo-filled drunk ravings a few days ago. He’d read every email of Cas’s that came through over and over again, saving them to their own folder. He’d even started a draft or two in reply, but nothing he typed ever seemed like the right thing to say. And it never felt like the right time, and Dean was beginning to come to terms with the idea that it would never be the right time. Sure, he’d made that decision back in June when he left Castiel all alone in the hospital, but a part of him always held out hope that maybe something would change. That he could turn around and go back for him, wherever he was now. It was easier not to know.
Castiel had certainly paid his dues over the years pining after straight men. As much as he tried to not assume peoples’ sexuality, most often it was painfully obvious that his heart had chosen a lost cause. Generally speaking, he had a pretty successful track record being able to clock people that way. But the longer he sat with Dean, the more he started to doubt his initial reading.
Castiel waved to the security guard posted outside the closed wing of the museum. “I’m going to show the agent around the exhibit; we shouldn’t be long.”
She wrapped him in a tight hug that made him flinch, but he needed it all the same. “I’m so glad you’re here, darling; that museum might as well have made you one of the exhibits for how much you’re there.”
I’m still healing, but the doctors said everything looks on track to making a full recovery. I’ll have a pretty gnarly scar though. I’ve been told that chicks dig that? I wouldn’t know.
Dean took a long drink of his beer to buy himself time, working up to saying his piece. Why was the word itself so intimidating? It made him feel like a fraud--even if he knew how he felt, it was like he hadn’t
Cas wrung his hands, wanting desperately to be able to lay his burdens at their feet and forget about it, but his initial misgivings came back to him. Something about this didn’t feel right.
Sam waited to see if he was going to continue, but when Dean continued gazing at his unfinished burger, he said, “Dean, if that’s it, there’s noth—”
Dean grimaced. “Well, first of all, gross. Second of all, what, we got a saint who hates being entertained?”
The ghost stared straight past him, still intent on Conrad like Dean wasn’t even there. It reached out a hand, tilting its head in a sickly motion. “You are not deserving to walk the path of the holy, deceiver.”
“What we ultimately have to remember,” he concluded, flipping to the last page of his slides, “is that whether or not you regard these stories as factual or fictional, truth about the human experience emerges from any source of art. As we continue to engage with the text and its inspired works, we’re not looking to prove any kind of theological superiority. Instead, think about how these stories influence the world around us, think about the artistry used to craft such an undertaking.” He paused to let his words sink in, for the pens and keyboards to silence. “Great discussion today, everyone, don’t forget to keep an eye on the syllabus. Those project due dates will creep up on you.”
the idea of a ‘better place’ after we pass on, to imagine that kind of beauty awaits us.” Alex didn’t seem satisfied by the answer, and Castiel ducked his head to try and meet his eyes. “What’s bothering you?”
“Do you know if either of them reported anything unusual about the scene? Aside from, you know…” He gestured vaguely at the wall.
Lost in his cycle of stormy thoughts, Castiel barely registered the troubled look on Anna’s face as he entered their shared office space. He set his briefcase down on his desk and straightened out his tie as he collapsed into his chair. It was only then that he finally looked up and noticed Anna waiting patiently but desperately for his attention.
“No, no, I think I got a good one.” He thumped the cushion next to him, and Castiel handed him a glass of water.
“I don’t need a documentary, Cas, I just need—fuck!” He ran off at the sound of glass breaking, leaving Cas alone.
He slid it into the lock, shouldering it open as soon as it gave way. As he careened into the airy gallery, the first hints of the moon shone down through the skylights. His breath fogged the air.
“You gonna make it harder for me?” Dean asked, a hint of his usual humor returning. It would have been comforting if it didn’t feel like armor.
“The ambulance brought you in last night,” she said. Looking at her watch, she added, “And it’s nearly six pm now.”
