“That annoying thing with the stupid cuff. I can't watch my show because of your obsessive behavior.” Sam said slamming his hand down on the cushion. “It’s no wonder you were named after grandma, what with all fussing over that mirror for the past thirty minutes.”
After he changed into his pajamas and brushed his teeth, he was lying on the spare mattress; unable to fall asleep. As he thought over the evening and what he had seen, his thoughts ranged from ‘
“You said that I couldn’t hug you anymore,” Castiel said.
Dean rolled his eyes. “
? As far as he knew, Sam and his brother lived with their father because their mother had died.
"Okay." Castiel smiled back. Who could say no to Dean when he was so excited?
“Okay and was Madison blushing?” Dean prompted.
news.
As the days went by, Dean got worse. He got visitors all the time but he rarely wanted to see them. He was too tired and too fragile to want to see them. Cas could understand that but at the same time, he felt bad for their friends and for their family (especially for Sam) who wanted to see Dean.
For several minutes, he stared at Castiel sleeping soundly. After everything that had happened, Cas was going to die. Sure, he was still very pissed with him but no matter what, he still loved his husband. That’s why he made the decision right then. He pulled his slippers off, pulled the blanket up and laid down behind Cas.
"Dean, you're a very bad liar." Castiel sighed. "Oh alright, it's Anael."
Ash stuck his tongue out. “Nada señor, I’m a fucking genius.”
"Then we should do something about it, dad! Cas's dad is a bad guy."
Dean nodded at him and then went out to his car where Cas was waiting for him.
“I’m home.” Dean yelled as he entered his house, took off his coat and hung it up. As he kicked off his boots, he heard giggling. Besides the fact that his dad was working late, Dean was also sure that his father would never be caught giggling like that.
"Okay, Cas, I know I shouldn't tell you this, but you have to stay calm. The police will be there soon, okay."
“On one condition, Dean.” Chuck smiled slyly. Dean was beginning to think the guy never stopped smiling.
"I don't care, I don't care, I don't care!" Dean yelled and walked around in circles. Mary sighed and decided to call Naomi.
For a few seconds, it seemed that Cas was going to say something else but then he changed his mind and then just nodded before he went and got his Chemistry notes and textbook.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, Jo’s going to drive us. She needs the car after school. Plus, she could use the practice.”
“No problem,” Cas had said and then added, "I’m Cas.”
While rummaging through his locker, he felt something touch his head. He turned around but didn't see anyone and went back to looking through his locker. Then, he felt it on the other side of his head and suddenly heard giggling. He turned around and saw Dean.
Chuck smiled slightly, “Don’t worry, Dean. He’ll be fine.” He turned and walked up the stairs leading up to his house.
"How do you know it's going to be a boy?"
They were finishing up their weekly lab report when Dean said, “Any plans for the weekend?”
The next day, they ate breakfast together as a family and then went to the park. They spent the whole day there. Dean noticed that his father was trying to smile a lot more often and actually participate.
"Okay." Because he didn't know what else he could possibly say.
Jason, who had originally planted the idea in Cas's head and who now also had to deal with the sickeningly sweet couple.
"Apparently, that woman had a lot of clothes." Anna snorted. Castiel didn't see anything funny.
Suddenly he was pulled in for a hug.  Within seconds, he was hugging back. Then, Castiel was pulling back.
“So, you heard them?”
“I- I- ” Dean began but was unable to finish.
Sam sat up and rolled his eyes. When his eyes fell on the popcorn lying on the floor, he scrunched up his nose in disgust, and Dean said, “Yeah, buddy, you’re helping me clean that up later. Now who’s Madison?”
“Dean!” Castiel exclaimed. “Are you even listening? This project is worth 40% our grade.
A few days later, Zack had tried to get under Castiel's skin again. Dean punched him in the face and said, "I told you I'd be watching you. Oh and since you didn't understand me the first time, I'm going to tell you something else. My dad's an ex-marine, just in case you ever try that again." He made sure to stress every syllable.
“Oh.” Dean said and tried not to let the hurt be evident in his voice. But what right did he get to feel hurt anyway? It’s not like Cas owned him anything.
“I know Cas, I know,” Dean said softly and pulled his friend into a hug. They stayed like that for a few seconds.
When the time came for Dean to start pre-school, Mary had to deal with a big fuss.
Dean pulls off with a wet pop. He looks worried. "What? Is this-"
"Ah- ahh..." Cas murmurs, leaning forward to rest his cheek against Dean’s temple.
"He'll be OK." Jack repeats, mostly to himself. He hugs back, just as tight. "I'll say bye to Sam first."
Dean, now the dam has broken, no longer having to hold back with pining from a distance, apparently loves to kiss, to touch. From his observations of Dean over the years, Cas had suspected Dean was... for lack of a better word- needy. And clingy. Filled with a crushing loneliness, wanting to hold and be held. Cas could relate to that, because he's exactly the same. What a pair they are.
- I need-"
Cas is about to vocalise his irritation at Dean's comment, but Dean grinds down on him, rutting against his groin. Heat spreads through Cas' veins, as he grabs fistfuls of Dean's shirt.
Cas thinks, bitterly.
And he is not complaining in the slightest.
Not exactly how Dean would've wanted Cas in his bed. Bu he can deal with that later. Right now, getting Cas comfy is a priority.
"I'm guessing... it was good?" Dean asks, eventually, thumb stroking Cas’ hip. Under the smug words, Cas can hear the nervousness.
im not going to add anymore unexpected chapters but i do have other deancas smut i wanna write at some point
"Dean?"
The next day, they actually did plan to leave their hotel room, as much as Dean would be just fine having Cas on top of him all week, or vice versa. But, technically, they're on vacation (kind of- they're not drastically far from the Bunker), so they should just enjoy themselves without worrying about the world ending or something else terrible. Dean was fresh out the shower, drying off and, before he chickened out, put on a pair of panties. Pale pink satin, a little snug, but comfortable. He feels a little bashful, despite being just by himself. Dean stands in the middle of the bathroom, palming and tugging at the hem, nervously. He feels stupid, it's just underwear. Nobody knows or cares.
The nurse leaves them on their own and Jess leaves too, tears in her eyes. Cas and sam remain silent for a while until Sam leaves too to look after Jess.
Cas cups Dean’s face between his hands trying to make the Winchester believe that he didn’t do anything wrong.
Dean feels empty and cold in a sudden so he stops the running water, grabs a towel and steps out of the shower aswell.
HE steps through the door and gets nearly knocked down by the cold air. He stops and looks at the cloudy, grey sky and the thick snowflakes falling slowly onto the ground. He hasn’t seen snow during the last two years and he takes in a deep breath of the clear and cold air. Some cars are driving on the small street next to the military airport he just left behind. He stares down the street, not knowing what he’s supposed to do now.
“Good morning Dean.” Castiel comes into the living room and sits down in front of the sofa Dean insisted on spending the night on. “Morning.” he mumbles and slowly sits up. His head is pounding but it gets better after a seconds and he looks at the Novak in front of him.
Dean’s eyes look dull and there are dark circles under them. Cas eyes roam over the Winchesters arms until they stop at the white and thick bandages around Dean’s wrists. They seem clinical and at the same time horrifying.
“Any problems with the stitching?”, “No.”, “Alright let me take a look and then we’ll decide if we pull the stitches today.” Dean just nods and looks away as soon as the Doctor carefully pulls off the band-aids, he doesn’t want to have a breakdown in the hospital and he isn’t sure he’ll be able to actually look at the wounds without freaking out again.
The angel from my nightmare
Dean remembers the two long days they got him to stay awake until he couldn’t do it anymore and had to get waken up by a bucket of ice water.
He finishes taking pictures and moves to the desk to open the upper drawer. He looks at the folded paper with ‘Castiel’ written on it and takes it out.
“Jess?” Cas asks, his voice thin and shaking which makes Jess look at the man in front of her. His face is twisted in pain and his shoulders aren’t as upright as usual.
Since the Winchester never answers his question he just guides him into the Impala and closes the door aft him before he gets in himself.
The sound of the bathroom door locking was like a gunshot to him, deadly and unbelievably loud. He gets out of bed in an instant and seems to be standing right in front of the door in less than a second despite the knowledge that it must’ve taken him a little more than a second.
“You are?” he hears the bartenders voice through some kind of fog. He’s about to answer when he realizes that the bartender is not walking to him but to Cas who is now standing right next to him.
But Cas can’t stop looking at Dean’s back. He still remembers the clear, freckled skin showing off his muscles. Cas starts to trace the thick, pink lashes with one finger which makes Dean shiver a little. “Sorry.” Cas whispers, regretting it immediately and about to pull his hand away when Dean leans into the touch. “Don’t. Stay, please.” the Winchester whispers and Cas moves closer, wraps his arms around Dean’s torso and presses his chest lightly against Dean’s lightly tensed back before he starts kissing Dean’s neck.
“Is it alright if I wrap your wrists?” he asks softly and Dean just nods and lays his hands into Cas’ lap. The Novak carefully wraps the stitched up wounds with the white bandages and pulls Dean into a hug as soon as he’s finished. They stay like that for a few minutes before Dean pulls away a little.
“Cas?” Sam appears next to him, his eyes red and he’s sniffling. “You coming?” the Novak shakes his head a little. “Can’t leave him now Sam.” he whispers and looks at the coffin again. “You can’t stay here forever.” Sam whispers and pulss Cas into a hug.
Cas sits down next to him and just looks at the lightly shivering Winchester. Cas lies one hand onto Dean’s shaking left hand. Dean doesn’t move at first but then he lets his head drop onto Cas’ shoulder and closes his eyes, still shivering and breathing way too fast. He’s on the edge of a panic attack.
At some point Sam pulls him into a tight hug, whispering some words he can’t really make out but it soothes him anyway.
“Dean, Sam was old enough.” “He was sixteen.” “That’s what I just said.”
He has to leave. He can’t stay here any longer. He just can’t.
“How were your past years.” Dean asks in a sudden and Cas flinches. The past years were like hell. The constant worry about Dean, the amount of disappointment when Dean didn’t step out of the train like planned, the hatred because of everything, sometimes even because of his own stupid thoughts. He can’t tell Dean about that, at least not now, not the day he just came back. “They were difficult.” he answers instead and Dean keeps staring at him.
The waiting room of the hospital gives him more anxiety than he remembers and he just can’t seem to keep his leg from bouncing up and down. Even the room seems to get hotter by the minute and it takes everything in him to remember how to breathe properly.
“Dean I could really eat some breakfast. Wanna come?” Cas asks in a soft voice which pulls Dean out of his thought.
“We won’t go to the funeral, Castiel!” he hisses, anger in his voice before he leaves the room, leaving the rest behind, lost.
Cas placed his forehead against Dean’s. “I promise,” He whispered.
Dean doesn’t remember Castiel ever being so calm and confident.
"Dean, she's not that bad." Asher said. "Despite your differences, you might find that you guys have a lot in common."
“Okay, that was never on my bucket list, maybe on yours, but definitely not mine. And also, you do realize that we didn’t actually have sex, right?”
"I'll have both," Castiel said and Dean looked back at him, appalled.
"When's he coming?" Dean asked gloomily.
Dean smirked.  “You can now cross off car sex off of your bucket list.”
Dean walked hesitantly toward John and when he stood right next to his dad, the baby's eyes flew open and his little fingers flailed, as if searching for something, or rather someone. Dean linked his fingers with Sam's and said, "He's so small."
“Nothing’s wrong, I just wish -” Cas scratched at the back of his head, “I just hope they’ll be alright. I mean I know I don’t really know Meg’s mom or Luke that well but I think everyone deserves a chance at happiness.”
"I-" Dean didn't have time to say anything because his father interrupted him again and yelled, "It's your fault! Your goddamn fault."
"Alright." Castiel's ears had reddened a bit.
He knew his sister was just trying to help him but he couldn’t even smile back. What did he do to deserve to have the same stuff happen to him again and again? He was only a freaking kid. He wasn’t supposed to face problems like this, he knew that most kids his age certainly did not face these issues. It wasn’t fair and he knew he shouldn’t have thought it but sometimes he
“Sammy, Cas, can I talk to Dean alone for a bit?” John asked.
They sat on opposite sides of the bed, frowning. Suddenly, Castiel giggled and Dean followed shortly. Soon, they couldn't stop laughing. They were rolling on the bed with laughter, holding their stomachs.
Later that day, when the Winchesters were eating dinner, Mary noticed that Dean was frowning. Actually, he seemed gloomy ever since he got back from school. At first, she put it off as tiredness but on the other hand, how tired could pre-schoolers really be?
Dean nodded but then a thought occurred to him, “One more thing before I go. What was with the whole Mrs. Day thing?” Dean asked curiously.
“Yeah, he did and you know what I want to know?” Cas crossed his arms. “When the fuck were you planning on telling me?”
“Soda’s fine.” Dean said, and followed him.
“It’s alright,” John said, trying reassure them. “It won’t be long and you can come back in after.”
“I have been having headaches for quite awhile and not feeling well so I went to the doctor and they scheduled me for an MRI.” Castiel said, calmly as if he was talking about the weather and not a life or death situation.
Within a few seconds, John barged in the room and said, “What the hell is going on here?”
He looked at Jo, who sat on the other side of him and noticed that she was biting her lower lip while shaking from laughter. He couldn’t believe that he had lost her to the evil duo.
“Or maybe he can talk to ghosts, could explain why he’s always talking to himself in his apartment.”
“Dean,” Dean said.
“Probably still sleeping.” Dean said, as he made sure the cereal was soggy before he ate it. “Little dork likes to read, wouldn’t be surprised if he stayed up again.”
Castiel cracked a smile. “Don’t worry, I know what we have to do. I can tell you after lunch.” Dean was about to tell him where the kitchen was but then he realized as he saw Castiel walk there that Castiel remembered.
Castiel rubbed his eyes and padded across the living room to the kitchen. He was still wearing pajamas and he bit back a yawn when he saw a frown on his mother’s face.
Dean tried to say something back but the darkness overtook him. The next thing he knew he was that he was lying in a bed at Saint Luke's Hospital.
"Gotta keep up the family tradition," Inias said and put his arm around Naomi's neck. If anybody noticed that his grip was a bit too tight, they didn't mention it.
"What?" John asked in an irritated voice as he placed the bottle of liquor from which he had been drinking on the coffee table.
Shortly after Dean said goodnight, John pulled out the couch for Castiel and Anna and helped them settle in for the night.
The boy’s eyes widened. Dean couldn’t tell if he was surprised that Dean heard him, or that someone had responded to him.
“Sit wherever you want, just be careful with Teddy’s toys,” Anna called from the kitchen. “I don’t really care and Dave’s at work right now but if the little munchkin sees a mess when she gets home from school, she’ll go nuts.”
Winter break had come and gone and soon Dean’s birthday had arrived. Dean didn’t really want to throw a big party so he had a small gathering of family and friends at his house. And it had gone quite smoothly, just as he’d hoped.
“Don’t worry, dad, Dean can’t stay mad forever.”
Jo crossed her arms, shaking her head at him. “God, Dean, you really do live under a rock.” She snatched the paper back and stuffed it back into her bag. “Anyway, I’m going and that means you’re going with me or I’ll tell Bobby all about that swimming camp incident you had way back in freshman year.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John snorted. “Oh yeah, how do you figure?”
“I’m not being an ass, I just don’t want you here,” Dean replied curtly.
"Did you like it there?" Dean asked although he already knew the answer. Who wouldn't like Uncle Bobby?
“Bye, ma,” Jo chirped.
Ten hours later and Dean and Cas finally got to meet their niece and nephew.
"She always told me that if we had to pick a dress for her, she wanted it to be this one. So
"Probably at work. Mom says he
Cas smiled gently at that. “That’s your first question?”
“You going to the Thanksgiving dance?” Sam asked.
“I though you were having fun?”
“I said- I’ll need to-”
Dean was ready for his second semester of college. He couldn’t believe time had flown by so fast. It felt like he had just started college.
"Your dad is probably feeling it worse. He did know your mom from a very young age." Castiel pointed out.
Dean did speak more gently to him than to the other students and whenever they did group projects with Jason and Ash, Dean always sided with him.
“Oh Dean, I’m sorry,” Bobby said before adding on, “I just worry about you boys. I’ll stop asking you questions. But just know that I’m there for you, son.”
Dean was supposed to be grounded for a few weeks but John let up after a few days because he knew who was really at fault and that Dean was just doing what he thought best.
It occurred to Dean that he couldn’t keep calling him Blue Eyes.
Sam closed his book and put it to the side. “Oh, Dean, I’m sorry.”
Castiel and Anna had special permission to be off from school for testifying at court. Since Dean was to be a witness and Sam didn’t want to be the only kid in the household to go to school, John decided to bend the rules and let Sam stay home.
"It was okay. Yours?"
“And you’re staying there the whole summer, right?” Dean asked.
“Relax, relax he says,” Sam said and ran his fingers through his hair. “Are you kidding me? My wife is about to give birth. To twins.
“Are you implying that I am interested in Castiel Milton, socially awkward twin brother of Jaime’s? Because if so, that is so
When Dean said, “He just ran away, Sammy. Like what the fuck?”
“Well I’m no expert on pancakes but I can trust you with that field.” It was a known fact that Dean liked food.
“Oh just about somebody’s MRI results,” Dean said raising his eyebrow again.
“You better not do anything to hurt her.” Ash said while Jo went to give their coats in.
Naomi did not move at all. Castiel moved across the bathroom and turned the phone on.
“When will you come back?” said Castiel quietly.
After months and months of meetings and negotiations Cas had gotten a book deal. Now, he sat at his desk, staring at his computer for a long time, not sure where he would begin. He glanced over and saw the picture of Dean smiling back at him. He had put it up there when he moved out of the house and into this apartment. There were too many memories at that place and staying there had been out of the question.
As Cas rarely cursed, his profanity shocked Dean out of his stupor. Looking at Cas, Dean decided to cut the games and that he should go with honesty.
Dean and Cas hung out when they could. Although it didn’t seem like a lot of time, it was enough for them. They enjoyed each other’s company. Though they were sad not to have a lot of time together, they knew that it wasn’t the worst possible scenario. And due to their naïveté and their high hopes that everything would be okay, they weren’t prepared for what came in the next chapter of their lives.
“What?” Ash said in a hoarse voice.
Cas smiled weakly, trying to hold back tears and failing. "Me too."
Chapter eighteen
“Right now, there is not much you can do,” The doctor said. Upon seeing the stricken expressions on their faces, he added on, “But you can go inside and talk to him. He is awake.”
mention her." John had balled his hands into fists and his eyes held a wrath that Dean had never seen before.
“You know that not everything has a supernatural reason, right?” Sam asked tentatively.
"Cas, I know about the bruises. I saw them and I heard you talking to my dad."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shrugged the hand off and stormed out of the kitchen. John sighed and took a sip of his coffee. He cursed under his breath when he realized that it had gotten cold.
“Also just so you know the darkness is not our problem anymore.” Sam yet again had a confused face on and Dean grinned and said, “I’ll explain later. Now I have to go find Cas.” He clapped Sam on the back, “It’s great to see you after the week I’ve had.”
"Well my parents want it to be a boy and they're certain so I think that, too." Castiel smiled brightly.
At that, Cas’s eyes softened. “Oh Dean, I’ll miss you too. But we’ll text and Skype and before you know it’ll be the end of August.”
“I.. don’t know.” He looked up from his gaze on the curb and said, “Do you want to go somewhere?”
After the whole stranger-danger fiasco went down, Cas decided to take a nap and Dean was using the time to work on a new article. He had called Bobby and told him that he wouldn’t be able to come in to work for the next week or so.
“It’s always homework with you, isn’t it? Don’t you have any friends?” Inias snarled.
She told him that there would still be a forty percent chance of him getting the cancer back later on in his life even if he beat it now. But Dean thought that a sixty percent chance of never getting the cancer again was good so he agreed to try out the pill.
. Dean hadn’t prepared himself for this. See, a few days back, Dean had his second lab class. He had come in to it earlier to set up the equipment and prepare himself for his interactions with Cas. As this lab only met once per week, he hadn’t see the guy since the first lab meeting. And he thought everything would go fine. Which, surprisingly it did.
, mother." He kept shaking her, hoping that he would be able to bring the life back into her.
"You know Cas?"
“And another car hit him!” Dean could hear blubbering across the phone. But Sam kept talking through his sniffles. “The hospital called me like fifteen minutes ago and I didn’t know what to do so I said I’d call you and call them back.”
"Why?"
Cas crossed his arms and sighed. “What did he say, Dean?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “And what
"Hey she's the one who starts them." Dean exclaimed.
Dean’s ears reddened slightly and he bit his lip before muttering out something about packing essentials.
“That ain’t no way to raise kids-” Bobby shook his head and added, “I mean god knows how torn up I was after Karen died-” Dean watched Ellen squeeze Bobby’s hand gently “-But that’s no way to raise your kids.”
“That’s a nice story you got there, Dean but I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Cas said and then he shifted his gaze to look past Dean. And suddenly, Dean was brought four years back when he watched Cas stand in front of him and lie through his teeth, feeding bullshit to Dean and Sam and Bobby and expecting them to believe it. And with one glance at Cas’s face, Dean had known that that Cas was lying. Just like he knew now.
they were going to get out of this.
Dean, however just nodded for Cas to continue.
Cas nodded, “Well where me and Anna live.”
“Jerk.” Sam said in annoyed voice but the small smile told Dean that he wasn’t really mad.
“That night, I was so angry, God, I was so fucking angry and I just wanted you to feel at least half of what I felt.” It spilled out before Dean could think of what he was going to say. Cas always had that effect on him.
suicidal idiot." Anna took a swig out of her flask. Castiel hadn't even noticed it was in her hand beforehand.
Inias went to fill out some paperwork while Anna jumped into the chair next to Castiel's. She pinched his cheek before he had a chance to get away and said, "So how you doing, kid? Finding mom must've been traumatizing for you."
Dean, Cas and their friends were going to meet up later to celebrate their graduation. But before they could do that, Dean wanted to change and since Cas was staying over at his and Sam’s apartment that night, he went with Dean so that he could leave his belongings there and also change.
Dean shot up out of his bed. He coughed and swiped his hair from his sweaty forehead. He felt his cheeks and found them damp.
The whole event went by quickly; Inias made a few speeches (seeing as the priest refused to come due to religious beliefs), prayers were said and nothing out of the ordinary occurred.
After Ash and Alfie were done telling their story, they stayed with Dean for another hour, playing cards and talking about different things. They talked about how college was so close yet so far away. Ash was going to MIT and Alfie was going to BU so even though they’d be at different colleges, they’d still be pretty close to one another. Dean was happy for them but at the same time, he was kind of jealous that all of his friends were going on to the next stage of their lives when he was stuck in this godforsaken hospital bed.
It turned out that the mysterious person whom John had talked about did not have magical powers. In fact, Dean wished someone would give the woman magical powers so that they would help her appear a little less weird.
“After he caught us, he said, he said- ”
father.” Anna said sweetly.
And so their trip began. They travelled for a week. They went to the Grand Canyon and then to Niagara Falls and in between, they stopped at different places. And they talked to each other and learned more about themselves and each other. They found their way back to each other.
"You're my friend, not her," Dean argued back.
“Real funny, Dean.” Sam said as he walked to the kitchen. Then he hollered, “Do you want to eat or have you eaten already?”
"And you'll be the one in charge so you'll be able to torture them." Anna smiled slyly at Castiel.
, Dean.”
"For the record, if you wanted to, I wouldn't mind chasing cars with you."
“Panicky?” Cas supplied. Then he felt guilty.
Dean swallowed and tried again. This time, he managed to say, “Okay, um-” before deciding to squeeze his eyes shut. Maybe this was all a dream. Hey, give the guy break, he did just discover that his friend-turned- boyfriend (for the past year) was a vampire, a
Jo gave him a strange look, a look that most people gave others when they were out of the loop but expected them to know everything anyway. “Didn’t you hear?”
The rest of the evening went by smoothly. No other beverages were spilled and Dean had shared a meal with Castiel.  They got along so well that Dean hadn’t noticed that time had gone by.
Cas flinched.
“That’s true,” said Cas. “I guess we can go see her next weekend, if you don’t have any plans?”
Unfortunately, Asher just said, “I love them but I have no idea where the fuck they are. Piss off.”

“Whatever, Singer, I have to go to class,” Cas snapped as he walked away, leaving Dean behind.
After taking many pictures and having some lunch, Naomi left with Dean and Castiel. John promised that they would come back that night. Dean didn't want to leave but he knew he had to. He knew that his parents would eventually come home and he couldn't wait until then because it meant that Sam would be coming home with them.
Castiel had the habit of wearing a lot of layers and for a lot of people, it made them look like an oversized snowman but Castiel somehow managed to make it work. Dean especially loved when Castiel would keep his scarf on and Dean got to see Castiel in his scarf quite often whenever he came over to do schoolwork. Sometimes Dean would allow himself to sneak glances at Castiel’s neck wrapped in whatever tacky patterned scarf he chose to put on that day and Dean’s mind would race. Dean wondered how it would feel to slowly and gently take the scarf off and to run his fingers down Castiel’s neck and to feel a pulse under his fingers and then maybe he could feel it with his lips too- Dean’s thoughts usually stopped right there because if they didn’t- well there would be more than just a party in his pants and that would be quite difficult to explain to Castiel.
. There was nothing there and honestly, Dean would have driven past it but Cas said he felt something off about the place and so they took the nearest exit and went into the forest.
"Does your mom's face have anything to do with it?"
“Really?” Sam uttered. “You’re going with
"'orry, guys." John swallowed and then took a sip of his drink. He glanced over to his son and noticed that Dean still had a frown on his face. He exchanged a concerned look with his wife.
As he walking out into the hallway, someone stepped in front of him and didn’t let him pass.
“I know, I’m sorry,” Castiel said and whispered, “Do you want a divorce?”
"Don't worry, Dean said the same thing." John laughed while Castiel sat down next to Dean. He made funny faces, expecting a response but was disappointed to see that Sam wasn't really responding. In his opinion, babies were pretty boring.
“It’s a curse,” Cas said as he ran his fingers through his hair and sighed.
The other boy, who was previously finishing his homework glanced up from his paper and said, “Nah don’t think so. Dad wants to go to the movies with me and Sammy. Says he wants to spend some quality time with us,
“Hey what’s that?” Dean asked, intrigued.
"Your father was very worried." She exclaimed.
“So you weren’t going to tell your boyfriend of two years that you were diagnosed with lung cancer?” Cas uncrossed his arms, then crossed them again. “You didn’t think I should know.”
Sam sighed. “Yeah, for you to stop referring to us as kids, Deanna. We’re four years younger, not forty.”
“All I’m saying is that you should be
, I miss her so much.” It had been years since his mother had passed away but that didn’t change the fact that he still missed her to this day.
“C’mon, Cas, he’s obviously lying.” Sam said. “I love my brother but sometimes he can be such a stupid martyr. You have to know that this whole ‘I don’t need you here’ is just a bunch of bullshit to get you to leave so he doesn’t feel guilty about keeping you here.”
Ash’s aunt, Ellen strolled into the Winchester house in a matching dress shirt and skirt. She had the same rollers in her hair the day she had picked up Ash. Dean wondered if it really took women that long to curl their hair.

“Here, this is for you.”
“Watch where you’re going, fag.” Zach, the captain of the football team snarled as he shoved Cas back into the lockers. His friend, Michael, laughed and then grabbed the books Cas was holding and threw them on the floor.
Ellen snorted. “That’s true, but don’t let my daughter hear you talking about her driving skills. You’ll never hear the end of it.”
“Yes?” Sam asked.
Dean looked up at Castiel questioningly. "Your father is just upset. Give him time."
“I-um-.” Truth be told, Dean didn’t even know what the project was supposed to be about. He hadn’t been listening and he was hoping that Castiel would tell him.
The music blasting from the house could be heard a few blocks away. That didn’t seem to matter to Victor Henricksen, who was the party host. He was walking around his house, laughing as he greeted the guests.
“I don’t actually require sleep,” Cas said solemnly. “And no, Dean, you might have forgotten but I do have a bed, a bed we share. The coffin thing isn’t actually accurate.”
“Our friends can wait,” Dean said, winking.
“How could I say no those eyes?” She laughed and said, “Okay, let’s get the ingredients.”
“Well good thing that you’re not a food critic or we would’ve had some problems.”
“Oh,” Castiel said softly.
night, Castiel had taken the couch and Dean had stayed in their bedroom. Castiel supposed it wasn’t his bedroom anymore.
Dean didn’t mind that at all.
“Oh.” Dean said and then pulled the textbook to him. Here he was not even sure what he was going to do the next day and Jo was telling him that she had planned out the next two or three years of her life already.  How was he supposed to know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life at sixteen?
"You just had to have your stupid macaroni and cheese, didn't you? Couldn't deal with what she made? Well guess what, now she's dead and no one's here to make you your favorite food." John kept shouting.
He’d had another nightmare. And apparently this time, he was crying.
“So what do you do?” Dean said, deciding to change the subject.
“Umm- I’m sorry, sir, really, but maybe you could talk to him about it rather than shouting at me.” Chuck’s voice got quieter by the second.
Though school had started only a month ago, it felt more like a year had passed. Both Cas and Dean were swarmed by homework and rarely had the time to hang out. Furthermore, Dean decided that he wanted to try out for the swim team and spent most of his Saturdays in the water at the school pool.
Dean tried not to blush at the insinuation.
“It’s basically the same thing. You guys are still siblings.”
"Cas, I'm your friend. Well, I guess boyfriend now, ha. Anyway, you should tell me stuff."
"Dean, what are you doing?" Castiel asked as he noticed that Dean was headed toward Zack's table. He tugged on Dean's arm but Dean pushed him away lightly and said, "Stay here."
Eventually, they remove themselves from the bed. They shower separately- the hotel's shower was way too small for them both, unfortunately. After Dean showers, and Cas goes into the bathroom, he dresses. Dean almost considers just wearing his regular boxers, but decides to pull on the dark red lacy underwear, instead. He pulls on his jeans quickly and layers up. Cas is in his usual attire, when he leaves the bathroom. He doesn't even need to shower, but it's something he learnt to enjoy from being human. He smiles at Dean, softly.
“Can I come in for a second?” the Winchester asks and the Novak nods. Sam sits down in the chair in front of the desk without moving it at all and looks at Cas with sadness and pity in his eyes. Or at least that’s what Cas believes it is.
“I told-no, I promised you I’d be here.” He whispers and his blue eyes stare into Dean’s green ones. “Cas?” Dean whispers again, still not believing that he isn’t dreaming and keeps staring at Cas who takes a step forward and pulls the Winchester into a strong a hug.
“Dean, wake up.” Cas whispers and softly kisses Dean’s forehead.
“I told you to stay in the car.” Cas hisses at the Winchester who’s still standing outside and looks like Cas really surprised. “Sorry, Dean, I shouldn’t- I’m sorry.” Cas whisper but Dean just smiles lightly and follows Cas into their room. This room is bigger than the last one and the walls are made out of the same old wood as the rest of the house. The bed is standing in the middle of the room and Cas looks at Dean. “Wanna move the bed to the wall again?” the Winchester doesn’t answer and just stares with unfocused and scared eyes at something that isn’t really there. “Dean, hey, Dean!” Cas yells at Dean who finally blinks and looks at Cas with tears in his eyes.
He moves right next to Dean who nods and Cas moves closer until Dean can bury his face in the crook of Cas’ neck and shoulder and Cas starts stroking one hand through Dean’s hair until the phone starts ringing. The Winchester sighs but Cas gets up before Dean, leaves the room while and picks up.
“Would you mind moving the bed against the wall on the left?” “No problem, let’s do it.” Cas answers in a calm voice but internally he could scream right now. Not at Dean or anyone, just to let out all his anger. He really wants to know what happened to Dean but he can’t push the Winchester to talk about it because it would just make everything worse.
“Dean?” he starts and continuous when he is sure that Dean is still listening to him.
“Cas, that’s such a beautiful view.” Dean whispers in excitement and Cas slowly wraps his arms around Dean from behind to let his chin rest on the Winchesters shoulder who carefully grabs Cas’ hands.
“I love you. I love you so much.” Dean moans and Cas presses him harder against the wall, pressing his lips against Dean’s who lightly presses his tongue against Cas’ teeth. “I love you too.” Cas whispers into the kiss and presses even closer against Dean.
Thanks for all the reads, comments and kudos, I really appreciate them.
Dean looks around the room. Next to the bed, which is placed in a corner, headboard under a big window, is a small night stand with a record player and an old looking lamp on it. On the other side of the room is a closet next to a small desk with some paper and a few pencils on it. Dean recognizes Cas’ drawing and gets up to take a better look at it. He always loved the way Cas’ portrayed things. He never uses any color, just his pencils, ‘makes me more comfortable, he used to say every time Dean asked him.
It starts to snow again right before they leave the diner and Dean stops walking in front of the Impala and just looks up at the sky watching the snowflakes fall to the ground, the cold, clear air is the best thing he ever felt after twenty months of the sweaty and bloody air in the huts they were in. Cas hugs Dean from behind, slowly so it wouldn’t scare the Winchester and together they watch the dancing snowflakes falling onto Cas’ hoodie, Dean’s flannel and the Impala. They finally cut themselves loose from staring into the grey sky when they hear the door of the diner open, get into the Impala and Dean instantly turns on the radio and starts humming.
So this was Chapter 1 (Obviously) Anyway it'd be nice if you could leave a comment and tell me if you like the general idea if this ff.  :)
“Happy New Year.” Cas whispers and Dean pulls himself closer against Dean’s body, the strong arms around him calming him down.
I am not sure if this chapter is any longer than the last one, but once I actually finished this story I'll definitely beta-read the chapters and all that stuff.
“You know the most of it actually. I don’t wanna work through it by just talking about what happened. That’s just making it worse.” Cas nods and waits for Dean to continue.
He turns around and looks at him with a questioning look. “Please call the therapist Dean.”, “I’ll think about it doc.”, “Good. And I don’t wanna see you in my ER again alright?” the Doctor smiles a little and the Winchester chuckles. “Sure. I can do that.”
“He-” Sam’s voice is raspy and he stops. “He- fuck.” the Winchester starts shaking and Cas can tell he must be crying. “Sam, the doctor will-” “He tried to fucking kill himself, Cas. He-” Sam seems to completely fall into himself so Cas hugs the seventeen year old close to his body, tears now gathering in his eyes aswell. He can’t tell if they’re from anger, disappointment or jut plain sadness, but dares not to let them fall. Sam needs him.
TRIGGER WARNING
“Dean, I’m fine, you’re fine. You’re here, with me, Jess and Cas. No one’s hurting you, not anymore. And I won’t get hurt, I promise.” Sam whispers and pulls his brother into a strong hug.
“I-” he starts but cuts himself off when he realizes he’s been yelling. “I care about you Dean. I love you. Of course I would’ve worried but we could’ve figured out something together.” he sits onto the bed right next to Dean and takes his hand.
“You ever even cooked pasta?” she laughs while Dean tries to figure out how the stove works with a light smile on his lips. “No, not really, Cas-” he falls silent and he seems to look at something not exactly here. “Dean, hey come back here.” “Sorry.” “It’s fine. You know how to cut tomatoes?” Jess asks with a laugh and Dean actually chuckles before both of them start making dinner.
“And Castiel?” the doctor asks right when he is about to leave the room. “Yes?” “No heavy topics the few days. Just try to get him to relax. I know he doesn’t want to be forced into the mental health facility but I’ll have to if he’s not cooperating. So try to concentrate in lighting him up and leave the heavy stuff for his sessions with Miss Vallens. He’ll have two of them today and tomorrow and a last one in two days.” “I can do that.” the Novak just says before he goes back to the waiting area to wait and contact Sam with the news.
The Winchester makes his way into the bathroom, washes his face and puts on some clean clothes before he grabs his bag, locks the door behind him, pays for the room, gets into the Impala, looks for a nice diner to eat breakfast at and then settles for the last miles to Sam’s apartment.
He doesn’t know how long he was just sitting there staring at the black screen of the TV but he moves when he hears a shattering sound coming from the bathroom.
Cas stays not knowing what to do now. He just keeps staring at Dean’s pale, freckled face. His right hand lies on the white sheets next to Dean’s left. Cas wishes that Dean would at least blink but he isn’t moving at all. Until Cas suddenly feels Dean slowly gripping his hands and he slightly squeezes Dean’s hand, careful not to hurt the Winchester and looks at Dean’s pained face who looks back at him, eyes half closed in exhaustion.
The hot water drips onto his head and he closes his eyes, trying to process what happened today. He got Dean back, after horrible years unknowingly of Dean’s whereabouts or if he even was alive. Years of false promises.                       Cas still remembers the first time they had told him Dean would come back, that was two years ago and Cas was waiting at the train station for Dean who didn’t arrive. And now he’s back but he’s not the same person he was the day he left. Cas feels tears building up in his eyes but he bites them back. Maybe it’s just today, maybe Dean just needs to realize that he’s home, save.
“Are you kidding me?” Cas laughs lightly and looks back at Dean who closes his eyes, a small smile on his lips while humming to the song. The Winchester suddenly stands up, wraps his arms around Cas and buries his face into the other man’s hoodie. “Thank you.” He whispers and Cas pulls Dean closer against his chest. They stay like this until the song stops.
“I don’t ever wanna lose you cause I can’t survive this shit without you. I can’t get over it without you, I need you Cas. I love you.” Dean mumbles and closes his eyes, tears burning in them.
“He told you, didn’t he? He told me he did.” “I knew about his diagnoses, yes.” “Good. Now some check ups.”
“Welcome back.” Castiel whispers and pulls Dean into a soft hug, the Winchester lets him, not having the strength to fight Cas and somehow longing for it.
“I- Cas, I don’t need you to understand. You probably don’t and I’m fucking glad that you don’t but- please don’t hate me now, you know how much I love you. I do. But- thing is, there’s no joy for me in this world anymore. Not in watching Sammy grow up and become himself, not in college, not in driving the Impala, not in listening to music and- fuck. Not even our relationship brings me joy anymore. I don’t- I just- I, I can live without the joy in everything, but you, my boyfriend, the guy I really fucking love not bringing me joy anymore that’s a new kind of fucked up.”
“Dean?” Cas releases his grip, his breath going fast and a slight of nervousness is creeping up inside of him. Dean turns around, slightly confused of the sudden change in Cas’ mood. Cas inhales deeply before he slowly falls onto one knee and holds out a little box with a silver ring in it to Dean.
His home.
The Novak starts to run his hand all over Dean’s muscled back and freezes. He can feel the thick thumbs of the scars even through Dean’s shirt, how comes that he didn’t notice before?
Cas slowly opens the door to the bedroom and walks to the bed where Dean is sitting on back against the headboard, looking at the bandage around his wrist.
They just got onto the main road when Cas decides to ask Dean about what happened the past years. “You wanna talk about it?” he asks carefully not wanting to upset Dean in any way. “Not really. They said I could get someone to talk-“ he stops and keeps staring out the window. Cas turns the radio down a little before he turns to Dean again. “You think it would help you at least a little?” the Dean he knew would shake his head and start laughing about how Cas could think he’s crazy and that he should just shut up. But now he just shrugs his shoulders. “You don’t expect me to go see a therapist right?” he asks with a whisper and Cas shakes his head instantly. “No, I don’t expect you to see a therapist. I don’t even expect you to talk about it. I just think that talking about things that upset us helps. It helps me. And I want you to know that I’m always there for you and you can talk to me about it when you’re ready, even if it takes you decades, I’ll always be there.” Cas gets quieter at the end and Dean just nods. The music stops and a thanking speech, dedicated to all the soldiers who were in Vietnam, fills the car which makes the Winchester turn off the radio in a rush.
Nope. Not gonna think like that. They're gonna grow old together, instead. He's gonna give Cas everything he wanted.
Dean can't keep his own hands to himself. He needs to touch him.
"C'mere." He repeats, coaxing Cas' knee up onto the bed. Cas is compliant to Dean's handling, but when he has Dean's leg slotted between his own, he ruts gently against it. Eyes fluttering shut; little noises of pleasure that make Dean feel a little crazy.
Dean thinks, getting the reminder of the fact. That knowledge is both a blessing and a curse. He thrusts his hips just slightly, as he fucks Cas' mouth. The noises Cas makes goes straight to his dick. Hands run through his hair, tugging sharply when Cas brings his fingers in to cup his balls. He bobs his head at a steady pace, as Dean falls apart above.
, Dean." Cas chokes out.
"So, you like wearing them? But for, uh- comfort?" Is Dean's question. "You- you said you weren't gonna mention them."
"I know, ok, I know." Dean says softly. "But just- just let me do this for you."
"Just five."
Dean makes a sound that absolutely isn't a needy whine. "C'mon, Cas..."
Cas tilts his head, but obliges. He looms over Dean; he looks more wrecked than Dean would've expected. He glances at the mirror. The imbalance of him being entirely nude, whilst Cas is mostly dressed, stirs something in him. He likes it. When he shifts his gaze back, Cas' slight smirk tells him that he coined on. Dean pulls him in by the tie for a heated kiss, because like in Hell is he going to be the only flustered one. The friction from both their bodies pressing together have them moaning into each other's mouths. Cas breaks the kiss, eventually. His mouth is red and shiny, as he licks his lips.
"Long story short- the kid pulled you out." Dean carefully takes the glass from him. Cas tries to ignore the brush of fingers. "You were asleep when you got out- and we could've woken you up, but I-
Dean thinks bitterly.
Cas feels wrecked already, dizzy on both the feeling and the realisation that this is real. His shirt is half opened and pushed down his shoulders. Dean's eyes dart from his chest, then back up to his face. He licks his lips, with a look of mock-thoughtfulness, before he flicks his tongue over one of Cas' nipple. Cas- already high strung- lets out a choked noise, writhing under Dean. He's already getting hard, canting his hips up against Dean's. There's a sense of relief that Dean is also half-hard, he's just as affected.
"I just thought-"
Cas sinks slowly into Dean. He kisses him soundly when he settles fully inside him. They rock together slowly, but the pace steadily increases, because they're too impatient and have all the time in the world now.
Cas seems to catch on. "We don't need to explore anything, Dean. I am happy just simply being with you."
This seems to soothe Cas slightly. "I suppose it can be... be weird to watch oneself." He muses, half to himself. Castiel is completely unashamed of his body, if he wasn't so attached to his trench coat- or that he had a kid, or lived with other people- Dean's almost certain he'd walk around naked. Not even in a kinky way- he's just unfazed with his physical existence. Dean wonders how much he considers his body as his own, now that Jimmy is gone.
There's a sudden surge of vibrations in the air, as the slit expands. Same and Dean brace themselves- someone else might crawl out- as Jack stumbles out of the Empty, supporting the weight of a certain trench coat-wearing, scruffy angel.
, the hotel probably fell '
It was fairly new to the both of them, this relationship. Dean, being with someone for a decent length of time was somewhat new territory. Castiel, in a general sense, was new to the concept as a whole- aside from April, which was... not great. He's a fast learner, though. And loves exploration.
"I need you here."
Cas huffs. "I wasn't going to mention it." Then his expression changes from less annoyance and more distressed and nervous. "Is it a problem? I'm aware that-"
"C'mon, c'mon." Dean says, soft, but desperate. He sounds as on edge as Cas does.
"Y-yeah."
His expression becomes a grimace. "I need to-" Sliding off of Dean’s lap, he stands, a little shaky, gesturing vaguely at his crotch. "This is... uncomfortable."
After a bit, Cas pulls out of Dean, getting a whine from Dean. Cas silences him with a kiss, before he heads to the bathroom. He returns with a washcloth and less clothes then when he entered.
Dean also enjoys Cas wrapping his legs around his body- or his head, when he goes down on him. Cas can feel the grin, when he arches his back and moans heavily when Dean moves higher up his legs, the prickle of stubble brushing against his inner thighs.
“Dean, do you want to marry me?” The Winchester tries to find his words at first. Confused by the question. Adrenalin shooting through his veins, blurring out all the other sounds around him, the question of the man in front of him is repeating in his head again and again and again.
One blink later he’s strapped to the chair not able to move anything besides his head.
All my loving to you, or some other chick flick stuff that's making me want to throw up.
“I-” his voice breaks and Sam has to start anew. “Dean wrote short letters to Jess and me and there’s one for you in the upper drawer here.” He points at the desk and it’s three drawers but none of the men makes a move to actually open it.
“I-I found him on the bathroom floor, he- he was lying in his- I’m sorry I should’ve done something Cas. I- I should’ve known.” Sam cries and buries his face in the palm of his hands and Cas can’t do anything but try to sooth the younger one by rubbing small circles on his back.
“You wanna talk?” Cas tries, he remembers that Dean told the nurse he’ll work through all of it with Cas. He is slightly surprised when Dean nods.
“I failed.” Cas slowly whispers and looks up at Sam. “A friend he had over there died and I just told him. I actually promised to tell him but now he’s like this again.” Cas started crying and Sam pulls him into a short hug.
“Cas, Dean. Jess and I- , Cas?” Sam stops next to the bed where Cas and Dean are on. One man curled up against the wall staring into literally nothing, the other just sitting on the bed staring at his feet.
"Don't silence yourself." Cas' tone is neutral, but Dean can feel him half-hard, and pressing against his ass. Dean grinds down, making Cas grunt.
Cas pulls back from where he was pressed up into Dean's chest, to get a good look at his face. Carefully, as to not disturb him too much, he traces his fingers over the lines on Dean's forehead, his cheeks, eyelids. There's a spread of warmth in Cas' chest. Dean's aged over the past twelve years that Cas has known him, but he's still a beautiful soul, in a beautiful body.
It's silly and sappy. And perfectly what they have needed for so long. Somehow, Castiel does not mind one bit.
"Cas... you look," Dean says. He sounds starstruck- Cas can see his expression in his mind, it spurs him on- he wants Dean to see him. "You look like somethin' amazing."
Dean.
"Open your legs for me."
"Yes."
"Alright, buddy. You with me?" Dean asks, after a couple of moments. He's dimly aware of Jack and Sam staring at him, wide-eyed.
Admittedly, he didn't expect Dean to bring it up. And Cas would've never mentioned it again if it meant Dean would be happy.
"C'mon, man." Dean says. He sounds weak, lonely. Desperate. "Cas, I miss you."
He comes into Cas' hand. Castiel follows soon after with a heavy moan, filling Dean up. He nuzzles into Dean's neck. Dean glances over to the mirror. They're flush, breathing heavy and beautiful.
Eventually, he pulls away, feeling very human and all the self-consciousness that comes with it. He imagines his eyes are red, skin blotchy. Dean silently hands him back the glass of water, to which Cas takes with relief.
So, he does. It doesn't take long for a third finger to be added too. Cas pushes against Dean's fingers in a desperate pace.
Ah, shit. He didn't realise his eyes were shut. His vision is a little blurry. "Can you blame me?" He probably shouldn't feed Castiel's ego, but they're both trying to be honest with each other. Healthy relationships and all that.
"You're more sensitive than I would've thought." Dean says, switching to the other side, teeth and tongue worrying the nipple. His tone is mild, despite the pleased grin on his face. Cas supposes having a literal angel fall apart from one's touch would give anyone an ego boost.
"Fair point."
Cas kisses him, unbothered by the morning breath. "Would it really be our first?"
He grins. "You better not either."
He's cut off with Dean kissing him. A slight clash of teeth, and it's an awkward angle, but Cas sinks into it. He feels Dean's hands on his face. He grips Dean's arms.
Cas ruts against Dean. "I want you in me." He murmurs.
"See?" Jack says, wide, proud smile on his face. "I said I could get him back."
He hitches his knees up, keeping them spread. There's a sheen of sweat of his forehead, and he's breathless. Dean's staring at him, lips parted, pupils blown wide, palming himself through his boxers- was he still in his boxers this whole time? He must've of giving Dean a disapproving look, because Dean's mouth quirks, and he quickly strips them off. Nudging the head of his dick against Cas' hole, he hooks one of Cas' legs over his shoulder, kisses his ankle before pushing in. Cas moans with pleasure, enjoying the sensation of their skin slapping lewdly together. He throws an arm over his eyes, the other reaches down to give his dick uncoordinated strokes.
Then Cas blinks when the sinking realisation of that, not only is he in one of the Bunker rooms, he's in
"Emotionally, yes. Physically? Messy."
"I want you in bed with me."
"Dean, we can pretend it didn't happen. It's OK, I'll be OK if we went to how it was before." Cas manages to keep his tone neutral. "I don't- don't need my feelings to be reciprocated. I simply enjoy spending time with you, as best friends."
He isn't sure how long he cries, but Dean pulls him into an embrace, murmuring variants of 'it's OK', as he strokes down Cas' back. Cas presses his face into Dean's shoulder, grasping the fabric on his back. Dean kisses his temple.
He gets Cas out of his coat with difficulty- Cas was hardly cooperative, but he successfully manages to wrangle the angel out of his beloved coat. Cas mumbles something- sleepy irritation at being jostled around so much- but Dean isn't done just yet. Somehow, having Cas sleep in a full suit doesn't sit right with him.
All Dean can do is lean down and kiss him, tasting himself on Cas’ tongue. They have to part eventually, so Dean can actually take his clothes off. As much as the power imbalance excites him, nothing beats the warmth of skin-on-skin contact.
room. Dean's bed.
Dean grins sheepishly. "Want room service?"
With a fading grace, Castiel couldn't tell time as acutely as he used to. When he next wakes, he predicts that maybe two hours have passed. He isn't sure the time is, though. He never asked and Dean had been... quite distracting.
"Cas, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry." Dean mumbles.
Cas decides not to remind Dean- who enjoys when Cas shoves him roughly against the wall- he learnt that from the Pizza Man. So, it's not entirely uneducational.)
They spent a long time in the shower, until the cold water forced them out.
They're quiet for a moment. Cas knows Dean isn't being entirely honest, though his aversion seems to bore more from awkwardness at emotions than something terrible he doesn't want Cas to know about. He isn't sure if he's supposed to be reassured by that fact. He won't let himself be hopeful. Dean has stung him in the past.
"Hey, hey." Dean says, softly. Cradling Cas' face in his hands, he gently wipes under his eyes with his thumbs. Somehow, the gesture makes Cas cry more.
And that would be fine. It's a well-worn path at this point. Maybe it won't be as bad this time. He'll just be told to leave this room, but not the Bunker. They'll come back together, as they always do, and continue like nothing ever happened.
"Get a couple beers ready." Dean tells him. "It's gonna be long night."
Dean places his hand over Cas'. It's warm and rough. He takes a breath and Cas can hear the shake in it. There's a bubble of hope in Castiel, but he dares not let it expand just yet.
"Uh- right! Yeah." Dean goes bright red, when Cas pulls off the stained panties, apparently unfazed by the audience. His now softening cock and upper thighs are sticky, and Dean's eyes are absolutely refusing not to stare. Dean gestures blindly to the corner of his room. "My-my laundry hamper is, uhm, over there..."
"I'm sorry, Cas."
It's not like Cas ever shied away from touching Dean. But being lavished, it's only fair he sates his own hunger. When they're at their most intimate- hands roam over bare skin, a rapidly increasing heartbeat under his fingertips. An erratic pulse. It's all so very familiar. Dean couldn't remember when Cas rebuilt him, hands dancing around his soul as he repaired him, down to the painstaking detail. Each freckle, every eyelash.
They're basking in the afterglow now, Cas' head is settled on Dean's chest, listening to his heartbeat with a small smile. Dean's idly stroking Cas' back. He's more than a little tipsy on the sex-high, and the feeling of security has him loose-lipped.
The hotel wasn't anything fancy, but after a life of motels that ranged from '
Cas ruts almost lazily against Dean's hip, moaning quietly into Dean’s mouth. Dean reaches down to stroke him. Cas visibly shudders, so Dean suspects he isn't going to last long, either.
He isn't sure how long they stay like this, but he shudders slightly when a warm hand touches his cheek.
Perhaps it's due to the life Dean has lived- it most certainly is- how could it not be a reflection of a life he never chose? - but there's a fixation with Cas' hands, particularly with his fingers. Not really too surprising for Cas, he has his own fixations- he harbours a slight smugness with the handprint he left on Dean's shoulder. He brushes over it with his lips.
It has never always been gentle caresses from him- from both of them. They were a violent pair, lethal together, and against each other. Weapons of their fathers. Finally allowing themselves to soften at the edges.
- to me..."
"What? Doing it in front of a mirror?"
"Dean?" He speaks softly, fingers gently resting against Dean's jawline.
Dean moans and jerks his hips against Cas' hand. The movement stops.
Dean kisses the base of his spine. "Alright, turn over."
There's some movement in his peripheral vision- Castiel placing coffee cups on the table and approaching him.
"I'm sorry I made you think that you... that you couldn't have this. Uhm... this being us, I mean. Like I... I don't know... made you think I strung you along, or something. Because that hurt you."
"Maybe." He rubs the back of his head. "Weren't we gonna go out today?"
It's not a situation Dean was expecting to be in. Nor one he would've ever suggested- despite the communication shit, there's some things that could never come easy. But sitting- fully clothed- on the edge of the bed, whilst Castiel stands between his legs, near naked, aside from the satin blue underwear, was not something Dean ever considered. His dick has definitely expressed interest, though. He's trying not to squirm.
Cas looks thoughtful. "We could try something."
Dean's words wrap around Cas' brain. He doesn't speak. Dean rubs the back of his head.
Cas mumbles something incoherent, clearly not going to last much longer. Usually, he has Dean work for it. Dean has his tongue back on his heated skin, sweeping over his nipple. Cas curses loud and desperate. Dean can feel the tremble of his body.
Cas' tense shoulders loosen, a tiny shuddering breath escapes his mouth. Dean's seen Cas naked plenty of times now at this point. Castiel is pretty shameless, usually. He certainly gets a kick over making Dean flush red, but shies from affectionate attention. Dean smiles up at him, reassuringly, before he lowers his gaze to Cas' torso.
Cas looks like he's debating to make Dean beg, or just to get on with it. He opts for the latter. He crawls down Dean's body with a messy trail of kisses. When he reaches the hem of the underwear. The head of Dean's cock is peeking out from where the panties had shifted. Cas tilts his head and kisses the base through the fabric, before he gently tugs at the waistband. Dean raises his hips slightly, so Cas can pull them down. He only goes low enough so Dean's cock is free. Dean opens his mouth to complain about the restraint, but it's drowned by a moan, as Cas takes him into his mouth.
"I've never experienced it before." Is Cas' usual response. "You'll be fine. I won't 'spill the beans' on your sexual exploration."
"Dean! I-
"Oh, shit." Dean says, dazed. Apparently, that had only just occurred to him. "Yeah, what do you want? Anything, you- you can have it."
Cas kneels over him, smugly. There's a deep thrill that comes with rendering Dean speechless. Without breaking eye-contact, Cas sinks down, until Dean is nestled all the way in him. His eyes flutter shut.
Cas understands. He may not understand Dean's jokes, but he understands Dean.
Cas isn't sure how much time passed, but Dean pulls away, slightly alarmed.
"How- how long?"
His mouth is obvious. Kissing has become a favourite activity between them, one they partake in frequently. But his lips seem to have Dean captivated, he traces over his cupid's bow with a feather-light finger, pressing the tip into his mouth to tease, grinning at Cas. Kissing the corner of his mouth, sweeping his tongue over Cas' bottom lip, making him sigh, wanting more.
It's their first time, he wants it to last. He wants it to go a little differently.
Dean laughs. "That's- yeah. Fair enough."
Cas' kisses the back of his neck. "Not in the slightest. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever laid eyes on. Still is."
"It was wonderful, Dean." Cas says, sincere.
It's early days in their relationship, so they're trying to get better at the whole healthy communication thing and working through kinks. It hasn't been as awful as Dean thought, but it’s been messy- the first few days after Dean admitted his feelings had involved a lot of crying- whilst trying so hard not to- from both ends. And sex. That also involved crying. It had been an emotional week.
"You are beautiful, Dean Winchester. In a physical sense, of course. But also, your soul."
- saying that."
"Dean..." Cas murmurs, between breaths. A couple of buttons have been popped open.
Cas reaches down between them to grip Dean. They're messy and frantic, but Dean's too overwhelmed too care.
"Dean..." Cas mumbles. His pupils are blown, lips parted.
The first day and a decently-sized chunk of the next was spent having sex. It was twelve years in the making, and Dean's pretty sure that they've touched and kiss every part of each other's bodies- learning what they each like. Dean doesn't have the most experience with men- and Castiel has none- so there was a learning curve. Castiel is a scarily fast learner, though. Dean suspects that he already knows his body intimately well, which makes Dean fluster when he thinks about that too much. Which is hard because Cas likes making Dean squirm from affection, like the bastard he is.
Dean opens his mouth to speak again, but Cas beats him.
"Thanks." Is his immediate, acting-unbothered-but-secretly-pleased tone. His cock is twitches with interest. The traitor.
(See the end of the chapter for
im not very kinky (even tho i like to imply the characters i write are) although i dont think deans a super kinky person anyway (probably unpopular opinion lmao)
"Cas?"
Cas raises an eyebrow. "You have fetishes. You are hardly, as they say, 'vanilla'."
- see souls?"
"I trust you."
A smile spreads across his face. Shifting from where he was resting against Cas' belly, he straddles his hips, so he can lean down and pepper kisses along Cas' face. Cas scrunches his face up in an obvious delight. Grinning wild and free at the kiss onslaught.
Dean gently takes Cas' hand, helping him. Castiel is going to fall, but it's fine, because Dean's with him this time.
"Would you-" Cas begins, breaking the silence. "Be interested in doing it again?"
Dean grins. "Good?"
Dean blinks. He's always a little caught off guard by 'I love you's'. But steadily, he's been getting use to them.
"C'mere." He murmurs, pulling him in by the hips. He doesn't need to- he was hardly far. But Cas was never fazed by Dean handling him, seemingly to enjoys it, if the little sigh is anything to go by. Dean glances up, seeing the traces of a blush scattering Cas' cheeks.
He reaches for the lube and preps Dean. It doesn't take long, they're both eager and horny. Cas leans back so he can push his pants down, just low enough that his cock is out. He strokes it a few times to slick it up with lube.
"You keep-
"Holy-
Cas knows Dean very well, though. So, the unspoken demands were met. Dean wants to make sure what Cas wants is being met, too.
Dean looks at himself. It's a different sight for him- covered in several layers, blood and God knows what else when he's on a hunt. Naked, aside from the dark red lace. It stands out against his pale skin, along with the dark marks Cas left from previous days. He looks softer, more exposed- a side of him he rarely shows to anyone. Not even Sammy really gets to see it. He presses his chest into Castiel's hand with a whine, when Cas tweaks his nipple again. Dean manages to not close his eyes, but he's gripping the bed sheets like a lifeline, when Cas brings up his other hand, so the other side of his chest isn't neglected. Dean ruts against Cas.
Cas getting increasingly flush, just shrugs, mind focused on something else. "Yes, I prefer them to boxers. If I'd known that they did something to you, I would've worn a more amorous colour."
"Be my guest."
"Do I even wanna know what we were watching that bought that up?"
Cas blinks, starting to become aware of the mess of his hand, and Dean's softened cock still inside him. He's still loose-limbed, so Dean eases him down. They bask in each other's afterglow, just light strokes along their sides.
"Y'know, for a guy who isn't even meant to sleep," Dean says, tone cheery to hid the strain. "You're doing a hell of a lot of it. Are you catching up on the lost hours? You better not, cause that's like, what? Billions of hours, probably."
"Mmm... I'm-
"Soon," Dean agrees. "He's been climbing the walls, waiting for you to wake up."
Dean's smile is please, but shy. Cas decides he likes it a lot, maybe it's one of his favourite smiles. He's a little disappointed when it fades to a grimace.
At first, Dean thought he was in a coma, or the angelic equivalent- is there one? - but Cas does wake, sometimes. Only for a few moments, a flutter of eyelashes and incoherent mumbling. Dean leans over, hands anxiously touching Cas' face, quietly asking him if he's OK. But Cas weakly stares back, it's hard to say if Cas is even aware of where he is. Or who he is with. He somewhat reminded Dean of Sam during the trials- the weakness, the exhaustion. Cas looks much healthier, though- and Dean's gonna take that as a good sign. Dean had wondered if he was feverish, but Cas wasn't gross and sweaty, or even really sleeping bad. He drops off pretty quick after. Dean lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding.
He slowly gets into the Impala and just breathes for a few seconds before pulling out his phone and the number for that Chuck guy that the Doctor gave to him. He stares at his phone for a few seconds before he just dials and presses call. No turning back now.
“Did his adress change?” “No.” “And he must be twenty-one right?” “Yeah.” “Good. You can go to the waiting area and I’ll get you as soon as Dean and Miss Vallens are through with their session alright?” “Sure.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas moves closer to the Winchester and lies one hand onto his shoulder. “Sorry.” Dean mumbles at Sam and Jess who just nod at each other and stand up to let as and Dean have some time on their own.
The enemy is asking for- nothing.
“We’re on our way.” Cas answers Jess and smiles back at Dean. “How are you feeling?” Cas moves closer to the Winchester who shrugs his shoulders. “Not as crappy as yesterday.” “We won’t head to Manhattan today. We’ll go there for New Year’s Eve if that’s okay with you?” Cas whispers and Dean smiles and nods in agreement.
He could never forget that week. How a tired and beaten up looking Dean knocked at his door, tears in his eyes, and asked if he was allowed to stay for a while. He asked Dean to stay longer but he said he had to go back, “Have to take care of Sammy, man.”   and smiled sadly.
He makes it around twenty miles before the thought of just speeding and driving the car against a tree or something crawls into his mind making him dizzy. His mind is full of voices, mostly Cas’s telling him how stupid and naive he is for thinking he could ever be loved, and the car sways a little but the Winchester gets it back onto the road. He can’t do that to Sammy, at least not without properly saying goodbye.
“Dean, don’t tell me this isn’t real.” Cas says in a confident voice before he softly presses his lips onto Dean’s. He missed the feeling of Dean’s lips more than he would ever admit. He missed the excitement creeping up in his stomach when Dean finally kisses Cas back pulling a little away from the wall and closer to Cas and wraps his arms around Cas’ neck. Both of them pull away after some time to catch their breath and Dean lets his forehead fall onto Cas’ shoulder constantly mumbling apologizes into the other man’s shirt.
“Wanna talk about it?” “No.” “Alright. Just say so if you need someone to listen.” the Novak adds, trying not to sound too disappointed and Dean nods, knowing that he’ll probably never will come back to it.
Pls leave kudos and comments, i love to read them xD
The Winchester looks for a tree in the huge park next to the college so he doesn’t have to sit in the sun the during the break.
He promised himself to stay the same he was before, to not let them change him in any way. But he broke and they made him break this promise he gave to himself. And Dean Winchester usually never breaks his promises.
When the Novak steps back out of the bathroom he finds the Winchester standing in front of the rather huge window and looking outside. They’re on the first floor and have view over the hospital’s garden. A few people are walking around some are just sitting on the benches installed all over the small garden. It’s not raining but the sun isn’t shining either, coloring the world in a grayish tone.
“You wanna turn that on?” Dean shakes his head but cuddles up against Castiels side. “You wanna talk about it?” Dean shakes his head again and closes his eyes. Cas pulls him closer against his chest and the Winchester starts shivering right after.
