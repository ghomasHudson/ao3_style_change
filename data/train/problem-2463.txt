He realised there was no point in delaying any longer.
She took out her phone, considering to text Sherlock, but decided against it. She had nothing to say, really. No riddle for him to crack. And the fewer communications she had during her current mission, the better. Just in case.
“It doesn’t matter. You shouldn’t worry about that.”
Sherlock just nodded silently.
With many thanks to ewebie, for letting me ask her questions about British ICU’s and to julzann for giving me loads of info that helped me to accurately describe John’s medical situation. I decided to take some minor literary license for the story’s sake, but overall their information did enable me to make the hospital scenes a lot more realistic.

He was.
“Alright,” John said. He swallowed. He and Harry had a difficult relationship, and he wasn’t really bursting with enthusiasm to ask her over, but he himself had suggested they get to know each other’s family, after all.
“I want to go home.” She was crying now.
“I’m quite sure we’re looking at an abduction for ransom,” he said to John, “the clues to which need to be found closer to home. We’ll go to Holdernesse Hall tomorrow morning. Nothing we can do in the meantime. Will you text Beverly?”
Initially, the affair had hardly seemed worth his attention. A girl had come to him because she suspected she was being stalked. But there had been something a tiny bit unusual about it, and Sherlock had been bored, so he had decided to take the case after all. And he still hadn’t solved it to his satisfaction.
“That is, in fact, a lovely idea, yes.”
Oh god, they were shagging.
“So his coat and shoes were never here?” Sherlock inquired.
After that, more hand movements followed, which he couldn’t make heads nor tails of.
“An art gallery?” Sherlock repeated, apparently liking the idea.
Just then, John carefully bowed down over Sherlock’s back, resting one hand on the desk and reaching below Sherlock with his other hand.
snot, he mused.)
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock swallowed.
All Sherlock had to do was come up with a tactic, somehow, to have Sherrinford draw what happened that fateful day. Then he would finally be able to find out what made Sherrinford do what he did, and what it really
“Ka! Ka!” Rosie called enthusiastically.
As he let the water spiral down the drain, he thought about Harry and her life back in Russia. About the good work she was trying to do, in spite of the dangers – especially seeing as she was just a foreigner there. In some strange way, it was a bit comparable to his mission in Afghanistan. Bringing tolerance and justice where it was lacking. And now they were both in a same-sex relationship with a mad chemist.
He presses another kiss to Sherlock’s jaw, gently splaying his left hand around Sherlock’s neck, and it almost feels natural, as if they’ve always been doing this. Maybe simply because he’s dreamed about it so often.
“Yes, I’m sure he was being... hilarious. Sorry, did you say
“I… I…,” Sherlock stammered, taken aback.
Sherlock was busy typing a text. “I needed a hug,” he said, without looking up and continuing to type.
The man was a maniac! A
It was Mycroft. He looked like a ghost. His suit was all crumpled up and dishevelled. He seemed to hesitate, before he spoke. “Marcus didn’t make it.” His voice was thick.
The rage continuing to swell inside of John was now threatening to become a proper storm. “No need to keep lying about it, Sherlock. Mycroft as much as admitted it to my face! And she told me herself.”
John grinned, lifting one eyebrow. “That means we’re a good match, then.”
it is. But I’ve never been intimate with anyone, so in a way, I can’t really be sure.” He nodded slowly. “But I really do want to.”
would associate crime with these lovely old farmhouses.”
Sherlock had frozen his movement mid-fold, as his eyes remained glued to one spot on the map.
That night, Sherlock once more had the same dream of Rosamund speaking to him through a television screen. Her cold eyes pierced his soul as she said, “Go to Hell, Sherlock.”
Faith giggled a little. “No! We’ve never met.”
Sherlock missed John from the minute their lips had stopped touching on the corner of Blandford Street, and it made his stomach clench that he had no clue as to when he would see him again. Irritable and tired, he dropped onto the sofa and closed his eyes. As soon as he shut out all visual stimuli, images from the pornos he’d seen the previous afternoon came drifting back into his mind; as they had at several – very inconvenient – moments during the day as well. But this time he didn’t try to push them away.
By the way, I will definitely post the last chapter tomorrow! :)
“I want this,” he assured him.
Sherlock was quite calm when he said all this, as if he was finally looking at the situation from a distance, simply stating facts.
“Good thing you know a street in Clapham she occasionally passes through,” Hannah said, from the kitchen, where she was preparing Rosie’s bottle. “When she visits one particular safehouse.”
“How did you sleep?”
Sherlock and John both grinned sheepishly.
When they asked after her personal life, she even told them she had now finally found a local therapy group that had helped her stay off the booze for over a year already. That she and Natalya were in a good place – Natalya having finally landed herself a rather good job at a large chemical company, which was basically a hobby that she had next to her ‘real’ work at her own little lab at home, in the second bedroom, trying to make durable bioplastic.
“Excellent idea,” Sherlock smiled back.
This was not just about the thrill of solving puzzles, John knew. He wasn’t sure whether it was a matter of really
“You too.” John turned and left.
By the time they arrived at the back of the building, where a ladder was still propped against the wall, blackbirds were already twittering in the darkening shrubbery, as dusk was threatening to set in. Sherlock climbed up to the window, glad to have his torch in his pocket. He instantly ascertained that someone had indeed tried to wrench the window open with a blunt object in at least three places. And it definitely looked as if they hadn’t had a torch with them, judging by the sloppiness of the breakage. Sherlock took out his magnifying glass and also the torch, as he would need it to be able to see clearly at a five times magnification that diffused and weakened the light twenty-five times. But before he’d even positioned it, he spotted something glistening in the light of the torch beam. Tiny droplets shone where the wood of the window frame had been damaged.
That sounded vaguely familiar, but not quite. “And where are you going?”
So they mostly stayed home, for the time being.
Which, of course, had been exactly the point of a holiday.
John was in the shower, which was boring, so Sherlock was on Twitter.
“Oh god, thank you. Thank you so much.”
And at the same time,
had appeared to be reduced sufficiently to finally start pulling back on the sedating meds. So they had. And not a day too soon, as far as Sherlock was concerned.
Any minute now, the people from Interpol would arrive and swarm this peaceful beach. Soon after, the press would follow.
And after many repeated thankyous and promises to often visit each other, Hannah left.
John’s heart was hammering in his chest as if it were trying to break free. As much as he wanted this, it scared the shit out of him all the same. He so badly wanted to get this right.
Sherlock looked at him with a radiant, watery smile and nodded, crawling back on top of John and kissing him.
John felt like he might explode from pure joy. Gradually, he saw his feelings mirrored on Sherlock’s face.
* * * * *
John had needed a bit of seducing to get him into bed today. Sherlock happened to find John particularly adorable when he was hesitant and unsure, which was the way he had been also during their first time; and the first couple of times afterwards. It triggered a sort of trust and love in Sherlock that had made it possible to be relaxed enough to actually do this in the first place. On top of that, John was careful, attentive and controlled – even if sometimes a bit dominant – which made Sherlock feel truly safe (never once minding the dominant bit).
“Amazing, the times a man doesn’t really look at your face.” She turned and walked across the room. “Oh, you can hide behind a sexy smile, or a walking cane...” She turned and looked at him with her mismatched eyes, “... or just be a therapist, talking about
But John would need to play the grieving widower for a while, and besides, they were supposed to be estranged now.
“So where did you figure we should buy them, then?” John asked.
“Um, well, no. Never been there.”
With some effort, Sherlock fixed his gaze on Smith. “I want you to kill me.”
“Hm. I’d rather have a sausage,” Sherlock couldn’t resist replying.
She had then followed Watson around for as long as it took until he noticed her.
By using a rubber bullet on John, she’d ensured that John would get severely injured without him actually dying, knowing it would most certainly –
“Hallucinating!” He laughs again and then momentarily forgets what he is laughing about.
Obviously, it wasn’t a surprise party, exactly – but they did both sort of pretend that it was, which was quite a lot of fun in itself.
In the first place, Sherlock decided no other patient could be allowed to stay in John’s room, if only to avoid unknown visitors getting close to him.
“I was in Sherlock’s bedroom, yes, because that’s where I sleep now,” he told Greg.
Sherlock ground his teeth.

. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” he said. He stepped down to the concrete, tottering on the spot.
at all that we missed, it might definitely speed things up for us here, you know, seeing as we haven’t got, well, a single lead.” He dragged a hand over his mouth, cursing inwardly, once again, at how the day had gone. He needed a pint, more than anything. And he would definitely get one as soon as he was done at Baker Street. “So if you could make it quick, that would be greatly appreciated,” he said with a sigh.
Sherlock always felt a little uncomfortable being back home with his parents.
of this,” Sherlock said solemnly. “I’ve never had any sort of sex with… well er… anyone, really… but you.”
, before letting out a long, contented sigh. “... incredibly happy.” He stood up and leant his hands on the bed. “You know in films, when you see dead people pretending to be dead and it’s just living people lying down?” He shook his head. “That’s not what dead people look like.” His voice and gaze became more intense. “Dead people look like
A sharp crease ran across the middle. The bottom two-thirds of the paper had slightly faded. There was a pinprick at the top. The smell and structure of the fibres betrayed repeated exposure to steam and a variety of cooking vapours. Tiny kitchen. No visitors.

, was extremely hurtful, and unnecessarily so.”
“Right.”
Although somewhere deep down, Sherlock had secretly hoped for this kind of reaction, he still wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. “Please do correct me then, John,” he said timidly, as he studied John’s face.
“Alright, I guess. I’ve been worse.” She’d felt a nervous smile flicker over her face, in spite of her resentment. “And you?”
“You can stare at me all you like. I’m yours now.” He yawned a smile. “Come on, give me a kiss.”
He felt, simply, happy. (And that word did not even make him want to vomit anymore.)
“I did.”
Held in place by a piece of glistening white foam, there was a comically bright orange plastic ring, with a little sticker of an overexcited cartoon bee on the wider part, where there was usually a diamond.
John gently squeezed Sherlock’s fingers.
John looked past Sherlock’s shoulder to where the voice came from. Sherlock could hear more people coming through the doors behind him and spoke to John in a low voice and at quick fire speed, “Thirty feet and closing: the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history. Help me bring him down.”
John had turned out to be worse off than expected. On the one hand, it would be a pity if he never woke up – which now seemed likely, from what she’d seen.
or because of Sherlock’s own fingers.
“But before that, nothing? How about you, then? Your room was also on that side of the house. You didn’t hear a fight, or my screams?”
“Oh Jesus,” John panted.
“Not funny,” she said.
“You’ll need a special outfit,” was all he said.
John laughs. Surely Sherlock is pulling his leg, just because John went and got drunk and is oversharing a little – well, a
“Well, that’s the main thing.” John smiled, wondering vaguely whether this might be something that Sherlock had actually thought through.
Not about John losing his second virginity just that very morning, though. He did think about that a lot, and probably smiled about it more than he should, but – naturally – he didn’t say a word. He did think she might have sensed it, nevertheless, because she, too, smiled a conspicuous amount more than usual.
lover now did help to avoid any rivalry.) Another agent, a big guy called Daniel, was assigned to work undercover at Speedy’s Cafe, right below their flat. Sherlock, John and Hannah each carried a small device with an emergency button to summon him – and each other – if necessary. The four of them debriefed every afternoon in Mrs Hudson’s kitchen, but so far, nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
“Opt-in ignorance. Makes the world go round.”

Rosie followed all the goings-on at the baggage check-in, security and customs with interest, but thankfully soon fell fast asleep once their plane was up in the air and heading north, towards Oslo.
John felt panic wash over him.
Feel free to rec this fic on tumblr or Twitter/Facebook/wherever, if you are enjoying this!

Only a few more months, I hope!
even wanted.
“How can you do that?” John asked, clearly baffled. “I mean, how… how are you even allowed in here?”
Jim had ended up dead, as well as Sherlock – or so it had initially seemed. Eurus and Rose had been left feeling completely lost, like two floating rubber boats on a vast ocean.
Sherlock chewed his lip. “My entire childhood, my parents seemed to actively keep me away from him. Never took me with them when they went to visit. It was as if they were trying to simply make me forget I ever had a second brother. They removed his photos from the living room. As if I could forget a
“Sorry sir, but—”
“So you didn’t know what was about to happen.”
Eurus Moriarty is clever, but Sherlock Holmes is cleverer. Greg makes a valiant attempt to help catch her. And John might wake up from his coma soon…
During dinner, he let his parents chatter away, occasionally giving short answers to their mindless, pointless questions

‘LA SPECIALE PERLA NERA È SCOMPARSA’
Still not the end! :) Three more chapters. Btw, one of the fun things about writing a fic like this is finding out there is a website [https://www.sunrise-and-sunset.com] where you can enter any place name in the world and a date of choice, and it gives you the exact times of sunrise and sunset in that place on that day. Also, Google Streetview enabled me to ‘walk through’ all these places in Norway that I’ve never been to irl, so that I could describe them as if I had. Amazing! Long live the internet, lol. (I’m one of those fossils who can quite clearly remember the time before it existed. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to write fic back then – or publish it, for that matter! We are honestly so lucky in this day and age…)
“Oh god yes,” he replied with a soft, mischievous smile, shaking his head just once to one side without taking his eyes off Sherlock.
John’s frown deepened. “I would never
John turned out to be busy kneading dough. The kitchen worktop was covered in flour, as was John’s apron and one of his eyebrows. In the oven Sherlock spotted the source of the lovely smell: an almost fully risen, golden loaf of bread.
something that prevents people from just telling the ones they love how they feel, creating all kinds of infinitely complicated situations up to the point where they have to go and pay a detective to solve it all?”
Good God. If he ever wants to get another leg over in his life, he should really start trying to remember his dates’ names and basic personal information, like profession. (Don’t ask after the pupils if she’s not a bloody teacher, Watson.)
John clears his throat. It is now or never. On the spur of the moment, he chooses the more daring approach. “Sherlock, what you did to me two nights ago, would you do it again, if I reciprocated?”
Hannah had merely given him one of her mysterious smiles.
“What other option?” His brother looked absolutely bewildered, and a little worried.
Sherlock got up, pulling his thoughts away from Sherrinford and into the present, and took Rosie from her, mock-seriously telling the infant off. “Hey there, you cheeky little primate. How are you ever going to grow into a proper Watson, if you behave like this, hmm? Keeping Hannah awake in the middle of the night, and screaming at all of us?” He lifted her in the air above him and gently wobbled her to the left and right. “There should be a law against it. Yes, there should!”
He sat back in his chair, as an infinitely sad emptiness crept into him. But even before he became fully aware of it, the void quickly filled with an almost crippling anxiety. Was all this really worth the price Sherlock had had to pay? He and John had become inextricably fused, like two sheets of paper that were glued together and could only be separated with great damage as a result.
be, by the end of the week. But still! Here’s some milk and sugar if you want it. Well, I’ll just leave you to it, then. Call me if you need anything, alright?”
Soon after, he felt John’s firm hands on his arse cheeks, pulling them slightly apart, before John’s prick tenderly caressed the sensitive area around his entrance, spreading the lube around as he circled it. There were also some teasing fingers – must be thumbs, Sherlock thought – very lightly stroking that mystifying erogenous zone where his buttocks met his thighs, causing a local eruption of giddying goose bumps, accompanied by an impatient whimper involuntarily escaping Sherlock’s throat. He didn't want or need much foreplay and he hoped John could tell.
Sherlock waited patiently.
John just smiled back conspiratorially.
John opened his mouth, but she kept talking, pointing an angry finger at him.
Greg didn’t make such attempts and just shrugged, beaming. “Yes,” he said. “If you must know, we’re very happy together. And yes, it
“Yes, sir.”
John let out a fondly disapproving grunt while he sat down on the bed next to him, and started to pour some tea.
After that, he waited. It was vital to intercept and delete the replies before Bob and Violet could read them themselves.
“Easier?”
properly,
She had asked him some strange, detailed questions about how Mary had died, by way of introduction. He supposed it was customary. But still. He’d simply said he didn’t want to talk about it. “An old lady shot her. It was an accident.”
At that, Sherlock wrapped his arms firmly around him, while rubbing his forehead against John’s temple like a delighted cat. The embrace was possibly even tighter than the one after their first kiss had been and John was slightly afraid he might end up bruised. He chuckled. “Yes, I will marry you, you crazy bastard.”
Eurus splayed her hands against the cold, silent tiles, feeling the warmth get sucked out of her fingers.
Their task was done. They were safe now. Finally out of the woods. Thanks to Sherlock’s accurate prediction of Eurus auditioning for Ophelia and to his flawless scrutiny which had enabled him to recognise her. And, of course, also thanks to his brilliant disguise, which he’d accomplished with Hannah’s invaluable help.
John was peacefully asleep beside him.
“Saheed, yes.”
Nearby, John looked at him in concern as he continued to spin.
Now that they were more open and intimate with each other, John kept discovering more layers to Sherlock that had been hidden previously. Like his fascination with bees, his love of dancing, and his rather impressive artistic ability.
The next morning, when Sherlock was in the middle of an experiment involving twenty-five dead mice and eighteen pounds of calcium oxide, the postman finally delivered the essential item for his other research. Or rather, practice.
Sherlock cautiously sat down next to him.
“Haha,” she laughed. “That must be Jonathan White’s little girl, then. She’s probably around your age now.”
He looked around, spotting two new art works of the cats: painted beams of sunlight reflecting beautifully off their fur and whiskers.
Just FYI, the bloke from Crimson Peak who is mentioned in this chapter is Tom Hiddleston. :)
“No?”
“Oi! You’re splashing bloody coffee over my bloody crime scene!” Lestrade yelled. “ I can’t bloody believe this! Out!” He waved his arms wildly. “Get out, you two,
“I just wanted to bring you some of these,” she said, carefully setting the plate down on the little table beside him. “They are honey biscuits. I baked them this morning. I was trying out the recipe for Mrs Turner’s charity event next week. She’s raising money for the homeless pets vets.”
Sherlock looked at Smith silently for a long moment. “Same way you catch any other killer.”
Sherlock smiled faintly, blinking repeatedly. “So you think that there actually is a chance,” he said, hesitantly, “that when we’re old and wrinkly,” – he briefly made a face at the idea of ever reaching this state – “we’ll still be together, like this, as a couple, I mean?”
What the heck did he even mean by that? Surely Sherlock was allowed a little frustration, right? As long as… it didn’t involve any sort of substances, that weren’t…

this,” he mutters, “but--”
is Irene Adler?! Isn’t it?
The first thing John saw was paintings. Dozens and dozens of paintings: a few hanging on the walls, but most of them standing on the floor, stacked behind one another against the walls. All sorts of different worlds displayed hyper-realistically and in lively colours. At first glance, some almost looked like photographs.
It would only be a matter of time before he would disappear from his life altogether, and this time for good, of course.
John brushed away a stray curl that had stuck to Sherlock’s forehead, and smiled.
“I’ve got twelve people of MI5 on the new Moriarty case,” his brother’s voice said. “Doctor Watson’s daughter should be sent to a safe place, preferably out of town. I was thinking with Mummy and Daddy. I can send over one of our agents who’s raised a baby herself, to take care of her and guard her at the same time. What do you say?”
Each of those options slowly started to conjure a myriad of scenarios in his mind, each more horrific than the other.
John was barely holding it together by this point and in his head started compulsively reciting the only Shakespeare sonnet he knew (once learnt by heart for some silly contest in his uni days); anything to keep his vital functions within normal parameters.
“I was wondering. Does he still get tantrums?”
A couple of phone calls with Janine later, he had an opening date for Sherrinford’s first exhibition.
Saturday dawned cloudy and wet after a nightly thunderstorm. John was still half asleep when he noticed he was chilly. He turned around to his other side and hugged Sherlock from behind.
to be.
This took some more effort than he had anticipated.
They kissed again.
Sherlock felt himself mirror John’s smile, multiplied by ten. Everything in his life right now was perfect. “You didn’t orgasm, though.”
It had been hellish.
John blinked himself to fuller wakefulness.
“God, we definitely have to try this the other way round some day,” John panted. “This feels so amazing. I want you to feel this, too.” He meant it.
that should be plastered, John, not you!” Sherlock wheezed, unable to help himself.
He frantically started pulling open drawers, rummaging inside them until he found what he was looking for. Then he switched off the overhead light. Shining his UV torch onto the note, two words appeared in large letters, overlaying the handwriting.
It wasn’t that she was afraid of dying, Vivian Norbury thought to herself. She had long known that the end was near.
They were on their way to see Smith’s ‘favourite room’. Not the room that provided bliss from IV bags and unrestrained confessions for Smith, apparently.
“And you wouldn’t believe it,” he continued, “but right then, he received a text from an old friend, who I thought was dead. Irene Adler. You might have heard of her. She’s a minor celebrity; the scary mad one.”
A few days prior, they had started to study the alphabet in BSL in order to learn how to spell names. Sherrinford could now sign his own name and those of his family – which was no minor feat, seeing as letters had no meaning to him whatsoever; as he naturally didn’t associate any sounds with them. For him, they only corresponded with silent, vague, meaningless mouth movements.
“Oh, thank god! Are you alright, sir?” John asked, in keeping with his previous exaggerated manner. He found it easier to act with a persona like that. “Can you sit?”
“Please, Sherlock,” John pleaded again, progressively turning into more and more of a gorgeous, hot mess.
She could be pretending to be anyone right now. She could pose as a patient and walk into John’s consultation room any day.
Another two hours of googling later, he had learned that Violet’s uncle was terminally ill. And since he never married, his niece was in all probability his only heir.
He vaguely became aware of the presence of more people. They said things that John was too tired to follow. He had no idea who they were talking about, anyway.
She hoped they could repair some of the damage during this visit.
She changed location as often as possible, so that people in the neighbourhood wouldn’t start recognising her, in case anyone came to ask about her.
John lifted his legs and wrapped them around Sherlock’s back. Sherlock, however, appeared startled and pulled back a little. The look on his face was worried, almost alarmed. It hadn’t once occurred to John that Sherlock might not actually want to top at all. Could that be the case?
John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder, letting out a long breath of relief. “Wow,” he sighed. “You probably won’t believe me if I tell you I’ve been wanting to do that for a very long time.”
“No, thanks. I need to think.”
“It has always been you,” John continued, barely keeping his voice from breaking, “even since before I was fully aware of it, and always will be. So I’m going to kiss you now. And if you like it, just copy what I do, alright?”
Sherrinford pointed at Arnold and then stretched both arms forward, making a thumbs-up with one hand and putting his other flat palm underneath, before bringing both hands towards his own chest.
“You. Idiot,” John panted, breaking away only as far as was necessary to look Sherlock in the eye. “But you’re probably right, you know,” he breathed, warm air caressing Sherlock’s lips as Sherlock marvelled at how ridiculously but wonderfully close John’s face now was to his own. “Looks like we can no longer be
feel guilty. Guilty for not knowing, which was technically hardly my fault, I suppose, and neither was it yours for not wanting to tell me, which was perfectly understandable. You had no obligation to tell me, and I don’t blame you for not telling me earlier. So I’ll just have to find a way to get rid of my guilt and you’ll have to find a way to get rid of your lack of self-esteem.”
Sherlock had clearly heard a gunshot, though.
He lingered a few more seconds, then turned and left.
She did not particularly enjoy arriving unannounced, but Sherlock had developed the rather unpleasant habit of disappearing from the flat for scheduled appointments, so she’d given up alerting him to her plans. This had immensely increased the chance of success, as he was generally home anyway (and thankfully didn’t usually have the nerve to leave her on his doorstep).
John hugged Sherlock a fraction tighter, desperately trying not to grind into his thigh. He only wriggled his hips a bit to accommodate his erection, but it woke Sherlock up all the same.
“You can’t stop brooding on Sherrinford, can you,” John said, sympathetically.
Sherlock was squinting against the daylight, his wrists handcuffed together in front of him. He looked like hell. Unshaven, grubby. High.
He swallowed.
Also, the ICU was a busier place than he’d expected, bustling with nurses’ activity and noise throughout the night.
The amount of sarcasm in John’s voice could have frozen over a small tropical country.
“Listen, er…” Sherlock hesitated. “I might actually have told Donovan that you blame me for Mary’s death and want nothing to do with me anymore.”
It was as if they were explorers in an unknown land, mapping each other’s bodies as they journeyed on, as well as newly discovering their own.
“Well, they’re actually...
John soon sensed Sherlock’s nervousness shift into something else: sheer
Time to feed and change Rosie, which John did while Sherlock put up the cot.
“Is that an order?” John asked, his eyes wide.
“Alright.”
Naturally, the letter ‘s’ was still impossible for her to pronounce. And the ‘r’ was rather tricky to get right.
He didn’t really know what he had expected.
While waiting for the kettle to boil, John lit the fire in the living room. It was an exceptionally chilly summer’s day, and John had rightfully guessed that Sherlock reaching for his dressing gown had nothing to do with the latest fashion.
Mycroft briefly closed his eyes.
Unable to decide what to do with the unexpected gift, he’d put it on top of the back rest of the sofa for the time being, from where it was now lovingly staring back at him across the room.
. Or rather, John’s shoulder.
“What’s impossible?” she asked.
It all felt surreal, in a very beautiful way that made John’s chest want to explode.
Eurus sighed, staring at their chest. Flat enough, they supposed, thanks to the new chest binder that had arrived in the post yesterday. Not that anyone would notice, seeing as Eurus didn’t feel like going out in the rain.
John still looked the same. Calm. As if nothing at all was wrong.
He turned to look back into the conference room.
“Da! Da!” Rosie yelled enthusiastically, pointing.
“Look at me. Can’t do it, not now,” Sherlock said. “Not alone.” He looked away and swallowed, his eyes slightly tearful.
Even though Sherlock became rather desensitised after watching their goings on for over two hours – and tossing himself off twice in that time – he continued to watch in order to study positions, angle, rhythm and division of roles.
Sherlock nodded and lowered his eyes. “Yes, of course.”
Sherlock still had three buttons of his shirt to go when John suddenly dropped to his knees and hungrily took Sherlock’s cock in his mouth. This elicited a gasp and then a long, soft moan from Sherlock, his head thrown back in ecstasy and his hands briefly stopping what they were doing.
“Do you know the story of the Appointment in Samarra?” Sherlock asked John, after a few minutes. He’d realised that the thought of it had not been so random after all.
Not even Rose had known the effort Eurus had invested to try to get her back.
He got up to refill his cup.
“I’ll put it quite plainly,” John heard himself say. Here went nothing. “I don’t ever want to be with anyone else anymore. Ever. No matter what. So there. I love you. I love you with every fibre of my soul, Sherlock. I love you so much it hurts. Nevertheless, and precisely because of that, actually, I never ever want to stop loving you and I don’t intend to ever leave you.” John swallowed, fidgeting with his teaspoon on his saucer. “If you are one day actually going to keep bees in bloody Sussex, I still want to be right there next to you, and reminisce about the life we’ve had together as we sit in our little garden. Because I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Sherlock Holmes.” John paused and gently grabbed Sherlock’s hand over the table. “I will follow you wherever you go. That is, if you’ll let me.” They locked eyes. “Please, will you marry me?”
That moment arrived sooner than expected.
He took a deep breath, fixing his attention on the second button from above.
As she continued to stare into the ever-present void that invisibly hovered in her home like a black hole, seemingly sucking in all energy and light, Eurus took her feet off the sofa and reluctantly sat up. She ran her hands through her short, spiky hair, firmly digging her nails into her scalp to distract herself from those thoughts.
Sherlock nodded, although deep down, he felt confused.
Sherlock’s eyes tentatively flashed back towards John, incredulous and earnest-looking.
“So you’re okay? God, please tell me you’re okay.”
“Murder castle, but done right.” Smith looked around briefly. “I have a question for you. Why are you here? It’s like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me. Why?”
“So, ehm… You said Mary was there when you were trying to trace the person smashing the Thatcher busts,” Donovan said, prompting Sherlock to elaborate.
striking name.
“Alright.” John swallowed, not sure what to think. He watched as Sherlock took a tube of lubricant from inside the bedside table and smeared some of it onto his fingers. After stuffing a cushion under his bum with his other hand, Sherlock pulled up his knees, letting his legs fall open, and just like that, started circling his arse with his wet middle finger.
Of course, Greg regularly informed them of the progress on the case from the Yard’s end. He actually worked together quite closely with Mycroft and his team now. But they were only taking baby steps, it seemed. How two teams of professional investigators weren’t able to outwit one capricious woman with a taste for revenge, he would never understand. It was probably just going to be a matter of waiting till she struck again (or until she turned up at an audition for Hamlet) and hoping to catch her then.
On top of which, he was well aware that he wasn’t really that different from Mary, with her clever schemes. John had every reason to shun him. And since Sherlock wanted only the best for John, maybe he should stay out of his way.
“It’s like the gold business, isn’t it?” Sherlock laughed feebly, ostentatiously dabbing his forehead. “Getting more complicated all the time.” His voice slightly started to fade at this. “Well, thanks for the brooch,” he muttered. “I think... bye.”
Even though his ‘affair’ –  if that was even what it was –  had consisted only of texting, it had proven to be a wonderful way of escaping his life with Mary occasionally.
“Well, would you do it if you were me?” Greg looks at him with desperate puppy eyes.
He tried to focus his eyes on the strange, blond man. He did look an awful lot like John. Or had Smith left and was John standing at his bed now?
When Sherlock noticed John, he quickly stood. “Nice shades,” he said.
Once he arrived at the train station, Sherlock walked the by now familiar road to Holdernesse Hall. On the premises, he instantly spotted the contractor and made for his direction. He stood talking to the earl, who was with his back towards Sherlock.
Sherlock jerked awake.
At that, John grabbed the lube from the bedside table and pushed it into Sherlock’s hand, that rested on John’s chest. “Will you fuck me again, but like this?” God, he was already so hard. “Only if you want to, though.”
John raised an eyebrow in response.
But what he wanted, unequivocally, was John.
“Oh yeah, they did. We used to think he wasn’t able to learn. Now I tend to think he just didn’t want to.”
“I did learn
Maybe he should invite Janine, Sherlock mused. Just to hang out, with a real person. She’d never condemned his drug use and was pretty indifferent about it. They tolerated each other rather well, in fact, which was something he appreciated. He supposed she was almost like a sister to him, even though they hadn’t known each other that long (and he’d once tricked her into dating him for the Magnussen case, but never mind that now.)
Sherlock pressed a hand over his mouth and stared blankly ahead.
Sherlock himself had seemed to have disappeared off the grid completely.
He took John’s dog tags from where John had casually dropped them next to the alarm clock, and spun them idly between his fingers. He then spotted John’s broad-striped sweater lying across the chair under the window. He rose to pick it up and pressed it to his face to smell.
When he came back with three filled teacups, Greg cleared his throat. “Well, er, now that I’ve gotten over the initial shock of this unexpected development – well, I say ‘unexpected’ but as I said, we were all really past hope, to be more accurate...” He quickly swallowed away another grin that threatened to take over his face again. “Anyway – I’ve remembered what I came here for.”
The stranger’s gun fell to the floor, unused.
Sherlock frowned even harder, feeling both baffled and happy for Irene at the same time. And impressed, at how well she’d kept all this a secret from him, in spite of their frequent texting. He’d known she’d been seeing a woman at some point, but nothing more. Then again, come to think of it, he’d never asked.
Of course, now that Rose was gone, too, the stakes had been doubled.
There was a bit of fumbling behind him and then John felt the tip of Sherlock’s cock against his arse, ever so gently wriggling around his entrance for a bit, which felt like heaven, until it pressed steadily against the centre, and then effortlessly slid inside.
The touch was electrifying, sending shuddering waves of goose bumps across Sherlock’s body. Sherlock let his head fall back against the door and John took the opportunity to lean in and run his tongue over his neck, eliciting a series of gasps and sighs from Sherlock’s open mouth, which were answered by John’s soft moans of contentment.
. I like to
Both he and John had seen very little of Mary indeed over the past months, which in itself wasn’t a problem, of course. But her way of vanishing without a word, and regularly even leaving the baby home alone, had been taking its toll on John, not to mention Rosie herself, while it somehow hadn’t managed to bring him and John any closer to their goal.
The woman lowered the gun to her side. “Isn’t it obvious?” She stepped forward a few paces, smiling. “Haven’t you guessed?” Her smile dropped. “I’m Eurus.”
* * * * *
Although, of course, the shadows were always dancing around every object, like little monsters. Or big monsters. Or unicorns.
“I was just asking them some perfectly normal questions! Out of
As if he weren’t alone.
Sherlock chose to cut to the chase the minute his best friend stepped into the flat.
John chuckled. “Jesus! A secret brother! What, is he locked up in a tower or something?”
John leaned down to seal the promise with a kiss, gently caressing Sherlock’s tongue with his own in a swirling movement. A wonderful giddiness surged from deep within John’s insides, swelling throughout his body, as it hit him he was only moments away from being
And they didn’t even need to be working together.
Sherlock seemed to think for a minute. “I hadn’t considered that possibility, but I think it’s in fact the most feasible theory, yes.”
“God, Sherlock I don’t know, I’m honestly kind of afraid… you know, of hurting you. I wouldn’t want that.”
Nevertheless, as he sat there between John’s legs, he kept adding more lube over his prick, whether to prepare for the act or to put it off, he didn’t quite know. The same was true for what he did next, after a minute or two. He inserted his fingers into John once more, to make sure he was still open.
Several emotions were battling for the front row seat inside of Sherlock’s mind. Next to the deep sadness over aunt Vivian’s passing and over the way she’d had to spend her last months, there was suddenly outright exultation screaming through his brain.
area, John once more thought back to that very first time in Sherlock’s bed, when Sherlock had taken John to heaven with little touches and ghosts of breaths over his bum. Although one part of him was screaming to explore more of that, something was holding him back, and the fact that he was being held back for no apparent reason, embarrassed him.
He turned to look at her straight-faced. “Seven years.”
He smiled fondly, shaking his head to himself and trying to focus on the shopping list he was compiling.
Well, it was more than that, obviously.
And while Rosie pulled herself up on Harry’s knees and invited herself onto Harry’s lap, Harry told Sherlock and John all about her current life and the improvements in LGBT awareness and acceptance she had already helped achieve. She talked and talked, answering one question after another – more and more posed by John, too – and she felt like for the first time, her brother was actually listening to what she said.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “I guess I was just trying to be nice,” he said quietly, attempting a casual smile.
Mrs Hudson and her sister had come to the opening also, and after standing in front of one particular landscape painting for a long while, pointing and chatting, her sister came up to Sherrinford, smiled, and said very earnestly, “I would very much like to buy that painting over there.”
His mind, however, automatically conjured up an image of John and the state he’d been in on the day they’d first met. John had definitely been contemplating
He ignored her.
The director read out Lord Polonius’s lines to continue the dialogue. “Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love.”
Secondly, Chloe was being very excited while sitting on John’s arm and ‘helping’ with something in the kitchen.
“Because Mrs Hudson’s right. I’m burning up,” Sherlock said, dryly. Then he stood. “But I need you to know, John – I need you to see that up here,” he said, gesturing to his temples with both hands, “... I’ve still got it. So when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered; when I tell you that this… this
“Sherlock.”
From that moment, everything had changed. For both him and Sherlock. John moved back into 221B without a word to Mary. Sherlock had had to stay in hospital for several more weeks, where John came to visit him every single day. Often, he’d even slept there, in Sherlock’s bedside chair.
“Kids will be getting two of their five-a-day before they’ve even left home!” Smith beamed. He led the crowd into the building and stopped to take a notebook from a woman and sign his name in it. “Breakfast has got to be cool,” Smith explained to the reporters continuing to follow him at his heels like he was the Pied Piper of Hamelin. “And you know what makes it cool when you’re a kid?
“She came to see me because she was
you out me to them, when you’ve never even come out yourself?” he growled. “Should I call them right now, and tell them about Marcus? How
No pattern to be seen. Except lots of deaths in his hospital. No surprise there. Who would ever notice an occasional extra death? Brilliant, really.
And seeing as texting with John for
“Oh? And what would that be?” John replied with a hint of curiosity.
When they walked past a door with a window in it, Sherlock glanced towards it, then did a double-take. “No, let’s go in here.” He pulled the door open and went in.
“Well, I finally came to my senses. Not being in a relationship with you was actually more distracting than the alternative. All I had to make sure was whether you could be interested in sex with a man. I wasn’t sure you were.”
John launched himself into the back as soon as the doors were unlocked.
But mostly terrifying. Especially now that habituation had been kicking in, big time. Sherlock’s body simply didn’t seem to agree with
“Brilliant, isn’t it?”
far.)
“Please don’t go away. Please help me.”
From then on, they started calling her Chloe.
After that, I really need a holiday... and guess what, I'm having one right then too! ;D
Sherlock laughed. “That must be it!” Then, fondly grinning, he reached his hand towards John’s across the table and John took it, gently rubbing his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles.
“I made an inexcusable misjudgement in hiring the freelancers that I did. I deleted all the files relating to the incident. Out of
He’d texted her the same afternoon. Men were such pigs. And fools. How could he seriously think she liked him, when she didn’t know him at all?
Sherlock had read several accounts on rimming that had spiked his curiosity and he was now considering whether his inquisitiveness might outweigh his instinctive reluctance and hygiene concerns.
“But of course he wasn’t wearing a blue hoodie then, or trying to conceal himself,” Sherlock stated.
Eurus thought for a bit. She had always wanted to be in the other chair during a psychotherapy session.
“It’s the most logical explanation,” John continued. “He’s probably madly in love with her. On the one hand, he wants to see her and begin a relationship, but on the other hand he does not want her to fall victim to the deal he struck with Jack, and he is sufficiently afraid of his friend not to break the deal. And Bob is determined not to let Jack succeed in seducing her, which is why he follows her to prevent him approaching her.”
He snorted out a laugh at his reflection and started scavenging Hannah’s make-up bag for some dark brown eyeshadow and a brush. Thankfully, after finding some, he soon managed to restore something of a semblance of his usual broad, low eyebrows. They would grow back in a couple of weeks, he told himself.
Just east of Trondheim, there was a little village with a
“So it was Jack, after all?” Violet said.
Then he sent the exact same message from Bob’s account to Violet, also deleting it from his account subsequently.
After a brief glance at the offerings, John turned his head to look up at Sherlock with a blank stare. “What’s this?”
“Sherlock!” Greg yelled. “You okay?”
John felt his heart swell. God, how he’d longed for them to finally be together. Even though they already kind of had been, in so many ways but one.
Sherlock swallowed and looked towards him.
Though he was still a beginner in this field, of course.
“When she came here, I dropped a GPS tracker in her pocket. Inspired by a certain friend of mine.” He gave John a meaningful smirk. “Lestrade’s team found the trousers with the tracker in an inhabited corner of an abandoned building in Clapham.”
pretend not to notice you.”
Good god, was this soldier fellow an enthusiast for this. What he was doing looked so...
If only Sherlock had the guts to tell John to go right now, and save himself the excruciating ordeal of seeing their love transform into complete indifference.
Sherlock was vaguely aware of the importance of saying ‘no’. Wasn’t this being recorded, somehow? He couldn’t remember. But it had something to do with Lestrade needing an incentive to investigate the beloved celebrity, so that he would finally be convicted for all the murders he committed. Even though in this case, one might argue it was actually suicide, Sherlock figured, nebulously. But no one needed to know that. “No,” he said.
That made a few people chuckle, after which everyone went back to their own conversations.
“Yeah, which then increasingly turned into personal banter, from where one thing led to another. She was suddenly just… very open, it seemed. No longer as ridiculously shy as she always used to be.”
This was interesting.
“Yes, just brill. You?” Sherlock smiles at him, as if nothing is out of the ordinary. Casually and relaxed, he finishes his glass in one go and puts it down.
John watched Sherlock as he sat completely motionless, lost in thought, the light of the flames dancing over his face. John’s eyes lingered on the soft shadow under the curve of Sherlock’s jaw, below his ear, where marble skin subsided into the shaded smoothness of skin pulled taut over the tendon of his slender neck.
“Heard you the first time,” Sherlock smiled.
He carefully added the right amount of formula to the warm water and watched Rosie happily beating her rattle on the floor as he stirred the milk for her.
“Yes, I really do,” Sherlock said, truthfully.
* * * * *
of me! The
“Do you promise?” she asked hopefully, practically beaming.
“It will pass, I promise. But yeah, Sherlock undeniably has a magic touch with her. You definitely chose the right bloke.” She winked.
Until one day, Jim read about him in the papers. Holmes had turned out to have specialised in exactly the same thing as Jim had, albeit from two different ends of the periscope. And so Jim had finally found an interesting opponent to test his strengths against whenever there was a lull in his other projects.
It was clear that he had enjoyed the film, though. John had always liked this sort of thing, endlessly going on about The Exorcist, The Omen, Shutter Island and the like, even though it was beyond Sherlock why, indeed. But he suddenly wanted to tell John he would watch the entire film with him, regardless. Just like they’d watched James Bond together – one of Sherlock’s fondest memories, with John giggling at every bit of Sherlock’s elaborate criticism of the extremely unrealistic storylines.
“Must be something comforting about the number three,” Sherlock said, pensively. “People always give up after three.” He raised his eyes to Smith, who stared back at him in horror. Sherlock’s gaze moved across to John, giving him a meaningful look.
, for fuck’s sake, and he would not readily forgive himself for putting Sherlock’s health at risk. At least he finally understood the spur-of-the-moment thing.
Instead, he carefully took his hand in his, and held it for a long time, as they sat together, next to the table full of drawings.
John had the distinct feeling he was missing something.
“Ultimately,” Sherlock went on, as he and Smith kept their eyes locked on each other, “for full satisfaction, it requires...
When Rosie was asleep, or was being entertained or taken care of by Sherlock, Hannah would sit at the little desk in John’s old room upstairs (which she now shared with Rosie), or at the desk in the lounge, in front of the window – with the net curtains always closed, of course. There, she would read novels in Russian, a dictionary at her side.
“Excellent plan.”
having the both of them around, believe it or not. To be quite honest, I’d never have predicted them getting along so well with Irene.”
Sherlock loved the way Rosie’s eyebrows repeatedly travelled up and down in the process.
On the day of the baptism, he had been feverishly trying to solve a particularly ugly armed jewellery robbery in Colchester. It seemed she had been becoming more and more versatile of late. It didn’t even seem to be just about the money, although that was probably still her prime motivational factor – even when Magnussen was no longer there to extort any payments from her. Her other ‘drive’ was the one thing she and John had in common: they were both adrenaline junkies. But each in a vastly different way. He liked to help eliminate trouble, while she liked to create it.
control. He loved the way Sherlock took care of him during sex and afterwards. That was, if he didn’t just fall asleep on top of him; and when he did, John loved that too.
Oh, of course. Dammit. Sherlock had made it look so easy, but the git had probably trained his damn sphincter or something. In fact, come to think of it, he had literally said he had practised, that first time when he’d shown John the dildo.
Mrs Hudson was helping distribute the drinks as a rather transparent excuse to have little conversations with everyone in the room, which, however, was a method Sherlock decided to copy as it was in fact quite a convenient approach which ensured he didn’t have to talk with anyone for too long, while still being considered sociable.
The next time Sherlock was in Wantage for their BSL lesson, Sherrinford signed, “I want to show my paintings to more people. In an art gallery. Take them out of storage. How to arrange?”
Earlier this evening, he’d followed the blond student with his sporty, compact build to a pub a few blocks from the campus and had chosen a moment when John was tipsy enough to take a flirtatious, young stranger back to his room with him.
Sherlock huffed out a relieved breath, trying not to smile too obviously. The beating hadn’t been real, then. Just the coke messing with his head.
Excellent diction, superb intonation. Definitely, beyond any doubt, the best Ophelia yet.
He stretched and turned back to his side.
“Hello. I’m Faith Smith, daughter of Culverton Smith,” she said, timidly. “You might have heard of him. He’s on the telly a lot.”
Sherlock mirrored him, and they just stroked one another for some time, occasionally planting lazy kisses on the other’s neck or shoulder.
Sherlock swallowed away the lump in his throat. He could feel tears slowly running down his cheeks as he looked at his brother. He wanted to hug him, hold a metaphorical umbrella over him to protect him from the outside world.
“Oh, I can go anywhere I like.” Smith took a ring with keys from his trouser pocket, held them up and shook them noisily. “Anywhere at all.”
“Yes, of course Rosie is learning it as well,” Sherlock said. “At this age, they copy everything they observe. The only reason she’s not speaking with sounds yet is that at nine months, her vocal chords have not yet developed sufficiently. But her hands have.”
John pulled off, confused.
John didn’t know how Sherlock selected which tree, wall, or rock to investigate up close. But they definitely weren’t random choices. He could practically hear the cogwheels turning inside the detective’s head, measuring the probability of all sorts of variables against each other with the knowledge he had of these two delinquents, their dispositions and their previous
Within seconds, his cock was hard again, eager to repeat the exercise.
“He’s never given away a painting before,” Mycroft said. “To anyone. And of Redbeard, no less. Interesting.”
Sherlock smiled faintly, blinking repeatedly. “So you think that there actually is a chance,” he said, hesitantly, “that when we’re old and wrinkly,” – he briefly made a face at the idea of ever reaching this state – “we’ll still be together, like this, as a couple, I mean?”
“I should probably, um, stow this thing away somewhere secure,” Sherlock said, “before I drop it, or something.”
Both of them came three times that day.
“Not really. He probably doesn’t even know who I am anymore.”
He remembered, as if it were yesterday, the night he’d sat at Sherlock’s hospital bed after Leinster Gardens, waiting for Sherlock to wake up. From one day to the next, he’d found out that his wife was a freelance assassin who worked for the highest bidder, acting contrary to everything he stood for. And on top of that, it had turned out that she had been the one who’d made him fear for Sherlock’s life once more, just a few days earlier.
Greg could suddenly place the desperate tone in quite a different context. Well, maybe the two were related, who knew. For a brief second, the thought crossed his mind that Sherlock probably pretty much deserved to be bent over like this by John, after having driven him up the walls like Greg knew he could. Then again, Sherlock definitely seemed to be enjoying this, judging by the expression of utter bliss on his face: his eyes closed, eye-brows high on his forehead, mouth half-open in a lazy smile, slack with pleasure – as Greg had never imagined possible between that set of cheekbones. Sherlock’s eager arse was sticking high up in the air for John to take (which he did with rather a large amount of enthusiasm indeed, Greg observed almost amusedly).
tears over this. And the way his fist clenched at his side. Both of those things had been a bit of a shock to Sherlock, but one that frankly made him feel less silly about the whole thing, which was nice.
“I’m a doctor,” John stated firmly.
“Ambulance needed. 46 Windsor Drive. Somebody’s been shot.”
Ella looked understanding and smiled a professional, sad smile. “You love him, don’t you?”
“Oh, that.” John raised his eyebrows. “It’s just a far-fetched horror film with impressive special effects and a mildly interesting storyline.” A faint smile appeared on his face for a moment. “About a girl with supernatural powers who was killed at the bottom of a well, but nevertheless continued to terrorise everyone, via television screens. Her name is Samara.” He cleared his throat awkwardly.
Immediately after that thought had occurred to him, a cat strolled across the room and went to sit at Sherrinford’s feet. When John looked around to see where the feline had come from, he spotted another pair of little, pointy ears perking up from behind a stack of paintings. Ironically, the canvas at the front of that very stack was a portrait of two cats, he then noticed.
“Have you talked about this with Sherlock?” she asked.
He sat cross-legged on the floor in the middle of the living room and closed his eyes. He casually strolled through the corridors of his Mind Palace, not sure where he was heading. He stayed away from John’s Wing though, where he’d spent too much time already in the past days. Instead, he opened a door he couldn’t remember being there before.
“Is this still okay?” he whispered.
“Certainly, sir. If you’d follow me.”
. And he found Sherlock was a quick study. Before long, their tongues, lips and noses were entangled in a wild dance, which turned out to be the one language in which they could finally declare their love.
John bit the inside of his cheeks. “Well observed,” he signed. “Name reminds us of not nice person.”
,” he whispered back loudly. “Besides, how would me blaming you even make
* * * * *
“Yeah!” She scribbled the number of her latest burner phone onto a piece of paper she’d had ready for him.
John closed his eyes tightly and let his head fall back onto his pillow. A dull thunder rumbled and lightning flashed inside his skull, but it was all fine.
He considered this scenario and its implications for a moment.
He fell back against the mattress and revelled in the prospect of an entire Saturday with John, and no plans other than a fancy dinner date tonight.
This did not bode well.
They’d just come back from visiting Sherlock in the hospital, second day in a row. Tomorrow, Monday, John would go again, straight after work. Aunt Vivian would understand if he skipped one visit with her.
“Thank you. Cheers.”
John noticed Sherlock suddenly looked slightly out of breath, even though he had not exerted himself at all. His nostrils were wide and patches of his neck had flushed red.
“How do you mean, what to do? Storage, of course. Mycroft arranges.”
to before. It was just one of those things that he’d sometimes asked himself while undergoing it: what it would feel like to be the active participant.
The kettle had just boiled.
While John continued nuzzling Sherlock’s neck, he slowly began to move his hips, subtly grinding them down onto Sherlock. He was not pushing, not asking anything, just languidly moving like the surf of the sea. It made Sherlock feel desired in a way he never had before. After a minute, he tentatively bucked back up against him, softly gasping at the sensation. This apparently encouraged John to grind down harder and the noises he was now making indicated he was slowly becoming desperate for more. His brows were furrowed and there was a tension in his muscles that betrayed the fact that he was struggling to remain in charge of his own body.
John froze.
John was apparently having similar thoughts, as he suddenly said, “So what was it that prevented us from telling each other how we felt?”
And after another pause, “Well, except maybe things like attending social occasions you’d rather not go to, in which case I will simply drag you there by your ears.”
“I wanted to hear your confession,” Sherlock said calmly. “Needed to know I was right.”
Maybe he should try it too, Sherlock thought to himself, mockingly. Alternatively, he could just stop caring so bloody much.
He’d always loved it when John thought he was brilliant, but now that Sherlock knew how deep those feelings truly ran, it elicited a more profound response in him as well.
Light and heavy at the same time.
John felt a little uneasy as well. Usually, he’d feel confident that, if it were necessary, the two of them could easily overpower an aggressive lunatic. But John was still a patient recovering from a serious head injury, who couldn’t even walk or stand for more than two minutes without his cane.
He briefly pictured himself in a ballet class surrounded by little girls in tutus.
Once they were in one, they both stared intently out their own window, afraid of what might happen if they so much as looked at each other.
Not to mention the fact that his and John’s acting on their eventual realisation that they
John goes silent, and swallows. “Seriously, Sherlock…” he mumbles, but he doesn’t do anything to stop him, unable to move a muscle. His hands seem glued to the worktop on either side of his hips. Sherlock just keeps blandly looking up at him as he fishes the condom John had hoped to put to use tonight from John’s left trouser pocket. How in the devil’s name Sherlock even knew it was there John doesn’t ask.
“Nope.”
Then, without warning, John suddenly blinked his eyes open in the semi-darkness, finding Sherlock staring at him. “Have you been up all night just staring at me?” he asked sleepily.
“Oh yes, very nice indeed. I definitely like the sound of it,” Sherlock smiled, all innocence.
, if she got in touch out of the blue like that. I never knew when his birthday was, but that’s how I deduced it.” As he said it, John realised he still didn’t know. He would ask him this evening, as soon as he got home.
John’s eyes shot back to the man sitting in the other chair. He was no longer peering at him with the intensity of a few moments ago, but was sitting back in his chair with an open expression.
Sherlock looked strangely melancholy while he scratched the dog behind its ear and talked to it in a soothing voice.
John looked towards the open laptop which still showed the article he had been looking at earlier. “Er, well, yes.”
Sherlock genuinely thought he couldn’t take it any longer. He had been half-hard the entire morning. Now he was rock-hard.
“Uneventful,” Sherlock said with a tentative smile, briefly carding his fingers through John’s soft hair. He loved it when John asked about his day, even if nothing at all interesting had happened. “I missed you,” he said, tugging at the hem of John’s coat to persuade him to sit down next to him.
John was quite sure his life couldn’t get any better than this. He was in heaven.
Very clever of Arnold, Sherlock realised, to first show Sherrinford what goal they were heading to and what the possibilities of sign language were. That way, he would understand it was not just Arnold teaching him some personal communication method he had invented himself, but that there was a world out there where this was actually used. (Which Sherrinford naturally had no way of knowing.)
John quietly chuckled to himself when he realised he was practically dancing his way to Marylebone tube station that morning, and he couldn’t help but smile at all the grumpy faces of the people around him.
He’d made it.
I'm hoping to post the final chapter this Thursday at the latest (but of course I'm actually secretly aiming for finishing before the end of year, which would at least mean I wrote and finished the whole damn thing within 2014. :D But I don't want to make risky promises, LOL.)
John’s breath caught in his throat. The sight of this was... intoxicating.
Sherlock looked at him, thunderstruck, but gently shook his head.
“When have I ever been that?” Sherlock retorted.
“Yes, well, seeing as you’re, you know…”
“Forever? Till death do us part?” Sherlock said, breathlessly.
“Yeah, well…” Sherlock blushed, unsure what to say.
He remembered their little adventure with the Trepoff murder and the seven clocks that he’d never posted about. Could be interesting, after all.
Towards the end of the afternoon, when they were lazily lying on the sofa, limbs intertwined, John furtively crawled down and hooked his fingers in the waistband of Sherlock’s pyjama trousers again. Sherlock became hard within seconds, catching his breath when he felt John’s fingers on his bare hips, pulling down his pants. Without further ado, John took Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and, using his already expanding array of creative tongue techniques, soon made him come, grunting and screaming as dazzling fireworks went off in his head once more.
(He’d had no idea about his mum stealing other people’s academic research, and wasn’t sure what to think now. But that could wait.)
“Well, it seems fairly obvious that, at least initially, once one of them had discovered that their boss’s lovely young niece in the UK was going to inherit his fortune in the not so distant future, the plan arose to try and marry her for the money. Perhaps they were both in on it, perhaps not. If it was single-handedly Bob’s idea, it would make sense that he’d start dating her, but not that he lost interest while at the same time still following her around. If it was Jack’s idea, the coming on to her makes sense, as does Bob’s following her assuming that he wants to shield her from him once he’s found out what his mate is up to. But in that case, he could also just tell her. And since he is the one who made contact with her in the first place, he can’t be that innocent. Another option is that they are in this together, thereby increasing the chance that one of them will succeed in winning her heart. They might have agreed to split the profit if it works.”
Her period had come early.
John frowned. He’d heard someone say that before. Sherlock? But when?
Insane stuff.
An ambulance was parked in the driveway of the house opposite. A paramedic was opening the rear doors.
Sherlock, meanwhile, remains completely serious. “I could give you one, if you promise never to complain about the state of the kitchen table ever again, in which case, I will give you a blowjob, right here, right now.”
Sherlock gazed towards the floor. “
, you know? I’m not forcing you to. It’s perfectly understandable that you wouldn’t want someone damaged like me.” Sherlock did not feel bitterness. It was a simple fact that John deserved so much better than such an imperfect relationship.
“Yes...” She frowned.
It was a strange sort of activity, awkward in many ways, but he’d decided he liked the result. He’d already begun improving his technique during a second round this morning, with satisfactory enough outcome.
John was content like this, living with Sherlock, no women in his life other than his daughter.
A waiter came and took their meal orders, which involved more signing at the junior end of the table, and more staring at them from the other end.
She was not departing with Rose. She was being forced to relinquish her to Holmes’s friend, just because Rose (like Jim) thought there was some point in that. (And the plain fact was, Rose was probably in love with both of them, Eurus thought. That was, if she was even in love at all.)
John was single again.
John followed soon after, Sherlock’s tightness becoming too much for him, as he grunted even less eloquently and a series of random noises escaped his throat, moments before collapsing on top of Sherlock in a messy heap of sweat and utter contentment.
After staring at each other for a few moments, Sherlock put his arms around Mycroft, and Mycroft let him.
Then Sherrinford got up and carefully reached behind a stack in the corner, picking up a canvas that Sherlock recognised as the African landscape painting that he’d been working on last time. But in this finished version, there was a person in the picture, kneeling down to study unseen bugs on the bark of a dead tree. Dark curls partly obscured the young man’s face, but nevertheless Sherlock almost instantly realised, with a shock, that it was meant to be a teenaged version of himself.
Sherlock had opened his eyes again, and his heart shrank as he saw John standing there, staring at him with glistening eyes. John’s face was all tense and the muscles around his jaw were doing their John’s-jaw-thing, hollowing his cheeks slightly. His nostrils flared open. While he locked his wide-eyed gaze on Sherlock, he was blinking hard and seemed to try to form words, which took a while before succeeding.
“How did you get in?” Sherlock asked, his voice no more than a faint whisper.
His therapist smiled. “We spent a night together.”
“I never thought I’d ever be this happy,” John said, his voice catching in his throat. “And it has nothing to do with a sodding pearl.”
Sherlock Holmes was already equipped with an IV line. Changing the drip itself was easy.
He sat up a little, resting on one elbow.
There was one of a horse galloping through glistening snow, one of the building they were in, with the trees casting spotty shadows on the lawn in different shades of green, one of a vase with wilted flowers, and several very realistic portraits of people, among which John spotted an astoundingly truthful younger version of Sherlock’s mother.
“You know, dear brother,” Mycroft said, signing along so Sherrinford could also understand, “this really makes you and John a proper family now: having a kid and a dog. Couldn’t get more domestic than that. I’d honestly never taken you for the type.”
He swallowed.
Smith turned and walked back to the window. “Have what back?”
“What I don’t get, though, is why she targeted
He took a step back from the worktop. “Obviously, I am,” he added, his eyes fluttering all over the kitchen cupboards as he spoke, as if he were merely saying he couldn’t remember where he’d put the salt.
“Yes, I’m here. Don’t worry,” Sherlock said softly.
“For god’s sake, I don’t care who did it. Can’t you see I’m busy?”
With his blue dress casually brushing against his now bare thighs – a strange, unfamiliar sensation – he crawled back to the spot between Sherlock’s legs. He bent down and licked a long stripe over the length of Sherlock’s cock, making him suck in a long breath through his teeth. Then he paused, looking up at Sherlock to increase suspense. His lover was now practically trembling with anticipation. John smiled, thinking about the best strategy to make this last. He then firmly gripped the base of Sherlock’s cock between a circle of two fingers and started slowly swirling his tongue around Sherlock’s glans.
He then abruptly shoved his chair backwards, stood up, and skittishly looked around the kitchen seemingly randomly.
Hands putting down a stretcher beside John.
His hips pushed forward again and again and again, chasing the familiar bliss that presented itself in such an unfamiliar setting.
“Yes,” John managed briskly.
“God save the Queen!” Smith said, a little louder, looking round at the kids. “She could open a slaughterhouse and we’d all probably pay the entrance fee!”
It was not just the dress, though. Even as Sherlock was still in the process of putting it on, something decidedly feminine had come over him: the graceful way he carried himself, how he elegantly moved his fingers, the manner in which he coyly tilted his head to check the mirror. It had made John’s mouth go dry and he cleared his throat – for the third time now. The tiniest hint of a smile played around Sherlock’s lips as he casually glanced at John in the reflection. John hid his lips to quench a grin. Sherlock, apparently, found this a reason to turn his head and slowly bat his eyelashes at John over the edge of one slightly raised shoulder, as he almost unnoticeably stuck out his bottom and let his hands dangle loosely from his wrists.
Sherlock whispered, “I’m so afraid to do it wrong. Please tell me if I’m doing it wrong.”
“Have you recently ended a relationship?”
Crap. John has no idea what they are talking about. “Well,” he starts, “you
“No, I understand; but where did you come from? Where did the plane take off?”
The bastard.
First touch of brush, mix. New purple, with pretty patterns.
John seemed to suppress a wet sort of snigger, looking Sherlock up and down.
Somehow this was harder than he’d anticipated. Bugger, why could he not do this without stammering?
But Sherlock had one more plan up his sleeve to even further increase the chance of successfully getting rid of Jack, which was, after all, Violet’s primary concern.
When Sherlock pulled back to look at him, John instantly lost himself in those eyes, the most beautiful eyes in the world, that were now gazing at him with such intense relief that John’s insides melted on the spot. He was going to marry this man, even if it was the scariest thing he’d ever done. He gently ran his fingers down Sherlock’s shoulder. “And I’m not even asking you to divorce your work first,” he grinned tentatively, “as I think you will manage perfectly fine being married to both of us at the same time.”
A vague smile was mirrored back at him. That was at least something.
“Yeah, well, either way, that doesn’t make a lot of difference for the point I was trying to make, does it?”
done it.
“Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern,” Mycroft said sternly. “The fact that I’m his brother changes absolutely nothing. It didn’t the last time and I assure you it won’t with...” At that, he seemed to stop himself and paused for a long moment.
A few moments later, Smith led Sherlock and John along an empty, bright white-painted corridor, leaving everybody else behind them in the ward.
Inside, Tony greeted him with a casual peck on the lips. “All done?”
Grinding his teeth, unsure whether to be angry or impressed, he put them in his own pockets. “Ooh, you’re a clever little bastard, aren’t you? You had this whole thing
All in all, better safe than sorry, Sherlock concluded, by the time he’d reached his front door.
Now, her version of the truth turned out to be quite different.
John had done this to him, for him.
Instead, they went into the nearest corner shop and bought John a can of beer.
John looked very much uncomfortable and stepped towards Sherlock, saying his name, as if asking what was going on.
John, making love to him because he’d asked him to.
In response, John grinned and said, “Well, let’s generate some more good luck, then,” leisurely tackling Sherlock onto the bed and diving on top of him. In one smooth movement, he playfully pinned down Sherlock’s arms next to his head onto the mattress and casually nuzzled his neck.
Since he wasn’t meant to exert himself, Sherlock carefully helped him up the stairs, reminding him repeatedly to take it easy while he supported him.
* * * * *
His thoughts strayed back to that cosy evening only three nights previously, and his alcohol-induced remark that might have inadvertently – but thankfully – set things into motion.
Sherlock cleared his throat, schooling his face into a solemn look. “John, will you go out on a date with me?”
Of course, this was a foolish thing to do. Never let your guard down. Not ever. Especially not when you’ve got a priceless pearl hidden in your coat and a bag sitting next to you with two illegal, fake passports that were essential evidence for the police forces of several different countries.
(There was indeed very little doubt in John’s mind by now that Sherlock’s unofficial diagnosis of her was correct.)
John cleared his throat. “Listen. In the first place: I’m not
Sherlock, however, had turned noticeably more quiet and withdrawn. Even though his mother had meant no harm, and Sherlock knew she couldn’t help it, her words had clearly still affected him. He took it with admirable dignity, John thought, showing his hurt only by his lesser engagement in the conversation, still managing to smile occasionally at the puns his father made. But he seemed wary, cautious, somehow. And John couldn’t blame him. The glimpse he had gotten that afternoon of how hard it must have been for Sherlock and his brothers growing up with their mother’s lack of perceptiveness only increased John’s sympathy for them. Sherlock had been enduring a lot to continue to be compassionate for his mother, John now understood.
“You know what,” Sherlock whispered, “if you try on the dress like a good boy, I will suck you off as soon as we get home.”
-- Okay. S
Sherlock turned his head slightly; he was still by no means actually looking at her, but at least she could see his profile.
A straightjacket. A needle in his arm, draining away the will to fight.
One spring afternoon, two weeks into their relationship, when John had had an early shift, they were doing just that when they heard a brusque knock on the door. Since Sherlock had instructed Mrs Hudson not to let in any clients, with this narrowed-down choice it was quite easy even for John to deduce it must be Lestrade.
Sex was turning out to be a much more varied and fascinating activity than he had anticipated, and nothing like the mindless routine he had always assumed it to be.
Mrs Hudson would be away visiting her sister anyway, so they didn’t have to feel guilty about not inviting her.
‘LA POLIZIA INGLESE ANCORA SCONCERTATA DALLA SPECIALE PERDUTA’
. He just talked and talked, to anyone who would listen – and most wouldn’t, you know, he was a right bore. But I did find some merit in his ideas, and repeatedly told him he should publish them. He never did, though. But, naturally, they influenced my research ideas and my own hypotheses. When I started writing my book, I did refer to his ideas several times, and discussed their relevance in my own field, and even credited him, mind, despite the fact that I wasn’t strictly obliged to. For a large part, I actually ended up disproving his theories, by the way. But as you know, disproving a theory in science is just as valid and valuable as proving one. More often than not, in those cases where I did prove one, I only could because I added essential elements to them that he had omitted.” She walked over to the oven to check if the cake was rising properly, and then contentedly sat back down at the table. “Of course, when he heard that I’d written and published a book, while he still hadn’t managed to publish hardly any of his own work, he was furious. Men can be so competitive. Whatever happened to being happy for someone else’s achievements? They were all my own.”
At the same time, John couldn’t quite push away the doubts emerging in his thoughts – like little poisonous gas bubbles in a lake – about whether this was going to last. With Sherlock, you never knew how long something new was going to hold his attention; not to mention that John was wondering whether it would even be possible at all to have a serious relationship with a self-proclaimed sociopath. John had had so many relationships crash and burn for lesser reasons. Until yesterday, he hadn’t actually thought Sherlock capable of romantic feelings and although he had been proven wrong, it remained to be seen exactly to what extent Sherlock would be able – and happy – to maintain an actual relationship.
Sherlock took a few sips of wine and John did the same. He realised he hadn’t seen Sherlock this relaxed in a while. Then again, there had always been things on his mind when they met lately – usually a case – and other people around.
When his jaw muscles started to tense up, Sherlock sat up between John’s thighs. John was hiding his face under one arm but sneaked a peek at him with one eye. He looked shy and a total mess and it was the most beautiful thing Sherlock had ever seen in the world.
Sherlock was in fact much needier than John had ever expected, and much more physical as well – once he’d gotten past his initial inhibitions. His advances sometimes practically bordered on sluttish behaviour, which made John smile inwardly. (He definitely wasn’t complaining.)
Sherlock swallowed.
At least for a few more sessions.
John smirked back at him. “Alright. Just for fun. I reckon we deserve some.”
“Would you like to go?”
And she had not remained unnoticed.
Rose hadn’t looked surprised when she found Eurus on her doorstep, and, after fondly rolling her eyes, she’d let her in. “I guess it doesn’t matter anymore,” she’d said, rather indifferently.
, was all he could think, gritting his teeth. He quickly made for the door, feeling relieved when it fell shut behind them, until it occurred to him that Sherlock would likely only get even more of this kind of attention inside, from men who were mostly actually into men, which made it worse. Although part of him wanted to show off his amazing, brilliant boyfriend to anybody in range, another part of him wanted to shield Sherlock from the world and have him only to himself; for no one else to see his beauty, ever –
“Well, let’s see, shall we?” Keeping his eyes fixed on Smith, Sherlock raised his voice and called over his shoulder towards the doors, “Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in! This is your father’s
One of the things was that Sherlock seemed to have no shame. John had always known that, of course, but it had acquired a whole new dimension with the changed nature of their relationship. Sherlock would simply drop to his knees in front of John in the middle of the kitchen or living room and unfasten John’s trousers, regardless of whether the curtains were open or closed. Thank god the flat wasn’t on the ground floor.
Sherlock briefly pressed his lips together. “Yes, that’s what I thought, too. But it was the memory stick.”
The dog wisely scurried off anyway.
“Sorry,” John said apologetically, “but you were kind of squishing my bollocks.”
John forgot to breathe for a few moments and looked at Sherlock with what he hoped was not too much eagerness.
Of all things, he foolishly hadn’t expected her to have a sodding illegal fire arm.
“Good.”
He didn’t know which had been the most unexpected. What Eurus had done had, in fact, been no surprise whatsoever. It was exactly the reason why Irene lived with them. And she’d handled the situation brilliantly.
know there’s a bit more to it than that.”
Their eyes met for a brief moment, and John quickly mirrored Sherlock’s ‘It’s Christmas’ expression.
Grimacing, Sherlock slumped into another chair, beside the table. “I’m a mess; I’m in hell,” he continued, more quietly. “But I am not wrong.” He pointed to Smith’s photo on the laptop. “Not about him.”
Sherlock shifted his eyes to the picture nearest to him, labelled ‘Nathan Garrideb’. “Glasses, glasses,” he muttered. He took in a long breath. “Nathan wears glasses. Evans was shot from three hundred metres. Kickback from a gun with this calibre... would be massive. No cuts, no scarring. Not Nathan, then. So it’s got to be one of the other two.”
Greg’s resolute tone of voice almost startled John. “No,” he repeated, in a much lower, but still very insistent voice. “That will only make things worse. We’ll see this through to the end. It will be alright. I pray to God, at least, that it will be.”
none of it mattered, as she likely wouldn’t even come.
Instantly, she reached to a nearby table and turned back aiming a pistol at him.
Everything had fallen into place, finally.
“Most certainly is. What I wouldn’t give to live in a place like this myself,” he laughed, slowing down and turning around to face them properly. “A piece of heaven on earth, that’s what it is.” The man’s tanned and very muscular arms glistened with an invisible layer of sweat.
When the noises started to die down, he got out of bed and sauntered into the kitchen.
Thank you all for reading and commenting. :)
“18.95.”
He pinched the bridge of his nose. Hard.
He squeezed his eyes closed.
“No, no, it’s fine,” John smiled reassuringly. “It’s just… still a bit of an unfamiliar sensation to me, is all.” With Sherlock between his legs like this and the electricity just now provoked by such a subtle touch in
Unwilling to let go of her, he kept stroking her beautifully soft, pitch black fur. After a while, he walked over to his chair and sat down with the puppy in his lap.
Although instead of listening and talking he would have to find another way… Somehow.
John laughed.
“Oh!” There was a short silence. “Yes, of course. I’m so glad I hired you, Mr Holmes. Thank you for everything that you’re doing to try and trace my Arthur.” His voice sounded strangled as he mentioned his son. “See you in the morning then. Around half nine?”
An awkward silence descended upon the room.
“Do you want me to take you home?” John asked. “Where do you live?”
“An act of hate against cross-dressers,” Sherlock said. “Of course I did consider that, as soon as we found out that he’d been one. But that doesn’t seem highly probable, seeing as he wasn’t dressed as a woman at his time of death and also the killer didn’t leave any hints as to such a motive, which they usually do in those kind of cases. Often quite explicitly.” His gaze drifted off as he stared out of the cab window and they didn’t speak again during the rest of the ride.
and on the brink of losing control. It was a somewhat worrying but beautiful sight and it made Sherlock want to get to know more of this side of him that was now meant only for him.
“In spite of your insecurities about not living up to people’s expectations, you seem so much better, John.”
-- Everything alright? Do you need anything else? S
(Also, John had learnt that orgasms were ten times as intense with something up your arse, no matter which stimulus triggered them.)
But, sitting at John’s bed, next to the machines that were now in charge of his life, Sherlock made a decision.
EDIT: Crap, I've just realised that all the image links have changed and the illustrations have therefore become invisible on this website. I might fix them later, but for now, know that whenever it says "sherlockedart" in the middle of a sentence, that's a link to the image that was supposed to be in that spot! :D
They stared at each other intently for a second, until Sherlock’s gaze drifted off, confused.
A female officer kneeled down next to little Arthur, asking him if he was okay. The boy nodded, holding on tightly to his dad.
John was tired. He closed his eyes again.
Thankfully, she calmed down a little already during the process, but especially once it was ready and he started feeding it to her.
“To be fair, they almost had her a few days ago,” Sherlock said.
The insufferable twat.
When John opened his eyes once again, Sherlock was still by his side, sitting in a chair next to his hospital bed. Just like the previous couple of times. Always there.
Two pairs of eyes briefly flashed in her direction. Then chins were quickly pressed to chests, pointedly avoiding eye contact, and a subdued “Oh, god” could be heard coming from behind Sherlock.
But despite her erratic bluntness, it was very clear to John that she had no bad intentions whatsoever, and the fact that she was completely unaware of the effect of her unfortunate remarks on the people around her meant that the atmosphere almost instantly improved immensely as soon as John had successfully managed to steer the conversation away from personal matters.
“So you’ve been practicing, huh?”
was interesting. Sherlock made a mental note of bringing in Saheed as a witness when the moment arrived.
“We do,” John confirmed. Still, he knew beyond any doubt that he was in a better place than he’d ever been and he dared say the same thing was true for Sherlock. He and Greg stood there in silence for another bit, until John said, “Sometimes you just won’t understand each other, and maybe on some levels you never will, but that doesn’t mean you can’t love each other and be perfectly happy together.”
He’d never been that fixated on penetration, but for some reason, seeing what Sherlock was doing with that piece of silicone was embarrassingly arousing.
It hadn’t worked, that was for sure.
John let his head fall back, looking at the ceiling for guidance – as if to be reminded which side of the world was up and which was down – and took a couple of deep breaths.
“Don’t get out yet.” Sherlock wriggled his hand between them. “I want to come with you inside me.”
John was, however, for the moment still very much in the same room, namely sitting on Sherlock’s outstretched legs and deliciously nuzzling his lower belly. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock’s cock had become quite hard from all the attention lavished on the area around it. Sherlock heard a low moan escape his own throat. Ever so gently and ever so slowly, John – perfect, perfect John – moved over to the bulge in Sherlock’s pants and lazily ran his cheek and chin alongside it, while his hands kept caressing Sherlock’s hips and flanks. He then softly pressed his lips to where the fabric stretched taut over Sherlock’s cock, reverently taking all the time in the world. As Sherlock imagined the two of them in the pretty tea garden, in the shade of the bird-filled trees, he surrendered to the sensations John was eliciting in him.
He desperately wanted to
“Exactly. No music, then.”
There was a mattress on the floor, a tiny table in the centre and some magazines lying scattered around. Next to a wash basin, there were some tins of food and a camping stove. A box in the corner held some clothes. Among which, one pair of trousers containing the tracker.
“God, I was so scared you weren’t going to wake up anymore,” Sherlock whispered. “I love you so much.”
He’d been such an idiot.
“John, I’ve been meaning to say, I’m so sorry about Mary,” Harry said, “and sorry I--”
They sat in silence for a while.
, of all people…”
Well, eventually he would probably go out again and try to score the occasional shag, but he would leave it at that. No more girlfriends.
Hannah fed, changed, bathed and dressed Rosie, although Sherlock helped more and more often with those things as well. When she was busy with the little one, she’d often sing to her at the same time, which she could do quite beautifully.
Her New Zealand accent had become almost undetectable, Eurus noticed.
“Hmm. We should get dressed.”
John frowned. “Okay.” He carefully retracted his hands.
He felt like having cereal, but naturally, the milk in the fridge (which Mary had bought last week – weird) had gone sour. He briefly considered using formula, but eventually decided to take Rosie outside and visit Tesco’s, as well as get some fresh air. The possibility of meeting acquaintances who would give their sympathy for his loss was a risk he would simply have to take.
Sherlock noticed that Smith paused for a moment, meeting John’s eyes before finishing his sentence.
The wonders of simply
The man howled like a small puppy.

They were very small steps, but if Sherlock wanted to build a proper relationship with his brother, he had to build it slowly.
“John.”
Thanks to my amazing friend and Brit-picker Amber, I managed to in fact have it ready for you before I leave on holiday, yay!! :) :) Thanks again, my lovely friend xxxxx
“We both do,” added her husband a little sheepishly, by way of calming the minds.
After the two drivers had exchanged their own secret codes, it was only a matter of seconds before Molly and Rosie (still asleep) were in the other car, heading back towards the motorway, but now going in the other direction.
THE FINAL CHAPTER, AT LAST! As much as I loved working on this for the past two years and eleven sodding months (which is over three times as long as I thought I would need, aarrgghhh), I’m really glad that this enormous opus and labour of love is now done. :)
But months of shadowing her hadn’t proved nearly as fruitful as they’d hoped.
His inability to communicate hadn’t just been plain stubbornness, then, after all.
But this time, he had to fool a Moriarty. Up close. And the stakes were higher than they had ever been. There was zero room for error.
writing. She wasn’t even sure why or when exactly she’d stopped doing it. Maybe she should check online what those fan communities were like now, she mused. Surely age didn’t really matter?
So when John came in that morning, her smile was a bit wider than it had been of late. “I’ve got something for you,” she said. Her voice sounded strangely raspy and faint even to her own ears. “No, not you, actually,” she corrected herself, speaking more slowly than she intended. “For your little girl. But I’m giving it to you, nevertheless. I wasn’t able to wrap it, so you need to close your eyes.”
They briefly pressed their lips together.
John woke up feeling cold.
He opened his eyes to see the smuggest grin he’d ever seen on Sherlock’s face – which was saying something.
John stepped into the workshop, looking at the gold and silver craftsmanship on display and ignoring the two men, save for a short general nod in their direction.
Although the experiment had been a rather efficient form of distraction, it could never fill the gaping hole that was John’s absence.
she told herself
Sherlock stopped and looked at him, probably checking whether he was taking the piss.
After a while, John added, in a firm voice, “And as much as I love it when you wear lingerie, I am decidedly very much into men, or at least into the particular man I’m holding right now, thank you very much.”
bees. He will probably use this teddy to lecture her silly on the subject,” John said.
Sherlock loved to fantasise about the big moment itself, when he would proudly say ‘I do’ and they would kiss. Maybe people would even cheer, and then they would exchange rings to mark their bond in a forever visible symbol.
“Our parents didn’t invest a lot of energy into raising us, other than arranging access to the best schools and then presumably assuming that the teachers did the rest,” Sherlock went on. “They never bothered to set any social rules beyond table manners to guide our behaviour. Never showed interest in how our day at school had been or discussed with us how we could perhaps try to resolve the everyday conflicts and struggles that children naturally face on a regular basis.” Sherlock sighed. “But Mycroft was more than happy to fill in and teach me the ways of the world. In his own, unique way.” He rolled his eyes. “And on top of all that, he would continuously tell me I should stop being so slow and think faster, be cleverer. For instance, whenever I asked him to play with me, he’d only consent to doing so after I’d have finished reading some voluminous book or, quite often, after an elaborate private lesson in deductions. ‘
God, how in heaven’s name was he ever going to be a satisfactory partner for John?
God no, he couldn’t possibly do that. It would accomplish absolutely nothing.
Sherlock and John’s home very cosy.
Sherlock closed his eyes. He kept seeing jellyfish when he did that, gently floating around, as if nothing had happened. The jellyfish at the Aquarium certainly hadn’t batted an eyelash when Mary (Rosamund) had fallen to the floor bleeding, just outside their tank. Nor had they the moment before, when she had appeared quite literally out of the blue and aimed her gun at Vivian Norbury, who had, of course, been unarmed and innocent of everything to which she was now confessing in another part of the same building.
It was just too much.
But, of course, they soon adapted.
Looking down, he realised his left fist was clenching so hard around the handle of the pram that his knuckles had turned white. He stopped walking and deliberately relaxed his hand, stretched his fingers and took several deep breaths. He then focused on the innocent little creature that was staring up at the sky with her large, beautiful eyes. Whenever he started to feel too sorry for himself, he only needed to look at her, and his own worries faded away. Yes, he had trusted the wrong people in the past, but the main thing was that he should make sure that he would never breach Rosie’s trust as his had been betrayed. He knew what it was to be disrespected and he vowed not to let Rosie ever feel that way.
“Oh! I’m Molly,” she said. “Well, I guess you knew that already, obviously. I mean. Yes. Well.”
He sucked in a breath. “So why did he never learn sign language? I’ve been wondering.”
Wasn’t it weird how a dubious compliment like that made his heart flood with warmth?
John looked at the bruises on Sherlock’s face, at his chest subtly rising and falling with each breath.
“John, he doesn’t
They were going to go in there and choose the rings that would designate them as a couple till death did them part.
John also started towards the door.
“This girl came to me three days ago,” he began, waving his hand in the general direction of her picture – obviously taken through a telephoto lens. She was pretty. “She’s being stalked. I shadowed them and found out it’s the guy she’s recently started dating, heavily disguised. His name is Bob. But weirdly, he’s been acting less and less interested during their dates of late, while she really likes him. Not an obsessive boyfriend then.”
Meanwhile, he was frantically searching for a phone charger in the bag Mycroft had brought him. So far, he’d encountered a toothbrush and toothpaste, among various sets of underwear. As if any of those things mattered. “Yes, hello? Alice?” His voice sounded loud and hollow in the quiet of the room. “Hello. I’m still here. Can you hear me?”
“It doesn’t.”
“I’m not bisexual, John. I’m very much
It all felt a bit surreal.
“Seven years,” she answered, clearly uncomfortable.
* * * * *
Oh God. Sherlock had not hallucinated the woman coming to his flat. The lady standing in front of him was a fraud. Logic dictated that she wasn’t really a therapist either.
A stroke of luck for both parties.
It reminded Mycroft with some nostalgia of the uninhibited, happy child Sherlock had once been.
Before they knew it, they had the thing half figured out, in spite of John’s objections. When Mycroft arrived – clearly just back from Sherrinford, Sherlock noticed – and assessed the whole situation at a glance, he was quick to help them come up with a motive for Vivian in the little AU they’d created. “She wouldn’t be the first one to be overcome by an inclination to murder you over your impudent deductions, you know.”
“So that’s how you stole her heart,” John had said the first time he’d heard her. “You might just as well have become an opera singer.”
“What? What is it?
Meanwhile, the idiot just kept mumbling to himself as he rolled the pearl between his fingers. “This is good though. Better than the Goddess of Tbilisi, definitely. Say good-bye now!”
of Sherlock, as he’d so eloquently put it?
Panicking, he gasped in a breath an instant before Smith laid his right palm over his mouth and pressed down hard. Smith then covered Sherlock’s nose with his other hand. “Murder is a very difficult addiction to manage,” he said, pushing his hands down, as Sherlock writhed under him – oxygen deprivation already starting to gradually kick in. “People don’t realise how much work goes into it. You have to be careful.”
Eurus heaved a shaky sigh, biting back tears as she blindly stared out of the window. The sun had no mercy on her feelings and shone like it was a lovely day.
“You alright?” John asked.
Hannah did stay with them, and thankfully, she and John turned out to get along just fine. (John had been a little wary at first, but Sherlock being
“As you know, it was for a case. My interest in her was entirely… fabricated. As I’ve told you, I-- I apologised to her, profusely, and she forgave me.”
With red-rimmed eyes, Craig forced himself to look up at John. “Steve is the kindest person you’ll ever meet,” he said, slowly. “He is helpful, and understanding, and sweet, and I wouldn’t know who in the world would ever want to do anything to him,
John cursed softly.
fault, now, would it?” There was panic in his eyes.
John let his head hang between his shoulders.
Moreover, he felt like absolute hell, aching all over, nauseous, unable to focus his eyes properly on anything and at the same time, badly in need of a hit. Very badly.
Looking at him uneasily for a moment, Saheed and his colleagues started towards the door. John awkwardly stepped aside to get out of their way.
“I’m not
“Okay. Bedside table?”
He spent the rest of the afternoon looking for a more practically instructive kind of information sources.
