Then they got into the car, gave one last wave and Dean started the engine, his Baby rumbling with excitement he himself felt at the moment. A melody floated from the radio.
Fights like these were something Castiel was still getting used to. When they had fought the first time, in a dingy motel room, Dean had grabbed his coat and walked out. And Castiel vividly remembered the fear he felt, that Dean was done with him, that he wasn't coming back.
“Yes. I mean...listen, Cas. This...”he gestured in between the two of them “is really new to me. I don't know what...how to handle...deal with this kind of thing. Yet.” he said, hoping it made at least a shred of sense. Cas nodded and let go of his hand.
“Oh, yeah, it's great. When we moved here, Benny and I, I didn't even plan to go to college. But it's so much easier, and cheaper than back home, so I thought why the hell not. Folks are nice, too. The food, on the other hand...” he gives him a pointed look and Cas can't help but smile as he raises his hands in defeat.
"The Empty would…it would take him when.. when he experienced a moment of true happiness. " he said finally, his eyes fixed on the empty beer bottle in his hands. Sam exchanged surprised look with Eileen.
Dean smiled. "I believe you. But my offer will always stand for another time - now that I know you won't be afraid to use it and ask me. But right now you look really tired. It’s the end of the week, don’t push yourself too far. Maybe you're... Well, I don't want to impose, maybe you want to go to bed, but... I could take the cookies out of the oven, and then we could watch a movie together, maybe? It'll require less concentration than trying to remember card combinations!"
However, he also knew that he couldn’t keep going like he was, pretending he didn’t care about his asexuality, that he was probably thinking that way because he was too young, or because he never tried or met anyone that was worth it. Now, he knew it wasn’t true: Dean was worth it. If he really had to have sex with someone, he would choose Dean without hesitation. If he was in a relationship with Dean, he could picture sleeping with him, since it was important for Dean. But only in the context of a loving relationship, as an act of love, of intimacy, to feel close to him emotionally and physically. He was a little curious about it as well. It seemed to be such a big deal for other people that he wondered whether it was really
“Your boyfriend?” Balthazar asked suspiciously, looking alternately between Dean and Cas, slowly connecting the dots.
“Perfect, Doctor Sexy binge-watching night it is, then! We can stop at the grocery store on our way so we can buy some snacks and some supplies to make dinner and then go to your place? Balthazar will be at a poker game tonight, and I don’t have a TV in my room, so…”
“Okay, so maybe we could use that time to start working on our next math assignment? The TA said we could work in pairs.”
Cas winced. This was a nightmare. Was he condemned to be stuck next to Dean, listening to him describe how he was having sex with the entire campus, because sex was probably so important for him? The other players seemed to be used to this kind of conversation, and were enthusiastically cheering him on. Cas sighed. If he had to hear another dirty joke, he would be sick.
Dean looked at him straight in the eyes - again! - with a gentle, soothing look and Cas immediately felt reassured. He made a slight, shy smile, and in return, Dean beamed. He could still feel Dean's hand resting on his shoulder, almost burning him, and while a minute earlier his heart had been pounding and his thoughts racing, he felt strangely calm. Tea was not the only relaxing thing here: Dean was far more effective.
Cas paused. He wasn’t looking at Dean anymore, but he wasn’t hiding. He was just too lost in his thoughts to focus on Dean.
“It was just a matter of time. When Cas became human, I assumed the two of you would finally figure out your feelings quicker, actually.”
“I don’t doubt it,” Dean answered, between two bursts of laughter – and if he hadn’t been busy being overly outraged, Cas would have noted that Dean’s laugh was one of the most beautiful sounds he had ever heard.
They sat together at the kitchen table and began to eat in comfortable silence. It was something Cas liked about Balthazar: he didn't feel compelled to make small talk with him.
Cas glanced at the other students who were all looking at him, their faces full of curiosity and expectation. He blushed. That was too much. Coming here was already a big step. Talking about very personal topics in front of fifteen strangers was another step he wasn’t ready to take yet. He shook his head.
“Okay, maybe you want to change your clothes to put on some dry ones? Perhaps take a shower? I can make you some tea, or hot chocolate while you’re using the bathroom. What do you prefer?”
“Oh yes, don’t worry Dean, I might be human now, but I can still defend myself if needed. And Tom wasn’t mean. He wouldn’t have forced me to do anything I didn’t want to.”
“You sound like the Christmas movies Cas has been watching today. Probably where he got the idea of baking cookies in the first place by the way.”
Cas blinked, trying to come to his senses. A very worried Dean was kneeling just in front of him, very close to his face. He raised his hand towards Cas’ head, before stopping his gesture, uncertain. Their eyes met, and Cas got a flashback of their first meeting. Apparently, Dean remembered the same thing. He dropped his hand, smiling shyly.
Cas didn’t answer straight away. Saying he wasn’t relaxed was an understatement. He had woken up and had immediately had an anxiety crisis, then had gone to a very important meeting where he had made decisions that would affect his entire university year, and now he was going to drink a coffee with Dean, a good-looking, nice, confident guy that was probably already thinking he was boring just because he wanted to order tea.
Oh. That was something Cas hadn’t expected. So Jo was definitely not Dean’s potential girlfriend – not that it mattered, of course. There was still Cassie, and Lisa, and all the other girls he already saw around Dean. And even if Dean was single, it wasn’t a date, and it wasn’t as if the two of them could end up together anyway.
They stared at each other in a comfortable silence. Cas was almost about to ask him whether Dean wanted to come with him, when Dean cleared his throat.
“Well, if everything goes well, that’s the plan, but of course a lot of things could go wrong, and…” Cas started babbling. He wasn’t even sure that he wanted to be a doctor. It was what his father had suggested, sure, but was it what he really wanted?
“Well, considering how you ran towards me when I arrived, I'm sure you'll be able to keep your leg!”
“Wow, you’re good at this, Cas,” Dean whistled after Cas found out the answers to the questions he prepared very quickly.
“I figured that. I know it won’t help, but you really don’t have to worry. The kids are great, and even though some of them will argue about doing their homework, they're usually happy to come, because they know they’ll do super cool activities afterwards. And some of them come from very poor families where life isn’t really easy, and… it’s good for them to have a break from that, even if it’s just for two hours. I would have liked to have had that opportunity, as a kid.”
Cas nodded as he grabbed the remote and switched on the TV, launching Netflix. Dean had said to surprise him, while being a movie fan? He didn't know much about movies - he didn't watch TV that often. But Dean also said to choose something he liked. And to surprise him. With a smirk on his face, Cas selected the "documentaries" category, remembering their earlier conversation about animal documentaries.
“Wow, who are you and what did you do to Dean Winchester?” Charlie had laughed – and everyone had looked at Cas at the same time. He had blushed a little, but fortunately, Dean had quickly brought up another topic, and then Cas wasn’t the center of attention anymore. And now, they were in Dean’s car, talking about the next day.
He winked again, and Cas had to remember his resolutions. No falling for Dean. Winking seemed to be one of Dean’s favorite means of communication, and Cas had to learn to not be sensitive to it.
“Okay, calm down, now," he said to himself. He had rarely felt so flustered before. His thoughts were racing and he couldn’t control them, but they were all replaying the scenes from the evening: Dean in the kitchen, asking how he was feeling after he hit his head. Dean, saying his hair looked good on him. Dean, so close to him, asking him whether Cas wanted him to teach him how to play. Dean, winking before he left the kitchen. And finally, an over-confident, grinning Dean, winning the game, and winking at him before celebrating with the others, almost as if he was dedicating his victory to him. Which, of course, he wasn’t. It was only in Castiel’s mind. Cas needed to calm down; it didn’t mean anything. He would probably never see Dean again anyway. Which, maybe, wasn’t so bad, considering how agitated and confused that encounter had left Cas. But deep down he also felt a very new and unknown warm, pleasant feeling. It gradually spread through his mind and body as he calmed down. He fell asleep thinking about Dean’s green eyes, and his deep, confident, comforting gaze.
“Sammy...” he heard Dean rasp suddenly, his hand weakly grabbing pushing down the phone Sam was holding.
“And you're telling me this now?” he asks and looks around to see if he can take it off without any guests spotting him. Dean chuckles.
"No, listen Cas. I’m doing this." He said and cupped Cas‘ face with his hand, directing his gaze to him and him only. He felt his heart pounding rapidly in his chest, his mouth was dry and yet he was calm, as calm as he had ever been. It felt good.
"Yes. There’s bound to be a way to contact the Empty, or to open a portal…" he started, searching for any indication of the nature of Dean’s thoughts in his eyes. Truth to be told, Sam knew a lot about how Dean felt about it. About losing Cas. He remembered the way his voice broke when he told them.
“You have something...” he said, gesturing to his lips. He could've sworn he saw Cas blush as he wiped his mouth. And
“To catch that, we need to leave Munich at four thirty...” he starts and Cas feels his stomach drop. The training is up to 17, so they need to leave early. And leaving early means they will not get the certificate of completion and all of their troubles will have been for nothing.
“No, Cas, you stop being so damn naive. You heard Jack. He can't interfere anymore. Next time this happens, that's it. Lights out, curtain closed.” he snapped bitterly.. Cas didn't budge though still watching him intently.
He felt the pain shoot through his jaw and cheek and took a step back to steady himself, looking over to Dean. His brother was shaking slightly, his breathing seemed to be a little too quick and shallow, his eyes red and glassy.
"Look me in the eye and tell me you’re not working with Crowley..!" he heard himself say. And he saw the hurt in his face, but somehow, he felt it a thousand times more. He felt an immense guilt, not too different from his own, yet somehow foreign.
“Hi, welcome.” he said, his voice steady and friendly. He noticed another man following the stranger, also dressed in a smart suit. His gut was really trying to tell him that the situation was anything but normal.
Dean took a yet another swig out of his beer as if he could drown himself in it to escape the awkward conversation. Then he noticed the ketchup in the corner of Cas' lips.
Dean tore his eyes away from the weird arrangement of cacti on the shelf above Cas's bed, complete with colorful pots, and turned around, looking directly into Cas's blue eyes. He quickly lowered his gaze, only to end up staring at his lips.
“What do you mean we have to get off??” Dean questions the guard, frowning, as Cas gathers their stuff.
“Are they having a freaking siesta or what?” asks Dean as they confirm that even the local caffé is closed. Sweating under the unforgiving sun, they drag themselves back to the Schwandorf train station and try to find something to eat in the only open buffet, but their appetite leaves them the moment they see the flies rubbing their disgusting tiny hands over the bagels. They settle for a bag of crisps and some lemonade for Cas, beer for Dean. And they complain. If Cas knows one thing about conversations, it's that having common thing to complain about keeps it flowing. Not that they need it, having chatted for the entirety of their trip from Prague to bloody Schwandorf.
“Sure.” he said and handed Cas the keys, their hands touching maybe for a milisecond longer than needed. Cas grinned and got behind the wheel and Dean briefly wondered what he had gotten himself into.
"I- I’ll call you later." he ended the call swiftly and watched his brother reach for a whiskey glass. Only there weren’t any left, which made Dean shrug and take a sip directly from the bottle he’d been carrying. So much for breakfast, thought Sam as his brother all too ignored the toast Sam had left for him at the counter.
"I’m so sorry. I should’ve told you…I should’ve told you too…" Dean said softly, but his voice was raw. Sam couldn’t recall when was the last time he sounded so broken. He heard a sniff and a clank, probably a bottle hitting the floor. He was willing himself to move, to leave. He shouldn’t be hearing this. But before he could move a muscle, he heard sobs. No, Dean wasn’t just sobbing.
“They won't find us anymore, Dean. Jack made sure of that. There won't be any more monsters in our lives.” he said reassuringly, giving him a sof smile. Dean looked at him questioningly.
"About Cas." he added and immediately noticed the melancholic frown that settled on his brother’s face upon hearing it. He didn’t say anything.
"Hey, Dean..take it easy." He could hear the worry in Sam’s voice. Slowly, he managed to open his eyes, his vision a bit blurry. He was in his bedroom, in the bunker. Sam was there, sitting next to his bed, now clear relief washing all over his face. He blinked once, twice, the recent events settling into his memory. He inhaled sharply.
And he was sure. When he lay in bed that night, staring at the shadows on the ceiling and trying to fall asleep, he was still thinking about it. Even though their home was small, and even though he still didn't have a job, and he and Dean were still only learning how to be together, they've built something that Cas loved already. There was no way Sam wouldn't. But when he turned to Dean to tell him, the other was already asleep.
Dean placed his beer down on the table and licked his lips, his eyes darting over to Cas for a fraction of a moment. "I'm tired, Sam. And like you said, it's different now. You, other hunters, you guys don't need me anymore."
“The old farm by the north route. Let's talk business when you get here.” The line disconnected. Dean angrily threw the phone against the wall, the plastic back falling of as it smashed against it.
“I'll say it for the last time — let him go.” repeated Dean, his voiced laced with anger. Asbeel chuckled. Cas notice that glint in Dean's eyes as both he and Sam attacked the angels, the years of fighting by each other's side paying off. Cas wiggled his wrists more, the rope cutting into his skin with sharp sting, but he took it no heed. He could do it. He shot a quick glance to the fight.
“I did.” he admitted. So that's what Dean was worried about. Cas didn't know whether he should feel flattered that Dean wouldn't stop him or offended that he thought Cas would do it against his wishes. Especially after what happened.”But that was then. This is now.”
He was taking the trash out when he noticed a dirty van standing in front of the store, with a surprisingly well-dressed man lurking in front of it. That certainly didn't look like their usual trucker customer. It was weird, if not suspicious. He was suddenly interrupted from his thoughts by a soft chime of his phone. He shot one last look in the stranger's direction and headed inside, checking the message from Dean.
"Hey, Dean.." Sam started, carefully thinking about choosing his next words. Dean shot him a glance that almost challenged Sam to comment, to question his brother’s behaviour.
Castiel finds himself nodding as he looks at the stack of clothes he's been handed at the beginning of the tour. Joanna, the front office manager at KFL Hotels, Castiel's new part time job, gives him reassuring smile.
“So what is with the shirts, guys? You two are that kind of a couple huh?” she asks, genuinely interested. Cas chokes on his weak Cuba Libre and Dean...Dean just smirks.
"I was thinking we could hit the books and try to find a way to bring Cas back…" he said, maybe too softly. Dean just stared at him.
“We just..I need more time.” he said finally, sounding quite unsure and very unwilling to talk about it. Sam made turn to Walmart's parking lot.
“You have a reservation? The checking time starts at two but I can have a look if we have something ready. What's your name?”
"A few ingredients, I think we should have most of it here. Jack gave me the spell, so…" he trailed off, running his hand through his hair. Eileen gave him a knowing look.
Cas got out of the bed and stretched his arms, yawning. If his experience as a human taught him anything, it was that getting up was harder than falling asleep. He made few steps over to the door, enjoying the feeling of the soft carpet he fought so hard for.
about admitting that before. Cas looked at him wide-eyed, but squeezed his hand and smiled at the waitress.
“Just a lake. It's close by, we don't have to drive for long. There's also a barbeque area..” he started explaining and Dean found himself chuckling. Not because it was a
“So what now?” was the question. And like too many times in his life, Dean didn't know the answer. He remembered looking at his brother, with his
“I need a shower. Can you make some breakfast?” Dean asked as he left the empty bottle on the counter and waltzed to their tiny bathroom. Cas's eyes lingered on his sweat drenched back for the moment it took Dean to close the bathroom door. Then he stood up again and went to look what food they had. He didn't particularly enjoy cooking and always preffered to leave that to Dean. He didn't even like eating breakfast, but for Dean, it was the main meal of the day.
him, apparently. This fondness he was talking about, even Dean knew what it could be. He began to smile, progressively letting a feeling of deep happiness invade him, until he realized that the fact that Cas was possibly
Cas was too stunned by the turn of events to fight him on it. While they were driving towards Allen Fieldhouse, where the game was taking place, Dean’s phone buzzed. Once he had parked the car, he checked his message.
Dean searched his pockets for money while Cas grabbed his wallet. As Cas was taking his credit card out, Dean beat him by giving the barista a ten-dollar bill.
And he winked at him and Cas wondered if he was dreaming, and if he wasn’t, how he could still be alive, and why he hadn’t had a heart attack yet, given how fast his heart was beating and how fast his thoughts were racing.
“Wait until I become a real doctor, one day you’ll come back home, and I’ll be baking pie for you, and you won’t even need Doctor Sexy anymore.”
“He's not picking up.” Dean said, nervously pacing in the smal area his living room offered. He had been trying to reach Castiel for the past twenty minutes, but without success. Sam was started to look worried, too.
Cas just nodds. He has heard about the compulsory trainings provided for all employees, even part time, and he actually looks forward to finally visiting the campus. And it's not like he has ever been to Munich, either. He doesn't dwell too much on the thought of going with Dean. After all, he gets along with all of his colleagues.
The journey of Hell, as Dean later refers to the trip, takes a few hours, which feel like an eternity. By the time they unglue themselves from their seats at Munich Hautpbahnhof, the evil sun that has been torturing them the entire day is less aggressive and they are positively tired. They manage to buy metro tickets and within short while arrive to the KFL Campus. They check in and find out they have rooms on the same floor.
He chose a polo shirt; polo shirts were great when he wasn’t sure what level of casualness was expected. Not as formal as a button-up, but still better than a simple shirt; there was a collar, after all. He selected a nice white one that he never wore before, with a pair of dark jeans. He tried to eat, and surprisingly, he managed to swallow an entire peanut butter and jelly sandwich. At one pm sharp, he was ready, waiting behind the door.
Cas checked the projector. It was switched on. The wire seemed to be connected in the right way…He tried to unplug and reconnect the wire, but nothing changed. Then he checked the computer settings.
Cas immediately stopped and carefully looked at Dean. He didn’t seem angry. Dean smiled a little, seeing how Cas’s face was covered in dough.
“The idea is to pair up students that will be in charge of a group of 8 to 10 children, for two hours. One hour of tutoring and one hour of more fun activities. You can organize yourselves in two ways. Option A, one student does the tutoring for half of the group while the other half does sports or cultural activities with the second student for an hour, and then the groups switch. Option B, you don’t divide the group, and both of the students take care of tutoring and activities. In your registration forms, you were asked whether you were more at ease with tutoring or managing the activities, and we have two lists of students…” Jody displayed the next slide. “And we will let you create your own pairs, but keep in mind that it would be better to have one student from each group in each pair.”
The next player, a guy Cas had already seen before hanging out with Balthazar, winced before putting his cards down on the table. “Okay, I fold.”
Back then, Cas never could have imagined that such a situation could really happen. The idea that Dean could be interested in him had seemed ridiculous. Yet, now, it was almost worse. Because now he knew that Dean wouldn’t reject him. Dean wouldn’t say no to a night with him. The problem wasn’t Dean. It was Cas. “
Suddenly, they didn’t seem that incompatible. Suddenly, a wave of hope greater than ever swept over Cas. The feeling was everywhere in his body: it started from his chest and spread to the rest of his body. His legs felt weak, his hands were almost shaking, his head was tingling, his cheeks were reddening.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. He had so many questions. Why did Cas decide to try this dating app? Was he chatting with a lot of people? Had he already met someone in real life? Was Cas
He had never been in such a situation. A very handsome guy like Dean acting so flirty with him? He was probably imagining things and overanalyzing the situation. He ate his sandwich, trying to listen to the voices that were coming from the living room, then stood up to head back to his room. Walking by the living room door, he had a moment of hesitation. But the door was closed, and he had already been through a lot of emotions for the day. The next day would also be busy and stressful with his first volunteer meeting, so he decided to stick to his initial plan and go back to his room to relax.
Dean frowned. "But no, I mean, Cas, I had planned to spend the evening here with you... It wasn't an obligation...". The features of his face darkened, the shadow of a sudden realization passing through his eyes: "Wait... was it one for you? An obligation?” he asked, a hint of disappointment in his voice (or perhaps it was Cas extrapolating?).
“It’s…understandable,” Dean commented. He was a little bit lost, trying to understand what Cas meant, but he wasn’t very good at identifying and dealing with feelings himself. Cas, who was staring at the wall in front of him, gave him a quick look and a shy smile.
Café-in was often busy on Wednesdays, and Dean’s roommate was studying for his midterms in their room, so Cas suggested that Dean come to his place to finish preparing the scavenger hunt. Since Balthazar was in class, they settled in the living-room. They each had prepared a few clues and needed to test them.
“No-Not at all,” Cas answered, quickly and defensively, feeling his cheeks turning red from embarrassment.
“Well, we have our own game to organize tomorrow, so maybe it would be better if we had a quiet night…”
On the sidewalk, he came face to face with… Dean, who was holding his phone on his shoulder with his right hand.
"Yes, you did surprise me. Well done. After I got to demonstrate my baking skills and my failed attempts at teaching you poker basics, it's only fair that you introduce me to the wonderful world of wildlife documentaries!"
Cas was a little bit taken aback by the question. It was a Saturday evening. Of course he didn’t have anything planned. The question was more why didn’t Dean have anything planned?
Cas was exhausted. It had been a very long week, and a very long day, and he couldn’t wait to finally get home, lie down in his bed, and try to relax. His weekend would be busy: he had his microbiology lab to prepare for next Monday, some readings to do before Wednesday, and Saturday was his first meeting for the volunteer program he had committed to.
“But you did it, in the end. Better late than never. Besides, it’s not even late. Everyone goes at their own pace. For me it’s easy, because I’m used to it. I don’t deserve any credit for doing what I can do easily! But for you, it’s more complicated, because you’re an introvert. But you decided to do it anyway. That makes your commitment to the program even more meaningful!”
Dean’s gaze darkened, and Cas wondered what had happened during his childhood. Was he from one of these poor families? Dean stopped talking and nervously ran a hand through his hair. He didn’t seem comfortable talking about that, so Cas decided to not push him by asking questions, even though he really wanted to know more about him. Instead, he gently addressed him with a supportive smile.
“So I tried to talk to people on the app, but it didn’t really help me. Some of them even texted me about having sex directly, but t wasn’t something I was interested in at all. Even if they were good-looking.”
“I know but… It’s just that I never celebrated Christmas, and, behind all the God’s symbol, it just seems to be a universal human holiday and tradition, and, as I’m losing my powers, I wanted to do something to be closer to humans, I guess…. But anyway, it doesn’t matter, I didn’t succeed. My first try of cookie burned, and I just spilled the second, and now I don’t have enough ingredients, and I guess it means I’ll just never be enough human… I’m sorry you saw something Christmas related, I’ll just let you cook and then I’ll clean the kitchen and stay in my room. It was a stupid idea, and…”.
Cas smiled, and Dean took it as a reward. In the beginning, he didn’t know whether it was a good idea. But seeing Cas smiling and looking everywhere in the store strangely made him happy. He could see that Cas was holding back from asking too many questions. Usually, he would have told him to just ask them, but this day it just seemed “too much”. Their relationship was still damaged. It wasn’t the same as before, even though it was sometimes hard to remember it. Two years ago, he would just have answered every question Cas had, telling him stories and Christmas jokes. He would have organized a full cliché Christmas, with gifts and decorations, and food, and Christmas carols. But something was broken between them, and as much as he would have loved to just share what he knew about Christmas with Cas, it was just not possible. Something was holding him back, and it seems that the same thing was holding Cas back too.
Dean took a look at the drink, stirring the cup a little. “I’m sure I will if you love it. I trust your judgment,” he said, leaning in a little.
It was late, and Sam was probably already sleeping. Cas too, since he was human now and therefore needed to sleep. However, Dean noticed that there was light in the kitchen. From the corridor, he couldn’t see who was inside, so he paused for a minute. He couldn’t hear any noise coming from the room, though, which probably meant that the kitchen was empty, and someone just forgot to switch off the light. Relieved, he entered it, walking directly to the fridge to get a fresh beer. He was grabbing one when suddenly a voice he knew very well called him.
Sam squinted his eyes, opened his mouth to say something but changed his mind at the last moment. He must have realized that this was not the time.
“He always thought I’d come to work with him as soon as I could. And I always let him believe that. I didn’t even like high school, I was already working with him after school and on the weekends, so… But I also know my mother would have liked me to pursue a college education. I thought it wasn’t for me, but more for my brother. But then I thought why not. I could try, and if I didn’t like it, I could always come back to the garage. Plus, there’s Sammy, my little brother. He’s the smart one of the family, but… I’m the big brother. I want to be a role model for him, don’t want him to see me as a failure…”
Cas’ phone vibrated, pulling him out of his spiral. Who could be texting him at nine on a Friday evening? Maybe Meg had a problem? Or one of his brothers? He took a look at the screen and his heart skipped a beat. Dean had texted him.
, Dean had added. However, Cas was a grown-up twenty-year old. He could decide what clothes he was going to wear by himself; maybe he could just check what Dean was wearing when he came to pick him up at one and quickly change if needed. Yes, that sounded like a good plan. Dean would tell him if he was over (or under) dressed.
Cas really tried to stay professional, but he was almost sure that Dean noticed how cold and distant he was acting. If he was surprised or hurt by this behaviour, Dean didn't let it show, joking with the children they were supervising. And somehow, his indifference made Cas even more infuriated.
“Hey, Cas. You don’t have to be afraid, okay? You can…you can tell me anything. I won’t get mad. I promise. Just…just keep talking to me, okay? I’m not the best at feelings, but we can figure it out together. It’s normal that after your…changes. You’ve been confused. Don’t worry.”
The afternoon was going great. The kids were excited when Dean had announced that they would play basketball after their homework, and it motivated them to quickly do all their school tasks.
, to perfect strangers, but he guessed that his friend probably had been very confused and overwhelmed.
Of course, he didn’t dare to talk himself. But listening to others was already very therapeutic and satisfying on its own. When the meeting ended two hours later, Cas hadn’t seen the time fly, and as he left the room, waving to the other students, he already knew he would come back next week.
“I’m gonna get another beer, do you want to come with me?” Dean asked. “I can get you a drink if you want.”
Without waiting for Cas’ answer, he walked back to the front door of his car, when Cas suddenly remembered something he wanted to ask him.
He was glad he had signed up; the project looked interesting. He would be volunteering two hours every Saturday for an organization that was supporting children from low-income families by offering them sports, cultural activities, and school tutoring for free. He knew he had been lucky to have been born into a well-to-do family; his father a doctor, and his mother an executive officer for the United States Department of Homeland Security. He had lacked nothing during his childhood; he had gone to the best private schools, had private language lessons, private tutors after school, and benefited from quality fencing lessons. Really, he had lacked for nothing, except maybe affection, his parents both being very busy, and his siblings being older than him. But he knew better than to complain; he knew he was privileged, that he wouldn’t start his life with huge student debts like most of his university classmates, and didn’t even need to live on-campus or share his room with another student. Since first year, he had been living in a nice little house next to the campus with his childhood friend Balthazar – and not because he needed to for financial reasons, but mostly because he hadn’t wanted to be alone his first year. Balt was very different from him, but they both had their own rooms and were respectful of each other. Balt didn’t organize big parties at home without first warning Cas and asking him if he could, and Cas was careful to not be too loud when he got up early if he knew that Balt had gone out and probably needed to sleep in the next morning.
Except that he discovered, the year before, that the other people were in fact not exaggerating. He was looking at a post from the university LGBT+ society on social media where all the letters from “LGBTQIA+” were explained. Cas always thought that the “A” stood for “ally.” Turned out, it also stood for “asexual.” He heard the term before but didn’t really know what it meant. He thought it was used for people who wanted to never have sex. Which was not his case: he wasn’t against sex, he could picture himself making love to his future boyfriend, at some point… in the future. Not now. He had been in love, had thought about holding hands with his crushes, maybe even kissing them… But having sex? Not now. In the context of a relationship, as an act of intimacy and love, he wasn’t against the idea. He was curious, too: he heard a lot of friends or classmates talk about it, and it seemed to be a big deal. He didn’t understand why, though. He had never understood the concept of “friends with benefits,” or “one-night-stands.” What was the point of one-night stands? Why would someone want to have sex with someone they didn’t know, with someone with whom they weren’t sharing anything? Having sex was something very intimate, not something you could do, just like that!
As soon as the Impala parked in front of his place, he went out without even giving Dean time to text him.
“Well, I guess that people change, you were not the kind of girl who stuck with the same guy for more than three dates, and here you are, the official girlfriend of Dean’s roommate!”
A new question arose in Dean’s mind: what should he do now? Should he just close the app and pretend nothing happened? Could he see Cas again, talk to him, look at him in the eyes, pretending he didn’t know Cas was a) on a dating app, b) attracted to men? Besides, if Dean had seen Cas’ profile, it meant Cas probably had seen Dean’s. If it was the case, why didn’t he mention it? Dean tried to remember whether Cas’ behavior towards him had changed recently. He didn’t think so. Cas didn’t seem to be more uncomfortable than usual when they were together. It probably meant that Cas hadn’t seen Dean’s profile yet. Should Dean ignore the situation and wait for Cas to mention it when he inevitably found Dean’s profile? Was it too late to completely delete his profile to make sure Cas wouldn’t find it?
He opened the blinds and let some of that annoying sun in, briefly wondering if he should ask Dean to lend him the Impala to go the store, but then he remembered. They were fighting, of course.
Castiel’s old trench coat. Sam thought Cas had gotten rid of it when he got the new one, but that obviously wasn’t the case. It had been there the whole time.
“Listen, Dean, Cas and I talked and...” Sam started and Dean stopped mid-way into biting in the juicy double bacon cheeseburger.
“Dean let me drive the Impala.” explained Cas, confused, his eyes ticking from one Winchester to another. Dean just gave him a small smile and handed him a beer.
, did he sound disappointed, Dean noticed. And before he got the chance to make it better (or maybe fuck it up even more), Cas stood up, brushing a few crumbles off his jacket. “I'm going to the car. I've...some pie there.” he mumbled and walked off.
“Bring him back...please” begged Cas.  No, Sam thought, he prayed. To the one person who could help them. And as much as he tried not to get his hopes up as he realized what Cas was doing, he found himself looking around for the familiar figure. Cas did the same, desperation etched into his features as he scanned their surroundings. But there were only them and the dead. Cas blinked, fresh tears streaming down his face. He gently combed his bloody fingers through Dean's hair and sobbed.
"He said he loved me and I… I couldn’t… I didn’t say it back. I didn’t say it back Sammy…" he muttered, his voice so filled with despair and pain and regret it brought tears to Sam’s eyes too. He wanted to reach out and comfort him, but Dean felt too far. Too distant. Too lost.
“You know what I mean. He was an angel, and now he's human and he has to deal with new sensations, needs and...feelings.” he said, looking straight at Dean, who swalloved. But before any of them could continue, a new set of steps echoed through the halls. Dean shot a look to Sam, meaning of which was clearly understood between the brothers, and soon enough, Cas appeared.
Dean lets the young couple fill in the registration forms and grins at Cas. His shirt is a bit crumpled and his hair a little more tousled than usually, but he does look rested.
Sam couldn't tell how much time have passed with them sitting in the pool of Dean's blood, Cas clutching his lifeless body as if he could will him back to life. It was a silent buzz of his phone that woke him up from his trance. He ignored it, and instead put his hand on Cas's shoulder, noticing just how much it was trembling.
“I'll ask around if there are any openings...” he promised and Cas gave him a small smile. Steps like these were all it took to reach destination, after all.
"Dean, listen, we’ve been talking, and I think we should try contacting Jack." he said, and Dean just stared at him with empty eyes.
“I mean, how many times will shit like this happen? How many times will the past come knockin', how many past mistakes will catch up to us, how many monsters will we face? This will never stop, Cas...”
"Cas, I hope you got your ears on. I hope you're okay. I’m coming to get you, so…watch yourself." he heard his own voice echo through the air, much louder and clearer that the forests sounds, than the river flowing, than the monsters around. And suddenly he noticed him. Cas. Sitting by the river, alone, dirty, and filled with guilt. Not responding. He walked over.
“Why don't you take Cas with you? He could finally get some decent clothes for himself...” suggested Sam, hoping that his brother would finally do something about all of this ridiculous avoidance.
, he corrected himself as he plopped down in a comfy chair, cracked open a beer and turned on his laptop. He might have told him how he felt in a weak, emotional moment. And while he absolutely meant it, it didn't mean that he had to immediately smooch and marry the guy. Too much stuff was still hanging to have time to deal with feelings.
“I checked our train departure time, but...it's not there.” Cas frowns. Their train back to Prague vanishing is the last thing they need. They can't afford to miss the flight back to London either.
"I need you." he found himself, his past and his actual self, saying in unison. Loud and clear. The ringing stopped. Cas dropped the angel blade and slowly looked up. Not at the bloody Dean kneeling in front of him.
He could see Dean's face relax a bit more, his features softer and his green eyes sparkling And if him not bringing up hunting again would make that happen more often, it was worth it.
“Alright. Yell if you need me.” he says before retreating to the small kitchen to get his lunch and hears Dean's joking “I will.”
“I swear I hate German trains.” Dean grunts when they find empty seats and Cas ungracefully sinks into it, nodding. “Agreed.”
“But you made it in time, so no harm done..” Charlie grins and Dean just glares at her before leaving to get another drink. They all turn to Cas, looking eerily similar to vultures.
He could see the piece of beige fabric wedged in between the bent metal. He felt a sharp pain in his chest.
"And remember, if something goes wrong, we can’t count on Jack. He can‘t interfere within the Empty. To maintain balance. Even giving us the spell might have put the balance in jeopardy unless we are really careful about it." he added while Eileen finished the preparation of the ingredients. Dean swallowed and nodded. Balance. That made the stakes high. But Cas made them higher.
"Well, that was a surprise." concluded Sam once Dean and Cas left and he was alone with Eileen, cleaning up after the meal. She nodded.
"Watch me." he said and smashed the bottle with his grace on the ground. Dean felt a powerful wave sweep him of his feet, he saw the brightest blue light, and he felt Cas squeezing his hand. And then everything went black.
Dean immediately dived into the food while Cas finished his now cold cup of coffee and read the news.
, he remembered thinking with an uneasy weight settling in his stomach. He looked over to the sleeping figure.
It's 6:50 when he enters the lobby, gasping for breath. He ended up running all the way from the train station and he quickly glances at the poor night receptionist whom he made extend his shift.
"I’m leaving." said Cas flatly, but Dean could feel him being nervous. Being scared as much as he was. The Empty laughed and Dean felt chills run through his entire body. He looked at Cas, whose eyes shone with determination.
“I'm sorry, this train doesn't go to Prague.” says the guard when checking their tickets. Cas blinks.
“Bring him back...” he whispered to the silence. Sam saw his hand, which had an awful looking wound, clutch Dean's body stronger.
, and indeed, soon enough the trees on the sides cleared up and a nice looking lake came into the view, its waters sparkling in the sun. As soon as Cas parked Dean practically jumped out of the car. Cas ignored him and went to fetch their stuff from the trunk while Dean looked around.
"We’re getting Cas back." he said excitedly. Dean looked at him, feeling very, very tired, and yet unable to fight the tiniest spark of hope that he felt upon hearing that. That one could never be extinguished.
"I’m not…" he started, then he blinked again as it dawned on him just what was Dean asking him to do. Dean felt his heart clench. Now it was up to Cas. What if Cas didn’t want to leave? What if he didn’t want to become human? He swallowed nervously, awaiting Cas‘ reply. But the angel instead gently took the container from Dean’s hand, his touch lingering maybe a millisecond longer than it had to.
. Sam inwardly sighed and parked the car, turning off the engine looked at Cas again. Time to change the topic.
"So what then, you think Empty will just let Cas walk out? Just like that, no consequences? That’s not how this works, Sammy. There’s always a price to pay, you know that." he said, hating how his coarse voice didn’t have enough strength. But Sam’s determination didn’t seem to falter.
Before Sam could process the implications and the weight of what Dean has just shared with him, his brother turned to him, tears streaming down his face. Yet he looked more alive than he had in past weeks.
“By the way, Balt, is it okay if Dean comes over tomorrow? We have to bake cookies for the children in our volunteer program, and he doesn’t have a private kitchen in his dorm, and…”
Dean almost choked. So Cas did go on a date? But when? How could he and Sam have not noticed Cas leaving the bunker for a few hours? And most importantly, did that guy try to convince Cas to have sex with him? Did he touch him? Hurt him? Threaten him?
“Well, I don’t really know. They were together for a pretty long time, compared to Dean’s usual relationships, but it wasn’t something very official or even exclusive, I think. With Dean, it’s hard to keep track anyway,” he chuckled, but stopped immediately after seeing the black look Cas was giving him. “I don’t really know if – or when – they broke up, but a few weeks ago, Dean brought a new girl, someone called Callie, I think…”
“Um, Cas… You sure you wanna talk about this now? I’m okay with it, with talking now, but maybe you need to sleep a little? To recover from your… I guess you had a panic attack, or something similar? That’s why I came. Charlie told me it would probably be better to leave you alone for the evening to let you… think about it? Process it? Especially since you wouldn’t be completely alone, since Balthazar would be here… But I was worried about you, anyway, and I’m so glad I came, since Balthazar isn’t here… I’m sorry it took me so long to come with the keys, by the way. If I had known you were waiting in the rain, I would have tried to get here sooner!”
was really there. He closed his eyes, trying to breathe. Charlie stopped talking. The other students that Cas still couldn’t see, were completely silent, holding their breaths, starting to understand what was going on. Cas’ thoughts were racing in his brain, and he couldn’t think clearly anymore. His brain and body turned into “panic” mode. Denial, denial was the best solution. If he didn’t turn around, he wouldn’t see him, and he could still pretend he didn’t know he had heard him… He was about to suggest the idea to Charlie, where he heard it.
Dean thought about it for a few seconds. Indeed, Tom was very handsome, and if Dean had been in the mood, he wouldn’t have said no to having some fun with him.
“Don’t change, Cas,” Dean repeated, before joining the two last children, who were playing a card game.
He knew it wasn’t a big thing. The other members of the society talked about their experiences every week in a very spontaneous way. He had had time to prepare: to get used to the idea and to think about what he would say. He was more ready than the students who usually spoke. He was ready. Besides, he wasn’t risking anything. Worst case scenario, if he couldn’t finish talking and had to just stop, no one would blame him for that. He didn’t have to worry about anything. It could only help him, to finally talk about his feelings freely.
Dean almost dropped his phone as he stared incredulously at his phone. Cas wasn't even 45! Not that it was the most surprising fact, here. Cas was on a dating app? Since when? And most importantly, why?
. He just wanted to share his point of view about documentaries, and he was so focused on his arguments that he didn’t think anymore about what Dean would think of him. He was just himself.
Dean to Sam: “I don’t know what gift-giving to Cas! Can’t find anything meaningful at the convenience store!”
“Hm, why not? That sounds good, but I’ll have to ask my boyfriend first, I’ve been trying to teach him poker recently, and I think he might be interested in joining us?”
“Wow. You’re literally the only person I know on this campus who’d say no to that. You’re weird, Clarence.”
Everybody started commenting on the game, but Dean didn’t speak right away. Just after revealing his cards – the two aces – he had raised his gaze and looked directly at Cas, right in the eyes. Then, he had winked – again! – before turning his attention back to the other players and celebrating his victory. Cas took one step back, blushing once more.
“Well, because I’d understand if knowing that I’m in love with you and that I lied to you for months, pretending to just be your friend, makes you uncomfortable.”
Cas burst out laughing as he opened the door. "I saw you two interacting last week at the bar, and far be it from me to turn my living room into a war zone, don't worry!”
Dean's heart missed a beat. Cas had hurt himself? He took the three steps that separated him from the bathroom in one bound. Cas and Sam were standing in front of one of the sinks. Sam was holding the bunker's medicine kit, and Dean noticed that the sink was stained red and that blood-soaked compresses had been placed there, probably while Sam was treating Cas.
“Clarence, Clarence, Clarence… you’re definitely too inhibited. I’m sure Dean Winchester is a sex god. And given the looks he gave you, you only have one word to say, and he’ll take care of you…”
Balthazar was still looking at him, apparently waiting for an answer, but Cas didn’t know how to respond. He knew that he and Dean were two very different people, that they didn’t belong together, and weren’t looking for the same kind of relationship. Still, it hurt to hear it from Balthazar, a neutral source who didn’t really know about his crush on Dean, and therefore was not trying to hide things from Cas to make him happy.
His hand was warm in Cas’. There was still a crowd all around them, people talking loudly, but Cas felt as if there was only Dean and him. Only the two of them mattered. Holding Dean’s hand to navigate in the crowd was easy, as if the people were walking away when they approached, to clear the way for them, as if them walking together, hand in hand, was the only right thing. Of course, it wasn’t, but it was a nice feeling that Cas had never experienced before – and hadn’t actually expected to experience.
“Of course I can, who do you think I am,” Cas started to defend himself, but stopped when he saw Dean laughing.
He stopped in front of the door to his house, looking for his keys in the big pocket of his trench coat. It was 5 pm, and he wasn’t expecting Balt to be home. It was a Friday evening, and usually his roommate would be out – Balthazar really liked to party – so he wouldn’t be bothered by him during the evening. However, when he came into the living room, he was surprised to see Balt sweeping. They had divided the chores, but Balt wasn’t in charge of cleaning that week. Cas frowned.
Cas nodded. It wasn’t a lot, but he hadn’t really had any expectations before coming. Progressively, students began to come in, joining them at the center of the room. No one seemed to be surprised that he, a guy that they never saw before, was present and casually eating cookies with the president of the society.
Dean smiled. “He’s a mechanic, owns his garage, and for years I thought I’d go to work with him at the shop after high school. But… My mother, she would have wanted me to go to college. To try, at least. It wasn’t an easy choice. I didn’t want to disappoint my father, you know.”
However, he had just woken up from a two hour nap, and wasn’t really tired anymore. Every time he tried closing his eyes, Dean’s face kept coming to mind. His brain replayed their meeting over and over, and he couldn’t stop it. He finally sat up in bed, grabbed his laptop, and started playing one of the animal documentaries he really liked. That usually helped him relax, but he just couldn’t focus on it, and with a sigh, he closed the computer. He looked at the time: 10:45. Balthazar had told him that they would probably play until 2 am, and Cas got the unpleasant feeling that he wouldn’t close his eyes until everyone had left. He waited a few more minutes, then couldn't hold out any longer. He got up and left his room.
“I’m looking forward to it,” he said. “Maybe we can go to check the kitchen now to see whether I have all the baking tools you’ll need?”
After two more episodes, as Cas was yawning more and more, Dean decided it was time for him to go to bed – even if Cas protested because he wanted to see if the endearing patient was going to die.
Dean opened his mouth, ready to protest, but Cas, being on a roll, raised a hand to prevent him from speaking and to make him understand that he had to let him finish.
Balthazar exchanged a look with Cas, not knowing whether he could out him or not. Cas shrugged. He wasn’t ashamed of who he was.
“And, really, don’t worry about your outfit or anything, you’re at your place, you can dress however you want, that’s the whole point!”
“To…sort out my feelings?” Cas answered, with a hint of uncertainty in his voice, as if he wasn’t sure that the words he carefully chose were appropriate.
"What happened?“ Dean turned his gaze to him. His eyes were bloodshot, his face hollow. He swallowed and looked back at the floor. Sam sighed and stood up, walking around the car to examine the damage. And there it was.
Dean felt sick to his stomach. Unable to determine how much time have passed, he was jumping from one bad memory to another, just watching. He couldn’t reach Cas, he couldn’t do
"You will tell him, Dean. We will get him back. " he said, but didn’t know whether Dean heard him or not, his steps echoing away.
It lasts what feels longer than the entirety of Castiel's 23 years of life. In reality, it might have been anywhere between 1 to 5 minutes, is what he will decide later when thinking it over and over again.
"There isn’t! Cas is gone! He’s dead and he’s not coming back!" Dean snapped. But Sam wasn’t having it.
“Yeah, well, happy to help.” he says and then leaves to get his rest. Cas watches the lift door close, He makes a few cappuccinos and a decent looking latte for a chatty Italian lady and by the time the reception gets busy with selling breakfast and guests checking out, Charlie comes to help. The time flies by and he's in the luggage room hauling a heavy black suitcase up to the shelf when he hears Dean's voice.
“So I swear, if you as much as mention a train in front of me...” Dean warns jokingly and takes a sip of his beer. Jo laughs.
“It's not like we have anything better to do...” he said while shooting intense stare at Dean, who put down his fork. Another thing they ought to have resolved already.
"Dean? Dean?" as if someone was thinking about him, calling out to him, reaching out to him, words laced with a strong sense of duty and emotion. And then the barn door flew open, and accompanied by numerous blows and sparks, Castiel walked in. Dean felt himself hold his breath. And yet, this wasn’t Castiel from back then, not entirely. Dean had no idea how, but he could tell. He could feel it in his bones, in his gut, in his heart.
"Dean!" Dean’s eyes met the blue ones, the blue ones he had feared he’d never get to see again. His breath hitched in his throat, taking it all in. He looked tired, perhaps more than Dean felt, and his hair was a mess. He was wearing a plaid shirt that Dean vaguely recognized as his own, and he was unshaven. He looked so vulnerable, so real.
“Just joking. He has a boyfriend anyway. Benny is a nice guy, but honestly Dean could do better. You two would be great together.”she shruggs and goes to steam the milk for her cappuccino and Cas returns to counting the money.
“I'm not your personal cook, Dean.” he said, although he didn't mind taking care of Dean. He placed the scrambled eggs in front of Dean and sat down with his own plate.
The angels were weak, clearly, resigning to the classic blade fight. And no angel Cas knew could win one on one against the Winchesters. He saw Sam skillfully block Asbeel's attack out of the corner of his eye as he was inching to freeing his hands. He heard Dean kill one of the angels, the body falling to the barn floor with a loud thump. And then he heard that. That awfully familiar sound that recently gained somewhat negative accent.
“I was hoping you'd teach me...” he admitted. Dean incredulously looked at him and couldn't help but grin.
Dean forced himself to look at Cas, who was staring at him like he was the only thing in the world worth looking at.
“Duh, I know. But Sarah does, right?” he says, looking in the direction of their blonde colleague from KFL Bonn. Cas nodds.
“You need to change in Regensburg.” she says and leaves. Cas turns to Dean, who's looking definitely more than pissed.
"Wait, you said the one. The one staying in the life. Does that mean you're out? Out of hunting?" he asked, but it wasn't accusing. It was genuine surprise, because for as long as he could remember, Dean was always the one intending to go out "guns blazing. "What changed?"
“Oh, how the mighty have fallen.” chuckled Tamiel, whose name Cas barely remembered. He certainly didn't know him, not personally. He considered his option, deciding that gaining more time was instrumental.
“Who was that? Is Cas okay? Where is he?” he asked. Dean shot him a look, not believing how calm his brother was.
"I have no idea. We'll figure it out as we go." he said finally, looking over at Cas, who nodded and added "We're leaving."
They stayed up for another hour, until their eyes were so weary they couldn’t read anymore. Sam was on his way to bed when he heard a voice coming from Dean’s room. He silently crept closer to the slightly open door.
He might not have been sure whether leaing his boring, yet stable and easy job as a office receptionist for a front office agent, a customer service position of all things, was a wise move, but here he is. He glances in the mirror for the last time as he tries to tame his hair and takes a deep breath. Here goes nothing.
Over the course of morning, Dean was happily teaching Cas how to fish. And if his hand lingered on Cas's a little too long, or if he stood a little too close,
Dean gives him a overacted judging look, but before he can answer, a guest come to the reception, and only when Cas sees himself in the locker room at the end of his shift, he notices how incredibly wild his hair looks. He wonders if Dean would've told him.
“I'm gonna grab a quick shower. Meet you here in thirty?” Dean offers and Castiel just nodds again, his brain feeling similar to scrambled eggs in consistency.
“I thought that if I told you directly that I wanted to take you fishing like this, you'd feel...cornered. Pushed.” he admitted carefully. Dean took a moment to process what exactly Castiel meant.
“You seem in a good mood.” said Sam and chuckled in the direction of Eileen, who smiled innocently and set the salad bowl on the table.
“No, Dean. You quit. I've never started.” he corrected, and he immediately felt a bit like an ass, because it didn't really matter. Dean didn't want him to hunt. So he wouldn't.
“Cas...we should...” he said quietly, his voice rough from the tears. What should they do? He had no idea.
They headed down to the pier, their silence from the car still hanging heavily over them. Down by the lake Dean took a deep breath and looked around once more. He spotted a few people fishing.
“I'm hurt, brother. You don't recognize your own family anymore?” asked the other stranger and flashed him icy blue eyes, the shadows of his wings spreading across the wall. Castiel gulped. He wished he had at least a bit of his grace left, so that he could tell who these angels were.
"We thought that if we knew the conditions of that deal, it might help us find a way to counter it. I’ve read a book that-" she started enthusiastically.
"Dean, is that…is that the real you?" he asked cautiously, those blue eyes cutting straight into him. Dean nodded.
He is tall, alright. Not exactly ugly, but if Cas had a type, this Dean wouldn't be it. He has a stubble on his cheeks, not too different from his own, and his shirt is not ironed. Oh, and he's American.
"No, Dean, I won't. I’m tired of seeing you beating yourself about this. Cas has given his life for you and this is what you choose to do with it? Drink by day and wallow in self-pity by night?!" he continued, his voice steady. In part, he wanted to rile Dean up, but he also wanted to vent his own frustration. Cas was his friend, too. Dean just stared at him, knuckles on his hand holding the bottle turning white. He narrowed his eyes and Sam could have sworn he saw him shaking a bit.
. And if that didn’t feel surreal, then nothing ever would. It only took a few seconds to completely drain the angel. Or ex-angel, Dean thought as Cas closed the bottle, obviously unsure what to do with it. Dean tried to make his hand less shaky than it felt and grabbed Cas’s hand.
Dean closed the door and leaned against it, sighing. Sam said he couldn't join him and Cas on the trip to the lake because he was helping Eileen move in. Dean called bullshit. He walked over to his bed and sat down. What did Cas want to do at the lake anyway? It was too cold to swim. He pulled out his headphones and turned on music while he made a mental list of things he'd need to pack. Some food, beer, maybe bug spray? He had no idea what lake Cas was talking about. Or what the surroundings were.
“Why would we give up our only chess piece? Besides torturing you...” Asbeel winked at Dean, who didn't look amused.
“I’m Jody, by the way,” the woman continued, offering her hand to Cas. “I’m from the Douglas County sheriff’s office, and I’m coordinating this program with Donna." She pointed at the woman with blonde hair that had welcomed Cas.
“Yes, he’s very beautiful, and I enjoy looking at him. I guess I’d like to be close to him, emotionally speaking. But I do not feel any desire to have sex with him. I can’t even imagine it!”
“It means that at least he’s a little more civilized than you and your friends. His only conversation topic isn’t the list of people he’s had sex with!”
Stevie looked at him, and Charlie gave him an encouraging smile. Cas appreciated the fact that Stevie didn’t force him to speak by saying his name: they were letting him choose. Cas smiled back at Charlie and stood up. He hesitated a few seconds about whether he could turn around to face the others, but it was a little too much for him, so he stayed the way he was, facing the board and Charlie – who was sitting at the teacher’s desk – his back to the other students. He gave a questioning look to Charlie, to make sure it was okay, and she nodded. Cas took a big breath, and decided to start.
Cas had only known him for a week. And yet, he was already convinced that Dean was one of the most amazing human beings he ever met. So much for his plan of not falling for him…
“Dean! I know you already know how the program works, but maybe Castiel would like to hear the details, if you would let him listen,” Jody frowned.
He paused for a second. It was so strange to say it out loud, in front of ten other students – even though he wasn’t directly facing them, he was more than aware of their presence – strange, but good. He felt relieved, in a way, and was surprised to actually feel happy, and proud. He had said it, out loud, in front of an audience, finally! He couldn’t help but let a small nervous laugh escape. It felt really good, as if something that had used to be very heavy was leaving his chest.
Cas wondered how Dean knew Meg’s name, and what subject she was studying. According to Meg, she didn’t know him personally.
They shared a smile and a look, and Dean reached out to grab Cas’ hand. For someone who had spent half of his life flirting and having a series of one-night-stands, it was a simple gesture, but somehow, it felt extremely intimate. More intimate that any sex Dean ever had. It felt good, it felt right, and it felt as if they could stay like that forever. Except that Cas needed to sleep now, and clearly, the conversation they had had probably made him even more exhausted. Dean noticed how he was struggling to keep his eyes open.
Dean beamed at him. “Thanks Cas, you’re really the best,” he said with a wink, leaving them to take care of another child.
“I see. Well, I understand that you give more importance to your car than to me, especially now that I’m useless. Enjoy the rest of your meal, Dean”.
with him the day before was now sitting right next to him, involved in the same volunteer program. How was this possible?
“I'm not going to defend British cuisine, I am not enthusiastic about it either.” he says and opens his mouth to say something else, but then the door slides open and he straightens up at his post.
“The operator said your tickets are still valid, so you can take the regional train from Hauptbahnhof to Landshut and then catch your original train.” she explains. Dean checks something on his phone and bites his lip.
"So you were serious about that, huh?" Sam turned to Dean, who just walked through the door. At least he seemed steady on his feet. Sam was glad to see him, because it could only mean one thing.
“I don't know, how can you, Castiel?” he asked, his voice smooth and cold. As cold as the shivers that run down Castiel's spine as he heard his name. He took a step back, not letting either of the men from his sight.
thought Sam. He wanted Dean to get angry, to break and spill. He wanted to help him. So he continued, determined.
“You're as funny as I heard, Castiel. You're about to die and yet you only think of your evil little kid...” he said and took a step forward, ready to walk around the counter.
“Ottimo.” he responds and Dean laughs. His laugh is that kind of full, deep one, that seems to come from his very core.
It wasn't until later that he realized he never actually saw the stranger come in to the store. He tried to ignore the cold feeling seeping in his gut, arguing that he was unreasonably suspicious of a complete stranger who had happened to pass by. No reason to panic, he repeated to himself and glanced at the clock. Only fifteen minutes left to closing time. Then he could go home, where Dean was. And Sam and Eileen too, it was the first day of their visit. Only thirteen minutes.
“I'm Tamiel and this is Asbeel.” he said and Cas tried to remember if he knew Asbeel, but he didn't.
“I smell so bad.” he says and wipes the droplets of sweat from his forehead. Cas returns the grimace.
"I’m leaving and you can’t hold me here." he repeated. The Empty furrowed its eyebrows, scowling at them.
Cas develops a routine during following months. He find himself balancing his shifts and school schedule just fine, and he genuinely likes his job. Well, most of it. Becky can get a little annoying, as she is, nicely put, an ass licker, but she's also capable and nice to chat with. He's also often paired with a girl named Bela, who somehow manages to trick customers into thinking that she's genuinely interested in their London experiences, while turning to Cas badmouth them as soon the lift door closes. And then there's Dean.
"What are you talking about..?" he asked instead. Sam grinned just a little and proceeded to tell him about an old spell he got from Jack, the ingredients he gathered, and a portal it would open.
