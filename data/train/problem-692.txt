by his side, he believes that anything's possible. That they can get through anything.
The older man shot up instantly, looking around the room until his eyes fell upon the curly haired detective in the doorway.
"None of the cases are good enough John. They're all threes or fours. Boring. Dull"
A week after they had been called initially, Sherlock had decided to run after a suspect by himself. This wasn't unusual, but it terrified John. Luckily, the detective had managed to walk away without being killed despite the minor injuries grazing his body.
"Alright"
If he played the same song every night, no one needed to know.
"Sherlock?"
Instead of playing for John's nightmares now, he played for his own. Plagued by all the ways he fucked up their relationship, even if John didn't love him.
"You mean hugging"
John frowned, looking around before laying down next to the detective.
And as the setting sun casts a beautiful golden orange glow across Sherlock's skin, John believes that he's found the definition of perfect. And he's gonna hold it in his arms forever.
"John?"
"John?" Why was he awake? And when did he come downstairs?
John laughed and handed the detective a mug before dishing up 2 full English breakfasts. He watched Sherlocks face morph from one of indifference to one of disgust.
"Yes Sherlock?"
"Hmm?"
"Yes Sherlock?"
"But you said-"
Sherlock, apparently.
"Sherlock, just go to sleep love. We can talk about experiments or whatever in the morning"
In the morning, Sherlock woke to the smell of Bacon. Before he even opened his eyes, he could feel John's blanket over him, and he felt at home. Comfortable. Happy. He stored these feelings away in his mind palace for later. Upon opening his eyes, he was greeted by a cheerful John Watson, sipping tea whilst cooking, oblivious to the stirring behind him. Obviously Rosie is still sleeping, Sherlock thought.
John looked down at Sherlock to see him sharing a small, genuine smile. As Sherlock looked up, they both stared into each others eyes. Colours of blue swirling in their visions, and they didn't know how or when, but their lips met in a flurry of emotions. The kiss showed love and care that was unspoken. Just the sheer happiness of being with each other. They never deepened it. They didn't have to. The gentle press of lips against lips spoke volumes of what they never could.
"Stay?"
"Sherlock?"
"Mgh..."
"I'm fine right here."
"Sherlock?"
Tonight was a particularly bad night. John was having a nightmare about the Hound, and actually needed soothing before going to bed (which Sherlock was NOT good at.) At some point, he had come down to make some tea and saw the detective playing his violin by the window.
"Hmm?"
"Go to sleep!"
"Sitting in a hospital with you attached to an IV is dull. Now eat"
So he played more and more.
"They are dumb! Idiots! The guy you're looking for is
He had underestimated how much the fall would impact his friend. He didn't expect John to hate him as much as he did.
Once they got back home Sherlock started to cook the meat while Rosie was tasked with putting all of the groceries away. Somehow she had convinced him to get the ingredients for brownie sundaes…he just could not say no to her puppy dog eyes!
“Ohhhkay Sherlock. Can you make me mac and cheese?” a drowsy Rosie mumbled between yawns.
Somehow, despite all of their cooking, they had extra time before John was expected home. Being an exceptional daughter, Rosie went around dusting the flat…but not before she sneak attacked Sherlock with feather tickles! As Rosie dusted, Sherlock vacuumed and tried to straighten everything up. Again, he realized just how much John (…and Mrs. Hudson) did for him. Without John he would be living in disorganized chaos, he would have to repay the man somehow. Perhaps he could start doing some chores around the house himself. Heck, if Rosie can dust how hard can it be?
“Come on Rosie, use your detective skills! What do you think I will get” he teases.
At this, John smiled widely. Sherlock almost never makes him coffee in the morning. Perhaps Sherlock was being honest last night when he promised to be on his best behavior.
"I do," John said with a grin. "And I will. But it's a gorgeous day and it's been a long time since lunch. I'd like to see some of Paris and have something to eat – preferably at the same time. I'm willing to bet a detective with an international reputation knows a few places that fit that bill."
Mycroft gazed at the report on his desk, expression blank only from years of practice. Internally, the storm was kept at bay simply because he had no desire to feel it, but if he’d let himself, the anger – the
"So you
protect the life of someone she worked with.
With a soft groan, John pushed himself out of bed, stretching slightly in a vain attempt to dislodge all the aches and pains that came from living overnight in an ICU ward. The shower and the nap in his own bed had helped, but he still felt disconnected from reality, like he'd taken a step to the side and was only watching normal life happen around him.
There would be nowhere to hide. Not now. Not this time.
"You would," Sherlock interjected blithely, as if John risking an entire hospital's worth of patients wasn't an issue. It bothered John that Sherlock was right – but it shouldn't really surprise him, he thought. He'd shot someone to save Sherlock after knowing the detective for a single day.
Sherlock landed in his chair with a faint grunt of surprise; John straddled him before he had time to catch up, tilting his head back until it was almost touching the cushion, and ran his fingers through short curls, feeling the slide of clean hair against his skin. Over and over until the meticulous styling was undone and Sherlock's hair was like a dark, soft halo around his head. John gave a quick tug; Sherlock caught his lower lip between his teeth, stifling a sound.
"He's French," the detective muttered.
know someone named Michael and we
If it came to that, Mary had contingencies. She'd doubled her usual number of back-up plans, ensuring she'd walk away from this without any damage to herself – and, if possible, to her brother.
Tearing his eyes away, John looked up at the bridge through the near darkness.
"'Morning, love," he greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. She smiled back at him, ruffling his perfectly styled hair, but he didn't mind. It gave him a touch of a messy look that reminded everyone he dealt with that he was much younger than them but still had so much more power.
"She's a doctor, she never–"
“I’m sorry,” he said. And meant it.
"Sir?" one of the officers said.
26 June
“A bit,” Mary said. “Not as much as I’d like, maybe, but I try.”
"You've just decided that a pillow makes a good fashion accessory?"
Donovan cast a quick glance at Lestrade who raised his eyebrows wearily in return.
Perhaps more disappointed were her personal clients – Aaron's birth had necessitated she step back from that business for a while. The physical reasons weren't the most compelling but certainly played a part. There were ways around those, if she'd wanted to take them, but her body was as much a weapon in her arsenal as was her mind, and she wanted to ensure it stayed sharp.
Those were the clients who took the least amount of effort, and there was always one or two available at any given moment, should she need them to be.
"A private hospital would–"
Sherlock moved past him, as if to return to work, then spun back fast.
He doubted it had been stolen.
"That's not all of it," Sherlock said darkly. "Jim knows something."
John rolled his eyes and slipped the phone back into his pocket.
he snapped at himself, sudden anger burning brightly again before flaring out, leaving resigned exhaustion in its wake. John slumped a bit in his chair, still staring at the clear liquid in his glass. Why should he be fair? He could hardly ask that question without also feeling guilt buried beneath it.
It was moved away, the air cooler against his skin. He hummed when the strawberry was pressed against a nipple, gasping when Sherlock's lips closed around the nub, sucking gently. His fingers found Sherlock's hair, lacing into it and gripping, and he felt a smile against his skin before the tip of Sherlock's tongue darted out. John grunted, arching up, as teeth sank in, tugging.
While John put on the kettle, Sherlock catalogued the way he moved. Each small press of buttons, or setring down a mug. Why did it fascinate him so much?
"Sherlock, you know I love you right?"
John took the other mans face in his hands and connected their lips once again. Sherlock found his hands in John's hair and on his back as the kiss slowly deepened. He closed his eyes, feeling the boredom leave and the negative thoughts wash away. That was until they heard loud crying from the room upstairs.
Ah. This is what John loves- the domestic feeling of post-case adrenaline. Sherlock is taking care of himself (to some degree), not bored, just laughing smiling and being himself. And so is John. They are here together and they just live. They just exist to be in each others company and the outside world could stop for a while.
Sherlock leans into John's touch as he runs his hand over Sherlocks cheek. As much as he'll deny it, Sherlock really loves the intimacy of cuddling.
Sherlock soon realised that after the fall, John's nightmares had become increasingly worse. He knew John barely got any sleep and would jolt awake screaming his name.
"You know what? I want you to ride me. Would you do that for me, John?"
„Sometimes I wonder that too.“ John dropped down on the end of the couch.
„She would be fo pwoud seeing you twy that hard.“
„Get it.“, he managed to breath out. A few seconds passed. Then with one quick movement Sherlock pulled him down towards him and snatched the marshmallows from John’s lips, touching them slightly with his own. Sherlock chewed it down but realized that what he actually wanted was the doctor right above him.
"Harder, Sherlock, I want to feel it all!" Sherlock thrusted into him fast and violently, moving his hips into John and hit his prostate repeatedly. With several loud moans he came into Sherlock’s hand that was rubbing him off with strong, elegant fingers. John’s cum was all over Sherlock‘s chest. But Sherlock didn’t stop thrusting, he was also close again and John kept on clenching around his cock, fully taking him in hot and moist, moving up and down. Slaps of skins filled the air and Sherlock‘s moans that became louder and louder until he bulked up, beautiful like a greek sculpture, thrusted deep into John and let out another shot of cum, groaning softly with every movement. John moved down from Sherlock and gave his cock a few loving strokes until he collapsed beside Sherlock. They layed in each other´s arms only bliss on their minds. Sherlock kissed John´s head and stroked his heavily breathing chest.
„I want more.“, he whispered and pulled John into a soft kiss. Sweet like a dream and better than anything he had ever felt. John pressed his chest against Sherlock‘s, enjoying his firm grip. One hand held John’s back as to make sure he didn’t back off. Of course that was highly unnecessary; nothing in the world could make him move away from that perfect body, that was for sure. John climbed onto sherlock who was lying on his back and sat on him full weight. John sensed a twitch right beneath him and also felt heat filling up his own body in certain spaces. Sherlock breathed in sharply and took John’s hand, interlocking their fingers. With the other one he took hold of John‘s neck and pulled him down a second time with a longing John didn’t know rested inside his flatmate. Their lips met and it was a pure sensation of heat and tingling, and a bit of marshmallow. Then their tongues met. Their kiss was like electricity; the tension of years and years suddenly released. Sherlock couldnt get enough. They were hungry and starving for the body of the other.
Sherlock looked confused by this sudden non sequitur, eyes narrowing slightly as he appeared to scan John’s words for some hidden meaning.
John frowned then felt the muscles in his face relax with shock.
"Careful," the doctor admonished. Sherlock just huffed and settled down again but kept his eyes open. John watched him carefully – they'd spent a lot of time the past four days curled up together, mostly because it made Sherlock feel better. But they hadn't done a lot of talking other than Monday evening and part of Tuesday. In a way, John was glad to get some space from it – he didn't want to hash it out endlessly any more than Sherlock did, but they couldn't avoid it forever. He had no desire to fall back into old patterns and let this happen all over again.
John sucked in a deep breath, repressing that fear mercilessly, and focused on his partner’s voice and on getting to him.
"Then I'll tell you. That
He looked mildly surprised and glanced down at himself, at the bandages that were visible under the blankets and hospital-issue pyjamas.
John's lips twitched and he resisted commenting; the first few nights
Just like he'd see a significant difference between a man falling into the river from a bridge and surviving and a man falling onto the road from a bridge and dying.
"It's been stolen and resold several times or maybe he's just an idiot and put it in the wrong safe or binned it with the rest of the rubbish."
John was still dressed, having swapped his short-sleeved button down shirt for a t-shirt, but still in jeans, feet bare. He wouldn't disrobe any more, Sherlock knew, not now. No matter how uncomfortable it might make him. John left the door open, his concession to his clothing, and probably in no small part to let the chill become slightly uncomfortable for Sherlock, who was wearing nothing at all.
"Which one?"
“Of course not,” Sherlock replied. “It suits Mr. Scott.”
"You can't hire just anyone, John. I would think that would be obvious."
, John."
"All the more reason to go back!" Sherlock insisted. "There's nothing for us here!"
Sherlock stared at him as if he'd grown another head, irritation flaring in his grey eyes. John knew he'd likely lose to work – a full weekend off was rare for Sherlock, but there was no reason John should spend it on his own.
Sherlock nodded once, grey eyes flickering back to the curtain before glancing pleadingly back at John.
Sam nodded and Sandra rose, pausing when he snagged her hand and pressing a kiss against the backs of her fingers.
Eight years.
"Someone else clearly had access to this information," Mary observed. Any surprise she might have felt at the revelation – or any frustration at not having found Georges herself – was utterly absent from her tone. Sherlock glanced at John again, wondering if the level voice belied the same sort of reaction on the other end of the line.
"No," Sherlock murmured. "It doesn't."
"God, John," Sherlock managed, voice deep and quiet. John bit his own lip, hard, to keep himself from succumbing to his husband's baritone, and kept going until Sherlock was moaning steadily, fingernails digging into the skin between John's shoulder blades.
Sherlock drew a deep breath, letting it out slowly.
Absurdly, he realized he still had his wallet and his phone. He could just call Sherlock. He wasn't aware he'd been moving but there was a smooth pressure on his chin suddenly, gloved hand forcing his head back, searing the raw patch on his skull to the wall.
His muscles caught up before his brain did, aware that the woman – not Bridget – in front of him was moving to take advantage of his shock.
He wanted to let himself believe that it wouldn’t change how he saw Sherlock, but he knew it would, and could admit that to himself with a private scowl. Because what he knew now only touched the edges, and he hadn’t even learned that until after they’d been together for several months. It
"I am. Obviously," Sherlock sniffed.
Sherlock waited for John to chime in with an 'I told you so' but the mental voice was mercifully silent this time.
one debt she did owe, however.
He was in the kitchen one morning, his body having taken him there out of habit, and then habit evaporated, leaving him standing at the counter, staring at the cupboards, utterly at a loss. The kettle had boiled, but Sherlock didn’t remember the next steps, completely stymied by a simple task he couldn’t recall.
2 June
"You're a bit whiffy. Must be from crawling around tunnels for hours."
"You're clearly researching dog adoption organizations."
“Does it now?”
She knew that name, although not from personal experience. Not directly.
"Your ideas about sex in relationships have always included some sort of emotional attachment because you are a sentimentalist, John. Charles and I were both very clear on what we wanted from the other at the outset. Neither of us was interested in emotional complications."
"You're on."
He wished there was some way of verifying this externally, but the thought of asking anyone else was appalling. Mycroft was entirely out, and Gabriel would probably ask some inappropriately probing and astute questions.
They had been extraordinarily lucky. A wrong step, bad weather, more serious injuries… Sherlock was no stranger to skirting death – he'd thrown himself off a building, plan or no plan – but that… A situation beyond his experience. Beyond Lestrade's. Not entirely beyond John's, but John had been alone.
"You wouldn't let me."
Sam looked worse than Sherlock had ever seen him. He was bordering on being as pale as the detective himself, his face and lips almost completely colourless. Dark rings of purple curved under dim green eyes, his cheeks seemingly sunken and shadowed. His light brown hair was clean but not styled; unusual. He stood with his hands in the front pockets of his jeans and despite not slouching or hunching his shoulders, his posture betrayed tension, fatigue, and reluctance. Even a quick glance would have told Sherlock that Sam was not sleeping properly. A more detailed examination suggested he was relying heavily on his sleeping medication, which meant he was suffering from nightmares. He was also not keeping up with his regular exercise routine. Sherlock knew Sam was an avid runner but he had the look of someone who was suffering enforced immobility. Sherlock doubted Sam could have handled the physical activity right now, not if he was sleeping poorly.
"Either one of them, I'm not sure which. Some bizarre sentimentality on the Woman's part? Coincidence on Mary's part?"
He shifted off of Sherlock carefully, watching his husband's face to make sure he didn't wake up. Sherlock stirred a bit, but only enough to settle down more and bring his right hand up to bunch into his pillow. John smiled slightly. He fetched a light blanket from their linen closet, since Sherlock was pinning their sheets and duvet under his body, and covered him with it to keep him from getting cold. As sick as he'd been and as thin as he was, he'd probably need the extra warmth even in the August heat.
"Not that it really made much difference," she muttered without intending to, taken aback by the bitterness in her own voice. The immediate aghast apology – because if it didn't matter, that meant everything Sherlock had suffered had been pointless, and
"You do realize you don't get to remove any of that?" he asked.
John took the cup instinctively, glancing up at Sherlock, who was watching him sharply, grey eyes still ringed by black bruises.
And, John realized suddenly, he couldn't do it.
"Mm," John sighed, "yeah, I think they will."
"And you'd have been wrong," Sherlock agreed with a nod. "But you would have picked either of those options and you would have carried investigating regardless."
upright and breathing. Both of you. And for mine, too, frankly. I don't want to be back on duty tonight."
"Arthur Kenton. Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs."
When John got home, the flat was dark and silent. He clicked on a light and glanced around; Sherlock's coat was hanging on the back of the door, so he wasn't out. There were no yellow notes peppered about the flat this time – although the memory made him smile – so he assumed his husband was downstairs helping Mrs. Hudson with something. He was just about to head down to check when Sherlock's voice came ringing up the stairs.
"Here's a lovely one," Claire said. "Jenny and Lucy in the Christmas pageant when they were ten."
"St. Jean," she said crisply, moving her coffee cup aside so as not to knock it over.
have been in the building – but odds are it wasn't even you. A partial match means some of the points they use to determine fingerprints are the same but not all of them. Fingerprints are unique to each person but they're also very complex."
Sherlock stared at John, lips parted, eyes wide. He managed to shake his head once – that wasn't it. Didn't John understand?
"Want help with your shoes?" he asked, out of habit. When the cast had come off, replaced by a thin brace, Sherlock had still found it difficult to bend over comfortably to unlace his shoes. He could do it easily enough sitting down, but John suspected his husband enjoyed having someone do the work for him.
He felt his stomach clench, then one of his hands.
"You can stay out here and stew about it if you want, but I'm done with the subject, and I'm going to bed. Good night."
"Slow down," John said. "I may be a doctor but I don't want to have to do the Heimlich on you. It could break your ribs and land you in hospital."
"You on the other hand…" Mycroft murmured.
Shorter. Sorry, mate.
"I haven't done anything to my hair," Sherlock snapped, grip tightening on the pillow.
, Sherlock. You need to let them take him."
His flashlight caught something suddenly, two figures almost blended into one, neither of them making sense until they resolved themselves into Sherlock, limp and supported by Alexandre Georges.
"He was quite upset, you know."
"John!" Sherlock shouted at him as John slipped into the cab and shut the door with a hard click. "John!"
"I'm not interested in sharing," John assured him.
Now, John hoped he hadn't kept it for the same reasons he'd kept the cufflinks, the ticket stubs and the photograph.
It didn't change the fact that he'd never intended to tell John at all.
Like almost everyone there, they had endured rumours about them. John hadn't really cared – let people think what they wanted. In the way of any small group whose members were forcibly and necessarily confined with each other, there was talk, there were rows, there were out-and-out battles. But there were also friendships, fleeting, lasting, tenuous, solid. He considered himself lucky – in Tricia he had found a friend he would keep for life, an extended family member who was unrelated by genetics but related in all the ways that really mattered.
They said their goodbyes and John headed for the lift, thoughts of home nudging for his attention, debating a cab versus the tube. Each visit with Doe only seemed to reinforce what
John drew another deep breath before letting it out slowly.
How stupid had he been?
ideas you've ever had, this one
But the only outward indication were the dreams that occasionally disturbed Sherlock’s sleep.
dead,” Sherlock said, tone still calm, belying the rage below, the indignation, the sudden urgency to deal with this
"Yes, and we'd expect them to leave footprints as well – and they would expect us to expect that. These are clever men – balance of probability for their sex – who orchestrated a very elaborate exchange without being detected until it was far too late. They would know that we'd find this, eventually."
"I was wondering when you'd get here. Dad thought you'd be waiting when he woke up, ready to ask all sorts of questions."
"We have to go.
How could he continue like this, with his mind so willing to sabotage him? How would he be able to take on cases if, without warning, all the connections would shatter, leaving him lost and bewildered, not knowing where to go next or how to get there?
"Then let me do my job. I'm certain the doctors would tell you that your priority is to rest and recover." He gave Mycroft a small, tight smile. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. Information from Anthea. I mean it."
Sherlock froze in the midst of hailing a cab, caught in a suspended moment in which a habitual action was disrupted. His mind stuttered, protesting the interruption, sending a surge of unexpected anger through him.
," Sherlock said, scowling when he spat out the last word. "Weddings, babies… They've all gone mad."
"Right. I'm going down to the cafeteria. Want anything?"
Relief trickled in as Sherlock’s breathing began to slow, the panicked look ebbing from his features. John kept up his slow breathing until he was sure Sherlock was out of danger, before he let himself relax very carefully, on alert for any changes.
He wondered how much of it Sherlock had already seen – had the detective actually looked through her phone? Even that idea had set John on edge; he curled his hands into fists and reminded himself that Sherlock had shown little inclination for anything like this in the past, and that he'd
The harsh, protracted moment before he'd been able to curl his hands into the heavy fabric of Sherlock's coat, half certain the illusion would vanish like mist, leaving him with nothing.
"What?" Lestrade asked, earning an aggrieved sigh, Sherlock's fingers drumming impatiently against the wall.
"Yes, of course," Sherlock managed, casting a befuddled look at John, as if the doctor had the answers he didn't.
And if anything had happened to John, she would pay.
Sherlock held John's gaze levelly, forcing his fingers not curl into fists against his legs.
He moved. No pain. Not true – he ached. His back, his shoulders. But not real pain. The movement brought twinges only, not the searing agony it had then, forced to stand, to walk, to act normally when every step verged on collapse, made death seem preferable.
"A friend," John said firmly.
jealous, but had never particularly been keen on coincidence like that; London was a big city and it wasn't common to simply run into people one knew.
"Sherlock," John sighed. "Good night, Mycroft. Thank you for the tree."
Bannerjee shrugged.
She rattled off a reply and John was pretty sure he picked up a couple of French curses in there. Sherlock's lips twitched, pulling back into the beginnings of a snarl, then he made his features relax again. When Veronique drew a breath, John interjected:
"But not entitlement," John said, giving his head a shake. "'Claim' would be a better word."
John reached across the table and squeezed her hand likely, shaking his head.
"Trainers," David said decisively, giving a brief nod that was far too reminiscent of his uncle. By some quirk of genetics, David looked more like Sherlock than anyone else – which was, of course, to say that he looked Sibyl, but the resemblance to Sherlock was more apparent to Mycroft, who remembered his brother very well as a child.
There was a change in John's breathing, a sigh that carried disappointment. Sherlock's heart twisted; he'd made another mistake. Before he could answer, John rolled onto his back, then shifted carefully onto his left side, adjusting his pillows to take some of the weight from his left shoulder.
"He comes in here sometimes – at least he used to. Haven't seen him in two or three weeks."
"You," he said when Sherlock leaned down to kiss him lightly, "are a secret sentimentalist."
"I think it's the other way around," he said. "We were already involved when we came to Paris. This is… this is what Sherlock does. You shouldn't have been dragged into it."
"I'm rather encumbered at the moment."
Bridget sighed, spreading her hands.
"Tell me where he is."
Sam grunted but leaned forward enough to allow John to brace him. He put his arm around John's shoulders as instructed, his expression carefully closed as he did so.
"I suspected," Sherlock corrected.
"I am. But we can't let London's criminal underworld get too comfortable. And we don't want to be out of practice, do we?"
Sherlock sighed and gave him a pointed look, but John held his gaze until he saw the faint flicker of expression that meant the detective was relenting for him.
John thought.
John looked down again quickly and checked the body for bruising, needle- or ligature marks or any other signs he'd been hurt or held before being killed.
But it had been John who had pushed him back out into the world, who had made him take the case, who kept him focussed when nothing else would.
Once he may have asked his mother for advice.
And now Hayes was dead and Riley was in the hospital. The two men Sherlock had apprehended weren't talking according to Donovan. John wondered if their fingerprints were on file from Healy's murder twelve years ago.
"John," Sherlock said, his voice reaching the doctor as though from a distance, and John was tugged back more sharply by the feel of fingers curling around his tense, fisted ones. Sherlock pried the bottle from him, eyed it critically. "I give it thirteen days, at best."
Sam shook his head without looking at John and toed his shoes off himself, kicking them aside. John sat back in a crouch, nudging the coffee table aside a bit. He kept himself slightly distanced from Sam, allowing the younger man to have some space. John knew the last thing he needed was to be touched any more than necessary or to feel like he was being crowded. At least here there were no jostling throngs, no constant noise.
“Irene’s probably come up with the same plan,” Gabriel continued. “And if I asked Charles what he thinks you’d do, he’d say exactly this, too, because – let’s be honest – both of you are a little bit insane.”
Josephine, nearly lost in the lab coat Sherlock had bought for her, was perched at the kitchen table, listening intently to something bubbling away in a beaker with the child sized stethoscope she'd received from John himself. For a moment, John wondered if he ought to be concerned – Sherlock had done a good job training Josephine to be careful around his chemicals, but she
A couple of disaffected techs were working down the hall on Sarraf's computer; the DI wondered if Sherlock had kicked them out or if they'd opted not to work with the prickly genius.
John’s more clever readers (but oddly enough, not John himself) will be asking themselves why a woman carrying out an affair with a business rival would risk being found out through emails and text messages, and why she wouldn’t simply approach Marianne Maberley under the guise of being an associate who needed to reclaim proprietary information.
5 July
"Please–" Sherlock gasped, and John couldn't stop himself anymore, setting a hard, fast pace that he matched with his hand. He wasn't sure he could last but oh, he wanted to see Sherlock break down completely, face pressed into the pillows, the end of each panting gasp breaking on a sob as John pounded into him, stroking quickly. Sherlock was shaking his head, trying to move, hindered by the restraints and John's body. John scrabbled at the last of his self control, tasting blood as he bit his lower lip.
"And had you been listening to me, you'd have heard that I acknowledged that," Sherlock said, his voice suddenly icy, his expression locked down, hard.
"Happens a lot to you, does it?" John asked.
And not because he'd clearly helped himself to the unopened packet of biscuits John had bought just the other day, or the way he'd commandeered one of Mrs. Hudson's best tea cups and saucers to enjoy a cuppa while seated in Sherlock's chair – or even really the fact that he'd waltzed in while they were away, as if he had the right.
"You must have some way of contacting her," he insisted.
"No–" He reached for Sherlock, desperate fingers clutching at whatever they could, as the detective moved away. Sherlock smirked, skimming a finger up John's erection as he reached for the strawberries, settling the bowl against the side of the doctor's hip. The cool porcelain gave John something to focus on – but that focal point didn't help when Sherlock drizzled a line of chocolate carefully over John's aching cock.
"Uncle John!" Olivia cried joyfully, snagging John's hand as David gave his order. "Look! It's Mary!"
"We'll come back later," Donovan assured him, but doubted he'd heard her. His good eye had drifted shut and his breathing had slowed. She glanced at Lestrade, who nodded. They followed Morris out the door and Donovan gave instructions to the constable keeping guard and to the nurses on the ward to call her on her mobile should he remember anything.
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock!" John protested, stepping toward the bed fast, wrapping his hands around the detective's wrists. Sherlock's eyes snapped up to him and there was so much rage in them that John let go without thinking, taking half a step back. Sherlock's lips twitched, fighting down a snarl. The doctor stood immobile for a moment, too shocked to react. He'd never seen that much anger in Sherlock's expression before.
"Why am I even here if you don't want me to work, Lestrade?" he spat. Lestrade's eyes flickered to John, who was probably making some sort of conciliatory gesture, then back to Sherlock. He searched the detective's face, looking for something. Sherlock kept his expression neutral, making sure Lestrade didn't find it.
“Yeah,” John said, closing his eyes briefly and cursing his own stupidity. “Sherlock– Christ. I’m sorry. I just thought– I needed something to do and I thought her clothes… Neither of us can use them, and there are people who can.”
To see what kind of surprise it was – shock that Richard would turn up after all this time, or shock that Richard would turn up at all, because he was supposed to be dead.
"So would he. Why not take it on himself?"
It would certainly explain a lot.
"And what would you have me do, John?" Sherlock said. "Stop investigating?"
John took a deep breath, slipped the handcuffs from his pocket and plucked the notebook from Sherlock's surprised fingers at the same time. When the detective reached instinctively for it, John snapped a cuff around a thin wrist, moving to reach around Sherlock quickly enough that the detective couldn't tense completely in resistance.
"You– you think he– you didn't take it with you?"
"Well," Sherlock said crisply, making sure his tone boarded on annoyed, "you know about this now – and you certainly know John won't allow me to take the medication again, not without his permission and not without him administering it. If at all."
"Yeah, right," John muttered.
"I was an army surgeon. I'm used to smells."
"This is more important," John snapped.
“Oh Christ,” John managed, and folded in on himself, sinking to the floor, one hand gripping the counter as if it might keep him up, or perhaps as some sort of lifeline. Sherlock had crossed the kitchen and crouched down in front of John almost before he was aware of moving, far more focussed on his partner’s body than his own. John was breathing hard – too hard, beginning to hyperventilate, shoulders heaving, hands shaking visibly.
"I don't think I was wearing one on the bridge," Sam said.
a person. He can hardly be missing if you know where he is."
"Come on, girl," he said quietly. "Let's go home."
"Anything familiar," the detective replied. "Anything referring to her or anyone connected to her."
“Why is that least likely?”
"What is it?" Sherlock asked.
John shifted so that he could better see Sherlock and the detective felt the doctor's brown eyes searching his face.
"Thanks," Donovan said.
John knew what had woken him the moment he blinked his eyes open in the unfamiliar darkness. That small combination of sensations that spelled
"Probably not for finding you, but it's one more thing you know about yourself. Actually, can I see your hands?"
"Eat," she ordered in a voice that brooked no argument. Her medical voice. John had one of those. Sherlock stared at the plate. "Sherlock, eat, please. I'm going to go finish making up the dough for these scones and then you're going to tell me what happened. Eat
"No! No, John, that kind of thing wouldn't be forgotten! Not if it was her husband! Would you forget a thing like that?"
"I'll be up all night anyway," she pointed out.
"I know," John said. Sherlock had been entirely focused on John in that very deliberate way he had when he was ignoring something else for the doctor's benefit. It made Sherlock no less attentive – in some ways, it made him more so, because the effort seemed to overcome his inherent laziness – but John could always tell the difference.
"Myself?" his partner suggested.
Brown eyes flickered across the table, John's gaze very clearly challenging him:
, he thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stayed still, reluctant to wake Sherlock. He knew this was partly because he didn't really want to have the conversations they needed to have, but also because Sherlock desperately needed the sleep. John couldn't tell how long his husband had been out – he had obviously shaved that morning and his clothing looked fairly fresh, so he'd been awake at some point. He was wearing the purple shirt John loved so much and black trousers with matching black shoes and socks. Sherlock had been expecting – something. John just didn't know what. Had Sherlock known he was going to come home? Or had he been preparing just in case?
After breakfast – which was surprisingly good – Sam took John up on his offer to use the shower and emerged feeling even more human. He was amazed what simply being clean and fed could do – but it was more than just that. Something about listening to the music that had been playing on the bridge had changed things. He'd been afraid it would be a trigger and cause another flashback. It had opened a flood of memories but he'd stayed in the present, in Sherlock's flat, through all of them.
"Eyes closed," Sherlock murmured. John obeyed with a slight smile, feeling the mattress shift as Sherlock moved away slightly. There was an unidentifiable sound and John gasped, eyes flying open, at the sudden sting as salt came into contact with broken capillaries.
He kept a snarl to himself, letting it out as short, sharp huff instead, surrounded by the silence of his office. His hand had reached for his mobile more than once of his own accord; each time, he snatched it back, determined not to lose another moment's focus.
"It has its moments," John agreed.
"Fine," John muttered, dumping the soggy towels in the tub to retrieve later for the laundry. They'd have to have a little talk about personal responsibilities when Sherlock got home – although he was sure it would fall on deliberately deaf ears.
"And?" Harry asked.
"Of course not!" John shouted back. "Of course you're bloody not because of all the
No answer. John groaned as he rolled onto his back again, listening intently. The flat was silent and still – and not the kind of stillness that indicated Sherlock was at home and absorbed in something.
"Brilliant!" the detective murmured, the grin still tugging on his lips. John felt a flash of shock course through him, followed by sudden lightheaded feeling.
Sherlock nodded towards bed and John sat down, taking care not to rush. The deliberateness of Sherlock's movements warned him against it, and he knew he'd be in for a long wait. Sherlock's patient moments were still rare, and John made a point of enjoying them.
"I need to get you cleaned up." Plush lips pursed then released immediately, and Sherlock gave a small, pained sigh that bordered on a whimper. The bruise on his upper lip was already turning a violent purple, stained with blood from the accompanying cut and dried blood from his nose. John kept his own expression as neutral possible as he dabbed the blood away with a warm flannel.
"The pattern is violence, Doctor Watson. And he's at the centre of it."
Behind him, Bridget raised her eyebrows and tucked her hands into the pockets of her jeans. She'd regained her confidence with admirable speed, a trait Sherlock suspected was crucial in her official line of work.
"Well that's just bloody brilliant, isn't it? She has Adler's– information, Adler has her brother, they've both managed to have the people linking this all together killed! It's– it's–"
," he tried. It sounded wrong and the flash of irritation on Sherlock's face almost made him laugh.
"Your health is far more important."
"You know what was taken," Sherlock said.
Frustration faded quickly to uncertainty. This was too close to the anger that had been directed his way when he'd returned to London. The sudden fear that he'd regained everything he'd lost only to see it slip away again made the words stick in Sherlock's throat.
"You lie all the time," John replied.
And often enough, it
"Sir, I need you to open your eyes, sir. Someone get a gurney, please! Sir, open your eyes. Look at me."

"What does your name say about you?"
It was easier, now, to read beneath what she wanted him to see. The rage helped, the memory of scouring an empty darkness, each passing moment without John becoming more and more suffocating.
"Yes," he said curtly.
“And I’m already dressed.”
Nor had imagined he'd ever be able to say that he had a holiday villa on the Mediterranean in southern France. He had never imagined he'd say he sort of worked for the police. He had never imagined that, when introducing his spouse, he'd say "this is my husband…"
"England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom. Ireland is independent. Sorry, this probably isn't making much sense to you at the moment…"
And Gabriel Mitchell was just enough of a pressure point for Sherlock Holmes to turn his gaze away from John Watson enough to let her do what she needed to.
“Anyway,” John said as Sherlock conscientiously opened the front door for him as the cab pulled back into traffic, “you don’t need the Met to hack into the CCTV cameras, and it’ll give you something to do.”
She shook her head, the movement little more than the shifting of her chin against his shoulder.
don't have to worry about Sarah. Or, rather, you can worry about Sarah all you want, but you don't have to worry about me."
He tidied and cleaned to keep himself moving, to occupy a mind that threatened to distract him with a dozen
With effort born of long practice, he found a calm centre, letting it expand until the sensation was bearable, if not gone altogether. Still, the edges of his mind buzzed, echoed by the tingling in the tips of his fingers. He paced the length of his office and back; it made little difference once he stopped moving.
"I need to go," he said. "Get some rest."
to shreds until there was nothing else left, nothing but the hammering in his head, in his ears–
to pick a fight, which was so unusual for him that he had forced himself up the stairs and sat on the bed, arms folded, legs crossed, feeling even angrier.
John shrugged lightly.
Lestrade hadn’t expected Mitchell to bring someone close to him along. He raised his eyebrows at the appearance of a young blond woman – Mitchell’s fiancée, Lestrade knew from his more up-to-date information. Mitchell introduced them pleasantly enough, but Lestrade had been a cop for a long time – bringing Sandra Casey along hadn’t been Mitchell’s idea and he wasn’t entirely thrilled by it.
"Sit down," John sighed. Sherlock folded his legs, sinking down to his knees, and John rolled his eyes.
"Looks like something broad with an edge – not a hammer or the butt of a gun."
"I just agreed we're not talking about it," John interrupted. "Now get up."
"Well I came from somewhere else, right?"
"Why?" Josephine asked, perched on the edge of a couch cushion.
Sandra hesitated, then shook her head.
"Admittedly, an lapse in–"
There was a pause, before Sherlock cleared his throat quietly.
“Ah,” John said. “You’re taking me on a romantic holiday then?”
And, he realized abruptly, he didn’t trust Sherlock and Irene together.
"Can you tell me what you do remember?"
"Several weeks, I should imagine," Sherlock commented, leading John towards the front of the house. "Or it's been turned on for brief periods of time. Someone's been taking care of this place."
Emergency treatment was one thing, but a man like Holmes wouldn’t stand for having the physical reminders of his captivity slashed across his body.
"We're in Paris, in the summer, and without a case. And I don't know about you, but after being lost and stranded in Wales for three days, I think we've both earned a bit of a break."
"When we get home," Sherlock replied.
He had no desire to abandon her up here – there was no guarantee that Adler would bother sending anyone to rescue her – but he needed enough time to get to Sherlock.
So far he'd managed with the basics because they weren't hard. She had food and water. She had a place to sleep. He and Sandra had taken her on a long walk the previous day and played with her for a bit in a nearby park. It seemed fairly straightforward.
threatened to undermine everything, to strip away his concentration, leaving him with nothing.
"And when will that be?" Mycroft asked dryly.
"And I made a promise to save it. Two people can get in where twenty cannot. Especially the two of us. Especially here."
"These tunnels are obviously used," Hassard pointed out.
John managed a dry chuckle.
"Don't think this gets you off the hook if you do something stupid," Hassard warned, but pocketed the money without any further protest.
"Excellently observed," his partner murmured, a small smile playing on his lips, a familiar gleam in his grey eyes. John drew another deep breath to keep himself composed, firming his military stance even more. "I suspect you'll have ample opportunity to collect on your debt. But for now," Sherlock tossed one of the helmets across the small space, and John fumbled to catch it, "we have work to do."
"I told you I could have formulated several hypotheses about him."
Forthright never has she been; even so, managed to contain
pirates," Sherlock said. "We're accomplished professionals who fortuitously share similar goals."
He pocketed his phone and turned to stroll out, grinning to himself, nearly humming with energy and excitement.
"You're bloody kidding," the doctor whispered.
decided it was boring because – if I remember right – some employee stole it or he binned it, because that's exactly what people do with priceless family heirlooms."
"It's fine," he said automatically, then sighed, resisting the urge to shake his head. "Okay, it's not really fine. But not bad."
John relayed the story to her, watching her expression darken, her lips pursing into a thin white line. He waited for interruption that didn't come and, when he'd finished, Morgan gave a deep sigh, pinching the bridge of her nose, features weary. His heart went out to her – this was probably not how she'd intended to spend her Christmas.
"You didn't share this," Cheryl pointed out.
"Why can't I really be your uncle?" he asked.
Sherlock's gaze flickered up to meet John's stormy one; the doctor's jaw was clenched in an effort to keep himself quiet. He met Sherlock's eyes, giving a curt nod, hands fisted so tightly his knuckles were white.
"You can have some if you behave," John replied, grinning at the faintly irritated sigh his partner gave. He knew Sherlock would pick up on the warning there – John didn't want a row about Irene's unexpected presence at dinner. If Sherlock hadn't even known she was in London, then Mycroft had a reason for bringing her here, and for the deception.
He sat down on the couch again, grateful to be off his feet. Sandra offered to take Veronique's coat and handbag and the agent handed them over with a genuine smile of thanks. Veronique liked Sandra, Sam knew, even if she made Sandra nervous.
Lestrade managed to clear a space on his desk the moment before the map was spread out, a maze of lines and symbols accentuated by red pen ink and hastily jotted notes.
"Sherlock, we have a missing person –"
Her place of work had her on record, but she didn't work there. Her home address wasn't public but Irene had done some digging and turned it up, but Jennifer didn't live there. These discrepancies should have – and would have – rung immediate alarm bells, but someone had gone to great lengths to ensure that the façade held up.
to trust Sherlock, he told himself. He had to. At least to keep the promises he’d made to John after the drugs. And that meant trusting that whatever Sherlock was up to with Irene, he wouldn’t go down that path again.
"He remembers a grand total of four things: snow, lights, the name John, and the name Sherlock Holmes."
Sam shook his head again, exhaling hard.
Sam glanced away toward the bookshelves and the fireplace, his expression distant, almost blank, but with a shadow of reluctance darkening his eyes, touching the edges of his features. Sherlock filled that silence with silence of his own, letting it stretch until Sam said:
"Oh. I'm sorry."
"Which tube stations are closest to here if you're coming from the south? Do you know?"
He pulled the larger box toward him and slipped off the lid, then blinked in surprise.
"Trust you."
John left the shop, heading south and wondered if the constables had done this – but he thought not, given the way the woman had needed to search for the map. He kept a slow pace, checking the map every so often. The walk was simple and he estimated it would only take him a little over ten minutes at his current rate. He looked at the other shops and galleries, at the little flats above them, at the pedestrians, but nothing jumped out at him.
"It's not her, John! It's
Mycroft
very organized that way." It wasn't the first time she'd caught herself. Sherlock had no intention she should have to change her vocabulary permanently. "Always keeps electronic versions of those things. Scans. I will send them."
The silence didn't feel false, but John didn't trust it all the same.
"As far as they know."
To keep Sherlock from getting himself lost.
"And you know full well that Harry drew up all the proper legal documents, which have been signed and notarized and approved, giving us
"You can't encircle something with a heart," Tina pointed out. "By definition, it has to be a circle."
Sandra.
"Fine time to start worrying about someone else," he commented. "I'll be fine. Just sleep."
“Well,” John said, snaking his arm around Sherlock’s waist to trace his fingers up and down his partner’s spine, “it’s definitely not public in here.”
"I'm fine," Sherlock snapped. "But you need a nurse."
He'd always hated when people described the recently dead as looking as though they were sleeping.
“Ah, well sometimes,” John said, shifting a bit in his seat, feeling somewhat awkward at having raised the topic at all. “It’s not intentional.”
John kept him there until he was aching, before tipping Sherlock's cock up and sliding it into his mouth. Sherlock moaned, arching up; John's hands steadied him, giving him just enough freedom for shallow movements. Sherlock raked his nails across John's scalp, whimpering as the coiled feeling tightened, breath coming in quiet gasps.
"I never said this was a person," Mycroft pointed out.
– churning just beneath the surface would have bubbled over and spilled out like a raging flood, annihilating everything in its path.
Right now, wood and concrete dust hung in the air, particles dancing in the beam of his flashlight, giving the air a musty, almost woodsy smell. Sherlock inhaled deeply, teasing apart the scents, scouring it for hints of anything else.
"In the meantime, we can go through all the interesting evidence Sherlock's bound to have in your flat," Lestrade added. "Alexandre couldn't tell us much, but I bet Sherlock can. It'll be even easier without him calling me an idiot the whole time or refusing to explain what he thinks is blindingly obvious."
"Right. I get it."
"Work together and live together?" Doe murmured.
"A case unrelated to your work. We met up with you unexpectedly. You and John were planning a pub night."
An unfamiliar tread on the stairs made him turn and a woman entered the room a moment later, looking unsurprised by the men on the bed, but surprised by Mycroft.
He exhaled slowly, realizing he was holding his breath only when the dull ache in his chest warned him he needed more oxygen. An answering breath ghosted across his skin at his shoulder, the only other sound in the otherwise still flat.
Sherlock wondered if she knew that her disapproval mirrored Mycroft's – probably not, although he doubted it would surprise her.
“We could stand here calling one another’s names,” Sherlock snapped, and John grinned at the abrupt note of impatience, “or you could put yourself to good use and open the damn door!”
It made him feel sick. He'd seen people in Afghanistan used as human shields or forced into being suicide bombers or gunned down simply because they were in the way. There were times when the war felt distant and other times when it felt like it was right here, all around him, being re-enacted with a different cast. The idea that someone would set himself up in a bombing to deflect suspicion was terrifying but all too believable to John.
have to think that you've got to accept it because you hurt me. It's not an eye for an eye, Sherlock. I'm just telling you because I think you should know."
“Better,” he admitted. John shifted his shoulders slightly as Sherlock trailed fingertips up his spine to the base of his skull, then focused on the back of his neck. Light movements, almost not there.
There was a slight hesitation and then Sam frowned, opening his green eyes and refocusing somewhat.
John thought of the notes Sherlock had left scattered about the day before their anniversary, all the memories they contained. It opened a flood – things Sherlock hadn't written down, good and bad. His expression seeing John step out of the cubicle at The Pool. The look of concentration on his face when he'd put John's wedding ring on his hand for the first time – here in the flat, to see if it fit. Holding him the darkness the first time he'd cried over his mother's death. Being held after Harry had died. The look of bliss on his face the first time John had stumbled on the thumb-on-the-back-of-the-head trick. The way he'd taught John's body to trust him their first night together as partners. The way John had instinctively trusted him from the first moment they'd met. Years of smiles, unexpected laughter, hugs, stolen kisses, simple touches.
But she wasn't the one dealing with the very messy, very human aftermath.
John nodded, still grinning.
, John thought.
In the months – years? – to come, would John put up with this? How would he manage? Would he stop working, follow Sherlock around until the adventure and exhilaration of a case became routine and suffocating? Until he wasn’t with Sherlock because he wanted to be, because he craved the speed of it all, the insanity, the adrenaline rush, but because he
It wouldn't work, he realized. It had with the tunnels because the architecture of the city was deliberately constructed, whereas this was charting someone's movements. Someone who might have chosen to make them as random as possible.
"We're aware–"

Sherlock sucked in a deep breath, but quietly, turning his gaze resolutely to the screen.
"Do you know where you are?"
did – it would be as prepared as possible, his entire arsenal at his disposal, every contingency considered, every angle covered, every possibility planned for.
"Thank you," Josephine repeated. Sherlock crouched down to better see the screen and John tilted it slightly so the angle was good for both of them. Josephine beamed at them from her kitchen table where Tricia had obviously set her up so she could work in the background and keep an eye on things.
make a habit of shooting people I don't know because of some misplaced political idea or because I thought it might be a good career move!"
needs you, they know how to get in touch with you. At worst, we're a two hour train ride away, and you
Sherlock snorted softly, crossing his arms, at the flicker of amusement on his friend’s face.
He hid a smile and spent several minutes tracking down Hassard and Donovan, happening upon them in a break room after finding Hassard's office empty. Donovan gave him a tired look that John was used to by now, but Hassard's gaze was sharp.
"How what!" John yelled. "I don't know what the bloody hell you're talking about!"
"I'll always remember that," John replied, giving her a steady look.
"Sam Mitchell."
"I suspect your brother is not overly inclined to share sensitive information with known terrorists, Mister Holmes. I also suspect that time is not an abundant resource at the moment, so perhaps you'd like to share what you know. Quickly."
mass hysteria– oh, the possibilities, John, think of the possibilities! Do you suppose some sort of situation could be established in which–"
“The lack of it is Mycroft’s feature,” Gabriel said. “Or at least he says it is.”
"He had a serious flashback yesterday," Sandra replied and Veronique felt her jaw tighten. "Things he's never remembered before, until now."
"Tell her to have him transferred to Princess Grace as soon as he's stabilized."
"You do generally operate in Britain's best interests, and it's useful to keep an eye out, yes," Mycroft replied. "That," he nodded at the screen, "is supposed to be Karam Sarraf, twenty-four, born in Exmouth, raised in Bournemouth from the age of six when his father was transferred for work, moved to London at the age of nineteen, employed since then as a… bicycle courier," the note of disdain for the physical activity wasn't entire suppressed, and Sherlock felt rather than saw the smile that curled on John's lips despite everything, "which left him more than enough time for his true passion, which was… spelunking, I'm told it's called."
„I‘m home!“, John shouted while hanging his coat on the hook.
„Wow, they only expired two years ago, that‘s a real lucky strike.“ Sherlock had spotted the date without moving even a bit. John reached out and took another one but instead of eating it himself he held it towards Sherlock and made an offering „Hm?“ sound. Sherlock opened wis mouth willingly and let John feed him.
„If that ain‘t a great dinner, I don‘t know anymore.“, John said while dropping his haul on the little table in front of the couch and started crunching on one of the bread sticks.
"Was totally worth it though.", John chuckled and ran his fingers through Sherlock´s beautiful and now slightly messy hair.
„Oh no, Sherlock..“, John said with resignation. „Does that mean we still didn’t go get any groceries? Good lord, this could easily be a badly maintained student dig.“
„Do i also get some dessert?", Sherlock asked with a low voice still staring at his doctor, unable to take his eyes off. John reached for the marshmallows and took one in between his front teeth.
„You bet." john said smiling and fed yet another breadstick to Sherlock. When he took in the last bit, his lips touched johns finger and they paused all movement for one endless moment. It was long enough for John to get entirely lost in Sherlock’s eyes.
„I‘m close, John, I‘m so close.“ He wimpered in bliss. Stroking over Sherlock’s body and everywhere he could reach with his hands he kept on sucking. Moving his head up and down and twisting his tongue. Not much time had passed, John´s movements became less rapid but more and more firm and powerful and Sherlock’s moans become louder and louder until they were screams. „Fuck, oh my god. This is incredible, John, you are incredible." John was enjoying all of it. They both had waited so long for this to happen, the tension had been immeasurable. John felt Sherlock’s muscles contract everywhere and knew even before he said „I’m coming, John. Arghh!" With one last thrust Sherlock let spurts of cum pour out of him. John swallowed and sucked and sucked until Sherlock who was still moaning with his eyes closed rode out of his orgasm. Then he looked up at his, could he say boyfriend? and smiled.
"Oh god yes." he responded with a longing gaze, that Sherlock felt like he had seen before, but never in this context. Sherlock layed back on his side of the sofa, pulling John over him who came to sit on his crotch. John reached for some lube (that was standing on the table because i say so. moreover, they are both tested negative on STDs and would have otherwise ofc used condoms #safersex) and generously spread it over Sherlock’s cock that was already almost hard again. Sherlock pulled John completely towards him, so that they were lying on top of each other. The feeling of simply that was amazing. The weight, the heat, the friction, the sensation of being so intensely close. Then Sherlock started lubeing John’s hole. He slide in one finger and quickly added another. Stretching John‘s hole he scissored a bit and already seemed to have hit a certain spot because he heard a moan coming from next to his ear.
„However, i‘m grateful that you do.“, Sherlock added quietly. Instead of an answer John started stroking over Sherlock’s knee and gave it a little grip. John knew it, he knew it for some time now. He was in love with this strange detective and there was nothing he could do about it. Every inch of that perfect pale elegant body of his just had an impact on John that he couldn’t resist. It attracted him like murder cases attracted Sherlock.
„I must agree with you, Jawn.“ After a few more kisses they slowly drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
„If you give me another kiss,“ he said. That was a fair price John thought and moved up to meet Sherlock‘s lips for a long passionate kiss. Shortly after, he had pulled down the black jeans and was stroking over Sherlock‘s inner thighs. He laid a hand over the the now clearly visible bulk and felt Sherlock’s cock pressing against it. No question that did not leave himself without reaction. Before John continued, he quickly took off his own pants to make a little more room for what was staring to build up inside of them. Sherlock let out an adorable pleading
„So was I! Or at least my brain was..“ Sherlock was still surprises that the day had passed by without him noticing.
„Sometimes I wonder how i still put up with you, sherlock.“
John slid a hand under Sherlock‘s sweater and felt over the slender body, the abs and perfect skin. With one long movements he took hold of the seam and pulled the piece of clothing over Sherlock‘s head, who seemed more than happy to help with it. That view, that body. He could be a fucking model. Those black jeans and his perfect waist. John’s eyes roamed him like he was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He touched him and Sherlock shivered at the movement of his hands wandering over his lower stomach. The pressure of Sherlock‘s against his own cock increased constantly. John moved down a bit so he could kiss the bear skin beneath him. He wanted all that he could reach and hungrily licked a trail down to the waistband of Sherlock‘s pants which caused the owner of said pants to let out a quite moan. With a look to Sherlock asking for permission, John put a hand on the buttons of the jeans, that were in his way. Sherlock nodded with a grin.
"I have a feeling with the noice we made, every citizen of London, must have deduced what just went off in 221b." They could already see Mrs Hudson’s face: Simply knowing. Very possible she was gonna throw a party, that they finally got together.
„Hm. Actually it is not completely empty. There is a head inside.“
"I love you, Sherlock. I might just say it." Sherlock seemed stunned and didn’t really know what to say but then he found his language again and answered „I love you too, John Watson." His voice was raspy and shaky as if it took a lot to express what he actually felt. But it felt good. He had mostly recovered from what John had just done with him, so he come closer and breathed: „Let me see what we have here." Wanting to return the favor Sherlock sat up on his legs and reached out for John‘s cock that was already visitbly dripping inside his boxers. With a quick movement he flipped John over on his back and licked off the drops of pre-cum and then kissed John again who was leaning against the armrest of the sofa. Their tongues clashed and moved over eachother. They had their eyes closed and breathed heavily. Sherlock felt John‘s cock against his stomach; it was very hard.
