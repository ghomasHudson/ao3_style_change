With great reluctance they slowly peel themselves apart. It's like waking up and realizing he's slipped in between the couch cushions: he was so warm and comfortable and Tony was so close that Steve hadn't realized how entwined they were. He so badly wants to just stay right where he is that even his muscles protest moving, like he's sore from sleeping in a strange position without the preceding discomfort.
"Right!" Tony straightens up and snags his drink, backing away. "Okay! Fantastic! I'm going to stop talking to you now so you don't change your mind. See ya!" And with a grin and a wink he saunters off into the crowd.
Steve finally does, heaving for breath, and Tony says, with every sign of complete sincerity, "I am not angry at you. I'm not accusing you of anything. I am not leaving. Do I look like I'm about to flip a shit or walk out?"
"Hey," he says quietly, gently cupping Steve's cheek and running his thumb over his cheekbone, "are you okay?"
, and they kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss and without realizing it's going to happen until it does Steve comes.
"All right, but it better not be anything gross or slimy. Or anything that stains," Tony says, but he obediently closes his eyes and holds out his cupped palms.
Tony and Bucky both end up leaving right after breakfast - Tony for a Saturday work meeting; Bucky to finalize some of the paperwork for his discharge that Steve only just found out he's been planning for months - unknowingly leaving Steve alone with the realization that he wants Tony and Bucky
Tony leads them to another cafe a block further down the road that to Steve looks basically the same as Starbucks. He says as much, and arguing about coffee and cafes and local startups and hipsters lasts them through getting their drinks and a table.
"Wait a sec," Tony says. His shoulder nudges at Steve's head until he tilts his face back so they can see each other. Tony - does not look happy right now. "Are you and Bucky a thing?"
"Would you recognize any of them again," Tony says, coming to stand right in front of him. "Anyone who was talking shit at the bar. Would you -"
"Okay," says Tony. He sighs, and his hands loosen on Steve's shoulders, his thumb distractedly rubbing the side of his neck. "Look, I'm - not the best person out there, okay? And I haven't exactly treated everyone well, you know?"
Takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry," Steve says. He still can't bring himself to look at Tony, too ashamed to look anywhere other than his own hands.
Steve's shocked and Tony's laughing. He pushes his phone towards Steve again and says, "That totally didn't count. Logan's an asshole. Here, really, do one more."
That is, he does reasonably well until a week later, when he decides to go to the library after work. He's a block away from the building when he hears someone behind him shout, "Steve!"
Steve studies him for a second, and yeah. Tony doesn't look like he's about to do anything like that. He just looks so calm, so -
Tony shrugs and looks away, smile turning pleased and possibly a bit bashful. "I was bored a lot as a child."
They both laugh, and Steve motions Tony to go first. Tony shakes his head, and Steve takes a deep breath, squares his shoulders, and says, "Would you, um. Would you like to - come up?"
It's the most obvious change of topic Steve's ever heard, but it's not like Tony was trying to be subtle. Neither of them has seen Cloud Atlas before, but Tony says he's in the mood for epic romances and things that don't make a whole lot of sense, and acts baffled at his own thought processes. Trying to convince Steve and Bucky to watch the movie without saying a single word about the plot and adamantly refusing to allow either of them to look it up on their phones (knowing anything at all about the plot beforehand would ruin it, he insists) carries them through the rest of dinner, and it's not until they're clearing the table that Bucky suddenly whirls on Tony and  says, indignant and laughing, "Oh Jesus,
to talk to Bucky about Tony. Honestly dying. And there's something that isn't the worst thing about Bucky being overseas, not by a long shot, but it's one of those little things that he didn't know was going to happen until Bucky was already gone, and it's this: he needs to plan out when and how to tell Bucky. He can't just wait till the next time he sees him. He can't just text him and tell him they're hanging out. He can't just go to Sam or Nat's and find Bucky already there. He can't just -
Tony shrugs. "I like you. I like you a lot. I want to date you and have sex with you and the whole thing. I have big, gooey romantic feelings for you. And those feelings? Do not affect and are not affected by anything you might or might not feel for someone
True to his expectations and despite his best efforts, they do figure it out. Well, part of it, anyway. He won't tell them Tony's name, because they love him and he knows what they'd do. That, and they think Tony was just stringing Steve along for a while; don't realize that Steve fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Don't realize that there was an entire table full of people laughing their heads off at him.
Yes, it's just Bucky. But suddenly it's not just that Steve's apparently wanted Bucky subconsciously for god only knows how long - now it's that Tony hasn't been cared for nearly as much as he should have been, and Steve may be shit at this but Bucky sure isn't. He never knew it was possible to want something so much until he thinks of Bucky pouring all the attention and care he's capable of on Tony the way Tony deserves, and Tony soaking it up and appreciating it the way BUCKY deserves.
"No, no, I clearly interrupted," Bucky starts, but Tony cuts him off with, "But you just got back! You guys should -"
He sees both Tony and Bucky over the course of the next two days, though thankfully not at the same time. Bucky's settling in to his new apartment and Tony's busy with something at work, though he still makes a lot of time for Steve.
"Not formally yet," the guy says. He turns and leans his elbow on the bar so he's facing Steve head-on, and Steve wants everyone else in the building to clear out and shut off most of the lights and bring him his goddamned sketch pad.
Steve's caught between laughter and horror, because Bucky's caught between joking and dead serious. "Wait, wait, wait!" Steve says. "Lemme finish the story! See, this is why I said it didn't make a good cliffhanger."
"Okay," says Steve. He squeezes Tony's hand one last time and steps back. Then, before he can think better of it (or chicken out), Steve continues quietly, "Just think of me later, okay?"
Again Steve shakes his head, but this time it's to clear the cobwebs. He looks at Tony, and when Tony smiles tentatively at him, can't help but lean forward and kiss him. Tony's smile is much more pleased and much more genuine after that.
"Because," Tony says, "once you get what you came for you literally cannot get anything more. It's impossible. If you keep talking, the one and only thing you can do is talk people
Without another word Tony hits call, puts it on speakerphone, and holds it between them so he can talk into the mic and they can both hear.
I'm going to see him again. He's," and Steve's laughter quiets, and he finds himself toying with a pencil left on his desk to avoid Bucky's non-existent eye contact. "He's real swell, Buck. I like him a lot. And he really seems to like me."
Tony's mouth drops open and his eyes are blown wide. Steve can see his pulse thudding in his throat, and wonders how hard his heart must be thundering for the sudden change to be so visible.
The Blank Stare is on in full force, but it falls apart when Bucky meets Steve's eyes. It may only be for a split second, but that's long enough for Steve to see how worried and on-edge Bucky is. Close to panicking, even.
If Steve thought Bucky was mad when Bucky thought Tony'd toyed with Steve to win a bet, it's got nothing on how angry he is now.
A week after Bucky's sudden return Tony sits Steve down - practically sits on top of him - and repeats over and over again that it doesn't matter what's wrong, it doesn't matter what's going on, Tony's not going to leave him for it, so please tell him. No matter what Steve says, no matter how many times he tries to explain that he's dealing with it, Tony just keeps saying that. Steve could just get up and leave, and almost does so more than once, but the sudden hurt he sees flashing across Tony's face before Tony can lock it down slices at Steve. The hurt just makes him angrier, though, and resentful at Tony for causing it, and everything just tangles up in his head and falls out of his mouth so he tells Tony the whole thing, but somehow he manages to make it sound like he's mad at Tony about it.
"Sorry," he says, cutting himself off mid-word. "I didn't mean to dominate the conversation like that."
"I don't want you to leave," Steve says. "I'm not good with words like you, so I can't say things like what you just did. I wish I could, because I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. But I want you to stay."
Tony's face breaks into a grin. "I can't wait to see you again either. Maybe, um, with the kissing thing? Maybe next time, yeah?"
Tony's bent around him, one of his legs between both of Steve's and he's HARD, he's clearly trying to not actually dry-hump Steve on the pavement but he's also so clearly
"I'm not made of glass," Steve says quietly. "I can take care of myself. I don't need anyone to put me on a shelf with the excuse of my fragility and their own heroism and desire to take care of me. I don't need that, Tony."
"Yes," Steve says firmly, and Tony seems taken aback for a moment but then pleased. "Definitely a relationship. And I'm with you one hundred percent: you are my priority, and if we were all together then you'd both be my priority." And you and Bucky would be each other's priorities, Steve thinks, still dizzy with yearning for how good they would be for each other.
"No, no, no." Tony waves a hand. He's been leaning back in his chair, sipping his drink and smiling, for at least, what, five minutes? Maybe ten? Christ, he'd looked interested, but maybe he was just bored. He says, "No, it's good. I like hearing about things that matter to you so much. And it's good that you have someone like him. You know, who you've been friends with for so long."
Steve sighs and tips forward, resting his forehead against Tony's sternum. "Yeah," he says, muffled, "I just -
Bucky's reactions are more than Steve could have wished for. He glares at Steve's self-deprecation, whistles and awards points for Tony's flirting, and groans when Steve says he thought he and Tony were heading to the bathroom at the same time. Steve would think Bucky's hamming it up, except he can read Bucky like a large-print book he's already got memorized, so he can tell it's all genuine. Steve gets to the part where he overheard Tony and his friends, and it doesn't hurt nearly so much now. He thought he'd end up glossing over that part, but the more he talks the more he understands what he actually heard, and he ends up repeating the whole thing word-for-word just for his own benefit.
the Nazi’s had struck against. Not really. Or at least not yet. With the Nazi’s views on the poles Tony had no doubt they’d strike at them soon enough, but this wasn’t that strike. This was about the Jews. This was the first solution to the prevalent debate of a Jewish problem.
The dream had felt so real and like so many of his dreams before, it stayed with him. He couldn’t shake the feeling of Tony’s breath ghosting over the back of his neck, mouth skating over his temple, demanding as always, as he’d whispered filth with unbearable tenderness.
"You'll watch your tongue if you know what's good for you, or the Captain will hear about it!" The cook warned direly. But Hammer just laughed in return, sounding curiously unconcerned about the threat.
“That’s a nice outfit for brunch Artur, on a boat with Captain Ahab, but it’s not really suitable for having brunch with baronesses.” Tony came to the rescue. He had a similar pair of blue shorts draped over one arm (though they were thankfully longer) and a matching suit jacket hanging off a thin wire hanger. “But I like the color scheme. Let’s try this one.”
“What are you doing?” She hissed lowly through her tight smile, brows scrunching together in confusion.
And still, Tony had wanted to be with them. He had been young once too and despite all his protests to the contrary he had occasionally cared about something other than himself. But Tony’s father had forbidden it and he had practically kept Tony under lock and key that year- finally sending him away altogether before his eighteenth birthday could arrive and Tony would be old enough to legally enlist.
“Sit still will you! And keep your hat on,” he heard Péter whisper behind him, followed by a pitiful sniffle presumably from James and a whined reply, “He didn’t have to do it so hard, did he?”
Tony’s stomach clenched tight with worry, two things immediately racing through his mind in response to the revelation. First, they were about to be in immediate danger again flying through hostile airspace; and second, it sounded distressingly as if they would be taking the children with them.
At worst, Stefen could be killed in the attempt or found out and then killed, Tony thought, stirring the dark brew in his cup and staring into its depths.
Captain Rogers did not kiss like a gentleman. He devoured Tony’s mouth with an edge of starvation that only increased the feeling of urgency building between them. When Stefen bit at his bottom lip and sent pain stinging through Tony’s mouth to twist along with the pleasure he gasped, hips bucking upward without thought.
“Keep it down. But if you happen to look up and see anything at all noteworthy I want to know about it, almost before the ink dries. Are we clear on that Stark?”
Natacha glanced at him sharply, pink coloring her cheeks as she and accused suspiciously, “I thought you were a monk.”
“Stefen,” Tony implored him quietly, wanting to stop him before he said or did something he’d truly regret. Stefen’s eyes flew to his and held.
Tony could confidently say that he had been faced with tougher choices than the one that lay before him and Captain Rogers now, but none that filled him with such anxiety, such insecurity of mind and fear of misstep as this one. On the mountain, choosing to send Péter and Natacha away had been the clear choice for all that it was agonizing.
"Only until other arrangements can be made Herr Hammer, I'm sure Bucky will have it sorted by the afternoon." Steve was trying to salvage what was left of the situation but Stark had other ideas.
He knew Tony was right, that allowing the children to sing wasn't going to put them in any more danger than they were already, being forced as they were to accompany him all over Germany and perform at the parties of prominent Nazi party members. He even agreed with Tony's line of thinking that if the children were going to be forced to perform for the entertainment of the Nazis, that they may as well get some pleasure out of performing for their neighbor. But Steve couldn't help his nerves. He had that itch on his skin, the one that said duck, and he'd learned to trust it over the years.
The curves of Ian’s boyish face technically favored his mother, and normally Tony lived by the numbers, but watching him now – that soft trusting look in the blue of his eyes, the way they roamed over his father’s face as if he was memorizing every last inch the same way Tony was, before shutting them, his spiky eyelashes fanning out over his cheeks – Tony could not deny the true resemblance. Ian was his father’s son. For better and for worse.
Péter released him and stumbled back as if Tony had slapped him and Tony looked away, because if he kept looking at him, he’d crumble into pieces too small to reassemble.
“He ate under the clouds more than he did the dining room ceiling but he lost interest in it when Margrit died.”
“Well he’ll have plenty of opportunity to redeem himself this time,” Tony chuckled. “The Captain’s guest, Baroness Schrader, will be issuing the invitations soon. You’re all invited of course.”
he knew his own child, he knew she was there – but it was not Maria’s face he saw, but that of a stranger. “Please, Stefen. You’re frightening the poor child.”
"So that was the plan was it? Hide out and live under the stairs?" Tony tilted his head, eyeing the old boxes and forgotten things that cluttered the space around them with a curious expression. "But won't you get hungry? A growing boy like you needs to eat."
Tony held his breath. He waited, but Stefen did not answer. He was staring through Tony now, seeing more than what was there, and Tony could only hope that whatever thoughts had swept him away were the ones he’d planted and not the nightmares that so often haunted Stefen.
Of course they wouldn’t be. Not with SS in the house. Stefen would never be that relaxed. None of them could be. Péter was leaning over Stark’s other shoulder, pointing at something on the sheet music. Natacha and Ian floated in and out of Bucky’s view as Tacha tried to teach him to waltz properly.
Bucky had stalked the search party all night, watching, waiting for the perfect moment. Under the cover of darkness, he’d begun to pick them off. Even with the silencer on his rifle they noticed when their comrades began to drop, and chaos had erupted. They were easy targets with their loud movements and bright torches, but even so Bucky was just one man and they had the benefit of those long reaching beams. He had to keep on his feet, out of reach and out of light, but that turned out to be useful in drawing the search party off Steve’s trail.
“Yes, Herr Stark. We’ll do whatever it is father needs us to do,” Ian assured him earnestly. Natacha looked more dubious but she crowded around him with the others.
“Cameron!” Hammer’s voice floated up the staircase from the floor below with an inpatient snap. “This is no time to dawdle. Come at once!”
“We can’t all live with our instrument glued to our hands.” Stefen taunted with a small smirk as he lifted the mandolin closer to his chest, clearly getting into position to play.
When their arms were full they’d loaded the trunk, and sent the driver back to the hotel with the idea of wandering to find lunch. Lunch found them in the form of a kart in the park that was selling smoked sausage and sauerkraut. They’d sat beneath the trees and chatted, Tony handing Stefen large chunks of his food, while observing all the young mothers with their prams and young people from the university with books under their arms; all of them enjoying the crisp fall air and the last echoes of summer warmth.
"Nightcap for you Cap?" Tony offered the steaming mug in his hands with a cheeky grin. Stefen gave him a peevish glance, no doubt because of Tony's continued insistence on using the nickname, but reached to take the mug just the same.
"James, let Ian dry you off first." Tony called out, ignoring James responding groan. Casting a stern glance over each of the others he added, "That goes for the lot of you. You'll catch your deaths running off in wet underthings."
It was Artur. Ian and the others had been playing outside. Ian had been practicing drills and Péter had wandered off when Harry had shown up with a telegram. Artur and Maria had wandered down to the lake without anyone noticing until Maria had started screaming. Artur was throwing some sort of fit, trying to drag Maria into the water. Neither child could swim.
“It won't be that long.” Steve leaned forward but directed his answer to Artur who was pouting into his plate. “A week at most.”
“Stefen, I’d leave with you in an instant but that’s not what you want. You want me in another country to wait while you fight, all the while wondering if you’ll ever come back. There is a damned big difference.”
"Tacha?" he questioned, alarm growing as she curled into an even tighter ball, lowering her head until he could no longer see her face, dark or no dark. When she spoke again her voice was so weak he barely heard it.
Branches swept at the truck, clawed fingers reaching in earnest. Snow continued to fall, fogging what little space they could see between the thick branches hovering over the thin mountain road.
“I should be here. I know I should be,” he mumbled in reply, not acknowledging Tony’s see through attempts at cheerful distraction. Did Peter’s father really think the thought of a birthday party was going to make him forget those things that he’d said; what Wanda had said about what was happening to gypsies like them?
Tony wondered at that as Frau Hogan gently nudged the girl out the door and closed it behind her with a small sigh. Alone, she turned back to him with an apologetic smile. Neither it nor the prettiness of her face distracted Tony from noticing the assessing nature of her glance nor the intelligence behind her eyes. She was observing him closely and Tony did not have to be a genius to figure that if there were something ‘rotten in the state of Denmark’ then she as the keeper of its keys was probably privy to it. Perhaps a little flirtation was still in order? Tony was supposed to be a spy now after all.
“Is that all he wanted?” Dvořák asked again, watching the way tiny flecks of emotion slivered across Rogers face.
The perpetrator of his rude awakening was one Clinton Barton, a novice at the abbey. Perched gingerly in the rafters above Tony’s head, the odd child was throwing pebbles at his head and peering down at Tony with a mischievous smirk like one of those exotic creatures you read about in adventure magazines.  Grumpily, Tony began the business of waking up and stretching his protesting back – yes he was getting much too old for nights spent stooped over floors or workbenches – glaring at Barton all the while.
The one small bit of luck they had was that they were unable to break into his workshop. Tony had the only key, its location he had conveniently forgotten, and it was reinforced with his own steel. For two days now they’d been trying to break that door down without so much as putting a dent in it. They’d even gone so far as to try and cut through the wall of the neighboring room, only to discover of course that Tony and Joseph had enclosed the room with more of Tony’s special steel.
“Father said to just concentrate on being a kid for a change. But that’s selfish. Isn’t it? I know he’s the reason that I get to do this. I’m smart, but starting term late like this, finding me a dorm on such short notice, that’s because of his money. He pays them so I get to go, but Natacha and the others, and all our friends, they’re all stuck with whatever happens.”
A swell of guilt rose in his chest. God, he hoped that Stark really had meant his forgiveness. He didn’t like to think about would might happen if he hadn't.
“You’re as arrogant as your old man.” Obi sneered. He gestured to the room around them, sneer sliding into a smug smirk as he said, “Hughard didn’t think he was touchable either. He died choking on his own blood, begging those men not to touch his wife, for someone,
“Shhh now, you can’t leave us so soon Captain,” the hand tightened on his face, nails biting into his skin, hot breath ghosting over his flesh. Steve’s stomach rolled, salty bile and blood sticking his throat, threatening to choke him, his lungs seizing from the lack of air.
“The rest of your father’s personal fortune is tied up in the company. You are entitled to it, but retrieving it won’t be a simple affair.” Pavlok warned. “I doubt Mr. Stanislov will want to relinquish it without a fight. You have the legal high ground as it were, but you’ve given me the impression that you wish to remain out of the public eye.”
Steve wanted to promise her that nothing bad would befall her but he could not bring himself to utter such empty promises, not in the face of her own frankness. As he searched for the words to convince, the right thing to convey, he could think only of the unapologeticly beautiful, and yet foreign, construction of her face in this sea of pale faces. A sea growing ever more turbulent as the Reich howled for racial purity. She could not hide the way others did (the way he did) and he found something incredibly brave about her presence there. She had stood among them, gowned like a queen and glittering from head to toe as her voice soared above them, forced them to feel the things she wanted them to feel, left them stinging and raw.
Tony wanted real partnership. A real relationship more like. It wasn’t unheard of between two men. That sort of thing wasn’t something one had ever discussed in public even before Hitler had come to power but Tony was familiar with the practice and the subculture surrounding sodomy. His sexual education had started tamely enough on his oldest friend, but had been spurred by reckless rebellion when it had become clear that Hughard expected Tony to settle with someone of his choosing. A good catholic girl preferably from good German family with appropriate business ties, feelings not required.
He’d not rested well. Tony had spent the previous night in his workshop instead of coming to Steve’s room, claiming to be behind in his work on the boat. Steve had offered to stay with him while he worked, but Tony had begged off, urging Steve to try and catch up on the sleep he’d missed the last couple of days.
“I’ve heard worse come out of your mouth. You know I loved Peggy, and god knows she scrubbed you up nice, but you never used to apologize for being born in a barn.”
It was damn typical was what it was. Stefen had a bad track record with a pair of big brown eyes and a sharp tongue. Or was that good? Cause god only knew Steve wouldn’t have survived childhood without Bucky and Margrit had been the best thing to happen to him in his adulthood so maybe it was a good track record?
“Oh yes, Mrs. Hudson sends her regards.” She replied back, and Tony thought she might have let the wisp of an English accent slip through on purpose. “Are we sorted now?”
Tony gestured towards the stately couches lining both walls and the matching sitting chairs. He was glad to see that despite how little used the room was the maids were meticulous in their dusting and polishing. As the children trickled out of formation to find spots for themselves Tony moved to stand at the front of the piano in the center of the room and waited once more for quiet.
“Are we going to build boats?!” He demanded eagerly. Tony nodded, daintily sipping his soup to hide the smile tugging at his lips and the boy whooped. Natacha frowned and scolded him to control himself but James largely ignored her, beginning to inhale his lunch as if he could not eat it fast enough.
“I know, you’re a man now. Congratulations. You’ve been at it now for what, a week?” Tony replied with a snap, exasperated and too exhausted to have this discussion. “Your father and I are a bit ahead of you. We have learned a thing or two while we’ve been out here. Let us protect you where we can.”
“We’re almost done, Artry,” he murmured gently. He wanted to give it a few more minutes in the steam to be completely rid of that rattle. Artur didn’t complain. He just continued to cling to Steve as he had done since Steve had carried him in from the car. While Tony had gotten Sara undressed Péter had drawn the bath. Steve had just stood there holding his son, remembering the misery of his own youthful illnesses all too keenly as he rubbed his child’s back. Artur had clutched at his shirt, his entirely too long legs dangling listlessly in midair.
He might not have been his father's son, but in that moment Péter Rogers finally felt like the man he'd always wanted to be.
Tony averted any potential sulking by teaching them the brief history of the Liliputbahn and promising that they’d have plenty of opportunities to ride it while within the park. He and Péter had gotten caught up in a discussion about fossil fuels, engines and possibilities for more powerful energy sources when he noticed how quiet Ian was being.
“I know you care Tony. But Father loved James more than anything and he’s too broken to love us now that James is gone.” Natacha countered, only the tightening of her hand on his arm giving away how the words affected her.
“Julia, could you have Willamina prepare a tray for Herr Stark and have it brought to his room? He’s not feeling well enough to come down to breakfast.”
“I’m afraid I insist.” Tony replied just as smoothly in return. “Do you expect His Holiness simply to accept your word? Or the word of men who would say anything to appease their captors and assure their release?” Tony asked, looking toward the two silent men who were gazing at their hands but no doubt drinking in every word of the exchange.
“They can’t.” That quiet stare again before Fischer let out a breath that sagged the skin around the mouth and brought a touch of humanity back to his face. “But I’m the best at what I do.”
Tony couldn’t say why such a strong flavor of contempt seemed to build on his tongue that morning as the minutes ticked by. Far from being satisfied that his unwanted job had turned out to be as easy as turning off his brain and droning facts off like a radio program, an unprecedented kind of anger had begun to simmer at the base of his gut, growing with each day that passed.
Steve, usually lulled by Bucky’s soft singing, gritted his teeth and snapped for him to quiet. Miles of that, and Steve’s nerves were worn raw. It wasn’t that he was worried about anyone overhearing Bucky singing in Romany out here on the open road, within the privacy of the car. It was just that Bucky was trying to prove some sort of point, as if it had been too
Being packed into fertilizer like a turnip allowed for some warmth where outside his makeshift coffin the temperature was slowly dropping as they climbed higher into the mountains.
Contrary to his words Stefen’s touch was surer now, the grip steadier as he unconsciously drew Tony imperceptibly closer. Tony answered by stepping into his space with a decisive step, closing the distance between them.
“It wasn’t true,” Tony denied vehemently, fury burning in his mouth as he clenched his teeth until they ached. He’d wanted them. He’d wanted them so badly. “Hughard he… he sent me to a monastery in Salzburg. I-I tried to write you but…”
“He’s right here,” Natacha’s voice came from behind him and Tony looked back toward the door where she and Péter were now standing with Sara in Péter’s arms and Ian between them. Natacha had one hand wrapped firmly around Ian’s arm. Not to hold him back, Tony realized taking in the pallor of the boy’s face and the anxiousness in his big eyes – but to hold him up.
Schmidt’s smile curled into a devil's grin as he made his way around the desk and slowly began to fill his plate with the delicacies that had been laid out. Steve waited, coiled tight and prepared for anything. Schmidt took his time, the delicate china tinkling like bells and light bouncing off the silverware. All the while Steve waited at attention.
"Of course." He answered with a squeeze of her arm. He'd bear a thousand times worse for them than a walk in the snow. Up ahead with the axe slung over his shoulder Bucky whistled sharply and the children froze. James even stopped trying to shove snow down Artur's coat as all eyes turned to him.
“After throwing up your weight in bodily fluids, it stands to reason you would be a far less heavy man.” Tony mumbled. He shifted again, rubbing a soothing hand up and down Stefen’s chest, not at all ashamed that he was tucking Stefen into his arms as if the man was one of the children's lovies despite his grumblings. “I assure you that is not the case.”
jerking forward as Tony closed his mouth around the head of his cock. The unplanned motion pushes the thick length past his lips and into the back of his throat. Tony gagged, but gripped Stefen’s thighs tight swallowing him down again with gusto – unperturbed by the discomfort when the captain’s every hitched breath and aborted thrust was sending heat pooling down into his belly. Tony was so hard he thought he might burst, but he couldn’t even think about his own cock. Not when Stefen’s was a warm weight in his mouth.
"Oi! We need to lose these guys. I've only got four more bullets." Clinton hollered, reaching through the gaping hole where the back window used to be to thump his hand poignantly against the back of their seat.
“Good thing he has you then.” his sister muttered darkly and Ian grit his teeth mulishly but didn't rise to the bait.
“Not at you, at your uncle.” Stefen kissed the side of her head gently. “How bout it, yah up for it, Buck?” Stefen snickered. Bastard knew damn well Bucky wasn’t about to disappoint her if he could help it.
She sat, knees curled up to her chin in the dark with the door cracked open just enough for the voices of those who came and went from her father’s room to filter in. She heard it all. Heard it when the doctor ordered everybody out and when Frau Hogan refused. Heard it when father struggled with the doctor and ran out of strength – had to clamp a hand over her mouth to keep from making a sound, like screaming at the man to leave him alone. Stop making him make that horrible sound. But she knew it wasn’t really the doctor’s fault. It was hers.
“You can’t… lock me up Captain. Spent too many years locked up already,” Tony pulled back just long enough to pant, before he surged forward again, gripping Steve’s head in both hands and taking his mouth hungrily like he was starved for it.
He'd felt a burst of gratitude and something that felt like guilt settle in his chest as she’d cared for him. She'd even pulled out her makeup compact and covered the bruises on his face. Those ones had been accidents.
He could smell the smoke before he saw the actual blaze. Furnishings on fire, buildings set ablaze, frames warping under the heat like a giant hand had come down and squeezed them.
he could do. Relished with a strange sort of relief. He would have to go for the head or throat. Strike quick and hard, enough not just to down him but keep him out for hours. Steve could hide his body behind the sofa, go straight to the children, get out before anyone realized -
"Vati. Will you help me look?” Artur pleaded, stepping in front of Steve when he tried to move again. Steve stumbled and bit back a curse.
"Frau Hogan..." He began slowly, coming to a decision. He jerked his head toward the kitchen and Virginia darted away to do as Stark had suggested. His gaze settling on Pietro and Wanda he finished firmly. "Please join us. The both of you are welcome in my home. I cant apologize enough for the ordeal you’ve had."
“Tony, what do we do?” Péter begged to know and Tony shuddered, a sob building and forcing its way out of his chest like an over boiling pot, the words torn from his throat as he shook his head.
“You’ve heard it Artur, years ago.” Ian pointed out and Artur gave him the driest most scathing look; Tony had to lay a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud.
“They’ll be dumped with whoever can take them and promptly forgotten. The War Office has no time to worry about them beyond that. Anything could happen to them in a strange land in strangers’ hands, Stefen. Can you live with that?”
“No Artur. Samuel hasn’t done anything wrong. He will be sorely missed.” And color him shocked but Tony actually believed the man. The small boy standing in front of him however did not seem appeased, only greatly confused by this, his expression darkening.
“Bucky told me you were in my study.” The captain announced, and while that didn’t exactly surprise Tony it did take him a second or two to figure out what foot he wanted to get started on.
"What?" he groused. And there, Tony thought. He could see it now. The way he grit his teeth, and clenched and unclenched his hands around the steering wheel. It was so easily mistaken for temper, but it was just there to disguise how uncomfortable he was. But was it Tony’s proximity or the way in which Tony was staring at him? Perhaps both.
“So what is it you need from me?” Tony asked, because he knew Nik and he was smart enough to realize that the previous night’s speech had been prepping him for this exact moment. Niklas didn’t disappoint.
“Run you idiot,” Bucky cursed under his breath as Stefen just stood there staring at Dvorak like a fool as the enemy descended upon him. Taking a risk, Bucky took a careful shot, striking the ground just to Stefen’s right. He seemed to get the message and took off unsteadily. Just in time too, because Bucky’s shot was followed by a chorus of others as the enemy got close enough to try their own.
As Péter Rogers parked his bike behind the butchers shop he pondered what a strange thing it was to watch history repeat itself so many centuries later.
Setting down his glass with a flourish, that drew chuckles from the nearest tables, Tony flashed the room a smile before he began to plink away at another Christmas favorite, and tried not to be too obvious about searching the crowd for Steve while he was at it.
Steve gritted his teeth, fighting the words that leaped to his tongue that he’d rather see his daughter dead first. What kind of father would say something like that? He thought, as shame flooded through him. And how could he mean it?
“It’s perfect.” He reassured her, even though in truth it was slightly too bitter. He dipped the small square of cake into the cup just to show her. “Thank you.”
“What a stupid fucking question,” Bucky mumbled, dragging his eyes open. The private’s face colored and his gaze shot down to his boots, embarrassed.
Why had she let that happen? She thought bitterly, her hands curling into fists as the door swung shut behind them.
They sloshed through the kitchen, searching the back hallway for an exit, warry of going upstairs to the front of the building where the gunshot had come from. They found a little mudroom in the back with a single door. It took a moment for Steve to pry Sara off of him (
General Striker plucked it out of his hand and turned to father, a small smile playing over his lips. It didn’t match the cold gleam in his eyes Ian thought, frowning a little. His eyes jerked back to his father to find that Da’s eyes were on Striker now. They were ice cold.
“Oh don’t be such a bore Stefen. I was much older than these two when my parents started dragging me to balls. All our friends talk about it you know, how we never see your children. You’d think you were hiding them.”
“Why do you say that?” Steve frowned. Tony was fond of the countryside like Steve was fond of public speaking. A necessary evil.
He wouldn't think about the fact that two out of four of those women were buried in the ground. He was due a little good luck to even the score.
Up next: The Rogers family + one Stark go camping and learn lots about nature, boats, and swimming. Tony might not be the best spy but he's pretty sure Steve's an even worse Nazi. Also those mushy feelings just get mushier. Which is sort of a big problem because Natacha's a better Nazi than her father and Frau Werner is coming to tea.
"You don't know what you're talking about lady," the man in the cap grunted, giving the woman a steely eyed glare which she returned with an affronted look.
She stopped a few times to slip him bites of food and water. Every time that she opened the lid he jerked, fear jolting through him as he came up ready to swing.
“I left them for you!” Bucky screamed out until his throat felt like it would bleed. “I left it all, for you, and this is what you do?!”
Bucky’s smile turned just a hint nostalgic as he looked out the window, turning over an old memory. Tony found it easy to picture the two of them and their caravan, Stefen toddling about on unsteady legs with Bucky at his heels. He could see the stars the way Stefen had described them in Berlin, see the all the colors and the faces of the uncles and their families – smell dinner bubbling in the big pot over the fire. And then Bucky’s quiet voice drew him away from the fantasy, away from those boys who had no idea how time would change them.
Sounds of the labor force lining up for roll call and the precarious trek to the factories just outside the camp seeped through the walls. Some of them would sweat over steel machines, weaving together the uniforms of men who had put them there in the first place. More officers to bring in more prisoners. Round and round, night, day, night, day there was no end just another beginning, another fresh wave of hell with no relief.
"No I didn't!" All the horrible things Steve's been trying to not think about coming spilling out of his mouth like he'd been planning this all along. "Well, I heard, I figured it out, so I'm out. You aren't going to trick me again, and I am sure as HELL not going to just let you charm me again so you can win the next bet too!"
Once again, Steve's thrown so off-balance by something so unexpected that all he can say is, "What?"
Tony's holding very still, his hand like a vice around Steve's. He takes a deep, shuddering breath and says, "Yeah. Yeah. Same," through clenched teeth, and Steve suddenly remembers through his self-centered humiliation-slash-afterglow that Tony's still hard.
He's expecting an answer about, y'know, how to actually sell things. Maybe something a little bit flirty. But Tony keeps smiling at him and says, "The single most important rule in sales is this: have a goal going in, and once you achieve that goal,
Tony shakes his head. "That's not what this is. I can see why you'd think that, but it's not. This is - I just. I guess I would have wanted it to be - more special."
look vaguely familiar - up till now Steve assumed it was because he probably looked like a movie star or something, but now he thinks he's seen that goatee somewhere before.
Tony searches his face for a moment, and then a small, bright smile steals across his own. "I know," he says, then kisses Steve quickly. "I know that. I do. I'm just - nervous. But excited."
"Huh," Steve says. Tony had said that he'd been thinking about this for a while, but Steve hadn't realized he'd been thinking about it since before Bucky even got back. "Wait a minute," Steve says. "You bought that movie the day you came over for dinner. Did you know Bucky was coming home?"
"No, what?" Steve asks. He takes a risk and leans against the bar too, and doesn't slip and fall flat on his ass, which is another sign that this must be a dream.
"Yeah," he says. "I've known Rhodey since I was fourteen, actually. He's my oldest friend. We bunked together at college."
"I was just saying you could probably let Tony have the chair," Bucky says solemnly, "since you can sit in his lap."
"I didn't ask him to stay, Buck. Didn't even ask him inside," Steve says, not realizing that's what he did until he says it aloud. "I'm not sure he even realized I had - it doesn't matter. I didn't say anything. And it's not like I, you know. It's not like I, I
"You're perfect," Tony says. Steve's mouth clicks shut. Tony blinks and shakes himself and says, "Sorry. Too much? Sorry. I think I said that before right? I mean to. Because you are. Perfect, I mean. Not, not because I have like a kink or something, don't think that I like PLANNED earlier, because I didn't, I swear -"
Which he definitely can't do right now, because right now Steve and Tony are kissing each other to within an inch of their lives.
of things in my life. And I know a ton of people who've done even more things than I've ever dreamed of."
But not like he's laughing at Steve. He's got one hand on his hip and one hand running through his hair and his laugh is hysteric, like he's shocked and sick, and it's not what Steve's expecting at all.
"I only halfway told him," Steve says. "It's hard to explain. I mean, I only told him a little bit, and the rest he figured out on his own. But it was - I think I felt - guilty? Maybe?"
in a way he isn't over the computer, and then Steve's got his hands fisted in Bucky's shirt and hair and he's trying not to start crying too.
"Maaaaybe," Steve says, halfway just to be a shit and halfway because he can tell Bucky anything but he's not sure how to verbalize the part of his happiness that's all down to Bucky himself.
"Okay," Steve says. He can't seem to look anywhere other than the ground. He can't really breathe. He hadn't realized just exactly how
Two days before their next call Steve gets an unusually long email from Bucky. It contains every conceivable detail of every single little thing that's happened to him, near him, or within his sphere of experience in the last month. At the end of it Bucky writes, "There! Now I have LITERALLY NOTHING left to talk about next time. It's all you."
"Wait!" Tony says, desperate, his hands coming out like he's going to take Steve by the shoulders before he snatches them back. Half to himself he mutters, "Wait, I can fix this. I can fix this, I can
Rather than reassure him that Tony will definitely come back (which Steve could easily drag out into another argument and use up the remainder of their time), instead Bucky says, "Look, call him now, okay? That way if he doesn't come back then at least I can keep talking to you for a while."
Bucky used to do this thing when they were kids, where his face would go kind of tense, but then it wouldn't change again, no matter what happened. Bucky broke his arm when he was ten and pulled out the Tense Face and Steve will swear in a court of law that his expression didn't change for a solid sixteen hours. Since he's grown up, and especially since he's been in the army, he's perfected the Blank Stare to the point where it looks like he fell asleep with his eyes open. It's useful, he says, because it makes people think he's not paying attention, or that he really doesn't care what's happening around him.
"Tony, this is Bucky," says Steve, gesturing at the screen. Bucky waves through gales of laughter. "And Buck, this is Tony."
Oddly, Tony tilts his head like he's trying to figure something out. "Look, Steve. If you're so uncomfortable with this that it didn't even
There's a nudge at his hip, now, and Steve doesn't look. Can this guy even see that he's here? Does he even realize he's bumping into him? Honestly, past experience says probably not.
He turns, and the guy next to him is looking - kind of in his direction, actually. Steve looks behind himself, and yeah, there's no one else there even kind of facing them.
And everyone else starts laughing and yelling and the person sitting beside Tony claps him on the back and someone on the other side of the table throws a straw at him. Tony's laughing behind his hands, and everyone else is pointing and teasing and saying things like, "I never thought I'd live to see this day!" and "You actually
Steve looks at him, searching his face. Tony's eyes are clenched shut, which is a good thing, because Steve's sure that one look at his face right now would give everything away.
, and Steve can't help how intently he's watching them. It's the only reason he notices the way Tony's shoulders drop with that laugh, like he's - relaxing.
Tony shrugs, and reaches out hesitantly. When Steve doesn't jerk away he puts a hand on Steve's shoulder, moving his thumb gently against Steve's collarbone. "I'd want to because you're right; you're
"Why're you wet?" Bucky asks. Still laughing, the bastard. He knows better by now than to ask why Steve's cold, though.
Tony yelps as Steve springs away from him. "Sorry!" Steve shouts towards his computer. His computer, which is still Skyping Bucky. His computer, which is unintentionally aimed right at the door. His computer where Bucky, back inside now and sprawling on his bunk, has been watching this whole thing with a shit-eating grin.
to break the habit of turning to someone who wasn't there, but he gets to start doing that again now, doesn't he) it's automatic now for Steve to reach for Tony when he starts getting overwhelmed. He doesn't realize he's done it until a beat passes and what he expects doesn't happen, leaving him hugging Bucky but with his hand held out behind himself like a moron and feeling like he miscounted the stairs in the dark.
"Oh," says Steve. Then, "Wait, I thought you said you met when you were both fourteen? So high school?"
Tony's shaking his head. "Nope. We haven't talked about having an open relationship at all, but I for one think it would be best to keep it undeniably closed until everything settles, one way or another. If we want to revisit that at a later date, fine, but let's table that whole thing for right now."
They end up swapping Bro Stories (Tony's words): Steve tells him about all the fistfights Bucky fought at his side, and Tony tells him about all of Rhodey's (largely unsuccessful) attempts to keep him out of trouble at MIT. And his (much more successful) attempts to get Tony OUT of trouble once he was already in it.
The guy orders, then motions to Steve. He's so busy wondering what the fuck is happening here that he just orders on autopilot, and doesn't realize what he's done till the guy laughs. "Either you're an alcoholic with wildly divergent tastes or you just ordered drinks for your friends, too. Either way I salute your moxie." The barkeep sets down his drink just in time for him to pick it up and salute Steve.
"You're perfect," Tony says again, then kisses him. It stops the building hysteria of the situation, both of them sucking in a breath against each other's lips, and Tony breathes out into him, "Really fucking perfect."
"Steve," Tony says again. Just that. He doesn't agree, he doesn't protest, he just derails the entire argument with a single word and the gentle touch of his fingertips to Steve's cheek.
Steve laughs and says, "From my home to a court-martial, just how I've always dreamed," and launches into the next part, all to cover the fact that he desperately wishes Bucky
It's their fourth date, and they've seen each other twice more at unplanned points on their way into work. Tony's walked him home after every date, and he hasn't asked Tony up again. The talking about when they want to get down to the hanky-pank hasn't happened yet, and Steve doesn't want to spring it on him again. Wants to talk about it first.
," Tony hisses, leaning against the wall. He shakes his head and straightens up and Steve opens his mouth to start apologizing because clearly that was the opposite of the right thing to say but Tony smirks at him and says, "You are a menace, Steven. A menace."
Tony shakes his head and looks down at his phone. "I have no idea what he was going on about. Peter's his fiancé, for Chrissake."
"Well," Bucky says, stepping away from Steve and leaving him feeling cold, looking around at the remains of dinner and the open bottle of wine on the table by the couch. "Guess I should leave you guys to it. I'll be -"
Tony's not looking at him, either. "It's okay to be angry at me. I get it. I'm sorry. Did I mention that before? I am. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -"
Steve would like to pretend that no, he doesn't know this woman from Eve. But his Ma taught him to be honest even when it hurts, so he grits, "Yeah," because she's vivacious and she's beautiful and she was there.
Despite how much he wants to keep going Steve leaves it there, lets Bucky have a moment to process, and is very glad that Tony does the same.
Then Steve doubles over in laughter and Tony throws his head back to join, and they're probably getting weird looks but, oddly, Steve just doesn't care.
When Steve pulls back to gauge Tony's expression, Tony keeps staring at him. Then he lets out a shaky breath and says, "Okay. Yeah. Too much for a fifth date, and I get that, but okay. Message received."
Then Monday rolls around and Steve almost gives up on life. Because he walks from the bus to the building he works in and catches sight of a man in a grey suit with a distinctive goatee hurrying through the lobby, and almost smacks himself in the face when he realizes why Tony looked familiar the other night.
"Can't promise it won't be a bit gross," Steve says honestly, and laughs at the look of disgust on Tony's face. "I promise it's not slimy and that it won't stain, though. Tip your head back."
Steve cringes. "We were going to talk about - about stuff before we did anything. It just, we, um. It - we didn't really mean to, so. We hadn't talked yet. But it's not like that counted anyway -"
They do watch Cloud Atlas, and a single solitary hint regarding what it was about absolutely would have ruined it, and it definitely was exactly the right movie for them to watch at exactly the right time.
-It's wonderful. Talking to them both at the same time. Why is it that all the best parts of Steve's life are things that just can't last?
"The minute I get back, Steve, I am going to track this guy down and I am going to pound him into the
They both stop, taking deep breaths like they've suddenly stopped running. Steve's chest is heaving and he can feel his face scrunching up and he doesn't know
"Wonderful, but over quickly," Tony says, and then he's tugging at Steve's waist and tipping his head and his eyes are sliding closed like he's going under.
And Tony smiles at him, but it looks weary. "Or been treated well in turn, sure. But the thing is, I have - Steve, I have done a lot, a
The key goes into the lock with minimal fumbling after that, and just before he closes the door Steve turns around and says, "I really like you, Tony. I can't wait to see you again."
isn't to send Bucky news about himself, it's to read new words from Bucky. But that's not something he can ask for (at least, not without worrying Bucky, and the guy's got enough to worry about right now without knowing Steve got played), so he falls asleep reading through all Bucky's old emails instead. There's no point dwelling on Tony or what happened.
," and Wade's still shouting about polyamory and he could love them both so well and Tony's moving his thumb to hang up when Wade yells, "Wait a sec at least tell me if I know Peter in this universe!" and the line goes dead.
tell you that you talk too much you know you have a problem. Not that I'd want to forget hot Stevie! Did I tell you I stalked you to lunch one day and saw him? Stark. Stark," Wade says, over Tony's spluttering indignation, "Stark. You must tap that. Make sweet, sweet love to that pint-sized spitfire. Do you know what I would give for a threesome with you two? A lot, let me tell you. I'd give my left arm - Fuck, man, I'd give my left
He passes the phone back and Tony takes it without looking away from Steve's face. Their fingers brush. Steve pulls his hand back quickly.
So Steve does, going all the way to the end of his contacts and picking one of the last ones. Tony hits call as he looks to see who it is, and he simultaneously laughs and groans when he sees, putting a hand to his forehead. "This is either going to be really awesome really, really awful, and I don't know which is more likely."
"You're amazing," Tony breathes, and then he pulls back far enough to look down at him with wide-blown, dazed eyes, one hand tilting his face up towards his own with a thumb on the corner of his lips, and he just keeps saying over and over again, "you're amazing, you're so fantastic, you're, you're just so, and I -"
Bucky shakes his head, but he's not about to jump on a plane and commit murder anymore, so it's an improvement. "Steven Grant Rogers you call him right this second and tell him to come back."
Steve looks at him. He looks earnest, but not - Steve doesn't know. Whatever he was worried about, it's not really how Tony looks.
Steve gets halfway back to their table before he realizes his face is probably still red. He doesn't know how to deal with Sam and Nat. No idea what to say.
"It's more just," Steve sighs and waves a hand. "I don't know. I just, I tell him everything. And all the big things in our lives - well. Okay. All the big things in
Evidence in favor of Steve just not being all that attractive: every interaction with strangers his entire life.
"Tony, Tony," Steve says, catching his flailing hand and holding it to his chest. "I know. It's okay, all right? I know."
"Equilateral," Tony says. "No primary. Or, I guess, the relationship between all three of us being primary, however you want to look at it. But equal. Not Steve and I with you off to the side. No. All three of us equal."
Tony turns to Bucky. "We're not breaking up, and we're not - nothing bad is happening, okay? Nothing bad is going to happen, and nothing has to
How could Bucky take himself to the other side of the world where Steve can't just smack him upside the head and tell him to stop being an idiot? How could Bucky leave the comfort of their apartments, where Steve can just push Bucky into a chair and pile blankets and pillows on him until he admits defeat, curling up like a grumbling cat and calming in all the warmth? How could Steve have let this happen to them?
"James Buchanan Barnes," Steve says with as much dignity as he can muster while he's wrestling with the stupid blanket to get himself wrapped up and comfortably settled on the computer chair, "do not mock my blanket-burrito skills. I am cold and wet and I do not need your salt right now."
Tony shrugs, unrepentant. "And to make sure we all had a point of reference in common. And, hey, not everything is about you, you know. At least half the reason was so that I could use it to talk to Steve about it."
After a second he manages to remember that he can't just stand there staring off in the direction Tony went all night, so he turns to collect the drinks from the bar. It takes a bit of doing to carry three drinks in awkwardly-shaped glasses in only two hands, and by the time he's got them situated he's ready to die of embarrassment.
"Oh. Right," Steve says, because he managed to forget for like a whole two hours that he's got a Skype call with Bucky tonight.
"Nope," Steve says firmly. "I refuse to let either of you leave - I will nail the door shut if I have to. There's more than enough left from dinner and I'm sure you haven't eaten yet, Buck. So let's get you a plate while you explain what in the hell you're doing here, and then we can all have dessert and put in a movie or something."
conversations. I'm just saying. I mean I can't be sure, especially about specifics, but I know he's more laid back about relationships than I think you're giving him credit for. I mean. I'm not saying he'd want to go out with
like is going on. Because this, this right here, is why no one likes it when Nat goes to the bar: she gets hit on so much it's annoying for her and anyone waiting for her to get back, and painful for anyone else. Sam has much the same problem, though not quite so bad. And Steve? Gets to go instead of either of them, because he has never been hit on at a bar a day in his life.
"Steven Grant Rogers," Bucky says, smiling too wide to be stern. "I know you're just pulling my leg, because I don't think I've ever seen you this besotted before. You do realize that now if you don't go out with him again the bitch I'll be deserting to come choke is YOU, right, you punk?"
"Hold on," Bucky snaps. He stands up and a moment later the image blurs, and Steve watches with dizzying perspective as Bucky takes the laptop out into the baking sun so he can lose his mind at Steve in peace.
"Are you telling me," Bucky says through his teeth, the camera suddenly tilting to show his face against a startlingly blue sky,
"No," Steve says, pushing himself away from Tony, though he can't bring himself to actually get up. "We are not doing this. Virginity is a societal construct given circular and specious value based on whether or not women bartered as breeding chattel would produce sons who were unquestionably her husband's -"
“I believe in the good in you.” He confessed quietly, wondering even as he said it when the other shoe would fall.
It hadn’t been. Steve just hadn’t wanted Schmidt to be aware of his movements or try and prevent him leaving Vienna.
“Because they have to try and find their family.” Péter filled in when the silence had stretched too painfully, sparing either Cameron or Daniel from either having to defend their action or beg pardon for it.
"It's Christmas Eve, Tony." Steve stopped him before he could finish, He laid a hand on Tony's arm and Tony stepped toward him, his mouth turned down in a pensive line. "Just promise me you'll tell one of us if it becomes too much. Bucky and I make good distractions when you need a break." Tony said, and Steve grinned, reaching until their hands brushed together and Tony wrapped their fingers together.
"I will have Milthede pack my things. I intend to be gone by evening." Charlotte said as she strode purposefully for the door. She'd only just grasped the handle and pulled it open when Stefen caught her elbow, the grip unbearably gentle despite the tension coiled tightly around them.
“How is your aunt?” he asked. The aging woman had come from abroad to mind Charlotte’s home after she’d been forced to leave on such short notice. Steve suspected the greater reason for it was to try and convince her niece to make the journey to England. Charlotte was a single woman, alone, with most of her remaining family scattered abroad. Her ties to the rest of her kin in Vienna were pleasant but impersonal. Her early decision not to shun Peggy for the disadvantageous match she’d made, and Charlotte’s own political activism with the suffragettes made sure that most of her remaining relations kept a polite distance. She said she preferred it that way, but still Steve thought it must get lonely.
The doorbell buzzed again, insistently, and this time she stiffened in apprehension, slowing her packing. They couldn’t have come for her this soon could they? It had only been a few days. Her father’s sizeable contributions to the State Police should have bought her a little more time. Slowly she crept toward the door of her room, ears straining for the sounds coming from the hall as she heard her housekeeper answer the door, followed by the sound of approaching footsteps.
Steve watched him, unsure of how long they sat staring at one another. When he did speak the words felt like stones in his mouth.
“I don’t believe I have to answer that.” The monk, whose name must be Nik growled. “What are you doing here Stark? I thought I made it clear to Major Roger’s how dangerous – ”
“Because I gave him permission to Captain.” She held his stare though the tight grip of one hand on her wrist betrayed her nervousness.
“You don’t tell me what’s going on in that head of yours but let me tell you what’s going on in mine.” Tony announced softly, drawing Steve out of the downward spiral of his thoughts. “Where you go, I go. Where you live, I live. Wherever you die, they’re going to have to bury me right beside you.”
Dvorak didn’t see him fall, because he was already falling himself his momentum halted by the violent punch of bullets.
“Then we give you a good reason to come back.” Tony shot back, thoughts already racing to find a solution to the problem. Then the answer was there, clicking into place like a puzzle piece.
Steve drew to stop just outside the open doors of the music room but not because of Bucky’s warning.
“What do you think you're doing?! Do you realize what I-” catching himself Steve bit off the words, and unable to finish the sentence he whirled away from the infuriating monk. His gaze settled on Frau Hogan.
“Then perhaps you think I’m a child?” he snapped in reply, finally finding whatever it was in his trunks he was looking for and closing it with a snap. As he came forward Steve saw he had an old journal in hand. The same one Steve often saw him scribbling in at home.
She knew the answer was not always. She wasn’t a fool. But when one was in love, what was there to do but hope?
"Tony wouldn't do that!" Ian denied sharply, and Artur scowled at James, balling his fists like he was considering punching him. James just shrugged.
He thought adamantly, beating back the flutters of anxiety in his stomach that wanted to become full-blown panic. He glanced first to the bed where Ian, James, Artur and Sara still slept in a tangle. Thankfully. God, Artur had cried himself sick after Bucky had left, about his blasted frog of all things. It seemed absurd on the surface, only, Tony knew very well it wasn’t a small thing to leave a pet behind for a young boy, and a pet wasn’t the only loss he was suffering. Perhaps just the easiest one to process for someone so young.
“You know they are Tony.” It had been months since they had gotten in touch with Jann, who had gotten in touch with The Castle, and it was now February, going into March. Rescue was not coming quickly, but it would come because they needed Steve for the mission.
Tony wondered how Pepper dealt with so many versions of what Tony was beginning to coin the Rogers stubbornness.
Steve cradled his throbbing hand and closed his eyes, the split in his lip that refused to heal burned as he mouthed his never-ending prayer.
Even though he was armed and he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he would kill them before they had the chance to touch his family, it was still the longest drive of his life.
Steve’s mind was racing, suddenly regretting bringing the children with him. He needed to talk to her alone.
In the end James and Ian took turns with the pistol, both managing quite well despite their youth to Tony’s surprise.
“Magda, if you’ve put the family in danger…” the man warned. A relative of hers from the sound of it. Good, Steve thought. He had slightly better odds with an untrained fighter.
‘I can’t change this’ Steve wanted to say, implored silently in some bitter hope that whatever distance was between them now, they still wouldn’t need words to hear one another. ‘I can’t change it and I don’t want to.’
By the time that Brother Bruce came to relieve him Tony had been scrubbing the floors of the infirmary for so long that the light from the candles had become little more than stubs. Although it was dim they cast a stubborn glow over the stone walls and mostly empty beds like the most resolute of soldiers. Looking at them reminded Tony of too many things he didn’t want to think about (too many bodies burnt through like cheap wax and just as carelessly tossed away). Tony had seen more than a few soldiers in his time, having lived through the Great War.
“You’ll be dead by nightfall.” Dvorak responded with another shake of his head, and there was something hollow in his eyes now. A dark pit with no bottom. “Find a hole Rogers. Find a hole and bury yourself in it where no one will ever find you. That’s all we can give our children now.”
Gathering his wits, Tony hurried after them. There was no sight or sound of alarm down at the worksite, and with the train yet to pull away they weren’t visible from the station but there was no time to lose. The police would finish searching the train soon enough and find the door of the luggage car open. It was like waiting in a powder keg. Any second from now the alarm could raise, the combined forces of the S.S. and the state police raining down on them. Tony helped Bucky secure the children in the back, double and triple checking that they were well hidden before running to get in the passenger side – Bucky so intent on getting them out of there that he started the automobile before Tony had even managed to sit and close the door behind himself.
Charlotte tipped her head at him curiously from the end of the hallway and Bucky rubbed at his face, quickly straightening up. Music flitted in from the open door behind her. She took a few steps towards him, eyeing the drink clasped in his hand with worry.
When they finally reached the hilltop the children barely waited long enough for Tony to unpack their lunch bags and spread the blanket out before collapsing onto the grass. Not minding Artur’s sprawled form Tony placed their basket of food next to him and promptly flopped on to the ground in a similar fashion, exhausted.
“They say we’ll be at war before the month is out but there is a chance still, that all the fuss is for nothing. Don’t you think?” Bethany asked, with an air of hopefulness. “Mr. Chamberlin is a very sensible man, and something good will come of these peace talks. I’m sure of it.”
Behind him, Ian giggled, and Tony was just so glad that he was there alive to make that sound that he for a moment he didn’t even feel the pain in his body.
The car slowed as Hogan pulled up to the curb outside the ticketing booth. It was not very crowded this time in the morning in the middle of the week, so it was easy to spot Henry Osborn and Robert Drake in their HJ uniforms, their bicycles parked nearby where they leaned against the wall just beside the door of the booth. At first, surprised delight shot through Peter at the fact that his friends were there when he’d not expected to have a chance to say a proper goodbye. But then it was followed by the horror of actually having to do it.
“Could you imagine not being a sanctimonious prick?” Tony grumbled without the energy for heat and Pepper glared at him in warning as Julia broke out in a suspicious cough. But Hammer seemed content this morning pretending to ignore him.
“The Captain did not order this.” Tony reminded her, because if she knew Stefen even a little bit she had to know how he was going to react when he saw this. “You had no right to do this!”
“I do.” Tony allowed, wondering where Stefen intended to take this. Stefen stepped closer, and the tension between them changed yet again, back to that low thrumming intensity that had his stomach fluttering.
For as large as this steel flying death trap was, it was still cramped in the bunks where Captain D’Anvers stored them, behind the flight engineer’s compartment. Besides Carol herself, her crew consisted of four others. First, there was Martin Vayle the navigator, who Steve would bet had some sort of relationship going on with Carol. The painfully professional way she introduced him was a dead giveaway. Especially in contrast to the almost offhanded way she introduced the remaining three: Quill, Drax and Rocket. Last names only and in the case of “Rocket”, a nickname he’d picked up somewhere in basic training.
“I don’t, but I’ve had seven babies, as Tony likes to keep pointing out. So, I’m a little biased towards them,” Steve answered with a chuckle and Ian sighed, accepting the wisdom in those words easily.
“What are you saying?” Bucky asked, sounding like he’d only understood about half of the words coming out of Tony’s mouth, and Tony growled in frustration.
“I knew your Da wasn’t in his head.  I shoulda stayed, but we’d made a promise to a good friend and I – I put, the mission before my family. We all did. Tony, your dad and I, we’re the ones who should be ashamed. Not you.”
The boys had gotten progressively more vocal throughout the lesson, eager to try the moves themselves. Steve pushed Bucky by the shoulders and sent him stumbling backward.
“He’ll get it there.” Stefen responded shortly, tone making it clear that no more would be said on the subject.
Dear God, let me find him before he gets hurt, or slips and falls off the side of the mountain, or meets up with a hungry bear.
“Tony, no one is going to volunteer to take all seven of them.” Pepper pointed out, but he’d already thought of it, had already worked out that even if someone did, they’d want to separate them it would be easier to mold them that way.
Not only was there a high demand for translators to assist non-Italian speaking students, it was deemed prudent to teach rudimentary French and English to all, to give them a better start in their new lives. Cousin Benjamino had ratted out Tony’s proficiency with languages and previous occupation as a tutor to the Rabbi and that had been that.
A better man would have spared more than a passing thought about her safety, but Steve could see the strategy in it. His godfather was already aware of their past connection and it wasn’t unlikely that Tony would have sought her out had he truly come to Pola alone and penniless.
He could just use the key. That’s why he’d asked for it, to have access to Tony’s locked room for God’s sake, but now that he was there and he could hear Tony on the other end of the door he’d put between them, Steve couldn’t bring himself to open it. It seemed wrong somehow without Tony’s permission. A strange feeling to have perhaps, considering Steve was master of the house and all the other times he’d barged in on Tony in the music room or his workshop but the feeling rooted his feet to the spot nonetheless.
“I’m sure you’re eager to know why we’ve pulled you out of your retreat at the monastery.” Stanislov turned to him with a cheeky sort of smirk, implying some shared joke. “Is it true you took up teaching? I could hardly believe it when they told me. Hugh and I couldn’t keep you in the schoolroom. I always thought that’s why you preferred the cushy life of a monk.”
The driver went down with a couple of slugs to the chest. The soldier in the front seat was already out of the car, using the door for a shield and taking aim. Bucky ignored him.
Tony had almost stumbled over a stone on the path at the unexpected sight of another black man outside of the abbey. Niklas was not the only man of African descent he had encountered in his life - he’d known another boy years ago, an Afro-Hungarian like Nik whom Hughard in a rare moment of compassion had offered lodging to in exchange for household labor - but they had never been popular, and these days they were about as welcome as Jews, gypsies, tramps and thieves had ever been. He did not know what it meant that a man like Captain Rogers had such a fellow in his employ. Perhaps the fellow had been employed there for years and the captain was unaware of the ever growing liability he had tilling his soil beds. Tony hoped for the gardener’s sake that the captain didn’t figure it out any time soon.
“It’s a shame. We’d talked about having a party for him,” Tony sighed and Charlotte hummed in thought.
“Ma’am. Aren’t you forgetting something?” Stefen asked with a raised brow and she stared for a moment longer before something seemed to click.
Tony didn’t understand it. Rogers was not the ogre Tony had once thought him. He was far from unfeeling. He’d given every indication of wanting to be a good father and domesticity looked far too good on him to fool anyone (least of all a genius) into think that family life didn’t make the man happy.
He’d find peace if he could just be with his family. Tony had been trying to show him that. He saw that now. Saw how he’d been trying to go home for years. Searching for it, ever since he left the caravan in search of his father in order to bring back food for his mother. He and Bucky had left the caravan that day and promised to come home, only somehow Steve had gotten lost along the way and he had never figured out how to go get back.
He could see the Music Hall at times, rising above most of the other buildings in the square but he had no idea if Tony and the children were still there, or what condition they’d be in - Steve grabbed a passing man by his jacket, gripping him tightly as he asked if he’d heard any word about the Behringer being attacked.
The second half of the November arc. After discovering Peter's deception Tony and Steve face an unforeseen tragedy as violence sweeps through the nation. With clear lines drawn, it is up to good people to act, and Tony is ready to take up that challenge with fire and fury.
Prastlo- (romany) dishonored/unclean status. *The Rom do not follow any specific religion however they place a high emphasis on what is “clean” and “not clean”.
“Of course!” Hammer insisted with a snap. “But the captain would be unhappy with him receiving vagrants in his home!”
Tony was sad enough that he didn’t have the energy to jump a foot at Clinton’s unexpected voice at his back. He didn’t turn as the boy came to stand beside him, nor did he bother asking how he’d snuck up without Tony hearing him. Instead he just took a deep breath and heaved a sigh, feeling relief at the return of feeling in his arms and legs and the ability to inspire movement.
“I bought a record.” Stefen admitted gruffly, eyes lowering to examine some dusty memory. “The sailor had to go to war and leave behind the people he loved… I don’t need to be as fluent in Italian as you to understand that.”
“It’s been over twenty years Nik and his world is only getting smaller.” There was a note of finality in Fil’s tone that made Nik want to heave another sigh, that or retreat to his rooms for a long bath and order no one to bother him. He knew that Antony had never belonged there, and he didn’t need Coulson to remind him that his temporary solution had about run its course. The abbey was no longer safe for Tony Stark. The damnable trouble with that was few places in the world were.
Steve forced his arms to move again, forced them to wrap around his son and hold him tighter. Péter sank down against him, allowing it, relieving some of the strain, and Steve felt him start to tremble. Steve thought he heard him sniffle as he continued to mumble that he was alright, but it was hard to hear anything over the sound of his own heart hammering away in his chest, beating out a rhythm in tandem with Péters.
“Of course. Come inside, you’re cold as a lamp post. Hortense pull that chair up close to the oven.”
“Av akai,” Patroche butted against his hand and nibbled at his fingers. Steve smiled, tears pricking at his eyes in a sweet rush, so he squeezed them closed again and breathed deeply. “Atsh me develesa.” he murmured, the blessing fumbling off his tongue. He bent down and kissed the goat’s hairy head. Even though the smell of must and hay was overwhelming in his nose Steve held on tight to its warm neck. “Nais tuke.”
Natacha had been braver. She'd dived on the man trying to take their sister before Ian could unfreeze his legs. By the time he'd snapped out of the fear and thrown himself on the man's back he'd already hit Natacha twice, swelling her cheek black and blue. If he'd been braver, quicker, maybe it wouldn't have happened. But it definitely would not have happened if those men hadn't decided he and his siblings were Jew sympathizers. And it hadn't just been men. It had been boys too.
Though he’d been expecting the call from Oxford that wasn’t the reason Steve’s heart quickened in his chest. His head was already turning towards the elevators. New since the renovation, electric, some lazy part of his brain remembered. Tony had probably been thrilled by it.
“He’ll come back,” Natacha insisted, her eyes going flinty. When Ian opened his mouth she gave him such a look that he slowly closed it again.
There were men in white coats everywhere, presumably tending to the men who filled the beds, taking notes on their clipboards under the heavy lights. The mechanical hum of machinery was loud, even under the groans and moans of the patients who filled the ward.
Despite the dark blood covering the figure and his agonized groan of pain, the soldiers were brusque as they unceremoniously dumped him upon the nearest available bed. As the remaining doctors rushed to his bedside like flies the soldiers barked frantic orders for Wolfe to follow them. There was a prisoner revolt breaking out in the yard.
It was only she, her sister and their parents here on the farm. Her brother was studying in Munich. Her father had suffered an injury years ago and while the incident had not taken his life it had taken his leg.  Her mother worked the house and took care of the father while she and her sister worked the farm. Neither of her parents would have any need to be in the barn, and they would attribute any noise from within as coming from Patroche. He could rest there and heal before she had him hauled back to finish his sentence.
“Or so it worked back in caveman times,” Stark cut in. “These days we’re a little more civilized about courting. Not every unit that gets down and dirty after Mission Accomplished winds up as a pack, and orders come from the brass, not whichever omega in the field has the sharpest teeth. They’re pretty vestigial these days.”
Then again, staying dry would make the rest of the evening a lot more painful, so maybe Tony should be counting his blessings. What were the odds that the fearsome Captain of the North would ever take a conquered omega trophy seriously anyway? Being treated like a skittish pet was probably the best he could hope for. Even Stane hadn’t been cruel to his own dogs.
Tony fisted one hand in Steve’s tunic and pressed the other against the carpet, not sure if he was trying to steady himself or to keep himself from grabbing onto Steve directly.
“Okay,” Steve said peaceably, then reared up to bowl Tony over again, not even trying to pin him, just for the fun of watching Tony twist out of his hold. One tricky elbow lock later and Tony was braced over him and kissing down Steve’s stomach. His mouth was hot and wet and inventive, and under other circumstances Steve would have gladly let Tony stay between his thighs for an hour just exploring, but his heat was pulsing inside him, adding urgency to every touch.
recorder, I don’t need yet another sex tape leaking, but data collection, data collection is important.”
The Captain might come to regret his bargain, no matter how difficult it would have been for him to secure an omega otherwise, once he got to know what Tony was actually like. All he’d seen of Tony so far was a glimpse across the room. Stane had made sure to have Tony visible in the hall where the negotiations were being conducted, so the Captain and his people could see what was on offer. No sense in buying without inspecting the merchandise first. Tony had been kept away from the main table where the alphas were talking, of course, but the Captain had given Tony one look--one measuring, focused sweep that had knocked the air from Tony’s lungs--and then kept his eyes to himself for the rest of the negotiations. Tony wasn’t sure whether to take that as a good sign, or a very, very bad one.
The sight of the trees parting to reveal the lush grounds of the villa sat on the edge of a glittering mountain lake had taken Steve’s breath away the first time he’d driven up this road with Peggy, and despite everything else going on it was no different that afternoon. Bucky too seemed to sit up straighter at the sight of it, a small smile tugging at his mouth at the sight. This beautiful home tucked away from the city had become sanctuary. Steve realized quite suddenly, watching the unhidden gleam of anticipation growing in his friend’s eyes, that in his grief he might have pushed Bucky out of it. Bucky had a family of his own but they’d always been home for each other. He’d let that change.
“I’ve not seen anything that would make me feel Herr Stark should be out of a job, just yet. His manners are lacking, clearly, but I see no reason to dismiss him.”
“Hey Stevie?” Steve grunted in acknowledgment and Bucky turned to him. “What did Stark say to you, that day at breakfast?”
, but perhaps pitied rather than condemned. They had that going for them, all except for Péter and Maria. Maria especially. She was not as fair as Péter and looked dangerously more like their people with every year that passed. His beautiful Maria.
“Because it matters.” She answered slowly, staring out at the water with her chin propped up on her knees. “I’m not as little as you think. You don’t have to hide it from me.”
“Where have you and your family set up?” Dagmar asked quietly. Ian turned to look at him and found the man scrutinizing him. He suddenly felt cold again. He worried his lip between his teeth as he tried to think of what to say.
“Don’t worry, I’m too fast for him,” Steve assured Maria who had her hands clutched tightly to her chest in worry.
“Soldiers would come through seeking food and medical aid. They’d ask for prayers and tell us stories of the war effort, but I hardly heard any of them. I was too numb. But then one day there was a new story, about this boy. They were calling him ‘the lion of Austria’. He was even younger than I was, but they said he stood up to an entire regiment of enemy troops and prevented the enemy from advancing on an undefended village.”
Tony didn’t turn to watch his words land. He was too furious. If he looked at Hammer, he couldn’t swear he wouldn’t try to kill him.
, I'm alright. I ran into some trouble, but it was nothing I can't handle, yeah?" He smiled at her confidently, prompting her to smile weakly in return and squeezed her hand once more before letting go.  "I worried you’d get caught in that mess. Thank God you're all alright."
“Not even the friendly informant who offers to iron our clothes in exchange for execution?” Tony snipped, irritable with the anxiety of ever-present danger, and the unknown that waited for them at their destination. “However will we manage?”
Tony turned the pistol over in his hands. Margrit Rogers had a pistol? A bubble of laughter tickled his gut and he quickly staunched it. Of course she’d had a pistol. It was strangely easy to imagine the beautiful woman in the old photograph pointing a pistol at someone. Thinking of her daughter, Tony would place good money on Margrit Rogers suffering no fools. He wondered how she’d taken to Stefen’s moods, if he’d always had them, or if they were a scar of war. He wondered with some mirth if she had ever turned the pistol on Stefen in jest. God knew he could tempt a man at times.
But Steve could not lay still. He lay, a towel from the washroom over his face willing the chill to leave his body. Thoughts bounced through his head, never catching.
There was an increased desperation since the Night of Glass, a white eyed fear in the faces of otherwise brave men and women. A ticking clock behind every breath.
“You've been away for a while,” Sam began again, gentler. “I just thought you'd like to spend more time with the children.”
The Academy was "offering" Péter a place there contingent on his exam scores, but Steve knew very well it was not truly an offer. It was a demand, undoubtedly set in motion by General Schmidt, who was determined to hold Stefen's children hostage in order to guarantee his obedience.  Interfering with the children, forcing him to attend that damn dinner in Berlin. It was all about reminding Steve of the power they held over him.
They were lucky. They had been so damn lucky. Lucky that Tony had been curious about the yelling outside, hadn’t tried to ignore it or drown it out by increasing the volume of the orchestra.  Lucky that he’d gone to look and that he’d correctly guessed they’d target the Music Hall. One of the few places in Salzburg where Jews could still belong.
"Then what do you suggest we do Stark, fly?" Bucky sneered, but if Bakhuizen thought Tony was going to start wilting just because Stefen's best friend wasn't his biggest fan he was going to be sorely disappointed.
Good men and women, the truly innocent ones like Yinsen, and the Grandparents he’d never really been allowed to know, they would be arrested or killed. Because that was the state of the world.
"Good morning Da," he called out hopefully as Steve entered, taking a hasty sip from his mug as he pushed back his chair. "I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd start my routine early this morning… with you. Natacha said you wouldn’t mind."
Normally, flowers like that would snag his attention on principle but he was anxious to look for Natacha, so Tony was not paying them close attention at all. It was only the familiar dark plum coat that one of them wore that stopped him in his tracks, triggering something in his mind. He froze just beyond the door, quickly turning back around and exiting again.
“That’s shit Péter,” Harry cursed, releasing a long stream of acrid smoke with a glare. Péter was discomforted by the smell, the way the buttons on Harry’s shirt gleamed in the moonlight, the heat of aggression in his eyes that made him look far older than his fifteen years. “We’ve played together since we could walk. How many times have you fallen from this very tree?” Harry nodded aggressively at the branches hanging above them and Péter flinched.
They both stiffened when footsteps outside drew closer. Two men lifted the flap of the tent and peered inside. Tony tensed immediately. One of them was an alpha, and
The reminder kindled something vicious in her eyes, at odds with the almost demure way she had settled onto his cock. She rolled her hips, fast and sudden, her inner muscles giving him a hard squeeze. He grinned up at her, letting his exhilaration show, and her returning smile was feral.
The ships were flying the Captain’s colors, red and blue rings with a white star in the middle, but below the Captain’s standard was a yellow flag, not the black flag Tony had expected. A black flag would have meant an assault was imminent. A yellow flag meant the Captain was willing to parlay, and if he was willing to negotiate, Tony knew exactly what Stane was going to offer him. There was only one bargaining chip in the city valuable enough to buy off the most feared barbarian of the north.
“Bad luck for him,” Steve said serenely. His arms wrapped around Tony’s shoulders, supporting his arms without jostling the spyglass. “How soon until they see us and sound the alarm?”
“Now would be good,” Steve said absently, his mind working through the ramifications of this new development, shifting course from containment and clean-up logistics to dealing with a victory heat. If he’d been back with his old team, he would’ve known how to handle it. Scout out a safe location, post half his men on watch, rotate them out in pairs so everyone had a chance to enjoy the celebration, and burn through his heat hard and fast so they’d be ready to move by morning. He’d done it with the commandos a few times, after particularly successful raids. They’d had a system. They’d all known what they were getting into.
Steve didn’t reply, but he was still smiling. Maybe Tony’s babble was cute when it was incomprehensible. “Like I’m a pet. How charming and not at all demeaning. Is this really working for you?”
Tony didn’t take his eyes off the spyglass before shifting his weight back, knowing without looking that Steve would be there waiting to pull him against his chest. “Good morning, beloved. Can you believe he’s still using the same cannon design Howard built a decade ago?”
Steve broke the stare first. He glanced around the tent, taking in the rest of the tribute Stane had provided, without seeming particularly interested in it. His forehead creased in a thoughtful frown as his hands went to the buckles of his shield harness, undoing the clasps and lowering the shield to the side of the tent’s opening. He unpinned his cloak and draped it over a carved marble statue of a rearing horse that had stood in the entry hall since before Tony’s birth. Tony had always thought the damn thing was hideous, and apparently so had Stane, since he’d taken this as an opportunity to get rid of it.
“Bossy, bossy.” Stark stripped off without ceremony, Banner only hesitating for a moment before joining in. Banner and Stark were apparently free from the body shyness Steve had observed in some alphas. It figured that if Banner woke up naked in front of strangers after coming back from the Hulk he’d lose modesty pretty fast, and Stark had apparently never met a taboo he didn’t want to cross.
But that was a thought for another time. For now the battle was over, his team had won, and he could take a night to revel in their united strength, in all that they could do to help each other and the world.
Steve could feel someone watching him before he even opened his eyes. He kept motionless, every nerve alert and ready to defend himself. Ready for pain. Eyes watching, always watching. Eyes from the tower surrounded in barbed wire rifles at the ready. Eyes reporting. Dissecting. He was always watched.
"Children, I would like to introduce you to Anya and Péter Maximoff. They work with your uncle, though no one has explained what they are doing in my dining room." This he directed at Stark along with a stare that would have cowed seasoned soldiers, but Stark remained undeterred.
“Then don’t let them be distracted. And don’t you get distracted either. The important thing now is to make sure the children are safe.”
Agent Holmes didn’t need to say that the same risk applied to Tony Stark, nor did he need to say any more plainly for either of them to get the message. Tony Stark could take his chances with the tribunal if he liked. Stefen Rogers would not be wise to try. Tony clenched his teeth together, simmering with rage. SIS had known all along that Stefen would be arrested if he stepped foot in London, and they had kept him ignorant of that fact on purpose to ensure he agreed to their mission. He was a captive now. Holmes was just politely showing him who held the key to the cage.
Dvorak smirked, watching the distance between himself and the first car get smaller and smaller, turning at just the right moment.
Steve believed him. He knew that neither of them would willingly do anything to hurt the family but they were still just children. They could not be responsible for knowing what may or may not be dangerous to say, not completely.
“Perfect.” Stefen decided with a satisfied smile, leaning back slightly to observe Tony in it for a moment before meeting his eyes once more. He looked so happy, as if finally, something wrong had been set to rights. Tony couldn’t take it. His heart felt like it was going to burst in his chest.
Stefen wasn’t a bad helping hand in a kitchen. He could peel a potato faster than he could spit and Tony remembered fondly what he’d told him about helping the women with their work. He was certainly more help than Bucky, who was happily dipping into the mulled wine. It should surprise no one that Tony was practically useless in a kitchen, but Stefen harbored an unfortunate delusion that he could improve with effort.
The story of the captain’s exhaustion was written in his skin. It stretched over his bones, making him thinner in places than he’d been only a few weeks before. There were new bumps and bruises and small patches of rash brought on by the dryness that army issued soap left behind. Was this love then? The way you could care for a body more than you cared for your own? The way you could cherish the flesh of another, and grieve for the marks of age and abuse you were not there to witness? Was this love then, the way pain and words of accusation fell away, caged behind his teeth, meaningless when he could press their flesh together and sooth? Flesh to flesh, wound to wound, and so brought together, so they were healed.
Stefen was still ill, easily knocked over by the damn wind, but of course none of that mattered. Stefen stood up and put himself in between Bucky and Stark like a human shield and Bucky saw red.
“Germany cannot be allowed to hold those waters.” The captain said, “This is what we must do to protect our families. To protect our world. There is nowhere to run Stark. We have to fight!”
Just when Ian thought he'd been found out, his father gestured for him to come in. Ian padded over and held out his dress blouse.
Ian blinked at him from his upside down position on his bed, the comic book he held balanced precariously on his knees almost whacking him in the face as he attempted to sit up, his eyes widening at the sight of his tutor.
Steve growled, shaking his head to clear it, battling against the falling sensation that wanted to overwhelm him.
"It's been too long Stefen truly," Nigel Frank had other things on his mind besides party games. A short man with half a head of hair and perpetually red cheeks that gave him a permanently flustered appearance, Nigel probably hadn’t engaged in something like a race since boyhood. He preferred artistic pursuits and Steve had a good idea why the man had tried so hard since his arrival to corner him. Steve had done a good job at dodging him until the elderly Frau Holster had held him up to talk about the birth of her fifth grandchild.
Only a few days ago Steve had not dared to dream of an after. He knew better than to hope for an “after the war” when one was a traitor and a spy. He’d made his peace as much as he could, thinking the future was not something he would get to see. But now, with the Coulson offer on the table and to possibility of avoiding Hitler’s war before it ever started? Now the possibilities were endless. And every last one that Steve could imagine started and ended with the man in front of him. If he could only just-
