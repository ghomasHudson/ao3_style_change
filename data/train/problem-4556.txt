"Oh. I see. Then...why did you want to go to the bed, earlier?"
The minutes pass, and I just close my eyes, allowing the electricity of his touch to build up like a charge within me, coiling in the core of my being. I wait, and I am rewarded; I can feel his deliberation in his fingers, and hear it in his breath, but he ultimately decides to be brave. The backs of his fingers brush lightly over my stomach as he reaches for my belt. I feel his fingers tremble and lose their grip, but when I move to help him, he pushes my hand away.
in it that's not total bullshit.
He falls silent, his lower lip trembling and his eyes just a little too bright for the afternoon sun's rays to be responsible.
He raises a shaking hand to his lips. His green eyes are wide with panic; his pupils dilate; cheeks flushed. When I kissed him, he'd dropped the beer he'd been holding. It has fallen onto the weathered planks, a wide arc of foamy liquid spilling across the timber. Consequently, the fresh lakeside air is flavoured by the pungent smell of fermented grain, and beer froth fizzes into nothingness at our feet. But Dean's eyes are locked firmly on mine as he struggles to comprehend what has transpired between us.
The tip of my dick is crimson, and the lust is starting to make me feel lightheaded, but Cas is just blue eyes and elegant fingers--
"I don't know how to do this, Cas."
When he speaks, his voice is barely more than a whisper.

privilege," I tell him, which is true, and he goes silent, and very, very red, his mouth hanging open.
"I hope your other friends don't all do that thing I did for you."
Bastard.
It goes in easy. My body just...opens up to him. I'm a wet, well-lubed, needy mess, and I want that eternal wave of unrelenting pleasure back. Pronto.
After a moment's hesitation, Dean complies. His shirt hits the floor, and moments later his jeans and shorts follow.
ache. I start stroking myself, using my fingers to echo the tight grip of my asshole around Cas' cock. But I let his thrusts be the thing that moves me. I let my cock be guided through my grip by the force of

By that logic, if the theory and the sequence of the five stages is correct, then...perhaps he is closer to acceptance than I could have ever dared to hope.
I reach down to his hip, letting my hand rest there with intent as I gaze into his eyes.
"Coffee's on the counter," says Dean.
He spreads his arms and bears down, using his shoulders to press Cas' raised knees to his chest. Pliant and greedy, Cas sinks into the cushions, his hands overhead, gripping roughly at the sofa's arm as he drags Dean all the way inside him.
I stand up, moving away from Cas, turning away from them both to try and hide the fact that I'm roughly the colour of a beetroot, and to conceal from Sam the awkward fact that I've got a semi.
'Love tank'.
He seems to be slowly adjusting to the idea that I love him. That I am
There's things I want to say to him. Things like
"Are you alright, Dean?" he asks gently.
"Cas..."
I know he's trying to be restrained--trying to put me first--but I can feel his resolve starting to crumble. Which is good, because if he really wants to put me first, he's going to need to put that whole angelic thing to the side for a damn second. Or an hour. Or the night.
Cas' lips curve into a smile at the words. "Well, then," he murmurs, passing his thumb over the red tip of his own cock and sighing, "get the lubricant, Dean."
I rest my face in the crook of his neck, heaving in the smell of his skin, as well as the less-familiar smells of guy sex. The fact that they're unfamiliar smells doesn't seem to bother my cock, which is jabbing urgently against Cas' hip: I reach down to adjust it, with a muffled apology, but Cas just reaches for my hand, and replaces it back on his own, coaxing my fingers under the elastic of his waistband to cup his balls. Which I actually...I don't mind. They're soft, and still a little heavy, and my stomach does this weird flippy thing as I sort of remember exactly what I've got in my hand.
I lean down, pressing my lips to his throat and letting him use my weight on his body as a lever point, so that he can get the angle just right. His fingers dig roughly into my back, and I feel him bracing his feet against the mattress, knees up as he slides in and out of my fist.
Normally there's not a bunch of difference between what I think and how I feel. But what's happening now is not 'normal', not by any stretch of the imagination. And what I think and what I feel have never been so far apart. The things that I'm thinking...I've thought them for decades, and I believed them. Things about myself, and they won't change--
"Let me."
“Well, now we do.”
"--don't need to sleep. Yeah, I know. That's not why I'm asking, Cas."
The thanks he gets is a knife in the back.
Still smirking, Cas steps away; goes over to the bedside table and gets the lube out of the drawer. Dean unbuttons his shirt and pulls off his t-shirt, and by the time he's done that, Cas has returned, setting the lube on the tallboy at Dean's side and reaching for the front of his own trousers.

?" I ask, deliberately injecting my tone with shock and horror to see if I can get Dean to make a joke of his own, which is almost always a worse alternative.

He looks confused. "But...but you just said that you...that you..."
"Thank you. And I'm...glad that you're safe."
friends, man?"
"You're not listening to me. Dean, I--"
They say that angels don't really understand hunger or thirst, but whenever they're together like this--whenever Cas kisses Dean so hard it feels like he's trying to taste his soul--Dean is pretty sure that that's not true. Times like these, Cas is

I nod again, licking my dry lips and shifting back into the armchair. I'm too ashamed to speak, but Cas just smiles at me, the corners of his eyes crinkling softly as he unbuttons and unzips my pants. He only pulls my underwear down enough to let little Dean make his leap to freedom.

Cas shrugs. "I don't know, Dean. He told me that I have not done a very good job of concealing it."
I'm pretty much expecting the hot, wet mess that spurts over my fingers and the back of my hand as he cums. The fact that the light blows when he does, not so much.
I guess those coals haven't cooled off yet, after all.
His wings. It's his wings. I can feel them now. They're making everything feel soft, even though I want to be angry.
, and then there he is, cuffed and bound and indecently exposed, attached to a wall hook with his own belt buckle, the brickwork rough on his back and Cas close to him, but not close enough.
That's why I'm pretty sure I'll be able to break through his reluctance. He's trying to be good, but I can feel him starting to give in. He's starting to kiss back; parting his lips a little wider; his hands gripping my waist a little tighter. And, most telling of all, he's shifting under me, sinking into the couch to try to hide the way his cock is hardening against my leg.
He puts the gun down, and goes over to where Cas is lying along the couch, with his feet up on the armrest. Cas had finally allowed his wardrobe to expand beyond suits and trenchcoats. He even owns his own clothes. Still, in the same way he has his own room but only uses Dean's, most of the time at least one thing he's wearing technically belongs to Dean. And Dean, it turns out, kind of gets off on seeing Cas lounge around in
I'm just trying to coax him into the kiss, if I'm honest, but I'm hoping that Cas will mistake it for a sound of agreement.
"Good morning," I say, more loudly than I usually might, just so they both catch on to the fact that I'm in the room.
I think...I think I want to know what it feels like to have that hot burst happen
This time, the sound I make has an unintentional note of appreciation to it, and he smiles. A warm hand grips the back of my thigh, and he pulls me forward so that my knee hooks over his leg. He shifts closer, and I obediently raise my head so he can slip his outstretched bed-side arm under my neck.
"Okay." I steal my hand back to stroke his hair, then pull it away to undress myself.
A small moan passes through his lips, but it is just a sound, lacking independent meaning. I shush him gently, and shift my weight so that his head can rest more securely on my shoulder.
"Do I
Cas senses it--of course he does. Still, he's not afraid. What's he got to fear from me? I'm just a human.
before you--"
"Dean."
Dean latches on to the instructions like a lifeline. It's always like this: when he gets frayed at the edges, and starts to unravel, in bad ways, or sad ways, Cas--his voice, his touch--is the thread that stitches him back together. He was just a rag when Cas found him, but his angel has turned him into a tapestry. Cas once told him that he was beautiful, and all he could think, then and now, was
He grins, a ray of sunshine flickering back to life through his gloom. "You mean, you don't go down on all
The sob comes from somewhere deep.
I push my fingers in as deep as Dean can comfortably take them, and then twist and curl them as they brush up against his prostate. It is rewarding: his cock throbs and hardens, bouncing against my stomach, and he throws his head back, moaning. "
"Fine," he says, coming close enough to snatch it back from my hand. "Fine,
Dean Winchester: a man who does not know how to be wanted just because of who he is. He needs to hear it. He needs to know.
The only way I know that I didn't dream the whole thing was that his tie was there, on the floor, halfway under the bed.
"Stay with me."
His body bucks against me. An unfamiliar hot wetness fills my insides, and I just keep thinking about blue oceans of holy fire.
"Well?" he prompts, trying unsuccessfully not to sound pathetic.
Dean shudders involuntarily. Cas' stubble is rough against his cheek, and he turns his head away to avoid the sensation, because it's

but there was still more than one time when I hooked up with a girl who was into putting something up Column A while doing other stuff to Column D.
So Dean Winchester is saved, but Castiel is lost.
The skin of his dick is soft, but beneath the surface he's rock-hard. Its swollen head glistens in the faint glow of the lamplight. I curl my fingers around him and slide them down, right down to the base, alternating between a tighter and a looser grip  as I move steadily up and down...
"Those things you were praying for earlier."
"It's okay, Dean," he murmurs. "It's okay."
He bites his lip to suppress a wave of expletives as he slides through the tight ring of smooth muscle. Cas' nails bite into his skin: the angel sighs and folds around him; thighs clasping at his waist; back arching as he draws him in deeper. Time and reality seem to fold as well--or rather, Dean loses all sense of both. He loses all sense of anything that's not the way Cas' body clenches around his cock.
I still can't quite say it. Not to him. But there's always show-not-tell. I take his hand and place it over my crotch. "...You know."
Then, he starts in earnest; soft undulations of the hips at first, but building steadily in force until I'm reaching for the bedhead with both hands in a whiteknuckled grip, the frame shaking under our combined weight and the rhythm of Cas' thrusts. There are no lyrics to this song. The creak and shudder of iron and timber and bedsprings are the instrumental; the wet slip and slide of skin on skin is the percussion; our grunts and moans the melody. The only actual words that make it through to the surface are "Cas" (me), "Dean" (him), and "please", "yes" and "
"I'm glad you're here, Cas," he mumbles.
I clear my throat. I've got things to say, before my head interferes and rounds up all the emotions that are leaking out of the dark corners where I've been keeping them.
I stalk back over to my bedside table and toss Sam the keys. I can't think of anything to say, so I just...don't say anything.
I leave one hand on his hip, and use the other to guide his cock to my mouth. Nothing much, to start: just gently wrapping my lips around the head, and then using my tongue to cup the underside of it, savouring the faint salty flavour.
So something had to be done, and I've taken matters into my own hands.
The fifth time Castiel dies is the worst. There is no comparison.
He can't say it. Not in the same words as I did. What he does say is: "Dammit, Cas, you have to
"I'm sorry to make you uncomfortable, Dean," Cas ventures gently. "I know it was selfish of me to come here like this. But you wouldn't answer my texts or my calls, and I was concerned."
He just smirks at me, pushing his palm down on my boner through my jeans and immediately making me a liar, because there's something about the slow friction of the way he rubs me that is
starts to give in; to move faster; to let his breathing become little more than choked, desperate gasps as he rolls his hips against Cas' ass, balls slapping against his skin; to pull and rub and twist his cock in a way that has Cas wide-eyed and shaking, but never looking away, until they do come together, collapsing into each other in a quaking, messy heap of limbs, their torsos sandwiching a slick of Dean's sweat and Cas' cum.
He's compliant: he stops, looking down on me nervously, a frown furrowing his brow. "What is it, Dean? Did I do something wrong?"
"I am flattered, Dean. I do not know if I am worthy of such devotion. But I am selfish, so I accept it, with gratitude."
"That sounds like a great idea, Sam," says Cas, who, from the sound of it, is still sitting on my bed.
. Singular. I'm not into dudes. I absolutely do not have sex with men. Ever. I'm not...I don't...and he's not a dude, anyway: he's an angel. I mean, he's got
"I have not been smoking anything."
He taught me--Well, I mean, he taught me a lot of things. But I'm thinking of how he taught me about a different way of being, and about a different kind of strength--a kind I'd never seen till I met him. And I don't mean his turbo-powered angel schtick. That's not what makes him who he is.
Touch his parted lips with my thumb, momentarily forgetting about the cum on my hand. Not that it matters.
As always, up close, Cas smells sharp and hot. Dean gets a whiff of peppermint, the soft aroma of soap, and, beneath those, that inhumanly intense scent, the one that’s like a biblical spice, a gift of the Three Wise Men: something ancient and beautiful and exotic.
He knows--he reaches for my thigh, his fingers drawing slow, deliberate circles on my hip, and trailing lazily over my ass cheek.
After a moment, the bedsprings creak as Cas joins me on the bed. He lies behind me; chest against my upper back, arm along the side of my torso, and hand on my hip. It's like the way I fell asleep against him the other night. I don't know why, but I feel like there's something kind of
I pass one back towards Cas, too, though I refuse to look at him.
Pathetically, hornily human.
I smile at him, wriggling down the mattress a little and using my free hand to tug a pillow down with me, to support my head and neck.
Yeah, I know I’m being immature, and a coward. I know that avoidance is not going to work as a long-term strategy. And I know that going straight from the library to Sam's room to steal the stupid book that kicked all this off is even stupider than Sam's stupid stupidness, but I do it anyway.
Why am I like this? Why do I say that, when what I mean is 'I'm glad you came', but also 'having you here scares the ever-loving crap out of me', and 'tell me you love me again', but also 'I don't deserve you'?
Cas. Once, sex was just harmless fun. Now...
"Dean." I am mesmerised by the way our hands fit together so neatly. "The last time I sought comfort in a human, it did not end well. And I think that a part of that might...might have been because I was...insincere."
. God.
He smiles into my neck. “We didn’t always.”
Dean cherishes this moment. There is something about it: about the way they're pressed close together, lips parted, staring into each others' eyes as they breathe unevenly through the terrifying intimacy and vulnerability of being together.
He groans, the tendons in his neck standing out as he thrusts into my hand. I think he's close. He's starting to moan my name, with a rising undertone of urgency and desperation.
I nod. "I remember."
him do this. He kisses his way along Cas' jawline; back down his neck; along his collarbone. Cas has his hands on the back of Dean's head, and guides him gently to his chest, which Dean bites; his nipples, which Dean sucks on and scrapes his teeth over, all the while pushing in and pulling out. The couch legs scuff loudly with each slow, forceful movement, and Cas' voice is beginning to develop that strained edge to it, cracking on the single repeated syllable of Dean's name. He can hear himself grunting and panting, too; louder than he'd like to be, but he can't seem to turn down the volume. His muscles are constricting; his glutes and core aching with his efforts, and with his grim determination to hold back his climax as long as he can. He wants desperately to speed up and to spill over and fill Cas' insides, but he holds back until he can feel the gooseflesh on Cas' skin and the waves of internal pleasure rippling through his body.
Cas smirks against his lips at his eagerness, and Dean opens his eyes to attempt to glare into the ocean of blue. He just ends up staring, though, of course, because Cas’ eyes are ablaze with the holy fire of his grace, and the unholy fire of his lust. The latter makes Dean go genuinely weak at the knees, sinking back against the wall, his cock twitching between them, brushing his forearm as he keeps working on Cas, fingers and palm rubbing, pulling--gently, gently--trying to get him over the edge; to make him snap.
I hum my approval as I think back on it again. "I enjoyed that too."
He swallows, and I realise for the first time that he might be just as nervous as I am. "Yes. I said wanted to kiss you."
Dean returns the favour, but is more thorough--he briefly and gently pushes Cas' hand away so that he can strip him of pants and underwear in one fell swoop.
He lies by my side, snaking his arm back underneath me and tucking his face back under my chin.
Still keeping my hands to myself, I add, "And, with your permission, I would like very much to kiss you again."
because we 'matter too much' to you, and then just...Jesus, Cas. You matter to me, too, okay? A lot. I--"
The lube ends up all kinds of weird places, but he finds it wrapped in the duvet at the foot of the bed and forces himself to go back to the couch
The pressure of my fingertips is weakening him. He is a hard man, both literally and figuratively. He accepts the obvious pleasures of the flesh, but he does not give himself the time to experience more subtle things, like letting someone else's touch ease away the tension he carries in parts of his body not directly involved with sexual release. But I feel the way his muscles shift under my hands. His body craves care, and I would like very much to provide it. I wonder, should I tell him so, after we have addressed the...what is the expression?...the elephant in the room? I don't know. He might allow me to care for him; he might not.
"You make me feel so...human, Dean," he murmurs. I can feel the heat of a blush where my forehead touches his cheek.
having
is. This was in the book. He is 'deflecting'.
The result is two equally stunned Winchesters, and Dean, master of subtlety, yanking his hand back so violently he almost falls off the bed.
"Get on your knees, Dean."
He's still looking at me, desperately, searchingly. "Come

"Yeah, Cas, sure I'm tired. But I'm also..."

I feel the anger that brought me out here in the first place rekindling in my chest.
He says it like an order, but it's really more like a plea.
Cas silences his plea with a kiss.
like.
But his pathetic human body is too small to contain the depth and breadth of his grief. It spills over slowly at first, the hot tears burning his cheeks as he raises his hands to his face. After that, his lungs, desperate to breathe, force him to let out the breath he's clinging to. It's the breath that holds the last vestiges of Cas left on the planet. It's squeezed out of his lungs like the last bit of toothpaste from a squashed-up, used-up toothpaste tube. Comes out like a physical object, choking him until it breaks from his lips in a twisted, animal whine.
I'm too proud to beg, but I'm not strong enough to hold back the whine.
All I know is that at first, having his finger up there was a little uncomfortable. Not too much--just a little awkward. Then, after a while, it felt pretty good. When he tried two fingers, it felt like...like...I don't know what like. Not normal Fun Times--I didn't blow my load or anything. I just...kind of...melted. It was just…the kind of awesome that makes your scalp tingle. A Magic Fingers motel bed on steroids.
," I admit. "I only know why."
not enough--and it makes me moan involuntarily. Then, without bothering to unbutton my pants or anything, he slides his hand
"Stay with me," he murmurs.
"That I love you. Yes."
Jesus Christ, he's been in the room for two minutes, and I'm already--
"Did something happen?" he asks, when I eventually let him have his lips back, "Was it a dream?"
"You're right, Dean," he says, "You're the expert on..." He drops his gaze to look down my body. "...on Dean. And if you'll permit it, I'll be a willing student."
He sighs, and puts down the gun with overstated exasperation. “Cas. Whatever it is, just say it, man.”
I can feel my cheeks burning. Even in the dark, I'm embarrassed to look at him. But I do it anyway--I force myself to look.
I don't know what I was expecting. I guess at the end of the day, he's a celestial being, sure, but he's a celestial being inside a regular guy's body. And I'm a regular guy, too, and I know what
He wants to feel safe, and I have learned that for Dean, safety often simply means clear directions. My stomach and abdomen are tight with excitement, excitement which pools as a heavy weight in my balls, but I rein in my enthusiasm enough to speak sternly and firmly.
Dean has closed his eyes. He leans back slightly, rocks gently against me, and that involuntary rumble emerges from my throat again.
Cas does shut up, and reaches up to unhook the belt buckle.
Maybe it's the whisky. Liquid courage. But it's also just...the way he lets me rest against him. The way he's
"Then what the hell, Cas?"

with him.
I do not expect him to answer. His breath is slowing, and I think he has fallen asleep, but a few minutes later, muffled against the pillow, I hear him say, "Love you too."
Cas leans forward. "I noticed," he murmurs conspiratorially into Dean's ear, "that there are hooks on the wall."
I also began to understand that when Dean suggested 'watching a movie', it wasn't actually about
"Only
I move my hand over Cas' cock, trying to copy the way he was touching me, earlier--the way he rounded his palm and rubbed against me to create that toe-curling tension.
"That's not--Dean, I--"
He reaches out to me now in the solace of our bed. The light from the crack under the door is faint, but it's enough to gild the angles of his face.
"You sent a two-word text, Dean. Over a week ago. And then all of your phones went dead."
air, Dean," he murmurs, matter-of-factly. "I'm an angel, remember?"
"I can't wait," he whispers against my mouth. There's an undertone of embarrassment in his voice. "Please, Dean...you feel so good."
Cas does not 'move up'. Instead, he smiles a little, raises a suggestive eyebrow, and lets his knees fall outwards, leaving his legs invitingly open.
"You won't leave me?"
As Dean closes his eyes against the onslaught of smells and physical sensations, Cas leans in towards him, so close that their eyelashes tangle. Fingers slide up his neck; a strong hand grips his jaw, pulling his face forward. His heart is hammering, stomach twisting with anticipation, but Cas does not allow their parted lips to meet. Not yet. He never gives Dean what he wants too quickly. He's immortal: he knows how to be patient in a way no human can. And it makes for

They glance at and then away from me in perfect sync.
I want to know. I want to know how he feels--what he's thinking. I want to understand him. But I know that these questions are not for now. I have more pressing matters to attend to.
"There is no need for that, Dean. I am fine."
Caught out, Cas stares back at him sheepishly, his neck flushing a little. He’s got that earnest look in his eyes, and it makes Dean's stomach do something weird. It goes all floaty.
obliges, his parted lips covering Dean's; teasing him with light, slow invitations to kiss back before pressing closer, pushing him flush against the wall. After that, it's just a dizzying blur of the heat of his mouth and the taste of his tongue. The hand that was gripping his jaw moves down to take a very firm hold of his ass, and he whimpers.
He has become flustered by the question. "You don't have to
But I don't care about them like I care about Cas.
It works. Making a visible effort to control his movements, Cas strips Dean of the rest of his clothes, then his own, kicking them into an inelegant heap on the floor. He slicks his fingers, the fire in his eyes now entirely unholy. Takes a hold of Dean's cock with the cool, wet fingers of one hand; slides a dripping fingertip of the other between his ass-cheeks and into his asshole. Dean's muscles only offer token resistance. With his wrists tied, his cock in Cas' hand, and his soul getting sucked deep into those blue, blue eyes, same as how his body is sucking Cas' fingers in--first one, now two...he feels like he doesn't know how to resist; like he never did. He trusts Cas. He wants him. He really does need him.
He snaps the seal, uncaps it, and lets the lube ooze, thick and glistening, into his palm. Sets the tube aside and reaches for me, his skin warm under the cool liquid. He tightens his grip into a loose fist, and lets his hand rise and fall around me, the heavy silence filled by the inelegant but erotic sound of the viscous gel as it is trapped between our skin.
comprehend is that his jeans are starting to get uncomfortable, and that he doesn't want Cas to be wearing clothes anymore, not even if it's one of Dean's t-shirts, and--actually, he's not even sure whose jeans those are. Doesn't give a shit--just wants them gone. He wants skin. He wants to be chest-to-chest. Heart to racing heart. He wants to press against Cas, feel hard nipples and pliant muscle press back against him. He wants to drink the grace right out of him. To sink inside him. To feel him tighten around his cock as he writhes beneath him. He wants to move inside him, deeply and gently, rocking their hips together. He wants to bite Cas' throat; to close his teeth lightly on tender skin. He wants to fuck him till they're both on the cusp of ecstasy, then wrap his fingers around Cas' cock and jerk him off while he comes inside him. He
But Dean's response surprises all of us; maybe even Dean. Without saying a word, he slams the laptop shut, gets up so fast he nearly knocks me over with his chair, tucks the computer under his arm and storms out of the room, leaving me and Cas in stunned silence.

with urgency and desperation, and I encourage him to be selfish. Sometimes he insists, almost angrily, on reciprocity.
"Cas, I've...You're my only friend. But it's not just that. Look, I still don't know the answer to that thing you asked about. I don't
He laughs, a little puff of air against my neck, and I tighten my arms around him. It is a possessive impulse that I entirely fail to suppress. I half expect him to pull away, but he allows it, his body sinking against mine; pressing close. Most of him melts into my embrace--except, of course, for the part of him that still nudges at me, making wordless demands for attention.
He blinks lazily as he processes the question, his face flushed and his hand still stroking my thigh.
Sex wasn't like this for Dean
"Shh, Dean. Go back to sleep," I say, as I place his hand gently back on his own lap, but he is stirring now. He makes another incoherent grumbly sound, but it definitely is not a sound of agreement. With a muffled yawn, he's looking up at me, questioningly, his gaze slightly unfocused. His vulnerability in this moment makes my heart ache.
I react too slow. Even though I pull my hand free as fast as I can, the door's already open; Sam's staring at us, wide-eyed.

As the “…” hangs heavy in the air between them, a specific kind of heat unfurls soft tendrils in his stomach, reaching out to different parts of his body. He feels his heartbeat accelerating as one tendril wraps around his heart, squeezing a little; a couple more uncurling in his loins, reaching out to his cock and balls and stroking.
He shakes his head, but the smile doesn't leave his lips, and I'm painfully aware of how

We don't talk about it for a month.
"I heard you talking to him, Cas. I heard him asking, and I heard you go into his room, and look, I'm not...I'm not judging, okay? I know I might not seem like the kind of guy who gets it, but...I do. I get it."
"Yes. I love you."
"I...I don't...I don't know
He glares at me, but it's just embarrassment--there's no real aggression in his eyes.

He whines in protest, and I silence him with my mouth--an unspoken promise, followed by the spoken confession: "Dean, I
Dean, on the other hand, has decades of Reasons for being an idiot. Not excuses.
"Stop it. I'm doing this," he says, and then, when a second attempt fails, "You're making this difficult. Lie down, will you?"
Cas groans and tilts his head forward to fix Dean with a steady, heavy-lidded gaze. "Enough. I want
"You said...you said outside that there was...something you wanted to do."
The sun is starting to drop behind the mountains now, and it's cool and dark in here. I go over to put the whisky glasses on the coffee table, then squeeze past Cas to get to the fireplace.
Any resistance I have left evaporates at that point. I know exactly which thing he's referring to, and the thought has my cock straining against my jeans.
“Good,” he says. “Good. Because I do. I really do. I love you.”
, even though he wants to run.

I raise my voice as shock takes its ice-cold grip on my skull. "Jesus, Sam, wait till I
"Not...God," Cas manages, between kisses. "Castiel."
I do not pursue him as he retreats from me. I mirror his gesture, instead: holding up my own hands in an effort to appear calm and reassuring. It works on large, frightened animals, so with any luck, it may also work on this large, frightened human.
So goddamn ready that it
“I just did,” I repeat. “I do.”
Cas narrows his eyes at me. "Actually," he says, "I did."
"I swear."
For now, there is a bath to be run, and a bed to be shared.
"Enough, I think," I murmur. I am pulsing in his hand, and I do not want this to be over before it even starts. "Come here, Dean."
Dean might only be human, but his love and his loyalty are also absolute.
The old pot-bellied stove is something I found in a junkyard in the nearest town. It's old: the kind of thing rich people would probably spend a bucketload on if someone took the time to put in a little bit of elbow grease and slapped on a several-hundred dollar price tag. Not that hard to fix up, either, but I guess most people don't bother.
But on the other hand, there's the things I feel. And these feelings, they're new, but I want to feel them. I want to be brave. I want to let Cas know that all this waiting he's done for me, and the waiting that he keeps on doing, for my sake--that it's worth it. I want him to know that it means something to me. That I appreciate it. That I appreciate

do it."
He holds up his prize and uncaps it, sluicing a cold, sloppy mess into his hand. Warms it on his fingertips as he resumes his position on the couch, then slides two of his fingers along the dip between Cas' ass-cheeks, revelling in the way this simple caress alone has Cas pulling his knees up to his chest, flattening his back and tilting his hips to give Dean better access--and a damn good view. It's a little awkward, but Dean scrunches himself up in the free space on the couch so that he can lower his mouth to kiss the twitching tip of Cas' cock, let his lips brush down the shaft, and suck his firm, hot balls into his mouth while he pushes his fingers into his hole.
. So badly. So much. He twists his hands a little to loop the strap he hangs from in his hands, and uses that, plus the support of the wall, to angle himself downwards, riding the full thick length of Cas' cock.
Cas is getting much better at reading Dean's facial expressions. It only takes about three seconds of the Look before he realises there's about to be Trouble, and he quickly concedes.
"I love you," he'd said, and then, "Goodbye, Dean."
Kissing Cas is kind of like kissing the ocean. There's a tide; an ebb and flow; a give and take. But ultimately, Dean is surrounded. Enveloped. Sucked into something far greater than himself, and far, far beyond his comprehension.
just kept on washing over me, like waves on a beach.
, but there's another, deeper part of me that aches to hear it again.
, Cas? Why are you smiling?"
Dean buries his face in the crook of Cas' neck as he tries to recover his senses. It's a hell of a mess they've just made between them, but try as he might, he can't bring himself to be disgusted.
people who have barked orders at him. His father, for instance.
"Tell me, Dean: what would you have me do?"
But Cas smiles and shakes his head, squeezing his ass cheek before releasing it, and releasing the front of Dean's shirt to lay both hands firmly on his chest. "I had other ideas."
I may not have known what to expect, but even so, this question takes me off-guard. And, embarrassingly, I do not know the answer. My love for Dean has been gradual. It has unfurled softly since I met him, and learned that he is both brave and fearful; as clever as he is foolish; that he is as kind and gentle as he is rough and ready. That he cares deeply for the world and the people in it. That he is loyal to a fault. And that he has the conviction to do what he believes is right, even when facing impossible odds.
I keep easing my way down until my hamstrings rest against his tensed thighs. I can feel his balls, hot and cushiony under my ass cheeks. I close my eyes, a little laugh escaping my lips at the thought that I've got a warrior of heaven
If it was anyone else turning him on, he would have been able to crack a joke and kill the mood, but it’s been a long time since anyone else has been able to turn him on--like,
Gone. I'm gone.
Not really a swoop. More like awkward tussling. But Cas does his best, both to cooperate and to compensate for Dean's clumsiness, and they achieve the desired result. Shirts are pulled off roughly and flung onto the floor, and Dean leans over Cas, letting those big warm hands pull down his jeans and underwear; feeling the cool air on the skin of his dick, where 95% of his attention is currently concentrated; feeling the unyielding denim waistband of his jeans dig into his hamstrings as he sits back to survey Cas' naked form in all its glory.
"I don't know. I haven't tried."
"Cas, listen." I undo my belt buckle, then his. "Listen, I want to try...I..."
you haven't seen that, Cas. We are going to watch it. We are going to watch it
On impulse, I reach for his hand.
He draws back, and his hands both drift to the hem of my tshirt. He slides his fingers under the fabric, watching me closely.

He gives me a long, pained look before he replies. "You already do too much for me, Cas," he mutters. "I can't just
Humans have the concept of 'the five stages of grief'. It is usually used when they talk about death, especially the loss of their own life, or that of a loved one. But it works as a general description of how they respond to something they fear, as well. Supposedly, in order of occurrence, the stages are: anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. From Dean, I had expected anger or denial. Instead, his reaction seems much closer to depression.
"I just wasn't expecting it," he adds. "That's all. I--you're my best friend. We already
Every instinct I have wants me to apologise; to say that it was nothing. But I'm not sorry, and it isn't nothing. And now that I understand why he left the bunker so suddenly, I am not going to allow him to misunderstand again. He needs to know.
I help myself to coffee before going over to stand behind Dean, so I can a) see what he's doing, and b) keep an eye on Cas, who is now silently swilling his coffee and gazing into it like it holds the secrets of the universe.

But after sitting here with my arms crossed for five minutes, I retrieve the book and try to uncrumple the pages. I've gone to the effort to steal it, so I might as well look at it. And according to the cover, it's a
His breath catches in his throat as I caress him, and I take a slightly firmer grip, letting the soft folds of cloth create additional friction, catching lightly on itself when it becomes trapped between our skin.
He arches his back while Cas pulls out and gently lets him down. The angel ducks lightly out of Dean’s embrace to free his wrists from the belts, and, while Dean gingerly stretches out his shoulders, studies their spattered torsos with interest.
Then, just as suddenly, I feel another shiver in the fabric of reality as Cas returns.
It goes in easy. Dean is so mellow that he just melts around him, clenching and pulling and drawing him up. And Cas reads him: knows when to push, and when to stop. The ebb and flow between them is perfect. Synergetic.
about the way he puts himself around me. And I kind of like it.
"No, thank you."
. Toxic masculinity, fear of rejection, fear of abandonment...the list goes on. With Dean, I'm not sure whether him being blind to how Cas feels is on purpose or unconscious. But either way, it's painful to watch. And it's been
"...It," he says, and then, "You know, uh, the...friendship thing."
By the time he pulls away, I'm shaking for an entirely different reason than before. So is he. His slacks are more, uh, revealing than my jeans, and I don't--I'm not--I can't think right. I'm in pretty much the same condition as him. Maybe worse. He takes one of my hands, and guides the back of my fingers over his scruffy cheek before pressing his lips to my knuckles, his blue eyes shifting back up to lock with mine as my thumb rests against his lower lip.
Tonight, the others are out. It is just Dean and I, and whatever this preposterous movie is called--I'm not sure. I haven't been paying attention. I am preoccupied by the way that Dean's hair feels against my cheek, and conscious of the fact that I must hold my position carefully so that his head does not fall forward.
"Good morning, Dean."
Naturally, this is the moment that there is a knock on the door, and, without waiting for a response, Sam flings the door open.
"It was in your car, Dean," Cas adds, and his tone is weird. I can't tell what he's getting at--what does he mean? He sounds kind of judgy, but also...amused? Accusing?
, and if he doesn't cooperate I might end up begging.
Maybe I shouldn't have tried to help him by getting him to talk about it yesterday. Maybe, after so long keeping it to himself, sharing it with someone else was too much. Maybe it made it too real or something.
I've still got my arms spread over the back of the sofa, but I shift them now, to take his face in my hands again and press a chaste kiss to his mouth.
How many years can you spend pining for someone but not doing anything about it, the whole time failing to realise
"Oh." Then, "Wait--does that mean
suddenly feels so empty.  It's silent, but for the soft, hiccupping sound of his sobs as he starts to cry, the tears now coming in a torrent, falling thick and fast through his hands and onto his sleeves, his shirtfront, the floor--pitter-pattering, soft like rain.
"No," he agrees, "there's no rush," and, slowly,
His hot tongue cups me, sliding down towards my balls, and I close my eyes, trying to let go of the shame. If I wasn't worth saving, then I have to make myself worth it.
I sit beside him, my hands in my lap.
"I love you freely," I say, quietly. "I love you, and there are no conditions on that love. And I do not expect anything from you, either. If you--"
The prospect of sex with Cas has him pathetically eager, like he's back to being a teenager. Every single time.
I want him. I want him bad. And I want him now.
He's on the floor, and he can't seem to move. Everything feels heavy, like gravitational pull has multiplied a hundredfold. Distantly, he hears his phone vibrate. Sam. Sam is trying to call him, but Dean doesn't answer. He doesn't...doesn't
stupid idiot, confessed that he was
, man. I...I
I went back to the bunker, anyway, after that. But I haven't talked to Sam about running off yet, either. I've just kind of...been acting like it never happened. And Sam's tried to get me to open up about why I split so suddenly, but I can't do it. I can't explain. Again--what would I say?
that, no one can--
"Good talk," I mutter to the uncaring lake.
I am glad that the light is behind me, so he cannot see my smile--it would annoy him if he learned that I find his nervousness endearing.
"I mean...sure, if you want some alone-time. Does this mean you've got some girl tucked away in Iowa we don't know about?"
"Don't you dare," he interrupts, his voice tight and angry as his eyes snap back to mine. "Don't you dare keep just...just
The first time, the time Cas exploded at the snap of Lucifer's fingers, he came back so fast that it all might as well never have happened. Sure, he came back different--all juiced up, as a seraph (so suck on that, Lucy)--but he wasn't gone for long enough for Dean to really feel the loss.
The first and second days I'm gone, between Cas and Sam I end up with seventeen missed calls and about forty-six unread texts. I don’t bother checking what they said. I just flick back two words to each of them--
Never mind. It's stupid.
Eventually, Cas seems satisfied that he understands what I'm not saying.
"Take your coat off and sit down, will you?" I meant to say it nicely, you know, but it comes out a little harsh. Still, Cas doesn't seem to take it personally: he simply does as I ask, hanging up his coat on one of the hooks by the door, then perching awkwardly on the edge of one of the armchairs by the fireplace.
"This is why you asked me about..."
“What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
Being near him...lets me hate myself less. Makes me hate myself less. The first time we ever met, I stabbed him in the chest. I put a literal knife in his heart, and he just...forgave me. Laughed at me. Smiled at me. Spoke my name.
"Suspected what?"
you. I want you to move, now. Gently. I want you to make love to me, Dean."
He pulls his hand away from his mouth and draws himself up to full height. Perhaps the fight response is kicking in.
Then, his eyes still fixed on me, he slowly and deliberately unfurls his arm to frisbee it out into the lake.
"Yeah, well, might have been because she wasn't
. But I can't live without him. I can't.
"I don't...I..."
Ever since we started sleeping together, I think a lot about being close to him. About how it feels to touch each other. His teeth on my skin. The sense of barely-restrained power bubbling just below the surface of his self-control. Remembering what it felt like whenever we most recently had sex. Wondering what we'll do the next time. About whether it'll be his hands, or his mouth. And sometimes, unintentionally and accidentally, starting to imagine what it would feel like to have him inside me. Like,
This time, he stands right at the edge of the pier, side-on from me, looking into the water. His profile is gilded by the late afternoon sun, and I don't know if I want to cry or kill myself at the thought of losing him. Of him loving someone else.
"Since...since when?"
"Smooth? If you prefer me tousled, you're welcome to--"
The angel who almost lost his faith, only to place it into Dean’s dubious safekeeping. Imagine that--you’re thousands of years old, and everything you thought you knew falls apart in front of you, and instead of just giving up your ruined faith, you go right ahead and place it, damaged and fragile as it is, in the clumsy hands of this one guy from Kansas who goes around killing things, and not even for money. A guy who didn’t finish school; a guy who had, as heterosexually as possible, slutted his way around America for decades; a guy who drinks too much, and eats too much, and talks too much, and has trouble using the internet. In spite of all that, in spite of the never-ending list of Dean’s faults and failings and dumb decisions, Cas
I nod slowly, and he rises from his armchair to kneel before me, gently taking my whisky glass from my hand.
Yep, that's right:
A careful hand covers mine, the other hand drawing my eyes back up to his face. We share a long silence while he gazes at me, searchingly. It actually goes on for over three minutes. I know, because I start counting the seconds, because I'm trying to keep my heart down in my chest, where it's supposed to be, instead of up in my throat, where it's trying to go.
I don't expect to feel the bolt of rejection, either, but I do, followed by a geyser of anger and self-loathing bubbling up through my core. I feel it in my skull and in my gut and in my fists. My first instinct is to lash out, and the only way I can stop myself is by retreating, so I back away, fists clenched as I try to contain it.
I let go of his cock, and he half-lifts, half-tips me onto my back, planting eager, scruffy kisses along my collarbone, before I'm presented with the warm, smooth expanse of his chest as he reaches over to the bedside table.
I know him. I feel what he's feeling, and I hear what he's thinking. He didn't believe he deserved to be saved, and he doesn't believe he deserves to be loved.
"Yes, Dean. You can."
Some weird instinct takes over, and I push my thumb against his lips. Just to see what happens.
I lift my legs to hook my feet behind him. I can't get close enough--never close enough to him. But I can use my legs to drag him deeper still, and it frees my hands so I can reach down between us and take hold of my cock, tipping my head back and letting him make his way down my throat to bite at my nipples as I tug myself into white-out bliss.
I hear myself groaning again at the way his skin pulls against mine, and I have to admit that he might be right, because that was
"Mmhm."
I also feel that Dean is moderately aroused. The sensation of him against my leg makes me respond in kind, almost straight away. Physicality can be...inconvenient.
“Let me love you, Dean.”
Was it always like this? Was I really that blind to it?
Sometimes I kind of wish he
with him. It's not like the other kiss, outside. This time, I am ready, and I am willing. His...his...grace, I suppose, envelops me; it settles the storm inside me. There is calm, and there is peace, and there is his soft mouth, and his rough stubble, and his warm skin.
The questions are all 'would you rather', and responding to them makes me kind of uncomfortable. It’s not that they're hard to answer or anything; it’s just that it’s hard to apply the phrase ‘someone I love’, which appears in all of them, to anyone other than Sam or…or Cas. I can’t sidestep the fact that apart from my brother, there’s no one alive more important to me than an angel with an ugly beige trenchcoat and no social skills.
I try not to sound eager, but I am remembering the way that he tasted when we made our first foray into physical entanglements, back in the cabin. I liked that. I liked being able to please him. I liked being able to make him forget, at least for a moment, those thoughts he has about being unworthy and unlovable. I liked the noises that he made when he was deep in my throat, and his human instincts overwhelmed his reservations. I liked the way it felt to have part of him become part of me.
He puts a hand on my chest, his fingertips trailing over my skin, and reaches under my leg to stabilise his cock with the other.
Since I'm in the area, I decide to reward myself with a few nights in a safehouse down by a lake I know. I stock up on beer and bacon and eggs and all the other stuff Sam would judge me for eating if he was here.
Confusion flits through Cas' eyes, replaced moments later by understanding. He hums agreement and, holding his gaze, unbuttons and unzips Dean's jeans, sliding one hand under the denim to squeeze him gently through the soft cotton of his underwear.
"Haha. Hilarious," he grumbles.
"Can't we just do it again?" he says, a plaintive note creeping into his tone. It would be almost childish, except that the topic is most definitely Adult.
is good. I've got you. And I
I shouldn't have invited him in. I should
"Stupid. This is so stupid." I rest my head in my hands, waiting for the sickening storm in my stomach to settle. "God help me."
Yep, it'll be good to be alone in the woods. I can eat and drink and sit on the pier pretending to fish. I can have my own Walden.
This balance between us is a fragile thing. It has taken many years of learning. Learning to read the lines on his face. The way a line at the corner of his lips is a warning sign of anger or disapproval, while one particular crease in his forehead is, rather than anger, a sign that he feels vulnerable, but is prepared to be comforted.
Things have calmed down since then. Dean
I take out two glasses and fill each with a generous pour of whisky.
I barely recognise my own voice. I sound smug and thirsty all at once, and a whole lot more confident than I feel.
Cas looks down at me, his brow furrowed.
puffy, and he smells like sex. He shifts a little to crick his neck and stretch the arm I've got trapped under my body, but if he was uncomfortable, he doesn't say anything.
It's not right."
He stares at me, lips curled into a knowing smile, as he pulls his arms free of his shirtsleeves and drops it into a crumpled heap on the floor. Then he stands, so that we're nose-to-nose, hardly a breath between us, to unbutton his pants and strip naked, before resuming his position on the couch, his arms spread across the back of it as he gives me a commanding look.
Still, it's insane that this was Sam's go-to to help Cas with his 'people skills'. Surely there are better options than a book on marriage counselling. I mean, Cas isn't married. Sure, maybe
"Dean," he says, "we need to talk about what happened at the lake."
It is the first time since we have been...intimate...that he has invited me to watch a movie. And we have been intimate quite a few times now. Thirty-seven, to be exact. Each time as rewarding as the first.
But Dean is emotionally constipated and self-destructive, and Cas is...Cas.
But it's not something I ever
"I didn't say that." I don't expect to hear myself interrupt him. But it's true. I didn't say that. I wouldn't. I might be a coward, but Cas is...well, it's Cas.
Cas strokes my thigh lazily until I get enough upstairs-brain function back to speak, and even then, all I can say is "How...?"
No, I mean the real strength. The faith he has.
The air is filled with the sound of their laboured breathing. It's so erotically charged in their little bubble of existence that the very air between them seems to shiver with the tension. Cas reaches down to stroke himself, his eyelashes fluttering, deliberately provocative, and Dean practically salivates at the sight. Big, well-formed hands around that big, well-formed--
I try to pull away again, and this time he lets me go--lets me catch him by the wrists, though his eyes have a glint of steel in them that stops me from pushing any further. And now that we're standing so close, I'm slowly becoming aware that his gaze is not the only thing that's hard. The other thing is me.
Dean kisses me back before he realises that he's doing it. When the reality does sink in, adrenaline emanates from him like a shockwave. He pushes me away and staggers backwards, hands outstretched, palms raised and held out towards me. It's part warning and part supplication, but it's all just...fear. Fear, when I'd expected anger. Not just 'what the hell' anger, either--more like broken-nose anger. And although I do not like the way that his eyes are suddenly filled with some heartrending combination of suffering and self-loathing, I am somewhat relieved that he is not resorting to his customary violence.
He only grunts in reply.

There's a definite dampness to his eyes as he says that. He looks at the ceiling to stop anything escaping, huffing a rueful laugh to keep his emotions at bay.
talk.
"Thank you," he mumbles into my skin.
The job in Iowa takes four days. After that's done, I read a headline about some weird shit up in Montana, so that’s where I go next. This time it's even quicker: I find it, I gank it. Easy. If only everything else was that simple.
Then, there are slick, sticky palms on his thighs, gripping his hamstrings to lift him and pin him against the wall, like he weighs nothing.
If he'd just
Dean is very aware of the physicality of this form. He casts his eyes down between us, and his face is suffused with colour again. I see the uncertainty on his face. I see that he wants to give, not just take, but I see also that he is embarrassed by my maleness. It is understandable. He has been conditioned by the world he lives in to doubt everything, including himself. And although society has many phases, the one that he has grown up in is not particularly kind to the people who are attracted to the same sex.
It's funny how they kiss each other differently. Cas usually kisses Dean softly; kisses the back of his fingers when he reaches out for him, for example; or his forehead, or the tip of his nose. His kisses are usually contained; small; chaste--tiny tokens of that incomprehensible angelic love.
have invited him in. I am
"Oh," says Cas, and Dean smiles a little, because Cas is only pretending to understand, but he wants to make Dean happy.
I make fun of him for looking like a holy tax accountant, but he's not that weedy--not really. Not when you see what's under the suit. The lines of his body are smooth and well-rounded. His chest is strong and broad, and his arms and shoulders are thick with muscle; muscle that is highlighted, because the dimness of the lamplight just deepens every shadow, and heightens the contrast created by, for instance, the swell of his biceps.
I let my thumb and fingertips take centre stage. I touch Cas like I'd touch myself if I was having some quality time alone, and he sighs, everything except his cock relaxing, melting into the mattress. His hands, resting either side of him, grip the sheets. I feel the tension building in him as he pushes his dick up into my hand, a low groan escaping his lips.
Dean does as he's told. The leather is smooth around his wrists: with artisanal precision, Cas pulls it tight, but not too tight.
just let me rest against him.
My body convulses violently, which downgrades to trembling as the fireworks recede.
. I'm still
I want to say more, but I know that I need to be careful. The last thing I want to do is remind him of the
I'm casting a line into the lake when I accidentally summon him. I don't know how. Okay, fine, that's a lie. I was looking at the lake and the sky and it made me think of his dumbass big blue eyes and I must have thought his name too hard or felt too many feelings in his direction or some shit. Whatever I did, it was enough for him to get a line on me, because all of a sudden I can feel him there at my side. I know he's there because suddenly I feel...I don't know. Safe.
"Let go, Dean," Cas whispers.
"Are you ready?" I ask.
"Found one in Indiana. Looks like angel versus demon stuff to me," he mutters at the computer screen when I stand at his shoulder. As he scrolls, I catch a glimpse of a pretty girl's graduation photo, the headline 'Blind Date!?', and the subheading 'Eyeless corpses found encircled by Satanic symbols'.
He bites his lip, and shakes his head. When he replies, he looks almost...
He realises that his left shoulder is still warm, because Cas' wet blood is gluing his clothes to his skin. His
He sighs, resting his chin on my thigh to gaze up at me, his blue eyes hazy.
It's Cas who moves. In a couple of purposeful strides, he closes the distance between us. My instincts call this movement a threat, and they're still working well enough that I scramble to my feet and start backing away, but I'm not fast enough. One of his hands grips my shoulder, right where the scar still twinges sometimes, and his other hand is on the back of my neck, and--
"You promise?"
if you do that, Cas--that thing--it's--"
I watch the confusion and alarm cross his face. "W-what?"
I repeat it to myself, and it gives me an anchor.
It didn't happen a
His hand moves up to my face, cupping my cheek; rising up to stroke my hair. There is so much gentleness in everything he does--every touch; every word he says to me.
Better be worth it.
He's silent again, absent-mindedly touching the shoulder where I emblazoned my mark of holy fire into his flesh, before he adds, "Cas...you know how I said before that you're like a brother to me?"
, but instead of pulling back, his answer is to groan, pull me closer and
about how...how it works between friends. But I--"
Right now, there's only one thing he wants--and it's something he knows he can't have.
He presses his lips to my forehead first, and then my temple, and only after that my lips. The minute he does, he's gently tightening his fingers, and the pressure's got me bucking up into his grip, groaning into his mouth. I can feel him smiling against me; feel the warmth of his low chuckle as he draws back, but not for long, because I lift my head, chasing more of the buzz I get from his lips on mine; the rough sensation of his scruffy chin against my skin. He tastes like mint, or honey, or both. I'm a mess. I'm straight-up gonna cum in my pants in less than half a minute if he keeps doing whatever he's doing, so I grab him by the wrist, muttering, "No--no no no. No."
, Cas. I don't..."
"I want
He swallows hard, and lets the lust, the hunger, rise again. Holds Cas' gaze, and raises one hand to gently grip his throat. The fluttering pulse under his fingers is another sensation that pulls him back into his body, back into
I used to think that the anatomy of the human male was pointlessly awkward and unappealing, as though God had been in a questionable frame of mind whilst he was designing it. I don't know what I think of it now. I know that it can be a source of great pleasure, and I know that it can be rebellious at inconvenient times. I also know that I am going to need to adjust my trousers soon, but I don't; not just yet. I worry that if I draw attention to my condition, Dean will become embarrassed, or find it unpleasant. No--it's better to endure it for now.
It’s the closest I’ve ever been to saying it. Maybe, in time, I’ll get closer.
Cas picks up the pace. He doesn't sweat (not, in his own words, ‘under any circumstances’), but his brow is furrowed with effort. Occasionally, he glances up at me, his eyes like bullets of blue under thick dark eyelashes; but they are mostly closed as the tension builds between us, his lips parted like he's lost in prayer.
