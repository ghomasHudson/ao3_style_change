John rolled his shoulders at her question. As if trying it on for size to see if he was able to handle even more weight on top of them.
“Married to my work ring a bell at all?” John asks, his expression neutral in the most infuriating of ways. “Sherlock, even you
Lestrade gives a soft chuckle, adjusting his coat collar. “Very true. Are you two still going to live together?”
Anderson nodded. This he understood. The messages from beyond the grave that he held within his grip. Helped him keep the guilt at bay at least for a while.
“This is hardly moving forward, Sherlock. This isn’t supposed to be happening anymore.” John sighs, and the sharp fingers of anxiety begin to crawl up his chest.
Looking over the man on his sofa, it was still hard to imagine what he was actually allowing himself to do, what he was putting his license - his very ability to practice medicine! - in jeopardy for. “This is insane,” he said aloud, shaking his head for what felt like the thousandth time as a slightly hysterical chuckle slipped from his lips. “I’m absolutely mental… I can’t… I don’t even know…” He paused and dropped his gaze to the floor, closing his eyes with a soft huff as he pulled himself together and then squared his shoulders before pulling himself up to his full height. He couldn’t let himself break, not now. Not with something so important looming over him.
“Yeah, that’s — everything.” John stands, his fists curling loosely at his sides, unsure of what to do. There was no guide for this. “I’m, uh, gonna get some air.”  He grabs his jacket from the rack, swallowing back the ache in his throat.
“It’s for you,” Harry mutters, thrusting the cup in John’s waiting hands before opening the front door all the way. “Saw you staring daggers at my flat from the front pavement. Are you still in what you wore for dinner?”
They stay in comfortable silence for a while, Irene bustling around the kitchen as she makes sandwiches, cuts them into delicate triangles, then arranges them neatly on the cupcake stand she’d found. She lays out a spread of scones and cupcakes on the other plates, accompanied by small bowls heaped with jam and clotted cream. When all the food has been laid out and a pot of tea has been boiled, she gathers it all onto a tray and carries it into the living room. The various plates and tower of sandwiches only just fit onto the small coffee table, but Irene effortlessly makes it all fit. Finally, Molly speaks again as they help themselves to the spread.
“Hey there, steady on,” John soothes, rushing over to help Sherlock up and back onto the bed. His blonde hair is sticking up in odd angles to be purposely appealing and Sherlock needs John to stop being so frustratingly attractive. Particularly when Sherlock’s on the cusp of a justifiable anxiety attack.
He was floating on a piece of driftwood throughout 221b. Only, he realised, it wasn't driftwood, but the table he'd thrown through the window. He was using the pieces of broken toaster to paddle after Sherlock, trying to catch his elusive lover, who ran before him giggling and quite naked.
Evidently, John’s ability to keep their breakup quiet for at least a few days was just as successful as keeping the start of it hushed up. At least to Greg it seems.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered shut as he hugged him back. The steady warmth and heaviness was as splendid as any shock blanket. John was here and missed him. John was hope and light, and that meant more than anything awful that they had been through, didn’t it?
John started to turn towards the fridge, but he stopped suddenly after only a single step. He turned around with a curious look on his face and stared down at Sherlock as if he were trying to dissect a bomb.
There were very few obituaries to read that night. The first entry he read was for an elderly man, who had passed away at the ripe age of ninety-seven. Whose children had written a heartwarming tribute to him and a member of NSY who had died under mysterious circumstances. Some nights were like that, simply a slow news day. But that didn’t mean John turned off his computer and went to sleep. He’d taken to social media over the past few weeks. Though he never posted or interacted with anyone, it was enjoyable to read other people’s experiences laid out in two hundred and eighty characters or less.
That same laugh that caused the odd flutterings of lightness in Sherlock’s chest. John placed his hand on top of Sherlock’s, the weight of it secure and steadfast. John kept it there for the next three minutes and nineteen seconds.
“No, it’s not.” Sherlock finally says, relaxing his shoulders and letting out a shallow sigh. The artificial light from the kitchen turns everything a cold colour that reminds John of a hospital room. The poignancy isn’t lost on John. Sherlock still doesn’t meet John’s gaze, his eyes flickering over the piles of evidence, trying to find something, anything, to avoid looking up.
The driver appeared to be swallowing down a very snarky reply as he placed the fourth box yarn into the boot of the car. Sherlock glared at the back of his head as the assistant who wheeled Sherlock down to the front entrance snickered in clear amusement.
“What the fuck is this?” John spits, turning back to the spreadsheet. He doesn’t want to see Sherlock’s face as he explains. If he does, he might punch it, and that wouldn’t help either of them.
John’s not sure where this newfound confidence came from, but he revels in the feeling, linking his fingers through Sherlock’s as they walk in the direction of Trafalgar square. The roads have all been cordoned off and the pavements are heaving. Sherlock leads the way, pulling John behind him as they weave their way through the crowds.
“John?” Sherlock asked tentatively as he approached the bed. John finally looked up, disinterest plastered all over his face.
and it had lived up to its name. The bright lights and atmosphere screamed of Pride, beautiful bodies, and Lady Gaga. Just behind Harry’s cheesy group photo with a couple of heavily tattooed older ladies, John was stood next to a slender man with dark curly hair and very familiar cheekbones.
“Do continue.” Irene says. Sherlock hones in on Irene’s voice, desperately trying to drown out the noises in his ear. He feels like a cat caught in headlights.
“Did you plan on having a plus one?” John asks once they are on the pavement again. “Mary mentioned to me asking you, since you didn’t send back your RSVP.”
No. Sherlock apparently knows nothing about this man in front of him. This mysterious beacon of light which shines a light for him to follow through the world has evidently shimmered in twinkling shades of LGBTQ+.
“Oh, no. I’m, um — I do locum work now. Y’know. As a GP. My hands—” He trailed off, holding out his non-existent tremor. Sherlock knows that’s not why John doesn’t do surgery anymore, but he bites his tongue. Who was this woman? Why was John lying to her?
Their laughter lulls, and the pair fall into a comfortable silence. Sherlock is desperate for the night to never end, for this version of John to stay with him forever. Things will change after the wedding; he knows they will. Even more so than they changed after Sherlock ‘died’, and he’s not sure he can handle that again. Although it’s not her fault, it feels as if Mary is taking parts of John away from him. Small snippets here and there, but it's enough for their dynamic to have changed. But not tonight. Tonight feels like old times.
Ted cleared his throat again before taking a larger gulp of wine. With any luck, Sherlock would be alone in the next half hour.
Sherlock’s crash to the floor stops whatever John was about to say next. His body is already recovering from the fall as his hands scramble and claw towards the last location he saw his mobile. Lestrade must think he's been kidnapped or worse for not texting in the past two days.
Then Sherlock is back at it with the sketch pad. His elegant hands flow effortlessly over the paper, and John might as well again be wallpaper. Well, bollocks to that.
"Right, so not going to touch on the fact that I broke into a fucking police station?" John nearly spat out his beer as he struggled to hold in his laughter, "At least you've got your priorities, mate. Yes, Greg Lestrade,
John could understand why people did not enjoy swallowing. But, being the practical man he was, saw no reason not to. Cleanup would be easy, and he wanted to feel every last pulse of pleasure against his tongue. An eternity passed before Sherlock was completely still, one hand lax against his shoulder where it had been gripping him with painful force. Careful not to overstimulate Sherlock, John pulled free and pressed a very sloppy kiss to the crease of Sherlock's thigh.
-  he’d request a chewable capsule of top-tier arsenic and chase it down with a bottle of cyanide. Hangovers of his years in uni were nothing compared to what becoming a vampire can do to an otherwise workable skull.
"Oh," John whispered, caught off guard by the crisp white paper in his hand. John might have a history of sleeping around, but consent was always required with any of his partners. Seeing the look of morbid curiosity on Greg's face, it had occurred to him that outsiders might not understand Sherlock's unique condition. "This is perfect, Sherlock."
He would have to collect more data. This just proved that he needed to learn everything he could, and show John that he could be a good partner. He could be what he needed.
There was a tweet about how @FuriousForensic would like to kill anyone who woke him up before ten am that made John chuckle. He was more of a morning person himself but had adapted due to the nature of his job. He replied with a gif of some Disney princess drinking from an endless vat of coffee, then went on to the obits.
Most of Sherlock's walls were cluttered with pictures or pieces of furniture. But the gap between the bathroom door and door to the hall had the least photos. Taking Sherlock's hand in his so he'd understand this wasn't rejection, simply a change in positions, John pulled Sherlock with him and pressed his back against the flat space.
“Hey,” John mumbles as Sherlock leans over and nuzzles his face into the crook of John’s neck. The beginning of stubble tickles John as he hums at the closeness. “You miss me that quick?”
“Then if you want to be together, be together,” Harry says, giving a fervent nod. “It’s plain to me that you adore him, so be with him.”
“What’s this?” John asks, battling his way past canvases and a pile of paint trays to the kettle. He fills it, and flicks it on.
“I need to catalogue what happens,” Sherlock whispered into John’s neck. John gasped as Sherlock gently brushed  the tip of his cock with his thumb. “Need to know what makes your pupils blow wide and moan out my name. Tell me, John…”
Without pause, he gently nips at the inside of my thigh, before moving back to my ballsack. He sucks and rolls the skin in his mouth, and the waves of pleasure that roll through me are so powerful that I almost don’t notice him slip a finger inside me. I gasp and thrust into him, throwing a hand down to grab at his hair.
Maybe that is why, when he enters 221b that evening, he doesn’t kick up a fuss at the mess that greets him. Sherlock is sitting at the kitchen table, piles and piles of painting supplies covering every inch of the kitchen. It looks like a bomb went off in the middle of HobbyCraft. There are canvases of every imaginable size littering the floor and worktops, and litre bottles of paint are stacked on top of each other. There’s even a collection of brushes in the sink.
Although John has only had a few quick and deliberate rendezvous with men in his past, years of medical school coupled with a school life filled with same-sex showers allows him to accurately surmise two very crucial facts.
“I assume that you threatening to cease one of my favorite bedroom activities with you is warranted?”
Mycroft taps his umbrella on the linoleum floor as John tries to get a hold of his faculties. It’s one thing to be kidnapped by the older Holmes in the middle of the city, but quite another to be ambushed at John’s workplace.
This was becoming a habit. The type of routine that Greg endured the way others at the Yard muscled their way through evening paperwork that had to be finished before they could call it a night. To finally be able to maneuver out of the offices to blend in with the other grey faces of passersby in the heart of central London. All bundled up in scarves and long coats that every so often reminded the DI that Sherlock wasn’t the only one who wore wool and cashmere as a suit of armor. Still, it was hard to imagine a planet could exist without Sherlock Holmes at its center. The man was a force of nature who seemed to, by his brilliance alone, keep the world on exactly the correct axis. All while screaming at the top of his lungs and single-handedly pushing Anderson closer and closer to a complete nervous breakdown.
“Apologies aren’t something either one of us needs. We just need The Work and to keep moving forward.”
John eyes him in that way Sherlock has seen before. When John is trying to figure out if Sherlock is being thick on purpose or if it’s genuine puzzlement. There's an oddness in seeing it from this intimate of a space, where he and John appear to be sharing the same intense yearning for disclosure.
John considers watching television before deciding against it. The noise of a football game is libel to have Sherlock throwing something at the screen, and with most of the easy to grab items within his reach being heavy art books or dozens of paint bottles — the television wouldn’t survive the onslaught.
Sherlock opened his mouth to toss out a scathing reply before pausing for a moment to consider a life without knowing Mycroft Holmes. It would be lovely, but it would make for odd family dinners with Mummy and Father.
“Oh really? Monday it was Tom, then Wednesday Geoffery, then after that you obviously decided that bears were not your type so you brought home Sam, Friday it was Bruce
“Hey, shhh.” Sherlock pulls John into him, winding his arms around his back and giving a gentle squeeze. John’s head settles in the soft spot between Sherlock’s chest and arm, and he pushes his nose in farther, inhaling the familiar scent. “You’re allowed to change John. These identities -- they serve you, not the other way round. If bisexual is the word that works for now, then that’s what we’ll use. But it’s not fixed, you can change your label at any time as you learn more about yourself. There’s no rush. I love you regardless.”
Except, did he? Harry didn’t think so, and she’d never met the man. He’s missing something, but he can’t put his finger on it.
Instead of lunging forward to kiss and hold Sherlock, John stays put. His body trembles and he grabs the back of his chair for balance, forcing himself to remain still. To get everything out on the table before he shuts down like he usually does. Like they both usually do.
“How about I choose, since you seem lost in your thoughts again,” John smirks, then points at number 13 on the tasks page. “Get someone at the bar to buy you a drink.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply. He busies himself with the kettle, pouring the water into the mugs and straining the teabags.
“Ho voglia di te.  Mi fai impazzire.” Sherlock frowned, and then looked into John’s bemused expression. “Parlando Italiano?”
A smirk appeared on John's lips as Sherlock kissed a trail down the middle of John's chest. John groaned in response and fiddled with the button of Sherlock's trousers as best he could. Sherlock shimmed his hips to assist, and soon after they were both completely naked. Sherlock rocked his hips, moaning into John’s mouth when he mimicked the motion.
This time John couldn't shield the tremor even if he had tried. Mycroft had prepared for resistance. Would have been surprised if John had accepted such help so easily. What Mycroft didn't expect was the doctor leaving the room and returning a few moments later with the one item that Mycroft had planned on taking from the flat. The short and nimble fingers on John's now steady left hand tightly wound around the neck of the Stradivarius.
It didn't bother John one bit that Mycroft didn't like him. At the end of the day, he wasn't here for Mycroft. What was bothering him was how Mycroft seemed to be hindering any development, rather than aiding thanks to his hatred.
He pulled out his mobile to send a quick Twitter post about getting take away after work when his eyes caught a reply to his latest diatribe about Philip. Usually, followers were kind and sympathetic, but @CJW197104 response was in a category of its own.
Hard and firm reminders that John’s heart was a complicated series of muscles and blood vessels. Occasional valleys opened wide with eager tongues and willing words and John dove in head and hips first. Running erections and motivations until both were satisfied.
Unfortunately, The Work needs me, and Lestrade or Mycroft would drag me back here even if I chose a life away from Baker Street. Besides, I would miss John too much.
"Yes…more than willing.." Sherlock's groaned, his right hand slipping into the front of John's trousers and undoing them with incredible dexterity considering how much he'd drunk. "My bedroom is the first door on the right. All the supplies we need are there..but first…I need to watch you..."
John chuckled from his position to Sherlock's right. He reached out with his left hand and lightly picked up Sherlock's hand from where it sat, fighting with his trouser inseam. He kept his grip light, unsure if simple hand holding were something Sherlock would even be interested in. After a moment, when Sherlock showed no signs of tearing his hand free, John closed his fingers around Sherlock's hand and brought it up to his lips. He kissed each knuckle before lowering their hands down to the space between their thighs, then looked straight ahead until they arrived home.
John stops talking at the extremely puzzled expression his sister is giving him. It takes a moment for John to realise what has happened, and he readjusts his incredulity into something softer and more understanding. Harry’s memory is perfectly serviceable in most situations, but adding alcohol turns her into Dory from
“Piss off,” John yells back, but he is smiling before he releases Sherlock. The sensation of John’s arms around him is missed almost at once.
"Mycroft sent a text about us. Evidently, the broken window helped us become a spectacle for most of the neighbourhood. It should make the block party Ms Winters hosts in July much less dull. Also, speaking of windows and broken furniture, my brother will have some men come around in about the next half hour to tidy up. Mrs Hudson shouldn't have to walk into this much mayhem. At least not until a month or so of you living here." Smirking, Sherlock pushed himself against John once more. The stickiness was still there, but he needed to kiss John's soft skin and press tender kisses along his scar.
A half a year of nights like this where Greg checked in because of a phone call, a text, or just that intuition that made him fairly good at his job. The drive to 221B either with his own car or, on nights when he was alerted after a pint or two, with the aid of a cab ride.
Another crash from behind them. Molly needed to stop pretending not to be overhearing their conversation, for the sake of all of Barts laboratory equipment.
"Now," John said in a tone that would have been better suited for scolding a toddler who had thought it smart to stick his fingers near an electrical outlet, "Will you be leaving Miss Sylvia alone? Or do I need to end this here and now?"
Sherlock's thighs began to shake, which at any other time wouldn't have been an issue. But there were stitches John did not want tearing during this adventure. He rested the elbow of his left arm on Sherlock's right thigh while placing his free hand flat on the other. With the faintest amount of pressure, he managed to get the shaking under control and was free to pour his full attention back over the erection throbbing in his mouth.
John makes a point to check the time before knocking on Harry’s front door. Not that it matters. His sister’s sleep patterns have always been sporadic for as long as John has known her. It’s as if she decided long ago that the responsibility of adulthood would have more trouble hitting a moving target.
Sherlock feels that his mind is running far too fast, yet is somehow stuck in the same gear. The scene before him is too personal. Too raw and exposed. He shouldn’t be allowed to see this, yet he can’t look away.
Of course, Sherlock Holmes would get John in a predicament that included having to explain to a uniformed officer the inner workings of his life. John had just assumed that it would happen
Sherlock snatched his hand out of John’s reach as he tried to touch him. This wasn’t about ruining anything. This was about John’s inability to be truthful.
John was not a dreamer. But that all changed in the wake of his post-orgasmic bliss brought on by Sherlock's body and his finger.
“The fact that you told me, is everything I need to know.” John places a hand on Sherlock’s cheek and gently pulls it towards him. Sherlock’s eyes are pinched with worry, and John delicately kisses his eyebrows, trying to soothe it away.
The whiplash of John’s tone has Sherlock’s mind in a whirl. He shakily sits on the foot of the bed and feels sick.
Irene’s still talking, but her voice has faded into background noise. Sherlock can’t distinguish one word from another; the only sound he can hear is the cracking of his ribs as John attempts to push the life back into him. The hairs on his neck rise and the rhythmic cracking grates against his skin.
The confession is soft and sweet and isn’t anything that John has expected. Yet there it is, as real and colourful as all of the artwork around them. John’s gaze flickers to the large piece of him hen-pecking at his keyboard at the desk. Then to the more avant-garde work of him making tea in the kitchen. The sweeping landscape piece of their beautiful view of London through the window. Even in that one, Sherlock has John’s silhouette off to the right side.
It was a stupid way to go about this; showing Sherlock’s haughtily frozen expression to a series of strangers. Their responses ranged from politely puzzled to downright put out, but John was used to placing himself into nearly unwinnable states of affairs. It was what had caused him to boldly step out of the shadows near a poolside while cradled in incendiaries. It was why John still imagined life before he took that phone call that began as a note and ended as a freefall.
Years of drug abuse, never once caring for his own life, and this is how everything ends? No. He won’t let it.
Greg gave a low whistle as he ran fingers through his hair. It was a lot to think about, and so much could go wrong.
As Sherlock approaches the bar, he gets an uneasy feeling, as if he’s missing something. The whole place feels different from the last two bars, but Sherlock can’t figure out what it is for the life of him. He scans around the room, eyes roaming over each of the patrons, but it isn’t until the bartender hands over their drinks that he realises what’s different. They’re in a gay bar.
“I understand now that I love you, but that doesn’t change anything. I don’t think I can do this again. Not if we’re doomed to fail.”
“That’s a shame, but you’re here now. All that matters. What are you drinking? I’d be happy to refill it for you with something more expensive, if you like.”
“I think you’ve answered your own question. Why kill someone, if you’re not there to witness it? Takes all the fun out.” Pierce’s voice became crooning, as if talking about a beloved pet. Oh, here was a piece of work alright. Sherlock would have fun getting into his head.
"I want you. You make me crazy." Sherlock frowned, and then looked into JOhn's bemused expression. "Am I speaking Italain?"
It’s been a good day for John Watson. All the patients he saw today had relatively minor conditions; nothing a course of antibiotics or a few weeks rest couldn’t sort out. When he stopped off at Sainsbury’s on the way home, the self-service checkout had actually worked, and the infamous chip and pin machine gave him no trouble. Overall, a good day.
John cleared his throat, “Uh, well, sorry about that…” He danced around the question until Sherlock sighed and straightened up.
made a horrible mistake was to break into my bedsit and…do what exactly? Leave rose petals on my mattress?”
They laugh some more. The time stretches out to its breaking point, and Sherlock feels the touch of John’s socked feet against the inside of his own parted legs. The feet are warm and soft and deceptively strong, much like the doctor himself.
He pulled a light blue envelope out of his inner coat pocket. John's eyes followed every movement of it as Mycroft placed it on the coffee table in front of them.
Their noses touch first — a precursor to gentle lips and the smallest of kisses. Molly’s spine tingles as slender fingers slide up the small of her back, and she opens her lips just enough to invite a little bit more. Irene hums into a deeper kiss as her tongue delicately explores Molly’s mouth, and Molly can tell with another shiver that Irene is being as careful as possible with her. It’s a gentleness that makes Molly want to cry-laugh once more.
John bids a quick farewell to Lestrade, apologising for the outburst, before following Sherlock. He rehearses sentences in his head, racking his brain for ways to make Sherlock open up without pissing him off even more. It’s pointless, however, because as soon as he reaches the taxi, the door slams in front of him and drives off without so much as a glance backwards from the detective.
“By the look of it, you were already doing a fine job of destroying your garden yourself,” Sherlock muttered, and John shot him an exasperated look. “However, you wasted your time trying to till the ground with new soil. It’s still obvious where the body was buried.”
“Sorry. Got trapped at the surgery. Things going all right then? He figured anything useful for the case yet?”
, but if he made it through eating army rations, then Harry’s attempt at breakfast should be doable. The crunch between his teeth is a clear indication that some shells managed to survive Harry’s scrambling on the stovetop.
He searches the kitchen, hoping there’s a note somewhere, explaining where Sherlock had gone. Nothing. John grunts in frustration, rechecking his phone, hoping a message will have arrived. The inbox is still empty. He types a quick text, ‘
The word always felt right when John said it, and Sherlock began to take slower and deeper breaths. Seb looked to John for guidance because he wouldn't dare let go of Sherlock unless John gave the word that all was ok. Greg took a tentative step towards the three of them on the floor with the tablet in hand.
Thank you to everyone who looks on in this story with either mild curiosity or rapt interest. You are a large amount of the reason that I keep going. Comments and kudos are food for my fretful soul...
He was careful not to get the lube everywhere, not that John cared about the floor or table, but listening to Sherlock complain about another pair of trousers being ruined by a greasy stain didn’t sound enjoyable. He had to pull away from Sherlock’s perfect lips to look down. The sight made him groan with want and desire. Sherlock’s cock was flush, the tip red and full as it poked free from his foreskin. Pouring the contents of the packet into his hand, he wrapped his palm around both their cocks and thrust up once, watching with dark eyes as Sherlock’s cock slid beautifully against his.
John’s voice was fading in and out as a rush white noise permeated Molly’s ears. Her eyes darted from side to side as she pulled out the rehearsed phrases that she’d been warned that at some point she would have to recite back.
John smiles back, ears still pink but definitely no longer embarrassed. “Well, I haven’t any complaints, but I am ready to be the one who only makes those sounds for you...if you’re amenable?”
“What I did to you?” John repeats, which is exceedingly unhelpful, and he simultaneously wraps Sherlock’s dressing down around himself while scooting out of the bed as if leaving the scene of a crime. “How fucking dare you blame me for this, when
However, growth did occur, both in the literal and the figurative sense, and Sherlock found it a much easier task to take Mycroft’s advice. He became a man of deduction and scientific reasoning, and valued books over sentiment like a proper Holmes should.
“Uh, yeah…” John answers, taken aback by Sherlock’s request for his opinion. “It’s possible that the new killer is just right-handed instead of left like Michael Pierce? And the copycat doesn’t see it as a necessary detail?”
In the next few months, he kept his brain and hands busy. The clinic got the lion’s share of his focus to the rejoice of Sarah and all of the other exhausted staff. Occasionally John found himself smiling again in spite of himself. That nagging doubt of something being not quite right in all of this hushed up by much louder noises and that was fine. It was all fine.
John was the first to give up his weapon, though he didn't take his eyes off of Sebastian for a single second. That is until he decided the only way Sebastian would leave here alive was if John Watson was not sharing the same air as him.
“John, he’s the only thing you’ve talked about all evening. I’m not looking for anything serious, so I let it slide, but it’s obvious you’re still hung up on him. I thought maybe you wanted some fun, something to take your mind off everything, but it’s okay that you don’t.” She reaches forward and gives him one last kiss, chaste and quick. “It takes time. Don’t rush yourself.”
Another light flickers, but this time there is that same rush of Sherlock not being able to catch his breath, followed by a familiar cracking noise that Sherlock has heard before. Then the muffled sound of what sounds like his name in his ears, spoken by someone he knows. Someone he needs.
Thank you again to the wonderful SherlockWatson_Holmes for their wonderful beta work and to the fandom for allowing me to grow as a writer. As always, comments and kudos are glorious.
Sherlock moves to press delicate kisses along his jaw, behind his ear, and down his neck. Each one makes John shiver, and he feels his knees become weak. It takes everything to remind himself that he’s not finished, that there’s more he has to say. They can’t just plough forward with abandon, they need to work this out properly.
“Just a little bit - “ Sherlock moaned, right into John’s face. His hips were moving in quick little snaps as the climax moved even more to the brim of bursting, eyes opened and rolling madly. “John...I…”
“I’m sorry for not being there for you,” he begins, and Sherlock shifts his gaze back to him once more. “I’m sorry for holding you to unrealistic standards. I know you. Before all this, I met the most incredible man at St Barts, and he asked me to come live with him. And I said yes, not because I wanted the perfect boyfriend, but because I like the man I met. I stayed, every day, because you were my friend. You are perfect as you are, and I chose you. When you finally kissed me, it was everything I wanted, but somewhere along the line, I stopped seeing you for
He remembers pouring over all the books he could find, venturing to the city when the materials he wanted were absent from his local library. Mother had helped him, driving him back and forth to bookshops and libraries, but to no avail. Everything he found was either so brief it was not worth reading, or was filled with horror stories — other men who had suffered the same fate as Alan Turing. He tried asking his teachers, innocently asking them questions about the gay community, but each time he was told in no uncertain terms to keep his mouth shut. One particularly kindly teacher, Mr Trevor, had snuck a small pamphlet in his bag — an advertisement for a gay bookshop in London, halfway down Marchmont street. One weekend, he and Mother drove into the city, and he spent hours scouring the shelves, buying as many books as he was allowed.
"I'm not leaving here," John said. His voice was somewhat muffled by the clench in his teeth. "This was his home. This is still
Molly chokes back a laugh, and the shift in her emotions elicits a tiny shout from further in the flat. Greta, her calico cat, mews happily as she scampers over to rub at Molly’s leg with her furry head.
Sherlock gawked at first John, standing naked and sticky right next to him, holding a fully loaded gun in his hands and murder in his eyes, the to Seb who was bloody faced and wincing like mad from a kick to the balls that would probably have him able to sing high tenor for the better part of a month. "
“Not all of us can be like Sherlock,” Greg continues. “But I’m not an incompetent. It’s practically written all over you both.”
“Ne t'arrête pas,” Sherlock whined, his toes pointing out and flexing madly. “Aime ce que tu me fais.”
As they pass through the square, Sherlock reaches forward and grabs at John’s waist, stopping him in his tracks and spinning him round to face him. John lets himself fall, trusting his detective to catch him. His body dips towards the floor, leaning back in Sherlock’s arms as his fiance leans down once more to kiss him.
At first, Sherlock doesn’t notice the lone figure, sitting on the luxurious white sofa with her legs delicately crossed. All he sees are the two armchairs in front of him; one black, sleek and worn in from years of misuse, the other plump and red, dressed with a soft grey blanket. He knows those chairs.
"Funny enough, Sherlock first came to my office going on about how shitty the team was about solving cases. Had a huge stack of old case files he got his hands on, and all of them solved. Now that I think of it, Mycroft was probably how he got a hold of 'em, but anyway…Sherlock was fresh out of rehab and demanded I let him look at fresher cases. Said he could probably solve them too. I laughed in his face. Stupid reaction in hindsight, but he was persistent and incredibly smart. Ended up going through the proper channels and, within a few years, was in the forensics department. Shocking in some ways but, the man's insane but an absolute genius."
Sherlock obviously gave little emotional weight to sex. Could this solve the problem of their fighting, if they were able to blow off steam without the expectations of an actual relationship? John can’t help but think of all the red flags, all the reasons it could go wrong, but, he realises, he actually wants it. He’s tired of holding back. If they could define times to give themselves over to each other, then the moments in between could be easier. They would need ground rules, of course, but it could work.
“Four hundred and forty-three point seven milliletres.” Sherlock says, pulling two graduated cylinders out of his bag and placing them on the counter.
12:30am: Harry was dancing with a cute blonde while John chatted up a stunning brunette. Her lips were painted in a brilliant shade of red and she suggested shots of —
to anyone else, but it’s more than that. Love can’t be placed in a cage in the dark and expect to survive, no matter how much attention you give it. I was wrong for not treating our relationship with the respect it deserved, and too late in my placations of showing it later. The restaurant...the small asides to you to keep our status quiet...they were wrong and painful, and I am so sorry for doing all of that to you, Sherlock.”
“My God, are you’re ridiculous,” John whispers. He leans down so they are too close to not make this into something much more explicit.
Mr. Haversham must be there to finally fix the loose dresser handle that John had been begging him to do since he first arrived. So much for him sleeping the rest of the day undisturbed.
Sherlock’s pulse rate was elevating and he knew that John would notice it soon. It was both the blessing and a curse of being sexually involved with a doctor. The intoxicating words were inching their way through Sherlock’s pores like slow-acting alcohol, and the buzz of it was all the things Sherlock never knew he needed until this moment.
“I’ll be as gentle as I can,” John soothed. He was fairly certain that Sherlock couldn’t hear him, but enough years as a doctor told him that it was always better to talk to patients as you touched them. It was especially important now, knowing how much this omega had been through already. The white button-down he wore was ruined, stained with blood from what looked like everyone involved in the assault. Visible bruising from a chokehold on his graceful neck and defensive wounds on the palms of both elegant hands filled in the pieces of the story that John had been too late to witness. The tailored slacks were ripped in enough places for John to examine most of the minor scrapes, while keeping most of Sherlock's modesty intact for now. The right knee cap was definitely injured, but in a rush of relief, it was confirmed to only be a particularly nasty sprain. It would hurt like hell for the next few days, but was completely recoverable.
Sherlock opens the door with the key and steps inside. The cottage is small, but very well cared for. The furniture is heavy wood carved pieces and the dark maroon velvet curtains appear to be handmade. Sherlock’s eyes flick over to a large painting of a garden on the large section of wall in the sitting room area.
“Two, er, beers, please.” Sherlock's eyes scan over the rows of beer taps, unsure which one he should choose. This really isn’t his area. What if the different brands react differently? Then Molly’s calculations could be inaccurate.
He left Irene with a heavy heart and a racing brain. Sherlock still wasn’t sure what he wanted, neither did he understand what he was feeling, but Irene was right. He had to figure it out. At least now he had a better idea of how to do that, and the impending sense of doom he’d been carrying with him over the past few months had lessened slightly.
“Welsh clay tiles, they’re not usually found in this area. Some of the older houses in London used the tiles on their roofs during the 1800s, but most have now been replaced with better materials. When the tiles came off the roof, they broke and left a residue in the soil. There are about five houses in the local area that used this type of tile, so we need to go through them to find where the body was buried. And look, guess who lives in one of them,”
“Now then,” John goes on, now looking somewhat more pink-cheeked as before. “I’d like to ask a favor…”
Sherlock glanced at his phone, hating how early it actually was. Lestrade’s voice felt like gravel in the back of his skull, but at least Anderson wasn’t on this assignment.
“When he arrived here he wasn’t much in the mood for a conversation,” Irene admits. “Even before he saw me as his father before him.”
Without warning, the living room door swung open to reveal a panicked Lestrade, panting slightly from the staircase.
“Yeah, okay.” John lets the door swing shut behind him. He shudders once the night air hits him from all sides. All of the warmth is back the way he came, even with his coat, but it isn’t worth going back for anything now.
Sherlock Holmes finds himself in serious trouble as his heat is fast approaching, but John Watson comes along just in the nick of time.
The phone rings out, and Sherlock overpowers his heavy torso so that he is sitting up on the bed. How would John even deal with a phone call from beyond the grave? Is he still too preoccupied with saving Sherlock to even answer?
Sherlock gulped as he tried to regain his footing. “Yes...that’s true, but...you were at the surgery...earlier. How was your day at the surgery? That’s what I was referring to when...just talk about your day and I’ll listen attentively and…”
Instead of a response on the other end of the line, there is a click, followed by a small beam of light that radiates like a projection on the surface of the lilac wall. The image is of a hotel room very much like the one Sherlock and Irene are in now, except that the colours are warmer hues of dark cherry and striking scarlet. The bed is in the corner, and quite a bit smaller. The decorations are more rigid and military.
“The killer made an appearance,” Sherlock concluded. “And we arrived within five minutes of this photo being taken, the killer needed to be close enough to the crime scene to escape undetected.”
“You sure about that, darling?” he whispers back, and although I deplore pet names, that one can be carved on my gravestone in solid gold. “My usual lovemaking may be a bit...overwhelming for you.”
He tilted his head and nibbled John's neck as he aimed all of his energy to smack against John's prostate as much as humanly possible. His right hand pressed to the wall to keep his balance, and his left hand made its way to John's cock and began to jack him off in earnest.
"Touch me," Sherlock murmured, grabbing John's right wrist and placing it onto the globe of his left arsecheek. "Let me know how this makes you feel. I must know everything you want to do to me. Tell me
Sherlock wanted whatever John would give him, in whatever measure he was allowed. Sherlock wanted to wake up to the sight of John and his naked bodies, twisted into the shapes that came with sex and the closeness that came afterwards. Sherlock wanted every version of John’s smiles and frowns and all of the emotions in between. He wanted to grow old and eventually die with John, and suddenly their fight in the restaurant seemed not only silly, but remarkably irrelevant.
Sherlock only connected that John was kissing that same bit of pie off after being pushed into the leather cushions. John straddled his hips as Sherlock opened his lips to John’s insistent tongue, and the conversation regarding mould spores laid forgotten.
He lay in bed later that evening, his thoughts chasing themselves around his head. What Sherlock had been proposing, would it work? Could they have physical contact, still bring each other pleasure, without being partners? Other people had done it, could they?
The bed creaks with their movements. The sway in tune with their slew of kisses as Sherlock is tightly sleeved in John’s arms and legs and the very core of him. The velvety softness causes Sherlock to cry out John’s name with every push. The stretch of tension at near snapping as John’s fingernails embed hard into the sensitive flesh of Sherlock’s shoulders and back.
“Stay with me,” John murmured, throwing a glance over his shoulder to make sure the other alphas were truly gone. “Just stay with me.” His voice rasped slightly as the words tumbled past his lips and out into the crisp evening air, the hoarseness an after-effect of the deep growl that he hadn’t used in quite a long time. What the hell had brought this on in the first place? Hadn’t the omega realised that he was on the verge of his heat? It was extremely rare in their day and age for an omega to be away from home even relatively close to the start of their cycle anyway, but to be out and about when it actually started was practically unheard of.
He cleared his mind, knowing it was the way he absorbed information best, and fell into the rhythmic motions of bobbing his head. It was more muscle memory than anything else by now, so the act took very little concentration. After three months spent on his knees worshipping this man, he knew what his lover needed. Sherlock would shift his weight to his left foot when he wanted to be teased. While equal weight on both feet meant he wanted it quick and dirty, which is what he was asking for now.
They argue in circles, neither willing to back down. Sherlock still won’t explain his behaviour, and John is getting sick of it. What’s so difficult about telling the truth?
Harry leans forward and places a hand on his shoulder. “Look, if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. You can’t force a relationship, but you also can’t sit and complain about all the ways things went wrong, if you didn’t at least try and fix them. I was an arse to Clara. She tried, and I wouldn’t listen, and her leaving was, unfortunately, the best thing to happen to me. I needed to lose her to realise how far down the hole I had fallen. But John, not a day goes by where I don’t wish I hadn’t fought harder for her. Don’t be me.”
Sandpaper might as well be lining his throat with how rough and dry it feels. John gives a hard swallow and watches the mental gears of deduction rotate behind Sherlock’s breath-taking eyes. Trying to decipher where in the world John is going with this.
slept with? Wait... don't answer that. I don't think my mind palace can handle the number. John, put your gun on the table, and I'm
“Don’t use—“ His eyes blow wide as he sees John already on the laptop, scrolling through the pages and pages of information. John can barely pull his eyes away to look at him. Was this all he was to Sherlock? Some experiment; a source of data for him to analyse?
Another question that John isn’t prepared to tackle, yet it is exactly what he wants to know. So he nods in pained agreement.
A bloom of heated breath fell along Sherlock’s testicles as John moved up and down his shaft with the delicate edge that only a surgeon had. Sherlock was making odd high pitched noises that he wanted to stop, but found that was all his mouth seemed able to make. John was everywhere, and the soft smell of his aftershave and the heady Cabernet was stuck within Sherlock’s skin.
“What the hell did you say to Kraig?” I swallow more coffee and pretend not to hear him. “Sherlock…”
If only he’d not become so overwhelmed, not panicked when John asked him if he had a boyfriend, things could have turned out so differently. They could have been something more. And now — now it was too late. It would always be too late.
Once inside the garden, there was nowhere to hide. In order to get a good look at the ground, they needed to come within sight of the back windows and pray that no one was home. A wide patio spread out from the base of the house, spreading about five metres in each direction. Sherlock took out a small vial from his pocket and collected a sample of soil from where the patio met the grass and took another from the far end of the garden, right at the base of the fence. He’d take it back to the lab and cross-reference it with their existing sample. That would give them a definite idea of if the body was ever here.
John opens the freezer and pulls out a half-open packet of fish fingers, and after some more rummaging, finds a lone potato from the back of the cupboard. He’ll go shopping tomorrow. Once the oven is on and the timer has been set, he goes to fetch his laptop, only to find it missing. It’s not in his room, nor in the usual spots in the living room. Did he leave it at the surgery?
“I can’t say that it’s okay because it’s not,” Sherlock eventually admits. “I wanted to be okay with it, but all my life, no one has wanted me. Not the
After he'd managed to catch his breath and stop seeing stars, he laughed. Deep and rich, a sound of pure joy that came from the heart. It wasn't an act or an attempt to manipulate Sherlock. Rather, it was completely genuine.
“And what do I owe this…” John begins, before frowning deeply. “Definitely not pleasure. Quite the opposite. Misery? Yeah, that works.” John internally smirks at the affronted look on Mycroft’s face. Good to get his kicks in whilst he can.
"No condom," Sherlock whimpered. The soles of his feet already were sliding over the soft sheets on the mattress as he tried and failed to keep still. "I want to feel all of you. Each wisp of your hair and scrape of your teeth. All the smoothness of your shaft as it enters me…"
“So much for gently easing our friends into this new part of our relationship, hmm?” John gasped between chuckles.
“There you are,” John chuckles. “Lost you for a moment. So, shall we get back to the tasks? I think it’s your turn to embarrass me this time around.”
"Mary will understand that I'm asking her to meet me there. It's going to be messy on both sides, she'll expect a trap, and she'll know I'm expecting one. But, if Sherlock is right, she won't be able to resist the opportunity to see me. And," John said grimly, "unless you have a secret twin of mine hidden away, I'm going to have to show up, or she'll never show her face."
The rest of the day passed by slowly, both revelling in each other's company. They eventually got out of bed around noon, not bothering to change out of their pyjamas, and Sherlock spent the rest of the afternoon playing his violin, with John listening from the sofa. There was nothing new about the interaction. Sherlock had played for John many times before, but now there was static electricity in the air, an underlying tension that hadn’t been there before. At first, Sherlock thought it was the sexual tension, but as time passed he wasn’t sure.
was better. This should have been enough for her. A pat on the back for all of her hard work and dedication, but that’s not how the fate decided to deal with Mary Morstan.
On the other side of the city, Sherlock was about to throw an ancient coffee maker out of the nearest window he could find. This would involve having to go up a flight of stairs to get out of the morgue, but caffeine was more than worth it.
But that’s what grief always did. It sunk into the soul without a proper exit strategy, and the torture of it trying to escape ravaged its host like atomic bombs. John was used to that type of suffering. That deep rhythmic pain that survived off of rage and sorrow until eventually, little by little, it eroded away. Relocated to a different human-shaped husk that made the mistake of letting it in because it was better than feeling nothing at all.
Sherlock hadn’t meant his last sentence to end in a question, but it somehow seemed fitting. His mind and heart were both bursting with questions as of late. He waited as John furrowed his brow in what Sherlock had come to recognise as gentle contemplation. His stomach fluttered with hope.
“But...that’s hardly fair though. We both should have to do a task. Tell you what, I’m game for it if I also get to come up with silly things for you to do as well. Deal?”
John hands Sherlock the keys as he pays the driver. Sherlock notices the tip is large enough to ensure silence regarding their conversation in the cab.
John tried to encapsulate the epitome of nonchalant ease. He had done nothing wrong, but there was a creeping dread that belonged in snuff films. Only in this iteration, it’s John’s dignity that was about to die a slow and lingering demise.
They swayed until they somehow made their way into the kitchen. Sherlock lifted John onto  the table, desperate to remove the height difference. A pile of papers slid to the floor, exploding into a flurry of noise as they hit the tile. The sound mixed with John’s moans, heady and deep as Sherlock’s clever fingers unzipped his fly. He paused, his hand hovering over John’s underwear, the fabric wet with pre-come.
The front door to 221B was opened just enough for Greg to know that this was going to be one of the nights that he just made sure John continued to breathe. The sliver of golden light coming from the flat created darker shadows as Greg made sure to avoid the creaky twelfth step so as not to wake up Mrs. Hudson. Of course, he was aware that she was only pretending to sleep. Probably sitting in her kitchen as she sipped a cup of now lukewarm tea and silently hoped that the noises she had heard upstairs were John just being too exhausted from another double shift at the clinic. That her texting Lestrade tonight was preventative, and nothing more.
Anderson felt his eyebrows lower as he considered this. "Sherlock deeply respected music," he replied.
John rolls his eyes. “Kraig with a K, and come on you git, let’s get you up off the kitchen floor before Mrs Hudson walks in. God knows what she already thinks happens in this flat.”
I shift a little and he adjusts his grip so that I am completely wrapped up in his arms and admittedly, in my dreams, I had us both upright at this moment, but one must work with what’s available in the end.
Data. Notes. Hypotheses. John had sexual proclivities that Sherlock could and would satisfy. All that Sherlock had to manage was the documentation of events and situations that made John the most content. Then continue the cycles until John could logically never see himself with another person again.
Mrs. Hudson learned how not to press certain sore spots from years with a husband now rotting in a Florida cell. Fear
John was thankful the building was empty, save for the two of them. If the landlady had been home, she would have heard him before actually getting a chance to meet him.
Sherlock hissed out a breath through clenched teeth before taking John's lips again. His tongue licked at all of the guttural moans that tried to tear themselves out of John's wettened mouth, and Sherlock gulped down them all.
“I think you’ll find it is.” Sherlock retorted, sliding his mobile out of his pocket and dialling Lestrade.
John comes in a bitten-off cry and Sherlock feels every pulsating centimeter. His mind is awash with white noise as he floods inside of John’s waiting body. Eyes rolling madly and muscles on autopilot as he keeps spilling more and more. John’s open mouth kisses hot on his face as Sherlock feels a blast of wind against his back as if the roof has blasted off of 221b. He might as well be flying.
With one more kiss to the inside of Sherlock's leg, John reached for the lube and flicked the cap open. He didn't just coat Sherlock's entrance; he poured a liberal amount over Sherlock's cock as well. With his left hand on Sherlock's shaft, he circled the index finger of his right hand over the tight ring of muscles, waiting for Sherlock to give him permission.
There was a free fall of data folders crashing from shelves inside Sherlock's mind palace. They all were moving too fast for Sherlock to tell where any of them belonged. John was rearranging all of Sherlock's internal files with just the tip of his tongue.
Harry is long asleep by the time John gets home. The flat is pitch black, and he barely makes it to the sofa without tripping. He’d spent the entire tube ride back berating himself for letting Leah down. He should never have agreed to go on that date. He wasn’t ready.
John begins to drift to sleep, still mulling the thoughts over. He has to decide: with Sherlock, or without? Either way, Harry’s words have never rung truer. He’s a Watson. It may take them a long time, and they may struggle to verbalise it, but when they fall, they fall hard.
, hovering on the periphery, and, as much as Sherlock had enjoyed it in the beginning, the change in their relationship had made his presence distracting. Every second of every day, there was a part of his brain that was constantly thinking about John, cataloguing his every position, trying to decipher his every thought. It was infuriating, and Sherlock couldn’t work out how to turn it off. He was sure that the reason he’d missed something, the reason there was still a killer on the loose, was because his mind was being pulled in two directions. It had never been like this before. This entire case had taken months, all because Sherlock couldn’t order his thoughts for long enough to focus.
John opens his mouth to make an excuse for Sherlock’s absence. That he was in the middle of a murder investigation, and John was ultimately fine and just being kept for observation. However, before John can manage to say anything else, Sherlock takes hold of John’s hand with his own and gives them a gentle squeeze. John patiently waits for Sherlock to speak, pushing down the anxieties growing inside. They may be making an effort to communicate, but that doesn’t make it easy. Sherlock lets out a deep sigh and turns to face the ceiling, as if remembering some important information.
And the worst part? He’s aware of it all, but is powerless to stop it. Every so often, he even catches Sherlock staring at him when they eat breakfast or right after sex, deducing John as if his life depends on it.
"Will you take the last tablet and have some pancakes, please? Then I need to check those stitches on your leg." When Sherlock nodded, John stood up and held out a hand to help Sherlock up. "And don't worry about the toaster. I threw a table through the window earlier."
More wine was poured, and John was getting a little more handsy. Nothing too overt but enough for Sherlock to know that the ludicrous articles may have actually been worth reading.
“Great, you can pick me up from outside.” She winks and slips out the door, leaving him standing outside, alone. Once she’s gone, John can sense that same uneasiness he felt before he had talked to Harry. He still plans on talking with Sherlock soon, but he needs a nice time with someone different. Just to clear his head and try to have a bit of fun. So why can’t that be Leah? She’s smart, funny, and open-minded. He has no reason to feel guilty.
I need to breathe and ignore this. I have to ignore what John’s hands are doing when they have a purpose like bringing pleasure. I have to ignore how his face must look in the throes of passion. Dark blue eyes the colour of a winter bound storm, and how his heart races as his hips swivel as he is just skittering on the edge of a glorious climax. Curvy arse undulating as he goes deeper and harder and my hands on the small of his back and hanging on for dear life and—
“Thought you did my arse,” Harry snarks, and John throws back a confused look. “You’re a Watson, John. We’re not good with our feelings, but we definitely know when we’re in bloody love. And when we need to punch the hell out of someone too, but still. Anyway...you have to tell him exactly how you feel, all the time. It’s no use expecting everyone to understand where you’re coming from; you gotta tell them. And
The car lurched to a stop outside of 221 Baker Street, and Sherlock practically flung money at the driver before pulling John out of the cab and dragging him up the stairs. John’s laughter rang out through the hallway while Sherlock got the front door opened and closed it beyond him with a snap. John was on him in a flash, his lips on Sherlock’s and unzipping Sherlock’s fly with his free hand.
Perhaps this was all some long and miserable hell that he’d never escape. A slanted reality where Sherlock’s shadowed face peered around every crease of John’s rattled mind to enchant him with eyes the colors of an everlasting rainstorm.
He pulled his hand away and turned to look out of the window. Sherlock was so shaken that he forgot to text Molly all together. What was that about?
“I’ll grab us a couple of seats?” John whispers loudly into Sherlock’s ear. “Whatever you get at the bar is fine by me.”
Sherlock stifled a moan that was luckily covered up by the driver’s quick turn onto Baker Street. John’s strong hold on Sherlock’s wrist loosened just enough for Sherlock to exhale a breath. His pants were straining against an erection created by John’s words, and Sherlock needed to relieve the pressure.
He slipped back out of the door and into the cool evening air. It washed over his face and he closed his eyes, taking in a deep lungful and relishing the burn that seeped into the crevices of his lungs. There was a time, not long ago, that Sherlock wouldn’t have thought twice about following the man home, or into a by-the-hour hotel room. It surprised him now, that the thought hadn’t even crossed his mind. He had wished, beyond reason, that John had been beside him, ready to tell the young bloke exactly where he could put his drink. He could almost hear the giggles that would erupt from them afterwards, once that thirst trap wannabe had retreated with his tail between his legs.
"I'm probably going to be jailed over this insanity," and in hindsight that was said a bit louder than he meant, but bollocks to privacy at this point. "Call me back,
There were only two cameras left. Just two cameras to document the changes. To let the new routine of John Watson's environment create the necessary grooves. One camera peered around the corner, and into the kitchen. Observing the doctor as he drank tea and gin in equal measure, and the meals as gingerly handled as land mines. The second camera nestled itself in the sitting room. The angle of it low enough to catch the darkness that sunk under the eyes of the smaller man as he tapped away at his laptop. Blog posts forgotten in a hurricane of apologies and apathy, and that was for the best after all.
“Well, this time was evidently different, and...he knows. About us.”  Sherlock frowns and turns back to the files. It feels partly like their break up all over again, and the sick feeling is returning to John’s stomach.  “Did you tell him?”
By the time John had gotten to the front door of his flat, his arms were trembling and incredibly sore. The Omega was slender, but still much taller than he was and the dead weight from the bridal hold was almost too much to bear. With a few well-placed huffs he had gotten them up the flight of steps and into the entryway. John peered around quickly to make sure that absolutely no one had followed them and then unlocked the front door all while shifting the omega in his arms enough to get the door open and clamber inside. With a swift kick of his foot, the door shut behind them. John's two-bedroom flat wasn't overly spacious, and at this precise moment, he hated his past self for being so minimalistic. It made manoeuvring his patient more involved, but John was eventually able to get the man laid out onto the living room couch.
As the floats travel past his heart begins to settle, still full of joy but no longer threatening to burst out of his chest. They sing along to ‘This Is Me’ as a Greatest Showman themed float drives past, their throats growing hoarse as they shout out the lyrics as loud as they can.
“Thank god you finally answered,” Greg sighed, tone full of relief. “I’ve been texting you for the past hour. It’s urgent. There was a body found this afternoon, about ten miles out of London. It’s the same MO as Pierce, but...I need you and John to get here as soon as you can.”
London is rarely dull, even in Sherlock’s darkest of moods. The city always has the capacity to enchant him enough to step out of the flat and ruffle up the people within it with his own brand of brilliance. So, it was already a losing battle even before a former army soldier turned vampire came into both Sherlock’s life and in his bed. Yet, sulking is still a skill that Sherlock has practiced for far too long to not put to good use.
Silence fell, and Sherlock turned back to the table. The strangulation pattern indicated that the victim knew their attacker, anonymous killers rarely bothered to hide their face. On the contrary, some liked to see their victim’s face as the life drained out of it.
The bar was crowded, warm bodies pushing against each other in the dim light, but he found a secluded seat in the corner and ordered a whisky. He swirled it around the glass, trying to order his thoughts into neat files. He didn’t care about the restaurant, the casual undermining of their relationship by John, not anymore. He was scared of the person he’d become — the one that fought for validation from strangers, that wanted people to look at John and know that he was his. He had never been that person, the one that saw injustices in every fold of the world and fought to make them right. Oh, he admired those people, but he preferred to blend into the background, unobserved. But today, today had been different, and he couldn’t understand why.
“Where are you going?” Sherlock commands, but there’s a meek quality blended in his tone that melts John’s resolve just a fraction.
“We can take this slow for now, if you want? Start simple, work our way up. Do you want that?” He asks, and it takes all my control to let him finish the sentence.
He groans again, but this time with the effort of trying to figure out where the hell he ended up. Awareness of him not being in his musty bedsit on the edge of the city is slowly sinking in. It’s not an overwhelming surprise. The room is too spacious and the bed is way too large and comfortable to be his own.
Some hind part of his brain warned him that it was bad business to sleep with a client, but if Sherlock was willing. Well, damnit, so was he. He pulled away and cupped a hand over Sherlock's perfect cheek. Still, he had to slow down long enough to check that Sherlock was, in fact, willing. Assumptions had the potential to make this whole situation uncomfortable.
Noticing John's holding up his empty glass in slight confusion, Sherlock stood up slowly and took the few steps necessary to reach the other man's chair. "I doubt that you made it through your line of work in civilian life without having to use more than that stunning mouth of yours." Then he glanced over from John to the Scotch. "Care for me to top…" he purred as he lifted up the bottle and tipped a fresh amount into John's waiting glass. "...you off?" He finished, so close that he could and did count all of the freckles on John's upturned face. Forty-seven freckles exactly, and each of them more kissable than the previous one. "Or perhaps," he continued, the edge of his arse lightly sitting on the arm of John's chair, “You’d more prefer to control the events.”
A surprise. Obviously. Of course. John should be relieved that there wasn’t a big red bow tied up at the tip of the cock since Sherlock was in such a gifting spirit.
“That boyfriend of yours needs house training.” Anderson sneers from behind him. John turns to see the forensic technician standing a few metres away, his hands in his pockets.
“You and four other people at this point, I believe,” Sally sighed. Her dark brown eyes made sure that the door was closed as tightly as possible. “I only found out a year ago myself, so you weren’t the only one kept in the dark for longer than should have been.”
“Eating something will help,” John advises as he spoons out a few of a bowl's contents propped on the bedside table and presses it close to Sherlock’s lips. “Tomato basil blended in with O positive.”
John raises his eyebrows at Sherlock, who nods once and heads through the door. The club is booming with loud music and lots of bright lights. He already can sense a few eyes on him and John, all curious in both of them to various degrees.
Seb gave a tight nod before he snorted up a loogie and spat it right in front of John's bare feet. “Fucking wanker," he hissed, appearing to not even give two shits that John had the barrel of a gun trained right on him. "Deserves a stab in the gut for each of my sister's tears."
Sherlock stops updating John on his whereabouts, leaving John anxiously pacing 221b, hoping that the detective hasn't been knocked out and dumped in the Thames. He becomes single-minded, throwing himself back into the case with everything he has, even though there's no new information. Lestrade has to ban him from the yard, just to make sure he gets some sleep. John, on the other hand, finds himself getting defensive, over analysing every situation where he and Sherlock stand too close in public, become too comfortable with each other and at home, they fiercely make up for the loss of closeness. John starts caring what people think, constantly worrying if strangers will think they are together. He hates himself for it, but at the same time, he can't seem to stop. He closes up, retreating into himself for fear of anyone knowing what's really going through his head.
“It’s not just that.” John adds, his gaze settling on a point just above Sherlock’s shoulder, where a rainbow beach towel sits on its shelf. It’s easier not to maintain eye contact. “I’ve been saying I’m bisexual because it seemed the easiest and I already knew what it meant, but now I’m faced with all these identitiys and labels, I have no idea anymore. What if I’m something else, and I just don’t know it yet? What if I’ve been telling people the wrong thing? What if--”
. Mind checking your phone?” John asks. “You were taking pictures all night, and I need to figure out how I ended up in Kensington.”
"Both of you need to listen," Sherlock sighed, "because both of you are connected to me, and regardless of how much you may loathe each other, I happen to be fond of the both of you...as insane as the two of you are."
Within a few weeks, he saw significant progress in an affirmative direction. John’s mood elevated dramatically as Sherlock explored and documented more. Still, there were nuances that Sherlock needed to dissect. Receiving blow jobs in the morning was a favourite for John, but after John ended up late to the surgery because a very focused Sherlock spent the morning sucking his cock, it was decided by both that early-rise fellatio should be only for when John had nowhere to be before noon.
“You preposterously beautiful man,” he wheezes as he presses me into the softness of blankets. “As if you are allowed to die at any point for at least the next 50 years or so. I have so many plans for how to make you orgasm. Starting with another one, right now...if you’re agreeable to it.”
Wanting to draw this out, so it wasn't over before it had even begun, John regretfully dragged his hand away from Sherlock's groin. He focused his attention on Sherlock's arse, on the back of his thighs and lowered back. Trailing his fingernails softly across the quivering flesh. He sucked one more purple claim to the space between Sherlock's shoulder blades before gently tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention.
A low grinding noise, somewhere between a grunt and a sigh, built up in John's chest. He was vaguely aware that he hadn't exactly finished a single sentence during his explanation, but the gist was there. And, judging by the pinched expression clouding Sherlock's face, he understood.
“He had the audacity to spout out his inane theory about the case,” Sherlock spat out. “As if I needed any assistance that has his fingerprints all over it.”
Both Irene and Molly eat and drink in relaxed silence for a while, and the cats come and go as they please. Molly fiddles with her jumper as she decides if this is the proper time to say what has been on her mind for quite a while.
"DI Lestrade has my overnight bag," John said once he'd straightened back out and was closing Sherlock's door. "Any chance we can get that delivered to Baker Street?"
John sighs, digging his hands further into his pockets and adjusting his back against the wall. “Because I don’t know if Sherlock is here.”
say I’m overreacting,” John hisses, eavesdropping Scotland Yarders be damned. “You weren’t breathing for well over three minutes, you self centered dick! Complete disregard for what could have happened without me to stop that maniac from getting the drop on you. Like you’re motherfucking invincible! I had half a mind to stop CPR and let you just…” John’s words trail away, as if he isn’t seeing anything but what Sherlock was a few moments ago. Death pale and growing colder at the touch. Sherlock can feel John’s arms trembling with the effort to erase the vision. John’s voice softens as he continues, “...it’s like nothing else matters to you but dancing on the edge of the cliff. All while the people in your life are terrified of the one day that you won’t be fucking clever enough to stop from falling over…”
“What was tonight about?” John asks, startling Sherlock from his reverie. He pauses, considering side-stepping the question, but in the end, he gives in.
9:30 pm: John made his first real mistake of the night and agreed to go to a local pub just down the road. Harry still had the ability to convince him that a drink or two couldn’t cause any harm. If anything it would take his mind off of a life crashed back into the heart of London. It also helped that she was buying.
There was an answer. There was always an answer about how to quiet his mind, and it was currently clutched in his hand, hidden within the depths of his pocket. Just one hit. One dose, carefully controlled, then he could solve the case and go back to John. Because as much as the man frustrated him, as much as he wanted to pry John Watson out of his mind, he wouldn’t. He couldn’t. John had become a part of him, as integral as the cases and deductions, something he couldn’t live without. So, if he couldn’t focus with him, but couldn’t live without, then this was the only way.
“And you managed to find a serial killer with only a few grams of soil. That, that is beyond extraordinary.” John leaned forward to hover just over Sherlock’s ear, taking his time to let the words sink in and do their magic. “You’re a genius. There’s no one else who could have done that, only you.”
Greg chuckled at the question, followed by waving his hand to the bartender to get them another round of drinks.
John lept from the sofa, one hand covering his quickly wilting erection, the other scrambling across the floor for his trousers. A deep scarlet blush was creeping up John’s neck, followed by him yelping as he shot a glance back at Sherlock, who was still incredibly nude on the sofa. The same sofa on which, only a week ago, the DI had consoled the doctor regarding another first date gone wrong.
Should he ask more? He barely knew what had happened during those formidable years; he’d never thought to ask. Sherlock knew enough — he deduced scraps of information by John’s habits and his reactions to certain stimuli, but they’d never had a real conversation about it.
“Then...and just bear with me a moment,” Harry replies. “Let’s take the understandable shock of the spreadsheet away...if the topic was anything else, what would you deem from it?”
“I give you a task to do at each of the bars we go to tonight, and if you are successful, you get a point. Any task you are not able to complete, the point goes to me instead.”
With a huff, John begins to get out of his chair. If Sherlock decides to involve him in the case at some point, that would be grand. Right now, he has old cases to write up.
“You like it when I say what others are too blind to see,” John went on. “How bloody amazing you are. What that mind of yours is capable of dissecting with the merest of clues.”
At least, that's what Sherlock surmises was going off like church bells inside of that particular place in his brain. The ringing sounds clambered with the other much more devilish noises that were coming out of his mouth as John's skilful fingers gave decent tugs to the base of his erection.
John was facing away from the door by the time Sherlock finally arrived. He was in a shared ward, but only half of the beds were full; an elderly lady in the far corner opposite John and a middle-aged gentleman near the door. They both glared as Sherlock burst through the door, but John didn’t so much as turn around.
- down on his knees and worshipping Sherlock's stomach and pelvis with butterfly kisses and apologies that might cause a collapse of Sherlock's limbic system.
He tries to push the thoughts from his head, but it's too late. Those lips on his become Sherlock’s, the hand on his neck grows rougher and larger, and the faint scent of Sherlock’s poncy shampoo fills his nose.
When Sherlock snuck back into the flat, at well past midnight, 221b was quiet. The stairs creaked in the darkness, announcing his return to the empty sitting room. John’s coat lay on the back of his chair as if taken off in a hurry, and his dress shoes were placed under the coffee table. The deduction spoke for itself. John had come back in a rush to throw off the clothing he only wore because he knew Sherlock adored it when he dressed up, but John’s discomfort could only be held at bay for so long.
“Hey,” Sherlock replies as if he’d not been gone all day, without a word to say where he’d been. He yawns and picks his laptop up from the table, sinking into his chair and opening the lid. John stares at him as Sherlock types vigorously for a few seconds before he speaks again.
He froze, self-assurance suddenly deflated as Harold pulled out what John knew was the reason why he was
” The cracking is getting louder now, echoing against the inside of his skull like a migraine. His ribs have begun to ache in his chest, and the numbing cold is returning, sending waves of shivers through his body. His teeth rattle against each other as he brings his hands to his ears, trying to block out the steady
Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes. If anything, he should feel flattered. The man was young and attractive, and clearly interested. Once, he was the type that Sherlock would have easily taken somewhere quick and secluded, but that felt like centuries ago.
“No, Sherlock. You are exactly the person I need. I have felt more alive with you than I ever have, and I am prepared to do anything to make this work. I want
pain in the arse, whatever that means now. John waits until after their server drops off another couple of beers to answer. She gives a flirty smile to John, which he pointedly ignores.
Irene pauses with her newly made drink to her mouth. Her scarlet red nail polish is the exact shade of her lips, and she watches Sherlock with mild interest. It is hard to discern if Sherlock is a man or a fly, but either way, he might as well be bound in a sticky web. Irene takes a sip of the drink.
A trembling sound much like what a man dying of thirst might cry out when finally reaching water flew out of Sherlock's mouth. John caught it and held it in his teeth whilst Sherlock could do nothing but grip onto John's hips with whatever was left of his sanity.
end up spending a decent amount of time hugging the toilet. He cursed himself for over-indulging but couldn’t find it in him to regret a single moment of it.
Sherlock gives a small cough and rolls his shoulders, trying to relax his now tense shoulders. This is John; he’s safe here.
John’s head lolled to the right to meet the centre of Sherlock’s chest. The doctor’s fingers grasped onto Sherlock’s lapels and pulled him even closer. His hands were shaking with the effort to just hold on for dear life as Sherlock stroked him to a mind-splitting climax. His mouth hung open as Sherlock watched him; explored him with the keen eyes created for this type of indescribable scrutiny.
Some antiseptic and a few bandages later, John put his kit away and declared Sherlock patched up. He hadn't wanted to go over the old stitches with new ones, so he'd just used a bit of glue meant for deep wounds. That and the bandage, he was confident the wound had its best chances at healing.
John fell silent for a few footbeats, and Sherlock glanced surreptitiously over at him. Perhaps Sherlock should have led with something different. He hadn’t considered until now that maybe John wouldn’t appreciate being told that Sherlock had cloned his scent. Was that something he’d consider not good?
He breathed in and out as he recalled his medical training. Before the Alpha hormone-blocking device had been a part of his everyday kit at the hospital, he had taken courses in how to curb his urges when times like these became an eventuality in his profession; to assist an omega patient in heat when he didn't have access to all the proper tools otherwise.
Sherlock bites his bottom lip. Perhaps his research hadn’t been as thorough as he first thought, but most of the most detailed books regarding Vampirism are illegal.

She slipped her palm underneath the instrument, much like one would cradle a newborn baby. With slight trepidation wrapped in a soft sheen of reverence. The strings shone in the light of daybreak and reflected in her own widened eyes. Something this cherished belonged where it could always be adored.
If John noticed, he didn’t say anything. It wasn’t unusual for Sherlock to space out after cases, exhausted by the mental expenditure and the inevitable crap he put his body through, but this — this felt different. This wasn’t his body forcing him to slow down. It was his mind, and for once in a very long time, Sherlock was frightened.
John hesitates, waiting for the catch. He glances over Mycroft’s shoulder to the computer screen. His reflection stares back at him. “I...I see a doctor. A soldier. A bloke who wants to punch you in the fucking nose. Why?”
“We’d like the steak tartar and the blue cheese wedge salads to start,” Sherlock said to the server whilst John made small noises of annoyance. “And if you could keep the wine coming. John needs it to prevent the stroke he seems determined to have.”
In spite of himself, Sherlock wanted to learn more. He needed to understand every scent that affixed itself to John in every imaginable scenario. The way grass clung to John’s shoes after they chased a witness through Hampstead Heath. The change in aftershave when John’s latest girlfriend said that he was too
“That was painted by Irene,” John remarks as he plops the small suitcase on the large double bed. “The woman can practically do anything.”
Sherlock grunted as he pressed the brew button again. The coffee maker gave a small and pitiful splutter but gratefully began to work this time. Sherlock barely allowed the last drops of coffee to collect in the pot before pulling it off the warmer.
“John…” Sherlock answers back, his legs tremble as he slips inside, and John babbles out more curses before biting the side of Sherlock’s neck again. Sherlock groans and pushes deep and in. The sweltering heat of John pierces him just as much as John’s sharp fangs.
John flinches as if Sherlock has shouted, but of course he won't give John that satisfaction. Then John would be allowed to yell back without feeling guilty about it later.
“If you want it so badly, then say it.” Irene lifts something gently out of the drawer but keeps it hidden from Sherlock’s view. She turns, holding the object behind her back and walking slowly towards him, her eyes trained on Sherlock. He blinks, and in a second, the purple shirt and now baggy trousers are gone, replaced by a fitted white dress, cut off just above the knees. The skin on her arms and neck is covered in a thin, skin-tight layer of black organza that shimmers as she moves; tiny jewels embedded in the fabric catch the light as she walks.
John hadn't known true pleasure before the moment Sherlock's finger breached him. Every orgasm, or cry of pleasure, had simply been research before this moment. His vision swam, which was preposterous because he was 99% sure his eyes were closed and tried as he might no sound would come out of his spent throat.
Pictures of dead and living relatives alike fell to the floor with various clattering sounds and some glass shattered, but Sherlock's only goal was to make John's mouth open wider with every move. He needed to make John come. He needed to ensure that John knew that
...I thought about you in that shit of a bedsit. Fucking my fist..imagining it was your mouth instead.
The only consistency in 221b was the spreadsheet. Sherlock spent more and more time tending to it, as if it were a fickle houseplant in constant need of attention. It helped that John seemed to be, for the most part, happy with their sex life, and the inclusion of light BDSM now and then was a thrilling addition. Still, there was that occasional nagging in the back of Sherlock’s brain that he should be doing more for John. He made small adjustments here and there on the spreadsheet to make their romantic life as perfect as possible, but there were variables outside of his control. It didn’t help that Mrs Hudson had opened an old wound with one simple sentence.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” John demands, taking a determined step into the kitchen. I sigh, swallowing down the last of the coffee. So, we’re doing this.
John crouched down so that he was at the same level as the young boy, who was at most nine or ten. It was something that medical school had taught so many years ago. People trust you when they can see you eye to eye, and this was no exception.
“Clearly,” she replied, mouth in the faintest of smiles. “Thirty months away from him has done wonders for your sexuality…”
“It’s fine,” John muttered. “It’s all fine. I want you to.” He took Sherlock into his mouth again, sinking all the way to the base, swirling his tongue around the shaft as he did so. One more sensual lick, and Sherlock came, his muscles contracting in waves as his hands fisted into John’s hair.
“What...what are you doing?” Molly eventually asks, still standing in the kitchen doorway, frozen with disbelief. She slowly makes her way to the basket, warily inspecting its contents, her mouth falling open at the artisan items inside. “Gorau Glas? That’s almost £60 a kilo!” She exclaims.
“He’s just yet another strange man in my house. I’m tired of being polite, it’s much more fun to wind them up.”
Sherlock at least had gotten trousers on, though all other clothing was not of any interest. He padded barefoot to the kitchen, mind tremendously clear and memory fully intact and aware of exactly how stupid he had acted for the last hours. This was all the fucking Morstan woman's fault, and no matter where John was (Lestrade was keeping quiet about that, hence the throwing of chairs at the DI's head), Sherlock would kill everyone connected to this case himself. He just needed to find his gun.
"That's the spot, yeah, Two bullets back to back. I think she meant the second to hit my heart, but I dove right, and she missed." John's chest rose as he sucked in a deep breath. He didn't like thinking about that moment. He'd trusted her, so had everyone else. And after so many successful operations, no one had seen her betrayal coming. "Bitch ruined my favourite tattoo. It was a sloth with a briefcase. Not sure I can ever forgive her for that."
me. Not the one who doesn’t always understand human emotion, or who keeps fingers in the fridge. Not the one who can talk, in detail, about all the different types of tobacco ash but has no clue about the solar system. Until you.” John’s heart leaps in his chest, remembering that day. “You walked into that lab and you wanted
“People who are ace can have sex for many reasons, Sherlock. They have sex because they enjoy helping their partner feel good for example, or they find pleasure in orgasms and afterglow, but not necessarily the build up to it.”
“So is that all you wanted to speak to me about?” Irene continued. “Not that I mind providing information, but you are not the type to just want that. You are solution driven. Yet another trait we share.”
There was clear bruising around the neck, made before death; obvious strangulation. Dirt caked under the fingernails, but no DNA had come back in the lab report, so the victim wasn’t facing the killer. She struggled, grasping at the ground, but couldn’t see who was attacking her. Bruising on the neck was consistent, there was a pattern of fingerprints over her trachea, and a small concentration of bruising on the nape of her neck, where two thumbs had pushed against her spine.
Then Mary put finality to it all by blocking his number. It was the last bit of kindness that she could give, and John gulped it down like broken glass.
Sherlock felt himself bristle at the question but pretended not to hear it. The last thing he wanted to think about was John; Sherlock had snuck out of the flat just to avoid him for as long as possible.
She does not wait for Sherlock to answer and instead, in a few strides, is at the hotel room door and opens it. A stark white light shines through to what should be the tiny hallway, and Sherlock leans over in an attempt to look inside.
The question gives Sherlock enough reason to look up from The Work. His ever-changing eyes are a darker blue than usual, cast in shadow by the light of the London sky, fading in the back window.
He knew it was unfair to be this riled, but John’s comment had got under his skin. It had reminded him of their meeting with Sebastian, when John had disregarded him as a ‘colleague’. Did he mean so little?
remember what he had eight shots of last night? He closes his eyes and allows his mind to drift, trying to recall the series of events.
“I’m already so close,” John admits. His tongue swipes over his lips, and the bed dips beside him as Sherlock adjusts his position. Sherlock takes the head of John’s cock into his mouth and smoothly slides down. John chokes out a cry at the feeling, and his hips take on a life of their own and give a small thrust.
Irene gives a sly smile, settling herself back against the cushions and uncrossing her legs. “Well, this is a sensitive time; there’s lots of processing to do. So I usually delve into people's subconscious and let them decide who, and what, they see. Mostly it’s people's homes and loved ones, but you, Mr Holmes, have chosen a little differently. I half expected to look like Dr Watson, or perhaps the lovely Mrs Hudson, but I suppose Miss Adler will do.” She inspects her hands as if seeing them for the first time, and an uneasy feeling settles itself in Sherlock’s stomach.
Sherlock shrugs his shoulders and pulls a fresh cigarette from the pack and lights it up fast. John doesn’t say anything this time, but he can feel his facial muscles tense at the long drag that Sherlock takes with the window still closed.
“No,” I mutter back, avoiding her gaze and instead taking another bite from the plate of homemade biscuits from the kitchen table. “Obviously, John isn’t ready for a relationship and besides...he should be able to enjoy himself.”
Seb pushed the switchblade up to John's throat and pressed in enough to draw a trickle of blood. "Didn't know ya name, but best believe that I remember your face, mate...my sister Julia Moran sends her regards. I planned on just slitting your neck when I finally found ya, but since I stumbled on ya naked, maybe I'll keep your cock framed up for a warning for other shit men like you."
“I can’t concentrate, John. Not with you—” Sherlock flaps his hand in front of him. “—hovering around all the time!”
By the time it was over, he felt himself struggling to keep a hold of John in his arms, but he refused to let go.
A few more days pass, and John does his best to roll with this new Sherlock, but there’s a constant nagging in his chest. This isn’t right. This isn’t the Sherlock he knows — the one that never noticed what he was wearing, let alone mentioned it. He’s not even sure if it’s better than the Sherlock of before, the one that would switch from hot to cold in a matter of seconds. The one that, whenever a case emerged, would throw on his mask and erect his walls, not letting anyone in until it was solved. That Sherlock was hard to be around, hard to love — but this version of the detective is just as scary. Everything feels so false, so forced.
"I don't know…" John said honestly, admitting it to himself and to Greg thanks to the alcohol. "You're going to laugh, but we just met officially today. I needed to prove a point to him… See, he and I have been chatting on Twitter for a while now, silly things mostly. But I noticed a pattern with other forensic officers turning up dead under mysterious or less than natural causes. Told him about the pattern, warned him about the danger he could possibly be in, and he shut me down."
John,” Sherlock continues, and there is a frantic look in Sherlock’s eyes that John has never seen before. “Data...variables...statistics are what helps me function through this.”
Sherlock pressed another kiss onto John’s lips and began to stroke John once more. This time with the most tried and true techniques for bringing John to orgasm quickly. John relaxed in Sherlock’s arms and threw back his head as Sherlock continued to bring him to the brink.
It takes him a moment to realise what he’s looking at. Excel is open, with a complicated spreadsheet of numbers displayed. He changes sheets and finds pages and pages of graphs and formula, all indecipherable. Was this about the case? He trawls through, trying to make sense of the data, and it’s only when he returns to the original sheet and reads the table headings that he understands. This is about him.
aware of this. He was told as much a few weeks after their first time together. Sherlock had mentioned that John's ability to cause his mind palace to quiet was one of the most remarkable skills that Sherlock had ever encountered. The admission was the closest thing to a love confession that Sherlock had ever given him, and he held it tight and would never let go.
at various pitches and skill levels until John panicked and punched a few of the closest ones directly in the face.
“You wrote that I was your boyfriend on the emergency contact...even after I took so long to arrive.”
Sherlock blinked back into the present to the glare of his own cab driver. He tossed over some money before hopping out of the car and moving towards the entrance. Images of John in various states of pain flitted across his mind, and he felt the intense need to vomit. He took the stairs two steps at a time, growing impatient when the automatic doors took too long to open. Sherlock snapped John’s name at the receptionist, practically bursting into a run once he had the room and floor number.
This was what Sherlock understood. The technical aspects of creating pleasure, how to build up the tension, putting pressure in all the right spots, until his partner couldn’t take it anymore. He’d build and build, denying them release until the last possible moment, before letting them fall apart. And right now, John was his for the experimentation. Glorious and sensual and quivering underneath his fingertips until they both finished each other off.
“I’ve been planning this for at least a year. I chose the perfect spot on the steps of the National Gallery, then I was going to take you down to the Thames and ask...ask if you’d marry me.” Sherlock opens the box, revealing a plain platinum ring nestled into a deep blue cushion. “And now you go and ruin my plans.” John’s eyes have become fixated on the ring, but when he looks up, Sherlock is grinning. The annoyance has melted away, replaced by a fond amusement. The two ring boxes face each other in challenge, but the two men holding them have softened, captivated by the eyes of the other.
Apparently, Sherlock does, and as immediately as possible. A surprised squeak comes out of John when Sherlock rushes forward and tastes John’s lips before reversing their positions and now laying on top of him. John’s heated growls are all Sherlock needs to know that this is a
“Evidently. The best way to irritate Mycroft is to ignore him. I’d suggest that we get onto more important things.”
“I’m done falling, John.” He murmurs, and with a surge of bravery, Sherlock closes the gap in between them. John’s lips are soft and sure as he kisses back, and Sherlock vows from this moment forward, the spectre of Irene will never see him again.
“But how? You haven’t told me how.” Sherlock grits his teeth, leaning heavily back against the headboard. His limbs feel numb and heavy, and the skin on his hands has begun to swell and bloat.
Sherlock frowns and looks away from those calculating blue eyes. Instead, he picks up the slide and lifts it up to the light.
Mycroft purses his lips and looks John up and down very slowly. “Your internalised biphobia is hardly a secret. I had merely hoped that Sherlock would not be on the receiving end of it.”
It was about a month after Mary that John began to wonder out loud. Little utterances that Martha would barely catch as she stood up to refill cups and get additional napkins. The tiny questions along with the crumbs of cake or biscuits that would scatter over the flowery tablecloth. Rhetorical queries as to what Sherlock would have thought of the most recent prime minister or the fact that Sally Donovan had been promoted. All subtle motivation to keep John’s mind moving before work at the clinic was set to begin.
It was exhausting being in a relationship with Anderson, but it was nothing in comparison to now having no choice but to work almost daily with an ex. With a long sigh, Sherlock shuffled his way out of the break room to continue working on the Bryers case. At least there was a tiny bit of interesting data about the blood spatter to keep his brain from going completely numb with boredom.
“I’m sorry, I can’t do this.” John takes a gulp of air, letting his hands fall back to his sides. Immediately, they begin to form fists, clenching and unclenching to release the adrenaline. “Leah, you’re a wonderful woman, but I—” He stops mid-sentence. What’s he supposed to say?
If they can handle this in the middle of one of the most involved cases they have ever dealt with, then they can get through anything. It will take time and patience, but they always push through everything together. They can be friends, and nothing more.
Ellie’s smile widens even more before taking John’s credit card and processing the charge. All the while, John discreetly puts the ring box in his back pocket and secures it properly this time.
John likes me. He fancies me. He opened himself up to more — literally and figuratively — because of me.
He moves forward because it’s the only option. The pub is only a few blocks north, with lots of distractions. Football matches and cheers from blokes on barstools. He might even get into a good conversation or two before his head becomes too fuzzy with beer.
doctor.” Sherlock said far too quickly. His usual stony facade must have slipped at the words because Irene cocked her head and gave a long, slow smirk. Her stance reminded him of the first time they met, in a room not unlike the one they were sat in now. A lot had changed since then, but her enigmaticness and cool, calculating gaze were much the same.
listening. The type of listening that John rarely sees, but savours with his entire being. Those dazzling eyes alight with formulaic understanding as pieces of a puzzle are formed from particles in the air that only Sherlock can orchestrate into a language of explanation. It’s the same rapt attention that John felt during that initial meeting, where he offered his mobile to the man that now held his heart in such lovely hands.
The driver nodded and pulled out a sleek black mobile phone from his pocket. John didn't wait to see if he was going to call or text the DI. He just walked around the car, stared at the boot while wondering where on earth they'd store the yarn back home, and quickly got into the car beside Sherlock.
. He wanted people to see them and know, beyond doubt, that he belonged to John. He had begun to feel an ache in his chest whenever John was away for too long; had begun to mould his routine around the doctor, so that John was the first thing he saw in the morning and the last thing he saw at night. When silence fell between them, he had begun to feel to urge to fill it with questions, if only to hear John speak. To listen to that familiar voice and find safety within it. To listen to the soft sounds John made when he settled against Sherlock on the sofa, and know that John made that choice of closeness.
By the time John reaches the pub, he is so out of sorts that he almost misses the DI waving him over to a small booth in the back. He sits down and cradles the beer that Greg has already ordered him, at a loss for where to start.
John sighs as he pulls at Greg’s arm a little further down the pathway and out of Sherlock’s field of vision. He’s already prepared himself for the question Greg is about to ask once they stop walking again.
The chest is pressed in, then released by an invisible force. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Compressions that cause the same cracking noises from before. Then it’s gone. There’s a twitch of the lips of Sherlock’s mouth as air is pushed in by that same unknown source. The breaths fight against the resistance of lungs that no longer can hold anything made to survive on their own.
“Sherlock,” She began, then paused until Sherlock caught her eye once more. He was startled by her calling him his first name, and it unsettled him slightly. “Are you aware of the difference between romantic and sexual attraction?”
When he turned five his parents decided to plan a birthday party without telling him. A total of thirteen boys had jumped out from numerous and —
“Most people do it, I don’t understand the issue.” John had never made an effort to hide his previous partners; they practically paraded around the kitchen in their underwear. Why was this any different?
Hank Pillet, much to John's surprise, had also been a forensic scientist out in Boston. While not exactly local, the number of forensic scientists in John's life had just increased by two. Unable to quell the protector that lurked inside him, John swapped back to the tab with Twitter still open and hit 'Tweet'.
He runs out of pavement, and suddenly the door looms in front of him, the black gloss shining in the evening lamplight. John curls and uncurls his hands, pushing away the growing trepidation in his stomach. This was a mistake, he shouldn’t have come here, this is only going to end in flames and —
A knock on his front door was a rare thing nowadays. Most people who took the energy to know his home address rarely ever came around anymore. Not unless they wanted their eyes bombarded with cryptic notes until they found an excuse to leave. Only the like-minded or masochistic would be knocking even louder now. Yet apparently John Watson's insistence was enough to get Anderson allowing him in and apologetically pushing his latest theory of bungee cord and a rubber mask of Moriarty's face off of the other kitchen chair. The scraps of paper clung onto the bottom of the doctor's Loake oxford shoes. The expensive leather of them battling the contrast casualness of rigid dark blue jeans and cable knit jumper.
“Says the man who takes bullwhips to corpses. You can hardly comment on the craziness of others,” John chuckled. “Lestrade just wants to make sure that all the bases are covered. Not all of us can be geniuses, yeah?”
It was May 12th when Martha heard it. The sudden gasp from the kitchen as she made her way back in with some knitting to pass the time. John wasn’t supposed to look like that anymore. Pale-faced and eyes round and slightly glossy as he stared at an opened page of the scarlet colored book she had offered this time around. An unassuming smaller volume of some unknown origin that had been dogeared within an inch of its life. It shook in John’s grip as if it was sentient and incredibly afraid.
A gentle squeeze of John’s hand, and then it’s gone. The music of the club cranks up as a power ballad vibrates through the speakers and the moment they shared is now floating through the air like new lyrics to a song only Sherlock can hear. Why has he only learnt all of this now? On the final nights of John being single?
“Did Sherlock get a new lead with the case? Must be a good one if you’re calling me up instead of him texting. What you got for me?”
He made a breathy noise at the first touch of John’s lips around him. Sherlock never expected John to be a tentative lover. He had witnessed the many conquests of ‘Three Continents Watson’ slink out of the flat the following morning. Most of them were still pink-faced from the previous night’s activities, but nevertheless full of a deep-rooted satisfaction that Sherlock had only fantasised he would ever experience firsthand.
A horn honks inches away from Sherlock’s ear. It appears that walking out into traffic when only focused on John Watson is a bit not good. A firm grip on his arm pulls him back onto the pavement, and he stumbles, tripping over the curb, almost ending up sprawled face-first on the asphalt. He instinctively grabs at John, who wraps an arm around his waist to steady him.
