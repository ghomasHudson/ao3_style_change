As time went by, there were fewer tears and more kisses. As time went by, John began to think that maybe it might be possible to live happily again. He began to return Mary’s laughter with smiles. One day he startled himself by laughing, which made
“Please,” muttered John under his breath. Sherlock didn’t seem to have heard him, but Molly shot him an amused look.
The forest that rose on the other side was bridge was dark and deep, the road a mere track that ran between the trees.  No wind blew there, no birds sang, no small animals scampered among the fallen leaves and branches.  It was so silent that Ivan found himself straining to hear
The shirt provided was short enough that it would have surely left a strip of bare skin above Sherlock’s trousers. On John, it fit nicely in terms of length but was uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and chest.  After a cursory glance around the living room and kitchen to see if he could spot one of his jumpers, he resigned himself to the situation and opened the door to admit...  Dr Campbell-Williams.
There had been questions as to the wisdom of returning Eurus to Sherrinford but in the end, where else were they to put her?  Killing her or physically maiming her so that she’d be incapable of escaping were right out.  Both their parents and Sherlock had made that clear.
“John,” said Sherlock from the doorway. John wondered how long he’d been standing there. “We’re leaving now.”
Sherlock grinned.  Ivan found himself grinning back, trying to keep from breaking into laughter.  We’re insane, he thought, both of us.
“She left ‘em all behind, Vanya,” Harrieta had slurred.  “Might as well use ‘em for food and lodging along the way.  Get ‘em out of my sight.”
“You wouldn’t want me as the third in your marriage, of course. I’d be too close, see too much. In fact, all but the most stupid and unobservant betas would have represented a risk to someone like you who has so much to hide. Too bad stupid’s not John’s type.”
putting our names in the reservation records. We’ll be far more comfortable spending the night on our own.”
“Or you can save everyone time and trouble by listening now.”  The man began to walk towards John.  “Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars.  When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield.”
“Generally speaking, no. But there’s an additional factor that you may not have considered.”  Even in the dark, John could tell that Sherlock had sat up a little straighter at that, affronted.  “Having sex with someone who’s merely ‘tolerating’ what we do together, even if they’re not taking drugs to do so – that’s just not on for me, Sherlock.  Part of what I enjoy is getting the other person to enjoy themselves.”
There was no mistaking the note of approval and respect in Sherlock’s voice. John grinned a little and couldn’t resist asking.  “One of your childhood heroes?”
“Very good, John. She earned her doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and shortly after married David Wentworth, who’d just published a best-selling novel.  Unfortunately, his later novels failed to achieve the same success.  Five years ago, Campbell-Williams returned to the UK.  Less than two years later, Wentworth began to be seen frequently in the company of up-and-coming photographer Cheyenne Paul.”
think about it, he’d discovered that Sherlock tasted like tiramisu and coffee with an undercurrent of wine and garlic and then under
“I thought there might be security guards, so I was trying to get Uncle Don to be quiet and I was trying to get him to
Ivan started to say yes, of course, but something made him stop and think.  He had been happy as a child, playing with Harrieta under their nursemaids’ watchful eyes.  He had been happy as a youth – he’d enjoyed his studies and done well at them.  He had been happy to dance at his sister’s wedding, even happier to leave court for the army.  He’d been happy with his men amidst the southern mountains.
With Sherlock sitting right there, John’s thoughts turned back to their case.  “Sherlock, the cause of death...  I’m assuming you’re thinking something airborne?  Because of the particulates in the nasal passages?”
Sherlock had turned his own chair to face to sofa and installed Mary in it. John felt a flash of resentment until he realized that Sherlock intended John to join him on the sofa, sitting side by side. He set the tray down, sat close enough to Sherlock that their knees touched and passed the tea around.
John found the display amusing but decided that a change of subject was in order.  “Is Cromwell Hospital new?  I haven’t heard of it before.”
“If I’d notified the police, they would send a crowd of soi-disant ‘undercover’ officers who’d look exactly like police officers pretending to be pub customers.  They’d spook the killer, who’d be all that much harder to establish contact with a second time.”
“Which is why no amarsupial species is known to pair-bond,” added Sherlock. “What was the fight about, John?”
John frowned.  “He missed the first one.  The killer had to try again.  Were you able to print the posts?”
“Female silver-bands. Exclusively.  And in any case,” Sherlock shrugged, “The outcome would have been the same.  I would still have faked my death in order to protect you.  I will
“Is Molly strictly bent? Or might she be interested in swerving? It was fairly clear that she and Tom weren’t going to last long.”
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, and your horse will be useless to us.”  With that the creature – Sherlock – grabbed Ivan’s arm, pulled him up and against Sherlock’s body and then spread its wings and leapt into the sky, leaving behind the jug, the remaining pastries and Ivan’s walking stick.
A short flight to the top of a tall oak gained them perches among the swaying branches.  It was not, Ivan told himself, not
me to confront Mary? Had she been working off some plan of her own from the first? Was she trying to double-cross Mary or did she truly not know Mary’s plan? And what about the security guard?”
Maybe he ought to start up his blog again. Writing up the details of the case might help him get it out of his system.  Except, no, this particular case couldn’t be posted.  It wouldn’t be fair to Tyler.  Or to
“Not necessarily. It depends on her areas of interest.  Her work in the States should tell us something.”
John was lying awake in Sherlock’s bed, still sweating from his nightmare.  Outside the room, someone was playing a lullaby on the violin.  Playing rather well, too, John realized.  Eventually his breathing slowed and he drifted back to sleep.
“Possible, but not probable,” replied Sherlock coolly. “You should have at least another week, maybe two.”
and then claim it’s all to protect me! Did it ever occur to you that protection goes both ways? Caring goes both ways. That’s how relationships
“Just so, dear.  After that I thought Boris might calm down a bit, but the truth was that he wasn’t prospering in London, not as he had hoped.  Finally he decided that we should return to his home town, Tsvetovsk.  He wanted me to sell the house on Baker Street, but I refused and instead arranged for my friend Marie Turner to manage it in my absence.”
“Whatever you’ve been telling me, I haven’t been here to hear it,” he informed Sherlock as he brought the bags into the kitchen and started trying to find non-toxic locations to store the groceries. “I’ve been gone almost...”
“Well, there’s a difference between clutter and squalor.” And then, as John continued to stare, “Use the keys, John.  At least think about it.  Even if it’s just for a few nights.”
“Nom de dieu!” For the first time in the conversation, Foucault seemed to have heard something he didn’t already know.  “He has been tracking me all these years?”
Red, gold, blue and black.  The only magic left in Ivan’s life now that Sherlock was gone.  He’d got along perfectly without magic before he met Sherlock, of course.  Maybe he should just give the feathers to Marfa Hudovna as a sort of condolence gift.
John shut his eyes. When he still opened them, he was still standing in 221B Baker Street.  “Sherlock, you can’t just move people’s things...”
John, who’d always sort of assumed that Sherlock had supported himself on the streets by doing sex-work, felt his face heating. Trying to cover his embarrassment, he blurted, “That’s why you’re so good at picking pockets.  Not to mention locks, you’re good at those too.”
come down off that ridiculous chair.  Or are you keeping your distance to try and hide the fact that the large ruby at the front of your crown isn’t really a ruby at all but a mere spinel?”
Sherlock’s black maternity trousers turned out to look exactly like his regular black trousers, just with a bit more room in the waist and stomach. He alternated between preening and sulking. When he did the former, John assured him that he looked amazing. When he did the latter, John assured him that he didn’t look any different at all.
The set now resided in Billy and Archie’s room, where the boys lived in hope that they’d be able to get it working someday and thus no longer have to share a set with the female members of the household.
“I need to review the terms of my trust. I deleted the bits about what happens if I marry and have children. Or just have a child.”
“Appreciation!  Applause!”  Grinning, Sherlock emphasized his words with sweeps of his long arms.  One hand still held a scalpel with bits of liver on it.  “At long last the spotlight.  That’s the frailty of genius, John: it needs an audience.”
Sherlock levered himself to his knees and looked invitingly over his shoulder. “You could...?” He gave his bum a wriggle for completely unnecessary emphasis.
John sat alone in the bright flat, which was still almost clean at that point despite the days of Mary’s absence. He didn’t think about Mycroft providing identification for a woman Mycroft had met exactly twice, once at his parent’s house for Christmas and once, briefly, on an airstrip.  John didn’t think about whether or not it had been Mycroft’s people who’d taken Mary down in the end.  It didn’t matter.  It was always going to happen.  John had just never thought about it, and he wasn’t going to start now.
times? But they’d arrived at the hospital and were heading for Sherlock’s room. John opened the door to discover...
“But that’s too long ago to be the reason you’ve accepted the government’s invitation to return to the UBR.  No, you’ve experienced a more recent... loss.  Personal loss.  Not a spouse though.”
John set aside the takeout containers and looked Sherlock in the eye and licked his lips. “Sherlock, I only have one love interest now. And he’s not a nurse.”
Well, the hell with Sherlock. John would be fine. He just needed... a drink? Maybe not. Some tea. He’d make some tea.
The stranger looked more interested than intimidated.  “I play the violin when I’m thinking, and I spend the night thinking more often than sleeping.  There’s a bed in the bedroom.  I suggest you use it.”
“It’s Wednesday. Mary has yoga class Wednesday afternoons.” And then, on an unhappy thought, “Or what she’s always claimed is yoga class, anyway.”
“Or trying to, which at least puts you ahead of most of your team. John, you’re finally here. Took you long enough. Look at his toe.”
“No, not from Baker Street. From 22 Craven Hill Gardens. The 999 operator was annoyed because it wasn’t really an emergency. The caller apparently felt an urgent need to report that someone was projecting a large photo of Marilyn Monroe on the buildings across the street. By the time we got someone out there, the projection was gone. The caller – fellow in his mid 80s – was quite stubborn about his identification. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Said he’d know her anywhere. Then again, he’d apparently had a bit to drink.”
“But look, having gone to all this trouble to get away with the murders, why would the killer contact you and give himself away?”
“Finally Uncle Don started to calm down a bit, or maybe just get tired. I remembered the protesters on the telly, so I took some markers and wrote slogans from their signs on the walls.  I thought maybe the scientists would think that protesters had smashed up the lab.  Then I got Uncle Don out of there.  We got out of the building without anyone seeing us, but Uncle Don...  He was breathing funny.  I wanted to call a taxi, but I didn’t have any money and Uncle Don had come out without his wallet, so we just kept walking.  We were going past an alley, and Uncle Don turned off the street.  He said he had to lie down, that he was dizzy and his chest hurt.  He just sort of
For the first time in the conversation, Harry cracked a ghost of a smile. “Oh, there’s plenty of ways to do that, trust me.  Are you having trouble, little brother?  Maybe I should give you Tim’s number.  But I thought your mad flatmate had taken you back?”
Sherlock snatched up his dressing gown and flew out the bedroom door.  John paused only to pull his jeans on over his boxers, tuck his gun into the waistband and pull his shirt over the gun.  Then he followed.  He was just in time to find Sherlock confronting a trio of strange men, with an anxious Mrs Hudson behind them.
“I wouldn’t take that bet and neither should you, Archie,” Mrs Hudson said firmly as she went to answer the door.  “Not while Billy’s sitting facing the mirror that reflects everyone and everything going by on the street.”
Perched on the rear seat were two plastic shopping bags, one with a loaf of bread sticking out of the top.  John stared at them a moment, then got in.
“As bent as my sister, I’m afraid. The only time I’ve known her to show interest in anyone on the alpha/omega spectrum, it was an alpha disguising himself with beta body wash.”
Greg’s laughter followed John on his way up to the bar, where he collected two more pints – and then almost dropped them as he turned and found the dark-haired woman waiting for him.
Whatever reply John might have made was forestalled by a rich baritone voice behind him.  “You didn’t rebuild your business on your own.  You’ve got a partner, technically an equal partner but in fact he plays a dominant role, which you resent.  You don’t dare say anything, particularly as in recent years the business hasn’t been doing as well as it used to.  Your wife’s ill.  You used that as an excuse to leave the office early today, but instead of going home you’re here.  In fact, you arranged to meet someone here.  Not for sexual or romantic purposes.  You haven’t made any effort to improve your appearance, although to be honest, that’s something of a lost cause.  It’s the wrong neighbour for a business-related meeting.  So why
“And make him so incredibly uncomfortable that he may never feel easy around us again? You’ve said it yourself. The whole thing just isn’t his area.” She kissed his nose. “I’m sorry, darling. You’ve obviously been thinking about this for a while. I wish I’d known. Maybe
John collected the containers from the floor. Nothing had spilt. He shoved them all into the refrigerator, shoving aside experiments to make room. He’d sort it out later.
“By the morning of Victor’s birthday, I had the results I needed. I cleaned up the lab, returned the rats and then took my supply of the modified drug back to my room, where I attached a note to Victor suggesting that we try it together that evening.  I took the package to his room, but he’d already left for classes.  I slipped it under his pillow and went on to my own classes.”
John hummed to himself as he tackled the washing-up, then considered the contents of the refrigerator.
John’s mobile trilled. “Hello?  Yes, Suzanne, I’m...  Oh, hell, I had no idea it was that late.  I’ll be right there.”  He tucked the mobile away.  “Harry, I have to get back to work.  Look, stay in touch.  Here’s my mobile number.  Keep me posted on... things.  Your tattoo.  And... everything.”
Sherlock was laying out supplies and equipment. Box of nitrile gloves, medium. Box of nitrile gloves, extra large. Hand sanitizer. Scale. Measuring tape. Notebook and pen. Phone. Leather strap.
John checked (again) to make sure they’d brought the bag with the Christmas gifts. “Sherlock, if you hadn’t wanted us to go, you would have simply told Mycroft ‘no.’ Instead you flung yourself over every piece of furniture in the flat...”
bedroom. But the bed upstairs is the smaller one, so we’re going to swap beds. We can tell Mrs Hudson we did it so she’d be less bothered by the noise, she’ll like that.”
“So you thought you’d ‘put them to use’ first, try using them to help you against Muircheartaigh?”  Ivan regretted his accusatory phrasing as soon as the words were out of his mouth.
“Boring,” said the creature with a shrug.  It put the walking stick down and ruffled its wings as if in preparation for flight.
John felt a bit sorry for her, but mostly he felt warm all over and somehow lighter. “I’ve seen some strange things, practicing combat medicine,” he said gently. “I’ve seen some even stranger ones since then. I don’t believe in miracles either. I just believe in Sherlock Holmes.”
you because when you told me your story, you had the intelligence to tell me everything that was important – and to omit anything that was dull and insignificant.”
Caustlin shook her head to indicate “no” and then took a large sip of the coffee her son had doctored for her – no sugar, just a touch of milk.
I suspected Muircheartaigh of the murders.  I needed more information to confirm my suspicions.  When I had it, I informed my brother, who sent guards to assist me in arresting the sorcerer.”
When he arrived in the kitchen, Marfa Hudovna looked him over and nodded.  Then she reached around her neck and pulled something over her head – a cord from which was strung a wooden frame with a handle, holding a round piece of clear glass.  She handed this to Ivan, indicating that he should put it around his own neck.
“Really?  I thought it was a big improvement.  Your mouth’s too small now.”  Sherlock took a sip of coffee.  “Can I see the samp...”
However, when the phone rang a moment later, Sherlock frowned and muttered, “He knows I prefer to text.”
“Well, of course...” John began – and then stopped, because the next words were going to be “you’re here.”
“Of course,” said Mrs Holmes composedly, “Timothy and I have our own reasons for wanting to see Mary Morstan out of the UK. And she’d better not return. Sherlock, be a dear and play for us. It’s been so long since I’ve heard you perform.”
John blinked. The pen drive? He couldn’t even remember the last time he’d seen it or where it might be.
A silence followed, broken when Svinarnikov contributed, “My lord’s family was haunted by the spectre of a gigantic hound.  It was said that Sherlock Holmes would know how to break the curse, so I volunteered to seek him.  But I never saw the creature before the day Muircheartaigh’s spell was broken.”
“Fine then, try this.  I’m looking for someone of royal or at least noble blood to marry.  I suspect my father would prefer a princess but really, a prince would do just as...”
“Girlfriend?  No, not really my area.  Look at this.  Two previous similar cases.  Both corpses had particulate matter in their nostrils.  Molly, can I see the actual samples...  Where’s Molly?”
Mary stood, glanced at the door. Hesitated. Sherlock stood as well, and since this left John’s side feeling chilled, so did he.
“Hey, that’s not what I’m upset about.” John sat up as well, taking Sherlock’s wrist and tracing the line of Sherlock’s wristband with one hand.  “I
-brother,” said Sherlock with a grin.  “Her Majesty my mother was notably adventurous when she was younger.  My firebird form comes to me from my father by right of birth.”
“These walls aren’t soundproof, John. Janine was in the bedroom while Mycroft and I were bellowing Magnussen’s name back and forth. The familiar name would have caught her ear, but she never asked why we were discussing her employer at such volume.”

As John sat on the sofa with takeout cartons for company, watching Sherlock assiduously scribble notes on beekeeping technique every time the film touched on this topic, he reflected that he might have chosen the film
John would work something out.  One thing was certain: as long as Sherlock wanted him at Baker Street, he wasn’t leaving.
They flew on and on. The green sea gave way to blue, and Ivan caught the faint scent of salt.  Then they were flying over another forest again.  A dark bulk appeared on the horizon.  As they grew closer, Ivan could make out the towers and turrets of a huge castle.  Within the hour they had arrived.  Sherlock landed just far enough away to be out of sight from the castle walls.
“I’m going back to the house,” John replied tersely. “And you’re barely a week out of hospital, so you’re staying here.”
John frowned. “Practical results as in, practical for people wanting to change their band colour?  They’ve done all the testing required for that?  Because I think I would have seen something about it in the medical journals.”
“We weren’t junkies, we were university students who used cocaine. Our families eventually agreed to let us marry after – and only if – we both graduated.  Victor’s grades improved considerably after that.”
Ivan turned to take one last look at the remains of the tower.  “You’re better off without him,” said Tyuleneva behind him.  “You’d’ve found that out for yourself, sooner or later.”
“And I think it’s shameful that you should have to hide and make excuses. You don’t have to do that with me.”
John fielded a decent supper of baked chicken, jacket potatoes and a green salad. He took it as a compliment when Mrs Holmes exclaimed, “Thank god, at least one of you can cook!” She also made Sherlock help her wash up afterwards.
“Exactly my point,” said Sherlock drily. He fiddled some more, and the photo changed.  “This is Campbell-Williams attending a conference at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg last year.”
Sherlock shrugged. “The papers were highly informative.  I was impressed with the logic and clarity of Dobrieuzi’s deductions.  Also,” Sherlock’s eyes took on a sly glint, “my parents were not my only source.”
Then the portly man began to read from his clipboard.  “Newcastle.  Abrams, Atkinson, Barton, Brennan, Catherwood, Charles, Cole.  Please board the Newcastle bus.”
It was fairly late by the time they arrived at 221B. Sherlock was in the lead as they walked up the stairs. He opened the door to the flat, stepped in – and stopped, looking about him with an air of focussed observation that reminded John of... crime scenes.
“I thought we’d made progress on disabusing you of that notion.” Sherlock’s voice oozed out in its lowest register as he stepped up to Dexter, placed his hands on the alpha’s shoulders and drew him in for a kiss. The first kiss was almost chaste. The second, far less so. By the third, Dexter had gotten up the nerve to place both hands around Sherlock’s waist – and then reach down a bit to squeeze Sherlock’s absurdly luxurious bum.
John was grinning, and Sherlock grinned back. He took another breath and went for a second pirouette, but this time his toe caught something on the sidewalk and he stumbled. John caught him without thinking – and then found himself holding an armful of warm Sherlock, chest-to-chest. Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed with exertion and his eyes were wide. They stared at each other.
Sherlock took another deep breath in through his nose.  “Quite clear.  And is your wife away for long?”
work and often as not he’s able to put them back together as well.  Between us, we managed well enough.  You should have seen him flying about the roof, patching the holes and cleaning out the gutters!”
“That’s not the same thing, Sherlock! I had an opening to grab Moriarty, I took it. There wasn’t enough time to explain.”
“Watson, get down!”  Was that Murray?  But John needed to save the man who’d been shot, except the man was Mary, except that Mary had curly, dark hair and she was so young and he needed to save him and he yelled her name, his name, a name...
Sherlock finally deigned to look up from the microscope.  “I know.  I put it there.”  Then he went back to his slides.
“You need some sleep, Sherlock, and I don’t mean on the sofa.  Take the bed.  I’ll fit better on the sofa than you will anyway.”
He called for help again.  Misha Kamen’brodsky showed up, but he just shook his head.  “I told you to listen to her, Vanya Stolitsky.”  He too vanished.
Sherlock leant down slightly, tilted John’s chin up just a bit and kissed him on the mouth, a brief, sweet press of lips that was over almost as soon as it started.
“Neither did Sherlock – until he got personally involved in the process of reproduction,” Mary teased. And then when Sherlock glared at her, “For which I am extremely grateful, Sherlock. I know this isn’t... what you’d planned.”
“Fill it with fresh water. Don’t use the water that’s already boiled,” ordered Sherlock, already hunting for a laptop in the living room.
There was a bad moment when John thought he might not be able to swallow and might have to spit it out on the carpet instead, but he managed. Sherlock looked... destroyed.  Sprawled back against the sofa, eyes shut, drawing deep, harsh breaths.  Destroyed, magnificent and
“I’m sure it has, dear,” said Marfa Hudovna, with a smile that led Ivan to suspect that she might actually know very well.
John made three mugs of tea. He set one down next to Sherlock, who roused enough to blink at John muzzily.
Then the clatter of ceramic against wood, followed by, “Oh, hell! I’m sorry, oh god, it’s dripping onto the floor, I’m sorry...” Dexter sounded as if he were about to cry.
“I passed them all and then found out they’d been set by a freak just like the ones being born back in my village, except maybe a bit fairer to look at.”
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock’s voice was so soft that it was almost a baritone whisper.  He didn’t move away, neither when John sat down next to him on the sofa nor when, after a moment’s hesitation, John slipped an arm around his shoulders.
The driver and the concierge glared at each other.  Finally the driver barked at John, “Get back on the bus!”
“It was Tuesday. I made us beans on toast for supper and we were watching telly, and suddenly Uncle Don stood up and said he was going to visit someone he used to know.  He was set on it, put on his jacket and everything.  So I figured the best thing to do was to lock up the flat and go with him.”
“You might want to confirm that with Mrs Hudson before you go any further. Remember the time you used my gun to ‘modify’ the wall?”
Which was at least better than having it sitting in the bin, although the ethics of using a teenager to deliver body parts was debatable.  John opened the refrigerator and discovered it to be almost completely empty except for a plastic container.  He picked up the container just as Sherlock added, “She sent back a pair of diseased livers.”
“I... I thought of that.  It wasn’t the only thing I was thinking of, but that was one of the things.  It was... confusing.  Complicated, like.”
“This will need more tools than I have here.  Take it upstairs.”  With that Sherlock thrust the case at Ivan.
Having said this, Sherlock looked straight ahead down the street for the next several steps. John thought he understood.
Curran, sullenly silent, had already been cuffed, but Wentworth was considerably less sanguine than the experienced criminals.
a black band so people would leave him alone and he wouldn’t have to worry about...  What’s he call it?”
As the imperial forces licked their wounds, doctors fought to save the tsarevich’s life.  His wounded shoulder became inflamed and feverish.  In his delirium, he cried out over and over from the pain in his leg, but the bone was whole and the doctors could find no injury.  When Ivan’s fever finally broke and his shoulder appeared to be healing cleanly, the doctors declared that they had done all that could be done in a field hospital.  The tsarevich was still too weak to ride, so his men constructed a litter.  Uilleam an t-Moireach chose six others to accompany him in bringing the tsarevich home, and they began the long journey north.
Sherlock’s voice was bitter and angry.  It almost sounded as he were angry at the captives themselves.  But Marfa Hudovna said softly, “It hurt.  It hurt each time.  We instituted tests for those who could pass them.  And we tried to warn the others away.”
The laboratory equipment was familiar but... mismatched.  John was fairly sure he hadn’t seen that particular model of gas chromatograph until he went back to medical school in Canada.  What was it doing here, in the lab he remembered from his university days in Britain?  He heard someone running along the corridor towards the lab and already knew the news they carried: his father was dead.
Relieved to see them go and feeling guilty because of it, John asked, “Will you be all right getting home at this hour? We do have a spare bedroom.”
Sherlock heaved a put-upon sigh.  “BritChat, colloquially referred to as Britchit.  Sometimes the ‘r’ is dropped.  It’s our esteemed Committee’s attempt to foster free expression and personal communication.  Of course all posts must approved by Committee lackeys, which means that it takes at least 24 hours for new posts to appear and they’re edited to remove anything deemed unfavourable to the government.  Still, it has its uses.  People tend to be so concerned with avoiding anything that might draw the government’s wrath that they’re careless about posting things that are incriminating in other ways.”
“Oh!” Sherlock spun and pointed at Mary. “We’ll need to get Mrs Hudson out of the house entirely for the birth. You’re going to scream.”
Instead, he contemplated the man lying next to him.  Sherlock had thrust an illegally-obtained gun into John’s hands.  Sherlock, in lieu of informing Lestrade about his plans, had led John into a situation in which John had killed a man and then lied to Lestrade about it.
“Competent pathologist, reasonably intelligent, occasional flashes of excellence,” replied Sherlock.
Sherlock blinked and then smiled slowly. He lay back so that his head was practically in John’s lap and patted his own chest. “Here,” he said, and John could have happily drowned in the depths of his voice. “Sit here. Now lean forward.”
“’Mummy’ looked as if she were going to leap over the breakfast table and stab me with a butter knife.  Either that or poison my tea.”
“Mr Holmes, Dr Watson. Please come in, be seated.”  Foucault was a soft-spoken man, his French accent worn thin after years in the UK.  His office was chock full of books and papers, but very neatly kept.  The only personal touches were a brightly coloured mug and a small, framed photo on his desk.
The man raised an eyebrow.  “Really.  You need to choose a side, Dr Watson, and you need to do so soon.”
“I assure you,” Sherlock said haughtily, “My disguise will be impenetrable.”  After which he swooped back up to his perch and appeared to sulk.  He at least took the pastry with him, so Ivan didn’t count the conversation as a total loss.
“Dunno. Hard to be sure when we’re both almost fully dressed.” John ran one hand along the edge of Sherlock’s shirt, following it down past his chest to where it still hid his lower torso.
“It’s unfortunate that by the time the police arrived, several of the customers in the pub had been down the alley.  Some had even gone down the stairs and out onto the beach, no doubt fancying themselves amateur detectives.”
A nearby police siren broke the moment. The two men separated and began to walk again. Something occurred to John.
“No, but she is a relative newcomer to this university, and I am the senior researcher on this project. It is, as you say, my call.”
“You’re like me then.  We’ve both done what we needed to do.”  John raised the glass of mineral water he’d chosen in lieu of wine.  “Here’s to survival.”
Ah.  As clumsy as a youth of fifteen with his first lover.  When Sherlock started to draw back, Ivan placed his hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck, feeling those curls brush against his knuckles, and tugged forward once, gently, prepared to release Sherlock immediately if the hint was not taken.  But Sherlock bent his mouth to Ivan’s again quite willingly and just as willingly let Ivan guide the kiss, slotting their lips together.
“Pale skin, dark hair, blue eyes, cheekbones? No? That’s odd. She told me to remind Sherlock that she wants to have dinner with him.”
Harrieta had not been seen to be sober since.  It was open talk in the streets of the capital that perhaps the end had come to the imperial line, since there was now no one qualified to rule.
“And yet it doesn’t seem to have occurred to you that home pregnancy tests can give false negatives even at two weeks.”
That sounded promising. “Can I swap, well, can the SIM card from my old phone be swapped into this one?”
Six and a half hours after Mary thumped on the ceiling, she asked, “What have you two come up with for names?”
“Whatever exit you’d planned for us,” said Ivan, gasping for breath in the heat, “I hope it was up this way, because I don’t think we’re getting down again!”
John relaxed and nodded. “Yeah, okay. Are William and Scott people you know or just names you like?”
found, but our Sherlock’s not always honest with his pets.  Would you believe, he even convinced some of them that
“One more question, Dr Campbell-Williams. You described your ex-husband as ‘not the threatening type,’ yet his phone call unnerved you sufficiently to seek my assistance.”
When the creature spoke, however, it was to say, “And what is it you expect me to do about this curse?  I am no sorcerer, to lift it for you by magic alone.  There will be risk and danger involved.”
“Ms Caustlin, I can release Tyler to you on bail. If you’ll excuse me while I get the forms...”  Lestrade stepped out of the room, and Sherlock followed him.  Through the open doorway, John could see them discussing something in the corridor.  John stood up himself, stretching a bit.
“It was inevitable, I suppose. My pouch is accumulating more insulation to keep the child warm, the lining is getting ready to exude aerosols to help it breathe and my teats are swelling. Which is all fine but soon none of my trousers will fit!”
Within moments, Sherlock and Molly were completely focused on a large microscope, arguing over similarities – many, apparently – and differences between the particulate matter found in Molly’s corpses’ nostrils and that found in Sherlock’s.  Both appeared to have forgotten John entirely, so it was a something of a relief when Mike reappeared at the door with another man in tow.
“Ooooh, the great detective makes his deductions!” sneered Anderson.  “We all know it rained yesterday, Freak!”
This wasn’t Mary’s favourite thing to do in bed, but she was good at it. John whimpered slightly when she finally lifted her head again, distracted from his thoughts by a degree of arousal that verged on pain.
When he’d first got the invite to his university class reunion, he’d tried to talk to Sherlock into coming with him.  He had fond memories of certain classmates whom he thought Sherlock might enjoy meeting.  There was, for example, the girl who’d been his lab partner in first-year chemistry, the one who’d repeatedly flummoxed the professor with her perceptive questions.  They’d almost blown up the lab together one time when she threw a few improvisations into a routine – and extremely boring – laboratory exercise.
At which point Ivan finally lost control of the laughter bubbling up within him.  When he caught Sherlock staring at him, he laughed all the harder, until finally Sherlock started to laugh as well.
In John’s dreams that night he walked endless corridors, a maze composed of every hospital, university and government building he’d ever been in.  He kept running into people he recognized – Harry, Molly, Mike, Bill, Lestrade, Umbrella Man, Mrs Hudson.  They all wanted him to stop and chat.  Umbrella Man even offered him money to do so.  But the person John most wanted to speak with was always just ahead, just barely out of sight.  John would have called to them to stop and wait if he could have remembered their name.
The appearance of cases that might distract Sherlock from things apian was almost a relief, although said cases came with their own hazards. There was, for example, the series of corpses left in sewage treatment works along the Thames, beginning with Longreach and moving west. For reasons best known to himself, Sherlock borrowed John’s phone. By the end of the case, Sherlock’s phone was still safe in the pocket of his Belstaff. John’s phone was quite literally in deep shit. Even after being retrieved and thoroughly cleaned, it never worked quite right again.
“What did you live on?” asked Ivan, hoping that Sherlock hadn’t been surviving on carrion like a crow.
“He doesn’t mean it, he just doesn’t think, well, no, that’s not right.  He thinks all the time!  But about corpses and crimes, not things like...”
“So we have... what? A celibate biochemist.  A physicist who talks out of turn when she’s had a few and who has an ex-husband who’s dating a fit-looking photographer and who hasn’t published a successful book in years.  Threatening messages and a vandalized lab.  The bloke who apparently did the vandalism died of a heart attack shortly afterwards.  We don’t know who he is because a younger fellow took his wallet, called 999 and fled.”
There was no milk in Sherlock’s flat, of course. Some things never change. John went down to Mrs Hudson’s to see if he might borrow some, only to discover Bill Wiggins sitting at her table with tea and toast in front of him and a small duffle bag at his feet.
“Only if you believe the unsubstantiated and highly unlikely theory that each person has only one so-called ‘soulmate’ rather than the more likely theory that the chromochemistry of the epidermis around your dominant wrist will respond to anyone who possesses the necessary traits and that it’s the mutuality of the high potential for change that triggers the actual reaction.”
After that their relationship began to regain something like its old ease. Sherlock started texting John during working hours to ask him his medical opinion on this or that.  Then the texts began arriving with lurid photos attached.
Had Umbrella Man scared them all off?  Unlikely.  Any number of potential flatmates would have jumped at the chance to earn money for information.
To be honest, what Ivan himself wanted was neither.  He’d been happy as a soldier and had never sought the throne.  Court life suffocated him.  But he would do what his family and his country needed of him, which was to marry so that he could ascend the throne.  He thought he would not mind being married so much, except that settling down to rule afterwards was the implicit and an inescapable goal of marriage.  He couldn’t tell Marfa Hudovna any of this, of course.
“I’m sorry, I know you and he were... very close,” Sara apologized.  Before Ivan could correct her, she went on.  “But I’d never seen him before he landed almost on top of me, demanding to know where you were.  Then he got angry at me for ‘allowing’ you to ‘run off’ and insisted I help him burn down the keep to make up for it.  He...  He must have cared for you a great deal,” she finished more gently.
“Damn right I did!  I made the journey and passed all his stupid tests, the rye field, the well, the pile of wood.”  She shot a sideways glance at Ivan.  “You
“I’ve had enough of nurses, thanks.”  John kept his tone dry and couldn’t help feeling meanly pleased when the realization of what Bill had said played out across Bill’s face.  But then he felt ashamed.  Bill was a good guy.  He’d been with John from the very start of this.
John ran back up the stairs. Mary was still standing inside the flat, watching at the door. John ignored her as he dialed Lestrade. “Hello, Greg?”
“That would be the two constables I sent to look for the bloke’s wallet. After the ambulance arrived at St Bart’s, it was discovered that he had no wallet, no ID of any kind, not even keys.  His fingerprints don’t match anything we have on record, and he’s had almost no dental work done.”
“Precisely.  You were... interesting.  Travelling with you was interesting.  Where others had been afraid or angry, you were amazed.  Fighting beside you was...  If heroes exist, Ivan Watovich, you might well be one of them.”  Sherlock was still not smiling, but his earlier bitterness had passed, replaced by a sort of sombre calm.  He gazed at Ivan as if memorizing Ivan’s features. As if he thought Ivan would be leaving soon.
, John.  I said traits, not genetic traits.  In fact, the hypothesis that genetics are a trigger for chromochemical reactions was disproven some years ago.  Current theory proposes the recognition by the subconscious mind of the presence of key physical and personality traits as the trigger.  Your wristband turned gold for Mary because she was dangerous, reasonably clever and physically attractive and because you possessed her required set of key traits as well.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide in mock dismay. “What happened to ‘the best and wisest man’ that you’ve ever known?”
“Cromwell Hospital,” he told the driver.  And then to John, “New Scotland Yard has all their autopsies done there.”
The guards unlocked the gates and dragged one open, bowing mockingly to Ivan.  “Welcome, both to you and your little friend!” said Mustachios with a wave at Ivan’s shoulder.
It was entirely possible that, despite Umbrella Man’s warnings, the life John had found was a far better fit than the life he’d expected.
“Ms Caustlin,” Lestrade began after Molly had left, “Due to the circumstances in which your uncle was found, we’re going to have to ask you some questions. If you prefer, we can wait until later and you can come down to New Scotland Yard?”
“Of course not. The hives would have to go on the roof. Hmmm, we’ll need to modify the roof for easier access. I’m sure Mrs Hudson won’t mind provided we give her some of the honey.”
“I’m a skilled and experienced assassin, Sherlock. I think I can manage to keep from screaming despite a few cramps.”
John opened his eyes.  There were, in fact, two things holding him down.  He still lay mostly at one side of the bed.  Sherlock, on the other hand, had invaded the centre during the night and was now sprawled out over a surprisingly large area, with one arm and one leg (each rather long) flung out over John.
“She, uh...”  Billy glanced at the closed door, leaned in closer to Lestrade and lowered his voice.  “She don’t always remember to pull the curtains when she gets dressed in the morning.”
Sherlock glanced pointedly at the empty spot where John’s chair had once stood and raised an eloquent eyebrow.
It was clear that the company was going no further that day, so they camped a second night in the same place.  When they ate supper, Sara went to the grave and set some bread and an apple down on a kerchief next to the grieving woman, but it seemed doubtful that she would eat.
“A long time. Uncle Don explained that Dr Fooko was one of the scientists who worked on bonds and didn’t know what he was doing and that he – Uncle Don, I mean – had some stuff he wanted to explain to him, to the doctor.  Then he kind of dozed off for a bit.  I thought maybe when he woke up, he would have changed his mind or maybe just forgot and we could go home.  But he didn’t.  When we came out, there was no one else around.  We took the lift up.  Uncle Don tried a couple of doors and started to get angry when they were locked, but then he found one that was open.  It was a lab, lots of stuff around, but no people.  That seemed to make Uncle Don angrier, he started talking about people hiding and then he started yelling.  I was... I was scared.”  Tyler said this almost defiantly, as if daring anyone to mock his fear.  No one did.
“Couldn’t get the arm past the Yarders,” replied Sherlock matter-of-factly. “Left-handed, fairly skilled, access to professional equipment and currently operating in London. Any ideas?”
idea.  The sex was consensual and the cocaine was, as I mentioned previously, enjoyable for us both.
“Yes. Well. Come here.” John sank down into his armchair, pulling Sherlock into his lap as he went. It should have been awkward, but tall, bony Sherlock curled around John as if he’d been designed to fit there. His neck was at just the right height for John to nose. When John nipped where he’d been nosing, Sherlock gasped.
situations.  He also asserted that the so-called learning experience would certainly fail to achieve its stated goal, as having Sherlock’s mouth on his cock would be highly detrimental to his ability to observe, learn or really perform any higher brain functions whatsoever.  Discussion generally dissolved at this point as John proceeded to demonstrate – on Sherlock – just how detrimental even lesser attentions could be.
The eastern sky was beginning to turn from black to purple.  The first hesitant strains of birdsong were rising from the dark forest.  Despite the half-light, Ivan had no trouble making out the stone-lined path. He followed it to the birch grove and looked up to scan the trees, relieved when he spotted the dark shape perched high in the branches.  He hadn’t been sure until that moment that Sherlock would choose to show himself.
“He told me privately that the Yard would be willing to drop the charges entirely if the university was willing as well. I have his card here.  The mobile number will reach him this evening.”
“It sounded as if the violin was, well, flirting with the orchestra. Teasing it, maybe leading it on a bit.”
John bit back an angry retort, looked at the toe and frowned. “That’s not an amputation. It looks more as if the toe’s been... crushed.”
Smoky sipped more coffee as he thought about it. When he finally spoke it was to ask, “Spare a fag?”
“The red feather now,” said Sherlock.  His voice was slightly hoarse and his breath came rapidly, but he shook his head impatiently at Ivan’s look of concern.  “I’m fine, but quickly!  Hold the edges of the incision together with one hand and draw the red feather down along it...  Good.  Again... again...  A third time.”
“We were in this pub and Johnny here manages to drag himself up to a standing position for a trip to the bogs, and this bloke comes weaving along.  High as a kite, anyone could see it.  He comes weaving along and walks right into our Johnny, whom as we all know has just a wee bit of a temper” – more hooting – “so he tells the junky to watch where the fuck he’s going.  And the junky says…”
At the sound of a male voice other than Sherlock’s, he immediately forgot his clothing issues and ran down the stairs.
Eventually John decided that he’d seen enough of Britchit and went back to one of the medical articles.  When he found himself yawning at the screen, he decided it was time to turn in.  He shut the laptop down.
“Mycroft will have had the footage pulled. Mary not only shot me, she also killed Magnussen – and the information Magnussen had could still be dangerous in the wrong hands. Mycroft will want to contain the situation until he’s figured how best to control it.”
“Yeah, she knows. She knows that the man who’s probably her uncle died in an alley of a heart attack and that we couldn’t identify him because his wallet was missing.  That’s
“Oi!” said Lestrade. “Be nice to John or he’ll think twice about taking you places.” He winked broadly at John.
“That could be a long list, mate,” said Lestrade, but John ignored him, kept pacing – and then stopped.
to hit him, but he’d almost broken the man’s nose the night Sherlock returned from the dead. It was time for someone else to have a go, and manhandling corpses had obviously done nice things for Molly’s upper body strength.
Sherlock had pulled another sample bag and a swab out of his coat pocket and was now swabbing one of the corpse’s nostrils.
“You were raised in England, most likely Hampshire, but you’ve spent the last several years in North America.  Not surprising.  Almost all the British soldiers abandoned in Afghanistan during the Revolution were adopted by Canadian or American units and returned to those countries after the war in Afghanistan was deemed over.”
John sighed. “All right, I’m on my way.  Uh, you might want to give Sherlock a chance to shower before he comes in.  It’s been a few days.”
When John came out into the sitting room the next morning, the first thing he spotted was Sherlock asleep on the sofa, his head and shoulders propped against the cushions at one end and his hands folded on his stomach.  He’d changed out of his suit into grey pyjamas and a blue dressing gown.
“You may want to try looking for someone who’s noticeable not for the degree to which they themselves shine but rather as a conductor of light.”
What with one thing and another, by the time Lestrade arrived minutes later John still hadn’t been frisked – which meant that no one had discovered the gun he’d tucked back into his trousers once he’d got hold of Minnie’s.
On a cold, sunny day, the ship sailed into the easternmost seaport of Ivan’s homeland.  As soon as the ship was tied off at the dock, Ivan called on the port master.  Showing the tsar’s signet ring, he asked that a message be sent to the nearest imperial garrison, and this was done.
After that it was bloody fantastic. He kept trying to get more in his mouth, almost choked at one point, pulled off, caught his breath and then dived back in.  He had lost track of time when Sherlock said something sharply urgent, then gave forth an unearthly nasal keen and flooded John’s mouth.
days before with distaste. But unless he wanted to go through Sherlock’s things and try to find something that might fit his shorter, stockier frame, these were the only clothes he had.
“I would have if I could have gotten hold of one at a quarter of three in the morning.  As it was, I had to use your number instead.”
form, thought Ivan, surprised.  Up until now, he’d assumed that Sherlock’s glorious feathers and wings were natural to him.  It was unsettling – and saddening – to learn that this beauty was rooted in an evil curse.  Yet at the same time, Ivan couldn’t help wondering what Sherlock had looked like
“Have a seat if you wish, but you don’t really need that cane.  The pain in your leg is psychosomatic.”
John bit back an angry retort.  Being a member of the Primary Reserve was no game, not that this besuited toff would know anything about it.
He indicated the rest of the graffiti covering the walls of the lab, not equations but political slogans written in blue and green. John recognized a few from the protest signs he’d seen on the telly.
Throwing his covers to one side – “Oi, Sherlock, you almost hit me in the face!” – Sherlock rose from the bed, tall and graceful in his pyjamas as he took a position in the middle of the floor.  He swung both of his arms to the left, took a sharp breath, rose onto his left foot and did a perfect full-circle pirouette.
a ‘legitimate’ job.”  Sherlock was on his feet now and practically spitting the words out.  “I needed anonymity, cocaine and, to some minimal degree, food and shelter.”
“It’ll be one these new drugs that we don’t have tests for yet.  Ever since the Committee cracked down on the opium trade, we’ve been seeing more and more synthetics.  It’s like every petty crime boss in the country’s found himself someone with a half-arsed knowledge of chemistry who’s willing to accept payment in kind.  Your
Their third destination turned out to be a small shop down a side street.  The window was painted to read “Pawnbroker and Jewellery Repair.”  There was a “Closed” sign on the door, and the entirety was festooned in yellow police tape.
Late that night, after a long day sweetly spent, Ivan and Sherlock lay curled together in the bed where Ivan had slept alone the night before.  Marfa Hudovna had been notably careful to assure them that her own room was a good ways off and that she was a sound sleeper.  Sherlock seemed puzzled, but Ivan was thankful.
The result was a surprising amount of fun, especially when Sherlock attempted to retaliate.  Sherlock’s rules were all so complicated that he ended up drawing flowcharts to explain them to John – and even then they didn’t make sense.  When Sherlock’s patience ran out, he crumpled the latest flowchart up into a ball and threw it at John.  John had plenty of ammunition to hand, so he fired back.  It rapidly became apparent that he had superior aim.
“Finally, you brought this one.  Have you even told him your real purpose in coming here?  Or does he really believe that you’ve come solely to assist him?”  The words were still in Ivan’s voice, but the phrasing was off.  Absorbed in his game, Muircheartaigh seemed to have forgot the pretense that the questions were supposedly Ivan’s.
They turned in shortly after that, and Ivan did not think that anyone slept easily that night.  In the morning, however, a strange sight greeted their eyes.  The madwoman sat at the graveside, patting the widow’s arm and bowed head, crooning nonsense to her.  When Sara brought breakfast for the two of them, it was the madwoman who coaxed the widow to eat.  And when the time came to leave, it was the madwoman – crooning and babbling all the while – who pulled the widow to her feet and got her walking.
A middle-aged woman in a cheap housedress and cardigan waited for them with another clipboard.  When she was done calling off names, however, John was still left standing by the bus.
Before John could reply, Sherlock had entered the restaurant.  John followed to see him shaking hands with the apparent owner, a genial, heavyset man with a greying beard and ponytail.
, such a startling sound that Ivan couldn’t resist provoking it again – and again.  He built up a rhythm, alternating strokes and squeezes, running his thumb over plump, weeping tip as Sherlock gasped and shook against him, long fingers clawing at Ivan’s back.
John bristled. “Sherlock’s not window-dressing, Dr Campbell-Williams.  Whatever’s going on here, he’s your best chance of getting to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.”
And he’d done it. Sherlock had reached out past old anger and old pain to tell the entire miserable story from beginning to end, so that John might understand the complications involved in being in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock had laid everything out for John to hear and John...  In the end, it hadn’t been a choice, really.  It had been more like recognition of the place they’d always been heading towards.
“He sets spells to draw them to him.  Some think they’re running to escape a curse.  Others” – Sherlock raised an eyebrow in Ivan’s direction – “think they’re seeking to destroy the sorcerer who cursed them.  But in the end, they’re all drawn into his net.”
“Of course Lestrade will think we named her after the capital of Bulgaria,” Sherlock added – and then looked surprised when first John, then Mary started to laugh.
“Maybe, but he wouldn’t tell me anything,” said John, trying for nonchalance. “You can ask him yourself, though. He’s going to be stuck in a hospital room for at least next few days.”
“If you haven’t got the data backed up somewhere else, you deserve to lose it.” Sherlock ignored the woman’s offended gasp.  “And pro-bonders staging a planned incident of vandalism for purposes of intimidation would have come better prepared, not just scribbled slogans with whatever markers they found lying about and smashed things at random.  Was anything stolen?”
Sherlock smiled slightly.  It didn’t reach his eyes.  “Very good, John.  I haven’t.  They simply didn’t occur.  This was, of course, my brother’s doing.”
“...and you’re not inclined to celibacy, but you returned to the UBR alone.  Balance of probability says that over the course of eight years you’ve lost at least one serious girlfriend or boyfriend, causing the ‘period of stress’ you mentioned.  But no marks on your finger from a wedding ring, not even the hint of a tan line, so, not married.”
“Don’t want her hurt... Won’t be...  Keep her nice and safe...  Our cut...  Georgie’s cut...  Your slate wiped,” recited the tech.
it was and ask how they came to choose that name. And Sherlock, the bastard, would smile and say, it’s his father’s middle name.
done this sort of thing before,” Mary snapped – and then looked suddenly stricken. “Thank you. All of you. John, Sherlock, good luck with... with...”
Raymond Stevens was a greengrocer, probably in his mid-30s although his obvious signs of grief made him look older.  His neatly arranged shop stood next to a lending library.
The traffic the driver had mentioned made itself evident soon enough.  Something John had noticed during the trip from the airfield became more apparent.  Although there were lots of cars, they were small and cheap-looking, nothing like the grand old automobiles that John remembered being owned by anyone who could afford a car in the first place.  Which, to be sure, did not include many people.  John’s uncle had hired a car for the trip to John’s wedding.
“Get into the car, Dr Watson,” the voice replied.  The grim driver opened the rear door and pointedly held it for John.  “I would make some sort of threat, but I’m sure your situation is quite clear to you.”
“Yes.  I know,” John replied a bit ruefully.  Better not to mention that the marriage was arranged, or that he’d been gone for 14 years.  Kinder not to give Molly false hope.
Before John could reply, Sherlock picked up his violin, checked the tuning and began a series of what sounded like exercises. The conversation was obviously over.
Sherlock ignored John as he stepped in close behind his lover, using one hand to push aside the dark curls so he could nose at Sherlock’s neck. John’s other hand reached around to rest on Sherlock’s palpably softer, more padded stomach. Sherlock was stiff and tense against him, but when John began to stroke said stomach and nip gently at the back of that pale neck, Sherlock melted suddenly – and completely.
“Aren’t whales and dolphins supposed to be intelligent? And does anyone want dessert?” asked Mary, pushing herself up to her feet.
John was never quite sure exactly what happened next. By the time the roaring in his ears died down, he was face to face with Donovan, she’d dropped into a defensive stance and both Lestrade
“I am,” agreed Sherlock. “You’re a good man, Dexter McCrae.” And to John’s amazement, he reached out and touched Dexter lightly on one cheek. “Go out and find some other good people.”
Ivan’s sword was ready on his hip, but could plain steel be relied on to kill a sorcerer’s heart?  He let the glass drop and studied Sherlock’s wings, then reached out to trace one deep gold feather to its base.  Grasping the shaft carefully but firmly, he tugged lightly to warn Sherlock of his intentions.
“It’s a break-in with a bare suggestion of robbery, Lestrade. Barely a two...  All right, possibly a three...  Who identified it as a chemical equation?  Your lot don’t have...  All right.
“We need to get out of here, Stolitsky!” a woman screamed in his ear as fragments rained down around them.  “It’s going to collapse!”
“I’ve operated quite well without sexual attentions – including yours – for most of my life,” Sherlock said icily. “I can easily do so again.”
John’s remark led to the revelation that Sherlock had in fact, at one time, owned a working TV set.  He’d taken it apart because he needed to “borrow” some of the components for an experiment.  When put back together, the set had refused to work.
alphas. She cursed the pregnancy kit manufacturer, Sherlock, Wiggins, Magnussen and Janine. The she started cursing people whom John didn’t know and was fairly sure he didn’t want to know, although he suspected Mycroft might have been interested.
The garrison commander turned out to be a veteran of the wars of the southern mountains who knew some of the men Ivan had fought beside.  The most recent news he had from the capital was old but hopeful.  At last report, the nobles had still been holding to their promise to grant Tsar Watt a year and a day.
Another woman fell on bread so ravenously that Svinarnikov had to restrain her from jamming the entire piece into her mouth at once.  She babbled nonsensically and continuously, her mouth open as she chewed.
