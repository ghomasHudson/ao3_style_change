"You've been my guardian angel for a while now, you should know that sex and girls are my only belief" he murmured, almost seductively, quickly shedding the shirt he wore to sleep. He was shirtless now, and at the slightest movement Castiel could see the mighty muscles dart out. He gave him a mischievous look from over his shoulder, before shedding his baggy pants as well, remaining only in his boxers.
He shrugged his shoulders, indifferently, abandoning his reflection and turning his gaze back to the running water. He gripped the toothbrush firmly in his right hand - trying not to imagine something bigger and hotter in its place - and began to brush his teeth vigorously.
"Whatever you want," he murmured, Dean, peeling off his shirt and tossing it absentmindedly. It flew to the bed that had been occupied by his brother that night, and a small, amused smile rippled his lips. But the smile died soon after, when the sight of Castiel's - finally - bare chest caught his attention. Castiel's lean, shapely physique was revealed beneath him, a wonder to his eyes, but even more so to his hands. He slowly felt the hinted curves of the muscles, enjoying the shivers of pleasure that shook his angel. His. He truly understood the meaning of that word, possessive and delicious, when he heard Cas moan at his touch. Feeling him give in under his touch, lowering all the defenses he'd built up at the exact moment he'd realized he was starting to feel something. Feelings, unknown to angels, perfect beings who don't need to feel anything. Warriors, faithful to their God. He slowly explored each patch of skin with his lips, tasting the texture of the silky smooth skin, feeling his lips tingle with the light fluff that littered his otherwise white chest. His hands ran to grasp his wrists, leaving him exposed and helpless beneath him, succumbing to that passion and desire he'd never felt, or imagined. He felt Dean's plump lips seal one of his nipples, squeezing it between his lips and begin to play and abuse it. Moistened by the other man's saliva, it swelled, leaving him breathless and with his mouth open in a stifled moan.
He felt Castiel's teeth brushing against his skin, his warm, wet tongue hugging his own flesh in an erotic gesture. He tightened his grip on the angel's head, thrusting himself into his mouth with a decisive thrust. She held him still, as if afraid he would escape, while he - finally - fucked that wonderful, sinful mouth. He imprecated through clenched teeth as his own member was completely sucked in, Cas's cheeks hollowed, his mouth completely in contact with her turgid flesh.
"You called me," he said, Castiel, with an unflappable calm. His eyes gave him a serious look, as if he were awaiting a particular order. And, God, Dean would have loved to have been giving orders to his beautiful angel. "I'm sorry, I- I didn't mean to call you," he said, simply, shrugging. He walked past the angel figure to the sink and - finally - brushed his teeth. He kept his gaze down, contemplating the water that flowed incessantly, even though he felt Cas' eyes burning his back. He felt his presence, behind him, and had to keep himself at the sink to not assault him and make it his at that very moment, in a motel bathroom, with his brother in the other room. "We need to talk," he sentenced, serious, advancing in his direction and taking a seat at his side. All he had to do to see him was turn his head a few inches to the left, but he didn't feel like laying himself bare like that. He watched his gaze from the mirror - filthy and definitely of low quality - trying not to be at all impressed by his tone.
"Reserve?" he asked, casting a glance at Dean. "Yeah, Cas, you're our backup, you serve to keep us from getting our heads stuck up our asses," Dean exclaimed, exasperated, walking faster than the other two.
"Fuck, Cas, you're so damn tight!" he exclaimed, his head close to the other's ear. She covered him entirely with her body, no one would notice their intimate encounter - Dean wouldn't allow it. "Move, Dean," sighed, Castiel, pressing himself against his partner's body. His legs tight against the other's waist, his arms belted against his neck in an attempt to have him close - inside. He let himself go completely, moaning and groaning under Dean's brutal, arousing thrusts. He dug into her body, sinking deeper and deeper into her flesh as he tried to pull himself together and not scream. If anyone had seen him, Castiel, the dutiful angel, getting fucked in a filthy little alley. Yet Castiel liked it, liked it like crazy. The anger he'd seen in Dean's eyes in the bar earlier, and out there shortly thereafter, had sent him over the edge. He wanted this to happen, wanted to feel Dean claiming him as his own, in the most animalistic, primal way possible. That's why he was there, squeezed between one wall and the other's body, moaning and enjoying Dean's thrusts.
He shook his head, exasperated, his mind saturated with thoughts, memories, pain. It was too much, all too much to bear. And he was tired, so tired. He couldn't, and perhaps didn't want to, go on like this anymore. "Leave me alone, Castiel. This is not the time, I don't have the strength to stand here and listen to your bullshit," and for the second time he turned his back on him, determined to leave. He was tired, of a tiredness that he knew would never go away. Castiel grabbed him by the arm, right where he'd grabbed him when he'd taken him away from eternal damnation. The skin sensitive to his touch - perhaps even more so because the touch was Castiel's - sent a thousand shivers down his spine, leaving him breathless. He moved like clay between the angel's hands, letting himself be turned in his direction. The hand still resting on his shoulder burned like fire. A fire he could never have described. Visceral, intimate, heavenly. Castiel's gaze was dark, even darker than he'd noted moments before. Dark, penetrating. bewitching. It was liquid fire, boiling, dripping down his body like honey, softly, enveloping him like the warmest of blankets. He parted his lips, about to speak, yet no sound came from his mouth. He was bewitched, as if under a spell. He winced when Castiel's gaze turned to his lips, feeling every nerve ending quiver. His hands itched, his skin cried out for his touch. He wanted it, craved it. A fire impossible to extinguish except by the other's touch. "Let's get out of here," whispered the angel, only to have the other disappear into thin air as well.
“Who are you?” Sam asked.
Reid froze. Was that a threat? Did they poison the water?
“We can watch Star Wars,” Jack said with a smile.
“Who’s Cas?” Sam asked tiredly.
“I got some,” Dean said before he saw waffles on the counter. “Is that breakfast?”
Reid froze as he realized that the John Doe they had arrested was actually Dean Winchester’s son.
“About what?” Sam mumbled.
Sam looked into Reid’s file and learned a lot about him after he locked him in the bedroom. And all Sam saw was himself.
“Jack’s like our kid,” Sam said anxiously. “It’s different.”
“And what about Reid?” Sam asked.
“You want Bobby dead just as much as I do,” Walt said with a glare.
“No,” Dean said. “I want you to rest. You still look like crap.”
“What are you talking about?” Bobby asked before the handcuffs unlocked.
“Everyone’s been asking what the bees were doing but not how the bees are doing. But that’s not good enough for me. So it’s now my personal project to check on the wellbeing and the potential consciousness of this super colony of bees. It’s why I had you focus on their emotions.”
"I don't have anything to say to you, but if you want to talk, be my guest," he said, clenching the toothbrush between his teeth and looking at it sideways.
"Sam, that's why I don't understand why they saved me. I didn't deserve this, Sammy, I don't deserve to be here," he said, finally, and then walked back toward the driver's seat.
"Do you want me?" he asked, stepping over the barrier of the shirt he wore, essaying the angel's warm skin for the first time. "Do you want me?" he asked again, pushing down the khaki trench coat, letting it fall to the floor unceremoniously. "Yes," he groaned, finally intoxicated by the human's touch. It was too much, too much to bear, and yet so magnificently satisfying. He felt himself on the edge of a precipice, ready to plunge into the most carnal and sinful passion.
"No need to apologize...it's okay," Castiel said, before encircling the boy's shoulders and yanking him into an awkward hug.
"You... little bastard," he exclaimed, too intoxicated by Castiel's body heat. The latter looked at him mischievously, casting him a glare, before stepping closer to him and whispering against his ear. "It's me, Dean, I'm your only god," Dean's breath caught in his throat as Castile's words triggered new feelings. He growled hoarsely, before forcefully pushing him back, and beginning to work his way into him. Sink after sink, moan after moan, they both surrendered to what was pure reality: they belonged to each other.
Castiel's blue eyes seemed to penetrate him, probing his soul, trying to get his every dark secret. The Hunter clenched his fists tightly, driving his nails into his palms, forcing himself to remain still, to do nothing.
"What my brother meant to say," he began, Sam, glaring at his brother, "is if you can tell us what happened before we found you," he concluded, settling a kick against the elder's ankle.
Sam and Dean were petrified on the spot - Cas only indulged in physical contact with Dean, he'd never even hinted at hugging Sam.
"I can be anything you want, Jamie," he replied, in a warm, almost flirtatious tone.
The angel's neck was flushed, stained by the bites and hickeys the hunter had imprinted on his skin. Too attracted to that sight, Dean went down to lick the outline of his neck, tracing the reddish marks he had so lavishly left on it. "I- I don't know, I've never felt like this," he sighed, gripping the other man's shoulders tightly.
"D-Dean," he moaned, closing his eyes and letting himself go completely. Every fiber of his body burned from the erotic caresses the boy reserved for him, every patch of skin aflame with the desire to be touched, explored, possessed. He wanted to be Dean's, completely.
"You're a goddamn vicious angel, Cas. You think I don't know that you provoked me on purpose?" he told him, Dean, seasoning his words with a more ponderous thrust. Cas actually screamed at this point, driving his nails into the Hunter's neck. "Shut up and fuck me, I know it's a recurring fantasy for you," he murmured, his breath short, his eyes glazed over and his body shaken by a thousand shivers. Dean's hoarse laughter shook him completely, pouring into him like warm honey, bringing him closer and closer to the edge. "And I know you couldn't wait to get fucked like that, could you, little angel?" he murmured, against his ear, biting down just a little, before grabbing hold of his own erection and making him moan roguishly.
“The bees didn’t make it, Dean,” Sam said.
date,” Dean retorted. “As long as they’re not a serial killer, or  a demon, or-”
Sam went to say something but stopped himself. He realized why Reid was asking him this question. Sam had looked into Reid’s file and saw the previous drug addiction note. He felt bad for Reid, he really did. Sam had struggled with addiction before too, with the demon blood. They were more alike than he realized.
Everyone stared at each other as they all waited for someone to respond. The conference room was filled with quiet before Garcia burst into tears. JJ instinctively comforted her with a hug.
“This is crazy,” Dean said as he rubbed his eyes.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked.
“Okay,” Reid whined.
As much as Reid didn’t want to risk an adverse reaction of the brother, he needed to know something.
“Man, I need to make burgers more often,” Dean said as he wiped his hands on his jeans.
“Dude, hurry up,” Sam said as impatiently waited for Dean to finish washing his bloody hands in the sink.
“Um…define a lot,” Sam said hesitantly.
Reid put his phone in his pocket. He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath, him breathing in the chilled air.
“Just because you wanna know doesn’t mean that we should know,” Sam said.
“Come on,” Dean said as he abruptly opened the door to Reid’s room.
“Are you hurt?” Hotch asked.
“Shit,” Dean said before sighing in defeat. “Basement. I’m in the basement.”
“Chair is probably better,” Sam said. “At least then we can restrain his legs too.”
He slowly walked closer to the hostage and saw them twitch and mumble something through the gag. Sam sighed.
Crowley had a rule too. Pedophiles go on a special list.
Peter knew how that sounded to someone who hasn’t caught the full conversation. He smiled at that. That would definitely be awkward to explain.
“I know there’s an extra special treatment list in Hell. I need you add one more name,” Dean said.
Dean went to say something but got cut off by his phone going off. He slowly read through the long text and froze.
“Yeah,” Dean said.
“Yes I made breakfast,” Rowena said.
“You make burgers all the time,” Sam said with a smile.
“Hey, Dean,” Sam said tiredly.
“I miss him,” Dean said tiredly.
“Yeah, you arrested him,” Dean said.
Dean took a few deep breaths before walking back into the lab. He froze before running over to Jimmy unconscious on the floor.
Reid noticed Sam in the doorway and twitched.
“You’ll tell me later or when they leave the room?” Castiel whispered as he got close to Dean.
“Who’s Sam?” JJ asked.
Dean froze, his face getting slightly red.
“If he wants to stay he can,” Dean said with a glare.
“Reid, who’s there with you?” Hotch asked.
“So, Bobby…did you do anything interesting before you retired?” Sam asked.
“Give or take 16…17 hours,” Dean said awkwardly.
“Who’s is it then?” Castiel asked.
Reid stayed silent. Maybe Sam has been at the receiving end of Dean’s anger before and gotten desensitized to it.
They all turned around and almost immediately sobered up when they saw Cas in the doorway.
“I’m your stupid idiot,” Dean said with a smirk.
“You should go before it gets super late,” Sam said to Cas.
JJ and Rossi left the conference room. They headed down the hallway and into the interrogation room.
“Yes,” Rowena said.
“Why…Why are there weapons and chains in here?” Sam asked anxiously as he looked around.
“Sam, we’re together,” Reid said with a weird tone.
“Sammy, hey. Are you okay?” Dean asked as Sam shuffled over to the table and sat down.
“It’s okay. He just got mad,” Sam said. “It’s okay.”
“Do whatever you want. You’re the ones who are gonna have to make up the schoolwork,” Bobby said.
“Yes! Quit stalling!” Dean yelled before pulling out a gun and pointing it at Reid. “I have a gun to pretty boy’s head. So talk. Where’s Jack?”
“Agent Rossi,” Rossi said with an almost defeated tone of voice.
The two men didn’t respond. Sam went to grab the lamp but got his wrist grabbed. He got pulled closer to the guy and felt a hand cover his mouth.
“I’m taking out the trash now, Sam,” Bobby said as he walked out of the house with the trash bag.
Sam nodded in response. Sam was exhausted. He was exhausted physically. He was exhausted mentally. He was tired of the witch’s curse and he was tired of stressing about the whole Reid situation. Sam rubbed his eyes.
“Are you okay?” Sam asked as he stepped into Reid’s view.
Dean nodded.
“We can’t let him go,” Hotch said.
“How about you, Rowena? Got a favorite memory of Jack?” Dean slurred.
“I can’t. She’ll…She’ll yell at me,” Peter said as his eyes watered.
“Why are you sad?” Jack asked from the doorway.
“The guys a fed,” Dean added.
“I hated living with them,” Sam said quietly to himself.
I’m so sorry to end the story like this. Like I literally couldn’t come up with another idea in my head tbh. And it was kinda stressing me out too because I just wanted to finish the story but this was the only ending I could think of.
“Then I put the B in LGBT,” CAS said, Dean freezing. “That was my attempt at a ‘joke’ as humans call it. My apologies at the awkwardness now.”
“Kid,” Bobby said calmly as Sam got out of the car.
Sam glared at him as he struggled against the restraints.
“You’re gonna have to knock him out,” Benny said to Cas.
The most Reid could do right now was eat the breakfast he was given. It smelled good. And he was starving. And dehydrated.
Reid liked how brains forgot for a split second about a situation when they first wake up. It was almost like a sense of peace. You forget about an injury you have, or something incredibly stressful. Or in this case, you forget you’ve been kidnapped by two serial killers who are probably going to torture you for an extended period of time.
He separated from Cas's body slowly, running his lips along the length of his still lingering, sensitive erection. Castiel, shaken but still lucid, could read the pleasure the human was feeling at that moment, and a sudden urge to dare pervaded him. With force, he pulled him against himself, then pushed him with his back on the mattress and positioned himself astride his pelvis.
"Dean?" called out to him, again, Sam, turning a worried look on him. Dean cleared his throat, trying to push through the hint of excitement that had inexorably encompassed him at the thought of the angel. "Yes, sorry, I was overthinking it," he replied, after a while, disguising his own discomfort. He got up, with his usual listless attitude, and went to the bathroom with the excuse of having to brush his teeth. He closed the door with force, as if trying to wake up from a daydream, and leaned his back against it wearily. He closed his eyes, sighing, trying to regain control of his body.
Damned of an angel, he'd even started hitting on others!
"Fuck!" he exclaimed as he felt Castiel lower himself fully onto his erection. He could feel with every fiber of his being, Castiel's hot, feverish body, his walls gripping him tightly in a deadly, erotic vice. He gripped his hips tightly as he felt him move on his pelvis, lowering himself deeper and deeper, letting every inch of Dean's flesh enter him completely.
"God, Castiel, you're going to drive me crazy," he muttered, and then opened his eyes, determined to start that day like any other. The first thing he saw, as soon as he could focus the room, were Castiel's impossibly blue eyes. His breath caught in his throat, feeling stupidly violated in the privacy of the bathroom. He took a hesitant step forward, more trying to show off his swagger than anything else. He was grateful to be wearing a pair of pajama pants that were definitely loose, because otherwise he wouldn't have known how to explain the instant erection that had formed. Damn him, angel! And damn his hormones going crazy for him.
“We got a deal or no?” Dean asked.
“Hey, kid,” Bobby said before looking at the tv. “Why are you watching Dora The Explorer?”
“He was looking through drawers and found the handcuffs. And then we both grabbed them and they locked onto us,” Jack explained.
“Look, we’re here,” Dean said with a smile as he pulled up to the university.
“Sure,” Sam said tiredly.
Sam got blinded by the sunlight, it providing enough of a distraction for him to get dragged out of the trunk without any trouble. Sam looked at the car and froze.
“Training. Let’s go,” Dean said.
“Sleep, Sammy,” Dean said as he covered Sam with a blanket.
“What?!” Sam yelled.
“Is everything alright?” Jack asked with a concerned tone.
Reid silently screamed in his head. Sam is a serial killer. Stop having these feelings. This is Stockholm syndrome.
“I’m gonna be completely honest with you two, I’ve never seen that room ever in my entire life,” Bobby said.
“I hate this,” Dean said to himself as he ran his hand through his hair.
“Wait, I know that car door sound,” Sam said to himself before the trunk got opened.
“Because I have to communicate with this thing, Sammy,” Dean said. “I kinda wanna know what exactly I’m communicating with.”
“Oh. I’m sorry,” Jack said before smiling. “They’re off now, so that’s good. Are you okay now? Or better at least?”
“Talk,” Dean said quietly to Reid as he put the phone on speaker.
“Um…” Reid said anxiously. “Um you need to…you need to let him go.”
“S-Sure, cool,” Dean said as his face got red. “Definitely.”
“Hilarious,” Dean said sarcastically. “So what do I gotta do?”
Sam nodded and walked closer to Reid. He unlocked the handcuffs, Reid now moving his wrist a little bit to get feeling back into it.
“I thought you were a serial killer,” Dean said tiredly as Bobby came down the stairs with Cas and Crowley. “I still think you are but I care more about getting out of here so.”
“He’s fine. I healed his dislocated wrist after I knocked him out,” Castiel said. “I’m more worried about Dean right now though.”
“Yes,” Dean said, his tone full of annoyance. “What is this, 20 questions? Stop asking me questions.”
“What do you like to be called? Spencer or Reid? Or something else?” Sam asked.
“In the impala,” Dean said.
“Just breathe, everything’s okay,” Sam said. “Dean doesn’t know where I am…because he’s trapped in the basement…in a secret room. Fuck. I’m in trouble.”
Peter had been too anxious and focused on not trying to break down crying to notice that Dean was right by the door. Peter probably would have cried more if he knew Dean had overheard. Skip had messed with his head and said if anyone knew, that he would be called ‘disgusting’ and ‘a whore’ and everything in between. The only reason he could actually talk about it was because it was Jack that he was with. Peter had always been comfortable around Jack, so he was comfortable talking about his trauma with him.
“I got in,” Dean said.
Training.
“Here we go with the yelling again,” Dean said to himself.
“Either we do it this way or we break Jack out ourselves, and I doubt you wanna do that,” Dean said.
Cas nodded awkwardly before they walked into the office.
“Cool! Which ones?” Peter asked, a huge smile now on his face.
“I’m glad,” Castiel said before Sam burst through the door. “Hello, Sam.”
“Like I said, I’ll text an address. Meet me there,” Walt said before he hung up.
“Oh. C-Cool. Very cool,” Dean said. “Why angel wings?”
“No,” Hotch said as he rubbed his temples. “We have until tomorrow to find Reid. JJ and Rossi, go to the morgue and find out what happened to Jack.”
“Yeah. Yeah. I’m good. I’m good. I just hate handcuffs,” Peter said.
“Dean, it’s a bot. It can’t be alive,” Sam said. “It’s impossible.”
“It is a school day,” Crowley said.
“Thank you,” Castiel said.
“Bobby used to be a hunter,” Dean said as he tried to come up with a reason.
Sam choked on the breath of air he was breathing in. He looked at Bobby with wide eyes.
“Sammy, you know what about,” Dean said.
“Asleep. It’s midnight. He’s old,” Sam said with a glare. “Get out.”
“What about the torture room downstairs?” Dean asked.
“Since when does Bobby have friends?” Sam asked.
“But if you must brainwash him, I have a spell that will open his mind more, so it’ll be…quicker for him to accept that monsters exist,” Rowena said. “Would you be interested in that?”
“Relax, no need to worry about that. I had Cas make sure you were okay,” Sam said. “How are you feeling?”
“No, he can’t. Because someone outside of this house needs to know that we’re doing this. So Cas, go home. If we don’t text you or call saying we’re fine, then get help because then we’re probably dead. Okay?”
Bobby ushered for Cas to put the phone on speaker.
“Monsters, okay?” Dean said with a glare.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean said to himself, Sam snickering.
Dean awkwardly looked at Sam, who rubbed the back of his neck. Dean turned to Reid, who was mumbling through the gag and quickly looking around the room.
“Sammy?” Dean asked with a concerned tone.
“Pinks a nice color. Why do you like pink?” Sam asked.
“Wait, you’re gay?” Dean asked.
“Fine then, don’t invite him over,” Bobby said.
“But lying is so much fun,” Dean said with a smirk.
Dean and Rowena turned to see Sam coming into the room.
“Now we get rid of him,” Dean said as he handcuffed Reid’s wrists together. “Thanks for…not being dead.”
“I’ll let you sleep,” Derek said.
“We should come up with a code word or something that we’ll text each other. So if like Bobby takes our phones or something then you’ll know that it’s actually us,” Dean said. “Funky town.”
Dean dragged an unconscious Reid out of the trunk. Sam grabbed his ankles as they carried him out of the garage. They made their way down the hallway and towards the dungeon.
Jack didn’t exactly want to tell Peter that the reason he has handcuffs in his house was because Sam and Dean needed them for hunting monsters. So he needed to lie. But Jack hated lying. So he needed to not tell the entire truth.
Bobby listened to the ringing before it stopped after someone answered.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Bobby asked.
“Bobby closed it up for good,” Dean said.
Sam nodded.
“He’s a bad guy,” Dean said as he stared at his hands.
“Why are you in the basement?” Bobby asked as he walked towards the basement door, Cas and Crowley following.
“He’s okay though, right?” Dean asked as he bit his nail.
“Relax, I didn’t give you anything for the pain if that’s why you’re asking,” Sam said.
“We good?” Dean asked as he stepped back from Reid.
“Please don’t heal me,” Dean said to Cas as his eyes watered. “Because I need to not feel…anything right now.”
“Stanford?! Why are we in Stanford? As in California?!” Sam yelled.
Reid rubbed his eyes and blinked them. He tried to push away the thoughts and feelings for Sam that he had but he couldn’t help it. Reid threw it off as Stockholm syndrome. Sam was nice to Reid. He was far nicer than Dean was. Sam cared about him. Reid’s brain did have feelings for him.
“Yeah,” Dean said as he nodded.
“The John Doe we arrested for killing six people. You need to let him go,” Reid said.
“Okay,” Sam said, understanding what was going on.
Peter smiled slightly. Jack was honestly too pure for this world. He really was.
“But if we text you funky town, that means we’re in trouble,” Dean added.
“He’s fine,” Dean said coldly.
“So?” Dean asked impatiently.
“Jack’s dead,” Dean mumbled.
“Of course. I do have quite a habit of coming back from the dead,” Castiel said before smiling at Dean.
Reid didn’t even flinch when Sam touched him. This was definitely a bad sign. He was becoming more comfortable with Sam, which was bad. He wanted so bad to stop flinching but him stopping flinching meant he was getting used to everything.
“Hospital,” Derek said.
“So let’s get rid of it,” Dean said as he frantically reached into Reid’s pockets and grabbed the hex bag.
“Because I didn’t want you to worry about me,” Dean said. “Plus, I was comfortable knowing that only I knew. It keeps it from being…real I guess. The guys dead, Sammy, and now the only person alive who knows is me. Granted, now Peter knows, and you. But that’s not the point.”
“It’s okay, kid,” Dean said as interrupted Peter to get him to stop talking. “I’m glad you feel safe around us.”
Peter sniffled and took a deep breath. His breathing was still a little shaky, but he wasn’t full on hyperventilating anymore so that was progress.
Dean closed the door and saw Sam whisper something. He noticed the symbol on the door glow before fading.
“My father always said I was an angel, so I decided to get a tattoo of wings,” Castiel said. “Plus it looks nice.”
“Plus any awkwardness would be chalked up to you being around Cas so I think this is a good idea,” Sam said.
“No thanks. I had my time with him, so did Sam,” Dean said.
Jack continued to stare at the handcuffs before noticing some sigils carved into them.
“When can I go?” Reid asked hesitantly, his voice finally returning to him.
“I’m fine,” Dean said.
“Yeah,” Dean said quietly. “You know, ever since Cas…ever since Cas…died…I’ve been super protective of the kid. I don’t know, I just became way overprotective of him. I finally let him go out on a hunt by himself. It was only a few towns over so I didn’t…I didn’t wanna let him but Sam said I should. And now that the feds have him in custody…I’m losing my mind. If I never let him go on that hunt alone…maybe this would be different I guess.”
“No, no, it’s not,” Peter said, a slight smile on his face because of Jack’s wholesale reaction.
“Hotch got a text from an unknown number with an address. We went there and found you at a motel,” Derek said. “You were alive but unconscious and the ambulance brought you here.”
Reid got jolted out of his thoughts about the Winchesters when he got pushed into a room. Reid stumbled and caught his footing before he looked around the room. The room was big. It had mats all over the floor too.
Dean walked over to Reid and tightly grabbed his wrist. He dragged Reid out of the room, Reid stumbling behind him. At this point, Reid definitely preferred Sam to Dean. Sam was gentle and calm, and made Reid feel comfortable and safe. Despite what Reid’s profiler mind was telling him, he was comfortable around Sam. Dean on the other hand seemed pissed off at him anytime he was around him.
Reid felt something put into his pocket, his vision now blurred and unfocused. He lost all of his strength practically instantly. Reid went to talk as he got dragged towards a car but only a low mumble came out.
“Is he okay?” Dean asked Jack as he put the handcuffs back in the drawer.
“My ‘self defense’ is my brain,” Reid said slowly.
“I don’t,” Dean said. “But he won’t be leaving until he’s a badass hunter who knows the ropes. Now, I need beer.”
“Like you can’t fit his dead body in a bag kind of problem or you like him kind of problem?” Bobby asked.
“What?” Dean asked.
“Alright, idjits, I got the paperwork and the person who owned the house before your parents was…Jack Vaughan,” Bobby said as he walked back into the room.
"I'm yours?" he asked, the hunter, in an attempt to come across as mocking. He looked deeply into his eyes, wondering if when he'd had sex with Anna he'd felt the same sensations. Maybe it was the amazing effect of the angels. Castiel's expression changed, as if he'd sensed his thoughts, and a low, almost primal, animalistic growl spread through Dean's mind, leaving him breathless and incredibly aroused. "Don't think about her," he intimated, tightening his grip on his arm even more. The words spoken by the other had the opposite effect: in an attempt to keep the memories of the night spent with Anna out of his mind, he found himself reliving them. Traitorous mind! Clutched in the angel's steel grip, and with all his senses on high alert, it didn't take Dean long to realize what was happening. Castiel's lips had fallen angrily to Dean's, demanding a kiss that tasted both sacred and profane. They pressed against each other, bodies colliding, tongues fighting, and unrelenting desire flowing into each other's bodies. They separated only when Dean found himself gasping for air and trying to make sense of everything that had just happened. He could still feel the heat of Castiel's lips on his own, the sweet, fresh, intoxicating taste of the angel's mouth in his own. He smelled it on him, knew it, felt it. And hell, he loved it. Yet he was confused. He didn't know what had happened - or rather, how it could have happened - he didn't know why, and what it meant to him - to them. He took a step away from Castiel's figure, still upset and too high strung to reason rationally. Castiel had kissed him, he had no doubt about that. And he'd kissed him back, hell yes, and he'd damn well liked it. But he was confused, he needed to think, to reason with a clear head.
"He doesn't think there's any need, Sam's wounds were deeper and more severe, you'll be fine. Now, are we done here?" he asked, as if he was terribly late. The exchange of glances - confused and irritated by Dean and proud and vindictive by Cas - of the two lovers put Sam in a more than uncomfortable position. "Um...I think we're still needed, they have a hostage," he pointed with his chin to the boy tied to a chair at the far end of the room. They all moved quickly, Castiel first, and within moments he found himself facing the boy hostage.
"I-" he murmured, only to close his eyes and let out an unexpected moan of pleasure. He felt Dean's warm lips teasing him, now biting his earlobe, now licking the outline of his neck. "Touch me," he managed to say, in a whisper, laying down more on the bed, tensing all his muscles, showing himself completely at the Hunter's mercy. He wanted Dean's hands to touch him, to explore him, to love him. He wanted to feel his heat burning his skin, sending him into raptures, a slave to this new passion that only he could bring forth.
The hunter's eyes raced to the angel's face, meeting the two pools of sky in place of his eyes, reading all the desire he felt, similar to his own. "Cas," whispered Dean in response, in an erotic prayer, a plea for help that only he could and should grant. Their lips met, in a carnal kiss, rough, devoid of any logical sense. They pressed against each other, in an attempt to feel, feel, feel, more and more. Castiel's eyes were two blue pools of desire, the pupil dilated, the languid gaze he cast in Dean's direction. And Dean couldn't help but grow harder and harder under that look of erotic pleading. The Hunter fumbled with the angel's classically cut belt and pants, quickly lowering them and leaving him alone with his underwear as well.
"I was simply hoping to have a more civilized conversation than yesterday," Castiel said, glacially, watching the hunter's movements. "You mean when you dicked me over for fucking a girl? I didn't take you for such a bigot, Castiel, you should know that I never deny myself a sexual pleasure if I get the chance," Dean exclaimed, sarcastically, rejoicing internally when an ill-concealed growl escaped Castiel's throat.
It took her a short time to get him up, tugging him by the arm, and in moments she pushed him against the wall. She quickly undressed him, lowering his clothing just enough to get to his private parts. Cas's lost look sent him over the edge, so he thrust himself - unceremoniously - into his body in a rough, animalistic lunge.
"Thank you, thank you so much!" he exclaimed, the young victim, before throwing himself against Castiel's body. The angel remained still, frozen in place, still too shaken to reciprocate that affectionate exchange, typical of humans. "I-I... I'm sorry," the young man said, backing away from the angel's body, under Dean's burning gaze of jealousy. That this kid was hitting on his angel?
"You're still defending him?" he snickered, mouth closed, feeling paralyzed by the desire to punch that angelic face.
"Dean," a gasp escaped Castiel's sinful lips, a prayer, an unfamiliar desire, and Dean decided to go along with it, to make his wish come true. Tight against his own body he began to walk in the direction of his own bed, still unmade, and mending the dream - definitely pushed - that he had experienced that night. A part of his mind told him that his imagination was nothing compared to reality.
"You're right, it's all part of a greater design, a divine plan. But then tell me, Castiel, why does it bother you so much if I act the way God created me?" Castiel did not answer, he breathed hard through his nose, as if trying to contain his anger.
Part Three
And he was right, damn it! He felt lost, plunged into an abyss he didn't know, where he could only hear, see, want Castiel. They threw themselves on the bed, both panting, Dean almost completely naked, and Castiel with his shirt open over his muscular chest.
Dean huffed, rolling his eyes, then gave him a shove to get him to move. He opened the door ungently, making the handle squeak dangerously, heading back toward the bedroom. "I've grown tired of your games, Castiel. If you don't want to talk, I don't give a damn. Just don't stand there looking at me with that fucking expression," he huffed, grabbing a shirt and a pair of pants from his duffel bag.
Inside the motel room, Dean felt safer. Or maybe it was because both of Castiel's hands were clasped around his body. He could feel the heat emanating from his palms through his clothes, and he restrained himself from moaning. He didn't know what was happening to his body. He felt possessed, yet at the same time so free. "You're mine" Castiel exclaimed, suddenly, igniting the spark of arousal in Dean.
"Dean," he bellowed, his lower lip clenched in the grip of his own teeth to keep himself from being obscenely succumbing to that passion. "Tell me, Cas, what do you desire?" the hunter asked in a warm, seductive tone, speaking directly against his ear, then reaching down to nibble on the soft, sensitive lobe.
"Why did you come out?" he asked, his low, gravelly voice directly drawing the attention of his downstairs. "I couldn't stand to stay there with you...and that," he said, harshly, and then moved and walked away in the direction of the small alley that bordered the bar. He leaned against the side exit of the bar, shivering when his back rested against the iron handle of the door. In a few moments he was again reached by the angel, on whose face he could read a determined expression. "I don't understand the adversity towards Jamie," he said, lapidary, with the usual coldness that characterized their every conversation. Castiel and rigid rationality, fuck them both!
"So, Jamie, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?" said, Dean, stomping hard on the boy's name. The latter looked at him bewildered, his eyes wide, his occa ajar, in an attempt to say something. Anything to make the stern look the Hunter was giving him fade away. "I- um..." he muttered, red with embarrassment and still destabilized.
"Oh, Dean," sighed Castiel, once again obnubilated with pleasure, as he pressed the Hunter's body tightly against himself. "Only I, Cas, only I can do this," growled, Dean, caught up in a possessive feeling unknown to him. He groaned, in a mixture of pain and pleasure, as Castiel's nails sank into his flesh, branding him again, on his back. With each thrust, harder and rougher, they pressed into each other, kissing and branding each other. First on his neck, on his shoulder, on his jaw, every inch of skin screamed the belonging of one to the other
"I don't understand why my presence here is essential," Castiel repeated, again, causing Sam and Dean to snort simultaneously. "We don't know what we're dealing with, Cas, it's always better to have a backup," replied, Sam, patting him on the shoulder in a brotherly fashion. Castiel looked at him confused, wrinkling his eyebrows still not sure what that meant.
"I don't understand your colloquial expressions...why would anyone end up with their head up their anal orifice?" he asked, with cold calm. Sam huffed out a giggle, determined not to answer that question for anything in the world. "Stop talking you two back there, we have a job to do," and with that lapidary sentence - in more than a pissed off tone - he put an end to that exchange of banter. Sam gave Castiel an enquiring look, then quickened his pace to follow his brother. Castiel lagged behind the other two, deep in thought. For days he had been analyzing a particular feature of the relationship between him and Dean: the latter, especially in the presence of third parties - and Sam - tended to appear detached towards him, as if trying to hide the affection that united them. He had searched for a plausible explanation - among the thousands of variables that existed - but had not been able to find a satisfactory one - and had analyzed them all. So, in the end, he had simply surrendered to reality: Dean considered Castiel nothing more than a mere body with which to share carnal pleasure. In his place, if there had been a girl - as had happened over and over again - he would have acted the same way.
"We need to talk about what happened yesterday," Castiel said finally, trying to make his own tone as calm and warm as possible. Dean seemed to ignore his words, still intent on attending to his own dental hygiene. What Castiel didn't know, however, was when the hunter was actually burning with the desire to find those wonderful, sinful lips pressed against his own. Yes, he told himself, he would gladly sell his soul to the devil again, just so he could taste Castiel's lips again.
Dean held him tightly to himself, making their bodies match perfectly. His mind was completely clouded by that unknown desire. He didn't know what to do, how to do it, where to put his hands; a man's body - Castiel's, because in that moment he was thinking only and exclusively of him, he desired him - was different from the soft and much more buttery body of the girls he had always dated. But he let himself be guided, by that visceral, passionate desire that set him on fire like fire on gasoline. And he felt himself burning, and wished that the other was burning with his own carnal desire as well.
"Do you know what Anna said to me? Yes, just before I fucked her," he pretended to ignore the other man's guttural cry in response to his words. "She told me that more than anything, she longed to be like us humans. To have feelings, pleasure, pain, and that what he wanted most was... sex," he whispered the last word against the angel's ear drum, faking a moan. And finally he had what he had wanted most since he had seen him appear before him in the bathroom: his lips pressed tightly against his. He grasped his face angrily, as if afraid that he might regain a shred of sanity and decide to pull away. He tangled his fingers in his dark curls, drowning in his lips with desire. He moaned into her mouth as he felt his hands - hot as hell and wonderful as heaven - move deftly over his body. He tasted all the curves, the toned muscles, the scars that defined that manly, exciting body. Yes, even for an angel Dean was definitely hot. He angrily bit the hunter's sinful lips, as if to punish him for his provocation, and continued to torture him until he had to pull away to breathe. Dean's eyes were liquid, glossy with desire, his lips swollen, red, vermilion and full of bite. He looked at Castiel as if - for the first time - he realized there was an angel standing next to him. "You. You are. Mine," he punctuated, in a gravelly voice, the same phrase that had been echoing in Dean's mind since the night before. The human was out of breath, gasping for some oxygen, and at those words he could only suppress a groan of excitement. Castiel's hard expression softened, and he took to stroking his face lovingly. He could feel Dean's thoughts bouncing around in his own mind. He felt the guilt, the terror of being wrong, dirty, unfit. The angel's attentions to him were impossible to accept. He was unworthy, unworthy of his brother's love, of the determination with which he believed him innocent. And unworthy of the trust Castiel, the angels, and all of creation placed in him. "Dean..." whispered Castiel softly, placing a kiss on the corner of his mouth. "Dean, never believe that you are unworthy of being loved. Not by your brother, not by God. You were chosen, Dean, and that makes you the purest and most wonderful of people," then kissed him again. The passion that had gripped them until then was dissipating, giving way to a less impetuous and more pure desire. They continued kissing for an infinite time, letting their bodies come closer, touching, brushing against each other, without haste.
"Tell me what you want, Castiel, your every wish will come true," whispered, Dean, towering over the angel's body.
"It was a simple observation, rational" at the exact instant Castiel took a step towards Dean, the latter lost control completely. She grabbed him hard on the shoulders, pushing against him and angrily assaulting his lips. An impetuous kiss of teeth and bites, both furious. "You're a bastard, Cas," Dean muttered, furious, reversing their positions and forcing him against the wall by the back door. A shred of rationality and reason was still present inside the Hunter, but the more he felt the angel's lips move against his, the more control of the situation was taken - by force - by the desire for possession that flowed like lava through his veins.
"C-certainly..." he whispered, before being encouraged by a gentle pat on the shoulder from Castiel, who was looking at him with gentle reassurance. Dean immediately felt the blood boil in his veins, jealousy flowing like lava through his body, clutching his stomach in a death grip, and an inexplicable - yeah, right - murderous instinct towards that little boy all smiles and embarrassed whispers. He didn't even bother to listen to his story - which might have led them to a new lead on a demon hunt - and walked away from the table. The chair crawled forcefully across the bar's filthy, worn floor, causing numerous curious heads to turn in his direction. He forcefully put down the beer he was spasmodically clutching in his hand, and stomped away. In no time at all, he was hit by the cold of that autumn evening, as opposed to the hellish heat he felt inside - perhaps also because of the anger that had burst in his chest. He decided, for his own sake and the health of all the people in the bar, that it was definitely time to take a walk. The alternative would have been to shoot a kid - or to do that pesky angel in front of everyone - and part of himself was still enticed by that idea. But he knew Sam would have kicked him in the face, if only he'd thought about it for a few more moments.
He leaned back against the wall that lined the entrance to the club, taking large gulps of air in an attempt to calm what Sam would have called hot spirits. He closed his eyes, searching within himself for the good sense not to make a momentous mess.
"I- I have to go," he said only, his eyes slightly liquid and vacant. He didn't bother waiting for a word from the other, he decided to escape as quickly as possible. In his heart he hoped the angel would follow him, seize him, take him back to that room and then give himself to him in all the most obscene ways he knew how. And, Dean be damned, he was also quite attracted to the idea of coming back to indulge in that heavenly pleasure, but part of himself told himself that he had to think about it with a clear head. After his escape, he slowly made his way back to his own motel, letting the crisp evening air hit him full in the face, bringing him back to reality.
He could feel the warmth of Castiel's body - yes, because to him that belonged exclusively to Castiel - and it only made the blood boil in his veins. Blind passion assailed him, and in a few moments he found himself kneeling before Cas. The angel looked up at him from under his long lashes, an expression both confused and excited at the same time. A mischievous smile formed on Dean's lips, slowly, as he completely undressed his little angel. That, broke the last barrier of demureness that had remained between the two of them; Castiel was now in his most purely human form. Undressed, proud in his nakedness and hardness, which couldn't help but draw Dean's incredibly ravenous attention. He brushed his fingertips over the angel's muscular legs, slowly moving up to the other, aiming for the pelvis. He felt incredibly powerful, and at the same time succubus: that's how Castiel made him feel, constantly. Victim and executioner. And it made him alive, damn alive. "I see you finally knelt before a soldier of God," Castiel's voice was hoarse, unsteady, uncertain. And here he too was showing himself to be succubus and executioner. Dean's short, hoarse laugh shook the angel's entire body, sending shivers of excitement through him. "I'm not devoted to any god," he murmured, before throwing himself down to taste the other man's sinful fruit. He slowly took Cas's hard, hot erection between his lips, sending Dean's taste buds into raptures. The smell of the angel there was stronger, intoxicating him with its pure essence. He moved calmly, slowly, assaying inch by inch the other's hard flesh, enjoying torturing him deliciously with a particular focus of his tongue. Cas was now a mass of moans and gasps, unable to decipher all the sensations he was feeling, new, hot, heavenly. He felt his own body burning under those laps, under Dean's sometimes slow and sometimes rough touch. "Dean!" he exclaimed, his eyes narrowed and his hands clasped in the other man's hair. He wanted to have him closer, to feel his own erection sink between the Hunter's wet, sinful lips. He wanted more, demanded more. "More, Dean...don't stop," he bellowed, disconnected thoughts devoid of all logic leaving his lips, until he reached his own pleasure, screaming his Hunter's name and pouring between his lips. Dean didn't move, he stayed and took in everything Cas had to offer him, enjoying watching him in primal pleasure.
"Everything okay?" he asked, Sam, joining him at the bar to help him carry the beers to the table. "Sure," said, between his teeth, Dean, continuing to look sourly at the two lovebirds. "You sure? Dean, don't tell me you're jealous of Jamie, you know Cas is only related to you" Sam told him, in a calm and reasonable voice. Too bad there was very little that was reasonable about Dean. Especially when it came to his angel. "It's okay, little brother," he said, through gritted teeth, as he grabbed the beers that had been set down on the counter and walked over to their table, a cheeky fake smile on his face. He approached the table with a steady stride, the stiff smile not reaching his eyes. He looked like a homicidal maniac, ready for his next crime, and Sam, unfortunately, seemed to have figured out who the victim might be.
Part Two
"And you know it wasn't my decision to save you from damnation," he murmured, intently watching the other's lips, now parted to let out a shaky breath.
Part One
"What happened between you and Anna?" he asked, in a low, hoarse voice. Dean was speechless for a moment, confused, trying to metabolize what he had been asked. His expression changed abruptly, from confused to enraged. He contracted his jaw hard, making it even sharper and more pronounced. "What on earth do you care! Does it go against your fucking angel rules to get a healthy fuck?!" he exploded in rage at the other, letting all the tension, the anger, the pain pour out against that unwitting victim.
"Hey, you're awake," Sam's warm, peppy voice brought him back to reality. He snapped his head up, blushing slightly at the unchaste thoughts that had crossed his mind. He and Castiel, wrapped in an intimate embrace. Hands tasting every inch of their skin, as if learning by heart the myriad nuances of their bodies. And Castiel's lips, so sinful to belong to an angel, roaming restlessly over his neck, down his chest, in a heavenly descent to his sex.
"I know you heard what he said to me," exclaimed, Dean, glaring at his brother. Sam gave him a confused look, shifting his weight from one leg to the other in discomfort. "Who?" he asked, trying to use a light tone. Dean sighed, leaning wearily on the hood of the car. "Alastair. I know you heard what he said to me," he repeated, this time turning to look him in the eye. Finally Sam relented, nodding in response. "Yes, I heard what he told you."
"You're only mine, Dean," he growled, Cas, before pouring out again and staining their chests. Dean, not so far from climaxing in turn, tightened his grip on the other's hips, moving with quick, close hits. "It's you, Cas, it's always been you, my only God," he whispered to him, with a gentleness that clashed with the rough thrusts. They kissed one last time, before Dean poured into Castiel, branding him as his, forever.
Dean's awakening was less traumatic than usual. He opened his eyes slowly, unhurriedly adjusting to the light filtering through the dark curtains that were still closed. He turned to Sam's bed, finding it empty, but still unmade. He felt rested, for the first time in months. Specifically, for the first time since Castiel had rescued him from Hell. He sighed at the thought of Cas, realizing not only that he hadn't had nightmares, but that he had dreamed of the angel. Confusing images swirled through his mind: the other's soft, fleshy lips, the blue eyes that looked at him like he was one of the wonders of the world. He could still feel the warmth of the other man's lips on his own. He stroked his mouth slowly, as if terrified that the heavenly sensation would vanish forever. He was still sensitive to the touch, almost as if he'd been kissed all night.
At the exact moment they stepped into the bar, Dean called himself stupid for suggesting that they go out, and even more so for thinking that this would be the perfect opportunity to resolve the thorny situation between him and Castiel. The angel, for a reason unknown to him, preferred to converse with the little boy they had saved from that bunch of filthy demons. Obviously the Hunter was happy that the boy was okay, but he couldn't help but wonder "why the hell did he have to hit on his own boyfriend?" a boyfriend, by the way, who had decided to ignore his existence. She hated when those situations arose, Castiel was damn hard to understand.
"And you're not curious?" he asked, surprised. Sam seemed more than a little interested in learning the grisly and painful details of his time in Hell. "I'm damn curious, Dean, but you seem determined not to talk about it. I'm certainly not going to be the one to force you," the calm, gentle tone Sam used made him feel like a child reluctant to recount a nightmare. If only he knew. "Time is different there, you know? It wasn't four months for me. Time was dilated, different, infinite. It was like forty years had passed." he began, his voice low and gruesome. It was like he wasn't really speaking, like he was in a trance. "They did horrible, indescribable things to me. But I resisted, you know. I stayed strong, tried not to think about that pain. To live it as if it were part of my job," his voice was tortured, pained, his eyes glassy as if he were reliving those scenes again and again. In body, in mind, in soul. "But that's not the worst part, Sammy. At some point it wasn't just about the torture anymore. Alastair would come to me, every day, and offer me a deal. I would no longer be tortured, but I would have to start torturing the souls of the damned myself" He felt Sam at his side hold his breath, as if he was living his brother's words on his own skin. "I refused, every day I refused his proposal" hot tears began to stream down Dean's freckled, manly face. "I refused for thirty years, Sammy. Then I gave in," he finally confessed, his voice broken, his face wet with tears. Poorly restrained sobs escaped from his lips, his body shaken by the guilt and pain triggered by the confession. "I gave in, started torturing myself. From victim, I had become executioner."
“It’s okay to not know how you’re feeling,” Sam said with a slight smile.
“No. No. No. Reid. Don’t shut down on me, pretty boy,” Derek said quickly. “You’re okay, I promise you.”
“That kid and his serial killer fetish, honestly,” Dean said to himself.
“Are you sure you’re okay, Sammy?” Dean asked.
Dean stretched and made his way towards Reid. He stopped outside the door and opened it. He glanced at the plate on the table and noticed it empty.
“I should have known your Winchester stupidity would show up eventually,” Rowena said to herself. “Samuel, sweetie, you need to take a break. You’re new to witchcraft. Stop doing spells. Take the week and don’t do any witchcraft, please. It’s why you’re exhausted.”
Cas touched Sam’s forehead and then Rowena’s.
“We work the case,” Hotch said.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked.
“Alright. I’ve known for a while. And?” Bobby asked.
“One in a lifetime because we’re lucky to be alive,” Dean retorted. “And also, being locked in there and handcuffed isn’t fun, Sammy, trust me on that.”
Dean quickly tackled Cas on the floor after panicking from the door open. Bobby froze.
“You what?” Sam asked, his eyes widened.
“Huh?” Sam asked as he got pulled out of his thoughts.
“Get them off. Get them off,” Peter said anxiously. “Please.”
“I don’t think we will,” he said. “Your John’s kid, aren’t you?”
Sam sighed in relief as Rowena smiled.
“It’s not like Bobby is gonna listen to us so why not have some leverage?” One of the guys asked the other.
Dean’s overprotective brother mode kicked in, prompting his posture to adjust as he ran over to Sam.
“Why are we in California?” Sam asked as he tried to calm his heart rate down.
“I loved him,” Dean said slowly.
Reid sat up. He was covered in blankets. The last thing he remembered was being in the bathroom. He remembers the heat of the water from the sink. And then…lights out.
"Cas, move over," Dean murmured, darkly, stubbornly not turning his gaze to her face. He quivered, from desire, from jealousy, and he feared - he knew - that if he didn't move closer to her body, he would commit indecent exposure. And he would also fuck - and maybe shoot - anyone who got in the way to stop them. "Look at me," he ordered, Castiel, a hard expression on his face, lifting his chin and locking his gaze in hers.
"In fact, you could say that sex and girls are my only God," his breath caught in a second as Castiel pushed him hard against the wall. He felt his breath leave his lungs, for a moment, leaving him gasping for oxygen. Castiel's face was a span away from his own, his expression hard, furious. He pushed his arm hard against his throat, holding him against the wall with his whole body to prevent any source of escape. "Don't say such profanities in my presence," he growled against his lips, his eyes ablaze with blind passion. "Or what?" whispered - nay, gasped - Dean in response, letting a small mischievous smile form on his lips. Castiel contracted his jaw, causing the already normally austere features of his face to harden deliciously. "You want to test the wrath of a soldier of God?" he demanded, angrily, pushing against the hunter's body until their bodies were completely joined. Dean could feel Castiel's dysphragm rise and fall, unconsciously dictating the rhythm of his breathing as well. "You knew well, Castiel, when you saved me from eternal damnation that I'm anything but a saint," he whispered against the angel's lips, which twitched for a moment. Castiel's breath against his own face was cool, familiar, exciting.
“Last night?” Bobby asked with a pair of widened eyes.
“How? Bobby isn’t gonna leave the house,” Dean said.
“Oh my god I’m locked in,” Dean said to himself anxiously. “Okay. Okay. Just breathe. Breathe. If I die, then I don’t have to do finals. But that means I’ll never date Cas. Fuck. Okay. Cas is more important.”
“You okay?” Sam asked.
“Where’s Jack?” Dean asked.
Sam groaned. Why was he awake right now? Sam usually slept through the night. It’s not like he hadn’t gone to bed not even an hour ago so he shouldn’t be awake.
“What happened?” Peter asked hesitantly. “Did someone…”
“How am I gonna get out of this one?” Reid asked himself quietly.
“He’s my son. Where is he?” Dean asked with an irritated tone.
“You’re gonna want to drink the water,” Sam said.
“Reid? Is everything okay?” Hotch asked. “You didn’t show up for work. Morgan was going to stop by your apartment but we figured you were sleeping.”
Dean nodded frantically.
Dean glanced over at Jack and Peter, who were awkwardly in the doorway.
“Don’t,” the person said as Reid went to grab his gun.
“He’s added to the list. Anything else, darling?” Crowley asked. “Want to be his warden or something?”
Reid’s eyes widened as he started hyperventilating.
They all looked at each other before chugging the glasses in their hands.
“Thanks, Rowena,” Dean said.
Dean moved the chair in front of him and sat down. Sam glared at his brother.
Sam closed his eyes and tried to distract himself from Reid’s pleading.
“Tell your aunt. I’ve met her, she wouldn’t victim blame anyone, especially not you,” Dean said.
Sam blinked his eyes and jumped when he realized he was in the trunk of a car. He struggled against the ropes around his wrists.
“What now?” Castiel asked.
“What?” Sam and Cas asked at the same time.
“So stubborn,” Rowena said to herself.
“Are you?” Peter asked.
“He killed women years ago,” Sam said. “How do you not know this?”
Rowena turned back to Sam.
“What the hell?” Sam asked as he saw the wall open.
Their father had been homophobic for years, so Dean never mentioned himself being bisexual. He hid that part of him. Dean wanted to at least give Sam a beer for coming out but Sam had left before he got the chance.
“So? I wanna know what’s in the basement,” Dean said.
“Well you still got a few minutes before we hit the university so take that nap if you want,” Dean said.
“What?” Reid asked. “I…I don’t want a tattoo.”
“Oh. Right,” Sam said. “Can’t this wait till morning?”
“Fuck,” Dean said before grabbing his phone. “Here goes nothing.”
Jimmy stared at Dean, who backed away slightly in the rolling chair he was sitting in.
Sam immediately started mumbling through the gag. Walt smirked.
“Special Agent Aaron Hotchner,” Hotch answered.
“Kid, where are you?” Bobby asked.
“Why do you care?” Sam asked.
“Just relax,” Derek said. “Are you okay?”
“God this is so fucking weird,” Dean said to himself in a whisper.
“Should we call his team now or wait?” Sam whispered to Dean.
“No,” Garcia said before putting her head down on the table. “Nothing. I’m such a failure.”
“CAS? The bees?” Sam asked with a confused look.
“Hospital?” Reid asked.
“Taking blood off of your hands takes time,” Dean retorted with a glare.
“Thank you. I do really like it a lot myself,” Castiel said as he put his shirt back on. “What tattoo would you get if you ever got one?”
“What?!” Dean yelled before seeing Sam visibly shaking. “Hey, hey, listen to me. You’re gonna be fine. Because all of our friends are dead and we’re fine now.”
Reid twitched. His room? Did that mean they were keeping him? Reid’s theory of the Winchesters inducing Stockholm syndrome in their victims didn’t seem that far off now.
“Ooh, who pissed off Dean Winchester?” Crowley asked with a smirk.
“So, Cas…how’s it going?” Dean asked awkwardly.
“Okay,” Sam said.
“Getting kidnapped will do that to you,” Sam said before he collapsed on the couch.
“Hotch, I’m okay,” Reid said, his voice having a tinge of anxiousness to it.
“Yes. One Sam Winchester, also officially dead,” Garcia said from the chair.
“Next time you don’t accept a ride from me, I’ll be ignoring you and giving you a damn ride,” Derek said.
“Reid’s told me about the Winchesters before, Hotch. He says that he hasn’t found any M.O or consistency,” Derek said. “He’s studied their case files before when he’s bored.”
“About the bot,” Sam said.
"Dean?" she called back to him, the object of her - less than pure - thoughts, resting her hand on his left shoulder to catch his attention. He snapped his eyes open, aiming his gaze into Castiel's confused, damn blue one. She breathed hard through her nose, trying not to get caught up in the myriad of sensations snaking through the inside of her body. "Cas, we've talked about this before, personal space," he said, through clenched teeth, espousing and nudging him lightly with a shove. "Dean." he repeated, Castiel, this time in a firm tone. He didn't understand what had happened to the hunter, didn't understand that cold tone he was using towards her. And, damn it, he also didn't understand why she had been treating him like a mere sex object for the past few months. Their relationship was public, yet the Hunter seemed damned interested in hiding it, muddying it, almost disowning it.
He was tied with his hands against his back, in a stiff and uncomfortable position, his eyes closed, his face bowed where an expression of pain could be clearly read. "P-please..." he whispered, before being touched gently on the source by Castiel. The angel's fingers were cool against the boy's skin, sweating from the effort of breaking free and the stinging pain. A trickle of blood sprang from the corner of his mouth, his lip split, his cheekbones swollen. Within moments, the pain ceased completely. The face came back clean, showing the features of what was barely a twenty-year-old. The features marked, framed by two dark eyes, full of unshed tears. Sam, behind the boy's back, freed his wrists constricted and sawed off by the ropes, Dean watched the distant scene, still stiff, and sore from the confrontation. He watched Cas insistently, as if trying to grasp the thoughts of the other, still far too enigmatic for him. A tremor of jealousy shook him when he saw the veneration with which the boy looked at his fiancé.
The angel snapped his eyes open, jamming them into the other's bloodshot, damned green ones. A new flame had ignited in him, pure desire, but a desire he'd never felt in his life. Dean's hand moved slowly from his side-which he'd been gripping until moments before-and brought it gently to the other man's face, caressing the profile and grazing the parted lips. He ran his thumb over his lower lip, tasting by touch the soft, erotic texture of those swollen, red buds. Castiel, still entranced by her gaze, shifted it slightly away from his body, giving him the space he needed to move downward. He slowly slid downward, his back rubbing against the wall behind him, a faint sound that became the soundtrack to that erotic encounter. He rested his knees against the damp asphalt, the cold that normally would have stiffened his muscles, did not scratch the angel - because he was an angel of the Lord, a soldier of God - he raised his face towards his companion, a gaze full of expectation that cast itself in an immense and endless blue. Awkward, because he was still not very expert in certain practices - but Dean actually thought he was the best of his lovers - he moved his hands toward the belt of his pants, unfastening it and leaving it dangling against his hips. He unbuttoned his pants lavishly, button after button glimpsing the fabric of the other man's underwear. He forcefully lowered the boy's pants and underwear in a gesture of impatience, leaving them rolled up around his ankles. He stroked the Hunter's turned-up thighs, in a slow caress that tasted like torture. "Fuck, Cas, hurry up," hissed, Dean, his head already thrown back by those pleasurable caresses - just a little, too little. "Or what?" he murmured, Cas, his face inches from her crotch. He distinctly felt fresh breath settle on his member, turgid and flushed. A murmur escaped his lips, his legs limp, desire clouding his mind. He roughly grasped the Moor's head, ran his hands through his locks, and looked at him with defiance and desire. He wouldn't have gone any further if Castiel himself didn't desire him, and Dean knew - felt - that Castiel desired him as much as he did, perhaps - perhaps - even more than he did. He parted his lips, his thumb now trapped between his teeth, and they looked at each other, in a constant challenge. One provoked, the other answered. Castiel didn't need to read his protégé's mind to know exactly what he was thinking, for that desire - coursing through his veins - was similar for both. With his gaze still fixed in Dean's eyes, Castiel let his fingertip free, letting it guide him meekly toward the Hunter's sex. Silky skin rubbed against cracked lips, only to be almost completely engulfed in his mouth. Dean watched wide-eyed as his own erection disappeared between the boy's lips, feeling the sweet warmth of his mouth invade him. He could clearly feel his tongue moving slowly against his flesh, drawing small concentric circles and running the perimeter of his prominent veins. He didn't look away for a moment, reveling in the excited, languid gaze Castiel gave him in response. His hands tightened on her body - one on the base of her sex, the other against her buttocks - in an attempt to keep him from pulling away, to get more into her mouth. Dean bit down hard on his hand, clenched into a fist, as his pelvis moved propelled by an unseen force. His hips swayed back and forth, creating a magnificent friction.
"I'll have to remember to make you jealous more often," Cas murmured, after cleaning them both up. Dean gave him a look of irritation, at the thought of Cas hitting on others. "Don't you dare, I was one step away from killing that kid," he muttered, before he felt Castiel's lips - which perhaps still bore his taste - settle on his own in a full-on kiss. "You don't want to brave the wrath of an angel of God, Dean. We're soldiers, I can be far crueler than that," and for a moment the other man's words tasted like a promise.
"Cas" found himself sighing, against his own will. His mind was totally clouded with a desire he had never felt before. He remembered clearly the kiss he and the angel had exchanged the night before. And he remembered well his own escape as well. He mentally called himself a fool, because never in his life would he have thought he could be so dumb as to run away from such a situation. "You are mine," Castiel had told him, his voice hoarse and his gaze hard, serious. Caught up in the confusion he hadn't given any weight to that phrase, deciding instead to provoke him. Dean was his, he knew it, he felt it, and in his heart he had been aware of it since the first time he had seen him. But what did that phrase really mean to the angel? Trying to understand Castiel's thoughts had always proven difficult for him, but in this case he had no idea how to interpret it.
At that point, it was a race to the finish line. The bumpy thrusts, the moans, the "please, harder" meows from Cas, all led to only one thing. The orgasm caught them unprepared, one moment they were insulting each other, and the next Dean had poured every last drop into Cas as he inhumanly charged and came hard in the Hunter's fist. They settled hastily, their movements excited and their bodies completely shaken.
They had returned to the motel together, each one gathered in his own silence made of melancholic thoughts. Distracted, each in his own world, they didn't say a word to each other during the trip, and even when they arrived in the suit of the motel they seemed to be floating in a reality they didn't know. "I'm going to go buy something to eat" Dean said mechanically, feeling the urgent need to get out. Air, he needed air. Getting his breath back seemed so difficult, he wondered if he hadn't been apnea all that time. He was walking fast, as if someone - or something - was chasing him. It was probably because of the panic attack that he felt was imminent. He reached the drugstore near the motel where they were staying, trying to regain control of his body and mind. He grabbed several snacks - he didn't even try to pretend to be interested - his eyes downcast to hide the pain and torment he felt inside, and threw everything on the counter, with little grace. He didn't even glance at the cashier, grabbing a handful of bills from his back pants pocket. "I'll pay for these, and a pack of cigarettes," he said, half-heartedly, waiting until he saw the pack appear and could get out of there. "What brand?" the cashier asked, listlessly.
He noticed a bench nearby, deserted, and sat down with little grace. He took the pack of cigarettes, lit one, and began to smoke it greedily. Immediately the bitter taste of nicotine invaded his mouth, entering his lungs with force. Without realizing it, he finished it in a few puffs, finding the stub still burning in his hands. He threw it to the ground, without care, and immediately took another one. It was all very quick: the flame of the lighter went out in a second, a stormy wind arose, and he distinctly heard the deafening sound of festive bells.
"She was still human, and she decided to give herself one last earthly pleasure, before shoving that angelic broom up her ass you all have," he growled, contemptuously. It was impossible, inconceivable to him that Castiel, the angel, the soldier of God, would be there to lecture him about a one-night stand. Anna and Dean had met at the moment when they were both broken inside. Two broken souls, alone, unable to express their pain to others. And they had kept each other company, loved, if only for one night. Dean had allowed himself to wade in, to really look, laying bare all his insecurities, his fears, his pain and torment that wouldn't let him be free. Physically he was on earth, breathing, living, yet a part of himself was still confined there, in Hell. Not only in dreams, even when he allowed himself to let go for a moment, he remembered what had been inflicted on him and what he himself inflicted on other damned souls. And he liked it. He had washed away his pain with sin. Sin that would never leave him. His soul was soiled, dirty, filthy. He had no chance to redeem himself.
