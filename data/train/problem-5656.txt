"It's just, I have to go away to Malibu. Apparently there's some emergency stuff going on at HQ there that I need to take a look at and Pepper already flew ahead and Peter's usual nanny isn't available and you're literally the last person I can ask."
"I- Yeah! That'd be great! I'm really looking forward to tomorrow then. Get to hang out with my two favorite boys."
"It comes with the jolly season." Tony shrugged.
"Hi daddy," Peter greets his father quietly and Tony looks down at his son to see his doe like eyes wide open and a sleepy smile on his face.
"Not bad," says Steve as he smiles down at Tony who takes his coffee back with a huff.
"Hey, it's going to be fine, Pete," Natasha reassures him, running her fingers through his hair soothingly. "We're all here to help out and make things easier for you. We miss your dads too, but take this as a learning experience."
"No worries, we'll catch up some other day over dinner if you'd like," Sharon says and Tony is two seconds away from kicking her out of the tower.
"Please," Tony says in a much calmer voice as he walks over to where Steve is now pouring him his favorite drink in a mug that looks very much like the one he's always drinking from.
"Hi dad, uh, just wanted to say that I uh love you and all. And that I miss you... A lot. It's been a few days and I still can't believe it happened, you know? Just take care of yourself and-"
Tony smiles tiredly and for the first time since Loki left, sleeps peacefully through the night.
"Well you're the doctor here, what do you recommend we do? He's not eatin' on his own and he doesn't let anyone else feed him," Bucky asked the doctor who sighed.
"Tony, you barely helped. What could you possibly be tired about?" Steve asks in complete amusement as he plops down next to his boyfriend who stretches his legs out until his toes brush against the coffee table. Steve holds back the coo that wants to escape when he notices that Tony can't quite place his legs on the coffee table.
"Oh man up. They're always doing things for you," Sam informs the teen who wrinkles his nose. "Besides, you'll be the one to take care of them once they're old, so start practicing."
Morgan nods and settles back again, looking up at Steve who gives her a small smile back.
"Heard that, kid," Bucky grunts out, glaring playfully at the teen while the other two kids started giggling uncontrollably. "Anyways, we're here to take the kids to their room."
"I wanna watch Dragons!" Steve tells Peter and Tony wrinkles his tiny button nose as he rests his head on Peter's shoulder.
"This isn't high school," Natasha scolds her best friend with a roll of her eyes. "And they've been together for a month."
"More like a big baby," Stephen retaliates with a smirk. "You're my boyfriend, I love you and I'm going to be by your side no matter the circumstances. Whether you're sick or in the infirmary again with broken bones, I'm with you. For as long as you'll have me." Stephen smiles softly as he brushes back Tony's curls before tucking him in bed.
"Am not mean!" Steve screeched and oh boy, this was getting out of control.
"You were fifteen minutes late for Starbucks?" Steve asked incredulously and Clint Barton, who sat in front of them with their friend Natasha Romanov, snorted and turned around to face the pair.
"Two painkillers about an hour ago."
"Hey buddy, have a nice nap?" Peter asks as he picks him up and places him on his lap. Tony nods and leans back against Peter's chest. "Is Steve still asleep?" Another nod. "You want to help me with my homework?" Another nod. Okay then, not so talkative today.
Tony pouted and looked down at his plate which was still a little more than half full, but said, "me too!"
"So you're saying if Cap ever goes missing, we can replace him with you?" Clint asks excitedly and Steve glares at the archer who's laughing.
hopefully i can have more consistent updates with this story, especially now that i ended up adding more chapters so yeah, that's what i've been doing all quarantine aside from watching Grey's Anatomy and movies😂😂
The teen looks over and finds two sets of large eyes staring at him curiously, bread crumbs around their mouths and Tony leaning forward on Steve's lap to better look at the sixteen year old.
Getting out of bed with a grumble, Tony grabs the first shirt he found and a pair of joggers, both articles of clothing being too big on his smaller frame. He didn't care, he just wanted to yell at whoever was out there to shut the fuck up because he was tired and wanted to go back to sleep.
Stony
"What?" Steve asks dumbfounded, brain not yet able to register what Toni just said.
Steve wakes up to the sound of soft crying from beside him. He frowns slightly and tries going back to sleep, but then he remembers that he's sleeping next to his baby and his eyes fly open in alarm thinking his baby was hurt.
"Steve-o. My giant teddy bear," Tony calls, trying to rouse Steve from his sleep but the man simply lets out a small sigh and the genius can't help but giggle."Wakie wakie eggs and bakey!"
"My friends!" Thor shouted excitedly as he stepped into the room and Tony flinched which made Steve move towards him instinctively and Peter turned to shush the God of Thunder, vaguely noticing the distance now between Bucky and Loki who'd made a book appear out of nowhere. "I apologize, but I do recall tonight being a movie night? Perhaps our young companions would like to chose tonight's movie?"
"Pete, darling, I told you you were meeting Steve and you can't do that if you don't come out and see him. It's rude, baby boy," Tony reprimands the child gently but still left no room for arguments in his voice. "Say hi."
"Hey, it's no problem, but the punk probably fell asleep and he can sleep through pretty much anythin'," Bucky explains to Tony as he starts to unlock the door. "And I doubt the mini you would open the door."
"I wan' Pe'er," comes Tony's soft voice as he reaches for the teen who definitely can't say no to that cute little face.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Guess little Tony still has big Tony's bad eating habits," Clint says with a slight snicker as he reaches over for the toddler's leftovers to eat them.
"Hey Tones," Steve greets his boyfriend of three months after opening the door of his apartment, smile not even faltering when he noticed the three year old in said boyfriend's arms with his face tucked into Tony's neck.
The two play in the sand for awhile with the bucket and shovel that laid there until two other boys older and bigger than them approached the toddlers with a scowl. Tony looked up at them with wide frightened brown eyes and moved closer to Steve who too looked up and glared at the older boys as best he could. It certainly helped that he was taller than Tony and could easily pass of as a five year old.
"Hi S'eve!" Peter greets the blonde, waving a sticky hand out at his father's boyfriend who laughs and sets his box down before going over to crouch down in front of his two boys.
Tony takes the cup reluctantly and drinks his milk leaning completely against Peter who keeps eating with one hand while his other arm was around the three year old. Steve began to eat, satisfied that his baby would have something in his belly before bed. Conversations were had around the table, though it wasn't the same without Tony's sassy commentary or Steve's fond sigh.
"Oh please, as if Loki would actually help us," Clint says with a scoff and Bucky grins over at the archer.
"Alright kids, have fun," Peter tells the two toddlers once they reach the park.
"We finished early and I really needed to see my boys," Tony tells him as he leans over to kiss Steve's cheek. "And Bucky let me in. The world could be ending and you'd probably never know." Steve chuckled and rolled his eyes. "So I see everything is good between you and Pete? No more awkwardness?"
"He's gonna love you. You've got nothing to worry about. He's just a shy kid and it takes him a bit to warm up to new people so don't take it personally."
Tony cried and cried each and every time Peter went to either put him down on the couch or hand him off to Bucky.
"Sass," Tony mumbles, lips twitching up into an involuntary smile, unable to stay mad at his idiot boyfriend for long.
"A tower!" Steve exclaimed as he looked up at Peter, a block on either hand. "My baby help. He a good help."
Surprise Sunday Update !!
"You guys think Tony is still moping around?" Clint asks teasingly as they head towards the communal floor around lunchtime after getting back from SHIELD.
The morning is easy and peaceful and it makes Peter glad to have missed school that day when he hears the toddlers' sweet giggles or gets to play with them. It's all fairly easy, up until around lunchtime when both kids are getting tired and cranky and are in desperate need of a nap. That's when Peter regrets staying.
They move to the balcony once there's sixty seconds left on the clock, all of them bundled up to brace themselves for the cold. Steve and Toni stand close together with his arm around her waist as they stare off into the busy New York City nightlife.
"Well as fun as roasting Thor is, the little ones need to take their nap," Natasha announces as she stands up with Steve in her arms, making the tiny blonde start to whine and reach out for anyone willing to rescue him. Unfortunately for him, no one does because Nat is scary and they do not want to anger her.
"It's okay. Now, my room is right next to yours, remember?" Peter asks the blonde who nods enthusiastically. "So smart." Steve smiles with a slight blush to his chubby cheeks. "Okay, you two need anything at night, you can have JARVIS wake me up or Bucky."
"There's some issues with the letter T," Steve explains to his best friend who snorts as he too sits at the table with his own bowl.
Tony nodded as if to confirm Steve's statement and Peter couldn't help but to ruffle their hair, earning twin shrieks of laughter and tiny hands swatting his much bigger ones away. So Peter sits with them, helping Steve build a whole city now, until Loki walks into the room and Tony rushes over to the mage who smiles warmly and lifts the three year old up into his arms.
"Daddy wan's say bye," Peter says quietly as he walks over to Steve a few minutes later, holding the phone out shyly and averting his gaze every few seconds and it only makes Steve want to hug the child and squeeze him to his chest.
It's that same Saturday around lunchtime when Thor returns with a grumpy looking Loki who suppresses a smile when his eyes lock with Bucky's and Peter has to hold back the eye roll he wants to give the two idiots.
"I done!" Steve announced awhile later before climbing down from his seat and rushing off to go play.
"Gee, I wonder why," Tony snapped, still glaring and his arms now crossed across his chest hoping to warm himself up a little bit.
"Does he really miss Loki so much as to go and find his twin?" Clint asks him and Natasha quietly as he stares between Tony and the woman.
"Stevie, that's enough. We don't want to wake up baby now, do we?" Bucky questions the blonde who immediately stops crying at that, looking at Tony with wide frightened eyes as he waits to see if the toddler will wake up. "Now finish your dinner so we can get you and baby to bed. And Pete, knock it off."
Peter looks up at the others who nod and so the teen hands off his dad (wow isn't that weird) to his pops (yeah that's not awkward at all) who hugs Tony to his chest and the smaller child happily cuddles into the blonde, closing his eyes and relaxing completely. Peter watches with wide eyes, surprised that even as kids their bond was still so strong and Steve was still so protective of Tony.
"Go back to sleep, my love," Loki replies in a gentle voice as he lays down in his usual spot and Tony immediately latches on like the octopus he likes to be. "I have you, my sweet Anthony."
"That's cause he is. And Pete's in close second."
"I don't find this situation amusing, Steven," Tony grumbles angrily.
"Brother," Thor reprimands his younger sibling for being so direct and Peter doesn't like that option so he'd rather deal with two snotty toddlers for a few more days.
"Maybe, maybe no." Peter shrugs and then proceeds to giggle again which makes Steve laugh and wrap one arm around the three year old.
"Wouldn't mind a little vacation."
Peter places Tony down on the bed gently, in the center with enough space for Steve who's brushing his teeth in the bathroom and with pillows on the sides so they, hopefully, won't roll off and fall. Tony shifts on the bed, mumbling something in his sleep as he turns into his side.
"You're not hungry, Tony?" Peter asks the three year old in his arms who shook his head again and yawned.
as he makes grabby hands at the brunette boy who's still covering his ears and shaking in Peter's hold.
"-and a half," Steve piped up indignantly, earning a soft little giggle from Tony.
"Back so soon?" Bucky asked them, half amused and half concerned.
"He's dating Loki, of course they're obscure," Clint pitches in with a roll of his eyes.
He typed the text then shut the phone without sending it.
The group was in Toni’s basement. There was liquor and laughing. Toni was sipping at a lemon-water, no longer pretending to drink. Tonight they were going to tell everyone. It had been five days since the doctor. Every day, he excitement grew. She kept the printout of Snoot’s ultrasound on her at all times, looking at it at every chance she got. Her Snoot. Her baby.
"So we're all just accepting the fact that Loki is also a girl?" Clint asks a little hysterically as he looks between Natasha and Steve who shrug.
"Baby? You okay?" Steve asks as he tries looking at Tony, eyes trying to adjust to the soft blue light coming from a corner of the room.
Clint nearly spat out his drink at that last statement and even Natasha had to bite her bottom lip to keep from laughing. Peter didn't whether to aww or cry because this just really reminded him of how his adult parents asked and boy did Peter miss them an awful lot. He could really use a hug from them, but he supposes there's a perk to having them be tiny sized. He gets to cuddle both all the time and they're easier to hold and they don't embarrass him like his grown up dads do during every movie night with the team.
"Well sorry to burst your bubble, sour patch," Toni informs her best friend, giggling knowingly to herself as she snuggled impossibly closer to Steve.
"It's a pleasure to grace you all with my presence," Tony replies with a smirk and the students snickered.
Steve and Tony deciding to move in together despite their relationship still being so new
"Thanks, jerk."
"I'm not a dog and Steve and I agreed to keep things between us for awhile. Kissing him in front of so many people is bound to get leaked to the press somehow," Tony states bitterly.
"What is it?" Steve asks with a worried frown on his face that has Toni laughing.
"My niece went through this same phase where she didn't eat much until her pediatrician recommended they try those drinks for kids that contain all the necessary things they need to help them grow and stuff," Sam suggested and Natasha had JARVIS place an order on the drinks.
"I know this is a lot to ask and shit-" "Bad word," Peter mumbles sleepily. "-but kinda really need a big favor from you that you are totally allowed to say no to, by the way," Tony rambles on nervously, not even phased by Peter's brief interruption.
"Did you have fun at Steve's, Peter Panda?" Tony asked his son as he drives them back home, the child sitting happily in his car seat and making his plush panda bear dance across his lap.
"I hate this family," Steve mumbles after overcoming the shock of the situation and heads further into the kitchen to cook something for lunch.
"I'm starting the new year with the best news I've ever received in my life," Steve begins to explain. "We're having a baby!"
"I think this belongs to you," Natasha says oh so very casually as she grabs Steve's hand with her free one and basically hands Tony over like a forgotten jacket. "Please don't lose him. We can't get another Tony anywhere else."
"And just before the day ended too," one of the nurses speaks up as she looks away from the clock. "Made it just before the clock struck twelve."
Steve immediately stopped mid conversation to look at them, his eyes landing on Tony's and expression immediately going soft. For a moment Tony even stops brooding, but then Sharon just has to open her big mouth to get Steve's attention back on her and he's just really close to grabbing Steve by the neck and making out with him right then and there.
part 1
"Lo?" Tony mumbles sleepily and cold fingers brush the hair from his forehead back and away from his face.
Now, Steve hadn't met the little boy yet, Tony had wanted to wait to make sure things were more solid between them before introducing Steve to the most important person in his life, but Steve had seen enough pictures and videos of the child to conclude that Peter was just Tony in child form. From the large doe eyes to the love of building things, the two were basically the same person. And as much as Steve had been dying to meet the three year old, he never pressured Tony because he knew that if things turned sour between him and the genius that it could leave an impression on Peter if the two met.
"Sure, what is it?" Stephen sat on the edge of his boyfriend's bed and took one of the man's hands in his.
Steve looks up when they walk in and makes grabby hands at Tony, scowling until Natasha sets the other three year old on his lap. They watch as Tony breaks his piece of bread in half and offers it to the blonde who gladly takes it and starts eating.
"Uh I hope you don't expect me to give them a bath," Peter comments as he stares between the two adults with wide eyes.
"Just- can we finish this assignment? It's due at the end of class."
Thor snorts as he moves to sit at the island while Steve and Natasha share a look that borders on relieved now that they know that they didn't in fact catch Tony making out with a strange woman while his boyfriend was away.
"There's a fucking reason why we have a communal floor, assholes! Some people don't like being woken up at ungodly hours!" Tony shouts angrily as he steps into the kitchen where he finds Steve and the rest of the team sitting around the table, all of them looking at Tony with various mixed looks of surprise and shock. "Some of us actually work you know and I like to take advantage of my one day off."
"Is it too soon to say that I love him?"
"Your idea of a prank is pretty obscure," Natasha reprimands the genius in a soft tone, lips twitching into an amused smirk.
Dealing with the pregnancy itself, not so easy. Toni was miserable most of the time. Her favorite foods made her sick, she was constantly crying over one thing or another and not to mention all the other unfortunate side effects like heartburn, swollen everything really, many sleepless nights and the constant beating her insides took and then her leaking and sore nipples. It was all unpleasant but she'd definitely do it again.
"Okay."
Tony let Steve take his hand and lead him back to their spot with Peter who was busy building Avengers Tower. Peter watched Bucky sit next to Loki from the corner of his eye, the two men sitting close together and Loki lowering his head with hide a smile. Bucky's metal hand found it's way to Loki's thigh, but before he could see the mage's reaction, Peter was pulled back into playing with the toddlers when Tony asked for more red blocks.
"Shut it, Buck," Steve tells him, face turning even redder if possible. "Well since you're up, want some coffee?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not taking it personally, but it's a little unsettling and you know I'm not great with kids either," Steve confesses with a slight frown, looking at the TV where the show's ended and is now showing commercials.
Steve takes Tony's hand and the two run off towards the sandbox while Peter himself sits at a bench where he can see them.
"You my baby."
When he enters the living room, he finds Tony sitting on the ground crying while an angry looking Steve stands above him with the doll held over his head and all of the toy cars scattered around the floor.
Halfway through dinner, Peter looked down at his lap and realized that Tony had fallen asleep with the cup still held to his lips and one hand curled loosely around it. Peter smiled fondly and leaned down to press a kiss to Tony's forehead and it wasn't even a second later when Steve leaned over to kiss him too while sending Peter a small glare that had half the table snorting in amusement while Peter kissed Tony's head again just to further anger his blonde tiny dad.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sensitive.” He whined, squirming on Steve’s lap. Steve cooed in sympathy but didn’t stop his ministrations.
“Clint will you get two chairs with our lunch ready please, I’m going to carry Tony in now.” He also needed to tuck himself back into his pants. Clint wide-eyed look at his cock was beginning to make him uncomfortable.
“Awh uncle Bruce, did Mama and Papa put you up to that?” Peter asked, before realising what he said. “Not- Not that I don’t like them, because I love chocolate covered raisins. They’re the best kind of raisins, not that I’m allowed them because you know Dad and Papa are health nuts but that’s fine as well but I really love sweets so thanks uncle Bruce for trying. You’re  the best though.” Peter babbled nervously.
“Mama, are the cameras going to be here?” He hated them which was why he was kept out of the limelight for so long.
Tony nodded, “Yes they do and they all know that I am your parent. That’s for your protection Pete. You need changes during the day, bottles, naps, all that stuff. You can still go to college after if you want, and then you can work for Stark Industries. You’re already down as an employee because you like to help out so much in the lab. None of this has been taken away from you, it’s just changed the priorities in your life. I know it doesn’t look ideal right now but this is for the best. “ Tony was silent while he tipped Peter’s head back and washed the shampoo out, Peter contemplating everything he told him.
He put a point in the pro column for the little spider-man that he could see sewn into the headrest. It looked like he was mid swing, one small hand holding onto some web.
Steve didn’t talk until Peter was completely relaxed against him. Willingly cuddling into him now that his scent was in his nose.
It was too difficult to comprehend that he was in the same world but a completely different world at the same time.
Peter threw a beaming smile over to Harley, even more delighted he was here. He picked up the pace and rushed the two of them back to the car, not even protesting when he had to get into his seat even though Harley got to sit up the front. He did blush at Harley’s comment on it though.
Peter made a token protest every time but if it made him feel better that Peter sat in this seat, then he would do it.
“I asked you a question. Does it feel good?” He asked once more. Clint nodded jerkily, still pinching hard.
Tony looked over to Bruce, mortified as he was bouncing on Steve’s cock.
Steve was going to defend himself against his little one but before he could hear another cry from the buggy. Bucky was awake, and by the sound of his wail, he was not one bit happy.
“Peter, you don’t throw things!” His Mama scolded.
That seemed to stop Bucky for a minute. How was he supposed to answer that question? It was obvious that Peter was the big brother.
Tony pouted at him and it took everything in Steve not to give in. He needed to set this relationship up right from the start or Tony would have him wrapped around his little finger. The team already was, it was just by chance that Tony hadn’t noticed yet.
The rest of the team weren’t sure how to respond. Of course, Peter looked extremely cute, the brown ears matching the colour of his hair and sticking out from the top of his head while his top, jeans and boots were all the same shade of brown. Coupling that with his black nose it gave an adorable sight. Steve and Tony though, they looked as grouchy as the bears in the stories, clearly just dressing up because Peter wanted them to.
Peter just wanted to jump out of the car the minute it parked up and run to his Papa upstairs but he wasn’t able to undo the seatbelt until his Dad came around the car. He swung his legs impatiently until Harley and his Dad got out. He watched them laughing and joking while they got his bags from the boot. Peter narrowed his eyes, why would his Dad be so happy to be around Harley? Even keeping Peter in the car until they’d had their fun. He knew his Dad liked Harley more. Every time he came Peter always struggled to get his attention and was always exhausted by the time bedtime came around. Peter wiggled, wanting to get up to his Papa as quick as possible and away from the two of them ignoring him.
“We’ll talk about that tomorrow when Pete gets here. Until then, come here.” Steve clicked his fingers and pointed in front of him. Tony dragged his feet over, not happy with the way this was going. When he got in front of him Steve turned him around and took hold of the plug in him fucking it in and out of his wet hole while he undid the zip of his jeans with the other, taking his hard cock out.
Tony’s eyes narrowed at Steve, trying to figure out if he was lying. He turned back to Peter and cuddled him closer.
Tony supposed it was a good sign since he was footing the bill for him to attend.
Harley hugged him tighter. “Love you too buddy.”
“Who is the Alpha?” He heard Peter mumble against his neck.
“That’s because Mama wants to show him everything the both of you are working on and doesn’t want you to be bored while he does. You know Mama can’t keep an eye on you while he’s showing Harley things.”
“Here, use my phone to set it up. That way I won’t have to log in after, it’ll be ready to go.” Tony rolled his eyes but took the offered phone, letting it read his thumbprint to open it, throwing his other arm around Peter’s shoulders, bringing him in close so he could see the setup. “God forbid you have to type something.”
“Mama! He’s here!” Peter cried as if Tony couldn’t see Harley standing right there.
“Pancakes?” Peter asked since his parents seemed intent on looking into each other’s eyes.
“Did you miss me, bud?” He heard the amusement in his Dad’s voice.
“I call him Jamie?” That could be his own personal nickname for Bucky. No one else would be allowed to call him that.
“There you go, good boy. You better keep it that way for me.” He gave his cock one last stroke before letting go and unstrapping him from the bench.
Between the excitement of the day, the comfort of the car seat and the motion of the car, Peter was asleep within seconds. Tony waited until Peter’s small snores filled the car. “Do you think we baby him too much?” He asked.
The arms around him became heavier and Clint nearly purred in pleasure. He could hear Steve, or was it, Bruce? Talking about Omega drop and putting more pressure in the hold. He wasn’t sure what an Omega drop was but he could really get on board with this whole pressure thing. It was one of the best things he’d ever felt. He turned his head to the side so that it was resting against what he assumed was a chest. It didn’t matter who owned it though, once they didn’t stop holding him. If they stopped he was sure he would float away forever. He pressed himself closer in at the thoughts of it. Not wanting to go. It was a nice feeling but he had no control and this felt way better. Maybe he could stay here forever and Bruce wouldn’t have to test him and everything would be okay? Yeah. That would work.
He felt Peter shaking his head, which only confused him.
The second the doors opened Peter let go of Tony’s hand and walked away without looking at either of them, leaving the two of them staring at him.
“Tony, pasta.” Steve reminded him after a few minutes of Tony not doing anything but riding the dildo. Tony whined in response, opening his mouth for Steve to deposit some in. He was too busy at the moment.
“So I think we all know you’re a submissive Omega like Tony. That means you’ll benefit from the same type of traditional relationship like Tony and Steve a pursuing. It doesn’t mean that you’re limited to it but you’ll thrive in a relationship like that, just as Tony is. You have a clean bill of health and everything is looking fine. We will have to discuss how you were passing for a lesser Alpha but right now I need you to sign these papers to say that the test was completed to your satisfaction. There will probably be an investigation into the centre that put you as a lesser Alpha instead of Submissive Omega. Something like that is incredibly dangerous. You’re lucky Steve noticed it before you got sick.” Bruce chastised gently, making Clint feel guilty as hell over it. He signed the papers in front of him extremely slow to avoid looking at Bruce in the eye. He hated disappointing the scientist. He was the sweetest guy (after Tony) that he knew.
Peter came running back into the room and jumped into Steve’s waiting arms. He looked even more delicate in his Iron-Man swim shorts that barely reached mid-thigh. “I’m back!” He declared, his brows furrowing as he took a sniff of the air. “Why does it smell a lot like you, Steve?” He asked. Steve took a sniff of the air and could see where Peter was coming from. Steve’s scent was nearly overpowering.
“What was that about?” Harley asked, not sure why Peter’s mood changed so suddenly.
“So good sweetheart. We’ll wait out this knot then we’ll have some food. You can come as much as you want. I know how much you need it.” He murmured into Tony’s hair, kissing his temple before bending down and lightly biting his mating mark, sending Tony instantly into orgasm. Tony wailed with the force of it, sensitive after coming three times in such a short period of time.
Why do you have a booster? I’m in high school if anyone saw me on it would be social suicide.”  He complained.

Hey! This is another commission. Let me know what you think of this :) Comments and kudos are always appreciated. Also don't forget to follow me on twitter!
“Well done Bucky! I’m just going to look through this for a minute and then I’ll be back. Tony if you could get his sleeper off and push his diaper to the side a bit. I’ve learned to do it quickly is the best route to go.” Cho took the papers she was filling out during the exam and left once again, leaving the family of four.
“Mama, paci.” He requested. If he was doing this stupid exam he was going to be as comfy as possible doing it.
“Clint has been lying about his classification. He’s not a lesser Alpha like we were lead to believe.” Bruce, Bucky, and Tony’s head’s all whipped to Clint. Bruce and Bucky stared on in shock while Tony spluttered out questions.
“I’m not!” He repeated, more firmly, making sure his Mama understood.
Steve kissed his forehead and placed him so that the dildo was suctioned firmly to the seat below him. “Off you go sweetheart.” He said, sitting down beside him. Tony needed no more encouragement and began to ride the dildo hard, ignoring the rest of the team around him as he did.
Tony threw up the peace sign and continued to follow his family ignoring the pleas of his teammates.
Bucky’s hand snuck down and gave his cock a quick pass over, his hand coming away sticky. “He’s leaking a bit more from just that. That’s good to know.” Clint shivered at his tone and tried to ignore his comment.  Bruce continued his exam, running his hands over his abdomen, checking for injury as he went down, getting the whole way to his cock without issue.
“Yes, it is. We call him Bucky because of his middle name, Buchanan.” Hmm, Peter kind of liked the names James.
Tony hung up the phone with a huff, that kid would be the death of him. Steve looked over his newspaper and grinned at his husband.
Steve shook his head before Clint could give his opinion. “Here, I can’t move with Tony on me at the moment. Friday, tell everyone to stay off this floor for the next couple of hours.”
Mostly Tony just loved watching the boys together.
Mama smiled his genuine smile. “I know I won’t.”
Only took me half a year to update but here you go! Let me know what you think! Comments and kudos are much appreciated!
Peter watched as Bucky rubbed his face against the blankey he was handed, his breathing still a bit ragged. They were just coming up to the front doors which were a good thing, Bucky was looking at Mama like he wanted him more than Daddy and was going to start crying again if he didn’t get him. Peter got that. His memories were still extremely muddled but one thing was clear. His Mama’s comfort was the best, Daddy made a close second but Mama just had that special touch. Peter did spare a thought to how his Mama would be able to lift Bucky but it was quickly dismissed. This worlds Tony Stark was a lot buffer than the other one, and weirdly enough Bucky was a lot slimmer, kind of like how Peter looked. He wondered if that was a little thing or it just so happened that they both looked similar.
Peter was shocked, he didn’t know that you could negotiate in a traditional relationship. It dawned on him that Steve told him that to show being in a traditional relationship wasn’t all just him laying down the law and he appreciated it, it did set his mind at ease a bit.
"Isn't that why we have JARVIS? So he can save us the-" Clint's cut off by a glare from the red headed spy. "Okay, we're going."
"I'll show you confidence later," Steve whispers in her ear and Toni grins as she turns to give her boyfriend of nearly four years a heated look.
"Have Banner and Lang been able to get anything from the alien tech?" Thor asks once the toddlers are gone and he and Loki take a seat at the table with the others, the blonde keeping a suspicious eye out on his brother and Bucky who are sitting next to each other.
It's over an hour later and Peter's working on homework when Tony wanders in rubbing at his eyes with his fists and Peter can't remember exactly when he stopped freaking out and started finding every little thing the kids did, cute.
"If I ask nicely, he will," Bucky reminds him with a suggestive wiggle of his eyebrows and the others make disgusted looks.
"The spooky what?" Steve asks in confusion.
"Stevie okay?" Tony asked the teen who sat on the grass next to Tony with Steve on his lap and crying into his chest.
"Naugh'y," Peter tells his father while waving a finger at him, making the two adults laugh.
"Okay, so I'll definitely be gone for at least a day, but I'll call once I know when I might be coming back," Tony begins to explain to Steve who's holding Peter up with his left arm while the child plays with the top button of his plaid shirt. "If there's an emergency and you can't get ahold of me, call Pepper or Happy. Peter's not allergic to anything and bedtime is at nine, don't let him convince you otherwise because he's a little shit."
love you all!!
Tony was not brooding no matter what Natasha said. And he was also not plotting a murder no matter Clint's excitement to help.
"But to protect the ones we love, we will do anything and you did a very brave thing by standing up to those big mean children." Loki tapped the toddler's nose and Tony giggled shyly, cheeks flushed an even brighter shade of red than usual.
Past Stony
"Peter, take a seat please," Natasha instructs gently, calm as ever, as she walks up to the teen and leads him to the couch where he sits next to the blonde kid who's still glaring at him.
He's not sure how much longer he can take of this situation. And not that the others didn't help, they did, but when Steve and Tony fought, it was best to keep them away from each other for the rest of the day. Thankfully though, Tony no longer cried when he went off to school and now that it was Saturday, he was just happy to have Peter at home all day.
“Okay. I think I can handle that then.” Tony snuggled back, content to ride out this knot, thinking about taking a nap while he waited when a thought suddenly sprung into his head and he shot back up.
“It’s not a baby seat Harley, it’s a Peter seat. Something designed just for him.” Tony cut Harley with his eyes, telling him to shut his mouth, and quickly. Harley glanced back at Peter and realised how distressed and upset he was getting by his crass comment.
Harley and Steve always found it hilarious and Peter was always innocently oblivious to it all.
“Okay, look, we’re leaving. You’re coming with me, baby. We’re going to see how Daddy and Bucky are doing okay?”
okay so I know I said it would be a long chapter but it was taking me forever to write it so I just posted this little bit. I promise next chapter will be a lot longer :)
Bucky nodded, “Yep, he thought that mouthing off to me before the two of you came over would do him any favours, as you can see it hasn’t. He’s got another ten minutes on that before he’s allowed off. I’m pretty sure he’ll be able to come at least twice more. I have faith in him.”
Peter didn’t like the sound of that. He wanted to go with Harley but he just knew it would be a no off all of them. Maybe Harley didn’t want to spend much time with him? He didn’t seem to be too interested in him right now. Even Dad was more interested in Harley.
“You. And your brother, but he was still pretending that he was neutral. We kept an eye on him and let him away with it until his other memories came in. You two were the last ones we were waiting on. You and Bucky took a lot of my time because the two of you needed me and Dada so much, we barely had time to think about what happened. When we finally did I realise that I was happy we were here. There was no stress, none of the fear about you getting hurt because Little’s are so protected here.” Tony held his hand up when Peter began to refute his knowledge. “Let me finish little man. I need you to know that you still go to school. All your memories from living in this timeline are still there you just haven’t searched for them because you were afraid to see.”
Peter began to panic the more he thought of his new life, and how unsure of everything he was.
“Don’t worry sweetheart, you’ll be able to come once I’m inside you. Remember your rule though.”
“It’s alright, I’ll take mini Stark with me. I haven’t seen him in a few weeks.” Bucky said.
“Best do it quickly or it’ll set Peter off as well.”
Peter bit his lip, unsure if he should ask, “ Well, I- Do- Do you…” he trailed off not sure how to ask. What if Dad got super annoyed at him? Or decided to ground him for asking? Peter’s breath began to speed up as he thought of the worst case scenario’s that could come out of asking. He hated asking things like this of his parents. They were so overprotective that it always leads to an argument.
“I don’t want you to leave.” Every word had to be chosen carefully. “I told you, when I thought you were dream Steve, that we needed to talk but that we’d do it after.”
Steve’s hand was hovering in the air as if he were planning on touching Tony but then decided against it.
“Will you marry me?”
@spidermanfanparker
“Yeah.”
Fluffy
“Whiner. Okay, fine. How about Cheep Cheep Beach?” Tony offered. Steve agreed that Cheep Cheep Beach would be easy enough to beat blindfolded.
“Do you remember what happened just before the kiss?” Steve asked.
I decided to play with the idea of a single day/event. Thoughts?
I’m proud of my partner. He is a brave man and a kindhearted soul.
“Baby mama couldn’t watch the tyke so you got stuck on babysitting duty?” Another said.
“Your mom is going to hate me,” Toni whined. She and Steve were sitting on the couch, waiting for Sarah to get home from work. Today was the day they told her. It needed to happen and Toni wanted to rip off the band-aid. Or, at least she thought that’s what she wanted until she was on this couch, getting ready for the conversation that would change her relationship with the only decent parental figure she’d ever known.
“Hey babe?”
“We haven’t had sex in a week and a half.” Steve’s whisper was so quiet, Tony wouldn’t have been able to ear it if he wasn’t just inches away.
Because Steve was gay. For a while, he identified as bisexual but when he had sex with Sharon Carter after homecoming, he realized that he wasn’t really into pussy. Not that it was bad, mind you. It just didn’t do it for him. Oh well. And the reason he had to keep Bucky a secret wasn’t because they were a couple (ew) but because Bucky was different. Steve Rogers needed to be absolutely not-different. Popular and clean-cut. People didn’t need to know he was anything but.
Captain America, aka Steve Rogers, calls Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, his “partner.” Would “friend and teammate” not suffice? Is there more to their relationship than they let on? PLUS: Is Stark’s ex, Pepper Potts, coming between them? [link]
“You’re still gonna love me even though I cried, right?” Sarah asked, whimpering.
, 2018.
Peter didn’t drink or smoke so Toni had taken to spending a lot of time with him. He wouldn’t question why she wasn’t doing anything of the sort because he’d probably assume she was doing it out of respect for him.
reply to @booksb4looks
biochemist of all biochemists, complimenting his bio-chem—was pretty much the best compliment he’d received in a long time. At least in the business sense—he turned to putty every time Steve complimented his eyes or something of the like.
“It’s... gone?” Steve croaked.
4/1/2018 10:34am
Suicide was such an ugly word. Suicide attempt was worse. When Steve came to in the hospital bed, Tony was asleep on a plastic chair next to the bed. Guilt flooded over him. How long had Steve been here, hooked up to these machines? How long had Tony said beside him, unmoving. Steve wasn’t a fool; he knew Tony hadn’t moved from that chair. It was a dance they did—whoever wasn’t the one with the near death experience waited in the chair by the bedside until the other woke up.
“I can’t ask Mr. Stark to--”
Tony threw the wrench down on the table and turned around. From where Steve stood on the other side of the glass, he wouldn’t be able to see into the workshop. Tony, on the other hand, had a perfect view of a smartly dressed pinnacle of human perfection.
@tonystark: plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
“You were waiting for my permission?” A warmth spread in Steve’s gut that had nothing to do with the sex that was currently about to happen.
“Never saw you at a loss for words,” Natasha whispered as the next speaker took to the podium. Tony had never seen the man in his life—he wondered vaguely if Steve ever had, either.

Next to his unmoving boyfriend.
“You really shouldn’t take the Lord’s name in vain,” Steve reminded as he walked to Tony’s bathroom. He returned with wet cloth and started wiping down Tony’s chest.
There was no point in trying to deny it. “Did you tell anyone?”
reply to @tonystark
“No. Stop asking and spend time—drift right—playing the game. Glide. Land. Coin. Okay, so have Bullet Bill. I’ll tell you when to—alright you’re doing it on your own, okay.”
“Tony.” Tony kneeled in front of Steve, taking one of the injured feet in his hand. Steve hissed when Tony’s finger brushed against one of the deeper cuts. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “You need stitches.”
“Look!” The picture was now wrinkled and folded. It didn’t stop Toni from shoving it in Pepper’s face the minute the door closed behind her and their session started. “It’s my Snoot.”
He could practically hear Tony rolling his eyes. “It’s going to be awhile. I’ll have to get James dressed and buckled into his seat.” Steve could tell that Tony was already in motion, getting ready to come down to the police station. “Where’s Sarah?”
“Pepper knew, too. I think,” Tony admitted. “We’d… talked about it in theory before it started, but then things started getting out of control and then and then and then… and now.” The floor to ceiling windows painted the picture of an overcast day. How fitting. “He hated days like this. Not peaceful like the rain, not invigorating like the sun.”
Please drop a comment or a kudos if you haven't already ;)
There was a ringing in his ears. He’d come up to the penthouse from work during lunch to say
guys. So when you or whatever algorithm messaged me, it seemed to be perfect timing.”
“I’m sorry.” Steve buried his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the smell of his boyfriend’s aftershave. Why had he even thought of killing himself when something this wonderful existed?
“Steven Grant Rogers, if you do not
“Hardy harr,” Tony deadpanned. Steve started to run his fingers through Tony’s hair, who smiled giddily and started moving his head against Steve’s hand, desperate for the comforting touch.
He was instructed to sit on the toilet while the man reached into a cabinet above his head. The stranger’s shirt rode up a bit and Steve couldn’t help but stare at the sliver of exposed skin—tan and smooth.
@jamesrhodes
“Oh, right,” Steve mumbled, reaching for his pants. “I didn’t think I’d make it this far, but I figured I’d be prepared.” He held up a tiny bottle of lube. “Do you know what to do with it?”
“My apologies, dear husband of mine,” he sassed. Steve stood and kissed the top of Tony’s head. “The massage offer lasts for about two more minutes. If you’re not back in bed by then, I’m coming and taking him away from you.”
@cptsteverogers: I know
The Catholic Church is sexist, homophobic, and racist. I firmly and thoroughly believe in God but do not mistake my belief in Him as an affiliation with what the Church stands for.
Kid-fic
“No, stay, please,” Tony begged. He’d beg to dream Steve. “Come back to bed. I love you.”
“Laura and the kids are worried,” she whispered, side glancing at Tony. “I can’t keep lying to them.”

“Don’t like baby brover,” Sarah muttered under her breath.
The SDATCSM is completely free, with 30-, 60-, and 90-day programs available. The purpose of rehab clinics should not be focused on financial gain, but instead being able to help people evolve from their harmful habits.
“Your last
Hoppy Easter, lol.
The doors swung open and they stumbled out. Tony led them to the bed, working open Steve’s pants as they went. Steve’s mind wandered to exactly how many people Tony had done this with, but shut it down. It didn’t matter. What mattered was that he was here, now, with Steve.
“It’s Cheep Cheep Beach! It’s all right!”
“Then I told you that I like having you as a friend and that I respect you.” Steve paused. “And then I told you that I wanted to kiss you. Do you know what you did?”
s, he believed Steve and repeated the same things back in earnest. Tony had not yet once lied to Steve.
“And where are you coming from?” Tony asked. He liked bantering with dream Steve. It felt natural. As if he were really here.
“Can I, uh, get in there?” Tony asked. “Are you ready?”
When Steve was fourteen, his parents got divorced. He wasn’t sure why it had taken them so long. They had nothing in common and didn’t seem to like each other very much. The process was long and annoying, but it didn’t feel like a burden on him. He was actually kind of glad that they were splitting; no more waking up at 3 am to them arguing over whose turn it was to sleep on the couch (dad’s; always dad’s).
It was the last lap. Steve was taking the final left to cross the finish line. For the third lap in a row, he hit the mud and skidded to a stop.
“Of course, baby.” Steve used the hand that wasn’t holding her up to wipe a stray hair off of her face. Blonde and fair, just like his.
Now he’d really gone and fucked it all up. Now he was more of a nut case than before. Now he was someone who had attempted to kill himself. He tried to imagine if it were Tony who had swallowed that handful of pills. Steve would have been furious, too.
Steve grinned. “I promise on my shield.”
reply to @spidermanfanparker and @tonystark
A few years back, Steve had convinced Tony to finally start taking his medication. It had made a world of difference. Their relationship thrived.
“My grandma is sick.”
Steve let out a short breath of air that Tony took to be a laugh. He watched with hungry eyes as Steve turned away from him, dropped the towel, and grabbed a pair of boxers out of the drawer. There was a hickey on his ass that Tony was quite proud of. He quickly grabbed his phone and snapped a picture before Steve had the chance to cover it with the underwear. Tony knew that by the afternoon, it would be gone.
“Sweetheart, please don’t--”
“Ooh, are you playing Clint’s Awesome Game That He Invented?” Clint asked, jumping over the couch.
“I went to see Rhodey,” Toni announced the moment she flopped down on Dr. Potts’s couch. She kicked off her shoes and put up her feet. “And I’m pretty damn proud of myself.”
“You also said you were going to slap real Steve. Me Steve.”
For the past fourteen months, I’ve pursued a passion project: The Substance Dependence and Addiction Treatment Center at Stark Mansion. I have converted my childhood home—a place of excessive substance abuse—into a rehabilitation center.
“Did you cum?” Steve asked. He didn’t sound judgmental. He probably did this for all sorts of people. God, he probably did this for old men who came just looking at him. For the first time since he logged on, Tony felt dirty.
Rhodey frowned. “I’m not sure. I think it’s just the thing you’re supposed to say in these situations.” Again, the smile was there and gone before it had a chance to manifest itself, but Rhodey saw it none the less. “I know, you know. You didn’t have to tell me. I don’t know how or when or how much, but I know.”
Doug asked for Steve’s blessing when he asked Sarah to marry him. Steve gave it because he didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t. Doug smiled and Steve went down on him.
It was then that Tony looked down to exactly what was following him. About a half mile behind him was the hearse, polished black and reflecting the flashing police lights all around it. There was a coffin in there. A coffin he would have to carry and be mindful of the American flag draped over it.
“Can you please shut up for once?”
to fuck Steve and cum inside of him.
Steve nodded. It was nice, not having to be awake during surgery. Or, what he figured had been a surgery, considering they didn’t send him to the hospital for much else these days.
“Oh, hey Cap. Kinda busy today.”
5/17/2018 4:57pm
“So, Tony, is there anything you want to watch me do?” Steve purred and Tony’s cock jerked. Why hadn’t he unbuttoned his pants yet? “Do you want me to stroke my cock for you? Do you want me to finger my asshole? Leave it wet and gaping? God, it would feel so good to have your big cock in my tight little asshole.”
“Hello, beautiful.” Steve’s eyes darted to the wastebasket and his cheeks reddened. “Thanks for cleaning up.”
“Just above the knee,” Tony whispered. “While you were asleep, I’ve been doing my research. I’ve invested in a few of advanced prostheses companies. I’ve also sent some of my ideas to them.”
“Toni!”
He loved Steve more than he feared him. Not that he feared him, per-say. More he feared for him. Over those first few months out of the hospital, Tony realized just how much Steve truly loved him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have put up with Tony when he was at his worst.
4/1/2018 10:33am
Tony’s thumbs were sore. They’d been at it for hours. His palms were sweating and he had a leg cramp that wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop. What’s more, he didn’t want to stop.
4/6/2018 11:46pm
Iron Man led the processional. At first he didn’t realize he was crying, simply thinking it was the rain obstructing his vision. FRIDAY took over, keeping the suit flying on auto-pilot, allowing Tony his moment. Nearing a bridge, Tony blinked away his tears long enough to see the hundreds of people waving a giant American flag on it. Regaining control of the suit, he saluted the crew and was met with mixed reaction. Some of them cheered, others swore, a few spit.
Peter sniffled, and wiped his eyes, nodding. He was a big boy, so he would be able to help Dada make his baby brother feel better. “Jamie needs my help?” He asked, pointing at himself to make sure that Dada got the point. Peter didn’t say it but he knew that his Dada needed help, because he wasn’t Mama.
Peter squinted his eyes at his Mama. He knew the suss, they were just tricking him into not kicking up a huge fuss since Bucky was pretty much melting down in the seat beside him. Peter sighed. Fine. He’d do it, but they’d owe him big time and better not get used to him being so accommodating.
Peter took off running through the penthouse to change. Usually, they would be naked but Steve wanted to make Peter as comfortable as possible. Next time maybe. He was sure the pup would see them naked throughout the next month, knowing how much he loves to crawl into Tony’s bed.
He looked back at his parents, delighted. “Dairy Milk! Four of them for me!” He all but shouted.
He was just about the leave the room when he caught sight of his Ironman plushie. He knew he should go out there by himself but he needed the extra support. Surely they wouldn’t think he was little because he had a plushie with him? He was only bringing him because it went with his T-shirt. His Mama and Dada couldn’t argue that.
Peter let out a little giggle at that. It was true, uncle Bruce could be found sleeping anywhere around the tower. They even had a bet going to see who found him in the weirdest place. Clint was currently winning after finding him in the vents once.
“No one sweetheart. They send an at home kit and you send the mould back. Clint is just talking before he thinks again. You know I wouldn’t let anyone touch me but you.” He soothed, running a comforting hand up and down his tensed stomach.
“Where’re my pants?” Peter asked, looking around the room. Papa and Dad wouldn’t let him see his costume after trying it on the one time because he most likely would have spent the whole month wearing it.
Clint
Let me know what you think of this chapter, comments and kudos are appreciated as usual
“Yes, Papa,” Peter said dutifully, biting into his sandwich.
It belatedly hit Peter that his Dad was driving them and hadn’t gotten Uncle Happy to like he usually did.
“What if he’s mean to me?” Peter had heard horror stories about Alpha’s taking on an Omega with kids. They were either pushed aside or abused. He didn’t want to be one of those kids.
“Looks like you gave yourself quite the bump but you’ll be okay. Now I think I promised one brave little boy a cookie did I not?”
“Hey!” Tony said indignantly, “You should be grateful to listen to me speak I have you know! Isn’t that right Petey?”
Their appointment wasn’t for another hour yet so they could afford to take their time getting the babies settled.
Peter hit send and then remembered his parents told him to let them know if he was going to put any personal information up so that they could discuss it first, did this count as that?
Comments and kudos are much appreciated!
“Mama, Do you-“ Peter cut off and took a breath before just going for it and asking. “Do you think I could have a twitter account?”
big! Peter was crying into Dada’s neck as he watched Mama walking up and down the street with Bucky who was still sobbing. They’d finally left the testing centre and were going for food somewhere. Peter just wanted to go home and sort out his wild emotions in peace.
“Keep going Stark.” Bucky rolled his eyes, which went wide in alarm when Steve’s other arm went around his waist to lift him slightly off the seat so that his bottom was exposed before he received a light swat on it.
DooDooDooDooDooDoo
Steve wanted to cringe even thinking about the amount of sugar Peter would consume. “I’m sure you will.”
Peter threw the last grape into the air and caught it, grinning at Bucky’s whoop of celebration. It was touch and go whether he got it into his mouth or not, today was obviously a good day since he caught it on the first go.
He thought the Harley should move in and be adopted by them because Peter saw him as a big brother and didn’t get that Harley had a mother and sister back in Tennessee to go back to.
“Glad to be of service.” He quipped, ignoring Clint’s pout at being outsmarted. This wasn’t their first time dealing with a tricky Omega. Tony had kept them all on their toes since they became a team. Now it just looked like they had one more to wrangle.
He gave his pacifier a sharp suck to work up the courage before telling him no, and yes. He knew that sucking on a pacifier probably will not help his case but there definitely has to be some magic to these things. It was the only thing that was keeping his nerves of waking up in a completely different world from imploding. Hmm, that put an idea in his head. He was in Mama’s arms. That gave him the leverage he needed to pull off his plan. Giving the pacifier one last suck he took it from his mouth and placed it into his Mama’s. It helped that his Mama’s mouth was open in laughter at Daddy fighting with the baby over the car seat. That should help calm him down while Peter pleaded his case. All Mama had to do was suck on it a few times and he’d say yes. Peter just knew it.
Tony followed his son at a leisurely pace and walked in in time to see him jumping into Steve’s open arms, Steve catching him as if he weighed nothing. “Papa! It’s time to get ready for trick or treating!” He laughed as Steve swung him around, Peter throwing his head back in delight.
“What? A Twitter account? What- Wh- Tony! Why are you letting our child go onto that horrible site!” Steve demanded, pulling Peter closer to him when he tried to make his way back to Tony.
“Good one Stevie.”
“Makin’ bubble bath for Jamie.” He mumbled, glancing at the bubbles that were starting to overflow in the bath. Peter looked at Jamie and saw that he had stopped crying, eyes wide as he looked at the massive amount of bubbles that were in the bath. “Look Dada, Jamie’s happy!” Maybe that would get him out of trouble?
Tony came to with the fire ripping through him once more. He’d come another four times before he finally passed out, not able to hold himself up anymore. His brow furrowed and he felt an emptiness inside. He must have slid off the dildo in his sleep, he tried to pick himself up and slide back onto it but a hand stopped him. He settled back down with a sigh before shooting back up. A hand shouldn’t be touching him! He was by himself when he passed out and he most certainly didn’t have a third hand.
“How about this, me, you and Papa will have a movie night tomorrow night. We’ll make some chocolate popcorn and watch whatever movie you want while Harley is out, that sound good to you?”
Peter’s face broke out into a smile when he saw it was his Dad.
“Yep, he sure is. He was just ringing to make sure I’d be there for when his plane got in. I’m going to have to collect Pete a bit early so we can get to the airport.”
“What a great name for your brother.” Mama praised, looking up from the questionnaire he was filling out, making Peter beam with pride. It made up for not being able to cuddle him. Sure Daddy was good at it but he lacked something Mama just had. He wouldn’t tell Daddy that though, it would hurt his feelings.
The easiest way to scent a pup was by rubbing up against them and licking them. Their tongues had scent glands in it that attached to the pup or mate when they were scenting. Steve began by letting out his scent and rubbing his head against Peters. Peter pushed back happily, even as he ignored Steve for the most part. Just handing his arm over or exposing his tummy when Steve began to bathe him in his scent.
Steve had only come right before they came down here so he knew he’d be fucking Tony for a while. The aim was two orgasms before he tied with him. Holding onto Tony’s hips he slammed into him again and again, enjoying the feeling of his tight heat surrounding him. He was so focused on riding Tony that he didn’t hear the lift doors opening until Bruce was nearly in front of them.
“He gets that from you.” Tony was quick to respond, doing Steve’s tie in a few quick movements.
“So, once Thanos clicked his fingers and half of the universe's population was gone we used what Strange told us to go back and destroy the stone before they ever became a thing. The only problem with that was with the soul stone, it seemed to have its own entity in it, from what we can assume is an accumulation of the souls that were trapped in there over the years for whatever reason.” He stopped and looked at the two, “Still following me?”
“Want to go over your training now?” He asked after a few minutes of lying in their post orgasmic bliss. Tony made a noise that wasn’t happy but he waved his hand for Steve to go ahead.
Steve blinked at the sudden question, looking down at Peter who was lying across the love seat on his phone. Steve knew that him getting Twitter was a bad idea. Peter never seemed to be off the phone anymore unless he or Tony decided that he’d had enough screen time.
“I do that?” Peter was amazed. He made Bucky be little and happy when he was trying to hide it. And Bucky is younger than him? That was so
“I think you’ll find that I am the coolest person there is. I was the one that spent a few years in the ice.”
Tony handed him a well-loved blanket when he was done, explaining. “This is Petey’s post scenting blanket. He takes a nap with it after.”
“I get that you’re upset Petey. This has been a big change for you. We were the same when he realised we remembered. Do you know the only thing that kept me going back then?”
Tony ran a soothing hand through Steve’s hair, “I know, but we can still monitor it and make sure he’s as protected as possible. Let Peter know that it makes you anxious and I’m sure he’ll understand. We have a smart kid.”
“How do you do that? I swear I breathe near them and they wake up but you just pick them up and move them without a single issue!” Steve said, exasperated.
“Happy is going to meet us at the end of the street. Let’s go before you have to carry him.” Tony lead the way to where he could see the Rolls Royce waiting at the end of the road. Steve took Peter’s hand again and followed more slowly behind Tony.
“It’s alright baby. Come over here and tie this for me?” He asked, holding the ties of an apron out to him. Of course, he had to be Mama bear, Peter made sure of it. Peter made quick work of tying the apron for Tony and came around so he could look at Tony in the same way Tony looked at him, squinting his eyes right back.
“You look fine and what’s the point of clothes if you start heating up again and need my knot?”
“Of course, boss.” Friday began the film and Peter was instantly hooked, letting Steve move him which every way he needed to scent him, letting out little purrs of contentment as he was bathed in Steve’s scent.
Steve spooned some more Pasta into Tony’s mouth when he was finally able to unclench, before responding. “Of course I will. I’m going to wait until he’s finished though otherwise I’ll spend all my time just wiping the floor.” Bruce and Bucky laughed while Sam and Natasha just shrugged, Clint looked nearly jealous but smiled tightly at the comment.
Papa looked at him and Bucky knew he wasn’t going to get what he wanted.
A quick look around confirmed his guess that he was in a buggy.
Predictably, Peter fell asleep, straight after having his snack. Tony glanced at him in the rearview mirror, as he took the turn to take them to the airport, smiling at how cute he was when he slept. Not that he wasn’t cute when he was awake as well but when he was asleep he wasn’t getting himself into trouble. Glancing at the clock he saw that they were still a half-hour out before Harley’s plane came in, which was good, he could let Peter sleep a little while longer. He was sure that he wasn’t going to go for his usual post-school nap when he got home, afraid he’d miss something with Harley.
Steve could smell him. It was all over the tower and it took everything in him not rush up to Tony straight away. Tony thought he didn’t know his cycle but Steve was keeping track of it for the past year. He needed to know his Omega was regular and Jarvis was more than helpful in letting Steve know when he began his heat. This time though, something was different. He wasn’t sure why he could smell Tony so much when normally it was muted at best. He was going to leave it maybe another half an hour before he made his way up to his Omega. He had planned to claim him today anyway, making sure the rest were out of the tower for today so he could properly claim his shy mate. Steve grinned thinking about the blush on Tony’s face when he mentioned that he was a traditional Alpha and he wanted Tony naked. He wasn’t sure why he was so embarrassed, Tony had an amazing body that would look beautiful with just the jewellery Steve gave him. He was sure though after his heat with Steve he’d be a lot more open to Steve’s more traditional ways. There would also be training but he could get that after his heat. Right now he needed to knot and cuddle his Omega. Grinning Steve looked at the time and realised in making his plans he’d let over two hours pass. Bucky and Sam would be back soon and Steve had planned to have Tony well mated by then. Making his way to the elevator he told Jarvis to bring him to Tony’s floor. He had an Omega to mate.
A waitress rushed over to them, tripping over her words as she showed them to their seats. He had to give them points when two highchairs just arrived at their table. Peter whined when he saw it, clutching onto Steve tighter. Bucky narrowed his eyes and then copied him. Tony bit back a grin. He could see how that was going to be a problem. Bucky was going to copy everything Peter did which would inevitably lead to a disaster.
“Awh, Baby, don’t be upset. You’ll have all day tomorrow and the next day and night with Harley.” Peter didn’t respond, afraid that if he opened his mouth he’d start crying and he didn’t want to seem like a baby in front of Harley.
“Lucky for us we’re only a half-hour away from the airport. Papa made you a snack and told me that we’re not to get any airport junk while we wait for Harley. I think we can hide some chocolate from him though, what do you think?”
The internet collectively went crazy at the latest picture while Peter cackled to himself. Twitter was fun.
“Thank you Alpha,” Steve felt a kiss against his chest, “I’ll wear the collar.”
“It was too and I don’t appreciate the lack of sympathy Bucky.” Tony glared up at him, causing Bucky to grin.
“Don’t hide your sounds sweetheart. I love hearing them.” Bucky said, brushing his fingers against his still clothed cock as he unzipped his jeans. With a quick yank, they were down to his calves, baring him to the room. Clint could only spare a tiny bit of himself to be embarrassed as Bucky had taken hold of his engorged cock, giving it a slow stroke, making Clint’s toes curl in pleasure. He let go as quick as though which left Clint wanting and straining forward a bit.
“N-No Sir! A shirt is fine!” Even Tony knew when he was getting into risky territory. He wasn’t sure what Steve was like as an Alpha yet but he didn’t want to see if his threat would hold true.
Peter found himself nodding along with his Mama. He didn’t really care where they were going once he stayed with him. He cuddled into his Mama’s neck and made himself comfortable, sneaking a look at how different the tower was now that everything seemed to have changed. It screamed money, just like the other tower did but this one was more discreet and less flashy. Where the old tower was ultra-modern with tasteful paintings from the most famous artists around the world, marble counters and floors along with furniture that looked too expensive to sit on. This tower looked to be the complete opposite of what Peter once knew. The walls were still lined with paintings but some of them appeared to be done by children and blown up to be put into a frame. Peter spied his name on one of them and couldn’t help the blush that overtook his face. He quickly looked away and focussed on the other differences around the tower. The floors no longer boasted a black marble design with large expensive rugs artfully placed around the room, instead, there was a very rich cream carpet lining the floors, Peter thought it looked extremely soft. Another thing he noticed was that everyone walked around in their socks or slippers in the tower. The only people, other than himself that seemed to have shoes on was Bucky and Clint. He also noticed that the countertops, while still marble, all had protectors around them so that there were no pointed edges in the kitchen any more. It took the look completely off the countertops and Peter had to admit that he was confused over why they would do that. He lifted his head off of his Mama’s neck and pulled back a bit so he could look at him. Mama smiled his real smile that in the other world he only showed to Peter and Pepper when he was really happy.
Harley looked at Steve with red-rimmed eyes. “I can go. I didn’t know he felt that way.”
He was just contemplating taking a quick nap when there was a knock at the door.
Every time he was overly cautious Bucky would startle awake and glared at him but when Steve just hoisted him up as if he were awake he would stay sound asleep.
Clint reached over and ruffled the boy's hair. “I’ll hold you to that.” He said.
Steve moved Bucky first, he was a lighter sleeper than Peter so it would take him a bit longer to manoeuvre him.
“So who’s the boy that was annoying you at the front door?” Steve asked, manoeuvring the car out the busy car park. Peter wanted to groan. Of course, Papa would see that.
The only noise in the room was Tony’s low moans while they waited on Bucky and Bruce to arrive. They didn’t have to wait long thankfully, Bucky strolling in with Bruce right behind him. Bucky was in workout gear and had a sheen of sweat coating his skin while Bruce came in rubbing his eyes as if he’d just woken from a nap. That was typical Bruce though, always looking half asleep unless he was with Tony and in a science fuelled fever.
“How are you holding up buddy?” Peter looked at him with red-rimmed eyes.
“God you feel good.” Steve rubbed up and down Tony’s stomach, making sure that the back of his fingers passed over his straining cock, earning a moan off of Tony, pre-come leaking from the tip.
“Thanks, Mama, I love you.” Peter took the picture quickly from his Dad. People didn’t get to see this side of his Dad, the one where he was open and relaxed with Peter’s most favourite smile in the world.
“Want to see how Tony feels? Give them a pinch Clint. Look at Tony’s face. Look how blissed out he is. Go on, try it.” Clint brought a shaking hand to left nipple and gave it a light pinch, biting his lip as he did.
How was he just supposed to accept that he now had a ‘classification’ and that he’d be more of a kid than adult for the rest of his life? What about when he got older? Would Mama and Daddy always be there or would he be all alone when they were gone?
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, strapping Peter into his highchair to go over and see what was wrong with Bucky. Bucky, seeing his Mama, put his arms out for him. “Why are you traumatising my child?” Tony asked, taking Bucky out and rocking him.
“Mama, can I do that?” Peter was nearly sure that he’d say no but there was always a chance that it might be a yes.
Tony messed around on his phone after that, answering emails and setting up meetings for the week ahead until enough time had passed that he didn’t feel bad waking Peter up.
Tony sighed, trying to get Peter to calm down while he ran the bath for him. It wasn’t nice having an accident and he rocked him as it filled up. He put Peter’s favourite bubbles into it and set on stripping him. Peter was still hiccupping as the tears continued to drip down, not seeming to care that Tony was taking his wet pants off.
Peter posted the photo and locked his phone, he would look later to see what the response was. He had learned the hard way that spending too much time on his phone got it taken off him fairly quickly.
“Here. What’s so special about the blue box?” Clint asked, watching intently as Steve began to unlock it.
He didn’t seem to mind holding Steve’s hand today though, even swinging it as he skipped along beside him, talking about all the sweets he was going to get trick or treating. It was times like these that Steve thought maybe they were a bit too strict on Peter. The no sugar rule was one the stuck to after they realised the effect it had on Peter and Steve would always stand by it, but the holding hands and car seats were just a few of the overprotective measures the two of them had for him. Tony still read him a bedtime story at night for crying out loud. Peter was such a good kid though and he was rarely bold on purpose. He wasn’t even like the other spoilt rich kids in his school. Tony basically had to lock him out of his room so he could get rid of some of Peter’s older, more worn clothes. It was an ongoing argument. Peter loved to wear something to death before moving onto the next item. This method wasn’t really ideal for Tony and Steve who liked him to be dressed neatly every day. Steve preferred him to be in a shirt tucked into jeans but Tony and Peter had compromised with him so that he was allowed to wear at shirt open with a funny t-shirt under it with a pair of jeans.
Peter sat up fully on the loveseat so he could argue his case a little bit better. “I don’t know, they’d ask me the questions and I can choose to answer them or not.” He admitted, worrying slightly that his Papa would say no because it was too unknown.
“Well, that pretty much lets us know doesn’t it?” Tony said to Steve while he worked Bucky’s legs out of the sleeper while Bucky knocked the blocks together.
“Peter, it’s nothing I haven’t done a load of times before. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about okay?” Peter nodded, still blushing. Tony just laughed and dressed him, towel drying his hair. They found that worked best with Peter’s hair, otherwise, his curls went out of control.
“Sorry little Omega, you can come on my cock alone. No touching yourself without my permission is your first rule. We’ll sort the rest out once your clear headed so this is all you need to remember, for now, let’s work on getting you some relief.”
Jamie was sick and wouldn’t stop sicking up which made Peter gag. Poor Mama had just gotten clean from Peter’s pee and now he had to go get clean all over again. If Peter wasn’t gagging along with Jamie he probably would have found the whole situation funny. Although, he was turned off of his applesauce. It did not look at all appealing anymore.
Peter looked at his uncle with pure joy, laughing. “It’s only me uncle Bruce! I’m baby bear, Dad is Mama bear and Papa is Papa bear!” He jumped around the room. “What do you think of Mama and Papa?” He asked, ignoring his Papa’s groan.
“Yes! Finally someone speaking a bit of sense!” Tony cuddled back into Bucky, closing his eyes, feeling the heat creeping back up.
“I don’t know sweetheart. What types of questions would be asked?”
“Bucky,” Tony warned. He knew how Bucky and Peter could get when they were together. Bucky had a tendency to rile him up more than anything.
“PETER!” Peter quietened down straight away, looking at Steve with wide eyes, “Thank you. Dad said he’s trying his best to make it home on time.” He eyed his son suspiciously. “You seem very hyper, are you sure you haven’t had sugary foods today?”
“Thanks for the ringing endorsement Peter. I’m sure that will help Jamie.” Peter nodded, happy he could help. He held Jamie’s hand until Dada had him in his arms before letting go, content to know that his Dada had it now.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter smiled when he got a kiss on his forehead.
“Mostly, the whole of the internet can’t get over how cute Peter is and how could someone so pure come from you and Steve. Oh, Ellen DeGeneres is after retweeting his picture. Wants you on the show. Awesome.” Harley looked back at Peter who was listening to it all curiously. “Well done Peter you’ve hit over a million followers.”
Peter sucked hard on the thing in his mouth as he weighed up the options. He really wanted a cookie, he loved cookies but he didn’t want to face everyone in the room. What if they made fun of him for dressing like a baby? Then again, apparently in this crazy world, Mr Stark was his Mama and Captain America was his Daddy. Didn’t that mean that they would beat anyone up who would laugh at him? He’d also have to face everyone soon, he couldn’t live out the rest of his life in Mr Starks neck, no matter how nice it was there. Coming to a decision he poked his head out of Mr Starks neck and came face to face with Captain America, who was smiling gently at him.
“It’s okay Tones. I get it. No one gets in the way of protective omegas. Let’s go now so you can get to your lab and I can work out a proper training plan for this week.” Tony made a face when he heard the training plan part but nodded and jumped up.
Surprisingly it was Tony that began to growl at him. Bucky, Steve, and Clint all looked at him, not sure why he was growling while Bruce just shook his head.
“What no! We had agreed that we would mate before this! We did, didn’t we?” He directed the last part to Tony a waiver of uncertainty in his voice. Tony took pity on his Alpha.
Tony gets woken up to loud voices coming from down the hall, probably the kitchen he supposed. He didn't care right now because he was tired and just wanted to go to sleep, but then he realized that he wasn't even on his floor and the person he'd been sleeping next to was now gone and was probably out there with whoever was visiting this early. Well, early for him and late for everyone else who lived normal hours.
"-and I'm supposed to be okay with this? Like what are we going to do now? Can't you call Strange to do something?"
FrostIron
"You heart that, sweetheart?" Steve says quietly by her ear as he holds her hand and dabs at the sweat on her forehead. "Nearly there, darlin'. One big one."
"What are you making?" Peter asks them as he pulls the blocks closer to the two boys.
also, to the ones who have left me a prompt, i promise to get your requests out soon so don't feel disappointed just yet !!
"Nah, stop worrying you're pretty head, babe. Just calling to let you know that you are officially Peter Panda approved. The kid adores you and your awkwardness," Tony teases his boyfriend fondly, letting out a small dreamy sigh as he twirled a pen around with his free hand.
Before the team formed, Toni would have thrown a big lavish party with anyone who's important in attendance. She would drink and dance her night away and it would be enough to appease the media the next day because they'd all be talking about it and it'd be enough for her to hide at home and be the lazy person she actually is.
"I sent Lo out on a meeting a few weeks ago and no one noticed it wasn't me," Tony says as he grins at the team who all look a little terrified but impressed by the thought. "His skills come in handy."
Tony sniffled and curled up into Peter's side and the teen gladly held both children tightly, waiting for Steve to calm down so they could head home.
"Man, you're really gone for them. I've never seen you like this, it's honestly a good look on you man," Sam says honestly and Steve ducks his head as a slight blush starts creeping up his neck. "And they're good for you. I can see how much they love you right back."
"Sure thing, little guy. Which movie do you guys wanna see?" Bucky asks them.
"Be safe and call often," Steve tells him as he walks Tony to the door with Peter back to toying with Steve's button.
WinterIron
"Of course he does, my little Peter Panda. He knows you're daddy's favorite boy," Tony tells his son who giggles at the nickname and seems to think that Steve's okay as he stretches his arms out towards the blonde man.
"What's going on over here?" Natasha asks and Steve and Toni pull away from their little bubble to stare at the rest of the team who were looking at them worriedly, the fireworks still going off in the distance.
"He's like our guardian angel now?" Morgan asks curiously, not quite able to understand the concept of death yet though she knows that people die even if its meaning is a little confusing to her. And Peter, under very different circumstances, would have snorted because their father wasn't religious and he would have scoffed at the idea of guardian angels.
this one has fem!toni and we don't know anything past ultron so thanos who ??
"We talked and for now, I'll be movin' into the penthouse with you guys to help you take care of the little ones," Bucky informs Peter who sighs in relief.
And then he began to laugh hysterically which just further angered and confused the three Avengers who were clearly out of the loop from whatever inside joke Tony and his mistress had.
"It's what they get for waking me up and this is your fault anyways for not telling me about your breakfast plans, so man up, Rogers," Tony tells his boyfriend as he hits his arm with one hand while he holds his coffee cup with the other. "Anyways, I hope you all have a wonderful breakfast. I shall see you all later."
"And? Can you fix 'em or not?" Bucky asks impatiently.
Tony grumbled about not being tired, but fell asleep not even a minute later much to Stephen's amusement. The sorcerer stood up from the bed and leaned down to press a kiss to Tony's forehead before heading off to the bathroom to shower. There was no way he was going to leave his boyfriend alone tonight, all jokes aside about Tony accidentally killing himself, Stephen wanted to take care of his boyfriend just like the man took care of him on his bad days.
"Yeah, promise. Peter Panda, be good and don't give Steve such a hard time."
"I have something to tell you," Toni says softly as the others begin to count down from twenty.
Peter walks into the kitchen and stares up at Bucky curiously, head tilted to the side and brown eyes large. He looked like a puppy and Steve had to hold back his coo.
"Mm, cherry," Steve says as he leans in for another kiss, tasting the Popsicle on the man's lips and grinning. "My favorite."
"Were you born in the 40's or something? Get with the teen lingo, grandpa," Tony tells Steve, poking his side playfully. "You're nearly eighteen, not eighty."
Thor went to say something about how their mother used to threaten him and Loki to eat their food or else the Frost Giants would enter their room at night and take them, but thought better of it knowing his brother struggled with his heritage.
"Yeah, something like that."
"All clean!" Steve shouts, momentarily forgetting about his sleeping baby who doesn't even stir in the bed. "Oops."
"You're a jerk. Hey Pete, you want ice cream?!" Steve asks the three year old who immediately gets off the couch and walks over to them. "I'll take that as a yes."
"Mhmm. Is baby sleeping?" Steve asks quietly as he looks over at Tony who had his thumb in his mouth and looked completely peaceful as opposed to a few minutes ago.
"What?" She asked, lifting her head from his chest to look up at her big brother with large brown eyes that were so similar to his and to their father's.
"You ready to start your new life next to a pair of crazy boys?"
"How was your trip to the park?" Natasha asked the toddlers as she lead them to the kitchen by their hands.
"You just noticed?" Bruce asked in a bored tone as they all follow Tony inside the warm place, desperate to get out of the cold.
Upon entering the large kitchen, however, they found the genius kissing a woman with long black hair and crowding her up against the counter. Her pale arms were around his neck, toying with the hair at the nape of Tony's neck. Tony's hands were on her hips under her shirt, which was a little big on her small frame and very obviously Tony's. Her bare toes curled against the cold marble floor as she continued to kiss the genius. She was about an inch taller than Tony and Steve interrupted their moment when her legging clad legs were moving to wrap around Tony's waist.
"Ugh, it's disgustin', honestly," Bucky teases and cackles as Sam trips on his own two feet and by some miracle doesn't drop the boxes he was carrying. "Stevie looks at Tony like the greatest thing on this planet."
"What's going on?" Peter shouted anxiously as he ran into the living room, wiping away excess peanut butter on his jeans. "What happened?!"
"You've been no actual help, Clint," Natasha scolds him, but Peter ignores their bickering in favor of staring at the children, the brunette being the one who was crying and his wails were becoming more and more upset by the second. The blonde boy alternated between watching TV or staring at the other kid in exasperation.
Now though, ever since the first holidays they spent together as a team, Toni likes to keep things quiet and simple. For New Year's it'll just be them six plus Pepper, Rhodey and Happy while they eat lots of take out and drink cocktails that Natasha would prepare for them and they'd watch the fireworks from the balcony. Toni loved it and especially now that her and Steve were together and so what if the team had grown by a few members by now? It was still family and there was no better way to spend tonight than at home with the ones she loved.
"Gimme Tony," mini Steve
"Cowards," Nat mumbles to the rest as she kneels in front of Peter.
"They push Stevie!" Tony told the teen who picked up Steve and inspected the toddler for any cuts that might need his immediate attention, but only found the small scrapes on the palms of Steve's hands.
"Of course I help. What are you talking about?"
"Sweetheart, relax. I'm sure and you're not ruining anything," Steve reassures him with a fond smile, seeing his boyfriend starting to get really worked up and his grip tighten on Peter just a tiny bit. "I'll gladly watch over the little guy. It'll help us get to know each other and bond for a bit."
"Wasn't hungry. Miss daddy," she says quietly and Peter closes his eyes to keep his tears back. It wasn't fair. She was six, almost seven, and she'd have to grow up without her dad around. Life could really be cruel sometimes.
"You giant oaf, you frighten the children," Loki scolds his brother and Peter would snicker at their banter if he weren't sitting far from Tony's reach. "Now young one, there is nothing to be afraid of. Thor is something of a puppy, you mortals call him." Loki's now kneeling next to Tony who slowly pulls his hands away from his ears and stares at the mage with wide eyes.
"No. If I interfere before the effects of whatever turned them into children leave their bodies on its own, than I would be complicating things and cause consequences," Loki explained calmly as he lowered his hand.
"Good, maybe he can babysit on date nights." Now it was Steve's turn to laugh. "I'm working hard to be able to go back home tomorrow, but Pepper's in a mood and this place is a mess so no promises."
On their way out, Steve steals his coffee and takes a drink.
"Wha's goin' on?" Peter asked as he sat up in bed.
"Okay Yeah. I really need to go and I'm sorry for springing this on you at the last minute," Tony says as he walks up to Steve with an apologetic smile.
Steve looking after his boyfriend's kid (who he's never even met) while Tony goes off on a last minute business trip
"Just one more big push, Toni!" Her doctor encouraged as she looked up from between Toni's legs. "Nearly there! Just one more and you'll have your little one."
"Come on, baby," Steve says softly as he jumps out of bed and helps baby get off, glad that baby was smaller than him.
"Uh JARVIS? A little help here, buddy," Peter begged the AI as he picked up Tony.
"No!" Steve whines when Peter sets him on the bed and the teen winces as Tony starts to stir on top of him.
Peter was amused to say the least. Steve and Tony sat on opposite ends of the table and refused to look at each other. As Tony chewed, however, his eyes were struggling to stay open. Eventually Tony fell asleep with his head resting on the table and thankfully not his plate. Peter will count that as a small victory because Steve was not happy with the idea of nap time despite how tired he actually was.
The episode began to play again making Tony realize that JARVIS had paused it. As it kept playing, Tony's eyes began to get heavy with sleep and he eventually fell asleep to the sound of both Squidward and SpongeBob screaming as Bucky's flesh hand played with his hair just the way he liked it.
"Nothing bad, promise."
Thankfully the park wasn't crowded, seeing as it wasn't even noon yet and most kids didn't arrive until after. It was perfect for now since Tony was painfully shy and didn't like being around big crowds. That and Peter was afraid of losing two mini Avengers in the crowd and he really didn't want to lose his dads.
And so Peter explained what the two boys had said and Natasha was not happy. After scolding both boys, she set them in separate corners for time out and Peter went back to finishing their lunch before calling them over.
Telling Steve, slightly easy but very nerve wracking. They hadn't talked about kids even though they've been together for going on to five years and married for two, so that took a bit of getting hints from her oblivious super soldier before spilling the beans once her morning sickness decided to attack her a week after finding out.
Tony falls asleep while they eat breakfast and Steve walks out from the room rubbing at his eyes and his blonde hair a tangled mess on his head.
"Peter," Steve calls out as he shakes the teen's arm which is hanging off the bed.
"Your dads are goin' to make us all go gray before they return to normal," Bucky mumbles with a shake of his head and Peter simply giggled before heading off to the kitchen for something to eat.
After a quick shower, getting dressed and brushing his teeth, Peter heads out to the kitchen where Bucky's already up and fixing him a plate of pancakes.
Now, giving birth was what had terrified Toni ever since they watched a video in her freshman year of high school health class. She might be Iron Woman and might even deal with the occasional broken bones, but giving birth was not something she'd ever thought about enduring. And yet here she was. Laying on a hospital bed with her legs spread, a woman between them and Steve holding her hand as she pushed and cried. It's been hours and her little pumpkin had no intention of coming out on Halloween it seemed.
"Anything for my queen." Steve smiles at her, heart soaring at the blush on her cheeks as he walks around to sit next to her while JARVIS plays up their usual go to horror movies, starting with Toni's favorite
"Eight weeks pregnant today."
"Anyone have any resolutions they'd like to actually achieve this year?" Natasha asks the team as she looks around at all of them, ten minutes before the new year rings in.
"Well that's a relief," Clint mumbles. "If Steve's back first, he can take care of his husband, I'm done."
"I have come to notice recently," Steve admitted sheepishly as he moved his hands down to Tony's arms and to his hips. "I promise that I did notice how obvious she was being in her attempts at seducing me, but I also wasn't sure how to let her down without sounding rude."
The shorter male wiggled around a bit until his head was resting on Bucky's strong and warm chest.
"So here we are," Peter repeated and then chuckled hysterically. "My dads are three-"
"Uh we get robot babies now so they actually cry and- so not the point," Peter finishes off with a groan.
Tony waits with his arms cross against his chest and a scowl on his face until Steve's laughter dies to soft chuckles.
Steve snickers and steals one more kiss from Tony before getting up and continuing to help Bucky and Sam with emptying out his apartment.
"So, what'd I miss, handsome?" Tony asked his best friend as he took yet another sip of his coffee.
"Baby, ya halfta eat!" Steve exclaims as he looks over at Tony who whines and buries his face in Peter's neck. "Baby has to eat. Promise baby will eat?" Steve looks up at Bucky who bites back the chuckles that threaten to escape.
"You're shivering," Bucky told Tony worriedly as he turned to look at his boyfriend who was glaring at the screen.
Natasha, having noticed, simply rubbed the three year old's back in hopes of calming him down. Peter walked into the room and raised an eyebrow at all the things they'd gotten his tiny dads. Ugh, this situation was weird and once the children were back to normal, it was only bound to get weirder.
Peter takes Tony into his arms, rubbing his back in hopes of getting him to calm down and not wake up Steve as they left the room. Steve was dead to the world, as he usually was. Peter wasn't even sure how his pops heard the alarm to assemble when it went off in the middle of the night. Clint once joked by saying that it was his dad who tired him out to which Peter had nearly banged his head into a wall in hopes of erasing that conversation from his head.
"Daddy?" Peter asks excitedly as he rushes off the couch, stumbling a bit, and heading towards Steve who has his arm stretched out with the phone that the three year old takes. "Hi daddy!"
"I'm sure if you glare a tiny bit harder Sharon Carter is going to combust spontaneously," Natasha teases her friend as she stands next to him and they watch Peggy's niece basically throw herself into an oblivious Steve Rogers' arms. "Besides, it's not really her fault for flirting with a man who is supposedly single to the rest of the world."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh dear, it seems they do not know who I am. Anthony, have you not told them about me?" The woman asks, a British accent just like Loki.
"Coming," Peter calls as he quickly finishes the rest of his food before heading towards Loki and taking the three year old into his arms. "Ready for a nap, kiddo?"
"How about you and I watch Baymax tomorrow, yeah?" Peter suggest and it earns him a big smile and nod from Tony. "Good. Now let's change you monkeys."
"Holy shit, the baby is coming," he mumbles to himself over and over in an ever growing hysterical tone while Toni watches in amusement from the bed.
On the other end of the phone, Tony laughs freely and Steve could imagine the genius throwing his head back and scrunching up his nose in the way he did when he was laughing with the little crinkles by his eyes and oh does the mental image make his heart skip a few beats. He really does love this man.
"What?" Steve asked dumbly and he ignored their friends laughing into their hands.
"Who's kids did dad steal?" Peter wondered, earning a few chuckles from Sam, Wanda and Bucky. "Wait, where are dad and pops?"
"We actually have a Halloween baby." Toni laughs and Steve chuckles along with her, not quite able to believe their luck.
"We got called in this morning," Bucky takes over as Natasha stands up and lets the metal armed super soldier take her place. "Some guys were dealin' with stolen alien tech that they messed with and somehow one exploded and the only two near it were your dads so here we are."
"Any idea how long this could last?" Thor asks with a frown.
Tony's had a long day and just wants cuddles from his boyfriend who's too busy watching cartoons
"Tony, stop," Steve pleaded as he buried his face in Tony's neck, sounding completely mortified which made the genius laugh at his misery.
"Guess Peter will always be the Tony whisperer," Sam comments and Peter swears he got whiplash from how fast he turned his head to face Sam with wide eyes.
"I sneezed just before I took a drink!"
"Stevie okay?" Tony asked the blonde who nodded and even offered Tony a smile. Tony, seemingly satisfied with that answer, smiled back and grabbed Steve's hand before leading him back to the living room where the sounds of their Lego blocks being dumped on the ground were heard.
It takes Steve a few seconds to respond, but once the news settles in, he kisses her eagerly and then picks her up and spins her around excitedly which makes Toni squeal in surprise.
When Peter steps foot on the communal floor of the tower one Tuesday after school, he is definitely not prepared for the child-like crying that greets him or the exhausted voices of various Avengers trying to quiet the crying child.
"You're the sweetest and I don't know how I got so lucky," Tony says softly and Steve smiles. "Thank you for being that rock that I've always needed."
"Oh yeah? And why? Did something make them push Steve?"
"To put it lightly, Peter would be left an orphan and he would suddenly find himself a single father of two."
"I love you, princess."
"It's only temporary," she begins to say, setting her hands on his knees and giving them a comforting squeeze, "we're not sure how temporary but we were assured it should wear off on its own but Bruce, Helen, Scott and Vision are working hard to reverse this."
Also, any prompts previously requested are currently being worked on, so please be patient !!
"Fuck Stevie, if ya don't marry her, I will," Bucky commented as everyone cheered at the idea of going away for a few days and to somewhere warm.
The team find out about Tony and Steve's relationship in a rather unusual way...
"Nuh uh! It was here when Tony and I got here!" Steve shouted as he stood up and blocked Tony from their view. The other little boy was looking around for Peter and finally spotted the teen on a bench, but he was busy on his phone to see what was going on which made Tony frown angrily at the teen.
his familiar voice sounded through Peter's phone, making his heart clench and tears sting his eyes as he tightens his grip on his phone.
"Well who else?"
He knew Tony had a kid named Peter who was three and had lost his mother just a few short months after being born in a car accident. Tony hadn't kept that bit of very important information from Steve and had told them before they'd even gone on their first date, saying that if Steve was going to run off, he could do it now and save them both the trouble of getting through one date before the blonde decided he did not want to date someone with a kid. The joke was on Tony though because Steve had simply asked to see a picture and still showed up on their date the next day, the morning after that and still continued to show up even three months later.
"What the hell are you doing, Stark?" Natasha asks angrily as she stares between the woman and the genius, the latter who frowns in confusion while the woman's eyes glint with mirth.
"Hey, we're a team now, you don't need to thank me," Steve tells him in an equally soft tone.
"Can you two stop it?" Natasha scolds them as she walks into the room with Tony on her left hip and munching on a piece of banana bread.
"What?" Tony asked as he lifted his head slightly to be able to look up at his boyfriend who was looking down at him with that soft look on his face that Bucky always teases the blonde about. He said that whenever Steve looked at Tony that it was obvious he was in love because he always got this stupid dumb smile on his face. Bucky's words, not Tony's.

Tony covers his giggles with his hands at Peter's dramatic gasp before curling back up on Steve's lap.
"I know, I still love him. I know I always will," Steve replies slowly as he looks over at Peter and studies his profile. "We tried making it work again shortly after he came back from space, tried giving your sister the family she deserves, but the grief of losing you and the pain of having lost made it too difficult for us to give it our all. It felt selfish to move on when half of the population was gone and we'd all lost loved ones. We ended things for good two years after the decimation and he moved out here with Morgan. I worried every day. I'm sorry about hurting your dad when I made you that promise all those years ago that I wouldn't."
"How about I help you two get into your pajamas and I help you think, yeah?" Peter offers and both kids nod as they quickly finish cleaning up before Tony is raising his arms towards Peter who easily picks him up and then holds Steve's hand, leading them to the elevator. "Well what movie are you kids in the mood for? Disney? Dreamworks? About animals? Movies with songs?"
Steve smiles as he takes the three year old and Tony sets the bag down on the ground looking relieved.
"What? My beard tickles you?" Bucky rubbed his stubble against Tony's soft skin which only had Tony laughing even louder and Peter was a little afraid of the toddler having an accident because he was so not cleaning up that mess.
"Ugh, you guys ruin all the fun. Come on, tiny humans, time for a bath," Peter grumbled as he picked up Steve with his other arm and carried both kids to the adjoining bathroom.
"Oh hey there little guy, why the tears, huh?" Peter asks as he picks up the boy who cuddles into him, still sniffling and hiccuping but no longer wailing like earlier. "Are you lost? Is that why you and your friend are here?"
Tony cuddles into Peter, clutching at the teen's shirt and sniffling. Peter motions for Steve to join them on the bed and the little blonde gladly gets up and cuddles into Tony's other side. It's not long before both boys are fast asleep and Peter himself starts to nod off.
"You poor thing," Steve coos playfully. "You're lucky the show's on commercial so I'm sure he'll talk to you." Turning to Peter, Steve says, "Pete, your dad's on the phone and wants to talk to you."
"This isn't you calling to break up with me because I had no idea how to entertain your kid, right?" Is how Steve answers and Tony snorts in amusement as he leans back in his chair and stares at his report which was just a blank page at the moment. Maybe he should have started it first before calling Steve because now he was bound to not finish it and get a good scolding from Pepper in the morning.
"Bad word," Peter calls out, still happily eating his melting frozen treat without sparing a glance to his father and Steve.
"Baby's tired!" Steve informs Peter when he sees Tony yawn and his eyes begin to droop.
Immediately the rest of the Avengers began to cheer in excitement and ask a million questions while congratulating the happy couple. Toni basked in the excitement and let herself be hugged by everyone; Pepper, Rhodey and Happy holding her a little longer than the rest.
"Hi, sweetie. How was your flight?" Steve asks him as he leans back against the couch, eyes on the screen where the puppies are helping a walrus? Steve hadn't realized how weird children's cartoons had gotten nowadays.
"Always." Tony grins and pecks Steve's lips again, the two ignoring Peter's, Bucky's and Sam's childish groans. "Now hurry up and get your shit in the truck so we can go."
The sound of footsteps made Peter sit up straight though his spidey senses didn't indicate that he was in any danger. It didn't mean he relaxed though, not even when Steve Rogers appeared in his line of sight and took a seat next to him on the bench he'd been sitting on just staring out at the lake.
"Stop! Wanna play!" Tony giggled, a tiny hand coming out to try and push Bucky's face away from his.
"Yes," Peter says softly as he looks away from the button and up to his father with a shy little smile.
Tony, for his age, actually ends up helping Peter with his math homework. The little guy had seen a mistake the teen made and quickly pointed it out. Peter, once the shock had passed, did as his little boss said and it earned him a big smile from Tony. And when Steve walked in a few minutes later, Peter pouted a little as Tony got off his lap and walked over to the blonde toddler.
"Thank you for waking me up, Steve," Peter tells the blonde who grins up at him.
"We've got dinner!" Sam announced and Peter quickly packed away his homework to set the table just as they all walked in to start serving the food.
Tony chuckles quietly and goes back to watching TV, which he now realizes is on HGTV. He doesn't even make it through an episode of Good Bones when he falls asleep with Stephen's comforting presence and the Cloak serving as yet another blanket.
"Barnes," Natasha scolded him as she walks over to the bed and sets Tony down on it, counting down from three until Steve jumped up on the bed and wrapped his thin pale arms around Tony who wrinkled his nose slightly. It was obvious he was starting to get annoyed by Steve. "Don't worry Peter, I'll do it."
"Stop putting the Cloak against me. You know I have to live with it and it's constant abuse," Stephen reprimanded his boyfriend who began to laugh, only for it to turn into a cough attack. The Cloak on the other hand looked pretty damn offended by Stephen's remark.
Peter watched quietly as Loki faces forward in his seat again, gaze locking with Bucky's and the teen had to roll his eyes at the two. Thankfully Thor was too busy with his food or else he'd be broody for the rest of dinner. He could be really overprotective of his brother.
Bucky looks up when the elevator doors open on the penthouse ten minutes after getting back from SHIELD. Peter walked out with Steve in his arms and a pouty/sad Tony trailing after him like a sad puppy.
Tony only nods and yawns to prove that he was tired and the rest of the team held back coos. Steve gave up his fight once he realized that his baby was tired so he let Natasha carry him towards the elevator with Peter behind holding a half asleep Tony.
"Hi mis'er S'eve," Peter greets him, lifting his right hand up to wave at Steve who waves back with a smile.
"Um, what's going on?" Peter asked curiously, a frown on his face as he stepped into the living room where two kids no older than the age of four greeted him; one blonde blue eyed boy and the other dark brown curly hair and large brown eyes and basically an exact copy of himself as a kid. For a brief moment Peter wondered if what Strange has said about the multiverse really was real and they'd somehow managed to bring a him from a different timeline into the future.
"Babe, you're like a golden retriever in human form and a giant teddy bear rolled into one. If anyone can get Peter Panda out of his shell, it's gonna be you. Trust me," Tony reassures him softly and Steve would complain about being compared to a dog and a plush toy, but the fondness in Tony's voice is enough to keep him quiet. "Now, can I talk to the little one or is he too busy watching one of his shows? He tends to ignore people if his show's on. The amount of times I've felt like I was talking to a brick wall surpasses the amount of fingers I have."
"You gotta eat something."
IronStrange
It was only seconds later when Natasha walked in and sighed at the scene that greeted her. Tony and Steve were arguing back and forth and Peter looked like he was seconds away from crying because he had no idea what to do.
"Maybe I should stay," Peter tells Bucky who returned from checking up on Steve who was still pretty much dead to the world. Tony had both his arms wrapped around Peter's neck, holding on tightly and hiccuping every few seconds.
After dinner, Peter was quick to help the adults clean up the kitchen before heading out to check on the toddlers who were playing happily in the living room. Tony was still clutching at his doll as he helped Steve build a tower with blocks.
"I really do hate this family," Steve reiterates with a heavy sigh that has the others laughing.
Tony pulls away first and winks at Steve before turning around in his hold just as the barista returned with Tony's coffee. Steve, upon seeing the guy again, presses his front against Tony's back and presses light kisses against Tony's neck. Tony bites back a laugh as he grabs his coffee with one hand and laces his fingers with Steve with the other and thanks the guy.
Steve orders pizza for dinner and they eat in silence. Afterwards they watch a movie that Steve thought Peter might have liked since it was Disney, but the three year old seems to be more interested in a picture of Steve with his two best friends, Natasha and Bucky. To be fair, Steve isn't that interested in the movie either. He's not even sure what it's about, so he takes his phone out and texts his friends about his change of plans for the weekend. He shouldn't even be surprised when Bucky shows up ten minutes later with a tub of ice cream.
"Oh, look at these adorable little things!" Clint cooed once he spotted the toddlers, Tony whining again and hiding his face from the rest. Peter suspected that Tony would start getting fussy soon.
"That shit's gross, you're only saying that 'cause you're whipped," Clint tells Steve who shrugs and wraps an arm around Tony's shoulders, the two smiling softly as they lean into each other.
"What's going on?" Natasha asks as she hurries over to Peter who's being unsuccessful in calming the toddler down.
He tried his best to distract himself in his workshop or even attending SI meetings which Pepper was overly pleased with, even if he basically had a giant rain cloud over him.
"You alright?" Stephen Strange, Tony's boyfriend of just a year, asks with a concerned frown on his face as he arrives at the penthouse with a box of donuts and two coffees. "You look like shit."
lmao, this one is like a mixture of all universes because it's not canon beyond Ultron but Steve was found earlier from the ice and married Tony who was already a single dad to Peter
the titles for these first two chapters come from Taylor Swift's Delicate

"Pe'er," Tony calls, stretching in Loki's arms in Peter's direction.
and the fireworks start to go off.
"I'll get you a sippy cup in the morning," Stephen jokes and Tony tosses a throw pillow at the ex neurosurgeon's face. Well, attempted to anyways because Stephen easily moved out of the way. "Now get some rest. Let the medicine I gave you do its work."
"Well if it isn't my favorite customer. Let me guess, peppermint?" The barista, a young man with dark hair and bright green eyes, asks Tony in a flirtatious tone that doesn't sit well with Steve who unconsciously moves to stand closer to Tony while Clint, Nat and Bruce raise an eyebrow in amusement as they stand off to the side to wait.
Tony would, somewhat, understand if it were Bucky's first time seeing this episode, but it wasn't. He'd seen more than a dozen times by now and could recite the entire episode word for word which can be endearing when Tony isn't in a bad mood and in serious need of attention from said man.
"Looks like it," Toni replies shakily as the fear of what was going to happen settled in.
"Boys!" Natasha shouted and the toddlers immediately stopped arguing though Tony kept crying. "Why are you fighting?"
"Uh," was all the noise both Sam and Bucky made as they stared between a very angry and tired Tony Stark and one bright red and embarrassed Steve Rogers.
"I'm happy, so unbelievably happy, Toni, and this is the perfect way to start off the new year. People make resolutions for the new year that they don't keep and we're here starting a new chapter and watching a new life grow. Ten minutes ago I didn't know that this was what I needed in my life, but thank you so much," Steve says gently as he stares into Toni's eyes which are wet with tears and her kiss swollen lips stretch into that small timid smile that Steve loves.
"I'm sure Nicky and everyone at SHIELD can handle a few baddies if we go away for a week?" Toni suggested. "We've never taken a family vacation in the nearly six years we've been together. We can go to my private island for a bit of fun in the sun."
"Aye aye, Cap."
"Up," Tony whispers to Peter, making grabby hands at the teen who picked him up, surprised at how light the three year old was.
"Gross."
"Uh I'm Peter and I'm sixteen," Peter tells them with a smile.
"Naugh'y," Peter says as he grabs the spoon with his right hand, holding it awkwardly as he scoops up some ice cream and takes a big bite.
"Maybe their minds were de-aged," Peter suggests with a grin.
No one said anything because at that moment, the brunette child stopped and stared at Peter curiously. Everyone held their breath as the little boy struggled to get off the couch and then ran up to Peter with his tiny chubby legs.
"That I get to wake up next to you now," Steve replied as he placed a kiss to Tony's forehead. "That we get to be disgustingly domestic." A kiss to the tip of Tony's nose. "That I get to be apart of Peter's life everyday." A kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth. "That I've got a family." And with that, Steve's lips finally touch Tony's in a soft kiss that unfortunately gets interrupted a few seconds into it because a small body jumps on top of them.
"Mis'er S'eve knows me?" Peter asked his father who chuckled and nodded.
"Just get to work. I'm sure Mr Rogers will be glad to catch you up on our assignment."
"He's fine, Tones, it just hurt him a little and probably scared him, but he's not hurt, okay?" Peter tried to reassure Tony who looked seconds away from crying now that the adrenaline had left him. "You did a good job defending him, I'm proud of you."
"Can you use the bathroom on your own or do you need help?" Peter asked a little hesitantly once they reached the bathroom, setting the three year old down and getting large brown eyes in response. "I'll take that as a no. Okay, this isn't going to be awkward at all."
“Okay, we have a lot to explain, but first you need your baba and then a change. After that, we’ll explain it to the both of you okay?” He asked. Peter found himself nodding, happy that it was going to be explained to him at some point. He was kind of thirsty as well and he found that in the short time that his new Mama held him, he loved his cuddles. So when a bib was put on him and he was laid back so that he was reclined in his Mama’s arms, he found it no trouble at all to take the baba. His only trouble at the moment was staying awake.
“To what do we owe the pleasure, ‘Tasha?” Tony asked, too tired to give in to his usual quips. What he really needed was a solid eight hours in bed and not another cup of coffee.
He hooked his baby finger on the sucky thing in Peter's mouth and took it out. Peter looked at him in outrage as it was so rudely taken off him. His glare turning to a whine when the cookie was taken off him.
Steve smiled at the mention of their oldest little.
Peter didn’t say anything for a long time, just continued to stare at his Dad. Wondering how his heat could have changed things so much. What did this mean for him? Would he not be allowed near his Dad anymore if this Alpha said no? Would he not be able to cuddle with him or climb into his bed at night when he was afraid? When he finally decided to move he just cuddled into his Dad’s neck. Afraid this would be the last time that he’d ever get to do it.
Peter nodded, face still hidden in the hollow of Tony’s neck.
Well, he had him there.
“Can you tell Mama what’s upsetting you?” He asked after he had Steve look over him for any injury.
“Yeah sure J. I’ll head up now.” It wasn’t like he didn’t know his heat was coming, it happened like clockwork every three months without fail. It was just that he was really hoping he’d get at least another day before he had to retire to his room to ride a fake Knot for the next week. He sighed, he never was the lucky though so up to the room he went. “J. Where is everyone else?”
The stinging smacks to his now upturned bottom brought him right back to down from the floating feeling, enough so that he was able to beg Bucky to stop.
He wasted no time pushing it into him, smiling at Tony’s filthy moan in response. With one last smack, he pulled Tony’s shirt down and helped him stand. Tony’s face was flushed and his eyes glazed with pleasure. Steve helped him sit back where he was original, seeing Tony’s eyes roll back in pleasure when the dildo moved with him.
“That’s fine. Let’s get this show on the road.”
Natasha laughed, “And how are they taking this world?”
Steve raised a questioning eyebrow over Peter’s head, “Want to go through these rules with me- Why did you just take a picture?” Steve couldn’t keep up with his husband sometimes. Here he was freaking out about his son going on twitter and Tony was taking a picture of him hugging Peter and glaring at him.
“Want my help?” Bucky nodded, watching his Mama move his hands to separate the colours. When he was done he looked up and Dr Cho.
“Yep. It never stopped being a thing.” Peter looked between the two of them, still cuddling into Tony’s side.
“No? Want to stay with your Mama instead? That’s okay honey, I won’t take you off him, I just need to see how bad your ouch is.” He felt Captain America put his hand on his back, rubbing it gently up and down, before whispering. “Maybe after we can get some cookies from the kitchen after?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, that would be the next order of business; getting this diaper off him was of utmost importance. He threw his legs over the crib and glanced down. That did look like an awful long way down. He gave a little gulp and squared his shoulders. He was Spiderman! He could do this! Clutching onto the rail he let himself slid off the side, his stomach dropping along with his legs until, what after felt like a lifetime, his feet hit the floor. He did a little dance once he knew he was safe. Take that Mama! He knew he was big! Now for the next thing. To get out these clothes.
This was the scene that Tony walked in on. Scrubbing his hair with a towel he stopped short when he saw the tower of bubbles, with Peter crying beside the bath and Jamie hitting Steve and shouting at him that he was bad for making Petey cry.
Peter’s eyes widened at his Papa’s earnest words. He jumped up from his spot and ran into his waiting arms to comfort him. “It’s okay Papa if you really don’t want me to do one I won’t. I don’t want to worry you and Mama.”
The first thing Tony noticed when he woke up was that his heat was finally finished.
Bruce was the first one to respond. “Wow, you look amazing Peter. I thought you were a real bear for a second.”
“Bend over.” Said Steve, holding a plug for Tony in his hand after getting himself dressed to go visit Bucky and Clint.
Cho began simply by asking Bucky his full name.
“Still with me? Good. In WBT I was taking care of everyone in my own way and now in this world, I have what’s called a ‘classification’. My classification is a Caretaker here so I still do my thing but in a more open way because it’s now part of who I am and not secondary. The entity then told us that because we were going into a different world these secondary personalities would become part of the primary ones and a system would then be in place for that. She wasn’t able to tell us at the time what our classification was going to be or what the system was. It was a risk we had to take, and we only had half the information but we agreed. After that, the soul stone was destroyed and the blast knocked everyone out. When we woke up we were in this world. I was sharing a bed with Steve and we had a double set of memories to contend with. We could remember the WBT but seemed to be the only ones that did, but we also remembered a different life here, one that I have to admit is way more peaceful and organised. Crime rates are way down, there’s only half the amount of prisons now and there’s no fight against things like drugs and homelessness because the infrastructure is set up in a way that works with the secondary personalities that are now primary.”
Bucky was another story. He was skittish and wanted to be loved but didn’t know how to ask for it. It broke Tony’s heart watching him, so he made sure to move slowly with him, showing him that he was accepted whether he was big or little. Being sick solidified that to him as Steve and Tony didn’t leave his side unless necessary.
Tony pretended to be shocked as he worked Peter’s arms through the two tops he had on.
“We’ll be down tomorrow I’d say. I’d kill anyone who came near me right now that isn’t you Bucky. Let them know that Tony is safe though. I have a feeling I’ll be grovelling quite a bit once he’s over his proper heat so expect a lot of cuddles from a pissed off Omega.”
“He’s gonna make you ignore me. Please don’t forget about me.” Peter whimpered. He finally had a Dad, he didn’t want to lose him.
Peter raced back to his Papa, jumping into the area he just vacated. “You ready Papa?”
“Well, I’ll leave you to it. Bring them down when they feel up to it, though? I want to cuddle my nephews for a little while.” With that, she stood up, gave a small salute and walked to the open elevator.
Tony settled so that he could see his face while still being able to cuddle with him. “Okay guys, I suppose you need to know what happened,” He said, unsure of what to actually tell them.
Privately Tony could admit that he liked how clingy Peter got with him, never wanting Tony to be out of his sight.
“And look at you! You got yourself dressed today. That’s something a big boy does!” Tony continued to praise.
“I’m pretty sure they won’t be but you never know. I’m hoping that because we're rushing to go meet him off the plane that there won’t be enough time for them to get here. Doesn’t mean normal people won’t have their camera’s out though. If it annoys you, you can hide your face.”
“Hi, Jamie. You sleepy?” Peter asked quietly. Bucky bobbed his head up and down. He looked like he could fall asleep any second. Maybe Mama and Dada didn’t know? He should tell them.
“Back in two.” He heard his Mama say and Peter watched him leave the room, but not before he ran a gentle hand through Mr Winter Soldier’s hair. Peter watched discreetly as Mr Winter Soldier’s eyes widened at the contact and he watched Mama leave. That was something to think about later, he decided as he felt his eyes drooping once more. Right now it was sleep time.
Peter tried his hardest to get past the chastity and spanking. How was he supposed to go to a traditional household? Peter felt dread in his stomach. This was going to be a tough adjustment period if the look on his Dad’s face was any indication. Instead of responding Peter just turned back into Steve, at least he felt safe with him. That was a start.
Tony opened his eyes and saw Bucky giving him a level him. He growled slightly, not liking another Alpha in his room during his heat. The sound came out more like a whine than anything else but it did break Bucky’s cold stare and made him grin at Tony. Steve’s laugh from behind him sent little shocks of pleasure through Tony making him moan.
Steve looked down at his phone and back at his husband before just handing the device over to him.
Bucky for his part didn’t react at all. Just smiled shyly at Dr Cho when she looked at him. His crash was hitting him hard.
Peter knew Steve, he’d never been anything but polite to him before unless there was something Peter wasn’t telling Tony.
“You know well Pete that we have rules around this. You get the first two days to go wild and then after that, you only get a few pieces throughout the day.” Peter wanted to complain but he knew last time that he tried that his parents took away the first two days. He promised to never again do that.
“You heard the pup FRI. Play it.” Tony smiled at his pup. It was easy to see how much he loved him.
Steve took the other side of Peter and taking out his own phone to log into his newly created Twitter.
“Hi, we have an appointment for 2?” Tony said, bouncing Peter when he hid in his neck. Behind him, Steve was still trying to keep Bucky calm. He was doing little half cries, half whines.
He tried to find it in him to care that he’d have to spend hours building lego but really couldn’t.
Peter shrugged, “I suppose. That’s a Mama and Papa problem and not a Peter problem.” He said cheekily as he sat down on at the table and tucked into his Dad’s homemade lasagne. He didn’t need people on Twitter to approve of him all he needed was his parents and he’d be okay.
“Steve, we both know that he’s little and so does Bucky. If he wasn’t he wouldn’t be in that car seat right now. Any other classification would just explain calmly why they were not going into the car seat and that would be the end of it, not resort to tears and whining until you got him in and gave him a pacifier to calm him down.” Tony would never make someone that is not a little go by the classification, not only was it illegal but it was a bad time for all parties involved.
“We’ll go with 25 for now I think, make it less confusing for everyone.” Cho smiled and wrote something down.
“I know a few people. They invited me out with them tomorrow and I haven’t seen them in a while so since I’m here I may as well.”
Peter didn’t know it but they were trying to stop the jealousy from arising by giving him his favourite things today, like an unhealthy lunch (or as unhealthy as Steve was willing to go) and having some chocolate.
Steve laughed, “I know, right. It was weird showering and seeing Bucky just outside the door, looking up at me. I don’t think I’m properly clean, yet I showered that quickly.”
“Mama! Papa! Look! I already have 35k retweets and 500 comments! I even have 20k following me!”
It looked like Bucky was going to be a Mama’s boy.
“Mama, Thanos? What happened with Thanos?” He asked, not realising what he called Mr Stark. The whole room went deathly quiet at Thanos’s name. His new Mama looking at him before sharing a look with his new Daddy.
“That’s all I need.” Tony whipped out his phone while Steve busied himself getting a bib on a whining Peter.
If Friday had a body Tony would strangle her. He had only
“I think the needle went in when you were looking at Steve. That probably took up most of your attention and I don’t blame you. Steve can be pretty scary.” Said Bucky, twisting his wrist and drawing a groan from Clint. Steve grinned over Tony’s head.
“Uh-“ Bucky wasn’t sure of that and looked back to Tony to help him. Before Tony could say anything Peter piped up from his perch on his Daddy’s lap, watching everything intently.
Tony raised an eyebrow at Peter’s whining. “Well, I’ll be having a word with Papa over that. I want you safe when we’re driving and this is the best way to do that. So hop in.”
He was the coolest person Peter knew! He would always help him with his projects and played lego with him, he would even stay in Peter’s room instead of another guest room.
Peter shook as he stared up at Steve, he felt very small compared to Steve’s Alpha size and he couldn’t help but be afraid.
“Not an issue with me. We can tag-team them. Be a piece of cake.”
Mama just hummed though, “How about this then? Why don’t we put a diaper on but when you need to go wee-wee’s you let me know and I’ll bring you.”
“No, it’s okay Petey. I consented. The only thing is that he’s traditional.” Tony got it out quickly, knowing Peter wasn’t going to be too impressed.
“Please.” Tony whimpered when Steve repeated it for the fourth time. He was clutching onto Steve’s arm, unsure if he wanted him to stop or continue. “Please.”
Tony opened his mouth to protest but was cut short by Steve, who just held up a hand to stop him.
Natasha made her way deftly to where Steve was humming a tune and getting lunch ready for Tony. He glanced up when Natasha came in.
Peter leaned in to his Dad, rolling his eyes at how happy he sounded. “True, but now I’ll be the talk of the school and you just know reporters will have my picture before the end of the day as well.” Peter thought of something that would annoy the media to no end,
The relief Tony felt at Peter’s words nearly made him weak. “Well, I love you too my darling boy. In this world and the last. I can just express it better here. As for Aunt May, Peter thinks back. You haven’t lost her.”
“Yeah, I’d say he will. He takes being a big brother very seriously.”
“You mated without consent?” He growled. Tony could admit privately that he was a lot more fearsome than Tony’s ever would be. Steve’s hands never stopped touching him even as he argued back with Bucky.
Hey! I'm not sure of the username on AO3 but thank you again
“Shh baby, not so loud. Hey Harls.” Tony smiled, one of his smiles that he reserved for family only, one that lit up his eyes.
Steve nodded, “I know, I just hate seeing him upset. That pacifier did work a treat though. Don’t think I didn’t see what Peter tried to pull with you either.” He grinned over at his now blushing husband.
Tony and Steve looked at each other, Tony shrugging at Steve’s inquisitive stare. It wasn’t a big deal if they knew his age. “It’s alright sweetheart, just don’t tell them your name or show them a picture of you, okay?”
