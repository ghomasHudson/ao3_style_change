He got up from the bench, as John and Lyle laughed and pulled their coats on, and walked away. His hands stung with the cold, so he jammed them into his pockets and trudged forward slowly. Perhaps John would spot him and call out…
“Right. That’s it.” He snatched Sherlock by the lapels and threw him down onto Greg’s desk. Buttons were sacrificed in the name of efficiency as he tore at cloth to get at skin. His teeth clamped down on soft tissue and Sherlock was quick to spread his legs to allow John closer.
He processed the last two minutes again to see exactly where they’d gone off track. “You mean to say, like a crime fighting partner?” Sherlock eventually asked.
“Yes,” he agreed, a hiss of breath against John’s chin. He yanked at John’s sleeve, pulling him around the subdued man on the pavement and out into the street.
Sherlock tried to swat at him but John easily leaned away from his reach. Sherlock sat back against his chair with an indignant huff.
He chewed casually, not tasting a thing, then brushed some loose crumbs off his chest and mumbled, “So, pre-med, am I correct?”
His eyes drifted to his cane as they went by, his nerves soothed and then frayed again with each pass. He didn’t think she understood exactly, but as much as he did hate the blasted thing, he was dependent on it. He’d not even make it to the front gates without it.
John stared at his reflection in the mirror and wondered at himself. The outside hadn’t changed a bit. Bit pale maybe but, beside the alcohol consumption evident in his sallow complexion, one wouldn’t know John Watson had done the previously unheard of the night before.
John snorted, punched him in the arm and kept walking. “You still didn’t answer my question,” he sing-sang. “You had better find a good memory or else I’ll have to assume you’re really a merman. Have to call up the Daily Mail and let them know-"
John’s head floated off toward the window and bounced around on the ceiling for a bit before he caught it and slapped it back down.
"What was strangely poetic?" Sherlock takes a swig from the paper cup, grimaces and then shoves it back into John's hand.
He rolled into a ball as pain radiated up into his body from his mangled cock and balls. “Why, god?” He coughed.
“I didn’t think you… you said you needed time to think…” He studied John for clues, but to what John had no idea. It wasn’t as dark on this side of the flat, facing the street as it did, so it wasn’t hard to make out Sherlock’s searching eyes.
He took Sherlock by the shoulders, steered him away and nodded conspiratorially back at her. He blinked down at the bottle in Mrs. Hudson's hand and glanced over at John and his friend. She glanced over as well and grinned. Greg hoped Mary hadn't caught any of this as Greg might not be as subtle as he thought he was.
John snorted as the operator closed them into the bucket and started the ride so the next couple could get on.
Like the coward John had never thought he was, he turned and left without saying a word. He rationalized this by reminding himself that David was a chunky hooker and John was a three quarter full back.  He could be counted on to be cool under pressure and aim true without fail; not so much the tackling and pummeling. And rugby rules did not apply when doling out pain to cuckolded fools such as himself. It was a strategic retreat.
"Sorry, dear," Mrs. Hudson said with a motherly pat, completely incongruous to her previous statement.
John looked far from pacified but Sherlock could give him no peace. Mycroft would no doubt drudge up some awful, embarrassing thing, either about John or about Sherlock in front of John, and Sherlock couldn’t spare the extra time and effort to assuage John’s worries. He needed to focus all of his energy on the upcoming battle.
John gave a polite smile to the operator on his way past, glad there hadn’t been a line to wait in as standing still for too long only to move again would do a real number on him, but the operator stopped him with a hand.
“Oh!” She exclaimed. “What happened in here?" they heard her shuffling past the detritus left over from the flipped over coffee table.
Sherlock groaned at the announcement and worked harder. To his great surprise, John yanked him back by his hair.
“I’ve got a question,” John spoke, “and I want you to be honest.” Sherlock nodded frantically. “That first night at Colby’s...was that your first time?”
"Shut up. It's wonderful." He slid down another few centimeters and they both groaned. John had to clench his eyes shut and move his hands from Sherlock's thighs to the bed sheet. The combined stimulus of the sight of entering him and the feel of those lean muscles working to raise and lower in his lap was exacerbating the sensation around his prick. Sherlock was so tight around him, by the time he was flush with John's legs John was breathing so hard his head was spinning.
"Oh, yeah?" John waits for her feedback before commenting. The woman hadn't exactly picked a winner with the last one.
Sherlock woke to find a middle aged ex-soldier wrapped up tight in his grasp, struggling to get away.
“Ta,” John thanks him, genuinely grateful. He sticks his fingers into the vent, letting the cool air run up his arms, and then thinks about what the bloke had said. “Wait, what’s obvious about it?”
He was handsome, in an obvious, posh sort-of-way. His hair was blond, tamed with enough product to make Sherlock jealous, with bright blue eyes that, despite their guileless shine, John immediately despised. Beside each other, Sherlock and Victor looked like light and dark versions of each other. It was enough to make one sick.
Sherlock didn’t respond to either, just pulled the door open and strode from the building, feeling both chilled by the wind and warmed by the influx of adrenaline.
“Easy. You’re a soldier returning from a traumatic tour overseas, it stood to reason you would develop some form of PTSD, which you have as evident by your lack of sleep and malnutrition. Manifestations of anger are usually typical but it’s not just that with you. You won your date a stuffed bear at a shooting stand. I recognized it as the prize given to the winners of the rifle range, specifically those who hit every target the first time. That meant that despite your hand tremors, you were still able to shoot with perfect accuracy. Eventually you were going to come to crave those moments more and more. Situations of perceived danger where you could exert control over your body or someone else’s, but with you as the avenging angel as I didn’t perceive any particular malice in you. It would start with pub fights and escalate to full blow crime fighting, which would have seen you locked up before you were even done sewing your costume. If I hadn’t intervened, that is.”
His scowl should have peeled the paint off Greg's car but he didn't remark. That was, he waited until Greg was halfway across the street with his men before he called out, "Do try and keep from stampeding all over the evidence, will you?"
“Oh, ta very much for that.” He scowled at Sherlock’s brother but the tit couldn’t be bothered to even look.
John finally glanced up from his paper, blinked, and slowly let the paper fall into his lap, before turning fully to look at Sherlock on the sofa. They stared at each other for seven seconds before John replied, “Why do you need to know what hate sex is?”
“Oh, all right.” Sherlock flopped down into the chair, happy as a clam. Victor followed after, though less thrilled. He looked like a model turned the wrong way round on the catwalk, what with his chiseled jaw and
.” John’s hand raked through his hair, tugged once, hard, and Sherlock saw stars again. His eyes rolled and he sucked harder, the bullet wound forgotten.
John was about to protest when Sherlock started bouncing gracefully onto his toes, effectively shutting John up.
“I told you, didn’t I? I said, don’t force me into punishing you, but you just had to push me,” John muttered as he tugged and pushed at Sherlock’s clothes, “you couldn’t just ask for a proper rogering like a normal person, you had to bring bees and stabbing into it.”
He rushed to fill the awkward silence of the intimate moment. “You have strength and speed but your technique could use some work. I could tutor you in boxing as well if you’d like.”
“Hey, I don’t judge,” the mobster yelled, “but could you maybe do this at your home? Where I can’t hear about the things you say?”
So bloody proper. Sometimes John hated the reminder of how many stations Sherlock was above him.  He could truss the words up all he liked, all John heard was: ‘If you could not sully a perfectly decent boxing lesson with your untoward advances, that would be great.’ Didn’t matter that John hadn’t meant to do anything untoward, it was still apparently a forbidden avenue. Yeah, all right, he’d had a wide on the whole time but that was… it was… well there wasn’t really a valid excuse for that. He was excited. But the reminder that Sherlock was off-limits still stung. He wanted some way to convince Sherlock that he’d gotten better since their last encounter, if that’s why he was no longer interested. Or if he was upset over what they’d done while Sherlock was high, he would love the chance to apologize, at the very least. But what did he say after having been told Sherlock had deleted the entire affair? Knowing that blow jobs ranked up there on Sherlock’s list of unneeded information alongside tabloid celebrities and how to run a vacuum, it was a blow to one’s self esteem.
He settled in for the day, after replacing the items where he found them; all but the skull, which he continued to glance at throughout his wait. He even made sure to keep the telly volume down so he’d hear if anyone knocked, but no one did. Every time someone walked down the hall John’s blood pressure shot up but then they’d continue on and he’d deflate again. Near two in the morning John finally gave up and fell asleep. He dreamt his mystery lover crawled into his bed and wrapped long, wiry arms around him. He held tightly to this sensation until morning, when he woke with an empty stomach and an even emptier bed.
John wouldn’t look at him, possibly nervous, possibly even dreading Sherlock’s answer. “No. Girlfriends… not really my area.”
“Pentonville!” John erupted into great belly laughs as well. “Yeah, skip go, do not collect two hundred quid.”
He’s watching himself propitiate with the person he loves most in the world about his marriage to another.
"I would have lasted longer if you had shut up. Mmm," he purred when John grazed his prostate gently. He knew to start out lightly, just a few teasing grazes every third pass or so. Sherlock was so vocal it hadn't taken any time at all to learn what he liked.
“He called.” She opened her mouth to deny or placate but Sherlock cut her off. “John, prepare yourself. We’re going to have a guest today.”
“I could do this all night,” John mused aloud. “I won’t. But I could. Spend the whole night just touching, mapping each dip. Oh, I’d love to just touch and touch you.”
He would only know about that if he’d been watching the CCTV the night before, as Sherlock hadn’t moved from his chair since he’d sat down an hour ago.
“Oh my god,” Sherlock agreed wholeheartedly. He’d just gotten off but his spent prick took full notice of the action.
Sherlock’s spine went ridged at that, as it was wont to do when John mentioned something from ‘the night that shan’t be named.’ John sometimes wondered if Sherlock remembered more from that night than he let on, but what would be the point in asking?
It then became obvious to John why. He still had his hand rested on Sherlock’s shin bone, where he’d placed it when he’d moved to touch Sherlock’s forehead just moments before. They both stared down at the contact, neither willing to acknowledge it for the first few seconds. Perhaps Sherlock didn’t mind? John sure didn’t, hence why he had yet to move it. More seconds ticked by in silence and John stared down at the line of bone where it met tendon, studied it as if Sherlock were merely a life-sized anatomy tool and not a part of a greater whole that John would literally kill for.
John made to reach for the book but he pulled it back to his chest, terrified John would want to flip through it. He’d see the rest, and he couldn’t, he simply
John’s blatant refusal to see Sherlock’s pain had his skin itching, like it was wrapped too tightly around his bones, near splitting. He thought about it, he really did, doing the very thing he’d sworn to John just two days prior to never do again. Because the pain could be assuaged, he knew it could, it could be swept aside with a rush of liquid opiates or a powdered gram of amphetamines.  John would be in classes until four o’clock, then onto his date until late, if last night’s success was any indicator.  Sherlock could score his chosen poison and be sober again before John ever noticed anything amiss.
“Was that a bug!” John cried out, shooting himself from the sofa to get a closer look. He stooped to look at the tiny electronic pieces in awe, and the very idea that John was impressed sent Sherlock into a spiral of jealousy that had him up out of his chair in a flash.
“I don’t think I’ve got your brother’s blessing, dear,” he snickered into Sherlock’s neck as he backed the man into the closed door.
John’s pulse jumped. He could tell, just by the way Sherlock froze, the way he paled, Seb was the dealer. Seb was
“Attempting?” John countered incredulously. Then he gave a hiss and shook his hand out. “Ugh, I think I broke my knuckle.”
She blinked and Lestrade fidgeted, knowing Sherlock was about to crack the case. They made eye contact briefly.
"Bugger off," he snapped and pushed his way past Sherlock again. He walked back to the group of police without a backward glance.
“You’re good boys,” she went on, either oblivious or the greatest actor of all time. “I trust you to stay out of trouble. It’s not every day a boy tur-”
Before Sherlock could parce anything, John was on him, levering himself up as high as he could go on his tip toes. The kiss threw them both backwards, Sherlock being ill-prepared to take John's weight. He didn't mind being thrown up against the concrete building, in fact he barely felt it. All of his concentration was on his lips where they connected with John's, where his hands lay on John's waist as he'd caught him, on John's hands bracketing his face, working further into his hair by the second.
“Why? Aren’t dogs supposed to be man’s best friend? What’s your problem with dogs?” He snatched the joint back, sending lit ash onto the pavement.
“I find the Kingdom of Belgium lacking in satisfactory criminal element,” Sherlock commented, finishing the rest of his soda. “The Netherlands influence, no doubt. Too progressive.”
“Mycroft?” John shook his head to clear it, confused by the sudden topic change. “He’s Sherlock’s brother. Works in the Government.”
They couldn't go on like this, he knew. It wasn't fair to her, but if he let her go, John would have nothing. The right thing, the healthy thing, to do would be to cut ties with Sherlock. Move back into the dorm and never speak to him again.
A niggling thought occurred as Sherlock noted the sweat that rolled down John’s neck, the flush of his skin, the…oh…dilated pupils… Yes. John was, to use the crass colloquialism, gagging for it.
Sherlock rushed back into the sitting room. "I said he was lactose intolerant!" He accused them all of idiocy with his expression. There was several seconds of inaction but as soon as Sherlock growled in frustration and snagged his coat on the way out the door everyone snapped into action.
And just as John suspected, a cloud of aromatic smoke erupted out of Sherlock’s mouth. It billowed and swirled around them for a few seconds and then dissipated.
“Oi, get laid on your own time! Some of us have to shite!” A thick Scottish burr shouted over top of the stall. John snorted and Bernard laughed. Even six weeks in John knew what a faux pas it was to comment on the goings on in the loo.
John nearly called him out on the lie, but then he remembered the poster that hung above his bed, a Nile crocodile jumping out of the water, the silly cartoon croc bobble head his sister had bought him when he graduated, the complete first season of The Crocodile Hunter on DVD on his shelf. Had Sherlock snooped in his room? Or did he remember from that first night, when he’d come for his coat? If so, why hadn’t he deleted it? He would've had to, or else he’d have wondered why John had his coat to begin with, and as John could already attest, Sherlock was nothing if not dogged with a mystery.
“Oh yes,” he quipped, “dull really. I assumed his place of employment wasn’t an accident. I believe if you look you’ll find several of the refinery’s employees are Russian immigrants. The position on the river makes for easy transportation of the ‘goods’, so to speak, and the shipping containers are excellent storage and hiding. Locating the suspect was merely knowing the best location for one to remain hidden from the shipping yard via the river access, coupled with the likelihood he would have access to a mobile for emergency extraction. Which container was determined by simply following the most used footpath from the back end of the shipping yard to the river. The hinges gave it away as well; too well oiled for one supposedly seldom used.   My only mistake was assuming there hadn’t been enough time to call for backup.” He looked at the accomplice, who was watching all through the back window of a squad car. “When he started shooting I made a snap decision and took out the first and least threatening member. His death was accidental.”
John thought perhaps he could casually knock the candle on their table out of its tiny crystal bowl and into Victor’s lap.
Sherlock stopped suddenly, coat swirling around his shins like a cape, as he surveyed the loading docks. He mouthed silently to himself before choosing a seemingly random shipping container. They crept up to it on silent feet. John nodded to the container in question and Sherlock tipped his chin once in acknowledgment, then bent and scooped up a bit of old, rusted pipe, hefting it into the air, testing its weight. He gave John the go ahead and on the count of three he gripped the steel door and yanked it open.
“Yes, in fact, you are interrupting. If you’d be so kind.” Sherlock waved condescendingly for her to go, and John immediately snatched the wrist attached to the offending hand.
“Yes,” Sherlock growled. Damn the bastard to Yorkshire and back. Couldn’t he keep his fat nose out of personal business for another month?
John shook his head. "All right. Fine." He stood a little straighter. "I am proud of him. Proud of us."
Sherlock felt his lips tug to one side. He cleared his throat. “Not sure the Louvre would take them but…” He glanced up briefly and admitted, “I would frame them.”
“I used to draw a lot more, in Uni, before… Before.” He resolutely did not look John in the eye, lest he see the pity he knew would be there, but kept his eye on the line of Mrs. Atwood’s blood-soaked Valentino pump. “Haven’t seen the point since but I had this old sketch pad lying around and-”
John had a look about him, confusion mixed with something like apprehension. “Are you asking me to be your partner?”
"I'm actually glad you said it, Inspector," Mrs. Hudson admitted. "I've been a mite worried about him myself. He didn't sleep a wink last night. If he'd had a case it would be one thing..."
“You-“ He had to swallow the excess saliva before fully answering. “You look like somebody’s granddad.”
His sun-glass bespectacled self wasn't the only one on campus, as he shuffled, hands in jacket pockets, towards Mary's dorm. It was Uni on a weekend after all. He gave a few nods to fellow students as he trudged up the steps to her building, his guts twirling as he made the walk up all six flights.
“Well I’ll be here while you wait then.” He closes his eyes, sure Sherlock is following right behind him.
Sherlock wanted to, he really, really did, but he hesitated. John wasn’t ready to hear his deductions on the incident yet; the moment of his possible death was too fresh, clearly.
John held his hand out blindly and demanded, “Give me the torch. I’m blind as a bloody bat out here.”
Though Sherlock would never admit to taking anything as pedestrian as a kip, he did indeed wake up in the sitting room the next night to find dusk had fallen and John had already arrived home from work. He’d hardly seen John all day, as he’d had an early Fundamentals of Medicine class and then work at noon and not stopped home in between, as it would have been out of his way to do so. Sherlock found he’d missed John’s voice and had sought it out from the memory of previous conversations. He’d gotten good at recreating John’s personality in his mind palace and had been reconstructing a lifelike replacement when he’d fallen asleep on the sofa.
He complied. Though his stomach disagreed, Sherlock’s acid-burnt throat thanked John for the forethought. When he finished half the glass, John helped Sherlock back down.
“Where did you learn to fight? Primary school?” Sherlock taunted, bouncing on his toes like a damn kangaroo.
“Sherlock, you in here?” He asked before pushing the door open enough to glance inside. All of the lights were out but he could still see that the room was empty. Where the hell could he be?
He didn’t give his partner a chance to react, he gripped him by the lapels and yanked him backwards into the shipping container. They fell back against the metal with a huff as bullets ricocheted off the door and went pinging off into the distance.
Hearing the sudden curse was like lightning in John’s gut. He rolled further on top, pressed his cock against one long thigh and used his free hand to tilt his friend's chin down so he could bury his tongue back into that wonderland of wicked idiosyncrasies. John was near on fire with lust. Recent memory, what little remained, couldn’t conjure a time when he’d gotten so worked up, so fast. It might have something to do with the responsive creature in his grasp. John sincerely hoped it wasn’t the ecstasy that had him writhing and swearing, grabbing and pulling, breathing hotly into John’s mouth.
John couldn’t meet his eyes, so he glanced away, looking toward the banked fire. When his legs started to go numb from staying crouched for so long he moved up into the chair, still unable to look up from the fireplace.
John didn’t move a muscle, other than to trace the rim of the can with his thumb. “Oh. Boyfriend then?”
felt flushed, so maybe Sherlock wouldn’t notice. Thinking of it, he pulled his jumper up over his head and tossed it. Sherlock noted this but didn’t comment.
John never was very good at the deep throating bit, but he tries his hand at it again just to see what happens. Turns out Sherlock will, enthusiastically, fly off the bed and clutch at John’s head like he’s never felt something so good in his life. John has to pull back a bit, lest he choke to death, but getting that reaction is too good not to slide back down again.
“Of course not. You’ll need my feet to keep you cool during the summer months. Be serious, John. One of us has to be thinking of the future.”
“What did you think?” He asks. A block of wood could have asked the same question with more feeling behind it.
Sherlock nodded frantically, hope so unabashedly shining from his eyes that John’s stomach flipped. He looked so young, so earnest.
? Absurd! He knew the letter he'd written, the clue about Regent’s Park, had flown right over John’s head, obviously; that had become apparent after they met again at Baker Street. But what was everything else about? How could he construe those things as rejection, when half of them had been either been attempts to get John to slow down, or in retaliation for John's own cruelties. The last one specifically. If John hadn’t started singing about missing his damned girlfriend!
When Sherlock ran his thumb under the cuff of John’s jacket the electric pulse across John’s skin said ‘flattered, very flattered.’
Sherlock didn't seem to find the humor in this, if his furrowed brow and down turned lips were any judge.
Sherlock hiccuped, frowned and then listed slightly to the left before answering. “Uneventful, I suppose.”
John follows behind reluctantly, only vaguely listening. He’s gotten a better look at the man this time, his ridiculous bone structure, his almond-tilted eyes - a shocking shade of blue they had been - just before he’d perched a pair of sunglasses on his aquiline nose. He was so pale, nearly as white as his shirt; English sort of pale, John muses, like a beacon calling out to him, a sign. Christ, John needs to get a grip. The man is a stranger, a traveler, like himself; just because they’ve crossed paths twice in as many days doesn’t signify anything.
“Your loo is next door, right? I’ll grab a flannel and get us cleaned up. You should change the sheets.” He stood slowly and started toward the loo. “Sherlock? Did you hear me?”
John leaves the man with his family and moves to the loo to freshen up and change his clothes, putting the lot of it out of his mind as best he can. Off to Albuquerque next.
“Just a Coke for me, thanks.” When Irene raised an eyebrow at him, he explained, “I’ve been drinking too much lately. And one needs a clear head when Ms. Adler is around.”
“As if those things matter in the long run. If I want to tell the world about how sexy you look with a gun in your hand I will.”
John’s head turned slightly towards him from where he’d been looking at the framed periodic table on the wall.
In surprise, John laughs again, a sharp, possibly insulting thing. He can’t help it. “Hotel California.”
The man gets cut off his rant by the door to the dinner opening before he can get his hand on it. John is stunned into place, confronted with a familiar frame, this time blowing past in a white button-down, no less stressed across his frame, but sans jacket, the sleeves rolled up his pale forearms. John wants to say something to him, possibly tease him for wearing white in the dust bowl of a town they're in, but the harangued father of two is holding the dinner door open for him, still going on about choking his kids or what-have-you.
John growled in satisfaction when the whimpers turned to shocked gasps and John braced himself for the inevitable aftermath, as hot flesh swelled and pulsed against his tongue. He was more than up for the challenge and he swore to swallow it all down when it came.
“Yes! All right?” He snapped, raising his voice so the whole room could hear. “John Watson sucked a bunch of cocks, no, it wasn’t a hundred and fifty, and no, I’m not gay, vaginas are still lovely. Anymore questions?”
John rolls onto his back, moving the gun in his waistband to the front, and contemplates the new complications. “Would they have destroyed it? My passport.”
When the waiter came back to take their orders, drop off the wine, and fill Sherlock and Victor’s water glasses, John begrudgingly ordered the provoleta, but added a salad just to prove Sherlock didn’t know everything. The bastard was still sitting smug after John ordered, which pissed him off to no end.
I'm sorry. It gets better. I swear, I swear, I swear. For those still sticking around, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Sherlock decided to ignore that. John went back to the paper. It took little time to realize internet research was a waste, nothing but low grade pornography. He huffed in frustration. Asking John was out of the question, he’d look like a fool. Although John had been a perfect tutor as far as Sherlock’s particular gap in sexual knowledge went. Perhaps he wouldn’t make fun. He glanced at John, weighing the pros and cons.
As they walked on, he began to dread the game vendors ahead, knowing their penchant for calling out to blokes to win prizes for their girls. It was an insidious tactic that almost always worked. It was nearly impossible to be subtle about steering her away, as there really wasn’t anywhere else to go but back the way they’d come.
The bloke laughed down at him and John let out a snort to see the man was clearly teasing him. “Yeah, probably best not, right? Tear your little arse right up, it would. But I do love to watch them stretch.”
,” Mycroft drawled lazily, with that slow blink that made Sherlock want to permanently remove his smug eyelids.
He twists his wrist, a motion that says 'you wouldn't be interested.' "Polystyrene," he answers vaguely.
“No,” Sherlock answered truthfully, not sure why it mattered. John frowned up as he gently palpated the still swollen ankle. “I rarely do,” he went on to explain, “you know that.”
Sherlock growled in frustration and made to run from the room, but when he rose his legs gave out and he took a dive into the floor. John laughed until he cried but he did eventually help the man up. He even kissed his bruised knee. He was a doctor after all.
“Agh! Get the fuck out!” John stood and shoved Bill’s clothes and shower caddy into his chest. He caught them with another great hyena cackle and continue to laugh as John pushed him out into the hall.
Sherlock’s head turns toward John’s slowly, dragging day old stubble together, drawing forth long forgotten sensations. By the time there’s a hair’s breadth between them, John is starting to panic a bit. He’s never wanted something so badly, for so long, and had it so close. What if it was all hype? In his head? Wanting something and getting it were two different-
"Christ, John, take a joke. What's the matter, hmm? I mean if you're really over it, what these people think, then it's not an issue, yeah? Leave it the way it is, it's fine, I promise. I'll stop teasing if it upsets you so." She rests her head against his neck and squeezes him round the shoulders.
Sherlock laughed lightly. “I probably shouldn’t do this in these shoes,” he said with another chuckle.
Morning found John like a fifty caliber bullet found an elephant- messy, painful, and, if everyone involved was lucky, with a swift death.
John worries that maybe he should have just left well enough alone. It was an eventuality that Sherlock would see the blog entry, but did John want to stand witness while he did it? What if Mary was right? What if it were obvious how...
“There’s a trick to this, I’ve found,” John mused aloud. “You have to trick yourself at first with a bit of faffing off around the outside, but then after a bit, you know, after you’re relaxed enough, you can slip right in.”
“Sherlock! He was so…so…angry! It was lovely! Oh, John, it’s just too perfect. I can’t believe he fell into that so easily.”
He hummed, still not looking up. Mrs. Atwood grew a matching set of legs and part of a ripped skirt before John spoke again.
Nothing could stop Sherlock from laughing at that, even John’s frown seemed to fuel its fire. Karma for his entertainment at Sherlock’s name, surely. He walked to his chair and fell into it, waving at John to follow and take a seat.
John was out of his chair and on top of Sherlock before he could blink. He could have upended the whole bloody thing if he hadn’t planted one knee on the chair and kept one on the floor. Just then Sherlock didn’t think he would have noticed if they
John tenses up as another pulse of come is forced out of him. He’s not sure if he wants to gag Sherlock again or not.
“Perfect? What was perfect about it?” John felt like he’d picked up by a hurricane, flung to and fro, and set back down on his arse.
“I can’t imagine that’s ever your motivation for anything,” he quipped, eyes scanning the darkness for movement.
Sherlock’s hand shot up, nearly giving John a coronary, and locked onto his wrist, keeping his hand firmly placed where curls were at their thickest. His eyes blinked open slowly and he looked John over with a not quite clinical assessment.
Sherlock leant in close to the plastic bottle, studied the leftover brown sludge and then looked back up. “Yep,” he announced with another hiccup.
John pursed his lips as he studied the plastic molecules, cell bits, and other detritus Sherlock used to teach. He picked a few up and toyed with them, seeing how they fit together to create larger components.
(Update) In my infinite sadness over this chapter, I forgot to give you a translation of the French used in this chapter(thank you Whispering_Rain for the reminder!) so here it is:
John scrunches his nose. “Yeah, no, I know, just making conversation. It was lovely. You should’ve seen it. There’s this little path, dammit,” he tugs uselessly at the cuff again, “through the desert. They mark all the native plants. Very informative.”
Sherlock nodded, already having guessed that bit. “It’s a rare occurrence, kinesthetic learners, only about five percent of the population, but I was fairly convinced even before your failure to retain a fraction of the chapter you read.”
“No! No, Laila, your… bits… are fine, I’m sure.” They laughed at that. “It’s just that I’m… I’m trying to sort out- Oh, for fuck’s sake!” He reached into his apron and answered his phone when it became clear he was receiving a call and not a text. “What!”
Sherlock stood in the middle of the sitting room for approximately thirty seconds, long enough to hear the front door shut, before he ran from the room, down the hall and straight for his wardrobe. He flung aside various bits and bobs until he found what he was looking for- a lime green pullover hoodie. He tugged it on swiftly and then spun for his headphones, which he slung around his neck. He traded his black oxford Ferragamo’s for a pair of plain white trainers and his Gucci slacks for grey sweats. Once donned, he flung open his bedroom window and climbed out. With his hands wrapped tightly around the freezing drainpipe, he scaled down the first story until his feet were within safe dropping range. He missed Mrs. Hudson’s bins by mere inches but he gave it no thought as he slunk around the side and into the alley. From there it was easy to make his way quickly to the tube station on Marylebone. At that particular time of night it was fairly easy to blend in with the crowd; with his hood up and the headphones on his ears he was just another punk kid, slinking his way casually forward en masse with the rest of them.
"Mrs. Hudson? How sure are you that they would have..." She blushed but soldiered on. "The stag do, do you think they really would have?"
Sherlock huffed and stopped just below the sign announcing the Tiger Palace, took another inhale before scraping the end onto the bricks outside the door. He, yet again, blew his smoke into John’s face before, contrarily, opening the door for him.
," she allowed. "I almost feel bad for killing you both after only the one time." She looked at Sherlock. "Once you get him over that 'I'm just a sweet, unassuming gentleman' phase it's like fucking a tornado."
John didn’t answer, unfortunately, merely threw the paper down and stomped off to the bedroom. After three minutes of unnecessary banging, John reemerged fully dressed. As he slipped his shoes on, he gave Sherlock a glower the likes of which he hadn’t seen since before Mary.
His mobile buzzed in his apron, a text. He glanced around before sliding it out enough to see who it was from. Sherlock, of course, who else? He put it away but curiosity, and boredom, eventually found his thumb swiping the message open.
“You beautiful, brilliant bastard,” he said next and Sherlock sucked in a great lungful of air. His cock swelled, somehow even harder, and he tilted up, seeking friction.
“Landlady, right,” John muttered as he set his bag down and rushed over to help her set the tray on the kitchen table.
“My parents have a sort of symmetry, I think,” Sherlock explained, seeming to put it together as he went, as if he’d never given it a thought before. “My father is a lot like you actually.”
“You just need to find something, anything, to distract you,” Sherlock went on. “I wasn’t being unkind when I said that woman isn’t it. She really isn’t. Maybe it will be another someone, perhaps a career change, a hobby, I don’t know, but something will come along that will make everything else…worth it.”
"She was gone by the time I shaved," John explains lamely. He might as well have slunk away, tail between his legs, so obvious must be his hurt. The focus on his dry, doctors hands hold John's attention while Sherlock sits there deducing him.
“More drunk,” Sherlock corrected again, though his face heated in embarrassment and lust. Christ, how did crudely drawn stick figures engaging in random sex acts have the ability to turn him on? He supposed it was the figures in question. He reached out and pulled the top of the book away from John’s chest, pointing to a specific scene. “Which one is which here?”
Christ, could their family be any more pretentious - came up again in conversation, so be it. He would settle for being satisfied that Sherlock did have family to look out for him, absent though they seemed to be.
John laughed out loud at the quiet offer. “I’m not going to get off with you. You’re high as a kite and too bloody young.”
“John,” he started but stopped to move them down to the bench again, this time side by side, hands still clamped together. “Before you I was barely human and I didn’t care. After you, without you, I wasn’t human… and I did care. Very much.”
John, for his part, just hung on, a self-satisfied smirk attempting to pull his lips away from his teeth. At that point he didn’t think Sherlock would notice if John did bite him. He sucked down Sherlock’s ejaculate when it came, letting the majority hit the back of his tongue and disappear down the back of his throat, assuming it would be a lot, considering. He wasn’t wrong. It seemed to last a full minute, shot after shot just pouring out of him. Pride lit John’s stomach knowing Sherlock likely hadn’t felt anything that good in his life.
John stares in silent wonder as Sherlock jogs over to the trunk and pulls his bag out. He grabs a few other bits and bobs from the front of the car but then returns to throw the lot in the backseat. John must have had a look on his face.
They all three turned to look at Sherlock again. He stood, so stoic with his hands behind his back, as the bridesmaid continued to tease him. Molly glanced at John, who was looking toward Sherlock as well. Greg glanced over at Molly, a question about his brow.
John thinks he might fling himself from the sitting room window. Or better yet from his old bedroom. It’s higher and it would be a fitting end, he feels; his inner most thoughts come from that place, the corner of Baker Street he’d eked out for himself.  If he weren’t having such a surreal, out of body experience he might have gathered the strength to go through with it, but he finds his body is glued to the chair at the kitchen table, and he’s looking down at himself as he makes inane conversation with his best friend about the details of his wedding.
“The song. ‘Vera, Vera. What has become of you? Does anybody remember you?’ The lyrics are pretty suggestive. And if it’s not something she would listen to on her own…” The roommate shook her head in agreement. “It’s too obscure. It has to be a clue. Right?”
"You had a bad experience during your formative years. Male involved, most likely caught by his parent and threatened violently."
John’s x-ray ended up taking something like an hour. Sherlock couldn’t stomach the wait, so he slipped into his mind palace to carefully record and store the night’s events. He desperately hoped tonight wouldn’t be their only case together, as John would indeed make an incredible assistant. He could just picture how amazing it would be to see John subdue a suspect, all his righteous kitten fury exploding onto some unsuspecting criminal.
chair, as he’d come to think of it) when Sherlock ran toward the kitchen, and they met in the doorway. John took the first swing, which of course Sherlock ducked. He came up and planted a fist into John’s stomach. John coughed out all his air but managed to shoulder Sherlock into the kitchen table before he could finish his attempt at planting his elbow into John’s back.
"Yeah, eventually." Greg took another big swig, trying his best to project the movement to John's subconscious. "I can honestly say I never thought I'd see so many klingons in one cell before."
John’s puzzlement turned to a visible wince. Something plucked hard at Sherlock’s guts but he ignored it. No sense coming clean at this point in the game, was there?
“No. I’m protesting Mrs. Hudson at the moment. She interrupted what would have been a lovely morning round of intercourse.”
John glanced over at Scarlett again to see if she’d noted any of the current that was suddenly thickening the air, but his attention was snapped back when Sherlock ran his surprisingly rough fingertips over John’s own and asked, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock’s head tilted, clearly trying to understand. Part of John was delighted to have Sherlock so wrong-footed but another, deeper level was terrified that Sherlock wasn’t giving him a lot to work with in terms of his opinion on the matter.
“Other than her disappearance, what makes you think she was kidnapped?” He casually flipped through her notes. Her study sheets and her internet history didn’t match; the notes on The Constitution of India and the web pages searching levels of South American drug cartels.
“More drunk,” Sherlock corrected, letting a smile slip when John told him to piss off. It was meant in jest, obvious when John flopped down next to him on the sofa. Sherlock pulled his feet in a bit more so as not to allow them to touch.
“Thanks, mate,” he said jovially, popped another swift kiss on John’s lips and then exited the stall.
“Let’s begin, shall we?” He leant forward and made a cancer cell for John to disassemble and recreate.
John let the sofa catch him as his terror weakened his knees. Guilt sat heavily in his stomach as he waited for Laila to arrive.  He knew it was a possibility, Sherlock going back on his word like this, and John wanted to get angry, if he were a complete bastard he could spin it as all Sherlock's fault, but he knew they'd both had a hand in it. He’d agreed to Laila’s farcical dinner idea, he’d egged on the lie that he might move out. Christ, what had he been thinking?
John doesn’t misunderstand, he can feel the urgency in Sherlock’s movements. It’s the most erotic thing he’s ever seen, Sherlock flushed and sweating and desperate. He wants it to be so good that Sherlock has this moment inked indelibly on the back of his eyelids for the rest of his days. So he snatches Sherlock’s hand from where it lay bracing himself on the floor- his weight comes down harder on John’s chest but he takes it willingly.
John could tease him right back, but the throbbing insistence of his erection is speaking louder than any attempt at levity. Instead he darts down the bed and forcibly removes the offending boxer briefs. Sherlock hisses in surprise but doesn’t seem to truly mind John man-handling him. In all reality though, if he was upset, John might not have noticed. He’s fairly rooted to his spot in front of Sherlock’s cock, staring down with the attention he’d given the painted desert.
“I’ll be back later tonight. Or maybe not, if all goes well, eh?” John gave another attempt at machismo and failed.
John quirks a smile at Sherlock’s inquisitiveness, despite the memories that the question dredges up. “To me? Blood.”
, John mused. Served him right, jumping over that fence like a deer, only to slip in the rubbish and land on his back. He was far too graceful most of the time for John not to take a bit of satisfaction seeing him wheeze in the dirt, just a bit. He reminisced on the memory of his long legs in those tight black trousers, the way they fit against the curve of his ass as he moved...He sighed in longing, that was until he snapped out of his daze and remembered he was currently resting his forearm on said arse and he'd personally investigated said curvature of arse in great detail the last few weeks. He hummed contently to himself, a wicked self satisfied grin growing as he smoothed the antibacterial across the wound in Sherlock's back.
Sherlock did smile at that. “She’s down at the pub on Carlton Vale. A client paid me to prove she’d been selling hand jobs to teens and, when confronted, she admitted to it quite readily. I even received an offer for one on the house for my silence. I declined, in case you were wondering. But I did ask to have use of her tent. Seemed a less boring way to spend my night; people in and out, asking to be deduced and not even knowing it. Ingenious, really.”
John’s jaw flexed. He only did that when he was upset or angry. Sherlock tried not to tense up more because of it, his muscles already sore from twitching, but he could hardly help it. Another reprimand from John would crush him entirely, he knew.
He felt as if he’d been pulled from his own dimension into another one - a strange place without light, without heat, without reason. The place he occupied certainly didn’t play by the rules as Sherlock understood them.
John had to argue that point. “How do you figure that? According to him, he saw right through the sex-hair thing?” He gestured to the now messy bun sat atop her head.
He gives her a smile as she turns to look at him through the kitchen doorway. Slowly, he turns the laptop back around. The blinking cursor at the bottom of the page mocks him, dares him to either erase the lot of it or post it and let the chips fall where they may. Instead he closes the top and walks away. The decision can wait until morning.
“Honestly, you great fool,” Mrs. Hudson threw over her shoulder, “it’s just a birthday, it’s not the end of the world.”
John removed his hands and stared at him for thirty seconds without speaking. “A job though?” He groaned.
information that Sherlock could pinpoint exactly what John’s learning type was, easily established between his note style and his reading comprehension, which was nil.
"Sherlock." He receives no answer so he tries again. "Sherlock. You idiot, there isn't even a slide in the damn thing."
Sherlock almost admonished John for interrupting but licked his lips and answered the question. “Because I told him we were." John went to interrupt again but Sherlock rushed to explain. “That's what I told all of them. The ones I sent your way. You were being reckless, so angry after Mary you didn't care who you slept with. So I cared for you. Found men that I screened myself, and once they cleared, pushed them in your direction. Even if you didn't want me, I would still have you be safe... as possible anyway."
Miracle of miracles, there was tea. He went about preparing, the sound of boiling water and the tinkling of Sherlock’s glass slides having an immediate effect on his heavy shoulders, as the familiarity of it soaked into his bones.
Sherlock shrugged, jamming his hands in his pockets, embarrassment forcing more and more blood under his skin, as if he needed to showcase it.
“And since you’ve given up trying to teach me anything,” John pointed out, “I’ve got to study with someone.”
Mycroft actually seemed to weigh the pros and cons of John’s suggestion, though John was hard pressed to envision Mycroft getting his leg up high enough to kick at the door at all, but eventually returned to the sitting room.
“All right,” John went on, “maybe he’s being a bit overly… possessive, but you can’t think he’d ever really follow through with… whatever it is that…” He couldn’t even finish the thought before his stomach clenched in pain.
Janine giggled. "Not like there was anything to see. 'Let's have a cuppa.' 'Play us another tune, Sherlock.' 'Let's sit at the kitchen table for six hours straight looking into a microscope.' Ugh. Boring!"
“She brought this case to my attention, personally interviewed each girl that was found.” He glanced down at the lump of flesh that had once been a Russian sex slave trader. “Something tells me she’s not going to kick up a fuss over this one.”
“I could have easily beat him to death this morning, so I don’t know about friendly,” he muttered with a laugh, and then instantly realized his mistake when Sherlock asked-
He grunted in self-disgust and flung the notebook away. It smacked into the sofa and bounced back onto the floor, open at his feet. At first he wasn’t sure what he was looking at, had to squint into the darkness, but the blatantly idiotic scrawlings were definitely not there when he’d left that morning. He bent and picked the notebook back up. Sure enough, he was looking at a child’s crude version of a storybook, complete with stick figure characters.
Without fully thinking it through, he left his post in the bushes and made his way forward toward the building. He punched in the key code, long since cracked, and slipped into the lobby quickly, ignoring the students loitering in the adjacent rooms playing billiards and socializing. He knew John wouldn’t be among them.
“You’re English,” John replies stupidly. He blinks at the man’s smirk. When nothing further is forthcoming John fills the awkward silence. “Well, uh, fancy meeting you here.” He smiles, or tries to anyway; something about the moment seems tense, though he can’t fathom what it is, other than being cornered in a loo in the middle of nowhere...
The Inspector turned at the sound of Mary's voice and practically yelped upon seeing her standing there.
“I feel like I could do this all day,” John commented. Sherlock nodded but to himself he was thinking he’d probably last another two, possibly three minutes.
Something John had always wondered - had Sherlock ever deduced the reason why he left the nails of his left hand a bit longer than the right? What it was to do with the tremor that wracked him in certain situations? It had started after his first deployment. There was a clarity in pain, something that he needed when outside the adrenaline of the theater of war. It was a simple thing, just the bite of his nails into the flesh of his palm to let him know he was there, to clear away the fog that obscured his vision when the world pressed in.
“Am not!” He argued petulantly. “I just like to be comfortable. In case you haven’t noticed, it’s hailing outside!”
John felt the achingly familiar twist of affection in his guts, the one that told him it was perfectly fine if he bundled Sherlock up in his arms and squeezed him to death. A thousand hetero encounters couldn’t kill that feeling, John knew that now, but damn if he was going to stop trying. He couldn’t live with the feeling for much longer; he’d explode first.
John ignored the third buzz of his mobile as he chewed on the inside of his cheek. The second time today someone was going to confront him, and dammit if he wasn’t exhausted already.
No matter. It was the most boring, predictable date of all time, there was no question John would be home within the hour. Sherlock would wait up, perhaps find a movie to watch. They could make popcorn and Sherlock would deduce which actors were having affairs. John had shown a strange fascination with that particular ability. Most likely it had to do with John’s own lack of ability to sense chemistry in others.
“Not now, Mycroft,” Sherlock growled, not looking away from Laila for a second. Perhaps he thought she was the greater threat.
He nodded for Sherlock to come over and watched as the man slowly set his violin down on the table against the wall before he cautiously came over to sit.
John reared back in shock. "What? No! God, no, that's the furthest thing from the truth. Christ, how could you think that?"
“John,” he started softly, “I think I should probably explain, I consider myself…committed to my work and I don’t exactly foresee-“
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed, voice already wrecked with both satisfaction and want. He thrashed, shifted this way and that, in an attempt to get his Belstaff off his shoulders while John had him pinned down.
John snorted, amused apparently, but then wiggled further down the bed. A kiss was placed at the small of Sherlock’s back. He knew he had two small dimples there, they’d been pointed out to him before as particularly enticing, though he hadn’t the faintest why. He’d not given them a thought in many years, but just then John was making them feel like an obvious erroneous zone.
The look John received was the same he supposed ailing elderly pets gave new owners. Cautious, hopeful, but still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“Yes, of course. Are you all right? I called out when I got in but you must not have heard. Why are you up here?”
As soon as he turned to confront Sherlock again, he got a punch to the jaw for his troubles. His head snapped to the side, pain radiating from the impact. John swore if any of his teeth were loose he’d choke Sherlock to death.
“Not in a place like this.” Irene looked around with derision, absently running her fingers over his forearm, and Sherlock knew instantly she’d come here for him specifically. Now, all he had to do was get the reason out of her. No easy task; she’d make him play first. “What have you been doing for fun lately?” She went on. “More of that amatuer detecting?”
Sherlock flops down in his chair without looking up from his phone. “She’s finally decided on the invitations.”
John, in a fit of dark emotion, reared back, eyes glaring with what he assumed was clear malice. Sherlock didn’t care, or seemed not to care, that he was enraging a man who had a hand wrapped so near his windpipe.
Sherlock gave a good, if not better, impression when he begrudgingly repeated, “Your son would be much happier if you let him be himself.” He went on to further explain, because apparently it was necessary, “Grades would improve, sports scholarships would come, easing the pressure put on you and your wife to afford Uni, and your relationship with him would vastly improve if he wasn’t so frightened of you.”
Sherlock choked on his next sip, laughing as John ran for the fridge. “John, c’mon,” he coughed out, “ice will only water it down, it’ll do nothing for the taste.”
“Bollocks!” Sherlock shouted through the door. “Cough syrup is perfectly legal! I’ve put a lot of thought into this!”
"Like that do you?" He teased, the fingers of his right hand trailing lightly over his skin. He kissed reverently over the newly reddened bits.
"Esteemed guests," Sherlock greeted congenially. He then immediately bashed the top off of his champagne flute when he attempted to tap it with his fork. Champagne sprayed, glass flew into Janine's hair, she yelped, loudly, a few of the people in the front row gasped and it was several seconds of insuring everyone was okay before Sherlock resumed. John didn't care anymore; he had his head buried in the safety of his arms on the tabletop. Nothing could touch him here.
John looked at him in the bed, apparently not satisfied with some aspect of his laying against the headboard, on top of the blankets. Perhaps he didn’t like that Sherlock was still in his clothes from the night before?
“Feels a bit primary school to me,” he grumbled as he glanced up at Sherlock through his lashes. The look, despite its grumpy intent, had the opposite effect on Sherlock. He felt as if John had grabbed hold of his throat and stroked it softly with his thumb.
"No, not obviously." He tugged John's jacket straight as if guilty. "I'm sorry, John, I didn't see it before."
John struggled with getting him inside, Sherlock proving himself more a hindrance than a help John was fairly surprised when Mrs. Hudson didn’t wake up. Getting him up the stairs was a trial in patience, especially since John wasn’t anywhere near sober. The git was surprisingly heavy for such a skinny thing and his insistence that he could do it himself at every stair wasn’t helping. Eventually, they managed to get inside the flat
He glanced up with an answering smile. The man was clearly unaware of the tension at the table his little comment had caused.  John got a smug kick out of that. Knowing Sherlock better than Victor went a long way towards calming his nerves. He leaned casually back in his seat and threw an arm around Laila’s chair, earning him a knowing glance from Laila.
He waved that away. It wasn’t Laila’s responsibility, to handle Sherlock or dinner. The waiter swooped in and took their drink orders, leaving John feeling out of his depth when Laila suggested a bottle; the waiter looked at him and John had to shrug his agreement. As if he knew a Zinfandel from a hole in the ground.
“Of course,” Sherlock nodded, “yes.” He didn’t want John to think he’d done something irreparable. Hell, if anything Sherlock had left his answer purposefully vague so as not to fully discourage him, but John hadn’t caught that, clearly. It seemed John was just as socially inept as Sherlock was. What a team they made.
“A motel coming up. Probably not The Ritz but I doubt we’ll find an alternative before first light.”
John’s chin fell to his chest. Letting out a great sigh, he hiked his bag further up his shoulder, slowly turning back around to face the room, his eyes avoiding Sherlock. He’d take it anyway, as he was suddenly desperate to remain in John’s company.
“I’m not laughing at you, I swear. I’m laughing because even though you’re completely unable to explain, I still know exactly what you mean.”
Sherlock dug in his pocket until he could grasp the small torch he’d stashed and handed it over. “You know, bats aren’t actually blind, that’s a fallacy.”
"'Fraid so, yeah. Sorry," Janine's lyrical voice sing sang in that way, that horridly familiar way... "And for the record, I just really wanted to get dressed up, there can be murder or not. I was just happy to be invited."
He turned away and pulled Lestrade far enough from the car that Sherlock couldn’t hear. Try as he might the door to the car wouldn’t budge. He tried the other side but no such luck. How was he to sneak away if he couldn’t even get the blasted door open?
“Can I use some? I’ve run out and the dreck they have in here will turn my hair into a rat’s nest. It’s just chock full of sulfates.”
“Angle, size. Only thing I can’t deduce was intent.” He moves John forward a bit to look at the back, running his fingers over the scar tissue there as well.
“If you still want to go, I’ll understand. I could just email you some condensed notes that will help you better understand the course study on cell regeneration. But… if you’d like, I’m still willing to coach you on kinesthetic basics...for future use.”
“You’re confused,” he whispered softly. “I would be too if you’d done the same out of the blue. ‘Not gay,’ ‘married to your work’ and all that. But underneath all the posturing, didn’t you see this coming? Maybe you didn’t. I would apologize but…No, I wouldn’t.” He chuckled. “Sorry for not being sorry I guess.”
“.38,” he answered and attempted to look around the corner, only to be shot at again. Sherlock pulled him back by his coat.
When John didn’t respond immediately, Sherlock cursed himself for a fool in nine different languages. Insulting the man not once but twice? Maybe it would be for the best, he tried to reason, there was no earthly reason to continue to see each other after all. Hadn’t he avoided John's influence for just this reason? So he wouldn’t become addicted to impressing him, as he’d already showed signs of doing?
John stared, completely bewildered by this overly vehement response. Were they even having the same conversation? John’s suddenly racing pulse thought not.
Sherlock pulled in a lungful of blessedly hot, acrid air and felt a small bit of tension release. Though Mycroft was still sitting beside him so he didn’t get his hopes up too high for the rest of the night. “I suppose you expect me to talk?” He spit after a moment. “Should I spill my guts to you, big brother? Would it make me
He smiled back, slung an arm around her waist and introduced her to James. She charmed him right away, and there, thankfully, didn't seem to be any animosity between them.  John found he was genuinely proud to have Mary on his arm.
That was when Janine popped into the room and shut the door behind her. "All clear," she informed Mary.
It was a testament to the manufacturer's ingenuity that John’s phone didn’t shatter in his hand as he waited for Sherlock to answer. When none was forthcoming he very nearly launched it into traffic. He wanted to scream, to rend, to tear into Sherlock.
the bed bugs have taken over and she can’t verbally let me know without alerting them. Guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
“Sherlock, I deny us being a couple because we aren’t one. You are notoriously adamant about keeping people away, so it’s to be expected that people that know you would assume I was the exception, but... I’m not.” Sherlock’s mouth opened but nothing came out. He snapped it shut and continued to sulk, so John went on. “I just don’t want people to get the wrong idea. I have enough trouble getting and keeping dates as it is, if I stopped correcting the assumptions it would be impossible.”
Sherlock groaned both at the sight in front of him and the praise. He reached up to trace John’s magnificent bullet scar and got his wrist smacked for his troubles.
A bubble of something hot twisted around in Sherlock’s gut and then fanned out inside him, from his toes to the tips of his ears.  He hadn’t believed for a second John would actually enjoy Sherlock showing off for him. He’d hoped of course, but this feeling…it was wonderful.
“Three and a half years is hardly-” Sherlock tried to, sensibly, explain but John cut him off with a growl, smashing his lips into Sherlock’s without a care. Sherlock mentally shrugged and filed the argument away for later, opting to instead allow John the liberty of examining the back of Sherlock's mouth with his tongue. The streetlights painted them in alternating flashes of blue and gold, and Sherlock thought he’d never ride in a cab again and not think of this moment.
A minute ticked by, Sherlock assumed John was nearly asleep and was almost ready to ignore the heat calling to his frosty toes, when John asked, “What’re you doing?”
“Bored,” he admitted, which, technically was true, but not why he’d picked the drawing pad up to begin with. “This one was from memory, Atwood Murders, back in April.”
John groaned into the coat beneath him. He should have known better, but once again Mary had gotten the better of him. All he had to show for his troubles was a nasty case of actual heartburn and a coming hangover. Judging by the way he felt currently, it was going to make a cleaver to the skull feel like a forehead kiss from his mum.
He ponders this. Sherlock doesn’t sound terribly upset about it so it must not be an issue, but John wonders why, or perhaps more accurately, why him now? What makes him so special? He wants to ask but it would sound like fishing and he’s not so desperate for confirmation.
"C'mere. I'll make it better." John slid both hands under Sherlock's thighs and pulled him further down the bed, careful not to jostle him too much because of the wound. Turned out that thousand count bed sheets were perfect for man handling leggy, posh knobs into whatever position you needed them in. He leaned back down and, instead of biting, as Sherlock must have anticipated, laved at the very top of the crease of his arse. The man sucked in a shocked breath at the sensation and John grew bold. Two weeks in and they hadn't checked this off the list yet. John thought it a good a time as any to rectify. He didn't usually take steps in bed without Sherlock's express permission but he got the feeling they'd be negotiating the terms of this venture for hours if he asked, so he decided to skip that part and do as he pleased, damn the consequences.
Which brings him to the next pressing issue - normally he’d use the time in the loo to… take care of the urgent situation at hand, but with Sherlock feet from him, with only paper mache between them, there’s no way he’ll get away with taking himself in hand. How the hell is he supposed to relieve himself? Because there’s no doubt he’s going to sport this wide on for the foreseeable future. Sherlock’s nearly nude appearance just now has seen to that, mint drool and frizzy hair included.
it was Sherlock playing. Mrs. Hudson had sworn he was capable of playing beautifully, but John had never heard it before; nothing as terribly haunting as the strains echoing down from above. He tiptoed the final few stairs, not wanting to bother Sherlock while he played.
John kisses his way back up to Sherlock’s lips. “What?” He asks between their lips meeting. He feels it then, there’s a wetness splashing down, mixing between their lips.
Sherlock nodded, embarrassed but still willing to open himself to the pain if it meant John understood.
“How do you not have any bloody ice?” He called out when digging turned up no evidence of an ice tray.
“Oi, Freak,” Sally called out. Sherlock stopped but didn’t turn. She took it as enough of an acknowledgment. “Don’t go taking the law into your own hands again, yeah? If you find them, don’t engage, just come find us.”
She nodded. “Just after I left the flat yesterday. I was fairly sure he would react favourably but just in case, I had Daniel get in touch with some of his estate contacts. He shouldn’t be able to find anything harder than paracetamol in the greater london area.”
John opened his mouth but wasn’t sure what to say; he was thrown by the sudden inquiry. Remembering the bag of peas, he gently rested it against his lip.
"I almost always am," he admits with a quirk of a smile. It does things to John's stomach that he's tried years to suppress. Without success.
His friend sucked in a shocked breath; John could feel the sudden dip in his stomach as his diaphragm contracted. He then gripped John’s hand in a tight vice, stopping his movement instantly. Their eyes met, John feeling unsure until he took in the pleading look.
John interrupted, “Art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.” Sherlock cocked his head, sure he’d heard that before. “You said that once, during a case, I forget which one. I liked it. It was strangely...poetic. For you, I guess.”
“Very good, John, thank you,” he mumbled as he made a few notes of his own in the margins of John’s notebook. “Now, tell me, what is it exactly you wish to accomplish here?”
Despite all previous evidence to the contrary, new evidence dispels John's hetero status, rewrites assumed knowledge. Shouldn't have assumed, twisted facts to suit theory... Wasn't him.. It was me. He tried first off but I...I... And then he called me a machine-"
“I’m not sure,” Sherlock admitted after a moment. “They met just after University I think. My father’s an accountant, so I’m sure they met through a colleague or some such. They don’t exactly talk about the details of their romantic attachment and, of course, I’ve never asked.”
He was glad for the extra bit of light but didn’t say so. Instead, he slid Sherlock’s trouser up until it bunched around his calf and went about feeling the bone and tissue.
"So I'll just lay here supine and let you have your way with me, shall I?" Sherlock deadpanned as he pulled the ruined shirt from his shoulders.
John backs up until his shoulders slam into the wall, but the man keeps coming, throwing his forearm up to lay across John’s chest, pressing him further into the beige clay.
"That's it," John snarled before he rose up and snatched Sherlock by his jacket and marched him out of the room. Drug him was perhaps more apt. Sherlock was certainly unbalanced, arms out, note cards flying, his legs tripping to stay upward mobile as John yanked him toward the first room they came to.
“Yes. Mate of a mate situation. Said his name was Wiggy but it was probably Billy or Phil or something equality innocuous.”
"Seb?" John asked, trying to distract her further. He wondered where the hell Greg was, or any of their other guests for that matter.
“Come back, yeah? Get off the damn foot, you nut.” John chuckled. “Come on,” he coaxed as one would a toddler, causing Sherlock to turn with a scowl, despite the warmth radiating through him from John’s obvious concern.
Mycroft finally looked over and locked eyes with John. That laser focus was possibly the only thing the brothers shared.
Mary dropped the blushing bride act, her face morphing into something closer to madness, intent in her righteousness. John kept a weather eye on her trigger finger.
Sherlock rose up and pulled John down into a searing kiss, happiness bubbling up inside him at the thought of forever. John cried out, wrapping his arms tight around Sherlock’s shoulders as they rocked together.
“Yeah, politics, not really my thing.” He watched as the last customer gathered up their belongings and shuffled out the door. Beth followed behind to lock up.
“Of course not, but he’s a PC in Lestrade’s office, he’s of low to middling intelligence. Kept at it despite Lestrade’s warnings. He went on until I was too far away to hear but I did catch him saying every time with us must be the angry, ‘hate sex’ kind.” He let his hands flop after the requisite finger quotations.
John stumbled into the flat with the world weary, heavy gait of the recently work released; so dead on his feet he could barely lift his toes enough to avoid tripping on the stairs. His jacket was shrugged off his shoulders and when it fell to land at the foot of the coat rack all he could do was stare at it. The idea of bending over to pick it up was absurd.
“What do you need? Tell me.” He bit at Sherlock’s jaw bone as he continued to mold his fingers and palm against his cock. It seemed to quite literally melt Sherlock’s knees; John had to prop him against the door with both hands to his hips. “How do you like it, Sherlock?”
John huffed out a slight laugh. "That's not what I meant but thanks for the visual." Sherlock's scowl said he didn't understand but didn't care to ask. "I'm about twenty seconds away from going off as is. If you plant your arse on me now I'll never last."
“I’m failing Chemistry and Wickum stuck me with the worse tutor possible. Holmes makes every University Challenge team combined look like a bunch of infants.
"Good 'ah' then." He gripped two fistfuls of arse and lowered his head again. He worked Sherlock over, using every trick he knew, lightly and rough, pointed and wide, learning what Sherlock liked best when he keened aloud and fisted the sheets. John took a lot of pride in his work, even though his jaw began to ache, he continued to push his tongue against and into Sherlock until he knew the man was about to break.
"By the time I came home, they were both dead," she continued. "Jim by his own idiotic hand and Seb taken out by some random MI6 agent," she spit. "He deserved better."
“If we even make it home.” He looked at his partner. “Did you forget that you killed a man?  And then I helped you desecrate his corpse?”
John is out and out giggling now. “Doesn’t seem your style. You’re more a ‘poison-dart-in-the-wristwatch’ kinda bloke.”
“Right, but dots all the same. This is good though, I can use this, I’ll just have to adjust the timetable.”
for their kick ass work on this chapter. They are Lennon and McCartney to my shitty Ringo Star that nobody cares about.
"Bottom drawer. Bottom, Sherlock," he informed the man as he slapped ineffectually in the top drawer.
It’s by no means a comfortable wait, but neither is it a walk to the gallows. He’s still in that cocoon of stasis, where consequence means little to nothing. He’s just so bloody tired of straddling this line between one path and the other. So he’ll float here, above it all, until Sherlock decides for him, as always. He’ll trust in that. They’ll either travel together or John will leave Sherlock to travel his own path while he continues on with Mary.
He pulled the knocker, shutting the door behind them, and muttered, “No. Chinese gambling, not really my area of expertise.”
John flung himself on top of Sherlock and rolled them across the bed. Sherlock was breathless in surprise as John laughingly snogged him quiet.
Sherlock rushed forward and pinned John to the door with a wet kiss, his hand came down instantly to rest against his erection. John groaned in surprise, with only a few short seconds of baffled acceptance, before he gripped Sherlock's fragile wrist in hand and pushed him back. He caught Sherlock's stunned expression. Honestly, the man looked like he was going to cry.
He checked his roommates bed, the closet, under his own bed, everywhere. The coat was gone. What he did find, on his nightstand, was a note, previously nonexistent before John had gone to bed. On it the bird skull sat as a paper weight.
It was the drugs. It had to be. His first instinct had been correct- John was put off by the drug use. Just not enough to keep him from moving in apparently. A doctor’s instinct to protect the weak, that’s all it was, all that he was worth.  Pity.
The door was cracked, the only light in the room coming from the fire banked in the fireplace. He tried to peep through before opening it fully but all he could see was a sliver of the mirror across the room, above the fireplace, and Sherlock wasn’t reflected in it. He must be standing at the window.
They finished the paperwork and John walked it back to the desk clerk. On his way back he stopped to get a soda out of the vending machine, looking questioningly at Sherlock, who shook his head.
"Look," John snaps in embarrassment, "if you think it's bad I won't post it. It was a stupid idea to begin with, Sherlock was against it from the start, I should have just left well enough alone."
He glanced over to see Sherlock looking practically giddy compared to how he’d looked moment before. That might just be the weed kicking in though.
It hit John like a ton of bricks then. Between the liquor, what had happened with Sherlock and the shock of finding out his relationship with Mary was a lie based on revenge, he'd forgotten just a few short hours ago he'd planned on spending the rest of his life with this woman. John felt like he'd had the wind knocked out of him. Mary quickly snapped him back to reality.
Twenty minutes later John was sprinting up the steps to 221B Baker Street. He found Sherlock standing in the middle of the sitting room, barefoot, in his ratty sleepwear, the bastard.
John looked up at him in mild surprise but Sherlock was too busy blinking away the spots in front of his eyes to be embarrassed.
Sherlock shook his head, licking his lips as he tried to articulate. “No, I need to learn to control my insecurities. You should be able to leave the room without my having a panic attack. It’s absurd.”
Sherlock would have protested, had his lips been free. John’s smile never left his mouth as they kissed, for quite a long time. By the time John pulled away, they were both fully hard again.
“Oh, fuck.” John sucked in a shuddering breath and, without warning, yanked hard at Sherlock’s hair, pulled his head back and his spine bowed.
“Agh!” The man tossed the oak table away as if it were nothing but paper mache. “I’m gonna break your legs!”
This wasn’t about getting his brother off his back. Sherlock truly wanted John to live with him. How could he have forgotten about the conclusion he’d come to just that morning? He was Sherlock’s only friend…
Twenty-five minutes later John groaned, stretched, and glared at Sherlock with such disdain one would think he’d chained John to the wall first before making him study.
“Up, now,” the gun-wielding mobster grunts, cocking his matching Sig as if John and Sherlock weren’t already on their way to their feet. “You’ve given us a lot of trouble, Mr. Holmes. Our boss will be happy to hear I’ve buried your corpse where no one will find it.”
“I’ve been in love with you for roughly the last twenty-five hundred days. I say roughly because I’m not sure when it started, but I’m sure that’s not the bit you’re interested in just now. I’ve kept this information to myself, baring what Mycroft has gleaned, or thinks he has, because I didn’t think it would be welcome. Not after… Well, everything. But you wanted to talk, so there it is. Do what you will.”
But it was. No matter how long John stood there blinking at the sofa, his girlfriend was still going for the gold in the Snog Olympics with her ‘just good friend’ David Hodges. They hadn’t heard his entrance, not with the absolutely terrible snog music playing on full blast on her stereo. It should have been obvious, John standing there in her doorway, but that's how wrapped up in each other they were.
“I don’t know,” he admitted, “I guess I assumed because you’re the biggest whore for birds I’ve ever seen that you’d be uncomfortable with it.”
John gave a sharp nod, hands behind his back. If he had to quantify, he’d say it was a seventy-thirty split with a leaning towards women but it wasn’t like that mattered.
“You know,” Bill shrugged, "about you blowing something like a hundred blokes in the last two months.”
A black-clad woman of a similar age to John, had her blood red nails trailing down Sherlock’s arm. They clearly knew each other, her smile said as much, and his body language didn’t read as uncomfortable. This must be the infamous Molly, keeper of Sherlock’s precious body parts. What the hell was John supposed to do about that? No one would say no to a woman like that, and she was clearly fishing. Since John had no idea if Sherlock even liked women, his hackles were raised. John had no right to step in, but how could he stand by and let that harpy-
Adrenaline courses through John’s bloodstream, but he forces himself not to act until he knows exactly what’s happening.
He sucked the stale, day old syrup from the back of his teeth and swore to himself, he’d do everything in his power to keep John Watson. He’d make John see their potential and if that meant just being his friend while he worked out his… current female issues… then so be it. Sherlock would be the best friend John Watson ever had.
He ground his molars together. Why was he doing this again? Oh, yes. Because Mycroft was blackmailing him, the waddling shit.
“Well how was I to know?” John heard come from down the hall. He frowned to himself. Sherlock was hiding something, no doubt about that.
He turned dramatically and marched out the door, leaving the rest to follow behind his flapping coat tails. They piled onto the campus security cart, Lestrade and Donovan in the front, Sherlock and John in the back. Lestrade asked after their destination as he started it up.
They scrambled, bumping into each other in the doorway. John heard Greg mumble about his damn cigarettes and then slam the door.
Gregson gave a chuckle. “He wouldn’t answer anyway. The most you’ll get is a text if you’re lucky. He’s... strict about study times. As long as you stick to the allowed schedule you’d be all right. How do you feel about it?”
Sherlock held the phone out, too busy laughing to answer properly. John switched the joint into his right hand so he could take the mobile, and then flipped it so he could look at the number one result.
“Yeah? Thanks!” He grinned like Sherlock had offered to be his personal slave for life, and the feeling it gave Sherlock did not bode well for their future. He could easily become as addicted to doing favours for this man as he already had at impressing him. He silently vowed never to do another thing for John as long as they both should live.
John sputtered, unable to lay his eyes anywhere for long. Sherlock was right, he was rubbish at lying. "When did you figure it out?" He asked after deflating in defeat.
The notebook was left on the sitting room floor, forgotten until the next morning, when Mrs. Hudson woke them with her squeals.
“I texted him yesterday about a case, he didn’t want in, was being a twat actually but he begged me an hour ago to be let into the investigation. I shouldn’t have said yes but…”
“Taking a shower,” he explains, quite obviously ignoring John’s pointed stare, the miniature bottles of shampoo and soap in his hands. “I’ll report back on the towel situation.” With that, the man takes his bag to the loo and shuts the door.
He’d planned on asking for clarification but before Sherlock could form the words, John started peeling Sherlock’s pants down his body, freeing the trapped erection to the cooler air. Sherlock gasped, shocked, ignoring the sensation of his pants slipping off his feet for the more pressing sensation of his cock slapping his abdomen. How he wanted to take it in hand; instinctively cradle it in his palm and squeeze away the ache.
Without warning John raced around the table in front of the sofa, leapt over the red upholstered chair (
With his ear pressed lightly against the door, he listened to the telly drone on, but no other sounds issued forth. He glanced down at the chrome door handle and dared himself to peek inside. It was imbecilic, the worst mistake he could make, but of course he did it anyway. The lock picks weren’t even needed since the door was left stupidly unlocked.
“If you didn’t want to come over that’s all you had to say!” Sherlock snapped and then hung up on him.
a chance to settle. But then you started seeing Laila and that was... Hard. I reacted badly. The cough syrup, my birthday, the fight, Victor, all of it. I'm sorry, John. You were singing about her and it was like a slap in the face."
John holds onto his serious face by sheer force of will. “Hmm. Sounds reasonable. But what about in a few weeks, when spring hits and you don’t need me anymore? Gonna toss me out on my ear?”
“Maybe you shouldn’t have clocked that bloke so hard in the head, then, hmm?” Sherlock scowled so hard his brow looked to be permanently furrowed. “Why don’t you use your mouth for something other than snogging for a bit and talk Greg ‘round, see if he won’t let us go early?”
Sherlock growled at him. "If you think I would ever just lie here like a rag doll while you-" He sucked in a surprised breath as John sank his teeth into the meat of his arse.  "Oh."
Sherlock was so utterly confused by all John had said he started to retreat into his head to understand. Had he really told John he loved him? When? The cough syrup! Yes, that was the reason behind the anger, now it made sense.
“Oi, what the hell was that?” John called out behind him. Sherlock could hear John’s steps as he ran but he ignored them as he trudged forward against the bitter wind. “I’m talking to you! Stop, dammit.”
Laila had constructed a fun little exercise in which they asked each other questions from the others textbooks and for each correctly answered question, an article of clothing came off. Study sessions of those nature generally didn’t last long.
The next chapter is coming along, slowly but surely. It'll be the last full chapter for sure. I still haven't decided if I have an epilogue in me or not. We shall see.
John’s eyes flew open at nine am on the dot. His mobile screamed at him from the nightstand and he knew without looking that the text was from Sherlock.
“C’mon, John, you can do it. You’re ahead of the curve after all.” She grinned, knowing her wide smile was half the appeal of her beauty. It wasn’t fair.
"Did he manage to find his way back to the group?" John asked, taking a small sip of his whiskey laced dark ale.
He jogged, not nearly as fast, toward the building. It wouldn’t do to storm the premises without first making sure it was clear of drug dealers, so he did a circle around first. It had likely been hours since anyone but the girl had been near, but better safe than sorry. Since no call of alarm had been raised he’d have to assume the kidnapper was long gone. He could see John’s torch beam through the frosted glass window, and then heard his muffled voice, soothing and authoritative. He allowed a smug smile to tug at his lips since there was no one around to see it. It was good to be right. Not that he’d doubted himself for a minute but…
John blinked at that. Strangely tame, considering the vastness of Sherlock’s mind. Not to mention unimaginative since John had just given a musically inclined dare.
They went over the lot of the paperwork quickly, only stopping once, when it asked about recent tattoos.
John blinked...and then he frowned. Sherlock rarely found the word adorable cross his mind, but what else did one call that befuddled puppy look?
“I fucked up,” Greg whispered to Molly when he sat down. Guilt and anger at himself pushed hunger away, even as his splendid dinner was set down.
“Yes! Please.” Sherlock pushed back against that thumb, craving the sudden fulfillment of a more solid instrument.
“I can’t bloody breathe. Would you let go!” He shoved at Sherlock’s ankles where they were locked around John’s waist.
It was messy, their noses bumped more often than not, and it was incredibly wet for some reason, but John didn’t care. He hoped Sherlock didn’t care either. When he’d allowed himself to imagine it, he’d assumed Sherlock had never been truly kissed in his life, not like this. Now that he knew different he couldn’t help but worry, just a bit in the back of his mind. Mostly he just tried not to grind down on top of Sherlock like a sixth former.
John knew he could sit and internally debate all night but his answer was already there.  He didn’t have to like it though. He’d practically been manipulated into it- it was going to drive John mad, he
"John has never been a gentleman with me," Sherlock drawled, generations of smug ancestors with their noses in the air standing behind him.
He marched toward the hall, through the tables that were elevated up from the dancefloor. A quick double check confirmed none of the patrons seated were John either. The hallway was nearly as crowded as the main area, it took a second of scanning but halfway between the exit door and the men’s loo, he found John, crowded up against the wall by a tall black man in a tight green cashmere jumper.
When no response was forthcoming, John contemplated physically assaulting his flatmate. It was possible he could affect a response with violence, and since Sherlock hadn’t initiated a round of boxing matches since the last incident, it might have actually been fun, but no, he’d try verbal communication one last time before shoving Sherlock to the floor.
When John is sent to Baker Street needing help with his Biology, one would assume an Anatomy lesson would be had instead, but this is Sherlock and John we're talking about...navigating their feelings is not their forte.
“Building muscle mass by ingesting large quantities of protein,” he explains and then disappears under the blanket.
“I’ve got plans, mate, what is it,” he snapped, bouncing on his toes. He could tell the bloke and his crew were working themselves up to ask. What was it about today that had everyone so excited about his- completely non-existent now, he might add- sex life?
“Of course. I’ve wanted you for years, remember? If you think I’m not completely overwhelmed too, you’re mad.”
“Sherlock,” she admonished darkly,” if you’ve been chasing criminals again, I won’t be responsible for keeping your brother’s nose out of it.”
Sherlock made no attempt at feigning nonchalance. He stared John down, his mask in place, but his zipping eyes searching John for the truth. He was worried.
going to suffocate. He did pull away, just, but only to quickly latch on to that pale length Sherlock called his throat. He received another groan against his lips and bit down just a little bit harder on the expanse of flesh.
.  Let Sherlock find the lie, let him figure it out. Then maybe he’d see how ridiculous this whole farce was, pinning Victor in the middle especially (not that John wouldn’t happily smash his perfect aquiline innocent nose given half the chance).
Sherlock poured himself from the vehicle and made immediately for the van. John stood off to the side, glad it was near dark, since the shadows of the building were helping to hide the erection he hadn't fully willed away since the car ride. Sherlock's head appeared over top of the van and shouted at Lestrade to come. John waited patiently, silently a little worried Sherlock wouldn't be at the top of his game since he had seemed so distracted by their previous activities being ruined. When Lestrade strode back to Sally and told her to send a few men to the nearest corner shops to ascertain the identity of a white male between thirty and forty, who smoked Richmond Lites and only stopped by before eleven am, John's worry evaporated. Sherlock still had it.
which is a particularly nasty alpha haemolysis found in wild rats with large quantities of sugar in their diets.”
John glanced at Scarlett but she just shrugged. He took her by the shoulder and steered her inside. She seemed to get a kick out of that, like John was scared to go in first, which, he wouldn’t lie to himself, he kind of was. Maybe not scared, apprehensive .
, take your queer shite and get it off the damn street,” the man repeated, fists mirroring John’s, clenching, ready.
The silence grew twice as awkward and John shuffled in place, the sound of his rubber soles on the rug the only indication, as Sherlock’s eyes had closed to the pain gripping his chest. “I’ll see you later, then.”
Once class dismissed, John shuffled forward toward the man’s desk, where he silently packed his satchel with papers from the beginning of class.
Fury, both at Sherlock’s accusations and at his agreement that they’d wasted months of possible snogs and late night shags, had John clasping Sherlock’s wrists in his grasp, had him slamming them down onto the table and pinning them above Sherlock’s head as he crashed their lips together again. His tongue went exploring, welcomed warmly into Sherlock’s mouth; perhaps not expertly, but that hardly mattered to John. In fact, the evidence of Sherlock’s inexperience only seemed to fuel John’s lust. Proof that Sherlock wanted only John, it was a heady sensation.
“Can’t believe that worked,” John mumbled with a chuckle. “Are you in there? I’ve been talking to you.”
“It’s for the best, I’m sure,” Mike muttered in vague reassurance. “Enough about you, I’ve got problems of my own, you know.”
“Maybe so,” he allowed, “but I’d like to think cotton wrapped in plastic wouldn’t ward me off like a vampire looking at a cross, regardless of Harry or not.”
If there was a voice in the back of his mind that screamed he was being reckless, he didn’t acknowledge it.
“Which one?” He asked in a flat voice, knowing Mycroft would understand that the time for games was over.
“You shouldn’t have to,” John stated angrily. “It was just like him, coming here, wrecking everything and then just leaving without thought. He shouldn’t do things like that. It’s…” He trailed off, out of steam already. A sigh escaped and John allowed himself to be pulled forward to lean his head against Laila’s shoulder. “You’re a really great girlfriend.”
“You need to keep an eye on him at the very least. I’ve got business in New York to attend to this week, I can’t follow his every move.”
Hardly inaccurate but… Why was it that Sherlock suddenly wanted to divest John of the attire and not because it was hideous? It was like John had taken his slightly homely attire and turned it on full blast.
“Why would it get awkward?” Sherlock asks, all seeming innocence. He waits for John to explain as if the possibility of someone finding him attractive doesn’t even factor. How is that possible? Does the man not own a mirror? Has he lived in a bomb shelter up until now?
“Let me have a look, sit down,” John commanded, easing Sherlock into his leather chair. He dropped with a grunt and glared up at John as if he’d thrown Sherlock down on purpose. John didn’t dignify the look with a response, simply glaring right back, before he dropped into a crouch to see to the wounded ankle.
“I’m fairly surprised that hasn’t come up, actually,” Sherlock noted innocently. “Why don’t you use sex as a punishment?”
Sherlock grinned and then scared the ever living hell out of John by leaning in close. To his relief, possible dismay, he merely rested his forehead against John’s.
When Sherlock started pushing him back down on the seat John couldn’t help but start laughing into his mouth. He backed up and looked down. At was dark but he could still make out the look of indignation his face.
“We’ll deal with it,” was his only answer. He looked away as Lestrade’s men caught up with them. The armed units got there first and yanked the accomplice to the ground to cuff him. One of them yelled over the whir of the helicopter, questioning what had happened to Petrov, and Sherlock quickly stepped in to explain. John shouldn’t have just stood back, but really, what more could he do? His heart rate tripled when the constable pulled a pair of cuffs and snapped them onto Sherlock’s wrists.
“If you’re thinking of using him as a human puppet, I’ve got to say, as entertaining as that would be, I don’t think it’s going to work,” he huffed as they did their best to heft the man’s considerable dead weight.
“You don’t-“ He pushed his fingers through his curls, a small tug to ground him. “You seem to be under the impression that the integer for peroxide is negative two.”
“-patently fabricated sex-hair. As if I wouldn’t have heard coitus going on practically above my head. This is absurd.”
“Mycroft believes himself to be the center of the universe. I do not.” He shook the bags by his knees as if to say, ‘end of discussion.’
“Not at all, but then I win.” John grinned evilly as Sherlock stood with another huff. He wobbled for a moment, but then swiped the case from the floor. The prep time nearly brought John to bored tears. He shouted for Sherlock to hurry the entire time and nearly got smacked across the face with a bow, but eventually Sherlock got on with it.
He studied his quarry before proceeding. John had never made a study of the human penis, other than his own of course, but he had to admit, this one was quite something. Not quite as… impressive… as his own, but still…beautiful, actually.
"No," he lies, "it's fine. I was being silly last night. You were right, I'm sure it's fine." His smile feels saccharine but if Mary notices she doesn't comment.
People on the street were staring but Sherlock ignored them in favour of listening to Mycroft type. Satisfaction overrode his irritation as Mycroft groaned, as if lifting his fat fingers to type was harder than using them to eat.
The sitting room was deadly quiet. John had stopped the spanking and had yet to speak. Sherlock was still breathing hot oxygen back into his own lungs, and didn’t much care to see John’s face that the moment.
“I, uh, I try not to judge but… yeah, I suppose you could say that. She’s been faffing off a bit with this girl, Teresa. I think that’s why she’s been skipping class lately.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to call him back, but the door snicked shut with an air of finality. Stupid, really, to even bother. If John didn’t feel up to repeating his previous lecture, Sherlock should be grateful.
That hateful bell. John didn’t know how much longer he could take it. Laila and the rest of the crew at Kafé Kerouac swore that eventually he’d learn to tune it out but it had been a week and a half and he was still cringing every time it went off. A real bell he might have handled but the cacophony of electronic dings and whistles together was hell on his ears. He thought about splashing hot coffee on his face about once every seven minutes.
“No, you’re not running this time.” John shoved him again. Sherlock growled but John wasn’t fazed. “Do you know what you made that look like? Do you even care?”
“God help me, you’re probably into the weirdest shit, but I don’t care. Whatever it is, yes.” He was practically clawing at the cloth of the arm rests, swallowing copious amounts of saliva.
Perhaps if Sherlock had suggested a more sexual relationship first thing? Hooked him in with physical satisfaction, then approached the concept of a more permanent situation?
“What else would you want, Sherlock?” He asks and then sucks two long, musicians’ fingers into his mouth.
John began to retort but suddenly Victor’s voice came through his speaker, tinny but understandable. He made sure his sound was as high as it could go and pressed the phone as tightly to his ear as possible regardless.
Either way he misses seeing Sherlock’s beautiful, tear filled eyes on him, so he puts a finger under the man’s chin and lifts his head until their eyes meet again.
Nausea threatened to send John to his knees but he wouldn’t falter. He knew now that Sherlock had a past with this man, he needed to know if they had a future as well.
John took a few tentative steps forward, hand out for the book. Sherlock handed it over reluctantly. John turned the page and grinned brightly.
That bit of leaked information seemed to deflate Sherlock - cat out of the bag as it were. John found himself grinning at the berk.
“Let’s allay some of this confusion, shall we?” He held his hand out casually, as if touching bare skin meant nothing at all. John hesitantly took it. “Mr. Holmes, at your service.”
At one point John glanced over to see Jenny Sheffield giving him the eye from four seats over. He returned it from over the tops of his sunglasses, but with slight confusion.
“Okay,” he replies with a nod. “That’s…good. That’s very good." He pauses and then informs John, "You owe me a laptop.”
“Did we?” Sherlock queried with just the right amount of curiosity. “Funny. I must have deleted it.”
John, for his part, saved what he could and saw that it was filed in an actual system of physical recovery, the filing cabinet, but his actions went unnoticed. Sherlock had his own filing system after all.
“Piss off! I’d never heard that before.” He shoved Sherlock gently with his shoulder. “You know, for someone with absolutely no tact whatsoever, you are remarkably politically correct.”
She looked down at him for about three seconds before she turned around without a word and marched off to finish the fry up, presumably.
John scrambled for his jacket and followed swiftly behind. Sherlock could hardly contain his excitement as he flew down the stairs, skipping the last three entirely.
Sherlock let his eyes lids fall back down, shutting out the sight of John’s anger. He never meant for John to look upon him with such disgust - he’d actively avoided it if anything - but it seemed, yet again, he’d disappointed someone he cared about.
They linked arms, John handed their tickets to the man at the gate, who stamped their hands and wished them a wonderful adventure, and made their way forward down the median of bustling activity. John’s limp slowed them down but Scarlett didn’t seem to mind. He liked that.
“This ought to be good,” John mutters, eyeing the men outside before he turns and awkwardly raises his hands to reach for Sherlock’s arm.
"Boring." Sherlock has managed to eat his portion of chicken, a quarter of John's, and even some of John's spring rolls. This knowledge still makes John inordinately happy, that he can get Sherlock to eat his fill. It's nice to be needed still, at least for something.
While Sherlock was busy panicking, the homophobe was busy working himself up to a strop. “You calling me a queer?” He yelled, voice breaking in his agitation. “I’ll slit your fucking throat, mate.”
John snaps the clip back into the pistol, tucking it back into his waistband, after double checking the safety; he was distracted, he wasn’t an idiot.
“What?” The man’s thick, Barking accent snapped. He took a step forward, a pathetic attempt at intimidating.
Sherlock righted, spinning around to orient himself before John descended. Too late he realised it wouldn’t be that simple.
“I believe you’re thinking of Pretty Boy Floyd, and no, I meant the band, you silly git. The one from the case we just solved not two hours ago.”
“It’s got notes of coffee,” Sherlock noted, the snobby fuck. “I quite like it. I’ll have to remember to thank Mrs. Hudson.”
“Oh.” John snaps back to attention. He quickly opens the door, takes aim again and shoots out the back two tyres as the driver attempts to come after them.
He pulls away a bit more at that, enough that John can see his eyes again. “You do?” He asks softly.
Just as he made to reach for his mobile, the downstairs door opened and closed, seventeen heavy and slightly listing steps later his flatmate appeared.
“Fuck,” John breathed, the tail end of the expletive trailing off into a groan as Sherlock experimented with resistance to pressure, measuring the actual length and girth, now that he could do so with a clear head.
Sherlock glanced up from his mug and John immediately looked down at his own. As soon as John’s lips brushed the rim to take a sip he hissed. Forgotten pain stung his bottom lip; apparently Sherlock
John's colour returned, and he glanced at everything but Sherlock. He hadn't been sure John had. . . expressed interest in that, but now it was obvious he had. So they had both enjoyed it; that was good to know, for future reference. If there was a future to explore. He had better move on.
“Christ, John. Oh, god.” He felt like he was being set on fire. His skin was blazing wherever John’s hand landed, rarely in the same spot twice, but Sherlock could feel was the radiating waves of heat as they made their way across his body. The sensation of immersion, the cocoon of bright pain and John’s tactile strength, deepened until all he understood was pleasure.
“All right. It smells like iron, not specifically blood, but just the mineral rich sands of the area. Bread, someone was always baking bread it seemed like. Car exhaust was a big one, they’re transportation has boomed in the last decade.” He grins in remembrance of a surprise find during one outing. “Weed. It smells like weed. They grow it everywhere. Opium too, but I only ever saw the marijuana fields.”
Sherlock glances over, meets his eye for a second before turning his eyes back to the road. “I mean, that obviously didn’t go how you expected. I imagine you’re a bit put out. Perhaps you think I shouldn’t have let them go.”
The sound of breaking glass filled Sherlock’s ears. He’d done an experiment once, years ago, with shatter patterns of different types of kitchenware; it was possible that was where the audial memory came from. It didn’t matter, really.
Sherlock stared back like he was still on the verge of throwing a hissy fit but eventually he sneered and snatched his coat from where he'd thrown it in his earlier haste.
“I’m not, I’m just resting a bit,” he explains, trying to soothe the man with a gentle hand across his stomach. Sherlock is having none of it, just continues to whinge and pull at his hair, even though John’s still twisting his damn hand up and down his cock with not a small amount of skill.
“Right.” She pursed her lips at him. “You know, it’s a good thing I’m the best girlfriend on the planet-”
“If you’d followed the schedule Molly and I made…” He mumbled, not at all put out to have John posed next to him. Unaware of the perfect reference he’d gifted Sherlock with, John slept on as Sherlock flipped back to his original page. Instead of finishing the drawing he’d been working on, though now that he had John in front of him he had to admit it wasn’t as bad as he’d thought, he started a new one.
John looked up in guilt, but of course Sherlock couldn't even see him. "Maybe you're projecting." He smoothed the tape holding the gauze pad gently and sat up fully.
John was just setting down with his bowl of cereal when he heard a soft, “Did you tell them about the cough medicine incident?”
“Why not?” John quipped with a grin, happy to distract her with something that wouldn’t break the bank.
“Five times now I've tried to initiate,” he admitted softly, “and I'll own every one of those pathetic attempts, even the one tonight. I'm sorry for that by the way." Laila smiled, cheeky thing. “But every time I think, maybe there’s something there, like we’re on the same page, he does something-" John remembered the Victor comment again and raged anew, jaw clenched hard in his anger.
"No," he mumbled, instantly contrite. After the decree that Dr. Watson was never again allowed to give another prostate exam, John had left Sherlock alone on the bed and refused to come back until he'd apologized.
John grew frustrated when after several seconds of digging he found nothing. “Why do you have sea shells and lighter fluid in here? No, don’t answer that. I don’t want to know. I’m not seeing anything, Sherlock, where else would they be?”
John had about a half a second to process how bad an idea what she was about to do was before it happened.
He stopped Sherlock with a steady hand to his shoulder. It was warm, a bit commanding, and Sherlock stopped on one foot to absorb the feeling.
"Alvin Petrov?"  John asked, having caught the name, used to picking out pertinent information amid the white noise.
John took a few hesitant steps forward to greet him but he thought better of it when Sherlock sent a betrayed look over his shoulder on his way to his bedroom. The door slammed hard enough to rattle the glass bottles on the counter in the loo.
"She would sit there at that computer for hours just screaming at you two to blow each other," Mary chimed in. "Drove Jim nuts."
He swallowed several times before he could croak out, "All right. When you're ready." He shouted when Sherlock took him in hand and immediately lined himself up. "Slow! Go slow, Sherlock, seriously."
He knew he was being difficult, that there were patrons behind them now and that he was holding up the line, but he was loathe to let it out of his sight, hated as the thing was. Eventually though he nodded and handed it over. The operator smiled kindly and leaned it up against the gate by his feet with the rest of the purses and prizes won by the other patrons.
John wants to say something equally as poetic, or at the very least, tease Sherlock for being so, but he can’t find the words to speak. Everything has boiled down to the hot feel of slick skin and places rubbed just right and hot breath on his lips. He checks another milestone off the list when he slides his hands down Sherlock’s flanks and grabs onto his arse for dear life. Such a bounty, he’s the luckiest man on Earth in that moment.
Sherlock kept two blocks between them as John meandered forward, and eventually reached his building. He hid behind a shrub and watched John enter. All Sherlock had to do was wait for John to come back and the night could continue as planned.
John scoffed good-naturedly. “I’ll have you know I got this at H&M. It’s a very ‘In’ look, granddad is.” He smiled and it was like icing on a very attractive cake.
It’s all fine. He hadn’t been expecting one. What he also hadn’t expected was the best blow job of his life, so he’ll take what he could get. That thought is followed on the heel by another.
The kid gave him a ‘well?’ look and instead of being put off, John laughed. He received a small smile in reply.
Mary is already up out of bed when John awakens the next morning. Not that it's strange, she usually is, but he feels anxious in her absence. His house coat goes on quickly, the sash tied as he makes his way to the kitchen without even stopping at the loo for a piss.
“No,” he breathed in answer. “Oh, that’s lovely.” His hands ran up under John’s shirt and he raked his nails up and down sensitive skin.
John merely smiled, like Sherlock was being particularly adorable. “How are you feeling now? Better?”
“I ordered a bottle of the 2008 El Gran Enemigo Petit Verdot, if you’d like to share,” Laila offered. She was a ridiculously good actress. One would think she actually welcomed them there. John supposed, in a way, she did; if only to goad Sherlock into acting out.
“I’m going to call for take-away. We’ll have dinner and then we can talk if you want. If not, that’s fine. I’ll give you time to figure it out your own way. But you should know,” he swallowed, feeling brave for the first time since he’d walked through the door after his hard day, “I’ll take you however I can get you. Whether that’s what we have now or something more, it’s all fine. Just know that I love you, as you are, all of you and if you’ll have me, we could make something very fine indeed. More than fine. At least I think so.” He cleared his throat after that monumental but simple speech and started to pull away.
