“When our father died, Michael, as the oldest, took over his position in the family business,” Cas explains carefully. “I told you my family was powerful. Should he choose, Michael has the power to make our lives hell. I strongly suspect that he’s doing this as some sort of PR stunt to improve his reputation. If we don’t comply with his wishes, he could ruin the quiet lives we created for ourselves.”
“No…” he says softly, eyes wide.
I nod. “But…you think he’ll be okay, right?”
He frowns, thinking for a moment. “Because it feels good,” he says finally. “I mean, it hurts, but it’s not…I get sort of lost in it. It’s…”
, the voice in my head answers.
Cas blushes. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so relaxed in my entire life. I don’t want this to be the end. And I…don’t mind having you around.”
“You’ll get sick,” Dean protests weakly, even as he curls up tighter against Cas’ chest.
Cas sighs, smiling slightly. “It’s alright, Dean. I’m very happy here. I rather like being human, most days. It just…happens every now and then. I’ll be fine.” He turns back to the stove, sliding the last few pancakes onto a plate. “Let’s eat. I made some chocolate chip ones for you.”
In truth, Cas hadn’t even really glanced over the menu, but he shuts it anyway. “I’ll have what he’s having.” Jo snorts, but turns and walks back towards the kitchen.
I smile, kissing him softly. "Thanks. Let's do it." Cas smiles, pulling me towards the bathtub, and I hesitate. "I, uh...have something to show you." I pause, taking a breath before pulling my shirt over my head, and his eyes narrow as he sees the strip of gauze taped to my chest. "I'm okay," I say quickly. "I was just thinking, and...I know I get weird about it sometimes, but you know I really want this, right?"
I nod, kissing the crown of his head softly. “Okay. Then let’s talk.”
He glances up. “Breathe, Dean. Trust me.”
“Until you stop flinching when I touch you,” Cas answers. Dean looks puzzled, but the angel smiles. “And then, I’m going to do it for me.”
"Extremely," Sam chuckles, wrapping an arm around Gabriel's shoulders and hugging him close. "I think I'd go insane if I had to stay there any longer."
“I’m not so sure there’s much we can do,” Sam sighs. “If he was taken by angels, I’d assume they’d take him to heaven. We don’t exactly have the resources to get there.”
“Yeah, I know.” He watches Cas for a moment. “So, three in the morning, huh?”
I bite my lip, recalling his shocked expression. “He was...surprised, I guess...he just kept saying he didn’t understand...that he wouldn’t say things like that...that...he didn’t understand why I would think he didn’t love me...I didn’t give him much chance to respond after that...”
I frown at him. “What? That...doesn’t make sense...”
He shakes his head, still yanking at the ropes haphazardly. “Y-You don’t understand Cas, if he...h-he can’t find out, I can’t be this way, he’ll hate me, I’m already a disappointment, I can’t be w-weak like this too...”
“Y-Yes Castiel,” Dean whispers, his skin buzzing in the wake of the angel’s touch. “Y-Yours...”
“You mean like…move in with you?” Cas asks.
Cas takes a deep breath, slowly looking up. "What does that mean, Gabriel?" He asks cautiously.
I snort. “Okay. Can I see it, then?”
“I don’t know,” Cas admits. “Probably not. Scars don’t spread much.” He pauses. “Does it look stupid?”
I frown at him, gingerly picking up the tiny, shrieking creature and holding him out. “You’re kidding me.”
“I think you might change your mind about that before we’re through, pet,” Dean teases. “I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.” Once he’s satisfied that Cas has recovered enough, he gently pulls him off the floor, sitting him down in a chair. “You’re going to have to be still for this one,” he says conversationally as he fastens Cas’ wrists behind him. “Think you can do that for me?”
I rub my eyes, slowly sitting up. “And you stayed here the whole time?”
They’d discovered that Ben preferred to move while he talked, so lately he’s been exploring the various hiking trails on the property during his appointments. “I think I wanna go to that trail you showed me the other day, with all the flowers. But first I have to go feed Hope.”
“Well...we talked about it a little bit yesterday, but...I think I need to explain myself a little better. I know you two are close, so I guess I was just wondering how you’d feel if we were, ya know, officially...”
“Hey Cas. How are ya?”
I laugh, pulling him against my chest. “Best way I’ve ever been woken up.” I sigh, kissing the top of his head softly as I catch my breath. “Hey Cas? I love you.”
He squeezes my hand tighter, nodding to Gabriel who steps closer as Ramiel starts to struggle. There's a bright light as Gabriel lays a hand on his head, and when I open my eyes again he's gone.
“He has been...kind of nice lately,” I admit. “It’s weird.”
“I said come here. Now,” he snaps, rising from his chair. “That
“Quite alright, Dean,” God smiles, waving his hand. “Wouldn’t be the first time someone’s tried. I’m here for a few reasons. I need to speak with Castiel. And you asked me to come, didn’t you?"
a gender, at least not in the typical human sense, he knew that humans, Dean included, viewed him as male, due to the presentation of his vessel. He’d briefly considered trying to explain this nuance, to alleviate Dean’s stress about it, but quickly abandoned the idea, as any attempt at discussion of such things made the human flustered and defensive.
He considers it for a moment. “It’s oddly…soothing. They seem to…respond to you differently. I’ve never experienced that before.”
“G-Good, Sir,” he breathes. For a moment he panics at the idea of what he’s doing, and he looks away, only to be reminded at the sting when Dean’s hand comes down across his skin again. For some reason the reminder settles his nerves, and Dean smiles when he takes a deeper breath. “So good, for me, Cas,” Dean murmurs, starting to kiss and nip along his jaw and neck, not protesting when Cas’ forehead falls to his shoulder. He continues that way for what feels to Cas like a long time, the pressure of his finger slowly increasing. Cas pants softly against his neck, his hips rolling slightly as he listens to Dean’s murmured praise and encouragements. Suddenly, the sensation changes as Cas’ body yields to the light pressure, and he gasps, jerking away from it. Dean must anticipate this, because his hand moves with him, his other arm wrapping around his waist, stilling his movement. “Shh, it’s alright, you’re okay,” he soothes. “Cas, look at me.” Slowly, wide eyes meet his patient gaze. “Did it hurt?” he asks calmly. Cas swallows and shakes his head, trying to control the shaking that’s started in his limbs. “Okay. Are you in pain right now?” Dean continues.
“Go on, baby. Show me how much you like it.”
Cas bares his teeth for a moment, swallowing back a growl. He glances at me, taking a deep breath. "I'm not giving you the chance to harm him. I'm happy with my choices. But I'm not keeping you here either."
“Uh…no. No. I just…hang on for a minute. Stay right there.” I walk back to the bedroom to find Sam chuckling. “What’s so funny?” I growl at him.
She smirks. “And what fun would that be? After all, I’m doing it for their own good. It’s only fair that I get to have a little bit of fun with them while I can. Who’s going to believe a child that says a witch is after them?”
“Is that a short joke?” a disgruntled voice asks behind me. I turn to find Gabriel rubbing his eyes groggily. “What the hell Sammy?” he asks. “Did you roofie me or something?”
“Okay then. I’ll let you rest.”
“Are we putting you to sleep already?” Meg teases him.
The thoughts pushed at his mind, desperate to break free as they tried to pry open his mouth, but he couldn’t allow the weakness. He could leave this with at least some shred of dignity. All that escaped was a laugh, twisted and sour, and listing dangerously into the territory of hysteria. “You’re awfully presumptuous for someone that was begging to be let in not two minutes ago.” The tone was harsh and biting, felt wrong in his mouth, but Dean flushed and looked away, and some part of him reveled in turning the tables on the human, if only for a moment.
Slowly, a smile lights up his features, and he leans in, kissing me softly. “Of course I want to,” he whispers against my lips. “I love you, Dean, more than I’ve ever loved anything. I want to try.” His arms wrap around my neck, hugging me tightly. I feel his grin against my neck. “We can still have sex though, right? In between the hand holding?”
He blushes again, his wings twitching under the praise. “If you say so,” he concedes. “Are they…permanent?” He seems both worried and pleased at the prospect.
Sam smiles, tearing up slightly. “Dean...”
“Chocolate syrup,” he corrects breathlessly when Dean pulls away.
Dean nodded slightly. “Yeah, I think so. Thanks for calming me down. And for listening.”
The only response is a whimper as his hips start thrusting in earnest, growing more erratic. I feel him tense, but don’t have a chance to react before he cries out my name, cumming hard. My first instinct is to panic, but after a couple of seconds I realize that it isn’t really bad at all, and I swallow around him, gently licking him clean. He watches me for a moment while he catches his breath. “What was that for?”
Dean grinned, stroking his jaw lightly. “This is what we’ve been working toward for so long, and I did it. And more than that, I loved it, and I really hope you enjoy fucking me, ‘cause you’re gonna be doing it a lot while we make up for lost time. I can do this, all of it, just like anyone else, and I
“Why would I be mad at you?” I ask, frowning.
Cas smiles, shaking his head. "No, I'm okay...I mean, I'm sure I'll be nervous, but I trust you, and I know you'll take care of me."
“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Dean starts.
Cas follows his gaze, realizing for the first time that Dean hasn’t changed since last night, his clothes and hands still stained with Cas’ blood. There’s even a little streak of it up near his eyebrow where it must have rubbed off. “He’s right, Dean. Go take a shower. I’ll be fine for a little while.”
I raise an eyebrow at him. “Sure, I guess, but…what are you up to?”
“Well it was for you too, of course, but it was for my own enjoyment as well. I wouldn’t have agreed to do it, or to do it more often, if I didn’t want to do it.”
“Ten-four,” she answers, her voice growing serious. “What’s the situation?”
Sam nods, thinking for a moment. “He really does, though,” he says finally. “I mean, I’ve seen my brother go through a lot of relationships. He’s never been like this before.”
The angel sighs, sinking further into the couch. “Well…it’s nothing really. It’s just…I had one of those dreams again. And I didn’t want to go back to sleep and have another one, so I thought trying something new would keep my mind off of it.”
Dean’s hand on his shoulder stops him, and when he looks up he’s surprised by the grin. “No, it’s okay. I’m glad you’re comfortable with that. But I’d like to talk to you, and I can’t really do that when you’re down there.” Cas nods, standing and watching as Dean sits down on the couch. “Come up here.” He pulls Cas into his lap, and Cas is surprised at how comfortably he fits there. He curls up happily, nearly purring when Dean’s hand massages lightly up and down his back as they eat. He waits until they’ve both finished to start. “Can we talk for a minute, Cas?” he asks quietly. He must feel Cas tense, because he smiles. “No, nothing bad, I promise,” he assures him, pausing to kiss him softly. “Just logistics.”
“Dean, promise me you won’t go down there before we figure out what to do. You heard Gabriel. He’s…powerful. I don’t want you getting hurt.”
“Yeah. Well I guess eventually it worked, and they had Luke. He meant everything to Cas. It might not have been much, but he made him happy. He loved that little boy more than anything.”
He nods, kissing my chest softly. “Take your time.”
Dean whines as Cas pulls his fingers free. He carefully coats himself with lube, lining up at Dean’s entrance before leaning over him, kissing him hard as he pushes through. Dean whimpers loudly, his fingers clawing at Cas’ back as his body slowly yields to the pressure. He gasps sharply when the head passes through the resistance, squeezing his eyes shut, and Cas freezes, looking down at him. “Dean? Look at me.” Dean takes a breath, his eyes wide with shock as he slowly looks up. “You okay?” Cas as worriedly.
Sam frowned, walking over to inspect the book he was looking at. “Um...okay...what are you doing?”
He grins, nodding. “Any time, asshole.”
“You know who it sounds like…” Benny says quietly.
“Nope. But it doesn’t look like we have any other choice. I’ll follow your lead.” Cas returns, taking a seat at the table. “Morning,” Sam greets him. “How are you feeling?”
“Good. And rule two: no closing the link. I want to know what’s going on. We’re going to talk about this later, but right now, you’re mine.” A little whine escapes him at that, and I chuckle. “Up,” I order softly. He rises to his feet, keeping his gaze trained on the floor. I nudge his feet apart, pulling his arms up and interlocking the fingers behind his head. “Clothes off, Cas. Now.” They disappear, and he flushes red from head to toe. I slip my hand under his jaw, kissing him softly. He whines, and I pull him closer, deepening the kiss until he’s out of breath. “Good boy,” I murmur against his lips, grinning at his shiver. “Stay still,” I order. I kiss him once more before dropping lower to nibble and suck at the skin above his collar. “Now, I’d love to hear about all the interesting things you’ve been reading about…” Immediately, my head is filled with images straight out of porn, and I wonder idly how far his research went. It takes a minute to sort through them, gaging his reaction to the different scenarios and forming an idea of my own. I walk slowly around him, trailing my fingertips over his skin. Looking over his shoulder, I grin seeing his already hard cock twitch. I wrap one arm around his waist, pulling him tight against me, letting my other hand wrap lightly around the base of his throat. He gasps, but relaxes into the hold, moaning softly as I kiss and nibble along his neck and shoulders. Suddenly, I find myself wondering how far I’d have to go to put an angel into sensory overload. And Cas did say I have to practice, right? I reach down, feeling his breath hiccup as I wrap my hand around him, stroking slowly. His face is red as he bucks into my hand, but he can’t seem to stop the little whimpers and moans from escaping him. My hips rock against him of their own accord as I focus on imagining myself softly rubbing and prodding at his tight ring of muscle. I can tell when he starts to feel it, because his hips press back against the imaginary fingers, then snap forward into my hand again, trying to get both sensations at once. I chuckle, enjoying the shout of pleasure when I picture my fingers sliding smoothly into him, bearing more of his weight as he struggles to stay on his feet. My hand moves faster along his shaft as he trembles, thrusting desperately and erratically into the sensations. “Such a needy angel you are,” I murmur into his ear. He whines in response. “And you want to know something?” I grin, speeding up my strokes, both real and imaginary. Unable to form words, his head slowly turns to look at me, his eyes clouded with pleasure. “You’re all mine,” I growl against his skin.
He nods. “I’ve seen a few. They’re pretty cool. And Meg is good. She knows how to put on a show. But mostly I like to see what happens between the people. That’s usually the most interesting part.”

It takes a minute, but he manages a small, dazed nod. “B-But, I...”
Dean nodded hesitantly, moving closer and allowing Cas to touch his forehead again. He crumpled to the floor under the weight of the memories, the fear and pain and love that Cas had gone through, but he watched them all anyway, tears in his eyes by the time Cas’ hand fell away. “God,” he murmured after a moment. “I really did fuck this all up, didn’t I?”
He shrugs. “For now? I want you to eat. I’ll explain the rest later.”
“What if you can’t be?” Cas asks.
“You go first,” Dean said quickly, his hands fidgeting nervously in his lap.
Love,
An uncomfortable feeling starts in the pit of Dean’s stomach, and he sits up too fast, the room spinning as he slumps forward. The angel grips his shoulder, and it’s like lightning, the shocks ripping through him as he gasps, squeezing his eyes shut. It’s too much; he hasn’t been
Cas nods, relaxing a little. I guess that makes me feel a little better. What do you mean, if it’s something I want? Isn’t it all kind of sexual?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I grab my coat, avoiding the softness in his eyes. “I’m going for a drive.”
The hunter nodded quickly. “Yeah...yeah, sorry, just...thinking. Hey, can I ask you a question? Why are you so nice to me?”
“Never thought you’d be one for ink, Cas,” I tease.
He looks at me for a minute before sighing. “I shouldn’t have said what I said either. I was being an ass. It doesn’t matter to me who you’re with, as long as you’re happy, and I know Cas makes you happy.” He smiles slightly. “I guess I was just mad that you hit kinda close to home on that one.”
Slowly, he smiles, nodding. “I know, Dean. I’ve come to understand that. It’s the same way I feel about you.”
“Aside from the few times I checked on Sam, of course I did,” he answers. “I promised.”
Dad looks me over for a moment, looking like he’s trying to choose a question. “He really used to be an angel?” he asks finally.
Meg smiles, nodding. “Looks like it.” She calls another nurse from outside, and together they carefully remove the tube.
Silently, he looks up at me, a small smile playing at his lips. Instead of answering, he closes his eyes, and I feel a strong wave of emotions. There’s love, but underneath is an absolute trust and a deep sense of security.
comes the soft answer, and I know it’s true.
“Like I said,” I chuckle, “We should enjoy it.”
Cas hesitated, biting his lip for a moment. “Well...My parents, brothers, and sister still live in the city...but we’ve never really been that close. It’s really just me out here, aside from a few friends.”
“Yeah, of course,” John says quickly. “You know I’ve never been picky.” He hesitates for a moment, shifting slightly from foot to foot.
“Yeah, well that’s the trouble with gentleman’s agreements. If you don’t get it in writing, it might as well not exist.” The sigil finished, Dean smirked, looking up at the cloud as he pulled the glowing vial from his pocket. “I drained his batteries. Not an angel anymore. So he’s not yours.”
Cas smiles, squeezing his shoulder gently. “You
I hide my face in a throw pillow, just barely holding back the overwhelming urge to whimper as another shiver runs through me at the feeling of Dean’s fingers moving over my wings. He sighs, but doesn’t stop playing with the feathers. “You know,” he says, “If there was a medal given out for being the absolute worst at feeling good, you’d win every year. You just look like you’re in pain. What happened to all that ‘embracing your humanity’ shit you and Sam were talking about a few weeks ago? Just because you’re fully charged now doesn’t mean that’s all gone. Most people enjoy feeling good.” I frown, considering it. Maybe he’s right. Maybe I’m going about this all wrong. He makes a face. “Don’t tell me you never considered trying to enjoy it.” I shrug. “Okay,” he says after a minute. “Sit up. We’re going to experiment.”
"It doesn't seem weird to me," Cas answers, shifting back on the couch and holding his arms out.
I nod, shifting slowly to lay on my stomach while he rummages around for a moment before settling behind me. I hiss when I feel him gently spreading something over the heated skin, and he chuckles. “Give it a minute, it’ll help.” Sure enough, whatever it is soothes the sting a little bit, and he continues rubbing it in gently for a moment.
I can feel him pulling on the string, shifting everything inside me. “
“Rowena!” Sam grinned, hugging her lightly. “We weren’t sure we’d be able to summon you.”
“Who’s coming?” I ask, starting to find my clothes in the dark. “Cas, where are you? What’s happening?”
“Of course,” Cas hummed, kissing him once more. “Now, let’s go get lunch.”
I wave Sam over, who carefully settles his weight down over Dean’s leg to hold it still. Dean flinches at first, but doesn’t panic. “I’ll be as gentle and quick as I can, okay?” he says softly. “Just me and Cas. We’re not gonna let anything happen to you. Deep breath, okay?”
“Cas-”
“Quiet?” he repeats.
Dean grinned, nodding. “Yeah, absolutely. Deal.”
His head drops forward to my shoulder. “You Sir.”
Dean frowned slightly, peeking up at him.
, that’s exactly what he wants, so Dean closes his eyes and relaxes his throat. They open a moment later at the sharp tap against his cheek. “Don’t go drifting away from me just yet, pretty boy. There will be plenty of time for that later,” the angel smirks, and Dean isn’t sure if that’s a threat or a promise, but he sure as hell wants to find out. “I want you to look at me while I fuck that pretty mouth of yours. Can you do that for me? Can you be a good boy?”
Cas nods, hugging him tightly for a moment. “Thank you for coming,” he murmurs.
“Don’t sweat it, I’m glad I could help.” I pause, rubbing the back of my neck for a moment. “Uh, Cas, you know if you ever wanted to talk or something…I’m around, alright?” He watches me curiously for a minute, his head tilted to the side, before throwing his arms around my neck, hugging me tightly. I laugh, patting his back awkwardly. “Woah, hey, you’re welcome. That’s what family is for. You must be kinda bored in here. Want to go out to the living room and watch a movie?” He nods. “Alright. You need a hand getting there?” He shakes his head. “Okay. You go ahead and figure out what you want to watch. I’m just gonna find a shirt…” He looks at me for a minute, then shakes his head again, taking my hand and dragging me out to the living room. “…Or not. Is this your way of telling me you like me shirtless?” He doesn’t answer that, just sighs and snuggles up next to me on the couch, pulling a blanket over the both of us. It’s kind of sweet. We go through the movie choices, and Cas finally picks Star Wars. He settles back against my chest, sighing softly. “You know,” I chuckle, “You could still hear it through a shirt.” He looks up sheepishly, embarrassed at being caught. “Sammy used to do the same thing when he was scared,” I explain.
“He is,” Dean agreed.
I shrug. “I kinda figured you just did that for me.”
Meg smiles, nodding. “Sure. It should only be a few minutes. I’ll come get you when they’re ready.” She leaves, and Dean takes a shaky breath.
Dean chuckles. “Sorry for the interruption. There was an incident, a few weeks ago. Crowley doesn’t know how to keep his hands to himself. He took advantage of Cas and hurt him pretty badly. Benny had to patch him up. And it looks like he thinks he can do it again.”
He grins, shifting to look at me, and something around his neck catches my attention. “Uh…Cas? What’s that?”
The touch pauses. “You think I’m a prostitute?” Dean asks. His voice is amused rather than offended, but it makes Cas blush anyway.
"I doubt it could hurt," he answers, closing his eyes for a minute. "You know, if we do end up able to hear some of each other's thoughts, it won't be all of them, just what you want me to hear. And even if I could hear everything, I'd never invade your privacy like that."
The angel nodded slowly. “So...your discomfort was not because I have a male form?” he asked.
Dean nodded, taking his hand. “Come on angel, you’ve had a long day. Let’s get you to bed.” He led Cas down the hall, pausing outside the door. “I, uh...sorry, did you...want to stay in your own room tonight? I’m fine either way, but I get it if you want some space...I don’t want to presume...”
He nods. “It takes two graces in agreement before it will happen. It’s not immediate, and will not happen if one side is unwilling. My grace has been willing for a long time now, but even though we’ve been together, you’ve still been hesitant about it. But now you’re finally becoming comfortable with the idea.”
“Hey!” Alfie chuckles from the floor beside a young, dark-haired woman. “It’s not our fault you’re old. And that’s not even my real name.”
Dean smiled, shrugging slightly. “I told him I’d ask...but that I thought you’d like it. You’ve always been more of a dad to me than John ever was. I think you’d be an awesome grandpa, for the record.”
“Right, right. You know, I knew you were planning something, but that…was not what I expected.” He smiles softly, brushing his fingers along Dean’s cheek. “Thank you,” he says softly. “I know you did this for me.”
He laughs, teeth digging into my hip as he threads his fingers through mine, pinning my hands over my head. “Who said I’m teasing?”
Gabriel just smirks. “Oh, he’ll be here in just a minute.”
Dean doesn’t relax, of course, but Cas didn’t really expect him to, only speaking to let Dean absorb his tone, hoping the surety of it moves him closer to a place where he’ll allow himself to be cared for. As much as he wants to berate himself for allowing him to fall so far, he knows he needs to focus his energy on Dean right now if he has any hope of bringing him back after so long falling prey to his own self-destructive thoughts.
Dean snorts, patting Sam's shoulder lightly and smirking as they reluctantly pull out of their kiss. "Congratulations guys... I'm so happy for you."
He makes another thoughtful sound. “But how much do you trust me, pet? Do you trust me to keep you safe? To honor your limits and your safeword, should you use it? To not push you farther than you can take? To care for your body and mind when you give them up to me?”
He shakes his head. “Usually I just take cover until it’s over. He’d never talk to me about his feelings. You’ve seen how he gets. Honestly, since you’ve been here he’s been better than I’ve ever seen him. Is that really a conversation you want to have?”
“We’re not,” Dean agreed, shaking his head. “But honestly, I don’t know what else to do in this situation. Just...look at those tabs and...I think you’ll get it. And we’re not ever, EVER mentioning this in front of Sam. Or anyone. Ever. Got it?”
Sam nods, sighing softly. “We were just talking about that...what did you guys come up with?”
He nods against my shoulder. “Good. Does it feel the same as what you felt just now in hell?” I shake my head. “That’s good. Is anything hurting you?”
“I know. I want to. Is that okay?” Dean nods, his jaw slackening when Cas gives a long, slow stroke. He sighs softly, his head tilting to the side as Cas presses soft kisses along his neck and shoulder. I get to watch you for a change,” he chuckles, watching Dean shiver as his thumb passes over the head. “It’s kind of nice.” He nips at the pulse in Dean’s neck as his head falls back against the couch, then ducks to lick over one pink nipple. Dean gives a strangled groan, his hips rising slightly to meet Cas’ hand. “You’re beautiful, Dean,” he murmurs, receiving only soft gasps in response.
He grabs my hand, pulling me into the living room, where Sam is engrossed in a book, sitting down on the edge of the couch. “Morning Dean,” Sam mutters. “You okay? I thought I heard…” He glances up, freezing with his page half-turned.
Hello all! I've been hard at work on my NaNoWriMo story, but I wanted to post this up for you. Enjoy!
Dean shakes his head. “Nothing, I’m fine. Ready?” Rather than answer, Cas takes his hand, pulling him out of the bathroom and towards the elevators. “Cas? What are you doing?”
“It’s going to be okay,” Cas assures him gently. “We’re all going to get through this together. Take a couple of deep breaths.” Dean nods, trying to obey, and his pacing slows slightly. “There you go. Now, why don’t you try to come sit down? I know you’re nervous, but it might be a while until we know anything, and exhausting yourself won’t make you feel any better.”
That’s all I need to hear before my fingers are in his hair, tugging his head to the side so that I can kiss and bite along his jaw and neck. He groans, his wings appearing as he loses control of them, spreading out against the wall and quivering with pleasure. “Cas…” he whines, “Please!”
“I understand,” he murmurs. “And I want to help. But I also don’t want to do this the wrong way. You’re trusting me, and I don’t want to mess it up.”
I look up at him, and he rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah, I know. I don’t usually like it either. But that’s different. I was trained that way. When you’ve been hunting as long as I have, you realize that letting someone touch you is really just giving them the opportunity to hurt you. Not for you, maybe. But for us lowly humans, that’s just how it is.”
I can’t help the thrill that runs through me at the knowledge that I’ve brought out dirty-talking Cas, but it’s equaled by the relieved realization that he wants this too. “Understood, Sir.” I relax further into my position, keeping still when Cas stands and walks behind me. I listen to the soft shuffling sounds before he returns, running a hand through my hair as a reward.
Cas can feel the blush creeping into his face, and he whirls around to find Dean standing in the doorway, smirking at him. “S-Sorry,” he manages, looking like he’s been caught at the scene of a crime, “I couldn’t remember if you said right or left, and I just…”
I chuckle, kissing his cheek softly. “Sorry. But I’m still not convinced that ‘completely necessary’ is the proper term for all of this stuff.”
Dean hesitates for a moment before slowly approaching him. “Jesus Christ Cas, what happened to you?”
I shake my head hard, gasping. “No. I can’t. If I can’t see it, how do I know I’m not there?”
Hello my lovelies! I'm so sorry for the delay on this one, things have been crazy with the holidays and I'm currently in the jungles of Ecuador for two weeks helping native people build things and trying not to die. Really. Anyway, the internet here is pretty unreliable, but that just means I have lots of time to write new chapters when I'm not soaking wet and caked in mud, so here's an update for you, and chapter five has also been updated, because the ending somehow got cut off when I uploaded it. Enjoy!
“Not a problem. You know I love having you here. You wanna tell me what this is about?” Cas blushes, and Dean raises an eyebrow as he shifts onto his hands and knees, his head dropping. Curiously, Dean walks around him, letting his fingertips drag down Cas’ back as he moves. Something shiny catches his attention, and he freezes for a moment, not believing what he sees, because there’s no way in hell that there’s a shiny silver butt plug sticking out from between his cheeks. He lets his fingers run over the handle lightly, chuckling at Cas’ shiver. “Is this your way of telling me to stop stalling and fuck you already?” Cas just moans in response, his back arching further to better present the plug. Dean toys with it lightly for a moment, watching as he pants and trembles in an effort to keep still. “You sure this is what you want?” he asks finally.
Dean shivered and whined at the words, his answering nod jerky and spastic. “F-Fuck yeah...s-so good angel...please...”
. “This way, if you wake up doubting my desire to be with you, you’ll see it and remember how much you mean to me.”
“I think if you can see who’s around you’re going be more anxious,” he explains. “This is about the experience of it, not about worrying who’s seeing you naked. I think it’ll help you relax. And if we try it in practice and you don’t like it then we won’t next time.”
After the school closes, the four of us head back to search for clues. Dean carefully picks the lock on the doors, and we make our way to the principal’s office. Gabriel and I look through filing cabinets and bookshelves while Sam sits down at the computer, trying to crack the password. One book, a little more worn than the rest, catches my eye, and I pick it up carefully, frowning at the strange writing on the front. “Dean?” I murmur, holding the book up.
He pulls back just slightly, resting his forehead against mine. “Do you want to wait?” he asks softly. His voice has a teasing tone to it, but his eyes betray the fact that he’s completely serious. I know he’d stop if I wanted him to. I also know that I don’t want to stop. Instead of answering his question, I tilt my chin up, catching his lips again, and I can feel him smile as we tumble back onto the bed. My fingers slip under his shirt, attempting to pull it off, but his hand wraps around my wrist before I can. “Now Castiel,” he teases, “how are you going to focus on being quiet if you’re doing that? Am I going to have to tie you to the bed?” An odd little whimper escapes me at the thought, and Dean raises one eyebrow, then laughs loudly. “Castiel: the kinkiest angel in the garrison,” he chuckles. I blush a little, but he kisses it away. “Don’t worry. I like it.” he searches around for a moment, picking up the discarded tie and wrapping it around each of my wrists before securing them to the bars of the headboard. He sits back for a moment to admire his work, then grins. I’m sure he can hear my heartbeat just as loudly as I can. In any other situation, this would be bad. But with Dean, it’s oddly exciting. He goes back to his task, and my fingers clench around the metal bar as I struggle to stay quiet. I’m still taken aback by it every time; how easy it is for him to break my control. I’d assumed that, once I’d gotten used to my new feelings, it would be easier, but instead the opposite seems to have happened. The more familiar this becomes, the easier it seems to be for him to make me lose control, and I couldn’t be happier about that. As much as I know that the thin strip of fabric around my wrists could never truly hold me, I find myself unwilling to break the illusion. So instead I grip the metal tightly while I stifle my moans, shuddering constantly with the added effort combined with Dean’s touch. When I touch him, it’s like exploring a new territory. But when it’s his turn, it’s more like he’s had a map that he’s been studying for years.
Cas nods. “I never realized it was something you needed to hear,” he says softly. Something in me relaxes at that, and I press closer to him, sniffling softly. “Dean,” he murmurs, “What you heard in your dream wasn’t true. It was just your own fears. Yes, you have lost many people, but it was not your fault, and they all loved you very much. And I am not going anywhere.”
Cas turn to show them the light pink marks across his back, and Kevin gasps softly. Benny nods thoughtfully. “He seems to think he can get away with whatever he pleases. I think it’s time we taught him a lesson, don’t you?”
“You’re okay,” I assure him, holding him close. “Just try to calm down, and we’ll figure this out.”
Ben nodded eagerly. “That means I get to stay forever!”
“Aren’t you curious?” he asks.
“I’ll try,” I murmur, taking a deep breath. “Alright…tell him I’ll do it. Just…give me an hour or so.”
“Of course I have faith in you,” Cas answers. “You’ve earned it. I can take chances because you always keep me safe. You let me explore. But more than that…you make me feel like it’s okay to fail sometimes. I can fail and still not be a failure to you. This is the first time I’ve ever felt that way. Thank you for that. I love you too.” He pauses for a moment. “Hey Dean? Did you ever…do something like this? When you were with Benny?”
“I’m still not sure what you’re doing.”
I watch as Dean goes pale, looking between the two of us. His mouth opens and closes several times before he turns on his heel and walks back into the bunker, ignoring us when we call after him. I frown, taking the pictures from Sam and flipping through the rest of them. “I don’t understand,” I say to him, studying the strange markings visible at young Dean’s neck. “What was he doing?”
“Hmm…?” Dean mumbles. “Oh, yeah. Everything looks amazing.”
“That’s why we keep him around,” Gabriel interjects.
as he reached for the door handle. “Hey Dean?” Bobby called quietly, stopping him in his tracks. “I love you, boy.”
“No,” Dean interrupts, shaking his head. “It’s fine, it’s just…I figured you should know, why I got so angry.”
I don’t get the chance to argue before he’s back on task, and I can’t think straight enough to do anything but moan and plead for more. When I’m just on the brink of orgasm he slows to a stop, and I whimper loudly in protest. “No, please Daddy, please let me come…’M a good boy, please…”
The witch smiled. “Well, being queen does have its perks. And I can’t say I don’t have a soft spot for you boys. So then, what is it you need?”
“For…giving me a longer leash.”
Cas chuckles. “You can blame him. It’s his fault.”
I smiles, kissing him softly. “Believe me, I wanted to. But with my instincts already running so high, I didn’t feel it was safe for you.”
The line is quiet for a moment. “What time do you get home?” he asks finally.
The hunter hesitated, biting his lip. “Thought you couldn’t see my insides anymore.”
“Yours…” Cas murmurs.
He gives a soft huff as my weight settles over him. “Okay,” he says finally.
Cas sits down beside me, and I squeeze his hand lightly while I think. “Changelings maybe, but they’d have started killing by now,” I muse. “Could be a witch. No clue why, but maybe she’s…turning them into kids? Sounds like our kinda thing. I’m in. Cas?”
he writes.
Cas’ grin widens. “Gabriel believes he’s found a way to bind us.”
“I’ve been trying not to,” Dean admits. “Do you…think she’s going to be freaked out? You know, about…Cas being here and everything?”
“Yeah, I kinda thought he might be. He had one when he was a kid, until dad made him throw it out. That’s why I bought it.”
Dean groans, panting softly. “Tell me what you want baby…”
He nods slowly, glancing up, puzzled. "Okay..."
He still wasn’t entirely sure how it happened. He’d had every intention of getting through that first time to prove he could, and then giving the angel a swift middle finger at the end, for questioning his bravery. Instead, the moment he hit his knees, he was lost. Cas had somehow found a roadmap to a place in Dean’s mind that even he hadn’t known existed, and had led him there like an expert. Everything he loved about his hunter’s mindset could be found there too: the calm, the way the world narrowed and sharpened, and the way his body relaxed into a familiar routine...and here he could have that, without the life-threatening danger, and usually followed by a mind-numbing orgasm, which was a definite bonus. He’d only caught a glimpse of it that first time, but he knew he couldn’t let it go after that. And at the end he hadn’t even been able to string together a coherent sentence, much less gather his pieces enough to flip off that smug asshole. He never told the angel, but sometimes he laughs to himself about how he’s probably been meant for this role all along. His entire life he’d been trained into a perfect little soldier, made to obey orders. Of course, it wasn’t until Cas that he was given orders he actually wanted to follow. Turns out, when he wants the rewards, Dean can be very,
Benny gives him a glare. “Dean, if you don’t stop pacing over there I’m gonna slap you. You’re making
“That’s true,” God agrees. “But why have you disobeyed orders?”
He blushes again when I show him what I mean, hiding his face against my shoulder. Remembering what he said about sensations, I concentrate as hard as I can on imagining running my tongue up his spine. It takes a moment, but Cas makes a surprised noise somewhere between a gasp and a moan, shuddering beside me. “You’re better at this than I anticipated. Perhaps I have some shopping of my own to do.”
“Hmm?”
Dean nods, taking a seat beside the bed and gently taking Sam’s hand. Cas squeezes his shoulder lightly, waiting anxiously. The room is quiet for a few minutes, and then Dean lets out a soft gasp as the hand in his gives a light squeeze. “Is that…?”
He smiles. “Good.” He continues, making his way slowly up my spine, finding every uncomfortable spot and quickly releasing the tension. The large hands, though powerful, are exceedingly gentle and careful, and I can feel him watching me closely for any signs of pain. I get so lost in how good it feels that I don’t notice how close he is to the worst spots until I feel his fingers moving slowly over the muscles connected to my wings, where the worst of the pain is. I can’t help but flinch when I feel it, and he stops. “That’s where it hurts the most?” he asks. I nod. “Okay. Try to relax. I’ll be gentle and go slowly.” I take a breath as the light touch returns, and he presses carefully into the muscle, a little at a time. The ache is worse here, definitely uncomfortable but not truly painful. I remember to keep breathing this time, and when the tension suddenly releases a little moan escapes me before I can stop it. Sam chuckles, continuing to massage it lightly for a moment, making sure the pain is gone. “Better?” he asks.
It turns out that I’m right, and it isn’t long after they get home that Sam notices the ring. “Hey Cas,” he asks curiously, “Where you get the…” He pauses, glancing at me. “Did you…?”
Dean froze, suddenly noticing the nervous looks Sam was throwing over his shoulder. He turned, his face going pale as he took in the angel’s expression. And Castiel knew that it was no longer the careful mask he’d perfected, that every ounce of shame and rejection and rage was storming across his face just as it was thundering through the rest of him, and for once he couldn’t bring himself to care. “Excuse me,” the angel managed through clenched teeth. The brothers stared silently after him until he made it to the bathroom at the end of the hall, slamming the door shut hard.
Cas chuckles. "So you tell me. I'm rather okay with it."
Cas shrugged, smiling softly. “You’re beautiful.”
He frowns. “Are you sure you’re okay? You look…confused.”
He chuckles. “Well, you didn’t. Not for a long time. Actually, probably not until you stumbled in here all bloody and grabbed onto me for dear life.”
“I don’t know, I don’t know, it hurts!” I manage, the words coming out more like a whimper than I intended.
“I didn’t know you could paint.”
Sam blushes, shrugging. “Look, I wanted to tell you, but I wanted to be sure about it first. Is that so bad?”
“I haven’t punched you yet, or thrown up from all the details about my brother’s sex life, so I think it is.”
“About as well as we can expect,” Benny answers, glancing over at him. “I really do appreciate you calling me. I don’t think there’s many people who would do that.”
After a relaxing morning (and Dean was still marveling at how soft his skin was now), the women took him to a bar for burgers and beer. “Alright,” Jody said after their drinks arrived. “Spill.”
Cas shrugs sheepishly, watching as he absently runs the leather through his hands. “It’s just…my memories of it are horrible. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. Dean says it can feel good, but it’s hard to imagine that considering how much damage something like this did.”

“Well…after we’re mated…I’m still human, right?”
“I’m not sure I remember how.”
There was a certain calm that spread through Dean on a hunt. Nerves could get you killed in his line of work, so he’d learned early on how to focus that energy differently, to let it sharpen his senses and relax his body as it settled over his shoulders like a blanket. Counter-intuitive as it may be, those were the only times he found himself relaxed, and he’d always enjoyed those moments, when he could forget everything else and his world narrowed down to the situation at hand. It wasn’t until he started playing with Cas, though, that he’d realized there were other ways to relax.
“Did you really think we’d miss your birthday?” Jody admonished fondly. “We’re here to take you out on the town!”
He swallows, then shakes his head. “N-No…actually it was rather…pleasant.”
He smiles, running a hand through my hair and down along my spine. “Not done yet, pet. Patience.” One of his hands wraps around the bar, the other gripping my shoulder, and he pushes me onto my back. He picks up the forgotten rope, tying a quick knot to the bar and fastening it to the headboard, using the leverage to pull my hips up higher. His hands go back to the bar, working with sure movements, and suddenly it’s growing, spreading my ankles farther apart, just to the point of uncomfortable. He notices the curve of my shoulders, pulled up off the mattress by the cuffs at my wrist, and he presses down lightly on the backs of my thighs. “If you bend your knees a little you can lie down a little more comfortably.” Seeing as I don’t seem to have much choice, my knees bend, the spread of the bar forcing them out to the sides, which eases the strain on my shoulders but exposes me further to him. And I realize why he said I’d be uncomfortable. It’s not the stretch or the bindings themselves, but the way that absolutely
“So, let me see if I’ve got this right. Your grace…proposed to me, and my soul said yes?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I shove him lightly. “Shut up. It’s just nice to be a part of the club once in a while.”
“Well, yeah, but…” he mumbles.
He picks up his bag, walking out the door, and Cas smiles up at me. “That went well, yes?”
Dean hums in approval. “I do love playing with it. It’s so pretty, the way it reacts to me…” Cas only mewls in response. Despite his recent orgasm, it isn’t long before Cas starts to writhe in his bonds again. “So pretty for me,” Dean murmurs, nuzzling between his shoulder blades. “Gonna cum on my fingers, aren’t you? Get you nice and open for me…tease this greedy hole until it’ll take anything I want, huh?”
“You’ve never listened to me before, I see no reason you should start now,” I smile.
Dean chuckles. “I couldn’t help it. Did you see yourself?”
“I don’t know,” I admit. “But we’ll figure it out.” This doesn’t do much to calm him, and his breaths grow more erratic as I half drag, half carry him to his room, sitting him down on the bed. “Dean, you need to calm down,” I say calmly. “You’re going to make yourself sick.”
“You make me sound heartless!” Gabriel protests. “I was concerned.”
Ben glanced up, pouting, and Cas chuckled. “Now that we’re home, you can hang out in here whenever you want, I promise. Let’s go eat.”
“Yeah, just a little,” I mutter. “So are we… ‘mated’ now?” I ask hesitantly.
Cas chuckles. “I don’t know, but he’s currently vomiting uncontrollably, so I don’t think you want him there.”
Hello from quarantine! Guys, I'm so, so bored. But maybe this will be a good opportunity for me to finish up some old stories! I hope that I can give at least one person something to look forward to while they're sitting at home. Enjoy!
Love,
Cas nods eagerly, pupils dilated when they meet Dean’s gaze. “Yes Sir. I can’t wait.”
The object shifts inside him when Dean moves, pressing the long string of beads to the back of his thigh so that he can feel the cold metal. “How’s that for a reward?”
I sigh, hugging him tightly and burying my face against his neck. “I’m sorry, Cas. I’m so sorry.”
“I’m glad to hear that. That’s exactly what I was trying to do. It wasn’t that hard, once I figured out what was going on. I knew you were too scared to listen to me on the outside, so I had to find a deeper way to communicate with you. It was actually nice for me too. I got to see how your soul really felt about this.”
Sam nods. “That works for me...have you thought about what you’re going to do with the whole...you and Cas thing?”
Cas smiles sheepishly. “You were asleep for a long time. I spent the time figuring out what happened.”
“Well, I think we should probably keep the bandages where they are for a little while longer, just to be safe. None of us want to go through this again. But I think it’s healing well. You’ll be good as new soon enough.” He gently helps me into the water, which is just on the right side of too hot. “I’ll let you relax for a while,” he murmurs. Before I can even think, I find myself reaching out and grabbing onto his wrist. He turns back, surprised. “Do you…want me to stay?” he asks.
I think about it for a minute, taking a deep breath. “Honestly? I want to go home.”
Slowly, Cas nods, kissing my cheek softly. “Okay. Thank you for your honesty.”
In the morning, I wake up to light touches stroking over my skin, a comfortable weight on either side of my hips. I shiver, sighing softly and hearing Cas’ low chuckle. “Good morning, Dean.”
I can feel Sam’s curious gaze on my back, and I know he’s heard, but I ignore it for now. “Good boy. So I need you to trust me when I say that you can do this. We have to fix you, Dean. But we’re going to get through it together. I’m right here. Can you try to stay calm for me?” He nods again, though reluctantly, and I slip behind him, leaning back against my chest. His breathing is still too tight, but I wrap my arms around him, murmuring soft praises, and after a moment he starts to relax into me. He’s nothing If not well-trained. “That’s it. Good boy. I’ve got you. You’re okay.”
Cas grins. “I was thinking that you talk about cars like Da Vinci probably talked about paint, or Michelangelo talked about marble. It’s interesting.”
“We know,” I assure him. “Just try to stay still. It’ll be over before you know it.” Slowly, I move forward again as Dean moves in closer, preventing him from backing away. The angel hisses, pressing back against Dean, to gain comfort or to attempt escape or maybe both. I can’t tell. He takes Cas’ hand anyway, giving what comfort he can, clearly unnerved at how quickly his angel is turning into a frightened child. “Almost done, I promise,” I murmur. Finally, the dried blood is washed from his skin, giving me a better look at the wounds. “Okay, all clean. I’m just going to bandage them. It won’t hurt,” I assure him. Cas nods, relaxing somewhat against Dean as I carefully cover the wounds.
“He doesn’t need to,” he answers, smiling. “But he likes to sometimes. I’m sure he’ll be up once he smells bacon.”
I feel myself blush, nudging him lightly. “Oh great, now I’m gonna have a boner too.”
“Yes,” Rowena agreed, resting a hand on his shoulder. “You’re far too handsome to spend eternity in a void, dear. We had to set things right. Now, not that this little reunion isn’t lovely, but I’ll have to be getting back to my duties, so do you need anything before I go? Does anything hurt or feel strange?”
Sam snorted, shaking his head. “You seriously don’t know what his issue is?”
Dean smiles, reaching out to brush the hair out of his face affectionately. “Don’t worry about it. I’m just glad you got some rest. Are you feeling better?”
“No we can’t, because I know you better than that and you’re upset. Do you…know Lucifer?”
He nods, writing on the pad again.
Slowly, Cas pushes further, moaning as he allows himself to appreciate the tight heat. He watches, fascinated as he slowly moves in and out. “Dean…” he groans, “God, you’re so sexy…”
Meg chuckled, nodding. “Well, I’m happy for the three of you. You two have worked miracles with that kid. How’s he doing otherwise?”
I sigh, leaning back against the wall. “It’s not just other people. It’s mostly just Sam. I’m his big brother. I’m supposed to be this big, tough guy. I’m not supposed to enjoy being ordered around and taking it up the ass and whatever. I mean, God, I asked to be spanked today. If he ever found out…”
“No!” the human said quickly. “God no. Okay, look...I should never have said that stuff, especially not the way I said it. I was upset, and it all came out wrong.”
Raphael frowns, but his expression remains smooth for the cameras. “Of course not.” He turns to glare at Dean. “We are delighted that you could share in this special occasion with us. A pleasure.” He reluctantly offers his hand, which Dean squeezes maybe a little too tightly.
“You…just thought you were doing what I wanted?” Dean murmurs. “You didn’t want to leave?”
“It’s kind of a long story,” he explains. “I was what you might call a troubled teen. And after everything with my dad I was so angry all the time. I hated him, and myself, and I just didn’t how to let go of it, you know? I started sneaking into bars, and I’d get drunk and start picking fights and stuff just to get some of it out. Even Bobby’s patience was wearing thin when I came home torn apart at three in the morning all the time. Anyway, one day they opened a new bar in a shitty part of downtown, so, naturally, I went to check it out. Got the shit kicked out of me in the alley behind the place. I was sitting there, bleeding, trying to figure out how I was going to explain this one, and this guy was just standing there watching me. I said something nasty to him, and he laughed. Told me if I was so desperate to get my ass kicked I should at least do it with someone who respected me. I didn’t have a clue what he meant, and he was just staring at me. And then he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to my feet and told me to come with him. So I did.”
I frown at that, considering it. “I didn’t know angels were children at some point. So angels don’t ever have their wings touched?”
I feel myself go red. “Maybe.”
Cas nods, scribbling it down. “Okay. Now we’re done.”
Cas nods. “I know. That’s why I’m not worried.”
Cas nodded curiously, staying still as Dean cautiously moved closer. He took a breath, closing his eyes before softly pressing their lips together. When he pulled away, Cas looked at him curiously. “Okay?”
“I’m a teacher, actually,” Cas answers. “I teach in the English department of the local college. What about you?”
Cas frowned slightly, and even though Dean wasn’t looking, he could feel Sam’s bitchface from across the table. Even Jack glanced up at his tone, looking between the two of them curiously. “It’s a march, actually,” Cas corrected. “The websites were very clear about that. But I thought it would be nice for us all to go together.”
“Nothing to be sorry for,” he answers, smiling. “Can you tell me what happened?”
Sam laughs, ruffling his hair. "Yeah, I might still say yes to that one...really though, thank you guys... I think I would've gone crazy without you. I know I still have some healing to do, but..." he smiles shyly, squeezing Gabriel's hand. "You definitely make it more bearable."
“It’s an expression, buddy,” Dean laughs, really laughs, for the first time in so long. “Don’t worry about it. But I do feel a lot better today than I did last night. I mean, health-wise.”
He whines softly as my lips trail down to the soft spot over his pulse, and he tilts his head further to make it easier. “Look, we already found something you like,” I chuckle, nipping at it lightly. The only answer is a quiet gasp. I continue along his collarbone and down his chest, pushing him back and straddling his waist, occasionally leaving dark love bites scattered across his skin. I watch his face carefully as he gives in to the sensation, his eyes closing as he tips his head back against the headboard, one of his hands tangling in my hair. Quickly, I move back up, nipping lightly at the base of his throat and chuckling at his shiver. His fingers scrape uncertainly at the hem of my shirt, and I lean in to kiss him softly again. “Cas, what are you trying to do?”
“Wait a minute,” I interrupt, “how did you know this morning?”
“That you can do this to me so easily,” Cas grins. He gently coaxes Dean’s head back, sucking and biting softly at his throat and smiling at the soft moan.
Cas smiles at that, nodding thoughtfully. “Can I think about it for a while? I’m not really sure yet.”
“It’s not quite like that,” I explain. “Like I told you when the link appeared, you will not be pushed into anything you don’t want. I won’t let that happen. I think, like last time, your soul is opening up more; responding to our bond differently than before. It’s a gradual process, but I think the manifestation is…opening that door for you. For us. But I promise you, this is not something you have to do. This is always a choice for you. We don’t have to do anything until you’re ready. Or ever, if you don’t want.”
“Green,” he breathes quickly.
He disappears, and Dean shakes his head, continuing on to the kitchen. Once he finds food, he sits down and looks over at me. “What’s going on with them?”
Cautiously, I lean down to kiss his knee just above the scrape, surprised when his cries quiet. “Is that better?” I ask. He nods, sniffling and wiping his tears while Sam hands me a Band-Aid and some antibiotic cream. Once it’s covered, I kiss his forehead softly, picking him up. “There we go. All fixed.” He smiles a little, hugging me tightly. Once back in the living room, I sit down with Dean still in my lap. “You want to go play again?” I ask. He shakes his head. “Want to sit with me for a little while?” He nods, so I pick up the book and keep searching from where I left off.
“Well, I suppose that kinda depends on what you want to do,” Benny answers carefully. “This guy…he’s into some bad stuff. We can go after him if you want, but you should know it’s probably going to get complicated. It’s up to you. Whatever you want to do, we’ll be behind you.”
Dean chuckles softly. “I’d hope so. So, is it really terrible to relax for once?”
“Something shady going on with the principal, but I don’t know if it’s our kind of shady or spending-the-school’s-money-on-crack kinda shady. Nothing concrete. I was thinking we could go back tonight and check for hex bags,” Dean explains.
He frowns for a moment, pushing me back until he can settle against my chest, leaning down to kiss me again. “Dean, you did fix it. You fixed me. I was so broken when you found me. You put me back together again. Just like you promised.”
I nod, hesitating before leaning in to kiss him softly. “Yeah, for a while now. I was thinking, maybe, if you don’t mind, you might wanna…” I chuckle, hugging him tighter. “Maybe I should try that again.”
“I’m not sure what you mean.”
Dean flushed, shrugging slightly. “I know I always said I wanted to go out in a blaze of glory, but...after everything...after losing everything...I’m tired, man. I think I’m realizing that...I don’t always have to hold the whole world on my shoulders. There’s plenty of hunters out there who can pick up the slack. I think I’d just...I’d like to enjoy things, for a while. Especially if you’re going to stay. All those things you said...I want to do those things too. I want to...figure out how to be normal, with you.”
“Well, I’d better get out there before he comes looking for me. I’ll be back in an hour for your session, Dean. If the kid gets us lost, send out a search party.”
“Yes. I promise.”
“Nothing yet,” Cas assures him, brushing his hair back gently. “I’m glad you got some sleep though. Gabriel is watching some sort of baking show. I think they’re making pies, if you’d like to join him.”
“I-I think there’s been a mistake,” he manages finally, his voice cracking.
Dean hums happily. “Yeah, it was a lucky find. It’s nice not to live out of a suitcase anymore. It was kinda weird at first, but now it really feels like home.”
He shrugs. “Well it doesn’t have to be. And it’s not going to be.”
Cas nods slowly. “More specifically, he’s after both of us because I got to keep my mate, and he did not. The rules have changed a bit over the years. When the gates were reopened, he was welcomed back. But his resentment has twisted him. When we ended up on different sides of the rebellion, I believe he saw his chance for retribution. I think he showed you what he did with the intention of convincing you to leave me for my own good.”
Cas nods. “Of course. Just take good care of him and we won’t have a problem.”
Dean smiles, squeezing his hand lightly. "I love you too..."
Cas froze for a minute, trying not to analyze what the sudden pain in his chest might mean. “Oh. Go…where?”
“Are you sure that’s Gabriel?” Dean murmurs to me.
I look up at him, puzzled. “What do you mean? You can’t know. And if you’re going to try that ‘all mothers love their sons’ bullshit please don’t.”
Cas smiles, kissing his cheek. “She doesn’t think that, Dean. She’s…different than most people. That’s why I decided to talk to her. And even if she did think that, I wouldn’t listen. I know the truth. You don’t abuse me or make me feel like less than you, and you’re nearly fanatical about my well-being. Regardless of what anyone says, this is my choice.”
“Promise me you won’t go after Karael without me.” I was hoping it wouldn’t be that. I hesitate, and Cas frowns. “You weren’t planning on letting me be a part of the battle, were you?”
His wings flap lightly at the praise, and he glares back at them. “Easy, you two. Keep it together.”
Love,
“Of course I do,” I groan. “Cas, I love you. And I trust you. I would love to be able to give that to you. But when I really think about it, I just…I panic and lash out. It’s not because I don’t trust you. It just…it gets all mixed up in my head, and I can’t stop it.”
Cas chuckles as the tips of Dean’s ears turn red. “Yes Ma’am. Ellen, this is Castiel. Cas, Ellen.”
Cas frowns. “For what?”
Cas nods, and manages not to jump when Dean’s hands settle firmly on his hips. “It’s good to have you back, Sir…”
Dean sighed softly. “Well, now I feel like an ass. But thanks, for letting me know what’s up with him. I should go talk to him.”
Cas blushes under the praise, turning his attention to the empty room again. “Where…?”
“That sounds much better than my original plan,” I remark.
It wasn’t that Castiel needed to shower, but the hot rush of water over his vessel helped him focus sometimes, especially when his treacherous emotions rebelled against him. It was also a guaranteed way to be left alone, he assumed because the thought of accidentally seeing him naked might cause Dean to vomit. But now the spray did very little to calm him, even as he turned the water up to scorching. That these feelings that he shouldn’t even

He gives an exasperated sigh. “Look Dean-o, what you do is up to you. But if you really care about him like everyone in the known world can tell you do, put your stereotypical manly bullshit aside for a minute and just talk to him. I don’t want to see him hurt any more than you do.”
“Then what?” I breathe into his ear, grinning at his shiver.
I think for a minute, then take him by the shoulders, gently pushing him back. He watches me cautiously, tensing as I slowly part his knees to expose the scars. I feel him lean back as I move forward, holding his breath. I glance up at him as I slowly lean down to kiss the marks gently. He lets out his breath, his eyes closing as I move to repeat it on the other side before stroking his cheek lightly. “I’m sorry, Cas. I know it wasn’t really me, but I’m still sorry that someone hurt you. And I know nothing I do could ever make up for that, but I’m going to do everything I can to make this right.”
I chuckle, kissing him softly and letting him pull my shirt off. “Well I’m glad to hear that.”
Dean pinches the bridge of his nose, unable to stop the tears flowing down his face as he trembles. “I was so scared, Cas,” he mumbles. “You can’t understand…how fucking scared I was...all the time…and you know what he did, when I tried to tell him? He got mad at me. He hit me and…told me not to be a baby. I was seven. And I never told anyone I was scared every again…”
See, I told you it was porn. But even so, I'd love to hear what you guys think! Drop me a line!
“Why don’t you just fix him now?” Dean asks.
“You said that people use it with a partner,” Cas said, “And we’ve been partners on many hunts together. Not to mention the profound bond that we share. If we’re partners, we could use it together, like you said.”
“What do you mean, anyone like me?”
“As far as I’m aware,” he replies. “Just thinking.”
When he wakes up again, it starts with him snuggling up against my side. I chuckle softly, and he looks up, puzzled. “Morning,” I murmur. “Any more nightmares?” He shakes his head, rubbing his eyes tiredly. “Good.” He sighs softly, nuzzling into my chest in a sleepy, affectionate gesture that reminds me of a cat. “Are you always this cuddly when you wake up?” I tease lightly. He blinks for a moment, seeming to realize what he’s doing, and pulls away, blushing. “I’m only kidding, Cas. I don’t mind. You feeling alright?” He gives a small shrug. “Better than a no, I guess. Hungry? I can get Sam to bring some food.” A little bit of tension creeps back into his posture at the mention of Sam, but he nods, reaching for his pad and pen while I send a quick message to Sam. I watch him stretch a little, wincing. “You’re starting to look better, at least.”
Cas nods. “Much better.” Something catches on fire, and Cas turns to look at it. “Is that supposed to happen?” he asks.
Cas nods. “If you think it’ll help…how exactly do we practice?”
I feel the heat rise to my cheeks slightly, focusing on the pan in front of me. “Just not used to all the...touchy-feely crap. Although, between that one and Cas, they seem determined to subject me to it anyway.”
“And are you using it?” Dean asks softly.
Suddenly I remember every time Dean has asked why I love him; every compliment and gentle touch he’s shied away from. He’s grown so much, but the seeds of his own self-loathing are still there. “That’s why he thinks so lowly of himself?” I murmur.
He smiles softly. “I have always thought so.” He grins. “Not a terrible way to wake up, is it?”
He glances up again, surprised. “A deal?”
“That must have meant a lot to you,” Cas murmurs, pressing closer against his side.
“As long as you want,” Cas answered, puzzled. “We’ve talked about that before.”
I let my own wings appear, and Sam’s arch toward them desperately. I feel him shudder when my feathers brush over his, but he relaxes slightly, nodding and taking a breath. “Right, okay...you’re...not mad?”
He shakes his head, dusting himself off. “I’m fine. Go help Sammy.”
Cas hesitated. “I’m...not exactly sure...years. My brothers and sisters...they believed that I was created...flawed. That my love of humanity is what led me to rebel against my own kind. But, since I’ve met you, I...I’ve developed a different theory. I believed I possessed a love of humanity...because I was destined to love you. Despite everything we’ve been through...it doesn’t go away. The ‘bug’ in my programming...it was you. It was always you. I love you, in every way a human can perceive love, and maybe a few that they can’t.” His voice hardened again. “But that doesn’t matter. The fact is that you don’t want me that way. Or any way, really. You can’t even bear the thought of it. So I’ll...I’ll keep it in check, when you have need of me. And when you don’t, you can stop pretending that you want me around.”
“I didn’t mean…well, I just…”
Gabriel snorts, and Cas rolls his eyes. “You know, if this were any other time I’m smack you for asking that. But honestly, I’m just glad that’s a semi-normal thing for you to say.” He glances at Meg. “So? What’s the verdict?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hello my lovelies! Life is crazy. But I've been working on this one for a while and wanted to post it for you. Happy Friday!
Cas chuckles. “I figured as much. Still, you seem rather fond of her.”
He grins, leaning over to kiss me softly, carefully pulling off my coat. “Then I don’t suppose anyone would mind if we got a little more comfortable.”
“How did Charlie hack into the police records?”
He nods, finally settling down and closing his eyes. It’s only a minute or two before he’s snoring softly. “What are you going to do?” Sam asks quietly, careful not to wake him. “Stay up all night with him? Do you want to take shifts?”
Standing in front of the bunker’s entrance is strange, almost like looking at a version of himself he doesn’t quite know anymore. He takes a deep breath, grabbing onto Cas’ hand before moving forward. They enter the garage first, and Dean smiles, seeing his baby as pristine as she was when Cas returned her here. There hadn’t been much need to drive with Cas, and it had made sense at the time to leave her somewhere safe, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t miss her. He pets over the car’s hood for a few moments before finally approaching the door to the rest of the bunker.
One eye opens at me. “Do you not do this?” he asks.
I have to fight the urge to growl at him again, because I know he’s right. I take a breath, sighing. “I don’t know what to do, Sammy. He needs our help.”
“Is he alright?” Sam asks, looking at me.
Cas nods. “I’m pretty familiar with that feeling.”
“Now that makes me nervous,” Cas chuckles. “Though I do suppose I have a couple of things to thank him for. Charlie will be thrilled. She’s been bothering me about meeting you since I mentioned you in an email.”
Dean chuckled, rubbing her forehead. “Don’t worry Baby. I won’t let anyone hurt you.”
Dean frowns. “I didn’t ask for a visit, I just…I asked whoever was listening to look after Cas.”
not to mention
Cas nods, kissing his nose lightly. “I’ve been thinking about how to go about this all day. You were so brave to come to me about this, to even consider it, and you trust me. I never want to make you feel unsafe when you put your faith in me so completely.”
Love,
He tilts his head a little. “It’s only one voice.”
“You did. Now, if you could kindly uninterrupted it…”
Hello my loves! Lots of exciting things coming, so enjoy!
I frown. “What? I was asleep! What did I do now?”
Sam finally gets the door open, slipping a small syringe into my pocket. “Sedative. Just in case,” he murmurs under his breath.
“Not really,” Cas answers. “Just a little more sensitive than the other ones. You can keep going.”
Sam and Gabriel go into town while I wash the dishes, and Cas comes up behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist. “Gabriel’s not going to out you,” he murmurs. “You can relax.”
“Well I guess we’ll see, won’t we? Gonna make you lose it one last time. Gonna work you real good baby boy, nice and slow, gonna make you cum so hard…”
“Good,” I murmur, kissing his forehead. “Then you know I won’t ever force you to tell your father things you aren’t comfortable with him knowing. So we’re going to talk about what you want to do, and how we can get there."
Sam lets out a slightly hysterical laugh, his wings still twitching nervously. “This is insane...”
There’s a shout from inside the barn; I can’t understand the words, but it sounds like an order. Demons stream out of the barn, and I tense, my hand on the knife, but they stop a few yards away. Slowly, the crowd parts for a tall man with a dangerous smile. “Castiel,” he greets as he reaches the front. “How nice of you to come see us. We’ve missed you.”
He hated being human, in those early weeks. Hated the soft looks of pity the brothers gave him, and the nightmares that exposed his weakness. Hated the pain and the constant barrage of emotion, unchecked by any amount of logic he could muster. But slowly, things began to change. Slowly, he made peace with his new predicament. The dreams eased, and he learned to decipher the confusing mix of feelings inside of him. He even learned some skills, so that he’d feel at least a little useful to the brothers, even without his powers. Sam had been kind enough to teach him what he knew about first aid, so that he could at least help them in some way while they continued to hunt. Dean had even started to teach him some basic fighting skills when they’d realized that Cas’ control over this body was somewhat awkward, now that his actions weren’t informed by extra angelic senses, although these lessons usually ended with the hunter flustered and red in the face for reasons Cas couldn’t quite piece together. Still, overall, he’d started to settle into his new human life, and even, on some level, feel comfortable in it.
Cas snorts, sighing as he settles into the hot water, the tub big enough for him to sit against Dean’s side. Dean wraps an arm around him, and Cas is privately pleased to see a slight tremble still in the fingers. He leans up, kissing Dean’s cheek softly. “Hey Dean? Thank you, for earlier. I know it’s not the easiest job.”
He only gets that far before Dean finds himself nearly lifted off the ground in an enthusiastic hug. “Dean! It’s so nice to meet you finally.”
I grin, slowly sliding my hand down between his legs. “You touched that tight hole of yours, didn’t you?” He chokes out something that sounds like a yes, his hips struggling to push up into my hand, still moving slowly over his cock. “Is that all you did, Dean?” I tease him, biting at his neck and sucking bruises there. He shakes his head hard. “No, you explored this pretty ass, didn’t you? Stretched it open, imagined it being someone else…imagined it being me. Isn’t that right?”
I shake my head, releasing the breath I didn’t know I was holding. “No, it’s fine, it’s just…different. I just need some time to get used to it, that’s all.”
He nods, reaching out for my hand. “What are you reading about?”
“I know you know exactly what you’re doing. Why do you insist on teasing me?” The last part comes out like a whine.
He shrugs. “Whatever works. Have fun.”
“Of course you can,” Dean says. “Just let us know when you make a decision.”
“Someone tried to steal his mate, who then teased him mercilessly until he broke down.”
Dean laughs, undoing his belt and shoving his pants down, grinning at the shiver that runs through him at the sound. “And I intend to give it to you.” He flips Cas over, settling between his knees and leaning down to plant soft kisses between his hips. He pulls back for a moment, taking in his flushed face. “God, you’re beautiful,” he murmurs, stroking his cheek lightly. “You’re sure?”
He frowns for a moment. “What if we can’t?”
“Not all night,” I mumble back. “Just most of it. I couldn’t sleep.”
“It hurts,” he mumbles against my neck.
“It’s addressed to us,” Cas answered, as if that was obvious. He picked up the lid of the crate, and sure as shit, there it was:
“Good. Then you have to calm down, alright? I’m not going to let anything bad happen to you,” I say calmly. “I know this is…frightening, but I’m here to protect you. I need you to remember that.”
Dean opened the notebook, and though he was still out of practice, it was a little easier to form the letters now.
Benny chuckles. “And you don’t want to be alone if something happens?” he guesses. Dean smiles sheepishly. “Yeah, sure. I’d love to. Sweet dreams, Dean.”
Cas sobs with relief, his distressed whimpers quieting when he feels the tip of the plug teasing at his entrance. Though he knows he doesn’t really need to, Dean works it in slowly. Cas lets out a strangled yelp as it slides into place against his prostate, then falls completely limp under Dean’s hands. Kneeling down beside where his cheek is pressed to the leather, Dean discovers that he’s out cold, and he can’t help but laugh at the fact that Cas orgasmed himself into unconsciousness. He strokes his palms slowly over his still-shaking form, and after a few seconds his eyes flutter open again. “Cas?” Dean murmurs, stroking his hair lightly. “You with me?”
Cas smiles, leaning up to kiss him softly. “Thank you. That helps.”
“I love you too,” he murmurs, kissing him softly. “You don’t have to be sorry.” He pulls Cas down to the bed with him, keeping him close. “Can we talk about what happened a little?”
Castiel considers it. “It’s still painful, but not excruciatingly so. It’s bearable. Thank you.”
“Do you have to say it like that?” Cas mumbles, going redder.
Gabriel nods slowly, raising an eyebrow. “Why didn’t you ask Cassie?”
Love,
His hand comes down over my hole with a sharp smack, and I jolt forward, taking him as deep as possible and moaning loudly, hearing his muffled curse. “Stop,” he growls. I freeze, but his tight grip keeps me in place. He pants softly for a moment, his fingers stroking lightly through my hair. “Color?” he asks finally. I tap his thigh once. “Good. How do you feel about staying like this for a little while?” I consider it for a moment. It’s not the most comfortable position, but if I focus on breathing through my nose I can do it, and something tells me it’ll be worth it. I tap him once, and he smiles. “Good boy. Tap twice if you need a break, understood?” I nod a little, closing my eyes and focusing on the feel of his fingers on my skin.
I nod, closing my eyes again and relaxing under his hands. “Yes Daddy…”
Dean huffs, rolling his eyes at me. “Oh shut it.”
Cas shook his head. “Dean, if you think I can’t love you because you’re not ready to have sex with me, you haven’t been paying much attention. I don’t care if you never want to have sex. I can live with that. I just can’t live with you thinking that’s all you are to me. We can still love each other without that. I love you because of who you are. Because you’re...smart, and funny, and I feel good when I’m around you, in a way I haven’t felt in...god, years. If you want to try, we can take things as slow as you need, and we’ll deal with whatever happens. But please don’t think I’d give up on you for something stupid like that.”
The line is quiet for a few moments. “You sound more scared than I’ve ever heard, brother,” Benny says quietly. “You must really love him.” He pauses. “Alright, I’m on my way. Just keep him calm and keep him awake.”
Dean startles, looking up at him. “Yeah,” he says, barely over a whisper. “Yeah, I was…” Cas smiles, gripping his chin gently. Dean sucks in a sharp breath when their lips meet, so light he almost misses it, but melts into the contact. When Cas pulls away he looks up at him with wide eyes. “Why did you do that?”
The soft knock on the door still made him jump slightly before Eileen poked her head into the room, smiling when he motioned her closer. “Do you need something?” she asked curiously, taking a seat at the end of the bed.
Cas chuckled. “We talked,” he replied, smiling at Dean. “We’re good.”
“Cas?” I murmur, sighing as he strokes slowly along my side. “Whatcha doing?”
“Yeah,” Dean murmured, cautiously wrapping an arm around him and remembering to breathe when Cas relaxed under it. “Yeah, this is...this is good.”
“More?”
A brief smile flashes across his face. “Um…yeah, I know.”
Cas swallows. “Hello…Father.”
I smile, kissing his cheek. “It’s just…you smell like him. It’s wrong. It’s an angel thing,” I add in response to his puzzled look.
“Why?”
“Please…” Cas breathes, a slight whine coloring the words. Dean smiles, beginning to map his body with his fingers and lips, waiting until he feels Cas relax under his touch before gently prodding at his entrance. He hears the quiet gasp, grinning as he gently works one finger into him. "Don’t worry baby,” he murmurs in response to Cas’ whimper. “I’m not going to open you up too much. Not yet, anyway. Ready to get started?” Cas nods eagerly, jolting in his bonds when he feels the sudden cold against his skin. It circles around his nipples before trailing down to drip along his thighs. “Guesses?”
He cut himself off then, shaking his head as he forced that particular thought back. Too close, he’d come too close to letting it out and ruining everything. It was fine, he’d always known Dean didn’t share his affection, there was no reason to ruin this...whatever it was they had with his stupid feelings. He should tell Dean that he forgave him, go back to pretending...
I wake up before Cas, sighing and snuggling closer to him, marveling at the lack of the usual tension I wake up with. After a couple of minutes a little bit of anxiety creeps back in, and I remember that one of those winged bastards is in the basement.
“I told Dean that you were in trouble, and he agreed to come see if he could help,” Cas interrupts.
Also please be patient with me as I try to get back into the swing of things, and let me know if you like it!
I shrug. “It makes you feel better, and it’s not forever. But we know you’ve been kinda freaked out lately. So if this helps for now, then why not?”
Slowly, he nods. “I think so. That did just happen, right?”
“I’m not askin’,” the man answered gruffly. “Dean, I bought that hunk o’ junk for parts. But you turned her into somethin’ beautiful. She’s yours.”
Whaaat, another chapter? Look at me doing regular updates. Enjoy!
Sam stares at him for a minute. “You…have wings,” he says finally.
He nods slowly. “It did. And it was scary. But Charlie helped me understand that my life was much more important than living up to my family’s impossible expectations. I have no doubt that if I hadn’t started seeing her, it would have killed me. I was depressed and anxious and angry, and I know I would have made some bad choices if things had gone on much longer. I’d thought about it before. The second I hung up that phone, I felt so relieved and happy. I was finally free from all the pressure, and I didn’t have to be ashamed of who I was anymore. I never looked back. No amount of money or prestige is worth that kind of pain. She helped me realize that a true family wouldn’t force me to be someone I’m not. Love shouldn’t be conditional.”
“And you?” he asks cautiously.
Dean nods. “You could just heal me now, instead of spending all that time.”
Poor Cas :( Good thing he has the boys to take care of him! I have a bunch more chapters already written, but reformatting them to the site is annoying and I have classes tomorrow. So I'm off to sleep now and will be back at it tomorrow.
“Not at all,” she answers, grinning as she nudges his shoulder. “You want your usual?” He nods, and she turns to me. “What about you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh yeah?” Dean grins. “Go ahead, guess.”
“Cas…fuck! Need your cock…
I feel his lips press against my temple. “It doesn’t have to be only you anymore. I’m here, forever.”
I hesitate, a complicated tangle of emotions stirring in my chest. “You know, there was a time when I would have killed to hear you say that...that you’re sorry, and you want to be better...but now, I...I don’t know. I have to think about it.”
Gabe hums, pulling Sam into another kiss. "Yeah, that would be good..."
Dean is just cleaning up from dinner when he finds himself suddenly pinned against the wall. He chuckles, looking at the blue eyes that are rapidly darkening. “Does me cleaning get you all hot and bothered, Cas?” He teases. Cas smirks, kissing him hard to shut him up, not that he’s complaining. It’s a side of him Dean’s never seen before, and it’s hot as fuck. “Want you, Dean,” he mutters before going back to biting at his neck.
“Sure. Looks like we have time now. Have something in mind?”
Dean comes home to the smell of food cooking, and he grins as he slips off his shoes by the door. “Have I told you how much I love having you here?” he calls out. There’s no answer, and he frowns as he wanders into the kitchen to find it empty, except for the tray of something in the oven. “Cas?” he calls louder, waiting for a response. When none comes, he wanders quietly down the hall, listening for any sounds. Finally, he comes to the door of the playroom, which has been left ajar. When he looks inside, he finds Cas sitting on a bench, surveying the racks on the far wall. Cas doesn’t seem to notice him, so he clears his throat softly, and the other man jumps, turning around. “Sorry,” he murmurs. “Didn’t mean to startle you. Just wondering where you Houdini-ed off to.” He walks in, settling down on the bench beside him. “What are you up to?”
I wait up until I hear soft snores coming from his room, but in the morning I wake up to find him curled at the end of my bed anyway. “Close enough,” I mutter to myself.
“I think they’re still in the library. Dad was behaving himself for once.”
“That’s right,” Cas assured him. “With all the cool new stuff Jody got for us, no one who means us any harm could get anywhere near the house. We’re safe.”
“Static, mostly,” I mutter. “The connection was bad. And he sounded almost…scared. More than I’ve ever heard. He said something was happening and that ‘they’ were coming.”
Dean smiled softly, bracing his hands on Cas’ shoulders. “Do me a favor and hold it steady for me?” Cas nodded, reaching down and holding himself in place, watching as Dean readjusted his position before taking a breath and pressing back against him.
TheSongSmith
She stands up, stretching slightly, and Dean nods. “Sounds good to me. I’d come help you, but…”
“That would imply the addition of an…intimate partner,” he manages after a moment.
I shout in protest, clapping my hands over my ears. “Cas! No. You gotta warn me before you do that, man. Never use that word ever again.”
“I don’t think you give him enough credit,” he answers. “Sam can understand a lot of things. I’m not saying you should invite him to watch or anything. Though I wouldn’t be opposed to taking his place.” I roll my eyes at him, and he chuckles. “Really though. You don’t have to put it on the news. But at least stop panicking about being outed. He’s still going to love you. You’re not doing anything wrong. You’re not hurting anyone. And there’s so many people out there doing the exact same thing and enjoying it. We can’t all be insane, right?”
Dean grins against the back of his neck, nuzzling into his hair. “Nope. Just me not being able to resist you like this.”
“Okay,” I murmur, sitting down next to him and carefully shifting closer. “What can I do?”
“It wasn’t going very well until we tried this whole rope thing yesterday,” I admit.
We work slowly through the stack of books while Dean and Gabriel play, running back and forth across the living room. I don’t know what the game is, but it ends with a loud bang as they crash into each other, followed by loud crying. Sam shoots me an exasperated look as we get up to gather them from the floor. They’ve each managed to give themselves skinned knees, and while we examine them on the bathroom counter Dean blubbers something I can’t understand. I look to Sam for help, and he chuckles. “He wants you to kiss it better.”
“You’re gonna catch a cold out here, with no jacket on,” Dean admonished lightly, gently wrapping an arm around the angel. “Come on, let’s get you inside. There’s someone I want you to meet.” Cas raised an eyebrow, but Dean just smiled, leading him back into the bunker. “We thought it’d probably be best to keep her in another room at first, in case something went wrong, but Sam let her out earlier,” he explained before turning toward the hall and whistling. Cas frowned, hearing the soft click of paws coming closer before a large, furry mass appeared in the hall. Upon seeing them, the creature barked, breaking into a sprint. Dean grinned and crouched down, catching the dog mid-stride and petting it happily. Cas took a few steps back as the animal approached, looking alarmed. “It’s okay,” Dean assured him. “She just gets a little excited about new people. This is Miracle.”
“Cas, this is Benny. Benny, Cas.”
I laugh, hugging him tighter. “You bet your life we can!”
Suddenly in front of me is a room full of people. Slowly, I start to recognize them, Sam and Bobby and Lisa and Ben; everyone I’ve ever cared about. “Sammy, you gotta help me.” He smiles, but when I take a step towards him he disappears in a cloud of smoke. I try to swallow down my panic, but it breaks free when the others start disappearing too, leaving faster and faster the more I reach for them, trying to drown out Mom’s laughter. I turn and see Cas, taking a breath. “See, you’re wrong. Cas wouldn’t leave me. He loves me.”
Gabriel is cooperative enough, but he keeps glancing between Meg and Cas. “How do you know her?” he asks finally. “Is it one of your kinky things?”
I shake my head, swallowing. “No Sir. I trust you.”
“While they’re there? I think that’d be okay, as long as you tell me it’s you.”
“Good,” Dean says, relieved. “Step one down. Now, onto step two. Benny said this might sting a bit. I don’t want to hurt you, so please stop me if it’s bad.”
“Yeah, sure,” Sam answers, glancing at me briefly. I give him a reassuring smile, and he nods. “Just yell if you need me, alright?”
Dean chuckles. “Good. See if you can quiet your mind. Just relax and let me take care of you for a while.” Cas nods, closing his eyes and focusing on the gentle pressure until it’s the only solid thing left. His breaths deepen as it moves lower, kneading the muscles of his lower back until they release. “Good boy. What’s your safe word, Castiel?” Dean asks quietly.
Dean manages to take a breath, going through the fuzzy memories in his head, most of them blurred by alcohol. “Not a lot,” he admits finally. “Just…pieces. Cas…what are you doing here?”
I hadn’t considered that angels had mates either. While I wonder at all the things I never thought about, I watch as his feathers twitch and move. When I glance back to him he’s watching me nervously. I stroke his cheek lightly, leaning in to kiss him softly. “Hey, it’s alright. We’ll figure this out, okay?”
Cas frowned, shaking his head. “I haven’t changed my mind,” he said slowly. “Have you?”
“Fuck yes,” I chuckle. “God, that feels good. Where’d you learn to do that?”
Cas chuckles softly. “It’s unfamiliar to you, yes, I’m aware. And I know that you’ll fight me about it for a long time. But I think we can teach you. Just answer one question, alright? Last night you let go. You gave up your incredibly tight control and let me take care of you. Did you enjoy it?”
He chuckles softly. “I don’t know about that. I broke something, but you do tend to be fairly resilient.”
He feels Dean pull down his waistband a little, a slick finger sliding between his cheeks before he starts to insert the toy. Cas knows exactly which one it is, a tiny but powerful thing, and Dean has a way of placing it just right so that it drives him crazy. It hums to life suddenly, and Cas gasps, then groans, his head falling forward to someone’s shoulder. “Green,” he chokes out before Dean can ask, a shaky moan escaping him as he hears the familiar laugh behind him. There’s a kiss at his temple as a hand runs soothingly through his hair, and he knows it can’t be Dean, but it’s still so nice, and he leans into the contact anyway. The vibrator speeds up just as the hand over his cock gives another squeeze, stroking him through the fabric, and he moans loudly.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, I noticed that.”
When I get back to the room, Cas smiles. “There you are, I was getting worried.”
“Yes Sir,” he whispers.
I am very sorry for the wait on this one, life got crazy with graduation and work and everything. I meant to post this chapter last weekend, but with everything happening I felt kind of weird about it. But I think we can all use a distraction, and mine is writing, so I hope you like this one. I'm not completely happy with it, so be gentle, but I think (hope?) most of you will like it.
“Better than I anticipated,” he answers. “It seems this new view of humanity has given them a new sense of purpose; something they haven’t had in a long time. It’s still slow, but they’re trying.”
He smiles, leaning up to kiss me softly. “Can we see other stuff?” he asks excitedly.
“Not everything,” he answers quietly. “But I have a lot of pieces. Do you think that’s bad? Do you think he did something to me?” he asks worriedly.
When he looked over, he saw Ben sitting in Hope’s stall, laughing as the young horse put her head in his lap for him to pet. Cas wandered over after checking the other stalls, wrapping an arm around Dean’s waist. “You okay?” he asked, noticing Dean’s expression.
Dean nodded, biting his lip. “How long have you known? That you loved me?”
“And that means what, exactly?”
Dean insists on walking him back to his apartment at which point he holds out the box. “Hold onto it. But don’t put it on yet. I want that honor for myself.” The idea of putting it on himself hadn’t really occurred to him, but he nods anyway, leaning in to kiss him softly. “Night Cas,” he grins.
Cas smiles gratefully. “I know.”
“Well, when he went to medical school instead of business school, they weren’t thrilled. But they accepted it because they figured he’d make money anyway. But then he told them he’s gay, and that went over about as badly as those things go over.”
Cas takes it curiously, pressing down on the button and jumping when a loud tone reverberates around the room. “What’s that for?”
“So basically, your brother is being a douche,” Dean clarifies. “Well, that sucks.”
“What?” I ask.
Bobby chuckled. “I’m sure. Though I can’t say we haven’t liked having you three around lately. An’ you know Ellen loves to dote on your boy.”
“How are ya brother? I see you haven’t had a heart attack yet,” Benny teases.
“With Kevin?” Dean asks. He nods, surprised when Dean laughs. “Sorry, it’s just…you were fine. I was talking to Ezekiel about it earlier. He says he hasn’t ever seen Kevin warm up to someone like that. He was really pleased.”
Dean looks up at him, his face flushed. “Maybe. But what if it happens again?”
Despite himself, Cas laughs. “Morning. I do my best. What time is it?”
“I should make you jealous more often,” he chuckles.
Finally, he cracks a smile, kissing me softly. “I think I can manage that. Bowie?” I nod, and he pulls me closer, kissing me hard before turning and walking away. I stand there for a minute, shocked. “Are you coming or not?”
“Sam said this is ‘lube’. That’s what the bottles say. But I don’t think I fully understand what it’s for. It’s very slippery.”
He holds the phone out towards him so she can hear the wheezing and gasping for herself. “That’s a negative.”
“Good enough. Are you sure you’re alright?”
When Sam found him in the library it was nearing six in the morning, and Dean’s coffee had long since gone cold, but he hadn’t stopped searching for answers in the large stack of books on the table beside him. “Dean?” he said cautiously. “Have you been up all night?”
Love,
He nods, grinning and kissing his forehead. “Alright then you’d better get some rest.”
In the morning, I open my eyes to find Cas staring up at me, smiling softly. “Whatcha doing?” I mumble, rubbing my eyes and snuggling closer.
“Different things,” he answers. “Sometimes I dreamt that Karael took you instead, or that you got hurt on a hunt and I couldn’t save you. So I understand.” He smiles a little. “You don’t have to do the tough act in front of me.”
“I’ll let you know,” Dean finishes. “Now relax, okay?” He leans over, kissing him softly. “Come on, we should go back before they wonder where we are.”
“We thought we’d make you a birthday breakfast,” Eileen answered, grinning. “Sam even caved and bought real bacon.”
He hesitated, glancing at Cas, who gave him a reassuring smile. “Take your time. I’m here.” After a minute he reached out with shaky fingers to pick it up, holding it carefully as if it might explode. “Not so bad, is it?” Cas asked softly.
He manages a breathless yes when I wrap my hand around him, stroking him quickly. His hips buck up into my hand until I use my free hand to hold them still, changing to long, slow strokes that have him whimpering and squirming in my grip. “That’s just cruel,” he whines, panting harshly.

“Well, you don’t have sex with her,” he points out.
I shrug. “Because you need to relax. Can you wash yourself, or do you want help?” He takes the washcloth from me and attempts to lift his arm above his head, but winces and drops it down again. Defeated, he hands the towel back. “Hey, it’s okay. I don’t mind. It’s probably better to take it easy today anyway.” He nods reluctantly as I begin to clean him up, carefully avoiding the bandages on his chest and wings. He shivers as I lightly run the cloth between his wings. “How’s it feel to be clean again?” I ask, rinsing him off.
I share a look with Dean, surprised at this. I assumed the thing causing him the worst pain would be first on the list, though Cas has always been reluctant to even discuss his wings, much less show them. Still, it’s the least we can do to let him choose. “Alright then,” I say calmly. “We’re going to have to take your shirt off to get to your injuries. Is…that alright?”
“Well it’s…this part is the most sensitive and vulnerable part of an angel’s wings,” I explain, lightly running my fingers over the soft inner feathers, feeling him tremble. “Usually angels keep it hidden, to protect it. To expose it to someone else is a sign of extreme trust. Similar to how certain pack animals will expose their throats to their leaders. It’s also an act of…submission.” He swallows so loudly I can hear it. “It’s not what you think,” I say quickly. “For angels, it’s just…”
Dean sighs, relieved, and kisses his temple softly, letting one hand move though Cas’ hair soothingly as the other begins quickly searching through his phone for the right number. The disgruntled voice on the other end is barely intelligible. “Benny? Hey, I’m sorry to wake you, but it’s an emergency. Cas is hurt bad. I need you to get here, like yesterday.”
“Actually, I might have an idea,” Cas murmurs after a moment. “I think I know someplace you’d like.”
“Well he did kill me an awful lot of times,” I point out. “But…I might have knocked this happiness thing a little early. I haven’t felt this good since I was five. If he makes you happy like Cas makes me happy, then I think you should go for it.”
“For what?” he asks, his fingers tracing lightly along my spine.
“Nothing. Nothing at all.”
“Cas, relax,” I chuckle, kissing his cheek. “I think it’s a good idea. Maybe you’re right. Maybe this way I’ll be able to see myself the way you see me. It might help.”
Dean glances down at me again, as if to say
He shudders hard, feverishly mumbling my name as his orgasm washes over him, his chest heaving. After a moment I lightly run a fingertip along his shaft, chuckling softly as he jolts, whimpering. I press soft kisses along his neck, running my fingers lightly over his flushed skin until he slowly turns to look at me over his shoulder, his eyes wide. “Jesus Cas, what the fuck…?” he breathes.
I smile, walking closer to kiss him softly, settling my hands on his waist. He shudders when my fingers stroke over the rough paint lines along his ribs. “Because…it’s the closest I can get to giving you your wings back,” I answer softly, feeling his breaths lose their rhythm. “I love you, Cas. More than anything. And you…you’re incredible and beautiful and sweet and good, and I don’t think I’ve deserved you a day in my life, but goddamn do you make me want to try. Human or not, that’s always been true. It doesn’t make a difference to me. And you spend so much time trying to get me to believe that I’m important, I just…I wanted to show you the same thing.” I watch in shock as Cas’ eyes fill with tears, and he hugs me tightly, a soft sob escaping him, muffled in my chest. I wrap my arms around him, careful to avoid the design. “Baby, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you…”
Dean looks up, surprised. God smiles softly. “Just remember, ‘good’ is not a word written in black and white. I created shades of gray for a reason. Your breakfast is done, by the way.” I turn to look at the forgotten food, and when I turn back he’s gone.
Gabe laughs, kissing Sam's cheek lightly. "You don't have to worry about that...I know how lucky I am."
“No,” I manage. “It’s…not that bad.” What I mean is it’s not really the bondage I’m scared of.
“It’s okay. Come on, let’s get you clean and warmed up,” I murmur. He follows me silently into the bathroom, shucking off the wet coat and allowing me to remove his tie, shirt, and mud stained pants. “You gonna tell me what’s going on?” I ask, starting to gently clean the blood from his face. “There a power outage or something?”
He stirs, blinking up at me slowly before smiling. “Are you finished?” he murmurs, voice rough with sleep. I nod, and he grins. “Can I see it now?”
Dean sighed. “Because, I...this is something I need to say to your face. Please don’t make me spill my guts to the hallway dude, it’s embarrassing.”
He nods, but makes no move to remove it himself. Dean looks over at me questioningly, and I nod to him. He reaches over and carefully pulls the bloody trench coat away, removing his tie and unbuttoning his shirt. Cas seems not to notice until he gently slides the garment from the angel’s shoulders, at which point he cringes. “Well isn’t that strange,” Dean muses to himself. “Bloodstains on the back of your shirt, but no blood on your back.”
“Again?” he asks.
“I know you will,” Dean murmurs. “Tomorrow?”
He hums in response, curling up against my side when I sit him down on the couch. “Cas, hungry,” he says.
Dean’s mouth pulls away with an obscene pop, and Cas almost sobs. “Not yet,” he murmurs, his voice cracking. “Just another minute…fuck Cas, you’re incredible…”
Was he complaining?
He could almost feel Charlie’s raised eyebrow through the phone as she typed. “Sure thing...ten years ago it was still pretty slow, only one spike that year. That definitely limits the number of files to go through. That’s an oddly specific request, though. What’d he say?”
The angel nods. “No problem. We’ll meet you in the library whenever you’re ready.”
My face grows hotter, and it takes a minute to find my voice as his fingers press insistently deeper. “I-I deserve to have you play with my ass…open it up for you, Sir…” I whisper, growing impossibly harder.
She hesitated. “No one around here knows about him. It’s…kind of a long story, but…I guess we have some time. Here’s the thing. Cas’ family…I’m sure he doesn’t tell you about them either. You’re not missing out; they’re pretty awful as far as people go.  They run some kind of financial firm or something. They’re very rich and very powerful, and they weren’t very pleased when Cas turned out different.”
“I’m proud of you,” Dean adds. “I love you.”
“The last thing I need or want is your help, you asshole,” I growl. “I’m not in the mood. I’m going to give you five seconds to flap your feathery ass out of here, and then if you’re still standing there I’m going to stab you in the fucking face.”
I laugh. “Guess I can’t really argue with that. But don’t you have to get back to angel boot camp?”
“Well, this sucks,” Gabriel mutters. “They were doing so well, too...”
Cas chuckles, hugging her back. “I missed you too. Charlie, this is…”
“You were?” he asks, resting his head under my chin.
“I think so too,” I reply. “You know, even if you dream about that bad man, your angel won’t ever let him hurt you.”
Cas frowns. “No, of course not. I would never violate you that way. I do not see anything you wish to keep hidden. It’s more of a sense. I can feel you like you felt me this morning. I can sense the thoughts you choose to share with me, as well as your emotions. I can feel where you are if I need to. I’d imagine, with the human component, we could also trade sensory information.”
He thinks for a moment. “Yes. Not often, but it has happened before.”
Showing what I can only consider agitation at his mood, Cas’ wings flap and spread wide, the feathers flaring out. Extending several feet to either side, the wings are quite a sight, and even though I know this is not how they’re supposed to be seen, I can’t help but be a little awed. Slowly, I reach out, burying my fingers in the soft feathers. Cas gasps sharply, and I pull back. “Sorry. Did I hurt you?”
he wrote,
Dean chuckles. “Well Cas, that’s everyone. Everyone, this is Cas. My boyfriend.”
“I understand why you do not wish to discuss such things around Sam. But I did have a few more questions that I thought perhaps you could answer.”
I consider it. “It would be nice, I guess, to not have to worry about things; to let someone else take control. But I can’t. Sammy needs me to be in control. And so do a lot of other people. What we do…we protect a lot of people. If I’m not in control, people could get hurt. Why do you ask?”
“Slowly?” the human repeats, surprised.
“Sit up, Dean.” He nearly trips over himself to obey, and I can’t help but laugh. I slide into place behind him, smirking at the little squeak of surprise he makes when I pull him back into my lap. I hook my legs over his thighs, keeping his legs spread, and he relaxes against me immediately, his head tipping back against my shoulder. “Good boy,” I purr into his ear, feeling him shiver. He jumps when my hand wraps around his cock again, moaning as I start the same slow pace as before. “Now, I don’t think you finished the story…”
He shivers, eyes opening groggily as he searches out his brother. “Sam…Whiskey?” he murmurs.
“Why not?”
He smiles a little. “I know.”
Cas thinks for a minute, hazy memories starting to surface. He nods slightly, stifling a groan as his stiff muscles protest. “A little bit. How bad is it?”
It doesn’t take much convincing before I agree, curling up against him. “Okay. I can do that.” He nods, carefully leaning back against the pillows, keeping me against his chest. The steady heartbeat under my cheek and the gentle hand running through my hair have me relaxing before I know what’s going on, and his free hand moves slowly up and down along my spine. “Stop it,” I protest weakly. “You’re making me sleepy again.”
Cas stretches out, nodding, and Dean slips out, gathering what he needs and returning with a tray of things Cas is too tired to look at. He sets it down before sitting down beside him, gently taking his wrist and starting to unbuckle the cuff still around it. Cas closes his eyes, pliant in Dean’s grip. “Why’d you leave them on?” he asks curiously.
Cas nods, staying still as he carefully spreads the cream over his back. He shivers a little at the cold, but sighs in relief as it takes effect. “Thanks. That’s a lot better.”
Sam shrugged. “He’s an angel in a human body, Dean. That sounds like it might be a strange experience. He lives on Earth now, and I think he desperately wants to understand how he fits in here. If exploring things like that make him feel more like he has a place to belong among humans, then I’m going to support him, even if you won’t. From what I’ve gathered from his questions, he’s looking more at the gender side of things right now. I think it would be good for him to meet people who might understand what it’s like to feel like the body other people see isn’t really who you are. But no matter where he decides he falls, I’m still going to support him. We’re family, and that’s what family does. Plus, I think it’ll be a good time. It’s...a celebration of every form of love. I don’t see anything wrong with being a part of that.”
I nearly spit out my drink at that. Bad time to take a sip of water. “Videos? Cas, did you watch
Cas nods, sighing. “I can’t wait until you can hold me properly again,” he mumbles.
“I know you would have,” Cas smiles. “I think that’s why I didn’t ask. And after that…well, I think you know how I felt after that.” He pauses. “Can we really do this? I mean, what we did, and normal going out things?”
Cas nodded, smiling. “I believe so. You humans are often uncomfortable discussing sexual acts, especially those which are deemed ‘taboo’ in some way. And I discovered that many of those acts make use of this ‘lube’.”
In his happy haze, Cas forgets to set his alarm, and wakes up the next morning to find himself running late. He rushes around the apartment before heading to his office, realizing along the way that he’s forgotten his lecture notes, but not having enough time to go back for them. To make matters worse, several students in his classes were disruptive as he bumbled through his lectures with what he could remember, and he’d gotten no less than three emails about the deadline for his upcoming paper. After his final class lets out he sits at his desk for a moment, trying to remember what it’s like to breathe normally. Finally, he sends a text to Dean with just one word:
Cas nods politely, shaking the other man’s hand. “So this is the guy you’re always telling me about. It’s nice to finally put a face to the name, especially since you talk about him so much. Nice to meet you Cas.”
He smiles, leaning in to kiss me. “That’s perfectly alright. It needed to come out. And I hope you know that your feelings are perfectly valid. It’s completely okay to be angry and scared and upset. Those are normal, acceptable responses, and there’s nothing wrong with feeling that.”
Cas chuckles. “Dean, it’s okay. She’s a smart girl. She can handle this. And you said yourself that Ben seems like a nice boy. You do have the same favorite band.”
He shrugs. “He dabbles. In the past few years I’ve only seen him with women, but perhaps he figured bringing a man would infuriate our brothers more.”
“Yeah. Well, he wasn’t exactly the most comforting person, and Dean was a lot smaller back when he started. Basically just held the kid down and did it. I don’t know what about today set him off, but I think that’s why he was so scared.” He pauses for a minute. “What about you? Does he usually…call you Sir?”
I nod, hugging him tightly. “It is. Thank you. I…don’t think you’ll have any more problems getting me to let go.”
“All thanks to your brilliant teaching methods, Sir,” I chuckle.
The feeling is overwhelmingly satisfying, and I grip his forearms tightly for a minute. "Much better," I breathe as my weight settles back into his lap. "Thank you."
Dean went first, and when Cas finished his shower he found him dressed and pacing anxiously in the bedroom. He smiled, offering his hand. “Hey, relax. You’ll like her, I’m sure of it. Come on, we’ll go together.” Dean accepted the hand, nodding gratefully.
Dean loved him. The angel was almost giddy with the knowledge. He’d never thought he’d be able to say that, to have his feelings reciprocated. But now he knew beyond a doubt that the human truly, deeply loved him. Cas’ ability to experience emotions had long been a burden, but it didn’t feel that way anymore. He supposed his fatal flaw couldn’t really be that horrible, if it also allowed him to feel such astronomical joy in the arms of his stupid, beautiful human.
“Hey Cas,” I mumble back.
Dean hesitated, considering it for a moment. As much as he wanted to tell Cas everything, if only to stop holding it all in, the voice in his head insisted that it would be a mistake, that once Cas knew the truth about him, everything would change, and he’d lose the only place he felt safe for the last decade.
“Hi,” Dean chuckles. “How are you feeling?”
“And that isn’t counting the five orgasms I had yesterday…” Cas interjects.
“I’m not.”
There were many things that Castiel disliked about being human. The constant demands of his body, for example, were maddening sometimes. If he wasn’t hungry, then he had to use the restroom (which was a whole affair on its own, that he also disliked), or sleep, or fulfill any of a hundred other needs he suddenly had. There was also an ache somewhere in him at all times, which was distracting and made him feel like his vessel- his
“An uncharted island in the tropics,” I answer. He stares at me for a moment, and I flush. “I wanted us to have a place for ourselves.”
“I told you, I want to show you something important,” I answer. “Besides, you’re way more entertaining to paint than a canvas.”
There's still more to come, but I'm calling it a night. I'll try to transfer the rest of the chapters up tomorrow. Please remember to review if you enjoy reading! It makes me happy!
Sam coughs weakly, groaning. “Hurts…”
Dean nodded, biting his lip for a moment.
, Dean thought to himself, working on the last few lines as a swirling, inky cloud materialized a few feet in front of him. “Yeah, well...he’s not yours anymore,” he muttered. “He’s mine. He always has been.”
He smiles, his fingers combing lightly through my hair. “I’m glad. You know, I probably could have just taken a shower…”
“That’s ’cause it’s not,” he grins. His eyes flutter closed for a minute, and he takes a deep breath. “I still can’t believe you did that,” he chuckles. “Personally, I think you just like breaking me.”
“Maybe he thought he’d be putting us in danger?” I shrug. “You know how he is about that stuff. Either way, we have to find him. He needs our help.”
Gabriel casts Dean another disapproving look, but pulls Sam into the kitchen. Cas sighs tiredly. “You think it’s about time we came clean?” Dean murmurs.
“I don’t know how to cook,” he points out.
“Of course, Dean,” I assure him. “It can be our secret. As long as you promise me something.”
Dean glances over his shoulder, smiling. “Making sure this thing works,” he answers. He finishes what he’s doing and closes it up, holding out a small circular device. “Go ahead, give it a shot.”
“I want to take Gabriel with us next time. I don’t like seeing you hurt.”
Cas goes redder, shoving him lightly. “Shut up…it’s just weird to talk about it so casually. I’m still not quite used to that.”
“Please, Castiel,” Dean manages, too overwhelmed to care about begging. “N-Need to come...”
Cas shrugs sheepishly. “I don’t know what it is. I just can’t help but like him.”

Sam recovers first, grabbing the blade next to the door and bracing it in front of him. “No. Dad’s dead.”
“Oh,” Dean says, surprised. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize. I’m not sure where that came from. I guess you just looked so adorable and helpless. Probably my protective streak.”
Dean nodded, walking up the stairs and out the front door. He looked around for a moment, spotting Cas’ silhouette in the fading light, resting under a tree a little ways up the hill. The angel didn’t move as he approached, staring up at the quickly-darkening sky. Dean sat down beside him, quiet as he followed Cas’ gaze up to the emerging stars. “It’s funny,” Cas murmured after a while. “In the end, they were sort of right.”
I look over to Cas and smile. "Yeah. I'm okay with that."
Sam snorts, shaking his head. “Gabe? He’s still sleeping. He was a little...uh, worn out I guess.”
Charlie waved them off, handing them the pizza boxes and wrapping an arm around Ben, following them in the house. “Nonsense, I won’t hear of it. We’re family, that’s what I’m here for. It did royally suck without you though. Benny came over to check on the horses while you were gone, and Baby got annoyed you weren’t there and tried to bite him.”
I think about this. “Interesting theory. I never really considered it. You don’t find it…weak to give in to your desires?”
“If I had to take a wild guess, maybe it’s because any time anyone mentions anything about the LGBT+ community around you, you get all pissy and accuse them of trying to force you into something?”
“Cas?” He whimpers, startled, and scrambles back a few feet, looking up with wide, terrified eyes. The sound breaks my heart. “Woah, hey, okay,” I murmur, stopping a few feet away and holding my hands up. “I’m not coming any closer. I just need you to listen, okay? Just…don’t run.” He swallows, panting, and watches me cautiously, every muscle strung tight in case he has to bolt. He looks so much like the day we found him that it hurts. “I understand why you’re scared of me,” I say softly. “I found your drawing. They convinced you that I was the one doing those terrible things to you, didn’t they? Drugged you or used their angel mojo or something so you’d see me hurting you. And you knew somewhere that it wasn’t true, but they made you see it over and over again, and you weren’t so sure anymore. I’m guessing you had a nightmare about what you saw, and when you woke up next to me you thought you were still there and that I was going to hurt you. I know it’s hard to make sense of those thoughts sometimes.” He swallows so loudly I can hear it even with the distance, and there’s no give in his defensive posture. It hurts; a kind of desperate pain that throbs under my ribs, because he’s still trapped somewhere between his nightmares and reality, and I don’t know how to bring him back. My own breaths start to mimic his frantic ones, and I start to ramble, my words growing faster and more panicky the longer I go, because I have to do something, anything to make him understand. “Cas, you know the real me would never do those things to you. The real Dean would rather die than hurt you. I’m the one that got you out of that place, that gave you a bath and held you when you had nightmares and told you about the Legos to help you hold on to reality. Sam would make fun of me if he ever found out, but sometimes when you fall asleep I sing to you. You like to wear my old t-shirts, because you say they’re like home. I watch that old Batman movie with you all the time even though it’s a shitty movie because it makes you laugh and I like it when you do that. Just thinking about what those monsters did to you makes me sick, and when you showed me that drawing for the first time I was so upset I almost puked. I could never, ever hurt you like that…I just…I love you, Cas. Goddammit, I love you, and I’m terrified to admit that because I don’t deserve to love you and I’m a horrible person and I’m terrible at this, but I need you to believe me. Please.”
“Everything else. Please,” the angel requests.
I sigh, sitting up to make him look at me. “How many times do I have to tell you to stop apologizing? You were scared and confused. I understand. It’s okay.” He smiles a little, nodding, and I glance down to the light scars striping his thighs. “Hey Cas?” I murmur, lightly stroking over the raised flesh and feeling him shiver. “Did…I do this?”
“In a way. The link will not disappear, but you can block it on your end, as I can, and we can make it…dormant, if you will. It can fade into the background.” He pauses. “Dean, we don’t have to use it if it makes you uncomfortable,” he says softly.
“Angel, Sir,” he answers, shuddering as Dean’s fingers brush lightly over his prostate again. “Not using it now…”
Dean frowned. “Don’t what?”
He chuckles. “Perhaps you’re right. I am rather lucky to have you. I hope they will one day be so lucky.”
“Dean’s right, we’re just glad you’re home,” Sam added. “But if it makes you feel any better, Chuck has been dealt with already. You don’t have to worry about it anymore.”
Jody smiled. “It’s always hard when they fly the nest. But you taught him well. I’m sure he’s doing great. And you saved the world. That’s quite an accomplishment.”
I grin, firmly pressing my hands against the soft feathers, enjoying his low moan. I stroke my fingers through them gently for a few minutes while he sighs, building his soul’s trust. When I pull away, my wings pulling back, his head snaps up, alarmed, but I smile reassuringly, raising my wings high and stretching them out. He blushes as his wings curl down submissively, exposing every delicate feather. “It’s certainly nothing to be ashamed of, Dean,” I murmur, carding my fingers through them lightly until he relaxes. Cautiously, he reaches for the same spot on my wings, hesitating just before he makes contact to look at me questioningly. I smile, nodding encouragingly, sighing softly when he strokes them gently. “I trust you too.” I wrap my wings around him again, his feathers fluttering happily as they fold underneath, and I’m pleased to notice that his trembling has stopped.
“I’m sorry too,” the angel murmured, clinging to him tightly. “I should have been honest with you earlier. And I’m sorry for calling you a mud monkey. That was rather rude of me.”
Dean laughs, his head dropping to press kisses against my neck. “God I hope not. Something tells me it’s gonna be a long couple of days…”
Dean nods slowly. “Yeah. I mean, I guess.” Cas starts walking back to the car, and Dean looks at me. “Kind of weird having it over that fast, huh?”
"How do we know if it's over?" I ask.
“So I didn’t…do anything wrong, right?”
I watch curiously as his wings shift, dropping back and exposing the soft, vulnerable undersides to me. Dean startles as the sudden movement, looking back at them. He thinks for a moment, examining his own soul, his eyes widening. “Do you…know what you’re doing?” I ask cautiously.
Cas smiles, nodding. “Yeah, I’m fine. Good. Just…I’ve been wondering what this might feel like for months.”
“Dean, what about Sam?” I murmur as he closes his bedroom door behind us. “I don’t think he’d appreciate hearing our…activities.”
Every sensation, every emotion slowly faded, until one day he’d realized that he had trouble remembering the last time he really felt something, and he knew that should scare him, but it didn’t anymore. He’d stopped taking cases, and started spending his days locked in motel rooms, losing time while he listens to his list of failures on repeat in his head. In the beginning, he’d cringed at the words; screamed, trying to cover them up. Now he just listens.
Meg smiled, removing the object. “Fair enough. That was a lot of progress, Dean. Good job. We’ll work on it again next time.”
Cas leads him into the kitchen, where Dean is finishing putting their plates away. “Hey Benny!” he greets cheerfully.
A shy smile lit up the former angel’s face, and he shifted closer. “I’m proud of you, Dean. And you could never disappoint me. I’ve always known you had more inside you. I’m glad that you finally see that too.”
“Please…” he huffs out against the leather. “Need you.”
“Okay. So you’re fine, right? If I promised I wouldn’t hurt you, and you’re through the hardest part, and you’re not in pain, why are you scared?”
Cas covered his surprise well, clearing his throat before he answered. “It’s 2020.”
Sam laughs, and I manage to relax a little. “I’m not sure that’s a bad thing. They might be winning, you didn’t punch him like I thought you would.”
Charlie nodded sympathetically. “I’m sure that must be a relief. And please let me know if I do anything that makes you uncomfortable. You don’t have to worry about me being offended or anything. I get it.”
“Yeah, I know. Just come here for a moment.”
I remind myself.
“I think being around Sam has been good for him,” Cas hums, stroking my sides absently. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen him actually care about things openly. He’s not going to tell Sam, so you can relax about that. How are you feeling otherwise?”
Dean smiles, kissing the back of his neck softly. “I know you can. Is there anything you want to ask or talk about before we get started?”
“Good. It has the same effect on other sensitive areas.” He thumbs over one of my nipples, and I whimper. “But I think this is enough for now.”
Castiel frowned, perplexed by the pleading note in Dean’s voice, one he wasn’t sure he’d ever heard there. “Why do you need me to open the door to talk?” he asked after a long moment.
Dean chuckles when Cas kicks his stomach lightly with a foot. “Fine. If you want to hear me say it, I don’t want to…have intercourse or oral sex with strangers, alright?”
He nods. “Easier said than done,” he chuckles. He pauses outside Cas’ building, frowning. “You gonna be alright tonight? Want me to stay?”
I feel the sting of tears in my own throat, hugging him closer and kissing him again. “Dean…you have no idea how happy I am to hear you say that. I love you so much.”
“I changed my mind,” Cas answers, shrugging. “I might have been a little hasty. He’s a good guy.”
God nods. “You know, Castiel, when I created humanity, I did not initially ask the angels to protect them or watch over them. I only asked that they love them the way I love them. But I see now what I didn’t then. The angels had no concept of love, the way I did. They understood more concrete things: loyalty, duty, gratitude. They protected the earth, but not out of love. Out of responsibility. They did not see humanity as brothers, but as charges, as unwanted pets, things they
Dean nods, sniffing softly. “I love you, you big idiot,” he mumbles. “Don’t ever scare me like that again…”
Sam nods, accepting some ice chips wincing as he swallows. “W’s going on…?” he rasps.
Dean just hums in response, and Benny smooths his hair back. “Come on, let’s get him cleaned up and settled in bed. It’ll be a lot easier before he comes around more.”
Dean chuckles, carefully helping him out of the tub and holding out a towel for him. When he’s mostly dried off, he takes it again, gently patting his back dry. A knock at the door startles him, and he frowns. “Who’s that?”
“Any time,” he answers, stabbing his fork through his eggs before looking up again. “And by the way, you know that thing you have about what you deserve? Dean’s got that too. Has ever since I’ve known him, back when he was a scrappy little punk getting his ass handed to him. So I think he’d understand how you feel. But I know he’s crazy about you. And I’d never try to get in the way of that.”
I frown, lightly pressing my fingers against his neck. “Does your chest or arm hurt?”
John nods, humming thoughtfully. “Well, I’m sure a lot has changed since I’ve been gone. You’ll have to fill me in. Now, are you gonna be rude, or are you gonna introduce me to these two?” he asks, motioning to Gabriel and I.
“Well…” Cas looks between us for a moment. “Things like…loyalty. And family. Love.”
Gabriel huffs, blushing harder and shoving me lightly. “Oh shut it, like you’re one to talk, you are too. And what were you doing snooping around Sam’s room anyway?”
He nods back. “Promise. Goodnight Dean.”
He nods, smiling reassuringly. “Sure. Just give me a second, okay? I’ll be right back.”
He returned after a few minutes with Eileen, and they explained the situation. “So,” she said slowly, “the Empty is a being...but it’s also a place? How do you fight a place?”
Dean held his breath while Sam recited the words in latin, unable to even watch, in case it didn’t work. But his head snapped up at the fond, warm “Hello, boys,” nearly laughing in relief at the sight of the small, red-headed witch before them. “Long time no see.”
His smile only widens. “Oh, I’m sure. But he didn’t see me doing it. He saw you. Don’t you want to know?”
Dean huffed, shaking his head. “Apparently I’m the last one to know. But the thing is...I love him too.”
“Good,” Cas murmurs. “Really good.”
before they can say anything! That’s a dick move!”
“So,” Dean says, “let’s talk about this virgin business. I know it’s not because people don’t find you attractive. So what is it?”
He sputters for a minute, fumbling for words. “What? I mean, we’re not, uh…”
It took him a minute to choose a question that didn’t sound like prying.
Cas chuckles, shaking his head. “He was calmer than I remember someone else being...”
Hey there! So, I'm working really hard trying to wrap this one up, but you can expect probably two or three more chapters coming soon! Also, if you're not busy (and lets face it, most of us aren't), it would really mean a lot to me if you could leave me a little review down below! The state of the world has been kind of getting me down lately, and it's been really rough, so the support would really help!
“You weren’t,” I interrupt. “You were right on time, and you’re even getting better at having a cool line ready. I think my badassness is rubbing off on you.”
Cas grinned, leaning in again to kiss him softly. “That sounds perfect.” He took the ring out of the box, gently taking Dean’s hand and sliding it onto his finger. The metal seemed to almost buzz against his skin, and Dean looked down at it, noticing the swirling of the blue stripe. “That’s...?”
I chuckle softly, running a hand through his disheveled hair. “I gotcha. Deep breaths.”
Dean blushed, shrugging slightly. “He makes it pretty easy...and so do you. Really, sometimes I think about where I was before I met you...I was as good as dead, just waiting to not wake up one day...I never even dreamed of getting out of that place, much less having a home, and a family... all of this was...the biggest pipe dream of my entire life. Waking up in a bed next to someone who loves me, and feeling safe...helping someone else learn to feel safe again...I never thought I’d get to do this. And I wouldn’t have, if you hadn’t found me.”
I jolt up, startled to find wide blue eyes staring down at me. Cas looks alarmed, but I can’t be sure this isn’t another trick. He says something that I can’t quite make out over the sound of my frantic breaths, and he frowns when I don’t answer. He starts to reach out for me, but I flinch away, not wanting to see him disappear again, which only makes his expression look more worried. “Dean? You’re starting to scare me. Please say something. Can you hear me?”
He calls for Gabriel and Sam, who appear quickly, and while Sam still looks nervous, Gabriel flops down happily in a seat closer to the odd fifth chair. After a moment, Sam settles next to him, relaxing slightly when Dean and I take the seats across from him.
Cas nods. “Thank you. Both of you,” he murmurs, his eyelids drooping tiredly. “I...I’m really glad that you consider me a part of your family.”
“Green.”
“Funkytown?” Benny asks, chuckling. “It’s something we used a long time ago. When I first started working with him, we used a series of words, similar to safewords, to help Dean sort through his feelings before he was ready to really talk about them. ‘funkytown’ is a very specific one, sort of a sense of impending doom. He once described it to me as ‘standing on the edge of a cliff, not knowing when you’re going to be pushed over. It means he’s losing it, fast.”
I nod, resting back against his chest for a moment, sighing as his palm strokes up and down along my side. “Hey Cas?” I murmur after a minute.
I smile, watching him for a minute before flipping us over so that he lies beneath me. “I’m glad to hear you say that.”
He nods, chuckling a little. “Yeah, actually that was kind of fun. He’s livid, and he can’t do a thing about it. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it was going to be. Thanks.”
“Me too,” I answer, brushing his hair back. “Sam should be back soon with food. Gabriel and I have been watching something about talking penguins.”
“Hey!” Dean protests, trying to cover his grin. “Manly men like cuddling too. Especially when they’ve been through a night like ours. Come on, you goofball.” He gently pulls Cas to his feet, supporting most of his weight as they make it back to bed. Once there, Dean sets him down gently, climbing in beside him and pulling him close, careful not to touch anywhere near his bandages.
The sensations coursing through Cas start to change, and every time he thinks they can’t possibly get stronger, that he’s definitely about to explode, they ratchet up a little higher until he’s a quivering, needy mess under Dean’s gentle hands. “Dean…” he gasps, his voice coming out entirely more moan-like than he intended. “Fuck, so good…’s different…”
that had been pounding inside his skull since the Empty appeared. Maybe the kid had been right after all. Because when Dean looked inside himself, he knew the answer: he would find a way to get Cas back himself.
Cas drops his coat by the door, leaning heavily against the doorframe while he tries to breathe. He lashes out at the vase on the table, hearing it shatter to the floor, unsure if he’s angrier with Dean for brushing his feelings off or at himself for being angry in the first place. “I need a drink,” he murmurs to the jagged pieces of glass. “Or seven.” He checks his watch, frowning at how early it is, but he gets up and changes his clothes before grabbing his coat again, leaving the remains of the vase behind.
“Don’t love you.”
“Already done.”
“Yes,” I chuckle. “It’s much better now.”
“I’m not in your head,” the angel insists. “I assure you, I’m very much real.”
He smiles. “Well, you don’t have to do what I did. You can do anything you want.”
Her expression shifts to one of amusement as Cas starts to snore lightly, glancing down at him. “Are you sure about that?”
“If you start to feel off again or you need anything or want to talk, please call me,” he instructs as he slips on his jacket. “Whatever I’m doing, I’ll pick up. I promise.”
Dean snorts, pressing a hand to his chest. “Nah, that’s okay. I don’t think I’ll be able to go back to sleep for a while anyway. Why don’t we just relax for a bit, and then we’ll get you cleaned up?” Cas nods, shifting until he can lay pretty much on top of Dean, pressing his face into Dean’s neck. “Comfy?” Dean chuckles.
He paces the floor for a minute before looking up at me. “Dean…I’m sorry. I didn’t realize…if I’d known I never would have let you…”
With Cas busy on his new angel-training mission, Dean’s getting temperamental, so I tracked down a nest of vampires in an attempt to cheer him up. It seems to be working so far, and while we drive out to the nest I see that familiar glint in his eye. “Hey Dean?” I ask. “You’re…happy, right? With the whole Cas situation?”
Cas chuckles, nodding. “Yeah, I thought I might’ve. Sorry.”
“I did what I had to do,” he says quickly. “It was something I could do anywhere we were. It was only a few times, at first. Only when I needed a little extra food money or to get Sammy a birthday present. But then…he got older, and he was so smart, Cas. He always talked about going to college and helping people. And I wanted him to have that. You can’t pay for college with stolen credit cards. So I started doing it more regularly. I was a little less selective, and sometimes they got rough, and I started coming home with marks. Sammy would ask, but I’d just make excuses.” He gives a slight shrug. “It worked. I saved up all the money.”
“Ah, yes, I’m getting ahead of myself. Usually, an angel must have been created a Guardian. However, the usual rules never seem to have applied to you, Castiel,” God says, smiling wryly. “And when you popped out of the torture chamber after hearing Dean’s call, I realized I may be a tad late in awarding the title.”
I shake my head. “It doesn’t matter. I’m just…I’m sorry.”
Cas rolls his eyes playfully at Dean’s concern. “Always so worried about me.” He thinks for a moment, then grins. “I can do both. And even if I don’t owe you, that doesn’t mean I don’t want to properly express my appreciation. Here, turn over.”
He chuckles. “Maybe you should ask him what he’s been reading,” he says, and just as soon as he appears, he’s gone. I keep walking for a while, thinking over what he said. After a while, I wander away from the road, sitting down in the grass under a tree. A few minutes later, there’s a soft flutter, and I already know who it is without turning around. “Dean?” the low, gravelly voice murmurs softly.
Dean had asked once. Cas had laughed and shrugged at him, loose and sleepy.
There’s a soft knock on the door before Sam enters. “Morning. So I…” he starts, then trails off, looking at the angel on the bed. “It’s like having a new puppy,” he chuckles.
John scowls at the challenge, but seems to think better of pushing it. “Yeah, that’s...kind of a new thing,” he mutters, still watching Gabriel warily. “Since I’ve been back, I...I can see them. Kind of. Maybe not what they are, exactly but if I get a good enough look I cantell if something’s not quite right. Now, you gonna tell me what that thing is and why you have it here?”
Just then, the door to Cas’ office opened, and he herded his patient toward the door before coming back. “I miss anything?”
“Dean, have you ever…been on a plane?” Cas asks, trying to cover his amusement.
He doesn’t answer until he’s closed the door to the room behind them and pushed Dean down onto the bed, sitting down next to him. “Alright, really, what was that?”
I think about it for a minute before nodding. “You feel real…”
“Isn’t it scary when you give control to Cas?” he asks, smiling slightly. “It’s absolutely terrifying. We haven’t even really used them yet, because the initial cutoff is so intense. We’re working on it. But I think it’s worth it. And Sam is...I know he wouldn’t hurt me. I trust him, with my life. Before you go getting any ideas, he’s the only one they’ll work for, I made sure of that.”
“I’ll show you once you’re feeling better,” he answers, smiling. “Speaking of which, I have to get you more medicine. I’ll be right back.” He slips out, and I notice Sam’s laptop on the nightstand. Remembering what Cas said about research, I open it, quickly searching through the history from a the last few days. It starts off innocently enough, but soon the questions get more specific and less vanilla. A few of them are honestly surprising, and very hot, and I don’t notice Cas come back until he clears his throat. “What are you doing?”
I chuckle, pulling on pants and wrapping an arm around him. “It’s okay. Come on flyboy, let’s see what’s going on.”
It asks him.
Eileen shifted closer, hugging him gently. “You don’t have to say anything. Welcome home.”
Dean chuckles. “Baby, by the time I’m done with you, you won’t even remember your name.”
Sometime in the early morning I hear a thump from down the hall. I listen for a moment, but it’s quiet. Abandoning my book and cold coffee, I creep down the hall to check. Outside the bedroom door I pause, hearing harsh breaths from inside. When I open the door I don’t see anything but the crumpled sheets, the bed empty, but creeping around to the other side I find Cas on all fours, gasping for breath. He flinches as I kneel down beside him, looking up at me with wide eyes. “Cas? What’s happening? What’s wrong? Are you hurt?”
"He told me what usually happens with angels," I murmur. "That sometimes you can feel...emotions, or thoughts or something from the other one and all that. He said it's impossible to know if that can happen with us since it's never happened with two humans."
“That’s a long story.”
If possible, Sam looks even more surprised. “Really?”
Cas smiles, leaning up to kiss his cheek. “They obviously love you very much. I’m glad someone stood up for you.”
“I don’t mind much,” Dean answers, hugging him closer. “We’ve all been there. Plus, it’s really not a bad deal if I get sex like that after.” Cas laughs. “Really though, you doing okay?”
Dean laughed again. “I’m fine, I promise. Don’t be so hard on yourself, angel, I know it’s a little hard to focus when you’re balls-deep in someone. Besides, that wasn’t a complaint, it was hot as fuck.”
Dean chuckled, resting his head on Cas’ shoulder as they watched her head out to the barn. “So, we have an hour, huh?”
“Well we both know that’s not going to happen.”
Love,
“You mean that wasn’t it?” he asks, puzzled.
I sigh. “I don’t understand why you’d want to be. We can’t guarantee your safety if you go after him, and he could take you again. I just don’t want anything to happen to you.”
I nod. “He pushes people away.”
He took a minute to will down his blush, then followed the sound of voices into the kitchen, where he found Sam and Eileen. “Hey,” Sam greeted. “You just missed him. He said he needed some air, so he went outside a few minutes ago.”
“Cas, I...fuck, I’m sorry. I was so concerned with trying to hide it that I didn’t realize...I’ve been putting you through hell, haven’t I?”
Sam shrugs, sitting down next to Gabriel on the edge of the bed. “I’m not thrilled...and I’d really like to know how this happened...but I’m alright. I gave dad a room in the other wing, hopefully that’ll give us some space.”
“Alright. Let me know if you change your mind.” I climb up next to him, careful to leave a couple of inches of space between us. Cas hesitates for a moment before shifting closer, cautiously pressing up against my side. I slowly put my arm around him, feeling him stiffen for a moment before he relaxes. “That okay?”
Benny smiles. “Good. So let’s teach you some basic skills and then we’ll show you what it’s supposed to look like.”
Dean swallows hard, avoiding her gaze. “Yeah. Yes. I’m…I’m really happy. More than I’ve been…in a long time.”
I nod, sighing. “We can’t let him destroy everything we’ve worked for. I just don’t understand...how is this even possible? Why would anyone, angel or demon, bring John Winchester back? Why now?”
Dinner turns out to be a messy affair, and between that and the dirt they acquired during the hunt, Sam decides they need to be washed. I follow him into the bathroom, leading Dean by the hand and watching Sam adjust the water in the bathtub, throwing in several pieces of bright plastic before he turns to take Gabriel into his own bathroom. Dean looks up at me, whining and motioning towards the toys floating in the water. “Alright then, let’s get you clean.” Once I’ve wrestled him out of his clothes, Dean occupies himself with staging a battle of tiny plastic ships while I wash him. Something on his upper arm catches my eye, and I trace my fingers lightly over the pale outline of a handprint in miniature that sits there. Dean looks up at me, smiling. “Do you know what this is?” I ask, mostly to myself.
“I’m not talking about the outside,” Cas hummed, “though that’s beautiful too...I’m talking about the inside.”
Cas hears the tail end of that thought, and he smiles for a moment, then frowns at how much damage he finds. Dean is severely malnourished, but when he glances down he finds the man nearly asleep, and he knows he won’t last through a proper meal. He debates his options for a moment, then makes a decision. He knows Dean will fight it, but he hopes that he’s earned enough trust to do this.
“Fine. I’m almost done. I’ll be there in a minute.”
Mwuahaha, you knew the sexytimes were coming. Remember to review!
“Hmm? No. Go ahead,” he murmurs, flipping through a book. Dean reaches for the remote, making sure the volume is low before finding a football game on TV. He strokes absently through Cas’ hair as he watches, listening to the soft clicks of the keyboard. He tries to stay quiet and unobtrusive, but towards the end of the game it becomes much harder. When his team pulls ahead in the final few minutes he jumps up and cheers. Suddenly he remembers where he is, and he turns to apologize only to find Cas in a hysterical fit of giggles. “I’m sorry,” he chokes out. “I just wasn’t expecting…” he’s laughing too hard to finish, and soon Dean is laughing too.
“Woah. She really likes you. When did that happen?” Charlie asked.
Cas smiles, nodding. "That's good. I still think you should take it easy for a while. Perhaps for today we could relax in here. We could watch a movie if you're interested? You always tell me how important they are."
He chuckles, nodding. “Good. Then it’s fine. Let’s just see what we can do to help you relax.”
Love,
“Trying to help. It’s usually better if you’re near one of us, right?”
Gabriel grins. “Understood. So…what are you gonna do with him?”
Cas squeezes his hand, having all but abandoned his pizza in favor of listening to the story. “What made you go back?”
Cas nods, kissing him happily. "Okay. Thank you. Come on, it's getting late. We should get to bed."
I sigh softly, biting my tongue and kissing him softly. “I know you think so.”
He shakes his head. “No, it’s fine, I was just...worried about you. What happened?”
“Before you ask,” Dean mutters, “I haven’t had a parade of romantic conquests through here or anything. She just likes to be annoying.”
The angel reaches out again, healing the wound in Dean’s neck, before reaching out to me and transporting us both home. Dean makes a small sound of protest, and Cas disappears for a moment, then reappears. “The Impala is in the garage. Now you two, to bed, now.”
I laugh, nodding. “Yeah, I know. It’s kinda crazy. I never thought I’d be comfortable with that kind of thing. But…I want people to know I’m yours too. And that’s kinda the best way humans know how.” I pause, raising an eyebrow at him. “You still haven’t given me an answer.”
Eileen chuckled, nodding. “Sure. What’s got you so freaked out?”
“I believe telling you what it is would ruin the surprise,” he answers.
Cas considered this for a moment, then nodded, closing the door when Dean left and setting the laptop down, pressing play on the first video.
Dean smiled, nodding. “Yeah, sorry, just...thinking about the first time I ever pulled up to this house...soaking wet and tracking mud all over your car...”
“Bitch,” I call after him.
“Yeah,” I nod. “He was...kind of like a general or something, he led a group of warriors.”
“Yes, it did.” I pause. “Hey Cas, what have you been so busy reading all day?”
Cas chuckles, shushing me softly. “Well I’m glad to hear you’re feeling better. And since it’s just us, we can do whatever we want today.”
He shrugs. “I woke up feeling like something was wrong. And then I heard you screaming. Gabriel and Sam did too. We ran down there and saw you on the floor. So Gabriel cut the connection and you snapped out of it.”
Cas frowned. “Dean, why on earth would I hate you?”
I manage a growl at him. “Whatever. Have fun with your browser history Sammy.”
“No,” he murmured to his reflection after a long minute. He wouldn’t sabotage himself this time. He would just enjoy having what he’d always wanted for as long as he could. And then, when it was over...well, he’d cross that bridge when he got there. He showered quickly, but when he wandered back into the bedroom he found it empty. Frowning, he threw his towel into the hamper and dressed before walking out of the room, heading toward the noise in the kitchen. “Cas?”
Cas huffs, nudging him again. “You’re the worst. And yes, tentatively I’m okay with that. Especially if it’s you,” he smirks.
In the morning, Dean woke to soft snores, the arm over his hip tightening slightly when he shifted. He chuckled softly, kissing Cas lightly as he stirred. “Morning sleepy...”
Dean grins at him, kissing him hard for a moment and swallowing his desperate cries. “Good boy. So eager, aren’t you? You have permission. Maybe this will help. Watch.” The vibrations are suddenly turned up as Cas watches Dean’s hand go to the sound, twisting it lightly as he carefully removes it. The slow drag of it inside him is what pushes him over the edge, and he shouts Dean’s name, pulling at his bindings as he spasms.
I laugh softly, kissing behind his ear. “We only get to do this once, Dean. I intend to enjoy it.”
He smiles. “We can take turns, if you’d really like to try.”
I stay quiet for a few minutes, focusing on the feeling of his palm rubbing slowly along my spine. “I suppose you’d like me to get out of your lap now so we can get off the floor,” I murmur after a while.
“Well, I...since you were asleep last night, I...figured I’d do some research of my own. I mean, if we’re going to do this thing, I should probably know a little bit about it, right?”
Dean smiled, nodding. “Okay, good. It seems to make him really happy, but we just wanted to be sure we were doing the right thing.”
I laugh, leaning closer to kiss him softly. “You didn’t think I was going to let you have all the fun, now did you?”
Sam grins widely, gripping his collar and pulling him in for a kiss. "Jesus, yes, I love you so much..." he murmurs against Gabe's lips. The smaller man laughs, wrapping his arms around Sam's neck.
“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” I ask, remembering the pain of that first night.
I look down at the photo again, frowning. “How old were you here?”
“I have no idea,” Dean murmured, fidgeting with the spine of a book. “I’ve been looking for answers, but it’s barely even mentioned anywhere.”
“Very sure,” he answers, turning me around to face him. “He just wanted to know if you were alright. He’s not nearly as conniving as you think.”
Dean chuckles, pushing another metal bead into him, rubbing the first one over his prostate. “That’s my good boy.”
Cas looks down at it for a moment, a shiver crawling up his spine. “Yes. That’s him.”
Dean chuckles, then frowns, thinking. “Cas? What if…she tells you not to continue with our relationship?”
I want, more than anything, to tell him he’s wrong. Actually, first I want to murder him. But that’s a close second. The only problem is, he’s not. I swallow back my hatred for a moment, stashing the blade back in my jacket. “And you think you can possibly help this situation? Gabriel, have you ever helped anyone with anything? Do you even know the meaning of helpful?”
Cas hums thoughtfully, kissing his head. “Perhaps initially, that’s what it was. I had a feeling that our...activities would be good for you. But no, I don’t do it just for you. I enjoy what we do together. I’m sure you’ve seen the way my vessel reacts to you.”
Dean makes a vague motion towards the door. “I thought you didn’t like him. That looked downright friendly.”
“That’s why I’m so good at this,” Meg adds, patching up the wound on the side of his head. “I get a lot of practice.”
He shrugs a little. “Everything in creation must grow, Dean. When we are young…fledglings, if you will, and our wings appear, our families will groom them for us. “
Cas nods slowly, thinking for a moment. “So is it like what Meg and Ruby did? Like a show?”
He sniffs for a little while, slowly pulling away from my chest, and I wipe the wet tracks down his face gently. “Are you okay?” I ask cautiously.
“I want to try involving them,” Cas answers.
“You don’t understand,” he answers, showing a small smile. “This is…the only time I’m convinced it’s not true; what they said about me. It’s the only thing that makes me feel safe.” He gives a tearful laugh. “I mean, you take care of me, and then you sit here and hold me and I actually feel like I’m worth something, because you want me. You say all these nice things, and sometimes I can actually believe you and it’s wonderful. I just wanted to tell you…”
“You’ll be fine, Cas,” I tell him. “We can work on the power thing, but try not to worry so much. We’re here to help, remember?”
“That thing isn’t human, Sam, no matter what you believe. Get out of the way.”
“Yeah,” I manage, trying not to stutter at the unfamiliar feeling of the rope. “Think I’m gonna make some breakfast. Pancakes and bacon sound good?”
A whimper escapes him, and he shakes his head. “Nightmare…” he chokes out.
He nods slowly. “Absolutely.”
He nods. “Got it. Goodnight, Dean.”
“That’s where you’re wrong,” I remind him softly. “The people who love you should be taking care of you. Me and Sam are still here by your side because we want to take care of you. There’s no way we can do that if you don’t let us in. And I know it’s scary, but we would never, ever reject you the way your father did. We get scared too, and lonely, and upset, and sometimes we feel worthless. And we always have you to make us feel better. Let us return the favor sometimes.”
Cas considers it, going over what Dean’s told him. “No,” he says finally. “I think I’m okay without it.” Dean nods, helping him remove it and carefully folding it up, sticking it in his pocket. “Just in case you get cold,” he says, though Cas knows it’s not the temperature he’s worried about.
Benny grins, considering it. “Well, that’s really between you and him, isn’t it? But if you’re asking for my opinion, it’s not a bad place to start exploring if you think you might be into that kind of thing. And a lot goes on at once, so it’s not like you have the whole room focused on you. We’re very careful about who comes in, and subs outline what they’re comfortable with before it starts. I think you just might like it, Cher.”
I nod, squeezing my eyes shut and reaching out, grabbing on hard to the first thing I find, which seems to be his forearm. Realizing that the screaming is not Cas’ but mine, I manage to swallow it down, and the hand over my mouth lifts, slipping down to cradle the side of my neck as he crouches down in front of me. “That’s it. Good boy. Just calm down. I’m not going anywhere, okay? Just keep breathing for me.” I manage to slow my breathing down enough that the black spots disappear, though my chest still feels too tight, and each breath still claws it’s way in and out. Slowly, I open my eyes to look up at him, finding him watching me worriedly. “Are you with me Dean?” I nod again, and his expression softens with relief. “Okay. Good.”
