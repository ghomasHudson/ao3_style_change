"I wasn't claiming that he was Khan Brittanus," said Killander, "Merely that Commander Holmes bears an uncanny resemblance to him." He taped the image. "Uncanny. We know from the DNA analysis that you went through when you joined Starfleet that your mitochondrial DNA match Augments produced by the old United Kingdom,"
A bitter sweet pang. When it had come time to leave, Chin had repeated her request that Billy come away with her. That he and Connor could have a life with Chin somewhere that Chin was always very vague on the details about. A reason Billy could never bring himself to say yes. Always simply ask for more time. Steal another moment and ask for more time.
When he published, he was going to be respected. Social credits were going to rain down. Just like they always should have.
In the next moment, he found himself lying on the floor gasping for breath along with the rest of the crew. "This has gone on long enough," said Moriarty, still wearing his Culverton face. He pressed the phaser into his belly and his flesh opened and merged around the weapon. "Oh, get up." He kicked Wilkes. "You could take a blast three times that setting. I've had a chance to look at the design specs for that body and I've definitely given you an upgrade with this switch."
Not surprising. His husband's strange and wonderful healing abilities meant he never developed callouses. Wounds closed. Broken skin simply healed. Was always sensitive. Every part of him. Down to his lovely toes and soft skin on the bottom of his heels. All John's to play with and tease until his clever husband, who was being so good while John played with him, cried out in release from nothing more than a soft puff of breath to back of his knees and light fingers down the line of his feet.
Another alpha. Invader. Enemy. He bared his teeth at the stench. Sherlock stood up. The cold wind whipped around them. John shivered. Teeth chattered.
Sherlock's hand kept stroking his hair. John felt his lips press against the top of John's head. John shifted to cuddle closer, wanting to scent him. Needing him. As he moved, he felt Sherlock's cock, hard and erect under his thigh. He froze. Suddenly aware of the constant slickness between his thighs. His cock gave a little jump. He was very aware of the way his sensitive nipples brushed against the fabric of his shirt. Very aware of the heat emanating from Sherlock's body. Very aware of Sherlock's cock. His big, fat, beautiful cock that would feel so wonderful if he shoved it in John.
He needed to focus on that. He tapped his com. "Bridge. Have the wreckage of 221C tractor beamed into the shuttle bay. Transfer the full set of all sensor readings from the energy anomaly to the shuttle bay's stations.
Even knowing that Sherlock intended to use the transporter to turn himself into a soft cheeked, big eyed twink for his special day, John found himself stopping to take it all in. Bedazzled. A fool for his love. Not because this was his kink. Frankly, he preferred Sherlock his normal height and mass, but there was always something infinitely delicious in the thought of fulfilling Sherlock's fantasy of being the smaller one for once. He looked so utterly delighted in how he looked.
He heard John say, "But this makes no sense. Humans may have been seeded around the galaxy, but Augments are the result of humans tinkering with our own DNA on Earth in the twenty-first century." John had said the same thing when they’d first arrived in the past. He heard himself come to a realization that the Breen were not the result of parallel development on a parallel Earth.
The blue Breen answered by touching a latch on the side of its body armor. The helmet hissed with a pressure change. They removed the helmet to reveal a Human face with bright green eyes and the unmistakable scent of an omega.
Sally didn't really give a fuck about some prince's blue balls, beyond the part where the Federation was now overrun by augmented fuckers, who were fucking everything up.
When they headed back to DS9, John kept starting to talk about his family with Sherlock, but that kind of conversation felt wrong on the Defiant.
Sherlock examined the details of the cave. Crude sun fired clay pots showing significant use. Mats woven from reeds. Smoke seeping from small holes at the bottom of a large clay pot. He explained their lives to themselves and how the process by which they smoked strips of meat mixed with salt and nitrates would slow the process of decay.
For all of ten seconds he listened to her description of the creatures injures and wished Sherlock were there to think of some way to treat a silicone lifeform, and then then the answer came to John. "Thermal concrete. It has a high concentration of silicone and is used in constructing emergency shelters." John never would have thought that actually having to build an emergency structure on Beyed V when the transporters were once again offline and temperatures were dropping would come in handy.
In either case, they were late for their shifts and they still met in their quarters or sickbay or the bridge or wherever it was they met that day.
Doctor Adams had been the medical director at Tantalus. He'd died of a heart attack on Tantalus. Frankland was the present medical director at Tantalus. There was no other correlation between Adams and Frankland.
"Because Andorians didn't have twins until the four of you," said Papa Shroleb before bopping her nose. Like he always did when she asked.  He bopped Keraass nose, because if Shrilaas got a bop, Keraass had to have one too or she'd scream.
Sherlock decided that the very first place he would go upon arriving on DS9, provided they were not arrested on sight, was this Mr. Garak's.
That night in their own nest, Sherlock, smelling of sharp soap, clung to John and all the next day offered him treats of dried meat and fruit from the stores. John nuzzled his mate to let him know that he understood. John was worried about losing the babies too.
The evening's discussion took many turns. Time dilation or lack thereof. John's access, if limited, to medical supplies from something called a replicator on the shuttle. "We have to conserve power, but its come in handy for things like…" he glanced at Sherlock who was talking animatedly with Sherjo, "not spending the last twenty years getting continually knocked up by someone's magic cock."
Sherlock hailed the Bakerstreet irritably, but there was no answer. There was no answer when John tried. Nor Sh'Alaack. Nor even Erickson or her graduate students.
John had a sinking feeling. A cold, wet, sinking into arctic waters feeling as the name of the theater company was called up.
He was examining something in one of the monitors, which meant something was going on. Some kind of adventure.
There was nothing. John told himself not to worry. This wasn't actually that unusual that the blastocysts failed to attach. Unusual for them, given John's near Normal healing rates, but not generally speaking.
"Slut," coughed his sister. His twin sing songed, "Commander Holmes said something brilliant. Holmes is such a genius. Sherlock told me water is wet. Imagine that! Amazing! Holmes says. Sherlock says. Ugh." Harry flopped back on the couch.
Of course, eventually, John simply drifted to sleep afterwards. This was when he discovered that Sherlock must have had some cephalopod DNA, because John fell asleep with a starship commander only to be snuggled by what felt like a six foot plus octopus all night.
No. Correct that thought held tightly in the middle of the night while she lay in a pile with her bondmates, their soft snores and wheezes a comfort in the dark, and yet the thought remained. She'd never avenge their deaths.
He held the device by the chain and dropped it into the Klingon's hand. There was a tracking device in it. As long as the Klingon was their guard, Chin could find them.
Being careful to keep John in his field of view, he went to look into the pit. There was another alpha shivering in the snow at the bottom.
Also, the soup was blue. John sniffed it and tasted it. It was creamier than bones and veg could make water. Sherlock mimed milking in a way that made John's heart squeeze. He would have kissed Sherlock, but there was soup in the way.
"It's your heart," said the Redbeard. He knew that was the answer. He knew it as certainly as he knew his own name. "It was stolen by the evil Ice Queen for her partner, Yellowbeard, and placed in a bird inside a fox inside a sehlat that lives deep in the mountains.
"It'll be thirty minutes before its ready." John pushed him back onto the couch. John straddled his lap. "I've been thinking we've been getting out of our normal routines a bit since we were married." He pressed his lips gently against Sherlock's. "Gone a little all in now that we can be open about being together." He pressed another dozen kisses to Sherlock's face. "Thought tonight I'd get back to cooking dinner."
Except his fathers had had children they'd left behind. The first Mycroft was part of the chain of reasons that there was a John to love. Chin might yet convince Billy to reproduce with her. Mycroft… actually, Sherlock preferred not to think about Mycroft's romantic entanglement with Elim Garak.
John did not like using kids. He did not like sending them into danger, but they weren't exactly safe as hostages either. If it had been himself, he'd have gone in the middle of the night, but since they were talking kids, they had to settle for middle of the day.
Sarabeth grumbled, but did what Mollyhoo told her to do. Which really, what was love if not putting up with another person's crazy shite, which in this case was not crazy. Other than the part about getting pregnant in the stone age by someone with a magic cock. Magic penis. Whatever.
Donovan said, "Watson, go visit your sister, I'll wait here, while they unload. I'll be heading back in about thirty minutes to pick up the second load." She gave him a significant look. What she meant was if things went poorly with Harry he could return on the first trip back to the ship.
Still, when Chin repeated her question, he asked for more time and sighing Chin said, "I'll wait," and then in a lowered voice, "I love you."
John did not look at Sh'Alaack to see how she was taking that. He did not pull out his phaser to tell Donovan that it wouldn't be him starting anything. His post coital chill was definitely defrosted.
"Again, not without a possible benefit," said Noonian. "What is your alignment? I do not see any insignia on your clothing."
"Two of your crew members have beamed down to the planet. Why wasn't I informed of this!" demanded Killander.
Billy squeezed Chin's hands. Looked into Chin's eyes. His scent a comfort. The rest of her was encased in armor. She'd broken protocol to remove her helmet. She didn't even remember removing it. Only that it needed to be gone so she could let Billy know it was her. So she could see him with her own eyes. Breathe the comfort of his scent, alive and well, if battered by circumstances.
Stepped inside and on reaching the narrow Roman bordello, stood there more than a bit stunned. Breath captured at the first breath of Sherlock's scent. Heart beating like some moon struck madman in a play. Like a lover declaiming his love for the moon over a cup of plum wine.
Several things happened all at once. The creature slid across the floor towards the shop, slammed into the display with the round rock, making it tumble onto its back, which curved to hold it. Eva screamed again. The Andorians moved behind Ms. Hebron, who pulled out her phaser. Mr. Stonn did the same.
The daimon said, "I was paid to destroy a shuttlepod and ensure everyone on it was dead. A contract I would have fulfilled. Instead I found that this lovely gently used Starfleet vessel had already destroyed the shuttlepod and faked everyone's deaths. Now while my contract did specify that I should ensure a Betazed and a Human Omega of your general descriptions were dead, I wouldn't want to presume that any of you are necessarily those individuals. That would be presumptuous. After all I'm not being paid to murder every elderly Betazed and blond Omega I come across."
Sherlock said, "Obvious." Because it was obvious. Equally obvious was that John was now an alpha to Sherlock's omega. The gift of Apollo. An opportunity to experience what John felt like. To know. A perfect birthday.
When we're in an Andorian POV, Bihr's going to parse Andorians not as man/woman/decline to state, nor alpha/omega, but as thaan/chan/shen/zhen.
Because John might have outgrown Juvenile heat, but there was still postpartum heat to deal with, and John did not want to become pregnant again. Not right away. Actually, never had been the exact wording.
Cafa called Daimon Lurin. The cousins loudly argued about what to do. Nom thought it was a trick and that they should do nothing. Lurin said, "That is why grandfather left his latinum to me. You don't have the lobes to hear profit in the wind. I will not throw away valuable merchandise."
Back on the Horta planet, Killander was trying to find someone within two or three generations to the occupants of the cryo chambers to provide a negative ID. He needed someone that closely related because anyone less closely related wouldn't be good enough proof that the people in the chamber were random bodies that had been disintegrated.
They searched the room looking for anything that the Ferengi had missed, but unless they were planning on using the sink, they were out of luck.
Mining the wormhole had been guaranteed to trigger a response from the Dominion-Cardassian alliance. But really, allowing continual resupply by a massive and hostile presence on their border hadn't been a great option either. Anyone deployed in the Gamma Quadrant had seen firsthand how aggressive the Dominion could be.
"Yeah, a few things have happened since you went down to the planet and got body swapped. We got word that the 221C hadn't arrived on Beta Aurigae. We went to investigate, but found nothing but debris." Donovan helped him to his feet.
The larger creature hissed at them and Sestre froze. But Connor gently pushed the storage unit forward, tapping the control that would have it gently come to rest on the ground. The larger creature shuddered as it looked inside. It carefully removed the eggs – perhaps they were eggs – and placed them in a small pile beneath a particular rock formation, which was secreting a yellowish goo. Sestre desperately wanted to scan all of them, but didn't dare move.
"No, no, no. I didn't mean that. Nothing like that." John took a seat to steady himself. So he wasn't looking down at Sherlock. He licked his lips. "I mean that every time, I've gotten," he could say the word, "pregnant there was microscopic scarring. Additionally for each successful implantation there was micro-chimeric transfer of genetic material from the um…" he cleared his throat of the frog taking up residence there and dashed at the water taking up space in his eyes, "blastocysts through my uterine wall." He laid down a tablet and spun it round so Sherlock could see the scan. "I'm a patchwork of genetics in the tissue around my reproductive system. You're in my lower intestine. Left kidney. Left ovary," he gave a sad smile. "Much of the lining of my endometrium is ah… noticeably denser and has highly regenerative qualities that even a heavy cruiser can't do anything about. The same is true for any ovum produced by my left ovary. They're just too dense to penetrate. That's why my um… fertilization rate was down too."
Sherlock drew in a shuddering breath and John reached down. Sliding his fingers over Sherlock's collarbone. Vulnerable as a bird's wing, for all that John knew that even at this age Sherlock was incredibly strong. Durable. Luscious. Red full lips open wide and pulling in a deep breath. Holding it and letting it go.
They were attacked three more times – saved mostly because the figures screamed as they came at them – before they made it to the central square. In the middle, running lights on, was the shuttlepod surrounded by a churning mass of shouting figures. Fighting each other. Buildings. Shaking the shuttle.
Garak smiled, "I can honestly say that your brother has nothing to do with my presence here." Which since Bashir claimed Garak lied like breathing could have meant anything. Garak put down the boxes. "Now as much as I love seeing both of you wearing clothing that I have made, I would like to get a final fitting from the both of you, just in case. You should both disrobe. It's entirely for the better fit of the garment."
Julian answered her by replicating a small brown paper bag and handing it to Hudson.  Hudson rummaged around inside. "Oh, good muscle relaxants. I used to have the most terrible cramps every twenty-four days like clockwork." Lucy wished she'd been so lucky as to only have them every twenty-four days, but for omegas it was pretty constant during pseudoheat as their bodies developed. From what she understood, any alpha transitioning to omega went through the same thing.
She called up some historical records. "Meanwhile, I'm going to see what I can learn about the Greek gods."
Sherlock did want to, which he should not. If John had had the genetic marker for juvenile heat, then Sherlock's reaction would make sense. It wouldn't be still be problematic, but it would make sense. But John hadn't reported that he had it before and given his teens his parents would have given him specific suppressors for it if he had. Sherlock had not made a wider study of the variant among the Augment population, but statistically a low portion of the population would have – John's scent had been intoxicating. Lush. Verdant. There was a predisposition to think of floral scents as sweet, but this was nothing sweet. Heavy and inviting.
Lucy knew Freddy ached at being away from Eva as much as she did, but with a war on, Eva was better off not living on a target and a starbase was just as much a target as a starship. Just a better fortified one.
They kissed Apollo in answer. Their words shaped by every relationship that had come before. "My thoughts are only of you. I'm full of questions. Are you truly a god? Are you really Apollo?"
They gathered in the Temple of the Ancestors. Each members of each alignment visiting the chapel of their ancestors.
John stood up and suggested the children play the flag game, the point of which was to wave pieces of cloth around so the Ferengi didn't see Hudson pull the child proofed cover off the opening to the Jeffries tube cover and set Cecile off on her mission.
Once in San Francisco, the fog swirled around them while they had to find a man in a yellow fedora to give a code word. They were given a riddle, which Sherlock found ridiculously easy to solve. Which led to giving another code word to a man in an old fashioned barbershop, who rapped his knuckles on the back wall, which opened up behind him. They went down a dimly lit stairwell into a posh looking 1920s bar and ballroom. There were actors already interacting with their friends.
Owen, always a ham, ran to the force shield. "Johnny! Oh, sweetheart. I've been so worried about you?"
He spotted the Bakerstreet as soon as it entered orbit. He repurposed the array of devices intended to monitor atmospheric radiation and track meteorological events.
Supersmart did not have time for this. He needed to be in position to turn off the device when he got the signal from Amazing Sparkles.
Something was about the scenario he'd just described didn't fit the facts. "But this makes no sense. Lucy was in the same accident. Reverted just as you were. She was most certainly, fortunately, not interested in copulating with me, nor I with her. Why did the transporter only affect your RVN?"
John did not bother to protest. He did have a sudden and horrible thought that he and Sherlock had had sex on the spot where he was sitting with his father.
Connor had already pulled up a tablet. His fingers were flying over the surface calling up details on Beta Aurigae. "That's funny. There's no date when it was founded. It's just… as if it were always there. Hmm…" He flicked his fingers on the screen and the monitor in their quarters updated with a map of the colony city on Beta Aurigae. "Ms. Khel says you can tell a lot about the history of a place and when it was founded and why by looking at the city planning."
John did not fill in the next line. He was too busy sucking on Sherlock's index finger, what John liked to think of as his fuck finger, the one he always used to stretch John with first.
Luma came to where John, Washington and the others were working in one of the hydroponics rooms. She said, "John, Washington, I've observed that you have a higher level of intelligence than the rest of the Morg. I'm going to need your help repairing the super-heated steam units on level 45."
Idly, over breakfast, Elim had asked Mycroft on one his flying visits, "Where do you think the Breen stand when the war with the Federation comes." He liked the occasional blunt question over quiche. A change in approach.
Ishros, who was not her sweet Ishros, said to Bihr, "You do not know me. I have not your noble deeds, but know that you inspire those of us hiding below the ground. To know that you are free. Fighting for our people. Willing to make the ultimate sacrifice." He came over slowly. Hesitantly. "Filling us with the knowledge we must be willing to do the same."
Veema scowled, "Pavan's alignment believes something impossible. That because you and…ummm… your…the him… were…"
Someone screamed and charged out of the darkness. John shifted in front of Harry and brought them down with a single shot. Picking off assailants in the dark wasn't the most efficient method of clearing their route. But he didn't want to risk shooting Sherlock or Donovan in the dark. Even Sherlock couldn't shake off a stun.
But she was a big girl and couldn't cry just because Mommy wasn't Mommy anymore. Mummy had come by Daddy's place a few times, but just looking at her made Eva feel squirmy.
He was brought down by laser blast from a spear tip that separated his leg from the rest of him. Cauterized the wound. Donovan flinched. She should have figured that a universe where the Khans took over some part of the Federation would be fucked, but she'd been distracted by the stupid sash into thinking it was all a bit of an adventure. Not a mistake she'd make again.
"I'm not an idiot," said John, getting into his role with a note of indignation. "I got three bars before we so much as went to the clinic. I hid the latinum." He leaned forward and dropped his voice so they would have to come closer. "I'll tell you where to find it, if you promise not to say anything to anyone. If you cut me in, I might even tell who the merchant is and we can collect all ten bars."
John sat awkwardly for a bit longer with Billy, until Billy said very softly, "It's okay. I need to be alone for a bit before Connor gets out of school."
Harry immediately poured herself some synthale when she arrived. Finishing it in three quick swallows.
But that had been ahead of them. While carrying the second Tertius John had been stern with Sherlock until he understood that he'd have to wait.
A flash of white. John blinked awake. He was in Sickbay. His lips were dry when he tried to lick them. "McCarthy?"
By six weeks, John was leaving reluctantly in the morning. But Sherlock was studying the latest survey results. Not of his body, but of stars. John had nothing to offer about star maps and celestial anomalies. Time to meet up with the research team and discuss patterns in the results. Melas' neck had a faint pink tinge to it. Their scent had a rich vanilla scent that was unmistakable. His stare had Melas bursting into tears and leaving the room.
Ginger Sparkles laughed. "To do that, we'd need access to the ship's controls. At this point, I'll trust whoever can get us computer access."
It was a certain something that Sherlock had going on downstairs too. Because he'd done something to heal John's reproductive system. Because fallopian tubes that had been sealed didn't grow back on their own. Even down to repairing the scarring. It was as if it had never happened.
When he composed his message to Connor that evening, he said only, "New Vulcan seems small." He was certain that Connor would understand what he meant.
She bared her throat to him. He cuffed her once or twice. Humped against her backside in a dominance display, before rumbling an acknowledgement.
Her mom pushed her lasagna around on her plate. "It's one of the new Pegasus Chimera ships. Fresh out of the yards."
Ion propulsion was purely theoretical, and yet there it was. A ship traveling at Warp 9.6 in their direction. It was why he was torn when the lift opened, and John came onto the bridge with an anal plug inserted – the Andorian from the way he was walking. Eros, love come calling. John grinned at him as if to say, "What is it?" As if to say, "I want to be in on the adventure too."
Mollyhoo wrapped her arm around Sarabeth. "Sarabeth's an amazing artist. Sadly stuck in a primitive period," she snorted and cackled at her own joke. "Um… yeah… she's good."
"Oh." Lucy hadn't known that. "That makes sense." She supposed she ought to forgive him. Years ago. A mistake based on a lack of information. Small ship. Dating a fellow crew member. Just as much a product of science as she was. "So do you know much about the design that went into making you?"
She well knew he didn't particularly enjoy being sent back and forth across the galaxy and would far prefer to simply direct operations from the new Breen home world. But both of them were expected to put the needs of their people before individual comfort.
"How did you… yeah. It was. There was a holosuite where we were supposed to go commune with nature or God or something, but we all used it for sex. There was this one teacher, Father Stephanos, who was the template of a lot of fantasies at that school. Cheekbones that could be used to cut glass and his hair…" John gave Sherlock a look. "We haven't done Priest kink yet have we? Oh, we are definitely doing that."
"Really." Sisko strode over to a monitor and tapped a few controls. He scrolled through a series of messages. "We've been so busy that I haven't had a chance to check… yes, Doctor Bashir was supposed to report to custody." He lifted his chin. "I can't say as I think much of an order that targets an entire population." He spread his hands wide as if lifting a large light object. "Consider yourselves in custody. I'll have Major Kira assign you quarters while I find out just what Command thinks it's doing."
John was supposed to be reacting to the "unexpected" sensations. He came instead, which hadn't really been the plan, but he went with it like a photon torpedo.
A being without documentation about the nature of the modifications that were not entirely to Starfleet regulations, and as Yao often said, anything recorded was sure to be improved upon shortly.
The tracks led to the corpse of a juvenile feradon. One if its tusks had been snapped near the root. He read the scuff marks on the ground like a report. He looked down into a narrow crevice. At the bottom lay young Chin. That she had been alive in the future was no guarantee that she was still alive now. There was blood frozen in a gagged pattern around her head. Her body was bent at a strange angle. From where they were, he couldn't tell if she was alive or dead.
John was not similarly focused on those events. He never mentioned it. He joined a band with Sh'Alaack, Bailey, and Smith. They were terrible, but they would not allow Sherlock to help. They did allow Sherlock to play compositions after they held terrible concerts in the cargo bay.
That Kodos' records, including his DNA and image, had been scrambled was a coincidence too improbable to be believed.
John was getting tired of waking up groggy and dry mouthed. He blinked at the pounding in his head. The restraints around his feet and hands weren't great either. For that matter the queasy realization that he was wearing a linen toga. He hadn't been wearing a toga when he'd been knocked out.
"If you mean that my grandmother wouldn't leave me alone with adult alphas all through my adolescence, and I'll do the same for Eva when she gets older, then yes I do."
"No time," said John, letting go of Sherlock's hand to push Sherlock into the lift. The lift shot to the surface and opened just as a massive rumble shook the ground below them and the dome above. Smoke billowed out of every seam of the lift, choking them as they tumbled forward.
The 221B with the Augments who had been released from questioning, and headed back to the Bakerstreet while the Deadalus prepared to take off.
He reminded himself that he was on a personal mission and asked the question. "Can I have your permission to look at your genomic data on record?" Without her permission, or a genuine medical emergency, John wouldn't be able to access that section of her records.
"Glorious Dionysus," said Mr. Melas, coming out of the ready room. "Whose gift of wine makes even the dark seasons full of delight, Captain Holmes is a young hero of fine pedigree, who has been paired with Doctor Watson," they gestured at John, "erastês to his erômenos. To teach him the ways of manhood, even as we adventure among the stars."
After that fun demonstration, Doctor Adams, the director at the time, had triggered every, "Get the fuck away from this arse," alarm she had. Which given she'd been a third level crew at the time, and got to carry the boxes into his shiny happy asylum, had been just fucking great.
Julian looked at the monitor where the planet was displayed along with the two Klingon ships. He said, "I hope Violet is okay."
John came closer. His scent that terrifying intoxicating blend that smelled so similar to his scent when he was in heat. That filled every corner of their quarters.
"What? Do you people just lurk back here hoping some idiot comes out," said John. He grabbed a board off the ground and hit the Ferengi with it. Which would have been fine, but it seemed the Ferengi had friends. Several of them. John was giving himself even odds of being shipped to wherever the fuck they sent omegas for sex trafficking, when a hooded figure dropped from the top of the building.
"Thank the fuck for that," muttered Donovan. At Killander's glare, she said, "What? You don't have to take annual don't fuck with the timeline training in Internal Affairs. We sure as fuck do."
John didn't protest that he had actually rinsed them already. Instead he asked the billion credit question, "What happened?"
Sherlock checked the scanners. There was one world at the edge of their route. "I've found a planet. It's a non-federation world. I am detecting high levels of radiation and planet wide ice. Based on radiation concentration patterns, I believe there was nuclear war in the past."
She backed away so quickly, she almost fell. "Air filtration on full." She moved as far back as she could. "Captain," she said formally to remind him of the obligations of rank, "you shouldn't be near me or John. Your scent could cause either of us to go into heat."
His Mother laughed. "My son, you have a high opinion of someone who was busy building a place among the Breen. In creating you."
"No," said Supersmart, picking up the tablet. They paged through the document. "It's most likely using our own deflector array to rebroadcast the signal throughout the ship." They grinned back at John. "Come on."
"Um…" she swallowed. "I'm not the only one on the ship who feels this way. Pretty much all the Augments on the ship want to know more."
A sore tooth. She wanted it pulled. She wanted to go back to reality as it had been. When she'd thought, Kodos long dead. When the past only haunted her every few weeks.
"Yay," said Shrilaas, clapping her hands. She'd enjoyed the attention and even drew a picture for a lady who really liked the book.
He was briefly – an infinite age – illuminated with light. The scent of burned flesh filling the air as he fell to the ground.
It all felt marvelously familiar and completely unknown. Whoever they were, some part of him relaxed to know that he was owned by such a self-assured being. Almost whimpered when his master left him there alone, only to return with the box full of toys. A playful smile. "We should see if any of these feels familiar."
"Why have you taken us?" asked John. "We are Federation citizens heading to Beta Aurigae. When we don't arrive, they'll send word for the USS Bakerstreet to search for us."
Watson put his hand on Bihr's wrist, perhaps concerned about her increased respiration. He also appeared to be completely calm, but of course any spouse capable of withstanding as Ishros put it, "The winding whims of Captain Holmes," would have to have a soul of iron.
But it was useless to be mad at Sherlock. It wasn't as if John hadn't been the one pushing to be fucked. And Sherlock's touch felt so good. John rested his hand on top of Sherlock's. Rubbing his thumb over Sherlock's hand. Pulling up his knees as parasite number three really dug in with its villi into the pocket of blood ripped into his endometrium.
When he was done blinking, John told the holographic servant waiting for them, "I would like to bathe my guest."
"You know what, you're right." Her lips turned down. "I am not going to have this conversation with you right now. I'm tired of telling you the same thing over and over. I'm going to go have my grandmother tell me that I got what's coming to me for going into space and then watch her spoil Eva. When you figure out what you want to do, call me." Lucy cut off the monitor.
Sherlock lifted his arms and John threaded his head between them to lean against him. It didn't entirely fix the essential problem, but it felt good to be close.
While Tevek and the Doctor argued over their cut, Julian hyposprayed both of them. They fell to the ground with a thud.
Her expression was so serious it took Connor a moment before he couldn't help but laugh. "Sorry, it's just if you're Augment Inferiors that means you're A.I.s, which is pretty amazing. I know an AI and he can do almost anything. Although, I've met a lot of AIs that tried to destroy the ship. And," he emphasized that last word and raised his index finger, because John said the delivery of a joke was important, "that would make Ms. Melusine an A.S."
Sherlock grimaced. He needed to deal with Marymor without scent markers. She was shaking her head and getting ready to go for the knife.
"I don't think you believe me," said Moriarty. Then he shrugged. "We'll see if Wilkes was up to the task." He leaned forward. "Not that I'll need to deal with him long." He winked at Sherlock.
"Don't worry," said Lucy. "Captain Holmes and Doctor Watson will think of something. Don't worry." She hoped very fiercely and put a smile on her face to keep everyone calm.
As he approached the deflector array level, a voice shouted. "I'm not a Romulan. I don't even know what a Romulan is. I don't know who I am." A low range blast from a modified welder splatted onto the wall across the room. Blackening the metal.
He set Euros' arm with a gel cast. She said, "Sherlock didn't know it was Victor," which told him all he couldn't see by looking at the trampled tracks. She kicked at his leg. Unable to get at his mind. "I didn't know this would happen. I thought it would be fun." She glared at him. "Why wasn't it fun? Why did this happen?"
She went into Lucy's lab and had to suppress a feeling of resentment. Lucy was managing to continue her life unabated. Her course of career was to deal with plants, not people.
Connor exhaled, while Billy held his breath. Connor didn't say anything, looking as pale and sweaty as he had before the hypo injection.
Still, he thanked Benjamin for his advice about talking to Sherlock about his dad. Seemed a long time back. Worrying about the past when it was the future that was the problem.
There wasn't time for more than a quick kiss. Nothing more than a press of the lips, and quick command, "Don't forget me."
She reminded herself to focus on physics. To focus on the individual she wanted to be. Free of painful memories. To focus on the tangible.
A few weeks later, there was another growth spurt. Sherlock was practically at his previous height. John could see how he'd been able to fake his age and join Starfleet so young.
Not-Sherlock's grin grew wider and more manic. "That means you were never angry with me. You didn't really leave me at all. You did it all for us."
Marymor led them over the ridge and down into the next valley. She scrambled though rocks until she came to an overhang.
"Um," said the ginger haired woman, "The monitor in front of me just started blinking red. I think we're crossing into something called the Romulan Neutral Zone. Does anyone know if that's good or bad?"
So, what John is doing here is putting out a general call for Augments, (remember there was a diaspora out of Europe to get away from Green) to do a GWAS to see if he can definitively identify that the SNPs from the relatively small sample set of John, Billy, Owen, and Connor are really associated with juvenile heat by looking at a wider pool of people. He'll need to compare a whole lot of genetic data and have everyone take a survey (phenotypic data) to indicate if when they hit puberty they experienced the XYZ symptoms that I had John exhibit over the course of the story.
Harry held out her hand. John felt an overwhelming sensation of shame at what he'd done to Harry. Stolen all the focus from her when they were kids. Taken Harry's ring. He didn't protest when Harry pulled them off his hand. Harry slid them onto her own hand? His hand? John needed to respect Harry's gender identity choices, that was a given, but something was very wrong.
The next time he went through DS9, he stomped around with it. His leg ached while watching Benjamin cook. Although, Jake, who was growing like a weed, got the staff joke first. It seemed sometime in the last few months, someone had introduced Jake to Terry Prachett's Diskworld books.
She cursed herself for asking a question that was a matter for the public record. She should be able to tell them apart. She knew John Watson. Had spent countless hours with him over the years. Harry's face was shocked into her memory as she raised a phaser to kill Bihr. "What is our worst piece in the Bad Band?"
Kara pointed at a bowl shaped device covered in diodes and wire. If he wasn't mistaken, it was a very dangerous way to create a short term enhancement of neural function while simultaneously downloading information to overloaded neural pathways. "I show you." She put it on before he could stop her and flipped a switch. Lights glowed and her expression changed. "You're trying to remove the consciousness from the Controller. We need him." She placed her hand over her heart. "My people will die if we don't have a Controller to operate this facility."
"We're wearing the same type of ring even." He wanted to think that the gold rings on their hands had some significance too.
Mycroft placed his right hand on the fragile curve of his brother's face. "My mind to your mind," and told himself that he could repair the damage. A pet in place of a brother. Not a lie. A substitution. A wall around a frozen ruin. A place to heal in the same facility under the Mare of Acquisition where Euros had been kept.
"Hey!" Mollyhoo held up a finger. "As I keep telling my children," she gave her own twins a hard look, "it will depend on the decision from the matriarch of each alignment." Given the tangled genetics of the settlement, the first generation omegas had decided it was important that reproduction be based on the careful records kept by the matriarchs. Returning to some of the old traditions for good reason.
He felt Sherlock press a spit slicked finger against his sphincter muscles. Circling. Sliding inside. A gorgeous flutter against his prostate. John stifled a gasp. The door was locked, but this room wasn't soundproofed. His back arched up as he felt another finger press in. They scissored slowly. Gently. Languidly. Taking their time to brush and stretch.
John's eyes flickered over the screen. His eyes widened. "It's not just a reinstatement. It's a promotion. I'd be the captain of a hospital ship to be deployed within the month." He scrolled down. "Because of your long experience working with holographic doctors and practicing medicine on the frontiers of known space, you're uniquely qualified for this captaincy." Sherlock watched words fall like bricks from his husband's mouth, crumbling the north tower, causing cannons to fire in the inner sea at the attack from the east. "Doctor John Watson, the Federation needs you."
With no way to choose, he picked one. Vision dancing. Dizzy. Almost thought he saw John and himself mirrored as they once had been. Not that light then. He went to the next.
He looked across the rather larger holding cell than he'd woken up in last time. More metal bunks. No blankets. Multiple cameras from each wall.
"Eva," said Lucy. "Why don't you finish telling Doctor Watson your story later? You both need a nap."
"How exactly did the future send you a message?" John spoke through his hand, trying to hold in his horror that he and Sherlock had left infants, their infants, any infant in a technological void. A wasteland. An era without antibiotics or replicators or even metal. After all those starts, the time they'd finished had been there and they'd left them.
Mycroft silently had Khan Meiying's transport made ready for her. Chin Singh was placed on a transport pallet and transferred to her care. Her place in the medical lab was taken by William looking pale and still. Motionless.
John was beginning to feel like this was just a time of accidental meetings. He found himself blurting, "Sir, I didn't know you were going to be here."
"No, but, look." Connor pointed to his plate. "That's the Federation." He moved Mum's plate next to it. "That's the Cardassians." Since he was out of plates, he moved the salt and pepper shakers together on the far side of the Cardassian plate. "That's the Ferengi." He flattened his napkin next to the Ferengi and then lifted the salt shaker because he was trying to represent something three dimensional using dinnerware. "That's the Breen. And they're Augments. If they came into the war, it would put the war on two fronts. If they do something good for the Federation, then we don't have to worry about revealing that they're Augments. They can be… I don't know, the United States in WWI and WWII. Good will all around."
"Daddy!" Euros pulled herself, wet with blood and vicera, out of the creature and into Noonian's arms. Noonian looked over at Brittanus, who was staring at little Sherlock. There were tears in Brittanus' cold eyes. Then again, maybe they looked cold because John knew what Brittanus had planned for Sherlock.
Sherlock pulled something out of a pocket, because of course Sherlock had pockets in his robe. "While I have a present for her." He handed John some small purple crystals.
Mollyhoo watched as the love of her life painted the shapes black. Ochre for the stars. A fertility image that looked more like John than any of the others. Although, she had to snort at the representation of Sherlock. He might have a big, and apparently magic, cock, but it wasn't that big.
"Also, he," said John raising his hand with its sensible gold ring. "I use he and he's standing right here."
If John was not going to remove his hand, Sherlock would have to remove his arm from under it. He turned away, but that did not move John's scent. The tingling feeling that remained from where John had touched him. "I will not share coitus while you are this age."
For two and a half days, Sherlock had been in heat and John had rutted with him like an alpha. He was an alpha. John had been an omega his entire fucking life and now he was a fucking alpha. He'd bred Sherlock through his entire heat. There were going to be consequences that John just couldn't beam away.
"They've given Starfleet a positive rather than a negative," said Sherlock. "Let's get out of here." He wanted to be light years away by the time Yao either made her escape, or if she was one of his first father's operatives, the Breen made her escape for her.
"What you're currently doing," gasped Sherlock, bringing his hands up to John's hips, "isn't really conducive to eating dinner."
John tried to clear his head with the bracing cold air and the dark night sky above. In the distance, he heard the thump, thump, thump of some sort of craft. John looked at not-Lestrade, squeezing every ounce of speed out of the craft. In a frying pan and fire sort of situation, he slipped over the side onto the ice and ran across the ice to the six of the path the glide unit was taking.
But perhaps this was a way around that. Still, he was a doctor. He had to mention. "We'll have to suppress your immune system."
Sherlock didn't even pause a beat. He said, "I am an Augment Inferior agent who was altered to appear like your Mummy for operations among the Betas. Given the complexities of the family derivation, you may call me your cousin."
He was thinking so furiously, he only noticed as John laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, "As I just said, are you seeking Jamaharon?" There were indications that he had been speaking for some time.
"The DNA test. While John turned into a little slut sniffing around every alpha that came by, you should know what you're getting into there." She rattled the table again. Shifting side to side in her seat. "I know he kept that up when he went to the academy. I could smell it on him when we went for our visits."
John moved his hand away, while his husband cleaned and cared for his wound. His very adult, very mature, very luscious smelling husband.
Sally had to do something she really didn't want to do. She tapped her com. "Captain, you should come to the bridge and take the con."
"And my semen," supplied Sherlock. "What have you concluded?" Those changeable eyes of his were wide and blue in the starlight from John's window.
His mother winked at him. "Does a mother need a special occasion to visit her son? Now I really must go. See you in a few days."
"Why would they? For failing to do the one thing, the one thing, that every Breen running a reclamation facility like this has been commanded to do. And now Prince William's pet has been lost. Again."
"No, we're not allowed to play with you!" said Chin firmly, sitting up. "Mother and our Fathers said so." Chin Singh was glad. Euros made her feel uncomfortable. It wasn't just that she was a year older. Mycroft was even older, but he was just boring.
Thus the landing was not his best effort. That he managed to land at all was a testament to his skill as a pilot. Although, excellent reflexes were nothing he could take credit for having. He even managed to bring them down near a cluster of buildings in the equatorial mountains.
As to Mollyhoo, she spent more time in the refrigeration chamber than she liked. Best spot to throw up given the lack of cleanup. She set off John, who set off Sarabeth.
He had a couple of chem heat sticks in his bag. Supplies for a very different trip. He lit them. It wasn't enough to heat the cave. He made a tent over himself by draping the thermal blanket over himself and the creature. With the sticks between his legs and the children stashed in the creature, it should keep them from going into hypothermia.
"Well, that's…" Snow swirled in the wind over them. Dry and light. "Bad." John shivered in the cold. "We have to get inside before our core body temperature drops further."
"But how would that equate to the object being an egg? It could be something precious to that species," said Sestre reasonably. It was unreasonable to equate a geological oddity with a lifeform without further information, but Sestre knew better than to say so to Connor. His father had had to talk with him several times on the subject after Connor's Human emotions had been hurt by a perfectly reasonable remark by Sestre.
"No," said John a bit more forcefully than he'd intended, and then a bit more softly. "The Romulans have to be scanning us. If we fire on anything, they'll increase speed and investigate, and if we've got something illegal onboard, I'd rather not have that conversation."
Bihr came out of the ready room, looking excited, cheeks still slightly damp. "I have had an idea. I think there is a way that we could restart the instruments on the bridge in safe mode, which would give us limited control over the ship. We might even be able to restart them altogether." They waved a hand at Amazing Sparkles. "Use the tricorder to override the lockout on the panel locks, and then we can access the isolinear chips, which will give us a way to restart." They waved the tablet. "There are clear instructions on what to do."
He put down the cup, and glanced back at where Frankland was sitting behind a pane of glass in the lighting and sound booth. "Harry, is Frankland doing anything um… well…" John wasn't even sure what he was trying to ask. He struggled to think. He came closer to her and lowered his voice, "What's going on?"
Connor wished he'd read more about the first Augments when he'd had the chance, but he hadn't really wanted to think about it. He sent a message to the Bakerstreet so Eva could ask her mom recommend some books.
Eva grinned. "Flopsy can be whatever he wants to be." She took the doll back and squeezed it, shifting the stuffing. "Now she's a girl omega. And she's going on an adventure. In a shuttle." Eva prattled on explaining Flopsy's adventure on the shuttle.
Eventually, Victor noticed how quiet William was being and he did the thing Victor always did. The reason why Chin knew that for all that their tutors encouraged each of them to compete that Victor would be selected to follow their parents as the leader of the 23
John applied a stasis devise to Sherlock's over developed head and since it wasn't built do anything, but stop bleeding, re-programmed it to supply the impulses to tell Sherlock's heart to keep beating. To tell his lungs to keep pumping air. At some point, while doing all of this, he flung the anal plug against the wall, because some things were just not on while trying to save the love of his life from dying.
"You're a treasure. Perfection." John stopped his own babble with a languorous kiss. For once not getting a crick in his neck. He stepped back and called out to his servants. "Dress my guest in sea silk." Technically it wasn't actually silk made from the fringes of some sort of extinct clam, but the green fabric certainly had a lovely sheen as it shifted, open on one side to expose Sherlock's pale moonbeam body with every movement.
Sherlock did not care to answer just yet. There were other versions of the figures in alcoves in the walls. Humanoids. At least one representation of a large feline. Some figures with faces not unlike Earth ardvarks menacing the humanoids.
The logical thing to do after picking an incorrect portal was to pick the next portal over, but curiosity overcame Sherlock. After all as long as they were quick, there was so much they could learn.
Why it was better if their beautiful wonderful brave Primus and Secundus, so tall and strong by the time they'd gone, had to go into the past.
A girl, young Chin by her eyes and face, skidded into the room. "Why did we come in here? It's boring here."
"Just too right," said John. The Breen removed their restraints, which was a good sign. Course, the Breen were wearing walking tanks. Could be useful if there was a clear spot to pull a runner. They were taken to a turbolift that looked like something out of a wild eighteen hundreds fantasy with ribbed gates and pulsing blue walls. It smelled faintly of vanilla and bread. Billy put himself between the Breen and Connor and as the doors to the lift opened, exploded into motion attacking the nearest Breen, sweeping its feet out from under it, and wrenching a neural disrupter off one of their gauntlets.
About dozen reasons it wasn't perfect bubbled up in John's head. Sherlock was a full Augment with all the flaws those original scientists had accidentally created along with the strengths. The very healing abilities that kept him so healthy would make it nearly impossible to bring a pregnancy to term. The thought made John ache. The very thought of Sherlock's delighted expression dissolving into loss. John squared his shoulders and did what he did best. Focused on what needed to done right now, which was deal with the entities. "You know what, this isn't the time to discuss it." He glared at his tricorder.
"You remember Euros, and not me?" said Chin in a fair echo of their first father's tone of voice when crossed. "After what she did to us?"
"He ran away from home and faked his ID so he could join Starfleet three years early. That's why he's from the whosey-whatsitplanet that lost its records. They don't let cadets in until age eighteen and Sherlock is the least patient person in the history of ever."
Sherlock almost grinned. It was in his eyes, if his mouth was virgin prim. Even as he spread his legs wide. "Sir, you're so large. I'm afraid you'll hurt me."
John slid one hand up Sherlock's chest. "Now as much as I love your gorgeous cock, you've got so many other lovely parts."
"John, if not now, then we never will." Sherlock's moved into John's space. Always closer. His scent, intoxicating to John no matter his apparent age or gender. Always uniquely Sherlock.
Mollyhoo wasn't tired. She should be. She had plenty to do. Instead of doing it, since the day was pleasant, she went to the top of the tallest tower with Toby the fourth. Looked fondly out at the valley with its little squares fields. Each tended by a different family alignment with the produce shared in common. Herds of unishap grazing on the mountain sides of the next valley over. Baskets of their dung gathered for the fields. Little houses made of kiln hardened bricks. Bricked refrigeration granaries on the high mountainsides built to capture the cold wind and keep out pests. Brick and mortar towers as it came to it too.
"Well, aren't you?" said Fenrir. Her voice low and hard. It wasn't really a question. "You're a body birth from the twenty-first century from before everything got ruined. You've got. Augmented hearing. Reflexes. You're stronger than any of us. Ms. Melusine showed us your gene scans. You're mostly Augment Superior. You escaped Colonel Green's reeducation camp in Namur. That's where they experimented on Augments with augmented healing. Ms. Melusine had us study Colonel Green's atrocities all last week."
"Relevant to the question of if he's this Khan you're talking about," said Odo. "Saving the Earth doesn't match Khan's profile."
But as long as John was careful, it was fine. He’d healed the members of his pride. What they did after that was up to them.
He wasn't fast enough to avoid a backhand that sent him flying against the wall in a blow that had his head ringing, did his back no favors, and probably cracked some ribs. Victor tried to yell, but the blood pressure in his body rapidly dropped to an unsustainable level. John really did not want to get up. But he had to finish this. He knew what Sherlock could heal from.
John looked at the camera directly above him. "Because you got nothing out of that? And don't think I don't know you practiced with the hose things before trying them on me." He waved an arm at the pile of small bolts where Sherlock had practiced with the pseudopods to get the pressure right.
"Intercrural was traditional in ancient Rome," said Sherlock between kisses. "I've been researching." He pressed his legs around John's cock.
"Later." John got up and laced his fingers through Sherlock's. "Let's have sex on the bridge of the Bakerstreet while no one's on board. Well, Billy, and whatever techs are handling maintenance, but we can lock the lift."
Shrilaas and Keraass were both too young to participate in the Day of the Ancestors' rituals. They were delighted to be distracted by the symbols of the four genders: star, soil, water, and fire.
The use of water as an additional element evoking transformation was amazing. If, occasionally, wet for the audience.
Among the Changelings, what need did he have of a name? Several of the other Changelings trapped on this side of the wormhole had challenged him about that affectation. Gamma Quadrant Changelings with no idea of the variety that came of being in the Alpha Quadrant. The individuality. The chaos.
They shifted against each other. A new angle finally allowing the swelling curve of his alpha's knot to press inside on the next inward stroke. Teasing him. Fucking with him. John needed everything his mate had to give him. He needed his knot. He managed to find the words. "Knot me! Now!"
Eva said, "I'll just tell the bad men I crawled into the wall to get some alone time and got lost. Actually, I think I can do it." Eva scowled. A tiny fierce expression. The yellow ribbons around her braids completed the picture.
She waved at the empty seat next to her. "I've driven off eight cadets." She shook her head. "When did they get so young?"
by burrowing into the endometrium to make way for the blastocyst, which since all Augments had some improved healing was certainly one way to invade an endometrium.
"Are you here to call me a monster?" She turned her hands in the field, palm up. "What, will these hands ne'er be clear? No more than my Lord Father's. I marred all with this starting. Bloody hands."
Sarabeth coughed. "What we're trying to say is it's pretty clear that you've got Sherlock on a pretty tight leash. So, no one is worried he's going to try and kill us during or after sex. So the main question is would you let him rut with any or all of us when we go into heat, or would you kill anyone who tried? Um… or dig out our eyes, because that would be a non-starter."
Melas tilted their head. "I've always preferred an Athenian chiton myself. Easier to walk in, but to each their own." Melas grinned at Wora. "Thanks for the invite for coffee, ma'am. I'd be happy to learn more about how things work on the Bakerstreet. But I'm afraid I'll be late for my shift."
"We do not control the lights," said Acheron. "The lights are here for our benefit. They bring us memories of peace."
Perhaps that's why he had John come down with him to Amerind to discover just why it was populated with Humans from various Native American tribes. With monoliths that were apparently used to ward off asteroids. Perhaps landing in what for all appearances was a recreated Cuzco of the Incan empire had been a poor choice.
"Uh, I prefer to think of myself as mine," said John feeling more than a little lost in the conversation.
This certainly isn’t why I wrote John’s academy experience as I did. But when I reached this scene, having planned for this sort of thing to occur, it was one of those writing moments where the character said, "Hold my beer, the conversation would go like this."
Left her wondering if she would be able to face Doctor Watson without flinching. Without seeing his twin raising Bihr's own phaser. Without seeing her parent's murderer giving his life to save her.
After coming up with that gruesome theory, escaping the Coms, being nearly speared by the Yangs, it was just John’s luck that a planet named Omega IV fucked John's suppressors all to fuck.
It escalated to threats of violence from another prisoner angry about past events that had never happened. "First time I met the woman. Orion twig of a girl fresh out of the asylum. Figured it would be best if I bugged out."
Connor pulled up the city map, and they learned what there was to know about Beta Aurigae, which as it turned out wasn't much. There wasn't much about its history in Federation databases.
His mother enfolded him in a hug. "John, it's been too long. Look at you. My son. A Doctor." She looked sweetly into his eyes. "A tool of the military establishment."
He felt a little differently, when he found out she'd turned around and tapped Watson to run one of the rust buckets they'd found for a MASH. Watson had nerves of steel and was a damn fine doctor, but it did meant Holmes was going to be an especial joy.
Pavan said, "The future sent a psychic message to our ancestors to start holding the Conchordia Ancestrum. It drove an entire mining station insane. Of course, they only told us to hold them until word came to stop."
Sherlock took them up a spiral staircase to a wide hallway lined with murals of what looked like gene scans. They went through an open door and into yet another reception room, where yet more partying was in full swing.
Not only was Lucy there, with Hunter, Smith, and Hudson, but Sisko, Dax, Bashir, and Lestrade were there.
While First Father was almost pleading. "My son, you must know, I knew nothing of this. I only insisted on your training as a child to overcome what your sister… I didn't know."
He'd been like that when he and John had been involved too. Part of what had been so creepy beyond how uncomfortable he'd been with John during sex. John shrugged. "They were both Augments. He doesn't talk about them much. Harry and I did one of those DNA sequencer things back when we were in our early teens to figure out which Khanates our ancestors came from and, of course, there's the one we get from Starfleet."
She could have assigned any of her engineers to come down to Elba. A simple thirty minute calibration check. She was the head of engineering. A position she held through the trust and support of Captain Holmes. She had other tasks. Even Captain Holmes had elected not to come down to the planet.
She sent back, "Not well." And got an immediate response. "Khel and I are coming over. You select the stupid child inappropriate Human entertainment to expose us to." Lucy smiled at the monitor.
She was looking happily at the door and chewing grain for the next batch of beer, when Sarabeth said, "I'd gotten so used to alphas trying to kill us, I'd forgotten how good they can smell."
They attempted to access the computer, but they only received a reply of, "Memory systems locked out on command authority. Please initiate release sequence to unlock."
That seemed to settle the argument. Hudson came over and pressed a cold cloth to his forehead. "A little warning would have been nice before you attempted this ploy." She slipped him the smallest of the children's tricorder. The one with the low level scanner. He hid it in the sock of his right trainer. It was the only place he had. He was wearing a robe, socks and trainers. Because of course his body's timing was fucked like that.
"You don't have to do this if you're not up to it." John wasn't sure how they would come up with access to a replicator or the parts needed to do whatever techy thing Sh'Alaack needed to build, but they'd figure it out if they had to.
Bihr grabbed the present and followed Stonn across the hall into a service stairwell. The over wrought décor giving way to more comforting Andorian Neo-Classical architecture. They did not pass many people. The occasional Normal Human in brilliant red uniforms.
He flushed with lights in levels where no one had gone in centuries when he understood how John had kept his body alive. He hadn't even thought about his body in his blind need to see John after he'd become incorporeal. Had assumed – incorrectly – that his body was lost to him.
John, who was about to lose the plot on the folds of fabric, stopped. "Thank you. Oh, you know Roman togas, they're all the rage."
A feradon did not leap out at her. She did not lose her way. She didn't stumble when Euros – she would never call that bitch her sister – made her see what wasn't there. Her brother, who could do anything, did not leave her behind. There was no need for a stranger from another alignment, or so she'd been told, to carry her back to her parents.
If the Organians had actually been simple villagers and not ascended energy beings who maintained their planet as a reference point, John might not have made it back from that one.
Sherlock stopped looking for the signature quantum waves. He climbed up to where John was, pretending that his Augmentation wouldn't allow him to simply jump up to where John was. He looked inside the chamber.
Sherlock was by no means ready to go. Was ready to couple with John again beneath the stars while mermaids sang melodies to them.
Stonn picked up two collars similar to the one he was wearing from a charging device. He efficiently placed one around Watson's neck and then one around Bihr's. She was unsure if the better course would be to resist or stand there. She hoped it wasn't the type of collar that did worse than a mild electric shock. Stonn took the present from her hand and placed it thoughtfully on the transport station.
He wasn't her sibling. It didn't have the same meaning. He said, "How did you access the failsafe when Sh'Alaack was working."
Culverton guided him down curving corridors full of those spiraling double helix designs the natives had been obsessed with. A disturbingly organic architecture. Everything was rounded and curved. It was the only thing that put off Sebastian about this site. There wasn't a straight clean line in the place. It was as if the natives had grown the city out of sea shells and stone trees. But it didn't matter if he could prove his theories here. They came to an area Sebastian had never been to before. Was outside the area covered by the expedition's shielding.
Sarabeth gave her a dry look. "I liked omegas before I came to the past, and I like omegas now, but…" she shrugged, rueful.
John wasn't entirely certain why he wasn't included in the category of people who should be left alone. "Maybe tell your friend how you feel and then give her some space."
The marks on Sherlock's neck turned brilliant red. A brilliant echo of the pale marks on John's own neck. Still there despite John's venture into being an alpha. Changing genders didn't erase scars. Only Sherlock did that.
At least, not the Andor that Bihr knew. Elements were the same. She could not have been bonded to an architect for over a decade without learning something. But slabs of ornately carved red stone decorated in gold leaf were bolted to the walls covering the Neo-Utilitarianism style's clean lines and shapes.
He followed John's scent. Stopped at the sight of him stretched out on a reed mat. Skin glowing in the light of a full moon. Twisting his hips in the air. His body's sharp edges softened. His scent ripe and lush. Milky motherhood and rich fertility.
Feelings made even worse by the fact that he'd missed John while he'd been away. Desperately. Had told himself John's absence was an opportunity to work on his experiments, but in the deepest rooms of himself, he knew he'd avoided their quarters because he hadn't wanted to sleep in their empty bed. Be in rooms that would be empty of everything but John's scent for weeks.
As her heart raced in a manner it hadn't in over a decade, Martha thought, "It is possible that Donovan had a small point." She had taken rather more risks since arriving on the ship than was prudent. Some part of her, with a voice very much like her sector supervisor in her twenties, kept saying, "What? Why?" seconds after she'd launched into a flip, or a kick, or a particularly difficult maneuver to take down yet another Klingon.
The tapestry fell over the alcove door behind John. "So," he said more to scrub his brain, "ever hear of the story Frozen?"
"Sometimes they would visit. More often there were holographic versions of them." He leaned into John's hand. "It's where they took me when the Borg were invading."
"Do not tell me again that it is time," said Apollo. "I gave them the staff Asclepius and medicine, not the apple of discord. I have given more music than I let my arrows fly. I led the muses, my daughters born by human women graced with my love, to teach them science. Music. How to calculate the curve of this world. How to write and remember what is long since done. I will not abandon them because of one conflict."
"It's okay. I've got you." Sherlock realized he was breathing too fast. Heart careening out of control. He was shaking. John's hands cupped his face. His knees bracketed him. "I've got you." When Sherlock had calmed, John smiled wryly.
"Mates." More blank looks. John did not know why they didn't understand something so simple. He tried a different question. "Why me? Ask Sherlock."
"Your records are very patchy. Conduct unbecoming an officer at the Academy." Killander tisked. "A rather unfortunate gap in hazardous materials protocols resulting in the entire crew being infected and nearly destroying the ship."
"I said we could be experiencing pseudopregnancy due to any number of conditions, but that doesn't rule out," she glanced at Sherlock, "ummm… magic cock. Although, it remains the least likely of a dozen theories."
He knew John wanted him to pretend everything was fine. He pretended not to hear John break down with his mum.
Still, after a further month of running around mountain terrain avoiding murder clans, John should have been in terrible condition. Washington had spent the entire time training the Yang in military strategy and sleeping in a bed, but looked like he’d been dragged backwards through a hedge. The training was maybe a violation of the Prime Directive, but John was under the impression that was more honored in the breach. John, who as long as he had to sleep with Sherlock for warmth each night, had taken advantage of the opportunity to shag him every night, felt and knew he looked fantastic. His skin was clear and glowing. His hair was rose water spa soft.
The Bakerstreet did not have the facilities to take several thousand people anywhere, but Starfleet quickly ordered a large capacity troop transport when Command learned that there was an ion ship available for study in return. It wasn't a violation of the Prime Directive. Although, a certain degree of obfuscation about the current technical level of the Eymorg and Morg was called for.
Some nights John realized that Sherlock had stretched himself. An indication that Sherlock wanted John to claim him. Own him. Take him over. That he always wanted that. Needed to be owned by John. Was owned. Married. Husbands.
"I'm stronger than I look," said Sherlock with some dignity, which he immediately lost in having to carry Finney clinging to his back. Even wearing a breather, face mask, and so burdened, Sherlock made good time as he ran through the brilliant red and yellow rocks.
Which since she wasn't wrong, John found himself retorting, "You're just imagining things because you destroyed your marriage by cheating on Clara."
Went to see Hudson to find out the size of the massive cock up and what kind of raw wankers they'd be getting.
Prince Sparkles said, "Isn't this just exciting. Randomly manipulating machinery we know nothing about on the word of a woman none of us knows."
John peeled himself out of his silly flannels and wiped himself down with them. Normally, he'd have felt sleepy after coming like that, but instead he felt energized.
Owen snapped his fingers and the guards slammed the butts of their spears on the floor. They shouted, "Sir!"
Sherlock sniffed. "That metaphor is muddled and makes no sense. There's still gaps in senior staff positions that require experience." Which was Sherlock all over.
"Question is," said Marida, "who manages John? His temper certainly hasn’t improved since he," he waved his hand.
"Females of our species develop more rapidly. That is why you should look to them for leadership and example," said his father placidly. As if there were any Vulcan girls on board ship. The only other child Sestre's age was Connor, who had been through war and famine, and all sorts of things.
Sebastian Wilkes sneezed. The ruined city was full of dust and debris. That and the celebrium radiation, which Doctor Culverton assured him was not an issue given their shielding. But it was going to prove to everyone what Sebastian knew down in his bones.
A blond woman picked up a spear and pointed it at them. "No, we're not." She at least was able to discern Sherlock's scent.
He could feel with his fingertips. But almost as if there was a layer between him and what he was feeling.
John did want a weapon. Or a hypospray. Or a scalpel. It would seem, he'd have to stick to a set of novelty dildos. "Other children?"
It was so comforting a thought, and it had been so long a day, that he fell asleep in his comfortable chair as one might fall asleep in a hammock swinging below a tree house constructed by ones grandfather.
"You both got tap, singing, and piano lessons, dear," said Mum. "Quitting fencing was your choice, which I supported as your decision, and no one calls you a fuck up. You're simply exploring the darker aspects of your art. You'll be a better artist for it."
Connor sighed, and pulled Eva next to him on the chair. They curled against each other, while on the far side of the room the adults argued. Ms. Hebron had looked in the records and found that this was not the first time such an attack had occurred. There had been an attack a hundred years ago. A much larger creature than the one that had burst through the wall had stolen the nuclear reactor's circulating pump before being driven off by the miners.
Sherlock set it to blow and sprinted down the tunnel towards the mine entrance. Even he wasn't fast enough to out race the blast, which lifted him off his feet and carried him down the tunnel.
Sally did not ask, "What the ever living fuck are you on?" He didn't have the mildly strung out look of a man who'd taken to drugs to deal with a boring arse post overseeing criminals. She said, "Care to give me the tour?" At a minimum, if she'd get more intel, which she could put in a report and someone outside of her grade could deal with it. Eventually, given Starfleet bureaucracy.
"Don't bother," said the figure. "It'll have closed almost as soon as you went through. I'm Mollyhoo. The Fenisal took my ring, but it was silver. So, let's get the pronoun game solved right away. I consider myself female. And if you can't scent it in this awful downpour, I'm an omega, of course. I don't even know why, I even brought it up. Never mind…Not that I can ever can scent it. I'm missing the vasopressin 1b receptor gene… umm… that's part of our olfactory system that allows me to scent the difference between alphas and omegas,
Shor and Thil. Shrilaas and Keraas. Names that had been put in her head so she could become John. Take over the Bakerstreet for Frankland. Lethe. Adams. Names and no faces.
She laughed in his face. Pulled back her hair and shifted in her seat, and for a moment, John was sitting across from him. The scent was wrong. She had John's blue eyes. She had John's hands and finger prints. She let the hair fall. "All I had to do was not be myself. Talk to this or that engineer and crawl through endless miles of tunnels."
She went on a raid. Scooped up some scared Andorians. A lot more scared migrants from all over the sector. It seemed that people were flooding into the few worlds that weren't in the middle of a war, which ironically included this one.
Sometimes, John just shifted his hips until his husband got impatient with a growl. Rolled them over and slammed so hard inside John that the head board rattled against the wall, and even the vacuum of space would have been able to hear how they both keened if not for the privacy shield that his brilliant husband had installed so they could yell as much as they wanted after John suggested he'd yell louder in the night if it were there.
Hudson sighed. "So, you actually have read my record and have decided to ignore the experience it implies."
He grabbed his mate by his robe and dragged him into a kiss. Into a grapple. Biting. Scratching. Shouting as his alpha finally thrust inside John. Not even that far. Not even fully buried into him.
John was more than ready. He really wanted Sherlock's cock inside him, but given what he knew of Sherlock's refractory period, what he needed first was to get Sherlock out of his clothes. He let go of Sherlock's wrist and reached down under the tablet. Sliding his hand through the flap in the silky jim jams to grip Sherlock's rock hard cock.
"Mollyhoo," said Vesha. "I don't see why it's a problem. You said that we experiencing… I can't pronounce it, but false pregnancy symptoms."
All was smoke. All was fire. Pine pitch at his back. John's aromatic scent the scent of the forest. Of the wild. Of everything Sherlock needed. John on his knees, face buried between Sherlock's thighs, licking labial folds and clitoris. Whirled suction.
"Of course," it boomed. "The Federation no longer exists. When the Borg invaded Earth, Starfleet's local defenses attempted to channel fusion energy from the Sol star through the lunar defense systems to destroy the Borg ship, which resulted in a chain reaction that destroyed the entire system along with the Borg ship. With two of its founding worlds, Vulcan and Earth, destroyed, and the Andorian reproduction rates reaching an extinction level point, the Federation quickly fell to invasions by its nearest neighbors."
It had never been meant to be permanent. She had expected at most six months from the moment she put it on, and set in motion the events that should reveal Soo-Lin's crime. She'd expected time to get to know Sherlock. Time to follow family tradition, and run away from home.
"I… yes, with the right equipment," said Bihr faintly. She was a slender anchor upon which to rest faith.
Which… John glanced at the rest of the bridge crew, who were very studiously not listening to this conversation.
"Whatever," said Victor. "I'm Prince Mshindi Victorius Augustus, first born son of the great Khans. I've decided I want to be called Victor."
John tended to play the role of concubine as a sassy wanton. Experienced. Flirting with this or that holographic figure, until getting his due punishment. Sherlock had other desires. He could admit that. Here. In this space. It was safe to admit that he had desires.
"We've got time. Connor's eleven and a half, right?" Billy nodded quietly. "I start the research now. I do a larger study with a larger pool of people. Make sure I'm narrowing in on the right bit of our genes. Look at treatments. You have my promise. I'm going to put all I've got into this to make sure Connor doesn't go through this. Yeah?"
Sestre drew in a breath at something he saw in the tricorder. Something about the round rock. Something about the creature.
In the end, Cecile was able to manipulate most of the wiring, but there some things that were simply too heavy for her. Every time she tried to lift them, she toppled over.
John gave into the attraction of the floor. He felt as if something was clawing at his insides. Technically something secreting a hormone that dissolved several layers of cells was. He told himself they were just tiny pockets of venous blood. No more than the head of a pin. Into which the parasites were sticking little villi so they could feed off him. He repeated, little more than the head of a pin. That because the original scientists had been utter cocks, he had nerves to feel what was going on. Parasite five's jab had him gasping. When it was done, he said, "Hudson had a present for you." John handed Sherlock the small tricorder.
Sherlock played his violin to avoid speaking to anyone. When he finished Mendelssohn’s Lieder, John said, "That's one of my favorites that you play."
Redbeard turned and slashed the tusk across Yellowbeard's arm and chest. He felt whatever that yellow stuff was dragging him down. Poison. His brother had poisoned him. He felt ill. Numb. He couldn't feel his chest. His heartbeat was very loud. Still he staggered up.
Sherlock's smile shone like electric stage lights. "Interesting. Have there been any changes in the mining operations."
For the fun of it, she got up and kicked as high as her head. Something she hadn't been able to do in years. What did it matter that she couldn't hear anyone's thought's.
"You had something to do with what stopped the Borg," said Sisko very quietly. "Command was very hush, hush on the details. You've hinted a few times, but… I thought I was imaging things."
"Who was trying to erase your memories?" Sherlock did so dislike it when people were imprecise using pronouns rather than actual names.
They walked out hand in hand. Sherlock unable to complete his questions, couldn’t know if they were hand in hand in other ways.
The girl said, "Miri. I'm Miri." She rubbed at the snot running from her nose. "But you can't fix. That's fibbing. Grups said in the before time that they could. But all the grups went wayside. We onlies had to hide till they died. Now the only grups are when one of the olders of the onlies passes over." She scratched at her lesion.
Connor shook his head. If Sestre didn't recognize her, then Connor didn't want to say. He would want to call security. "I don't know." Lies on lies. Security was not his friend. He wasn't supposed to run to any security that wasn't Ms. Donovan. They might take him away like Colonel Green's men had done. Rip him away from Mummy. Put him in a cage. Hurt him and Mummy.
Sherlock did not want to hear more about John's activities with another alpha. He wanted more tritanium to crush, but actual tritanium.
Other thing that was the fuck wrong, Hudson couldn't hear Sally thinking any of that. Since she couldn't, Sally gave her a little help. "What the fuck are you doing here?"
He hummed his agreement. "Not going to." He rubbed his cheek against Sherlock's chest and chased sleep to the sound of Sherlock's heart.
Sherlock groaned. "Of course you're much more interested in doing anything other than answer my questions. I have statements from multiple individuals claiming that…"
Before that golden look, that wonderful command to do anything but say, "Yes." Watch as the omega lubed up the smallest dildo and teased him with it. Finally sliding it inside him. Foreign. Controlled by the omega's hand. "Feel familiar."
When he woke, John's scent had shifted. Not returning to its new normal. But something more liveable. Something that allowed Sherlock to think.
The teens had been chattering in the gymnasium for the last several days of the Meiosis of Alignments, while Chin and her brothers, free for once from their tutors, hid beneath the equipment and listened to their plans of attack for the course.
As Sherlock pushed pieces of bread and butter pudding around his plate, John rested his bare foot on top of Sherlock's. To let him know he was there when he was ready to respond to what John had told him about what he'd found.
"You have a working neural neutralizer?" That hadn't been part of the asset manifest. Admittedly, the neural neutralizer had been one of Adam's more outré theories with all sorts of legal and ethical considerations.
John sighed. "There are healing properties in your blood and sperm, which has consistently overcome any contraception I've used. Not that it's come to anything." No need to explain why. "But you should know your own results." He handed over his research. "Any ideas why or how this might happen?"
The lead alpha on his heels, smashed Sherlock into the wall. Running on. Intent on the scent that had made its way past even the cold room. Perhaps carried by the very wind that rushed through it.
Billy wrapped his arms around himself. More meat on him than when he'd arrived on the Bakerstreet, but the bones of that refugee from the past were still there. "Are Sherlock and John in danger?"
"I was thinking that you have a long time before you need to be an adult and that you should enjoy being a child now," said John with what he hoped was a convincing smile.
The thought that his light was his savior come to save him just hours after Sherlock had murdered his sister.
Sherlock knelt next to him. "With the naked eyes, I am seeing the light of stars that are currently burning and distant ones that have long since died. Here on the skin of the ship, it's quiet. My mind is an engine that requires constant matter to consider or I tear myself apart, but here, I'm reminded there is more than enough to know. In my life, brief by comparison to the stars, I can travel and never run out of things to learn." He hadn't intended to say quite that much. But it was the same answer he'd given when John had asked.
Before he could pick it up, Finney said, "Now don't get tetchy, Twig. I already armed it. Did it when you looked out the window. Go up two levels and through the hatch with the blue markings. You've got thirty minutes before all power in the place goes." He grinned. "Before everything goes."
John's father had died during a play about Surak. Logical arguments felt like a limb that was out of joint.
It had taken Sherlock some time hacking into Memory Alpha to even determine the existence of a world like this. But knowing that there were wormhole aliens who existed outside of time and that it was possible to travel through time – if inexactly – through the cold start of a warp core while moving rapidly around a star, and that the Breen had developed their own form of this technology, then it was probable that Starfleet had encountered time travel before. It was simply a matter of breaking into the records that documented the encounter.
"Oh, please!" said Connor, crossing his arms. "It was kidnapping, not fate. You're…" he frowned, "a giant arse. Tit. Prick."
He would not be distracted. She was trying to distract him. "You continued to look for information about your relatives."
"Is the answer to what you've always wanted, but…" Culverton smiled, "if I help you, I'll want a little favor later."
In any case, the various fleets had applied enough pressure to carve the heart out of the Federation, which had struggled on much reduced in territory.
Chin walked through the ornamental garden and over the ornamental river rushing below the cliff on which the palace had been perched and looked at the beautiful sky above. The entire thing was a hologram. Populated with holographic servants to teach and serve any need Sherlock might have had. A massive expenditure of energy when all their parents needed to have done was bring Sherlock home to the real thing.
The omega said, "Yeah, I woke up in the hallway in front of a door. Connor was in the rooms inside. As to me, I've been going by G." The omega held up their arm revealing a black and gold tattoo. It read GR3ND3L-12.2. Followed by the playful image of a monstrous creature smelling a flower. "Connor has a tattoo on their arm too, but it doesn't look like mine. Do you have tattoos?"
"Connor! I am your mother," Billy was genuinely shocked. Connor had never spoken to him like that. "Whatever you may think of Chin, you're not allowed to talk about my relationships that way."
It led them straight down into the bowels of the facility. A dark and dry space that was most certainly not an entry into the asylum.
"I don't know, honey. We covered a lot of ground since they got here. Reinventing distillation, pickling, some basic architecture, agriculture, medicine, and…" Sarabeth waggled her eyebrows, "sausage making. Such big thick hard sausages."
Pale terror filed Bihr's lungs and must be draining her skin of color. Watson held her wrist tighter, which was good or she might have fallen.
"I was afraid of that," said Hudson, still not moving from where she was lying on her bunk. "I don't have the resources I once did."
Elim Garak could read the signs as well as any. Better it would seem than the current counsel running Cardassia getting into bed with the Dominion.
"Interesting that he's married to…" Pavan leaned over to one of their aides and whispered for a moment. "Prince William. Captain Sherlock. The Alpha. When you lost track of him that was a serious blow."
"Then you will need to wait to talk to Billy," said Sherlock who did not have the patience for this. Not now that John was finally near him again. Now that John's hand was in his. The oils his body were producing as a result of things Sherlock shied away from thinking about adding additional comfort to the comfort John's presence always brought. He said, "Do something useful and imprison these Ferengi for kidnapping, trafficking in sentient beings, and attempted murder based on intergalactic statute. Round up the Klingons who are high on sex pollen while you're at it."
John's mother stood motionless on the stage. She dropped like a sand bag whose rope had been cut next to John's father. John held her. Cousins gathered around them.
Sherlock woke laughing. Lay sprawled on his alpha, dried cum on his thighs, and said, "These aliens have been without human adoration for thousands of years. They must have some other source of energy. We just need to find it." Peppered his alpha with kisses as he spoke.
She bared her teeth and slowly pulled her arms up. She had a phaser in her right hand. "Better idea."
He put his gravity well gaze back on her. "When you have sufficient background to understand it, we will discuss. Now if you don't mind, I am working on turning you all back into adults."
"Then we'll figure something out. Sorry, I should have called ahead. Warned you. I just," she clutched the tray in her arms, "I wasn't thinking straight. Go take care of Eva." She blew out a breath. "We can talk tomorrow morning."
As suddenly as the storm of weeping had come, it subsided. Leaving John feeling worn out and empty. Light headed, almost as if he was floating. He whispered into Sherlock's chest, too embarrassed to face him. A quote by F. Scott Fitzgerald seemed to work, so he whispered, "Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness."
Mummy stood behind him. Mycroft was certain that their condemnation for Mycroft's failure to control the situation was thick in their silence. Censure at Mycroft's inability to manage events in each drip of the IV. Maternal reproof that he hadn't kept his siblings safe accompanied the beep of the equipment.
John felt a dizzy wave prickle from his head and down to his toes. He swallowed. "What… what do you mean?"
"We wouldn't be together on the same ship," said John. "I want to have mad adventures with you. Not," he forced out the words, "be some sort of a captain."
Which was very sweet of Sarabeth and exactly how Mollyhoo felt, other than the part where she missed flush toilets and electric lights and everything. But there was something she just didn't quite understand. "Our estrus cycle should still be, you know… going on. There are down cycles in hormonal production that allow for greater cognition, but still there. Instead I feel normal. Pericardium. Enzymes. Vascular. I can think just fine, and I feel great." She looked over at where Vesha and Marida were already exhibiting signs that their next estrus cycle was beginning.
Harry dove forward, grabbing it. "Banquo's ghost." She aimed at Sh'Alaack, but their father jumped in the path of the blast.
John didn't repeat the statistics for successful childbirth among Augments. Most Augments knew them. John asked, "Will you want to put in for a transfer to a starbase?"
Not a single one of all the Breen doctors in the last year had betrayed the slightest understanding of what it was like to go into heat, much less the overwhelming constant metabolic change of juvenile heat in a mind and body too young to deal with it.
"Yeah, but still. You had a neuropathic illness that was killing you. Now your immune system is in the ninetieth percentiles of Human norm. What happened?" He threw in the plausible lie. "If there's a possibility that something in Augment physiology could help people, I want to know."
Grinned at Sherlock as he came out of the lift. Sherlock's eyes widened as he looked at him. Even after several months, somehow surprised that John loved him.
Because as she learned shortly after joining the crew, Sherlock knew exactly how to travel back in time. Had discovered a method one week into his command of the Bakerstreet.
"You always say that," whispered John. Who pulled himself up to examine the bio computer and his own results. Now that John knew what worked based on his own blood workup, John was easily able to manufacture a cure. Cho didn’t lose consciousness with her dose of the cure. Miri, pleading for forgiveness from John, had it even easier.
"Amazing." So there was. The word Connor was written on a strip of gold metal on the child's wrist. He smiled at the whimsy at the linking small gold flowers that made up the band.
Sherlock had already gotten into the available records by the time they arrived at 346. John did a quick examination of Sherlock's exposed skin. Donovan's too for that matter. No lesions. However this disease worked, Sherlock and Donovan's immune systems had sent the disease packing, but it was making short work of John and Cho.
"Finney, I presume," said Sherlock examining the old man. His appearance betrayed little more than that he was a resident of the penal colony and had been living in the relay station for several months without bathing facilities.
She didn't want to talk about what was going on. She did have a question that she should have asked years ago. "Did you really not know I'd go into micro-heat after giving birth to Eva?"
Technically, he'd used it that morning too. Since a direct approach wasn't working with Sherlock, he'd figure maybe a scenario would work. After all, scenarios had played a big role in their relationship over the last nine years.
"You don't even know," said Chin Singh. "You don't even realize." Which was irrelevant, because in moments, Sherlock was released and John had beamed on to the bridge. His lips found his husband's, and they were tasting each other and breathing the air from each other's lungs and everything was perfect.
Sherlock stood on the inside of it. His safe comforting scent surrounded John before his body wrapped around John's.
Jacqui pointed at a rather cheery mural of a droll black hound dog with a lolling red tongue and sparkling blue eyes on a green field with white sheep grazing in the distance. "Some of the inmates refer to him the Hound. If you end up going over to Baskerville, and you will if there's a disturbance, take the time to talk to old Finney. He's been here since the place was built and knows every story."
It was a little weird watching a vid with the twin's dad telling them that Andor had been focused on replicators and none of the farmers had really been prepared to have to cut back on replicator produced food. But with the war needing all the energy they could spare for the industrial replicators at the shipyards, the fastest thing the government could put on the market was nutrient enriched algae.
"Obvious," said the alpha, before the omega could answer. "There's a bracelet on the child's wrist with their name written on it."
Billy took the knitting needle from Connor's hand. "You're right." If they were going to be safe, they'd have to fight for it.
"Billy," said Soo-Lin coming the other way down the hall. "I wanted to see you before I left." She had a soft smile on her face. It was a kind smile that went all the way into her eyes. The kind of smile his father used to give. "Remember what I've told you. If anything happens, go to Beta Aurigae. It's an unaligned world on the border with the Breen Confederacy and has a large population of Augments. You and Connor will be safe there."
Sherlock kept his eyes determinedly open as he knotted, but it was not easy. Not as he came. Not as they spent twenty minutes simply pulling and moving and gazing into each other.
Finally, they reached the entry bay to the asylum and penal colony, and were transferred inside the dome of the facility. The inward curve of the dome was an egg shell blue. Green grass gently rustled on a slightly sloping hillside to what looked like some sort of quaint village from a historical vid. As he understood it, every night the dome sky dimmed into a brilliant sunset and then a simulation of the local night sky.
Yao went to a small monitor and typed rapidly. "This says that the cryo chambers are on aisle forty-three, shelf C, positions 6775 to 6998." She typed a few more controls. "I'll stay here and look through the access records to see if I can find anything else."
Sherlock looked at John. Waiting. He wanted to know how John could make this right. Sherlock had known how to be clever once, but John had always been Sherlock's light.
The secret wasn't to slip something into the tea. Any idiot thought to look for an additive to tea. For some reason they never thought to check the cup.
Hudson correctly interpreted that, because she said, "We've traced the ion trail from the ship to the Sigma Draconis system. There are three M class planets there."
Sherlock grumbled and John splashed Mollyhoo. She should only stay if she wasn't going to upset Sherlock.
Moriarty smiled genially. Falsely. "I know you're rightly upset. Rightly. But maybe we should wait until we reach Bencia. An explosive accident at a drunken wake on a moonlit beach will be a bit more likely than everyone on the ship died of being spaced except the two of us. Or you don't you want to keep your nice new ship. The nice new trade up of a body."
In a smooth motion, ringed Watson palmed a phaser from somewhere, and even as she was preparing to rush him, he shot Frankland.
The pregnancy after Victorious had reunited them after Mummy, having cruelly brought John home and let Sherlock love him had then taken him away again, saying Sherlock that was weak and out of control and he wasn't taking good care of his John by breeding John so often and that if he wasn't stopped he'd keep doing so until John died and Mummy was doing what was best for Sherlock in the long run and Sherlock simply had to accept that.
"And then," Thil swooped his left hand currently representing the Bakerstreet, "Captain Holmes will reverse the polarity on the engines. His left hand then made what must be a devastating attack on his right hand, because he made exploding noises and wiggled the fingers.
"Please, we've discussed this," said Veema. "We know Sarpeidon sent other Augments into the past, but…" They looked at John, "John is our first mother." They tapped a control. "And there's confirmation in our most ancient cave paintings." A monitor showed a cave painting showing star coordinates, the Atavachron and the Bakerstreet. There was also a pretty good likeness of John and Sherlock. Even if Sherlock looked like his cock was the size of his torso and John was a good deal rounder than normal.
In the recording, the Breen asked about the Khans. John recited a brief precis of the history of Earth's augments. The Eugenics wars. As might be predicted, he’d thrown in a reference to the Lady of the Flowers and the Analyst. His own interjections with details where John overly romanticized events. The other John wrapped up by saying, "Main question is, what is the Stardate?"
"And what truth did he tell you to escape from being tortured. Because it's not as if there haven't been centuries of data on how people will tell you anything under torture to get you to stop." John would have liked to have leaned back in his chair, but the force bonds made that a little hard. "I'm a doctor. I could send you some great journal articles on the subject."
Even the sounds of the colony were different. There was no engine hum. No little chirps and beeps that was the ship saying, "It's fine. You're fine. I'm fine."
A note appeared on John's parchment. "Sorry, Professor Holmes is riding you so hard." Tadpole looked him from across the potions desk. He looked so young to John.
With a defined problem, John focused on reducing the ways the anyone could get into the valley. A few well-placed brick walls once they figured out bricks and mortar. Stakes. He only managed one pit trap. Even with plenty of food from Sherlock's and his hunting, they were too hard to dig and consumed too many calories that could be spent making more complicated things than a hole in the ground.
When they were done, the sun finally set with a flash of green on the horizon. There was time to cuddle Sherlock against his front, before Vesuvius belched fire. It was slightly disconcerting to be snatched up in arms that didn't look strong enough to hold him and yet be held. Sherlock jumped from the second story of the building and ran for the sea. Behind them there was the smell of Sulphur, and John really hoped nothing had gone wrong with the safety controls, because he didn't like the idea of dying on Sherlock's birthday.
Some nights John didn't. A delicious pleasure when John rode Sherlock's cock long past when second sleep should have begun. A delight when Sherlock crouched between John's thighs and demonstrated his love with hands and lips and all of him. Always all of himself.
Sherlock's ached to think that John, before Sherlock had even known him, had been hurt by a lack of information. When it would seem that one of the few people in the Federation, who knew about the condition existed, was now married to John. Loved John.
He didn't. He thought they'd met at a conference. He said he'd deleted her. He huffed. Flung himself in and out of his seat. Stood by the fireplace. Stood on the table.
John exchanged a glance with Lucy. She nodded wearily at him. He could just make out the shift in her scent through his own. They were both in pseudoheat. The years long process where the Rybo-Viroxic-Nucleic acid in their DNA did the work of telling their systems to mature into adulthood, and which mimicked many of the physical symptoms of heat.
John poked his head out of the closet. There was a male Klingon declaring his love in iambic pentameter to a female Klingon. The female said, "I need rocks to throw at you."
Maybe he wasn't expecting John to laugh in his face and say, "You are so fucked. I already sent the readings from the site where Schmitter was killed to Sherlock. He's already figuring this out."
"I do," said Killander. They all stood somewhat awkwardly about, until Killander said, "Dismissed." Everyone but Hudson left the ready room.
Eva bit her lip. "I overheard Mommy talking with Sestre's dad. Stonn said the thing is… made of rocks. Actually, I think Connor is right." She scooted her chair closer and took Connor's hand. It always amazed Sestre how casually other lifeforms touched. But then, they weren't in danger of losing themselves in another person's mind through tactile contact.
Sherlock could not fail to observe that after John spent the early evening hours searching, John had Sherlock's body lie down on his bed with him and hold John in a simulacrum of sleep.
Grendel sipped his celebratory glass of champagne. They were all celebrating Connor's first day at school.
It was why he'd joined this expedition. There was parallel evolution all over the galaxy. Humanoid evolution. Human evolution. Galaxy trying over and over to make Humans.
Swirling thoughts broken up by Sherlock saying, "I cannot accompany you to the planet. Something came up on the ship. Are you sure that is not a problem?" If he was repeating himself, John must look as nervous as he felt.
He lost consciousness. Swam into view to see Sh'Alaack repeating something. John blinked. "Doctor Watson, what do I do?"
Of course, on the days John woke up alone, he generally went back to their cabin for a refreshing nap in the middle of the day. On those occasions, Sherlock also returned to their quarters less for a refreshing nap than to rip off John's clothes, throw John onto their marital bed, and fuck him practically through the mattress. Unless, John got there first and was already naked, which really only changed the part where his clothes were ripped off.
Hudson took one look at John as he sat down and got started immediately. "We're being called in to provide assistance investigating some issues on the mining colony on Janus VI."
Eva missed her mommy. She loved Daddy. He read her Eva's favorite story about Lighta, a lightbulb, who was worried that no one ever saw her when she shown her light on foggy nights, and her best friend, Chaira, who was a chair and kept her company in her tower by the sea. But then a Queen, Hearta, and her heart, Queena, on their ship with golden sails got lost in the fog and the lightbulb turned on at the top of a tower and guided the Queen and her heart home to a safe harbor, but he didn't read it like Mommy did.
When John arrived, he reached out with hand unit 455 and brushed John's hair. He was aware of the touch through the senor pads. It was a distant awareness. Lacking the tactile expression of a fingertip. Yet, there was a distinct sense of warmth in being able to feel – even if in a very different way – John's skin.
John ended up replicating Pad Thai for dinner. Sherlock, the berk, picked at it, until John shouted at him to eat it, because he knew that Sherlock hadn't eaten anything while he'd been away. Probably hadn't slept either. Refused to take care of himself.
Sherlock slipped pseudopod 400 around John's cock. Its actual purpose was removing excess water. Sherlock had been experimenting at levels of suction that could be applied. He applied less than one tenth of the lowest level of pressure. John was delicate. John was embodied. Everything was about how best to elicit moans and pleasured cries from his embodied partner. His lightning rod. His conductor of light.
"Fact, the Breen are taking egregious advantage of their treaty with the Federation to move into less than productive or abandoned mining facilities throughout the Federation."
"Why are you so obsessed with Khan?" Worth asking. He had to admit that Killander, who leaked information like a sieve for an intelligence officer, made a fairly compelling argument for Khan as alive and well, and off somewhere not bothering Earth.
"Cray-cray," Owen grinned. "That's the luck. Melas is at odd bits on account of a warship not needing a genetics team. Five seconds after he offered to teach a course on Augment genetics at Mare of Serenity University, he had a gig. We figured we'd get digs together off base. Watch out for each others' kid. Pretty much as we've been doing."
Sherlock felt very tired. Probably a side result of the sedation. "Please, take me to John. I need to talk to him. Then let me go back to at least help our children."
When he saw Doctor Watson's call for participants in a genome-wide-association-study, he knew immediately he had what he needed. It was all there written out. A request for participants in a study to identify a trait in the general population resulting from a specific set of genes passed on by three of the original British Augments. A three that might include Khan Brittanus. Those participants that matched a specific set of genetic markers, helpfully provided with the study, would be asked to provide phenotypic information about their behavior between the ages of thirteen to sixteen. Well, okay, technically, it's a PheWAS. i.e., he knows a trait, and is trying to map the genes associated with it, but I'll stick with spelling out GWAS in when talking about the study. Yes, the study will keep coming up. This, like Lucy's study was for her, a career defining project for John.
"Only when faced with someone as absurdly wonderful as you." John sipped another mouthful of wine, and made a cup of Sherlock's mouth. They drank from each other. "You intoxicate me."
"Captain, there was a fluctuation in their mass during transportation, as if the transporter was trying to compensate for something," said McCarthy.
Bihr opened her mouth to protest that this was precisely the reason the phase adjuster had been added to the transporter when she was dematerialized with the answering warmth of materialization. The transporter facility off of the Freedom Plaza in the Andorian capital briefly flickered into focus, before stuttering.
As it was, Mollyhoo was a little sorry that her own alpha daughter by Sherlock was scouting for Fenisal incursions. Zarabeth often became restless at the physical restrictions they had to place on alphas if there were any pregnant omegas in the settlement.
