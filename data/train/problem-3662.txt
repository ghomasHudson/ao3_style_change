The instant he stepped out of the bathroom, however, his plan was derailed. He wasn't gay, by any means. He loved women. But he wasn't the type of guy who couldn't admit when another dude was attractive. The actor who played Dr. Sexy, for instance. Gunner Lawless wasn't bad to look at either. Nor was the soldier he had spotted on the case with Chronos, and he'd be lying if Aaron Bass hadn't made him a little flustered. And Cas...
Donna and Jody cast their eyes on Dean then, but he couldn't take his eyes off Cas. He just saved Crowley's life. Cas just saved a demon's life. Someone he obviously didn't like. Why? Dean had no idea the effects of holy water on demons from Crowley and Aziraphale's world, but Cas did (he and Aziraphale must have discussed it) and he still saved him. "Cas..."
"No problem at all." Aziraphale beamed. "Your library is quite extraordinary. I'm looking forward to exploring all the information it has to offer. Though I am rather curious as to why a good majority of them smell like petrol."
Caring about ourselves
The shadow staggered back, pulling the blade out with black ooze seeping out of the wound, dripping down its hand, as Cas swooped Dean the rest of the way off the floor and hurried him down the hall. Dean nursed his left shoulder as the two of them staggered into the archive room, slamming the door shut behind them. Castiel locked it before turning on Dean, tears in his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
An attempt to open a rift is made.
Dean had always had a way of charming people into falling for him. He didn't even have to try. It was like a second nature to him. When it came to Dean feeling the same way for them, however... Sam couldn't help but feel sorry for Cas. His pity began to outshine all the other things he was feeling towards the angel at that point. He couldn't even begin to imagine how much it must hurt to love someone who could never love you back. Sure, Dean cared about the guy. Cas was the best friend he had ever had. Even after all the lies and deceit, Dean always stood by his side. He had never seen his brother grown so attached to another person that wasn't already family. He loved Bobby course, and Jody, Donna, the girls, and everyone they had adopted as their own over the years, but Cas....it was like he put the guy on a pedestal. To a point where it had almost become harmful to their friendship. He expected more out of Cas than anyone else, even though he had hurt them more than anyone else had. Dean always took it harder when something when wrong, but he was always quick to forgive the guy, even if he didn't tell him. He had more faith in Cas than he did in anything else.
"Don't get too excited." Crowley grumbled, licking the last of his Creme Brule from his lips. "Aziraphale just loves food in general. I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you." He winked.
Aziraphale’s face lit up at the mention of food and Crowley raised his hand to snap his fingers. "On it." He said before Dean reached out and grabbed his wrist.
"Okay, okay" Marie laughed " It's not funny. We get it. Now let's calm down. People are going to start showing up any second. Let's go do a once-over and make sure everything is in place."
Sam shook his head. Now was as good as time as ever to get everything out in the open. It would probably be the only time. If they did manage to get Dean back, it was going to be balls to the wall trying to find a way to fix the world and there definitely wasn't gonna be anytime to have a heart-to-heart about what he had been so blind to for so long. “Cas...
Dean was in hell.
It was dark. Pitch black. Quiet. The air was neither cold, nor was it warm. It was just there. He tried in vain, to open his eyes, to blink, searching for light, only to realize that it was impossible. His eyes were already open, there was just no light to be found. He took a breath, but it lacked the relief of cold air entering his lungs. He sat up, scrambling for purchase, for something around him to grab onto, for something to ground him, something to touch. Anything. But it was pointless, because the everything around him was empty
"You mean to tell us, you never owned a pair of PJs?" Dean scoffed. Cas just shook his head again. "What the hell did you sleep in when you were human then?" Cas's mouth opened to say something, but instead he just dropped his head and looked back over at the clothes on the couch.
Cas gave him an annoyed glare as he settled his coat over his shoulders. "Well I was also trying to pass the time. I've been stuck in here for too long. Besides," he leaned over to pop the tape out of the deck and place it back into its case, " not every problem can be solved with powers, Crowley." He ran his hand over the words on the case before sliding it into his pocket.
Dean stopped a few steps from the bottom. Guilt was coursing through his veins like ice. Cas wasn't wrong. He had done everything for Dean and everyone knew it. "Cas.... I'm sorry man... I didn't think..."
"I thought you were omnipotent, Charles." Rowena said, stepping forward. "You would have known what Castiel was going to do. Why come for him now instead of before?"
"Alright, then." Sam agreed, unable to fight the smile he felt on his face at seeing his brother and his best friend truly happy for the first time. "Looks like we've got work to do."
"I'm still pretty pissed at you too." Dean said, looking Cas in the eye. "But I ain't running away this time if you don’t."
Cas relaxes, marginally. There wasn't anything to fear, really. It's not like he could get any deader, but coming face to face with Death herself, well, that would set anyone on edge. "How am I awake right now? Jack and Gabriel? What is it that you want from us?"
“Right.” Aziraphale nodded. “The Nephilim.”
Cas fixed him with an unamused glare of his own. "Unfortunately, God did not see it fit to gift the angels of this world with the ability to taste and enjoy food, since we do not require it as sustenance. It all tastes of molecules to me, and since I did not get the opportunity to taste Dean's cooking in my time as a human, I have no opinion about it one way or the other. However, I am certain that he is quite masterful at it, as he is with most things that require him to use his hands, therefore I'm sure that the meal was good, as every else has suggested." The tension in the room grew stronger with each clipped word that left the angel's mouth.
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
"Then why are you telling me?" Cas asked.
“A paradox.” Dean laughed.
“Dean!” Aziraphale gasps as the plate shatters on the floor and Crowley begins laughing.
Dean shook his head and stuck his hand out. “Look, I appreciate everything you guys are trying to do, but I don't need all that. Really, I'm fine.”
so this chapter is...alot...
"It suits you." Cas nodded.
“Care to elaborate?” Crowley replied at the same time Aziraphale asked “What's the bad news?”
Crowley and Aziraphale shared a look, before the angel turned to Dean. " Dean, you really ought to know that he..."
"No." Crowley whispered, his eyes turning from full to haunted. "We will go home, and you will bring me holy water and...."
“So, you just scoured the entire earth to search for Dean?” Sam scoffed, looking up at his friend. Cas's face was tired. His eyes were blood shot, the bags underneath dark. His face was sunken and pale. For the first time since Sam had known him, he truly looked centuries old. “How bad is it out there Cas?” He asked. He wasn't sure he actually wanted an answer, but the smallest part of him wanted to believe that, maybe, there was still hope.
"Yeah, yeah," she dismissed, with a wave of her hand. "Daddy threw a tantrum and you want to knock him down a few pegs. You can explain the details later, but first...." She slid around Cas and began circling Jack,
Jack placed his hand on Castiel's shoulder. Cas turned to look him in the eye. "I know." Jack said, a sympathetic smile crossing his face. "But it's time we leave them alone. They deserve to be free now." Cas nodded his solemn agreement. "C'mon. We have work to do." Cas nodded again, sparing one last glance towards the barn door before leaving the Winchesters behind.
Dean nodded back and threw her into gear, speeding off down the road. The first place they went was his parents place, after asking Cas for directions. Mary flew out of the house (his old house) before Dean could even put the car in park. He got out, and raced to meet his mother, picking her up and swinging her around in a circle. He heard the car door shut at the same time he saw John approach Castiel, the two of them sharing a few short words of introduction, but they would both have to wait. Mary grabbed Dean's face and kissed his forehead, crying about how much she missed him. They talked for a while, about everything that happened after she died, everything with Jack and Chuck. He told her about his final hunt and getting a Job, what Sam and Eileen had done with the bunker, the baby. He felt a small twinge of sadness explaining how he was on his way to meet his nephew when he ended up here. Mary shushed him and hugged him again, telling him that it wasn't his fault. Before he could respond that he knew, that sometimes accidents just happen accidentally, Mary had stepped back and began rushing toward Cas.
"No." Dean said quietly, cutting him off. "That's not what I mean." He set his glass down and sat up, still facing away from his brother as Sam waited quietly for him to continue. "I, uh…" he coughed, struggling to get his words out. "I got a real job. A paying one. Nine to five, 401k, the whole nine. I applied for a contractor position last week after...everything, and I..I got it. Paper work's on my desk, waiting to be sent in."
He was right. They could sit there for days and go over every book in at their disposal ten times and still come up with nothing. Amara was the only surefire way they had any hope. "Dean's gonna hate this." He groaned.
All you got to do is move🎶
“I know.” Adam said, looking down as he shuffled his feet. “But I couldn't help it. A great, big portal to another world right in front of me? I had to see it.” He lifted his head and looked around a bit before settling back on Dean. “It’s a little messy you know. My mother would have a fit if I were to let my room get like this.”
"Yes, because Satan knows you need a larger head." Crowley rolled his eyes, before turning his attention to Cas with a mischievous glare. "What about you Castiel? You've hardly touched a bite. Do you not think as highly of Dean's cooking as the others?"
“No, really.” Crowley argued. “If you open up a dictionary and look up the word, I'm fairly certain there would just be a picture of you with the caption 'Avoid at All Costs' in bright red letters!”
It was Crowley's turn to blush, though he tried his best to hide it. "That was different." He said, turning back to face the angel with his tongue peeking out between his grin. "Everyone was doing it then."
Rowena walked to the wall and traced her fingers along the edge of the rift. “From what Dean told us, you were trying to open a portal at the same time that we were. As grand as it is that one of us succeed, there is no way of knowing which group it was. It's very possible that our combined efforts are what got us to this point. Unfortunately, that means it's nearly impossible to replicate the actions. Once this portal closes, we may not be able to open another.”
Dean gave him his best impression of Sam's puppy dog face "Forgive me?"
"Me?" The man scoffed, shaking his head. "Who said I was going to do anything. Them?" He smiled, throwing his hands out and gesturing around the room with his cane before replacing it to the ground. "Your forgotten children? They're the ones you need to be afraid of."
Sam shook his head in disbelief. “Jesus, Dean! What the hell did you get yourself into?”
"Hello, Dean."
"No, Sam's right, Dean." Cas's  voice was almost too quiet to hear. " I don't think this is something I wish to do. Saying such things feels...wrong...dishonest. They may work for you, but I don't  feel comfortable repeating such phrases. Sorry, I'm not as 'advanced' in the art of 'seduction' as you."
"Dean..." Cas rasped out in shock, and a sick warm feeling of relief flooded over Dean, but it was best if he ignored him for now.
She was right. He hadn't heard anything from King Douche in....since before they left for Flint. “Yeah,” Dean chuckled, scratching the back of his head “ yeah, I guess it has been a while hasn't it? My mind's kinda been other places lately.”
"How?"
Cas was silent for a long time. Dean could feel him fidgeting beside him, which only increased his worry, but he kept quiet. Finally, Cas drew in a deep breath and spoke. “ Jack's resurrection was not entirely as simple as I may have let you believe.” and there it was. Truth be told, Dean had kinda been waiting for the other shoe to drop on that one for a while. Nothing is ever that cut and dry. Not for them anyway. He waited in silence for the angel to continue. “When I went to Heaven to retrieve Jack's soul, the cosmic entity in charge of the Empty was there. It was... furious. It believed that, due to his angelic half, his soul belonged in the Empty. It wreaked havoc throughout Heaven to find him. It was determined to collect Jack's soul. I.... I couldn't let that happen, Dean.” His voice had become strained.
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Garth leaned down to match Sam's position and smirked, quirking his head slightly before he spoke. "Then I don't see what the problem is. You of all people should know that not all creatures are monsters, Sam. Hell, me and mine are a living testament of that. The way I see it, you got two guys that your brother trusts enough to bring around that are willing to help. I wouldn't look that gift horse too hard on the mouth, if I were you."
It's not like he could deny it. That's probably what her and Patience had been giggling about. So he could tack her onto the list of people who knew how pathetic he was. Might as well add Jody, Donna and Alex too. Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck.
He should be happy. Cas had been going crazy locked up like he was. He should be elated that his friend was able to get back out and fight the good fight, but he couldn't find it in himself to smile about it. At least when he was in his room, he was safe. He was here. Dean had almost lost his best friend, again. He had almost watched him die right in front of his eyes, again. He watched Cas put himself on the line for him, again. And now Cas was better. Fighting fit. Which meant, it was only a matter of time before he left to go fight a battle that was never really his. Again. Leaving Dean to wonder whether or not he would ever see him again. He knew it was selfish, but he wanted Cas to stay. Just this once. One time. As long as he was trapped in his room, he had no choice, but now...
🎶It's just an old friend, it's just an old friend🎶
“Dean.” He grunted. “Dean Winchester. I'd shake your hand, but I'm a little tied up at the moment.” He said, tilting his head behind him gesturing to the handcuffs.
"It won't be easy." Aziraphale sighed.
This...uh...this one got away from me.
Dean looked him in the eye, his own watery with tears that were threatening to spill, face filled with a million different emotions. "Crowley's been on this bullshit since I first said Cas's name. He won't let it go. I've had to run damage control since the moment I got back to keep him in line. He's a demon though. I expect that kinda shit from a demon. But you....shit Sam. "
“We care about you Cas.” Sam insisted. “You’re more than just a tool to us. You're family. I know we're shitty about showing it sometimes, but you gotta know by now that we do care. You mean a lot to us, man.” He swallowed hard trying his best to choose his words carefully, so not to set the guy off again. “You mean a lot to Dean.”
Crowley sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Oh, this is just going swimmingly, isn't it?” He said sarcastically.
"Cas...." Jack peered over at him with wide, worried eyes, having heard the call as well.
"You had us worried sick! We haven't heard from you since you left this morning! Haven't you ever heard of picking up a phone!" She scolded.
Rowena looked up gently closed the book, placing her hands, neatly, back on the cover. “ You're missing a large piece of the puzzle here, dearie. I'm merely just surprised it hasn't come to you yet.”
"Let go!" Dean barked trying to wiggle out from beneath the behemoth. "Sam, we gotta get Cas! We gotta get him out of there! Let go!" He managed only to wiggle one arm free, the other still effectively pinned beneath them on the ground. He used his free hand to pull at Sam's arm, trying to loosen his brother's grip. "Sam, please!" He cried out, fighting against him with all his strength. "I gotta get to Cas! We can't leave him again! Please!" He managed to free his other arm and began pulling himself across the ground, his fingers scraping across the gravel and dirt, blood seeping from his nail beds as the nails peeled away from his efforts to pull away. He managed only a couple inches before Sam heaved both of them back, sitting up on his knees, still holding tight.
“Well what are you doing here?” Adam asked.
Dean was snapped out of his thoughts by the sound of the waitress's voice. He swore he had heard it before.
"You heard me." Cas said, in a cold, ruthless tone. He stepped forward into Dean's space, his eyes calculated and dangerous. He hadn't looked like this since he backed Dean against Bobby's counter and threatened to throw him back in Hell. Dean wanted to retreat to run for the hills out of fear that the angel would snap his neck, but he couldn't. He was frozen as Cas moved his face not two inches from his own, his eyes and words burning holes into his soul. "Fuck. You."
"Cas. How bad is he?" Cas ignored him and finished with his healing, standing up and holding his hand out to Sam to help him up. "Cas, answer me!" He demanded brushing away the angel's hand. "Is Dean gonna die?!" It had to be bad. An entire team of angels working on him and Cas was avoiding the question.
I cursed the gloom that set upon us...🎶
“Dean...” Crowley said softly behind him.
“Hungry?” Crowley asked ask he sauntered further into the apartment. “Not that I really care, mind you, I just wouldn't want Aziraphale to throw a fit if I didn't, at least offer.
"I don't wanna do this without you Cas!" His voice was breaking and Castiel could care less. "I can't do this without you! I..."
"I will not." Aziraphale argued. " I'll miss them, terribly, and so will you.
"Well, like me and Sam always say, 'New life, new virtue.'" Dean watched  as a hint of realization crossed Cas's face, then he stood up and walked over to slap his hand on the angel's  shoulder. "So it's  settled. We're going out tonight!"
" I knew it!" Mary smiled. " I'm so happy for you boys!"
"Thanks, kid." Dean chuckled. "Aziraphale? You cool with hanging back and keeping an eye on everyone?"
“Keep focused, dearie.” Rowena encouraged. “Don't let the image out of your sight.”
"Alright, everyone" Marie announced "Now that the guests of honor are here, I would like to start this evening off with a special video Maeve and I have put together of the lovely couple. So if everyone would be so kind as to follow me into the home theater..." Marie swept through the crowd leading everyone down one of the long hallways.
Dean grunted and pointed a finger at Marie. "You created a monster! I hope you know that!" The other four burst into laughter and Dean was suddenly wishing he was anywhere  else. "It's not funny!"
Sam, looked over his shoulder at Rowena, who only shook her head in response. “Cas, man, we can't...”
“That was just fine.” Aziraphale said patting Dean's hand. “He sounds like quite the character, I can't wait to meet him.”
Speak to me only with your eyes
"It's fine, Cas." He huffed. "It's cool. We're good!" His eyes went back to Crowley, and he yanked the demon by the sleeve, pulling them farther out of the room. Cas watched them leave through narrow eyes, barely suppressing the growl that was growing in his chest.
The silence seemed to go on forever as Dean racked his brain on where to even begin. Then it came to him. "When I was 19 I was dating this chick. She made me try on this pair of silky pink panties. I didn't hate it." Silence. "I kissed a
"Morning fellas!" Dean chirped as he practically skipped down the stairs, Castiel close at his heels, obviously equally as cheerful.
Before Dean could open his mouth to respond, Crowley shot up in his chair and glared at the angel. “What do you mean ' leave it behind'?” Aziraphale turned his head slowly to look sheepishly over at the demon. “Oh, no! No, no, no! You can't seriously be suggesting...'
"Can I help you?" He muttered, peaking through one eye.
"Am I?" Dean sat up and leveled Aziraphale with a glare, and began counting on his fingers. " In case you haven't noticed, things are currently going to Hell. None of that would've happened if I would've just played my part like Chuck wanted me too, but my EGO wouldn't let me. I just told a fucking demon that I love my best friend, which you and I both know he isn't going to let go of that for shit! And Cas...." He paused, taking in a stuttering breath, letting his hands drop to his lap." Cas is just better off without me in his life. Even he knows that. That's why he left. That's why everyone always leaves. I thought Cas was different...he was different...but I screwed that up too...and now... Jesus! Now he gets to go off and be happy, 'cept he made that stupid fucking deal. He's gonna die. He's gonna die happy, away from me and it's all my fault."
All of them were frozen in fear.
Cas made a deal for his life.
Kaia stood dumbfounded for a moment, tying her best to understand why someone would put so much stock into a vehicle when Sam returned, holding out a stack of pictures to Rowena. "I found these in his desk. They're all he really has from our childhood. Think they'll be enough?”
Sam blew out a sharp breath and prepared himself to explain. "Well, nothing's ever come back from the empty before. Never. Nothing except Cas. The entity that runs the place was pretty pissed off when Cas woke up. It sent him back here, but I guess it couldn't rest even after he got rid of him. It got all vengeful I guess." He glanced up at the other two, making sure that they were grasping what he was saying before he continued. "When Jack... Lucifer's kid, died... we all took it pretty hard. The first time anyway. He was pretty much human at that point, I don't know if Dean explained Lucifer stealing his grace to you or anything..."
Sam let out a bitter scoff and pulled his hand back, squeezing both hands between his legs. "Yeah, Dean's always right, isn't he? Too bad he can't follow his own advice."
That was the line. Dean had said plenty of hurtful things to him over the years, but that..."Watch it, Dean." Castiel growled through gritted teeth.
Dean pushed back his chair and pulled himself up leaning over to give her a hug, followed quickly by Sam. "Thank you." Sam said as soon as both brothers let go.
The jury is no longer out on smut. It will be happening. I apologise if that upsets some people but honestly it was part of my plan in the first place.
"The hell you are!" Aziraphale snipped back, shocking everyone in the room.
Aziraphale smiled and nodded. “It's quite alright Dean, we understand. They're frightened, is all, and rightfully so. I wouldn't expect any less. After all, I believe my first meeting with you went much the same way. “
"Not like those fit you any better." Crowley scoffed as he meandered into the room. "You ought to try something a little more form fitting occasionally. Wearing the same drab clothes everyday just makes you look like some sort of cartoon." He picked idly at the scratches on the desk while he waited for the angel to respond. After no reply, he looked up to see Castiel had resumed reading his book, ignoring the demon completely. "Is there any particular reason your clothes needed to be cleaned anyway?" Nothing. Not even a grunt. "Why are you waiting for it do be done the human way anyway? I thought we had a discussion, just yesterday, about using the powers at your disposal."
There are several different types of love. The ancient Greeks broke it down into eight different categories. Agape, which is unconditional love. Eros; romantic love. Phila, which is affectionate love. Philautia, love of one's self. There is Storge (the love one feels for their family) and there is Pragma, which is enduring love. There is Ludus, which is defined as "playful love", though a better definition is desired. It is the type of love one feels in the beginning of a new relationship. The kind that causes butterflies in your stomach. And finally, there's Mania. Obsessive love.
"Oh, you betchya." She nodded. "Getting here was a little rough going, but the girls were able to hold their own. Claire's a real firecracker and Alex did a bang-up job of patchin everyone up when we got hurt. Patience's visions helped a lot, too. We were able to avoid most of the danger before it even came at us. Jodes is in the kitchen making dinner with 'em right now."
“Excuse me?” Cas replied. He actually had the nerve to sound offended, which only served to piss Sam off even more.
"What do you mean?" Dean said. "You've been doing a great job. I don't see any reason to...oh...yeah...huh. You probably want to go home now that everything is over...don't you?"
*****
"Certainly, a dangerous job for someone who's avoided confrontation for the past six thousand years." The angel mused.
“ I don't wanna get up.” Dean groaned, nuzzling deeper into Cas.
Dean's reaction to Cas's deal is expected, his confession is not.
"I'm serious!" Crowley protested.
" Oh, you're dead!" Dean said turning on Sam.
Sam just shook his head in response. For  such a good hunter, Dean could be so clueless sometimes.
But this was Cas. 'Angel of the Lord Castiel', as Marie had put it. Their bond wasn't exactly familial. Sure, he saw Cas as family, but it was different. He didn't know why, but it was. He guessed this must be what Sam felt like every time Dean did the same thing Cas was doing now, though Dean never went to the same extent as the angel.
"Was this back in Lucifer's tomb? With the angel tablet and what not?" Dean asked.
For the first time since the hallway, Crowley met Aziraphale’s eyes. They were filled with fear, regret, anger, sadness and tears. "We messed with his plans, Aziraphale. He knows our faces, he knows our weaknesses. He knows torture. It was the Lord who created Hell, we just ran it. 'For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment....' I can tell you, from firsthand experience that the Almighty does not take kindly to those who disobey him."
“Are you sure you want him back?” Kaia was barely holding back her laughter. They had to be messing with her.
“I only tried to shoot him because you told me to! Honestly, you make me sound like a monster.” Aziraphale pouted. “Besides, he's our only option right now.”
"Oh, really?" Check said sarcastically.
next up:............
"Okay!" Chuck laughed, pulling his hands out of his pockets and placing holding them out. "You know what Castiel? Shut up. Just shut up!" He said hysterically. "I've had enough of you, and your stupid little rebellious streak and your boring speeches of 'faith' and 'freewill' and your stupid, pointless resilience! I mean come on! I swear, you’re like a cockroach that just refuses to give up! It's over! You're not gonna win! None of you are!" He chucked glancing around the room. "I mean what's the plan here? Give me a few boo-boos? Weaken me? I got news for you! Wounds heal. You can't fight me forever! I. AM. GOD! I made all of this! If I want to destroy it I will! I've done it before and I'll do it again. You're not special! You're not unique! You're rough drafts. Scribbles on a page that I can change however I see fit!"
🎶what about love? Don't you want someone to care about you?🎶
"You better go make sure they don't kill each other." Jody grimaced, tilting her head towards the door. "I'll make sure everyone stays here and does what they're supposed to."
Cas closed his eyes tight and placed a hand on Sam's head. Sam felt himself fall backwards and Cas began waving his hands over Sam, his face scrunched up in concentration. "Your brother is in the infirmary right now. He sustained quite a few injuries in the blast. There is a team of healers working on him as we speak." He replied in a dead, business like tone, his eyes still shut tight.
"Garth, I told you NOT to come here!" Sam scolded as he lowered his gun.
"Awe, c'mon  Sammy! That's  half the fun!" Dean said in a mock whine
"It said it wanted me to suffer." Castiel interrupted. He paused, looking his son in the eyes, taking in every detail, sure this would be the last time he got the chance to do so. His strength had all but left him. Each day he had grown more and more human. He had been hungry over the past week. He had grown tired. This morning, he had woken up in the library, feeling only a flicker of his Grace, which meant that at some point, he had fallen asleep. That's when he knew. This was the end. "Everything has been going so well. For once, the plan has been falling into place without fail. I was foolish to think that meant I would see how everything played out. I thought, perhaps, I would be able to see my family happy for once. I was wrong. And for my ignorance, I will suffer."
“There it is.” Rowena smiled.
He had given his entire life to saving the world, and what did he get in return? Nothing. Everything was gone. The world was finally safe, it had to be if he was alive, and he had nothing to show for it.
“The girl is screaming now, too.” Adam said, his voice sounding a little scared. “Your brother is trying to stop them but the small woman won't let him. He's just flew across the room!” Dean tried his best to stay focused through the fear. He had to keep it together no matter what was happening. He had to make it home. Adam's free hand flew up and gripped the side of his head. “There’s a sound! A horrible sound! It's coming from the sad man! It hurts! I... I can't!”
Dean smiled as he reached up to brush an imaginary speck of dust from the angel's shoulder. “ It's a wedding Cas. You're supposed to look nice for weddings.”
“This is the driver's side!” Crowley explained. He gestured across the hood to the other side of the car. “That is the passenger side! This isn't America, Dean! Get your shit together!”
“ Whoa there, bird man.” She said holding up her hands. “ I'm still not fully recovered from the last time you decided to scoop me up and drop me somewhere.”
"I just... I didn't wanna lose him...I didn't... I wanted him to stay this time... I...what did I do?" Dean choked out, tears threatening to spill over his face.
Went up with a bottle and went down with the beer and
"No." Dean said, pushing back. "We're  not doing that. What did Jack mean. What aren't you telling us?"
Dean juggled the handle again. "C'mon Cas, let me in."
"Dean, I don't think..."
"The play you said Marie wrote?" Cas asked
"Alright, look, ya clowns!" Dean barked. " His name is Crowley, and he's a demon! He ain't like the king was but it seems to me like y'all are in need of some leadership. So here you are. New king. Winchester approved. Don't even have to change the monogrammed towels."
"Oh, Dean." Aziraphale answered for Crowley. "It's not that we haven't grown fond of you, all of you, it's just that...well we have lives back home, people, a business and we can't...."
Dean was knocked out of his thoughts when his back met a solid marble floor.
Kristen rolled her eyes and returned to Siobhan's side as they made their way through the crowd, thanking everyone for coming out to celebrate with them.
Dean shook his head and patted Cas's shoulder one last time before going to pack up his things. "You got this Cas. I trust you." He didn't turn around to see the angel's reaction to those words. It was a catch 22 at that point. If he had seen a look of skepticism on his face, it would have hurt to know that the angel didn't believe him. If he had seen extreme joy...well it probably would have made him feel worse that such simple words could bring that emotion out in his friend when trust should have been something that was a given, not a gift. So, instead he kept his eyes ahead, focus on the task at hand. They each finished packing, quickly, and split into their respective groups, packed up the cars and headed out.
Dean instantly regretted the statement. He liked the idea of seeing people move on after trauma like that, but suggesting future activities did nothing but give Sam hope that there was a future for all of them. It felt like lying. It was lying. He knew there wasn't a future for him. Just an eternity at the bottom of the ocean floor.
“You don't understand.” Crowley slurred back. “He's a Time Lord! The rules of time don't apply to him. And time isn't fluid anyway! It's all...” He tossed his hands in the air and started waving them around, tangling his fingers together trying to make circular motions. “... wibbly-wobbly!”
So, for the story line that has now magically appeared in my head, it was crucial for Sam to know about "The Deal" before Dean. Also, I know of the other way to open a rift. I will get there I promise. It all comes together! I swear!
"Finally!" Sam said, as he shoved past Dean on his way to the shower. "And you say I take forever!" Sam closed the door behind him leaving Dean and Cas to engage in a staring match.
"And if the Lord refuses to allow it?"
“It doesn't work like that.” Cas said.
Two days, waiting for any sign that Cas was gonna be okay.
"You left it on your charger." Jack offered. "You said it was 'family time. Not phone time'."
"You two need help." Dean  grumbled. "Serious, mental help."
"Nothing." Chuck snarled.
“ It's about Jack....” Cas said.
“He isn't here.” Cas said as he stormed past the other two.
"That's not...." Sam started, then shook his head. "We have some other things we have to talk about..."
" Coffee." Yhe three of the said in unison. She gave them a nod and told them she'd have it out for them in a jiffy.
"Jack…"
"Don't bother." Cas said, as soon as they turned the corner. "I heard enough." He tried his best to keep the hurt out of his voice as he stared the two of them down.
Thanks to you I'm much obliged
“Smooth.” Crowley murmured under his breath as he passed the angel his jacket. “Come on then Mr. Cobain. Let's go find you something a little less lumberjacky, shall we?” He walked passed and tapped Dean's shoulder, urging him up.
“It's true!” Dean insisted. “I’m from a totally different world.”
Cas smiled and shook his head. “ I suppose, to an outside party, that would seem pretty 'messed up'.” Dean put his head back down on the angel's chest, letting the last bit of his laughter die down. Cas extinguished the light in his hand and wrapped his arms around the hunter, placing another tender kiss on top of his head. “I'm sorry I'd didn't tell you about this before, Dean.”
Crowley stopped and pulled Aziraphale in front of him. He looked at him with a frown on his face and an eyebrow raised. "Would I have put the entirety of existence, everything that ever was, and everything that could ever be, at risk, just for the fraction of a chance that I might be able to save you?"
"He's in a better place, Sam." She said quietly as the embers started to fizzle out. It was a cliche thing to say, she knew, but it was all she could think of.
"The Shadow, the entity that watches over the Empty, it was upset that Jack had awoken me, it was furious with me for keeping it awake." Castiel explained. "It had gotten to Heaven before me. It was ripping the place apart to find hom, to take him to the Empty. It wanted revenge. I couldn't let it take him, Dean. Not when we needed him here. It was me that it was angry with. Not him. So, I offered myself in his stead."
“What, like some sort of cosmic Tupperware?” Dean scoffed.
"Well, howdy to you too, Sam." Garth replied as he pushed his wife and three other werewolves through the door ahead of him.
"Castiel?"
“Meaning, that if we are to get Dean back into this world, there will be no one to pray to if something happens to that car.” Rowena smirked.
“Dean.” Crowley said, a little louder.
Sam pinched the bridge of his nose and tried his best to keep his voice steady and calm. " Look, I'm not gonna even try to pretend to understand why, maybe it's your 'profound bond', or some weird soul melding or some shit when he pulled you out of hell, but..." It was a lie, at least half of one, "you're right. Amara has some weird, unbreakable spell on you, and nothing seems to be able to snap you out of it. Except Cas." He did know why it was Cas. He didn't understand then, but he knew now. "The only time you were able to pull yourself out of it, is when she took Lucifer while he was inside of Cas. She knows that too. It's why she used him to track you. She knows she can't get to you if you have Cas with you and we need her. I don't like it any more than you do, man but we don't have a choice."
*****
Dean took a steadying breath. He was grateful neither of the had mentioned the elephant in the room...yet...but he was still being cautious. " What are you even going to change into? A different tie? Super incognito there, pal."
"Did he now?" Dean said.
Cas just stared at her, mouth agape. He has no idea what to say. Was he supposed to deny that he had ulterior motives behind staying on Earth and renouncing his place in Heaven? He hardly knew this child. There was no reason to tell her lies. However, there was also no reason to tell her the absolute truth.
Dean pulled at his wrists. They were bound behind his back and judging by the metallic bite against his wrists, the hands cuffs we're real; too strong to be snapped without hurting himself. Whoever his kidnappers were, they were professional, and well-prepared. His reputation probably preceded him, though why they were playing dumb while they thought he was still passed out was beyond him. Maybe they knew he was just biding his time. Tricky bastards!
Dean rolled his eyes in response, then froze when he heard the bell announce the opening of the door.
"What about your happiness?" Sam asked. "You say you want me to find Eileen and make a life for myself. What about you?"
Dean shrunk back a little, looking to Sam for support. Cas, was his goofy, awkward, best friend, of course, but he was still terrifying as hell when he pulled out his ' Angel of the Lord' voice.
"A man-shaped angel." Dean pouted
“How did you manage that?”
“Gather your belongings, human!” Crowley grumbled. “You're staying with me tonight. JUST tonight!” He said holding up his finger to emphasize his point.
"How's he doing?"
So let's get cracking!
“I suppose you could call it that, yes.” Cas said calmly.
"I gave her back to you Dean." She pouted. "You gave me back my family, so I gave you back yours. It's hardly my fault you couldn't keep her alive. Isn't that right Castiel." She sneered in the angel's direction, causing him to curl up on himself slightly.
"See it's all settled." Dean said. "Darkness meet Nothing, Nothing meet Darkness. Perfect match."
"Jerk." Sam muttered.
Maeve stepped back from Dean and turned to Marie. "Well honestly, we all kinda thought you had lost it after you told us Dean had somehow gotten saved from being a demon. We didn't want to hurt your feelings, but we all kinda thought you were just in denial but...wait!" Maeve reached to the table and grabbed a small flask, whipping around and splashing the contents in Dean's face.
"I think everyone has a lot on their minds right now, Dean." Sam grunted.
The first part of the plan was simple enough. Castiel had shown Aziraphale the library, and while everyone else was sleeping the two of them spent the entire night burying their selves in lore. Aziraphale, more or less, trying to fill in the gaps of what Dean had already explained, while Cas studied over what he already knew and cross-referencing his knowledge with books containing various theories on each different subject (his main focus being on God). They had both come to the conclusion that their best bet in course of action, was to recruit both sides of the cosmic opposing forces to their cause first. Starting from the top and working their way down, so to speak. God could show up at any time. The world was close to shambles. With the powers of both Heaven and Hell on their side, they stood a fighting chance.
"Alright then, hun you have a nice day. You boys eat up now. Need all your strength to keep this country safe." They all nodded a "thanks" as she walked away.
"I am not a coward." He said bitterly as he flicked a hand out and tossed the witch aside, breaking three of her ribs as she flew into a tilted pillar behind her and toppled to the floor.
"I'm being serious!" Aziraphale tutted. " Do you ever feel like we've failed? By abandoning our posts, I mean. Sometimes I feel like I could have done so much more good in the world if I hadn't let myself be corrupted by it. Sometimes I feel like every bad thing that has happened since the garden is somehow my fault."
It was almost funny really.
If Sam had ever questioned why those two fell in love, his answer would have been in Dean's words at that moment. Because, though it was true, that all Castiel had ever wanted was to protect humanity, and do what was right by God, it wasn't just the angel Dean was talking about anymore. He closed the distance Dean had put between them and scooped his crying brother into his arms, squeezing him with everything he had as the broken man sobbed into his shoulder.
“Oh...” Adam said, looking slightly disappointed.
Thanks for the feedback 😊 more to come soon.
" You know, the fact that you know Sleeping Beauty's name is pretty gay, dude." Dean grunted, shoving past his brother on the way to the coffee.
Dean stared at him with wild eyes, panic and bile rising to his throat. "Is he...did I...?"
“We don't have time for your games, Rowena.” Cas replied coldly. “If you would prefer, I could take you back to that hotel that I found you in. Next to a grave yard. I'm sure you'll be perfectly safe there.”
The bunker had gone silent.
Cas took the clothes from his hand and stared up at him with watery eyes. "Thank you, Sam."
Dean got out and followed the demon inside and up the stairs. “So, what doya need a place like this for anyway?” Dean asked “I was pretty sure guys like you didn't really need homes.”
“Wait...huh?” Dean was totally confused. This guy made absolutely no sense. It was like talking to a damn maze. All twists and turns with no way out.
"And you scared me."
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling scars will remain.
Dean pulled a pack of sausage links from the fridge and dropped them into the pan, when Sam walked into the kitchen. “Morning, Sammy!” He said cheerfully as he cracked a few eggs into a bowl. “How's it hanging?”
"I am." Crowley choked. "I don't want to live knowing...."
"I'm not you or Dean." Cas said sharply.
"Reno, apparently." Sam scoffed. "Though, I wouldn't put it past him to have lied about that too. For all I know, he has her locked away again, somewhere."
"For one?" Sam huffed. "It still wouldn't be enough, and you know it! Even if it was, how would that make us any better than Chuck?"
I have to say I feel wildly untalented after the beautiful fic I just read....so I'mma try my best to up my game...can't make any promises...but I feel I must....next up: emotions!
"No!" Sam yelled. “It’s not an option."
"Right." Newt replied, moving his hand up and down well after the angel had let go, as he watched the two of them make their way towards the car that had appeared out of thin air, much like a lot of things had so far that morning.
"REALLY?! That's your takeaway? What would you call in then, huh?!"
“It would look rather suspicious if I were just wandering about all the time.” Crowley replied, without looking back. He reached the top of the stairs and took a left, pulling out a set of keys. “I’ve been here for a very long time, since Eden actually, I wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea. Besides that, I've grown accustomed to a human lifestyle. The simple things in life, as it were.” He unlocked the door and waved Dean inside, closing it behind them.
Dean nodded. " Look, I know everyone thinks that me being a dick yesterday saved him, but let's face facts. I'm always a dick. That's why he stayed. Because being here makes him unhappy. Me upping the ante didn't save him anymore than it does on a daily basis. I'm pretty sure it actually did the opposite. He's probably fucking sick of putting up with my shit. With the way things are going, I'm gonna be honest, I don't think any of us are getting out of this alive. He probably left to go out on his own terms. I don't know about angels, but I heard that dogs sometimes go off into the woods to die alone. Not that Cas is anything like a dog! It's just...he probably knew the only way for him to be happy was to get the fuck away from me...."
"Crowley, please?" Castiel sighed, hoping he wouldn't have to be reduced to begging.
"NOW!" He screamed, making the call.
"Sure it is!" Dean offered. "Look at the world around us right now. There's plenty to get upset about."
"As much as I am loath to admit it," Aziraphale explained, “given what we've seen as of late, I do believe it's safe to say that the Almighty might not be the best judge when it comes to what is good and what isn't."
"Yeah, yeah, no, it's fine!" Dean said pulling his sleeve over the bandage and sitting up in his bed. "Don't worry about it! What happened next?"
"Zira...." Crowley gasped.
“ Yes, can we get a water please.” Cas asked. “Someone over here got a little enthusiastic with his drinks.”
"You can go ahead and tell him that I'm not going anywhere until all of this is over." Cas said in a dead tone as he picked his book back up. "After that, he's all yours."
He clicked the pen closed and stood up, ready to defend his actions. "Okay, look you were right. I-I should laid low. I-I know." He said as Dean approached him."I should have hung back. I'm glad I was able.."
"It's a term of endearment, darling. I just meant, that everything is going to be alright. No need to get your feathers in a twist."
Oh. Oh, fuck. Is this what Cas felt like when Dean said that to him? Did he feel like someone had just ripped out his heart through his stomach, too? Probably not. Sure, he probably felt miserable, but he didn't deserve it then like Dean does now. That had to be what was making those words hurt so fucking bad. Or maybe it was having his own words thrown back in his face when all he wanted to do was make things better. Or maybe because...Cas stepped back then, turning away from Dean again and that's what made it worse. Cas hadn't been trying to beg forgiveness from the person he loved. He was trying to beg forgiveness from a friend and was denied it. So, yeah, Cas probably felt terrible when Dean said it to him, but at least he wasn't heartbroken. Dean wanted to yell. He wanted to tell Cas to go fuck himself. He just wanted to say he was sorry and Cas wouldn't let him....but then....he wouldn't have known to use those words if Dean hadn't done the same to him. So, did he even have the right to be angry? The answer was simple. No. Cas just gave him a taste of his own medicine...and it wasn't easy to swallow at all.
"Nobody said you were gay, Dean." Cas rolled his eyes.
"My name is Castiel." He said coldly.
"I love you, too, Dean." Cas chuckled.
*****
“Yeah, Cas and Dean are friends,” Sam mumbled “but I gotta be honest with you they haven't been on the best of terms lately. They've been more likely to kill each other than help each other out for a while now.”
“Oh...” Dean grimaced. He really thought he had it figured out with all the staring and what not. Now he just looked like an ass “Yeah... Sorry, I guess. I just assumed...”
" The fact that you knew who I was talking about doesn't say much for you either man." Sam snickered.
The woman came back, placing another glass in front of the angel. "Here you go, cutie!" She said flirtatiously, then leaned down putting  her lips close to his ear "This one's on the house."  She sauntered away again, putting on more of a show than before. The jealousy rose back up so quick it caught Dean by suprise. Maybe they shouldn't have done such a good job at cleaning Cas up? She sure was giving  him an awful lot of attention. More than Dean had gotten in a while. Yeah, Cas was a good looking dude, he guessed, damn good looking, if he was being completely honest with himself, but he had never seen anyone fawn over him this much. But hey, wasn't  that the point?
"You're really gonna start this shit now?" Dean said, a little bit of hurt spilling into his voice. "After everything we just went through?"
"Oh, that wasn't me!" Chuck said, excitedly.
"Nah," Dean said lifting up his arms and giving a spin. "Still intact."
Mary huffed a small laugh and shook her head. “ I asked him the same thing. You know what he said? He said they were all very human things. Things he never thought twice about before he met you.” She swallowed and met Dean's eye's with an unreadable look in her own. “He told me you were the first being he ever met that treated him as an equal. No better, no worse. He told me he 'found it incredibly frustrating and disrespectful at first', but then he said he found it to be the greatest gift anyone could ever receive. He told me he kept those things, so when he felt weak and helpless he could look back and remember that humanity is strength.” She paused and took a breath. “ He told me he keeps them as a reminder of what he fell for.”
“Why not?” Crowley shrugged.
"Aziraphale! Crowley!" She smiled in greeting, completely ignoring his panicked question once again. "I trust everything went well then?"
"In case what, Sam?!" Dean snapped. "God's gone, Meg's the new Devil, we got Gabe ruling the top floor with Jack making whatever monsters Cas didn't gank into new flyboys... as far as I'm concerned, we don’t got shit to worry about anymore!"
"I ain't repressed!"
“It wouldn't have worked anyway you know.”
"That's your problem, Dean. You don't think!" Cas was looming just three steps above Dean now and approaching fast, causing him to stumble backwards off the last couple of of steps and back himself into the room. "You don't talk! You just do! You just jump in, head first, without any consideration on the effects that it might have on the people around you!"
“Okay!” Sam snapped. “Alright can you just...look I'm glad you find the horrors we face on a day to day basis so 'fascinating' or whatever but can you read about all that like...over there or something. I'm a little busy here and I'm really not in the mood for conversation.”
"Ah, so everything worked out for those two as well then?" She asked smugly. "I had a feeling there might have been more to that relationship than he was letting on."
"Hey boys," Mary said cheerfully as she entered the bunker. "We're here!"
“I’m really a pretty simple guy.” Dean smiled, shaking his head.
“Don't like it?” Crowley asked in mock concerned, then added an aggressive “Tough.”
"What do you, think Dean?" Sam's voice snapped him out of his thoughts.
"Because I know you."
Dean kept shuffling backwards past the table, almost to the stairs. This was it. Cas was actually gonna kill him this time.
It was the last thing Cas wanted to hear, but it was what he needed to hear. The Winchester's never cared about him. They never loved him. He was their weapon. That was all.
"Then I'll go " Amara suggested. They all turned to look at her, shock on their faces and arguments on their tongues. " They can't kill me." She shrugged. "They have tried and failed before. As for capture, well I'd like to see them try. I can't hold too many souls without consuming them, but I can grab a few thousand and get out before being noticed."
"What if it doesn't work?!" Sam threw his hands in the air in anger. " We don't have time to come up with anything else! If she can't do this, we're screwed!"
"Nothing!" Dean shouted, still looking around. At least Dean tried to look concerned but he wasn't about to believe that he hadn't done anything to make Cas fly off again. "We were just talking and then he yelled at me to run and then he just fucking disappeared!"
"Like you were any help Dean!" Sam said from the floor. "At least the rest of us actually did something! We weren't locked away in our rooms crying like bitches!"
"Alright then," Garth smiled leaning back into his chair, "what's the game plan?"
"Dean." Cas groaned. "I promised I wouldn't let anything happen to you. You can't expect me to defend us against Amara if I have to spend days on the road, fighting our way through the chaos and healing whatever wounds we will receive." Dean merely pouted in response. Cas sighed and shook his head. "I'm going to go check on Claire and make sure she hasn't bullied her way into one of the other groups. We'll discuss our mode of travel later." And with that, he turned and made his way back to the war room.
"Are you alright?!" Aziraphale asked, stepping back into the demon's space.
Thanks again to all of you for being awesome, and sticking with me thus far! Coming soon, to a Fic near you: Secrets Revealed!
"Dean?" Cas jumped when he heard Dean's voice. It was odd because he was usually always acutely aware of the hunter's presence, which just further worried Dean and solidified his concern that he knew exactly what the topic of conversation was. "I thought you were asleep." Cas said, furrowing his brow in... confusion...anger... disappointment? It was hard to tell. "Your friend here seems to think you aren't a sufficient hunter." He turned to Crowley again and have him an annoyed look. " I was informing him otherwise. You and Sam have been doing this your whole lives. I believe that you would know exactly what you are supposed to do."
Cas looked up at him, confused. He almost looked like he was ready to retreat. To give up entirely. "What?" He asked.
“No, I didn't say that.” Dean defended. “I have mad respect for Freddie. He was a phenomenal musician. Way beyond his time. Just not really my style, ya know...” He shrugged. “Mind if I...” He asked gesturing towards the stereo system.
“But I bet Anathema would!” He smiled. “She's a witch, so she knows all about that kind of stuff!”
"Well what crawled up your butt today?" Jody asked., Placing herself in front of Sam in a protective, motherly manner. "You know as well as everyone else that, if those two aren't willing to work together, things are going to get dicey."
*****
" Sure is kid. " Dean chuckled. he grabbed a sponge off the edge of the sink and nodded his head toward the door. " Now go get, cleaned up and I'll see you in a bit, Kay?"  Jack gave him a single nod and March out of the kitchen, smiling ear to ear. Dean turned his attention to the little bit of dishes in the sink, completely unaware Cas had yet to leave the room, until the angel appeared next to him.
"Sam, what happened?"
"My skills have improved over the past year or so." Patience admitted. "Ever since I opened myself up to them, they've been getting stronger. I'm nowhere near where my grandmother was at my age, but yeah, I can kinda read thoughts now. Mostly just the unconscious ones, but all of yours are pretty loud." She smirked.
Sam was completely caught off guard. It had taken him how long to figure this out completely? And this guy comes in knowing it off the bat? “What makes you say that?”
"I don't  think that's any of your business, Dean." Cas said flatly
“Yeah.” Dean said, feeling a little bad about snapping for no reason. “Yeah. He never takes the damn thing off. It's like his little ugly security blanket or something.” Dean chuckled, suddenly feeling very home sick.
'A little grief?!' Dean thought to himself. It almost broke him out of the whole charade as soon as he heard those words. After all this time, Cas had to know how much he had meant to them. To him. Instead he shrugged. "Hey I get it man. Needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few right?" He turned to Bobby and gave him a little wink. Bobby shook his head and took a sip of his beer to hid his grin. Dean turned back to Cas fighting even harder to keep his face neutral.
"What makes you so sure that the guy won't turn on you the second he gets the chance?" Sam challenged.
"No!" Dean practically shouted, attracting the attention of a few patrons. There it was. Now he remembered why they never told Cas about this case. He made a point to scoot away from the curious Castiel and lowered his voice. "No. It's not a 'thing'! No 'thing'! You got that?!"
“No!” Cas's voice rang out across the library laced with enough power and rage to shake the room. He turned around, grace fading out of his eyes, before calming down enough to speak again. “ No, Sam. You don't. You don't understand a damn thing.”
"You created humans to feel." Aziraphale piped up, the shaking stopped as Chuck turned his attention to the angel. "You created them to grow, and learn, and love." He grabbed Crowley's hand and squeezed it tight.
IT ALL GOT WIPED OUT!
"I just had the most interesting conversation with young Marie outside." Cas's small smile turned into a full blown smirk.
Castiel's shout echoed through the halls, but he was nowhere to be seen. Dean felt a cold chill run through his veins as he choked out Cas's name, but no reply came. "Cas?" He called a little louder. Nothing. "CASTIEL?!" He whipped around, but the angel was nowhere in sight. "Sam?! SAMMY?!"
"You didn't though." The angel said firmly. "You may have created us, but we made life for ourselves!"
Aziraphale’s smile faded a bit and he walked over to the bed, sitting down on the edge. " Do you really think that we can help pull this off?"
"Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go pass the fuck out." Dean said. "Today's been crazy, and I'm ready to get back into my normal routine. Killing evil shit and saving the world."
Aziraphale wrapped the angel blade back up and walked up to Dean, placing his free hand on his shoulder, causing him to flinch slightly. The angel quickly and patted him instead. “Sorry, I didn't mean to...”
"I'm sorry." Crowley chuckled. "Am I missing something? Is it customary to douse your guests here, or is it just a hunter thing?"
“Wha...” Dean stared at him, baffled.
"Gabe's right." He said as he hobbled into the library.
"It isn't." The demon shrugged. " It's infinitely more dangerous, in fact, but...." The demon looked up then, his snake like eyes filled with moister. " It's bad out there, Aziraphale. It's a bloody shitstorm. Now, I've never been a fan of the Almighty myself, but even Lucifer couldn't dream up the horrors I witnessed out there. I should know. I lived in Hell. I saw his work, but what's out there....even the cruelest forms of torture couldn't hold a candle to it. Those people are devouring each other. Becoming monsters, killing each other off in hoards and he barely had to lift a finger to make it so. He isn't following some divine plan, he isn't teaching some great lesson or anything like that , he's just mad. In every sense of the word. He's gone absolutely mad. He's letting everything fall to pieces and he's not stopping it. Not ever."
Oh, this was gonna be fun.
“Maybe that's just what he wants you to think.” Rowena offered “Or perhaps, Dean doesn't even know how he feels.”
"Oh, I see." Dean scoffed. "So, rebuilding, Heaven was more important than letting your family know you were okay. Got it."
"Your boy toy keep any snacks in this rust bucket, of his?" Claire cut him off shuffling through the glove box.
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Be lap
“Because, young man,” Aziraphale added “we're the ones that stopped it.”
"Why have you decided to help is then, hmm?" Crowley asked. "From the way Dean tells it, you were more than willing to let us burn while the two of you danced in the flames."
She stared at him for a long time, realization coming to her slowly. "Oh, you've got to be kidding me!"
Dean marched off in the direction of the kitchen, Crowley following (a little too closely, in Cas's opinion) behind. He was trying. Dean seemed to trust these guys, so he was really trying. He tried to keep in mind what Aziraphale had said about Crowley being a good guy who got the short end of the stick. He was trying to accept that they were here to help them, even though they didn't have to. Cas was trying his absolute damnedest not to make a snap judgement about either of them. They had helped Dean, after all. Kept him safe, got him home. So, he was trying. But trying only got someone so far when they were already teetering on the edge.
"Maeve, is everything ready to be set out? Everyone will be arriving shortly."
“This will work, won't it?” Sam whispered down to her.
"Cas." Dean whispered. "Cas! Hey man are you alright? Cas! Earth to Castiel! You with us there buddy?" Dean tapped at the hand on his shoulder which finally got the angel's attention.
"Hurry along, Angel, we haven't much time." Crowley said, pulling Aziraphale along behind him.
"Look," Dean sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, "me? I can take it. I ain't gonna like it, but at least I have a sense of humor. Cas? He's been on edge for a while now and trust me, you do not want to be the one who pushes him over. He may not look like much, but.... the guy just lost his kid, okay? And I'm kinda responsible for that. We haven't really gotten the chance to talk things out and neither of us have really earned the 'buddy of the year' award here lately. I'm sure once we hash a few things out he'll be a little more welcoming, but I still wouldn't push it if I were you."
Mary nodded a soft smile and left the kitchen. Jack slurped down the rest of his milk and brought his bowl over to Dean. He leaned in like he had a secret but kept his voice at a normal level. " Thank you for not choosing the museum. Sam said it would be educational, but it didn't sound very fun. I didn't want to hurt his feelings."
Cas turned to look at Sam, his face twisted with a mix of horror and disgust. "Yes, well I'll grant you your brother has had it coming for some time. However, you could have waited to make such comments until the three of us were alone." Cas smiled back.
"Oh, my God! I am sorry you guys I just meant....really it's great to see you...just...h..how..why are you here?!'

Dean just shook his head. ".... Billie's book...."
Rowena's too? Had she gone after him as well? Did she die because of him too? Or had she found him in the wreckage and pulled him to safety?
"Really, Crowley!" Newt heard the angel scorn before shutting his door.
"No, Cas...no." Dean said trying to ease Cas's worry. He walked back over to the angel and slid his hands underneath the trenchcoat. He pulled Cas in close and closed his eyes, resting their foreheads together. "Look, I ain't gonna pretend that this isn't all new to me. I ain't gonna pretend like the gay comments don't get under my skin. I ain't even gonna pretend like I'm not still gonna flirt with other people from time to time. I've been this way my whole life and it's not like I have an off switch, ya know?" He opened his eyes and looked into Cas's. " But I'm also not gonna pretend like not in love with you. Not anymore. I've been doing that for way too long, I see that now, even if it just dawned on me yesterday."
There it was. The sliver of truth in all of Dean's lies. He would never take responsibility for his actions. Not when he had Castiel to blame. Those days were over now.
"So, you aren't denying it?"
"You know..." Aziraphale said, finishing off the rest of his tuna wrap. "Your brother talked at great lengths about you as well, in his time with us."
If you came here thinking this wasn't gonna go anywhere in terms of actual Destiel drama, I hate to break it to you, but you're wrong. Sorry, not sorry, but I promise it gets better than their regular " Cas Dean bitch fest" that goes no where.... you'll see.
"Gabriel?"
" Hate to break it to you, mom, but if skeeball is what your after, the only ass that's getting kicked is yours. I spent a lot of time in places like this growing up." Dean shrugged. He quickly glanced over the place again, hoping Mary would assume it was for emphasis, finding Cas a jack had moved on to some version of whack-a-mole. He hated that he felt relief at seeing Cas's expression turn to frustrated concentration, as he attempted to throw his hammer at the tiny creatures. This was going to take some getting used to.
"You're the bitch! Jerk!" Dean barked back.
She let of a small laugh as she made her way to the door. "You know me. You know the things I've done. I don't think I'm really in the position to be judging anybody."
“Fine.” Dean grumbled as he rolled out of the bed. “Party pooper.”
"I don't..."
"This is bigger than me, Dean. This is bigger than you." Cas said. Dean opened his mouth again to protest but Cas cut him off. " I know you're scared. You have every right to be. But we have to do this. If she is our only shot, then we have to take it. Whatever it takes. You taught me that."
"Crowley…are you sure this is what you want?" Aziraphale asked carefully.
“Oh, dear.” Aziraphale said, worrying the cord of his rotary. “Might it possible for you to tell me when he'll return.” He glanced over at Dean and Crowley, shaking his head in disappointment.
This thing has really gotten away from me. I have no idea what made me think I could keep it short. I currently have  like Nine more chapters sitting on my phone waiting to be edited and it just keeps going. I hope you enjoy these next few short chapters, as for some  reason they just keep coming out.
first, I am so unbelievably fucking sorry it took me over two weeks to update! the kids both had projects due all last week and most of my time was used helping them. Also, this chapter fought me, HARD. once i finally
"So." Aziraphale said after a moment of silence, looking on as Castiel stared in the direction that Dean and Crowley went off. He tapped his fingers over his legs and rocked back and forth on his feet, painfully aware of the tension winding around the other angel. "What about Gabriel?"
🎶They say you're feeling blue, well
The nameless demon peeked around Crowley's shoulder with a smug smile. "It's already happening. They didn't even see you fit enough to bring along their usual guard dog." The demon turned his attention back to Crowley. "Where's Castiel?"
“Do you think you could take me to Anathema, so I could ask her for help?” Dean asked trying to stay on topic.
It happened in slow motion for Dean, like one of those nightmares where you're trying to run away but it feels like you're caught in quicksand. It didn't register right away, what was happening. As soon as he pressed play, the world slowed almost to a halt as a familiar voice flooded through his speakers.
"C'mon Sammy I'm dying here!" Dean begged. "We ain't  getting  nowhere with our head stuck in these books, none of the hunters on the circuit have seen hide nor hair of Jack...we...it's getting to me Sammy. We just need a break man. One night. Please?"
"Dean, enough.” Cas said firmly.
"You might wanna tell him that." She said. Dean lifted his eyebrow at her, and she laughed. "Moose has been tiptoeing around here like he's afraid you'll lose your shit on him if he makes the slightest sound. He thinks you blame him for what happened."
He made it most of the way down the hall before a strong pair of arms wrapped around him from behind. "The seraph is driving absolutely everybody nuts you know." Crowley whispered into his ear.
“We have to give it a shot, Cas!” Sam snapped back.
"You can say that." Crowley said trying to regain his cool demeanor and he shifted back to his feet. "May have gone a little too well. He thinks he's my ...'consort' now." He huffed, trying his best to seem indifferent. "He's hardly even a concubine. So full of himself."
"You still get pissed at me, Dean." Came a quiet, rough and completely unexpected reply.
"You ready to roll?" Dean said, from the doorway, knocking on the door frame before entering the room.
The entrance to the bunker was in his sights, just a few more feet, a couple of steps, a steel door and a possibly broken staircase and he could get back to him. He could pull Cas out of there. They could hide. They could escape all of this together like it should be; like it always should have been. A few more paces and he could ....
“I beg your pardon?” Aziraphale blushed.
"I am." she replied confidently."
"Quite a big day for you, as I understand it." Speak of the devil...
"No, Dean." Sam said as Dean started to walk away. " That's not what I meant. We have to talk about..."
“Simple things my ass.” Dean mumbled to himself as he took in the sight of the massive apartment. It was brightly lit, decorated with pristine white furniture and the most beautiful houseplants he had ever seen. The TV on the far wall was at least the size of his bed back at the bunker and all the gadgets and gizmos around the room looked to be nothing less than state of the art. One thing was for sure, Crowley definitely liked to live in style.
"Sam." She half smiled, when she turned around, her eyes still a little bleary from crying. "Hi, I'm just…just packing up to head out and…" she sniffled and plopped down on the bed, covering her face as she began crying anew.
Either way, Cas had saved their asses, but it didn't give him the right to run away again. Dean needed him; he and Sam both did. They had just lost their mom, again. Their entire universe was ending. Everything they had spent their entire lives fixing, every ghost put to rest, every demon exorcised, every person saved, it was all erased with the snap of God's fingers. They watched the child they claimed as their own, killed, right in front of them. Emotions we're high, to say the least. Now wasn't the time to go off on another fruitless crusade to some other dimension to beg for help. No one was going to help them. Nobody cared. Even if they did, this was God they were going up against! Even if anybody was willing to help, who could?
Cas rolled his eyes and pushed Dean up “I'm not a genie, Dean. I'm not here to grant your every wish. Now get up. No one else is awake yet. We can make it safely to the kitchen without being caught. I'm sure Mary would appreciate a nice breakfast before her departure.”
"Shut up, Sam!" Dean grunted
Sam sighed, and nodded, relieved that his brother hadn't actually gone off the deep end as much as he thought when he offered them all up as sacrifice....and yet...he didn't start pushing until..."You wanted him to kill you." He said quietly.
“No, Zira....” The nickname was certainly enough to give the angel pause. Crowley had only used it a handful of times in the centuries that they had known each other(he found nicknames utterly ridiculous for the most part, when it involved shortening a person's real name, because he found it lazy) and never when they were in the middle of an argument. Crowley took a step closer and gripped Aziraphale by the chin, turning head to face the room where the others had gone. “... Look...” He said quietly.
"You keep saying that."
"Point taken." Dean said as the two of them walked into the hall.
Dean smiled back and leaned in to kiss the palm of her hand. Part of him was sad to see her go, but it was the best decision for everyone. At least he knew someone he cared for would be happy. An odd flare of jealousy shot through him then, probably because he wanted to be happy too. But...that wasn't in the cards for him now.
"Meaning we don't want to travel through dimensions every time you people can't handle a tiny apocalypse that crosses your path." Crowley smirked.
"Then what are you going to do about it." Billie asked, voice dripping with something akin to pride.
" No." He grunted. She opened the door and stepped in anyway. "Mom! C'mon! You can't just walk into a man's room. I could've been naked for all you know!"
" It was a simple mistake, Dean." She replied, remaining calm.
The screen faded out as the lights went up. There was hardly a dry eye in the place. Marie stood up and began speaking. Surely giving a speech about the power of love or a few words about the girls but all Dean could focus in was the hand that hadn't moved from his shoulder since Kristen's scene from the play.
"Hey, Cas, buddy," Dean had said with a sly grin on his face as he looked  at the angel across the breakfast table that morning. "Did you, uh, happen to make any pit stops before you called us when you..ya know...got back...from the empty, I mean?"
"No, not like that." He sighed. If he meant that he would have used the metric system, obviously. He never understood why the Americans had to make things so complicated. "I mean it's..."
"Team Free will against the world."
They've had this talk before....
“I ain't gonna be here that long.” Dean shrugged.
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
"You lose your hearing or something?" He snapped his bleary sunken eyes open, fixing her with an icy glare. "I said get out."
Cas spills the beans about the king of hell, Sam tells Dean about Amara
“Hold on a tick...” Mr. Young interrupted “Don’t I know you?”
He didn't hear the soft, sad "Good night, Dean." That followed him down the hall.
"No!" Aziraphale shouted, finally getting the demon's attention. "Murder suicide, Crowley? You're not a coward!"
“Oh no.” Mr. Young grumbled. “What has that boy gotten himself into this time?”
"But my Lord," another demon replied, "w-we just went to all that trouble to bring them back here. Why would we..."
"I think it stopped depending on my happiness a long time ago." Cas said. "I think it just wants me to suffer now."
Cas's eyes narrowed and his heart stopped. When the corner of Cas's mouth curled upward he wanted nothing more than to reel the words back in. The angel lifted his eyebrow and Dean wanted to run. "I appreciate your concern, darling, but I'm fine."
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah🎶
"Guess that means it's just the three of us." Dean heard his brother say as he left the room.
The other man smirked back, leaning even closer, so he and Dean were almost nose to nose. “Oh, believe me, darling,” he spat “I really think I could.”
*****
Thank you all so very much for the generous feed back!  I'm seriously floored by the response this has already received! You guys are truly the best! ❤️❤️❤️❤️💞
Don't you feel the same way?
Sam scrubbed a hand over his face several times finally landing with his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. “Everything.” He scoffed. “Honestly I don't even know where to start.”
So this isn't an actual chapter guys but I had to get this out there. I feel terrible for not updating the past few weeks and I wanted to explain.
"I doubt that." She hummed, bringing her face in closer. She was so close, the pull was irresistible, his mind became muddled as he leaned in close to her. He could feel her breath across his lips, when a pained groan in the distance snapped him out of it.
“Oh, no, I'm afraid Adam is on holiday with his gran.” Came the voice of Mrs. Young from the other side of the receiver.
"Looks, like it." Charlie smiled up at him as he entered.
"Not funny Cas! You know this is fake!"
“You're lying!” She snapped. “All you've ever done is lie to me. Give me one good reason why I should help you!”
"And here I thought demons were stupid." She snarled.
"I do." Dean said as he slung his arm over the demon's shoulder. "I really do."
"God seems to forget that he isn't the only everlasting being in existence." The Shadow added." And unlike God, I don't have the privilege of being able to die. If he succeeds in his plan to destroy the universe, every soul, human angel, and demon alike will have nowhere else to go but here. While the soulless, such as yourself, have never given me any problems, human souls are a bit more restless. As I've told you before, I like my sleep. If my home is filled with trillions and trillions of wailing and mournful souls for the rest of eternity, I will never be able to close my eyes again. I will not stand for it."
Sam took the opportunity, placing himself in front of Dean and shoving his arms out to stop him. "Dean, hold on, just hear me out!" The look he saw in Dean's eyes was terrifying, murderous. He hadn't seen that look since Dean was possessed by the Mark, and it was almost enough to give him pause, but he needed to tell his brother everything before things got worse.
A small burst of light dropped his hand. It felt no stronger that a burst of static shock, but it was enough to spark curiosity. He turned to see Rowena standing behind him, both arms extend outwards. "Sympathy is not weakness, Charles." She cried. "And cold indifference does not make you strong. It does not make you powerful. It makes you a coward!"
stupid face ever again." Cas answered back. Dean could practically feel the angel's eyes rolling from the other side of the door. "However, someone decided to place their sentries at the exits preventing me from escaping. I was just
Cas wrenched in pain again, tossing his head back and forth over Dean legs. "I'm so sorry, Dean. I should have never put you in that situation. I'm sorry." He let out a wet cough, wincing with every movement.
I say we scrape them from each other, darling, and let them wash off in the rain.
Thank you again for reading and I promise it picks up from here. Hopefully new chapters soon!
"I had to explain to your brother that the commotion that woke him was you having a particularly vivid nightmare that caused you to throw a pillow at your lamp." Cas said in a serious tone. "I told him not to worry, that I had the situation under control, and I was on my way to retrieve a new light bulb for you when we met in the hall. I sent him back to bed after he checked in to make sure you were okay. Not that he could see much in the dark, but the fact that you were sleeping peacefully seemed to satisfy him." Cas's eyes then moved to the hunters neck, and he reached his had out to heal him.
“Dean...” Cas shook his head and continued to stare into the hunter's eyes as they continued their conversation in silence.
Crowley opened his mouth (to make a smart ass remark no doubt) but thankfully was interrupted by an affronted Sam. "Wait! Why do you get Cas?"
"Don't tell him I said that though!" Dean laughed. " We got kind of a thing going, I don't wanna mess that up."
Aziraphale looked up at the demon sheepishly. “Well, I was trying to think of other ways we might be able to get Dean back home if Adam was unable to assist us, and well, I went over several old books of theories and such and I wasn't finding anything there and I couldn't really find anything else that might help, so I sort of.... well... I went to Heaven...to...to see if someone there might know of anything...”
“Who's Mary?” Kaia asked. It was the first thing she could think of to say.
Cas finally looked up, losing himself in the hunter's smile for a moment before breaking out into a nervous chuckle. "What's so funny Cas?" Sam asked.
"I can't leave him!"
So, if Cas thought the world was fucked...
Cas stood up straight and raised an eyebrow at Dean  "Did you just call me hot?" He smirked "Really, Dean I'm flattered but now is not the time. Your brother is right here." He and Sam broke into yet another round of laughter.
"Nothing." He shook his head. These girls took his and Sam's existence in stride, but he was pretty sure finding out they had been obsessing over the word of God might actually make their heads explode. "So about this 'subtext' crap..."
Crowley hid his victorious smile behind a fake pout as he moved to place himself at the foot of the angel's bed. "Oh, come now Castiel. That isn't fair. I thought we had grown rather close these past weeks. You should know better than that." That just earned him an angry scowl. "I heard you got yourself into quite a bit of a tizzy after you left here. " He said, swirling his finger over the comforter. "Smiting everything within reach. Is that the reason you're currently sitting in bed, reading, looking like a little girl who just got done raiding mummy's wardrobe, or perhaps it's just that time of the month?" A full-on growl that time. Progress perhaps? "I was under the impression you were sick of being holed up in this room. I guess I was mistaken, considering how quickly you decided to drain yourself just to wind back up here."
“What do you mean by that?” Crowley replied. His face almost looked offended.
The pounding grew louder.
"No!" They all said in unison.
"I wanted to show you beauty!" Chuck snarled. "I wanted to show you creation! I thought I could change your mind, but you were nothing but an ungrateful brat!" He pressed his hands to her shoulders and she flew across the room, crashing into the wall behind her. He looked at his own hands in shock, then glanced up to see Amara struggling to her feet. "You're weak. How..." He turned an angry glare to the others and snarled. "What did you do to her?!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam sighed, rubbing his eyes with his forefinger and thumb before shaking his head and taking a sip of his tea. "Yeah I figured as much." He grumbled before clicking through a few pages.
******
Sam and Cas exchanged irritated looks and grabbed their own jackets, Cas using one he had borrowed from Sam, and followed Dean out the door. Hopefully he would be in a better mood by the end of the night.
“Good morning, gentleman.” Aziraphale's voice drifted through the shop as soon as they passed the threshold. He appeared a moment later, dressed in his same dorky outfit, carrying a long parcel wrapped in leather. “Are we ready for our little journey across the dimensions?” He wore a smile on his face, but something in his eyes told Dean he wasn't genuinely happy.
Crowley is relentless and Cas is not amused.
I hope you'll hear me in the streetlight's humming, softly breathing out your name.
'Let me out'
“What the hell Cas?!”
“What's happening?” Dean asked. “What's wrong with Cas?!”
Jack looked at Dean with smile, then scrunched his nose and winced. " You smell like alcohol, Dean. You should probably go to bed."
Shit. So, it wasn't the kids. She was pissed at him too. "Claire, wait!" He grabbed her by the arm, but she quickly snatched it away.
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
"I believe you feel sorry for some of your actions yes." He said coolly, and there it was. He was struggling. He wanted to forgive Dean. He was trying to keep cool and distant. Cas was breaking and suddenly Dean was full of hope all over again. "I believe that you realize that some of your actions have been uncalled for and you wish to apologize." Cas licked his lips. He was breaking. Dean could see it. It probably wasn't noticeable to anyone else, at least not anyone who hadn't spent a ton of time around him and knew every one of his ticks. "Thank you." He swallowed and his eyes turned sad, but thoughtful, like he was sorting through that big, computer-like brain of his, searching for the right words to convey what he needed to say.  "I wish this changed anything."
Dean paced around his room for a while trying to decide what to do. He had no earthly idea why he was acting this way. This was Cas. Why was he so nervous? He'd hooked up with chicks more times than he could remember. And he didn't know any of them from Eve. It's not like it was hard....but this was Cas...
"Not a chance!" Sam giggled.
"Whatever floats your boat." She shrugged with a smile. She gave Dean one more warning glance before disappearing down the hall.
It was during his third day in hell, that Crowley decided that you can't trust anyone, no matter how attractive they were.
he gathered the Car washing supplies from the closet. He figured it was bet to talk calm to the kid and keep him distracted. No sense in freaking him out. Plus he was pretty sure Cas wouldn't just waltz past his damn son and leave without an explanation.
Castiel tried his best not to flinch as he met the hunter's eyes once more. "I was fully prepared to go with it then. I was willing to sacrifice myself for the good of the world."
" Take the next left past this hill right here." Sam said calling out the directions from the GPS. "It should be the first house on the right ."
Aziraphale rolled his eyes and Crowley's waggling eyebrows and switched his book to one hand, lacing the fingers of his free on with one of Crowley's. "And if everyone were to jump off a bridge, would you follow?"
“I...uh...” Sam sputtered.
Cas finally looked away from the screen and into Dean's eyes, his own watery and red rimmed. "We had an appointment."
"Dean, what the hell?!" Sam squawked behind him but the older Winchester kept his eyes forward.
Dean caught himself a second too late, turning to face the twin smirks that he had come to despise over the past few hours. "So, Cas is going to be crawling in your bed then, Dean?" Sam smirked.
"So, she's seen all those little 'not so secret' thoughts you've got banging around in that noggin of yours." She replied.
"I said, don't fucking touch me!"
"You are wrong!" Cas shouted over him. "Maybe that is true for us!" He said gesturing around the room with his blade before pointing over to Sam and Dean. "But them? They are special, they are unique. Are you so blind to your own creations that you can't see the beauty of a soul? I have traveled between the world's you have created; I have seen your copies and I can tell you that, no. Even the souls that you think you have made the same.... they're all different. Each and every one of them. You may have created them, but that does not give you the right to destroy them. Just because you have given up doesn't on them doesn't mean we will. You gave us something to love and protect, and I'll be damned if you think you can take that away."
"And you think running away is the answer?" Aziraphale asked.
"I....I can't" Cas said, his shoulders slumped.
******
"What we mean is," Sam interrupted " Dean, this place was built to teach people about monsters. It was built to give people the know how to protect themselves against everything that goes bump in the night, and I think that's how it should be used. I know we've tried it before, and it didn't end all that great for us, but we can learn from our mistakes."
"What about him?" Sam asked, hoping like hell that she wasn't talking about the angel brainwashing his brother or something.
Sam felt a warm feeling creep up on him as he watched his brother talk about the demon. Dean had actually made a friend. An honest to goodness friend, without even trying. "You really like him, don't you?"
Crowley stepped forward into the angel's space, only for Aziraphale to take a step back. " I didn't want this." Crowley sighed. " It's not like I asked for it. Dean's the one who put me up to it. "
The guy looked confused glancing at Castiel and then to Dean, trying to figure out who 'Sam' was. Dean jerked his head over in Sam's direction and place a finger across his lips, playing along. Rolly-eyes McGee nodded and pulled out a bag stuffing a couple of hand full of candy in, not really bothering to count, and slid the bag over to Cas. The angel placed the bag in his jacket pocket and slung his arm over the nephilim's shoulders guiding him over to where Sam and Mary were waiting.
"I...I don't..." Dean stammered. " That can't be right. Cas has been happy since then. He's been happy...he..."
"Actually, we were just discussing that ourselves. " Aziraphale replied. " So, let's get started. What's our plan?"
"Wait, Cas?!"  Marie squeaked  "As in Castiel?! Angel of the Lord Castiel?!"
"Not a chance, hot shot." Dean said. "You can easily just mojo yourself clean. Some of us actually need soap and water. We ain't waistin any on you!"
"No!" Cas growled. He was in front of Dean in a matter of seconds, causing the man to freeze. "No! You listen to me Dean Winchester!" His words were booming through the room, echoing off the walls. "I know you." He lowered his voice. "I knew you in hell as I fought to pull your battered soul from the pits. I'm the one who put you back together. Piece. By. Piece. I know you, heart, mind, body and soul. I Have walked by your side on this earth for years. I spent a year with you in purgatory, watching you battle every creature imaginable, except your own demons. I know you better than I even know myself. You can't lie to me. You can lie to Jack, probably your mother, and maybe even Sam, but you can't lie to me."
"So's Cas! He's family mom. I thought you knew that."
Meg nodded across the room to Crowley and the two of them engulfed Chuck in hellfire. Castiel and Gabriel dove for the box, standing it upright in just the right place and leaving it open. Soon, Chuck was ready, hand in the air, ready to smite the demons away when the angels began dealing out blows, group by group in quick succession, in random patterns to keep him confused. Gadreel’s group began throwing blades, hitting him in various places. It did little harm, but served as a distraction while Balthazar's crew did what they could to help Amara. Balthazar himself, began whispering the plan into her ear as the rest of the angels continued to blast Chuck with everything they had. Chuck threw out an arm and threw back a group of angels in front of him, just in time for Jack to use his own powers and throw a fallen pillar at his head. The stone broke on impact, but blinded Chuck long enough for Jack to throw a book shelf straight after with no interference.
Dean scratched the back of his head looking down at his feet. "Yeah, that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about too. All that subtext stuff. Listen, Sam was reading some....stuff...on the internet and he came across some things that were a bit, unsettling."
"That was before she knew about us. Besides, it could've been worse and you know it."
"Alright, that's enough!" Dean said. "Great to see you kid! Sorry you can't stay. Have fun at your party tonight and have a great life or whatever." He took a bite of his burger and waved her off.
The angel who fixed his human, and in doing so, broke himself.
"I believe most women do carry small mirrors with them at all times to check on the status of their cosmetics through out the day. " Cas replied "I think they are called 'Compacts'."
"Down stairs in the dungeon with the others." Dean replied, tucking his gun into his waist band, as she and the others took off down the steps. "What part of 'God's on our asses, don't come to the bunker' did you not understand Garth?"
Cas hummed quietly and nodded his head, then he looked back down at his clothes. " Although, perhaps my attire would be more suitable for such a location." he rolled his head towards Dean with a look of genuine hurt in his eyes.
"What about Death?" Aziraphale supplies. "You said she helped you collect souls the last time. Couldn't you..."
"I get that kid, I do." Gabe shrugged. "But I can't exactly leave you here. You screwed a lot of thing up and well...."
"I hate you." Dean cried, burying his face into the angel's hair.
"He deserved so much better." Dean cried. “We deserved so much better than this." And he was right. Because none of them had asked for this. It was just thrust upon them, without a choice.
Adam looked up and gave him a bright smile before letting go and turning to Sam and Rowena “Good bye Miss Rowena. Thank you so much for helping us. I'm glad you aren't a warty witch.” Rowena smiled and bowed her head. “Goodbye, lady hair.” He waved. “It was very nice to meet you as well.
" But you said it to me!" Dean whined. And he watched Castiel's  face flash through about 30 different  emotions at once. First was fear, utter terror to be realistic. Somewhere in the middle he saw undeniable fury. Panic, joy, relief, all finally settling on sadness And that's when it clicked. "....oh...Oh!.." About a trillion  thoughts were racing through Dean's mind. 'He said those things to me. He meant those things for me. Castiel, angel of the lord, feels that way about me'
The Shadow yawned and rolled his eyes at Chuck's display, waving his hand in the air, causing black sludge to rise up around the fallen soldiers and right them again, completely okay. The smug smile slipped from Chuck's face as he glanced around him and back to the Shadow's bored expression. "We could do this all day, Chuck. You can waste all your energy killing them over and over if you'd like, but I'll just keep bringing them back."
"I'm sorry, dude, but I'm gonna need the whole story here." Garth managed between laughs.
"Oofta! You look a little rough there Dean. Come in, come in."
Crowley opened his door and slid into his seat. He closed the door behind him and turned to point a finger in Dean's face. “If I ever catch you trying to drive my car again, I'll...burn off your hands or something!” He snapped his fingers and the car started, and before Dean could even argue they were racing down the street.
Dean chuckled and patted his back before pulling away. "What do you say we find our prophet?." Dean smiled, before smaking him in the chest and walking away.
"Yeah, okay." She chuckled.
I swear that even with the distance, slowly wearing at your name,
"Yes." Cas hissed, his wings flaring out sharply. Sam saw Dean reach out a trembling hand to touch them and pulled at his brother’s wrist, shaking his head and nodding it in the direction of Rowena. Dean nodded, taking one last look at the wings before the two of them started crawling across the floor towards the trembling witch.
"What did you do?" Aziraphale chided.
"You're only our king temporarily." The demon said placing his cards on the table. "It's only a matter of time before the Winchester's decide to get rid of you too."
“Not really.” Dean shrugged. He started pulling nervously at the bottom of Cas's jacket, making sure it sat just right. “ l mean the kid already considers himself one anyway, and it's not like you have a last name already. You're family, so it just kinda makes sense... I don't know. It's not really that big of a deal or anything...”
"Maybe if you would've fucking listened to someone other than yourself for once in your life Dean, you could've saved yourself from running Cas off. " Sam said. "You were so damn concerned with making him stay and yelling at him for keeping things from you, you wouldn't even let me explain why he did!"
******
So, Sam watched Dean parade woman after woman through countless hotel rooms never letting any of them stick around long enough to see how broken he really was. He watched countless relationships crumble to the ground, romantic and otherwise, because Dean refused to let anyone in. He watched his brother lose more and more of himself with each person he kept at arm’s length. Even Lisa fell to Dean's inability to let anyone all the way in.
"Yes, he was!" Gabriel piped up. "You dickwads were just too stupid to see it! You're the ones who fucked it all up!"
The car was silent, both of them refusing to look at each other for at least ten miles.it was Claire who spoke first, in a small quiet voice. "You're not my father, Castiel." She said. His heart was overwhelmed with sorrow, and he began racking his brain for anything he could say to comfort this girl he had broken so many times, in so many ways. "But that doesn't mean I don't look up to you."  It was the last thing he expected to hear. He kept his eyes forward, letting the agonizing seconds tick by as he waited for her to explain. "I hated you, at first. I really did. I wanted you to die. I wanted you to suffer like you made me suffer. And then I got to know you. I watched you try and try and try, with everything you had to make up for your mistakes. And even when that wasn't enough, you just kept trying, no matter what. You lost everything, just as much as I did, but you never gave up. If that ain't a role model, I don't know what is. You aren't perfect and you screw up more than anyone I know, but you try. So, I figure, if you can make it through all of that, lose everything you love again and again, over and over, then I can manage to do it too."
"No. I don't." Cas said over his shoulder as he jogged towards the door behind Marie. He caught up with her just outside.
"Dean..." Cas pleaded.
“Why not?” Crowley smirked back. Dean chuckled and shrugged in response. “Now, if you're quite done with your investigation, Aziraphale called. He told me he has a few questions for you, himself.” Crowley snapped and Dean's plate and mug disappeared. He stood up and straightened himself out. “Shall we?” He asked, flourishing his hand out towards the door.
"Why Dean," Aziraphale said, "I had no idea you were familiar with the policies of utilitarianism."
“He was telling the truth about everything.” Crowley whispered as Aziraphale watched. “I found most of it hard to believe but I went along with it because he seemed like a genuinely good man. Being here, now, it's hard to deny that everything he said was true.” Dean had turned to face Castiel entirely now, gesturing at the angel's torso with one hand. Castiel held out his arms and looked down, shaking his head before looking back at Dean. He didn't so much as flinch when the man reached up to muss his hair and fiddle with his clothes, straightening them out. “That means God is everything Dean told us. Every awful thing.” Dean ran a thumb over one of the cuts on Castiel’s face and held the blood out for him to see. The angel looked back down with a shy smile as a soft blue light began leaking from each cut before disappearing completely. “What if the almighty decides to come for us next?” Aziraphale tore his gaze away from the pair to look into Crowley's eyes. He couldn't tell for sure, past the sunglasses, but they almost looked to be on the verge of tears, and he could take a guess as to why. “I couldn't bear it, Angel.”
“Well...no.” Cas answered carefully. “I fly. I have wings. They haven't worked in a really long time, so we were very lucky that they got fixed when they did.”
"It's not your decision Dean." It smiled back at him with Billie's face, gripping tightly onto the scythe as it took a step forward. "Castiel and I have a deal. He got his reward. Now I'm here to…to reap mine." It smiled wider.
Trying to avoid the overwhelming guilt threatening to bubble up inside him, like it did every time he thought about the hell he put his best friend though when he was a human, Dean shuffled back through his bag and pulled out his spare pair of flannel pants and an old Zeppelin shirt, tossing them to the angel. "Here, borrow these. It ain't a slumber party without pyjamas."
The Bentley was no less beautiful in the daylight, the sun reflecting brightly off its flawles, midnight sheen. Dean made his way toward the car, stopping briefly to correct his course when he remembered that the passenger’s side wasn't the side he was originally headed for. He opened the correct door and fastened his seat belt, tapping lightly on the dash as he waited for Crowley to start the car. It was a nervous habit he had picked up over the years, and he wasn't even aware he was doing it until the demon placed his hand on top of Dean's to halt it. “That  is quite enough of that, thank you.” Crowley said after pulling his hand away. “I won't have her scratched up by that silly ring of yours.”
Sam began crying harder, fear swelling in his eyes. Dean pulled his brother to his shoulder and let him sob against it as he rubbed his back. "Hey, hey it's okay. It's okay. I know you're scared. I…I know it hurts. I know you don't wanna have you're heart broken again. I know you don't wanna let yourself love someone only to lose them…I…I understand, believe me I do. But sometimes you gotta take that risk. Sometimes you gotta put yourself out there. If you don't….life's too short to live it full of regrets. I don't want that for you man. You deserve to be happy. No one should live their lives not knowing what happiness is." He choked back his own tears as he held his brother, rocking him back and forth. "She makes you happy, Sammy. And that's all I've ever wanted for you. You gotta at least try. Please? I need you to be happy."
I...am not proud of this chapter. Honestly, that's why it took me forever. Adding Amara threw me off and i had to shove somethings together. Its sloppy, but hey, gotta make the plot somewhat cohesive, right?I did this to myself. But i added a nice little Crowley and Aziraphale moment that i wasn't planning on adding yet to make it up to you (and myself). so here we go with this mess. I hope you enjoy.
"No" Dean snapped. " Fuck, Cas, it's not like that, man...it's just…"
There was no more time for secrets.
"You're melodramatic is what you are."
Sam hobbled down the hall to the guest room, his hand still  throbbing from knocking Dean unconcious . It was…worrisome, to say the least, that he was having this much trouble with healing from such a minor injury, not to mention the other things that were happening to his body; the fatigue, coughing up blood. Troubling, but, as much as he hated to admit it, worth it. Dean had been pissing him off more than usual lately anyway. It wasn't just the trials. Sure, he was frustrated with Dean for thinking he wasn't strong enough to handle them (he had fought against Lucifer in his own mind for christ's sake) but it was everything else too. His loyalty to Benny still didn't sit right with him. He had been so quick to kill Amy, just because she was a monster. He didn't care that she was just feeding her kid. She was just a monster to him. But for some reason, Benny got a pass. Sure, the guy saved both their asses, he was grateful for that, but even Bobby knew it was wrong.
It was worse when he got to the garage.
" C'mon man it's not like it's all about you." Sam said "There's plenty of stuff that involves me. Cas too."
She set her drink back down, tucking her slip of paper underneath and swiveled in her chair, her long dark curls falling gracefully over her shoulders, her deep timeless eyes burrowing into his soul. Her smile slipped slightly as she took in the sight before her "Castiel. It's nice to see you back to your usual self, nephew."
Cas smiled as he wriggled his hand from Dean's grasp and sent another surge of grace through him anyway. " As much as I appreciate your enthusiasm to be honest about our relationship, I do not feel presenting it to our family in the form of flesh wounds is the best idea."
Dean felt and odd pang of jealousy as he watched her sauntering away, clearly  putting on a show for the angel. He figured he was upset that she chose Cas over him and shrugged it off. Tonight wasn't  about him anyway. He slapped  his hand on his friend's  back and gave him an approving nod. "Nice, Cas. Real smooth."
Anger now. Anger was added to the sea of emotions welling up inside of him. " Oh well in that case," he scoffed. "Fuck no!"
"You're fucking crazy!" Dean scoffed. "I don't do that!"
Charlie sniffed again, wiping her arm across her face to dry it before leaning back and staring at Sam. "I don't get it." She said, as firmly as possible.
"He's Lucifer's." Cas answered.
Suddenly, Dean felt a rush of panic wash over him. Cas was enjoying himself. He was happy. He found himself unable to tear his eyes away from the angel, for fear that he might disappear or drop dead on the spot. He knew as told him that it was fine, but what if he was wrong? What if the entity didn't want to wait until he was completely worry free? What if it just wanted to give Cas a taste of happiness before whisking him away to the Empty? What if...
"Flesh wounds, eh?" Dean said waggling his eyebrows. "Someone got rough."
"It's nothing." Cas replied, trying once more to squeeze past.
She smiled back and tucked a crimson lock behind her ear. She placed a slender  hand on her hip, her green eyes sparkled  down into his. "Quite the tolerance you have there cutie," She giggled, clearly flirting " I don't have to be worried about you, do I?"
*****
Thank you all again for the positive responses! They feed my soul! 😊
"Perhaps I should seek help from the other angels then." Cas said, mechanically. "I'm sure there is at least one or two left in Heaven that would be willing to assist."
“Of course, seriously!” Crowley's tone sounded like a mix of irritated and sincere. “Besides, you were supposed to find help weren't you. At the very least we should be there to help you explain why you failed miserably. I wouldn't miss that for the world.” He smirked.
"Did I fucking stutter?!" Crowley hissed, hoping like hell his tone would hide the fact that he felt like he was going to be sick. "Ssssoulsss! NOW!"
"Yeah, alright, " Gabriel laughed, "that's all well and good but what makes you think I'm letting your ass into Heaven?"
Dean chuckled and clapped his hand against the Angel's shoulder. “Don't take it too hard buddy. The kid's pretty awesome, but I think we'll keep you around.” He looked over his shoulder, to check on the other's progress, to see Crowley looking over at him with a wicked smirk. Dean stopped unconsciously rubbing over the spot he had placed his hand and shot the demon a confused eyebrow, only to get an eyebrow waggle and a shrug in response before Crowley turned his attention back to what Rowena was saying. He wasn't even aware that Cas had been watching the entire silent exchange.
“Lucky for him, maybe, but I'm not so certain it was lucky for us.” Another voice replied.
"You're not talking to me." Dean said marching away, the hard coldness returning to his voice.
“Can’t say he'll feel the same.” Dean replied pulling his hand back and squeezing them between his thighs. “He and Sam weren't too thrilled with me when I left. I doubt either of them are really upset that I'm gone.”
"I can do that." Cas said calmly, leaning slightly back.
"Great." Dean slapped his shoulder one more time before heading off towards his room. "See ya tomorrow buddy." He called behind him.
“I don't want to leave it in the car, what if somebody steals it?” Cas pouted.
“ Alright, mom.” Dean smiled as he watched her walk out of the kitchen. She had really gotten better at being a mom to them since she came back. It was difficult for all of them at first, but Dean feel that he was finally grateful to have her back in his life. If it wasn't for their talks this last week, he may have never realized how much Cas truly cared for him. Dean was snapped out of his thoughts quickly when he heard his brother groan.
"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself." Cas smiled.
Sam couldn't help but notice the bitter tone to Cas's voice, and he didn't have to think too hard to take a guess on why that was. He pushed the dust pan against the broom and placed his free hand on Cas's shoulder to get his attention. "Hey. We got Dean back. That's the important thing. As for those two ... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but for now the guy's right. So whatdya say we go save the world? Again."
"What?!" She growled, whipping back around.
Also, update: I got my monitor fixed today so, yay!!!! I will be spending som time going through the story so far and fixing some major mistakes( ie: autocorrects refusal to accept character names). I'm sure there's still gonna be a few, but it will at least be a little more readable and it also means that there will be less of them from now on!
Anyway... here's more story
"I take your laughter to mean that you understand what I did wrong then?"
"Go." Rowena said when he looked at her. "I'll take care of the others. I can cast a protection spell and get us somewhere safe. Go, save your idiot brother before he gets himself killed, again."
"I thought of that too." Sam replied, still clicking through the pages. "I don't want to risk either of them getting hurt or worse. Reversing it isn't an option as far as I can tell."
"Dude, I can see the antennas sticking out." Dean laughed. " How did you even fit it in there?"
"Oh, come now angel." Crowley pouted. "That's not fair."
"I think I can manage now, yes." Cas nodded wiping away a tear.
“What is a 'ruhgayrow'?” Aziraphale asked. Sam let out an exasperated sigh and leaned over to the book the angel was reading.
❤️ Y'all.
had been found, and they were free to leave their posts, before placing his phone back in his pocket and approaching the door. It was locked. "Cas? You in there, buddy?"
"What the fuck is your problem?!" Dean barked, still trying to hobble after him.
"What?"
Mary smiled as she leaned against the truck, twirling the keys over her finger. “ I always have been, Dean.”
“Huh?” Dean looked back to see Aziraphale and Crowley standing, awkwardly, in front of the rift.
“This was fun!” Jack said, when they made their way into the library, hugging his guitar to his chest. “ We should do stuff like this more often. I like spending time as a family.”
“Alright, then.” Rowena smiled sympathetically. “Let’s attempt the impossible. Again.” She walked the bowl over and began chanting, pouring out the contents as she moved. She circled them three times before stopping in front of the chair and making a line to the wall with the ingredients as she said. “Come with me, Samuel,” she said after placing the bowl down against the wall, grabbing him gently by the arm. “It's best we stay out of the way for this part.” She pulled him out of the dungeon and turned them to face the other two. “Go ahead, now, and good luck.” She squeezed Sam's arm and gave him a weary smile.
“Alternate universes....” Aziraphale said again as he set another small glass of whiskey in front of Dean. He poured two more glasses of wine, placing one on the table in front of Crowley, before sitting down back down with his own. They had moved into the back room after Dean explained about his hand in the apocalypse from his own universe. They began drinking somewhere between Purgatory and the Fall. “Forgive me, Dean, I want to believe you, but your story seems a little far-fetched.”
Dean slammed the door behind him, thankful that he had parked baby out front for once. He didn't think he could survive the walk to the garage.
She bit her lip and turned back to face the wall. "It's not your fault either you know." She said, after a few minutes.
"Hmm." Crowley quirked his eyebrow at Dean.
It had been at least two hours since Cas had stormed out. Sam probably should've been worried. He should've been sifting through the lore, buried in books, scrolls, and prophecies, finding anything he could on opening rifts to other dimensions. He should be brushing up on every monster and creature in existence, thinking of ways to kill them in mass quantities, figuring out a way to call Chuck and trying to get him to listen to reason. The only problem was, he just couldn't find it in himself to care.
"No, I'm getting that too." Dean nodded "Cas?"
"I've changed my mind." Crowley snapped. " Go home. I don't care anymore. I take it all back."
"Then why don't you do something about it." Jody glared back. "I'm sure there's something in that book of yours that can ward off whatever you think is brewing."
Dean sighed and glared at Crowley. "What did I say about getting Cas riled up?" He grumbled.
Her face went dark as she crumpled the paper on the bar underneath one hand. "I offered you a place at my side before, Dean. You refused." She glanced back over at Castiel, briefly before switching to started at the bottom of her half empty glass. "I think I now understand why."
Sam nodded and stood in place, awkwardly shifting his weight from one foot to the other. He was a mess. His normally flawless hair was stuck up in a million different directions, his eyes rimmed red and puffy. His splotchy face looked as if he had aged five years, his clothes were torn and filthy and honestly it was almost the best thing Dean had ever seen. Sammy was standing in front of him, looking like he had just crawled out of a dumpster fire, because Sam was alive.
Dean placed a comforting hand on the nephilim's shoulder and looked him in the
