The man, dark curls framing his face, reaches for something next to him. Greg recognizes a simple acoustic guitar as the man lifts it onto his lap and begins to gently stroke the strings. Hesitant notes drift from the speakers.
A small smile he doesn’t care to hide curls John’s lips for a second. Then he says, “I thought about telling you so many times. So many times. But I chickened out I guess. I was waiting for the perfect opportunity, for a sign that you felt the same. I thought we’d get there eventually. But then you jumped off that rooftop and I… I lost you.” He shakes his head as if to get rid of the thought. “And I beat myself up for having waited so long and I cursed myself for being such a coward and for having to live a life without you in it. I thought that you wouldn’t’ve jumped if I had been a better reason to stay. I was devastated, just a broken, black-and-white version of myself. Worse than after Afghanistan, so much worse.”
When his skin begins to redden from the cold, he turns the water to a more pleasant temperature and shifts his head. John leans his forehead against the tiles and lets out a silent sigh as the cool surface soothes his headache. Gradually, the tight, feverish feeling gives way to something more subdued.
Sherlock raised his brows in playful contemplation. “I wouldn’t put it past their level of incompetence to miss those crucial clues. They usually do.”
Greg clenches his jaw.
He takes two mugs out and turns the old coffee maker on. He can’t wait to unpack their wedding presents and hopefully find the espresso machine they have registered for.
The time it spent stuffed into John’s pocket has crumpled it so that the edges are sticking out in odd angles like broken limbs.
“Can we tell him now? About the ring and everything,” John asked, stifling a yawn and watching the passing cars and their drivers, unfazed by the temperatures outside, with obvious envy.
They’ve just regained a fragile balance in their friendship, something John wouldn’t’ve thought possible. After everything Sherlock has put him through, after letting him grief for two years… But still, John is thrilled to have him back in his life.
Before he could finish, the office door was flung open and Sergeant Donovan barged into the room, stopping in the frame as if the tension hanging in the air was a brick wall. Her eyes flicked back and forth between them before landing on her superior, and she regained her composure: “Why aren’t you picking up your phone? We’ve got DNA.”
“Why didn’t you just tell me?”
As if remote-controlled, he carefully tugs the envelope in his waistband and drapes his shirt over it before he ascends the stairs again.
“On the contrary.”
“Killing someone with your bare hands? That’s a crime of passion,” said Sherlock his eyes twitching rapidly in thought, “but the murderer didn’t get flustered. Instead, they intricately staged an accident. We’re looking for someone with access to chemical supplies.”
An echo of the same sense of responsibility Sherlock had experienced all those years before rang in his chest. He would never let John fight sickness or injury or anything the world might inflict on him alone ever again. Not, if there was any other way.
And yet, he had ruined the illusion last night, given in to temptation.
The phone rang again, the sound an atrocious intrusion in the white noise of the nightly city. Sherlock didn’t even look at the screen this time. He was sure that reading the name again, that four precious letters that his world orbited around, would break him down entirely. Why would John torture him like this? Wasn’t it enough that he didn’t love Sherlock and never would, not the way Sherlock loved him at least? Was he trying to make Sherlock believe that he still cared even though every single one of his reactions had proven the opposite?
“When and what did you eat and drink last?” asked Sherlock, his voice slipping into the matter-of-fact but eager tone he used on clients.
, with another pull at his hem.
John was furious. “Are you seriously shushing me—”
“Well, you didn’t respond.”
“What?”
The lump in his throat grows with every step, the grocery bag weighing him down as if it were filled with lead instead of apples, toast, and beans. He will miss all of this. But what other choice is there really?
Does that make her sympathetic silence better or worse? Is it just polite of her not to point out his misjudgement or is it so painfully obvious that he’s hurting that it renders words completely superfluous?
She is so soft, so warm, so perfect. Sometimes, John can’t fathom his love for her. It’s almost frightening in its intensity and of a different colour than everything he’s ever felt before, like a new lens slid over his vision.
So, cheering John up was Sherlock’s objective, no matter what it took. But Mary had been so right about him: John Watson would never consciously allow anyone to aid him in his grieving process. Hence, Sherlock had to cloak his aim. Doing all of this for Rosie’s sake was the perfect disguise since it was technically not a real lie. Additionally, it concealed the fact that Sherlock genuinely enjoyed the festive atmosphere their home radiated. It contained nothing of the mendacity he hated about most societal norms, it wasn’t a façade gilding a dysfunctional inside: the decorations were only a visualization of the sincere and all-embracing love that filled 221B Baker Street. Now, it shone from every Christmas ornament.
There’s a baby on the way.
John steadied their bodies and Sherlock let out another shaky breath: “Anything, with you, John. Everything, with you.”
John had just turned on the kettle and taken some eggs out of the fridge as Sherlock entered the kitchen. John turned his back to him and began to prepare breakfast. After what had happened last night, he thought it best to let Sherlock set the pace of this conversation.
Sherlock is not a coward. No, he’s brave and courageous and vulnerable when John least expects him to be.
The initial warmth in his guts becomes something less pleasant as Greg watches Sherlock sip at his third—
“And you’re doing great, honestly, Sherlock. She adores you.”
“Hm, can’t be it, I’ve had the same thing and I’m fine,” Sherlock said and waved his hand dismissively, now beginning to pace the room again to wear off some of the nervous energy seething in his body.
What reason could there be to reach out now anyway?
His hands trembling slightly in their oven mitts, he retrieves the steaming lasagne and sets it down on the stovetop.
“You also play the piano?”
“Are you trying to tell me witnessing that hurt you? Because I can assure you I know how that feels.”
A sudden realization pulsing through his mind, Sherlock slowly raised his eyes from the gadget back to John whose face bore a unique expression of satisfaction and anxiety. Sherlock’s heartbeat drowned out all of their surroundings as John nodded, a nervously wavering smile on his lips, and got down on one knee. Taking Sherlock’s hand in his, he finished his sentence: “—husband, not boyfriend. Will you marry me, Sherlock?”
John gave him a quick, appreciative peck on the lips before resuming their dance, his head now resting on Sherlock’s neck. “I’m glad. I was a little worried, admittedly. And for the record: It was great for me, too. Best night of my life, honestly. Slept like a baby. Which reminds me: I’ll have to pick up Rosie from Mrs Hudson’s.”
He longed to get the weight off his shoulders, ached to set down the boulder he was carrying and tend to the sharp cuts it had grated into his flesh. But telling the story would mean living through it again and that was simply too much. So, he stayed silent and stared at the table top with an intensity that might have burned a hole right through it.
Next to him, Sherlock gave a jolt and a little indistinguishable whimper. John quickly kept talking, drawing Cal’s attention back to himself. “Running isn’t an option, Cal, just put the gun down. You don’t want to do this. Think about Laney.”
As if responding to his thoughts, Sherlock kept singing, a knowing smile on his tasty lips: “
Sherlock halted and fixated his friend, looking for signs of dishonesty or rejection, yet finding nothing but sincere concern. Even now, John was more worried about Sherlock being uncomfortable than about his own tarnished health.
The mere thought of losing Sherlock again, of him thinking that it didn’t matter, that he didn’t matter…
John loves him.
Sherlock hurls the phone at the empty red armchair, half-hoping to break either disloyal object, but the phone just bounces off the cushion and lands miserably on the carpet. He glares at it.
The nightly street stretched out before him like a black satin sheet, its wet surface reflecting the red and white of the other cars’ lights in an array of kaleidoscopic flashes. John’s hand lay loosely on the steering wheel as he followed the road signs that would bring them back to London. He quickly glanced over at Sherlock whose head had sunken against the window. His mouth slightly agape and his slender limbs curled inside his coat for warmth and comfort, he looked wonderfully human and completely out of this world at the same time. The dancing flickers of colourful light illuminated his features. John smiled calmly to himself as he forcefully drew his eyes away from the mesmerizing sight that was the face of Sherlock Holmes.
“Not good?”
When the alarm wakes him, John finds he is indeed looking forward to the honeymoon, if only for the prospect of sleeping in.
John let himself drop to his back and ran a hand through his hair, trying to detain his arousal. This was… shit, to say the least. After the rocky road they had already travelled to get here, such a trivial problem should be the last thing to thwart them. It just wasn’t fair. Or maybe something was wrong. And this wasn’t meant to be.
“I understand you two have made up?” Mrs. Hudson added with an almost unbearable air of complacence. John was still unsure about how much their landlady had witnessed of yesterday’s drama—the fight, Sherlock storming out in the middle of the night, John leaving in the early morning, Sherlock collapsing upon his return to an empty flat, thinking John had abandoned him.
. John, who wanted him, John, who loved him, even with the lights on.
Hello everyone,
“No.” Sherlock measures his next words carefully. “I only knew on the roof. When I had to say goodbye to you.”
“They?” John repeated absent-mindedly, staring up the stairs that separated him from any future he and Sherlock might have, the word’s meaning barely piercing the surface of his billowy mind. Before Mrs. Hudson could clarify the matter, he added: “Could you maybe take care of Rosie? I need to discuss some things with Sherlock and—”
John lets his breath stream out of him unvoiced, nerves and trepidation painted on his face before something different settles over his features.
He and John exchanged a look, trauma recognizing trauma, soldier acknowledging soldier.
“Oh.” Sherlock let the syllable drop to the floor, his eyes following it, unable to take in the confusing gloriousness of John any longer. He saw feet stepping closer and hands reaching for his own. With cheeks heated by the candlelight or the blood rushing into them, Sherlock forced himself to look at John again, being met by an inquisitive gaze of way too blue eyes.
“You could when you decided to marry someone else.”
“Please tell me we’re not that soppy,” John said, his fingers instinctively finding Sherlock’s to betray his words.
And John remembered.
“Anything useful?” John squatted down next to him, his voice conspirational and fond.
Mon-Sun, 9:00 – 16:00
was a bit not good although these invisible lines people always drew seemed completely random to Sherlock. And gradually he ran out of ideas. Undoubtedly, further research was necessary.
Sherlock ducks his head. “Yes, of course.”
Shoes and shirts and trousers land on the floor down the hallway as they stumble toward Sherlock’s bedroom.
“Did you check on Jason?”
“Pardon?”
John.
“I know.” John licked his lips as he watched Sherlock drink, waiting for his judgement. This habit of his never ceased to confuse Sherlock. Did John even know that his tongue often slipped out like this when he looked at him? At the sight, Sherlock’s skin began to prickle as if his blood had been carbonated as well. He gave John an approving nod and diverted his gaze back to Stella and Marcus.
Something Sherlock meant to give him but Greg didn’t want him to see?
They stayed put in their embrace for blissful, silent minutes until another thought crossed John’s mind. “Were you already on that bridge when I called you?”
“The trouble you boys get in.” Mrs. Hudson shook her head. “Out all night, in the freezing cold, getting shot at… Have you at least eaten something? I know how you get when you’re on a case, Sherlock.”
For a few minutes, they sank back into silence. The bare-branched trees in the back of the garden looked like the skeletons of some long-forgotten civilisation’s high priests, their black hands raised to the sky in prayer. If they’d just stretched a little further, their scrawny fingers might have caught the low-hanging clouds drifting over the moon.
“And what are a couple more days or weeks in relation to that?”
Still drowsy, he rolled onto his back. Something had shifted, he could sense it. The world around him seemed stuck in some kind of surreal bubble, existing outside of the current of time, in a parallel universe filled with strange melodies and scents. Fragments of sensations, images, noises lurked about in the fuzzy edges of his mind, reflecting the morning light in every direction like a broken mirror.
Before long, he finds what he’s looking for: a small newsstand right outside his bribery radius. The owner is about to close for the night but still happily sells Sherlock three packs of cigarettes and a lighter. The quip about his rushed demeanour only peripherally touches Sherlock’s ears as he rips the pack open.
Greg placed the cups in front of them and sat down next to Molly, who immediately leaned into his body. The gesture radiated an instinctive affection and intimacy Sherlock could barely fathom. The sight sent a flash of envy through his veins and he quickly lowered his gaze back to the table. Why had they finally figured out what they wanted and actually gotten it?
Sherlock heaved himself onto his elbows, seeking John’s half-closed eyes in the gloom of their bedroom. “Do you mean that?”
John’s gaze followed them but was soon pulled back to Molly and his daughter playing on the sofa.
At the words, Mrs. Beaumont gave another pitiable sob, forming words nonetheless: “No one would’ve wanted to hurt him. He didn’t have—enemies. Jason was a good boy. He—”
Love, John.
“Never have I ever,” Sherlock started, unsure how to end the sentence. After all, the possibilities were diverse. “Never have I ever… been caught making out with someone?” Molly gave him an encouraging nod. Phew, that seemed to work. Marcus, Stella, Greg, and Tara drank.
“Ever?”
With a deep sigh, Sherlock’s slender index finger began to cut intricate patterns through John’s chest hair and the thoughtful silence between them. “Well,” he finally said, dragging out the sound suggestively, “we could do other… stuff, right?”
Without his permission, the thought of Sherlock’s dark timbre with the magical ability to make Rosie fall asleep within minutes crept into John’s mind. Mere hours ago, they had bantered about it, carefreely and intimately. Mere hours ago, they had existed in this sphere of unadulterated happiness—a little family, unconventional but nonetheless perfect. How had they managed to destroy all this in one day?
The only letter Mary’s ever written him had been nothing but a coward’s resort, an excuse for abandoning him and their child without even having the decency to say goodbye.
“What did you do next?”
“No, it’s… fine. I like it, actually. A lot.”
Before Sherlock could protest, John turned him around, exposing his back to the light. The sight made his heartbeat stumble: A wild clutter of scars expanded over Sherlock’s skin, an abstract painting of distorted flesh and warped skin. John scanned the damage with expertly glances; These cuts, deep and overlapping, had to have been inflicted over hours or even days, given and reopened by precise violence until the skin hang positively in tatters. How come he had never seen them before?
change.
He can’t deter his thoughts from circling the DVD, as much as he tries. No walk on the beach, no massage, no yoga lesson can take his mind off of it.
“Then you know that people are supposed to kiss when standing under it?” John raised his brows so high they almost touched the boughs hanging on the ceiling, menacingly. What kind of bloody joke was this?
said Mycroft’s voice, although not as caustically as usual.
John put on his jacket, checked for his wallet and keys, and made for the door but a firm hand around his arm held him back. As he turned around, Sherlock’s lips were on his once more, fiery and sweet. Separating again, Sherlock said solemnly: “I’ll be waiting for you.”
John nodded and wet his lips. “I thought since you…
Listening to John now, his voice still muffled by sleep and fever, didn’t fail to evoke this response either. Without his permission, Sherlock’s lips curled into a cherishing smile.
The thought that he had brought this unwelcome visitor onto himself, all due to a stupid,
John sank his teeth into his skin again and added a twist of his hand at the top, choking Sherlock off into a guttural moan. Little white lights danced past his vision. And right there, right then, he understood: There had never been any reason for concern or fear that night at the pool. It had been empty threats, void of any real danger: Jim Moriarty would never have been able to burn the heart out of him. It was John, always John, who would dismantle him, strip him down to his core, and burn him with the fire that only he could light in his veins.
John takes a look at his watch. The cab shouldn’t be here for another half hour. Mary is still in the bathroom, blow-drying her hair going by the noise filtering through the door.
Night has fully fallen when Sherlock finally turns back into Baker Street. In the orange light of the street lamps, moths and mosquitoes are fluttering excitedly as if their endeavour to reach the moon has finally born fruit.
“Some of the locals think they’re from a poisonous jellyfish. They’ve gone out to catch it before it kills someone else,” said Katie.
John knows Greg.
The thought chills Sherlock to the marrow and a thought bubbles up from the depth of his unconsciousness; that’s why he hasn’t blocked the number altogether.
“There’s music and you move to it. I’d call that dancing.”
“Bloody, fucking shit,” he bursts out, the volume of his own voice egging on his headache. “Jesus Christ.”
“I need data.”
“What do you mean? In the condition?” John asked, voice heavy with the fears catching up with him. Images of Sherlock crashing back down after a high in their bed, shivering, hurting, impaired his vision now in a tormenting dance. “Mycroft, is he— has he—?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Maybe he’s not that bright. Or he just wanted something that’s easy to pawn or sell. Perhaps he’s in desperate need for money or he got too carefree, who knows. This probably wasn’t the first time he nicked something from the Beaumonts.”
“Sherlock, you’re next,” said Greg before John could ask any follow-up questions, not completely disguising the gloating in his voice. Molly seemed to notice, too, and nudged him with her elbow.
John tries to reciprocate. “Yeah.”
“Promise. Although Viagra-laced waffles would probably make for a fun day, don’t you think?”
Something moving, a figure in the barely lit hallway leading to the kitchen, caught his attention.
Sullenly, John rolls onto his side and falls asleep.
Sherlock let his free hand wander up John’s other wrist in wavering motion. The skin exposed to the icy air, without another hand—or at least a pocket—to shield it, was already alarmingly cold. Sherlock rubbed John’s fingers in diligent circles to restore some warmth in them. Nothing was allowed to harm this man, not even Mother Nature herself. He would be there to protect him now, with everything he had. He would keep him safe and warm and happy.
“Good morning, husband,” she purrs and presses a kiss onto his shoulder.
John and Sherlock exchanged a familiar look, both put on the scent of a rather promising puzzle. Sherlock leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers under his chin with an intrigued smile while John echoed: “His shoes were missing?”
“Well, I hate to inform you but that is no longer your decision. Now, make some room.” John shoved Sherlock’s shoulder and headed for the door. He had made up his mind.
“Isn't it?”
“It’s fine. Suits you.” Sherlock grabbed John’s hand a little tighter. “I’m sorry for scaring you. I just wanted to surprise you with breakfast, as a thank-you for last night.”
This is what has given his existence a purpose, a meaning before. Maybe it can again.
“Add another finger, now!” As John gave him a questioning look, he added, almost whining: “Please, please.”
It’s a relief; being able to put a finger on the very thing scaring him so much. And yet, it hurts, like a bruise you didn’t notice until you brush over it on accident.
“You interrupt me on a very busy, urgent case because I didn’t reply to your text?” Sherlock sets his cup down a little too forcefully, spilling tea onto the saucer.
He can’t.
overreaction, made Sherlock’s throat close up. All this damn sentiment clouding his judgement. He hadn’t wasted a single thought about the effect of the little phone-throwing incident. Of course, he knew or at least strongly suspected that Mycroft still kept tabs on him. That a loss of signal under such circumstances would rather sooner than later gain his attention was comprehensible but, still, annoying. And poorly timed. Mycroft’s presence would complicate matters even further. He had to get rid of his brother, now.
John wakes to her throwing up in the bathroom, in between attacks commanding him to leave for breakfast without her. He protests weakly while he hurries to get dressed but, to his relief (and renewed shame), she insists.
The soft June breeze tousling his hair is too warm for his taste, even in the light jacket he’s wearing.
A smile bright enough to put the sun watching through the window to shame spread on Sherlock’s face. At the sight, John’s chest unclenched a little, warmed and soothed by the unmitigated joy this man kindled in him. God, how he loved him.
“Wait a second, I’ll get you something else,” John chuckled and made his way back to the table that functioned as a bar for the night.
Sherlock stared at him, half-impressed, half-affronted by his initiative. A cab pulled over and John only grinned before opening the door for Sherlock to climb in. Then he dropped down on the back seat next to him.
John has to make amends with another person close to him.
“Right. Fine,” John shrugged and Sherlock was almost certain that he heard a little chuckle accompanying his words, as his friend slid back under the covers.
“Oh.” John didn’t know how else to respond to this timid version of Sherlock. It physically hurt him to see him like this, small and ashamed and so very exhausted. As much as the day had taken its toll on John, it had certainly not spared Sherlock either—if he hadn’t received that last text, if he had found the flat empty upon his return, after such a huge fight.
“He won’t talk to you. And I won’t tell you where he is. It’s a secret. He said not to tell anybody. Especially not cops.”
This Christmas chapter is basically just cute little fluff pieces crammed into one chapter :D For those of you waiting for some angst again: It's coming, just be patient! Enjoy the fluff while it lasts :D
) as his phone buzzes on the desk. The vibration alarm is accompanied by a unique chime, announcing a text message.
Sherlock pushes the door to the sitting room open, the empty box of chocolates on the sofa an unpleasant reminder. Hastily, he throws his jacket over it before heading to the kitchen.
“Bugger the timing. I was simply a coward.”
At the same rate as John’s self-hatred grows, his affection for Mary shrinks until it is not even enough to make him think of excuses for working late or going on a run instead of having dinner together.
“Anything, John, everything,” Sherlock replied earnestly.
With a sudden realization that moulded his lips into a perfect circle, Sherlock remembered that both of them had affirmed the fantasizing-about-someone-in-the-room-statement, too. Regarding Molly, that hadn’t surprised him—everyone knew how obsessed she was with Sherlock—but, now, he suspected that he had missed something significant there.
“I know, I know. They’re hideous.”
“The Yarders will eat him alive when I’m not there to be his interpreter,” John tries again.
It was hard to resist that military authority. “Unbelievably, impossibly good,” Sherlock responded, eager to fulfil his wishes and put this newly-discovered way to stimulate his lover to the test some more. “I have never experienced such pleasure before. You have no idea how long I have dreamed of this.”
John and Sherlock want to get it on but there are some bumps in the road.
“Just because you want me home for snogging?” John asked mockingly.
Still in a huff, he trudges alongside the road, his coat collar turned up against the freezing wind, until, finally, a cab pulls over for him.
“What could
“For being an awful brother, basically.” John rubbed the back of his neck before forcing himself to fixate Harry again. He had thought about this conversation for more than the past couple of hours, had meant to tell her for years if he was being honest. It had always lingered in some abandoned corner of his mind, locked behind old grudges and self-denial. “I should’ve stood up for you, should’ve protected you. That’s what brothers are supposed to do. I was such a coward, always let you take the blame. I’m so sorry, Harry.”
“Are you still on for watching her on Tuesday?” John asks as he re-enters the kitchen and picks up Rosie’s diaper bag, unaware of Sherlock’s doings.
One should assume Sherlock would’ve gotten used to it by now, after three weeks. Or before that actually, when periods of vacancy were only briefly interrupted if anything.
“So, when you’re on a date—what happens after dinner?” Sherlock asked. He had pondered that question for some time now, without coming to a satisfactory conclusion. Even with sufficient data, the problem would be hard to solve. Ever since John had re-entered their flat, things tended to go in any direction but the one he anticipated. He was unable to prepare, to think past the next sentence of their interaction—which was enthralling but also extremely unsettling. Sherlock Holmes, the clever detective, usually five to seven steps ahead of any person he talked to, was incapable of planning his next move. He simply didn’t know what to do—and he didn’t like not knowing.
There was neither Chinese take-out nor John in his armchair when Sherlock entered the flat. Everything was dark, as usual, and Sherlock felt his insides drop with equal parts disappointment and relief. They leaped right back up the next second, however, when he noticed the gleam seeping through the crack under his bedroom door. He surely hadn’t been the one who had turned on the light. As if magnetically pulled in, Sherlock crossed the hall, not even stopping to take off his coat. He allowed himself one short pause, though, just to catch his breath and brace himself, before opening the door.
The little group made their way to the main floor and John grabbed Sherlock’s hand again, trailing him through the crowd until they found a spot where they all could move somewhat freely. Almost involuntarily, Sherlock set his feet and shoulders in motion to the throbbing beat. The song wasn’t nearly as sophisticated as the classical pieces he usually preferred but there was something urgent and untamed about it and Sherlock felt his limbs tense and relax in rhythmic response to it. This was exactly what he loved about dancing—how his body reacted to music without his brain interfering.
(wonderful live version!)
I've not written anything Mystrade-concerned but, if any of you encourage me to, I'll give it a go! :)
“What about the humiliating part though?” Sherlock asks at length, pen halting with a sudden scratch.
How could he deny Sherlock anything when he lay before him like this, naked and shaking with arousal, a thin sheet of sweat bedewing his skin. John pulled out and added some more lube before pushing back in, with two fingers now. Sherlock received him eagerly.
John called for his flatmate but no one answered. He had probably gone out for a walk with Rosie. Ever since she was teething, she was fussy almost all the time and long walks seemed to be the only thing calming her down. Still oddly irritated by the plant overhead, John began to unpack his shopping. Only minutes later, his assumption was confirmed by footsteps coming up the stairs, accompanied by Rosie’s giggles and babbling, answered by a deep velvety voice, as if in real conversation. Over these familiar sounds, John almost forgot his mistletoe-infused vexation.
“Have you talked to her?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. He cut Mycroft’s way off in the middle of the sitting room, determined to regain his territory and some control over the situation. Standing mere inches apart, each eyed the other over with swift and skilled glances, scanning for data, for a pressure point. After more than three decades of this power play between them, the rules were abundantly clear.
did you have in mind?”
He passed the prissy terraced houses with their brick-lined fronts and little oriels, brimming over with domestic life; spouses, mothers, fathers heading off to work or spending a few leave days with their children before school started again; brothers and sisters fighting over the last left-over Christmas candy; snowmen inhabiting at least half of the front lawns. The warm light that fell through most of the windows now, bathing the pavement in its glow, looked so welcoming. John wondered how many of these houses kept what their façade promised.
When nothing happens, he makes do with grabbing his jacket. He’s taken it off and thrown it over John’s empty chair after the first shock, having to cool down in both the literal and figurative sense.
“What exactly did Jason do?” John came to his aid.
“I really thought… after New Year’s Eve…,” Sherlock said, with a voice he didn’t recognize—hoarse and brittle as if it would crumble under the pressure of talking any second now. “But John denies even remembering us dancing in that club.”
With a pointed look at John, she added: “And you’re by now almost as bad as he is. I can rustle something up for you. A nice full English? You need something to take your meds with. And I still have a bit of morphine in my nightstand if you—”
Before John could even open his mouth to protest, Sherlock kept lamenting. “And what am I even good for if I can’t work? That’s all I’ve ever wanted, all I’ve ever been good at. We both know that. That’s what brought you to me after all, didn’t it? The puzzles and the chases. All I’ve ever contributed to this relationship was the cases and the danger and the adrenaline—and if I can’t give you that—”
A tiny snore escaped Sherlock’s full lips as he readjusted his head on the car window and John forcefully pulled his mind away from the tempting cool depths of his thoughts. He couldn’t allow his conscience to plunge into these waters. The risk that he might succumb to them, slowly sink deeper, and never come back up for air was just too high. John took a deep breath as to remind himself that there was still oxygen around him and focused back on the street.
“How’s Cal? And Laney? What will happen to her now?” John asked, walking as fast as the fatigue and his injury allowed.
John positioned himself between his legs and closed his lips around Sherlock’s pulsating cock, applying the slightest bit of suction. The world dwindled to the animalistic sounds escaping Sherlock’s chest as he began to move. It was new. It was different. It was fulfillment.
, it whispers and John is gripped by the recurring impulse to smash it into a thousand tiny pieces.
This chapter's song is:
“Yep. And he had three cracked ribs but there were no other signs of any kind of assault, except for the bruises on his knees when he presumably fell over,” Greg added.
“But you know how all of this works. You’ve been on dates before, hundreds of them,” Sherlock whinged, pulling his lips into a pout.
still looks like walls with bullet holes and union jack pillows and earphones on a bison skull to him.
“I’m just saying that your dating life now affects more than just yourself. So, you should consider raising your standards. A materialistic bigot with a smoking habit and an obvious thing for single fathers might be an acceptable option for a quick shag if you’re in such a need for one, but highly unsuitable to have around a small child, don’t you think?”
“Did I do something wrong?”
“Alright, alright, I’m already gone,” she sings and scurries down the stairs with a cheeky spring in her step Sherlock wouldn’t have thought possible, with her bad hip and all.
“You better see for yourself,” Mrs. Hudson said, words barely hiding her indignation. “They shooed me away as I wanted to bring up the tea.”
He’ll be fine. Eventually.
The grin apparently chiselled into his skull, he waits for Rosie to wake up, plans already forming into fantastic scenarios in his mind. He’s all but vibrating with excitement.
Something shifted in John’s eyes at his words. “Is that why you fainted? Because I touched you?”
It’s pathetic, to cling to his old life like this. He’s always despised people who reminisced, who refused to let go of whatever grandeur the past had held for them.
“Sherlock, John, everything alright?”
The DI had been unusually quiet for the past few hours, observing Sherlock carefully, contemplating everything he said with the same unmoving frown anchored at his brows. Sherlock looked up at him through his dark curls.
A hand on his jacket holds him back.
He plugs his headphones in. Fingers steadied by the warm buzz of alcohol, he slots in the DVD and, after another sip, presses play.
He turns the corner into the entrance hall, bumping into a woman. Ignoring her angry “Excuse you!”, he rushes past her and out into the winter air.
“Jason was definitely dragged to the shed, based on the furrows here. He was already dead by then; the reanimation wasn’t successful. The other person present sat him up against the shed and removed his jacket.”
The two seconds it takes her to answer are tearing at John’s patience with force.
He fishes his phone out of his pocket and checks it for missed calls and messages. Surely, John would’ve contacted him before Mrs Hudson if he needed a babysitter.
“With a baby?” she asked quizzically.
After a few seconds—or maybe months—they drew apart again, both gasping for air. Sherlock let his forehead rest on John’s and felt another tear of joy roll down and drop to John’s chin. A bright, somewhat relieved smile blossomed between them, forming a protective bubble of warmth and adoration against the snow storm.
Mary’s words, uttered only a few weeks ago, cross his mind again.
His headache has finally given up and made room for a nagging, ever-present hum. He tries not to listen too closely and heaves himself out of bed.
“I love you.”
“John,” he replied and they exchanged quick smiles.
“You’re her dad, John, she knows that,” Sherlock said in a serious tone, unresponsive to John’s joke.
On his way home, Sherlock stops three more times, relishing each cigarette between his lips while the sunbeams warming his face slowly get lost between the buildings. As he enters Regent’s Park again, runners and people with their dogs passing him by, the sky above has already changed from a radiant pink to an intense, rapidly darkening blue.
The physical exhaustion doesn’t silence the voices in his head but it lets them converge to one focused thought: Whatever is on that DVD, it can’t make things worse.
The lines around Mr. Beaumont’s mouth deepened. “He had made a habit out of taking things that didn’t belong to him. Mobile phones, clothes, video games… But, as I said, he received his punishment and mended his ways. We just thought—since it was only a youthful folly and these things can ruin a young boy’s perspectives so easily, you know how it is—that we’d keep it out of the files.”
Hey you :)
His mind was in high gear, acting out every single one of John’s possible reactions to his proposition. With every passing second, Sherlock felt more stupid to have sent the text at all. Why, God,
John can’t help but laugh. It’s a joyless, sceptical snort and it hurts in his throat as if it were coated in acid. “What’s all this with the mysterious attitude? Has Sherlock put you up to this?”
His mind is an ever-racing, ever-running machine, knowing neither rest nor closing time. Its lights are always blinking, engines always groaning, the conveyers transporting a ceaseless series of ideas from one hemisphere to the other through a maze of tangled synapses until they finally dump them into Sherlock’s consciousness.
Greg’s eyes widen in an unspoken warning to keep his voice down before he reiterates slowly: “If you’ve had other—options, would that change anything? Or would you have chosen Mary no matter what?”
It's Sherlock's birthday and all he wishes for is some time alone with John.
“Care to let us join you in your funny little head, Sherlock?” Greg chimed in, shoving his hands deeper into his pockets.
He slams the door behind her with a dramatic swish of his dressing gown and stomps over to where the golden light of the early evening sun floods through the window.
“This is not about
I hope you guys liked some more of that Mollstrade sweetness because I adore those two together <3 And I hope you're not tired yet of Sherlock's POV because discovering all the layers of repressed emotion is just fascinating for me and I just can't stop :D
Having put Sherlock on the sofa and feeling as if he has redeemed himself at least a little after all Sherlock has put him through today, Greg turns to leave once more.
The guests giggle and Hannah lets out an approving squeak.
“Let’s hope that knowledge will ease their pain,” John said and gently stroked his fiancé’s lower back. Sherlock was obviously still distraught by the whole case, tense underneath the fabric of his shirt.
John chuckled in disbelief and texted Greg to come by 221B sometime tomorrow. Sherlock postponing a case to play with Rosie was almost too good to be true. He took another sip of his chocolate and admired the white cloak covering the earth, sparkling like a myriad of diamonds as the sun reached out for it.
, the trivial part of his brain reminds him.
In light of this new, almost mindful Sherlock, John’s and Rosie’s return to 221B Baker Street had been a breeze. As soon as John set foot into 221B later that remarkable November day, he knew that things were going to be okay. Being back in one flat with Sherlock felt like lapsing into a hot bath after being outside in the cold for far too long; the tension immediately drained out of them both as they relaxed into what seemed nothing short of their natural habitat. From this point on, everything around them just flowed smoothly; The lease on the house John had lived in with Mary could be terminated remarkably fast although John suspected that Mycroft had pulled some strings in that matter. In one of the most ridiculous and blissful afternoons of John’s entire life, they had painted Rosie’s nursery in a light daffodil yellow and Sherlock had singlehandedly fixed a bordure of cute little bumblebees to the wall. Even the issue of the shared bedroom had resolved itself.
“Oh.” It was barely more than a puff of air escaping plush lips.
“Harry, please stay. Alright? I’m trying to tell you,” he started again, reaching over the table for her hand, “that I am bisexual.”
He’s only a few yards away from 221B, when he notices something moving in the shadow thrown by Speedy’s awning; a figure shifting in front of the door. Against the dark wood, its silhouette is hard to make out.
“Noooo,” Sherlock whined and buried his head in John’s lap. Drawing in a sharp breath, John quickly fought down the beast in his groin that raised its head curiously at the close proximity of Sherlock’s face. That had to wait.
It is hard to tell, it always is with Sherlock. And even if John is sure that he has gotten closer to Sherlock than maybe any other person, he still is far from having him all figured out. Sherlock is too good of an actor, has mastered the art of concealing his true thoughts and feelings too perfectly for anyone to penetrate his mask.
“Oh, sorry.” Sherlock quickly retreated but John frowned and quickly added: “No, s’nice.”
“This was nice, wasn’t it?” John said as he carried the dirty glasses to the sink. Despite Mrs. Hudson’s affirmation, their guests had stayed for several hours, engaging in pleasant conversation, eating cake and coaxing the story of their reconciliation out of John and Sherlock. It was already dark out when Molly and Greg finally packed Rosie’s stuff up and left together with Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson, the latter shaking with insuppressible giggles.
I’m sorry, Sherlock. Please just come home and talk to me.
“Yeah, because you usually mix some kind of chemicals in my food for experiments.” John stopped their dancing for a second, looking at Sherlock askance. “I do hope that stops now.”
Quickly, he steps into the warmth of the hallway and pulls out a piece of paper, too thick to be a receipt or a forgotten shopping list. It’s smooth, stiffer and more expensive than the pads John uses at the clinic, and has been folded several times.
Greg raises his free hand. “You know what, stumble into traffic for all I care. At least, then you won’t have to do the speech tomorrow. I was just trying to be a good friend but I’m done here.”
“I’ll call him when we’ve found something.”
“We’ll just try again in the morning and give out a search warrant for Calvin Rowley,” Lestrade said. Sherlock could see his craving for a cigarette in the twitching of his fingers.
“Like this,” Sherlock gasped out, rolling fully onto his back and pulling his knees up, “need to see you.”
,” John continued, reverberating Sherlock’s smile even brighter upon meeting the pallid eyes hovering above him. He radiated a warmth that had nothing to do with the fever. Sherlock’s heart skipped a beat.
“Yep.”
John’s alarm melted into a relieved chuckle but, at the sight of Sherlock’s oblivious face, he swallowed it quickly to avoid any further questions about
John’s head shoots back up again. “So, you’ve slept with her and that made you realize—”
The song our boys are dancing to:
With sudden mortification, he realises that he hasn’t thought any further than this. He’s put the alarm system in place but there’s no further plan of action.
“He’s here then?”
“Did he get violent around you, too?” Sherlock’s voice matched the dismay on his face.
“No,” she protested, fear rising in her eyes, along with tears. “No, please. I don’t want to go back there. He said I never have to go back. He said we’d go away together.”
“So, Greg said you are something like his live-in PA?” Katie teased and fixed her eyes on Sherlock again.
“Why?”
A burst of those little intimate chuckles which were so often frowned upon at crime scenes filled the kitchen as Sherlock pulled him close again and let his hips playfully grind against John’s body.
Greg looks distraught, nervous. He hasn’t shaved and the purplish shadows under his eyes betray that he hasn’t slept much either. His car is parked behind him, one tyre up on the kerb.
John snorted approvingly. “That would make press conferences rather awkward.”
John was gone. Rosie was gone. They were gone. John had fled, had abandoned him. And he had taken all of the oxygen with him. Sherlock’s breath sped up but there was nothing left to reach his begging lungs, no matter how desperately he sucked in the air. He would suffocate. He would die right here on their sitting room floor, surrounded by their armchairs. He would turn blue and suffocate and then crumble to ashes, to dust particles dancing in the spiralling room until no trace was left of Sherlock Holmes.
—, most of them already jingled. Sherlock recognized a few faces from Scotland Yard but was pleased to see that neither Donovan nor Anderson was anywhere to be found. He presented Lestrade—
For a second, his expression slips. Greg can see the heartache painted all over Sherlock’s features before he ducks his head to the almost empty plate of chips.
Hey y'all,
John brings his hand up to pinch the bridge of his nose, his voice forcedly calm as he continues. “You told me on that very first night that you don’t do dating, that you’re not wired that way. That you weren’t interested. So, I decided to just get over it and deal with it, with negligible success. But it was enough just to be around you. It was more than the life I had bargained for and I loved it, loved you.”
The gravity of his voice makes John’s skin crawl.
The ticking clock on the sitting room wall was the only thing to stir the thick syrupy silence surrounding Sherlock as he lay there and stared at the dark ceiling. The sofa was several inches too short to actually fit the whole of his sprawled body on it so that his feet dangled over the edge. The house around him produced the strangest noises, distorting the shadows of the furniture into malicious figures slowly creeping closer. Even if he had wanted to, he couldn’t possibly sleep like this. Sherlock rammed his eyes shut, wishing himself back to times when a loving parent would console him whenever he couldn’t relax at night.
He’ll make the best of it. That’s all he can do, really. He loves Mary, he really does, so, he can learn to love the baby and the new life it brings. A lot of parents probably would’ve never thought they want children and still love them once they’re in the world. Surely, John will be one of them.
Sherlock turned his back on John and submerged his hands in his own dark curls, violently pulling, as if the sharp pain on his scalp could release some of the pressure that threatened to choke him from the inside. He pressed his eyes shut and, to his alarm, felt tears prickle on their corners. He said it. After years of stubborn silence, after burying the memories as deep as he could, he had smacked John right in the face with them. But what did it matter anyway? What did it matter now? Sooner or later, he would lose him again to some random woman.
“Do you want to back out?”
It had seemed paramount to put in some security measures against the memories, the tiniest of walls to keep out the nauseating feeling of loss.
“Do you think this has been easy for me?” Sherlock spits with one finger raised accusatorily. “Do you think I rejoiced at the thought of seeing you marry someone else, of seeing you happy with someone else? I tried, I really did try to the best of my abilities to make this work for you. And I don’t think you can tell me otherwise.”
He knows that something is up as soon as he enters the hall.
No, John didn’t want to fall asleep—for what dreams could possibly live up to this reality?
Mrs Hudson’s care knows neither end nor logic, Sherlock notes again, rolling his eyes once more.
Instead of snapping at John, Sherlock now followed a new approach altogether: He tried to reciprocate these acts up to his own capability—which didn’t allow for much, really. Pleasing people was not Sherlock’s strong suit; that had been made clear throughout his entire life. Yet, there had to be ways for him to show John how much he loved having him around again but, as always, Sherlock couldn’t quite figure out what made John Watson tick.
Sherlock knew that spending time in John’s room seldom brought great new insights but it still was his favourite place in the mind palace. Here, he could enjoy John’s company, replay his most treasured memories, even though he knew that he was dwelling on a dream that might never actually come true. There were days when he still believed, when he reviewed his material and could almost bring himself to think that it would take just a few more weeks, a few more months. On these days, he would spend hours upon hours in this room and count his blessings to remain patient. Then, there were days like this; days when Sherlock wanted to cry and scream and break everything he could get his hands on; days when his frustration threatened to burst out of him, hurling sharp broken fragments of himself like pieces of shrapnel, and wound everyone around him; days when he longed for the hollowness of a good dosage only to stop feeling.
Greg gives Sherlock a side glance as they walk in silence.
This chapter's song is:
John pulls on his sock with a speed evocative of a geriatric sloth. “Go ahead. I’m gonna need a minute.”
Sherlock knows.
When they each lay in their respective bed—although Sherlock’s rearrangement of the furniture had rendered the distinction between them futile—John checked his phone for messages from Molly or Mrs. Hudson. He felt a sting of guilt because he hadn’t managed to call at a reasonable hour to ask about Rosie. Hopefully, she was still too young to remember that he abandoned her occasionally.
“So, this is a date?”
“Do you need glasses, Dr. Watson?” Sherlock teased and shoved his shoulder into John’s.
“Good?” John asked with a proud twinkling in his eyes.
“No, Sherlock, I haven’t done this. Ever. With anybody.”
Sherlock’s long dark lashes sank onto his cheeks, his voice hoarse and so small: “I don’t know.”
Love, Actually
“Well, isn’t she a cutie?” The stranger looked at Rosie and stepped closer. She was pretty, her cheeks pink from frost and the physical strain of running.
“Sherlock, please, you’re right, okay?” John tries to mollify him, his fury given way to something else, but Sherlock doesn’t want to hear, doesn’t want to stop the torrent of words he’s suppressed so long. He begins to pace the sitting room.
"Okay," Sherlock replied, a little dumbfounded.
John’s hand left Sherlock’s face in an interruptive gesture, his voice jumping up an octave: “You googled anal sex while babysitting Rosie?”
John only grinned and opened the top drawer of the little side table next to the door. He handed Sherlock a small package, wrapped in dark-blue paper that instantly evoked the image of strained fabric against golden skin and made Sherlock’s mouth water. How could John make him interact with other people today when all he really wanted for his birthday were hours upon hours alone with John and his delicious body?
The creases on John’s forehead smooth out as his mouth turns up into a sheepish smile. “I love you, you idiot.”
Did you enjoy this fluffy little thing? I surely loved writing it :) As you can see, our boys are taking things slowly. I hope you don't lose your patience with them (or me).
What’s done is done, he thinks as he opens the door to join Mary for breakfast. Either move with it or drown.
, his mind spiraled. Mycroft had been so right; Caring was not an advantage. It just disabled any rational thought.
“Your wife had just died. And you had grieved Sherlock’s death for what—two years? It’s no wonder you were in such a bad place and snapped,” Harry said and, at John’s expression, quickly added: “I’m not approving of it but I can… understand. And I’m sure Sherlock does too.”
“Would— would you be my best man?”
Eventually, his tears ebb away but Sherlock continues stroking patterns into the fabric of his shirt. John snivels a couple of times and his hair tickles Sherlock's neck.
It is this smile, this fond and somewhat sheepish expression that flashes over John’s face every now and then that is driving Sherlock insane, that makes watching and waiting and wishing just not good enough anymore.
“Go ahead,” Sherlock waves and, as a matter of course, he reaches out to receive a wriggling Rosie.
. He needed him, now.
“Yes. Leave. Now,” Sherlock said sternly, adding an almost affectionate “Please” while grabbing his brother’s coat from one of the kitchen chairs and gently nudging him out of the door.
John exhaled sharply, letting the bile simmering in his gut evaporate in the bleak air.
On the other hand, Sherlock seems actually distressed and as much as Greg wants to strangle him sometimes, he’s sworn to protect him, no matter what, when Sherlock rose from the dead. Emotional pain counts too, doesn’t it?
John propped himself up on his elbows. “My trust?
“I forgot to ask: What do
“I’m sure John genuinely loves you, Sherlock,” Greg says, at last, cringing at his own tone. “You’re so important to him. You should’ve seen him when you were gone. He was devastated for months, years even. He cares so much about you. If that isn’t love, I don’t know what is.”
“You heard me perfectly,” Sherlock replied nonchalantly in hopes to conceal the frustration and discomfort this unfortunate slip had hurled at him. He bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood.
He knows he must tread lightly now. Not his strong suit, if he’s honest. Maybe he shouldn’t say anything at all, just let Sherlock live through this drunken soul-baring and act as if nothing has happened tomorrow. That would be for the best, right?
“I know I fucked it all up and I have no idea how to fix it. Sherlock, I’m sorry, I really am so, so sorry. I just—”
“I’m waiting,” Sherlock teased and broke John’s paralysis. He pulled out the lube and a pack of condoms and threw them at Sherlock, who was still giggling, before climbing on top of him, straddling his hips and securing his hands above his head in a swift motion. Sherlock’s snicker made way for a surprised gasp and his eyes visibly darkened as he stared up at John, the unexpected friction of their bodies sending mutual shivers down their spines.
He looks at his husband, a smile as bright as the sun on his face, and John beams back at him.
“Can you please just tell me what you want? Please.”
“Oi, wait a fucking minute!”
The sight warms Sherlock more than the fire.
“Of course, I do. Probably since the day I met you. It was always you, John, always just you.”
John took out his gun as they opened the door. Behind it lay a hall stuffed with giant storage boxes and euro-pallets. In the back, a staircase led to another floor, from which creaking steps could be heard. Sherlock pointed at the ceiling, then brought his finger to his lips. John nodded, determination glowing in his eyes. Carefully, they ascended.
“Who’s texting you?”
to tag along. That’s how little you thought of me.“
“Alright there?” John asked with a half-concerned giggle, not entirely able to fix his eyes on Sherlock’s. He was buzzed, that was for sure. Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle as memories from the last time they had been this drunk together passed in front of his inner eye. The way John’s inhibitions came crumbling down when he drank was almost tempting enough to spice up John’s tea every now and then.
To make matters worse, the daytime began to soar up to new heights of discomfort. While John at least found some rest in their nightly closeness, his brain relying now on Sherlock’s presence rather than a bottle to keep the monsters at bay, Sherlock’s state seemed to worsen even further with every passing day. He was distant, moody, and unusually quiet. His cheeks grew hollower and his eyes were now permanently reddened and bloodshot as if he had been crying. More often than not, he left in the early morning or locked himself up in his room all day. Only the clicking sound of the key turning back each night gave John an unmistakable sign that he was still welcomed to share his bed. Sometimes he retreated to his own bed, nevertheless, just to give Sherlock an out if he wanted one, only to find his friend cuddling up to him a few hours later.
“Drinking game. You state something that you’ve never done in your life and anyone who has done it has to drink,” explained John.
? The realization hit Sherlock with the intensity of a wrecking ball. The air was forced out of his lungs, leaving them crumpled and so tightly compressed that they dangled in his chest, with miles and miles of dusty emptiness around them. The sitting room seemed to secede from the laws of physics, spinning and twisting on the edges of his vision.
, Sherlock wrote on his mental checklist. He could still adjust the amount according to John’s reaction later on. Satisfied with his results and a little proud, Sherlock lay in the dark and felt a grin perk up the corners of his mouth.
, their brilliant!
in trouble? In real danger even?
John buried a hand in dark curls, determined to prevent the end of the kiss by force if must be, and let his tongue slip into Sherlock’s welcoming mouth, being met by the most delicious moan. Raising up onto his toes to bring their bodies flush, John let his other hand glide downwards until his fingers found a marvellously tight butt to grab, barely covered by a thin layer of fabric. Slender fingers worked up and down his own back with swift and artful movements, leaving the skin beneath them burning with want. John pressed his rapidly growing erection into Sherlock, letting out a satisfied growl when he found that the outline of Sherlock’s hard cock was already straining his pyjama bottoms. He would have that for breakfast, right here on the kitchen table until Sherlock would pant and cry and beg for sweet release.
In the dimness, he can’t make out a thing but he doesn’t want to wake up Rosie by turning on a light. Trying to get his heart rate to slow down, John feels his way up the stairs and carefully peels Rosie out of his coat and the wrap. She snoozes on, only letting out muffled groans as he gets her ready for bed and places her in her crib.
He caught Sherlock’s plush lips in a hard kiss, hand finding its way into dark curls, tongue demanding entrance. All mocking aside, John thought, having hours and days between cases to just do
It’s refreshing to see Sherlock care so much, to see him try so hard to measure up to the responsibility he’s been entrusted with, to see him make an effort to live up to John’s high opinion of him.
It was not even eight o’clock yet. Waiting for another hour out there in the cold or walking back to find a café or bakery that was already open—neither a satisfying option. John looked around in the grey half-light that announced the arrival of the winter sun. There was only an elderly man walking his dog in sight. John steered the pushchair back to the end of the fence, where an unguarded footpath led directly onto the grounds, and entered the cemetery. The chances that some guard would stop him at this hour were negligibly small. And if he was completely honest, he’d rather there weren’t any other visitors around for what he planned on doing.
“The lights are on now,” John said, intertwining their fingers in an assertive motion and stepping even closer.
John swallows.
, the rational part of his mind whispered in the darkness surrounding him,
John threw one arm around Sherlock’s shoulder and pulled him into a hug that the other readily sank into. He would show Sherlock how wrong he was. He would prove to him how loved he was until the image of this Alex was nothing but a faded scar on kiss-covered skin—even if it was the last thing he ever did.
“I—What?” John asks again. What is all this talk about options? “Greg, what is going on? Just tell me.”
Phillip Phillips, Gone Gone Gone.
Before Sherlock could object any further, John grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. Somehow, those drinks John had offered him continuously all night seemed to heighten Sherlock’s touch perception even further. From where John’s fingers were wrapped around his own, a tingling made his way across his skin in electric waves. Sherlock wobbled a little with the thrilling sensation but John seemed to ascribe it to his level of intoxication and steadied him by putting his arm around Sherlock’s waist. That didn’t exactly help.
Mary sits up a little. “Yeah, I’ve realised that we haven’t really had a chance to talk about it. But it’s great, don’t you think? I’ve always wanted a real family and now we will be one.” She gives him a weak but genuine smile.
This chapter's song is:
It took another week before they first touched. John couldn’t even remember who had come to whose room that night. He only recalled the feeling of his hand brushing against Sherlock’s under the covers, the pitch-black silence around them offering a welcomed disguise for this most unthinkable deed. Tentatively reaching out, exploring this new territory, they wrapped their fingers around each other. John’s heartbeat drummed a savage rhythm upon this innocent yet world-altering touch. As he fell asleep that night, hours later and still holding Sherlock’s hand, he felt a bit of the weight lift off his shoulders.
Greg visibly bit the inside of his cheek before he answered. “Who are we looking for, Sherlock?”
And they were back in Baker Street, behind closed curtains, a sweet violin tune playing. John’s brows were now slightly puckered in concentration while the alcohol gently clouded his eyes. He had insisted on them having a drink to loosen them up a little and reduce the awkwardness of the situation. Sherlock laid his hand in Mind-John’s and desperately recalled the sensation of the other man’s fingers resting on his waist as they moved through the waltz. On the last few notes, John bent him back, Sherlock’s weight not troubling his strong arms. His face hovering over Sherlock’s displayed equal parts of pride and bashfulness.
“Let’s just try to keep out of the yellow press for at least a bit, alright?”
He stepped out on the curb in front of the Yard and felt freezing, steady rain needling his face. In any other weather, he would have considered walking home, just to waste some more time.
“Well then?” Greg eggs him on, palms presented in a gesture of
“Me too. But the best part is waking up with you like this.”
For a few seconds, Sherlock’s eyes stumbled through the messages John had sent him, shining icy blue in the display’s cold light.
“It’s fine, thank you, Mrs. H,” John declined. “We’ll just go to bed if you don’t mind.”
“It can only be days until her first word,” Sherlock remarked.
Sherlock has overlooked imminent danger once before (
“I didn’t steal anything!” Cal protested. “Jason gave it to me, all of these things. He said his parents wouldn’t notice… and I needed the money. He… he just wanted to help me.”
“I guess,” Sherlock admitted, then sheepishly adding: “Tell me again.”
“We’re down to
Hello dearest readers,
As they reached the playground, the sun had retreated entirely. John shot worrying glances up to the clouds that gradually changed to a darker shade of grey. Just as Rosie sat on the toddler swings, the sky opened up and it began to snow. Thick fluffy flakes waltzed to an unheard melody and settled on every surface, hushing the world with their soft embrace. Sherlock took Rosie in his arms as she tried to catch the snowflakes with her hands and then her tongue. He let one icy crystal land on his bare finger where it melted and Rosie’s eyes grew big in awe. John just stood there and watched his daughter laugh and cheer while the snowflakes slowly nestled in Sherlock’s hair. The little white patches offered an enchanting contrast on his dark curls and John could hardly fathom how stunningly, how devastatingly beautiful he was. As Sherlock’s eyes met his gaze, his brightly beaming smile shifted into something calmer but not less happy. John would have given his life to keep these two, the people who occupied every last nook of his heart, as happy and content as they were in this moment. Gravitationally pulled to the center of his universe, John stepped closer, barely resisting the urge to bury his hands in Sherlock’s snow-covered hair and pull him close, closer. And he wanted to tell him. Tell him, how his life was nothing without him in it, how he cherished every precious moment with him, how they were together now and he would never let anything come between them again.
“And?”
“I can’t,” Greg says and he looks so haunted that John believes him. “I’ve no right to tell you. But I promise you it will open your eyes. The thing is, afterwards, you can’t close them again. You can’t unsee this. So, I’m telling you: Consider carefully.”
He stayed in his room or roamed London for as long as he could possibly allow himself, only returning after twilight when the darkness offered cover for his wasting heart. John took the hint, turning off the lights in their flat as well. It made it easier for him too, Sherlock guessed. Pretending was less difficult when your eyes didn’t betray you.
They stopped by the car. “You’ll need an official statement from us then, won’t you?”
Natalie Taylor, Surrender.
Greg looks at him in surprise. “Oh, okay.”
He was drinking too much, he knew it. But the alcohol exquisitely numbed the world’s sharp edges, especially at night. John had been tormented by nightmares for so many years now that they had become a nuisance he had barely noticed anymore. Since Mary’s death, however, the dreams had become more vivid, more detailed, more brutal. As soon as he closed his eyes, the familiar images of a blazing sun and screaming bullets mixed with Sherlock’s falling figure, blood streaming over the pavement and filling the well he was drowning in. For months, he hadn’t found a single night of unencumbered sleep, except when he was black-out drunk. With whisky saturating his bloodstream, he spent the nightly hours in blessed unconsciousness that unfortunately lacked permanence and made him long for its eternal cousin as soon as morning came.
For a few minutes, blissful, sated silence covers them again. Sherlock relishes in the calm movement of John’s body beneath his, the waxing and waning of his breath, and considers letting slumber take him for a few hours. It’s a tempting prospect to simply drift off, being held so closely, so safely, so lovingly.
Holmes. But there was simply no scenario he could think of that could have diffused the situation. Well, John would probably have figured out an easy and low-risk way to handle things like
He wants to run with the storm. It’s where he belongs.
“How about My Holmesboy? Or Sherlucky?” John kept teasing.
“Yeah but he’s not home, hasn’t been for a couple of days.”
Lestrade gave him a sharp look. “
“Still, you are definitely more experienced in this area than I am. I don’t want to cross some invisible border or accidentally hurt you or do something wrong just because I don’t know anything about romantic entanglement. There is so much at stake—our life as we know it and Rosie’s and The Work and… I will most certainly mess this up and then you will hate me and I will lose you—”
Both John and Sherlock froze in the middle of their movement. Rosie grinned proudly at her father and opened her mouth again. “Jaw—”
“Don’t you see?” Sherlock said and dove into a ramble. “The café is right around the corner where we lost Cal. Their parents’ home is in a completely different part of town. How did Laney get there? Why was she there in the middle of the night? Probably to meet with her brother.
His voice drifted off as he re-joined his wife on the sofa and reached for her hand. A quiet whimper escaped her lips before she buried her face in a handkerchief. Mr. Beaumont quickly regained his composure and focused on John and Sherlock again. “Tea?”
“You want to take pictures?” he asked through a bright smile and looked up to Sherlock.
“John?” Sherlock answered and simultaneously fumbled for the bedside lamp to finally see John’s expression.
The fact that Sherlock can virtually stuff himself with cookies without gaining a single pound has been the one trump card he’s been holding against Mycroft growing up—a fact that might’ve fostered Mycroft’s attempts to drum the negative effects of digestion on brainwork into Sherlock’s head.
“I… must’ve taken it off and then forgot to put it back on,” he mumbled at the realization that he couldn’t even remember when that had happened and rubbed his ring finger.
John’s fears or hopes—or whatever it is that’s currently dancing before his eyes—are coming true when Sherlock clears his throat and speaks to the camera: “John, you know I’m neither particularly skilled nor experienced when revealing my emotions. Victor Hugo once said
The image of John’s face cooled the snug atmosphere of Molly’s flat perceptibly. Sherlock shivered. John’s features, hard and unmoving like concrete, had offered just another pavement for Sherlock to shatter on—this time for real. He had fallen for John Watson and broken every single bone upon landing. Warm gooey streams of blood ran over his face. He could feel it. Sherlock lifted his hand and scraped over his wet cheek. Nothing red shone on his fingertips, only clear liquid loss.
“I said yes, of course,” Sherlock grinned, wiping his face again.
Sherlock stares at the screen as the words take their time to penetrate the wall of panic around his brain.
Oh, how kind they all are to him, showering him with biscuits and cold cases and body parts like a child with scraped knees who’s kept from crying by waving a shiny, new toy before its eyes.
“Not directly, no.”
“I’ll… think about it, Sherlock. It’s a nice offer, really.” He finally got his feet to move again and they resumed their walk in quietude. John was grateful for the opportunity to be alone with his thoughts. Sherlock was one of the few people with whom mutual silence wasn’t uncomfortable and he loved that about him. His offer had genuinely moved John although he doubted that that had been Sherlock’s intention. He was just being practical, following his code of logic, as usual, John assumed. But, still… It wasn’t the mere thought that Sherlock was willing to stoop to taking money for his services but rather the gesture of appreciation implied in it that filled John’s insides with warm, honey-golden contentment. Every time Sherlock made some kind of commitment, somehow recognized John’s role in his life, he couldn’t help but be excited. It was almost pathetic how much he craved this sense of approval. Had he been in the same situation with any other human being, the depth of their connection would be unquestionable. But with Sherlock you could never be sure, could you?
“They’re my favourite. How did you—”
And when she had brought him his tea that morning she’d even bitten back an ‘I told you so’, despite her foreboding speech the day before.
At the sight, John’s heart hit the ground, a heavy thud muffled by the carpet. With the force of a million missed opportunities, pent-up for far too long and now finally breaking loose, he cried: “Because I love you, Sherlock. In every way possible. In every way one person can love another and a thousand ways more. I love you so much that it scares me to death, that it shakes me to my core. I am terrified. But, God, I love you and I don’t want anyone else to raise Rosie with me. You two are the only family I will ever need.”
“You don’t have to take her home. You can stay if you want to. Sleep on the couch or—,” Sherlock trailed off with a vague gesture and quickly nipped at his tea.
“I loved her, okay?” John swallows heavily. “Just not fully, not the way—”
John sucks in the air again, straightening his posture as if readying himself for battle, and Sherlock braces himself for the words that inevitably have to follow.
“He should be used to it by now.”
“I know I don’t come around as often as I should. You’re not even the first grave I’m visiting today,” John said with a pained little chuckle as he bent down in front of the marble tombstone and let Rosie’s little hands place the posy on the ground. “I really haven’t been the best widower so far and you know how sorry I am about that. I even forgot to wear my ring. I really didn’t mean this to happen, not consciously at least, but I… I just can’t stop myself from moving on, Mary.”
Having to deal with this is just too much pain.
It just won’t do.
When they drew apart again, Sherlock still looked endearingly dumbfounded. “But—”
, John’s voice whispered in his ear, and Sherlock wanted to scream, to cry his name into the unforgiving night sky, and beg for his life back; the way it had been before John Watson, even if he could only have the cursed half-life between usage and rehab. Everything, anything, was better than this heartache that devoured his sanity with an insatiable appetite.
Sherlock needs distraction, something to feed the hungry furnaces in his head, something hard, a piece of metal for his intellectual forges to shape into theories as sharp as swords.
Sherlock felt the lump rise in his throat again, coarse and painful. Pictures unfolded before his eyes: of a familiar, beloved little body lying on the ground, skin just as white as the snow surrounding it, blonde curls covering a blank face, tiny fingers limp, never holding on to his hand again.
The door falls shut behind her and John bites his lip.
He really ought to get rid of that thing.
Sherlock raises his eyes to the sky, now midnight blue and speckled with stars. How tiny and irrelevant his problems seem in the face of such beauty.
“You should go too, I don’t want you to be sick,” John said softly as if to highlight Sherlock’s thoughts.
The sex holiday is long over and Sherlock has successfully restrained himself from hacking into the hotel spa’s booking system and moving all appointments to clashing time slots.
Sherlock stared up at him, admiring the way the light drew patterns on John’s face. No one in the history of the world had ever looked more serene or happy. Except for himself maybe.
Finally, John’s body lost tension and slumped into a little trembling mess of limbs on the cold floor tiles. With weak hands, he flushed the toilet and turned around to look at Sherlock, who still gawked at him with bright blue eyes wide open in distress.
“That’d be great, thank you.”
we’ve arrested him. I don’t need you standing in the way.”
John’s encouraging laugh failed to cheer up Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
He’s the conductor of lightning.
Did you talk to Sherlock?
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock’s eyes went wide. His lips opened, closed, and opened again but before he could muster another apology John leaned in and kissed him. It took a second before Sherlock reciprocated, the tension slowly melting under John’s tender tongue.
, John thinks,
. And John would love him. That was too good to be true. Tears were now freely flowing over his cheeks although he couldn’t quite tell if they fed on happiness or something else.
When Sherlock doesn’t respond, Greg switches his own empty glass with Sherlock’s. “Never mind. Just go get yourself something else.”
“It’s a lot, though.” John sounds almost apologetically. “Saved it all up for some years now.”
But it was not only the naked John-look-alike that drew Sherlock into the movie, now. Some of the scenes were genuinely funny, the score was beautiful, and the message it conveyed, too, appealed to him—yet, he still tried to keep up an unmoved expression. John didn’t need to know that he actually enjoyed this.
While Greg got up to fetch some drinks for John and himself, Stella tried to convince others to participate as well. A curvy blonde with heavy make-up that introduced herself as Esther and her friend, a caramel-skinned woman—
Could it be…?
He felt John’s pleased gaze on him as he dug into the pasta and chewed with a probably less dignified but all the happier expression on his face. Sherlock had barely ever been able to relate to John’s indulgence concerning food but, oh, this was good. After a few minutes filled with almost desperate bites that satisfied the worst cravings, John put down his fork, raised his wine glass, and indicated Sherlock to follow suit.
“You’ll have to stop right now, you know?” John said, grinning in the dark.
Until Cal raised his gaze and met his. Eyes like glimmering bits of coal stared at him, full of fear, of desperation, of anger, of determination, of –
“I know,” Sherlock exhales and lets his cheek sink onto John’s head. The scent of his shampoo fills his lungs and makes him slightly dizzy. “But it is what it is.”
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s thigh in a tender motion, lingering. Every touch from his friend still set Sherlock’s nerves on fire, but over the past months he had become accustomed enough to it to prevent his muscles from twitching or tensing under John’s fingers—a reaction John seemed to interpret as disapproval every single time, leading him to end the contact immediately. If he only knew how much Sherlock craved these innocent brushes and squeezes and pats. Yes, if he only knew.
He was all that existed, his name engraved on bones and nerves, and his lips on Sherlock’s. The sound of his blood rushed in his ears; a river, wild and dark and deep with desire. John’s smell, his taste, the way his unshaven skin rubbed on Sherlock’s; The universe dwindled to this one focal point with astounding speed. White lights danced behind his eyelids. Could emotional impact give you whiplash?
When he eventually opened his mouth, their Panna Cotta arrived and stirred the stale sorrow that had settled on their backs. John knew he couldn’t let go of Sherlock now even if he wanted to. He pulled him closer and Sherlock willingly slid around the corner of the table until they were perched tightly together, their sides aligned in comforting contact. John grabbed one of the spoons with his less trained right hand and awkwardly loaded it with a mouthful of the creamy dessert. Sherlock didn’t so much as give him a questioning glance as John raised the spoon to feed him. The warmth between them returned tenfold as they sat there—sharing smiles and their dessert, both soothingly sweet. In between bites—John only ate every third or fourth anyway—he continued his story, sustained by the feeling of Sherlock’s silky curls tingling against his ear.
John had admittedly been a little concerned that Sherlock had not thought things through completely until his friend stated that Rosie would need a room of her own eventually when she was older and they might as well get used to only having one bedroom to themselves. Despite the matter-of-fact tone bordering on irritation, John’s insides had warmed with contentment given Sherlock’s long-term plans for their living arrangement. This form of commitment began to thaw some of the icy insecurity that had clung to him since he and the Holmes brothers had been Eurus’ captives. “Look at him,” had Mycroft said. “What is he? Nothing more than a distraction, a little scrap of ordinariness for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness. You’ll find another.” And although Sherlock had dismissed everything as an act of provocation so that he would find it easier to shoot Mycroft, the words had stuck with John and nagged on his insides like a parasite. Since they had moved back in together, it had shrunk every day. Sherlock drove him up the walls as usual and strained his mental and physical abilities in every way imaginable but he never, not for one second, made him believe that he was replaceable.
“3 minutes to midnight,” someone announced and everyone jumped to their feet before Sherlock could finish this intriguing thought. Glasses of sparkling wine for toasting were passed around as all guests gathered in the sitting room. Sherlock, too, rose and joined the others. Marcus was trying to position himself next to him but John gave Sherlock a glass and Marcus a disapproving look and then stayed so close to him that their unoccupied hands almost touched.
“I thought you didn’t know how those things work,” John laughed and the wink he gave with it sent Sherlock stumbling over his own feet instead of gracefully skirting the table. Thankfully, John was too busy putting on his jacket to notice or at least polite enough to ignore his clumsiness.
“Oh. I thought I made it quite clear that I am still… completely inexperienced in these matters.”
In the silence of the room, only stirred by two sets of breathing, John’s mind replayed Sherlock’s words in an excruciating loop. He hadn’t known. He had put Sherlock through so much pain and he hadn’t known. What was he supposed to say, supposed to do when—
Sherlock frowned at him but Greg just grinned and slumped down on the sofa.
John forces himself to take a breath even though the oxygen here in his bubble is limited.
It takes him a second to realize that Greg is holding it out to him.
John has to set things right. But before he can blaze the trail to his future, he must face the demons of his past.
“Nothing new, Sir,” she said to Greg, acknowledging John and Sherlock’s presence with a mere nod. “Forensics are almost done though. This is definitely only the place where his body was found. We believe Jason was dragged behind the shed to conceal the crime, from over there.” She gestured to the other carefully marked spot a few metres to their right. “The Beaumonts are waiting inside if you want to question them. They’re both pretty shaken up, so maybe put your bloodhound on a leash.”
He’d recognise this silhouette anywhere.
We're getting closer to our happy ending but it wouldn't be as sweet without a little angst now, would it? ;)
Enjoy!
For a few minutes, he simply stands under the spray, the water dripping over his face and washing away the last bit of sleep.
John presses a kiss into Sherlock’s curls. “Least I could do. Thank you for being so patient.”
The icy January wind swiped the words off his lips and swirled them through the air until they got caught in the bare branches of the trees around them, shimmering in the sunrise like golden skeletons. Relief flooded his system. He had said it, told the universe this heavy truth he bore since his teenage years, for the first time in his life. Whatever happened next would happen to a different John Watson, the true John Watson. He closed his eyes and let the morning sun dry his tears.
John blinked at him in surprise. “What?”
“What?”
Sherlock leaned his shoulder against the door and crossed his arms over his chest. There was nothing nonchalant about the gesture. Instead, he looked like he would collapse from exhaustion if the door wasn’t there to support his body like a fellow soldier backing a wounded comrade. “What else are you here for then?”
One of those lonely nights, the aching right beneath his sternum threatened to take over, to slowly choke the life out of him. So, John got up and made his way to Sherlock’s bedroom, careful not to bump into the furniture or make any other noise. The door still creaked as he opened it and John heard Sherlock stir in the darkness. But once again, neither said anything as John approached the bed and slipped in next to Sherlock.
John’s voice was unshakeably calm as he spoke again: “Will you tell me now what you did in the garden?”
“But what if you miss being with a woman someday?” Sherlock asked in a low voice after a beat. “I can’t give you that. I can’t compete with that.”
“The best,” Sherlock replied endearingly, clinking their glasses. A glow of pink tinged John’s cheeks as they both took a sip. John’s choice had been a good one: The wine was flavourful and sweet, perfectly complementing their dish. After another sip, Sherlock felt it drip into his still half-empty stomach and rush directly into his bloodstream. He hummed approvingly.
“No way. You’ve been up for as long as I have. You’re going straight to bed.”
But then, where was Sherlock? After a frankly magnificent orgasm, John had barely managed to clean them both up before falling into a deep slumber with Sherlock in his arms. The exhausted and for once tongue-tied genius had clung to him like a drowning man to a lifesaver, his slender body seeking contact to as much of John’s as he could. Without Sherlock’s comforting heat, wrapped around him in a tangled mess of limbs, the chill of the bedroom slowly took hold of John. He shivered.
“And yet, you texted her.”
John straightens his shoulders.
“Did he ever steal anything from you? Did things… go missing around here?” Sherlock kept digging.
He tore off the wrapping paper and opened the box. A small card—dark blue letters on heavy, off-white paper—lay on top of the phone. He picked it up and read:
“Actually,” Mr. Beaumont interrupted her in a confidential tone, “he got into trouble a couple of years ago. Nothing serious though, just some stupid shenanigans, peccadillos. Boys that age… you know how they are, always trying to impress the girls, not thinking things through. But we’ve got that all sorted out. Jason did his community service and the lesson stuck with him. He’s not made any trouble since.”
“Yes?” John echoed, a wonderful mixture of relief and confusion glazing his features.
“Damn right I do but, more importantly, I need you to stay alive, you bastard!” Greg bellowed with an intensity that seemed to startle himself the most.
—, his navel—
Greg reluctantly settles down as Sherlock presses play.
At half past five, he couldn’t stand it any longer. With as little noise as possible, he got up, folded the sheets to a neat pile, and put his greatcoat and shoes back on. A faint snore came from the bedroom but nothing else disturbed the silence. Molly and Greg were both fast asleep. Sherlock tiptoed to the front door and closed it carefully behind him. It was well before dawn and the night enveloped him in gracious darkness. He had to walk quite a bit to one of the busier streets to finally get a cab.
Lots of love to every single one of you! <3
Sorry for that cliff hanger, the next chapter won't take this long, promise ;)
By the end of their honeymoon, John is completely exhausted.
For the first time in months—years if he’s honest—John wakes up and is excited for what the new day may bring. Maybe even more unusual is that he’s actually feeling rested, he ponders as he turns to his side and relishes the last traces of sleepiness slowly lifting from his brain like early morning fog.
“Remind me once again why I have to go to this
“Nothing to worry about, Mrs. H.,” John reassured her with a weary smile and reached for his fussing daughter.
Still, John’s nerves began to buzz in something between anticipation and sheer panic with every step he and Rosie got closer to Baker Street. If Sherlock hadn’t returned to 221B yet… What was he supposed to do? Calling and texting hadn’t been successful and John doubted that he would be able to find Sherlock if he wanted to be alone. Maybe he could call Mycroft who surely had an eye on his little brother’s every move but that would certainly not aid in regaining Sherlock’s trust or affection. Besides, the thought of asking Mycroft for help, especially in such delicate and private a matter, made John’s stomach turn.
yours, you could use a new one.”
“I know this sucks, mate. But you’ll get over it eventually. Getting your heart broken is a fundamental human experience. Happens to all of us. Even to those who are as far from being human as you. You’ll make it through, I promise. And I’m here for you if you need to talk. Just don’t sabotage the wedding, alright? For John.”
Sherlock suppresses a yawn. He can’t remember the last time he’s been this relaxed. “The timing just wasn’t right.”
Now John—careful, considerate John—wouldn’t start anything ever again. He needed to fix this.
Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile and John had to divert his gaze to stop himself from pinning Sherlock against the back of the bench and snogging him senseless.
,” Stella suggested enthusiastically, her cheeks already a little flushed from the drink in her hand.
John hung up at the sound of the beep. Sherlock had declined his call. That meant he was at least noticing that John tried to contact him.
“You have no idea where your son might be?”
“I was so stupid to believe you would eventually come to terms with this situation. Because I did. I surrendered ages ago. I, the man who supposedly doesn’t even have a heart.” Sherlock’s voice was drenched in bitterness. He could taste it at the tip of his tongue like something rotting inside of him had finally reached his mouth and tainted everything he uttered.
Sherlock’s eyes softened as John reached for his hand. “Honesty,” he recalled with a compliant smile.
Laney shook her head, her voice now distorted to a sob. “I won’t tell you. I won’t tell you.”
As if to refute his objection, Rosie reached out to him and formed once again one wet syllable: “Jaw!”
On his other side, Greg rises and clinks his pastry fork against his champagne flute. The conversation subsides and all eyes focus on him as he sets his glass down and pulls a set of cards out of his inner jacket pocket.
The woman’s mouth stood agape, giving her the look of a carp in an existential crisis. Sherlock felt a grim sense of satisfaction rush through him and took a deep breath, readying himself to fire another round of words sharp enough to sever limbs. A warm hand on his forearm stopped him.
Gradually, everyone became giddy and frolic, discussing their revelations—all except for Sherlock who hadn’t taken a sip since the very first statement. He had never done anything that even remotely resembled sexual contact except those awkward kisses with Janine and, in hindsight, those had been a terrible waste. It couldn’t take the others much longer to notice how little he could participate in this.
“I’m not in a particularly helpful mood right now, Sherlock,” he replies through his teeth. Maybe shouting a little would ease his frustration after all.
Everything starts at John’s skin. He's never been actually living before this very moment.
Nausea still rampaging in his belly is joined by a familiar pang of guilt.
John listened in awe to this declaration of Sherlock’s feelings, tracking every movement of that sinfully sexy mouth. In some dingy corner of his mind, a puzzle of broken, booze-smudged images was pieced together; Sherlock had sung to him before like this, with the same genuineness, he remembered now: on New Year’s Eve, in that club, right on the dancefloor. John had lost control in the dancing masses and shown his feelings in the least captious way he could find—by singing to Sherlock, by laying all suppressed desires into the lyrics. And Sherlock had joined him, recognizing and mirroring the truthfulness of the words. How could John have forgotten a moment like this? How could he have been so dismissive? There had been so many confessions, so many
A murderer on the loose maybe, not hunting down a war-worn veteran this time but out for revenge.
John listens to the coffee maker gurgling and burbling.
OneRepublic, Say (All I Need)
“I already know it’s you, Sherlock. Who else but you would I want to share a bed with?”
He felt Lestrade’s eyes burning on his skin in unbearable sympathy as he watched from his place at the plain metal table. The notepad and voice recorder on it seemed to hum expectantly, another unsettling sound joining the cacophony in his head.
At last, tears spilled from Cal’s eyes, hot and angry and desperate.
Sherlock evades the criticism by sucking on his straw. His smile broadens as he swallows and immediately takes another gulp.
When he watches John and Mary dance for the first time to Sherlock’s beautiful violin song, Greg allows himself to feel happy for them. They are both smiling from ear to ear as they make it through the waltz, a happy couple if ever he saw one.
“It was less a drop than a toss, to be honest.”
Anderson eyed them from a corner after having shooed his team away as soon as Sherlock entered the room. Albeit on much friendlier terms after his return, Sherlock blended his presence out and, instead, dug through Jason’s mess for clues. A few minutes later, he exited Jason’s bedroom again, leaving Anderson’s eager questions unanswered.
“Sherlock has already told me everything. You two go home to Rosie now. I’ll stop by tomorrow, alright? Get some rest first.”
And So, John found himself back in his home, spending every day with the two people he held most dear in the world. He found himself chasing criminals throughout the enigmatic and spellbinding city of London with his even more enigmatic and spellbinding flatmate again. He found himself caring for his infant daughter. And he found himself healing.
“Then I’d like for him to tell me that in person,” John said, reciprocating the glare Mycroft shot him with equal force. Couldn’t the universe have sent him anyone else to punish him? Anyone but this embodiment of posh self-importance with his smug face and fancy suits and—then, it hit John, the detail that had thrown him off. Mycroft wasn’t wearing his jacket. Only an undoubtedly expensive white button-down and grey waistcoat clad his slightly chubby torso. That was still one more piece of clothing than Sherlock usually wore and yet John felt like Mycroft was standing in front of him in his underwear. He had never seen Mycroft take off his jacket somewhere outside his own home—other than in situations of utmost crisis. The sight made John’s already twitching nerves whiz with another sudden surge of panic. This was wrong, all wrong. The falseness of the whole situation seeped from every inch of the wallpaper and clung to John’s neck, slowly but surely pressing his newly-found breath out of his throat.
He mounts the last few steps, stopping on the landing to listen to Sherlock, the words now easily distinguishable:
“I want you to have all the options,” Greg says. Something in his face seems to deflate. He looks ten years older. “If you don’t know, you can’t possibly make an informed decision.”
For the time of night, the Yard was still remarkably busy. As they walked down the hall, John and Sherlock passed several bobbies with disgruntled-looking people in tow. Even the huge office was still buzzing with tense noise instead of the usual low rustling and typing of paperwork.
John devoured his plate of seafood pasta with almost animalistic appetite. All day, they had interviewed suspects and possible witnesses, and John had only lived off bad coffee and a pack of crisps from the vending machine. Sherlock poked around in his own portion, only eating when John eyed him carefully. Of course, he had refused to order anything at first but John had not accepted his usual argument that digestion slowed him down.
?” His voice jumped an octave.
“Good night, John.”
“Happy New Year, John,” Sherlock replied, trying to make it sound as sincere and affectionate as he could.
John rises and fishes his phone out of the pocket of his morning suit that is haphazardly draped over a chair.
The laptop boots up with a tired hum and John uses the waiting time to take a greedy gulp of his whiskey.
Rosie is in the middle of her princess phase, ever since she has seen her first Disney movie. For the past weeks and months, she has barely talked about anything else than her favourites—Belle, Elsa, Moana, Cinderella, … She insists on watching the same films over and over again whenever John and Sherlock allow her some telly-time. The rest of her days, she spends reenacting her favourite scenes, soundtrack included. John can (more or less proudly) claim to know the lyrics to
He had been shaky but focused as long as he had something to do, as long as he could help. But, God, the unfiltered fear that had taken over as soon as the ambulancewoman had pushed him aside and kneeled down next to John.
This particular air, hopeful and sweet with undertones of tragic loss and missed opportunities, had lingered in Sherlock’s chest ever since he had met a certain suicidal ex-army surgeon one fateful day at Bart’s. It had evolved, gained depth and nuances, but it had always remained that same intriguing theme echoing in the very core of Sherlock’s being: a magic melody he couldn’t help but follow.
John placed an innocent kiss on his forehead, his other hand coming up to gently rub Sherlock’s arm sprawled over his chest. “And Happy Birthday, my sweetest. How did you sleep?”
. But the words wouldn’t come.
to you and not me, I think I’ll break down in tears,” John teased and shot him a grin.
Supernova
Sherlock’s heart gave an excited jump, tearing him out of his dazed thoughts. He blinked against the pale light falling through the window. In its glow, the man beside him looked so otherworldly, an ethereal being, the sun getting caught in his hair like a halo.
Sherlock nodded reluctantly. “What else?”
“Hm, hand’s cold,” John murmured with eyes half-closed, being drawn to a dreamless exhausted unconsciousness.
make some room. I wanna sleep.”
“Why didn’t you say so?”
“Oh, it’s alright as long as I’ve got little Rosie here,” John replied and gave his daughter a kiss. Using her like this was wrong, he knew, but the opportunity was just too good to miss. He hadn’t flirted with anyone in ages. The fact hadn’t bothered him in the slightest but, now, old patterns were woven back into the silk he poured from his lips, like second nature.
Sherlock fixed his eyes on John’s again and all but joined the snowflakes melting wherever they landed on skin and hair. There was that special something in those dark blue waters, that… look. He had caught glimpses of it—at the club on New Year’s, at Regent’s Park, at Angelo’s: Pupils soft and dilated to the size of a penny, lips slightly parted, …
Esther, Marcus, Molly, John, and Sherlock raised their glasses to everyone’s entertainment.
“Right, so, the marks are from a venomous jellyfish?”
Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek and explained: “Due to your professional connection to the Beaumonts, I thought it best to involve you as little as possible until we’d confirmed my theory and ruled out their involvement in Jason’s death.”
“Yes.”
Running his finger up Sherlock’s chest, John said: “I must admit—After your exemplary behaviour these past hours you do deserve a reward.” Sherlock’s eyes lit up in mischievous glee and John had to supress a chuckle at the sight of his obvious excitement. “What exactly did you have in mind, honey?” he asked innocently.
John readily sags against him and Sherlock steadies him, holds him upright, carries the weight for him a little while.
“Monday morning,” John replies absentmindedly while searching the dancing crowd with his eyes. Something in his features wipes away the last bit of doubt on Greg’s mind even before John says: “Where could Sherlock possibly be? You don’t think he’s left already, do you?”
Sherlock closed his eyes for a second as if in pain. “I’m so sorry, I should’ve called you Dad when she’s with me. And I should’ve told Mrs. Hudson and Molly and Lestrade to do the same. Now she barely ever heard that word and she’ll say John.”
Sherlock recalls Mycroft’s hint at the wedding, the little reminder how loss had affected him before. He still vividly remembers: not speaking for almost a year, hanging on Mycroft’s sleeve for guidance and comfort, only to be taught the most important lesson of all human existence: Loving what can be lost is dangerous, is illogical, is foolish.
“I had a sandwich for lunch at two-ish, that’s it,” John said after short consideration.
“These marks,” Sherlock interrupted them, finally resurfacing from the depths of his scientific analysis, “are interesting.”
Greg rose as well and gave Sherlock an awkward pat on the shoulder. “Sherlock?”
Sherlock leaned into him, his lungs slowly recovering from the strain of supressed laughter. “I should hope so. Otherwise, I couldn’t allow us to go out in public together—ever.”
“But Cal was out looking for the ring. He needed it, needed some money to get him and Laney off the grid for a while. You’ve seen the parents and you’ve seen how closed-off Laney was towards the police. She’s deeply traumatised and Cal can’t do anything without money.
John raised his eyes and hands to Sherlock’s face, forcing him to acknowledge the complete absurdity of his utterance: “No. Don’t you dare say that. They’re a part of you and nothing about you could ever be anything short of perfect.”
“Why would I when I have the most beautiful human being on this planet right here by my side?”
Through a crack in the curtains, sunlight is flooding the room like white-hot iron. John presses his eyes shut against the brightness. His head feels like an elephant is sitting on it and his tongue is stubbornly stuck to the top of his mouth.
“I don’t think John would agree.”
John scrolls through his sent texts, each sounding a little more desperate than the last. Of course, Sherlock often doesn’t reply to texts he doesn’t deem worthy of an answer.
Sherlock dried his hands and joined them. He was still in his pyjamas, naked feet sticking out from under his dressing gown as he sat down and helped Rosie stand up on her wobbly legs.
John’s eyes prickled with tears and, for once, he made no effort in fighting them. What Sherlock had done was incredibly thoughtful and, coming from the most self-absorbed person he knew, it was nothing less than a declaration of love, for him, for Rosie, for Mary. The two seemingly contradicting feelings that roamed his heart day and night came crashing down on him: missing Mary and loving Sherlock; being caught in the past and longing for a future. How was he supposed to keep all of this inside?
“Understood?” he repeated, more harshly this time.
No, they keep the distractions coming, keep babysitting him until their shift is up, until they feel they have done their duty.
“Sherlock, calm down. It’s alright.”
“But you liked it.”
“Hang out?”
“John, what—,” he began his protest but this time John didn’t let him finish.
After they finally had left, Sherlock returned to John, finding him sitting on his side of the bed. His face was still rather pale but at least the shivering had stopped. John shot him an apologetical smile while Sherlock just stood in the doorway, unsure how to proceed. He wanted to make John feel better, no matter what it took. That was what a good friend was supposed to do. And he wanted to be a good friend for John Watson, so badly.
John swallowed around the stupid lump lodged in his throat. “How do you…?”
Mrs Hudson took another sip of champagne. “Don't forget to make a wish, dear!”
She isn’t the problem.
And even the fleeting moments of joy that light up like distant stars every once in a while are immediately spoiled by the relentless presence of the DVD, the bloody DVD.
Again, Sherlock’s voice drops to unknown levels of fragility. John soaks up the words like a sponge:
“If this is supposed to feel like a real uni party, we should play something, like
For the first time in his life, John simply let go. He slipped his free hand between them and clasped Sherlock’s still lube-slick cock with unquestionable authority. His own thrusts growing frantic, he pumped Sherlock’s cock hard and tenaciously. Sherlock’s moans spiralling into unknown heights and volumes, John’s hips and hands drove him over the edge, cum spurting all over his chest and stomach. Two more seconds and John followed suit. His orgasm hit him like a wrecking ball, as intense and positively devastating as nothing before.
Dusk has fallen when John steps out of the tube station. Winter is rearing up again, stretching out frosty fingers for any sliver of exposed skin, and the air is heavy with the scent of imminent snow. John ducks his head against the icy wind blowing down the street and hurries home.
Don't you worry, I'll sort this all out in the last chapter :)
“Mr. and Mrs. Rowley, if I may ask,” Sherlock began, ignoring Lestrade’s fiery stare in light of his unauthorized utterance, “where’s your daughter?”
, it echoed in Sherlock’s mind,
“We’re still waiting on the toxicological report and the sweeping of the scene. I wanted to head back over now if you care to take a look? Molly said she’d call as soon as she finds anything interesting. Maybe someone knew about poor Jason’s condition and used it to mask his murder,” Greg mused and grabbed his jacket, missing the eye roll Sherlock couldn’t suppress.
“What?” Sherlock asked curiously and moved to look at John.
Sherlock lets his gaze roam over the beloved face now, all pain it causes aside. “We don’t though. We never do that,” he states. Something weird is going on with John. Sherlock can’t place his expression.
Covering Sherlock’s neck and bare torso with soft kisses, he made his way downwards over hills and plains of marble skin. As his mouth brushed over a pink nipple, Sherlock gasped loudly, his head drawing back on the pillow. John smirked through busy lips and continued his work, set on showing Sherlock just how much he meant to him.
. “Calm down, alright? We know that everything seems hopeless right now but
“Thanks,” John says, seizing the invitation to small talk. “Though I wasn’t much involved in the planning really. This is all Mary and Sherlock. The only thing they’ve entrusted me with is showing up today. I once made the mistake of questioning their choice for the centrepieces and they almost ripped me to pieces.” He laughs a little hoarsely. “But, you know, happy wife, happy life.”
Please let me know what you think about Sherlock's abuse story! It just came to me in a single tear-drenched writing session and I couldn't include everything in my head in this chapter. I don't know if my approach to this subject is appropriate and, of course, I don't want it to be clichéd and hurtful for people who had to live through something like this. So, concrit is more than welcomed!

“Are there other pet names you agree to?” John asked amidst his mirth.
Upon these words, the anger slipped from Harry’s face like a thick veil giving way to gravity and exposed an incredulous smile. She intertwined their fingers and gave them a squeeze, warmth spreading from their hands and spilling over the table. An ancient weight lifted off John’s cervical vertebrae.
In his mind, he replayed every piece of evidence from this morning and last night, every deduction he had made about John, every single detail of their interaction; Combined with his prior observations about his friend as well as the mosaic of his own emotion (that was the hardest one to grasp), there was only one conclusion allowing for all the facts.
“But I’m done with that now. I am so tired of all this guilt. I’m a father myself now and I want Rosie to become the person she wants to be, no matter what. I don’t want to pass all this garbage on to her. This—the hypocrisy, the hate, the secrecy—ends with me. So, now, I’m giving myself permission to feel this, all of it. Because there’s someone who sees me the way I really am. Someone special and smart and beautiful and kind and just extraordinary. And I think he loves me. There is a real chance for me to get everything I’ve wanted since I can’t remember when. A chance to be happy, to actually feel happy from the bottom of my heart, not just because I should be.” John let a smile spread over his tear-wetted features. “He makes me happy, even if he drives me crazy. And I know if you love me the way that parents should love their children, then you’ll be just as happy for me, with me, regardless of my preferences.”
Every single word hit John like a bullet, shattering bones and tearing his flesh into gory tatters.
“About 6:30, I think. I came down to the kitchen to make coffee and I noticed that it was unusually cold. I looked around; the French door to the garden wasn’t properly closed.”
In the sitting room, only a few meters away now, Sherlock’s voice begins to sing a song John recognizes from
“It’s all laid-back. No dress code, no fancy drinks, only nibbles; like the good old days at uni, you know,” Greg said and patted Sherlock’s shoulder before heading back to the door to greet some more guests.
John’s hand, resting on Sherlock’s chest, slowly wanders upwards, to his neck and into his hair. Sherlock feels goosebumps spread over the skin where John touches him. His heart drums a hard, eager rhythm in his chest and Sherlock is sure John can hear it, as close as he is.
Grabbing Sherlock by his thighs—well, maybe his arse—for leverage, John spun them both around in a swift, almost effortless motion until Sherlock lay on his back, head landing on the sofa’s armrest, and John half-knelt between his readily spread legs. The sight made John wet his lips in nothing short of ravenous appetite. The way Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed a bright crimson by now, his chest heaving in such violent motion that the already strained buttons of his shirt were seconds from giving way—nothing and no one had ever looked this delicious. Sherlock gawked up at him with surprised admiration for a second before John dove down to him, greedily extracting a few kisses, before positioning himself flush with Sherlock’s body and grinding his hips in a slow wave that made Sherlock cry out in a guttural moan. John half-heartedly tried to stop and shush him—Mrs. Hudson was probably still awake—but firm fingers were already wrapped around his arse cheeks and coaxed a steady rhythm out of him. John buried his face in Sherlock’s neck again, muffling his own groans by working his tongue and teeth against the exquisitely responsive skin.
His fingers are still clasped tightly around the disc and, for a second, he is determined to break it, right here, right now, and ban this whole, mad interaction from his memory.
Sherlock lowered his gaze bashfully but John could sense that something was still bothering him.
Mary and he had already unpacked one gift that had arrived early—the card attached had explicitly said to. It was from Harry and contained a most inappropriate set of sex toys. Mary hadn’t stopped laughing for at least twenty minutes and John had to threaten her with calling the wedding off to make her promise not to tell Sherlock.
Obviously, his karma was worse than he had thought since, in his next scene, the doppelganger was almost completely naked.
“Yeah, of course, we know. We just weren’t sure you did,” said Greg with brow furrowed in pity.
“But what did Jason and Cal fight about in the first place then if not the ring? Didn’t Jason want him to leave or what?”
“I… John… We fought… I screamed… Rosie…” Sherlock’s voice broke, limbs shivering from the frost and agony. He could barely keep himself upright. At his words, Molly seemed to shake off the remainder of tiredness and take in the sight of him: greatcoat unbuttoned, no scarf, face ghostly pale, eyes red.
“Oh my God, it’s Sherlock,” Harry blurted out and unsuccessfully tried to shut off a laugh at John’s horrified expression, “I knew it! I
It’s still standing where it always has, with the same union jack pillow haphazardly thrown on it, but, somehow, it’s growing, demanding more room, more air. Its presence, its reproachful emptiness, colours 221B up to the tiniest speck of dust.
“Yes, I believe we have,” he smiled, squeezing Sherlock’s hand.
Rosie nestled her cold little nose in the crook of his neck and John grabbed her tighter. It was a shame that his daughter would grow up without a proper grandmother. John knew, that Greta would have coddled the little girl with all the warmth and kindness she had swathed her own kids in. God, how he missed her.
Sherlock had to be worried sick by now, probably running circles into the ground, blaming himself. God only knew what he would do.
As hard as he tries to avoid the image before him, there’s just no use. John belongs here, in this chair, in
Sherlock froze under the touch, overwhelmed by John being so close, by John crying, but forced himself to relax. He didn’t want to make John even more upset by thinking he had overstepped some stupid boundary with his hug. When John finally let go of him—mostly because Rosie began to squirm and whine in his tight grip—his eyes still shimmered wet but he smiled.
Outside, some cars come to a halt with screeching breaks. The sirens of the ambulance are joined by the low humming of rotor blades. In the blue light blinking through the window, Sherlock looks almost sheepish.
The words needed a second to reach John’s brain but when they did he abruptly dropped down to his heels again and stared up at Sherlock, dumbfounded. “Research? What? When? How?”
As the less energetic verse took over again, John slowly swayed against him, letting his body follow the rhythm, eyes closed and still mouthing the text: “
So, Sherlock wouldn’t try to take control; He would merely initiate, make an offer. He would present himself, subject himself to John’s wishes and urges: a wilful subordination.
Yet, he remains silent.
A friendly voice pulled Sherlock out of his panicking head and back into the comfortably dim light of the restaurant. “Are you alright?”
“I feel like we’ve piled up all our past mistakes and shortcomings right here, all our doubts and fears,” he said, fixing his gaze on Sherlock while firmly planting his hand on his back. “And I don’t want any of that stuff in our life when we’re moving forward. Together. As you said: No more secrets. No more hurting. Let’s just leave all of it behind us, for a fresh start.”
“That good of an orgasm?” John asked fondly instead, brushing his nose against Sherlock’s with playful gentleness.
Goosebumps travel over his skin as he turns on the water, temperature as low as he can bear it.
When the song is over, Sherlock shifts next to him. “So, I thought I’d give it to him tonight when he comes over to collect the other place cards. It’s my last chance to see him alone and—”
Sherlock spent the following night at the hospital’s lab, trying to identify the poison that he was sure had killed Ethan but couldn’t find anything. As he picked up John from the hotel the next morning, Sherlock resembled a dead body himself. John had carefully watched out for any signs of fatigue in his friend over the past few weeks. He didn’t want to miss Sherlock’s distress again as he had with his nightmares. Now that Sherlock hadn’t slept two nights in a row, John was tempted to order him to rest but he knew that it was no use as long as the case wasn’t closed. Besides, he was still disgruntled because of Sherlock’s recklessness and not in the mood to force some self-care on the detective.
While Sherlock could be persuaded to shower, John made do with a catlick. Washing off the traces of blood and iodine on his belly and putting on a fresh pair of pyjamas sufficed to make him feel like a whole new person.
“I get it,” John said, gently brushing the dark curls back from Sherlock’s eyes. “And I don’t need words to tell you what I feel for you if they make you uncomfortable.”
“How is it not? You once again let your fragile male ego or your insatiable libido jeopardize a relationship!”
John let go of his wrists, instead taking Sherlock’s face into his hands, brushing his unruly hair back and placing gentle kisses on his flushed cheeks. His voice came out hoarse and breathy: “Would you like to… you know, top? Since it’s your first time and it’s probably… more fun.”
“I didn’t beg,” Sherlock spits. “And just because I need your assistance with something as frivolous as these… bloody wedding formalities it doesn’t mean you—you get to manhandle me. I can handle myself just fine.”
here, after all.”
Although he knew what to expect, the sight took him by surprise when he arrived at his destination: two tombstones sat there, side by side, made of the same dark shade of granite. The left was grievously familiar while John had not seen the one on the right before.
“Ehm, a cup of tea and biscuits with you, like four hours ago.” John rubbed his face and Sherlock’s stomach clenched at the sight of his friend’s evident fatigue and discomfort. Seeing John suffer in any form always afflicted him with the nagging sensation of acid burning through his inner organs. Empathy was surely one of the most useless and counterproductive outcomes of evolutionary history ever. Thank God, Mycroft wasn't here to witness his reactions.
“Not to my recollection,” Mr. Beaumont answered through gritted teeth while his wife was convulsed with another wave of tears.
Sherlock’s eyes filled with tears—
Lestrade and Donovan exchanged a look, as did John and Sherlock.
“They… they beat us,” Cal whispered finally. “When they drink. And they always drink.” A bitter little laugh formed a white cloud in front of his mouth.
“Very.” Already having filled his mouth with another fork full of tagliatelle, Sherlock added: “Great idea of you to come here.” He actually meant it.
Their fingers had found each other again as soon as the last bite of pasta had been swallowed and not let go since. The touch anchored John, provided proof, ever so small but nonetheless reliable, that this was really happening. His brain couldn’t possibly come up with such an intoxicating sensation on its own.
“Cases?” John follows him up the stairs and Sherlock doesn’t have the strength to tell him not to. “You’ve been working?”
For now, Greg decides to remain silent, a mere spectator of the show, but he can’t help but wonder if he has misinterpreted the relationship between his two friends all this time.
“How do you—?” John began with a puzzled look but then just shrugged his shoulders and handed Mycroft the glass. “You know what, don’t tell us. That could be our engagement present.” He returned to Molly, Greg, and Mrs. Hudson but not without giving Sherlock a wink and pinching his butt, a bright, mischievous grin illuminating his features.
“What names do you prefer?” Sherlock asked as soon as they were out of earshot again.
As beautiful as the snow covering the landscape looked, it made for a cumbersome walk home. The pushchair’s wheels kept getting stuck in the wet mixture of melting snow and gravel so that Sherlock had to carry Rosie the whole way. The little girl seemed to like this option better, anyway, as the jolly string of incoherent sounds bubbling from her mouth proved.
Sherlock’s mouth opens without his conscious command, inviting John’s tongue in, and even this is not close enough. His hand sneaks into John’s hair, holding him in place because this can never end. He can never let John go again.
“To great food and even better company,” he said with a bright smile.
“Sherlock?”
“Busy night?” Sherlock said in lieu of greeting.
God, I hope this wasn't awkward or anything, being a first time for both characters and the writer here :D Please voice any criticism you can think of!
With a triumphant little hum, he staggers to the telly and shoves a disc into the DVD player’s slot.
No new messages.
Jaymes Young, Tied Down.
Sherlock can’t fathom it. He can’t believe that all the years of excruciating secrecy, of having the only person he’s ever wanted right in front of him and yet lightyears away, have cumulated to this: a stupid video he has recorded as a last escape, just to let it out, to finally say it, sing and shout it out to the world. And now it’s not even the big romantic gesture it was meant to be.
John put his phone back in his pocket and grinned at the fact that Sherlock had stopped signing his texts to him after John had assured him that his number was saved in his phone and he knew that it was him anyway. The chilly November wind brushing his cheeks revived him a little as he directed his steps towards Baker Street but not as much as the icy raindrops that began to pat down on his head and shoulders a mere five minutes later. John unsuccessfully tried to hail a cab before his jacket was completely soaked. He had always envied Sherlock for the way cabs seemed to stop the second he raised his hand, and mumbled curses in his scarf as the rain determinedly crept into his collar. By the time he reached 221B, John was dripping wet and shivering from the cold. Climbing the stairs up to the flat formed an almost insurmountable obstacle in his current state of utter fatigue. He opened the door to the empty sitting room.
Sherlock grinned proudly at him. “Exactly.”
The years that had passed since John had last been here had not taken their toll on his sense of direction. He had walked this path a thousand times before. With a certainty as if the route was tattooed on his skin, his feet led him along the ramified trails without taking a single wrong turn. Despite its familiarity, roaming a deserted graveyard in the break of dawn had a strange feeling to it. The back of his neck tingled from invisible fingers dragging over his skin and, more than once, he was sure someone was watching him. Was there a guard, after all, following him, or another early morning intruder? John forced himself to not look over his shoulder and tried to shake off the odd ambience.
He softens his gaze and cocks his head. “I’m going to bring this folder back to your flat, alright?”
“I couldn’t’ve wished for a better first word, honey,” John quietened him. “The two people I love most in all of this world and they share a name for me.”
), Sherlock has been able to solve about a third and given crucial tips to re-examine another third. It is a nice little challenge to go by nothing but the old crime scene photos and interviews for his deductions but, of course, it can’t replace proper casework.
But whether he wants it or not, things
“You fainted.” John couldn’t stop a smirk forming around his mouth despite his worry. “When was the last time you ate anything?”
Without giving his saviour the chance to say or do anything else, Sherlock turned on his heels and, once again, ran off into the night as fast as his numb body could carry him. He needed a safe place, now. A place where he could silently crumble into pieces until he found the strength to carry on.
Sherlock didn’t realize where his feet were guiding him until he reached the door. The sound of desperate fists on wood filled the silent night. Finally, someone opened. Sherlock all but collapsed on the doormat.
His face tells of more sleep (even when taking the strain of being a single parent to a baby into account) and his hands disclose that he has widely given up on drinking. When he’s taken Sherlock to his check-ups at the hospital, and now, when he’s monitoring Sherlock’s recovery himself, John is calm and collected, a little more solemn than he used to be maybe, but he looks relieved, freed from a burden, as if it had taken this violent thunderstorm to finally wash off some of the dust and guilt that had settled on him over the years.
The sun is hanging low outside, reaching for his naked feet on the coffee table with golden fingers.
“Since when do you feel this way?” John inquires, his face, usually an open book for Sherlock, now closed off and unintelligible. “You told me you considered yourself married to your work. Was that a lie?”
“It’s Rosie’s first Christmas, everything has to be perfect!” Sherlock barked and slammed the baking tray full of burned gingerbread men on the kitchen counter. Rosie gave a displeased sound at the loud noise.
All that was left was his consciousness—an unbound glowing core, floating over the sweat-soaked sheets, barely more than a whisper, neither tangible nor completely ethereal. Soon, it, too, would fade away, become one with the universe—a particle of no significance against the vastness of existence itself. If Sherlock’s mind was to melt back into the everlasting but ever-changing All, to welcome death and whatever came next, he would do it with just one word, one thought, one truth carried with him to the other side:
A little forlorn, he stands in the middle of the room, bare toes indecisively digging into the carpet. The twisting feeling in his stomach grows stronger by the second, adding a funny, little sting at each turn.
want, Sherlock? In this relationship, I mean.”
John’s insides clenched even tighter at the nickname. No one had ever called him Johnny, except for his mother and sister, back when he had run around in the small garden of a home that would break apart before he turned thirteen. Harry had mostly used it as a term of mockery rather than endearment but, over the course of their adulthood, it had become a codeword, a relic of happier times, and a signal for affection when their pride and their past inhibited any other words.
They shared another kiss, giggling against each other’s lips, hands roaming warm and willing skin. Again, Sherlock gave John a little spin and caught him in his arms, bending him back in a mirror of the motion they had practiced all these months ago for his wedding waltz.
even. After all, there was a gigantic number of issues to be addressed: their love confessions, their relationship status, their level of physical intimacy, when and whom to tell about this, how to handle cases from now on,… Questions and concerns whirred around Sherlock’s head like a swarm of hornets, a roaring, all-consuming buzzing that smothered him. How was he supposed to handle this? He wasn’t good at these human things. That was John’s area. He needed John to guide him. Without him, Sherlock was lost, bereft of his senses, stumbling about blindly, deafly, numbly. The last twenty-four hours had altered their relationship forever. Surely, there were some ground rules Sherlock didn’t know about, ground rules he would most certainly break without even meaning to. This was uncharted territory for him, terrifying and possibly deadly uncharted territory. His heart drummed in his throat, only goading the hornets on further with its savage rhythm. One of them, all of them, would sting him eventually, would inject him with their venom until his body would collapse under the pain.
Mary must’ve noticed by now that John is avoiding her but no amount of self-loathing—and it’s a significant amount—seems to incite a change in his behaviour. John just can’t bring himself to put any effort into their relationship, is paralysed by the insight that he is, simply and devastatingly, unhappy.
. The clinic was a steady job and he needed the money but—
“Sherlock!”
And I would be super interested if any of you have headcanons about John's note from TLD. It bothers me so much that we didn't get to see what it said so I included my own (brutal) version. Any other ideas? :)
“Actually, I’m his date.”
—named Tara joined them.
The little smiley face John often added to his texts had always seemed completely preposterous and unnecessary to Sherlock, and he told John so whenever the opportunity arose. Yet, a message which evoked the image of a smiling, well-meaning John on the other side of this conversation now soothed his buzzing nerves and encouraged him to take the leap. Sherlock’s slender fingers flew over his touch screen, rapidly typing a lengthy paragraph, pouring all of the evidence he had collected into it. This had to be compelling. A significant portion of his future happiness depended on it.
The game is one, the match is struck, and fire meets gasoline.
After a beat, John began stroking his side, voice once again lowered to that soft, soothing purr: “We could both… take care of it ourselves, maybe just watch each other?”
John’s forecast had been wrong. It took them almost three full days to solve Ethan Nichols’ murder. Witnesses were nowhere to be found and almost everyone they interviewed acted suspiciously. As it turned out, the idyll of the village was nothing but a carefully cultivated façade, covering up more grudges and dirty little secrets than John would have thought possible. And one, Sherlock and he agreed, must have been the death of Ethan Nichols.
For a few minutes, Sherlock watched his two friends dance with something like envy in his chest while trying not to infringe on John’s space too much. He knew that John would never allow him this close. That, however, didn’t prevent him from giving him an ardent look every time his mind slackened the reins holding his gaze fixed on anything but John.
“I was wandering through London and I ended up on Vauxhall Bridge,” Sherlock began to explain.
All of her works are just phenomenal, so please check them out and leave lots of kudos and comments <3 <3 <3
Decorating the tree was a lot more fun. The whole evening was spent in the warm glow of fairy lights, reflected by the growing number of golden and ruby ornaments spread over dark green needles. Rosie sat in her highchair, gnawing on her teething ring, and watched them carefully as they put the shiny balls up; John at the bottom half while Sherlock used his longer arms to reach the top branches. This distribution had not been agreed upon initially and the fact that John’s jumper always slid up to reveal a delicious piece of lightly tanned skin was almost enough to make Sherlock want to swap tasks. On the other hand, making fun of John for not being able to reach the top of the tree, no matter how much he stretched, was pretty entertaining, as well, and a lot less dangerous.
As he reached the landing, the door to the kitchen swung open and a man appeared in the frame.
“How gracious,” Greg sighed and rubbed his face.
This chapter's background music:
He didn’t want to face John now, not while he was still fighting the urge to throw a jealous fit, so he kept perfectly still. He heard John click his tongue in slight irritation as Sherlock didn’t respond or bother to shift his long, slender body to make room on the sofa for him before he finally placed Sherlock’s cup on the coffee table and retreated to his own armchair. John picked up something to read—
“No. He is… was 18 after all.”
The little smile faded from his face as a sense of guilt tainted his contentment. Had he forgotten about Mary already? After Sherlock’s fall, he had been a mess for years. There was nothing he could hold onto, no one to give him a sense of belonging. He had been hopelessly and utterly forlorn. The pain of losing Mary had been acute and overwhelming for the first few weeks after her passing, but now… It was nothing in comparison to the devastation and mind-numbing sense of loss that had come with Sherlock’s death. The thought that he let Mary down by moving on haunted him constantly and, yet, he couldn’t keep himself from feeling a little less broken every day.
“And there’s a baby on the way.”
he ended up in a suite on the top floor, wide and bathed in warm sunlight, falling through several floor-to-ceiling windows on the right-hand side. A giant dark green sofa, with an absurd number of fluffy cushions in all shapes and sizes spread upon it, stood in the middle of the room, facing the wall opposite the windows. The niftily patterned ivory wallpaper barely shone through between all the photographs, tables, sketches, and diagrams pinned to the walls. The only other piece of furniture was a double bed with luxurious sheets nestled into a nook to his right. Sherlock stepped into the room.
“I bet they’d willingly give all their worldly belongings if they could just have their son back,” Sherlock said sombrely. “Maybe if Cal had not been so scared and called an ambulance…”
and his fingers closed tightly around his phone, still blaring music out of its weak little speakers. If this was John, the words he couldn’t find himself but needed to express, then he had just told him… But that couldn’t be. It just couldn’t. Maybe he just liked the song and wanted to share something nice with Sherlock for once.
“You could’ve told me, you know. Earlier. Before the wedding,” he said, struggling to maintain a neutral calm tone.
With a selection of the vilest curses from seventeen languages, Sherlock tears at his hair. But the pain doesn’t suffice to make the thoughts back down in the slightest. With unrelenting bloodlust, they rip the remainders of his alarm system down, mangle his defences and shred his last bit of self-perseverance until Sherlock is reduced to a pacing, rambling, groaning mess.
“Mrs. H, I was just about to come downstairs to fetch Rosie,” John said in a forcedly nonchalant tone while Sherlock got rid of the burned pancake and opened the windows to let the smoke out.
“Well, then, we’ll just make new ones that are pretty enough to be photographed. There’s still dough left, no need to panic.”
The next chapter is in John's POV and should clarify some of the more brutal issues of this fic, so have a go if you want to feel (a little) better.
“I—,” John begins and turns around. “I…”
“Sherlock! Wait a second, man!”
If he tried to kiss John now and he rejected him, everyone would see and Sherlock would have to drown himself in the Thames or something. If John would, however, return the kiss, their first intimate contact would be a meaningless gesture observed by a dozen strangers. Both not really pleasant options.
It only takes two hesitant steps until he’s close enough to wrap his arms around John, one hand on his back, the other gingerly placed on his nape, the same way John did at the wedding.
“What?”
The addressed didn’t move.
When Sherlock had woken in the morning and found the bed beside him empty, he had panicked a little. His bad dreams were usually so lifelike and convincing that he had a tough time telling them apart from reality. Had he simply fantasized about John coming to his rescue? No, he definitely wore different pyjamas than yesterday and his second pillow had been used by someone else. But, then, where was John? Had he slipped out of bed as soon as he could in order to avoid Sherlock? Had Sherlock done or said something embarrassing in his sleep and chased him away? How had their relationship altered in the course of one night? Data, he needed data.
“Damn it!” John kicked one of the bins half-heartedly. “We’ve lost him.”
John swallows a groan as he shifts his weight and his head begins to throb reproachfully.
His mouth mirroring John’s motion from yesterday, roaming over his lower abdomen, he pulled at the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, fingers brushing over a half-hard cock. John gasped and said in a delightfully futile attempt to hide his arousal: “Hey, it’s your birthday.
Then he realises that he’s reverted to talking to himself, without even having the skull as pretend-company. That’s a bit not good.
Rosie began to whine in her high chair and they parted with a sigh.
“Is this a stupid idea?” he murmurs into Rosie’s silky hair but, in lieu of an answer, Rosie only gurgles wetly, a string of spit dropping onto Sherlock’s shirt. He gives her a fond smile and a little peck on her forehead.
But the words are still there, black on white, tangible and real.
“There’s so much that I’ve actually wanted to say, you know,” John sighs after a while. “About how I feel and what you mean to me. I had a speech prepared and everything.”
John slightly shifted his weight next to him. Although his eyes had adapted to the gloom of the Beaumont’s garden, Sherlock sensed the frown on his fiancé’s face more than he saw it. He couldn’t blame him. Their cozy armchairs in front of the fireplace back in 221B had never seemed so enticing.
John was clearly baffled by the compliment; His head jerked around with such rapid movement that he almost spilled his own cup of tea in his eagerness to look at the younger man. His eyes scanned Sherlock’s features for signs of dishonesty or mockery but found only a coy smile curling full lips. Slowly, John’s expression relaxed and reflected Sherlock’s smile.
Over the rim of his own cup, Sherlock watches him intently. “You came all the way here and waited outside my door just to ask if I wanted to hang out with you,” he says, not hiding the questioning undertone in his voice.
The earth beneath them grows smaller, cars and buildings shrinking down to the size of ants, until they’re swallowed by the cloud cover.
A few forceful steps more and he bolts into the sitting room of 221B.
“What is it?” John asks hoarsely, as he eventually takes it. To his dismay, he notices his fingers tremble with the familiar tremor as they clasp the paper.
Sherlock gazed at him. He was standing on the other side of the slab, awkwardness personified, while Greg purred something fortunately indistinguishable in Molly’s ear. John shot Sherlock a clandestine grin, forcing him to bite his lip in order to keep in the snicker tingling his throat. As they finally sat in a cab headed back to Baker Street, bright giggles erupted between their breaths.
Janine, as the maid of honour, stays till everything is done. Her chipper, energetic presence makes John even more aware of the fact that his best man is nowhere to be found. It doesn’t help that Janine is constantly steering the conversation in the direction of Sherlock either.
The movie headed towards its emotional climax and Sherlock tried hard not to show the realization the story evoked in him. There were so many kinds of love, not only romantic: between parents and their children, between friends, between siblings (although that one was tricky; Sherlock could write a book about it… or a whole library full of them). And every kind of love was valid and good and precious. That was a beautiful thought, a reassuring one. Because he no longer needed to define his feelings for John Watson. It was love, plain and simple.
Tired? Nope.
“Yes, that’s the plan, Captain,” Sherlock continued, almost giddy with arousal. “Sooner or later, you’ll have to fuck me. I won’t be satisfied until you bury that gigantic cock inside of me. I won’t let you sleep until you’ve wrecked me with hard deep thrusts. I can tell you right now that I’ll be insatiable. You’ll have to fuck me and fuck me and—"
Apparently, he is, at least to some extent, judging by the way words of praise roll from his tipsy tongue with such ease.
“To get the body out of sight?” John suggested.
“If you felt this way, all this time, then why did you marry her?” he reiterates, stepping closer.
His brother’s voice the only thing tethering him to reality, Sherlock imitated his breathing rhythm. Slowly, his vision cleared, only to be fogged up by tears again.

“More?”
“Oh no,” Sherlock’s voice pierced the air, his alarmed tone jerking John to a halt. He anticipated a revelation about a case or even a masked figure jumping out of the bushes, ready to attack them.
As he raised his hand to bury his face in it to hide his despair, Sherlock… flinched. It was this unconscious reaction that broke John at last.

Yes, John had told Harry about it but he had yet to make amends. Sherlock still believed that he had meant all of it. And it had almost cost them everything.
