Irene Adler sat facing him in Sherlock’s armchair. Sherlock, inexplicably silent in the proceedings, stood facing the window. John was hardly thrilled that Sherlock had selected the woman to help explore his latent sexuality, but he couldn’t pretend to be shocked. That they had John tied to a chair in the middle of the flat was a more pressing concern.
Did the bastard not read his briefing material? “Captain Watson does not wish to retire and contacted me to learn if there was a way to prevent the request from taking effect. I said I would do what I could.”
“Since when do you dislike sex?”
“Both.”
John rolled his eyes. “Mycroft, Sherlock wants help with a case, claims it’s urgent. I promise not to ruin the suit.”
∙ ∙ ∙
Moran gave him a guarded look. “You’ve been letting your brother romp around with him?”
“No,” John said quickly, “That- it isn’t that sort of set up. He’s just holding my papers. You know the situation; my CO requested his help when my sister- I think he means to cash in the favor from him, and me, someday. But he’s acted like a sibling and made it clear from the first that he wouldn’t be keeping me.”
Sebastian grunted his assent, pressed back into John’s mouth, and put both hands on John’s arse and thighs, hoisting him up to carry him there. He was limiting himself to kissing for the night but wasn’t giving up valuable momentum by stopping when he could avoid it. If the move startled John, the man took it in stride, bearing his weight on Sebastian’s shoulders and hips while his tongue lavished the alpha’s mouth.
“The hell are you on about?”
“Dates? Am I distracting you or offending you?”
He looked at Sherlock skeptically but obeyed. He wasn’t the expert. “Cause of death was probably blood loss, based on the size of this pool, and those stab wounds aren’t superficial. It’s weird he doesn’t have defensive marks.” John took a knee to feel the neck and jaw of the body. “Rigor mortis has only just started to set in here, but not at the torso yet, so he’s only been dead a few hours.” He looked up at Sherlock, “How long does it take the police to get set up? He must have been found relatively soon after the attack.”
“Surely there are some ancient alphas available in that bumbling monstrosity you call a government. Ones who wouldn’t mind having a moderately interesting omega around to listen to their prattle.”
John hated when alphas called him that. He didn’t know why they did it, but hypothesized they were only programed to dish six rote phrases. John was many things and he didn’t think pretty was one of them.
The gears of John’s brain were fighting any effort to move. Was it afternoon? How’d he been asleep that long? He frantically tried to recall how he’d gotten here but nothing after his check in with Harry and her friend midway through the bar crawl last night was coming up-
“You’ll want John to join as well, when he leaves the army. His payment for your alleged help.”
With no sign of incoming intervention from Sherlock, John tried fruitlessly to knock Irene's hand away. "Stop it. Seriously, Sherlock, get her off me. I'm done contributing to your foreplay. Say something."
“No, I just don’t need you putting this situation under a microscope. You are not an omega. No one will ever be able to turn your life upside down by signing a paper. So come off it. I won’t apologize to you or anyone else for holding up my end of an agreement and being glad things aren’t far worse than they could be.”
Moran made an uncommitted sound.
“He fetishizes you, and you tolerate it. That is not the same thing.”
∙ ∙ ∙
The blurred heat was growing, John’s scent was intoxicating, and the omega was meeting his pace with gorgeous ferocity. This was skidding past his planned limits of the night, and Sebastian’s considered restraint was slipping. He sacrificed one arm to support more of his weight so he could lift off John’s pelvis (lips never leaving that dangerously talented mouth) while the other hand made the dive for John’s trousers. He got John’s cock free with practiced speed and the omega pulled back with a gasp that could mean either thrill or alarm. John’s eyes flashed open and his hands quickly left their places at Sebastian’s back. One flew to stop Sebastian from pushing John’s pants and trousers completely off his hips, while the other struggled at Sebastian’s fly. Sebastian understood and redirected his hand to free his own aching prick.
“Believe me when I say I wouldn’t have cut a very impressive figure tied to his floor. Are you done dragging through this shit with my alphas now?”
“Sherlock, why is there a human foot in your fridge?”
“Yes, sir. I don’t know what they used, but when I woke up, I was already in the alpha’s flat, and he told me they’d drugged me.”
“Who is this alpha that has your papers now? Was he courting you?”
“Oh, right. Well that’s fine.” John replied a little awkwardly.
John gave him a careful look. “And what level of deference do you expect from your omegas when they are with you, exactly?”
He could smell how this pleased them, but then Mycroft Holmes, of all people, cleared his throat, and suddenly James understood how the man had earned his nickname. The chilly silence that fell was absolute and was it laced with fear? All the alpha preening of moments before was gone. Holmes didn’t need a booming baritone to call order, and Sholto was impressed, despite himself.
“I’m right here!”
Sherlock was rapidly contextualizing some of his information, as these things could not be a coincidence, and somewhat pointlessly responded, “And these prefer your demeanor to the traditional omega personality?”
“What?”
“I’m supposed to have a say in who I have sex with! It never occurred to you that I might have objections to letting that woman touch me? Just so you could get off?”
∙ ∙ ∙
“But I’ve known, and despised, Victor since university.” Now it was Sherlock who couldn’t meet John’s eye. “We used to get high together.”
“When you choose to measure against the lowest possible bar-”
John was chuffed. “Thanks for that, mate, means a lot. I’m at Kensington Central Library, but don’t rush. I need time to look into appealing the withdrawal. And on that, can you think of anyone I should call to get the request binned?”
“Oh, god, John!” Her voice wobbled with despair and drink. “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry, I- I can’t.”
“Tell me what she had.” John said quietly.
“Better than Victor Trevor is hardly a high bar, Mycroft. Even you meet that.”
“Right, I think you’re confused. This is an office building, not a club. So please keep your hands to yourself.” He said it evenly and pulled his arm from the other’s grasp.
John crooked his mouth in a half smile. “However you like it.”
“Hello?”
“Sherlock Holmes, and I’m surprised Mycroft didn’t demand more pomp and circumstance for our introduction, if you’ll be joining the family. It was a mistake, by the way, for you to select my meddling elder brother after successfully avoiding a bond for so long.”
Bill’s stupid cracks and gleeful relief were infectious and had John properly laughing by the time he finally told the man to bugger off. He immediately rung the Major, because, well, how do you go about telling a man you respect beyond measure that you are eternally grateful to him without letting things get unacceptably soppy? John certainly didn’t know and giving himself time to think about it wasn’t bound to help.
“Seriously, what part of this is bad?” John pressed, plucking at his shirt. “And who exactly am I disturbing with it?”
“Right. Well clean is good. Can’t say I fancy dealing with more active addicts in my life.”
“A consulting detective.”
“Just stay away from him. He’s dangerous.”
He now had to sprint to catch the object of their conversation.
“Should I be?”
John didn’t mask his venom. “How long am I to stay here then? Do you like seeing me half-naked and covered in dried cum as much as you do with your girlfriend on my lap? Am I just on retainer ‘til you want your next orgasm?”
“John’s managed that before.”
Sherlock gave her an inscrutable look. “Yes, I did.”
John’s stomach twisted, and he dropped his head in disbelief. He saw the woman’s green robe pooled at his feet and his stomach fell another inch (he would have to get rid of that). He noticed the knife in Sherlock’s hand, surely to cut him free. His eyes finally landed back on the impossibly calm face above him.
Mycroft had been waiting for this call. “Thank you, please put him through.” After the click, he began, “Hello Major Sholto, it is good to hear from you.”
“Then where are you now Watson?”
“Mhm,” Sebastian replied vaguely as he nuzzled his face into John’s neck. “Next time I want to see you naked.”
John was curious to see the space where Victor should have signed giving him to Mycroft. He had wondered if it would be blank, but all it bore was a very official looking government stamp, similar to the one next to Harry’s name when she’d been next alpha of kin. Idiots romanticized the legality.
“You can’t really expect me to believe he’s aroused by this farce?”
“If such a thing could be done, I would welcome it gladly. Though I suspect Trevor would not enjoy Watson’s long deployments. It would seem kinder to both to find another arrangement.” John hadn’t asked, hadn’t even suggested he wanted James to do this, but he wasn’t going to walk away without even trying. John Watson deserved a better alpha than the one he’d been saddled with, and well, in for a penny. If they could revert his ownership back to his sister, James was sure John wouldn’t let her commit such abuses again.
“Yes, but I didn’t want to, as she already told you. I was not coerced. I asked her to come.”
He could put out like this on demand if he had to, and Sebastian hadn’t raised any objections to the fare of the evening, but it’d been a while since he’d had penetrative sex on the receiving end. Even longer since he’d had a heat. Christ had the last one been during med school? He sighed. With his new suppressants, that was coming eventually too. All in all, he needed more physical and mental prep time.
They continued their walk and were near their goal before Sherlock spoke again, “You wouldn’t have been trapped with Victor. I would have freed you.”
“Watson? I thought you were on leave.”
Mycroft resisted the urge to bristle. This was classic alpha preening and he needn’t rise to it. Moran was an asset and his concerns needed to be diffused. “I understand you do not trust in my brother’s intentions, but if it offers you any comfort, the captain is remarkably capable of defending himself from unwanted advances. I have witnessed this myself, though not on the receiving end. Given his life of evading aggressive suitors, and his near entrapment by a practical vagabond, I do not believe my brother could have gained Watson’s assistance had there been anything untoward. Watson’s history shows it would have put the him completely off. I understand he merely enjoys having companionship free of overtures for once.”
Mycroft only responded with a small, ‘hmm,’ before gesturing for John to walk before him, out of the conference room. “If you will join me, we can get you situated. You will, of course, be moving into my home. Must keep up appearances. I’ve had your possessions relocated from Mr. Trevor’s flat, and if there are any other items you shall need, please let me know.”
Being forced to watch the two of them shag in his own living room sounded nothing short of hellish, actually; but he was certain Sherlock wouldn’t let it come to that.
“No, I’d prefer he keep a clear head. And am quite satisfied to observe your considerable skill bring about his undoing.”
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Yes.” John waited for more. “I had a dilemma, and I elected to use Ms. Adler’s expertise to resolve it.”
The chat was brief and unexceptional, but when he rang off, Mycroft pondered a moment over Sholto’s hesitation. Perhaps the Major was simply annoyed that he’d had no say in John’s alpha. Whatever the reason, Mycroft earmarked the memory in his mind palace. Just in case.
“Same, and Mycroft’s waiting for you, just through there,” John gestured, expecting to step past Sherlock, but the latter forestalled him with a little scowl.
Bill was first, because the call was so much easier to face, and John knew he was itching for news. It had been Bill’s brilliant idea to place the tip that landed Victor in ‘rehab.’ Unfortunately, it wasn’t the proper kind, but one for rich assholes, which amounted to little better than a spa featuring only slightly fewer controlled drugs than Victor preferred. Still, it had gotten him out of the way beautifully for the week and a couple to follow as well.
Then John said they were not a together and had left Sherlock with other missing details besides. The omega was an interesting enough puzzle that he was still on Sherlock’s mind a few days later when Lestrade mentioned there would be no suitable assistance at the crime scene. But Sherlock now knew the location of a perfectly serviceable aid, with helpful medical knowledge and a high tolerance for violence and its aftermaths. He had made John laugh. The man might not be opposed to joining him. Just this once. And after Sherlock would be able to close the file on John Watson, a second pass being more than enough to collect the outstanding details that kept Sherlock temperately intrigued.
“See, this right here?” John pointed out and looking at Sherlock. “Maybe he was trying to hide something that they could use to ID him?”
“And you as well Mr. Holmes. Watson told me about his transfer.”
John quickly zigzagged his way through the now familiar wind of corridors and cubicles. It had been the mature thing to do, stop the escalation before he had a proper excuse to strike back. He was walking past a glass walled conference room when a hand touched his elbow. He turned, stupidly expecting Anthea, but it was the strange alpha again, who was now pressing him against the glass, nosing at his neck. “You didn’t even give me your name. Bad way to play hard to get.”
“Then untie me” John spat. “At the moment I want to shower more than I want to hurt you.”
∙ ∙ ∙
The case had taken them through a packed club and truly, it could have been worse. Sherlock was in an uncharacteristic get up and had tried to bully John into wearing a v-neck as well. He said they would stick out if John showed up in his normal button down and jumper, but John had flatly refused.
Mycroft frowned. “You have plenty of resources at your disposal, there is no need for you to bother John.”
Once they were settled in the back-seat Holmes produced a cell phone and handed it to John.
“I’ve met powerful gits before, and they didn’t impress me by feeling me up.” John was keeping his tone calm, because if this was his usual flavor of alpha, raising his voice was only like to spur him on. John set his shoulders back, firm but not a pugnacious. “Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he brushed past the man.
A horrible thought occurred to John. “Oh god, please don’t tell me this was the alpha you wanted me to meet.”
“Do you like Moran, at least?”
They talked at length and were wrapping things up when John said, “And sir? I truly mean it. Thank you. Things would have been a bit bleak without your help, and this outcome is more than I could’ve hoped for. I don’t know how I’ll every repay what you’ve done for me.”
“Good, because we have a lead to follow.”
“There was an interesting conversation held about you this morning, Captain, and its outcome will obviously have a very serious impact on your future. So, tell me, what is it you want, were you free to dictate your fate?”
John tapped open a new message from Sherlock as he waited for his floor to arrive, and nearly started when he felt the pressure on his arse. He didn’t want to cause a scene, so he shifted to dislodge the contact (not necessarily groping, the lift was crowded, he wouldn’t make assumptions), and gave a half look behind him hoping for an innocent cause. It was the sort of thing Bill would do if they were in the same place and John hadn’t noticed him, the lovable git, but no such luck. The alpha from the queue was behind him and his hand returned, more firmly, to its place on John. Right, sod this. John was plotting his retaliation when they arrived at Mycroft’s floor. He sighed. The prat wasn’t worth it, John needed to behave, and he shouldered past the lift’s other occupants. But the man followed him.
John had to duck out of the case a bit early, as Mycroft had summoned him. This prompted some very entertaining remarks from Sherlock, but the case was basically over and John waved them off.
“This skull is real.”
“Yeah, he’s next on my list. If anyone occurs to you, write their name down for me, or drop them a line. I want to do as much as possible to put the brakes on this thing today, and I’m not above begging strangers for help.”
Consulting the Woman was essential. There was strong evidence she already knew what he wanted, (she once offered to give him John for Christmas) but he needed to confirm that she was still interested and would participate on his terms.
James objected to that metric for assessing the best guardian of John’s welfare. “I doubt the alpha wants Watson so much as he wants a healthy, attractive omega to warm his bed, and he could find any number of consenting alternates to do that. He doesn’t need this one, the army does.” He debated voicing his next point, the traditionalists were like to blanche, but he thought it made a good argument against Trevor. “And while the sister is not ideal, she is family. Trevor on the other hand has bitten off more than he can chew with Watson. The captain is intelligent, strong willed, and physically very capable. In the long run Trevor couldn’t handle him.”
Mycroft remembered the fleeting kindness he had considered, to give John to his brother, but no. While the pair had gotten on oddly well, Mycroft had needed something extra to recruit the sniper to the Secret Intelligence Service, and Moran was an excellent choice of bondmate. A former military man himself, Moran was very inclined toward John’s continued career, and Mycroft’s detailed background checks raised no flags for mistreatment. The alpha was also physically acceptable, welt built, with auburn hair, and grey eyes; the desire shouldn’t be difficult for John to muster. Moran was unbonded, dangerously capable, and other factions had been looking to add him to their ranks, but Mycroft swept in with the perfect offer to entice him. He would be an invaluable addition to the SIS, and with the track laid, Mycroft might be able to recruit John down the line as well, when it was truly time for his retirement from the army.
“Not like you couldn’t get out of it.”
He leaned over in bed to kiss John, who gathered this was the preferred bargaining method. Which was fine. It was good Sebastian could be managed this way, and it helped keep the necking to a minimal. The real incentive for John’s learning to kiss correctly was keeping his partners’ mouths occupied. He preferred to preempt efforts to eat his scent off its source, as he was not a fan of the fallout above his collar line when partners were left to their own devices.
John had to chase him down again, muttering, “Bloody hell, you can only see my collarbone, but fine.”
“Absolutely thrilled to learn you’re both exhibitionists,” John said lightly, “but I think you can find someone else to be your audience. Glad to be considered, and all that, but it’s not how I’d like to spend my afternoon.” This had to be an experiment (to test how irritated they could make him or some such). If they were serious about this, then just knowing he had been nominated to be their voyeur was more detail than John ever wanted. Either way, he hadn’t volunteered.
“Ullo?” She answered.
“Me. If you want to wear this,” Sherlock gestured roughly at John’s attire, “on dates, fine. But you have no cause to do so in front of me.”
John considered a moment. “No, dangerous isn’t a problem.”
She smiled, “Who knew you could be such a flatterer, Sherlock. But if John is like to ‘fuss’ as you put it, will restraints be necessary?”
“Yes, the elderly have such progressive views on headstrong omegas. Don’t be an idiot. You wouldn’t want to subject John to such a fate. I thought you liked the man.”
“Is that your way of saying you want us to pressure the alpha into letting Watson serve?” Her tone was hard.
“No. Thank you for offering though, Mr. Holmes. What I have in my rucksack is all that’s important. My sister will have to answer my calls one day, and I can pick up the rest of my clothes then.”
John thought that was one of the nicer compliments he’d received. The Major fell into a contemplative silence, and John opted not to interrupt. Finally, Sholto said, “Tell me this, if he allowed you to stay enlisted, could you stand to be his omega?”
That one made John laugh dryly. His eyes now cracked open, his disbelief plain. “Yeah, how would that have worked into taking things slow? I have doubts you would have settled for a kiss back then either.”
Suddenly John felt quite self-conscious of his sartorial choices for the day, under the look Sherlock was giving him. It was not ideal given his body’s current response.
“Not like it matters what he thinks, once you made up your mind. He could hardly stop you from giving him away to any idiot.”
Still riding his cock, John felt her do that thing with her fingers again, and he knew it would be over soon.
∙ ∙ ∙
“Then explain this to me.” John’s adrenaline, reliably, was picking back up. “You’ve been authorized to speak again, so I suggest you do so.”
“Right, Sherlock, I’ve been trying to respect your sensibilities, but it’s too hot for it today.” He pulled the navy jumper off, which had the unintended consequence of mussing his hair and causing his shirt to briefly ride high. Sherlock could momentarily see the top of his hips, and the bottom of his flat stomach. The trail of hair. He scowled furiously at John for what was tantamount to a burlesque show.
∙ ∙ ∙
She addressed Sherlock, “When I close the door, you may speak.” As she walked past, she paused to kiss John, briefly. “Thanks for a lovely time, Dr. Watson. ‘til the next appointment, then.” And she was gone.
James saw this was getting dicey. “The army regularly-”
He decided to take the plunge. “Obviously, I’ve heard a lot about you from Mycroft Holmes. I know I’m not the only one he’s spoken with. He’s been moving your name around the right circles, getting bites, though it took me a while to get the full picture. When Mycroft explained your predicament, I confess, I was curious. Though I hope you know that by now.” He let his tongue wet his bottom lip subtly before going on. “I’d be equally curious to know what you would think about me taking over the, ah, relationship you have with Mycroft. Permanently.”
There was an unexpected pause from the other line. “Well, it is good to hear that he supports Watson’s career.”
“Library, sir. Needed to research stopping the withdrawal.” Fat lot of good it had done him so far.
“Don’t decide anything yet. Think on it, and in the meantime, can I book you for another date? It’s critical I learn your taste in steak and have a place in mind to test you.”
Moran nodded, almost unconsciously.
John thought that was an unnecessarily dramatic way of telling him. Omniscient hadn’t been one of Sholto’s descriptors for Mycroft, but the little display told John he was expected to ascribe it himself. Still, it was better to understand the nature of his new beast, and he thought it best not to poke him. Yet. “That is good, yeah, does take a load off my mind. Thanks.”
John referred to his envelope. “Uh, the name is Victor Trevor, sir.”
“My telling you to get her off me could have been a clue, you sodding detective!”
“I’m glad he has kept you abreast of the situation. Yes, Colonel Moran is very supportive, it should be a successful match.”
“They’ll have to mate to form the bond mark.”
Then Victor turned back to face him, movements disjointed, and grinned stupidly at John. He was high. That was great. Just perfect. Who wants the RAMC when you could have a motherfucking cokehead of your very own? John felt slightly hysterical. How had he let it come to this? He didn’t even know what Victor was loaded on and didn’t bother to ask. Victor stumbled over to him, eventually crawling, before tucking his face into the crook of John’s neck and inhaling deeply. (Tragically the angle didn’t give John any leverage to cause him pain).
“I just listed his qualities, have you forgotten so quickly.”
“Selected after you decided he would be the most helpful to you. What is Moran giving you, in exchange for his prize?”
“Bill, thank god you answered, it’s John.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“The morgue. The registrar there is very understanding of the need for scientific research.”
“To whatever clothing shop you like. But you are paying. Pick out something you can bear to have me work in so we can stop having this argument.”
“I have not encountered a case like this. The legal alpha is usually at liberty to make these sorts of requests, but I cannot imagine these circumstances would be considered usual. Did the alpha say why he was withdrawing you? He would receive a portion of your pension after all. Or did he file while you were unconscious?”
“Which means you bullied them. This-” did he have an adequate word? “is unsanitary, Sherlock. You can’t keep this in with your food.”
“Not once I met you. I’m sure of it.”
“I do not suggest we rush any decision making.” James pretended to heave a sigh. “But failing to find a path towards stability for the captain among our current choices, perhaps an intermediary alpha could be found. Someone other than his sister to hold Watson’s paperwork while a permanent alpha is sought. A temporary guardian, to get him out from Trevor’s control while we decide the next step.”
Sherlock considered, but no. John always got surly when he was secretly drugged. A direct approach would be better. Feel less violating, in the long run.
“I saw how it affected you.” John corrected. “I never saw why you didn’t stop her when I asked you to. Why you wouldn’t speak to me. Being threatened seemed like the most reasonable explanation.”
When he returned, hands washed and needed materials collected, the man’s face was possibly more severe. “How did you know all that, if he hasn’t mentioned anything?” John asked, sitting on the coffee table. He angled the man’s arm over the bowl, pulled on his gloves and began irrigating the wound.
John let a small smile flit over his face. He was damn lucky to have such a decent man as his commanding officer. He didn’t know how he would make it up to him. He looked back at Holmes. “Your lot move fast. But if it’s as you say, then I think we have a bargain.”
“You mean for us to rob the man of his omega?” The red-faced man sounded scandalized.
“Good morning John, I hope you had a relaxing evening.”
John just shrugged, eyes still closed, breathing hard. “Spent most of my life shagging betas. Can’t let your scent do all the work with them.”
“I would like your help. With John.”
“The sedative was a little heavy, I know. But better safe than sorry.”
“I know, it’s bad.”
Clara was lovely, as always, promising to ask around after Harry at their regular digs, and saying she’d give him an update. He’d always liked Clara so much. Why couldn’t Harry pull her head out of her arse for someone like this?
“And how do you know one had a gun?” John prompted.
“No, I wouldn’t want him to be my alpha,” John said with undisguised vehemence. “Though I did like the independence.”
“What if I could provide you with an alternate alpha? One who would allow you to serve.”
John couldn’t say how long it lasted. It seemed ages before she’d brought herself over the edge, riding him. He didn’t think he’d ever been so unhappy to feel a woman convulse around his cock. Today was a veritable bounty of firsts.
“Tell me,” John said, eyes still closed, voice even, “that she had something. A threat, a bomb on some MP’s car. Another phone full of secrets. Something she would do if you didn’t allow this to happen. Tell me there is a reason you allowed this to happen.”
He made no attempt to sort his feelings. They were too volatile to cope with right then.
“But not on the consequences. Why do you insist on riling me when you have no intent to act on my interest? You just like the attention for its own sake. You don’t want me.” Sherlock was angry but unable to resist drinking in the sight of John’s nearly bare form.
“Oh, right. Should I do something with this one?” he gestured at the figure on the ground.
“It’s how they got him into the shower. He is nude but has none of his bathing supplies. He was forced in here at gunpoint and was so focused on the gun, he probably didn’t see the knife. Three deep, confident cuts in quick succession from the other assailant would have surprised him before he had time to fight and were enough to make him bleed out while the gunman kept him from running.”
“Why would your sister do this, Watson?”
“Whatever you can manage. Anything to make Anderson look bad.”
She leaned back to look at Sherlock, and John found himself coming up short as he followed her gaze.
“Explain.”
[ Do I have time to change clothes? ]
“No, seriously, can you please just wait? You don’t even know me, you might not want to keep me, but I won’t be able to reenlist if you take me out!”
“Right then. I really don’t need to be here for this.”
Fuck, it was all over him. Standing at the sink, John tried to rinse off the scents, but the effect was negligible. They were in his clothes, his hair, his sodding pores, it felt like. He wondered if it would look worse that he’d even tried to wash them off. Like he was attempting to hide. He growled at that.
But it was for naught. He snapped when another grope was made of his arse and John kicked out the back of the alpha’s knee before folding him into a choke hold. Just as the stranger slipped from consciousness, John heard his own name. He carefully lowered the figure to the floor, and faced Mycroft, unabashed. He was glad he hadn’t punched the stranger though, or he would currently look like a Neanderthal.
John was present, conscious, and smartly outfitted in a suit of Mycroft’s choosing for the transfer, as these things were conventionally done. In keeping with similar, formal tradition, John would return with Mycroft that evening, and not move in with Sebastian until the end of the week. The practice arose from the time and threat of bayonet transfers and was considered a civil way of demonstrating that the affair was above board.
“Major Sholto, I’m sorry to bother you like this. It’s John Watson.”
John’s temper spiked. “Yeah, Sherlock, I know that. And that’s a damn sight better than the way other alphas react to me. At least he just gets off, rather than violently or psychotically trying to put me in my place beforehand.”
They fell into a routine comfortably and quickly after the first night, with little discussion about it. John worked his shifts at the military center, but in his free time would help Sherlock on cases. It wasn’t as though John could fill his spare time dating betas anymore, like he normally would when stationed home, and Sherlock was fascinating, frustrating, and utterly dazzling to be around. It wasn’t a bad trade off in John’s mind. After cases, they would often get dinner, as John liked to see Sherlock was eating, though tonight they had grabbed take away to have at Sherlock’s flat. It was his second visit there and John decided it was a cozy, quirky place with character, though he quite wanted to tidy it.
“John, if you aren’t indisposed, could you please look at a patient for me?”
“Well, I’m glad to know you have better taste than Mycroft Holmes,” Sebastian said with a sincere smile. “And I don’t want to sound like a salesman, but I pretty much guarantee independence. I’m gone for stretches at a time and you usually won’t know what country I’m in. But I’m thinking that won’t bother you.”
“Then my precaution was sound.”
“Good.”
“They let me stay enlisted.”

“For about a fortnight, now.”
He’d unfairly snapped at Sherlock for not scenting him as a preventive, when it was Sebastian he should have thought to ask before going out. Sherlock could, like everything thing with his transport, control his own scents in an almost robotic manner. He’d only begrudgingly scented John on other cases, when they were undercover, but that wasn’t his job anymore. Not that it ever had been.
Mycroft couldn’t suppress a small smile. Sharp little thing. “Temporarily. Until I could make suitable arrangements for you.”
Why would he need assistance? “What’s the case?”
Finding the razor blade on Victor’s inert form ranked as one of the happiest discoveries of John’s life. Victor had used it to cut the drugs, and if he hadn’t been the source of misery to begin with, John could have kissed him for it. It took ages to work the razor into a usable place with John’s limited range of motion, but it wasn’t like he had any other options available. That spurred his pig-headed problem solving effectively.
But the foul fuck wasn’t listening. He was filling out the online withdrawal request. John pulled like mad against his bindings, probably damaging muscle in the process, but they wouldn’t give. Victor didn’t seem to register that if John weren’t tied up right then, he would be pummeling him into a coma.
“Given Watson’s request, I felt the extenuating circumstances warranted the military’s intersession, at least as far as the enlistment goes. The captain was unaware of his sister’s intentions to give him up, was secretly drugged during the transfer of ownership, and was physically shackled by his new Alpha upon his return to consciousness.” Several betas in the room looked horrified. “That context was considered valid to the officers listed on the third page of your dossier, who agreed to join me in filing the petition. You’ll notice Lieutenant General Frogmorton’s name is on that list.”
John scowled at him. “If I tell you, will you drop this, please?” Sherlock nodded. The information was oddly pressing to him. John sighed and looked anywhere but Sherlock as he went on, “It’s just another responsibility, and I don’t shirk my obligations. I wouldn’t say I want to write up charts either, but I still do them properly. Same with pulling Harry out of pubs at 2:00 in the morning. This is just one of my alpha duties. It has to get done either way and if he’s not going to be vicious, I’m not going to make it a fight. Then it can even feel nice.”
He heard an exhale on the other line but could have sworn the next words were said with something like pride, “Watson, you incorrigible shit. How badly did you hurt him, getting free?”
When the Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani was forced at gunpoint to sign a constitution she opposed, and which limited her power as monarch, it became known at the Bayonet Constitution. This is where I got the term 'bayonet transfer' from. In this world, I imagine the term would have come to be in olden times, when transfers occurred under duress. Go read up on Liliuokalani, by the way, she's a fascinating person.

John couldn’t figure out how this discussion had lasted so long. “You said it yourself, it’s just transport, so I’m not going to get worked up over it. He wanted it and he asked me first. It was a mutual act. End of story.”
“And you kept them at bay just fine on your own.” Sebastian inhaled. “I like it, smelling how many other people are desperate for you.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“Not the point.”
He was very pleased to note that no scent of threat was coming off John. Maybe Mycroft was right, and the thing with the younger Holmes was just platonic. That soothed his instincts considerably. “Unless you are planning to stay with Mycroft,” he added to prompt a reply.
“No, he’s just letting us show him what he likes.”
“Is you, yes. I have a very demanding work life, as do you. I appreciate the prospect of being with someone who could relate to my field and wouldn’t mind frequent, sometimes long separations. If you are interested, I think this could work. I would want to take things slow, but yes, that is my intent.”
Mycroft exhaled his frustrations. This tantrum held strong echoes of Redbeard. “I know you find this affair distasteful, Sherlock, but I have never had the intention of doing wrong by John. I have no reason to think my selection would mistreat him, or I would not have made the offer. You will recall, the previous option was Victor Trevor and I believe John felt nearly any choice would be preferable to that.”
“Experiment John, don’t disrupt it.”
“I know, never thought I’d get such a good outcome. Seems impossible they’d let me dodge a life sentence with that sod. Still don’t really know how they managed it, but I’m not about push, if it means the ordeal was just a short and painful one off.”
“Fix?” John’s brain felt thick as tar. He blinked up at the alpha a moment before realizing what he meant. “No…please, no, not my job. You’d get to keep the pension, please.” He wasn’t ashamed to beg. His work was everything. All he truly took pride in and that meant using any means available to prevent what this man was suggesting.
They pulled on appropriate sanitary garb and Lestrade ushered them up several flights of stairs and into a common area bordered by five minuscule bedrooms. Inside each, a standard bed, desk, wardrobe, and sink were all so tightly packed it reminded John of Tetris.
John felt her fingers tug again as she sucked hard on his neck, increasing the pace of her bouncing.
“And you? As Mycroft has thankfully been ruled out.”
“For our first session, you will not be allowed to speak for the duration. Only when I direct you, may you look at John’s face, touch John’s body, or touch yourself. If I give you any command, you will follow it. If you disobey these rules, or any order I give you, I will stop touching John and leave. If I do cross a line with John, you are to say my name once, and I will relent.”
“He’ll do. He’s what I’ve got. And we’re done with this conversation. Tell me what it is we’re looking for here, or I’m going home.”
As he came down, John kept his eyes closed. He focused on his breathing. His adrenaline was going to kick back in soon and he needed to think, now that his head was finally clear.
Sherlock dismissed that. “John, you have survived battle, yes? Do you think a crime scene crawling with police on a Sunday afternoon in London is likely to be too taxing for you?”
He'd known this was coming
Sebastian only took a moment to look at John when he dumped him on the couch, to take in the debauched state of him. Normally so unassumingly presentable, now with his hair and clothes disheveled, blood pounding, and lips wet, all because of him. All his. Sebastian dropped back over him and resumed his post, attacking his neck,
Tamped down approval practically radiated off John, but physically he only gave a nod, and fell into silence, gazing at the scenery unseeing, but Sebastian thought it was going well. John was open to the match and Sebastian had to fight the impulse to press his advantage, to lock the other man down. Not that John had much say, given Mycroft wanted it to go through, but everything in his body wanted to win him over. He even considered telling John he could keep helping the Yard but couldn’t quite stomach that concession yet. He might allow it but wasn’t going to make any promises he couldn’t keep. Once they’d mated, he’d feel better about the situation with the brother.
“You think my appearance is too ostentatious?”
. If Sebastian was going to blame him that wasn’t his problem. John took a deep breath. There was a stupid thought. It was his problem. A feral alpha was going to be a peach to deal with, cut off from reason and driven to a rage by their hormones, and his was built like a bloody ox.
They fucked like this until, in a fit of need to feel John against him, no arms between them, Sebastian grabbed up his wrists and held them over his head, still thrusting wildly against John’s cock and stomach. The feel of John writhing under him, his scent, holding him there, finally having him, god yes, and he was coming, hard. Bliss and heat enveloping him fully. He kept John’s wrists pinned with one hand and quickly caught up their cocks again with the other to ride out his aftershocks and take John over the edge. It was thankfully slicker now with his own come coating them.
The fondness crinkled over John’s face. “Ta for that. You’re the only one of them who does. But that’s life as an omega for you. I should have known I couldn’t put it off forever. At least this one pretended I had a choice. That’s better than loads of people get.”
Recognizing the look, and the impending verbal lashing he was about to endure, John hit back first. “Damnit, Sherlock, practicality has to feature somewhere in this experiment. Come on.” He beckoned Sherlock to follow him.
-SH ]
John was baffled by that. “How do you work that out? We didn’t even know each other. I didn’t even know Mycroft back then.”
Mycroft had orchestrated the necessary details with his standard efficiency. Once all was in place, Captain Watson had been couriered to Mycroft’s primary office building by Anthea, and now met Mycroft’s gaze unflinchingly after their formal introduction. The captain had little knowledge of the council’s decision, or the point of this meeting, given that Mycroft hadn’t provided Sholto the time to make proper explanations.
Holmes replied with a sound John couldn’t categorize. They strode out of the government building together and were immediately collected by an unmarked black car. John wondered how Holmes was sure they’d got inside the right one but didn’t ask. What little Major Sholto had been able to tell him about the man suggested intrigue was part of the package.
“That can be arranged. Do you have a preference of material?”
John crooked a small smile. “Sure, that would be nice.”
“This is for you. It will make our communication much easier, as I work late and travel frequently. Do feel free to use it personally, it is yours to keep. Also, as we will be operating in casual proximity, I would ask that you call me Mycroft.”
Sherlock was not satisfied by that response. “Did you want to sleep with him?” Part of Sherlock didn’t want to hear the answer. Moran was obviously a thug and if John had been forced, that would be unacceptable. If John’s answer was yes, then Sherlock didn’t need to learn about the man’s poor taste. Knowing what kind of telly he enjoyed was quite bad enough, even if Sherlock did deign to watch it with him.
John goggled at him. “You just ripped that woman’s face off in front of everyone! That was a petulant bid for something, if I’ve ever seen one. And my telling you to leave off her is not screaming for attention, Sherlock.”
“I’m following through on this, you can bet your life on it.”
Over the first few weeks of living together, John learned that Sebastian wasn’t too controlling. They'd settled on John switching to pill suppressants, because John would never consider going completely off them, but could agree to have a heat every few months at a scheduled time. And as for his free time, it helped that Sebastian would leave for business every few days. He did want to be kept informed of John’s activities, which irked slightly. He also wanted to share meals with John when possible. Doable. And though John still slept in the guest room alone, Sebastian liked affections: putting his hand on the small of John’s back, touching John’s hand or knee, leaning in to whisper when not necessary, inhaling deeply as he did. That was fine. It was somewhat commendable, really. The eye-fucking and blatant lip licking that had begun during their first lunch made John wonder if the man had the restraint. But the behavior was not inappropriate given the circumstances and it was downright gentlemanly compared to some.
“But if Moran presents a sim-”
“And you were supposed to stay out of trouble,” Sherlock retorted.
She looked pleased. “I hadn’t pinned John as a martymachliac. Nor had I realized he was so open to your interests. What a busy few months these must have been.”
“Moran was angry then, about the club.”
The instant that he could move, John was on his feet and down the hall, without a single glance back. He locked the bathroom door and stripped, chucking everything he’d been wearing in the bin. In the shower, he scrubbed hard and kept the water hot.
aware that Sherlock’s sexual interests extended anywhere beyond the woman before him. But he knew Sherlock possessed some form of sexuality and explaining the specifics would be challenging. A demonstration would be perfectly effective. He had never known John to respond poorly to a beautiful woman, and so long as Sherlock refrained from directly participating, John’s physical response shouldn’t be inhibited. Which was more than enough to be getting on with for the time being.
“You can move into my flat, here in London. And otherwise, we will take it slow.”
*Edit: Chapter titles have been revamped. This means very little but is a load off my mind.
“You were restrained?”
On the street John relished the cool early morning air. He wandered for a bit before coming across a wayfinding sign, which told him he was klicks away from Harry or Bill’s apartments. It also showed a nearby library, which would serve him fine.
So, his future oddly relegated, John did the things he had planned when he originally scheduled his leave, got things set up for his next few months working at the military medical center in London, and eventually visited a post office to ship the borrowed supplies and money back to Victor, restocked as needed. He didn’t want to be in his debt. The one bad night was becoming a memory and John was happy to put it, and his souvenirs in the past. He kept the razor blade though, as he’d grown attached. It had saved him, after all, before any of the rest had, and like him, it deserved a better life than that as Victor Trevor’s tool. He would have hung it with his dog tags if it didn’t risk cutting his chest. Instead it found a home in his wallet, and John was content with that.
“Not precisely.”
The flat was quiet. John continued to breathe.
Deep inhale, slow exhale. “Sir, have you ever heard of a withdrawal filing being overturned, by an omega, or by a review board of some kind?”
This ruffled the elder Holmes. “Then why are you here?” John doubted anyone got the drop on Mycroft regularly and was entertained to see that Sherlock had managed it.
“Mycroft is your brother?” It delighted John stupidly to know that Mycroft was an actual big brother as well a figurative one, and got sidetracked by the news. “That figures, it’s the only time he’s sent me on a house call.”
A wry smile stole over her face. “I don’t think that’s altogether true. Wouldn’t you agree, Sherlock? We’d both like you to stay. Otherwise we wouldn’t have bothered with the bindings.”
However, Molly’s heart dropped. Who was this omega Sherlock was being so nice to? Was Sherlock courting him? Did Sherlock prefer male omegas? Or just assertive ones? Either way she felt doomed.
“Who are you? Where-”
(See the end of the chapter for
That felt lamely inadequate, but the Major didn’t seem to mind. “I don’t know that I did anything remarkable, Watson. The situation spoke for itself. And I’m glad the Iceman hasn’t given you hypothermia yet. Has he been decent to you?”
“My list of candidates is confidential I’m afraid, but none have interacted more than you just did. I have not allowed courting from the others, and I hope I won’t need to, now that you have met him.”
“Believe me, I’ve had worse.”
“My name is Victor. Don’t you remember Harry introducing me at the pub last night, John? You’re here, in my flat, because your sister was in a spot of trouble. But don’t get upset, you’ve gone and mopped up her mess. She owed me quite a lot of money, but mentioned she was the legal alpha of an unbonded omega and aren’t you just the tastiest thing?”
“I might have seemed too boring to you.”
The captain looked up sharply, suspicion clear. “Are you referring to yourself?”
He hung his head and rested both hands on the tile below the shower-head as the water continued to scald his flesh. He focused on immediate concerns only: He didn’t want to go back out there. He knew the hot water would soon run out. He was exhausted and wanted sleep. An image of barricading himself in Sherlock’s room gleamed for moment before he dispelled it. He turned off the water and dried himself slowly. He was so tired. Nothing for it then. He moved precisely and managed to get to the landing and up the stairs without seeing anything but the floor. Good. He didn’t need the empty chair and severed ropes to join the unwelcome images already in his head. Mercifully, he barely remembered falling asleep.
“That’s brilliant.”
, I think. Though I doubt he knows yet, they’ve barely met.”
He doubted that she fully saw but did not want to dampen her enthusiasm. Molly was his backup, but he knew that would be fraught. John may loathe the Woman, but he pitied Molly, which, quite aside from failing to stoke his ardor, would make him very cross with Sherlock.
There was a pause on the other end. “No, if he has your papers, unfortunately I do not believe you can.”
Lestrade hesitated only a moment before taking it with an exasperated, “Greg Lestrade. And Detective Inspector, not that you’d know from the way this one acts. Right, come on then, let’s keep this quick.”
“No Captain. I have no interest in partaking in the doubtless desirable aspects of your person. I do mean for this relationship to be one in the traditionally familial sense. Thus, some deference on your part would not go amiss, and I will likewise fulfill my role by facilitating your acquisition by a suitable alpha for bonding. Remaining open to my selection for your mate would constitute cooperation. And retaining accurate memories of my assistance in your time of need would make for fine gratitude.”
John’s jaw dropped.
John couldn’t tell if he was meant to be threatened or intrigued but was successfully irritated. John didn’t like the suggestion that his answer was negotiable.
“Excellent. Then if there are no objections from the rest of this council,” Mycroft gave only the most cursory pause to let such air, knowing none would be forthcoming, “I think that can conclude this discussion. My office will be happy to clean up the loose ends. Oh, and I shall like to speak with you, Major, about arranging a meeting with the captain before I take over his paperwork.”
Their first meeting was very brief, barely handshake and passing introduction before Mycroft sent John off with some request. It was just a chance for Sebastian Moran to get a proper evaluation before he made any commitments. Mycroft didn’t need to tell John that Moran was a candidate. As always, (saving the technical exception) the doctor was firm, warm, and polite. A perfect gentleman, and Moran was likewise sensible enough not to make any aggressive come-ons, but Mycroft saw the Colonel was attracted.
soon as possible while I follow up on another
“No, don’t eat on a case.”
“Does that really mean you’re a court ordered sponsor?”
John responded singularly to Sherlock’s deductions. Appreciatively. Sincerely. A rare and pleasant occurrence. Sherlock could recognize the traces of deeper appeal there. He was unprepared to like any future in-law that would select Mycroft but quickly switched tact; omegas had few rights in this area, certainly it had been Mycroft that chose John. At his age, John must have put effort into remaining unbonded and would not have squandered it on the likes of Mycroft. His brother, meanwhile, was bound to demonstrate some taste on occasion.
John let out a short laugh, “Are you accusing me of being inappropriate? For wearing a crewneck top?”
“Who.”
John shoved the man back. “Look, I said I wasn’t interested, and I’m not playing games.” John’s already insubstantial patience was wafer thin, and he was forming a fist, before invoking his new patron saint, Molly Hooper. He was sure she never threw fists to deal with alphas, and she’d managed just fine in life so far.
Sherlock looked at him like he was a lobster trying to sing and doing it poorly.
“Case is over, and we’ve been at it for hours, aren’t you starving?”
James gritted his teeth. “The government is already involved. If current policy did not allow his fate to be so easily manipulated, I do not imagine there would be a mess to begin with. The omega in question applied himself to a rigorous field of study and dedicated his talents to Queen and country with distinction. Meanwhile our laws have blindly embowered unemployed addicts to run his life amok simply because they are alphas. It saddens me greatly to know there are those who would defer to their biology over his accomplishments, but I didn’t come here to debate politics.”
An elderly beta woman greeted John at the door of the unfamiliar address. “Oh, thank goodness, he’s a such a dear but very stubborn, never likes to visit the A&E. Good thing that nice inspector put his foot down this time. Do come in doctor.” John had no idea who she was talking about but thought her doting sweet. He let her natter on a bit before pointing him up the stairs.
There was the question of the hour, of Harry’s whole life it sometimes seemed. “I don’t have all the details sir, only what the alpha told me when I woke up yesterday afternoon. But he said she,” he had to get through this “that she used me to pay off her debts, sir. I don’t have proof of that, only his word, but she does struggle with gambling, and other…issues.”
“Not at all. I have spoken with my military colleagues and a fair sum could be proffered to make Trevor whole. I also think Watson would be more than happy to pledge some portion of his future pension toward the partial repayment of such a sum, if the expense is off-putting to you. In any case, Victor Trevor is not interested in money, or in need. Regardless we are happy to arrange fair compensation.”
It wasn’t funny, but it made Sebastian laugh. He couldn’t picture John lying back and letting anyone or anything do all the work, not after tonight. “If I’d known going in, I would have asked for a kiss the first night.”
She knelt before him, smiling irreverently as she began to stroke his thigh and John gave her up as a lost cause.
The beta wilted slightly, but another filled the vacuum in his stead. “That is irrelevant, Major. The law clearly authorized his sister to act as she did, and Mr. Parker is right, his new alpha is financially capable of supporting him. If this Mr. Trevor fellow doesn’t want his omega employed, it is none of our concern. The circumstances may be messy, as you say, but the government shouldn’t be getting involved,” she concluded calmly.
“Sir, he-” John wanted to catch fire from the indignity of the words, “said he wanted me available, for him. I mentioned the pension when I asked him not to withdraw me, but he said he didn’t care about the money. I was restrained, sir, or I would have stopped him,” John felt the need to add. To explain himself for letting it come to this.
“An excellent question for
“I think you will receive a call from a Miss Clara Hawthorn today informing you that your sister is alive and relatively well. Which I hope alleviates your worries.”
John breathed, realizing what was about to happen. This was inevitable. Overdue. The fair deal he had agreed to. Sebastian had been clear and kept his word, so John would do the same. Fulfill his role as partner, not some fuck-toy to pity.
Sherlock’s brows drew together. “It is clear-”
The stranger glowered a minute more but finally nodded and watched closely as John approached. He set down his kit and phone to inspect the wound.
Sebastian gave a breathy chuckle and raised one hand to stroke John’s hip.
“You are his new omega.”
“Yeah, shame about her personality. She told me you were dangerous and asked if I was your sponsor.” He chuckled at the idea. “But I have serious doubts you’d need the lat-” He trailed off at the piercing look on the other’s face. “No way.”
“Good morning. I did, yes, thank you.”
“I know you would have done the same for me, John.”
∙ ∙ ∙
“What the hell did I do wrong?”
“Then I like her already.”
“You shouldn’t do this when you have no interest in following through.”
Mycroft finds his choice.
“Oi, that’s not on-”
It was Bill who made John start the blog. “I redeploy before you do, you berk, and if you get to do interesting things while stationed home, I want to be able to read about it in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere.” John thought that was a fair point, and it wasn’t like he ever said no to Bill. Reading his comments would make the effort absolutely worth it, anyway.
“Um, yes sir. I think he anticipated that I wouldn’t want to be there.”
That annoyed Sherlock too. John playing dumb. Or being dumb. Not knowing the affect he had on Sherlock. It had to be intentional.
Sherlock Holmes must be an idiot, whatever the boss said. He’d have to request something interesting as a thank you to the man for his utter failure to make a claim.
“Not interested, thanks.”
“I haven’t, but that doesn’t mean he won’t ask, which is fine. It was informative to learn the weight of Holmes’s pull. I don’t mind telling you we were in some hot water before he made his opinion clear. The rest fell in line after that. So, keep your wits about you with him.”
“There you go! That’s submitted. How shall we celebrate? I’ve got a few things here to get a good party started.”
When this was over, John would be on his fifth line—first had been his father, may that bastard rot in hell, then Harry, Victor, same sentiments, Mycroft, and now Sebastian. The form only had six lines, so John wondered what proper society would call him for that.
The next day John sought his revenge.
John cut him off. “Look, I know you like to point out when the police are shagging each other, but can you not, please? I know what happened, no deductions needed. He didn’t go feral or anything, didn’t even want me to stop going on cases so it’s fine.”
They lay there together for a moment, feeling the mutual high ebb, before Sebastian finally panted, “Where the fuck’d you learn to snog like that?”
Sherlock paused. “She would have stopped if I spoke to you.” John did open his eyes at that. Searching Sherlock’s face for any sense whatsoever. He looked impeccable once again, and only the faintest flush would suggest anything untoward had just occurred.
They were his omega rights. And on the middle of the page was a line with Harry’s signature next to what could only be Victor’s. John felt the groan escape him, more that he heard it. She couldn’t- she wouldn’t-
“You asked for this?”
“Christ, John.”
“Yes, and it was a foolishly vulnerable position I do not mean to see replicated.”
“No, and I’ve been clean for years. She only knows about it because they like to spring drug busts on me if I annoy them too much.”
John headed out of the room and crossed paths with the younger Holmes in the hall.
“Naturally.”
A man called Gordon scoffed. “This whole drama is why we should have kept omegas out of the military in the first place. All this fuss for-”
“I would never care to speculate on the frequency of similar such circumstances. I am here because this specific case came to my attention and it is the one that I am concerned with. These policies are not my area-”
“I don’t care where he is. I came to ask, if you are not busy, and you aren’t—you’ve read that book at least twice before, the pattern of wear is clear—would you assist on my current case?”
And that was apparently the end of that. John decided not to let himself get bothered over it. Well, much. He didn’t want a bondmate at all and had gone to some lengths in life to avoid one, but Harry had shoved him well past that option now. He’d already agreed to accept whoever Mycroft chose and everything he’d seen suggested his new alpha wouldn’t accept anything substandard, just as a matter of principle. Whoever Mycroft picked would be perfectly bearable, and that was as warm a position on the matter as John was like to reach.
John faces his newest alpha, Mycroft Holmes.
The home they’d arrived at was elegant, classically styled, and enviably snuggled in the heart of London. Mycroft led him through a perfunctory tour, before excusing himself to his home office and John was glad for the privacy. He wanted to bring Bill and Major Sholto up to speed.
“I cannot imagine why that would be your business. John, shall we? The cab is waiting.”
“You do smell so fucking good. You’d smell even better, so much stronger, off those suppressants though.” Victor was cuddled up against John now, an arm draped over his chest and one leg nestled between John’s forcibly splayed ones. “But this will work for tonight.”
John smiled as he rose to leave. “I’ll keep that in mind. The morning pastry routine is a bit much. Go easy with that arm. Keep it dry and change out the bandaging tomorrow.” He deposited disinfectant and a sealed package of gauze on the coffee table. At the door he turned. “It was nice meeting you Sherlock.”
I know the case was weak, but I have reasons for saving a study in pink. Also, my complete lack of planning for the chapter titles is starting to catch up with me. I think I'll have to go back and redo them.
John felt himself harden further. “Sherlock isn’t doing anything because he is a prat running an experiment.”
“But that would be tantamount to the army forgiving Harriet Watson of an irresponsibly accumulated debt,” the beta woman from earlier said, just as calm as before. “Surely you agree that would be a dangerous precedent to set.”
“Naturally you would get my pension.”
Sherlock’s hungry noise drew John’s gaze without him thinking. Their eyes met, and John saw him shudder, gasp, and finish. He’d meant to give Sherlock some privacy in that moment.
She was standing in front of him now, loosening her robe. John disagreed.
“Is that like a private one?”
There was a small, sharp inhale from John. “You were the chemist he wanted?”
“A crime of passion from one of these academics would have been a struggle, but as you say there are no defensive wounds, not even tentative cuts to his chest, only these deep incisions. If they had lived here, once their adrenaline subsided, they would have panicked, used the shower to try to clean up, but there’s been no attempt made, not even to rinse the blood down the drains.”
He returned to find the brothers glowering at each other in mutual silence.
He was moderately outraged when Molly’s red scoop-neck top did not warrant an outburst from Sherlock.
The subsequent row in the shop changing room had been loud and public, all originating from Sherlock’s exasperation with John for thinking the linen shirt would be acceptable.
Miller was first off the draw. “’Attempted’ being the operative word, as I understand it, Major Sholto. There was nothing wrong with the paperwork mister, ah,” the alpha flipped through her dossier for a moment, “Mr. Victor Trevor submitted for Captain Watson was there? It was due to your request that the withdrawal was held up?”
