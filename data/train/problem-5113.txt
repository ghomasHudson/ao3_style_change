“So, my lovely unicorn. What else can you do with your magic?”
"It’s my brother in trouble," he growled at the court mage, pushing away thoughts of Cas and the dragon child. Sam, he told himself, Sam was what was important.
“Uhm, I think we are going to leave now.” Sam said.
Yeah that was probably a good idea. There was no way they would be able to kill Castiel. Not knowing how big he really was. He looked dangerous and scary in his dragon form as well as dangerous and scary in his human form. Well, his nakedness sort of took from that but Dean tried to ignore that.
It's when Dean got back that he realized something wasn't right. He hopped off his horse as quickly as he could and rushed inside. Debris littered the ground, Gabriel and Balthazar had been knocked out and laid out on the floor. He placed a hand over each of their hearts; he sighed in relief when he felt the rise of their chests.
“I don't know where just yet.” Castiel responded as though he could read Dean's mind. “If I could go back with you. To my brothers. We could figure all of this out when we are all under the same roof.”
slams his teeth shut, and reverberates through his skull, leaving a bad taste in his mouth.
to fly. He’d been picked up by a giant roc one time and carried to its eyrie, and it had taken the better part of a decade afterwards to stop his knees from wobbling.
“And do I detect the scent of…fresh human in the air?”
“I can name about seven things,” Balthazar interjected but was quickly met with a fist to the face by Gabe’s free hand, sending him back into a chair to shut up.
“I… uh, I’m sorry for touching it.” Sam spoke up.
Dean caught the sigh and smile and elbowed Sam. “Are you serious right now? This is not the time for moon eyes. We need to make sure the egg is okay.” Making sure he wouldn’t get hurt from what now seemed like the world’s longest MMA fight, without the octagon, Dean made his way over to the wiggling egg. He picked it up gently and snuck back over just in time for a wing to pop out. “HOLY SH…” Dean almost yelled, but Sam covered his mouth.
Sam stepped further back, Gabriel and Balthazar flanking both of his sides to make sure nothing would go wrong.
“You think you are all high and mighty because you outrank me?” Balthazar escaped Gabriel’s grasp and pinned him against a nearby wall.
His feet slipped on the gold as he climbed, sending a rain of coins crashing down the edge of the mountain. Dean flinched, and, now on his hands and knees, kept clambering up toward the prisoner.
The cold, curt statement stopped Dean in his tracks. He whirled around with a glare. Gabriel didn't back down. Instead, he squared his shoulders and glared back at Dean with just as much virulence.
The man leaned in slowly and Dean tried to back up but had nowhere to go. He closed his eyes and turned his head away. The man, dragon, whatever, leaned in and pressed his nose against his neck, sniffing him.
"How?" he whispered. "How the hell..."
“I don’t think, I know.” A firm hand rocketed to Balthazar’s breastbone, causing him to fly across the room and crash on top of a table, forcing it to snap at the impact point.
Sam nodded. “Just underneath the entrance; see that overhang? It’s out of sight from above in both directions, and hidden by all the spray.”
"When this over," he whispered shyly, "I'd like..." He trailed off, a question in his eyes.
Balthazar looked at him wearily. "In Lucifer's kingdom."
Okay, Reg has done an amazing first chapter so all the credit goes there because we got such an amazing storyline to work with
Dean stopped climbing, staring back at him.
Lucifer's.
Brothers will be brothers I guess.
manifested,” she whispered, translucent-grey wings unfurling from her body as she rose from the floor and closed the distance between them. She draped herself over Castiel’s back, hands stroking his face and hair. Dean’s blood boiled. “Tell me, Clarence, how does it feel?”
Dean cleared his throat and leaned in to press a quick kiss to his mouth. "Yeah, Cas," he muttered. "Me too."
“There will be no termination. This dragonkin is going to be born.”
Balthazar didn't protest but Gabriel's eyes narrowed.
And it clicked in Dean's head. Maybe...
“What happened? I heard the roaring and then we-” Sam gestured to the horses “-felt the earth move, causing these two to nearly bolt had I not tied them up. Were there more of them besides Castiel?” Sam asked his questions in a rush, making Dean chuckle.
“I'm his father. There is no need for you to protect him. I'll do that.”
“Why would another dragon hold one of their own as captive?” Sam wondered out loud.
Castiel’s growling tapered off. Dean tried to shimmy a little to dislodge the coins over his face, but it made more noise than he thought was wise, so he stopped.
“We should tether the horses as close as we can,” Dean said. “In case we need to make a run for it. Still, I don’t want Baby getting carried off…”
He wants to object, wants to provide a different solution,
“Do you
Hello!!
Gabriel’s golden eyes rested thoughtfully on Sam who blushed under the scrutiny. “Very well, you may speak. But if I don’t like what I hear, be assured you’ll pay a steep price for your treachery.”
Not to mention Lucifer had stolen Cas's... well, whatever the hell the kid was to Cas. He supposed Cas was at least his caretaker, given how much effort he'd put into protecting the egg.
“No,” Castiel shook his head, holding his head high as he took a few steps forward. “I understand the trials Lucifer tried in the past, but those humans were well versed in our world, were tainted by the old magic. Dean is different. This human has never been touched by magic, he’s the perfect…”
"We tried to fend Lucifer off—"
“He’s not a plaything, Meg. I was–”
An hour later the horses were watered and fed, Sam and Dean had bathed, and upon discovering Dean’s injuries a healer named Hannah sporting skyblue scales had been summoned. She’d clearly not been thrilled to have to take care of a hunter, but she’d obeyed Gabriel’s bidding unquestioningly.

Thanks for Destimushi for running this you're a champ.
“So your magic truly
Before they could turn to leave though Castiel spoke up.
The gentle kiss Castiel pressed to his lips did little to quell his nerves, but Dean nodded anyways and followed Castiel out of his prison. It was time to get both of their families back.
Meg laughed darkly. “Oh, but you should be, luscious mortal.”
When Sam came to, he looked around swiftly, his eyes dropping to the floor and the pile of bones he was sitting on. He couldn't move, his hands had been tied to the wall and Jack… where was Jack?
The hit takes him by surprise, and not for the first time today the air leaves his lungs as he flies across the room again.
“Kelly was a handmaiden here at the castle and one of the first Lucifer kidnapped,” Gabriel explained. “She was a lovely girl, and we all liked her very much. When she was kidnapped, it was a great blow to us. To have someone taken right from our midst, from the heart of the kingdom—Lucifer really made his disdain for our family clear.”
Holy shit. How had Dean not noticed how massive they were before?
Dean nodded. "I'll be here," he said softly. "I'll hide out behind the rock and wait for you. If she attacks..." he didn't finish the sentence, but Cas seemed to understand.
Thanks to
The attempt to close her jaw is also too little too late, as Dean had hoped.
“Now we know why Castiel took great lengths to give it to us,” Gabriel stated, eyeing the egg with awe, “only Gaia knows what would happen if he were to possess this power.”
Sam yelled, shaking his legs in the air.
And then she lunged at him.

“Gosh if we aren’t looking extra pretty today. You have such a glow about you.”
A hot wind rolled out to meet them. Then, strangely, it recoiled, like the cave itself was inhaling. Dean grimaced. Someone was home.
Gabriel held the tiny kin closer to him, making sure that Lucifer didn't get so much as a glance at him.
Dean glanced around the room, looking for a sign. Scales had been left behind.
All of them immediately stopped and turned to look at Gabriel, who stared them all down with a dark gaze. His posture and stance emanated his nobility and the authority that came with it. The three men stared back at the prince with sheepish expressions.
"And where exactly are you going to go look?"
Thatpeculiarone, your turn next! Also watch this space for some awesome art from Adaille to be added next week!
Dean scowled as Baby slipped underneath him. Sam’s horse, Dodge, had already bloodied one of his knees, which prompted Dean to suggest they walk beside the horses instead. As Sam pointed out, though, it was hard to make a speedy getaway when you had to mount up first. With a bit of foresight Dean might have thought to apply studs to their horseshoes, but it was too late for that now. He cringed as his mount slipped again.
When he opens his eyes there are no longer people in front of him, but Dragons again.
Sam glanced back the way they’d come. By now the opening to the waterfall was very distant, yet as they’d walked through it the mouth had seemed to tower over them, as large as any dragon the pair had seen.
Cas roars again, and charges Meg. His chain rattles, but doesn’t pull him short as he slams his body into her, and she flys across the room, slamming into the wall. Dean feels the slam reverberate, and he gives a sympathetic wince. She may have tried to eat him, but even still.
“Yes. A boy. His name is Jack.” Dean lowered his voice just a little, for who, he didn't know. Dean swallowed hard. “We--- we have to keep him away from Lucifer. No matter the cost. It's a common factor that we all share.”
As Gabriel closed the book, all Dean could do was blink as he tried to process the lore. He looked over at the egg, which rested only a few feet from him – the gold and silver egg littered in jewels. It was hard to believe that this egg currently housed an unborn dragonkin, one that possibly had the ability to destroy the world.
His only advantage is surprise. He needs to time this perfectly, or he’ll end up as Dragon collateral.
"Stop crowding me," he muttered. "I'm —"
This was it, he thought, they'd found Sammy and Jack and fucking Lucifer—
Dean blew out a slow breath, sinking down to crouch with his back against the rock. His lips still tingled from the phantom press of Cas’ lips, and he forced himself not to reach up and touch them. He knew without looking that Castiel was standing as close to the entrance as he could with his chain, his arms crossed over his bare chest and waiting.
“When have we ever been that lucky?” Sam sighed. “Come on, we should keep going.”
“Castiel,” purred the voice. “Please?”
Moving in tiny increments, Dean slowly began raising his head. Hopefully Castiel was far enough away to keep the other thing’s attention on him instead of the small pile of gold moving of its own accord.
He took care of his sick mother, and little brother meanwhile he had to go through his alcoholic father's shit's which he never wants to remember ever.
within seconds he received the hospital name and Dean was on his way to the hospital as Sam promised he will be there too, soon as possible.
"Yo assholes W'dare you huh?" Dean groaned at the boys who were shivering with fear and begging for forgiveness. His voice was tipsy but he didn't gave a damn about it for a bit.
"Castiel, will you go out with me, please? I really like you. And you are a really great guy, you are so nice and very kind hearted person, I really really like you and I really like to get to know about you more, and I want to spend some time with you with all the respects, please say yes and god please take this, this flowers for you, something beautiful for someone Beautiful" Dean smiled with him. Castiel's face got colored with a beautiful shade of red.
There was a Doctor who walked toward them very fast and the nurses and attendants were running with him beside him telling something to the doctor.
"Hey, you okay there?" Dean asked softly.
So tell me how you feel now"
Dean ❤ //
Castiel actually didn't say anything for Dean's early confession too. So he made a face like he was thinking. And Dean found that's so cute of him.
But Cas isn't that strong to open the damn door and go check around for Dean. He is so weak. His neck hurts Cas slowly turns toward their dressing table.  he looks at the mirror and he starts to sobbing as he can notice those dark purple bruises all over his neck, it can clearly visible Dean's long fingers prints on his neck, and also he has a bruise on his right cheek under his right eye. Cas feels his whole body shakes with pain and fear.
"Damn boy, don't act like a baby, what did you do before a few minutes ago? Huh? I'm on a alert these days about bullying in the college. I know you were up to something about that innocent boy, what's his name .. Ah, Castiel. Aren't you boy? Didn't you threaten him a few minutes ago?" Bobby shouted at him.
Anyhow Dean seems like he never let go of Castiel away. So Castiel has hope now. Dean will wait for him. Yes, he will definitely wait if they really meant to be together.
"Actually I don't know if you eating those or not, but here we go, just try it," Castiel said putting a smoking spaghetti and meatballs plate and roasted vegetable plate, then he brought roasted chicken breast and few cheesy garlic bread slices.
"Listen to me Mr.Jealous, we have to get an appointment soon as possible” Cas brings it again and looks at Dean with puppy eyes. He smoothly shoves a few of Dean’s hair which on his forehead.
"Hi, bathroom stealer" Cas gasped and turned as the voice came from very near to his face. Of course, it's Dean and Cas was speechless for a second because Dean was in his personal space already.
"Like father like son, Just eat first, talk later " Dean says with a proud voice.
"Whatever Cassie, I'm just telling you just forget all of your stupid reasons and give that guy a chance, and I mean dude, c'mon... Dean got you a puppy...A puppy!!!! Just give him a chance" Gabriel begged.
"Don't call me that name you dumbass" Jo groaned making Dean laugh louder.
.....
"Yes Sam, I already heard her. But I don't understand, why she doesn't want to talk to me? I thought you said that she wants to talk to me earlier?"
Dean groans but after a sharp eye roll, he pulls back from Cas and withdraws his hand from Cas's ass hesitantly.
"Sam, put it on speakers please?"
But too late, Asshole destroyed his whole evening. He never expected something like this. His clean beautifully smelled sweater is now muddy and wet like hell. And he was shivering with anger, and also with cold.
"Yes, Dean I managed to give a call to Michael my eldest brother. He promised to inform my parents and my other siblings. they are on their way but it will take more hours for them to reach here" Castiel answered.
"Sam said what Cas?" He asked softly looking at Cas's eyes directly, he put another step, reducing the space between them.
"Um, nothing, it's just this. Arr, I don't know Gabe, you all just messing with my head. that's what happened" He says glaring again.
"Dean didn't you sleep? babe you have to wake early in the morning" Castiel says as he melting into Dean's warm body.
"Look Dean, you know I'm your best friend but you still keep hiding secrets from me, I know that and it's okay because I know when it's time to say it you will eventually tell it to me, but I'm kind of know what's going on but I'm not gonna push it because that's not true friends doing, okay? But I want you to know that whatever happens I'm here for you man, okay?" Charlie said in a very lovely voice to make Dean feel better.
"Sam I'm sorry for rushing out like that, my brother had hospitalized and he is not doing okay and.."
Sam smirked.
"Wow, Cas I.. I mean I never knew all those stuff, but hell I can tell your parents were very unfair, and those two assholes you were dating, were fucking assholes to say stuff like that, I'm sorry for them about losing someone like you and insult to the very beautiful art like this" Dean said squeezing Castiel's hand.
"Son of a bitch" He closed the door and fell into his bed.
"Mmh hmm" Castiel replied softly.
"Mr. Winchester can you please forget about that"
"Oh yeah why not" He grabbed her hand and turned to go to the car park. Then his eyes hit on someone.
"Okay Dean you are practically sitting on his lap, and he is asking can you move away from his lap," Sam said smirking at his brother.
Castiel nodded wiping his cheeks.
"Okay, fine" Dean pouts.
And Gabe didn't forget to give common big bro death threatening to Dean before grabbing him for a bear hug. Sam was beaming and said he knew that this is gonna happen soon before Christmas ends.
Surely to the sea
"Hey, Cas, it's okay, let me help you. This is what we going to do. Okay? I'm going to flip us. Then I'm going to get up first and don't worry I will close my eyes when I get up. And you can wrap your towel. Okay?" Dean asked kindly staring at Cas as Cas looked at Dean's eyes for the first time. Because Cas can't believe Dean be kind to him like this. After the morning incidents in the college, Cas was expecting some punches and insults from Dean. But instead, Dean was being so kind to him. This must be a dream.
And that's how Dean started asking Castiel out. Since that day Castiel has rejected him until now.
Michael says but Gabriel doesn't want to give up.
Castiel hummed into the hug and hugged him back.
"Wait, it's still hot," Castiel said and quickly blew on it without breaking eye contact with Dean. Dean's heart stopped a beat and he licked his lips. This little teaser is making me go nuts, Dean thought while staring at him.
Cas's full-body goes to heavy shivering and Dean grins at that. A sharp breath escapes from Cas.
"And of course, Rufus kept crying that he can't keep you in the team as you have missed practice more than a month now repeatedly. What are you even doing son, I know Mary's accident took your time. but it was mouth ago, but now why in the world you missed the practice? You want to resign from the team? I thought you were obsessed with football"
Then Castiel got his consciousness.
"You think I'm handsome baby? Mmm and strong too huh?. well, let me show you how strong I am my love" Dean says and lifts Cas in one hand when his moans turn into a yelp.
"Is that all?" She asked with a shock on her face.
This time Dean licked his lips nervously and motioned to the pie.
Mary came near to Castiel and hugged him so warm hug. It was so lovely. Castiel never expected that and he barely hold the tears, because it's been a very very long time he got a hug like this. He hugged back Mary and he closed his eyes and he reminded about his Mom. After second Mary pull out and took Castiel's both hands.
"Oh it's okay Dean, maybe next time then," Cas said casually. But Dean raised an eyebrow at him with a smug grin.
"Mmm really? And why is that?"
Dean said and he was not sure how Castiel reacts to it. But Castiel was staring at Dean for the whole time. and Dean can swear his eyes were filled with Love? Oh it's that can be true?.
"Oh god these are Golden, Mr. Winchester you know exactly what to bring your loved ones. bless you, Cassie sweetie just say yes to him, for this donuts sake, ughh they are delicious" Donna interrupted with a mouth full of donuts and powder all over around her mouth from powered donut which she was eating.
"Castiel? Wha? What did you mean by that?" Dean asked with a shocked and red face.
"Hey, I thought if we have breakfast in here with your brother, we can make him cheer up a bit, so I brought us some breakfast" Dean grind and gave Gabriel a bag, who grabbed it like a tiger.
He answered with a trustworthy smile. But he knew he is not because he felt he is gonna fainting but he tried his best to ignore that because that's the last thing he wants to happen now. If he say that he is feeling not well he also has to admit in the hospital and his brother will come here and get to know all the things happen. Nah he didn't want that.
Cas quickly glanced at him.
But also Castiel got a bit angry about this flirty king. How dare he talking like this and why the hell his body decided to got blush for every and each word coming out from the Dean's mouth.
Dean said and smiled warmly Sam gulped with horror in his eyes.
"And since you are afraid to take me into your room, I'm gonna check it in here," Dean said and leaned over to the open door not going inside, then scan all over inside the room, nodding his head, making a serious face like he is judging.
Cas whines.
"What? are you telling me that I'm an asshole? how dare Novak? Insulting me when you are sitting on my own car" Dean said. But not in real anger, just he was going on his natural habitat.
"And don't worry, you guys know each other for almost a year now, right? So I'm pretty sure he will come around soon, I promise you, everything will be okay soon, you are the best guy I've ever met in my life, so you deserve better and you gonna have it soon, coz I pretty sure this your "pretty princess" Got an instinct, and eyes. So he will come around soon" Charlie's sincere voice made Dean's heart warm as he pulled his head out of his hands smiling softly.
"Yeah of course Angel, anything, what's it?" Dean said like it's an obvious thing.
Finally when they pulled out of the hug Dean still staring at the love of his life.
Cas : where are you dragging me Dean? what’s wrong?
Is that.. Is that Dean pouting at Castiel? But why? Why would he doing so? Isn't that not normal?
Dean said like still, he can't believe it.
"Hey No, no, no. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter too, man are you kidding me right now, this is not stupid, this is the best gift, love both of them, wow Cas thank you so much, even you didn't know me then, you have got me my favorites, how even that possible?" Dean's voice was so excited.
"Cas?"
"Stop it, Sam, I get it, just stop talking right now," Dean said and Sam shut his mouth for everyone's good. Finally, Dean dropped Sam in his school before went to his college.
And your big kudos and comments are so much welcome.😍😍😍😍😍
"It's nothing Sam, don't worry, " Castiel said letting go of Sam's hand.
“Yes, it’s correct Guess honey. So sleep well, good night Dean” Cas press a peck on Dean’s pouting lips, and press his back to Dean again and pulled his hand on his chest, then closes his eyes. but Dean doesn't get sleep, he can’t, he was horny. he stays there like that few minutes.
.....
Dean said directly.
"And besides if you want more proofs, my girlfriend Lilith is not a Lesbian as of course you know we are dating, and not even a Bi. But we make a bet and she fucked this random lesbian girl from the bar, and she even got photos to prove it. So she won" He said again.
"And finally how about you Gabe? you broke up with Kali two years ago and you still single. How about that?" Castiel asked.
Dean chuckles again.
"I mean, this. The Impala, your car. It is Beautiful"
"I'm feeling much better now Cas,  I mean the breathing is not hard anymore" Castiel nodded happily.
"And I promise you, I will let you take me anywhere you want to," Cas says as he knows how kinky Dean can be. Dean's pouty lips change a bit as he glances at Cas with raises eyebrows.
The next second Castiel gave Dean another cheeky smile and then he was walking towards the elevator. Almost running.
In the shop Dean met a gorgeous man who also want to buy the last vegan eggnog in the shop.
Dean's heart filled with warmth.
Dean looked like he got surprised by that.
Gabriel brought him some cakes, buns, and delicious-looking pastries from his bakery. And also he scolded Cas for not eating much and telling him that he is so thin more than the last time he saw him.
Strange, very strange. Cas can't understand Dean's plan over this ridiculous and suspicious act. But however, Cas felt a relief when Dean has gone away from his eyesight.
"Guards.. Guards. Hurry" Within second two guards and the female omega storm into his chamber.
Castiel lifted his face to see who is that, but after he saw Charlie his expression got different. He quickly adjusted on his seat and bend down a little bit on the table like telling a secret.
Two- Dean Cried out and Cummed inside Cas'ss Ass hole. Pulse and pulse without breaking the rhythm and Dean groaned sheepishly. His hot thick cum shooter deeper inside Castiel's as Cas couldn't resist so also moaned like a porn star.
"Okay, Cas that's nice. not only a pretty face but strong too right? I'm impressive"
.....
"Mmm my good baby, good night love"
"Of course I am"
"Okay hurry young man, go and get a shower, you are completely covered with chicken gravy. Oh send your clothes back with Sam, I will clean and dry them for you honey" Mary said pushing still laughing Cas and Sam towards the upstairs.
"Aww you are in love with him Dean, I'm so happy about you, I never thought I'd see Dean Winchester madly in love with someone," Charlie said softly, not in a teasing way but very warmly like she is wishing him.
"What do you want Winchester?" Castiel asked, voice bit raised.
"Oh really? And hey.. Cas was never being your's mister, okay?" Castiel said giving him a pointed look.
When they finished the breakfast Sam suggested that they should prepare the Christmas tree after that. Dean and Sam were already brought and fixed a huge tree but just waited for Gabriel and Castiel to come around to decorate it. So they agreed with his idea.
"Shut the fuck up you stupid demon, you are not my alpha, I'm not your omega and never will be" Cas yells and hits alpha's head with the back of his dragger. With that Dean falls and passes out.
"Wait, I just want to talk with you Cas, just want to check you okay, and.." Dean was kept talking but Cas cut off him angrily.
Thank you for reading.
Suddenly his phone started to buzzing and Castiel glanced over it. An unknown number. Castiel ignored it. He didn't have a mood for dramas right now. The phone stopped buzzing in few seconds but causing Castiel more annoying it started to ring again.
"Stop it, Gabe, you are lucky that I found you, if our father gets to know about this, you will end up in the dungeon. Now please let's close this door and go out. I will take care of the reseal of this area. Now go"
"Yeah sure Dean I will" Sam answered again without suspected his brother.
Cas blushed furiously.
"I will, and these foods are really delicious, it's feeling like home, I mean foods are amazing" He praised her.
………………………………….
Dean's whole body shivered with that unexpected kiss, as his hand eventually goes to his cheek. Dean smiled brightly looking into Castiel's frustrated face.
Dean felt a relief. Maybe he can talk with Charlie tonight. He just wanted a sense of peace. That's all.
Castiel can't believe what just happened. Lisa is always like this, hurts people's emotions, and tried to poke in others' wounds. But Castiel never argue with her, he was just not that kind of man, so he just let that go but deep down, he couldn't forget her words.
"Wow did you danced too" Now Dean was on cloud nine when he heard that.
Dean pinches Cas's one nipple, sucking on his bottom lips. Cas mewls into Dean's lips softly wrapping his hands around his lover's neck.
His mind goes through all the things that happened earlier. He just wanted to disappear or be invisible right now. Especially around Dean. He can't even think about what will happen in college tomorrow. What kind of pranks and dramas will pull by Dean tomorrow? He shivered with that thought.
They walked away from himas Azazel murmured as "tik tok, tik tok, tik tok"
.....
"Dean, actually I'm sorry. When I went to get gifts, I didn't know about you very well, and we were never met before at that time. so I just got some very common gift. I'm sorry it's not a much" Castiel admitted worriedly.
Dean was top of the Castiel but didn't put his weight on him as his elbows were bracketed Cas protectively. Dean didn't pull out from Cas yet and Both lovers started to laugh their ass off as Cas wiped tears out of his eyes.
He said while poking Kevin here and there. The poor kid twisted and stayed still, he was like a rat who faced a wild cat. He started to shiver with fear and cursed himself for never seeing them before it too late.
Cas says but he was smiling.
The doorbell rang off and Sam jumped out of the bed, running towards the door. He opened the door to very confused looking Cas standing in front of the door.
.....
"Hey Dean, you are in Charlie's, right?"
"It's okay Cas, it's the first time you saw me like this, but trust me this is going to be fade soon. I know that. And because you are here with me now this will be gone soon" Dean said starting at Castiel's eyes. Castiel's palm still on Dean's cheek. Castiel felt his palm getting warmer as he can feel his own cheeks getting burn.
Are they trying to trick me or something like that? Finally, Cas smiled thinking about it.
Charlie, Jo, and Meg shared confusing faces and Jo rolled her eyes.
Freddy :
"So Mary, my apologies for not came back to see you. I really wanted to come, but because of these little things that I had to deal with, I was kinda busy past weeks, that's why I missed it" He said because that's the only way making her think that Castiel never ignores her. Because he didn't want to Mary to think that he didn't care about her. Okay, what are you doing Castiel?
Castiel was looking at the entire seen and quickly get his eyes on his books soon as Dean rushed out before Azazel make any drama here. He saw the look on Dean's eye, they were not angry eyes, but he was staring, Castiel shivered for a moment with that thought. Never mind, you know what ever. Because everytime everything about Dean, ending up with a disaster on Castiel's life. So he left that scene from his mind. He just want to live in peace for few minutes. That's it. Then he noticed Azazel is still checking out him.
C'mon Alastair, you look like you gonna cry anytime soon, can't you run faster than that" Dean laughed out running very fast and passing Alastair. And of course, Alastair was gritting his teeth and cursing under his breath, seems like hundredths of time right now.
"Oh but it was you. I flirted with you, only with you"
"Hey Winchester, how you doing man?" Suddenly Dean heard Azazel's demonic voice as he started gritting his teeth.
// good morning Dean, Happy Valentine's Day :) //
"Because of you Dean, do you think he will come here ever again knowing that you are living here too? no way, even he will never think about that" Sam said sadly as Dean also got the point. But Dean is a good planner and he had already thought about that early as he smirked.
"Anytime Angel. Told you I'm there for you anytime and for anything" Dean answered. Castiel was happy. Because Dean is really, really cares about him. And Castiel was very important to Dean. In Castiel's life, no one gave that kind of special place like Dean.
Castiel can feel his panic surged through him very strongly.
"Look at you pretty little boy, see what that guy did to you, he must be really hate you, isn't it now boys?"
"Ah yes yes wait I'm texting right now," Sam said while his fingers running through his phone.
"What? How did you know about that?"
But Dean's face lit with that like a Christmas tree.
"No, Cas it's completely fine. we can see you guys having a brotherly moment there" Dean said smiling at him kindly.
"No, actually I'm fine, absolutely fine"
"You better"
"You slut, I will show you how to satisfy a hungry bitch hole like yours. You fucked with another man behind me, aren't you? Because you wanted more cocks and not enough a one cock for that hungry hole. So Come, I will give you a real medicine for your slutty hole, you fucking bitch"  Dean yells at him and turns him around within a second.
"Charlie, stop okay, just stop, I don't want to talk about it, I mean NEVER want to talk about it. okay? And for your question, No. I didn't beat him After... After l.. I.. Um you know, after the big time, nope never hit him. But yeah just mess around him. But these guys from the football team did something to him. you know I can't do anything about that. I'm not responsible for that, so technically I'm with clean hands, okay? Now tell me why you bring it now, what's make you doing so" Dean voice kind of surprise also teasing.
But Mary was so happy to have Cas there and that made Cas's heart a little bit happy. He wanted this, wanted to come and make sure Mary is not upset with him, and also he wished Dean would not be around. So it happened. But seems like Cas was wrong.
Before he answered that they heard a tiny voice ahead of them.
"mmmhhh Dean, aah babe no...stop I can't take it more gonna cum. Ahh but need your cock inside me when I cum. Need you babe" Cas wailed and Dean quickly leaned back wiping his wet chin with the back of his hand and lined up his cock.
Dean’s face filled with the most beautiful smile Cas had ever seen in his life.
"Yeah but it's Valentine's Day and all you deserved is gifts, I can't help it, sweetheart. I know red is the common color of Valentine's Day and also red roses. But Cas, your eyes are the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen and I was falling for them since the first day I see you. So I'm kinda addicted to them and my favorite color is blue because of them. So I wanted to give something beautiful like these blue roses to the most beautiful person I have ever met. And something sweet for the sweetest person I ever know" Dean said and gave the blue roses bundle and chocolate box to Cas. Castiel's face was turned red as he blushed with those compliments.
"Okay Dean seriously, I'm not gorgeous, I'm not an Angel and obviously I'm not little. I'm just a few inches lower than you, see?" Castiel said get more close to him. Dean groaned.
.....
The doctor smiled at them.
"No problem Gabriel,. I'm happy that I could help you" Dean smiled.
Castiel heard the puppy's little happy barking, howls, and growls and his older brother's voice on his porch. His face lit up with a happy smile while he walked to the porch.
"Thanks, Cas, but  I should admit that it's kind of lit now after you came here," Dean said in a very genuine voice but Castiel laughed at him.
Castiel's day sucked from the start. First Alfie started to flirt with him, it was awkward. then Dean's crazy and strange acting, like he care a bit then again switched to hating mood. Then Alfie got pissed at Dean then stormed to Coach Singer's office and complain about Dean without even don't care when Castiel begging to stop. Castiel didn't know what it would be but he was ready to face the consequences too because of Alfie's stupid anger. Castiel sometimes wished if he can invisible to Dean. Because he was fed up with his troubles. Dean made sure to make his life a living hell even without a fair reason. Castiel hissed with painful memories. He was walking home after college suddenly he felt a huge loneliness. he was exhausted from the day after all. Even now when he went home he will get a shower then probably not making any lunch and will study more. Then will have something for dinner then fell asleep. That's it nothing special or no one there to talk to. Sometimes he wants to scream loud and cry when his heart is filled with all the pain and loneliness he felt.
Supernatural season 15 episode 18 is definitely a turning point for all of us💚💙.
Cas said and blushed as his cheeked get pink.
Okay, that's exactly not the best way to go to Dean's heart. How dare she talk to his baby like that. But Dean didn't say anything right now because she is so sexy and hot like this. Dean's eyes touched a bit of lust and he licked his lips.
Suddenly Dean's scent started to change. And Cas catches it from the beginning, but he didn't show any change. It's really started to getting stronger as now it indicates a very sad, losing hope, and very sick Alpha. But why? This demon alpha must be trained very well to act so natural and realistically.
Castiel hang up and then quickly went home. Since he confirmed the dinner plan, his heart was filled with different, different feelings. But mostly he felt happy and he liked it. He wanted to feel often that happy feeling. He sighed and quickened his steps.
"No Dean I already had mine, I'm full, thank you"
Thank you all.
"Dean, I want to talk with you," Castiel said when Dean giving him his mug.
Azazel's face lightens up the second Castiel said that.
"And Cas, as I already told you, I also have to tell you about me. I'm never going to hide anything from you. So I also going to tell you all on that day" Dean added.
"Yes, of course, please take this, I brought it to Sam, but I can order another one for him, so no problem," He said offering said coffee to Dean's hand.
And hold on a second. Oh shit, what has he done? He just left that sick kid there to suffering from that panic attack alone? Damn Castiel wasn't in a good situation when Dean left him there. Dean's heartbeat stopped for a second as he understood what has he done. He was a dumbass, he should have think more. He saw clearly how difficult it is to Castiel when that attack hit him last night. Shit, and somehow, he was the one, who triggered Castiel's panic attack today. And instead of helping him for get out of that,  Dean left Castiel there alone. What a great beginning Dean?
"Yeah fine, thanks" Sam shouted back running towards the bathroom.
"Now Mr. Winchester if you don't mind can you please move away then I can cook again," Castiel said teasingly.
Also, Benny and Sam are carrying very heavy and unconscious Dean on their hands to their camp. They are middle of the forest right now and Sam is in a shock and shaking with fear.
Castiel said with a very low and sad voice without contacting Dean's eyes. Dean was shocked when he heard Castiel's request. And of course, it pissed off Dean to know that Castiel doesn't want to talk to him anymore
If Cas wasn't fully delighted before now he is. This man is full of wonder. He never failed to surprise Cas every time they meet.
"Wow, very few people know about that how did you know that Deano, did my brother tell you about it?"
"You don't have to, my beloved. You don't have to be jealous. I'm yours. Only yours" Cas moans and Dean smiles. A lovely genuine smile as always he gives to the love of his life, his Cas. He leans down and kisses Cas's lips lovingly. His hard cock gives a huge throb inside of Cas's pussy.
"Um yeah.. You know just lived the same place and stuck with school and family" Dean responded weakly. He almost forgot how they ended their friendship in the past until Cas remind it right now, yeah he hated Castiel before when he was young but it was a long time ago but the hate never grows up neither not washed out, it's just been there not updated because he completely forgot about Castiel. okay not completely. He Remembered Castiel when the first time he kissed a girl when he was 12 years old. He had to mentally fight for push the Blue eyes his mind showing him for the entire seconds of the kiss. Then he ended up the kiss murmuring "Cas" causing the girl named whatever Dean couldn't remember pushed him away saying her name is not Cas.
"Um excuse me, can I know who is the owner of these heavenly smelling donuts?" Donna asked with a huge grin on her face.
Cas screams and cries but Dean doesn’t give a fuck about that, he is shivering with anger and keeps his nails dig in Cas’s hips and questioning him about how he betrayed him.
And the other reason Castiel didn't like to bake much, because baking takes time. so the whole time he had to stay along then after he has to eat along. So that's why he always makes sure to settle with very little meals very quickly or most of the time missing lunches and dinners as sleeping with an empty stomach. He was used to that now.
Dean applies the ointment like a mediation and Cas chuckles when Dean finished it and looked at Cas with puppy eyes. Cas knew that look.
"Hey c'mon Dean, if you hate that fag that's much this is a good chance for you and we can remind the whole college that who are you again, and also show us who are you, because man, we also forget who you were before" He smirked.
For some reason, Dean didn't felt angry. His heart sink when Castiel said that he hit him when he was having lunch. Shit, He was a bastard. He could have think more. But also he understood that he owed an apology. Hell, not a one, a lot of apologies.
"Yes, I knew my mind is not completely unuseful. Cassie, you know what is my last memory with this word?"
"Well, I really wanted a perfect picture, you know. You are in that tank crop top and planting those seeds in your garden. Mmm, what a yummy thing to watch" Dean actually wished if he can see that scene.
"and it's "Sam" okay? I'm also very glad to hear that too" Sam joined smiling at him. Gabriel quickly looked at him grinning.
Castiel stayed staring at Dean for seconds, chewing on his bottom lip, His eyes were blank. No emotions in there. Just blank but still beautiful and shining like a sky.
"Yes, Dean?"
"By the way, Merry Christmas you Handsome blue eyes"
Dean was singing along the song played in the setup, when he notices Castiel. He can see Castiel clearly even he was still walking towards him a bit far. Wearing a nerd sweater just the typical Castiel. Matching to his nerd's face. Dean thought.
Dean felt his mouth went dry. But he got this, he should answer Cas today or sooner no excuses now.
"Definitely a CUTE and definitely a COUPLE" she pointed it out.
Dean Winchester is a mean cook. But he wasn't normally cooking or bake because he didn't want to drag old dark memories back. And also he was the owner of a company so obviously, he was too busy cooking. but to be honest he loved cooking and baking. And he knew it's a good way to express love to someone. So after thinking for hours, finally he decided to bake a little thing for Castiel. For saying sorry and also asking him out.
" "Cas",  that's the name I used to call you when we used to be best friends," Dean said staring at Castiel's bright blues which was now wetting with tears and that's it. Castiel's grabbed his own neck as he felt someone tighten his neck because he really got hard to breathe properly. And Dean didn't see it coming until now. Dean's mind got another good few seconds to process what's happening as his eyes went wide.
"Ouch, that's hurt though" Dean yelled over his shoulder climbing the stairs, going toward his room.
Dean couldn't take his eyes from Cas's face. Finally, Cas opened his eyes. Dean was staring into his bluest eyes. Cas also failed to tear his eyes from the most beautiful green eyes in front of him. They were beautiful and now Dean's eyes trail down to Cas's shaking lips.
'Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak'
"Yeah see ya" Dean yelled their back.
"Gabriel came to took me and I cried hugging him like an hour. I told him what happened and he tried to storm out to the Orphanage, telling me that he gonna kill that man, but I cried again and told him I can't go there again. Then Gabriel calmed down a bit and he took me to a very small and dirty apartment. He apologizes for the late and told me he was trying to find a place for me because he thought that place was too dirty and bad for me" Castiel wiped his tears.
Castiel was carrying a water bottle for Dean and standing bit near to the playground more than other kids because he wanted to see his best friend very well. But suddenly one boy kicked the ball and next second unexpectedly it's hit on Castiel's face.
"I'm pretty sure Dean is up to something, Benny" Charlie whispers to Benny who nodded with a knowing look.
"Oh okay thank you for inviting Mary that's very kind of you and of course we will talk about that later, okay then I will call you Mary." He said so because he didn't want to upset this sweet woman.
"Pie"
"Look, Cas yes it is, but I don't want to make you upset, okay? Please don't angry with me over this"
"Okay answer those later, but Where's Cas?" Dean asked checking inside the kitchen.
Dean slowly moved his cock and then Cas remembered that Dean never pulled out and his cock still inside him.
"What is that Winchester? Is it going to blast? Oh god do you going to blast something on me right now?" Castiel's voice got dangerously shaking and he went pale within a second as Dean's eyes went wide.
Cas sign as not to speak.
Dean said dramatically this time and Castiel glared at him.
"You are welcome Mr. Winchester"
"Yes Mary I will definitely"
Hello my friends. So I'm having very difficult time and writing this is forgetting about it a bit. And also covid 19 is starting to hit our country for the second time. Hope everyone will save. So please tell me what you think about the fic. Have a great day all 😍😍
Then Castiel smiled a teasing way. And Dean closed his eyes.
"Okay listen, I'm not going to hurt you. okay? I thought you already know that. But seems like you still don't know. Anyway, I'm not here to attack you or your kingdom. I just wanted to see you, see my beautiful Omega" Dean says very serious voice, and his face covers with emotions. His green eyes shining with hope.
Nah, it's fine. I just want to make a friendship, then I win that stupid bet, that's it, then we all going in our own ways, end of the story. He thought without letting his mind flow toward Cas. Because he knew more he thought about it, the more obvious it started to become.
Your big kudos and comments always welcome and they are make me feel better 😍😍
Coz your big kudos and Comments are making my day❤
Dean hardly pushes his heartaches and answers to Cas.
"No, no, wait, it's okay, I'm okay, we can talk, I just laying on my tub" Cas bit his tongue, as soon as those words slipped out of his lips.
"It's nice to talk to you too Azazel," He said honestly but never knew what he had walked into.
"I'm the first one who called you by that nickname" Dean slowly glancing at Cas.
"Well, you think you can walk now without spinning around you?" Castiel asked when Dean tried to stand up alone.
"Cas, look buddy, I'm so sorry, I'm a huge idiot, I didn't mean that shit. I mean I didn't mean to yell at you, I'm really sorry" Dean continued but Castiel huffed, sad, but sarcastically.
"Yeah, and Cas thank you, for staying with me and saying those things to me"
Castiel's every problem solved. His face lit by seconds. Oh god, Dean didn't done with him. He is not calling him to say bye bye. Oh god. And now Castiel can see clearly around him. No more blurry eyes and ears. No more half working brain as his anger gone now. He can sense again everything like a normal person without a range. Without being angry, jealous high school girlfriend. Finally. And then it's hit him.
Gabriel nodded at that eagerly.
Cas is melting so much as he get to know Dean, little by little.
Like a river flows
"And why'd I give you my pencil?" That's the first question Castiel asked annoyingly.
"Dean please man please just listen to us please we beg you please don't hurt us"
"yes, I promise you, Dean. We can have fun as soon as I come back home" Cas says quickly pulling in his suit and pants before it getting more late.
Suddenly Dean bits on Cas's hard clitoris and Cas screams and same time Dean pushes in three fingers making Cas lift his hips and moans.
"Damn baby look at you, all fucked up with my mouth and fingers, god you are looking like a sex goddess, all beautiful and sexy, so gorgeous baby boy" Dean growls and leans down to his pussy. His fingers keep fucking Cas's pussy when Dean starts to suck Cas's clitoris into his mouth. Dean sucks and sucks so much as Cas can't hold it anymore.
Dean really wanted to taste those sexy pinky lips right now. But he can't take him like that. Castiel is important to him. He is precious. He has to do things properly. So Dean pushed his thoughts behind and gave Castiel a heart warning smile.
"Do I mind what Cas, tell me? anything for you"
So please read my fic and tell me how is it?
Wow what's happening, is Cas hugging me right now? Dean's brain was processing and the next moment he also wrapped his hands around Castiel protectively and closed his eyes.
"Hey look who finally come back. Hey Winchester welcome back, we kinda miss you" Alastair yelled when he saw Dean coming to them.
"Yeah? Am I now?" Castiel gave him a sarcastic laugh.
They didn't talk much but eat silently. Even though Cas can still feel Dean's eyes on him all the time. Cas remembered everything that happened last night, but there were some blur memories too. Like his mom holding him, because the warmth that he felt last night was so good. But also he can remember the way Dean caught him before he falls down on the floor. So it's horrifying to know that Dean freaking Winchester took care of him through a panic attack. And didn't run away from him this time. But why? Normally Dean is not kind to him this much. Something is terribly wrong and whatever it is, still Cas has to thank him, right?
"Um, seems like he is finding a better way to say no. Coz it's just showing that he is typing but still the message is not coming," Sam said like losing his hope.
"Hey, it's not about kindness, I do it because I want to do, nothing to worry okay?" Castiel washed them and dried them before coming to sit next to Dean at the dining table.
.......
Dean still was there standing up and thinking about the new offer then suddenly he showed them the middle finger and gave a death glare. And he got into the car, flew out there with his baby's roar. He was so fucked up.
"At least tell me that you feel okay Cassie? you sure you don't want to go to the college nurse?" He asked and put his finger under Castiel's chin to lift his face. Castiel looked at Alfie and nodded.
"Dean! Did you eat whole ice cream and the cheesecake I brought yesterday evening" Mary asked very patiently.
On that day Dean waited for Sam in his office. And Dean explained everything to Sam and he was barely speaking over his laugh.
“Dean I’m so close babe. aah can't hold on anymore” Cas mewls as Dean loses it.
"Anna... God she is still not getting rid of her habits, I wonder how you guys even being cousin-best friends" Cas rolls his eyes this time.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So I started sneaking into your every social media account even though you didn't accept my requests. But anyhow I checked all of your profiles and I saw you were obsessed with ballet somehow. I guessed that you must be very interested in ballet. So yesterday night after the dinner I sneaked out and I made it's to the sports shop in the mole before it's closing. And to be honest, I got a close friend who had to know about Ballet and dancing so much, so I contacted him to get help with choosing those"
Castiel felt his heart going to blow any moment now. A few minutes earlier he was jealous of the lady who he thought these roses will receive, now that lady he thought became himself. And Dean said he brought this for his loved ones. Oh my god, this sly bastard caged me very cleverly. Now he asking me out. Oh my god. I really want a chair to sit in before my cheeky ass fainted. Dean hated his childish and fangirl side.
Dean sent it even he knew Cas will never gonna say it back. But it's okay Dean can understand his situation.
"Take care Dean"
Castiel felt an unfamiliar fear.
"Hey, Lil bro what's up, oh hey what happened to your face?" Gabriel asked giving him a suspicious look.
"Ahh De... Dean yes babe fuck my pussy, harder ahh fuck... deeper uh uh yeah just like that aaahhhh"
"Mmm don't care, baby, I want to see and suck your beautiful tits today, no more resistance told you earlier"
Cas was so nervous when he was standing in front of the Winchester house after college just like he promised Mary. Sam opened the door for him and warmly welcomed him. Mary of course hugged him and then Cas's panic slowly started to go away as he felt so relaxed when time passed by.
They were very poor in the financial situation as they couldn't able to make Mary fully recovered. Even though Dean was determined to someday he will take Mary to any kind of hospital that can recover her at any cost.
"Oh my my, is that a flirty line Cas?" Dean asked with a broad smile.
"Alfie please I don't want to talk about that now, and besides Meg will come now and she will force me to tell about that, so probably it's better waiting for her, because she get it from me anyways" Castiel answered without looking at Alfie.
Shit, what's wrong with me? Dean forgot how to breathe as he licked his lips unconsciously, still staring at Cas's lips.
"I'm sorry Gabe, didn't mean to fight you. But promise me, you will never say it even again for your entire life. because I don't want to lose any of my brothers, now leave here, no one should not know about what happened here okay?" Michael asks.
Dean slowly presses forward and Castiel claws at the sheets, shivering and shoves his head back. The burning sweet pain surrounds Cas as the pleasure comes at the same time as Dean presses more and more inch by inch slow and slow giving Cas some time to adjust, not wanting to hurt him. Even though it's not easy to take Dean's huge, flat cock because Cas is a virgin too.
"Yeah? And how about I'm asking questions and you answer for that?"
"He told you that?" Dean asked without even taking his angry and pissed eyes from Castiel.
"Whatever Bitch" Deam muttered under his breath opening his baby's door.
"Did you said that or not Castiel?"
Castiel just looked down and nodded. He was tired of talking about that.
"No, no, actually I'm not completely naked, I'm in my boxers," Dean said and chuckled a bit.
Dean: so, you, ahem really mean that?
"Hmm will see," Castiel said and snorted when Dean glared at him.
"Fine, so in your opinion what's wrong with them," Grath asked.
"You know, don't ever think you are a badass, did you hear me Novek, just know that you are only a fucking nerd that's it" He let go the shirt and glare at him. Then step up to join his rest of the team who were cheering as Dean is some kind of hero.
// Hello Dean, I'm so sorry for the late reply. I just didn't check my phone//
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas sure that Dean must be huge, assuming his body. Dean is a well-built man. Definitely, he must go to the gym. His broad shoulders, his firm and big strong arms are the evidence for that. So no wonder about the other parts of his body. That thought made Cas shiver with excitement. Cas slowly insert his middle finger into his entrance without wanting to go searching for some loob right now. He closed his eyes because then he can see Dean's soft smile, his beautiful green eyes change and filled with arousal before Dean's hands spread his plump ass cheeks. Cas's mind forced to think that this is Dean's thick finger is right now pumping in and out of his hole, as Cas slowly moaned, licking his lips unconsciously. With that, suddenly his phone started to ring and he forgot to breathe for a moment. Quickly he cleaned his hand and grabbed his phone.
But then Sam messaged him again saying that Mary and Dean are not home tonight. And suddenly that's got Cas's attention as he texted back asking he sure that Dean will not be at home. Sam's answer was "yes, Dean is going to his girlfriend's home, so we can do all the crazy stuff which best friend's do on a sleepover"
"Oh Dean, I'm so sorry, I didn't see you" He slowly said.
*Suddenly there is a bright and shining Green light and Prince Demon Dean started to change to a Handsome Human Boy.
Dean : Glared
"Deaannn?" Castiel asked but his voice came out very small.
"I mean I have to agree with you sometimes because when he came that day to visit me he was acting like afraid of something. I mean when I asked about his parents he obviously got shocked, but I don't know why, also he promised me that he will come back soon, and yeah he never came back yet"
Cas and Dean confessed to Cas about his Love. They are a couple now. A lovely couple. Sam can't stop grinning, and his smirks, he still murmurs like "I knew it" And smile like a idiot. Of course he got tears when he heard they are together he gave a bone crush hug for both of Dean and Cas. Saying finally they got what they deserved. And threatens to Dean not to hurt Cas making Cas blushing and hug Sam again.
"You always ruined, and I'm used to it" Cas's voice was so small. Dean's eyes caught Cas's eyes in seconds. They are still a bit shocked and Dean knew it's his fault wanted to apologize more but then Sam came again with two Cokes.
"But Cas you gave me two kisses and I only gave you one, I guess I should give you another kiss," Dean said because that made his little heart a bit upset.
Before he pulled out they heard baby monitor getting live and Little Aaron's hissing sound.
Dean pulled Cas into his arms and kissed him. so lovingly. both of them waited for this mostly like 10 years, so they Kissed, they Kissed like they got their heaven.
"Tell me about that Winchester. I can't even imagine what you were planning to do, to get your revenge on me, because that's what you definitely going to do" Castiel prompted.
Gabriel takes a minute to study Michael's face before answering him.
Gabriel starts looking into Castiel's eyes.
" What are you doing here Dean, I can hardly guess you are looking for a book for your assignment, am I correct?" He asked smirking again.
"Yes, and I'm so sorry for everything" Finally he answered.
Okay, here we go. This is it, this is why Cas never believe in his luck and Dean's silence. Both ends with a disaster. But Cas felt a wave of anger as he burst out.
"Thank you, Mary. I will finish my story quickly. So then we lived in our house which you have already seen that day when you visit me. So As you see right now I'm so afraid to be social. I always having panic attacks, and Gabriel worried about me because of that. He told me to stay away from the things that make me upset or scared. I always tried to be like that but ended up with anyhow getting attacked or getting a panic" Castiel stopped a bit and wiped his tear face before taking a long sip.
"Cassie you should tell me what's going on with you, you know we don't keep secrets, right? I can obviously feel the shake of your voice and it's not normal. tell me right now, what's going on?" Gabriel demanded as Castiel got no other option but to tell him what was happened.
Castiel went to his room and when Dean entered inside Castiel slowly release his hand and close the door.
"I'm fine Sam, but Mary, please tell me what did I do? What's happened, please, please tell me?" Cas begged again as he was almost stopped on the road.
Cas didn't expect to face Winchester right now. he thought it's Alfie causing him to stop in his heels and turned around with a smile.
Finally, Castiel asked when they are face to face and finally seeing each other.
"It's nothing," Cas said quickly gathering his plate before standing up.
Dean askes running his thumb over Cas's pussy hole now. Cas gasps at the touch.
Dean probed around the cafeteria very carefully like a hawk who is looking for prey. He wanted to close the deal. This is too much because he is done with the bullshit of Azazel and Alastair. After all, he is The Dean Winchester so he is not gonna buy those asshole's shit anymore. But the team wasn't anywhere to find then suddenly his eyes stopped on someone else. Dean gritted his teeth when he saw them and stormed into the two boys who were chatting with few more boys.
"I really doubt that Dean, I don't want to make people uncomfortable like my brother," Castiel said and Gabriel rolled his eyes.
So that's the day they become friends. Castiel still does not believe Dean much, but however, they are not strangers anymore.
"Cas, read it," Dean said passing that note again to him. And this time Castiel rolled his eyes and took it. He unfold it slowly frowning at it.
Dean shrugged.
As per Dean's football practice timetable, he got an early morning practicing today. So he was determined to go today to the practice without even a one-second delay. He felt proud of himself as he thought Alastair and the gang should be thinking he will get the bait again. But he was already one step ahead of them. Because he paid another two football players for giving Dean all the practice-changing details when the team planing for ditching him. So he won't miss practice again. He smirked and got on to his baby to go to college. He played the eye of the tiger and sang along with it. He wanted to forget a things behind. He drew slowly because he loved the early morning wind. The road is not more crowded yet and vehicles are also not much there yet. that's why Dean noticed him. He saw a runner coming in front of him.
Dean was happily trailed his eyes on Castiel's left nipple. Shit, he couldn't able to see it properly as Castiel covered it, shit Dean was worried about that and then he heard Castiel's yell.
Dean said with a very sad and afraid tone because he knew his best friend is in pain, he didn't want Cas to be in pain. He tried to pull Castiel's hand to see his face, then Cas slowly took off his hands and Dean was shocked and was about to cry when he saw Castiel's face.
"Aggh, what are you think you doing demon? Just leave me. And how did you even do that?" Dean chuckles because of Cas's panic voice.
"Thank you, thank you very much, Doctor"
"Dean what's going on with you, that's the fourth time I caught you smirking for nothing, are you day dreaming about something?" Sam asked checking Dean's face.
"You know, I kinda missed your flirting Dean, it's happy to see you all flirty again" Castiel huffed a laugh looking at his face. Dean chuckled at him.
“Shit babe, are you horny already? you know how much I love when it you wear those panties” Cas jump out to the sound and he grabs the bedsheet tightly and tries to go back on the bed for defense from Dean.
Dean came back to present as he heard Castiel.
That's the only thing Castiel said.
“Mmmmm babe, that's hella blow job, what a skilled and filthy mouth.” Dean teases when they part away for the air.
"Thank you, thank you for everything you did for me, for Gabe. It means a lot to me" Castiel said holding back tears because he didn't want to cry again.
"But I'm not gonna drag it right now because of Castiel. I don't wanna upset him again. but you! Mr. Dean Ross Winchester, you and I have to do a very serious talk very soon" Mary said in a very serious tone and Dean gulped, his pie filled fork was stopped by few inches away from his mouth.
"Ah-ha now I can get it" Castiel shook his head.
"Okay... What do you want to say? Say it quickly because I have to go. And first of all leave my hand Winchester" Castiel groaned trying to pull his hand from Dean's tight grip again, but failed. Dean was staring at Castiel for the whole time, but never let go of his hand. Dean's gaze trailed onto Castiel's plump pink lips before he licked his lips unconsciously.
"Look at me little stupid boy, you will never see that boy or the school again. You know, you are also grounded for a year, because you acted very badly and make me so embarrassed. You destroyed my pride and my name. John Winchester's son never be a faggot, no, never, I will never let you down me again understand you little rat" John yelled at Dean.
Please don't forget to tell me your thoughts.
Castiel made sure his hand is not bleeding anymore and not visible to his friends.
.....
"Shutup man, how you even talk about this like that, about THIS?" Dean cut of him and his voice was filled with awe.
"I can't resist you anymore"
"Castiel please talk to us, what's happening" that's Sam.
And that day Dean and Sam also had a conversation which Castiel didn't know about.
"Hmm yes you are my mean lovely beautiful Angel"
Dean froze for a moment. He had to wait for a minute to gather his thoughts before the answer to Azazel. He gulped and turned toward Azazel collecting his books and put them inside his bag.
"Yes Dean, at least give us chance to tell you what happened please Dean, that wasn't our fault, they, they didn't let us chance to,"
Holy Mother of God, why is this kid can't leave him alone. A whimper left from his mouth without even knowing.
Dean just glared at the team didn't say anything as he was Just looking at them.
"Oh my sweet little hunny bee, didn't papa feed you as your time table? Ohh I'm so sorry my Twitty pie" Castiel soothes and picks up his baby and hold to his chest.
But obviously, Castiel only got more blush making him pink.
Castiel cleared his throat. This man is so stubborn.
"Yeah I agree on that dude, those kids are a definitely bad influence to Dean," Grath said making Dean smirked and others to laugh.
"Oh, Sam?" Castiel said and Dean turned to the side wondering what Sam was doing in the car park as he knew he was in the office right now.
"Hey sad Cas, care to share why's the upset face?" Dean asked again checking his face.
"Coming, I didn't lock it" The happy voice came and Dean didn't thought twice and opened the door and walked inside.
"Of course Dean, I do come definitely. You are my friend, now please, please let's go to the hospital" Castiel begged, cupping Dean's face again.
"Yeah, and those your words are the clue triggered my memory even this much. Otherwise, I would never remember it"
"Oh, c'mon man you are talking like you are 75? Don't say crazy stuff like that, you can't be more than 20 or something like that" He added.
Dean touched his cheek after getting into his car. What a lucky cheek. He thought bringing his fingers into his nose and closed his eyes as he tries to catch Castiel's smell. And then brought those fingers to his own lips to kiss it. Dean smiled at his own girly work.
Dean pulled out of the kiss slowly and pressed a peck on Castiel's wet lips.
Dean felt his orgasm started t to bubble up as he quickly lifted Cas and flipped them as Cas laying on his back. Cas gasped when the Cock slipped out from his ass as he reached to put it back but Dean patted his hand and smirked at him. Then Dean grabbed Cas's legs and spread them. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to the used hole which clenching around nothing. Cas gasped with the wet touch and started to flutter with the feeling.
"Fucking hell so hot Cas, so damn hot" He groans and he can feel his climax is so close and his knot starts to catch Cas's hole. It takes about a few fast, hard, and long full ,thrusts and Dean's cock jerks and throbs. next second his hot cum spills into Cas as warm pleasure rushes through him.
"Oh Dean thank you, thank you very much, you are a great man, a great friend. I don't know how to thank you Dean" Castiel said pressing his lips tightly over Dean's shoulder. Dean was holding him to his chest tightly. Dean's hand repeatedly stroking Castiel's hair in a soothing manner.
The next whole day is crazy. First, his breakfast is served to his chamber as he ordered. Normally he does that when he has no mood to have breakfast with his family. But today is a bit different. But kinda nice different though. There is a big beautiful red rose on his plate. It smells very nice and Cas really glad to have it. He enjoyed his food peacefully as the aroma of the flower already filled the air nicely.
"But I was waiting for him because that's all what I have left to do, so I waited and waited for my brother to come back for me" Castiel stopped and looked at Mary and hold her hand tightly before starting again.
"Um hey, Cas.. Castiel, um Nah I can't. sorry my gang is huge and we gonna need more chairs and space. also we have to do this private talk, so um guess we got to go to our own place" He said like a robot, no emotions in his face and just walked away. Pretending that he never saw the way Castiel's beautiful smile vanishing through his innocent face. The way his face darkened with sadness and the way he nodded at him with sad eyes.
"Well, I don't know. Just asking, you know. Because it's Valentine's Day and you are pathetically single. Oh, by the way, I was just curious about what happened to Mr.Winchester? I mean the other one, not our boss. I didn't see him around for days now? What happened? Did he finally understand that you are not worth it? And how pathetic you are?" Lisa's unexpected bitter words shocked him. Castiel knew Lisa was always jealous of him for whatever reason, as he gave her a calm look.
"Now Dean accepted the bet. So if he wins he is proving he is not a Gay, and of course his name goes to the list and he will play the big match coming.
Your big kudos and comments are so welcome and I'm hopefully looking forward it❤❤ have a great day😇
"Actually I'm feeling better Sweetheart, all thanks to you, normally it's not ending this much soon. It normally stays for a whole day, but somehow because of you, it's getting controlled quickly" He said like a little kid.
"Wow, Mom that's a brilliant idea, But I can't guess what you gonna do"
Cas sighs again and his fingers slowly sneak into his pussy lips, only touching the outside and he licks his lips unconsciously. And then he touches his clit and like a lightning bolt, he sees the handsome face of the Demon Alpha prince and Cas starlets gasping loudly. He withdraws his fingers from his pussy as he recalls what happened just now. This is not the first time he touches himself like this. But he never experiences something like that, he never saw any Alpha in his mind when he is masturbating. And why now? Why Dean? God, he is my enemy after all. The biggest, cruel, animalistic, barbarian enemy. They are disgusting. So why my mind shows his face right now. Obviously, that must be my stupid Omega's decision. Cas groans at his Omega's ridiculous desires. And then it's happening again, it's starting to feel like someone is looking at him. But it's a crazy idea because there is no one in his chamber. All are gone out as he tries to relax again. he let his head fall to the edge of the tub closing his eyes.

However I do not support the looting of private and local businesses. Fuck Target, Walmart, Kmart etc but if you are protesting leave local businesses alone as those are people's livelihoods. I also do not support whoever the fuck ran over a police officer, killing or trying to kill police officers will not do anything but make it worse and more lives will be lost. I am in no manner an expert on the subject but killing people will just lead to more killing. Fuck Donald Trump, fuck police brutality and fuck racists. All lives will matter when black lives matter.

NEEEEEEEEEEEEEXT
we couldn’t think of individual ones so we gave you all the same one because it’s perfect
"Mr. Winchester, Mr. Winchester" Dean glanced at her then went to her giving her a smile.
Like that it's confirmed and Dean mentality fist bumped to the air. Finally, one of his plans is started to working and now he can have a decent talk with Cas while making sure their misunderstandings will be gone after that. Also, his weird feelings towards Cas will disappear after that for sure.
"Yeah of course you do, you have your pathetic excuse to cover your sad dumb ass. Cassie, look I'm worrying about you okay? I know you like Dean, but I don't know why you keep pushing him away, I mean give the man a chance" Castiel tried to say something but Gabriel held his hand sign to wait.
Then I did that exact same mistake by asking it again, from the last person I dated, it's like a few years back. And his answer was miserable. He called me psycho, and he said I'm a shame for gay people, then broken up with me. Then I understand lots of people hate to ballerinos and especially all people around me were hating that so much" Castiel said looking at Dean.
"It's totally fine Sam, don't worry, I'm totally fine" Cas barely speak through his laugh as both Mary and Sam felt relief. But the next moment all of them started to laugh and Cas explain how it happened and how he fell and how funny was that. Cas had never felt like this before, to laugh freely like this, so he feels it as much as he wanted.
Castiel just looked between his face and his hand and blinked. Then he held his hand and shook it and hurried to get his hand back nodding at him. He didn't like to talk with strangers but this is college, people do talk, making friends. So Castiel decided to answer the boy.
"Freaking Anna, Gabe please stop talking, you all are so annoying" Cas groans. Gabriel bursts out laughing and Cas glares at him.
"Oh speaking of which, stop the Car" Castiel was so angry now. He knew what Dean going to do tomorrow. But he is not gonna shut his mouth tomorrow. He is done with Dean's all shits. This is his life and he has to protect himself. So he burst out.
“Cas, Look I’m not a psycho, okay? I can’t go to a psychiatrist, never. You know what, iI think maybe it’s just happened because of my stress at Work, and you know actually I’m totally fed up with the office, the new Management is too tight Cas, it sucks. It’s full of tension and pressure. I think my everyday anxiety has crossed the line, that’s what I’m thinking. And that douchebag Balthazar knows nothing Cas, he always trying to get to you, so… ” Dean keeps talking but Cas cut him off.
Cas turns redder as he mewls into Dean's dirty words. Dean fucks and fucks Cas's beautiful but now well-used and redded tits as he feels his orgasm keep rising again. Cas's pussy keeps leaking with juice as the whole room fills with the sweet smell of his slick. Dean's mouth-watering and he stops fucking. He eagerly kisses Cas's waiting lips then slowly lets go of Cas's lips and presses his sweaty forehead against Castiel’s. Both are still closing their eyes.
"Oh god, yes Dean, yes there, there.. Oh god oh godddd,, please harder oh my god" Cas mewls and whines licking his lips unconsciously.
"Okay this is it, but you know I still didn't want you to think that I'm an asshole okay? I'm not gonna make you uncomfortable in any way, so you don't need to think much about this" Dean said while holding the bag toward Castiel, with both hands.
"Hey, don't worry Sweetheart, it's just me. And I kinda feel so lucky to see you in your pajamas. and you are so, so much cute in those" Dean said patting on the couch next to him. Signing Castiel to sit with him. Cas can't go redder as he blushed furiously when he sitting next to Dean.
.....
"Oh Dean is never changed then. He always worried about me, we were used to be best friends" He said in a happy voice.
"You wanna go back to that horrible, dark pet shop again little puppy? No? Yes I know I know puppy. what to do, your happened to be papa is going to reject you" Dean blinked twice dramatically.
..........
Then Castiel gave the phone back to Dean and he listened to Dean say a few words before ending the call.
There was Lisa, chatting with her elegant friends, all shining and glistening. Dean smirked and started walking towards them. And he waited until there were few steps between him and Cas.
"Will you believe if I tell you that I wanted to kiss you the second I saw you. When you taking my eggnog from me?" Castiel asked and his voice was hoarse.
"So what? We asked you about ice cream and cake jerk" Sam interrupted.
He woke up a bit early the next day and prepared what he wanted. And the end of the baking mission he was satisfied. He was so impatient until evening that day as he drove a bit early to Sam's office. Almost in the afternoon. Dean had beautifully packed his surprise and carried it in a sweet little two bags. He checked himself in the mirror and got off the car then walked towards the building.
His only relief was he got new friends and Mary and Sam were very kind to him, made him happy. But it ended becoming a nightmare as Dean was her elder son. Why my destiny always joking with me? why is God always made me ended up in front of Dean. Why God why? Castiel questioned today as usual before he falling asleep. But he didn't cry today. That was the only difference. But he was cried a lot earlier. Maybe that's why he didn't cry right now or maybe he got a bit stronger knowing that Mary is promised to be with him for everything and anything. Maybe it's a good thing after all. He got another person who really cares about him, besides Gabriel. He closed his eyes as dreams takeover him slowly.
So Castiel finally decided to tell one of his secret to Mary. Because he didn't want to lose her. And it's a bit dark secret.
"Okay, okay, so tell me all about it, don't miss any juicy detail of it"
Azazel's eyes were shining with the hope he was in his winning moment. He knew Dean is going to get the bait and here we go.
"Dean I can feel it"
"You all are so fucking crazy," Dean said again with a very angry voice. And he saw the way, Alfie, leaning into Cas by side and murmured something into his ear.
"You know what Winchester, according to you, all other kids in the college are either nerds or useless losers, except your friends. So I'm not wondering about what you said about Alfie right now because according to you I'm the hugest nerd in the college, but the problem is what do you want from me? What are you even doing here? Talking to a nerd on the way?" Cas busted out.
Poor Cas was a minute before having a heart attack. What the hell Dean thinking he is doing. He rested almost his leg on Cas's, he was sitting next to Cas like their bodies are attached. And the way his hand goes down. Shit, it's like, it's like he is meant something else. Something Cas never wanted to think about. But why is Dean doing these things?
Castiel groaned when Dean found that is too cute and almost snorted, but he didn't want to make him more upset or angry so he shut his lips to a thin line as hold his laughter.
"Here, now it's ok," Castiel said and Dean quickly licked the spoon and moaned closing his eyes.
So when Sam came to the kitchen he just saw both Dean and Castiel was fighting with all colored icing and they were covered with icing.
"You like that love? You like when my huge fat knot caught up inside your tight, little pussy so good, and I fucked your sloppy hole repeatedly until I release my seeds inside your well fucked hole? Making that tiny hole gaped and pretty open for me to take again. Buried inside you deep and full, and then fuck you again senseless, until I make sure you've been filled with my hot cum, and then knot you nicely? and pretty sure you will walk funny the next day, You love that babe?"
"You ready for my fat cock baby?"
"Oh, my baby... Dean...you came sweetie?"
"Hey, Deano after a long time man, what's up," Gabe said and Dean rolled his eyes at him but hugged him warmly.
"Because that's the nickname I gave you" Dean started not looking at Cas.
So Cas, Happy Six Months Anniversary Darling. Thank you for coming to my life even as a friend (just only now)
"Oh now who told you that I'm your boyfriend huh?" Castiel teased and Dean pouted.
Cas nodded again.
"Jesus Christ, Dean" He babbled thinking about how to talk with him after what he has just done. He felt a huge guilty feeling also he blushed so much thinking about how it felt so a good few seconds ago. He took a deep breath and finally he answered the call with hesitation.
"Yeah, you always are" With that Castiel tried to gather his books quickly, to leave here but before that, a warm and strong hand grabbed his wrist. Castiel glanced over his hand even he knew who's hand it was. Yeah, it's Dean's.
After few moments a freshly brewed coffee filled the house and Cas really hope if he was in his home. Then he would have a hot coffee right now. He signed looking at the movie again.
“Good morning, Kansas central Hospital, how can I help you” Deans got some kind of shock. Why the hell he got ten missed calls from the hospital. He thought for a second what he must ask next.
"Woah Cassie didn't mean to scare you,"  Alfie said in an apologetic tone. Cas gave him a pointed look exhaling breath heavily.
Dean doesn't remember how he got into the forests. His Alpha keeps wailing and cries out in pain. Of course not the physical pain but because of inner pain. Dean has no idea what's going on with his Alpha because it never acted like this before.
"Wow, really? It's amazing Cas. Just wow it's really nice thing to see, I'm happy to see this right now, and happy to know that you really planted them" Dean said very happily looking at Cas."of course of  I definitely going to plant them Dean" Cas smiled back.
Have a great day 👍
Cas starts to lick and suck Dean's monster cock when Dean starts to moan and buckle his hips towards Cas's mouth.
"Oh no, no, no I'm not gonna crash into your celebration, and Gabriel, you are not going to stuck with me here and you definitely should go to Sam's place. Please, please please Gabriel I beg you. I really need to be alone. Christmas or not it's not important to me, it's just another day to me. I just need to sleep you know. I'm tired after all" Castiel hissed annoyingly.
"Clarence shut up, you are never a trouble to us, we love to have you here, and please don't worry about it and just come okay, I'm so happy finally you come over and we all can sit and eat together, thank you for accepting the invite Son" Mary's voice was mixed of, love, sad, excited and happy.
"Aww sweetie, that's so sweet of you, I'm sure Cas would be fine with that then," Mary said as Sam also nodded at that.
"Yes Mom, he is fine and we are 5 minutes away from his house" Dean answered looking at Castiel.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Auch, what? Isn't it the truth?" Benny yelped.
"Oh and I don't let you go now alone, either you should stay tonight here or I'm gonna take you home in my car, no argument though"
"C'mon buddy, don't be like that" Dean huffed after few seconds.
"Mom, tell me how you feel now?, how did this happen?, who the fuck did this to you mom?, I'm gonna kill that bastard" Dean gritted his teeth as he remembered the bastard whoever hit Mary with their vehicle.
"Mmm, will see" Castiel said also laugh with him.
Now Castiel completely stopped pacing instead he completely concentrate on Dean's voice.
"Ahem, dude actually I have one question about this golden tea, Where did you buy it? " Sam asked finally putting his second empty cup on the table.
Castiel just pulled from the hug only to look at Dean's face.
"Obviously vegan people Jerk, and of course don't forget that you have already drank two of them. now go before you become a popsicle out there" With that Sam closed the door firmly.
"What? Who doesn't like Pie? What kind of person doesn't like pie" Dean started to argue and Mary's anger went high.
"Oh my god Dean I can't believe how you read me like that, I mean it's impossible. And didn't you thought that I'm a weird shit who obsessed with ballet, you know normally people don't like male ballerinas"
"Oh my god Son, yes your brother is a hero, no wonder you are his little brother. I'm so glad he save you, son. He is a really a great kid too, I'm really glad you both are fine, thank god" Mary sighed and pressed a kiss to Castiel's temple.
"Dean, finally. I searched for you everywhere hey you wanna join with me?" Castiel asked showing his empty table.
"Aww, you know about me more now? Aren't you baby?"
"Sam, tell him that he is not a friend of mine anymore," Mary said but Sam gave her a face like please don't make him upset.
"I Love You Dean"
"Dean... It's not a joke, you know what I mean"
Hell, in one day he accepted the most ridiculous and dangerous bet he got in his life. Then he felt some strange feeling towards his greatest enemy even he had to seduce him within few months. And should take his virginity. Wow, what a plan, and the said guy had to happen the savior of his mom's life. What a coincidence. Dean closed his eyes tightly as he felt his head is going to blow up any moment now.
"Hey sugar plum, how's the day?" Cas asks holding his face with both hands.
Castiel really got surprised about Dean's clear attitude. Such a blessed soul and beautiful mind.
"I said I will see you tomorrow"
"Actually, um I don't know how to ask this or what to ask Charlie," Dean said before running his hands through his hair. It's Saturday morning and he was still on his yesterday clothes. He was a mess.
.....
Castiel gulped, okay it's too much to get right now, he always being awkward when it's coming to the compliments.
"See, this is your problem, Winchester. You always think that I'm your personal toy, so that you can play
"Stop your drama. All of these stories are just huge lies. But you can't make me a fool, you demon. There is no such thing like true mates" Cas grunts.
"Hey handsome, finally remember me?" Lisa said in a sexy way and Dean laughed at that. Dean didn't waste a second before wrap his hand around Lisa's tiny waist and Lisa gasped dramatically leaning towards Dean.
"It's okay Castiel, you don't need to tell everything, just tell me what only you are comfortable with. Okay ?" Mary asked in a soothing tone. And Castiel seems to gather himself as he nodded at her.
Dean didn't saw Charlie until he heard her voice.
......
Castiel gave him a nice smile before opens the bag and leaning into it. Then Castiel's face lit up, and his lips curled into a huge smile.
"How may I help you with the eggnogs? Castiel asked.
"Ellen, what? What's it? Why are you terrified?"
Castiel getting his decision at last😍😍
"So then I should go now Cas, wish I could stay a bit more with you, hmm see you soon Sweetheart"
"C'mon man I didn't, okay?"
"You know you are the first human who did something to encourage me toward my old, buried passion besides my brother. And Dean I want you to know that I'm so thankful for that. You are a very nice person too Dean, Thank you, Thank you very much for everything" Castiel said and Dean can see his eyes were wet again.
“I’m so sorry babe, I have hurt you, but it will never happen again, I promise you Cas.”
"Shit, Cas, Cas I'm sorry. It's came out wrongly. Cass, please wait...I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Cass" Dean called out but Cas never stopped or turn back. Dean just stared after him until the bell rang off.
Castiel started his day promising himself that he wouldn't act like a child or lovesick teenager but screwing his plan Donna drop the first bomb as she goes.
"Oh, you think so Dean?" Castiel asked like he is not sure.
"Huh, shut up. And how dare you to put your foot into my kingdom? hell, and break into my chambers? How even you do that through my security? What kind of person you are?" Cas groans and squirms to getting rid of Dean but it turns out Dean groans and closing his eyes.
"No, Gabe I want to be here a little bit more, alone. Then I will tell you that secret"
"Jesus Christ, Cas I'm so sorry, I was just kidding with you, and I'm so sorry I know you want to kill me right now, I swear I didn't mean anything I said just want to see your adorable blushing. I'm sorry Cas. And man I'm an idiot, that's not the best first impression right?"
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Dean smiled at him.
Alfie chuckled glancing at his friend's face.
Mary chuckled a little bit.
Dean can't get off his eyes from Castiel as he saw Castiel's face filled with fear by Azazel's shouting. Probably he just thinking that the bullies will hit him again, Dean thought and it killed him inside. Castiel's eyes not blue like other days, his pink lips are pale and no more pink there, it's eating Dean's eye, he felt like he wants to go in front of Castiel and grab him, kissing his pale lips until it's swollen and filled with blood then it would be red pink again, those lips deserve to be glorious. Those should not be pale that's a shame. They were perfect before. what happened to the kid? he looks like shit by the way. Shut the fuck up Dean you are so fucked up.
"Of course not, it's Harry, you bitch" Dean shooted back, and Sam rolled his eyes this time.
"Dude, don't you hear what Mrs. Pamela said to that nerd. Besides I need these marks, so don't wanna get into any troubles" He said before yanking his hand and walking towards Castiel's desk without any delay.
"Noooooooooo" Dean cried throwing his head back. Then he pouted at Castiel.
"Dean I'm pregnant, I'm having your pup, your baby," Cas says almost crying.
“Fuck Angel” he slams to Cas hardly and shoots his hot and thick, long cum ropes deep inside Cas calling out his lover’s name. Dean roads slowly his aftershocks until he makes sure to put his last cum drop inside of his lover.
Dean said still not turning, giving his back to Cas. It's like he knows how much Cas would be uncomfortable if he turned around.
Cas stays still for a minute then glances at the clock, it's 4 AM. Cas’s face lighting with a beautiful smile. Its already a new day, Dean was right, nothing happened, the three days are over. Cas smiles again and pushes his ass to Dean’s hard erection, and starts to rub over the cock. Dean is also pushing his hips to Cas’s ass.
Dean chuckled softly before stepped towards the main door to greet Castiel.
"For yesterday incident Cas. I thought you were angry with me. I shouldn't have brought that teddy bear to your office premises" Dean said quietly.
Dean didn't want to face them right now as he stood up and walked away from them. But before that, he felt a hand on his shoulder.
So, Cas hit Dean's face with another strong punch. As this time it breaks Dean's nose. And it starts to bleeding in the next second. But Dean doesn't care about that as he wipes the blood without even a hiss.
"Cas, c'mon eat up" Cas felt a bit nervous because Dean is still lean into him more than necessary when he took pizza slices. But he didn't try to talk with him again and no unnecessary glances like before. They ate and watched the movie silently except for Dean's yelling and cursing when it comes to Voldemort's scenes. Sometimes Cas wanted to laugh at them but he kept himself from doing that and remembered where was he right now.
Those words did things to Dean and he knew Cas was the one. Besides his Mother and Brother, no one had concerned like this about him.
Castiel also looked at him.
Then Mary understood it. He looked at Sam and Dean and gesture them to go upstairs. They nodded at her before quickly ran to their rooms.
"Oh god, oh my god Dean you are so massive and huge, ohhgg so big" Cas murmurs.
"Do you understand that you are embarrassing me in front of my friend here?" He asked slowly but he was pissed at Gabriel.
"Talking about the gay devils, I saw our nerd cocksucker today in the library" Azazel started barely looking at Dean.
They even didn't notice the two girls who came near to them until they spoke to them.
Sam started to choose Dean's clothes quickly.
Dean leans to see the way their baby drinking milk from Castiel. Dean always love to see that beautiful scene when his beloved Husband Castiel, Nursing their newborn baby. Dean smiles at the sleepy baby.
Dean grabs Cas's hands and take off them from his beautiful tits. And then put his hand on those tits with a loud moan.
"I just wanted to hear your voice but instead you chose to come to me, and I know your presence always healing me, but I don't know how? it's the reality" Dean said in a weak voice. Castiel couldn't say anything but staring at Dean with teary eyes.
Dean said with an angry voice.
Cas also feels the same but didn't says much because he is too busy with, held himself from moving and take the whole cock.
"What are you laughing at?" Hr asked as Sam looked at him.
"Accept the truth?" Cas laughs louder this time
"Um, we were cleaning the table and accidentally I slipped and this gravy bowl spilled on me, then Mary said to get a shower because I was stinking so much, but when I was going to Sam's bathroom when he screamed and told me it was broken. Then he asked me to come here, but believe me, I didn't want to, I really didn't want to, please don't be angry, I'm so sorry, Sam said you are at your friend's house, that's why finally I agreed to use your bathroom. But please don't angry with Sam. He was just helping me, fault is mine, please don't scold him" Cas was a babbling mess as Dean staring at him without blinking.
"Come Castiel, my clothes will be definitely huge for you but I'm sure I can find some old t-shirt and pants from my brother's wardrobe, come with me," Sam said before took the lead to the upstairs. Castiel nodded at him. but remembered about the pie.
"Both are big nerds," Dean said chuckling again but Mary gave him a pointed look.
"Jeez man, thank you. You know Cas, you and your brother are completely different. I only had to bring him a few donuts and candy then he approved me, wow. But you.... On the other hand, hell, it took months to even be a friend of yours" Dean complained opening his own breakfast bag, and this time Castiel chuckled.
"Drive safe Sweetheart, please message me when you go home" Dean whispered as Castiel smiled shyly.
"What kind of fucking fun you taking from the library Azazel?" Dean asked his heartbeat is raised slowly.
but, but I didn’t care about it. And I came here and checked you, you were sleeping, but oh god I didn’t saw your face clearly. so I thought you are sleeping Cas. then I came back to the kitchen to make us some breakfast. babe believes me. I didn’t hurt you.” Dean implores and he trying to remember what happened last night. but suddenly his face fills with fear.
So hope you will enjoy it. And sorry for the mistakes 😍
Okay, how about that Lisa girl. it was the last period and after the agreed to the bet and Bobby's lecture Dean's mind was not stable. He really really gone for it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah got it, what else?" Sam asked grabbing milk cartons.
most of the time he ignored the happy yellings and excited phone calls he heard around his cabin from his co-workers for the whole day. Wow, it seems like they all are too much into this stupid lover's day. Whatever. He mumbled and kept his head down as he got back to the documents he was working with.
Castiel felt relief when he heard her reply.
"Muah" Suddenly Castiel pressed a kiss on Dean's cheek and quickly go inside the car and close the door.
Sam and Cas shared few more messages and finally, Cas agreed to come over as Sam jumped with happiness.
"Sweetie I told you that it is fine. Okay? Now tell me where is Sammy" Mary asked a questioning look with her face.
"Sarcastic" Dean answered looking at him again.
"Wow Cas you are amazing you know, oh wait a minute there's another one, oh Cas really? You brought me another gift?" Dean yelled and laughed getting out the Big book of Harry Potter the first part.
Dean smirks before settles between his legs and leans into Cas's delicious smelling pussy, it smells so sweet and the most mouthwatering scent Dean ever has. Dean's tip of the nose touches the wet patch of Cas's panties when Cas shivers
"God Dean you are an asshole," Sam said but laughed before the doorbell rang off.
Dean couldn’t hide his laugh anymore, but he kept trying.
Within that Cas find himself get into the ambulance and ambulance hit the road and flying to the hospital.
Castiel glared at him for a second before tugging his hand again to failed again.
"You know Dean, but lots of people don't think like that and they are hate ballerinos" Castiel started.
"Okay that's good, yes of course he will be okay soon" Dean answered giving him a reassuring smile.
"So now everything is clear and I want you kids to eat soon as possible, especially you Castiel, no arguments" Mary warned glaring at Castiel jokingly.
"Go away bitch" Dean shrugged his hand and glanced over Castiel. Castiel can swear he saw a line of blush over his cheeks. Is Dean Winchester getting blush now? Hell, what's going on with my life lately.
"Wait, is that mean? Oh, it's made Deano the eggnog thief?" Gabe said but it's mostly a question way.
Cas smiles at Dean so lovingly and they curled again under the covers. Dean holds Cas tightly from the back but makes sure to not press to him unnecessarily.
with me anytime you want. To bullied me, to insult me as much as you want. Isn't it? But remember, I do not belong to anyone. You are a sick bastard, just don't even think about a friendship, and don't ever talk to me again" Cas cried painfully before ran away from him.
"Um, actually I can't understand one thing Cas, that what happened last night? Why suddenly you got that panic attack? I mean nothing happened at that time, it's only started a heavy rain, that's it. So what happened?" Dean said shrugging.
"Now tell me, when you sneak into my kingdom? And Don't you remember that I have sworn that I will not be very generous like you if I ever see you again? are you this much dumb for even think to do something like that?" Cas asks sarcastic way and Dean shrugged.
She said wiping her tears and tried to smile.
"Yeah, yeah whatever, okay you can use it. But make sure you clean it before you leave it. Bitch" Dean said annoyingly before leaving his room.
"So, you mean this Dean guy is up to something and he is not genuine about you? All these "eight months" Are those things just an act? Is that what you tell me to believe?" Gabriel air quotes the eight months because he was a bit mad at his brother.
Oh, that's her plan, she's playing an angry mom role.
Actually, Dean didn't thought, Dean knew Castiel will like it, hell Dean knew Castiel will love it, but he didn't admit it or didn't gonna show his confidence about it, because then Dean has to answer questions about how he knows about it, about Castiel's favorite stuff. Dean didn't want to tell him about all those kinds of stuff yet. So he just gave him a light answer.
Dean laughed and finally let him go.
Suddenly Uriel's face got serious.
"Fuck" He cursed and laid his head on the steering wheel.
So hope you all are safe and good
On other hand Sam. Poor Sam got to know about his brother is trying to date his Executives Assistant and he goes meek about that. Whatever reason he was never talking about that with Castiel to his relief.
"Okay, okay Gabe, I will make it quick, but you know I don't want to put Sam in trouble. it's hard to find vegan eggnogs and it's my responsibility to bring what I want when it's come to rare than the normal tradition," He said before going out of the car and ran towards the shop.
Castiel shook his head to not show to his excitement and made a face.
"Oh, I forget about it. Huh, right, right, This is all about him, isn't it?" Dean said laughing but Sam is sure he was so pissed.
"You little fucker, I didn't stalk anyone no one in this college, I never fucking do that, and I'm not staring at him, yes I saw him there, and I, I was just thinking when I see him, how much I hate this little rat, that's it, I wasn't staring fuck at anyone" Dean yelled.
*"Yes, yes Prince Dean, I Will Marry you" Price Castiel replied with Happy.
Castiel was in his home when Gabriel call him in the evening. Castiel wanted to ignore the incoming call and text him as he is busy with his studying. But eventually, he knew Gabriel gonna suspect him and will call until he answered the phone. Castiel knew about his stupid overprotective brother. So Castiel answered the phone being very careful to not let him get any clue of what's happened to him earlier in the college.
Ok whatever, he thought and knocked on the door.
"Shoot brother, what you want to know?" Castiel thinks a bit before asking his next question torturing in his mind.
Dean got another few seconds to process his brain and then,
Then again Dean started to staring at Cas'face with a soft smile on his face. Dean really wanted to kiss those lips. But hey, what the hell? Dean should get his shit together. He can't be like that. He is no gay after all. But before Dean started to worry about that, he heard Cas's soft, shy And shaking voice. Cas was blushing furiously and Dean found that's so adorable.
Charlie said with a glare as Jo nodded at her agreeing with her.
........
"Shut up both of you, tell me, Dean, what did you do?" Mary asked again.
Dean got it to his hand and lift it as Cas can see it clearly.
Dean's lips curve into a little smile as he understood that Cas remembered everything. Hell, he remembered their first hug. Wow. Wait, Where was that come from? Their first hug?
"Okay Mary, see you soon" Cas sighed heavily before walked towards his college.
"Aaw a love letter, isn't it Cassie?" Gabriel teased and Castiel tried to ignore him and quickly opened the card.
"Oh, you have to go?" Dean asked and his voice filled with disappointment.
Dean pushes him to the wall this time, making sure Cas's soft body which was covered with the soft, silk dress now, is not getting hurt in any way. Dean launches to him quickly and presses himself completely on Cas's soft, warm, and creamy body.
"Hey, hey hey wait a minute. yes you are correct.of course I'm still very angry with you, and I have to have a big talk with you. but later I will do that. And now if you want to kiss the hands which made that pie, then please kiss our Castiel's hands"
"Hey pals, what's up? It's a pretty good match, isn't it?" He grinned again as Azazel shoved off Dean's arm off him.
" yeah, Put your baby maker inside my hole and fuck my brain out!" Cas commanded and Dean entered to Cas and leaned to seal their lips at the same time.
“Babe, what are you doing here? You scared me you know?" Cas kissed his lover's back of the shoulder.
But Azazel knew what is he doing. He is helping the Castiel. He groaned himself. Fucking Winchester is a badass. Will see I will catch you soon. He determined.
Your big kudos and comments are so welcome and love to here from you 😍💐
But before that,
"Ohhh god now I'm so embarrassing. Seems like I brought you some stupid gifts" Cas said closing his face with both hands.
Dean pouted at him.
"Hello?"
"Well, I thought we should invite him here, again. Maybe we can arrange a game night, what you guys think?"
"Dean I don't know what to say," He said slowly.
Cas gave him an unbelievable expression and huffed half angry half disappointing way.
"Ohhohooo man it's been years, you look bit change but few things seem like never changed," He said when he released Castiel from his bear hug, pointing at Castiel's face. Then he suddenly tried to correct it.
Dean gives him a confused face.
"The guy is so pissed, he hates the nerd as hell" Alastair answered with a grin.
Castiel slowly falls to sleep and suddnly he felt a warmth around him. He knew it's his beloved husband. Dean has sneak in to nursery and laid behind Castiel. He wraps his hand around his lover's waist and presses his chest into Castiel's back, pressing a kiss on Castiel's shoulder.
Shit, he cursed his stupid mouth in the next moment.
"Hey, you okay there?" The man questioned and tried to put a step toward Castiel.
Dean asks as Cas quickly holds his tits together just like Dean asks to because he is so curious to see what will it feels like.
"Please Ellen save my child" Mary cries slowly wiping her tears.
"Oh really? Good to know that" Dean grinned looking at Castiel.
"what? You, you mean, did we? Did you? Didn't you on your supplement babe? Dean's face lightened little by little.
"No kiss Dean absolutely not"
"Dean! Just go home please"
"No Gabe, I was sent to the North East, that time, our father denied it even how much I begged to come back and help our brothers in that war," Castiel says in a sad tone.
Destiel taught me one thing. Create your own, what you love and what makes you happy. so here you go.
"Ah Nah it's fine, I don't want to go okay? now can you stop worrying about me Cas?" Dean said with a fake glare. Castiel smiled back at him. Gabriel was carefully watching everything between Dean and Castiel.
Cas felt something wet on his cheeks as he touched his face. Oh, why is he crying?
Okay, why would Dean can't tear his eyes from this nerd boy every time Dean saw the kid is passing by. That's one big question Dean always had. But he never got a correct answer for that. Maybe because he still refused to question it further or deep down from his mind. Or maybe because Dean wanted to give a break to his poor mind which was at a crossroad right now. Or maybe because Dean didn't ready for the answer yet.
"Okay, then no touching, just one look okay? No more naughty things, okay?" Cas asks.
Castiel finally finished preparing dinner after breaking another plate mistakenly. He gave Gabriel's dinner tray into his bed because it's easy for him. But sometimes he came to the diner room to eat for a few days now, with help of Castiel.
"Dean, no. no it's not like it made me upset, I'm sorry. I'm not crying. Oh god, I'm.. I'm sorry if I made you upset by crying" Castiel said half crying half smiling.
"Yes Dean finally you understand that, thank you"
"Oh we heard that he had been passed out more than a necessary time then taken to the hospital, after that no hearing about him, who cares, fucking nerd" Uriel answered shrugging his shoulders.
Dean not angry but he was still in shock. And he was still upset because he couldn't able to see his enemy's sweet nipples. (Fuck you Winchester stop it)
"Why'd you keep calling me Cas?" Castiel's mouth always slips. He didn't mean to ask it loud as always. But it's jumped out and it's too late now to fix it. Dean's glace changed. Shit is he getting angry? Cas licked his dried lips.
"Okay Cas, I will be outside, you put your clothes outside the bathroom, okay? Then I will get them" Sam said closing his room door. Sam obviously took Cas to his room because that's what you do when your best friend came home. Right? But he forgot something important and when he remembered that Cas almost removed his shirt.
"Well, I think it's my destiny, Sam, if I didn't climb up my roof, how would I meet you like this?" Gabriel answered and Castiel was done with his brother's bullshit.
Castiel closed his eyes to calm himself as he felt so much hurt and angry. Fuck Valentine's Day, fuck Anna fuck Lisa, and fuck all. He just lost his appetite as he stormed back to his cabin and locked it before fall into his chair.
Dean said before give a shit-eating grin to Castiel. Bullies laughed again.
"And we are still seen each other face to face, Mr. Winchester, see?" Castiel waved at Dean making Dean chuckle.
Cas gasps with the tough and immediately pulls away from Dean. Both of them looked at each other few seconds. Dean's dace changes into a hurt emotion.
"No Mr. Winchester I really don't need a boyfriend to look after me, I can take care of myself" He answered but worried that if it too rough answer. But who cares it's the reality so he just said it.
Dean closed his eyes when he heard the name.
Sam asked and then he checked the side she was looking at then again at her face.
"Cas, my love you taste very amazing and I can't resist anymore. I'm gonna taste you from the source, I'm sorry baby"
"You are mostly welcome Cas," Dean said giving Castiel heart eyes, making Castiel blush.
"And hey, can't blame this poor guy here, even I found myself questioning about my sexuality when that kid passing by me, he's a freaking catch and he got this freaking hot ass" Benny admitted and the whole gang burst out laughing, of course except Dean.
Sam was still pissed at Dean for not telling him about mom and not taking him for the first time to the hospital. They argued and fought about it many times but Mary had to stop them all times.
"Well, another point to lover boy" Gabriel grinned before shoving candy into his mouth. Castiel gave him a look as Gabriel got back to his candies again.
"Sam, do me a favor son, can you call Cas for me sweetie?" Mary said giving a sweet smile at Sam and giving him his orange juice.
"I guarantee you and swear that your singing is like a great opera to my ears, but Cas that your hips shaking.... Uh, you were stunning and ravishing. damn I swear to god even Taylor Swift can't shake her hips like that"
Dean argued and Jo interrupted before they start fighting.
So if you like my fic please let me know 😍💕💕
Cas Sweetheart - //yeah, yeah. So Dean seriously, you should go back to your meeting, right? How about you give me a call after your meeting?//
No, he was done with his stupid crush over Dean a Long time ago, no more pain over him. Cas said to himself before glancing over at them again. And then he saw it. Dean was leaning into Lisa and their lips were few inches away to meet each other. Cas didn't want to see it as Cas stormed out of the corridor.
“Son, hey you okay? Can you look at me, this bullies assholes err" Mr. Singer growled and tried to help Castiel stand up but failed as Castiel fainted that very moment.
“Cum love, cum for me, I got you. So beautiful and you're so good at taking my flat, huge dick. So good baby, cum for me love”
Cas’s mouth all fills with Dean’s cock, he moans around Dean’s cock and keeps bobbing up and down his lover’s cock.
Dean licked his lips and gulped staring at Castiel's rose and plump lips. He just wanted to lick and kiss those kissable lips slowly for eternity. He was kinda hungry for those gorgeous lips.
No, he is not a coward. He has a gut. Whatever happens, he is strong than this. He should go there. Mary will understand when he explains what happened.
"Too much information" Sam murmured under his breath.
"Mm, no I don't remember that, even a bit"
"Okay alright Dean, we got you. Thank you very much. I think Castiel got the inspiration from that, please that's enough I guess" Sam cut in making Dean furrowing his eyebrows.
Castiel couldn't believe it. How in the hell Dean thought a giant teddy bear will work for a courting a grown man, to woo him almost in his office. But that's not the problem. If Castiel being honest he loved that idea. The problem was how Dean know about Castiel's love for teddy bears?
Castiel signed, he just wanted to go home without caught by any nurse who recognized him from the morning incident. He tried to be so silent and just tried to sleep. But he also was dying to meet the woman who was got an accident in the morning. He wanted to see her for a while. But he wasn't sure how he going to do that. He understands that he had to wait in the hospital until they let him go.
Dean was loosing his time over the bet and his heart started to feel some strange feelings towards Castiel 💚💙
"U'muther fucker, not'gonna listen to me right?" Dean gave him a devil glare and before he says anything else the team started to laugh at him.
We lost our mother when I was great 3. It was a car accident and after that our family was a mess" He paused a bit and sighed.
"Ahhhhhh, Dean... Mmmmm you are so unsatisfying, what if we caught up when your lips around my nipples, they will kill you right here Dean"
"No, no Mary it's fine I will come over at that time just text me your address, and is that, okay? I mean.. it's almost afternoon and I hope it's not too much trouble"
He asked just like he asked Castiel for the first time. And Castiel's face lit by a beautiful smile.
"Mary I'm so sorry, but I have to tell you something"
Castiel heavily sighs, before glancing at his beta brother.
"Okay anyone care to tell me what is the gift please, I'm going crazy here," He said.
"Drive safe sweetheart," Dean said looking into his eyes.
Cas really got surprised with Dean's behavior. What the hell he is trying to prove that he has really changed. He can't understand that, but right now the only thing he wants is, to go back home. So after few minutes, he grabbed his backpack and said bye to Sam. But as usual, the giant kid pulled him into a hug, and Cas smiles melting into the hug. And that exact moment Dean came to the living room to see their hug. His eyes filled with hurt, face still dark, and suddenly he looked away from them when Sam pulled out of the hug.
Castiel never gets ready so fast to go to the office like today. Because he knows the sooner he goes to the office the sooner he can come back home.
I want to scream saying DESTIEL IS CANNON😂😂
Castiel felt tears pouring down on his cheeks while he fought with the panic and tried to calm down his breathes as best as he can. And then he saw why Dean ran away from him as the bunch of students walked past him without having any idea that poor Castiel was sitting under the tree. Then Castiel understood that he was crying and his whole head started to spin. Also, the ground and trees around him started to spin around him very fast. The next moment his vision went completely blur and he felt his face buried in soft warm grasses.
But Mary makes sure to confirm Cas was not got any injury and send him to the bathroom after they help Cas to stand up.
And then again he can remember the morning scene which shocked him. The Castiel's mouthwatering body in that running gear, oh god all wet with the sweat, His body was like on fire as all the sweat trickled down his face. And his tight shorts were showing off the lines of his bubble round ass.
"Oh sure Anna, I was going to get some lunch, but I can go back to my office and sign those papers for you if it's urgent," Castiel said already walking towards his office again.
"Oh okay, I just wondering, you know, because you and Sam already filled me with all that details, many times now" Mary chuckled.
"Sweetie can you come over maybe 5. And I can come over to pick you up if you okay with that" Mary kindly offered and that's surprised Castiel.
"Cassie are you alrig..." Balthazar tries to ask but hearing his stupid voice is the last thing Cas wants right now as he bursts out at him.
"Hey Cassie, Deano, wow look at you guys? How's the night? Do you guys enjoyed it?" Gabriel greeted in his ways and Castiel never blushed like that as he went beet red and his jaw dropped.
"I'm not a princess and please stop saying that I have enough worst nicknames from you," Castiel said looking away.
But making the moment worse, Cas felt a hand on his shoulder as he jumped out and turned around hoping a disaster.
Dean's brows drew together with a questioning look.
"Well, it's not even two hours to our first meeting, you ignoring me already? Am I that much bad Cas?"
Dean wanted to say something too but what he is gonna say?.
"Castiel, I mean Cas? You. Oh god" Dean couldn't stop the stupid grin coming from him and he put one steps towards Castiel ending the space between them and hugged him.
Making Dean furious and angry, the rest of the team started to burst out a laugh.
Dean groaned and let the boys' shirts go and instead grabbed on Alastair's shirt collar.
"Oh god Cassie what happened, look at your bottom lip, it must be hurting, What happened man?" He asked with real concern.
"Holy shit my bathroom shower isn't fixed yet" Sam mumbled to himself as he ran back to his room.
"Huh?" Dean asked with a nervous look.
"Mmm so tasty baby, delicious. Love your tits so much. And look at them all ruins by my mouth, only my lips, and my teeth and my tongue. Mmm, you are all mine only mine" Dean moans into Cas's inviting soft lips and kisses him so softly but hungrily. His hand sneaks down and down until it reaches Cas's most secret place ever. Dean's hand stops between Cas's legs. Cas gasps into the kiss when he brokes it.
"Okay, you don't trust me, right? Not a wonder though when looking back on my past" Dean said smiling at his hands.
"Yes Daddy" Dean answered with a weak voice and that's the end of his and Castiel's friendship.
Gabriel's heart starts to pound hard as his very curious brain starts to give him thousands of questions, imaginations, and thoughts about this mystery as he secretly runs towards the garden, where Castiel was earlier. And as Gabriel promised him he will come back after some time.
But no answer from him. Dean just wanted to know that he is fine but how he is going to know that? He tried to shake Cas a bit.
"Holy hell" He muttered. And Sam glanced at him quickly.
"What? Isn't he?"
"After three months My Brother turned 18 and we claim our house back. So we didn't have to pay for the room rent. Gabriel worked so hard and he successfully entered me into an elementary school again. Then he entered again to high school to complete his graduation. My brother is a very great person. He is the reason I'm living today in many ways. Mary, he saved my life more times. Without him, there is no me." Castiel stopped taking another sip from the smoking hot cocoa.
"Gabriel, what are you think you doing in here, you know this area of the library is forbidden" Michael glares at his brother when he catches him in the closed and sealed area of the library.
"What the fuck you said you fucker? I didn't kiss any fucker and how dare you to say such a stupid thing about me? Do you have a death wish Azazel?" He yelled at him without able to control his anger.
His morning class will start in a few minutes, so he slowly walked into the study area wishing he will not run into Dean Winchester. But of course, as usual, destiny had another plan for him.
And don't forget to check my smutty so so smutty fic too.
"Cas, l.. sweetheart, why do you saying that? Please stop saying as you are not my omega. it's making my heart terribly hurt" Dean's voice is genuinely upset now.
Charlie gave Dean a pitty full face because she knew how upset he was.
"Hey, Dean coach Singer asked you to come and meet him" A boy came and said to Dean as he came out of his thoughts.
Now he doesn't want to wait for the whole day to make a decision. He knew what he should do. Castiel never gonna learn to stay away from his path, so, be it. Dean's anger helped him to get the decision he wanted as he walked out of the building and quickly went to the place the football team normally hangout when they cut the classes.
Your big kudos and comments are welcome🎉🎉 and precious for me😍😍
"Like he is not a bully. I think the truth is the reverse side" Said Benny still trying to calm him down with his laugh.
Dean is seeing red. Who the fuck dare to talk to his Lover like that. Jealous and rage rising inside him like crazy and he keeps gritting his teeth glaring at innocent Cas.
"Oh god, Azazel don't tell us that you are a faggot too, what? are you getting interested in the nerd's bubble virgin ass?" Alastair asked with a cocky laugh.
"Dean? I just, oh I'm not being rude here. I'm sorry. I just... Just surprised to see you here right now. And is everything alright?" He added again not to be rude.
Castiel didn't say anything but trailed his eyes to their hands not wanting to say it loud and embarrassing Dean. But nope Dean didn't get the hint.
God, is he joking right now. Dean felt his mouth go dry with the sound. Then Castiel raised his eyes and glance over Dean.
What the fuck? Has she ruined it? No way, she already promised me? Dean's heart filled with anger and uneasy feelings but the next moment she started again.
Cas: I LOVE YOU TOO DEAN
"Actually Mr. Winchester what are you doing in your brother's office this early morning, I mean I'm not judging or something, but just curious. And is Sam aware that you are coming? or you want me to call him and inform him that you are waiting for him?"
And then Dean got his chance to yell at Sam as he interrupted him.
"Don't be a bitch Dean, if you met him you also will like him, he is actually a nice person" Sam fired back.
"You can hit me as much as you want Omega, but I want you to know that I Love You" Dean says it barely and Cas hits on Dean's mouth as he collapses on the floor.
tightened his arms around Cas more and one hand started to smoothing his back.
"Boy, that's not what you should do when you have a big game very near future" Azazel joined with his fucking nasty high voice.
The rest of the team seems like gone backward and their laugh and smile vanish within seconds.
"Then he quickly gathered his few things and prepared his horse. I questioned him where he is going and offered to join with him. But he rejected it saying it's okay and he will come back soon. And he will tell his secret after he returns. But I felt I should not let him go alone so I objected. After he whispered as 'Sammy, I found my true mate" That's what he says then I saw his Alpha taking over, so I did not wish any fight, so I let him go. But he made me to promise to not to say anybody about it. That's the whole thing I know Ellen, but I can't understand anything" Sam says.
"Hell yeah I am, and this is the first time I'm acting like this, all because of you" Dean promised but Castiel only rolled his eyes.
"gush so hot Cas aah" Dean groaned at the hot sight, his husband cummed all without un-touching and it's so fucking hot. He couldn't survive with that as he was over the edge.
Dean's whole face covers in blood and still, he is smiling at Cas. The Alpha seems so weak, but still, there is full of love towards Cas, in the only eye he can open, after Cas's punches. because the other eye is already covered with buries. It's a really sad view to watch but Cas still have no mercy over him.
"Yeah? You sure?" Gabe asked with a glare again.
Dean was holding the heavy red rose bouquet with both of his hands, but on the side of the bouquet he can see Castiel's head tilting and he groaned biting his bottom lip, making Castiel more confusing. Dean has always controlled himself when Castiel did that cute head tilting thing. because the only thing Dean wanted to do when he doing that, was jump on him and kiss him as much as he wants. But eventually, he controlled himself. Dean licked his lips before speaking again.
"Don't mention baby" Dean chuckled.
"What happened, Gabe?" Cas asks and Gabriel tells him everything happen a few minutes earlier with Michael.
Castiel just lift his head and looked at them with a surprised face.
"Then in high school, I was dating this guy like two months then I tried it again, maybe supportive boyfriend will be great to go to my desire. But no, it didn't happen as that" Castiel smiled bitterly.
"And you know what, I'm glad you did so," Castiel said playing with Dean's coat button.
"You know Cas, I think your brother is trying to play both, nice and be the protective older brother. He wants to know that have I seduced you last night. But he didn't ask directly coz he didn't want to upset both of us, isn't it Gabe?" Dean asked and Gabriel act dramatically he got surprised. And Castiel rolled his eyes.
