John finally chanced a look at Sherlock and his eyes were wide, and his mouth was hanging open slightly. He was just as much stuck in disbelief as John. At least there was that.
Late one Sunday afternoon, when the shop was closed and there was no telly to watch, John found himself up on their building’s roof with Phillip. He did a crossword absentmindedly while Phillip looked around all of London with a pair of binoculars.
John met Clara just the once.  She came with Harry to hospital to pick him up and help move him in to his new flat, the one he really couldn’t afford on an army pension.
John doesn’t present him with an answer, just stares back, lips tight.  He is unsure how to respond, so he defaults to silence.
“Dad, PLEASE!” Harry had shrieked. She was silenced though it was obvious no one was listening to her.
It’s impossibly simple.  How can it be so simple?  Sherlock feels like crying.  He feels like crawling under the table and putting his knees in the damp grass, letting the moisture soak into the cloth and laying his head down on John’s lap.  He feels like sleeping there while the sun shines down and the leaves continue to fall.  He feels he wants to say the same thing and many other things and maybe nothing at all.
John had typed up their latest case.  Sherlock had fumbled around with a blowtorch for most of the day, a bit of his left eyebrow singed off in the process.
Sherlock moved towards John again, wrapped his fingers in his hair and kissed him, all the while walking backwards towards his bedroom.
“Okay.”  John should be embarrassed, he can feel himself smiling, he’s being so obvious.  He laughs a bit, heart leaping.  It’s been so long since he’s done this.  A man, flirting.  Trying.  He’s nearly stammering. “You’re unattached, like me.  Good.”
John hadn’t realized this was where their conversations were leading exactly.  In the back of his mind, he’d hoped a little but wasn’t sure that he’d make a good partner to anyone.  But she was good, Mary.  Her honesty was needed, the way she made him laugh, the fact that she didn’t seem to mind how unresponsive he could be, how broken he still was, and she hadn’t even asked why.
For a moment John thinks he’s going to carry on like nothing has happened. He thinks he’ll tell Sherlock to sit down and make him tea. Bring out the chocolate biscuits that he likes. They’ll turn on the telly and watch something mindless and get used to each other again. But John doesn’t quite manage it.
“John, I’m so sorry,” Sherlock says softly.  Sherlock returns to his chair, watching John carefully.  “She left that for me.  She told me to give it to you.”
John doesn’t answer, but he half smiles and there’s a look in his eyes that tells Sherlock he really is honored.  He kisses Sherlock and runs a hand through his curls.
The case was supposed to be barely a four, something that in the past Sherlock wouldn’t have even left the house for, but he’d been so desperate for cases to keep John occupied that he took it anyway.  And now he’s been stabbed by the drunk angry soon to be ex-husband of their client.
By the time they were outside on the pavement, Sherlock was laughing so hard that his cheeks were red.
“This all right?” John asks.  His face is open and vulnerable and Sherlock can see all of it.  The years of being in the closet in his formative years.  The lover he took in university that he doesn’t talk about with anyone.  It’s all written there, and so is his vulnerability.  He looks beautiful.
“Well, what are you doing?” John asks the bee.  He moves to put a hand over the bee to cup it between his hands.
“I missed this,” Sherlock says.  He wags a finger in the space between himself and John.  John takes it to mean “I missed time with you” or something similar.
.  He hadn’t gotten much thinking done and he’s more confused than ever.  Without knowing why he wrote down the phone number for his dormitory on the receipt along with his name. He doubted the man would even be interested in men, let alone himself—and yet.  He liked the man’s dark hair and dark eyes, and even darker voice.  The worst that could happen was that someone else besides his old roommate would
John knows Sherlock doesn't know what to say.  They don't normally do this.  Instead, Sherlock kisses him, and John kisses him back.
“Apparently, I don’t know…we are publicly drunk,” John replies, and then begins to laugh.  Sherlock joins in, running a hand down his face.
he was famous. That was the worst bit. Sherlock had done something incredible, and now his picture lit up every television screen and his face was plastered on every newspaper. John didn’t care about any of that. He was only interested in the very handsome and sharp witted man approximately six inches in front of his face. The famous bit was actually putting quite a damper on things.
“I’m sorry dear. I know you and I know that love is not easily found. I just couldn’t help myself.” She then stood on her tip toes, kissed John’s cheek, and left the book shop.
“I agree,” Sherlock says. “I kept thinking I was going to get back and then things kept getting in the way.”
When they finally did go all the way through with it, Sherlock almost started crying with the pain of the pleasure.  John left bruises and scratches across his body, leaving a map of all the places he had been, like a red X saying
He can hear his voice breaking now.  It has hurt to carry this much.  To unload it is too much of a relief, but he can’t have the relief if he isn’t believed.
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed and kicked off his shoes, each landing onto the floor with a dignified thud.  He then slid the rest of his body onto the bed and laid down on his back, eyes to the ceiling, listening to John breathe rhythmically next to him.  Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever be able to really fall asleep, not with John lying so close to him.  But, eventually the scotch and John’s breathing gently lulled him to sleep.
He is to tell Mary he has forgiven her and to stay with her until his daughter is born.  He can’t let anything happen to her.
It started when his plane landed in America, at LAX, and the first thing Sherlock had done was chain smoke nine cigarettes on the cab ride to the safe house.  He would only be in Los Angeles for one week (thankfully) but in that time he would have to find three of Moriarty’s men.  At least that was the plan.
“Maybe a little,” John replies, a smirk falling over his lips.  There’s something in his face that Sherlock can’t quite place but it looks…hungry.
John shakes his head at himself, pondering himself and the way his hand had come up to his mouth; he almost feels innocent.  In a way, he is dying next to Sherlock, just very slowly, very softly.
“Hello Mycroft,” John said, and did not extend his hand. He could tell there was no need for formalities.
“He’s going to try to kill you?” John asked, and anger coursed through him. He wanted to protect Sherlock. He was going to protect Sherlock.
He watches him from across the police tape.  When their eyes finally lock, John can’t help but smirk a little.
“If you mean it,” John says, “I would very much like forever with you.”  John clears his throat again and looks at Sherlock for any indication of how he should proceed.
John wants nothing more than to pull Sherlock to his chest, but he knows that would be a terrible idea.
“John, I’m sorry. Do you want to stay over tonight?” Molly asked, fiddling with her wedding ring which she did when she was anxious.
But the years of being bullied about it.  The years he spent knowing he was gay during the early nineties, when the AIDS epidemic was taking place.  It was hard not to think terrible thoughts about his own desires.  John could just as easily turn on him.
Sherlock smiles, then puts the cigarette to his lips.  The smoke joins the night air and is gone soon enough.  John doesn’t want to admit it, but Sherlock makes smoking look gorgeous.  Then again, he makes most things look gorgeous.
When Sherlock was dead, he used to tell himself all the time, that if he could have him back for just one minute, that he’d tell him how much he loved him, how he’d wanted him since the beginning.  But it wasn’t even about just that.  He wanted to fall asleep next to Sherlock, to kiss him when he woke up, wash him in the shower when he inevitably fell into the Thames again, take his shivering body and warm it.  He wanted to protect him, and Sherlock was not the type to seem to need protected.
After about an hour of John having his ear talked off the blond woman showed up at his side again and led him down a different hallway. “He wants to speak with you again,” she said, and John assumed he had misheard her until he was once again alone in a room with Sherlock Holmes.
“Wow, a thank you, impressive.  Here, ice it,” John says, handing Sherlock a flannel filled with ice.  Sherlock places it against his face and winces.  It feels amazing.  “Now, let’s ice that and get you cleaned up.  I’ll bring you a clean shirt.”
John is trying to be cautious, worried.  He doesn’t want to offend Sherlock.  Sherlock tries not to have his hopes dashed immediately.  It was stupid to have had these types of hopes in the first place.
“You know, I’m always amazed,” John begins, turning his head towards Sherlock, “that after everything, we’re still here.  Back here.”
The way he says it, how he doesn’t look at John when he says it, tells John not to question.  John simply nods and looks back towards his laptop.
Sherlock continues not to look at him.  Sherlock’s hand has gone to his mouth, his fingers touching his bottom lip.  He continues not to say anything.
“I didn’t know that you were interested in men,” Sherlock says, looking at John and the television at the same time.  His hands are pressed together; a dead giveaway.
Tamil Nadu is a fantasy of a place.  It’s unbearably hot.  He feels ill with how much he misses.  He can’t help but wonder what John is doing at this very moment.
Sherlock brings fucking cylinders to the pubs, to measure out exactly how much they’re drinking, to make sure they feel good all night but not enough so to get them actually drunk.  The only problem with this is that John wants to be drunk, not only because of the fact that he’s in love with his best friend, still, but because the idea of not getting truly drunk on his Stag Night seems awful.  And, to top it all off, not only has Sherlock picked specific spots where they’ve found bodies together (for him, this is Actually Sentimental), Sherlock didn’t invite anyone else, and John doesn’t mind at all.  It’s all more than a bit Not Good.
John turns to Sherlock and his eyes are tired.  John’s eyebrows pull together and he looks so nervous, like he’s waiting for Sherlock to say something else.  John sighs then licks his lips, and watches Sherlock carefully.
“I’m not his date,” John says.  He doesn’t want to seem to eager, to scare him off.  John doesn’t even know what he’s doing, he had told himself No Men over a decade ago.  Yet here he was, looking at Sherlock across from him, who didn’t correct Angelo, and who was making him smile genuinely, something he didn’t think he’d be able to do again.  He tries.
“I was supposed to meet Lestrade today but I can’t look at him, he allowed me to consult when I was just starting and he brought me to so many cases. His reputation is in danger too, he’s the one who let me…” Sherlock trailed off, ran a hand through his hair, and for a second John thought he might throw something across the room. “I never wanted to be famous John,” Sherlock said, his mouth a hard line and his eyes so distant. John had never seen this look on his face before. “It was all a favor for my brother. Then somehow the media got a hold of the story. I didn’t want this. I was perfectly fine solving crimes without anyone ever knowing my name, without anyone paying me a cent. I didn’t want this. I love solving crimes. I adore the thrill of the chase, the endless possibility. I loved running around London. It was perfect. This is what I’m good at. I don’t want to stop. But now someone is trying to ruin my reputation. My career. My name. All of the hard work I’ve put in. All of the energy spent. It won’t matter, because now when people see me they will only see a pathetic addict who can’t even keep his own past in check. No one is going to take me seriously. Everyone will assume I’m untrustworthy. I’ll be…nothing again.”
They’re the type of drunk that used to annoy Sherlock.  The type of drunk where he can’t remember much, can’t focus, the outlines of his vision fuzzy.  His brain is slow which normally is unacceptable but now, now it’s magnificent.
Sherlock rests his forehead on John’s shoulder, the bad one. John takes Sherlock’s face in his hands and swallows hard as he looks at him. John gulps for air and then feels his eyes sting.
Sholto before the accident was impossible.  John tried very hard not to look him in the eye often.  He knew exactly how much trouble he’d be in if anything ever happened, which it never would in the first place, because this was James Sholto, John Watson’s Commanding Officer.  Each time John was called into his Commanding Officer’s tent to speak with him he thought he’d actually die.  Every time his Commanding Officer told him he’d done well John would look down, laugh a bit, say thank you.  Entirely un-soldierly, not One Bit Soldier Like Thank You Very Much but he was never questioned about it, and he counted it a small miracle.
He finds himself kneeling on the left side of his bed, knees on the floor, clutching his bed sheets, head pressed into a pillow, the syringe lying in the center of his mattress.
He’s laughing, really laughing.  And it’s all too much.  He’s so happy he’s going to die.  And there, his cane, being handed to him after he’d forgotten.  The tightening of his chest when he looks to Sherlock, who is standing against the wall, beaming at him.  God.
“Oh, my God,” John whispers to himself.  He thinks about assaulting the fully grown five year old laying on the couch, but instead walks up to his bedroom and locks the door.
“You know what.  But you aren’t going to say it.  It’s okay though.  Like, I know you’re not going to introduce me to your parents or anything or…even say you’re my boyfriend, I know.  But I do sort of wish you’d just say it.”
“Oh my God,” John whispered against Sherlock’s throat.  John backed away for a moment, then he shoved Sherlock backwards in the direction of his bedroom.  They watched each other for a moment.
When Sherlock sees John at breakfast the next morning John’s face looks exactly the same.  There is no trace of the sobs that came from him last night.  No tension in the shoulders, no dark bags under the eyes.  He looks shockingly unchanged and it doesn’t make sense.  Sherlock had expected something to be different, anything.  Perhaps John has gotten better at lying from having to live with Mary.
John’s heart was hammering in his chest. He felt as though this was a dream, surely he was having some sort of vivid hallucination. But then he recalled the day before. Sherlock hadn’t even wanted him there yesterday. What had changed in twenty four hours? John felt confused beyond belief, and he was hurt too, if he was honest.
“Guess I should be going,” John said, grabbing his things.  He walked out of the library, and didn’t turn around.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed the scar. It made John feel over exposed and very raw. He hoped Sherlock would never do it again and at the same time he hoped he would do it every day for the rest of their lives. And that was a frightening thought.
“Well you know, all that and,” Ellis paused, took a swig, then resumed, “All the nice girls like a sailor.”
He turns, looks around.  He is in Sherlock’s bedroom, the expensive, fluffy pillows and sheets all huddled together around him.
“Anderson,” John said sternly. He rested his head on his chin, hardly having the energy to be angry at what he knew was about to happen.
“But, I mean.  Look at you,” John says.  He looks genuinely confused as he crosses his arms across his chest.
“Tell me, he said, "What is this thing about time? Why is it better to be late than early? People are always saying, we must wait, we must wait. what are they waiting for?"
He turns on the television at six o’clock and tries to concentrate on what he is watching.  On his fourth drink, he’s already properly drunk.  The show he’s watching is absolute rubbish.
“Oh bloody hell,” one of the men said, dropping his fork onto the table. “Uh, real sorry--” he began, but Sherlock cut him off.
They’ve made a complete mess of each other. They stumble into the shower together. Sherlock insists on washing John’s hair for him, which makes John laugh endlessly. After the shampooing, Sherlock pushes John against the slick tile wall of the tub and kisses him. The whole bathroom smells like mint, and as Sherlock gets down on his knees for John in the tub, John thinks about how he’d dumped the shampoo bottles open looking for a sign that Sherlock was still alive. John has to push the back of his skull against the wall hard to keep his legs from going out underneath him as he tugs Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock whimpers beneath him.
It does not matter how often or how persistently he tells himself that the drinking will not solve anything.  He feels too much and it is mostly pain.
John didn’t know why but as he left Evan’s room, he felt frustration rise in him. He felt trapped. And it continued.
Before John can reach Sherlock’s mouth fully, Sherlock is falling onto him, his hands on John’s face.
“That thing that I was going to do tonight, I’m not anymore. I canceled, said I had to spend the evening answering questions about the upcoming trial with John Watson from the Yard.”
Sherlock had been completely unprepared for Magnussen.  Watching John humiliated, knowing the only way to repair his idiocy.  He took the gun from John’s side and shot Magnussen at point blank in the head, destroying that beautifully chaotic brain of his.  Now Magnussen couldn’t threaten John.  And, Sherlock would finally leave John alone.  Maybe he could just be happy now, with a wife and a child and no freak junkie to keep an eye on.
Sherlock continues, and John simply says no.  How could Sherlock think he didn’t believe in him?  It’s absurd really.  Of all the cases, how they met, the little things he would pull out of nowhere just to show John.  When you live with someone for two years you can’t keep up an act like that.  He knows him, and he loves him.
“I want you, please,” Sherlock whispers, kissing down John’s neck.  “Please,” he says again.  He rolls his hips again and John wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist.
“I wish you were here.  I wish you were here more than anything but you aren’t so please get out of my head,” John whispers at the walls of Baker Street.
“Why?” Sherlock asks, and it’s genuine.  He looks up from the paper with a clearly confused expression on his face.  He looks manic, and he’s barefoot.  For a moment, John wonders if Sherlock even knows where he is.
John thought he was rid of the possibility of talking to Sherlock again entirely until it was time to close the shop for the day. Right as Mrs. Hudson was leaving, she tapped John on the shoulder and smiled softly at him.
“It’s going to smell bloody awful in here for ages.  God. But…” John looks at the clock again.  It’s not as if he’s got anything on tomorrow, still looking for work.  “Sure, I’ll take a cuppa.”
John made his way into the elevator and to his shock Greg Lestrade was there. John hadn’t spoken to Greg in about a week, and Greg looked just as surprised to see John as John was to see him.
Unluckily, however, it’s almost as if she can feel his eyes on her and she looks up and around.  John looks away, but it doesn’t work well enough, and he can feel Molly’s eyes on him.  From the corner of his eye he sees her get up and walk down the train, feeling at the top handles all the way as the train makes a turn.
“Good night, Sherlock,” John says.  He lifts his hand and brushes Sherlock’s hair out of his face, then quickly moves his hand away, nervous.
“Sherlock, it hurts,” John whispers, more into his glass than to the outside world.  He’s talking to no one, he should go back to his therapist.  Talking to someone should help.  Talking to the walls is making nothing better.
“That was very stupid, I hope you know.  You just willingly were going to take that pill.  I know I said it earlier.  But…you really must be mad.”
John awakes at two in the morning.  His arm had been tucked around Mary’s belly.  The bed is still warm but she is gone.
“Okay. Um. I’ll go in now.” She’s practically whispering. She looks so hurt at his rejection, but that only means someone else hurt her much more recently.
left months ago. But when John reads it, he knows that can’t be right. John’s hand shakes hard as he holds the note in his right hand, the left clenching and unclenching at his side. John huffs out a breath and blinks rapidly.
“Well, you are a complete smart arse but lucky for us I find it endearing.  For the record, I was sort of hoping this wasn’t just friendly anyway.”
“You know I thought you were just going to be helping me pay the rent.  Turns out you are helpful in more ways than one.”
John has come to the conclusion that there really is no point in dating other people when he is so fiercely in love already; it would just be unfair to whoever he pursued.  The only reason he had been dating was for shagging anyway, and even so, he wasn’t sure it was for any purpose, he was just going through the motions.
Sherlock breathes softly on the sofa.  It’s three a.m. and John had come down for water.  Only the desk lamp is on, and in the soft glow Sherlock breathes softly, a book on his chest.  John walks over, takes the book away (but saves the page) and pulls a blanket over his chest instead.
“Even if you do love me, we both know I am simply what is left over from the life you had chosen that has gone completely wrong, which, coincidentally, would never have happened had you never met me.  If anything I am a consolation prize after you have lost everything and, how I’d like to believe you John.  But that would also mean--” Sherlock cuts himself off, and puts the back of his hand to his mouth.
When he gets back it has just turned five o’clock.  He walks to Sherlock, to show him the bottle, to invite him to sit down with him.  When he makes it to Sherlock’s bedroom however, he is disappointed.
Sherlock braces himself and grips the side of the tub.  John puts his hands against his nose and then jerks them slightly to the right.  Sherlock yelps and grimaces.
Sherlock’s love came in waves.  Most days he’d been able to look John in the eye and not fall over.  Other times it flung him sideways with the smallest touch.  John would sometimes squeeze the back of his neck when handing him tea or coffee, or when they were sitting in the dark together in the flat with the curtains drawn trying to solve a case going through pages of evidence.  On nights like those it was enough to make Sherlock giddy.  It was enough to make him feel sick.
He is sure he loved Mary, whoever she was.  He is sure that although none of anything she ever said to him was real, he loved the lie with such an intensity.  He wishes it weren’t true, but it is.
Sherlock sighs and then holds his breath and downs the whiskey.  It burns and when he finishes he shakes his head and sticks his tongue out.  John laughs.
The waiter is chattering in their ears, talking about champagne, and John would have been angry except that Mary is covering her mouth trying not to laugh and so he just shakes his head and grins—until.
"She isn't dead you know," Sherlock says.  "I got her out of a tight spot.  I believe she's in China now.  Last she texted anyway."
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock asks.  He stays near the door, as if afraid to move freely in his own flat.
John had said “I’ll bring my things over round noon on Friday” and here it is, noon on Friday, and Sherlock’s hands are shaking.  His mouth is dry and he can’t help that his heart is racing in such a sickly fashion.
“Oh, please.  You don’t want me to go away at all,” Pretend Sherlock says, and he’s right.  He’s always right.
“Yeah?” John asks. He’s fairly certain if he had to move much from this chair he’d vomit, and that would be quite embarrassing.
John wakes up on the sofa, the Union Jack pillow tucked under his arms. He runs a hand over his face.
“You.  Flirted.  With Sherlock Holmes.”  John’s head falls to the side, partly out of anger, partly disbelief.
“Maybe.  I don’t know,” John replies.  He takes a sip of wine.  Nothing has felt as dangerous as the possibility of this conversation since Sherlock went away and his heart is beating out of his chest.
Sweat trickles down his temples and he wipes it away. He’s broken into a flat and now he’ll have to explain to Mrs. Hudson. He’s got no idea what he’ll tell her. He leaves 221C and slams the door behind him as he leaves. He stomps back to 221B and unlocks the door. He feels dead tired suddenly. He closes the door to 221B and then slides down slowly against it. He pushes the heels of his palms into his eyes and sighs heavily. He had just hoped so much. He’s sick of waiting. He needs the waiting to end. What if Sherlock has been alone on Christmas?
John tries to remember that he is indeed over the forty year mark, but at times it’s hard to recall that number, when just last night he was running across London at four o’clock in the morning and it felt like nothing at all.
He remembers the way John’s face had looked upon seeing his body.  He remembers the empty gravestone, the little speech.  But it’s been half a year and John is nothing if not capable and although sometimes there were glances, sometimes words had fallen out a few times, a few gestures, (like the time Sherlock had pretended to be asleep on the floor when John had come downstairs for water and John had run a hand through Sherlock’s hair a bit too slowly to be platonic) but then Sherlock reminds himself of who he is, and though people have wanted to touch him, none have loved him, and John is no exception.  Exceptional, of course.  But not in this case.
Sherlock is standing on the coffee table. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and there’s a cigarette tucked behind his ear.
Sherlock watches him, his mouth opens and closes.  Then it turns into something incredibly sad and ancient.
It was dark and Sherlock didn’t really want to think about Victor Trevor, who ended up hurt because Sherlock had a little cocaine problem.  It was awful to think about and so he rarely did.  Still, he wasn’t sorry.  How could he be when he had something much more incredible in his bed?
The sirens helped, but Greg still nearly caused several accidents. He was trying to move as fast as he could and he was working with limited knowledge as he wasn’t on duty. After many minutes of honking and brake squealing, Greg parked and John dashed out of the car.
Sherlock had spit in his face, which had earned him a broken nose he would later reset alone on the mattress of the safe house.
Whenever he opens the door to this room, John will turn and look over his shoulder, mouth neutral, but with his right eyebrow cocked, as if he doesn’t know who is entering.  His hands are always clasped behind his back. Then, he turns the whole way around and sees Sherlock, and smiles gently, no teeth, just a thin line.  The room is white, and bright, and completely cleansed of anything but John.  This room is perfect.  Sometimes (being a total of three times (twice while he was away destroying Moriarty’s network, the third the night of John’s marriage), when Sherlock is alone and feeling particularly horrible because of it, he will arrange the night sky above them, and they will lay underneath it.  Nothing else has ever entered this room.  John is always wearing his maroon cardigan with the plaid underneath (he looks most handsome in this).
“Another Paracetamol if you’ve got it,” John replies.  He feels weak.  “And juice if it hasn’t already been contaminated by body parts.” Sherlock cracks a smile.
John wants to do everything with Sherlock, but he doesn’t want to push him.  Doesn’t want to scare him away, or go too quickly.  He would have waited the full two years, and much longer, if he’d known at all that Sherlock was alive in the first place.
He can feel his heart pounding out, feel his stomach turning itself inside out, his eyes hurting but he keeps them open.
Sherlock’s lips are trembling, and he’s rubbing his bloodied hands together, like he always does when he’s nervous.
During the months Sherlock spent planning John and Mary’s wedding, he had been living mainly off of cigarettes, coffee, and very little sleep.  Before John had asked him to be his best man, Sherlock had told himself that he was not going to help with the wedding.  He would attend, but only after an entire pack of cigarettes and probably a few glasses of scotch.  He would stay quiet and watch the ceremony and attend the reception briefly and then leave and not leave bed for a minimum of three days.  He would not be involved in the planning of the wedding at all unless specifically asked.  It had surprised him how easily he had fallen into planning the wedding with Mary.  He ended up doing much more than half the planning but he realized that it gave him a distraction, a way out.  Instead of exhausting himself with thoughts of what it would be like to watch John marry someone else, he had been able to push the wedding along and put all of the useless grief to good use.  So he’d picked out flowers and plate patterns and entrees and smoked cigarette after cigarette.  It was how the smoking had begun again, really.
John would hate this if he knew.  He would hate Sherlock for thinking of him like this if he knew.  Sherlock cleans himself up and folds his knees into his chest.  John would be disgusted.  Sherlock closes his eyes and feels nauseous.
Once Sherlock walked out, John picked up the painting and took it into the back office. He unwrapped it carefully and lost his breath when he saw what it was. It was La Mariee by Chagall. John knew it was the original. There wasn’t a doubt in his mind.
John was different about things after that.  No longer kissing hard, positively shoving his tongue down Sherlock’s throat.  No longer roughing him up so badly he’d bruise.  No longer pulling his hair so hard Sherlock’s eyes watered.  Instead, John would gently place a hand behind Sherlock’s neck, finger his soft curls at the nape, and kiss him lightly.  He’d move the back of his hand against Sherlock’s jaw, soft but deliberate.  He’d smile as he did so.  This, Sherlock didn’t know what to do with.  He went with it though, because it made him feel a sort of weightlessness.  No longer did a steady hurt emanate inside him, but instead a kind of ease found its way inside.  John would go slow while touching him, would take his time fucking him, would no longer grind down against him but would kiss his way inside.  John would get on his knees for Sherlock, staring up at him from the floor with a lovely patience in his eyes.
And here is John, back at Baker Street, begging him to quit again.  As if he hadn’t caused it entirely.
John has to admit: running around with Sherlock all the time, getting shot at, nearly dying three times a week, had been madness.  Despite how he had loved it terribly.
Sherlock had thought (foolishly) that John was just on another date.  Then, when John had gripped his throat and fallen down on top of him, he’d felt the box against John’s left breast pocket.  It all made sense.  The restaurant, the champagne selection, the realization feels like burning.  Suddenly the pit of Sherlock’s stomach feels raw and tight.  Every noise he hears makes his entire body jerk.  He knows the feeling, even if he hasn’t felt it in years.  Anxiety attack.  He’s on the ground and he’s letting John bleed him dry.  If John choked him to death right now it would be amazing and a release not unlike climax.  He doesn’t mind, so long as John continues to touch him.
“Beauty is a social construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences, and role models.”
How will he approach him again?  Quick and (hopefully) painless seems the only option.  To storm into John’s life just as he stormed in at the very beginning.  To demand entrance.
John didn’t want to do it.  It was something he hadn’t done in a while, and frankly didn’t want to do here.  This place where he felt useful and needed while not Ever Being Bored didn’t need to be stained of some memory of days past, days John often pretended didn’t happen for the sake of his surroundings.  But one night he woke up right in the middle, between midnight and the Witching Hour, and he had been dreaming so intensely of someone who sort of looked like Ellis that it couldn’t be ignored.  He started thinking about James Sholto, the first to bark orders at him—which he had surprisingly enjoyed—the first to verbally tear him down when he’d gotten no sleep and had gotten too cocky.  He thought about how tall, how thin, how kind he had been (before the accident) and pulled himself out, and got it done in no time at all.  The safest thing about it was that no one else would have known what he was thinking.  The worst part was, John was the only one who’d know what he’d been thinking.
His mother was sending him letters telling him Harry was adding spiced rum to her morning tea and that his father was falling ill.  John chose to push it into the back of his mind; it wasn’t as if he could go home anyway.
John ran down the stairs and back into the flat. He dialed the Ritz on his mobile and bit at nails, nerves taking over. He tried to rationalize: he’d dated plenty of men and women throughout his life. Many very beautiful, very smart, and very kind people. John tried not to be intimidated to no avail.
John rolls over so he’s facing Sherlock and then blinks several times, waking up.  He takes in his surroundings and then looks at Sherlock and smiles.
It’s only been about an hour when John is about to turn off the light and looks up to see Sherlock standing against the door frame.
“I think it was my brother actually,” Sherlock said. “I think he was giving Moriarty information on me so that he would talk and give Mycroft information that he needed. I decided it’s not worth being angry at him. He has his methods and I have mine.”
John was suddenly much more alert, eyebrows furrowed together as he remembered the smile, dark hair falling into the eyes.  John could almost feel a blush coming on.  He’d called.
John cleans up, and looks over at Sherlock from the kitchen sink.  Sherlock looks anxious, tapping his fingers on the side of the sofa, and John would be concerned, but he’s learned what Sherlock looks like on bad days.  On bad days, Sherlock goes quiet and still, looking out and seeing nothing.  This is not like that.  This isn’t PTSD from his time away, when John couldn’t protect him.  This isn’t his depression or his addiction acting up again.  This is restless anticipation.
Mary hugs Sherlock and it’s as if he’s watching a film.  Sherlock asks to speak to John alone and it feels like he’s watching his birthday video from when Sherlock was dead all over again.  This time he doesn’t have a glass of scotch to comfort him.
“What is it?” John asks. “In Terling?  My Dad took us on vacation there once.  What the hell is going on in Terling?”
Sherlock rips off the Semtex with such vigor, and John finally collapses into a heap. Sherlock is crazed, blinking rapidly, eyes wide and pacing.
“You’ve loved me forever, haven’t you?” John asks.  His voice seems raw and there is a confused pressure inside of it.
There are a few times Sherlock feels this with John.  When he sees him across the restaurant about to propose to a stranger, when he moves back into Baker Street after said marriage ends.  And when they meet.
It isn’t easy when most of Scotland Yard takes them in holding hands together for the first time.  John knows Sherlock had been nervous.  He’d only held his hand tighter.
They eat with the telly on low.  If it wasn’t for the knot of worry in Sherlock’s stomach and the noticeable addition of grey to John’s hair, Sherlock would say that he could pretend like the last four years never happened.  He could pretend that it’s September of 2011 and there is still hope that John could reciprocate his feelings, the ones that have been occurring without consent for ages and make him want to sleep for years straight, they make him so exhausted.
Sherlock unwraps the box precariously, as if afraid to rip the paper too forcefully.  When he opens it he inspects it.  Sherlock holds the bow lightly in his hands.
He finds Isaac on a dirty mattress near the back of the room, sweating and shaking.  He’s only about twenty.   John sometimes forgets how early these things can happen.  Isaac definitely needs a doctor.
John thought Sherlock would kiss him. He thought that the gap would finally close here, and God how he wanted it to. Instead Sherlock whispered a “Good night” and made his way into bed. John walked back down the stairs and laid down on his sofa. He rubbed at his temples and tried to will his desire away. Sherlock was not something he could have. This had already been established in months past. But it was so difficult when the man was upstairs in John’s bed. John tossed and turned until he heard footsteps coming down the stairs.
John looked up to see the first customer of the day, and was surprised to find that the man who had stepped inside looked very familiar. John’s brows pulled together as he tried to place the face. The man had dark curly hair, sharp eyes, and incredible cheekbones. Besides looking familiar, the man was absolutely gorgeous. John coughed into his fist to avoid gaping openly.
John has to pull him out of the cab and pay the fare, it isn’t the first time and he’s sure it won’t be the last time.
“Been with anyone.  It’s been months,” John replies.  He continues his scrubbing while watching Sherlock in the mirror.
Perhaps he dreams of Ellis because he wishes for a simpler time.  Maybe it is because Ellis was always so completely open with him.  Perhaps it is because Ellis always wanted him to be better than he was, wanted to open John up, crack open his entire being and enter, and was never allowed to do so.
John sits down with the paper, smiling a little at the mannequin hanging from a rope.  Sherlock’s phone dings again; stubborn git. It’s ridiculous really, how thinking of such an arrogant arsehole of a man make John feel like he’s dying slowly, but in the good way.  Not feeling very stubborn at all, John makes his way over to Sherlock’s phone and picks it up.
That was when reporters started to realize just who John was. He was that very Watson from the photographs, and the very person who had changed Sherlock’s mind. Reporters began to turn to John and took his photograph. Some began to bark questions at him, and as the camera flashed John ignored all of them, feeling nothing but relief as the love of his life smiled back at him from the podium.
“Put your shirt on, then the ice back on,” John says softly.  They watch each other for a moment, and Sherlock almost feels afraid with the intimacy of it.
And so it begins.  She must have been visiting with Mrs. Hudson.  John feels somewhat guilty.  It’s been nearly a year since he’s been to see her.
“What is it you think I was going to say?” Sherlock asks, keeping his voice as emotionless as possible.  If it all goes wrong he’ll want to be able to deny.
Everything just sort of goes cold and silent after that.  The half rain half snow has started, and it doesn’t matter much that he’s been pushed onto the ground.  He reaches the body, still warm.  Still so warm he could be breathing somewhere inside that giant coat, his heart a small bird possibly fluttering.  But there is no pulse, no way inside his mind.  John wants to crawl into his ribcage, lay on the pavement next to him and fall asleep.  Maybe not wake up forever next to him.
Sherlock moves toward John’s chair, then puts his hands in John’s hair and kisses him in full.  John returns the kiss and there’s something about this that feels different.
John tears the envelope open and almost rips the card. The front of the card is a dog wearing a Santa hat. John smiles at the stupidity of it and then opens it. It’s a blank card, but Sherlock’s handwriting takes up most of the card.
The knife cuts down his calf, and he thinks he really may have failed this time.  But he is able to dodge to the left just in time, grabs the knife, and aims down.  It’s the first time he kills a man in ten years and he hates every second of it.  The alternative of dying in this French alley himself without seeing John again is far more terrifying.
He learned in rehab that he’d always have addictions.  They would simply manifest in different ways.
He hates that he’s doing it, and he doesn’t know anything for certain but he shaves and puts on his “date” clothes. He looks at his reflection in the mirror and doesn’t hate it. He sighs at himself and clenches his fists at his sides. Nods. Sherlock is going to show up today.
“Absolutely pathetic effort at that last slice,” John said, and the entire table burst out laughing.
the bold is sherlock's perspective.  i didn't think i'd be adding anything from him in this story, but it just sort of happened.
“She was just sitting in the chair, waiting for her appointment.  I didn’t know what could have caused it, Sarah pulled her file up before she went to lunch.”
This, the re-creation of his mind palace, is one way in which Sherlock could explain to John how he cares for him.  This might be enough to make him start to understand.
After Sherlock was washed and dressed, John made them tea and breakfast. He opened the kitchen window to let the breeze in and Sherlock picked at his eggs and toast. After a while Sherlock folded his hands on the table and looked John in the eye.
Sherlock won’t let John do the shopping alone; that is certainly a change.  John expects it will only last a little while, Sherlock will get bored of it.
“You’re going to thank me for this until Christmas,” Harry declared. This is the number of Sherlock Holmes’ brother, Mycroft.”
John is crying.  It is not loud but it is not quiet either.  Sherlock can tell from the sound that John’s body is wracking with sobs.
The sound of Sherlock’s voice is so unnerving that John almost opens his eyes. But he doesn’t. He squeezes them shut and allows the fantasy to wash over him.
Living with Sherlock slowly becomes Home again.  Sherlock will play the violin after dinner, and as the nights grow colder they light up the fireplace.  They don’t go on many cases these days.  Sherlock is entirely focused on Magnussen.  They try to find out how Mary and Magnussen are connected.
“Yes.  I’m not sure when exactly it happened but I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love you, so.  There.”
, of course, but you can’t disappear. Without me knowing if you’re dead or alive, hurt or not, please. You don’t even have to stay I just want to know that you’re alright,” John says, rambles more so. John wipes at his eyes, feeling very silly, but it had been so unexpected.
But Sherlock wouldn’t sit down. He was gathering all of his things and heading towards the door. John wanted to grab him, to make him stay. Just a few minutes ago John had told Sherlock he could stay forever. He had meant that. John put a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, but Sherlock brushed him off, and his eyes were wild and angry.
In November, Sherlock orders John’s favorite Indian takeout and gets a bottle of wine and when they have eaten and the bottle of wine has been poured out, Sherlock hands him the manila envelope.
The plane turned around, in a swift and steady movement.  Sherlock put his head in his hands again.  He laughed to himself.  Thank God he hadn’t said it.  The three words.  Here was the universe again, giving him John Watson.
Sherlock takes a quick drink.  He hasn’t drank in quite some time, especially after his last overdose.  He thinks the last time he drank scotch was the stag night, which had been such a disaster in so many ways, Sherlock thinks it’s for the best he’s stayed away from alcohol.
“Mycroft has been searching.  I think he’s close,” Sherlock says.  They’re in the back of a cab, on the way back home after a case.  It hadn’t taken long.
“Much better. Proving you can clean up alright,” John said, nodding. Phillip winked, then jumped up a bit in excitement. He took all day to get ready for dates. He said it wasn’t just a matter of looking nice. He had to fully concentrate on the woman he was going to be seeing. “Wish me luck!” he called across the flat.
“No. No, I’m definitely not one for playing it cool. Certainly not under these circumstances. My flatmate. You might recall. He never gave me the message.” Sherlock hummed into the phone, almost agitated but John pushed through anyway. “Perhaps I could pop round for tea later, or something?” John asked hopefully.
“Doesn’t she mean anything to you?” John demands.  “You once nearly killed a man because he laid a finger on her.”  It’s only later he realizes he may have been talking about himself as well.
“Shit,” John mumbles, and then picks up the shopping and goes inside. He shoves the postcard in the back of his top dresser drawer, along with the two other notes. He isn’t crazy, Sherlock is out there somewhere, and he cares enough to send messages.
“Phillip, he’s in trouble right now would you just go back to bed! I’ll talk to you in the morning.”
When a rather sharply beautiful woman is naked in front of one, one is usually pleased with the recent turn of events.
He remembers fantasizing: Sherlock moving his palm from John’s face to his hair, pulling lightly as John kisses his neck, leaning in when John kisses the side of his mouth, opening his mouth to let John in.
“The forever part, too?” Sherlock asks.  He looks coy, resting his long fingers against his left cheekbone.
“I had hoped that there would be, but I was assured there were not,” Sherlock replied, his mouth going soft. He looked hopeful but also like a newborn baby bird, frightened and trying to find a ledge to safety. John loved him intensely in that moment.
“You doing okay?” She asks. She has blonde hair and pink glossy lips. She looks young. Probably still in university.
John wakes up to the paramedics ringing him.  Panic hits him, as evidently Mrs. Hudson has been shot.
Sherlock stands, comes towards John until they are inches apart.  Sherlock looks down at John, and his face is pure panic.  John continues to be an immovable ancient pyramid.
Always frightened of getting what he always wanted Sherlock had simply said it was fine and played violin for John and now he’s holding a fucking tin of tomato soup and a bag of crisps and he can’t recall anything else.  Maybe he dissociated again like he did often in his early twenties.  Maybe he’s so in love that he can’t see where he’s going.
John sighs.  Now that Mary knows she doesn’t have any competition she’s absolutely trying to get John to see Sherlock again.  She isn’t wrong, she never is.
The third (and horrifyingly his ultimate favorite, he will admit to himself sometimes) is that John will strangle him to death against a wall in 221B Baker Street.  The intimacy of the idea of this act leaves Sherlock dizzy.  When Sherlock came back from the dead and John pinned him to the ground and wrapped his hands around his neck, Sherlock thought, for the briefest of moments that all of his most secret desires were about to come true.  Sadly they did not, but Sherlock has filed away the feeling of John’s beautiful fingers against his throat, in hopes, with patience.
“She’s so funny, you know John?  I’m sure you know.  She’s just got something so big in her that she can’t get out most of the time.  I can see it in you too,” Clara said, sipping her tea.
The first time John blacks out again, it is a bit like a false memory.   He hadn’t blacked out since the early days of Sherlock’s death.
“I can’t take this, it’s a gift Harry.  From your very charming, lovely wife.  No, that’s alright.  I’ll get myself a new one.”
Sherlock is clutching fistfuls of John’s shirt and John can feel against his chest, just barely, the shaking of Sherlock’s shoulders.
“What do you want?” John asks. He’s still half asleep. He sips his tea and doesn’t break eye contact.
John almost laughs.  He does not feel that he exactly needs to be protected.  After all the danger he has willingly put himself in with Sherlock at his side, getting hurt seems like nothing.
In the morning, he would have thought it was all a dream if he hadn’t seen the folder waiting for him on the night stand.
When John reached the front, he stopped in his tracks. Standing before him was Sherlock, wearing a purple button up and looking radiant. John thought his heart was going to stop.
At home in his new (year old) flat, he makes tea.  It’s a bit bigger than Baker St, also farther away from the heart of London.  It’s at least better than staring at all of Sherlock’s things, making himself crazy.  It’s been a year and a half and he’s still hurting.  He doesn’t think it will ever stop at this point, it is terminal now.  Ubiquitous and lonesome.  As is his love.  That’s really the worst part of it.  The desire still there.  The way Sherlock moved his hands against the violin still a vivid memory, beautiful and sharp.  John sits down to take his tea, let’s himself rest.  He hasn’t had a drink in two months and he’s quite impressed with himself.
John’s head leans against the back of the chair.  He stares at the ceiling, like he has stared at so many other blank walls for a completely different reason.
“Ha,” John said. “No. My friends made me go on too many dates as of late. They’ve all been quite terrible.”
“I am mad, that’s the whole point,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. But John wouldn’t give up so easily.
Sherlock gave John a floor and room number. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” Sherlock said. And then the line went dead.
The look on John’s face is magnificent.  He’s trying to hold in a huge smile and so Sherlock stops trying.  He lets out a small laugh and then beams at John.  He can’t help it.  Sherlock can feel himself blushing.  It’s all horrible and fantastic at once.  He thinks he should possibly be embarrassed but can’t bring himself to feel embarrassed at all.
When he reaches John’s bedroom door, he stops.  It is open only an inch, and it is completely dark inside.
John has Sherlock’s full attention now, which makes it all the more real and all the more terrifying.
They eventually climbed back over the fence and said their goodbyes. This time, John kissed Sherlock first. John thought he could kiss the man endlessly. They made a date to go to see a film the next day, which felt far too common for Sherlock to do, but at the same time Sherlock seemed to be desperate to do the mundane. John supposed fame would do that to a person.
The idea of getting even drunker with Sherlock is utterly fascinating.  He’s seen Sherlock tipsy, but not drunk.  And they’ve somehow never been drunk together.  It’s terrifying and wonderful at the same time.
It’s strange to stare into the bullet wound, to see the impact.  To see the damage that Mary has done physically.  John takes the gauze and tape and patches the wound.  Then he moves to wrap the bandage around Sherlock’s torso.
“I don’t know what came over me, I just kept talking as he was unbuttoning his trousers. He had to tell me to leave.”
He isn’t sure how he got here though.  With the tin and the bag in each hand, it’s hard to recall how he ended up in the shops in the first place.  He can hear rain pounding on the roof.  Thunder.  It’s rained every day for the first half of November.
“Pleasure,” John said, and almost stood up to shake Mycroft’s hand when he saw that he was completely ignoring John and electing instead to make himself a drink.
this fic has been posted for awhile, but has never really been polished properly.  the lovely girlofthemirror has offered to beta this fic for me, and i am eternally grateful.
But John pushes the cart in Tesco and Sherlock wanders off and then brings back fifteen types of salad dressings they will never use and so John has to talk Sherlock out of it.
John finds himself in a small hole in the wall pub.  He has three pints and one shot.  He finds himself texting Sherlock, unable to stop himself.
The nurse tells them a story, though John can’t be entirely sure what of as he’s half asleep, possibly snoring even.  He wishes he cared.  Sherlock’s arm is around him at one point, of that he’s certain because it’s all he can concentrate on.
“The fingernails,” Sherlock replies, swallowing hard.  He doesn’t really care for beer but he’ll do it to amuse John, and Sherlock doing anything to amuse anyone besides himself isn’t something he’s used to.
John scoffs and shakes his head. He still wants to punch him a bit. Or kiss him so hard it bruises. Either one.
“I didn’t say I…don’t like boys. I just said. I’ve got a girlfriend,” John replied. The words came out easily after several beers and adrenaline pumping, were coming out easy as this boy looked at him like he understood.
John eyed Ellis rather coldly.  He licked his lips and then smirked. John felt angry and he wasn’t all that sure why.  Ellis was right, about all of it.  That’s probably why it stung so much.
“Isaac, it’s Doctor Watson, from next door.  I’ve come to get you out of here,” John says, placing his palm against Isaac’s forehead.
John does indeed get coffee and breakfast later.  Sherlock eyes the eggs that John had fried up and eats one and then leaves the other.  He has never been one for breakfast, mostly just cigarettes and coffee, though he’s been trying to quit and failing miserably.
“Human error,” Sherlock says blankly, not looking at John.  Sherlock stares straight ahead as the elevator moves up, and John sighs heavily, feeling confused as to why he’s carrying a cup of coffee, why he’s moving in an elevator, why he’s in love with two people at once.
Sherlock follows John inside. When they get into 221B John hangs his scarf up, forgetting what he was even leaving the house for. Sherlock stands in the doorway of the flat, looking hesitant to come in. Like he’s out of place walking into his own home. John raises his eyebrows and Sherlock finally walks through the doorway.
“You can’t leave again,” John starts, and then clears his throat, shakes his head, that had come out horribly. “No. No what I mean is. You can leave
Around three months of John’s continued stay at Baker Street, Sherlock decided that John must have been using his unlikely body to numb the pain.  Sherlock kept chanting unheard prayers to himself, thinking
“Come on, it’s me Phillip. You can tell me anything!” Phillip’s hair stood up at all sides, which was a sign that he had been up all night researching conspiracy theories. John sighed and couldn’t believe he was resigning to telling Phillip his woes.
None of this would have been a problem if John could have just married a normal person, but of course that wasn’t an option for him.
Only he may not have slept through it.  No, he vomited most of the scotch up before he fell asleep.  He thinks he got most of it into the toilet this time.  He rubs at the left side of his face, then at his calf, sore.
“Thank you,” Sherlock says quietly.  Sherlock eyes him, mouth slightly open, as if about to say something else.
“You know I wouldn’t.  I think about it but I already know I won’t, I’m too much of a coward.  Unlike you,” John replies.  He doesn’t know why he replies.  It’s not there.  He’s talking to the breathing walls, the untouched microscope slides, the pages of ink on many shelves, notes from old cases stuffed inside at random.
John has been asleep for over an hour, so Sherlock pulls out a cigarette and opens his bedroom window.  He’s tired, but unable to sleep.  He lights the cigarette and takes a long drag.  He’s been trying to stop smoking in 221B all-together but it’s difficult on nights like this.  He misses John so much and he’s upstairs in his bedroom, which makes it all the worse.  Sherlock wants to watch him sleep.  He wants to watch John laugh at bad telly and make bad puns at the criminals they chase.  He misses so much and it’s all his fault for leaving and making it go away.  Sherlock knew as soon as he’d jumped that it had been the wrong plan to go through with but there was nothing left to do about it.
Sherlock’s eyelids are drooping, but he’s serious now. He has his hands in his lap and his eyes on John. His face is soft.
Sherlock is currently hiding out in Kazimar and it feels wrong to be making this kind of arrest in a holy place.
“So know this: today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved—in short, the two people who love you most in all this world.”
“Do you need me to walk you across the street?” As soon as he says it he realizes what it sounds like. He bites his bottom lip.
John can feel the look on his face.  He can feel the way his mouth softens and the way he blinks too rapidly but he does nothing to stop it.
Sherlock lets out a little chuckle. John can feel the vibration from the laughter against his thighs. Seeing Sherlock so relaxed and happy warms John’s heart. His mouth feels dry and he worries he might cry but John doesn’t, he tugs on Sherlock’s hair instead and Sherlock whines a little in response. Sherlock opens his eyes and then rolls over to his right, pushing his face into John’s stomach. Sherlock takes John’s shirt in balled fists. John rubs Sherlock’s back. His entire chest hurts, it feels heavy and painful and completely overwhelming. Sherlock is so absolutely present after so long, John isn’t sure what to do with himself.
Sherlock drives the hour back to his hotel room and chugs two bottles of water.  There is no air conditioning.
He lets Mary visit the grave with him.  The things he has said to this waist-high stone, to the dark grass underneath, are still lost on him sometimes.  He once got in a cab intensely drunk and told the cab to take him to the grave.  He is fairly certain he’d told the rot under his feet that he was in love with it, scotch burning his throat.  How morbid.
Sherlock holds up Mary’s mobile phone.  John feels his head tilt to the right, can feel his eyebrows furrowing, his fingers starting to drum against the chair.
Sherlock looks at him, then away quickly.  John is afraid to meet his gaze as well.  It feels like so much.  His heart is pounding and there shouldn’t be any reason for it.
At least Irene had made sense.  If Sherlock had loved her, (and John was fairly sure that he had) it made sense.  She had been intense, beautiful, brilliant, and cruel.  Just as Sherlock could be.  And at least then they’d had that common ground: being in love with a dead person.  An ode to their dramatics.
The flat is very clean.  There is no clutter, all of Sherlock’s papers stacked and placed in a proper order.  It’s almost unrecognizable with how utterly polished it looks.  John suspects there are no body parts in the fridge.
“Hold on a sec, I don’t know where we’re meeting, I don’t know a thing about you, I don’t even know your name.”  Sherlock feels a smirk fall over his face.
He knows Mary will be here soon.  He puts the ring back into his jacket and downs some more wine, trying to ease himself a bit.  He orders champagne from a waiter and just as he finishes doing so, he sees Mary coming down to join him.  He can’t help but smile wide at her.  She looks beautiful, her purple dress a good match for her, and she’s positively glowing.
“I don’t know. I live across the street and I thought I’d come in. I’ve never been in here before.” She shrugs. “I’m Anna by the way.”
“I just wish I could have been there to help,” John says after taking too large a swallow. Sherlock instantly begins to shake his head.
Sherlock reaches across the table and puts his hand on John’s forearm. It’s warm. His hand swallows up John’s arm. John has forgotten how tall Sherlock is. The bathroom light goes on all on its own and John looks behind him. When he looks back Sherlock is gone. There he goes, always disappearing.
Sherlock’s been a complete idiot and his thigh has a long angry slash in it, and it’s been bleeding fairly rapidly.
Sherlock being with someone else, actually being with someone else, doing something as ordinary as dating a girl he met at his best friend’s wedding, it just doesn’t seem like a possibility.
“See, I knew you couldn’t stand me up, that would make work on Monday rather awkward don’t you think?”
“You’re back,” John says, voice quiet. He’s been telling himself for months that as soon as Sherlock got back he’d kiss him, damn any consequences. But now he feels nervous. Too nervous. Sherlock has snow in his eyelashes too. He’s more beautiful than John remembered. Of course.
“We’ll get caught, shut up!” Evan hissed, his dark hair shaggy, falling into his face, needing to be cut, needing to be pushed away. They both sat down on the floor, leaning against opposite walls, and John began to think again. He imagined;
“Hello, you must be Phillip,” Sherlock said from the tub. John ran a hand down his face. Phillip immediately turned around and closed the bathroom door. He took a deep breath in and out.
Sherlock is shaking terribly, and he can’t seem to stop.  He wishes he could, that he could seem a little normal.
Anna downs the rest of her drink. The ice clinks as she slams the glass back down on the bar counter. She turns her head back towards John. She takes his hand in hers. Her nails are painted black and she’s wearing three giant rings. She interlaces their fingers. He’s worried about her. She looks about to cry. He needs to stop this.
“I think goodbye would be appropriate,” John said, then made his way out of the hotel room. Fake girlfriend or not, he clearly wasn’t welcome anymore.
at times.  And he knows he’s been stuck in his own head completely for the last three days.  Sometimes that’s the only place there really is.  He’d needed blessed silence for a short vacation.  Something like that.   A way to tidy out everything in his head.  Delete some remainders, things unneeded.  And yes, of course, he can recognize just why his silence can be worrisome.  But it’s been almost a year now, Mycroft really should give him some credit.  He even went to a couple of the meetings, for God’s sake.
“I didn’t want you to know I’d gotten hurt.  I just wanted to come back and let things fall back into place.”
Their days feel so much longer suddenly, and maybe that’s because they resolve not to do much without the other.  Mostly, there are so many things that change yet stay the same.
John hung his jacket up in the back office and Mrs. Hudson came through the back just as John flipped the sign in the window to “Open.”
“You aren’t allowed to die, I just got you back, please, please,” Sherlock begs.  His hands are pressed so deeply against John that it very nearly hurts.
After the girl screams her head off in Sherlock’s presence, the next time John sees Sherlock, one of the hit squad is shot dead and Sherlock is standing over him, completely confused and overwhelmed.
“Don’t be stupid. A complete idiot. That’s the stupidest thing you’ve ever said,” Sherlock says, panting a bit. He kisses John and John can taste the sweat on him. “I never would have left in the first place if I’d had the option.”
John eases into a smile and it looks real and he doesn’t look away.  He snickers and nods at Sherlock, as if laughing under his breath at a secret joke only he knows about.  But Sherlock knows he’s laughing with him not at him.  John has never laughed at him.
“Please, come home,” Sherlock says with a clenched jaw.  It’s very late at night, of that John is aware.  “Please stop.  You’re killing yourself.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, then looked back at John and gave him a half smile. So he was annoyed but trying to reign it in. That was a good sign.
John can’t be certain but he’s fairly sure that Sherlock has pushed their chairs closer together over time, like they were on John’s stag night.
John thinks back to the tiny diner and to falling asleep on library desks and having to sneak out of a dorm room that wasn't his early nearly every morning, to make sure no one would know.
Sherlock used to play for John all the time. He used to attempt to keep the nightmares away.  But he can’t do it now, he is too afraid that he will pick up the violin and he will begin to wail and collapse as soon as he does: reminded too quickly that he has always been unwanted.  He fears that if he picks up the violin to play for John he will crumble, and the façade he has worked so hard to keep up will be over: he will be forced to admit.  And John can’t know Sherlock loves him in this way.  In the way that most of the time feels as if nothing good could come from it.  In the way that Sherlock would rather cut himself into pieces than watch John suffer.  And John is still suffering.  The truth of John’s wife and child is still etched into every line of his face, in every silence, in every moment John will not look Sherlock in the eye.  The problem being that Sherlock is afraid it will never stop.
“Look at the cover, it’s got vines, flowers, and rose bushes all over it!” Sherlock said, flicking his wrist and waving the book away. John inspected the cover closely and then scoffed.
“Ah, the Yard’s finest. I take his badge to use on cases when he’s distracted,” Sherlock said, and John had to laugh at that.
It’s his third beer of the night. He wishes he knew a better way to deal with the missing. It’s more annoying than anything else. Knowing Sherlock is alive and not knowing what to do about that fact. He knows what he would
It’s a Tuesday morning, and John rolls over to face Mary, her lilac walls framing her sleeping figure.  She’s soft in sleep, beautiful.  She blinks a few times and then matches his gaze.
He’s had sex before of course.  But it was never any good, always when he was high.  He felt nauseous thinking about it for a moment then looked back at John in his blue robe.  His eyes didn’t leave Sherlock’s face, a refusal to hide from him.  Hide from himself.  The breeze hit then, and Sherlock hears the leaves.  It sounds beautiful, and John continues to look at him like he’s the fucking sun.  He feels less nauseous, and the longer he just lets himself experience being looked at in this particular way, he is finally able to not feel sick at all.  He doesn’t shake.  He is cared for so well, he realizes.  Being looked at this way lets him know nothing bad at all could happen, would happen.
“SHERLOCK, STOP!” John yells from the ground.  Sherlock turns to face him, eyes wild.  Sherlock is breathing heavily.  He falls to the ground where John is laying.
“I’m sorry. Did you just say ‘whoopsie daisies?’” Sherlock said, putting the back of his hand to his mouth, trying to stifle his laughter.
On the second day, Sherlock makes John eat.  He has toast and then later biscuits.  He forces it down with tea.  The shaking is better.  Sherlock changes the bandages on his feet.  He sleeps, mostly.  Sherlock is in and out of the bedroom, and so is John.  He dreams of train rides where a woman keeps falling over and over.
“You want me writhing underneath you, don’t you?” John asked, his smile taking on a dark quality.  “Well fine, then.”
“Okay.  Goodnight, John,” Mary says, adjusts her purse, then walks away, only after looking back once and smiling.  John had forgotten what someone actually being interested in him was like, and it felt rather nice.
“If anyone out there still cares, I’m not actually gay,” John tells her.  It’s not a lie, but it’s not quite true either.  He isn’t gay.  But he’s also deeply in love with a man.  He isn’t gay, that was always his cover.  He likes women too, so, he’s not gay.
"I think I did love him, yes.  But nothing happened, ever.  How could it?  He was my Commanding Officer."
John thinks about telling her. She’s looking at him with such concern, and he hasn’t been able to talk to anyone about this. But he thinks of Mycroft, and he worries that saying something to Harry will put Sherlock in even more danger. So he finishes his drink and bites his tongue.
Sherlock aborts his love and leaves it in the tips of his fingers as he grips John’s hand, bare skin to bare skin.
He felt outside of his body.  Watching himself have one realization after another. One idea after the other.
“Goodbye,” Sherlock said, then leaned down and kissed John’s cheek. John closed his eyes, not wanting to see Sherlock leave the shop. He knew this time had to really be the last time. He would never see Sherlock again. This was going to be the end of it.
“I didn’t realize there was anything to discuss. The last time I saw him he made things pretty clear, and I haven’t spoken to him in months. I’m sorry I just. I don’t understand.”
“I want you,” Sherlock whispers. “Can I-I-” And John can hardly believe it but Sherlock is stuttering. John nods quickly, kisses Sherlock again.
They sit around the kitchen table.  Sherlock realizes he still has feet in the refrigerator and there’s four different types of mold on the counter, for an experiment.  Normal people would probably be thrown off by that.  Would probably think that was a bit disgusting.  John doesn’t know these things exist yet but John also willingly went to investigate the murder of a woman, wanted to go see a corpse and so Sherlock feels he probably won’t be too thrown off by the feet.  John has agreed to live with Sherlock and he hasn’t yet moved his things in, and Sherlock knows he won’t help at all and John will roll his eyes and pretend he’s annoyed but won’t be, not really.  Sherlock can read all of this so vividly, and loves it.
It’s an hour later now, and Sherlock comes marching out of his bedroom in his blue robe, snatches John’s novel from his hands in a nearly violent way, tears out one of the pages, picks up a pen, and writes in big, bold letters across the page:
“If one wishes to be instructed--not that anyone does--concerning the treacherous role that memory plays in a human life, consider how relentlessly the water of memory refuses to break, how it impedes that journey into the air of time. Time: the whisper beneath that word is death. With this unanswerable weight hanging heavier and heavier over one's head, the vision becomes cloudy, nothing is what it seems...
then tacks it to the wall where his current case is spread out.  John has no idea what it means.  He doesn’t ask either.
John scoots over just a fraction to his left and holds up his bed sheets for Sherlock to crawl inside.
“Those aren’t staying there, put them in the crisper,” John says, not once tearing his eyes away from Sherlock.
“Right. Well. Bad news. We have security cameras and I did see you just put a book down your trousers. So. Here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to take the book out of your trousers and either put it back or purchase it. And if you don’t, I will gladly force you out of my shop. I returned from my military service just six months ago. Afghanistan. Trust me when I say I would love nothing more than for you to try something.” John didn’t stop smiling once as he spoke, and the man’s eyes grew more and more terrified. John had to bite down on a laugh. He wasn’t a large man, he knew he didn’t look intimidating in the least. But he did know what he was capable of. “So, I’m going to go back to the front counters now. See you shortly.” John turned back towards Sherlock, who was chuckling softly to himself. His laugh was a low rumble that was all sorts of beautiful and John hoped his blushing wasn’t too obvious.
“I have a date tonight,” Phillip said, turning to John. “I don’t know what to wear. Help me out?” The last time Phillip had had a date, John had locked himself in his bedroom for a full day, too afraid to see something that would cause him to have to bleach his eyes.
He thinks something inside snaps.  Somewhere inside one of his lower ribs, and it makes him gasp.  For a rather humiliating moment he thinks he will fall over, but John pulls him closer and holds him steady.
He feels like he is going to die or shake terribly until he shatters into something ugly and unkind.
“I can’t believe I can just do that,” John said, at the same moment that Sherlock whispered “You have to leave.”
Three beers in, they’re outside of the pub.  It’s gotten late, and they’re both tired, somewhat leaning against the other while they wait for a cab to pass.  When one finally does, John waves it down and opens the door for Mary.
“John!” Sherlock says. He doesn’t move from the wall. He’s shivering. He’s been standing outside the flat for longer than five minutes. John walks towards him slowly. His heart feels like it’s beating out of its chest and he no longer feels chilly. He feels like he’s going to sweat out of his jacket now.
John listens to them talking, and has to wonder if Sherlock enjoys it.  Moriarty is flirting, he’s said so himself, and it’s so strange to hear someone so forward with Sherlock, anyone besides Mycroft anyway.  It strangely makes John’s heart twist, all of it, and he can feel himself shaking his head, shutting his eyes.
with the name of the pub and the time and it was 8:00 pm now and John needed to get into a cab as soon as possible so he wouldn’t be late.  He glances at himself in the mirror once more.  He has the date jacket on, and one of his nicer navy blue sweaters.  He hasn’t been sleeping well, hasn’t in a long time really, but he still looks decent.  He can’t believe he’s going on a date again, after over a year, much more than a year, of not doing so. It’s almost funny to think he’s doing it, and it was only ever going to happen again if Sherlock was dead.
The next morning John waits for Sherlock to come out of his bedroom.  He sips coffee slowly, trying to process still what the last two weeks have brought him.
Sherlock had been humored moments before, but after the rehab comment his face had changed. He was upset, John could tell, and he wouldn’t stand for it.
“John, I—” Sherlock began, but was cut off by John’s mouth.  This time, Sherlock did not hold back.  He was fairly sure this was how he was going to die, heart frantically pounding so hard inside his chest that it would finally burst and rip his entire ribcage apart.  Sherlock’s fingers gripped John’s shirt, tugging desperately in an attempt to pull him closer.  John’s arms slid around Sherlock’s waist, his fingers slowly pulling Sherlock’s shirt off of him.
Sherlock was the perfect groom. He was the perfect man in all aspects, but it hadn’t gone unnoticed to John how Sherlock had let go of all control and had let someone else plan his wedding. For a while, Sherlock had been all controlling. He had been spending his evenings yelling at caterers and scolding cake makers. In the end, he had given up, and had only rested his head on John’s shoulder during their first dance as husbands, letting all of his worries fall to the wayside.
John had told him he’s loved him since the beginning.  Had kissed him up and down.  Had left bruises around his neck that Sherlock is sure he will love looking at in the mirror later.  It’s everything he’s ever wanted. And he wants nothing more than to go back to bed and press his body to John’s but he’s so frightened that he can’t do either of those things.
“But you held my hand,” Sherlock says.  John can barely keep his eyes open, and neither can Sherlock it seems.  John smiles, shakes his head.
“There you are, one arm at a time,” John says.  Sherlock feels a bit like a rag doll but John’s hands are warm and gentle so he doesn’t mind much.  “I can’t believe how hard he got you.  I’m glad I at least got him back.  Pretty sure I may have fractured his jaw.”  John smiles at this thought and Sherlock hums.
“It was good to see you,” John says.  Molly smiles lightly and nods.  John steps out of the train’s doors and shakes his head.
Sherlock is next to him, fast asleep, mouth hanging open a little.  There is sweat on his forehead from sleep, and his curls are sticking to his forehead because of it.
John wakes up on the floor of the living room. Sherlock is awake on the sofa, looking at his phone. So, it hadn’t all been a dream. John gets up, heads towards the kitchen, then remembers he’d locked the door.
“Yes,” he replies finally.  John nods to him again, then opens the door.  John goes first, they don’t want him after all.
They hadn’t spoken much, didn’t need to.  John had wordlessly placed mugs of tea into Sherlock’s hands and Sherlock had spewed nonsense that was not entirely understood every couple of hours, and John would simply nod in response.
Right now, he looks to Sherlock, who is smiling but looks devastatingly sad.  John looks away.  He can’t try to understand what that look means, because if he knew what it meant, it’d ruin everything.
Sherlock leans forward again, about to speak.  John is only vaguely aware of footsteps on the stairs.
John’s right.  HE’s always right.  But Sherlock is determined to get him out of London.  He’s not even looking at Sherlock as he asks, he’s still looking at the file and it’s the most frustrating thing that’s ever happened.
They had gone inside together, and John had sat back down into his chair when his mother had looked at him sternly and said “Go to your room, John.”
Perhaps, if Sherlock told John that he dreams of keeping John in his bedroom and never letting him leave, keeping him hostage there, he could begin to understand.  In this dream, John only does as Sherlock says.  He eats only when he is told, sleeps only when he is told, speaks only when spoken to, and bathes in the makeshift bathtub in Sherlock’s bedroom, between the bed and the dresser, washing each limb as Sherlock instructs, eyes never leaving, endlessly wandering.  They are alone and together forever.
Sherlock’s hands are in John’s hair, on his face, Sherlock’s thumb rubbing gentle circles against his cheek.  It breaks him.  They could have been kissing for hours, John isn’t sure.
His ankles feel heavy.  He opens up the new book he’s been trying to sift through.  Something in him wants to reach out and pick up one of Sherlock’s chemistry books, but he knows Sherlock’s handwriting will be there, and it’s all still so raw, two months later.  John won’t remove any of Sherlock’s things, he doesn’t want to touch them because that would seem rude, Just In Case.  Mrs. Hudson has stopped asking.
John ran to the room, getting held up once by a locked door but finally finding his way inside. The venue was packed, and when John looked up to the front he saw Sherlock, looking as radiant as ever.
“What is it?” Evan asked, and then a look of horror crossed his face. “Oh God, you don’t like men do you? Oh, God…”
Sherlock looks so small as he says this, barely keeping his eyes open, his mouth hanging open after he speaks, as if he’s going to say something else.  He looks at John as if expecting something.
They get back to Mary’s flat late, and John feels so tired but he also feels so angry, and he knows he will break soon, and he doesn’t want Mary to see that.  He never expected her to need to see him breaking all over again over Sherlock, and he doesn’t want her to.
The same night that he went to university his boy in the next room ,  Evan invited him to a party. He was eighteen years old and after the goodbye he’d said today, John Watson imagined he could have a drink, or several. John had four beers and didn’t usually drink much and suddenly he was with Evan, walking back to their halls, holding his hand. He didn’t know why. He just was. It didn’t feel like a betrayal. They had gone running around, they had broken into a dormitory that wasn’t their own, and John had been laughing so hard, and it was four a.m.
“If you’re going to die again, you have to know that I’m in love with you,” John says in a low tone, his hands balled into fists.
“I got word yesterday that it’s quite possible that Moriarty is in Russia. So I’m going there. But, I brought this for you.” Sherlock gestured down and John saw that it was a framed painting, wrapped up in brown paper.
As soon as Mary closed the door, John’s hands went to his temples, and he let out the loudest sigh Sherlock had ever heard.
“Yes, yes he did.” John almost couldn’t believe the words coming out of his own mouth. “It was sort of sweet, really. I know he’s famous and probably knows how to act for the press, but he said that he was just as famous as he could be but also that he was just a boy….standing in front of another boy, asking him to love him.”
John touches Sherlock’s knee, leaves his hand there just a moment too long, and Sherlock can’t possibly be misreading this, even with all the scotch.
It was as though Sherlock read John’s mind. The next thing John knew, Sherlock was kissing him. It wasn’t aggressive or filled with passion. It was soft, and sweet, and shockingly chaste. John was in too much shock for it to be anything but chaste. His hands stayed on his own hips for the duration of the kiss, and God did he want to kick himself for that.
John shook his head and then turned momentarily, only to see a man on the shop’s security camera with wild hair and a disheveled suit shoving a book down his trousers. John swore under his breath.
When John finds that Irene is in fact, not dead, he is angry.  He imagines Sherlock, composing sad music and sulking around the flat.  He’s miserable, and John has hated every moment of it.
“Did you miss me?” Sherlock asks.  He’s so quiet.  John feels as if his skin is vibrating.  This doesn’t seem like it could be truly happening, his vision is too blurred.
“Christ,” he mumbles to himself. He thinks about nine hours ago and gets up to shower and brush his teeth. When he comes out of the bathroom he sees that Mrs. Hudson has left him tea and toast. She’s playing radio and washing dishes downstairs. He eats the toast and gets dressed. He goes to Tesco and buys shampoo, laundry detergent, and oranges. He takes the tube back and checks the mail on the way in.
Sherlock wraps his robe around himself and huffs off to his bedroom.  John shakes his head and makes milky tea while he waits.
“I won’t know what I’m doing,” Sherlock says quickly and quietly.  “I’ve never…had anyone like this.  I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.”
The last line on the postcard is sloppier than the other two. Like it was more rushed. He wonders if Sherlock is in pain.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”  The man asks.  He talks quickly, spilling John’s life story onto the lab floor in front of them, and John doesn’t believe.
“Okay,” John said, laughing lightly. “I’ll wait. I have no idea what it’s for but thank you all the same.”
In the mirror, inspecting, he looks old.  He’s found a few grey hairs on his blond head, and the wrinkles around his eyes have grown more noticeable over the last year.
“I mean, I just…I have known you for over a year now. I’ve come to think of you as a son. I think you hang the moon, and I just want you to be happy. So I stole that little piece of paper out of the bin this morning, and I called the number.”
"If you've loved me for so long, tell me why you got married," Sherlock says.  He's looking away and John knows he didn't want to bring it up, didn't want to ask but just has to
“John, I love you,” Sherlock says, his hands making their way up to the back of John’s neck, into his hair.
Greg threw his head back and laughed, while John swallowed down absolute terror. He threw back the rest of his wine and went to refill his glass. “You’re barbarians, the lot of you.”
The first is during the day.  Sherlock is shot on a case and bleeds out all over John as he is held in John’s trembling fingers.  This is cliché and pathetic, but Sherlock does not care.  It would be beautiful, to smear his own blood across John’s cheek as he reaches out to him one last time.  Sherlock knows this is fucking disgusting, and doesn’t give a damn.
“There have been more women than men, that’s true.  But I don’t think I connect with them the way I connect with men.  And if I’m being honest…I’ve not connected with anyone the way it is…with you.”  John clears his throat and adjusts his body under the sheets, feeling vulnerable.  That just won’t do.
Sherlock huffed. “Sure. Why not?” He grabbed a pen off the counter and spun around until John handed him a piece of paper out of a spare notebook. Sherlock nodded his thanks then quickly scrawled a message onto the paper. “What’s your name?”
Sherlock leaves to go outside with Mycroft for what John is sure is a cigarette and he knows he has to go to Mary.
John rounded the corner, saw the pack of cigarettes on the lip of the sink, and grabbed them. Sherlock held a hand out when he saw them and John handed them over, feeling more flustered than ever.
They reached Greg and Molly’s house and John rang the bell. Greg threw the door open, mumbled a greeting, then promptly walked away. John could smell something burning in the kitchen and Sherlock laughed softly next to him. His laugh was a low rumble, and the sound made John’s chest tighten.
“Who?” John asks.  He knows who.  He just needs to confirm.  He needs to make it seem as if the answer isn’t
“Fine. Very…very good.  So did you want to grab a pint sometime or something?” John felt as though he were fumbling with his words.  He also figured this couldn’t be much different than chatting up a girl.  Or at least he was hoping.
She gives him a confused and drunken look and Sherlock beams up at her.  She turns around and he turns back to John, and starts laughing uncontrollably.  John is cackling into the back of his hand.  It’s all so very silly.
After they finished and John had kissed every mark he left, John fell asleep.  Sherlock left the bed and walked to the bathroom naked, then stared at the mirror and looked at every mark that John had left on him.  One on his neck, one on his shoulder, bruises on his hips where John’s hands had squeezed, half-moon shapes across his chest where John’s nails had dug into him.  Sherlock closed his eyes and remembered every mark.
The second is to die at the exact same second as John, so that he will not ever have to live in a world in which John Watson is not alive.  He’d prefer they died younger than sixty, but he’d be willing for older if that’s what John wants.  They drown together, and though Sherlock cannot breathe he has John’s lips on his so he suffocates beautifully to the press of John’s mouth on his.
“Of course, John,” she says, wrapping her long fingers around her wine glass.  He can feel her itching to say something, and he hopes to God she doesn’t.  Though Harry has never found it difficult to talk about these things and she certainly won’t after a few glasses of wine.  She’s always been the braver of the two.  She always gives into her whims, which may be how she ended up so unhappy.
“The butler did it in this one. I can tell by the cover,” Sherlock Holmes stated, his voice deep and gravely floating across the shop.
Sherlock realized though, suddenly, while solving a murder, that John was what kept him right.  Kept him so happy.
“I think I know what you were going to say on the tarmac.  You started, and then you stopped,” John says.  He is looking down into his glass but then he meets Sherlock’s eyes and for the first time in a long time doesn’t look away.  They are both sat in their chairs and neither says anything for a few moments.
After Greg shut the door behind them, John heard both Molly and Harry shriek with delight. They had barely made it out the front door. John sighed.
John is going to have a child.  Sherlock feels so wrong for immediately wishing it weren’t true, but the thought comes anyway.
The next raid, John doesn’t lose anyone.  Nor the one after.  When he does lose one again he blinks, nods, straightens up, and buries another.
He looks around, a bit confused as to his surroundings, only to realize he’s in his old bedroom at Baker Street.
“Oh no John, you do lie.  Just to yourself and not other people.”  The words fell out before Sherlock could be bothered to stop them.
They walked around in the soft grass for hours. The only sound aside from their own voices were the crickets chirping in the distance. Even the hum of London traffic was blocked out by the trees surrounding them, and John had not felt so content since he had been holding a gun in the desert. It was a completely different kind of content, but it was a contentment he felt nonetheless.
This time John doesn’t wake up and catch him, though Sherlock knows he smells like smoke no matter how much he has tried to cover it up.  He doesn’t know if he really needs to try to cover it up.  When he climbs back into bed John kisses his knuckles, makes a “hmmph” noise and then pulls him closer.  He noticed and has decided not to comment, for now.
He does so, and when his breathing is controlled he watches John and can think of only one thing to do.
“How are you, haven’t seen you in a spell!” Stamford says, overly friendly.  Sherlock suppresses an eye roll.  He likes Stamford just fine, but he’s really not in the mood.  He’d had to drag himself out of the flat today.
“No worries,” Sherlock said, eyebrows pulling up. “I thought you spilling hot tea all over me was the really low bit.”
The morning comes, and John is only a little nervous when he goes downstairs.  When he enters the kitchen, Sherlock is already there, staring at his tea mug, appearing as though he has been waiting the whole time.
John puts his palm to the wall for balance, then pushes himself up and climbs the stairs after Sherlock.
Sherlock winks, and can’t believe he’s done it.  Then he leaves the room and then he nearly trips over himself heading toward the elevator.  Once the elevator doors close he lets out a shaky breath.  Sherlock is annoying himself.  The stumbling, the shaky breath, the sigh he lets out.  It’s all so…plebian.  Pathetic.  He hasn’t felt this way in ages.  Somewhere his brain brings Victor Trevor out from its deepest depths.  That was university, that was a decade ago of nervous kissing and wandering hands, a time so long ago he almost forgot, or chose to forget.  And he’s met this man three minutes ago.
“Janine?” John asks.  He’s sure he can’t mask the shock on his face.  Or the hurt.  His heart is pounding and it shouldn’t be.
And Sherlock is done with words then, as they are all failing him.  He can’t seem to understand anything, so as always, he looks to John to know what to do.  The problem is, John doesn’t seem to know what to do either.  He is staring at Sherlock so intently it’s almost frightening but, it’s what Sherlock has always wanted, really.  John slides a hand up to cup Sherlock’s face.
“Alright,” John says.  At least he knows now he isn’t barking up the wrong tree entirely.  “Do you have a boyfriend then?” He continues.  “Which is fine.”
Sherlock sits at the window sill, one foot placed on the ledge, his right elbow thrown over his knee.  He is looking out at nighttime London.  John knows he loves it very much.
When they arrive, John tries to avoid Mary for as long as possible, as ridiculous as he knows it is.  When he first meets her gaze, he gives her a stiff smile and then heads back round to the kitchen, where Mrs. Holmes hands him a glass of punch he immediately leaves on the counter.
Sherlock feels terrified, so while John falls asleep, he grabs trousers and shirt and goes out to the small patio outside, cigarettes in hand.
because he can’t put that into past tense without lying, and he doesn’t want to say the words out loud to her, they don’t belong here, in Their Bed.
“Yeah. It wasn’t just the drinking though. I know what you’re thinking. It was other things too.” She takes a drag and shakes her head.
John kisses the side of Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock feels his heart flutter.  John moves to pull away but Sherlock keeps him there, putting a hand around the back of his neck.
Sherlock does as he’s told for once and limps up the stairs with John following closely behind.  He gets into the bathroom and takes off his trousers, then sits on the edge of the tub.  He feels over exposed but he lets John come in with the emergency kit.
It lasts all of five seconds before Sherlock pulls away to push his nose into John’s and sigh shakily.
“Well, seems it could be dangerous. Are you uhm, worried about that at all?” John said, turning to Sherlock. Sherlock leaned back against the sofa and grinned, a mischievous glint coming to his eye that was absolutely endearing.
“God, yes,” Sherlock groans, putting his head in his hands. “And a painkiller if you’ve got it. My head is pounding.” John laughs at that and heads to the kitchen. He brings back Sherlock a small pill bottle and a glass of water. Sherlock nods in thanks.
“Did you love him though?  Sherlock, I mean,” Harry says.  The fact that she has to differentiate between Ellis and Sherlock makes John want to cry.  They were not alike and John had been so different.
“Today has been perfect,” Sherlock replies. His eyes are lidded, sleepy and lovely. They had showered and slowly gotten over their hangovers with toast and dumplings. After Sherlock had started going through all of the things in his bedroom, sorting, and throwing away. Then he had plopped down next to John on the sofa and had not left his side for hours as John flipped through the novel he was reading. They didn’t talk. John didn’t think Sherlock was ready to. “Thank you John.”
"He was really, very gorgeous.  He looked a bit like you.  He had terrible eyesight and was a little clumsy but he was very smart and I don't think I ever met anyone who didn't like him.  He forced me to enjoy life because I didn't know how to do it myself.  He very fairly wanted things of me I couldn't give.  Because I was too afraid.  Because I watched my sister vomit red wine all over our bathroom when she was fifteen because our parents found out she had a girlfriend.  Because I was far too worried about what people would think of me.  I ran away.  I went and joined the military and I got deployed and I didn't even tell him I was going to do it.  I didn't even have the decency to tell him I loved him."
John comes round the next day.  He calls Sherlock “Mister Holmes” and it’s too strange.  Lestrade finally pulls through and gives Sherlock a new murder.  It’s the third in a set and the best part is that Sherlock can see that John is intrigued.  And John follows, which makes him ten times more interesting than Sherlock had originally thought.
“It was so nice to see you. Can’t believe it’s you in fact,” Sherlock said, and John laughed as he let go of Sherlock’s hand, wanting nothing more than to stay just a little longer.
Sherlock brings a hand down away from John’s face and hesitantly lets it drop down John’s t-shirt, and then under, touching John’s bare stomach.  It continues, his hand snaking up John’s chest, brushing his hand over John’s chest until his hand is directly over John’s hammering heart.  Sherlock leaves his hand there and rubs his nose into John’s.
He wonders how much Sherlock has changed. There’s a hesitance lingering about him that was never there before. It’s a little scary and a little sweet. Everything John thinks to do to ease the tension ends up seeming trite. Offer him tea? Take his coat? None of it is correct. Not by a long shot. Finally, after looking out the window then looking at
They make it back to the flat and up the stairs and John closes the door behind them as he brushes his jacket off.  Sherlock has sobered up a bit from the walk, but not much. John is rummaging around in the kitchen and he comes back with a bottle of fifty year old scotch that Sherlock had stolen from Mycroft and two glasses.
Sherlock turns his head and sees John in the doorframe, in just a white t-shirt and pants, on his way into the bathroom.
Moran scratches his face, makes it even bleed a little.  Moran pulls at his hair, but the pain is meaningless.
“Pardon, you think you deserve the last slice of birthday cake?” Greg asked, leaning back in his chair.
It’s been awkward between them sometimes.  There is something too heavy and tone deaf hiding in the spaces between them.
They dress enough so that if Mrs. Hudson comes up she won’t run out screaming and then crowd together in the bathroom.  They each grab their toothbrushes and John’s mouth is filled with mint foam as he speaks.
“I’m in love with you,” Sherlock says quietly.  His breath shakes, and his hands have made fists, clenching and unclenching.  “I didn’t mean to, it just sort of happened. Sorry.”
“I’m not sorry,” John says earnestly, and there is something burning in his eyes that tells Sherlock that he should listen.
“John, where are you going?” Sherlock asks.  John turns.  Sherlock is pale, his face crinkled with worry.
The worst part was, some part of Sherlock had always known, it had just taken John getting married and a murder about to take place for him to figure it out.  Sherlock had assumed that it had simply been some type of thankful-for-John-Watson feeling.  Friendship, perhaps?  Was that what it was?  Friendship involved wanting to spend every moment of your life with a person, right?  Friendship meant willing to do anything for a person, right?  Friendship meant wanting to touch that person, wasn’t that right?
“Ah yes, you there in the brown jacket,” the mediator said, pointing towards John, and John couldn’t believe his luck.
They finally make it into the kitchen. John makes coffee while Sherlock watches, still in his wrinkled button up from the day before. He looks rough, rough like John feels. They bicker a little about how much milk to put into the coffee and as Sherlock is about to make another overly-dramatic point Mrs. Hudson walks in with a tea tray in her hands. She sees Sherlock and immediately drops the entire thing onto the wood floor. John sighs and Sherlock bites his bottom lip as he cringes.
For the first time in ages, John actually feels useful, despite having to drag his leg across the hardwood floor.  And, until Sherlock leaves him stranded and he has to hail a cab.  But, still.  He can’t even bring himself to be mad.  Sherlock is quick, and rude, and nearly intolerably crass.  But John sees there a reflection of himself.  John doesn’t like people, never has, and that doesn’t seem subject to change.  Sherlock is a lot, but he’s enjoying it.
And so began his string of very unfortunate dates. Greg and Molly would host these small gatherings, and John was always very glad that they were both there to take reign of the conversations. John met Sarah, Jeannette, Mary, Margaret, Lizzy, and Charles all within the span of two weeks. Charles was the only one who seemed to fit. He kissed John on the cheek at the door and said “I hope to see you again.” John nodded and shut the door to Greg and Molly’s flat. He then walked back to the living room to see Greg and Molly waiting for him, each with a drink in hand.
“Do you ever eat a full meal?  I’ve known you over a week and you haven’t died yet but it seems strange, yeah?
“I believe I left a pack of cigarettes in your bathroom,” Sherlock said, mouth pulling up into a grin.
Molly is standing over a body, taking notes in her dainty, flowery scroll.  Sherlock likes her, despite how he acts.  She’s genuine, and smart, and too kind for her own good.  Sherlock knows he doesn’t deserve her affections, however misplaced they may be.
“No. I didn’t even think he was the sort to want a girlfriend!” A jealous rage came over John at the memory of Janine kissing Sherlock in front of him and he wanted to bend his fork in half. “Did you all know?” he demanded then, looking around the table. No one would look him in the eye, and Harry bit her lower lip. “Christ,” John said, putting his head in his hands. “My life is in shambles because I wasn’t caught up with the Daily Mail.”
Mrs. Hudson looked so impossibly excited that John just shook his head, deciding against telling her at the last moment.
“Why not?” Sherlock looks earnestly baffled, like he hadn’t noticed that John hadn’t even been on a date the last four months they knew each other.
“I need things to be stable before I do anything.  Everyone at work thinks my wife is dead.  She didn’t exist in the first place.  I don’t know what’s real anymore.  I can’t tell.”
“I don’t know. I don’t think I deserve anything particularly.  I would love to have you and not worry and believe that it was going to be fine.  But I know me and I’ve never been very good at this.  I’ve hardly attempted it really.  All I know is, I want to be better for you.  I want to be better because of you.”
John tried not to read the news or look closely when Sherlock was mentioned on television. He knew that Sherlock was safe and still solving crimes. He had apparently been working on helping Lestrade catch a string of bank robberies. Lestrade told John that Sherlock seemed fine, though he had become harsher with people around the Yard. “I think he feels he has to be totally serious and as cold as possible. He doesn’t want anyone to think he’s not capable of doing his job,” Lestrade had said. John had only nodded, the idea of the gentle man he had known briefly coming off as only cold and calculating made John very sad.
Molly turned to Sherlock then, and John realized he really should have warned her. Molly knew all about Sherlock from Greg’s own stories as well as the news. At least Greg had worked with him on several occasions now. Molly was having a mild stroke upon realizing the detective was in her home.
Charles Augustus Magnussen is one of the foulest creatures that John has ever had to meet.  Possibly worse than Moriarty.  Moriarty had been an evil that was chaotic, and simply did not care what was left behind.  Magnussen was far more personal.  Though Moriarty had been personal with John, he hadn’t been with everyone he terrorized.  He hadn’t wanted power.  He’d just wanted destruction.
“You let me in,” Sherlock replies, his voice hitching just a little, a giveaway to his slowly growing panic.
John only wanted to vomit a small amount. Ever since the great detective Sherlock Holmes had risen to fame, Harriett had talked of little else. "Isn't he so handsome?" she would say when the man appeared on the news. "Those cheekbones, the hair!"  "You're a lesbian Harry," John would remind her. "I'm a lesbian, not blind," she would say back, and John would bite his tongue. Harry loved pop culture. Ever since she had come home from AA she had had to find something to throw herself into, and celebrities had been her means of survival. It had been annoying at first, and John couldn't follow half of what she was talking about, but it was much better than Harry's previous, non-sober state.
He remembers: Sherlock’s open palm on his face, calming, soft, warm.  Beautiful.  Sherlock looking down at him intensely, sitting on the twin bed, in his pajama shirt, white and thin.
“No, not this time,” Sherlock says.  He laughs a little, and now it’s scary because Sherlock Holmes is on his knees, and he’s begged for forgiveness.  He’s begged for mercy twice.
Evan moved across the room to John’s corner, put a hand on his cheek. He bent down but. But. John moved away. He didn’t know what was happening, but he wouldn’t do that. Not to her.
John showers, and he picks the outfit he wore the night of the pool, when they agreed to die together.  The color is bright and warm.  He looks in the mirror and realizes he looks good.
“Now,” John said, trying to regain his dignity, “What is so special about this garden that all of that was worth it?”
“For God’s sake. They found me. And they got a photo of you dressed like that.” John looked down. He was in a shirt and pants but nothing else. He nodded. “And a photo of me dressed like this. In your clothes.” Again, John nodded. “I’ve got to call my brother,” Sherlock said, and pushed past John.
“What are you his bodyguard or something?” one of the men asked, and John counted down from ten in his head.
“Did you love him?” This time it is a deliberate whisper.  It wasn’t the question he expected, but then it’s the question he’s been waiting for all along.
John went inside the hotel and used the bathroom. He looked in the mirror, and straightened his shirt, and then ran a hand through his hair. He looked fairly good. He took the elevator up to Sherlock’s room and then knocked, the butterflies in his stomach running rampant.
“You started this, not me.  You finish it.  This is your decision.  She’s your wife.  You came to me, this is on you.”
“I seem to recall toast this morning,” Sherlock replies, not bothering to glance up from his microscope.
The traffic on the way to the Savoy was terrible. Greg was stuck at a light about ten blocks from the venue, and John worried that he would miss the entire thing. He had no idea when it had started, and Sherlock was going to leave for Russia in a matter of hours.
“I may have told a few people at my last club meeting.” Phillip was of course referencing his club that swapped crime stories and conspiracy theories. Normally it was a harmless group of nerds getting overly excited about homicides over a few pints. This time it had cost John everything.
John can’t believe his thoughts, but then again, of course they were of how in love with Sherlock he is.  And he’s engaged.  It’s awful.  He hates himself but it can’t be helped.
“My God, you’re an idiot.  It’s all I’ve been thinking of for weeks,” Sherlock says and John can’t help the groan that comes out.
Sherlock slung his coat over his arm and then sat down on John’s sofa. He looked as though he were trying desperately to curl into himself. John thought Sherlock should never look this way, so small and tired.
“Of course you should be.  And like I said.  Most people are boring.  You’re not.  You’re fascinating.”
“You’re shaking,” Sherlock says.  He takes the wool blanket off the back of the lounging chair, the one that Mary had picked out, and throws it over John.
“Sherlock darling, c’mere,” Janine said, and put her arms around Sherlock’s neck. She then kissed him hard and hummed into the kiss. John held the dirty plates in his hands, unable to feel anything but a dark embarrassment. Then she asked, “Sherlock what are you going to order?”
John looked up from his textbook, lungs and ribcages suddenly seeming much less important.  Ellis hadn’t even framed it like a question.  Just a fact of life, like the sky being blue and the grass being green and John Watson being in love with another man.
By the time Sherlock finds him, John is more than a little drunk.  He leans his forearms against the bar, trying to get his bearings.
Sherlock leaves the hospital and doesn’t tell anyone why.  John suspects he’s trying to track the shooter but why would he do so without him?
“Shocked I was able to fall asleep myself,” John says quietly, taking a seat in the chair opposite Sherlock.  The stars are still bright, and Sherlock has to admit it’s beautiful.
The second floor has 217 rooms.  This is the amount of eyelashes John has on the upper lid of his right eye.  Redbeard is on this floor, and so is Moriarty.  He has to keep them somewhere, after all.  This floor often floods, and after it is cleaned out smells like John’s shampoo.
When they got back to Evan’s room, Evan turned the key into the lock and nearly fell onto the floor as he pushed the door open. John laughed loudly, and Evan shushed him.
"Sherlock, I'm never leaving you.  I've been without you far too many times.  So long as you want me I'm not leaving."
“Life has never been fair, but, I do think this has been the cruelest trick the universe has played on me thus far.”  John finishes his cigarette, puts it out, is no longer sure what to do with his hands so he reaches for his wine glass.  “See, you, Harry,” John continues, “you just cocked it up.  I do wish that you would just fix it because you can and you love her, so, I think…I think you should fix it.  Since it is in the realm of possibility.  And the funniest thing is, I did try a few times.  I mean I really tried to see if he could want me.  But the timing was always so off and I didn’t want to throw all of it away so it just…became…stagnant.  I used to think I was content just watching him breathe.  When he slept, he was beautiful.  I’m sorry, I don’t know what I’m saying,” John says.
And Janine was beautiful.  She was funny and on the days that John had spent time with her with Mary, she’d been charming, though a bit much at times, but that was more John’s own problem than Janine herself.
They eat in a relatively comfortable silence.  In the moment, John is content.  He wonders what would happen if he tried to relive their first time in this restaurant.
“No. I only arrived in London three hours ago. I went to see my brother. To get myself back in order. Then…here I am.” John nods, and Sherlock continues. “He was very angry with me when he realized I’d been in contact with you. Actually don’t know that he’s ever been so angry with me. Anyway…no, Mrs. Hudson doesn’t know.”
Then, later, Sherlock saves Sholto’s life which is far too much for John.  Just seeing them both in the same room made him feel strange yet content.
John smiled in spite of himself and nodded. Sherlock was handsome, looking so ordinary with just a t-shirt on, a stark difference to the swish of the Belstaff and designer silk.
As Irene reads her texts, the ones John has wondered about for months, he feels his stomach turn inside out.  The messages are not explicit love notes.  They are somehow worse than that.  Simple, short, yet she tells him what is on her mind.  She is not troubled by the thought of his rejection.  She showed him her body the first time they met.  She was taken to him.  Who wouldn’t be?
John hears Sherlock coming up the stairs before he sees him.  Sherlock takes off and hangs up his coat in a painfully slow manner.
“I have. It’s just that I’m not very good at this sort of thing. I never have been. And I don’t want this to end badly.”
John had no response to Sherlock. He only felt a quiet panic rising within him. John felt so in love he was dizzy, but he made no reply. He only nodded at Sherlock, knowing that he couldn’t be wrong about his decision. Sherlock was famous, and a genius. John would never be able to measure up.
John wants to take Sherlock’s hand in his own and kiss the knuckles, but instead he digs his fingers into the fabric of the sofa.
John can’t believe he went to meet with his therapist.  As if that would have helped.  He pours himself scotch, sits barefoot in his chair and watches Sherlock’s chair opposite him.  He wants to burn it.  It mocks him, existing there, empty.  Mycroft has planned a funeral.  John is sure it will be hateful.  He is sure Sherlock would hate it.  It is in three days and the idea of attending makes him want to die, not attending makes him want to die.
“What’s going on?” Mary asks quietly, but she isn’t slow, and she knows what he Had Looked Like, and she starts to whisper “Oh my god,” very softly.  Then, as John’s entire body sort of recoils, “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”
Sherlock thinks he may be underwater.  Perhaps they are back at the pool, and the bomb has gone off, and they have been blasted into the chlorine stench.  Perhaps they are swimming towards each other.  Perhaps they are finally taking their last gulps of air into their lungs together.  The world would have been a much quieter place if it had all ended this way instead.
They go to Angelo’s and it briefly reminds John of the first day they met.  Sherlock looks so different now.  Perhaps it is because John knows him now, but it’s also definitely because of the way Sherlock has aged in the last five years.  It’s been a rapid aging for the both of them.
He feels wild with this, for lack of a better phrase, life change. He feels Sherlock’s tongue drag along his bottom lip, and then John fully realizes what is happening to him. John pulls back the smallest amount, to let them both breathe.
John takes the bow out of his closet.  He never gave it to Sherlock because it had seemed too intimate but now he doesn’t care much.  He wants him to have it.  It’s still wrapped.
“You’re right, he is dead.  She used this as a distraction.  She used it as a means of escape.  I don’t know where she is, but she’s gone.”
“John, how has the clinic been?” Mrs. Hudson asks as she scrubs the counters with a little green sponge. John folds up the newspaper he’s reading and places it on the kitchen table. He folds his hands in his lap and gives her a tight smile.
“Hello,” John said, walking up to the men. “I sorely wish I hadn’t heard your conversation, but unfortunately I did. And I’d just like to say, don’t you think that the man you’re talking about is a real person, and probably deserves a bit more respect than what you nobodies are giving him?”
It’s a Tuesday when Sherlock comes out of the bathroom, freshly showered and wearing a purple shirt, the buttons not done all the way up yet.
Sherlock just nods in agreement.  He gets up off his knees.  The man tries to kiss him before he leaves.  He feels nauseous but lets it happen.  He leaves as quickly and as quietly as possible.
She hands him her past in the palm of her hand.  It’s a USB.  It’s supposed to tell John who she really is.
Harry rummaged through her purse, then pulled out a cellphone.  “Here,” Harry said, “I know you don’t have one yet, and I want to keep in touch little brother.”
Finally, he goes to Sherlock’s bedroom. It’s hard to be in here. It smells like Sherlock. John goes to fling open Sherlock’s dresser drawer but then stops, suddenly hesitant. It feels too personal. But he forges ahead. He needs to. Seeing Sherlock again depends on it. He opens the drawers. Sherlock’s sock index stares back at John. John pushes the socks away and finds nothing. The next drawer is starch white t-shirts and things he used to wear to bed. The third drawer is more of the same but there’s no notes. No secret messages. Of course.
John stares at Irene Adler, and the way she makes eyes at Sherlock, and his stomach turns over.  He quickly learns that she is smart, and cunning, and somewhat impish.  She leaves out a window in nothing but Sherlock’s coat.
“You’re so much, I can’t believe my luck.  You know, when I saw you at Bart’s I already knew I was in trouble.”  John laughs at himself, then puts Sherlock’s face in both of his hands and kisses him once more. “I mean I’m utterly fucked.  I don’t want to scare you off.”
Sherlock stands up, doesn’t turn around when he says “Goodnight, John,” and retreats into his bedroom.
He realizes he’s in the middle of the sidewalk and turns himself around until he finds an empty alley.  He wasn’t built for this. It wasn’t that he hadn’t thought himself capable.  It was that he hadn’t thought himself fit.  He’s so far past logic that it takes him a full fifteen minutes to calm himself down.  He doesn’t even have any cigarettes.  He remembers the case.  He remembers that John is waiting for him at Bart’s.  He can pretend he’s okay if it comes down to it.
“Harry, want to go outside?” John asked. Tree climbing was one of his favourite activities, the New Romantics were not precisely stimulating for the seven year old.
Sherlock thinks that maybe if he could get John out of London for a while, get him away from memories of Mary, of a life he never had, then maybe John would get some peace and his eyes wouldn’t look wrong and maybe he’d look at Sherlock again, really look.  Because he still won’t look him in the eye.  He won’t sit as close on the sofa, he won’t absent mindedly brush his fingers against Sherlock’s while handing him tea and Sherlock knows it must be because John hates him and he’s sad.
Sherlock falls into a heap and down into his chair. His coat makes for a pile of cloth around his waist, bundled up around the armrests. He doesn’t take his eyes off of John. Sherlock audibly gulps.
John takes a drink for every time he had hidden his love away.  He takes one last long drag on the bottle before he can’t remember anything else, one last drag for what he’s doing currently.
Ellis punched him.  It hurt.  John supposed a lot of things would hurt in the coming months.  John punched him back.  They ended up kissing more than anything else and John finally let his fists fall down, and the cold feeling in his gut continued to get larger.
Sherlock doesn’t know what to expect.  After Sherlock shot Magnussen he had barely spoken to John.  He hadn’t been able to.  He had needed Mary to believe that Sherlock hadn’t a clue she was working for Moriarty, and that meant keeping John in the dark.
If John doesn’t know now, it isn’t possible he ever will understand.  There is a dead man lying between John and Sherlock and although there have been others that Sherlock has killed for John, this one is the only one he will ever know of.  This one means willingly sacrificing a lifetime of freedom.
John sits next to him on the floor.  Their knees touch and Sherlock feels like he’s going to need to swallow all his organs back down.
Hours later, with self-sewn stitches itching his calf, he goes out to a bar, gets a little drunk, and finds a man who looks a little like John and who could never come close.
John never asks to read them, perhaps doesn’t want to know what she’s saying.  Sherlock never replies, and John doesn’t know what that’s supposed to mean, coming from Sherlock.
John begins to worry. It’s been nine months and he still has no idea when Sherlock is coming back. He doesn’t even know that Sherlock feels for him what he feels. Before Sherlock left, John had given up on dating. But that was when Sherlock was around. Now, with Sherlock gone, it sort of feels silly.
“I know so much has probably changed while I’ve been gone,” Sherlock says. He taps on his wine glass. His cigarette is burning to the filter in the ashtray Sherlock stole two years ago. “I know I shouldn’t expect to be able to just walk back in here. And have you be okay with it,” Sherlock cocks one eyebrow. “I’d like to, but that’s not realistic.”
The idea of Sherlock having to come get him because he’s gotten too drunk is embarrassing.  John orders another pint and doesn’t reply.
His father had been sitting on a lawn chair and had looked up from his book and glass of red wine and smiled at John as he walked towards him.
And then they meet in the middle.  John groans into Sherlock’s mouth and Sherlock gasps.  He runs his hands through John’s hair and truly, utterly, can’t believe his luck.
Sherlock is standing at the counter, tea into a teacup.  Breakfast has already been laid out for him.  He knows Sherlock cooked it himself because although he feigns helplessness he can make a fine omelette.
John walked out of Sherlock’s hotel room, still holding the dishes. He left them at the front desk, to the receptionist’s surprise, and then walked out of the Ritz. He stopped just outside the door, remembering Sherlock’s face as he’d asked John if he wanted to come up. Sherlock’s face had been so admiring, so lovely, his eyes and mouth gone all soft with his want. John ran a hand down his face and then walked away from the Ritz, back to his flat, and collapsed into bed, trying not to think of Sherlock Holmes.
“Who would want me for a flat mate?” Sherlock says.  Stamford is kind enough to smile at Sherlock and shake his head.
“Just tell him,” Moriarty pleads.  Over and over.  It doesn’t matter really, how much he wants to beg.
John stares at the notecard. It’s yellowing around the edges. John inhales sharply. This has to be from a month ago. This can’t be a coincidence. The first one John had believed regardless, but now he’s really sure. He realizes his heart is pounding. April sixteenth is a week from today. He might never have found this note. He wonders how many others might be around the house. The notecard falls from John’s fingers and he turns quickly and his eyes dart around the flat. He lunges at the desk and opens it. Nothing. Only the usual. Paper clips and staples and Bic pens Sherlock has chewed on. He leaves the desk and goes back to the bookshelf. He pulls every book off of the shelf after shaking each one thoroughly. Nothing. The books are scattered across the rug.
So, yes.  John is shaving after almost a full year.  Because apparently Mary and the rest of the universe hates his mustache.  And Sherlock.  Who isn’t dead.  He Is Not shaving for Sherlock though.  Not one bit.
John puts both hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, and then lets his mouth slide into Sherlock’s.  He breathes deeply and God, he’s trying so hard to keep himself composed.
Sherlock takes the steps down the plane two at a time.  He doesn’t stop walking until he’s directly in front of John, and beaming at him like he’s the sun.  John smiles back.  They must look ridiculous.
John knows she’s in a great deal of pain, but won’t say.  And he won’t ask because he isn’t very good at talking about these types of things.  He looks again at the phone, and the engraving.  What a fucking waste.
, for God’s sake. There’s no messing this up.  He never thought he would get this much less have it and know what to do with it.  He takes another drag,
was alive, out there somewhere, saving the world, and he hadn’t taken John with him. The utter bastard. Why hadn’t he taken John with him? Did he not think John was enough? Had he just wanted to be alone? But then, why would he leave the note?
“Listen. Less than a year ago my life was completely different. I used to be a bloody army doctor. I was being useful, saving lives and fighting and I will tell you now that I loved being there. I loved the war. I still miss it. But then I went and got shot, and I couldn’t be a surgeon and now I run a book shop which is absolutely ridiculous. What I’m saying is, in the scheme of things, nobody will care. Nobody will care about any of this in a week. The gossip will just be gossip. Even if Moriarty finds me, that doesn’t mean I’ll die. You can’t know that. So please, Sherlock, don’t go.”
“Ah well, that would have been exciting though,” she said, smoothing out her skirt. Then she walked to the back of the shop to start sorting through the newly arrived books, the sound of her kitten heels a welcome comfort to John’s ears.
“What makes this so much different than any other case we were on together? It’s always dangerous,” John insists.
“Yes,” Sherlock replies, and realizes he’s smiling into his pasta.  This is preposterous, he’s acting like a teenager.   He finds he doesn’t even mind.
John looks up again.  Today it is coffee, not tea.  He looks up at Sherlock and the leaves are almost the same color but quite.  John shaved.  He’s wearing the navy button up.
Sherlock would laugh, if he could.  If he had the ability to do anything besides suck in air like a dying man and stare at John Watson.
“I’m not sure,” John says.  He’s wary of himself, not willing to mess this up.  If he still feels so damn sad, how can he move on?
Sweet, sweet Molly, whom Sherlock had no idea what to do with.   She clearly fancied him from the get go and he wasn’t sure how to get around it.  He’d tried just about everything.  He’d been overly sweet to see if that would throw her, which it didn’t, it only excited her.  He’d tried being completely rude but then she’d just sort of gone with it, though he couldn’t understand why.  He’d even tried upping how overtly gay he was, gesturing in more feminine ways, raising the tone of his voice, giggling.  She’d clearly not gotten it, which was truly incredible given that he’d thought he was fairly obvious to begin with.  Now, he has settled finally for pretending to not understand her advances.  It seemed the least cruel way to go about it and it wasn’t as if he was
"You have nothing to be embarrassed about.  But okay.  I have to ask.  Have you really loved me for so long?"
“Yep!” John lied, refusing to waste any more time. John went into his pockets and pulled out one of Lestrade’s badges. He had taken it weeks ago, remember how Sherlock had said he had taken some of Lestrade’s badges when he wasn’t looking. He flashed it the receptionist and he was immediately pointed to the direction of the conference.
“But I want to,” she says and smiles wide.  John is actually starting to look annoyed and that just isn’t correct.
“So who was it, a decade ago?  If you don’t mind me asking,” John says.  He says it quietly and carefully, seeing if anything is overstepping.  It isn’t.  John could ask anything and Sherlock would answer.
During the first raid, John saved three lives, and lost one.  With blood up to his elbows and a corpse on his operating table, John walked out of the tent and into the showers, turned on the water as cold as it would go, and sat down encased in tile with his entire uniform still on.  Major Sholto had burst through the shower doors, much to John’s dismay, and had dragged him up by his wrists and had slapped him across the face.  Not very hard, but hard enough.
Sherlock stared back at John, John’s lips pressed together hard, breathing heavily. Sherlock couldn’t move.  John then leaned down and pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s, hard.  Sherlock whimpered into him, and his violin clattered to the ground.  Sherlock nearly wrapped his fingers around John’s neck, nearly tore his nails into John’s back, but stopped himself.
John falls asleep again, or not again, he’s not sure, against Sherlock’s side.  It is warm and steady unlike everything else.
Over the last few weeks, they do many of the same things.  They get takeaway and eat it on the sofa with all the lights off, only the telly emitting light.  They also put the takeaway down and Sherlock ends up curled into John like a cat.
“Sherlock, that is really not fair,” John said, his own anger beginning to grow. Did Sherlock really think so little of him?
She does look sad when he walks past her.  Their shoulders brush momentarily.  So informal for someone so intimate.  He follows Sherlock out the door.  He does not look back at her.
And the image does become reality.  They are sitting at a picnic table, early morning.  John hasn’t shaved in three days and doesn’t seem to notice.  He has tea, not coffee in his mug and the sun is out, the breeze blowing through his hair gently.  He looks healthy, and Sherlock can almost swear he sees the smallest smile forming on John’s mouth.  His hand is moving quickly over the page, his writing coming out with intent.  He was using his favorite pen.  He’s wearing a forest green sweater and it’s new, at least new to Sherlock.  For the first time he isn’t concerned about whether Mary bought it or not.  The leaves behind him are red, some yellow.  The table shakes just a little with the steady movement of John’s hand against his notebook.  He’s completely gone to the rest of the world.  Sherlock can’t help but stare.  It doesn’t matter, he’s been watching John for his entire life.
He’s slept through his hangover.  He can tell because he’s only slightly groggy.  His head doesn’t pound, and his body doesn’t ache.
“I can’t live like this anymore,” John says out loud to the dripping sink, the beige slippers, the dust on the mantel.
The extremity of this knowledge all came to him while waiting for his coffee staring at a trash bin.  The desire to never leave John’s side enveloped him quietly.  Fine then.
“Well wait, what about me,” Sherlock said, taking a drag off his cigarette. Everyone was silent, unable to fathom what Sherlock would come up with.
Mycroft stood up from John’s desk, picked up his umbrella, and walked out of the shop. John sat in the office for a few minutes, trying to compose himself. He was going to see Sherlock again.
Despite the slip of paper, Baker Street still feels empty. It feels like it can’t be true. John thinks about showing the note to Mycroft, but then he thinks about what
"No.  You aren't the first," John says.  He knows this probably disappoints Sherlock in a way, who is already terrified.
“Well of course,” John says, then gives Sherlock a small smile, quickly covered by his own glass of scotch.  “Cheers.”
“Ready to talk about it?”  John asks as gently as he can.  He feels over exposed, and he isn’t even the one to make the confession.
John wonders where his gun is.  He realizes quickly that he must have alcohol poisoning.  His shirt is covered in vomit, and he’s sweating.  He feels cold.
“John dear, so sorry to bother you, but you have a delivery up front,” Mrs. Hudson said from the office door.
“Good night,” John says, and then turns away from her, and heads home. He doesn’t look back. He feels so guilty for so many things.
“Can you please finish?” Sherlock asks, and his voice is so quiet that John doesn’t ask any more questions.
They’re opening their second bottle of red wine. Sherlock is flush in his cheeks, laughing. He’s also been smoking a lot of cigarettes out the open window but John is too happy he’s here at all to lecture him. In the morning, when things settle John will start in on him about the smoking.
And John understands that this Magnussen case is extremely dangerous.  Possibly the most dangerous that Sherlock has worked.
After an hour, he vomits the little food he has in his stomach into the toilet.  He adds the contents of the syringe and flushes it all down.  John would only hate him more.
“Sherlock, run!” John says, throwing his arms around Moriarty.  He doesn’t really mind dying here anyway.  He’d rather Sherlock get out at least, and he’s only happy to help him get out.  He knows exactly why too.
“Blokes don’t always catch on when I’m hitting on them,” John replies, and keeps eye contact with Sherlock the entire time.  Sherlock scoffs and feels himself blush again.  He tries to think of something intelligent to say back but he can’t.  He feels ridiculous, a grown man unable to get his mind together enough to flirt back.  He feels like he’s a teenager again.  His brain has gone all fuzzy with
Sherlock does what he thought he’d never do.  He pushes John away gently.  John’s face falls and turns into something akin to horror.
“The door has been locked, Mrs. Hudson is going to wonder if I’m okay,” John says as he flips the lock over. He’d locked it per Sherlock’s request.
John sits up with his glass of scotch, and wonders if he should still give Sherlock the Christmas present.
“No,” John said. “I didn’t think you would be like…anything. You’re not just someone’s fantasy Sherlock. You’re more brilliant now than you’ve ever been.”
, John thinks.  Those who are dead, those who do not exist.  He thinks of Tessa, the nurse.  People fall in love with ghosts all the time.
“It’s so funny you’re here.  You really will be dead soon,” the one with red hair had said, grinning and showing the large gap between his two front teeth.
And then he does laugh.  He can’t help it.  He closes his eyes and laughs harder than he can remember until he’s crying too.  It’s a mess, all of it, but Sherlock has always been a mess.  He’s aware that John is watching him, waiting for him to become coherent again.
“You know, when I was a kid, I had a crush on Bond,” John says, glancing at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye.  John smiles at the admission.  Besides Harry, and besides the lie that is Mary Morstan, no one else has ever known that he likes men as well as women.  Even this small thing seems so large.
It hadn’t been easy when John had woken up one morning to find Sherlock leaning against the shower, unresponsive for over an hour, the PTSD coming back to life.
It took him a moment.  A breath or two.  But there was plenty of time in Sherlock’s head.  He had thought about it too much.  No, best not to say it.  Why should he say it?  So that John could know and then never see him again?  Wouldn’t that just pain him more?  No.  Best not to say it.  “Sherlock is actually a girl’s name.”
John wishes he could say yes, we are, in some small way, perhaps.  But not that way.  He wouldn’t want me that way.  He may not want anyone that way.  He doesn’t feel things that way.  He feels, so much.  But, not that way.
to himself. He grasped the fence and then flung himself to the top, slowly maneuvered himself over, and landed in the grass, only cursing a few times on the way over.
“I didn’t DO anything, you’re the git!” John said sternly back, his eyes never leaving hers for a moment, those stupid muddy brown eyes. Susie’s curls were falling into his mouth, and John moved his hands to get her hair out of his face when he suddenly felt the softness of it, and stopped moving his fingers. John stared up at Susie, who had the oddest look on her face.
When Mary asks what happened, John says “He did it for us, to keep you safe.”  He isn’t sure what else he can say.
“Okay John, this is me, remedying my mistake,” Phillip said from the back, then climbed over Harry’s lap and out of the car. He walked directly into London traffic, and began directing cars. John started to laugh, not really believing that Phillip was in the middle of the road, nearly getting hit every ten seconds because he was trying to help John. Phillip put a halt to traffic, then gestured for Greg to hit the gas. Greg didn’t waste a second and took off. John stuck his head out the window, and waved out to his flatmate.
He sucks the man off in the French man’s tiny flat and thrusts into his own fist, pretending he’s with John.  It doesn’t even come close.  John doesn’t speak French and the man keeps mumbling filthy things.  Sherlock wishes he’d keep his damn mouth shut.  After the man comes, Sherlock follows shortly after, John’s name falling out of his mouth before he can stop it.
“Of course. Well. In that case. I’ll show you out. But also, you’re extraordinary.” John felt his face go hot, and he shook his head, laughing at himself a little. “Sorry, it’s just that I figure this is my one chance to say it and you should hear it.”
A month and a half later, walking under another dreary London sky, he hears the three words he really doesn’t want to hear coming out of anyone’s mouth.
“Phillip wouldn’t do that,” John said, placing his hands on his hips. “Please, let’s just think about this.”
“Yes, in fact I did. Recall how you didn’t realize Sherlock Holmes was in your home a few days ago? Yeah, well now I need my wallet because I’m somehow going on a second date with him and as you can imagine, I would love it if it went really well.”
Sherlock let himself go.  The hot tears sprang up.  He threw a beaker at the wall.  If John heard the glass break he didn’t acknowledge it.
They’ve been going on dates at least once a week. Sometimes when Mary is off, she’ll get lunch with John on his breaks, and she’ll laugh into her coffee, the cup stained with pink lip marks.  She’s been kissing him on his jawline, and he’s been sighing into it, growing used to it.
“Well, where’s the fun if there hasn’t been a murder?” John finishes off his beer and then gestures to the bartender.  “Shots,” he says.
Instead, Sherlock slammed his fist into the chair. His mouth however, could not behave so nicely.  Sherlock bit down on John’s bottom lip, wanting to bleed him dry.
They both laugh a little.  John shakes his head as he stares down at the signature.  Sherlock is an impossible man.
“Indefinitely,” Sherlock said into his microphone, all the while keeping eye contact with John. John laughed, couldn’t help himself. He was so in love he thought he might die from happiness.
“Hush,” John says, “You’re telling me you’ve really broken your nose that many times?  What am I saying of course you have, I’m sure you’ve been punched in the face plenty.”
“And here I thought I was obvious,” John whispers.  A breeze hits Sherlock and he shivers.  He’s afraid to hope but his heart is pounding anyway.
“I missed you! He missed you! You lied…” And then she turns to John. “Did you know he was alive this whole time?!” She demands. John rolls back on his heels and places his hands behind his back, keeping his mouth shut.
“I love you,” Sherlock says against John’s neck.  “I know it doesn’t matter that I’m saying it here and now, because I’m going to die, but I love you.”
“Didn’t you have any crushes on celebrities when you were a kid?” John asks, feeling that if he can make the confession then perhaps Sherlock will reveal a bit of himself as well.
So he tries.  After being told Sherlock doesn’t have friends, and after being interrogated by who he will later learn is Sherlock’s older brother, after getting back to 221B from the other side of London (quite annoying) he tries.  He follows Sherlock down the road, breathing a soft curse on his way out.  This is in fact the most fun he’s had in ages.  So he tries.  In the Italian restaurant.  Sherlock seems to have helped everyone in London.  Mrs. Hudson, Angelo.  It’s a paradox and it’s a nice one.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but does so.  John takes in the extent of Sherlock’s back.  There are pink scars all over his back.  They look like they may have been quite deep at one point.
Sherlock has texted him three times today.   John still isn’t used to it.  It’s been a month since Sherlock came back and John knows he’s alive but he’s still surprised when Sherlock contacts him, when he finds himself at Baker St. again, about to attempt to help solve a case.
For a week Sherlock is nervous mess.  He knows John likes him.  He likes John.  He more than likes John.  He wants to know everything about John, and Sherlock has no idea how to make a move.  He has done this before but there’s something about John that makes this far more difficult than it should be.  Sherlock thinks that if he doesn’t do things properly he’ll regret it every day for the rest of his life.
John doesn’t say anything for a moment.  He stares up at the sky and simply admires.  The brightly colored leaves are out there somewhere, falling and changing.  John lets out a sigh, then turns back to Sherlock.  The small back porch light gives Sherlock just enough light to see that John is smiling.
John wonders how much more pain he could have taken if Sherlock hadn’t loved him back.  He tries not to think about it.
“I got shot and lost my job six months ago. Like, I literally got shot and couldn’t be a surgeon anymore. I nearly died and now I’m useless. Please give me that slice of cake immediately,” John said, and everyone laughed mildly. This was how their group had always handled unfortunate circumstances. They just had to be open and laugh about everything. John leaned forward to take his reward.
“Yes,” Sherlock says.  He means it so deeply.  His heart is pounding and he’s fairly certain he has a dopey look on his face.
“It didn’t seem as though you were going to call me back. Playing it cool I see,” Sherlock said, and panic seized John once again.
John leans back in his chair and looks sleepily to Sherlock.  They’re both incredibly wasted and Sherlock keeps rubbing at his eyes.
“Yes, of course,” John finally manages, and it all happens so quickly after that. It happens with the telly still playing softly, bathing Sherlock in blue light. And Sherlock’s voice low, breath hitching. It feels languid and like the most tender thing John has ever done. John whispers things to Sherlock, things he’d forgotten he wanted to say while he had been away.
