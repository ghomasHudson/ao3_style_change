“What’s wrong?” she asks.
“Never batted for the same team?” He laughs nervously. They’re the same person, with the same needs and wants, the same tastes and history. He shifts in his chair, trying to craft the right answer. “Cas won’t mind,” she says. “Not bothered by the whole gender thing, a waste of these great tits if you ask me.”
“So, we all share heaven now?”
“On and off," She leans her head against his shoulder and takes a deep breath. “I missed you.” She moans into his shoulder, the noise is somewhere between pain and pleasure.
“We’re going to get you squatting, let gravity do its best work.”
“I was kidding about the bottle tops. It’s adorable you can read minds, but you can’t use a bottle opener.”
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t have given you the life you deserved,” she says, kneeling in front of the mound of dirt she had just dug. “I couldn’t have been a good mother to you. You deserved more. I’m fucking sorry. If I could do it all over again, I would, believe me.”
“Miss Winchester, I haven’t had the pleasure yet,” he says in a Southern drawl.
“Don’t,” she whispers. Her belly is still round with the baby that was safe inside just a week ago. They don’t talk. Just sit in silence and wait to plan their daughter’s funeral.
“Jack and I worked hard to give you both this type of heaven, she deserves to be happy. If you can’t support it, then I think you should go.”
“Yeah, I promise,” she says. She lays down on the bed, being able to freely rub her tummy without worrying it would be drawing attention to it.
“You told her?” Deanna snaps.
“Maybe we could have one,” she shyly says, looking up at him with long dark eyelashes.
“Deanna,” he sighs.
“I’m going to push too,” he tells her. He feels along her belly to the pelvic bone. He pushes harder than naturally comfortable, he thinks he can feel the hard, bony bump of her daughter’s shoulder. The next time he feels her push, he pressed down at the flesh at the base of her hard belly. He lets out a breath as he feels the child’s shoulder body.
Dean goes to bed before her most nights, he’s getting old she’ll joke. She’s still not used to sleeping, the concept of falling asleep and never knowing if you were going to wake up was still disconcerting for her. She reads in the library, still unable to take her mind off the birth of Sam and Eileen’s child. It was so primal, so raw, so beautiful. She rubs her empty belly and thinks what it would feel like to birth Dean’s child. Would he help deliver his child or would he freak out in the chair beside her?
“You rest,” he solemnly says.
“It’ll be okay. Auntie Rowena will solve it. Pass the bairn to Samuel, this may be uncomfortable.” More uncomfortable than the three days of labor? She kisses her daughter on the head and whispers her goodbyes before begrudgingly giving her to Sam.
“Today would have been-” he starts.
“You have to be a good big sister. You have to be brave and look after your little brother or sister. That’s what big sisters do. They’ll annoy you and sometimes you’ll hate them,” she strokes her little cheeks still slick but entirely perfect, “but you gotta look after them, protect them no matter what.”
“Don’t do that!” he shouts. “Avoid pushing, pant, just relax.” Relax, she snorts, relax, when a human life was threatening to split her open.
The next day she gets up and showers away any reminiscent of the tragedy. She’s still bleeding but her body no longer hurts. She dresses quickly, for the first time not wondering if maternity clothing existed that didn’t look like you were about to drive off with Charlie Manson. They drive to a quiet piece of nowhere with another grass to dig a little hole.
Sam is waiting on the bridge, bleary-eyed and dazed. He looks exactly how he remembered him. Hair too long, limbs long and smile wide. He hugs him closely and smiles. He takes a long looking. He hadn’t forgotten a single detail of his baby brother.
She goes back to bed and tries to distract herself with music and TV. 3 days later and she’s still in the same spot, her muscles aching and her joints tired. Nothing is painful enough to make her scream but noticeable enough to wear her body out.
“It will be hours yet, this little one seems to be in no rush.”
“I’m sure we could find a room to set him down in,” Sam says.
“Then go,” she says, before turning away.
“Is there a problem?” he asks. She laughs and unbuttons his shirt. She pushes him down so he’s lying on the bed before she mounts him. She straddles his waist, enjoying the contact of her crotch against his own. She leans over him and kisses him gently, reassuring him that this was very much what she wanted.
“I don’t really care right now.” Rowena helps her lie onto her back, despite really not wanting to get back into that position. Her panties have come off, leaving her in nothing but a big plaid shirt. She thinks she can feel fingers insider her but it’s hard to tell where one pain ends, and another starts.
She happily climbs into bed, not bothering to get under the sheets. “Will you stay?” she murmurs.
“She isn’t real. She never lived, she never existed. Your daughter is a fantasy, an unhealthy fantasy.”
“Get out,” she says, her voice low and threatening.
“I know,” Cas hushes. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“I must, this is my fault,” he says, brows furrowed. He looks at with an expression of grief. Years ago this would have come easy to him but now he knew the joy of being a father, of the unconditional love of a child.
“No shit,” she murmurs, rubbing at her head. Her body feels stiff, like she had taken a few rounds against demon stunt double number #3. She gets up and feels her knees crick. She stands in front of the bathroom and takes a deep breath before looking inside. It’s pristine, probably cleaner than when she arrives. It was as if nothing had happened. For a second, she wondered if the whole thing was a nightmare, and that she was still pregnant.
“All the time,” he tells her. He thinks about her every second he can bare it. Thinks about her closed eyes, her tiny fingers, the silence in the room when she entered the world. He held her, wrapped up in the little blue blanket, and sobbed. There was he could do with his limited powers, she had died before she even had a chance in the cruel world. Deanna didn’t cry, she quickly had to look away, her hands shaking as she held Gia. “It’s okay to think about her, to miss her.”
“Hey, I said I’d give you a baby. I didn’t say how or where.” He slides his briefs down and lifts her slip up. They make love on their floor, their bodies entirely entwined. His arms holding her off the floor, her legs around his waist. She had always loved feeling him shudder in ecstasy above her, but now it came with a feeling of hope.
“Four days,” he says. “They have slept almost as much as you have.” She’s torn, she wants to hold them, but they look so peaceful she couldn’t bear to disturb them.
“We don’t do that here!” Dean immediately says.
Her libido had been sky high the last few weeks. She had spent the last few weeks, during her insomnia, masturbating through the night. She found a good self-induced orgasm helped ease her joint pains. She lets Cas rub her swollen body until she thinks she’s going to come, he’s using his grace to help ease some of her soreness and the warm pulses are going straight to her crotch.
“I’m testing to see if this pregnancy thing will stick.” Her body is healed and new, she knows that Cas did that, every scratch and scar gone. There is no reason her body can’t carry her child, the only reason it can’t is her own stupidity.
She opens his bottle of whiskey unapologetically and brings it, alongside a glass, to his favourite spot on the kitchen floor. She drinks and cries, mourning the end of a relationship. They told her she was stupid, to give up her grace for one man. They warned her not to waste so many years protecting a human who would never love her in the same way she loved him.
“No, I’m just saying you don’t have to do this.”
“I’m such a dick to my angel,” he murmurs, his lids heavy. “I can’t tell him how much I love him. Why can’t I tell-”
“It can help bring on labor,” she says, looking up at him with those blue eyes. She dives her right hand into her panties and starts to rub herself. “It helps ease the pain,” she says. He kneels down in front of her, discarding his wet towel to the floor, and watches her finger play under the thin material.
“I can’t. I’m sorry.” She stands up and pulls her panties up, ignoring the discarded jeans on the floor.
She doesn’t hear the fluttering of wings, but she suddenly senses someone in the passenger seat. “Jesus, Cas. You can’t just creep up on a woman like that.”
“You believed in Jack. Why won’t you believe in our child? A kid we made.”
“Big. You know the baby, babies are the size of an endive, whatever that is. I have an app that tells me.”
“What good are you!” she screams. “Do something! Do something good! ” She screams. She’s pulling at his jacket in desperation, tears rolling down her eyes. She beats his chest, screaming at him to save her child. He lets her hit him, taking each pounding and insult.
“How long have you got?” the cop says with the warm sympathy she hated. Deanna flips the page on the file, shifting in the chair slightly. The woman is giving us a dumb smile. She keeps getting dumb looks of sympathy from middle-aged women in public.
“Hey, Cas,” she answers. She puts the phone on speaker and tosses it onto the passenger seat.
“You’re right. I won’t pretend.” Cas' body relaxes in his arms, his hands busy stuffing a pillow into a case.
“Why?” he asks.
Deanna opens her mouth, but Sam interrupts her, “Thank you,” he says with a polite smile. She seethes on her way to the room. “Chill,” he says. She sits down and pouts, almost feeling the steam coming off her body.
“Jason.” He’d been one of the older men from their camp, Team Free Will. He’d been with them for about six months. Dean found him odd in a charming sort of way. Jason used his spare time to knit various articles of clothing, and he’d leave them on cabin doors for people to find later. Dean got a scarf and Cas a pair of socks.
“Yeah?”
When he saw Cas’s face fall in disappointment Dean said, “I don’t get it. What could you use that for?”
Dean didn’t answer, the question didn’t seem directed at him.
After a while Cas’s easy connection and the flirtatious, teasing music made Dean start to forget that he was supposed to be “teaching” Cas. Instead of thinking about the next pattern, Dean began just feeling the music. It seemed less like leading moves, and more like the music pulling them through different moves.
“No, I’ll do it.” Cas said, grabbing their medical supplies from the bathroom. Cas sat at the dining table in the center of the room, which was basically an old wooden picnic table. He shoved Dean’s green satchel and an angel blade to the side to place their medical box.
“What?” he said breathlessly.
“I’m a ‘baby in a trench coat,’” he continued, “You were right.”
It made Dean a little uneasy that dancing could mean so much to Cas, though he wasn’t sure why. Despite that a spark of pleasure went through him, knowing that he’d helped Cas in some way.
The first stitch was always the worst, but the next few turned into a dull throb as the whole area became massive hot pain.  Dean bit his lip hard and closed his eyes. By the time Cas tied the last knot his hands were shaking. Cas exhaled heavily through his nose in relief. “Done,” he breathed.
Cas was finishing his water. The hair on his lips had grown long enough that they dipped into the cup. When he finished, he wiped his mouth and the sweat glistening on his forehead with the sleave of his shirt. He leaned back and tucked a strand of hair behind his ears. Had he ever seen Cas sweat? Another sign he wasn’t an angel anymore, he thought with a pang of guilt.
This time when he reconnected with Cas, it was closer. Dean could distinctly feel the heat radiating in the small distance between them, and the forearm that was resting gently across Cas’s back. As the guitar cried one high pitched reverberating note, Dean lifted their frame as if taking a breath. Then released when the guitar dropped, and the steady bass rhythm kicked in. He stepped through the violent desperate rhythm of the drum and the guitar, the feeling penetrating through his skin. Cas seemed to be right there with him, a steady presence, moving with the same energy as he did, moving with the same emotion. He could feel it through their connection, almost as if their minds were connected, embodying this sad and violent emotion as two connected entities.
was definitely not what Dean expected.
a second go. Nice of Cas to ruin it.
“Jesus Cas, get over it. No wonder they left. They’re probably glad to be rid of you,” he said. It felt good. But only for a second.
Cas smiled. “Don’t flatter yourself,” he teased.
Dean popped in the first CD labeled “fav. Blues”, and pressed play. A soft rhythm and a slow guitar solo filled the room. It wafted away the suffocating fog and replaced it with something much more bearable. A mournful and raspy voice joined the guitar. Dean closed his eyes as the voice seeped under his skin, down into his muscles. His heartbeat slowed, and the air was easier to breath.
” Dean said again. People just weren’t that perfect their first time dancing. For Dean it had taken several days and a very frustrated girlfriend to develop enough of a connection to lead her. But Cas seemed to connect and follow as if he’d been doing it for years.
“Crazy, eh?” he responds with a crooked response. “My little Sammy, a Dad with his own kid to look after.”
“I know it’s just the turkey burger or my period. I know she’s gone. I’m not crazy. Sometimes, you know?”
She hears the phone buzz on the table. She doesn’t bother looking at the caller ID, presuming it to be Sam.
“It’s good,” She leads him towards the bed, where they sit awkwardly. She feels fourteen again, waiting for a boy to unpick her bra. “They are watching us.”
The shower runs cold and she sits in the dirty bath until she shivers with a chill. She was going to get rid of it, Cas was going to get rid of it. He had a plan when he put it in her, right?
“Deanna, go back to bed,” he says quietly. “You want some food? I’ll bring it up to you.”
She sits on the toilet in the grimy motel bathroom and feels the blood leaking in the bowl. Her body feels so tired. It had failed her again. Her belly is crampy and feels hard to the touch “Cas, I, I,” she doesn’t finish her sentence, she can’t finish her sentence. Instead, she gulps back tears as her body cramps up.
“I think I’m just going to sleep for a bit,” she sighs. “You don’t have to stay.”
“You need to buy me dinner before you can look at me like that,” she quips, feeling nausea in my back of her throat.
“She’s so small,” Jack says, sitting on the seat next to her. Sam has started running around doing his Harry Potter nonsense, she pays him no attention. All that mattered was remembering every inch of her daughter’s tiny face.
“You should be using your anger on Cas. Had he sealed the deal we wouldn’t have to be doing this now.” His hand has unbuttoned her jeans and she has to close her eyes to not see the look of glee on his face. She feels her body getting turned over and pushed against the wall. Both her hands are placed above her head. He’s too strong for her to do anything but hold her breath.
She stands up straight and turns to look at Cas. She squeezes his shoulder before she gets into her car. She’ll never talk about what happened those days ever again. She’ll think about him all the time. She’ll see his face in every kid she’ll ever meet. She’ll dream about him. She’ll sometimes let her mind drift away in the shower to the toddler she would have had. Cas never forgets, she sees it in his eyes.
“Hands off my fucking son,” a woman growls. The woman from before has returned, her gun pointing at Sam. He turns around, the toddler in his arms entirely content. “Put him down.”
“My babies,” she mutters.
“I didn’t want to wake you. I couldn’t help the noise.” She is struggling to talk, taking little breaths between words. She lifts her pelvis up as another contraction hits.
“Yeah, we’re in our own little bubble. Eileen, Charlie, Bobby, Rufus they’re all here. Even Mom and Dad live over there,” he points vaguely at a cabin in the difference. He doesn’t see them often. Sometimes they come into the roadhouse, but an awkward silence appears when everyone looks up and sees John. They soon leave
“What have I done wrong?” she wails.
“Dee, Dee? Can you hear me?” he says, clutching her face in her hands. Her mouth is too dry to speak but Cas soon helps her sit up with a drink. He looks tired and she sees the armchair in the corner he has been spending all his time.
“They might be good, they might do something good.”
“Forming life is complicated, things can go wrong. One of my father’s downfalls, I’m afraid. You did nothing wrong.”
“We women have been birthing babies without men for centuries. He’s done his bit, now it’s down to you and you are a terrifyingly strong woman. You got that?” She gulps and nods. She lifts up Deanna’s t-shirt to reveal her large belly. She places her hands on it, pressing gently into it. “One is head down, the other is being rather naughty but we’ll deal with them when we get to them. Now Samuel,” she starts, standing up, “we need ingredients.” The pair talk through a list of herbs and exotic ingredients before sitting back down on the edge of her bed. She takes Deanna’s hand and places it on her lower abdomen. “there is your wee one’s head, all ready to meet her or his mommy.”
“Yes, you can,” Jack says back.
“It’s not safe to go back,” Cas says. “Not now. Jack saved our lives.” He looks on proudly at the little boy crawling across the floor of their bunker, easily weaving in and out of the table legs.
“I’m not going to fuck you Cas,” she half-jokes, attempting to smile. “We can’t just replace her like a car art.”
She runs out their bedroom, trying not to slam the door behind her. She should have known Dean would have become bored with her, just look at his track record of relationships. She at least lasted longer than their motel stay, she had already beaten every woman she had ever seen him sleep with. He doesn’t follow her; he probably rolls over and goes back to sleep. He was never committed to her, she was just there.
“Please,” she moans.
“I’m tired,” she grunts. “No more.”
“I understand. You should get some rest.” She nods, feeling spent. She doesn’t know how long it’s been or what time it is, but her body is ready to sleep. He helps her off the floor, trying not to slide on the bloody messy she has left behind.
“I don’t,” Cas cautiously says. “But perhaps this universe has an identical Castiel.”
He sits down beside her on the floor. He leans in and kisses her passionately. They called it a purgatory kiss. When you’re scared to say everything you want to say, scared you’re going to lose each other.
She drifts in and out of conscious for a few days, hearing her children cry, hearing Cas tell them stories about his exploits with the Winchesters. She finally opens her eyes to the bright lights of the infirmary. She lies there with open eyes for what feels like an eternity before Cas notices.
“You don’t have to be.”
“Oh, sure, yeah. Who needs men, you know?”
“Yeah,” she smiles. It was still a strange thought, after all those years, that she was going to have a child with a former angel she had once tried to stab. All those late periods, gas and sip bathroom pregnancy tests and serious injuries.
“I know,” Cas wants to take Stephanie out of her arms, but she won’t let her go, “I know I died on a rebar, I know Mom, Dad, Ellen, Jo, Bobby, they are all dead. Cas is the most alive out of us all.”
As the song ended, Dean opened his eyes, feeling significantly calmer. The music seemed to have a similar effect on Cas, as he was leaning his back toward the table, elbows resting on the surface, and head lulled to the side as if he were basking in the sun. Cas, sensing Dean’s attention, glanced at him from the corner of his eyes. Cas’s lips lifted into a small smile. Dean felt a weight lift from his shoulders.
Fuck Cas.
written in a messy scribble. He found another labeled
“You did moves I didn’t teach you,” Dean said, putting his hands on his hips. Dean pursed his lips. “You’re not messing with me, are you?” It was a really weird joke if Cas was, but Dean couldn’t think of another explanation.
“Now what?” Cas asked. His face was oddly relaxed. Like he didn’t really care so much about the answer to that question, as he cared about Dean’s reaction. As usual the scrutiny made Dean uncomfortable.
“Cas?” Dean said.
“Don’t worry, it’s on the underside. You won’t hurt me.” Dean said. He had almost forgotten about that. It didn’t hurt right now, perhaps it was the alcohol.
A big blue dot now danced in his vision, and he blinked until it became a faint glow.
This was similar to what Dean was doing.
Cas stared down again with his dead eyes.
And to think he’d been
Cas nodded, and stared up at the ceiling. Dean was wondering if he was imagining the same memory.
Dean wondered if Cas was going to ask about the girl. He and Cas avoided talking about the past most of the time. It just brought up painful memories or regrets. Dean had too many to count. He suspected that Cas had a few too.
To Dean’s knowledge, Cas had only ever watched Andrea stitch someone up, but never actually done it himself. Dean wasn’t overly confident in Cas’s abilities to do the procedure, but he knew Cas wanted to help. He knew what it felt like to want to be useful.
Cas frowned and shook his head. His eyes danced around the room seeming to try to find the answer that Dean was looking for. “You didn’t teach it, but you showed it with your body.” Cas gestured at Dean’s torso.
They reconnected, Cas’s arms draping themselves over Dean’s, and the tumbler once again clicked into place.
He sighed and said, “Yeah, I have.”
But, Cas’s face reddened at the ‘S’ word. A prude as usual. “Never mind,” Cas said turning away, giving up. The fleeting happiness had left his face, and Dean’s heart fell.
“I can stay with Liz,” Cas said through his teeth.
They stood in silence. The cabin creaked around them with the wind. Faraway drunken laughter breached their broken windows. A rat scuttled beneath their floorboards. Dean managed to say, “Cas…” but trailed off. An apology would be useless.
“I don’t want to hurt your wound,” said Cas eyes on Dean’s injured arm.
Dean raised his eyebrows not believing what he was hearing.
Thinking maybe he could save this night with some decent music, he picked up the player and set it on the table. He plugged the cord into their solar pack and set the CD’s aside. Upon turning the volume button, he felt a soft click, and a little green light appeared next to the nob.
Cas nodded and looked back down at his feet. Cas did as Dean told him. He didn’t bend his knees as much, and his posture slumped - not quite what Dean meant by relaxed, but it certainly gave the effect.
Cas still stared down at his cup, not seeming to be affected by Dean’s words.
Cas turned away from the door and made his way into the kitchen. He grabbed the bottle of vodka, and took a swig. Dean scrambled to find words to express how he felt, to offer Cas some kind of consolation. But as usual he couldn’t get any of the words out. They were all there in jumbled disorder, but they were held in the back of his throat.
“Dean?”
? Dean’s heart stuttered at the thought.
Dean’s attention was caught by a single guitar note that sliced through the room, which then wobbled and the notes fell into a sad riff. It was the only instrument being played and it seemed to echo against the walls of a dark empty room. The melody was sad and desperate, imploring anyone to listen to it. The drumbeat that kicked in a second later, was violent in contrast to the quiet of the guitar solo that was before. Dean was quickly being swept away by it and itched to dance.
A tense fog seemed to permeate through the room, suffocating them both. Cas’s shoulders were pulled in over his neck making him look small as he leaned over the kitchen counter. Dean shoved the chair that had been leaning on, and paced around the room, trying to just
Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise. He dug his heel into the rip in the center of the cushion. Some fluff popped out and he shoved it back in with his heel. “That good huh?” he said.
When the song wobbled and waned into its end, they slowly separated, Dean distinctly feeling the absence of Cas’s warmth.
“I think I need to show you how it feels,” Dean said, holding down the nervousness blooming in his chest.
Cas turned to him, seeming to expect an answer.
bring this up again,” he said. He stomped to his room and slammed his door as hard as he could. It banged loudly.
Cas glanced at him, and Dean realized he’d been staring. Cas smiled anyway, not seeming to make any note of it.
Cas came closer and gently pulled Dean’s palm from his arm, inspecting the wound beneath. He furrowed his eyebrows.
Too curious not to ask, Dean said, “How so?”
Dean rattled through his mind for words that he needed, that weren’t the desperate words,
“Exactly,” Dean breathed in triumph. He wasn’t sure what he had said that clicked, but it worked.
“What do you mean?” Cas said as his blush faded from his face. Then the edge of his lip quirked up. “Are you going to dance with me?”
He exited the room thinking he needed some of that vodka. He poured some into a plastic cup. Cas was hunched over on the bench, elbows on his knees, and the butt of his hand buried in his eye sockets.
“I say a lot of shit,” Dean said. He poured himself another shot and took it. He’d have to do at least two more shots before he really felt anything. Cas hadn’t said anything. From the look on his face Dean knew he should say more. “You’re just human,” he said, “Everyone has to deal with it.”
“That reminded me of flying,” Cas said thoughtfully, rolling the empty cup in his hands.
“You’re laughing at me.” He looked more hurt than angry.
“I just,” he said. “I think you need Sam.”
He brought them both over to the table and nudged Cas on the shoulder. “Thanks Cas,” he said. Cas dropped his hands from his face and took the cup, without looking at him.
“Get it out,” she shouts.
“This is our daughter, Stephanie,” Cas says. She could see hearts light up in his eyes when he looked at their daughter.
Cas reappears without Sam or Jack. “He’s fast asleep.”
“I’m just worried,”
He wraps the sheet around them, trying to protect their modesty. She feels him gulp in nervousness as she removes her panties. He has no issues taking her bra off. She guides his hand between her legs, letting her feel her wet core. She shows him where to rub and he easily slides one finger in. She rests her head in the crook of his neck, gasping for breath. She’s soon rutting as she bends his fingers to perfectly hit the spot, his thumb rubbing at her clit. She comes, her head tilting back against the plush pillow.
She would rather die with him by her side, that alone with the possibility he’d find some way of bringing her back.
“I don’t think she should hunt with you today,” she hears Cas say. She has her back to the door, the sheets celestially cleaner than they should be. Cas has tucked the sheet around her and then draped his trench over her body.
“Ask Cas,” she grumbles. She spends the next few days asleep in her room, Sam gives her the space she needs. She presumes Cas has explained the situation to him.
“Okay fine,” Dean said, determined not to let the night end on a bad note. “I’ll teach you the basic.”
Cas tilted his head. “Thank you,” he said hesitantly, clearly baffled by Dean’s reaction.
Seriously? Cas was fucking analyzing him? Dean clenched his jaw and tried to control his breathing. Cas looked like he knew he was doing something wrong, but he continued on anyway.
an angel. I don’t know.” He threw up his hands and looked away from Dean.
“One more time?” Cas asked, also seeming to be swept away by the song.
“What?” Dean said. The edge of Cas’s lips twitched.
Cas’s blush faded as he watched Dean stand up. “Really?”
that repeated desperately in his mind. “Where are you going to go?” Dean said instead, not moving a muscle.
Dean nodded, not wanting to interrupt the perfect melody.
Dean stopped moving.
“Yeah,” Dean whispered, apparently not able to speak loudly. Bringing that song to life with Cas made him release a tension he didn’t know he was holding, allowing him to breath easier. It was refreshing. Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah it was a good song.”
Dean found it uncomfortably easy to brush off Jason’s death. He’d lost so much in the past year. Ellen, Jo, and Bobby all died violently. And Sam… well he was somewhere else. All Dean had was Cas now.
“After each step there’s a bounce or pulse, where you straighten your knees a bit.” Dean said, he exaggerated the movement so Cas could see it more easily.
B.B. King’s
Dean rolled his eyes. As if he were stupid enough to not know for sure.
Dean rolled his head considering. “Right but usually you have to be taught those signals first.” Dean wasn’t even that good of a leader, he hadn’t exactly spent a lot of time practicing while away from his girlfriend. How could Cas be picking up the signals so quickly? How did he know how to move his feet, when he could barely move them properly while practicing the basic on his own?
“I believe I’m losing my powers.” Cas dropped his hands to his sides.
Dean didn’t like to think of Cas without his powers. It wasn’t him. He was a battle hardened, nearly emotionless, socially awkward angel warrior.
Cas’s eyes shot up from his feet and he immediately stopped moving.
“No, I mean that was
Dean was becoming hyper aware of only two things, Cas and the music. Everything else around him melted away . Dean shifted his arm, so it wrapped all the way around Cas’s back, so that they were chest to chest, the heat giving Dean goosebumps. Their heads, now so close, began to gently rest against each other. Cas’s disheveled hair tickled his cheek. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dean knew that he should be screaming at the intimacy, but those thoughts were far away, a feint echo drowned out in a deep canyon. It didn’t matter right now because the song called for it.
The light in the room began to flicker and Dean immediately tensed. He looked for any nearby weapons – the iron poker by the fireplace, the gun on the table, the angel blade – but then he realized it was just the gas lamp running out of fuel. He made to stand up, but Cas beat him to it, and he was headed toward the kitchen to get a new propane canister. Dean relaxed, and lifted his other leg onto the couch, leaning heavily into the arm. Maybe he’d sleep here tonight, just to change it up. Even though this couch was dusty and smelled faintly of body odor, it was really comfortable.
“I’m bleeding,” she gasps. He’s looking over her for a bleeding cut. “The baby, I think I’m losing it.” He walks towards her and she takes a step back, until she’s pushed up against the bathroom sink, and places a hand on her belly. She feels the warm tingle of his grace running through her atoms.
“Are they okay? Is that bad?” she says, her voice panicked.
“Don’t leave me. I can’t do it without you.”
“Samuel is going to use all that brutish force for good and hold you up, okay?” She nods, before talking a gulp. She manages to get back to her feet, despite her body being beat. It takes her a while to find the right squatting position, by the side of the bed with Sam on her right and Jack on her left. She can feel her baby dropping down in her, her body opening up. Suddenly her water gushes out of her, it’s clear and nothing like the dramatic thing she sees on TV. It carries on leaking as her contraction suddenly get more intense.
She has to finally say goodbye to her wardrobe and results to wearing ugly dresses. She was so uncomfortable and warm, she didn’t care how she looked. Jack tells her he looks pretty and she starts to feel more like a mother, starts to look like her own mother. Sam buys her a pregnancy belt to help hold up her huge belly, she has to never been so thankful for a piece of Velcro across her body.
“We’re going to wait until the pains come back,” he reminds her. He feels her muscles contract again and he reaches up to support the head as it begins to crown again. Her toes are digging into the bedsheets on either side of him. Her lips are slowly stretching over the round, hard head. She is pushing with all her might, reaching down behind her knees to haul them up to her heavy, panting chest. His hands are at her opening, waiting to catch her daughter.
“I’m Sam Winchester, this is my brother Dean,” Sam explains. The woman lowers her gun and laughs before pointing it at Sam again.
“You’re freaking me out.” Dean was always terrified that Cas would say he had to leave. Not a day or two away with Jack, but infinitely. He loved the idea of having forever with Cas, he couldn’t deal being stuck in a forever without him.
“You’re not coming,” he says amused.
The final contraction finally hits, her hips bucking as the rest of her daughter’s body leaves Deanna. The child is led on the bed, wiggling in a stick pool of pink-tinged fluid and dried blood. Deanna’s belly sinks, deflating like a popped balloon. The baby stares up at Cas and starts wailing.
“Sit down.” He gently rubs her back. It’s been too long without any change. They had to wait it out, nothing else they could do in this new world. There were no doctors, no medical delivery equipment, no handbooks. They had raided a hospital for what they could, and he had listened to any second-hand stories from those in the camp with children. It was out of their hands, is the only thing he was sure of.
“Let’s just stay here one night,” Sammy interjects. “Work out a plan.”
“I think we should talk privately,” Cas says.
“See him,” Cas says, entwining their hands together. “I’ll be here, take your time.” Dean leans his forehead against Cas and takes in a deep breath.
“I need sleep.”
“A little brother and sister.”
“I always came back,” she sighs.
“Keep him warm, we’ll be there soon,” he says. He’s crying, she can hear it in his voice. All blankets are in the trunk and the backseat has nothing on it. She takes the spluttering baby and holds him to her chest, feeling the umbilical cord against her. She unbuttons her shirt and slips him inside it, hoping that between the flannel and her breast he would stay safe. She buttons the shirt up over him, engulfing his body.
“Can I push now?” she begs, still gripping Jack’s hand.
“I can’t,” she whines, with chattering teeth. He starts kneading at her belly, pushing against the soft skin. She closes her eyes again and leans back with a sigh. Her body starts to contract again as he squeezes at her belly. She feels the needs to push again as he starts flicking her nipples. It seems a strange thing to do, but she knows Cas is doing it for a reason. Something slimy falls between her legs. “He’s dead, isn’t he?” she misses feeling him against her chest, misses hearing the little splutters of her son.
The vamp is killed within the hour. She may be slow but her senses were sharp. She barely noticed the twinges and pains in her belly, they’ve been happening most days since 24 weeks. Honestly, most days she felt like this baby was going to fall out of her. The little girl waits in the car as she hunts, when she comes back she is fast asleep in the passenger seat.
“Hello, I’m so happy to finally meet you,” she says. Her daughter lets out a loud cry and looks up at her with blue eyes. She falls to her knees in relief and joy. Sam quickly grabs a yellow towel and wraps it around her. “I’m your mommy, you won’t know me for very long, but you have to know how much I love you. How much I loved your father. I never wanted to leave you, never want you to not have a mommy.” She knows it’s pointless to say it to the minute’s old infant, but she has to say those words out loud.
“Two weeks left, my other half will kill me when they find out I’ve been out this long without him,” she tells the little girl’s mother. “He’s been antsy since I hit six months.”
“That I think we should have a child? That I want to bear your child?” She pushes herself up from her side.
“I know,” he sighs. “I don’t think I could ever bear seeing you so sad again. The thought you might walk out on me and never came back,” he says, kissing her head.
Sam takes a step forward and gently says, “Hi, how did you get in here?” The kid stops running and looks up at him, gently smiling at the giant. Sam leans down and the kid runs up and wraps his arms around Sam. “Where did you come from, little guy?”
“No shit, Sherlock,” she snaps, doubling over in agony.
“You’re not missing much, I’m pretty fucking big.”
She stares at her phone, no messages from him, nothing. She rings in, it goes straight to voicemail but she appreciates hearing his voice. “Hey, Cas, I mis-,” she clears her throat, “How you doing, Cas, this case is shit but we’ll sort it out. Sam is out now, the cops around here can’t take evidence for shit. Baby is good. Size of a pineapple. Hopefully less prickly. Who decided babies are measured in fruit? Weird man. I’m not sleeping much, even less than usual,” she darkly chuckles, “Back hurts a lot, probably because I’ve got really fat, but I’m all good. Look after yourself.” She hangs up and tries not to think of the worst.
“I have to find a way to save you,” he begs, “I need you Deanna, I need you to be alive.”
She’s six weeks pregnant when she drives with Sam to Wichita. She scheduled an abortion for the earliest they could do. It’s expensive and it’s scary. The idea she’s going to be knocked out with her legs open is more terrifying than any vampire or demon or wraith.
“Are you leaving me?” she asks Cas, ignoring her brother.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” she says with an awkward smile. “I just think it’s mighty mean that a woman in your condition still be working on the road. The road ain’t no place for a pregnant woman. Your managers should be ashamed of themselves.”
“I gave up everything for you,” she says, feeling the tears roll down her face. “I gave up my grace for you.”
“Have you ever thought about it?” she asks, sitting on the edge of the bed.
“You asked me to. I believe it is unsafe and unkind to leave a woman alone when suffering a trauma.”
“Am I dead?” she hazily asks. The scene was too perfect. Cas, looking as gorgeous as the day she tried to stab him, and their perfect son together in their bedroom.
“Deanna!” he sternly tells her. “I know this hurts, but you have to do this.” She grips onto her legs, one of them using Cas’ shoulder as a stirrup. He feels the shoulder under his hand again, it’s close to clearing the pubic bone. They push together but he can sense her strength is weakening. The child is wiggling inside her, slowing moving down her widening birth canal. He leans over and cups her face, letting a jolt of celestial strength coarse through her. He hadn’t used it earlier in fear of slowly her contractions down, but now they were getting desperate.
She’s lucky she doesn’t have all the terrible pregnancy side effects. No morning sickness, no tiredness, no cravings. Her breasts are sore and her sense of smell is a little intense, all easy to hide from Sam. She’s lucky his rabbit food has no smell and no taste. In fact, she struggles to sleep, which is the opposite to most pregnancy leaflets she has collected since taking that goddamn test.
“Do something,” she growls. He turns around to face the bathroom door and shakes his head.
“I need to push,” she says, in shock. “Fuck!”
“It looks very small. I believe it passed some weeks ago.” She cradles the little sac in her hands, ignoring the other jelly-like clots around it.
“I meant it,” she says. “I love you. You don’t have to say it back but I thought I was gonna die there, didn’t want to go without you knowing.”
“It’ll kill me,” she murmurs, staring at the ceiling. “I don’t want it. I can’t have it.” She feels a tightening in her chest as she says those words.
“Now, now,” he smirks, “Not words a lady should say.”
“I’m sorry. You deserved better. I’m so sorry.”
“Am I doing something really stupid?”
Turns our normal people who don’t have supernatural stepchildren don’t realise they’re pregnant moments after conception. Life carries on as normal, except she can’t bear to look at Jack and Cas. When she isn’t hunting, she is hiding in her room.
“Your baby, your pregnancy, this whole world is fake.”
“I can’t sleep now.”
The woman at the desk side-eyed her as they walk into their motel. “You got an issue?” Deanna snaps.
“Because God is shutting down our world?” Sammy adds. She’s smart and cautious, elegant in her actions. His sister was kinda hot, if you liked tall and skinny chicks, Dean thinks.
“Cas, you can’t-”
“Did one of your spells work?” He looks down and nods. “Cas, you saved my life.”
“You deserve more than me, Cas,” she says, one lone tear running down her splotchy yet beautiful face.
“I sometimes wonder if she ever existed, that it wasn’t some fucking cruel dream.”
She takes a long hot shower. It was her own fault, she had gotten caught up in the moment. The idea of her angel wanting her, the idea she could finally have him in her arms. She punches the shower wall in anger, she had signed her death sentence because she couldn’t keep her legs closed.
“It hurts!” she grunts, but the pain only strengths her determination. Was he supposed to cup the baby’s head or pull it out of her? He doesn’t have to think long before their perfect baby slides out alongside a gush of fluids. He quickly takes their child, a little girl, in his arms. “Is she okay?”
“You know we could find another way?” Sam asks, having been mostly silent on the drive and wait. “There has to be a way you have this baby and don’t die. Cas isn’t as powerful as Lucifer. It’s different.”
“I can’t let you do that, Sam,” he forcefully says.
“Am I leaving you?” he replies, dumbfounded. “Why would I leave you?”
“Think I’d be a good dad?” he asks.
“You need to stop calling him my child when he is kicking. Are you in pain?”
“Hello?” he hears Sam voice echo through their modest apartment. They didn’t want for a big house, they had each other and that was the home Dean had been looking for all those years. Sam’s voice, unheard for so long to Dean, sounds like it automatically belongs in the space.
“Cas?” he nervously asks.
“As a father and a partner, two things I never thought I’d be, I have a responsibility to keep them safe.”
“She was dead and I wanted Jack to spend some time with his mother, even if she wasn’t with us anymore. I placed him on her chest, and he brought her back to life,” Sammy explains, her voice quivering.
“No, I mean he sleeps with me. In my room. We’re kind of a couple.” Dean and Cas had never had that relationship. After his death, they had automatically fallen into something he supposes is a relationship. He just knows it’s love.
“Cas, you need to tell her,” he says. She scrunches up her nose, what does Cas need to tell her? Pregnancy brain had made her forget her own name, but she can’t think what Cas would need to tell her. Her heart drops, he was going to leave her. He had seen her sweaty, red face as she pushed out their child, had seen her stretch marks and leaking breasts, he was going to leave them. He didn’t want to be a father, and he was going to leave them all alone.
He kisses her neck, strokes her hair, rubs her belly. He feels useless, unable to ease her pain. He feels her clammy back, sweat dripping down it. She takes his hand and places it on her belly, indicating the gentle touches she needs over the tight contracting area. Her head lolls back onto his shoulder as she moans in pain.
“Don’t start that with me,” he threatens. “I would have given my life for you. I would give my life for you,”
When her belly hardens, she braces her leg on either side of him. Her ankles hook around his hips for leverage. She is cupping her sex, moaning and grunting. He can see the way her legs tremble, her child slipping further down inside her.
“Yes Dean?” Cas strolled into their shared living room, folding what looked like a black T-shirt. He was wearing a loose-fitting shirt with no collar and sleaves that flared out, his blue jeans frayed at the bottom. Dean still wasn’t used to seeing him without the trench coat.
“Right but you need to add a pulse to it,” said Dean. At Cas’s confused expression Dean said, “Have you ever seen Hitch?” He was thinking of the scene where Will Smith’s character Hitch showed his client how to dance “safely” in front of his date. Side step
“Deanna,” Cas says, closing the door behind him. He looks at the floor sheepishly. “I’m sorry.”
An hour or so later a swish of chiffon and red curls bounces into her room. “My, you have been busy,” a Scottish lilt says.
“No one is dead,” he says gently, with a smile. “You want to see your mommy? Dee, take your shirt off to get skin to skin contact.” Someone has changed her into a clean, baggy shirt that probably belonged to a guy she had once met at a bar. Only then does she notice the wet patches on her breasts. She strips herself of her shirt, noticing the way her breasts have changed shape, and takes her son in her arms.
“This is crazy!” he shouts. She carefully scoops her daughter up into her and kisses her head, letting her know she would be safe no matter what.
“We’ll set up the spare room for you,” Cas adds.
The next time she has a bath she has closed her eyes when she hears the door open. She’s already had to teach Jack to not use the toilet when she was in the bath.
“We’re in the car, we’ll be with you soon.” She hopes Sam is driving, Cas sounds a mess.
“I love you, Cas,” she gasps. He can’t acknowledge. He knows she is scared and in pain, she doesn’t mean it. She dips her fingers inside her passage, gasping a little. She must be able to feel her child’s head. She strokes it gently until the next pain comes. Alongside this pain comes a gush of fluid. “I’m sorry,” she cries.
“Don’t flush him,” she begs.
“I understand” he replies. “Let me ease the pain a bit.” She nods and lets him place his hand on her empty stomach. The warmth of his grace eases the cramps and nearly eliminates the back pain. He sits down on the floor beside her and she slowly finds herself leaning into him. His body is oddly room temperature, neither too warm nor too cold. He smells like an ocean breeze, with a hint of Pantene shampoo.
“About the case?” She shifts the Impala into a reverse.
“The most homoerotic film in existence, great,” she mutters. She feels duped because as soon as Jack sees Cas he moves to the floor, forcing Cas to sit beside her. She soon falls asleep on the angel, because that is what she does. He carries her to her bed, because that is what he does.
“Oh,” Sam says, he thinks for a second and bursts out in a smile, “I’m happy for you, man.”
“What the fuck?” is all she asks.
“We have to call someone,” Sam says with a frown. Deann’s holds Jack in one hand, and rests the other over her face.
“We need to get back to the bunker. It’s not safe out here for you now,” he tells her.
“You’ve been very busy with that wee angel of yours, haven’t you deary.”
“I thought you were dead,” she says, shedding a tear. “He wasn’t hurt, wasn’t he?” He’s smaller than she could ever imagine, with big blue eyes and dark hair. He already looks like his dad with his furrowed brow and full lips.
“Deanna,” Cas says. “I am good you are well. I hope you are resting.”
“Dee,” he says again, turning to face her.
“Kind of your thing.”
“I know,” she gasps. He helps her off the floor. “I feel like I need a shower now. For junkless gits, they sure like to touch the goods.”
“I don’t want to think about it,” he says, gripping her tight to his chest.
“Can’t it be fully there?” she asks.
“One of each?” she murmurs, leaning back and blinking. Her eyes well up. Knowing their gender gave them some form of identity, she could start to picture what they looked like, two faces she would never see again.
“I imagine you are still beautiful,” he sincerely tells her, and she finds herself beaming down the phone.
“Get it out of me,” she begs. This delivery has to go okay. They have nothing but a basic first aid kit. No pain medication, no stitches, just some gauze and band-aids. He reaches the taunt area between her vagina and her anus and massages it. She cries out in pain as he tries to ease at their child. It’s no longer about lust or sex, he just had to safely deliver her child. They’d worry about the awkwardness tomorrow.
“How are you doing?” he quietly asks, not want to disrupt the silence of the bunker.
“Deanna, you are glowing,” he says, walking up the stairs towards them.
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs. Cas’ hand stops rubbing the back of Dean’s head.
He obliges and removes his coat, fussing to fold it over the chair, and gets into bed beside her.
“Can I get you up on the bed?” Rowena asks. She climbs with a surprising amount of strength onto the bed, despite her body feeling like it had lost a fight or six. She lays back and watches her daughter snuggle into her chest. She unbuttons her shirt to feel her warm body against her skin. She had always thought babies were ugly, Sam had come back from the hospital looking like a little alien. But her daughter was perfect. She was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.
Cas stared down at the doorknob, and Dean dropped his hand feeling guilty. Cas turned to meet Dean’s eyes, searching. The look felt so probing that Dean had to drop his gaze and he hated himself for it. He couldn’t face the pain that he’d put Cas through.
Dean didn’t trust what would come out of his mouth, so he just shrugged.
And it was because of Dean that Cas had to feel it. Cas didn’t pull Dean out of hell, he traded places with him.
As he wandered, his eyes fell on an old CD player sitting on a side table next to the entrance. A couple of CD’s were balanced on top, and a layer of dust coated the entire thing. He’d seen it a while ago and had made a note to see if it worked, but had never gotten around to it. He picked up one of the CD’s, and brushed the dust off on his shirt. It was a CD without album artwork, it only had the words
talk about Sam.
“Cas!” he yelled into the room.
Cas’s shoulders tensed and seemed to wrap protectively over his chest. Shame replaced his mournful expression. Cas finished his shot, muttering, “Thanks for the alcohol.” He stood up and walked toward the door of the cabin.
“Yeah, all of it, perfect.”
“No. Just a cut, I didn’t get any of his blood on me.”
“So does that make me the wind?” Dean said.
Why couldn’t Cas just suck it up like they all did?
Dean proceeded to not sleep at all the rest of the night.
Cas let out a breath in frustration as if he’d been holding it. He dropped his hands, and turned away from Dean. Cas went to their bathroom, placed in between their two bedrooms, and reappeared a moment later with a small white cloth in his hand. Cas covered the wound with it and pressed down.
“Are you…” Cas trailed off, the word ‘infected’ not meeting his lips.
Dean stood up. He tried to stop himself from kicking something. He didn’t need Sam, they’d established it a long time ago. They were both better off alone.
“What is it?” Dean said shifting his weight.
Dean put the cup down and leaned back into the arm of the couch and rested one leg up on the middle cushion. Dean’s heart was lighter than it had been in a long time. He felt like he was floating above all his problems, problems which, if he thought about them to closely, he’d come tumbling back down.
“Now try it to music, and this time try to relax. Don’t bend your knees as much.” Dean emphasized this by loosening his arms and making his pulse smaller and calmer.
Dean asked it but he didn’t even want to hear the answer. He hadn’t thought about Sam in ages. He had him carefully tucked away in a locked box of
Every word Cas said stung, making the guilt boil in his stomach. Dean didn’t have an answer. Dean had grown up his whole life with his dad or brother in a motel bed next to him. When the sound of their breath, their snoring was gone, Dean couldn’t sleep. In some small way Dean could relate to this feeling.
Cas shook his head. The muscles on his cheeks stood out as he clenched his jaw. “It’s not working.” He said, now closing his eyes. A minute passed with nothing but continued bleeding, the drops now dripping off his arms and onto Dean’s boots
Cas nodded, but didn’t elaborate, simply contently stared at his cup.
They continued dancing through the tracks of the CD. They never had a moment like they had with that last song. There was something about it that just spoke to them both. Instead, it was high energy and left Dean’s body humming with energy.
Dean couldn’t help but agree. “Yeah alright angel,” Dean said, holding out his hand which Cas took, his face radiating relief. “But if you start dancing down a set of white stairs while singing ‘Beauty School Drop Out’, I’m going to bed.”
Cas’s eyes dropped to the floor and his shoulders slumped.
“We’ve probably finished half the CD,” Dean said. “Might as well finish it.”
“You can put up a pretty good fight,” he finally said, “Better than most people in the camp.” That was true at least.
Dean knew that Cas wanted to talk. He could tell by how he stared down at his vodka, by his eyes, open like a corpse and staring off into nothing. Dean also knew that nothing he said could make Cas feel any better. He was about to excuse himself to his room when Cas opened his mouth.
“Was it someone we know?” he asked.
Cas shut his mouth.
“Who is that?” Cas said.
“I’m just going to put my hand on your back,” Dean said. Dean stepped in so that their faces were about a foot apart, and he slipped his hand under Cas’s arm and rested it on the dip between Cas’s shoulder blades. Cas’s arm hovered over it uncertainly.
Dean shook his head and closed his eyes, trying to get his heartbeat out of his ears. He imagined being in his room at night, the darkness and silence that Cas was talking about, filling him until there was nothing left, like his bed was going to swallow him into this dark black hole. He’d become the insignificant nothing that he always knew he was. This feeling could only be stamped out by knowing Cas was in the room next to him.
“Good, now relax,” Dean said. He lightly shook Cas’s hand back and forth releasing some of the tension in his arms, “Give me little bit of your weight.”
Dean was in his late teens and was dancing with a pretty girl with light brown skin and dark hair. She had her hand in her thick curly hair and gave him a look that could bring him to his knees. It was a smile that lifted her entire face and made her eyes squint. It had a mischievousness, like she was planning a prank on him. Instead of leading her properly, he pulled her into his chest and kissed her. She kissed him back, then, with a smile, shoved him away with a hand on his chest.
“Tilt your head back, I got you,” Dean said. At that Cas relaxed into the dip, his neck arching backwards and hair falling from his face. With a smile Dean pulled Cas back up. Cas looked somewhat bewildered at the sudden change of pace, but otherwise unfazed.
Cas thought for a moment, then said, “Flying isn’t just moving from one destination to another. The wind lifts and shifts and buffets you until you’ve gotten to your destination. Dancing seems to be like that too, except there is no destination.”
Dean nodded. “Yeah, not a big deal.” Why did it feel like a big deal? Dean motioned with his head that Cas should stand up, and Cas followed.
“I’d like to learn.”
It was like a punch in the gut, completely unexpected and ripped the breath from his lungs. They
Dean went to their kitchen area, attached to the main living area and divided by an L-shaped counter. He grabbed a bottle of vodka and poured it over the wound. The pain lit up like a sparkler, bright, fizzing, and crackling. It was all Dean could see for a moment. When it turned to a dull burning ache, he released his breath and opened his eyes. His shirt sleeve was bloody and now wet with vodka. He went to his bedroom to change his shirt. His bedroom had two wardrobes, which he never touched, and a queen bed with a bedside table. He had a small window that looked out into the forest away from the camp. He’d strung two wires across the room so he could hang his cleaned clothes to dry. He threw his bloody shirt –it was one of his favorite led zeppelin t-shirts – onto his dirty laundry pile in the corner and grabbed a black one off the wire.
Cas came back and unscrewed the old canister, casting them in shadow. When he attached the new canister, the light flickered on, now more solid and bright. Cas squinted at the light as he finished screwing the canister back on, and the bright filament reflected in his eyes making it look like they were blazing from within. An orange glow was cast over him and made the hairs that framed his face glint like they were about the catch fire.
Cas set the lamp down in its previous spot on the table by the couch and looked back at Dean.
Dean downed the vodka, to hide the annoyance in his expression. It had been a joke. Cas had temporarily lost his powers because of some sigils that surrounded the area. It was frustrating not having the convenience of Cas’s powers. So, Dean had teased him.
was the next on the track. Dean knew this one. His lips curved upwards as the song not only stirred his mood, but also a brief happy memory.
Cas shrugged. Such a noncommittal gesture looked awkward on him.
Because it looked like Cas needed it, Dean poured a second cup of vodka.
Dean rolled his lips over his teeth and covered his mouth with his hand to keep the smile hidden from his face. He did his best to compose himself as Cas continued to practice his outrageous interpretation of the blue’s basic. Dean cleared his throat and dropped his hand.
He’d taught Sam a few moves once when they were young. What did that have to do with anything? “The hell are you talking about?”
Cas’s eyes drifted to Dean’s hand that now had blood seeping between his finger tips and down his arms. “What happened?” he said, setting the shirt down on their worn sofa and approaching him with a look of concern.
Cas’s arm came down over his, it touched his skin like a feather, contacting but with no weight. Cas’s hand in his was the same. As if too much contact would hurt Dean.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, smiling.
“This is blue’s music, so I’ll show you a couple of blue’s basics,” said Dean. The music seemed to easily guide Dean into the steps he hadn’t done in years. Dean had done this step so many times with that girl, it felt like he’d done it yesterday. Sidestep to the bass and pulse with the snares, then repeat. “It’s a simple weight change from one foot to the other.” Dean said.
The air suddenly felt thick.
Cas glanced at the little CD player, then back at Dean. “One more song,” Cas said practically pleading. “I was enjoying that.”
Dean took hold of the cloth. “Oh.”
By Cas’s blank stare, Dean knew it was a stupid question. The only movies Cas had ever seen were ones that Dean made him watch.
Dean thought.
Cas must have been joking, perhaps to lighten the mood even more. Dean put on grin in response. But when Cas’s gaze remained steady and curious, Dean’s grin faltered.
Some emotion passed over his eyes, a twitch of his brows. Something that Dean couldn’t identify. Curiosity? Dean shifted his gaze to the lamp and stared at it until the bright light burned into his retinas. Cas sat back down.
“You can put your arm over mine. Just rest your hand on my shoulder,” Dean said, his voice quieter now. There was no reason to talk any louder now that they were so close. Still it felt odd to be talking so quietly.
Cas didn’t look appeased, but he nodded and then placed his hand over the wound, cupping it but not touching it.
Cas sighed in sudden frustration. “Maybe its because I’m an angel then.
Cas’s eyes squinted in concentration. His lids were wrinkled, and he had heavy bags under his eyes. His beard was shaggy, Cas not yet handy or patient with a razor, shaved rarely. Several months ago, when they discovered Cas’s hair was actually growing, Dean had shown him how to use a razor, but that had ended in a bloody cut on his cleft chin. After that Cas wasn’t really interested.
Anger boiled in Dean’s stomach.
Cas shook his head. “I don’t understand.”
Dean poured another cup of vodka and downed it as quickly as he could. He remembered all the things that got them here. Dean brought Sam into hunting. Dean got their dad killed. Dean turned Cas against his family. Dean started the apocalypse. This was his fault. And the angel who rescued him from hell suffered the consequences.
Cas frowned at him, seeing his change of mood, even looking apologetic. He answered hesitantly, “The way you acted this evening. It … reminded me of when you were with Sam.”
This meant Cas truly was just following Dean’s lead. He didn’t learn it from anywhere.
Cas just nodded.
“It’s fine,” Dean said, “I’ll just go to Andrea’s.” Andrea was their camp doctor. Normally Dean would take care of his own cuts, but this one was deep enough that it needed stitches, and Dean couldn’t reach it.
Why was Cas rubbing his face in it? Why were the mulling over something so depressing?
At that the bewildered expression fell, and Cas’s shoulders relaxed
He threw his cup into the sink and it clattered stupidly and unsatisfyingly.
Halfway through the song, he felt Cas sit down on the bench next to him, his body heat warming Dean’s side. The song was long, and he let it pass through him, lifting him up and down like a wave just before it breaks.
“I’m sorry, I can’t seem to heal you,” said Cas not meeting his eyes.
“I’m sorry, I’ve never taught this before,” he said, “I’m just not doing a good job.”
“Yes but,” Dean held a finger out to Cas, “You don’t tell anyone about this.” But Dean held a smile behind his lips.
“What are you doing?” said Cas.
Cas stared at the wound, frown still etched in his brows. “You’re sure?”
But this was Cas, a battle-hardened angel. Why would he want to learn?
Cas turned back to his cup. “I feel like I’m dead.”
“Yes, I’m sure.” Dean said.
“I can’t hear them anymore. My brothers and my sisters. Did you know?”
“No,” Dean said as if the answer were obvious. It was such a random request. Dean taught Cas lots of things, how to cook, how to shoot straight, how to lie, but never something so non-utilitarian.
The song came to an end, and Cas was looking mildly frustrated and severely confused. The next track had higher energy, a fast-paced drum that reverberated in Dean’s chest, making him itch to move.
“That was nice,” Cas said.
“This was a bad idea,” Cas said, dropping his arms and standing in his normal posture. He turned to leave, hiding a red hue on his cheeks.
The second time she sees blood, she’s in a motel and Sam has gone to buy groceries. The stain is bright red and violent. “No, hey, I change my mind, I do want you,” she gasps. She places her hand on her still flat belly, “I take it back, I’m sorry, I want you. Stay.”
“Fine,” she responds, arms crossed across her ample chest. She leans down and kisses her sleeping son gently on the head. She gets up and helps Cas stand without waking little Jack. She kisses him again before kissing Cas. Dean can’t look away, it was such a gentle and familiar kiss between the couple. Sam shows Cas where to sleep, asking him questions about food and blankets on their way.
“You’re doing so well.” He leans over and kisses her forehead gently. Her face is sweaty and an angry shade of red, but she has to know he’s there for her.
“I felt something,” he says with a furrowed brow. “Something like me.”
