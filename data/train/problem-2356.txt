punch Mag- a blackmailer when he threatened my wife and tried to humiliate me. I think I only managed to refrain from violence in that moment by thinking of Rosie. It was only weeks before her birth. I knew I had a daughter coming into this world and I just kept thinking ‘the baby, the baby, I’m tolerating this for the baby’.”
"Alright."  John holds back a snigger.  "Well, then I'll go get a twister for myself," he says and takes a few steps towards the pier.
“Well, firstly we should tear down the wall to the storage room, to make us a bigger, more
It's a small family run business in a more residential area high up on the cliff behind the Marina, offering seven rooms, all decorated in different colour schemes and themes.  There's even a room, listed as the Ibiza Suite, featuring garish purple, pink and teal neon accents.  If John thinks Sherlock will stand for some 80's themed, hallucinogenic fixtures while he tries to sleep, he has another think coming.
In a way he has already grieved her. Grieved what could have been. He’s already lost her once. A long time ago, when the facade of Mary Watson cracked with the sound of a gunshot.
John sobs.
“I’m sorry I never said anything. About me being… queer too?”
"So, what are you thinking about the possible arsonist?" John asks, because he can see the gears are turning in Sherlock's mind.
He rings the doorbell and stands at parade rest, waiting.
“I’d rather taste you,” says John, reaching for Sherlock’s face, bringing them together in a deep kiss. He’s used to this now. A bit of public snogging. It’s their favourite pastime in Regent’s Park.
“Okay soldier, it’s your turn.”
“No-one will disturb us. I put up the cleaning sign outside, and barricaded the door with a broomstick. Don’t worry, just relax and let me-”
He really needs to make it more of a habit of going to the park with Rosie.
He fishes up is phone from the pocket of his jeans, careful not to disturb Rosie. He opens up the email app, and searches for Ella’s information.
"Of course," says John, feeling the golden light making him dozy.
"Why would he have gardening tools in his closet and not in the shed?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Rosie has made a large contribution to duck chasing. Otherwise, she’s turned out to be a very considerate little person. She wants to help others with everything; cutting up food, blowing on hot food, blowing where it hurts, putting on shoes, giving verbal encouragement for unqualified everyday tasks.
He leans back and closes his eyes.
"And you don't mind?"
Sherlock holds up his injured hand, with a face that says John is an idiot if he thinks Sherlock can use it to hold a razor.
Someone had done that once before. Or so he’d thought. Which was cutting in an indescribable way. The doubt. The possibility that he’d imagined it all - the prospect of love, the unspoken emotional reciprocity. And that it all had ended in disaster.
“Harry, I’m not judging you. Not at all. What you have managed to do is- it’s just extraordinary. To be able to take on that fight, again and again. I don’t know if I could have done it. I admire you.”
John stays the night.
Sherlock shrugs. "It's like she said--an ordinary, small cardboard box.  Apparently, she'd immediately put it to use as a container for bread-bag clips in her kitchen drawer."
“Shut up,” John grins. “You’ve clearly overdosed.”
He breathes deeply and presses play. Time to recalibrate.
“Alright. I only have a few more hours, though.”
how I hated him! You know about my foul mouth. I was rude, sarcastic, anything to keep those feelings at bay, to not let the hate eat me from the inside.”
Molly sighs.  "You'll just have to read the report, like everyone else.  All I can say is there were no signs of foul play."
"You give me everything I need, and I want to give you all I have."  John is achingly sincere.
Harry has had a clear preference since a young age: dark-haired girls with prominent cheekbones, looking vaguely South or Central American. Clara was just the first one in a long row of crushes who actually hit it off with Harry. Of course she was Spanish, not Nicaraguan, but there was still enough of a resemblance to Carrera that he could see the pattern.
“You know you’re not responsible for Sherlock’s addiction?”
There's a bang on the door.
Harry huffs, lights another cigarette.
It’s like they’re back to normal. Without cases they’re somehow leading parallel lives in the same flat.
Just as John returns to the main room, contemplating luring Sherlock away from the couch, by letting him rifle through his old army duffle, salvation comes in the form of a phone call.
“Of course. I had time to have a walk in Chelmsford after I met with Inspector Baynes. Let myself into the rugby club and found a binder with some very old team photos.”
--in an even more sinister way than when John was dressed in explosives.  It's a thought Sherlock can't shake off.  It made him recognise the necessity of omitting the fact that he'd just had tea with Moriarty in their flat, on the day when John came home from court, intensely worried about Moriarty's release.
“Come here.”
“You can’t save someone who doesn’t want to be saved. They’re not your patients, John.”
John signs them in and laughs rather oddly at something the young man says.  He grabs the key and is quick down the stairs.  Sherlock comes after, feeling his sore muscles ache with every step on the way down.  Their room is located on the souterrain floor of an extension at the back of the building, facing the garden and the sea.
John inserts himself between Sherlock and Miss Badu.
"How would you define 'something drastic'? What is it that you would be ready to do?"
”Sholto?”
Of course he can’t leave him like that. Of course he has to go back to the hospital, to a sleeping Sherlock in a hospital bed, just to see him one last time, his own knuckles still sore from the abuse he put him through.
“I do go to therapy.”
John's worry is heart-warming, but Sherlock's doubt is unbearable; he needs to spit it out, to explain why nothing is ever certain.  "Two components are necessary to experience an emotion--physiological arousal and a label for it.  As I told you yesterday, physiological states are ambiguous since there are numerous types of arousal.  You conceded it.  You need to understand that your emotional experience is malleable, since it partly depends on your interpretation of the situation which caused the physiological arousal."
Sherlock's being cryptic again.  "What are you saying?"
He breathes deeply, looking to the ceiling.
“I did.”
John doesn't like the tension in the room.
Moving back to Baker Street has lifted a heavy weight from his chest.
“You’re so reckless…” he breathes. “You’d do anything for a case, or to prove a point.”
"Christ!  You can count yourself lucky you didn't have to see that."  Lestrade looks around, as if he's about to let them in on a secret.  "Now, promise to keep mum about this--Anderson has taken a few days off."
"I was more thinking along the lines of who could have got to your necklace," says John.  "If there's spare keys, or lent out keys or such?"
“Because you stopped texting after I told you you deserve to be honest with yourself.”
Sherlock bursts out in a rapid-fire deduction, amazing as always, arms gesticulating, babbling too fast. He goes through the material in front of them, stating the facts, explaining the implications of the connections.
“Sounds like old times,” Sherlock shrugs casually. In fact it sounds even more like John is asking him to co-parent. Clearly he must have gotten the wording wrong due to the fragility of the moment.
"I can't really claim fidelity, because, you know, um... frequent dating and such.  But I haven't actually broken up with you either."
"John, please hold the torch for me.  No, closer, and tilt it a bit more.  Stop!  Perfect."
“Oh, sure, go ahead,” Sherlock says, sliding down comfortably in his chair, letting his arms rest wide open.
Sherlock narrows his eyes.  "You don't know?"
.  It's important."  Sherlock tilts his head to the side and lets his voice go smooth:  "Didn't I ask nicely?"
Sherlock is still. As still as he can be while his mind is actively processing. John quietly regards his poised body, still alive with fervid energy; he can almost literally see the cogs and gears turn and whirr in Sherlock’s head. Several minutes tick by in silence.
. In any capacity. Don’t let my poor communication skills make you doubt that.”
"Sarnies and champagne?  You're full of wonders, John."
"I'll text Lestrade."
“You know how it was. It was all sissy this and faggot that, poof here and queer there, and burn those disease spreading perverts and cut the balls off that fucking pedophile before he assaults our kids. Fucking Dad, and all other homophobes,” he spits with a sudden anger he hasn’t felt in many years, hasn’t directed to its source. “It wasn't anything I could ever talk to someone about. Not any way I could know that I wasn't abnormal, liking both boys and girls. But unlike you, I had a choice. I still liked girls and could ignore the other part, the sick part of me. I didn't have to put myself in your situation.”
"Why would someone burn the shed?" John prompts, hoping to draw him out.
He had invited Harry to plant the tomato seeds with Rosie. John and Rosie had spent weeks observing them through the condensation of the bottle ends, looking for signs of development each day.
“We’re not talking about me right now.”
“I don’t know. You don’t have the best track record when it comes to making choices that are in your best interest.”
"I'm a consulting detective, working with Inspector Lestrade who's in charge of this investigation."
Susan Cushing is, as Sherlock has already concluded, an elderly lady, residing on the bottom floor of the house.  Like Mrs. Hudson, she's renting out two rooms on the upper floor, and has been doing so 'for ages' (which equals since her retirement) to be able to afford to keep the house on her small pension.  It's been the same two tenants through most of the years: Wendy Badu, a fifty-something early years teacher, and the deceased, Brian James, a retired cab driver, who's at least twenty years younger than the landlady.
John shakes the envelope. ”It’s seeds. Tomato seeds.”
“So… John Watson, captain of the rugby team,” he muses.
Sherlock slides back along his length as he’s pulsing, maintaining the suction until he has caught all of John’s ejaculate.
"Right, so this stack from January to March has sixteen from Tesco Express, nine from Sainsbury's Local, two Lidl's and only one from Waitrose," Sherlock says as he points to each set.  "And then there's a few more from the bakery."
Sherlock is wonderfully scathing as he strips down every defence of the client’s uncle who, of course, is the real perpetrator. John loves seeing him come alive like this. Although the healing scar tissue flashes red, it manages to lift his spirits somewhat.
“You’re welcome,” says John, very aware of how that hairstyle came to be.
equipment?”
"You'll have to be a bit more specific, John," Sherlock says patiently, still bee-watching.  At this point he's disinclined to help.  He needs to hear whatever John has to say in his own words, to be able to make a rational decision about this mess.
“Her beehives?”
They continue to sort through close to two-hundred receipts, confirming each and every one of them listing the payment by the same card.
He all but runs to the bathroom.
John’s insecurities are surging through his mind now and he’s on the verge of sobbing, but Sherlock takes his hands in a tight grip.
"Salivation is just an automatic response," he whispers, cupping John's cheek, thumb ghosting over his cheekbone, feeling the slight stubble under his fingers as he lets go.
"Then tell me which is more probable: Miss Cushing storing the pickles for him, or Brian storing ridiculous amounts of salt for her?"
Most of the tubs are also occupied. There’s one for couples free. That feels a bit much at the moment. He doesn’t want Sherlock to think he’s assuming anything about their relationship status. Just as he’s about to give up on any chance of a semi-private conversation, two young women start to get up out of a tub. When they breach the surface, he notices they are both heavily pregnant. Probably third trimester. It occurs to him that he doesn’t know if Mary ever went to a spa during her pregnancy. In a rosy, romantic dream he would have treated her to it, making sure she got pampered while she carried the heavy burden of their child. But he’d been distant, shutting her out, grieving for the life that never was and his inability to make other choices.
“What's an ordinary day like now - what do you do?”
"Oh, for Christ's sake!"  John pauses his ministrations, squeezing his eyes shut for a moment, trying to ignore the bait.
Sherlock is in his pyjamas, lying down on the couch beneath a plume of cigarette smoke. He's wearing his silky blue dressing gown, splayed open, draped across the backrest.  Sherlock's been on edge ever since the shocking verdict of the Moriarty trial, and he's taken to chain-smoking indoors, too often.
They’ve always shared an inappropriate sense of humour.
He’d lost her, and now he’s losing Sherlock, too. Again.
"Are you saying you're solely interested in something long term?"
He needs to ask for forgiveness.
Rosie’s fringe has started falling into her eyes, so after breakfast, while she still sits firmly in her highchair, John plaits the long strands on the top of her head into french braids, as he did Harry’s when they were kids. Some things the body can’t forget, even if it was many years ago. Braiding and knotting macrame - he’s still got it in his hands.
He’s not really opposed to that thought. He sees the truth in it. But it’s not pleasant to feel like a victim of one’s circumstances. To fail so spectacularly not once, but twice. Both as a doctor and as a sibling and... partner? Working partner, friend. Knowing the medical protocol for alcohol poisoning and drug overdose didn’t help him one iota watching a loved one willingly destroy themselves.
“Why?”
“No, I wouldn’t.”
"No.  It's all very vague, isn't it.  They probably wouldn't listen to me--a confused old lady who can't keep track of her own receipts."
He didn't know how to feel about that.
They can’t have been old, early primary school? It must have been when Catherine’s friend Dorothy lived in the bedroom upstairs. He’s got a vague memory of her sewing doll clothes for Harry’s tiny fairy dolls out of the polyester petals of artificial flowers. They used to live among the long stalks of the lilies.
“Having a good time then?” she smiles wickedly.
She perks up, warily watching the movements of his bow arm. Eventually she seems content with her observations and her eyes start to droop.
John shifts his chair closer to Sherlock’s and stretches his leg across to rest his bare foot on the cushion, right beside where it dips under the weight of Sherlock’s thigh. He lets his toes work the buttery leather, reveling in the sensual feeling as it slides against his skin. Sherlock seems enraptured by the movement, a fine shine of sweat glittering off his forehead.
“Sit with me.” Sherlock kisses his every fingertip.
"Oh, really?"  John quickly catches on.  He's not oblivious, but he is purposeful in being disarmingly flirty.  "Is that so?"
“No.” He really doesn’t.
Rosie is wielding the magnifying glass Sherlock gave her on her birthday, and he crouches down beside her to show her how to use it properly. They are both clearly in their element when they’re out cataloguing plants and insects.
"I'm not the police," Sherlock says simply.  "And there are way bigger fishes to catch."
and no-one else.  Why would he, at that point--yes, considering
“Oh.”
And then the anger recedes and he just feels empty and useless. What the hell did he just do?
It’s a stab to the heart. She’s forgiven him, but he doesn’t know how to let it go. So many years of guilt, pushed to the side unacknowledged, still able to burn in his throat.
“Shut up.”
"Yes."
"Oh, you, too."  Sherlock narrows his eyes.  "What kind of flowers?"
"I'm the berk?  I at least know my own feelings on the matter."  He gets in John's face, almost nose to nose.  "What do you have, John Watson?  A duffle bag full of trauma, a psychological fear of commitment and a knee-jerk reaction to anything that doesn't fit the scope of your world!"
“Harry,” he sighs. “I’m so very sorry for not being there for you. But I couldn’t do it anymore. Couldn’t watch you-”
”I’m sorry for being a coward. I’m sorry for never telling you how much you meant to me. And sorry for not - for not seeing.”
"Nice!"  The dome is impressive at this height and rather short distance away.  John smiles to himself.  "It reminds me of the London skyline of the Thames Television ident on the telly back in the day."  He hums the short tune.
He’s grateful to have helped John strap it on a few times in the past, but it’s still a struggle since Rosie currently is contrary to everything. He eventually manages to strap her on, tummy to tummy, but she’s rubbing her tear-streaked cheeks against his chest, soaking his shirt, and straining against the carrier, bringing up her feet as she tries to get leverage on Sherlock to stand up.
“It’s not actually pesticide. Just plain soft soap and water, given the lack of enough ladybirds. I’m not completely heartless. I do care for Mother Earth.”
“And then I blamed him for the death of my wife. And he
”Oh, God, Sherlock, I’m so, so sorry.”
She shrugs.
didn't even ask me to come to your daughter's christening! Or your wife's funeral.”
John’s already comfortable in a plush seat in a recess, the small table in front of him filled with bottles of mineral water, hibiscus tea and small Turkish Revani cakes that look like petit fours.
Sherlock raises his brows. John clears his throat.
“It really isn’t. Not if I’m an abuser.”
He’s not having any of Sherlock’s accusations and lashes out at him, but Sherlock ducks smoothly, before running off after him. Of course Sherlock takes unnecessary risks, following the man up the scaffolding, in the dark. Of course John has to intervene and save that bastard completely lacking in self-preservation. When all is done - with the culprit sitting in the back of a police car, and they’ve been back on safe ground for at least half an hour - John is still trying to get his breathing under control. He’s not panting from running. He just has this worry that won’t subside. He rakes his fingers through his hair, but can’t keep quiet.
John isn't used to seeing Sherlock this affected by an injury.  Yes, they've had close calls in the past two years, what with the damn fool almost letting himself get killed the very day they met, but this is different.  A little more than a scratch, but an immediate impairment.
Before they leave the pier, John buys two ice lollies, and asks for directions to the nearest pharmacy.
"Oh, please!"  Sherlock rolls his eyes, clearly not in the mood.  He turns up the light of the screen to the max, then leans over the phone and squints again.
His flirting with E had been as much attention seeking and ego licking as it was a test of Mary's commitment. She was
The three of them had spent all morning at the back of the house. John had sent pictures to Harry. She’d returned them with a blurry picture of her bare ankles, intertwined with another couple of tan, decidedly female ones. He could almost make out the African lilies in the background. He’d felt an unexpected pang of compassion and nostalgia. It seems he’s turning more maudlin day by day.
“Just- I know I didn’t want to hear this myself, and you were very stubborn, which I kind of hated you for, but loved you even more for it, even if I didn’t say… So, I’ll say, sincerely, the same thing you told me for years -
"We need lunch anyway," John says, placatingly.  "It's way past lunchtime, almost dinner."
Do you want to keep living like that?”
"Right."  She studies him for a moment, then turns her back to him and puts her hands on her hips, sighing as she takes in the room.
”What? No. No I didn’t-”
John covers his face with his hands and turns onto his side into a foetal position.
“It’s beautiful. It really is.”
“Doesn’t mean I want to babysit her all the time,” she warns.
“The sycamore tree behind Mrs Turner’s. The one with the snot green hanging flower heads. The one that spreads an annoying stickiness over everything in the back. It creates copious amounts of pollen for the bees!”
“Because you’re stubborn as hell. When you decide you’re in for something, you’re hellbent on following through. And the vague promise of
Sherlock scowls.  "Do you really believe that Susan Cushing would come up with the elaborate idea, of trying to drive her own sister 'round the bend, to make her seem demented and ready for a care home, all by herself?"
They’ve not discussed it, but John doesn’t protest as much as Sherlock expected. He seems to appreciate when Sherlock steps in. A single parent has limited room to decline help. After all, there’s only 24 hours a day, and he needs to rest sometimes.
"Indeed," Sherlock muses.  "Why Japanese knotweed?"
He’d do better by her, make sure to say those words while he had the chance. Make sure he wouldn’t lose what they had. It was time to finally say goodbye to the spectre that had haunted him for nearly two years.
“How would I know you’d want to come to her funeral? You haven’t been in contact with her for what? Fifteen years? Not since Mum passed.”
“Harry. I’m just asking. I’m interested, okay? I do care.”
"You heard me."
He hates it.
. When John was at his lowest, there was still an
“I got accepted into med school after barely three months of basic training, just in time for me to be allowed to terminate it. I did medicine for many years, as a student and as a professional. And then my dad died in a bland fucking car accident, and I hated him for it. So then the military became a thing again. I had begun specialist training, and the army needed surgeons and trauma specialists, so I applied to the Professionally Qualified officers training course and went to Sandhurst for ten weeks. When I had worked long enough for the RAMC as a Medical Officer, I was ranked Captain.”
Sherlock blinks a few times, still squatting on top of the desk. He opens his eyes fully and stares at John, his gaze confused, searching. He briefly glances to the wall,
Mycroft calls as soon as they exit the building. John can only hear Sherlock's side of the very short conversation, but it seems to be enough to throw him into a barely suppressed fit of giggles.
it.  At least I don't know of any way to prove it, other than just doing it."
Sherlock nods and folds the letter into the envelope, then placing it in his jacket pocket.  "Don't feel bad about it, John.  Even with the additional letter, I'd probably have continued to ignore it, as it could well have been some aspiring gonzo journalist, desperate to get my attention after the general hysteria in the press."
her.  I said that I
"Oh, shut up!"  Sherlock sneers.
It's a seemingly ordinary garden shed: old and somewhat rickety, in a clear state of disrepair, on the verge of decay, with greenery growing in through cracks in the floor and along the back wall.  A workbench beneath a tiny window holds ordinary gardening tools, presenting an array of potential murder weapons.  Plenty signs of wear, though no traces of current use.  There's dust all over, undisturbed, which in itself is a story.  Dust, or lack thereof, reveals multitudes.  Marks on the floor shows that the chair has been repeatedly dragged across the floor between the door and the workbench, in search of daylight.  A closer look at the legs of the chair makes it clear that the dragging motion was done a long time ago, as the coloration of the scratch marks on the wood has darkened with age.  In a corner are yellowed, pulverised traces of ether-based polyurethane, degraded.  No inner ceiling, low roof, rusty nails on the wooden beams.  Traces of textile, brown and orange, that he suspects came from foam-filled seat pads for garden chairs which have been stored for winter, lying across the narrow beams.  It looks as if they've snagged on a nail when taken down.  No signs of such seat pads in the garden.  Probably from the 60's or 70's by the garish colour scheme.  Most likely unrelated.  Except for an older manual push mower in the corner beside the door, with dried grass-clippings beneath it, there's nothing else that shows that the shed's been utilised in months.
Sherlock seems rooted in place.  Still, if not exactly tranquil.  If they were in a different situation, John would have assumed he was in his Mind Palace.  But his eyes are open; John can see them when he leans slightly forward.  Sherlock's dark blue shirt sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, one bare forearm resting on a raised knee as observes the waves.  Or is he merely seeing them?  He might well see nothing in front of him; John can't tell.  He looks calm, focused... and all too beautiful.  The breeze has messed up his curls, swept them away from his brow towards his temples, where they lift and sway against his ears and cheek.  He needs a haircut, but John is loath to see Sherlock trim one of his most distinctive features.  The sun brings out the auburn in his hair, and his stubble glitters in golden and rusty tones.  Lips are a bit dry and chapped, as they usually get when he's been pushing himself, ignoring sleep and forgetting to at least drink water when he refuses to spend time on eating.  His dark eyelashes cast shadows beneath his eyes as he squints slightly.   Mesmerising.  Perfectly within reach.
"Hey, great to have you here!"  Lestrade frowns a bit as he takes in Sherlock's appearance.  "New look?"
“What about Catherine? Why wouldn’t you talk to her? Why didn’t you trust her to keep your secret?”
John finds papery pants at the bottom of the basket, supposed to be worn under the towel during massage for added modesty, but Sherlock scoffs at their ugliness, declaring he’d rather go in the buff.
“You don’t have to convince me. I’m not
One point of contact.
Having John in his life, in as much as he can be persuaded to, is Sherlock’s main goal. But for a period of time, mainly since he shot Magnussen dead, he’d been sure that John was over any attraction he might have felt. He’d last seen it on full display during John’s stag night. But he’d dismissed it as drunken nostalgia.
Sherlock’s bee symphony
"You've wrapped your hair," Sherlock observes.  "A damp cotton wrap to prevent the synthetic weave in your braids from melting by the heat of the flames.  I bet you scorched your hair last time, when you lost control of the fire.  If you'd remove that wrap, I'd see some melting."
's miniature sailors had found a home there.
He swallows. There’s the familiar ache of regret.
“What made you come here now, after all these years?”
John can’t wrap his head around that. The longest relationship he’s been able to maintain was with Mary. But that had been broken up by a long estrangement, when he had to step away, and then once more when it was Mary who left. Even though his current state of relationship with Sherlock is very new, he’s the person John’s known longest, besides old mates and of course his sister. Sherlock is also the person he’s loved longest.
“Aren’t you?” Sherlock raises a brow, smirking. “You said you weren’t in combat.”
The panic eventually subsides, but John’s too overwrought to speak. He opens his eyes and, in the hopes of this moment going somewhere, before it’s too late, he tugs on Sherlock’s hands, wanting him to get off the desk. There’s nothing else to do than to continue with this madness that he’s started.
“Oh?”
.  Just the letters."
John and Sherlock are standing on each side of the desk, chairs pushed out of the way and abandoned in the intensity of staring at the mass of notes and photos pinned to the wall beneath the bison skull - a satellite of the usual wall of clues over the sofa.
possible."
advocating
"I will speak with the manager and she will talk to the gardener."  The young man smiles, with a hint of nervousness.  Sherlock must have had a word with him during the night.  It amuses John, and warms his heart.
"You see, those letters had me worried.  Not at first, though."  She nibbles on a ginger nut.  "It was only odd.  I never told poor Brian, or Wendy; there's no need to worry your tenants if you're not even sure it's anything more than a prank.  But, then they kept coming, and I couldn't wrap my head around it.  So, I thought, this sounds like the perfect peculiar mystery a private detective could work out."
"Or someone wants to put blame on him, but he died because of his own stupidity, before they managed to kill Miss Cushing."  It's a possibility that seems increasingly more likely.
He will manage, today and forward, but he’s still counting the hours until bedtime.
"Well, I can't be sure.  Brian brought me the mail.  He always does."
Dressed in swimming trunks and wrapped in a fluffy towel, John sets out to investigate the first room. He’s carrying his basket kit along as instructed, feeling a bit like he’s having a picnic. There are several hydrotherapy tubs of different sizes lowered into the floor, a cold pool and the entrance door to the sauna. He realises there are designated shelves for the baskets and pegs for the bathrobes right by that door.
It’s over almost before it starts. Sherlock kisses the head of John’s cock, works back his foreskin with lips and tongue. John involuntary lifts his arse off the seat, thighs already cramping.
"No, you thought so.  I could tell."  He works his way over Sherlock's cheek with light strokes.
"I haven't thought of their particular names, but the ones he's planted here, I guess."  She turns to John.  "Maybe you can tell me then, as Mr Posh doesn't deign to answer.  Do you know who killed Brian?"
”Jesus!” He pinches the bridge of his nose. She’s really talking about their own parents, isn’t she?
“Nevermind,” he starts again. “Sherlock pushed me to get back with Mary. That’s mainly it. So I did the honourable thing. But I was crap at it. I almost missed Rosie’s birth because I was too wrapped up in following Sherlock on cases. Well, partly it was because Mary had a rather fast labour progression. A first time delivery usually-”
There’s his absolution, freely given from a man with too big a heart.
John catches on to the unfurling drama.  "Oh, poor boy."
Because they haven’t finished their conversation, and John’s not done confessing.
He sits down under the bare hanging branches, leans his back against the tree. He brings out his headphones and turns his face to the sun. He needs a moment to find the energy to return home to the life with a toddler.
"You mean she lied to your face?" John sounds sceptical.  "Even when you practically raged at her?  I don't think she's smarmy enough to pull that off."
"I noticed he was depressed, all right.  I didn't know he was medicating."
"That meddling bastard," Sherlock grouses.
"Or, she's faking it all for my attention."  Sherlock shrugs.
"Oh."  The charming face falls.  "Um, I'm sorry."
John sits down in the niche farthest from the door. There’s no-one else in here. Sherlock comes after. Lithe and mysterious in the darkness and foggy atmosphere. John’s eyes goes to his hip bones, follows the line of his iliac crest until it disappears under the towel.
"You don't need to worry about Miss Cushing.  Lestrade has granted protection if she chooses to go back to her house," Sherlock reassures.  "But there's something missing: a motive.  Who's her enemy?"
Sherlock smirks.
"And you were right."
“You know why.”
It's the southernmost street of the cliff, and the houses along it have their gardens extending on the southern slope running down towards the A259 and the cliff edge beyond.  There's a wide expanse of fields and shrubbery on the east side of the building.  It looks a bit small to offer seven rooms, but Sherlock knows that appearances are deceiving.
He wonders if Sherlock misses him. If he understands why John suddenly has become so busy. If staying clean drives Sherlock mad. If he’s having setbacks.
"I was convinced there was a professional behind this.  The lack of fingerprints, or any other traces on the letters, guaranteed the anonymity of the sender.  But this-" Sherlock gestures towards the charred remnants of the shed.  "-this tells me that it's an attempted cover-up.  It also tells me that the person behind this isn't quite the type I was envisioning."
he eat without killing himself?"
He makes a happy little jump and suddenly he climbs the desk, squatting down, narrowly missing John’s laptop.
“There’s no excuse for what I did. I caused a lesion on his left eyebrow, nosebleed, gave him a swollen eye, a broken blood vessel in his sclera, kicked his guts. No excuse.”
“I understand that. But you are. You and I both.”
Harry rolls her eyes. “Oh, for God’s sake, John, she was a
So they do.
She throws him a look, huffs.  "You know, it's not clear to me if you're attempting to mock me or-"
“The exposure,” she says with a wink.
"Ca-tching!" says Sherlock, taking off his dressing gown with a twirl, in a sudden burst of energy and humour.  He throws the dressing gown over the back of a kitchen chair and continues to the corridor with a springy step.  John leans against the kitchen doorframe.  "Cushing in Croydon?" he asks, worried.
Sherlock shoves him.
"Miss Badu's a teacher.  Just think of much of a poker face you'd need to deal with the kid's parents."  He guides John away from the ride and towards the Fun Palace and Side Shows.  "She might have a talent for keeping information to herself without letting it on."
John's eyes are warm, waiting.  "Is this a speech?"
“I generally kicked furniture when I found out about my wife’s lies. Threatened to hit Sherlock when he seemed to blame me for her lies. I didn’t mean it of course. I truly didn’t. If I did, I wouldn’t be here, trying to move on after- after actually battering him. It never occurred to me that I would ever be in a situation where I’d do it.”
“No. No, you’re not insulting me. Of course you’ve wanted coke more than- than this- whatever it is, which is very new, very uncertain and possibly a very bad idea,” John nods to himself while speaking.
"But you didn't read up on it until after you knew what caused Brian's death."
"Ugh, fine!  Hypertension brought this on.  He died from an aneurysm.  Happy now?"
John doesn't really believe in the good cop, bad cop strategy, but he feels inclined to offer some comfort to Miss Badu, as she's been caught red-handed and it's clear Sherlock has the upper hand.  "Miss Badu, we passed a bench a few lots down the path.  Would you like to sit down?"
. He deserved every fucking obstacle and hardship coming his way.”
“You posh, dirty git,” John smiles.
Sherlock goes on full alert - this isn’t about his fall, it’s about John’s guilt.
“Rosie.”

"Se anything familiar?  Japanese knotweed,
"Um."  John hesitates, looking to Sherlock.
"Oh, I'm glad," says Greg, surprised.  "You're not questioning their capability."
“He seems very thirsty and suddenly drinks a lot more. There’s more pee than usual in his nappies. What if he’s got diabetes?!”
Sherlock swallow and tilt his head and it’s instantly over.
He’d been in a severe place at the time.
Harry tugs his hand.
”What?”
"Yeah, I know.  You will
A somewhat tense dinner follows.
He barely avoids the usual reflexive dissociating tone of those last two words.
He still feels their relationship is fragile, but Sherlock had said
He’s only fallen in love with men three times.
“Mary did some unforgivable things. Lied about her past. Led a double life. Deceived me. But I wasn’t good to her even before that. Wasn’t comfortable in that life. Married, living in the suburbs, doing locum work.”
John doesn’t tell Harry about Sherlock’s offer. Or him readily accepting. But she seems to have a sixth sense just to be able to prod him.
Sherlock looks annoyed.
The sheets are wet from his sweat. He has to take several deep breaths before he can move. He sits up. His heart is still beating hard, but he has to do something to get rid of the images that linger in his mind, so he gets out of the bed. He stumbles to the nursery to check on Rosie, only to find her fast asleep. He must have dreamed her cry intermingling with his own.
He shrugs.
"I'm not asking you to let me in on every thought that passes through your head, but when you've found something out, share it with me.  Okay?"  John sits down beside him again, trying to catch his gaze.  "Invite me into your reasoning, and if I'm capable, I'll follow.  Just don't keep me out."
"Of course.  Not close friends, but he was a good egg.  He kept mostly to himself.  He used to help Miss Cushing with the lawn and other stuff.  And, he's spent a lot of time here at the allotment.  I think he started gardening once he retired."
She catches it effortlessly, eyes narrowed.  "It's half past midnight and I want you out of here, right now," Sally commands.  "How did you even get in here?"
Having scant slumber the previous evening, Sherlock nearly falls asleep, but this time, he has the prescience to acknowledge the fact and takes time to arrange his coat on the grass, before laying down properly and seeking respite.  When he wakes, he's quite sure John is sitting closer than before, having taken up the space where Sherlock sat previously.  That is unusual, he recognises.
And it feels wrong, saying it like this, once again putting Mary between them, and suddenly the words fall out of him, words to make things right.
“Oh, God, Sherlock. I’m so sorry. Oh, God, I’m so sorry. What have I done to you?”
“Sorry, sorry! That came out all wrong. I’m sorry.”
“That's outdated, and discredited! It’s not science based. Show me something based on modern studies. Is he a paediatrician? Is he an accredited child psychologist? No! Why does this so-called 'expert' even open his mouth when he can’t even refer to his sources properly? The curse of the internet, and Youtube in particular, is that all kinds of people who are challenged in the intelligence department, find it their mission to spread their wisdom.”
Sherlock notes the tell-tale signs of a bad day at work: hair a bit ruffled, jacket unbuttoned, thrown on in a hurry, fists clenched until his knuckles are white. Clearly, John is upset, but Sherlock can’t quite make out what’s going on in his face. He looks devastated, but also ready to pick a fight. Sherlock can’t make sense of this.
John stands up and goes outside to Sherlock, just catching the end of a conversation.
"I still need to help Miss Cushing out with the patch in the garden.  Now that the surface is burned, at least I can start digging up the roots during winter, when the plant is dormant."
' happening!" Lestrade all but shouts, pointing a finger at John.
John sighs, long-suffering, picks them up and plunks them in the basin with the rest.  "Want me to rinse your socks, too?"
John looks stricken. He draws in a breath, eyes scattering about not landing anywhere.
She looks different. But it feels like no time has passed at all.
"Yeah, you've said that repeatedly.  So let me take your word for it.  Hang on."  John pulls out his phone.  Luckily he gets through immediately.  "Hi Sally, it's John Watson.  Are you with Miss Cushing right now?  Susan Cushing that is.  Great!  I have a very important question for you: exactly when did Miss Cushing receive the flower bouquet?  Mhm, sure, I'll wait."
He admires her patience. He’s a middle-aged man who’s never really talked about his feelings and hates being confronted with his fears and failings. He knows he’s a nightmarish patient, all doctors are. How bored she must be, with their endless quiet sessions without any visible progress. He presses a tissue at his eyes. It’s a calm, very still crying, no big gulping sobs or wailing. It feels like grief over something he cannot have. Stability, love.
“There’s no need to be sorry. Take your time. I’m just reminding you that all those thoughts running through your head now can be let out, if you allow it. That’s why I’m here.”
“She wasn’t planned. I thought I was sterile.”
It feels good, working quietly side by side with Harry. Takes his mind off things.
Harry is enthused. She even starts headbanging with her now shoulder length hair.
“Who did you think Dorothy was? Did you think she was a
.  In this case, there's far too many of them.
“Sorry for-” he mumbles, tying his shoelaces. “See you in a bit.”
"Either way, I need to be there.  We'll drop in on Molly first, then head straight to the allotment.  There's something missing in these photos from Donovan.  There's something I'm not seeing."
Any chair forgotten in an upright position is pushed around by Rosie, to be used as a ladder to higher levels.
“It’s alright. I mean, if we had to go, even in a bloody train car, of course we’d go together.”
Eventually John calms, sits up. Sherlock stands, extends his hand, takes John’s hand in his and pulls him up off the floor. John avoids his gaze.
He wants to stay forever.
Something is niggling at John's brain about the drug.  "They're known to potentially have severe dietary interactions, unless you keep a controlled diet."
It’s his home. It’s his stability.
She doesn't seem to notice the odd use of 'young' about a man in his sixties. But then, she's old enough to be his mother, so in this context, he's surely a youngster.
They’d played with the fairies in the garden. Hours upon hours dreaming away into a fantasy land with a small family of fairies. It had been their secret garden, their secret game. A world of their own, safe behind the high garden walls covered in winding wisteria. No-one would know. Know of John playing with girl’s stuff, of them playing out their dream of an alternative family, where everyone loved each other, and wasn’t afraid to say so.
John scoffs.  "Right."
But he can’t meet Sherlock, can’t look him in the eye, can’t hand over that letter. He hides instead. Goes into the bedroom and swallows down a big gulp of numbness from the bottle that has somehow migrated to under the bed.
“Yes, you have,” he says reverently.
"I've already gone over this, John.  It's simple.  As with the whole trial, it's to advertise his capabilities.  Moriarty loves the media coverage, he needs an audience."
For the first time ever he cries in a therapy session, quietly, a hand shielding his eyes. It feels odd, exposing.
The next time Sherlock had come around, Rosie was a very happy baby, freshly burped after her meal, sitting up in her booster seat, enthusiastically waving her arms and kicking her legs.
Sherlock’s come to the conclusion that crawling is a deceptive skill.
He manages to get Harry to himself for a bit, when he follows her out for her second smoke. He could tell from Sherlock’s smell that he’d been scrounging on her batch, when they returned from the first.
He doesn’t consider himself sentimental, but being back in Chelmsford stirs up memories. If he’d name two people who defined his childhood and youth, it wouldn’t have been his parents.
"John!  Pickpocket!"  Sherlock points towards the nearest stalls.  "Stealing from a
It was awkward, being back with Ella. During the session he’d felt bad for briefly going to another therapist, for not going back to Ella when he’d lost someone again.
There is something nagging Sherlock's mind, but it's just out of reach.  Only a slight irritation telling him there's something he should pay attention to.
”It is what it is.”
They sit down on top of their coats, roughly at the same spot where they sat previously.
Sherlock doesn't even have the energy to acknowledge the statement. He has lost all motivation from this tedious exercise.  They've only confirmed that they know nothing more than what Miss Cushing's already told them.
"A kiss is merely an action, not a reaction.  I could kiss anyone for a case."
Sherlock brings out his pocket magnifier and studies the envelopes while lighting them up with a small torchlight between his teeth.  They're all postmarked in central London, which indicates absolutely nothing more than that the individual behind it does know how to increase the chances of staying anonymous. The envelopes are incredibly clean; no visible traces of fingerprints, skin oils, smudges or smells.
"I mentioned it to Brian.  He was the one who carried it out.  The knotweed spreads along roadsides and riverbanks, and Brian knew just where to find some.  He asked his fly-fishing mates, they know everything about the streams nearby.  So by the end of last summer he brought it here to test it first, to see if he could make it grow. And it sure did, so he planted it behind the shed in Miss Cushing's garden too."
He returns to the present, noting that the hand, which delivered the matey shoulder clap, is still on his shoulder. He feels it slide down a fraction, turning into a warm presence, a grounding grip on his deltoid.
He'd always been good at seeming pleasant.
"Look at the date of her letter.  Ring any bells?"
But he has friends who sets him up to do what’s right, a scheduled redemption. He doesn’t believe in it, he’s still so tired, his heart not in it. They take turns caring for Sherlock when he goes cold turkey.
“Oh.”
He can’t help that that’s where his thoughts go. The whole prospect of the day is both weird and a bit arousing.
Still, he has never said it out loud.
Mary shifts her heavily pregnant body beside him. John tries to concentrate on the comforting scent of her hair, her measured breathing… anything that will absolve him of the guilt creeping its way into his mind and heart.
“What’s it like?” Harry wonders softly. “Having a daughter?”
Because he knew she’d have wanted him to be open, supportive, exposing himself like she had done. And he just couldn’t do that.
intervene. But then...”
“So are you planning to live here or-?”
They follow it to the end station and Sherlock is ready to give up, but John pushes on since they can see the billowing waves crash in against the breakwater shielding the Marina.  They pass along graffitied concrete, soon realising they'd severely underestimated the distance.  The breakwater is huge.
"Fine."
"So, what now?" John asks.  "Examine the gardening tools, or visit the allotment?"
John and Sherlock part ways, since Sherlock is adamant on paying a visit to Inspector Baynes to convince him of the need to investigate the suspicious brick wall.
John clears his throat, no doubt hoping to shift the focus away from him.  "Did Miss Cushing say what kind of threats she'd received?"
"Sally's sent some photos. Hold on," says John, breathlessly, one hand still on Sherlock's chest.
John goes into the kitchen to inspect the freezer for ice cubes.  He closes the glass doors behind him to hopefully limit the amount of smoke that drifts in from the main room.  The ice cube tray is predictably empty, so he fills it up with fresh water, contemplating whatever they could have for dinner, that isn't in any way hot.
She sits in her cot, gripping the bars and looking like a prisoner contemplating escape plans. Sherlock wouldn’t be surprised if she was. It’s too easy to underestimate the intellect and escapologist skills of a child.
John notices Sherlock looking at him, watching his body. They’ve sat like this another time, only John was the one looking, and fully clothed. It had been so silly, Sherlock in a sheet. Then John had seen a glimpse, thanks to Mycroft’s pettiness. Now he’s seen more than ever. Though it’s dark, the scars are still visible. The one Mary put there, and the one he’s responsible for.
or like
Of course there is, but John's reluctant to admit it.  He slathers the foam along Sherlock's jawline.
"The bees aren't active at night, or else you would have recognised the sound."
are the words for a case in the Scandinavian languages.  If he owes me a
"So if he really has that code, why not use it to break in at the highest military facility there is?  He'd be able to control weapons.  He could start a war.  But, he chose to open the Bank of England,  Pentonville Prison and the Tower of London.  Why these exact locations?  And why do it openly and simultaneously, if not to gain massive media coverage?"
Harry’s right, of course, but this truly guts him.
. More like… the only thing I knew how to do. Act out and provoke and possibly make him throw me out.”
"Come here," he says softly, wrapping his arms around Sherlock.  They embrace tightly for a long while, until Sherlock's breathing calms.  John holds him tenderly, his mouth is on his cheek, in an almost kiss.  Hot humidity wafts over Sherlock's skin when John starts speaking, low and gentle:
“Sharing my life with you is in my best interest.”
"I know he's terrifying, Sherlock,"  says John, reaching over the table to place his hand over Sherlock's.  "But he's boasting.  He wants to keep your attention, intimidate you, drag you into his games."
!" Sherlock exclaims with a look that's meant to invoke that John is being slow.
“But you did, over and over again.”
Sherlock hums, meeting John's eyes.
the shed.  But what if he kept knotweed samples in there somewhere?  I couldn't sleep that night; I wanted the damned weed gone.  Those pickles would be evidence of Brian handling the plant.  Even if he's dead, I wouldn't want him to be remembered as the retired weed-wielding pickling vigilante.  So I figured it best to burn it all, but the officers hung around until very late.  Sergeant Donovan had left me her number, so I called her to make a complaint about your insensitive 'questioning'.  I'm not intimidated by bullies like you, but it seemed a safe course of action to pre-emptively blame my nerves on the situation with you, in case I would be questioned about the fire.
John repeats what Sherlock just said, into the phone.
John presses his lips together, his temper rising by the second and he can’t, doesn’t want to, subdue himself.
He had never imagined Sherlock being so- passionate, decadent. He had imagined things he’d like to do to him. He’s overwhelmed by Sherlock being so receptive, both pliant and indulgent. It felt as if they were doing everything
"Chasing birds?"
Sherlock scoffs.
They're back at Majida's.  John can't believe she's accepting their shoddy appearance in her restaurant when there's other customers around.  Majida readily reserved the table in the farthest corner for them.  Quite prescient of her.  She must have been in a dire situation when Sherlock helped her out.
"Target practise," Sherlock whispers and winks.  Then he pulls John's SIG-Sauer out of his coat pocket and puts it in John's hand.  John glares daggers at him in the dark, but the weight of the gun in his hand is still comforting.  Sherlock raises his brows in inquiry and John nods silently.  They step out from behind the Japanese knotweed not-hedge, simultaneously, and in one smooth motion John takes aim at the figure standing in Brian James' lot.
“What did you feel in that moment?”
Yesterday, after long weeks of waiting, the seeds had completed their transformation into proper seedlings, ready to be potted outside.
John grins.  "Fight, flight or fuck--don't forget about fuck!"
They were quite successful and even accomplished squeezing some cases in. But John had been worried about Sherlock. He’d been too wrapped up in the cases, like a squirrel on speed, running around gathering clues in an inhuman tempo, even more frantic than he had been in the old days.
For all his fumbling with men in the dark, and that one drunk blowjob he can’t quite remember, he’s never had a proper real life close up of another man’s erection, never been able to see, observe. It’s beautiful and incredibly hot, as is everything about Sherlock.
“See, I knew it!”
Before Lestrade can respond, there's a commotion behind the screen outside of the door.  Angry voices.  Lestrade disappears around the screen and comes back in an instant.
The most pressing question now is, who would know of this place?  Who would want to put blame on Brian?  Sherlock is not sure how the motive fits in, but there's too many coincidences to ignore.  He needs to be sure.
John helps dig out the magnifying glass from Sherlock's inner coat pocket.  He leans in closer than strictly necessary, just to get a whiff of him.  He gives Sherlock a smug smile.
He leans further in, letting his hand slide up Sherlock’s sinewy thigh. He strengthens his grip as he goes, until his fingers are boring deep enough to make Sherlock gasp and wriggle, raising a tent in his fine trousers.
“I wasn’t
“I- I should care. Another person wants my company. That’s- that’s great. I like girls, erm, women…” he chuckles nervously. “I’ve never been the best boyfriend. Hence my short relationships, I guess.”
"All right then," Sherlock murmurs and raises his plastic glass, the champagne glinting in the afternoon sun.  "To the sea, and to us."
John is a frequent napper.  The
"Yeah, it's not easy to give you praise, 'cause there's a fine line between you being chuffed or insulted."
“Yeah, can you believe it? But now she’s here so I gotta make it work.”
“Umm…”
“No, you’re wrong. I’d do anything for you and Rosie.”
Sherlock laughs.  "Why?  I can't accept that title without a thorough explanation."
He barely has time to register the small smile forming on Sherlock's lips, before he whirls around and sets off towards the restaurant, John struggling to keep equal steps with him.
The free hand-out of chips has naturally attracted more seagulls.  One of them pilfers a chunk of fish from the boy's hand.  He becomes upset.
have something to do with ceasing breastfeeding.“
Sherlock regards him, quietly.
“I didn’t want to fight you, I saw what you were going through. If Mary’s death taught me anything besides the terrible ramifications of being overconfident, it was that it made me see
"Every evening, you tie your braids up and wrap them in silk, to protect the hair from wearing when you sleep."
"Okay.  Right."  John rises, looking a bit displeased with the fact that this little adventure seems to be over.
“Yeah?”
John is so very touched when he realises what it is. He needs to rest his head in his hands and breathe, breathe. Sherlock comes to him and embraces him from behind.
"That-“ John swallows. "Didn't really expect you to ask that."
Maybe he should have given her credit for overlooking his missteps. For trying so hard to become Mary Watson.
This is cheating; John touches what he observes, distracting him.  He lets his fingertips follow the flush, trailing down along Sherlock's neck, eliciting a shudder.  Then he changes the angle of his finger, making the edge of his nail slowly make an imprint on it's way downward.  All the way to Sherlock's collarbone, effectively stealing his focus.
He had draped his towel over his shoulders, whenever it wasn’t wrapped around his hips. Had let John lead the way, purposely falling behind to make sure that he always had his front towards John. Discreetly turned his body if he had John at the wrong angle. He’d hurried ahead of John to have a quiet word with the massage therapists, giving them a discreet heads up on the state of the skin on his back.
Sometimes John feels very sympathetic towards Ella. When he has to guide a patient to see what’s obvious, preferably with diplomatic restraint.
Molly manages a small smile.  "It's all right.  I'm off to a date, and I'm very happy about it."
"He mentioned fairytales and the code he used for the break-ins."  Sherlock sighs at the absurdity of that conversation.  "I did tell you about the code," he adds.  "I don't keep everything to myself."
"John, I-"
is a very good question, John."  Sherlock presses the tips of his index fingers to his lips.  "Though it bugs me that Miss Badu tried to give the impression that she doesn't know who I am."
'.  What did he mean by '
"John, I believe this warrants a toast."  They let go of each other's hands and raise their glasses.  Sherlock feels warm inside.  It's imperative he makes his position clear to John.  Now.
, acting like it was all a bloody joke. We were thrown out. Then I jumped him in a café. He’d treated me like shit, letting a whole bunch of people know that he was alive, but kept me in the dark, as if
"There's no hint of tremor in your hand," Sherlock observes.  "Your hands are only this steady in the face of danger."
John buys a toastie wrapped in a napkin, and has managed to eat it all by the time they reach the lift.  He really is a sloppy, but effective eater.  He's dabbing his mouth for crumbs, as Sherlock pushes the top floor button.  John's phone pings in tune with the doors when the lift stops.
They reach another curved groyne, just as the last fishers are packing up their gear.  John and Sherlock pass them, walking out to the rising water, the mortared flint walls of the groyne shielding them from the rushing tide.  The accelerating intensity of the weather makes Sherlock feel warm and relaxed on the inside, strong and resilient in body, at least as long as he has his coat on.  All except for his weakened hand.
Sherlock arches a brow.  "No."
”I remember.”
"Good, because you should definitely not try to text using this thumb."
Miss Badu seems shaken.
John is lucky.  There's few customers in the pharmacy, so he manages to stay true to his word and is in and out in less than two minutes.  He grins at Sherlock when he returns with a pack of crepe bandage in hand.  When he's put it in the backpack, they make their way back to the beach.
"I- I don't..."  Sherlock stops.
Sherlock turns to the next pile.  "Grapes and apples.  Shreddies and beans.  Milk... eggs... tomatoes," he continues, but John's scribbling has stopped.
"Brian James."  He starts typing, awkwardly, with his left hand.  "He had some gardening tools in his closet, with the fishing gear.  A hand trowel and possibly hedge shears.  Honestly, I didn't get to have a closer look, thanks to bloody Donovan.  Can't believe I let it slip my mind.  I'm texting Lestrade."
on the other hand, the bricks have been removed, but when they put them back someone used Portland cement instead. It’s cheaper, but it doesn’t bond well with the lime mortar and it’s also impermeable to water. So it can trap moisture behind the bricks causing frost cracks. Or, like in this case, the moisture can’t evaporate through the cement mortar, so it’s pressed out through the brick, bringing lime and salt with it, creating this white spotty pattern.”
“It’s just simple cause and effect. There’s nothing in it making us lesser, unworthy. It’s just what it is. We’re not alone. I have many friends who-”
None of the things she says about him are true, can’t be true, because he’s a pathetic excuse of a human being who’s failed her. A
"Of course," says John, putting away the razor.
John’s emerging smile is a little wobbly.
Sherlock leans over and with absolute precision, he captures John’s right hand under water and holds tight.
Every word she says with her dying breath cuts through him. He just wants her to shut up because it isn’t true.
He needs to talk to John.
“Posh boy.”
Sherlock ignores the remark.  "Just fill me in."
"Doubt what?"  John is clearly disconcerted by Sherlock's behaviour.  "That she didn't hear or see anything?"
John feels utterly naked. A fluttering nervousness rises in his chest. All he can think of is shared showers after PE class and rugby, and in military quarters.
There's a temptation, surely.  And he's not really against giving in to it.  The only problem is what comes after... if there is an after.  It's possibly best to feign ignorance.
John huffs.  "'
"Sherlock, listen to me."  John searches Sherlock's eyes.  "Not every case coming your way is related to Moriarty.  Though, I'm sure that's what he'd want you to believe, just so he can mess with your head.  I know that verdict was a blow, but you need to get a grip.  Now.  Even when we first came out to Croydon, I saw that you were slipping.  That's why I wanted us to get out of town for a bit.  I saw you lying curled up on the couch in 221B for days on end.  When Irene Adler disappeared the first time, Mycroft and I agreed on you accepting one,
“I know. Sorry.”
"Hypertension and antidepressants are a wild mixture.  Add a ridiculous amount of sodium from the pickles, and it's a recipe for disaster waiting to happen.  I believe Molly's diagnosis; there was a bulge at the base of his skull, one large enough for pooled blood from a ruptured aneurysm.  When the clot burst, it had to go somewhere."  John shakes his head.  "If it hadn't been an aneurysm, it could have been a heart attack that ended him."
“You know,” he says, shrugging. ”I have all these gentlemanly values of trying to do the right thing, but I’m crap at it. I could have lived with Mary and let her do all the child rearing, anything to distance myself from that life. Running off on cases with Sherlock, feeling validated by bringing home the money from a frankly boring job as a GP. I didn’t have the guts to tell her I didn’t love her enough. Didn’t even have the guts to acknowledge it to myself. I’m a coward, but maybe people don’t notice since I’m so bloody stubborn about following things through, even if I hurt myself and others in the process.”
“Well, when I sneeze it’s repeatedly. Maybe eight to ten sneezes in one go. And I have a runny nose and feel a bit off.”
“I manage.”
It was a shock to his system; he gasped and his hard-on returned instantly. They ended up snogging and humping each other on a stage drape lying on the floor behind a pile of chairs. The boy took his shirt off and John went mad with the sight of the defined pecs that were sparse with hair, not even wishing for a moment that they were tits. John began caressing and stroking the boy’s back, feeling every muscle in his shoulders, following the trace of sweat along his spine down to his arse crack as he licked his neck, while touching his nipples and raking his fingers through hair matted with sweat, tugging. It was wild, dreamy and passionate.
Why had he been afraid of Harry figuring it out?
“Obviously. Though there’s no certainty city bees will produce that much - too wide an area with no reliable foliage or plant life - but they’re quite resilient, and we have the park nearby, so it will be interesting to see what they produce. Sycamore honey is said to be dark and strong-flavoured. I hope to at least get a taste of it.”
Sherlock snaps his head around, foregoing the bees' ministrations.  "
”No more remorse, John.”
This is the unresolved issue he doesn’t know how to bring up with John. This craving, which he’s been handling remarkably well through years of flat-sharing, tamped down and wilfully ignored, will be impossible to keep at bay after the recent developments between them.
"So, what you're saying is, that this is a case of real estate sabotage?"
Oh, that
“I know. You’re right. I’m sorry.”
Then, there's the loaded silence, like when they've had an argument.  Or, the time when John was unsure of Sherlock's view on Moriarty, when the alluring intricacies Moriarty presented seemed to outweigh the severity of his crimes, in Sherlock's eyes.  John was luckily proved wrong, when Sherlock showed clear disgust over the criminal's actions.
John seems relieved, but still composed. Deceptively composed. Sherlock
John snickers, turns away.  He watches John stretch, then lean back against the trunk again, regarding Sherlock with a sincere expression.  "Why would she kill Brian, though?  She seemed fond of him, even though it might have been a bit of an instrumental relationship.  And how?"
He goes through the motions of her funeral, letting Stella and Ted take care of Rosie as much as they offer.
He rubs his brow, looking away, then back to Harry.
As a scared teenager - never daring to express any of it, secretly pining while banging cute girls.
John shakes his head.
John blinks and blinks, breath ragged.  He reaches out, slowly placing two fingertips on Sherlock's pulse point.  At first a featherlight touch, then applied pressure, his fingers dancing with the rhythm of Sherlock's beating heart.  He can't be missing Sherlock's deep, heavy breathing.
. Then there's a flicker of guilt again that Sherlock observed in the cab earlier.
He doesn’t
It started innocently enough, as a slow rocking back and forth, and later turned into a giggle provoking odd technique of getting around on hands and feet, instead of the more common hands and knees. Rosie looked like a small and slow four legged spider with an unfortunate nappy bump tipping the scales.
Sherlock steps into the room.
“Well, I’ve always identified with being a soldier. Duties, having a clear purpose, a protocol to follow, knowing right from wrong. I’ve since learned that it’s not that black and white. Invading Afghanistan and such. But I’ve always wanted to do something of importance, to make a difference, and often enough I’ve literally been the difference between life and death.”
would allow it. If he’d ever be ready to not be the person dominating the room, being in control. If that’s something he’d want at all.
"I mean it, and I'm sorry," says Sherlock, with a sudden urgency.  "For everything."
“There was no stopping me. I punched and kicked blindly. I
She’s right of course.
Sherlock scoffs.  "Ever the doctor."  He takes another drag of his cigarette.
the consequences of blunt trauma to the abdomen. It can be superficial, but it can also be life threatening.
, he reminds himself.
One week later, he drives Harry to a garden centre outside of Chelmsford. She loads the bags into the boot.
“What about him?”
“You didn’t know? How could you not know? Why do you think Dad hated me coming here? In his head, it was indoctrination.”
John hit back against it. It felt no different from punching the bullies in the schoolyard. Not one of his proudest moments.
“This is in no way a justification, but I think what happened, when I hurt you, was that I was afraid. And I handled that horribly. Afraid and angry. Afraid of losing you, again.”
'.  He carved out an apple, saying
Sherlock nods.
Of course John would be upset seeing him climb several floors up. Not to mention he almost fell, right in front of him.
She scowls.
It’s not unexpected, but he’ll need a bit more time to adapt.
There’s a weary sadness in her voice.
He looks to Sherlock, whose eyes shine bright.
and snorts.
It shouldn’t even be possible to have a problem making a ring disappear in 221B.
John’s not sure if there ever was a case, or if Sherlock just had decided they needed to see each other on more neutral ground, after what happened. He continues walking. He has no baby to carry and has nowhere he needs to be at the moment. A little bit of unexpected freedom.
"Don't forget to put out the candles," she says.  "I don't want a surprise call from the Fire Brigade.  And no shagging!"  She carefully presses the keys into Sherlock's outstretched bandaged hand.
me to fight back. You sprained Wiggins’ arm for waving about a knife. You would know how to effectively disarm any junkie. But you didn’t. You wanted something from me. Otherwise, you’d just have taken the scalpel and
"I'm sorry?"
“Yes. It’s a settlement for
John let his knuckles brush along his cheek and Sherlock closes his eyes. John tucks a stray curl behind Sherlock’s ear and cups his jaw, stroking that lovely warm skin with his fingers. Sherlock swallows hard, and John can hear his breath stutter when John tilts his face towards him. Sherlock’s eyes are still closed, but there’s a pained expression on his face.
He drags the tip of his nose down along Sherlock’s sweat-slicked neck. He wants to make him shiver, but that should be impossible in this heat.
Time to move on.
“How can you justify- ”
Sherlock comes back in the middle of the night.  He climbs into bed beside John, smelling of tobacco and the sea.  He notices John's awake, not that he ever really was sleeping in Sherlock's absence.
Maybe that was a bit of a stretch, considering how fast this went.  "Yes, I did.  No use to keep chasing him now.  They're ready to welcome him ashore."
"Well, she clearly has full access to the house if she wants."  Sherlock leans in a little closer.  "She only needs to ask to use the kitchen."
Keep your head clear, John. Don’t mix it up.”
Will Sherlock think less of him if he tells him about his cowardice? Now, if ever, it would be best to soldier on. He grabs Sherlock’s ankles and puts his feet back down on the seat, but doesn’t let go.
Sherlock's not sure what's driving John's determination to expose himself to nature's elements like this.  He didn't bring a scarf, nor a jumper, and his coat isn't nearly as warm as Sherlock's.  It's short, leaving his jeans clad thighs exposed to the wind.
There’s nothing to it. It’s the only logical arrangement, since John is caring for a small child who needs to be fed and cleaned repeatedly. Of course he’s in more need of the room closest to the bathroom and the kitchen. While Rosie herself doesn’t take up much space at the moment, they can’t really cram in both bed, cot, changing table and all their belongings in the smaller room upstairs.
He takes a breath.  "Two--"
John's not sure that's completely true.  He can recognise avoidance, and this has all the tells.
He plays the violin for hours on end, until his fingers are raw and cracked. After he wipes down the instrument, removing the layer of rosin dust that had accumulated, and places it in the case. He then texts his manicurist who luckily has a spot available in a few hours.
'?"  Sherlock presses the tips of his index fingers to his lips.
“Eat?” Rosie giggles. She has no idea what most of what Sherlock says means, but she's delighted to be told anyway. It's infectious. John realises his cheeks are getting sore before he realises he's smiling.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You know, there are queer spaces that you could go, to see if you feel comfortable being in that environment,” she says, rubbing her hand up and down his back. “You don’t have to go to a gay club. There are pubs, coffee shops… It’s not the nineties anymore, John.”
And now he’s walking on a familiar street, her street. It feels like walking home. And why shouldn't it? That’s what she’s always been to him, a home. A home he hasn’t visited in years.
(See the end of the chapter for
“For God's sake, look at the middle of the wall. See?”
Only in his dreams, his hands would roam Sherlock's body.
Sherlock explains the case up until this point while they ride the cab across town to a building site.
"The first letter is p, that's for sure.
“You don’t understand, do you?”
John knew about it, though. Of course she had wanted to show it off to him.
“I thought I did. I wanted to. So I said the words when you asked me. Even if you tricked me into it.”
"I might send Donovan over to have a word."
It was easy enough to tell him off that first night at Angelo's.  John had instantly retreated, been right on the verge of asking for forgiveness for his misstep.  Shouldn't be hard to brush him off if he dares to make a move.
John blinks  "Is that?  That's the letters you wrote about?"
"You're very resourceful, John," Sherlock says, with admiration.
"Because,"  John clears his throat.  "'
She leaves them on the bench, soon swallowed up by the darkness, and with that, all John's diplomacy is used up for the night.  He lets out his frustration.
many times!"
“D-Don’t do this.”
She shrugs. “It was all for the better. That was my last stint. In a proper facility. Like the one you paid for, once.”
"I agree, though," says John, conversationally.  "Sexual response doesn't necessarily have anything to do with love and devotion."
"Um, that's hard to tell," John admits, biting his lip.
John has been thinking about having a garden of his own. Thinking of endless afternoons with Harry at Catherine’s.
Sherlock fiddles with his phone and John looks out the window, at the once familiar landscape that’s changed quite a bit since his Chelmsford days.
John straightens slowly, yawning, then points at the now open coffee shop.  "Breakfast?"
, along with
"Because you wanted something long term," John says gently, warm eyes regarding Sherlock in his struggle to contain the emotional turmoil.  "Because you wanted love."
"Truly, I have a hard time imagining her making an enemy."
“Of course.”
“I’m not- I’m not sure this is a good idea.”
”Oh, Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson chastises. “Really. I may not have cared for any children, but you don’t have to be condescending. I was only trying to help.”
"Well that was a bit of a shamble," John offers in a clear attempt to break the silence.  "What now?"
abused, but my actions-”
John snorts. “Not likely, no.”
"I don't know," she says.
“What do you mean? She would most definitely understand.”
Sherlock has a relaxed, dreamy look on his face, the kind he gets just before he collapses after a case. John smiles tentatively and closes his eyes as the therapists douses them with warm, fragrant water. He groans with how good it feels, just on the right side of hot. He opens his eyes again. Sherlock smirks at him.
"We'll see if his flat can give us some answers."
And that’s when the massage really starts. Warm oils are poured over their backs, releasing the scent of oranges and cloves.
. God, do I know how stubborn you can be, but really! You don’t have to soldier through everything. You just don’t
Sherlock keeps texting.  "Yes?"
“Is it to do with your sister?”
John starts chuckling, which progresses to him doubling over, laughing until he has tears in his eyes.  A bit of an overreaction, probably caused by the last days' emotional turmoil.  When he manages to gather himself, he has one very pressing question.  Sherlock might have been wrong, but he's rarely totally wrong.
The craft box is bulky and heavy. He’s afraid he’ll drop it on another passenger if he tries to put it in the overhead compartment, so he pushes it under his seat instead. He’s got a plastic bag on his knees, with a watercolour landscape wrapped in tissue paper and the dusty smelling macrame wall hanging. Maybe he can let it hang outside for a few days, to get the smell out?
He plays with John’s nipple, lavish licks and kisses, a hint of teeth, and now he slides down off the seat, kneels on the floor, a hand on each of John’s thighs. His curls seems darker than ever, hanging down in front of his eyes.
“Don’t be. It’s just how it is. Nothing to be done about it. But I’m here now. And I’ve missed you,” she says with such warmth that he falls into sobbing again.
therapy, then…” she says with a
He's still crouching on the floor, gathering the fallen receipts.  "Sherlock, look."  He holds one up for Sherlock to see.  "She's used a card.  Apparently, Miss Cushing's not completely old-fashioned, even though she writes her letters with pen and paper."
He came up with a spreadsheet enumerating different sounds and what they meant, tied to an infant’s basic needs. John asked how he could know all this. Sherlock simply shrugged.
“How is Rosie? I assume she’s... developing?”
“Oh. Yeah maybe I’m becoming one. I just don’t fit into your prejudiced image of a yogi. I do my meditations - I can highly recommend it. But actually, you might be right about the veggie thing. Don’t tell anyone, but-” she leans over conspiratorially and stage whispers, “
Sherlock looks like he belongs on the catwalk. He’s wrapped himself up in several towels, sweeping one over his shoulder with the same air as a Bollywood heroine sweeping the end of her sari in slow motion.
"Keep it safe," he says and winks, then pushes the box of gardening tools towards her.  "And these, too."
John's at home after a few days of too many hours at the clinic. Very voluntary hours, only briefly checking in on the now tobacco-infested flat.  He's mostly kept himself upstairs in his room, but once in a while, he needs the loo, or the kitchen.  Sherlock's incessant indoors smoking has left John with a near empty wardrobe, since the smell of tobacco makes his clothes unwearable after only a day's use.  He doesn't trust Sherlock with doing the laundry when he's home alone, so the pile of dirty clothes has only been growing over the past week, and John is all but out of his favourite clothes.
"Well, they're useless anyway," Sherlock sneers.  "They're all yours if you want them. John has taken notes of it all."  He grabs the plastic bag John had put down on a chair and throws it towards her.
It doesn’t take more than a few days for John to go through all their joint possessions at his flat. Most of it he sets aside for charity. There’s plenty of things still in Baker Street.
“Make some tea then, that would be helpful.”
“Lousy doctor.”
"Speaking of trust..."  He steps away from John's touch.  The phone buzzes in his coat pocket, but he ignores it.  "Yesterday, at the pier, I subjected you to several stimuli: physical closeness and a dropped voice, followed by excitement and the rewarding feeling of accomplishment as well as the thrill of the chase ending with a perceived threat."
“And I used to try to correct you. You were just too much and I didn’t want you to suffer the consequences. I’m sorry if I kept you down.”
John takes off his shoes and socks and Sherlock narrows his gaze. “John, what are you doing?”
Get some air and calm down. That had been a pretty wise coping mechanism, in light of his latent anger issues.
He knows he’s playing a dangerous game. He knows this needs to stop. He needs a therapist.
“Right. Okay. Fine, good.”
“The best and the worst,” he muses. “I never pictured myself as a father. Being a kid was- I couldn’t wait to grow up, so why would I put someone else through-”
John drops the phone on his desk and covers his face with his hands. He feels weak and ashamed. He longs to see Sherlock and he dreads it. He’s made such a fool of himself.
Sherlock presents John with the fact on the day of moving, which in hindsight might have been a less than good idea.
Sherlock slaps him again in time with the word.
"It is?"
"I've already talked to an officer," says Wendy as they start down the stairs.  "I've given my statement. And I lost a friend today."  There's a waver in her voice.  "I've had a shitty day ever since I came back from work to find my home surrounded by police tape, and now I need to try to sleep.  I've got work tomorrow, too.  I don't know what happened, but I hope you find whoever did this to Brian."
"Like he's done from the start."
Lestrade looks to Sherlock.  "Degloving?"
"Well he should have stayed away from old and spoiled food, and then of course sauerkraut, and other pickled or fermented greens."
Sherlock proceeds to open cupboards and drawers.
It’s a while before Harry draws in a shaky breath, long enough for John to try to form a plan for damage control, to identify his easiest escape route, to mentally rehearse his defensive manoeuvres.
“I would feel like a fake, like I’d be lying to get in there.”
Sherlock has several theories, but only one he happens to be more inclined to try to prove.  He lets the shell come to rest.
John doesn't mind a gun being present in such situations.  He admittedly doesn't like the concealment.  But, it's the reason behind Sherlock bringing it in the first place, that has him worried.
“Oh Christ, Harry. I’m sorry.”
Again, he can’t make himself say it, not even to the hallucination of a very dead person.
John is reluctant to see Sherlock again. He hasn’t apologised for what he did to him. He dreads it. To speak those words, admit his actions.
Sherlock’s ordered a lush chocolate cake. He seems to be convinced that he’ll be able to cultivate Rosie’s taste by starting early.
Sherlock is quiet, his eyes cast down.
"If you want to. You don’t have to. John, you can consider it for a while. There's no hurry, the offer still stands if you want to-"
"Oh.  Seems we have probable cause of death, unless Molly tells us otherwise.  I'll text her too."
Her warm weight, her calm breathing, the feeling of having proven himself - some kind of atonement for his involvement in this baby’s loss of her mother - it’s all crashing over him. He cries silently, stroking her back until he too falls asleep.
” He can see that Harry’s getting restless in the face of all this praise directed at her. “You’re getting sappy. Are you sure you haven’t been down to your landlady, tasting that eggnog?”
The garden consists of just a plain lawn walled in on three sides, with a garden shed in the back.  No flowerbeds or fruit trees.  The shed is taped off.  There's officers with torchlights in the man-high shrubbery behind it.
He’s already had Wiggins over to re-fit the lab into a storage room upstairs. They’ve painstakingly switched John’s old narrow bed for Sherlock’s wider one, needing to make an emergency call to hire two guys from the homeless network when the bigger bed got stuck on the landing with he and Wiggins on each side of it, impossible to move either backwards or forwards. With help they luckily managed to unstick it without breaking the stained glass window.
John sighs loudly, massaging his brow.  "Molly, I mean Molly."
Why is she bringing up his addiction?
"I don't mind."
She tosses him the bottle.
He estimates there is another five minutes to go, so he joggs until he rounds the corner of the building. There comes the outdoor fitness group, back from a drill in the nearby park. Perfectly timed as expected. He’s worked up enough of a sweat to merge with them undetected and follow the swarm through the doors without having to procure a gym card.
Last time John fell asleep in a similar position, he woke up with a jerk, sat straight up looking anywhere but at Sherlock.  It hurt to see him distancing, but Sherlock knows it's for the best.  He's well prepared for John to wake up on his shoulder any minute now, and equally ready to do his bit of playacting, to save John from any embarrassment.  Anything to not succumb to the persistent desire for a deeper intimacy.
"The dolls, I mean. Your fairy dolls."
“Fail again and again,” she cuts him off. “Yeah, I know it’s not very uplifting. But don’t worry. As you can see I’ve managed.”
John snorts.  "Yeah, I can imagine that.  But that isn't what this is."  He cups Sherlock's face with his left hand.  "I'm afraid too," he says gently.  "But let's see what we've got, hmm?  Let me tell you what I observe about you."  John brushes his thumb across Sherlock's heated cheek.  "Firstly, I can see that you're flushed, which would indicate sexual arousal."
She gives up an ear-splitting screech, pointing.
John peers through the foliage, trying to get a glimpse of the flowers, but it's too dense.  "Um, I don't really get how they're connected.  You said maybe Miss Cushing had put her house on the market--do you mean someone wants to make her lose money?"
They walk slowly along the shore, eastwards, with the sun on their backs.  John is a bit unsteady, as he'd been downing champagne too fast, considering the lack of sleep and highly irregular meals during the last twenty-four hours.
“You may not care about your ‘transport’, but that’s irrelevant. This is about us. About trust. Us trusting each other and me trusting myself. I don’t know if I do. Trust myself.”
“It’s close to soundproof.”
He’s booked treatments for them as well, in case bathing in pools and steam rooms aren’t enough to make them relax. It’s very possible that it’s only John who feels the need to relax.
"A couple of weeks ago.  I saw you on the telly, all caught up in that trial.  Star witness!  I figured you were busy, so I didn't bother writing again."
“I’m happy to have
"I need access to the lab," says Sherlock, more firmly.  "This evidence needs to be examined."  He taps the box.  "And I might have to run a soil sample test."  When she makes no move to acquiesce to his demands, he raises his brows and grits through his teeth, "Preferably now."
John realises he’s slowly sliding his hands back and forth along Sherlock’s calves, feeling small bubbles release from the hairs and tickle his fingers as they rise to the surface. He lets go, unsure of what he’s allowed to do, even in the face of Sherlock’s unabashed flirting.
"Thank you," says Lestrade, clearly relieved. "And, you're welcome to get back in the shed again."
The beach feels endless.  The colour of the sky and the sea start to merge, and it's greyer than ever.  They pass an odd collection of flint statues and a deserted beach volleyball court.  Here, the white stuccoed Regency style buildings rise high up behind them on top of the steep cliff.  Even the bold souls of the naturist beach forgoes to brave the incoming storm.
"So that's what we get, after being thrown out by Sally Donovan and escaping to the seaside."  John grins despite all the hurtful words Sherlock just threw at him.  "We're missing out on all the fun."
"It's normal, John,” she had said reassuringly. And he didn't have to answer, and it was good, very good. Mary meant less struggle, more complacency.
Lestrade's gaze narrows.  "When the team is done, mind you."
This time, he’ll make an effort. This time he will talk.
No-one touched another man, it was only group masturbation. But there sat John, incredibly aroused, touching himself. It was too much, too intense, too shameful and dangerous.
“Yeah, it almost seems like when I have a cold.”
“I’ve not told you everything about Mary.”
He hopes the spa setting will offer them a relaxed, laid back atmosphere. The conversation John is planning to have with Sherlock will be fraught with tension. He needs to own up to his failings, admit his transgressions. Say it to Sherlock’s face, and ask for forgiveness. He should have done it a very long time ago.
Lestrade does a double take.  "I must say, you have very high standards.  Not even the boys from Croydon Fire are good enough for you, huh?" he mutters, slightly offended on behalf of the London Fire Brigade.
"No.  It's Lestrade.  They've found the cardboard box.  Miss Cushing finally remembered where she'd put it and called in to tell the officers.  I hate to admit it, but it completely slipped my mind to look for it once she had left.  I'll blame those bloody boring receipts."
as a villain.
, because of it's pink coloured stems early in the spring, and the rhubarb-like taste of young shoots.
The door opens wide.
"Do you still have the flowers?" asks Sherlock, ignoring the chiding tone.
Harry crosses her arms and tilts her chin. “You say I’m a quitter. Yes, I am. And you know what? I’m happy about it. Fuck that loyalty bullshit. I have succeeded, John. Repeatedly. Do you know how many times I’ve fought this shit and succeeded?”
"And what do you
. Sexually gratifying, yes, but never with this rightness at its core. This feeling of belonging, of coming home.
He’s getting better at it. He’s also getting better at listening to himself.
Majida smiles knowingly and pours them both full glasses of steaming
That could have been an impressive deduction, but John recognises the quote.
"Christ!"  He's right, and John hasn't even noticed.
That was a pretty shitty thing, indeed.
"Yeah, I can see that."  John tries to zoom in on an interesting photo.  In a dark corner, on the top shelf of the bathroom cabinet, there seems to be several medicine boxes of the same type and pink label.  "You don't have any better pictures than this of the bathroom cabinet, do you?"  He flips the phone to show Sherlock.
Sherlock glares at him.  "Exactly."  He's not amused.  John hands him the whiskey tumbler as a peace offering, and Sherlock hesitantly accepts it.
John could only laugh at that.
“Tell me about your scar.”
"It grows through concrete.  It destroys property."
Ella seems to have an efficient radar at picking up on his unease. He manages to actually tell it like it is, that it really scared him, that following right behind Sherlock was almost not enough. That he had to pull him up, from where he was hanging onto the scaffolding, dangling three floors above the ground. That it was a close call.
“I’m a yoga instructor, as well as an instructor in different yoga fusion classes at a gym. I’m training to become a PT.”
They’re sitting side by side on the garden stairs, sipping Harry’s homemade elderflower cordial with sparkling water.
He’s not sure what she’s getting at. He’s been busy with moving, selling the flat and the car, settling in at Baker Street.
They’re sitting in Catherine’s kitchen. They’re having an argument. Life seems to go in circles.
Sherlock's well aware that John's been staring at him.  Not only just now, but for a time, increasingly more frequent than before.  It isn't unexpected in itself; Sherlock regularly does things which amazes John.  However, the soft look on his face when Sherlock catches him staring, is a rather peculiar development.  It's not as if they've had any adrenaline inducing chases, or the like, in the last couple of weeks.  Even so, there's a distinct change in John's demeanour when observing Sherlock.  Yes, that's it.  It's not merely an expression of wonder at Sherlock's capabilities, he is actually observing.
Sherlock's eyes gleam.
His fingertips are wrinkled after so many hours of water and moisture. There's nothing in-between them now. No nitrile gloves. No distance. He’s steady and sure but his heart beats and his ears roar when Sherlock lets him inside. He has to pause. To see,
', and '
The phone buzzes again.
The young man brings in the dessert, then quickly returns with a new candle for their table, as the other has burnt down and snuffed itself out.
“Oh. Yeah it was pretty chaotic at the time. Too much to drink, too much going through my mind.”
"Don't worry, we'll figure something out."
Time off isn’t a concept anymore, with this soon to be free-runner. In the midst of the daily chaos, Sherlock appreciates that she’ll probably be perfecting her skills in the future, to become an excellent companion to run with in pursuit of criminals.
"I've seen this before.  I know you think I'm mousey, but it doesn't mean I'm blind!"  Molly is exasperated.  "You never explain your theories, only enumerate exactly how many they are, and then keep mum about it until you can rattle off the clever solution, to his amazement and applause."  She points to John, who blushes to his roots.  "How about you bloody let anyone else into your head from time to time?  Stop brooding and speak up, for goodness' sake!"
“Yeah. I inherited the house.”
The topic is sensitive, and Sherlock would rather not have John shout inside Majida's restaurant, so he bides his time, watching John devour the food.  The guests are slowly dissipating, thankfully.  The sounds of contemporary Middle Eastern songs, the current one featuring the oud, plays softly in the background, muffling their voices. When the dessert's been served, and John has his mouth stuffed with baklava, Sherlock makes the jump.
”I tackled Sherlock in a restaurant when he came back after faking his suicide. After
“I did. He said I was human.”
When the addiction came creeping in he had tried to stand by her side, offer his help. But it was too late, not enough trust left between them.
"Oh, that's what he needed the oven for!" John blurts out, feeling clever.  "I thought it was odd Miss Cushing only mentioned Brian needing the oven, and not you, if you both have kitchenettes."
“You’re gonna sport this new look in the park later?”
“Yeah I remember that, your dolls didn’t have that hole in their backs.”
Sherlock had pushed his tongue into John’s mouth to provoke a reaction, to let him know this was welcome, and the result was phenomenal. Only a brief panic, and then John had proved how capable he was. Utterly inventive, playing Sherlock, teasing, and radiating power.
Sherlock looks at the razor kit, the frown deepening.  "
“Won’t stop me from putting them there.”
“Please let me-”
That had been a topic of debate during his conversations with The Woman over the years. While she sympathised with his craving, she didn't approve of his approach, of course. After apologising for her own transgressions regarding consent, she'd advocated for a certain definition of safe and sane, which bored Sherlock to no end. He'd always taken measures to assure his safety, and his version of sanity had always been to make sure he'd never get tangled up in a relationship.
He’s so quiet, impossibly quiet for being Sherlock. John can see Sherlock’s fingers twitch with wanting to touch John’s foot, so he does what he did on his stag night. He lets his foot slowly drop to the floor, then he very deliberately leans over, without the shield of overplayed intoxication, and puts his hand on Sherlock’s knee. They both stare at it, Sherlock taking deep shuddering breaths. John needs to use his other hand to adjust himself, feeling the immediate burn of Sherlock’s eyes on his crotch.
“Go upstairs,” he calls over her wailing. “Use my room. Have a lie down.”
"No worries!" says John, taking Sherlock's hand.  They hurry past the young man and back into the garden.
“You read the folder?”
"You know," John continues his prodding, because he can't leave it alone.  "I thought you despised her at the end, knowing she worked with Moriarty and all that."  He carefully lets the razor follow the curve of Sherlock's jaw bone.  "
Sherlock sticks out his right hand from behind the shower curtain, one of his ziplock evidence bags covering the bandage.  He then sticks out his other hand to dump his pants on the floor, before turning the water on.
”I also found that I had a talent for marksmanship.”
Writing this story was a crazy process.
He’s been to therapy.
They take a cab from the train station, pass new buildings that weren’t there the last time he was. The factory where his father worked for most of his life was shut down and demolished even before John moved to London. There’s a university in its place. There seems to be new developments everywhere. Shopping malls. Fancy. It must have become more expensive to live here.
John studies her, taken aback by her admission.
“Tell me, John, are you always going to be filled to the brim with ingrained prejudice?”
"How do you know?" John cuts in with a demanding tone.  "Did she tell you?"
“Don’t worry,” he calls. “I’m not planning to expose the massage therapists to unwanted body parts.”
“Do you talk to him, try to prevent this behaviour? Tell him of your fears?”
, he is allowed. Allowed to touch. A sob is caught in John’s throat as his shaking hands rise up to cradle Sherlock’s face. He doesn’t want this to end, not yet, not before Sherlock tells him off. Maybe he thinks this is some sort of experiment, that John has gone soft in the head, but he can’t let go now, he needs to know where this ends. In disaster or..?
After that, they might possibly try to define what they are to each other, and what they want, or don’t want to do about it.
” Harry almost pleads. “You don’t have to just
Harry snubs out her cigarette against the iron railing.
He’d had relationships with women. Not very successful, but at least he wanted it. Or did he? Why did he never commit? Did he self-sabotage on purpose? It’s been the easy way, choosing to hide. At least it seemed easy, until Sherlock came along. But what’s the cost for hiding from oneself?
Ella makes a note and John cringes.
The young man blinks at him, perplexed. He’s probably not been told off since he was in nappies.
"I should have brought the gun," says John, still breathing hard from the race.  He's prodding all parts of Sherlock's hand, in search of any injury.
"You mean you need a smoke," John counters.
John could stay like this forever. With peace in his heart and a beautiful human being, inside and out, in front of him. He’s got eyes to drown in and a very kissable mouth. He’d like to touch him, if he’ll be allowed. But his hands and feet are getting cold.
Sherlock holds on to the doorframe, can’t let go of this seeming connection between them.
"Yes, because I could tell you were fleeing too!"  John takes his injured hand in his.  "You didn't tell me anything about your worries.  You kept them to yourself, and didn't want to let me in.  So how could I have handled that differently?"
“Can I?” he gestures.
They switch places, never letting go of each other’s hands, until John guides Sherlock’s hands upwards, devouring the striking view of his body stretched out.
“Can I just- can I ask you for one thing?”
“Safely?”
One was Ted, his teacher. For some reason, he’s managed to keep in contact with Ted and his wife Stella, through med school and beyond, through his years of deployment in Afghanistan. And now, they’ve been his most reliable overnight babysitters since he went to Morocco to retrieve his wife. They don’t know the entirety of Mary’s story, but they’ve been incredibly supportive none the less.
Just when Sherlock’s knees are about to go wobbly, John lets go with an innocent smile.
"Actually, about the letters... It was kind of my fault."
The realisation is obvious in its simplicity.  "I fell into that trap, even without Moriarty being involved.  I started to believe every clue was directed at me.  I expected him to leave those traces so I could follow."
Having Rosie in their lives has forced them to become better at communication. For practical reasons, and to avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings.
"Then fix some decent ventilation for Christ's sake!" mutters Sherlock.
is more rare.  It's something he never does unless half asleep or inebriated.  On the one hand, it's a shame, since John's mere presence is very calming in itself.  During the rare occasions they actually touch like this, Sherlock experiences a pleasant comfort that is highly conducive to slowing down his thought process.  He suspects it produces the perfect balance of dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin.
Sherlock laboriously wrestles himself and Rosie out of the scarf and coat, throwing them over one of the side tables. He releases the backstrap and sits down on the sofa with a pillow against the arm rest. He carefully scoots down to a reclining position, holding Rosie tightly against his chest. He releases her limbs from the rest of the carrier, and decides to reach for Mary’s scarf, folding it and tucking her in.
"It was you, wasn't it?" asks John.  "Telling him off?"
So much for hiding, hoping to pass as straight.
"My eyesight isn't as good as it once was, so I never really look at my receipts.  I've only continued to bring them back home out of habit," Miss Cushing says, slowly gathering her things.  "Then, when I pack up my groceries, they go straight in the bin."
Sherlock is back to the reverberating state he's usually in while on a case.
"Yes, with my necklace in it.  That was a surprise!"
"Hey, Sherlock."
I had no idea what I was getting into. The characters took on a life of their own and they were terribly chatty, taking up space in my brain at the most inconvenient times. The story grew to a format not really compatible with the time frame of this exchange.
“I take it he wasn’t a very nice man. I don’t know you to be ungenerous, and it would seem a bit petty to spite someone due to their hearing impairment.”
"Nah, it's sunny.  We've been idle too long," says John and stands up.  The pebbles give away and he has to adjust his feet, take a step back, higher up on the slope, before he falls on his arse.
John finds him in the garden.
Annoyingly, he is right, as always.
"Doesn't have to be.  It's a demonstration of capabilities.  As I said, the burning was a beacon to draw attention to the fact that Miss Cushing's garden is infested with Japanese knotweed."
“It’s not the proper grooming order. Should have done it before shaving to prepare the foll-”

"There's nothing to know, John.  If you're worried about what happened this morning--just don't.  No need to worry.  You know what I'm like when I'm focused on a case."  Sherlock taps his forehead.  "It's the case, I promise.  Nothing more.  There's something I'm missing."
"Formidable opponent, executing a cunning, yet basic scheme," Sherlock says, tightly.
“You don’t want this.”
"What makes you think a baby in 221b would be a good idea?"
"It will get better with rest."
“I think I understand. You regret what you did and won’t repeat it. Correct?”
“I’d listen.”
Sherlock stubs out the spent remainder of his cigarette.  "True.  I'm still eager to see that autopsy report.  She'll let me have a closer look at the body, when she's done."
It's hypnotising to watch.
"Oh," she covers her mouth, realising something.  "Was.  He
“How so?”

"Yeah, so did all three of them, until Brian died," says John, catching up.  "So what's the real reason you suspect her?  You're not usually that shallow in your analyses."
It’s not a question, and that should really bother him.
John is suddenly very aware of where Sherlock’s legs are, only inches away, invisible under the bubbling surface. He resists his impulse to capture them and instead wipes away the droplets that had landed on his face.
He realises he’s clamped down hard on Sherlock’s wrists. He lets go abruptly.
“I don’t have any qualms being petty when it comes to
"You could do well getting away from nosy reporters," John tries arguing.  "Go outside while the sun is up.  Not being accosted in public."
He makes his way to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water, drinking in heaping gulps, refilling it twice. He rubs his eyes with the heel of his hands, only to be reminded of how he pressed into Sherlock’s brow in his dream. He sniffs, clears his throat and heads back to bed.
“Hmm…”
John giggles at the ridiculous targets, but as soon as he has the rifle in his hands, he collects himself in a mere second.  John Watson, steady and focused, is a sight to behold.  Of course, he hits the mark all six times in a row.
you.”
Sherlock peers intently at the letter, flipping it over to study the back, then returning to the front.  "She clearly thought so, since she's underlined, with the frail and shaky line of a quivering elderly woman's hand, that she kept it inside her house, contrary to the receipts."
Sherlock draws in a breath - he’s figured it out. “Oh, Oh!”
Only it doesn’t work that way with John.
"Hm.  Is there any possibility these weren't meant for you, but your sister?" he says with irritation, ignoring the look he gets from John.  "They're all addressed to S Cushing."
," he says, pointedly.
”Wrong.
“But you didn’t,” Sherlock says firmly. He turns to study John and cocks an eyebrow. “Besides, it would have been a pretty convenient place to suffer a ruptured spleen.”
"No, I mean let's leave the city."
John is high on his own capability after the last years of feeling like a pawn in a game of chess, without any authority of himself. Things just
Sherlock is dressed and grabs his jacket from the coat rack behind the door.  He exits without a word, leaving his Belstaff behind.  John hopes he doesn't go far in the dark.  He doesn't want to imagine Sherlock alone on the quiet countryside.
The onslaught of sensation makes it hard for Sherlock to get out a final protest.  "Attributing one's arousal to an erroneous source can alter the emotional experience!" he says with clenched teeth, inanely fighting the quick build-up from their erections getting acquainted.
She laughs.  "You're rather observant, too.  And yes, we were aware of the health benefits.  It shouldn't be dangerous.  So, Brian started to collect the growing sprouts.  He spent hours in Miss Cushing's kitchen making large batches of pickled knotweed, sealing the jars in her oven."
close to blackmailing.”
“I didn’t say that. I do believe you when you say you’re off the booze for good, even if it’s contrary to previous experiences.”
She lifts her sunglasses and gives him a look.
“And you managed to do better,” Sherlock drops his voice. He puts his feet on John’s thighs, sliding his toes up to the edge of the trunks.
”I wasn’t in combat. Not until the day I got shot. I was an army doctor.”
tea.  "You look exhausted, both of you.  Don't mind me, I'll just sit in the corner over there and do some bookkeeping."
One of the reasons Sherlock is so fond of John is his oft flawed first impressions of people.  "Is she, though?
While he loves Rosie with all his heart, he still wants John to himself. Not always, but regularly.
"I imagine Miss Badu's aware," John can't help but point out.
“I don’t do
The therapists start their treatment with a rather intense full body scrub down with a traditional coarse exfoliating glove, where a mass of dead skin cells are released. John feels like his skin is burning, but it soon fades with the endorphin release.
As they traverse the A215, John fills Sherlock in on the correspondence they've had with Susan Cushing.  She'd repeatedly received mysterious envelopes in the mail, containing her own discarded receipts.  It had been going on for some time when she'd contacted Sherlock.  It could have been considered threatening, but she'd stated clearly in her letter that she'd never made any enemies and that there was never any letters accompanying the receipts.  While looking for the notes he took when he'd rang her up, John found another letter from her, unopened.  He hands it to Sherlock now, and after he opens it, they read it together.  Apparently, she wrote again because she'd received something different: a cardboard box containing her own jewellery.
He kept himself busy at work, barely meeting her in the staffroom. It wasn't healthy for couples to spend both private and work life together, was it? Better make sure they wouldn’t wear each other out.
"Gentlemen, may I remind you, no smoking!"
"I was trying to be polite.  Genuinely."
Donovan eyes John suspiciously.
Sherlock is out the door within seconds, lighting up as he flees.
John gives him an imploring look.
Harry sets a lantern down, lights it. John puts his hand beside the dove, bites his lips. Reaches for Harry’s hand. She puts her other hand on the stone, too, as John addresses their aunt.
to others, lest they take advantage of him.
“Well? Please continue.”
It would have got him done for perjury in a court of law all the same, because while it’s the truth, it’s not the whole truth.
"Wait," says John, noticing Sherlock's instant shift of focus.  "Funeral flowers?  The ones he used to give you, or?"
"Aside from the trampling horde, I don't have any complaints.  I was referring to the arsonist."
. Those things tend to create drama, which will surely stand in the way of my work.  It doesn't interest me in the least.  That's still my position."
. She would’ve understood and shut up about it if that was what you wanted.”
Harry narrows her eyes.
In a way, it was a blessing that John fled from Sherlock's tobacco fumes to his stupid clinic to do boring locum work.  Because otherwise, he might have realised that Sherlock wasn't bored, but actually fretting over the precarious situation with Moriarty.  He's been desperately trying to decipher Moriarty's riddles, figure out what he's up to, without dragging John into it.  Partly to avoid the admonishment he knows will come if John finds out about the visit, but primarily for John's safety.
Sherlock leaves.
, or the red mason bee. They are solitary bees; every female is fertile and makes her own nest, so there’s no hive, and no worker bees for these species exist. We’ll start out with that until we get proper beehives. You see, insects are essential to seed production, and we need all the pollinators we can get to keep up the food supply.”
several times.  She's really been out and about.  If these are all hers, she's done an awful lot of shopping even though she's slow as a sloth and can't manage to go out in the hallway to pick up her own mail."
Sherlock huffs, and John can’t believe he let that slip through, or that he seems to be getting away with it, without Sherlock scrutinising him on the spot. What a difference a little wine makes. John hasn’t had a drop of alcohol in weeks. He tries to bring the conversation back on topic.
The car stops in front of a house at the end of a street, which boasts alternating beige and brown brickwork. John exits the car and Sherlock follows.
John turns his head to look at their cover.  He can't see any details in the dark, but he recognises the bamboo-like shape of the stems.  "Bloody hell!"
“Rosie, wait!” John calls after her.
He sighs.
They head for the FunFair attractions at the seaward end of the pier.
“You know, it’s kind of complicated.”
Sherlock plonks down on the chair across from her.  "How are we faring with Mr James?"
Other songs from the gym might have been something in this vein:
"Mycroft and I have a saying about coincidences:
When they both emerge from their cubicles, John feels like a misshapen Tarzan. He really should be better at this, what with knotting macrame as a kid and folding hospital corners every time he makes a bed.
They win three straight sets each, and get a standing ovation from a couple of elderly women. Both the stall holder and a bunch of kids are impressed, but they get scandalised looks from their mothers.  When they give away their cuddly toy prizes to the kids, the mothers seem to thaw up a bit, except for one of them who gets even more offended.
Sherlock can’t really throw it in the rubbish, though he’d very much like to. There’s a risk John will remember his ring and ask about it.
“I-I don’t.”
“Oooh, this is clever!” He gives John a sly smile, pointing at a seemingly insignificant newspaper clip on the wall.
"Indeed."
, and he wants you to play along.  What if you don't?"
Sherlock scoffs and sets off towards the beach.
And then once again, twenty years from the first time it happened, and as before, he continued the pattern of hiding behind a string of girlfriends.
“Catherine bought me a few packs of flower dresses and butterfly wings though.”
"Remember when Miss Cushing first told us about the bouquet?  And I said the flowers were significant.  I was fooled by the nonsensical receipts, but you pointed out they were designed to drive someone 'round the bend.  Think of the sustained terror of getting your own receipts in the mail, no threats, no demands.  Someone stealing your jewellery and then returning it, only demonstrating that they can break the privacy of your own home.  And a funeral bouquet.  So very elaborate.  Professional."
“Er, actually we were in the area for a case, me and Sherlock.”
This time he gets up.
“Well then, there’s the difference.”
," Sherlock grumbles.
“Well,” John had said. “I wouldn’t have guessed we’d ever be trendy, but I’ve actually read that small scale city farming is the next new thing. You know, to keep the doomsday at bay, climate change and all that.”
“It’s moments like those that makes parenting quite nice sometimes. It kind of balances things out. There’s so many nappies and smeared food otherwise. Life is always a bit sticky.”
!” Sherlock smiles brightly and sits down on the bench beside John.
But Sherlock doesn't, because he's not allowed to have this, has
Molly hangs her lab coat on a peg as they step into the lab.
The spa program folder is peppered with oriental names alluding to spices, sultans and hammams. It makes a promise of treating their bodies with the most luxurious soaps and oils known to man. This is a very special occasion, so John really hopes it will be worth the splurge. It should be enough, just having a relaxing day off, him and Sherlock, but he’s still nervous about the outcome.
John smooths his jeans, gently massaging the flesh he just pinched.
"Moriarty came to Baker Street," Sherlock says evenly.  "We had tea."
"Just come here," Sherlock urges with a sudden impatience.  John doesn't move.  "Oh, come on!  We've already established that you can't deny me."  John tilts his head and narrows his eyes, as if Sherlock is up to something a bit not good.  "
There's a final set of stairs leading up to the door to the roof.
His hand slips in under the jaw, feeling the edges of his jawbone, massaging the soft tissue. He tugs Sherlock’s hair and licks into his open mouth. Sherlock closes his eyes and mumbles.
"Brian's allotment.  Tell Sally to not tape it off!  I don't want to inform the perpetrator about our interest.  I need to go there to see it for myself."
They forget to open the envelope from Harry until all their guests have left and Rosie is having a well-deserved nap.
The tears come rushing before he knows it. He covers his face with one hand, the other caught by Harry. She squeezes it gently.
Within that apt and terrible description, there is room for hope.
Holding him down, spreading him out - it has always been part of John’s sexual fantasies about Sherlock. In his dreams he’s created situations that would allow it. He’s not sure
John's care is obvious.  But to what extent does he care?  And why is he actually observing?  What is he hoping to find?
"Coffee?"
“Yeah I know. I’ve seen it too.”
“Well thank you, John.”
“You isolate yourself when there’s something you can’t handle. My relapses, Sherlock’s death. You said it was Mum’s death that made you cease contact with Catherine, but I have a feeling there’s something more.”
Under, in newer fresh gold:
John cries wordlessly. Sherlock doesn’t know what to do. He suspects a hug would be unwelcome, this time.
"I mean, the mere existence of Mycroft and his minions, operating in a very grey area, makes it very easy for me to imagine Moriarty having people on the inside in all those three locations he broke into.  He sneaked himself into Barts IT, why wouldn't he be able to get high security positions for his own people?  It doesn't seem impossible to me."
With Mrs Hudson’s blessings and delight they had fixed big pots and raised beds in the back just outside her patio door.
"A shag against the wall after a case, then?"  He snorts mirthlessly.  "I doubt Mrs Hudson would be shocked; she's imagined you rogering me senseless since you moved in.  She might even be glad of it."
"Yes, you have," John insists.  "You liked her."
"The seagulls better watch out,"  John says.  "That was vicious."  Sherlock doesn't answer, only presses his lips together, tightly.  "Sherlock?" John asks, tentative.
Sherlock is busy draping the trouser legs over the long bench, then pushing it within a safe distance from the radiator.  John needs to pour himself a second drink, but Sherlock declines a refill.
John sees Ella with regular intervals, though further in-between.
“It’s not easy to change behaviour when you’re older. I realise that. But now, I can see how important relationships are. Without therapy, I would have felt your sobriety was another reminder of how I’ve failed you. And I would have been glad for you, but wouldn’t have kept up contact. I would have let it all slide, again.”
“Not really. I haven’t really seen the problem, not until-”
“I try not to think of him, when I’m not around. I need to focus on my daughter.”
with liquid courage.
Miss Cushing pats Sherlock's knee  "You see, that's why I went looking for him in the first place.  He didn't bring me the mail and the paper this morning. He's always home in the morning and usually only goes out in the afternoon.  He likes long walks, but always returns no later than sunset.  Some days he only pops by to bring me some garden flowers."  She sighs.  "He's a really lovely and thoughtful young man."
Sherlock is texting with his left hand, slowly, and not responding.  Then they're already at East Croydon and it's time to get off the train.
“I’m sorry,” John whispers.
“Oh?”
“I already did,” his voice cracks and the last word is barely audible.
John laughs, shaking his head.
"Everyone in this house are useless witnesses," Sherlock complains.
"  Something about it doesn't add up.
"Um, no. Sorry, you're free to drink. Cheers."
Why would she run to a violent showdown just because Sherlock texted? Why didn't she want to live for Rosie at least?
"Jesus, Sherlock," John splutters, flakes of phyllo dough flying.  He grabs his napkin, pressing it to his mouth until he can speak properly.  "I told you, I phoned you as soon as I got out of there to tell you he'd come after you."
“I didn’t mean it like that I-”
“Oh.”
Sherlock stretches.  "Now, let's get to work!"  He jumps back up, reenergised.
, does it mean he owes me a case?"  Sherlock throws his hands up.  "That's what's been on my mind, John.  I can't work it out."
"It has nothing whatsoever to do with morals."

She doesn’t turn to face him when she answers, just continues to slowly water the plants.
Sherlock had ruined it not long after, by exposing Mary. That’s when he killed John’s wife and John’s suburban life, and instead revealed an assassin.
The shed is small, the door opening narrow.  It would be crowded if all three of them went in there. The deceased man inside is Brian James, a retired cabdriver.  He sits slumped to one side, on a wooden chair in the middle of the shed, facing the open door.  The floodlight shines off the skin along his receding hairline.  He looks quite fit for his age, but death, and the insufferable heat, has made him bloated.
They both stare into the dancing flames, quiet, until John's stomach makes itself known again, so loud that Sherlock's gaze drifts from the fire.
He gets the kit, squints at the small bottles. There. He caresses Sherlock’s opening with a lavish amount of conditioner.
Sherlock’s happy to be able to withdraw upstairs when there’s too much wailing or banging of pot lids, which, along with stacking mixing bowls, is Rosie’s current favourite activity.
. Left him alone with addiction. I was just so tired. And angry. He’d put himself on the brink of death, for real this time. He attacked someone, could have killed him. Then he’d be taken away, no divine interventions saving him this time. I guess I wanted to stop him from killing himself or getting incarcerated, leaving me behind again. Not that I had any coherent thoughts in that moment. Just this- indescribable pain. Like when he jumped. But I didn’t break down. I broke him instead. And any trust that was left between us.”
Why did you think I stayed here as much as I could throughout my teenage years? Why do you think I ever dared to come out? Couldn’t have done it without her, not before I moved out for real.”
And he’s too afraid to put Sherlock off, to disturb this thing that is growing between them, to voice any of these fears. But he can’t erase the pictures in his head. He’s nurtured them for so many years. They were only fantasies. Harmless dreams of something he could never have.
"Well, there were no flowers growing in her garden," John says.
"What are you saying, John?"
"What now, Molly?"  Sherlock tilts his head to study her.  "'
Sherlock swallows.  There are moments when John displays a frustratingly high level of brightness.  This is definitely one of them.  John doesn't know his reasons, though.  The ones that make this so incredibly difficult; Sherlock's unwillingness to enter into any kind of sexual association with John without a promise of something more.  And if there is more, what it means when being threatened by Moriarty.  If the live-in assistant, or '
"Hmm.  Can you make out the date of prescription?"
John's a bit worried.  The Moriarty spin Sherlock put on the case was convincing.  Sherlock was very sure.  But why did he wait until the very last minute to tell John about his suspicions?  Why did he bring the gun?  He must have had it with him from the start of the case; throughout their visit to the crime scene, the interviews with witnesses and even in Brighton.  He'd had it on himself when they were sitting on the beach, the ultimate de-stressor.  If he had it in his coat pocket throughout, then it was there when they kissed for the first time, when John sneaked his arms around Sherlock to grab his arse.  And on the roof, just hours ago, where things got heated.
John leans over him, nearly stumbling onto the desk, making Sherlock’s eyes snap open.
"Excellent, John!"
Sherlock takes the leap.
“Have you told him?”
But this is more than enough, he thinks, because John is clearly cold, looking tense, with his shoulders drawn up to his ears.  He's still a bit tipsy, even after the exertion of walking nearly two miles on a pebble beach, and in good humour.
Now that she walks freely, she’s also become an intruder. A small person who squeezes herself in between everything. Always in the way. Always present. Always interrupting. Always demanding attention. Always in his face.
John spies a slight blush on Sherlock’s impossible cheeks. It surprises and tickles him. What a smooth way to get Sherlock hot and bothered.
He clenches his hands, grateful that Sherlock can’t see it beneath the bubbles.
John shrugs.  "Why not?  Seems as likely as anything else in this case."
A confused, newly awakened bumblebee is aimlessly bumbling about. It’s an early spring day. Sherlock is walking in the park, alone. That’s a rare occurrence, these days. Since he currently doesn’t have Rosie to focus on, all the impressions flood his mind.
