His stomach swooped, and his breath caught in his throat. He bit his lip, before shuffling closer, tucking his head under Tony’s chin. Tony began slowly rubbing Steve’s bicep through his shirt. Steve reached out and squeezed Tony’s knee.
“No. It’s a shell,” Clint insisted. “They’re not building anything else. They built a shell to make it look like they built a casino, but they didn’t.”
“Fine. Yes.” Bucky turned, leaning his elbow on the counter. “I was going to the casino. I was going gambling. And I would probably still be there gambling if your husband hadn’t called me.”
“Yes. It is,” Sharon replied and Steve had no idea how her voice managed to remain so calm. She handed over the paper, and there was still no sign of the USB. Steve had to trust that she had it.
Banner, unless knowing what he looked like when he came counted. Banner was one of the many faces he’d lost in a haze of grief and alcohol when he moved to LA.
“Oh, so that’s the limit?” Tony joked. “You’ll kiss me after having your dick in my mouth, but pizza’s too far?”
“My mom would’ve grounded me for life if I went around the block without telling her,” Steve agreed. “She probably would’ve killed you for trying something like that. We did not live in the best part of Brooklyn.”
“A round of applause? What am I- on the USO circuit again?” Steve teased, lifting Ellie out of Tony’s lap to dry her off.
Drawing a shaking breath, Steve nodded. “It, uh… Zoey wasn’t planned,” he explained, and give Tony his due, he didn’t react at the apparent U-turn in the conversation. “She was an accident - not a mistake, because a mistake sounds like something bad - but she’s one of the three best things ever to happen to Peggy and Daniel. And when she was born, I went to visit them in the hospital. And Daniel was holding her.” He smiled at the memory, still as clear in his mind’s eye as it was ten years ago. “And he was looking at her with more love than I’ve ever seen on anybody else. And I thought to myself,
Steve jumped, his head snapping up, and his eyes fell on Obadiah Stane, standing on the other side of the smoking oil drum.
He tipped his head back, staring at the watermark on his ceiling. When he turned back to his laptop, the video was still playing, now in the Great Room with its severe water damage.
Tony couldn’t think of anything to say, so he leaned forward and kissed Steve instead, hoping to pass on the message without words. He pulled back almost reluctantly, coated himself with lube, and lined up.
“Uh, Johnny,” the second boy muttered, ducking his head and burying his hands deep into the pockets of his jacket.
, announcing their arrival at the penthouse. Crossing the apartment to the kitchen, Tony pulled out the menu for his favourite Greek place and handed it to Steve, pressing a kiss into his hair.
They settled back, falling silent as they ate. When they finished eating, Steve stuffed their empty cartons into a carrier bag, before leaning back against Tony’s chest. Behind him, Tony shifted, draping his arm over Steve’s shoulder.
Steve pointedly tried to avoid thinking about the way his teachers tried to push him into academia, needling him with phrases like
“Oh, come on!” Steve grumbled. “I’d just had my growth spurt and I wasn’t used to being six foot and I, kind of, fell into a window.”
Collapsing onto the sofa, Steve tucked himself under Tony’s arm, burrowing into his neck and breathing in the smell of his cologne. He was warm and relaxed, especially when Tony’s lips pressed against his forehead and his hand began rubbing small circles into Steve’s back.
“Italian,” Banner replied. “Okay, we’ve got avocado and smoked paprika bruschette, and marinated mozzarella balls. Then tagliatelle with sausages, rosemary and porcini mushrooms, made with homemade pasta.”
“Those robots from LA?” The image of Tony falling through the air flashed in his mind, and Steve was gripped with fear.
“I can see that,” Stark nodded, an amused smile playing on the edges of his lips. “The question is: why?”
“I’m not afraid,” Steve argued, throwing himself into a chair and wincing when it instantly started digging into his back. He shifted in a futile attempt to get comfortable, before accepting it was a lost cause. “I just don’t like pain.”
Tony packed away the rest of the trash from their dinner, before folding the blanket from the couch while Steve unhooked his laptop and the projector. He looked questioningly at the couch then at Steve. Steve shook his head.
That was some intense eye contact going on. Scott was starting to feel vaguely uncomfortable. Had they, they did…
“They have good safety ratings too,” Tony said, holding onto Ellie as she pushed herself up onto her tiptoes and wobbled precariously.
and, after an advert for Grammarly, was greeted by a wobbly recording of Tony fighting in Monaco during the Grand Prix.

He eased the elastic straps off of Steve’s shoulders, then tossed the wings onto the sofa. Fisting his hands in Steve’s blazer, Tony pulled him forward, holding the jacket open so his eyes could roam over Steve’s bare chest.
“Do you think she asked him before she said that?” Steve asked, stripping out of his work clothes to change them for his favourite clubbing outfit.
“Bro, shut up!” Ivan exclaimed. “You steal building. First dog, then building. Why steal building, bro?”
Next was trying to start the pump. Which, considering the generator was powered up and working - Steve had double checked - it should’ve started. But it didn’t.
“Sorry?” Steve said, glancing between them all. The frown on his face faded to confusion and, oh no, a flash of hurt. “I mean, I know this is Texas but I thought you guys were cool with it?”
Tony chuckled. “Come here, you,” he said, tugging Steve towards the couch. Steve curled into Tony’s side, tucking his head beneath his chin. Only then did he allow himself to relax, with Tony’s arms wrapped around him.
“I’ll make you a deal,” he announced. Tony eyed him warily. “You don’t stab me, and I’ll help you get out of here. Somehow. I haven’t worked out how yet, but in the meantime I’ll help you get better and clear out some of this shit in the water. Deal?”
Tony slipped out of the room as MJ began regaling Fury with the story of how they found him. He hesitated in the hallway, glancing back at the tough Army sergeant who used to ride his ass about not following regulations who was gazing up at his daughter like he couldn’t believe she was real.
Tony turned and spotted Bruce and Natasha negotiating the rubble, dragging the blonde woman from the entrance hall between them.
“Oh my God. Oh my god, Clint, thank you,” she exclaimed, throwing her arms around his neck and pulling him into a hug.
Frigga leaned forward and patted a stool with a wonky leg, indicating to Bruce that he should sit. He hesitated, just long enough for Frigga to roll her eyes, before sitting down.
“No, I’m dating one of those. This guy, he was weird. And I’m not talking Tony making a pet for his robot weird. This was creepy weird.”
“Love you too,” Steve replied. Lips twitching, he reached down to squeeze Tony’s ass, leaving a lingering kiss on his neck.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Places? What places? Places like Wall Street? That’s a place people get money.”
“I know,” Tony smirked. He nodded behind Steve towards the school. “You know, technically we could sue them, if you want?”
Steve studied Tony’s impassive impression. After thirteen years together, he could read his husband as easily as he read the charts at work.
When they broke apart, Steve beamed at him. He really needed to stop looking at Tony like that, it made his heart do funny things in his chest and Tony had a heart condition. He couldn’t have his heart doing funny things.
“Hey, Nick,” he greeted. “Come to join the party? I think we have a spare pair of festive antlers around here somewhere.”
By the time they emerged in Hell’s Kitchen, Steve felt lighter than he had in days. The feeling - which he still couldn’t name - continued to linger, but it was less now, pushed to the back of his mind by Bucky and laughter.
Tony continued to explain about the stars above them, barely visible to Steve’s eyes through the light pollution. He suspected Tony’s eyesight, much like his hearing, was far above a human’s. The hostility and anger fell away from his face as he talked and Steve realised he’d forgotten to breathe, getting lost in Tony’s face.
“I mean I’m just guessing, but if you wanted to trick someone into a trap, taking their boyfriend would be a pretty good start,” Steve shrugged. “But I think you’d get a better answer to that question if you directed it towards your client. Since he’s the one who kidnapped me.”
“Really? I didn’t notice,” he deadpanned, as though the whole room - the floor and every available surface - wasn’t covered in his belongings. Before he started packing, he thought that it wouldn’t take long because he didn’t have that much stuff. It turned out, he’d accumulated a lot of stuff over the past seven years since he’d moved into the apartment. “Are you going to help or are you just going to be a pain in the ass?”
Jessica doubled over and Matt wrapped his arm around her shoulders. “This happens like twice a week,” he explained. “Maybe more.”
Gritting his teeth, Steve picked up the pace until he slammed his fist into the centre of the bag and it swung away from him.
Tony sat down with a sigh, purposely jostling Foggy with his elbow. Detaching his face from Marci’s, Foggy grinned sheepishly.
“No,” Sharon shook her head instantly. Steve flirting with, well, anyone was unheard of. Not real flirting. He had a boyish charm and would turn on the wide blue eyes whenever they had a patient determined to ignore their instructions, which made them blush and concede, particularly when he beamed at them following their acquiesce. “You’re imagining things.”
They spent the morning watching Netflix. Steve curled into Tony’s embrace, staring at the screen with dull eyes, while Tony’s fingers danced over his phone with the hand not carding through Steve’s hair.
Steve sat up, Zoey perching on his knee so he could unpin the buns on either side of her head, carefully unravelling the braids and running his fingers through her hair to work any knots loose.
“Like shit. My ear hurts.” Steve swung his legs out over the side of the bed, and buried his face into Tony’s stomach. Tony hummed in sympathy.
“And I heard you got sent home early as a disciplinary measure,” Hank Pym said, strolling down the corridor towards him, hands in his pockets. Tony’s heart skipped a beat but he kept his face impassive. He knew all about Pym and Howard’s dislike of each other. Pym studied him. “We both dislike your father,” he said.
Steve had to clear his throat to cover the snort that threatened to escape before he could swallow his laughter. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony wink at him. Steve reached out and took Tony’s hand.
She shrugged, running her spoon around the edge of the bowl to ensure she caught every last drop of ice cream and sticking it in her mouth.
“Then I’d tell you to cut down on how much weed you’re smoking,” Bruce replied, turning and walking away.
The fake shutter sound of a phone camera cut through the conversation, drawing all attention to Natasha, who held her phone aloft.
It took him hours to carry all the files downstairs, dumping them into the old oil drum he’d dragged into the hallway and setting them alight. At first, Steve planned on simply destroying the pages on mers, but then he wondered what else Maria Stark had hidden away in there and his skin crawled again. So he decided to just burn everything. That was the only way he could guarantee Tony’s safety.
“We need to get you a hobby,” Tony shook his head. “One that doesn’t involve antagonising mobsters from… What is that accent even supposed to be? Russian? It doesn’t sound like any Russian accent I’ve ever heard.”
Grabbing the towel, he dried himself off as best he could, scrubbing it over his hair. When he dropped the towel, he found Tony staring at him, his expression unreadable.
Steve plucked the guard’s glasses from his face and shoved them on. He winced. Well, now he could see out of one eye, although the other one was still blurred. Good vision in one eye was better than poor vision in both, right? Then he pulled the gun from the guard’s shoulder holster and headed for the door.
“I mean, I thought it might be nice,” Natasha replied, opening her locker before throwing a glance over her shoulder at Sharon. “Considering you’re my girlfriend.”
Scott’s eyes danced, the little wrinkles at the corners crinkling when he smiled, and that shouldn’t make her melt like that, dammit, Hope! “I’m your idiot,” he crooned softly.
He wasn’t sure any of the rings were really Tony, but he couldn’t deny the way his heart fluttered or the excitement curling in his gut as he stared at them. The corner of his mouth twitched upwards as he pictured a ring on Tony’s finger, looking like it belonged there.
With that, he slipped back into the water and vanished, leaving Steve with his guilt. Tony didn’t reappear for more than an hour, and when he did, he pointedly ignored Steve and instead sharpened his knife against the edge of the pool.
Steve stepped forward. Grasping Steve’s hip bones, Tony pulled him in for a kiss. Between everything that happened the day before and their fight before that, it felt like forever since he’d last kissed Steve. Pulling back a little, Tony’s eyes flickered down to Steve’s lips. He cupped Steve’s chin, running his thumb over the pale stubble on his chin.
“Reminds me of some’a the mob hits back in the day,” Bucky hummed. “I used to know some of the Irish. They could even drink Thor under the table!”
Steve’s heart pounded against his ribcage. He didn’t know what to think. It certainly sounded like something Tony would do, but he didn’t want to think about why or what it could mean.
He remembered the face of the woman in the bar, the cocktail of resigned anguish and love, as she watched the reunions onscreen, and he wondered again who she was waiting for.
“There was a time I thought if I couldn’t make it work with you or Peg, I couldn’t make it work with anyone,” Steve admitted. “But I’m glad he’s proving me wrong.”
“Like locking me in a closet again?” Steve asked dryly, ignoring the shiver running down his spine and refusing to let those memories back into his head. “No. I’ve barely seen him and when I have, he’s been perfectly polite.”
“Well, I am a genius,” Steve mused, his eyes sparkling, “So it’s gonna have to be one hell of a fuck.”
Bruce eyed him, moving towards the door and indicating for Steve to follow him. “Sounds mysterious. What can I help you with?”
“I considered ending it,” he admitted quietly. “I don’t like sitting around, doing nothing while he’s in danger. It’s not who I am. But I’m sure who I am anymore. Being with Tony, it’s changed a lot of things about me.”
“I hate you all,” Barton declared. “Except Natasha because she’s feeding us, and because she scares me.”
Johnny ducked his head and shrank back, wishing he could blend into the wall and be forgotten, ignored. Sometimes he thought he’d like it if Peter was the only one who could see him.
“Steve, this is Warren,” Alexander explained, indicating to the obviously drunk student sitting on the bed, looking dazed and holding his arm at an awkward angle. “Warren here decided that he was going to learn how to fly. Unfortunately for him, he tripped over his shoe lace on the way to the stairs and broke his arm. Can you set it for him?”
Tony placed a kiss against Steve’s hip bone. Then another, moving down. Then another, at the base of his dick. Steve whined and lifted his hips, trying to direct Tony to his dick, like, yesterday. Tony chuckled.
A flash of red caught her eye as she returned to the nurses’ station; glancing up, Sharon saw Natasha heading into a room on the other side of the ER. Her stomach twisted again. Sharon swallowed, pressing a hand against her abdomen.
“Tony, you gotta calm down,” Bucky glowered. “There was a bomb. And an EMP.” Tony’s hands flew to his chest, but before he could panic about the reactor and his current lack of heart attack symptoms, Bucky continued, “The reactor’s fine. Whatever you did after last time worked perfectly. But I’d really appreciate it if you could hit the reboot button on my arm.”
“Yeah, that happened,” he sighed. He wiggled the knife until it came free from the wall and wandered towards the edge of the pool. “Hello?” he called. “I know you’re here. Where else are you going to be?
But there were a lot of gaps between the three of them, and in those gaps, Tony learned to rely on himself. Despite what everyone thought, he did actually know how to keep himself alive without help.
“But… Then I got together with Tony. Alexander was Tony’s mentor during his second year ER rotation, which is how we met.”
He should stop. This wasn’t going to help him suddenly become okay with watching Tony in danger. If anything, this was making it worse.
He returned to the nurses’ station to call the theatre, but he couldn’t help glancing back at Alexander, who looked up and met Steve’s eyes. Steve offered him a tentative smile of thanks, and Alexander smiled and winked, just like he used to back before they were a couple. It brought back memories of those first days after graduating, filled with fear and constantly fighting the feeling of being overwhelmed. And in the middle of all the chaos was Alexander, with a warm smile and a wink when Steve needed reassurance that he wasn’t fucking everything up.
Bruce gaped at Dr. Pym, before hurrying after her. “Uh, Dr. Pym. Hope. Is that it? You’re not- I mean… We have to do something, right?”
Tony wrapped his right hand around Steve’s waist, pulling him close, feeling a little of the tension leave his body as Steve’s hand curled around his shoulder. They began to move, slowly at first, until Tony was sure Steve could follow.
“This kind of perfection doesn’t just happen overnight,” Tony retorted haughtily, climbing out of bed.
Steve hurried into the entrance hall, taking the stairs two at a time and rushing into the bedrooms on that side of the house, running his hands over the walls where there should be a door, if the house’s design made any sense at all.
“Yeah, see, the thing is, I don’t care,” Clint shrugged. “This woman is sick and needs help and we’re going to give it to her.”
Someone who was currently trying to tip herself out of Steve’s arms, risking face-planting onto the floor. Tony chuckled and hefted Ellie out of Steve’s arms and stood her on his thighs, holding onto her waist while she leaned against his shoulders.
“It might,” Tony smiled, leaning in to kiss him. “Although, something that has come out of tonight: I have learned that having a kid around does very bad things for your blood pressure. You sure you want one?”
“I don’t think you’re being stupid or vain,” Steve replied. “Peggy always tells me that court is a power play. No one can afford to show weakness unless they want it to be picked apart. Besides, if it makes you feel good, wear whatever you want.”
Steve pushed his glasses up with his middle finger. He was wearing his glasses instead of contacts today, and any guilt Tony might’ve felt when Steve told him his eyes were too tired for contacts was quickly washed away by his appreciation of how good Steve looked in glasses.
(PS sorry if you got a notification about this chapter yesterday. The "post" and "preview" buttons are right next to each other and I hit the wrong one when checking the html)
“Seven,” Thor beamed. “Just before we made it to the gateway, a Boniboo caught up with us. So Loki conjured a knife and stabbed the Boniboo and it exploded,
The stubble on Tony’s neck caught against his lips, a rough scratch which made Steve shiver as he placed kiss after kiss on the soft skin, breathing in the mix of sweat and soap and expensive cologne. Tony’s hand came up to fist in his hair and Steve let out a quiet hum of approval. When he scraped his teeth gently against his skin, he felt Tony’s sharp intake of breath and smiled, sucking gently on the skin.
“Good,” she smiled. “Can you come with me? There’s something I think you and Peter need to know. And I think you could use the reassurance of seeing him yourself.”
“Earl Grey tea, soy milk, no sugar,” Tony recited, handing him the mug before retaking his seat. “So. This is weird, huh?”
Steve huffed, wiping the water from his eyes. Making his way inside, he found Tony studying him from across the pool.
He wanted to kiss Steve. He really wanted to kiss Steve, because he didn’t on their coffee date, and he regretted it, but now there was the aforementioned six year old chaperone to consider.
“I brought back your knife,” he added, placing it by the water. “Well, I pulled it out of the wall for you. Come on, I just want to talk.”
“I picked the lock on the handcuffs, knocked out the guard, stole his glasses and his gun then shot at you. Sorry about that by the way.”
“They’re the robots built by Luchino Nefaria and Marco Scarlotti,” Steve replied. “They were used to attack the Avengers in Los Angeles and then they were seen again in Washington DC and New York. We found the controls, but Luchino Nefaria was there. He told us that the controls could only be used by him, otherwise they would self-destruct. So I shot the panel.”
The food was delicious, and once he relaxed, Steve found the Avengers easy to talk to. As the night wore on, he settled in. At one point he caught Tony watching him with a proud smile. Feeling brave, Steve lifted their hands - which were once again entwined - and pressed a kiss to Tony’s knuckles, turning his smile into a beaming grin.
She made Steve give her details of every time he’d given Joseph money over the years. Thankfully, by the time Steve was eighteen, Joseph had been asking for more than Steve ever carried, so most of the exchanges were cheques or bank transfers and were therefore visible on his bank statements.
Above him, Tony breathed heavily through his nose, his throat bobbing as he swallowed, and his fingers petting Steve’s hair. His knuckles brushed up against Steve’s dick again, longer this time, and excitement sparked beneath Steve’s skin.
Tony wanted to resist, but he trusted Steve, so he closed his eyes, leaning into the warmth of Steve’s body as he listened to the soothing rumble of his voice telling a story about teenage Steve, Peggy and a “borrowed” motorcycle. He fought against the encroaching sleep, trying to stay awake to fend off the nightmares, but it grew harder and harder.
Steve growled and tried to yank himself free, which only resulted in a painful burn on his arm. He was so busy trying to get free that he completely missed Stane’s hand coming up until it smacked into the side of his head and sent him spinning. Steve stumbled away but Stane still had hold of his arm. His head was spinning and his shoulder ached and he fell to his knees.
“It’s… delicious,” Tony tried. “Although with your allergies, we probably shouldn’t, now I think about it.”
He unlocked his phone, scrolling through the contacts until he found Steve’s number. He wanted to talk to Steve. No, he needed to talk to Steve. He needed to hear his voice and know he was okay, because what if he wasn’t? What if something happened to him? Tony didn’t think he could survive anything happening to-
“Aw, come on, Barton,” Tony called. “We’ve all done dumb stuff. Not me, obviously, because I’m perfect.”
“You know,” Tony continued. “Evie Rose is a big factor in why I fell for you so quickly. Seeing you with her on our first date? That was, uh, that was very attractive. You’re great with kids.”
The red carpet passed in a blur; before he knew it, he was inside, standing in the magnificent entrance hall underneath a modern chandelier, a tangled mass of golden spikes bathing the room in warm light. A blonde woman in a sleek black gown stood between the two entrances to the staircase, directing the guests to the left or the right by some system only known to her.
wasn’t exactly the right word. Came rushing in wearing steel toe-capped boots and carrying sledgehammers would be more appropriate.
It would be so easy to lean across the table and kiss Tony, but Steve knew that wasn’t fair. But, God, he wanted to.
Then he’d sent two photos, the first of his face, Tony Stark’s face, with a newspaper held up under his chin. The second was a close up, this time the paper was held under Tony’s nose, today’s date in full view of the camera. As Steve stared at the pictures, his phone buzzed again with another message.
Then it was like a switch was flicked; Tony yanked off his own jeans and boxers - when he lost his shoes, Steve didn’t know or care - and fell back on top of Steve, their mouths fumbling together as Tony pressed him into the mattress.
Tony chuckled, before crossing the room to corral Hannah, helping Steve to strap her into her highchair, despite her many and vocal objections. Evie Rose reappeared, declaring that Tony had to sit next to
“If you’d asked me that a year ago, I probably would’ve said no,” Tony replied, causing Steve’s heart to sink. “But a year ago, I didn’t know you. Honestly? I’m still not sure about kids as a general concept. But having kids with you?” Tony smiled. “It’s something I’m thinking about more and more.”
They made their way down the front steps and Steve leaned against the wall, smiling when Tony stepped in-between his knees, winding his arms around Steve’s waist and rubbing small circles into the skin with his thumbs. Steve tipped his head back, looking up at Tony for once.
And just like that, Tony’s good mood all but evaporated, only to be replaced by a deep sense of foreboding.
Then Tony’s hips jerked, his sneakers squeaking against the rubber, and making the entire couch wobble, reminding them both of exactly where they were.
“You drank a whole pot less than an hour ago,” Sharon pointed out. “Besides, shift’s over. Don't you want to, I don’t know, sleep?”
A moment later, a rap on the door announced Sharon’s arrival and Rhodey crossed the room to let her in. Out the corner of his eye, Steve saw them kiss each other hello and smiled to himself.
“It’s nothing,” he insisted. “I’ll go make the calls and then I’ll come back for you,” he told MJ, “At the end of Steve’s shift. We can’t go home before then because I forgot my keys.”
He could make out Tony and Clint’s voices above the rest and the strange non-scent that belonged to Thor. Then Steve stepped forward into the room and Natasha was the first one to spot him.
“If your social worker agrees, you can stay with me and Steve until your dad gets himself on his feet. We’re already registered as foster carers in case of emergencies.”
Standing on the threshold of the pump room, Steve gathered his courage even though he felt ridiculously out of his depth. “Alright, you bastard,” he muttered to the machinery. “How do you work?”
“Steve, Ari says that the Avengers aren’t here but you have it under control?” she hissed. “Please, tell me what-”
“My mom had to sell them to bail my dad out of jail,” he admitted, his voice hoarse. “It was one of the few times he was actually around, before he bailed on us for good. Well, except when he needed money. That’s the only thing we’ve ever been good for.” He huffed out a breath. “Damn, you’re good,” he told Matt. “How’d you figure that out?”
A fist smacked into his jaw with a crunch. Tony groaned and let his head fall forward. When he spat on the ground, there were a couple of teeth in the bloody mix.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Matt replied innocently. “Yeah, sure. I can spare a half hour.”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Steve murmured, leaning down to kiss his husband. “What’s your plan for tonight?”
“Come on, let’s go,” Bucky continued, glancing at his watch. “If we leave now, we can catch the next N train into the city - provided you walk faster than Barton.”
“‘Fraid so, kid. But I’m going to send you for an x-ray first. I wanna make sure there’s no broken bones in there. In the meantime, we’ll get you a painkiller.”
Tony held out his hand; Steve flicked the cap open, drizzling it over Tony’s fingers before dropping the bottle and holding onto Tony’s shoulders, shuffling forward on his knees.
Why couldn’t they just focus on Tony? He needed to know Tony was okay, needed to make sure he was alive and unharmed because…
Steve insisted on making Tony breakfast, shooing him onto the sofa when he tried to help. Tony folded himself into the corner, leaning back against the cushions with a soft smile as he watched Steve. Although the anxiety and panic from the night before was gone, he still felt raw and open, and Steve’s presence was the perfect balm. Tony dropped his head onto the back of the sofa.
Post-coital declarations of love were never a good idea though. And it didn’t matter; they were already exclusive and planning on being in it for the long haul. There was no hurry, Steve decided as they cleaned up.
“Well, that’s terrifying,” Tony replied. “And I’m pretty sure that disqualifies you from judging anyone’s love life ever again.”
Natasha stepped out of the cubicle and faltered, recognising the woman standing at the sinks as Pepper. She forced herself to walk forward, flicking on the tap to wash her hands.
Clint narrowly avoided Sharon as she sprinted down the hall, glancing over his shoulder to see her disappear into the restroom. He shrugged. Shifts were like that sometimes. He stepped into the nurses’ station and almost tripped over a pair of feet sticking out from underneath the desk. Steadying himself against the back of a chair, Clint ducked his head and confirmed his suspicion that the feet belonged to Steve.
Scott choked on his cigarette. Hope helpfully slapped him between the shoulder blades, while staring open-mouthed herself at Stark and Steve exchanging soft kisses in front of staff, patients, and the hospital CCTV cameras.
When they emerged from the subway, Tony glanced up at the Tower, taking in the damage. It wasn’t too bad, he thought. Nowhere near the scale of the Battle of New York. At least he didn’t have the outline of a demigod smashed into the floor this time.
Tony kissed him again. “Square deal.” Tony’s attention shifted over his shoulder; his eyes widened and he let out a low whistle. “Is there something in the water around here? Miss Martinelli, you look stunning.”
He looked up with a smile when Tony appeared, his suit replaced by a tank top and pyjama pants, the arc reactor shining dimly through his shirt. Steve put his phone aside then lay down, rolling into Tony’s side to pillow his head on his chest. Sometimes he thought this was his favourite place in the world; in the warmth of Tony’s arms with his heartbeat and the faint thrum of the reactor in his ear.
“I think I owe you an apology,” May announced. “I’m sorry, Johnny. I shouldn’t have blamed you without all the facts.”
“Excellent plan, forget the champagne,” Tony nodded. He brushed the onion into the pan before setting the chopping board aside and wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist.
Sitting cross-legged on the floor, Steve opened the pump up to check off the first item on Tony’s list: clearing dirt and debris from the vents, skimmer and pump baskets. Which turned out to be a really disgusting job. Steve was grateful for his mask because he really didn’t want to think too much about what he was cleaning out of the pump or how long it had been in there. When he was done, he retrieved his antibac hand gel and scrubbed his hands for over five minutes, grimacing whenever he thought too long on the gunk he’d pulled out of there.
“Thor’s fine, I think he’s had worse hangovers; he’s started recovery. I’m pissed but I’m fine, and we’re waiting for Matt’s ears to stop ringing so he can help,” Bucky finished, jerking his thumb over his shoulder. Tony glanced behind him and spotted Matt for the first time. He tried to imagine being blind and losing his hearing and winced.
He straddled Steve’s thighs then leaned forward, placing a lingering kiss against the top of his spine. Steve squirmed beneath him, arching his spine as much as he could under Tony’s weight.
Slowly, so slowly, they lifted the branch from the wound. Tony suppressed the instinctive shudder at the sound. As the branch came free, Tony only had a second to raise an eyebrow at the spike on that thing - no wonder it ended up so deep in this guy’s gut - and tossed it aside.
“So we survived our first fight,” Tony murmured, running his hand down Steve’s spine. Steve shivered, barely resisting the urge to arch into the touch like a cat. Tony grinned, as though he knew what Steve was thinking.
“No. No, Steve. You wrote me a song. That’s pretty much the best birthday gift I could ever get,” Tony smiled. “I just… I thought I understood your side before. And now I’m realising I didn’t. At all. And I’m sorry.”
Steve relaxed, melting into the concrete and gulped for breath. He jerked in surprise when something touched him; a hand, splaying across his shoulder blade.
Eventually, a strange sort of calm settled over him. Rolling onto his back, Steve heaved himself up, sitting with his arms over his knees and taking in the tree house. Typical. Rich people's tree houses were better quality than the apartment he grew up in. The walls were insulated and there were even power sockets around the room. Steve shook his head in disbelief, but then he remembered that Arno Stark died at four and probably never even had the chance to use the tree house.
“I know,” Daniel replied. “Now use your artistic talents and tell me which one is most likely to get me laid for Christmas?”
“If I was lucky, those people were me,” Bucky grinned. His face fell as a thump came through over the comms. “Romanoff? Barton? Speak to me? What was that?”
Scooting forward, he stuck his toe in the pool and flicked water towards Tony. It was a half-hearted effort at best, but Tony laughed anyway. He was still a dick, Steve decided, but Tony had a nice laugh.
“Could be more pleased,” Steve retorted, but if he was trying to sound demanding, the effect was ruined somewhat by the breathy quality that had overtaken his voice and the way his fingers were digging into his arms.
“Most people don’t like knowing they’re dating a certified genius,” he continued. “They say they are, then they get insecure and feel inferior and… it doesn’t end well.”
“You’re not the only one… not looking forward to seeing Nefaria again,” Tony admitted. “I was back there, at the party and the bomb went off and you were gone. And then it was Afghanistan and I was being blown up again, only it wasn’t Yinsen in that cave, it was you and- And then there was that damn wormhole and you weren’t picking up.”
“You never asked me to be mer or human,” Tony continued. “You never tried to change me. You just wanted- Well, maybe not wanted, but. I mean-”
Then his eyes widened in realisation, and his head snapped down, glancing at his leg where the scar from Tony’s knife was visible through the rip in his jeans.
Was Steve’s six year old niece genuinely trying to sell him on Steve? This might’ve been the most adorable thing Tony’d ever experienced. Rivalled only by Steve’s blush as he realised what she was up to.
“So what’s the big deal?” Hope asked, emerging from behind her locker door. “He’s your ex. Did it end badly or something?”
His head felt stuffy and weird and he’d been having the strangest dream about Clint and some cables and a bunch of idiots in tracksuits.
“At least shower,” Rhodey huffed. “And for the love of God, eat something with actual nutritional value. You’re going to get scurvy.”
One of the tenets of urbex - at least for Steve - was never to force access to a property. Trespassing was one thing, but breaking and entering was another. Besides, Steve loved those properties; he wasn’t about to destroy them just so he could explore. To him, that defeated the purpose of the whole thing.
From Ari’s look of terror, Tony guessed it would be a long time before he would be able to call him by name. Leaving the kid to it, he returned to his designs, losing himself in the familiar ones and zeros of the code.
“Yeah, I noticed,” Tony sighed. “Whoever’s working on them, they’re good. Like, me good. This isn’t some kid messing around in their dad’s garage or Justin Hammer. This is someone who knows what they’re doing.”
“Oh, he cut me off. Disinherited me, told me never to show my face again until I was ready to settle down with a nice girl and pop out a couple of kids. I gave him a counter offer where I settled down with a nice guy and adopted a couple of kids but he didn’t take me up on it. Kind of awkward, considering he was, you know, paying for medical school which I was only halfway through.”
But Steve was the only person not here, the only one to vanish without a trace in the explosion, so it was possible-
Tony felt something pressed into his palm; when he looked down, Natasha was pushing her gun into his hand.
“Glad to hear it. Okay, I’m going to go before I make an even bigger fool of myself,” Tony declared, pulling his keys from his pocket and unlocking the car. “See you soon, Steve.”
“Thank you. You gonna say thank you to your dad?” Steve asked. He lifted Ellie up so she could place a sticky kiss on Arnie’s cheek. “Say thank you dad.”
Making his way down the second spiral staircase, Steve found a shower room, no doubt for the Starks’ guests to change in, and a gym filled with exercise equipment which screamed of the eighties, so much so that Steve couldn’t help but smile.
There was a round of applause and the faces of the investors looked much happier than they did at the beginning of the event. Steve could tell that they were no longer seeing Tony Stark’s boyfriend when they looked at him.
“At least you still love me,” Steve murmured, kissing the crown of Hannah’s head, which earned him a scowl from the toddler, who clutched his phone even tighter just in case he was considering taking it away from her. “Or you love my phone at least.”
“Same,” Scott nodded. “What?” he asked when Hope and Clint turned to him with matching expressions of disbelief. “Hey, I notice stuff! Sometimes.”
“Alright, that’s enough,” Bucky said, smacking Tony’s shoulder. “Seriously, there are sick people here. Don’t make ‘em feel any worse.”
Pulling away slowly, Tony fought to catch his breath. When he opened his eyes, he was relieved and delighted to discover Steve looked just as discombobulated as Tony felt.
“Yeah. So to keep his identity secret, Matt keeps his place and officially Bucky lives here. That keeps the worst of the paparazzi from stalking his apartment. They’re just waiting outside, not on his roof where they could regularly bump into Daredevil.”
and Tony was tapping away on his tablet, Steve found the courage to say, “Um, Tony? After everything we spoke about yesterday, well, uh, I know we’re not there yet, but… I’d move to Manhattan for you.”
With a growl of frustration, he let his head fall back, the sun warming his face.He opened his eyes, staring up at the house blindly.
Tony tilted his head, watching Steve curiously. And just like that, the pieces began to fall into place.
Steve gasped, breaking their kiss. When he could breathe again, he mouthed his way down Tony’s throat, biting down on his collarbone.
“For a company that has his name on the building, I don’t think he’s ever set foot in it.” Rhodey rolled his eyes. Steve fought to keep his expression neutral. Rhodey continued, “The only thing he’s interested in is how much money we can make for him.”
“Driving down the Pacific Coast Highway, top down,” Tony decided. “Before the suit, it was the closest thing to flying.”
Was this how Tony felt when Steve was taken by Nefaria? If so, Steve understood Tony’s reactions during the trial a little better now.
“What kind of concerns?” Steve frowned. He was a good teacher, he worked hard and he cared about his kids; what could they possibly have concerns about?
Matt snorted into his coffee. Bucky pretended to glare at him, but the corners of his mouth continued to twitch upwards, until he leaned forward and hid his face in Matt’s hair, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. Steve smiled to himself.
“I was actually looking for you. Although I didn’t know you were you,” Steve added quickly. “I mean, I didn’t know we’d met. No. I didn’t know you were a marine biologist. Or maybe I did. I can’t remember. Um. Should I stop digging?”
“Hey,” Steve said, returning to Tony’s side. “Peg’s starting to clear everyone out. Some of them are going clubbing, if you wanna go, or Peg says we can wait until the kids are in bed and do shots?”
“You say that as though there was something wrong with the Holiday Inn Express Fort Jackson Inn,” Steve teased.
“I wish you were here,” he whispered. “I miss you so much. And I’m so angry that you’re gone. That you left me. You left me with nothing. I miss you so much.”
“I don’t know how you found out about our mutual friend,” Stane continued, “But I knew there was something… fishy about you when you showed up at the party. A suspicion you confirmed when you turned up in my office with Sharon. Shame you involved her in all this. Now she has to die too.”
“Yes. No,” Tony replied. “No.” He tossed his tools aside once more and stood up. “I’ve got to see a man about a dog.”
“Tony never wanted to hurt you,” Steve said. “Neither of us did. We made mistakes but we shouldn’t let them affect our work.”
“Hey, Tony?” Steve called, pushing open the door to the workshop with his foot while Ellie babbled in his ear.
The kisses slowed, morphing into soft pecks and brushes of lips. Steve was grateful for Tony’s iron-like grip around his waist because he wasn’t sure he could trust himself to stand on his own, not with adrenaline and lust and love coursing through him, spreading out from where Tony was now pressing lingering kisses against his neck.
Tony nodded then floored the accelerator so quickly that Steve was pushed back into his seat. He laughed, shaking his head.
“I don’t want to know,” Steve interrupted. “I need some plausible deniability. What do you want from me?”
“Well, I’m going to run a few more tests just to make sure you’re okay,” Natasha continued. “But I promise, I’m going to try and get you out of here as soon as possible.”
Tony dumped the sheet and the blanket on the couch, all but tossing the bag of trash aside. Steve caught Tony’s hand, tugging him towards his bedroom.
“Sharon, I swear to God,” he groaned, levering himself off of the couch. “If you’ve broken bed rest, Natasha is going to kill me.”
Steve lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. Then he sat up, swinging his legs out of bed, and crossing to the dresser. He picked up the books, before leaning down and yanking open the bottom drawer, shoving them under his
Tony grinned like an idiot, relieved there was no one but Happy to see him practically bounce in his seat at the thought of seeing Steve again.
Steve almost laughed. He’d been fighting in alleys since he was knee-high to a grasshopper and as skinny as one.
“Yeah. They’re these assholes over in Bed-Stuy who’ve been terrorising the neighbourhood,” Clint explained. “They were, uh, not impressed with me poking around so they told me to get lost.”
Turning to the final door, Steve’s eyebrows raised. In the same clown-themed wooden letters as the nursery, it read
“I wasn’t. I knew you’d find me.” Steve hoped his smile wasn’t as wobbly as it felt. “You always find me.”
Glancing at the little red dot in the bottom of the HUD, Tony decided it was time to make a swift exit.
“It’s either gossip about you and Steve or I have to start listening to the Tac Team wax lyrical about Cap’s biceps.”
“Shut up Stark,” Marci called, without looking up from the laptop screen she and Foggy were hunched over.
Tony woke with his face in Bucky’s neck and Bucky’s head propped up on his own, snoring quietly. Letting out a quiet groan, he glanced around the quinjet, instinctively seeking out the rest of his team. Natasha was in the pilot’s seat and Bruce was curled up in a ball where he’d been when Tony fell asleep. There was Thor, looking none the worse for wear despite the fact they’d been fighting his evil ex-girlfriend in Norway for the past three days, trying to avoid getting hit by one of her enchantments. And directly opposite Tony and Bucky was Clint, his elbows on his knees and hands clasped, his head hung low.
. He left the city lights behind, chasing after the Guiletta as she left the river for the open sea.
“One, maybe I care about more than just getting laid,” Tony pointed out. “And two, he had his six year old niece with him.”
“Uh, actually I thought I’d get some for you,” Steve explained. “There’s probably enough for Sharon too, if you wanted to invite her over. But if you guys have plans, don’t worry about it. There’ll be leftovers tomorrow. Although I would not put money on there being any spring rolls left. Fair warning.”
Guilt swarmed through Steve’s veins. Some of it must’ve shown on his face, because Rhodey added, “But if I do, it’s for a good cause.”
“Good evening, Dr. Pym,” Romanoff replied without looking up from her paperwork. “How can I help you?”
“No,” he replied, frustration evident. “There’s obviously something wrong - I can see there’s something wrong - but I have no idea what it is. I’ve run every test I can think of and nothing. Her CAT and CT scans are clear. There is nothing wrong with her on paper, but look at her.” He gestured towards Frigga Borson who was swaying back and forth in front of the coffee machine.
Steve stared at the ceiling and wished he could fall asleep. But despite the exhaustion that had plagued him all day, now that it was dark outside and after midnight, he was wide awake and his mind seemed determined to focus on the incident at the Stark House.
When Steve woke again, Tony was drawing circles on his back with his fingers. As soon as he looked at Tony’s face, Steve knew that he hadn’t managed to get any more sleep and his heart sank.
Bruce bristled at the casual and offensive description of his patient - and wow, that protectiveness appeared quickly - but before he could argue, Dr Pym asked, “Is she under arrest?”
Steve stumbled forward and Tony was pulling him in, then Tony was scenting him properly and Steve buried his face in Tony’s neck to scent him back.
“Well, I’ll give you some peace,” Harry blurted out, disappearing from his side before Steve could say anything.
“Steve, I told you to stop smoking behind the bleachers.” Off Steve’s glare, Tony added, “Sorry, go on.”
“You’re wrong. Being with you means holding your hand and washing your hair when you can’t. It means making you toast and apple, and cleaning up when you puke it back up fifteen minutes later. It means doing whatever it takes to make you feel better, because I don’t care that your body doesn’t listen. I don’t care, Steve. I care about you,” he declared. “I care about you.”
“This was it,” Tony whispered. “You wanted to warn me. And they murdered you. They murdered you for trying to do the right thing, you idiot.”
Steve didn’t know what to say. He didn’t really want to get into the ins and outs of their break-up in front of a drunk kid, but he wasn’t willing to just let this go either.
Except… That alcove made no sense. It wasn’t even an alcove, just a section of wall set back two inches for no obvious reason.
Tony found Steve slumped on the floor, leaning over the trash can, his skin pale and with a sheen of sweat. Tony’s heart jumped.
“Gimme five minutes to eat this and get my shoes,” he mumbled around the sandwich. “And we’ll drive over, yeah?”
Did omegas let alphas they weren’t bonded to scent them if they were upset? Or was that another thing that was technically acceptable but there was a lot of judgement surrounding it?
“Obadiah Stane,” Stane said, shifting his tumbler of what looked like whisky to his other hand and sticking his cigar between his teeth.
“No, Rhodey,” Tony laughed. “I love him. I’m in love with him. As in rainbows and sparkles and all that bogus Valentine’s Day shit. I love him.”
Tony nodded. “This is MJ. She’s his kid. According to the VA, he’s on a list for housing and has no registered address but Wilson suggested we check out the homeless camp here.”
(Her favourite dinner pastime was throwing peas at Thor, which he took with tremendous grace, always declaring that Ellie had a warrior’s aim when she nailed him in the ear.)
They stepped outside, took three steps into the night before they were dazzled by white lights bursting into life.
But neither of them moved for another five minutes, before separating and grabbing the soap, taking it in turns to wash each other.
“You’re a mess, Rogers,” Tony sighed. He looked angry, which made no sense, because it wasn’t Steve’s fault the asshole decided to kick the crap out of him because he refused to let the asshole walk all over him. “Even for Josie’s, you look less than respectable.”
“Don’t malign my security systems, Steve,” Tony teased. He took Steve’s right hand in his left, wrapping his right arm around Steve’s waist. “JARVIS will take it personally.”
Steve tapped his fork against the edge of the bowl, chewing slowly. Then, sticking his fork in his mouth and holding it between his teeth, he switched to Google Scholar and tried again.
. As if we weren’t already doing that. Does she think I like seeing them speculate how long it’s going to be before I break up with you? Or, or being compared to your exes, or having them dig into my friends’ lives looking for dirt on me? I know it’s a price I gotta pay but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. I’m not just Tony Stark’s boyfriend.”
The smell of spices tickled Steve’s nose as he followed Tony into the communal kitchen. He breathed slowly, wishing his anxiety would just go away.
He’d known Ms Edwards’ secretary, Rebecca, as long as he’d worked at the school. They’d spent the Christmas party two years ago talking about art because her wife worked at MoMA. They were what he would tentatively call work friends.
“Serving or addiction? Because I know about both. A little over forty-eight hours ago, I was in Afghanistan with my unit. And when I was a resident, I was hooked on prescription painkillers.”
“She’s been off lately but it became so bad tonight that I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I will return later to collect her and I expect you to have answers for me, Dr. Banner, do I make myself clear?”
“I know that,” Steve grumbled, his forehead taking on the most adorable crease. “I just want to know if there’s, if there’s anyone else.”
“Alright, alright,” Tony laughed, still walking backwards, until his calves hit the end of the bed. Steve stepped right into his space wrapping his arms around Tony’s neck and leaning in to kiss him. “You are criminally good at that,” Tony murmured.
“Because even when I was actively pushing him away,” he said slowly. “Rhodey never gave up on me. I was dying and trying everything to push him away because I thought it would be better for both of us if he didn’t have to see that. He wouldn’t let me. And I thought, maybe, I could… be your Rhodey.” He pursed his lips. “It was probably stu-”
“Look, give it a few days, give yourselves some space to calm down. Then sit down and talk,” he suggested. “Really talk. No yelling. And tell him you love him already because, Jesus Christ, Steve, Tony’s the only person who doesn’t know it yet.”
“Oh. Good,” she declared, her chin jutting out. But Tony saw her lip wobble and wrapped his arm around her shoulder, giving it a squeeze.
There was something surreal about watching Tony Stark wait in line at his favourite coffee shop, Steve decided, tapping his nails against his Kandinski phone case. He thought he was past the stage of internally going
“Uh… I decided it’s time,” Steve said, holding onto Ellie as she leaned down to pat her hands against Tony’s cheeks.
Steve’s hand curled around his fingers, his grip lax compared to his usual strength and Tony kissed his shoulder, then again, and once more as Steve shuddered in his arms.
mean what Steve hoped he meant. Even if he was looking at him that way, the same way Rhodey looked at Sharon sometimes, like she was the most wonderful person in the world.
Tony pecked Steve on the cheek. Then he chivvied Steve out of the booth, leaving a tip on the table for Josie, and slipped his hand into Steve’s as they walked out.
“I’m dreaming,” Bruce shook his head. “Or you’ve murdered me and are burying my body in the Hollywood Hills because that’s, that’s a mer… There’s a tail.”
When he arrived at the Stark Mansion, Steve headed straight for Howard’s office. He jogged down the spiral staircase without calling out a hello to Tony or giving Tony any indication that it was him. The office door was still swollen and needed all his weight to open it. That fact was probably the only thing that had kept years of thieves, homeless people, and explorers from rummaging through Howard’s papers and finding potentially damaging evidence of Tony’s existence.
“Nah,” Steve replied. “Besides, I’ve got more important things to worry about. Like a romantic holiday with my boyfriend in Singapore.”
“Instead, they gave him the company,” Steve retorted. “You didn’t like that, did you? All those years you worked for them, and they chose Tony over you.” He laughed. “Oh, I wish I coulda seen your face when you read the will and found out they left everything to him.”
“Harmless,” Bruce echoed flatly. He looked between the two of them and their barely concealed laughter and terrible poker faces. “That’s Frigga Borson, as in the Borson family. As in the hospital’s biggest donors.”
“Know what? You’re right,” Tony retorted, running out of patience for whatever was going on in Clint’s head. Coulson was obviously talking out of his ass when he said that Clint wanted his help. “Cut them all. What on earth could untangle this disaster?”
“Isn’t it just?” Daniel grinned, bouncing Hannah in his arms, causing her bat wings to flap back and forth and Tony to let out a high-pitched squeak.
Something in Natasha’s expression must’ve given it away because Pepper’s face fell and Hogan’s took on a resigned acceptance.
“What the fuck?” Clint exclaimed. “Seriously? Is there anyone else hooking up around here that I don’t know about?”
Shouts of affirmative came back to her from the fire crew and paramedics as she turned back towards the SUV. Stark was already hanging upside down through the sunroof again, murmuring reassurances to Laura. He glanced up as Maria approached - or was it down?
The kiss was nothing more than a brush of the lips and yet it was enough to make Steve feel weak at the knees.
Steve chuckled. He felt a shiver run down Tony’s spine and smiled into his neck. “You know I don’t care about any of that,” he added. “I’d rather have you here, with me. If you said tomorrow that you were quitting the Army, I wouldn’t have a problem with it.” He circled his hand around Tony’s dog tags. “You could, you know. Quit. We could finally put down some roots somewhere.”
He carefully avoided mentioning that the thing he was attending the following day was at Stark Industries. He wasn’t sure how Tony felt about Howard’s company and he was afraid it might ruin their friendship if he mentioned that Rhodey and Sharon worked there. But neither was he willing to refuse their invite. They were slowly building a friendship, and as much as Steve cared about Tony, he wouldn’t be around forever. He’d finished his course of antibiotics and looked healthier than ever. As soon as Steve worked out how he was going to get Tony out of the house and down to the ocean, Tony would be free and Steve would never see him again.
But at the same time, it was more than that. Maybe, if Tony wasn’t quite so good at taking care of himself, he would’ve needed her more. Maybe he could’ve confided in her. Maybe they would’ve worked out.
“You wanna get up or stay in bed?” he asked, combing his fingers through Steve’s sweaty hair, carefully working the knots free.
“Here.” Steve pushed Ellie into Clint’s arms, ignoring his squawk of protest. “I need you to watch her for a little while.”
Steve dragged himself through to his bedroom and curled up into bed to try and sleep. But it quickly became apparent that it wasn’t happening.
Bruce looked at him in confusion, but he seemed no more convinced. Which meant it was time for Steve’s last ditch attempt. If this didn’t work then… Well, maybe he could offer Bruce a blow job. And if
“No, no, come on,” Steve hissed, shaking the handle. There was a buzzing in his ears and his palm slipped against the handle and he had to get out of there. “Fuck, come on!”
“Not that many for a normal person, or not that many for an idiot who throws himself into danger for no good reason?”
Oh. Of course. It was so obvious now. Of course he loved Steve. How had he managed to miss it? He smiled to himself.
Tony led the way to the nearest Ample Hills Creamery, Evie Rose skipping along, hand in hand with Steve. Steve shot Tony a rueful smile, but Tony shook his head.
There were two spiral staircases in the room, one going down, probably to a basement of some sort, and one going up. Steve decided to head up. He grinned as he passed the bar with its golden taps, before reaching out and letting his hand trail over the bannister of the red painted staircase. Tipping his head back, he spotted two stained glass windows, one on the wall and one on the roof. Both features designs of mermaids, of course, and the California sun spilled through, bathing the floor in bright blues and yellows.
“Are there good parts of Brooklyn?” Romanoff asked. Steve eyed her uncertainly; it almost felt like she was teasing, but he couldn’t be sure. His normal response, to leap to Brooklyn’s defence, was waylaid by his knowledge that she would and could kick his ass before he knew what was happening.
“Everything I survived and I’m going to die at the hands of a James Bond villain reject?” Tony complained. “No. I refuse to let someone who unironically uses the word
“Happy,” the redhead sighed, blocking his attempts to get off of the gurney. “Your heart stopped. That’s not okay.”
“Guess I just have one of those personalities. Can I get something for this pain?” Wilson winced, squeezing his eyes shut. “I haven’t felt this much pain since Bea Arthur died, God rest her soul.”
“Yeah,” he nodded. “It restarted. But for about half a minute, I couldn’t move, and I had this pain in my chest, and… And…” He let out a shuddering breath.
“I don’t know,” Marci mused on Foggy’s other side, eying Matt and Bucky speculatively. “It’s kinda hot. What?” she asked when Tony and Foggy turned to stare at her in disbelief. “They’re hot guys, and they’re making out. That is literally the plot of hundreds of porn movies.”
“Nice,” Tony grinned. He sat up, bouncing up and down once, twice, three times, before unpacking his own bag of takeout. “Alright, which is mine?”
“What if you’re wrong?” Steve muttered, running a hand through his daughter’s hair. “Tony, he’d do anything for the people he cared about. Without hesitation. It’s just how he is. What if- what if this doesn’t mean what you think it does?”
Steve let out a pitiful whine when Tony managed to pull the blankets away, his entire body shaking. Tony couldn’t resist pulling Steve into his arms, letting Steve use his shoulder as a pillow. Sharing body heat probably wasn’t a good idea when Steve was giving off heat like an engine, pressed up against his side, but Tony couldn’t be that cruel.
“How’s it going?” Dr. Romanoff asked, sticking her head into the room. Bruce glowered at her and Dr. Romanoff chuckled. “That good, huh?”
“I’m pregnant. Just before we got together, I hooked up with this guy. Things happened, and it turns out more things happened than I planned. That’s why I didn’t want to go to your parents’ anniversary party.”
“Uh, that’s exactly what I do,” Bucky retorted, tossing the phone to Marci, who caught it with the precision that would’ve made Clint proud.
When Steve entered the exam room, his heart sank. He didn't know who he was least happy to see: Alexander, or the patient lying on the gurney with what looked like a crossbow arrow through his shoulder.
your help. But if you want to leave, then leave. If you want to help me save a life, then get over here and I’ll give you a boost.”
“Her skull is separated from her spinal column,” Stark murmured. “I can see them moving separately with each breath she takes. Shit. The only thing holding her skull in place is the neck muscles. The good news is she still has motor control in her extremities so the spinal cord isn’t severed. I’m going to sedate her and then we can get her out of here. I need you to call the hospital, have Danvers on standby. The minute we get back, she’s going straight into OR.”
“It wasn’t my first try,” Steve replied, silently repeating Peggy’s advice not to give them any more than they asked for.
It wasn’t a lie. Alexander had always looked good for his age. Steve knew how much effort went into his looks, between the twelve step moisturising routine that Steve had memorised once upon a time to the personal trainer that Alexander worked with twice a week. With that easy smile and the twinkle in his bright blue eyes, Steve could see the man he’d fallen for.
that through the mess of his last relationship falling apart, it led to him gaining Angie as a roommate and a friend. He would almost say he would go through it all again if it meant he came out of it with her friendship at the end.
He continued through the upstairs of the house, exploring the master suite, marvelling at the chandelier which hung above the entrance hall, and grimacing in horror at the room whose decor could best be described as the most hideous Hawaiian shirt Steve had ever seen. The worst part was the matching bathroom. He snapped several photos, both for himself and to send to Bucky, as he made his way through the house.
“Scott, can you tell her lawyer friend that she’s okay?” Dr. Romanoff asked. “Steve, since she’s still out, let’s keep her on high-flow oxygen?”
“Luchino Nefaria told me a sob story about his Nazi grandparents. I wasn’t impressed. But it gave me the chance to pick my handcuffs while he was distracted. Then he left, and I was alone with the other man.”
Part of him wanted to get out of here, return to the pool and try to talk to Tony. But something else told him to investigate this door, that there was something he needed to see behind it. Which was ridiculous, because how could he possibly know what was in there without looking? It was probably just a storage room or a bathroom. The house had a ridiculous amount of bathrooms, after all.
“Hey. Just an idea. But. We’re exclusive. So why don’t we get tested, and then we don’t have to use condoms if we don’t want to?” Tony suggested.
“Then I want to fuck you until I come inside you,” Tony murmured, his lips brushing Steve’s ear. He nuzzled Steve’s cheek. “I want to be as close to you as possible.”
He wasn’t going to give Steve up, because he loved Steve and if Steve loved him then they could make it work without sacrificing parts of each other. Tony was willing to compromise to find a way to be with Steve and be Iron Man and he suddenly
They lapsed into silence, and Steve allowed himself to relax fully for the first time since he said goodbye to Tony in an airfield five months ago. He could feel Tony’s heart beating through his chest, a steady reminder that Tony was here, he was safe, he was home.
“Hey,” Steve said, taking in Tony’s rumpled suit and his eyes, tight and tired, although they softened when they fell on Ellie.
And so they settled into a routine: every day Bucky went to watch the trial and reported back in the evening, while Steve took Tony sightseeing. They tried to fly under the radar as much as possible - and Tony was very good at not being noticed when he wanted to be - but their presence in DC for the trial was heavily publicised, so they often found themselves being approached. The majority of the fans were friendly and polite, so Steve found he didn’t mind too much. And several voiced their support for him in the trial, which definitely helped.
Tony leaned against the wall, smiling at the passing agents from behind his sunglasses. They looked at him with either awe or suspicion, and a select few managed to pull off both expressions at once. He pulled out his phone to make it look like he was doing something important, when in reality he was trying to beat Bucky’s high score on Angry Birds just to piss Cap off.
Despite his earlier words about not caring if Steve liked the Avengers, he could read the relief in his boyfriend’s eyes. Steve glanced between Tony’s eyes and his lips, his stomach twisting in anticipation, before leaning in and kissing Tony gently. The kiss deepened and when Tony pressed his palm into Steve’s sternum, Steve allowed himself to be pushed backwards until his back hit the elevator wall.
“Hey, uh, Wanda, is it?” Tony asked, glancing at the red-headed nurse sitting at the computer. “Do me a favour and get me the full medical history of my patient, name Wade Wilson? Thanks.”
“I know I’m weak,” Steve explained, his voice wobbling. “Not standing up to him. I don’t need anyone else to tell me that.”
“Whatever you want to do,” Tony replied. He peered over Steve’s shoulder. “Is that the girl Angie was talking about?”
“Want me to stop?” Tony asked, trying to keep his hips as still as possible, but unable to stop them jerking forward entirely. If Steve was oversensitive, he didn’t want to push him.
, emphasis on might - be,” he explained. “It’s a pretty rough part of town though. Don’t suppose there’s any chance of me convincing you not to come with me?”
The pumpkin mask hid whoever was underneath, but whoever it was, they didn’t seem to care they’d been caught staring. Confident, no doubt, in the anonymity their mask gave them. Steve ducked into the crowd, negotiating the bodies until he found Peggy, catching her by the elbow.
“Before you start getting embarrassed, I think it’s really adorable that you were jealous,” Tony murmured.
“I don’t know? I asked Steve to help me find the gloves because day shift keeps rearranging the supply closets, and he was fine. But then we realised the door was stuck and he freaked out. Like, instantly. Completely. He was screaming, crying, like properly terrified. D’you think he’s okay?”
“Where’d you learn to cook?” Steve asked, while wondering if it would be inappropriate to lick the bowl. To his dismay, Tony picked up the bowl to load it into the dishwasher before Steve could make up his mind.
“Come on. Where’s the omega who went into enemy territory against orders with only a prop helmet and shield?”
“Which was more than you were gonna do,” Marci arched her eyebrow again. Damn, that was far too effective. “You were going to wait for that magical moment where your eyes meet across the room, and got that ‘you just know’ feeling in your soul.”
“There’s someone I wanted you to meet,” Steve said, hearing his voice become choked. “And I wanted to do it in person.”
Before too many dark thoughts could force their way into his head, Steve pushed himself further down onto Tony’s finger, pulling him out of his head.
Once he was satisfied the wound was clean, he began dressing it properly. Testing carefully, he still couldn’t put his full weight on it and probably wouldn’t be able to for a couple of days as the skin knitted itself back together. With a shaky breath, Steve stood up, clearing away the first aid kit and hobbled through to the kitchen.
Tony ran his thumb over Steve’s knuckles absently, using him as an anchor so he didn’t fawn over every single cat in the room as they continued their way along the row.
Accessing the Tower was easy with his watch from Tony. One wave of his wrist, and the barriers to the underground parking garage swung open instantly. He followed the illuminated arrows up to the upper level, the one reserved for the Avengers’ private use. He recognised several of the cars from various dates with Tony, before pulling his bike in next to a brand new Ducati. Locking his bike, Steve crossed to the elevator, which opened automatically as he approached.
Clint glanced over his shoulder; Stark was leaning on the other side of the nurses’ station, his head tilted to the side, frowning at Steve.
He waited until Pierce headed towards the locker room, then turned towards his husband. His husband who was being uncharacteristically silent and smirking to himself.
Hank turned to Romanoff, raising an eyebrow at her and feeling a wave of delight at her expression. Who knew all it would take to wrong-foot the ever cool and collected Dr. Romanoff was one of her nurses expounding the virtues of Anthony Stark?
“What are you doing here?” Hope called, running to meet Tony and the paramedic pushing a gurney into the ER.
“Just follow my lead,” Tony replied, holding out his hand. His heart pounded in his ears. “Trust me?”
living there, so he’d made the decision: the house would go, and then the land could be sold. Privately, he’d decided the money from the sale would go to Bruce’s new conservation project. After all, Steve didn’t need the money, not anymore.
Steve tried not to frown, but he’d been hoping to avoid the stories the paparazzi were pedalling about him for the night and looking forward to embracing his old life with his old friends for company. And now Daniel and Angie were cooing over one of the very articles he wanted to avoid.
Just in case anyone didn’t get the see them, and therefore missed out on Steve’s profile, here’s what it says:
Panic bubbled in Tony’s throat as his vision was filled with water. While he could and would easily dive underwater, he hated his head being underwater without warning and with his suit suddenly unresponsive, no doubt thanks to Nefaria’s EMP - and clearly he was still alive if he’d managed to activate it - it was near impossible to stay calm.
“Thank you, Your Honour,” Hogarth replied. “Mr Rogers. The events you’ve described on April 13th, they sound… terrible. Traumatising. Certainly not your average Monday night. It must’ve been very disturbing, yes?”
in the upper right corner. When Tony opened the app, wondering where his self-esteem had gone, it informed him he had two new notifications. With unnecessary exclamation points.
(The fact Tony now considered cuddling on public transit a reward probably said a lot about how far gone he was for Steve, he decided.)
Steve scrolled down the page, eyes scanning the screen. He ignored the pictures of the portrait he’d seen, searching instead for something, anything, where Tony was older.
“Dr. Banner?” He turned to find Dr. Carter sticking her head out of another room. “Can I get a hand in here?”
He had his pup and he had his team, and he had a home in the future. That was more than enough, Steve decided. Hoping for anything more was just greedy.
He knew he needed help - hell, he’d known for a long time, but he’d always convinced himself that he was
(You know, the things that SHIELD had said would be a problem not just for Tony, but for the whole world when they told him to keep his designation and Ellie a secret from the world.)
