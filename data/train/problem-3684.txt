“You are intending to blackmail them with your knowledge of Sarah’s ‘passenger’?” Jimmy asked, shocked at the idea.
“That’s where you’re totally wrong,” Dean replied, with a sorrowful shake of his head.  “I don’t give a damn whether or not these are ‘Guild’ quests. Innocent people are getting killed and stopping that kind of shit is the business we’re in,” he announced firmly. “But I don’t like it when people lie to me or try to play me like this, okay?”
he knew, that it wasn’t the game engine that had created this anomalous illusion. It was Gabriel’s working.
Dean yelped, jumping away from the voice even as he twisted his body and turned to face her, already clutching his dagger.
Oh, it was going to take days, if not weeks, for the bond to sever completely. Even if Dey’n had died in his arms, the bond wouldn’t have simply instantly and dramatically ripped in two. No, that pleasure was confined to his heart. It was that organ which felt as though it had been savagely yanked out of his chest and torn asunder. Definitely the ache he was currently feeling, that deep agonizing emptiness where Dey’n had resided, was a gnawing space filled with a burn far worse than acid reflux.
Like all traditionally raised Alphas, Castiel ruled his wolf in the manner of a cruel despot. He stored it like a spare, though particularly potent, weapon in his arsenal and kept it chained and bound in obedience. He dominated it by sheer force of will. And, in doing so, left himself vulnerable to revolt. Such rigid imprisonment meant he ran the risk of losing control of it entirely if something ever caused his iron will to crumble. The wolf would take the opportunity to exploit even the slightest crack in his defenses. Which was the very reason the black wolf had learned to cunningly wait until Castiel was asleep - and defenseless - before defiantly taking control and sneaking off to cause mayhem of its own.
Dean, who happened to be 30 miles away at the precise moment the elusive neighbor finally returned to Dexter’s.
“Nope. Got nothing,” Loki admitted. “You’re stuck between a rock and a hard-place whichever way you play this.”
so,” Gabriel replied, “but not so much. Avatars have built-in behavioural coding. Works kinda like muscle memory. Wouldn’t make sense for them
He clung on to those ideas, holding them closely to his heart, tiny snippets of hope to pull out and examine like jewels whenever the nights were cold and lonely and he still felt so far from his destination. So far from Dean.
Cas shrugged. “They belong to you and Sam, don’t they? So if it means that much to you, why not do it? It would be easy to get them collected and transported to a restoration garage.”
The Guild Rules themselves were very much a human construct. It was the players, not the game, who had cobbled up a series of so-called ‘rules’ for players. Rules such as not physically attacking other players without provocation if they were unarmed and just out collecting resources.  Rules like that were just social niceties. Breaking a rule, therefore, was not likely to gain you any in-game penalties. It was, however, highly likely to get you thrown out of a Guild for causing unnecessary conflict.
“Don’t remind me,” Dean grunted, dropping his head onto the table and banging his forehead deliberately. “I’m trying not to think about
“So, I assume I can raise the Dagger to level 10 simply by allocating skill points but from then on I am stuck unless I kill another Knight.”
Apparently the entire equatorial zone was littered with Mer habitations, many of them as old as Atlan and many far older. But the Wildlings hadn’t settled in any of them. Instead they constantly navigated between those habitations as they constantly circumnavigated the world. The Wildlings never stayed more than a few weeks at any one location before moving on to the next. What Castiel was still not exactly certain about was why they chose not to settle. Though he knew it was related to the seismic instability of the region, it escaped his understanding completely why they hadn’t simply relocated to an area more suitable for long-term settlement.
“Omega,” Samuel Campbell breathed, from the doorway of the dungeon, his voice peculiarly raspy and his expression a twisted mask of hunger.
The Reaper looked uncertain for a moment. “I don’t believe they did. I think they were simply feeling their own mortality because they were faced with such an onerous task. Or, perhaps, Richard saw it as a hugely romantic gesture. Proof of his commitment to your mother. But I could be wrong. Your mother was always… peculiarly perceptive. Attuned more to matters best described as spiritual perhaps.  I know for certain she had approached Woolfe several days earlier and had him swear he would take care of you and your brother in the event of her death.  I would hesitate to call her fears precognition but, certainly, she was careful to
The L’Astrolabe had already been docked in geosynchronous orbit above Arthos for over ten tiresome hours before Dean finally managed to grab his belongings and disembark via one of the ship’s fully automated supply tenders. Since the entirety of his possessions fitted easily inside a single backpack, the delay was not related to his last minute packing nor even the time he had taken to consider the gruffly-made offer from the Chief Engineer, Rufus - when he picked up the few credits he’d earned during the last eighteen months - that he should stay on-board the vessel at least until Vantixian.  It was simply that Interstellar Cruise Ships had strict hierarchies.
. So I don’t know what the fuck RRE is up to with this shit, but I know for damned sure Sam isn’t involved.”
Now that Dean had intimate proof that Cas had the physicality of a mythical Qui Praevalen in every respect, it probably would have been more improbable for him to
Jimmy chuckled softly. “Garth may have hidden talents,” he said, then shrugged and said, “though I too struggle to envisage a situation in which he might prove uniquely useful.”
Since Castiel had been in the process of taking a drink, he spluttered and almost choked. “You’re WHAT?”
“Maybe Chuck’s wrong,” Dean gasped, clutching at straws.  “Maybe the whole idea of players dying in the other world is complete crap. You said yourself he only
And Dean wasn’t sure whether he was relieved or frustrated by the fact that while he was still struggling to find the right words for a reply, the road curved to the left to reveal Ash and Charlie standing in wait for them under a large signpost marked ‘River Grove’.
“Fuck you,” Milton replied. “I wasn’t on his side, Wasn’t on anyone’s side. I just reluctantly agreed to keep the options open. “
“You and me, Gabe. Or just me, preferably, but I kinda think you won’t go for that. So, you and me, we get in the tender and hare off back the way we came.  Michael will have to change course and come after us, and there isn’t time for him to then reverse course and intercept this ship again until it’s already close enough to Nova to be slowing down to dock anyway. That way Meg, Charlie and Dor are guaranteed to be safe.”
“I’m impressed you know it at all,” she assured him. “You have good lips though. It’s always difficult with a stranger, but less so with you than most people. I’m very pleased you came to see me, Cas. I would have come to visit you myself, except Dean claims you never answer your door,”
Since he’d consequently discovered that framing what he wanted to say in the form of the written, rather than the spoken, word was financially beneficial, he no longer even stressed overmuch about his social awkwardness.
She was impressed by the detailed interior. Although the bar had a rough and rustic vibe, the programmer in her was delighted by all the authentic touches that had been painstakingly added by whoever had written the code that formed the Roadhouse environ.  Even despite the limitations of the VR rig Ash had put together for her, stepping inside the Roadhouse genuinely felt like walking into a real life bar.
Castiel cocked his head in a distinctly Jimmy-like mannerism, and blinked slowly as he considered Dean’s words. Eventually, with a sigh of defeat he nodded. “I believe you may be correct. The situation is particularly germane given that you need to understand the particular value to humanity of this world’s virtual intelligences. However, I hesitated to impress that particular fact upon you in view of my father’s machinations. I find myself in somewhat of a quandary now that I no longer trust the original orders I was previously following.”
So Gabriel was already back in the Pack House, waking Charlie with the news, before he even remembered he had run out of the dentists before even getting his damned tooth fixed.
Charlie had been right, he knew. By rejecting Michael - the fucker - as he had, he had caused possibly irreparable harm to the Dominant. If Michael had been Prae, leaving him might even have literally killed him - not that Dean would have lost sleep over that prospect - but the idea of harming Cas would be unconscionable.
“Obviously, there would then be no further income from Moondoor itself but I believe the Utility side of the business would be more than sufficient financial compensation for your efforts, should that consideration also play a factor in your decision.”
“I explained he was incognito,” Castiel advised imperturbably. “It is, indeed, a most clever disguise. I do not believe anyone will deduce his true identity.”
so is totally autonomous, but he can presumably level up his base character player just by existing inside it.”
”That makes sense,” Charlie said, ignoring his self-pity. “Thralls wear out if they aren’t renewed.  If you hadn’t seen them in New Orleans, I expect the thrall would have worn off at least five or six years ago.”
brain is more like the house of a hoarder. I feel like I’m trying to squeeze past ceiling-high stacks of old newspapers. Do you even
The matriarch turned to aid the fallen cow, but found herself face to face with the snarling face of the huge black Alpha wolf. She charged it once, using her head to impact it, to bowl it off its feet, but even as it was knocked aside, whimpering at the pain of its shattered rib cage, its fangs sank into her cheek, ripping flesh, and now she was bleeding from two places and, in the distance, she could hear the lowing moans of her herd, could see the helpless thrashing of the old cow under the savage attack of the white wolf.
“Don’t bite him,” Gan snorted. “This is all just a game. Having an asshole Sargent is necessary scene setting.”
”Good,” Bobby said.  “Get one waiting for us at Sioux Falls tomorrow morning. Flying commercial is too much of a ball’s ache with my chair. “
So Hell had gradually filled with a myriad of suitable NPC’s too.  From the general brothel area to the more hardcore dungeon areas, all of Crowley’s employees were virtual ones. They didn’t require salaries, they never went on strike and if any of the customers were a little over-enthusiastic, the NPC’s eventually respawned so no real harm was done (though Crowley always debited a fine from the Customer’s credit cards anyway).
Then he threw the Six grenades up over his head, activated his own mana shield to protect himself, and detonated them.
“Of course I am,” Ruby shrugged. “Why would I go out on a limb for you? I barely even know you. But…” she smirked at him, “It would be mutually advantageous if my report is made
But, as quickly as the wolf snarled at him, it seemed to come to its senses and the fury in its eyes was replaced by a flash of sudden, horrified recognition.  At that moment, as the wolf realized it had just snapped at its Omega - its would-be mate - all five Creiche on board the truck - including the Sargent who now smelled of urine and terror - jumped off the flatbed and hared off in the same direction as the now fleeing zombies.
“Um, yeah,” he agreed carefully, reminding himself that Dexter’s ethos was to give someone what they needed. Even if what they ‘needed’ was an opportunity to vent about Dean.
The rabbit was such a cute little thing, he thought, as he swept up the worst of the debris from the floor before using the ladder to collect all of the dusty books from the shelves and pile them in the center of the room.  The books smelt musty and old, but weren’t actually damp or rotting so they were probably worth trying to save.
Still, he told his smug wolf, you were right that Cas would offer me a fourth option.  Let’s just hope that
She had a carefully rehearsed bullshit reason ready to explain her reason for wanting to visit Poughkeepsie. There was no way in hell she was going to tell Neomin that she wanted to meet with Sam Winchester.  She had no doubt the St Petersburg Wolves were already well aware that the Campbell Heir had survived. If Crowley knew of him, then her parents did too.  She had no intention of showing her hand too soon. Although, since Castiel would never produce offspring of his own, she was surprised her parents hadn’t already been in contact to advise her the Campbell Heir had survived. Surely they themselves could see what was so obvious to her. Anael would have thought the opportunity Winchester offered would be clear to her parents.
After all, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if Jimmy never returned to Moondoor, would it?  He, Charlie, Ash and even the ubiquitous Benny were fully capable of handling everything themselves.  They didn’t actually
”Something I should know?” Cas asked carefully. He and Dean were still slowly building a relationship and Cas was delicately traversing a thin line, picking his way between his natural instinct to jump in and defend his mate from any possible perceived danger and his knowledge that Dean would react aggressively towards any attempt to do so.  Dean fluctuated between finding his protective instincts patronising and ‘cute’, but he made it clear that neither were actually
Sam’s mouth opened and closed several times before he managed to say, “You’re claiming you’re keeping him alive?”
lemonade. Castiel’s never going to be stupid enough to see this as anything other than you making the best of a bad deal. He doesn’t deserve to be your second-best choice.”
“Lady, you need to seriously re-examine your life if that’s true,” Dean snorted, though he too was finding the combat more reminiscent of a heavy exercise session than a serious, life-threatening situation. How things had changed, he thought to himself. Less than a week earlier, the same levels of demons in Crowley’s dungeon run had been terrifyingly dangerous. Although the Hell Hounds were still problematic because of their size and speed, so he thanked god that Ash had made them visible.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed.  “So maybe all I need to do is keep ensuring my FP builds faster than my SP and they will cancel each other out. Or something…”
To be on the safe side, though, he started with just a text message to let Dean know his new number.
"So, it’s a bit late to get to Kansas today even if we don’t stop to eat first,” Castiel said. “I was thinking, perhaps we should stop at St Louis tonight instead. Finish the trip
”You could just thrall them to stay behind,” Charlie suggested, when he asked her to temporarily disable the cameras between the house and the guardhouse while Gabriel distracted them with some inane discussion or other.
“We’re going to look like the three musketeers by the time she’s finished,” Ash laughed, as Dean showed off the marking.
“It could be worse,” Ash offered.  “At least Bobby warned all the members of the Hunters Guild not to log in with immersion tanks. There can’t be
“Supposedly,” Dean agreed. “Maybe now all our cards are on the table, it would be possible to at least attempt to build an honest friendship between us. Maybe that will be sufficient.”
“Dean’s right that it would have made perfect sense for the actual spending of SP to have been considered a corruptible act in itself. If using FP reduces FP and they are supposed to be the diametric opposite of SP, then spending SP ought to
have been a way to talk to her. Even if the V.I.’s couldn’t have actually healed her, she could have spent those last years of her life ‘living’ in Moondoor, rather than simply dying on a life support machine. I would have been able to visit her. I would have had the chance to say a proper goodbye. How do you put a price on that, Penelope? How can you say
One way or the other, he somehow felt this was a moment that had always somehow been inevitable. This had
Lucky-Goldstar was far from convinced that the tanks it had manufactured on behalf of VPL would make anybody’s lives ‘better’. It had, in fact, a great number of concerns over both the safety of the tanks and their potential for misuse.
In fact all profits from the event would be donated except for Jeff’s since—conveniently—no one had ‘remembered’ to tell the old man what the rest of the townsfolk were doing.
“Are you STUPID?  We don’t want weapons. That’s my Mariposa. Go get him and if he gets so much as a scratch in the process you will not like the consequences.”
And, even more peculiarly, it appeared that Richard Roman hadn’t written a single line of code since 1991.
humans living on Earth. They self-populated the material world like an unchecked virus. Was the life of just
“I haven’t seen many fish around here,” Castiel said. He didn’t bother remarking on the fact they weren’t in a ‘river’. He supposed to a creature more used to living in the wildness of the open ocean, the tamer sea of the channel would seem as tiny as a river.
“You’re so sweet, Sammy. Just like Raphael said you were. So I’ll tell you a secret,” she smiled at him mischievously.
So Dean spent the next four hours simply riding the Anakorn in the direction Ash had suggested, and trying hard not to drown in the feelings of dread that had enveloped him since the earlier conversation.
He had barely been parked an hour before there had been a light but insistent tapping on his window by the town Sheriff, followed by an amiable interrogation as to why he was just sitting there in his car. Fortunately he’d anticipated such an event. He’d stiffly announced his prepared story that he was a writer and required some background characters for fleshing out his latest novel, so he simply planned to take notes regarding the various town visitors that day.
bigots should you attempt to justify your position with the bogus argument that these virtual intelligences are ‘inferior’ simply because they are different.  Penelope justified your suspension of her by saying you’re a ‘stickler for the rules’. I therefore expect you to be as diligent about enforcing the
Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to enter a casual, temporary relationship with Cas. A few weeks of no-strings fun. Perhaps that, more than abstinence, would be the best cure for his lingering issues over his relationship with Michael. A chance, finally, to see whether it was possible to have a real, open honest connection with someone.
Dean swallowed heavily, and gaped at the indigo goddess. “My life hung on whether I gave you that tin of mackerel?”
A spell that not only created an air pocket, he realized, as he thought about the way it had magically always warmed and dried his hands whenever they entered the bubble to turn a page. Air. Heat. Dehumidification. Which, even as he thought about it, suddenly struck him as exactly the right kind of spell to revive a drowned human.
And, as he had expected, as soon as he entered the tidal stream that flowed to the right the message from his Destiny Stone changed once more.
“Nope, and clearly neither does Dean. The fact Castiel shrugged off any suggestion he’d ‘helped’ probably just added to the attraction. Nothing more appealing than a modest hero, is there?”
“Amara is capable of curing Dean,” Jimmy pointed out carefully. “She is vastly more powerful than a standard V.I.  I am not referring to her ‘power level’ but to the complexity of her coding. Repairing even as dramatic an injury as I understand Dean’s to be would be possible for any of the major A.I.s. Although I genuinely believe Chuck’s original intention was to kill Dean, it is rather peculiarly convenient that the manner of his injury made him ideally suited for Chuck’s purposes but not for Cain’s. Chuck knew that even if Cain became aware of his presence in Moondoor at this time, he would be reluctant to use Dean as a host because Cain might be capable of animating Dean’s body and
But then Amara had grown bored enough with waiting that she’d started ‘nibbling’ at Chuck’s code and Chuck had retaliated by killing Amara’s choice of vessel and the whole situation had begun to spiral out of control again.
“Because you’re a good guy,” she said, with a careless shrug. “It’s how you roll. And, yeah, sure, it
But she and Dor had reluctantly agreed with Carolus N’Vak - a Qui she had never even met until two hours earlier and yet he still
Dean strode until he found an unoccupied suite and slammed the door behind him before dumping Sam unceremoniously on a silk-sheeted bed.
“That sounds good, doesn’t it?” Dean griped. “You try it for a day, sweetheart. Every fucker around here expects me to play some kind of simpering princess. I’m apparently supposed to act like either a spoilt bitch or some swooning heroine in a bad romance novel. Maybe both. I walked into packlands with a gun so they automatically decided I was Sam.  I kept the two of us alive for twelve years, so everyone assumed Sam must have done it. Because only Alpha cocks count with the Wolfkin. Well, fuck that shit.”
Nigel looked at him uncomfortably, as he recalled the detailed file he’d read on Sam Winchester before their meeting. He had noticed the ‘parents deceased’ notation but hadn’t paid more than cursory attention to it. Now, looking at the man, well, over-grown
The merpeople of Atlan did not consider the whales to be allies. Their relations were cordial but cool with most other species. They did, however, have a non-violence pact in place with those whales who frequented Atlan waters. When the whales passed through Atlan territory during their seasonal migrations, they left the Mer alone and were, in turn, allowed unmolested passage.

His intuitive understanding of the digital universe made Charlie’s own abilities pale to insignificance.
“Animating a corpse proved exhausting. Cain doesn’t need sleep, as you understand it, but Richard’s body
“Yes and no.  I have a ‘Loki’ like Dean but mine is totally different. It’s been a bit disappointing to tell you the truth. I expected to have a mini-Gabriel snarking away in my head as Dean does. Instead, I just have this really impersonal S.I. who does his job but otherwise ignores me.  I think it was a deliberate choice by Gabriel though. I think he feels bad about the other Loki. About how he let him develop into a real individual with his own personality, despite knowing that personality will be destroyed when they recombine. At least, that’s my take on why he didn’t give a personality to the aspect he placed inside
they are working for the Feds. It’s so damned obvious. Are we really supposed to believe that not a single one of their ships has ever run into the path of Federation Peacekeepers, let alone how come every single victim of the Astrantians just so happens to be someone the Alliance has a beef with?”
Dean nodded again, unsurprised.  “So, basically, I could do it. Save all of you, save all the other players, get Amara out of here and everything would be good. The only consequences would be the ability of some Senatorial committee or such like to declare me ‘unfit to be a company director’ or something similar?”
It was a degree warmer and drier inside the barn but entering was still a sadness rather than a relief.  Twelve years of damp and neglect had cast a miasma of rot and rust over more than a dozen cars and vans, some of which were as old and precious as the Impala.  Such a waste that the Krushnics hadn’t thought to remove them at the time, rather than leave them abandoned to simply rust into obscurity.
She visibly preened, her cheeks flushing hotly at being momentarily the center of his attention. She had barely left their table since they arrived, only absenting herself to fetch their orders and blatantly ignoring the other patrons.
“The shots are just colored water from a fancy bottle,” Crowley admitted, with a careless shrug. “The bartender will always serve you one of the staff vintages, not the real stuff.”
Dean shook his head. “I can smell it, Cas.”  He paused and sniffed the air deeply, not caring the gesture looked peculiar. “A wrongness. Fear. Avarice. Lust.  Some creeper, Cas.”
Jimmy paused and tried to follow that thought through to its source, examining his thoughts and feelings for veracity.  According to Charlie, during that ‘lost’ time in the penultimate dungeon, his avatar had been somehow possessed by a self-determining V.I. that had so completely sublimated him that he had just been effectively thrown into some penalty box and ‘switched-off’ for the duration.  Jimmy wasn’t sure whether that was better or worse than if he’d been conscious at the time and simply forced to watch his ‘own’ actions like a passenger but, either way, nothing about the situation was good.
But perhaps Mortimer was right all along that Chuck, for all of his years living amongst humans, had never even tried to learn to understand them.
And the blood, that had been slowing to a trickle, spurted out of the newly formed wound. So violently that Dean roared in panic and raced forwards to snatch Sam from his grasp.  Castiel’s right hand shot out, grasping Dean’s shoulder, pinning him in place with a strength even greater than his available 172 power levels should have provided. “Trust me,” he insisted again, but didn’t wait for a response.  There wasn’t
His nose twitched, his eyes widened until they were impossibly large and his whiskers bristled with alarm.
“It is even prettier than the realtors’s brochure suggested,” Cas said, with a sigh of relief as he looked at the left-hand property.
“Well, that just made this shitty day one hell of a lot better,” Abaddon announced. “I was hoping it would at least give him a heart attack considering his genetic predisposition but, honestly, even that was just kind of vague wishful thinking on my part.”
Heart thudding in his chest, even as he double-checked in the mirror that he had definitely not hit his beloved Impala, he cast a fresh baleful look in the direction of Cas’s house.
“How did you tell?” Dean demanded, even as he understood why his companions had been relaxed about the idea of a soothsayer. Of all of them, he was the only one who had been likely to be ‘read’
would have preferred to have had the entire conversation after receiving the results of the blood test. When he would be in full possession of the facts. As it was, he had no choice except to voice his own doubts.
”So, let me get this straight. The kid broke you out of that house, saved your life and, while doing so, ‘accidentally’ stamped a mark of ownership on your ass?”
so.  And maybe it’s moot now. I dunno, Cas. I’m fully grown. Maybe not fully mature yet, but an adult at least and
He said the words in a tone of careful respect, his posture and scent acknowledging that should the Alpha of All make the choice to simply rip the irreverent human’s throat out that
“In the meantime though, what do Sam and I do?” Charlie asked. “RRE are going to be after us. And if they get hold of Sam and force him into the game, then he’ll land in his avatar, Cain will be able to take him over and then we’re all fucked. Because, let’s face it, you’re never going to fight

Then it appeared that Finch had left Dexter, rather than the other way around. Whilst both situations were nominally the same, the fact the decision had been taken by Finch, rather than by Dean, raised an even more difficult problem. Castiel cleared his throat, then said, “But should he choose to return, would you welcome him?”
“Well, since we both know this clinical trial is a bunch of baloney, I think it’s safe to say the answer is no.”
Huckleberry hopped over to join Nyx, his blue eyes so bright they seemed to glow with an inner light as he added his silent entreaty that Dean should obey the Cat’s demand to open the door and follow wherever she led.
Tsaluna was even less likely to welcome immigrants than most other planets. It didn’t only have one native sentient species evolved well past that of Humanity. It had two.  One of which was regarded as an Old Race and neither of which reputedly had more than the vaguest condescending tolerance for any less-evolved species.  Arthos, the Infinite City, was one of the listed Nine Wonders of the Helix Nebula. Tourists of all races visited to coo and awe over its beauty. The Tsalunniqui tolerated those tourists with aloof politeness, seemingly happy to put sufficient effort into the relationship to successfully strip their visitors of Federal Credits without ever crossing the line into offering any suggestion of genuine welcome.
So, although he knew it to be illogical, Castiel felt there was a bond between himself and the pup. A kinship. A fledgling covenant. An obligation to at least try to save her from a watery death.
“They do say it’s a profound bond,” Castiel agreed hopefully. “Two halves joining together to complete a whole.”
“Several thousand years ago, this was an island protruding out of the sea and Hu dwelt here. But a sea mountain erupted and a huge wave rose on the surface and drowned this place and sucked it down to the bottom once more. So the Triani Mer have dwelt here ever since.”
“But you implied something specific recently changed your mind about Grey-A being a correct identifier for yourself,” Dean prompted carefully.
“Veracity, maybe,” Gabriel suggested. “They could hardly pretend to be the same age, with Sam being physically so much more mature. It’s not like they could pass themselves off as twins. So it made far more sense to make Gan the younger brother on paper. Especially if Gan was only the height and size of a human fourteen year old.”
“But I got bonus points for having gay Sims,” she smirked. “Anyway, the key point is that the Sims wasn’t specifically designed to have ghost characters but it still adapted. Presumably, because someone thought to program in a ‘just in case’ response for that particular scenario.”
bitch.  Neither, for that matter, was I ever Deanna’s really. She didn’t mark me to put me in thrall. She did it simply to save my life. She knew if any of the Faelchu discovered I had witnessed Henry’s shift and had learned of the existence of the Wolfkin, my life would have been forfeit without a Galla mark.”
Sam shook his head in vehement denial. “I’ve seen him on T.V.,” he said. “The guy prowls like an apex predator and gives inspirational speeches at fancy conferences. He is
“What the hell do you Mariposa get taught in your Academies? No, don’t answer that. I can guess,” Crowley sneered. “Can you at least wait tables or are you completely useless unless horizontal?”
It took a moment to catch, a brief pause as the flame hit the dark flesh of the Hound and then seemed to just hang there for a moment like a halo over its head, before, with a loud WHOOOMMPPHH, the flame erupted and raced from beast to beast, growing into a near inferno as several gallons of 100 proof bourbon ignited simultaneously to a chorus of agonized howls.
Dean flushed hotly. “It’s a video game. How the hell could I get bodily injured or killed playing a video game? It’s obviously just a standard legal contract clause.  You get the same kind of crap written on the back of parking permits.”
Castiel shook his head mullishly. “Although he has not said a word to me to claim any credit and I have tried not to eavesdrop, I have listened to his side of enough telephone conversations to be fully aware of how industrious he has been in enabling this Festival. I am, frankly, disappointed that none of the Festival literature acknowledges his hard work.”
Castiel frowned. Had he misinterpreted the situation entirely? Had Dexter already made the decision to leave Finch. “Is it? Under the bridge?” He queried carefully.
A man named Einstein hypothesized that time does not progress at the same rate for everyone, everywhere. Since the speed of light is absolute, and speed is a measure of distance divided by time, for speed to remain constant, both time and distance are necessarily variable. More simply, the faster an object travels, the more slowly time passes for that object. If it moved at the speed of light, the object would appear frozen in time to an observer, whilst everything else would be in fast forward.
“But a POWER company is a beast of a different color, isn’t it? Owning 25% of an independent utility supplier is a whole different ballgame.”
He was eighteen years old. He had his freedom. He had a job. He had friends. He had Sam and Frank. He even had an almost-girlfriend.
“That’s fine then,” Gabriel said brightly.  “Get some sleep, little bro. Let’s hope tomorrow is a better day for all of us.”

More than that though, for Castiel - in his position as Alpha-of-All - the masking of his scent in such a way was a deliberate disarming of himself, like tying a hand behind his back in his interactions with
Dean, meanwhile, dove forwards towards Cain, who had only just regained his feet and begun staggering back through the doorway.
“So,” he finished. “You can see why it’s absolutely critical that you never get inside that immersion tank again.”
“Noooooooooooooo,” Dean yelled, as he saw the blade flash, as he saw Cain drag the serrated edge of his dagger across Abaddon’s throat.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Glad you think it’s going to be so easy for me.  Personally, I see that as far too close to call.”
He listened to them carefully, only interrupting briefly once or twice for clarification of various facts, and then, when they finished, he said. “Nope, I got nothing.”
In Greek mythology, Alectryon was a young soldier who was assigned by Ares to stand guard outside his door while the god indulged in illicit love with Aphrodite. He fell asleep on guard duty and the sun-god, Helios, discovered them the following morning. Helios then alerted Hephaestus, husband to Aphrodite, to the actions of the two, causing Hephaestus to create a net to ensnare and shame them. Furious, Ares punished Alectryon by turning him into a rooster which never forgets to announce the arrival of the sun in the morning by its crowing. He became the god of chickens and roosters therefore looking after all chickens and roosters for all eternity.
“Don’t be rude, darlings,” Crowley said.  “Whispering in corners is what I expect from a Twink, but I would have assumed better manners from you, Red.”
“But, as we have established, I don’t know one end of a sword from another. How am I supposed to even reach the position to fight Amara herself when, to do so, I need to fight all the other Knights who, presumably,
“You’re being foolishly sentimental,” Gabriel insisted. “A promise given to an enemy under duress is
, Gabe.  Out of every fucking Angel in Moondoor, why does Jimmy have to saved by the one Angel who has the most to lose?”
It was that which was unsettling, he decided. The fact that the Tsalun looked like deformed humans that made his eyes want to slide off their features in discomfort.
“I imagine the presence of a guy old enough to be his father in his house is far less stressful than a visit from a young, attractive guy like you,” Sam offered.
So if there was any way for Charlie to prevent Castiel from shooting himself in the foot, she was going to take it.
“You did listen to the doctor, right?” Charlie demanded. “It’s still going to take months of exercise and physio before you are back to normal. The Reaper rebuilt your spinal cord. He didn’t hang around long enough to repair ten years of  muscle wastage. That part is going to be on you and it’s going to take time, determination and a lot of hard work.”
Dean wasn’t sure exactly what it would feel like when he passed through the portal, but he suspected the worst. He imagined he’d feel the gut wrenching experience of being sucked through a wormhole at the very least. He braced himself to feel physical pain of one degree or another so, in a way, the reality was greatly anti-climactic.
She had been smart enough to leave the village she had killed him in but, trapped within the guise of a little girl, she hadn’t traveled far. On Tuesday, Magnus had located her in an NPC town called New Harmony, ten miles to the west of their original point of arrival. It had only taken a few hours to track her location down, because he had told every NPC he met that he was looking for his missing beloved ‘daughter’ and they had all helpfully recounted their sightings of the pretty little blonde ‘cherub’.
If the email had arrived directly into his own inbox he would have deleted it, emptied his trash and then blocked the sender so he could pretend it had never even happened.
Sam considered himself to have a healthy dose of cynicism but even he drew the line at outright paranoia and the series of events that had caused his flight delay were so varied and multitudinous that they surely could only be a series of bizarre coincidences.
“In and out like a yo-yo on crack,” she agreed resentfully.  “Sometimes I think I’d rather stay there. It’s a shitty place but at least the Purgatory monsters are interesting. But, no, some asshole like you always casts a spell and yanks me back out to babysit whatever demonic host they’ve summoned and then I’m stuck hanging around like a bad smell until they either run out of Soul Points or someone takes me out.”
“First purchase in each store is always free to newbies. It’s a thing round here. Jody thinks it makes the town more friendly,” Dexter shrugged. “Bet you wished you’d chosen better than a single dollar-bargain-bin book now, huh?”
The entire store looked like a bizarre combination of a Hoarder’s Den and Aladdin’s Cave. Although the items were all stacked relatively neatly and all clearly labelled, the disorganization made Castiel’s head throb at the assault on his near OCD-level need for precise order yet the writer in him marvelled at the visible truth that the store was crammed full of absolutely everything a customer might possibly consider ‘useful’ at some point or other.
“Ah ha, I knew it. You said here. What a totally wonderful and fortuitous coincidence,” Crowley smirked. “So you have absolutely no excuse to refuse Random’s preference that you attend the Heron’s Cove event too. As you say, you aren’t contractually obliged, but slighting your neighbors would be rather unforgivable.”
That was when she had made the connection that the shadowy figures Alastair had always been conferring with shortly before the disappearances had also caused her senses to vibrate, although on a totally different frequency.
But when Dean, with a tired sigh, had risen to open it for him, the rabbit hadn’t moved. It had just continued to glare at him with its weird demanding eyes and furry little bitch-face until, with a groan, Dean had given in, gone outside and retrieved several carrots for it from the moonlit garden.
At Carolus‘s behest, the entire facility had been converted to the frantic investigation, and manufacture, of fake Subplex pheromones.
“I did try. But I can’t break the necklace. I can’t cut it. It’s impossible to remove. And if I try to swim away from the direction it insists that I go, it gets louder and louder in my head until I can’t even think for the noise. It drowns out everything else and, without sonar, I can’t find my way home anyway. That’s why I came to you, because I don’t believe in magic. There has to be a logical, scientific explanation as to why it won’t come off. Once I understand that, I will be able to remove it and go home.”
I enter into carefully negotiated contracts with no hidden clauses or traps. I set forward my terms clearly, precisely and without deceit.  And if my terms are unacceptable, the party who rejects my offer is free to simply walk away without consequence. As James Novak has done. Sadly. I would have enjoyed the opportunity to see the world through
They stayed three more nights at the cabin, enjoying the privacy to strengthen their bond and grow closer together. To reach a point where their scents were so entwined that speech became largely unnecessary between them even in human form. Entire conversations took place simply with the sweetening or souring of their scent piles.
More significantly, he was one of the rare breed of intellectual geniuses who understood his intelligence didn’t include any business acumen whatsoever, so he would need to form a company to not only develop his idea but to find the funding and expertise to enable it to become a reality.
“Then, yeah, that’s him,” Dean agreed.  “Can you… um… use your superpowers to get a message through to him? Tell him thanks. Tell him I’m trying not to let him down. That I’m doing my best to make his decision worthwhile? I’d do it myself, but I kinda got the impression he doesn’t have time to wait for me to manage to get out of this game again.”
Then, knowing his bodyguards had been defanged, the Alpha ignored their alarm  - they were now incapable of defying him even as they visibly shuddered in place with their distress at the order to ‘halt’ - as Castiel stepped ahead of them towards the doorway, placing himself directly in the path of the shotgun and, ignoring its threat completely, moved closer to the angry stranger.
So, as his heart beat slowed, as his lungs stopped burning, Castiel simply rolled his eyes at his older brother’s antics. “It is too late to change my mind, as you well know. I have already bought the house and I fully intend to live in it.”
relationship between them impossible.  Dean sure as hell wouldn't want to enter a relationship with Castiel if it turned out the Alpha could thrall
It was a clever idea, Castiel decided. If the shark took the bait, the adult dolphin would be able to drop the illusion of injury and flee, hopefully drawing the shark far enough away to give the rest of the pod time to herd the pup to safer waters.
Dean’s jaw dropped and he just blinked stupidly for a moment. “Yeah, but how… um… you already know?”
“Sammy,” she said, her eyes momentarily brightening and an expression of recognition crossed her features. “Raphael told me about you, Sammy.”
“You don’t have a sister, Anna.  Whoever that woman is, Ruby or Raphael or whatever the hell she calls herself, she’s not your sister.”
,” Dean said with a shrug. “Whatever else happens, regardless of what Jimmy and Cas have to say because they’ve both probably come to their senses anyway, there’s no way I’m moving back into my apartment. Now Ash has put Lil’ Beanz up for sale, there’s no reason for me to stay in Lawrence at all. That part of my life is over and done.”
By 1979, Fergus was successfully peddling drugs on behalf of several of the largest gangs, slipping and sliding through them all like a greased pig, avoiding any specific loyalty or affiliation, keeping his involvement with each of them small enough that he stayed under the radar, yet building a huge portfolio of clients who knew he was the ‘go-to’ guy for their fix.
”Because Belize International is the only airport in this whole country that offers international flights.  No matter which plane we catch, it would be easy for RRE to mark an alert with the Airport's booking computers. If they know which flight we are on, they will know where we are going to land and it would be easy for them to lay a trap for us.  So we leg it to Guatemala City instead and catch the first available short flight anywhere, Dallas if possible, whilst RRE are still expecting me to use the return flight I already have pre-booked for late this afternoon.  By the time they figure out I’m not checking in to it, we’ll already be back in the States.”
Ruby’s visit had pulled his suspicions into sharp-focus.   He was positive that whatever was happening now, the seeds that were now coming into harvest had been sown fifteen years earlier and Anna Milton, crazy or not, held the key to unlocking that mystery.
And with those words, damn if that weird optical illusion didn’t cause Cas to look like he’d just caught fire from the inside out.
Dean waved a hand nonchalantly. “The day you start twisting yourself in knots trying to avoid saying anything that might cause potential offence to me is gonna be the day I
“And Sammy was so scared. See, he was only five and he didn’t remember what Dad was like before the drinking got so bad. All he saw was this scary-ass ‘monster’ who was going to take him away from our Mom.  So, well, I knew what to do.  I told Dad I
“Jeez, put your tongue away. I mean Sam has no idea of how to use those muscles, so his vessel won’t have any muscle-memory to assist Cain in this. The
Eileen had obviously used her own two words more appropriately than insulting the guy’s business by suggesting it was the inspiration for a Stephen King horror story.
Surprisingly, it was Sam who replied. “Dean won’t get a chance to talk himself into believing someone like C. J. Novak wouldn’t be interested in him anyway, so he won’t come up with a thousand ways to sabotage himself before the conversation,” he said, then shrugged. “Look, I know my brother. I fully understand why you all think he needs a bit of relationship assistance. It’s too late to cancel the Festival and, anyway, it really is a brilliant idea for helping Jeff and the rest of the town. If it goes well, maybe it could become an annual event.
The white wolf leaped past the black, crashing through the front door with sufficient power to splinter it off its hinges in an explosion of painted wood.
Dean thought about that.  “Tell the truth, as much as the idea makes my stomach curdle, if there was a way to go and confront Cain right this moment, I’d take the chance and do it because I couldn’t stand the guilt of knowing every single person who dies in-game from this point would be on my head. But,” he continued, “we have no idea whatsoever where he is, do we? And if he manages to get to even one other Knight first he’ll immediately jump another 100 levels to 350.”
Instead of answering him, Bobby pressed a button on his Vidcom and yelled, “Kevin, Garth, get your skinny asses in here.” Then he turned his attention to Dean again. “I was born at night, not last night,” he rumbled. “You ain’t the first person to look at that data and draw the same conclusion. Problem is political, kinda. The Faelar, bless their sweet little socks, are idealistic little buggers and a bit set in their ways. When Kevin put forward the same idea a couple of years back, the Faelar took it as an assault on their own religious beliefs. So the human settlers backed down a bit, decided to work around the problem with the deep sideways shafts instead of forcing a confrontation. We figured the Faelar would eventually come around. Well, if we could figure out a way to prove our theory to them. They ain’t stupid folks.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “You know I don’t give a shit about public opinion. But it’s foolish to pretend it doesn’t exist and have significant power. I know Abaddon thinks by bringing someone of your bloodline into her family, she will gain some of your respectability. But I fear she’s wrong. I think you and your family will simply be tainted by the association.”
But then you have the totally improbable and yet provable existence of the Winchesters to consider, don’t ya? There definitely ain’t nothin’ theoretical about
you Dagon? He’s not afraid of you, asshole. Feel free to go to Hades City and try your luck. He’s got a welcome mat out with your name on.”
Which effectively ended their conversation for several hours before, possibly regretting her earlier snark or, more likely, just out of boredom, she sighed deeply and then asked him what he was doing in the ‘river’.
“I had actually forgotten how beautiful Arthos is,” Dey’n said, as they walked together through the nearly deserted streets. Morning had only just begun to break, the rising sun weak in the sky but already casting the white marbled buildings in hues of pale apricot. “I remember how my first sight of the City blew me away. I thought it was the most gorgeous place I’d ever seen. Weird to think I’d forgotten that entirely after just a couple of weeks of mundanity. How quickly wonders become commonplace, huh?”
And fortunately Dean understood what he meant, because his eyes sparked gold with acceptance rather than rage. He didn’t misunderstand the statement as a denial. He accepted it as a benediction.
“Then the situation is not the same,” Jimmy replied firmly. “I asked for time about an issue that may directly impact upon happenings within this game. May directly impact on
Castiel threw his head back and laughed. “That’s definitely a fantasy, Gabe. I’ll allow that I was born with certain physical advantages but look at me. I’m thirty-two years old, still single, and I can’t even remember the last time I took someone to my bed.”
Mal’akh. Messengers of God.” And in Psalm 107:20 it was said, “He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.”
And though it was too far away for him to discern the exact breed of the predator that had caused such a frantic reaction by the older dolphins, it was obvious from its size, shape and swim pattern, that the dark shape circling beneath the pod was a shark.
Gabriel pouted. “Let me at least hold onto the fantasy. I have this dream of waking up one day with black wings, twelve more inches of height and the ability to just flash my baby blues at someone to make them throw themselves at my feet.”
“This body is far too strong now to throw away. Shame really, but there it goes. Looks like you lose after all, Dean Winchester.  Kill you now, I get the First Blade and then I just need to port around and mop up the rest of the losers. I know the locations of them all.  Hell, at this rate, we can all be home for tea. Oh, well, not
Maybe it hadn’t been his fault, Dean thought with considerable relief. Perhaps it had been the crowd causing Cas’s panic, he decided. That would make sense. The guy was a bit of a hermit, after all. A busy farmer’s market was probably the worst kind of environment for someone who was by nature a loner.
“I merely pointed out the fallacy of your assumptions by presenting a perfectly valid alternative scenario,” the Archivist replied, then smiled serenely.
Gabriel reached over his brother’s sprawled body, deleted Castiel’s email unsent and turned his computer off.
Crowley looked at Dean speculatively. “I think you’re right, Alastair. He’d need exactly the right outfit, but it could work. Mmmm. In fact, the more standoffish you are, Dey’hahn, the more it will create unsatisfied desire. The more they’ll really buy the idea you’re forbidden fruit. Still, we need to gild the lily a little. Make sure they’re really interested. No point you acting the stuck-up bitch if they don’t want the goods anyway. How about make-up?” Crowley suggested. “A temporary brand. Just to confirm your bonafides.”
“I find it… somewhat embarrassing to admit,” Jimmy said. “I have not… I… well, I was raised in a strictly Catholic household.”
Until, eventually, he decided that wisdom and treachery were going to be his best way to overcome youth and skill.
The thing was, Dean had felt how much the Dom had wanted him. The bastard’s pheromones had hit him like a battering ram, hungry, rapacious, greedy, slavering all over him like a sensation of some virulent disease sliding over and into his skin.
Her S.I., Hester, was being annoyingly coy about their purpose. All the S.I. would say was that the SP would turn out to be helpful later.
”Running out of money is a bullshit reason, considering you know the Volkrod would happily cover the cost for you. Running out on the
he clarified bitterly.  “Ask me the same question today and my answer is, well, kinda the opposite.  It’s Cas that I can’t get out of my head now. Not just the weird dorky stuff he does and says, because honestly that’s just like seeing an echo of Jimmy anyway, but his sheer badassery.
“Habit, I guess,” Dean admitted. “On Earth it’s impossible for an emancipated Mariposa to get a job because no one accepts or respects the fact of their emancipation.  The idea a Mariposa might even want to be treated like a normal person is considered a big, impossible joke.”
“Yup,” Dean agreed, with a proud smile. “Sam knocked that little fucker out with one hit. Then he carefully picked up the spider, with its six remaining legs, and carried it outside to safety before returning to accept his punishment from the teacher.  That’s who Sam is.  Sure he and I argue. Hell, we sometimes go weeks or months so mad at each other that we don’t even talk. Sam isn’t a saint. Sam will pull a scam on you whilst smiling in your face and not lose a wink of sleep over it and I’d be the first to say he can be a self-opinionated, self-righteous, judgemental little shit at times. But Sam is, and always has been, the kid who’d rather face the music than let any living creature suffer unnecessarily. Sam is
Ash shrugged. “Hey man, just the word alone is pretty indicative that it’s a ‘bad thing’,” he said, and Dean could actually hear the parenthesis in his voice.
At least it now made sense why the owner had stipulated no-one could view the property before submitting a tender, although the subterfuge had achieved nothing, had it? The house was beyond restoration by a single person, no matter how otherwise unemployed and desperate they were. It was possibly beyond restoration at all. It made no sense why he had been tricked into coming to the island under such false pretenses but whatever game the owner was playing at, Dean was already folding his hand.
”Chafing risk,” Dean replied. “I realized it was going to be a long walk to the shops. Didn’t want you damaging anything
said, “Because in addition to the property damage, I am pretty sure my picture is about to hit either the National Enquirer or the FBI’s most-wanted.”
“I hope this is adequate,” he said, gesturing at the interior. “Obviously feel free to help yourself to anything in the kitchen, but I thought you’re probably exhausted and would prefer to sleep first. The door has a lock and bolts,” he added hastily. “You can be assured of your total safety. There is also a vid-com. Should you feel even slightly ill at ease at any point, feel welcome to summon the Tsalun City Guards to your assistance.”
Stupid, really. Dean had always had a vague, childish fantasy that there might be a type of Dominant who welcomed the idea of a Submissive who needed to be romanced rather than subdued, who wanted a Submissive who desired a partner strong enough to take what they wanted but gentle enough to ask for it instead.  Dean had never really believed such a mythical creature existed.
His fault then was in taking a further eight months to confess the misunderstanding. To admit he was gay.
Jimmy realized abruptly that this NPC wasn’t so much a copy as it was a caricature. A badly drawn version of how Chuck
“And although we were displaced by climatic disasters and the greed and warmongering of the Hu, so we chose to sever our relations with them and retreated to live in deeper waters, the works we created in those days still exist. Only, now, we call those workings magic. I think the Destiny Stones were created on purpose to ensure genetic diversification. It’s not good for the gene pool of individual populations to remain stagnant. Cross-breeding strengthens the royal bloodlines. It also encourages peace and tolerance. A kingdom is less likely to declare war on its neighbors if the King of one city is mated to a prince or princess of another. “
“But I’ve had it with that shit, Dean.  Look where we are. What we’re doing. The odds are stacked against us. The chances of any of us getting out of this alive at all are minimal at best. It’s like we’re at the end of the fucking world, in Apocalypse city, and even
"If all the existing tanks belong to RRE, they have to know where they are located and since RRE is based in California, I imagine the majority of the tanks are located within close proximity of their Head Office for ease of servicing. Since we're almost out of Nevada already, there
If he wasn’t planning on leaving Tsaluna completely in less than a month, he suspected he’d allow that intrigued to tip over into
either and Dean, well, he seems to be the kind of guy who stays loyal to those he loves regardless of whether or not they continue to deserve it. So the fact he trusts you isn’t enough to convince me you’re actually trustworthy, you know?”
He meant the comment literally. Although Sam was just a pup still, he was of an age where - as an Alpha - he was expected to not only start participating in pack business but to need no comfort against cold or nightmares. The use of his brother as bedwarmer and comforter was no longer considered appropriate.
It couldn’t be possible because at any given time of the day there were at least forty or fifty thousand people online playing Moondoor these days. It was one of the most popular, lucrative games in the world.
Not that Richard Roman was looking much better. Ever since Ramiel had joined with him, the avatar had remained oddly still and even now, as he became aware of Nick’s attention, Roman appeared to be struggling to move at all.
“I can’t believe you just said that,” Charlie sighed. “Never mind. Just accept it as a compliment and let’s move on. Time’s a wasting. We’re here to get a Quest off this Ellen and meet up with this ‘Jimmy’ friend of yours, right?”
Jimmy waited until Ash left, then confided, “Now I have found a way to utilize my new S.I. effectively, I’ve regained all of my original inventory items. I have access to my realm ports now so there’s no need for us to ride there at all. I have more than sufficient for both of us to use.”
“Exactly, though it ain’t just subs. Take your pretty friend Meg. I wish we could afford to bring a whole bunch of Delts here out of those goddamned hell camps.  Who knows?  One day maybe, if we can ever work out a way to extract enough ore, we’ll be able to afford to do it.”
Castiel missed him so much it was like a knife in his chest every single waking moment. Yet he never went after him, never approached him to apologize, never thought that he should be the one to mend their fractured friendship.
Roman smiled like a shark. “Oh no. Not at all. I brought the upgrade with me. We’ll just swap S.I.s in game. Much faster and efficient. Hop over here, Ramiel, like a good boy.”
Where such lines blurred on occasion, the cause stemmed always, without exception, to traits that had been deliberately programmed into them by humans.
A generation or two earlier, the ‘shame’ of being a single mother might have driven Sue-Beth to leave town herself. But there were more welfairies in town by then than there were respectably married mothers.  So Sue-Beth plodded on through life, bringing her daughter up as best she could, shoring up the welfare checks with waitressing jobs.
added to the attraction a few months later, after the interwebs flooded with people exclaiming how ‘cool’ the idea was, added considerable veracity to the theory put forward in the local paper.
“At work as the night watchman,” Joyce snapped. “Which didn’t seem to stop the fire, did it? Six other people died because of that fire, Mr Coleman. A lot of people might think that rather than receiving compensation, your father’s estate should have been sued for damages. He as good as killed those people with his neglect.”
“I solemnly promise this has nothing to do with food and no one ever blamed you for that fiasco anyway. We all learned the lesson that Ash’s credentials as a mushroom forager are highly suspect.”
He was everybody’s idea of a good time, but in the Snog/Marry/Avoid game he was firmly placed in the fuck and forget category. Maybe that was why Cas intrigued him so much. He was the only person who had immediately thrown him into ‘Avoid’ rather than ‘Snog’. That alone gave Cas novelty value.
“Don’t look so disapproving, Dey’hahn. I doubt any of my customers give a shit one way or the other what is going down your pretty little throat. They’re paying for your company, not your pleasure.”
“Of course not. They have not been programmed by Richard Roman. I am afraid his genius was unique and it died with him.  Cain retains Richard’s memories, to an extent, but not his
Dean shuddered at the thought.  All he knew of the Volkrod was they were evil, demonic wolves who feasted on the flesh of Creiche babies and even their own pups sometimes.  His own grandsire, Samuel, had taken a cruel delight one evening, after he had called by the boy’s room to bid goodnight to his beloved heir, in telling Dean he was ‘lucky’ to be a Galla rather than a ‘Pok’. Because if he’d been born so flawed inside a Volkrod Pack, he would have been roasted on a spit - alive - and then served up as an appetizer.
His emotions, therefore, although demonstrably genuine, were not akin to a human response to the same stimuli.
Instead, she had been too busy throwing that dirty little bastard, George, out into the back yard in anticipation of yet another pointless visit to the local E.R.
A couple of times, as they had spoken, he had received the clear impression that Dey’n might possibly be attracted to him. Unless that was just wishful thinking on his part. Either way, though, it was critical that any interaction between them was instigated only by the gorgeous Polilla and, definitely, only if it was done freely and without any sense of obligation.
KillerSaint was not only a respectable character level 36, which made him one of the highest level players in his guild (If only because said Guild, the Hunters, was one of the lesser ones, and so attracted very few of the highest level players into its ranks), he was also the proud holder of a rank 9 designation.
He glanced cautiously at Cas, then seeing no obvious derision at the idea, was emboldened to continue.
The books he and Sam read together were written for the vocabulary of young adults, which probably proved they were
Surprisingly, Charlie could smell Gan too.  Maybe it was an Omega thing, because she’d never picked up the scent of a Wolfkin before.  Gan smelled... divine. Though not
Confused, she did as he said, jumping to her feet and running into what she presumed was his bedroom and finding his computer. She brought it back to him and he took it without a word, simply opening it up, logging into his email and then swinging it around so she could see an email trail from the night before:
He'd been joking about the rocket launchers.  Frank clearly hadn't shared his sense of humor because Dean was now the proud owner of an XM25 semi-automatic grenade launcher. He wasn't sure it would prove more help than hindrance, given that it - combined with its 36 rounds of ammunition  - weighed a hefty 50lbs. But he was a wolfkin, not a human, so was strong enough that the weight alone wasn't sufficient reason to turn it down.
Castiel looked startled for a moment and then, for the first time in a couple of hours, the deep hopeless misery in his eyes faded as they brightened with genuine hope.
dead,” Gabriel pointed out. “I think that’s the more pressing immediate concern. Samuel’s heir survived. That could prove to be a serious problem for all of us.”
And that was how, a few weeks later, Dean and Sam left Frank in Idaho - because Devereaux claimed he was just getting too damned old for road trips - and set off to discover whether the Deanna Winchester listed as the first ever owner of their car was
“Resources. Food, Gold, Metal, shit like that. It’s game lingo. You’ll get used to it. Just pretend you’re on vacation and the natives
So, even though he arrived at LAX even as the overhead tannoy was announcing the last call for his flight, Sam paused at a public internet booth during his race to the check-in desk and took almost 30 seconds to send Dean a quick three-word email from his private yahoo account.
Cas winced slightly.  Perhaps the child was only Dobycha, but he would have been ‘human’ enough to care even if his own new status as a
She couldn’t deny she was intensely curious about meeting the man who was proving to be more Alpha than most actual Alphas.  And don’t even get her started on
Jimmy’s mouth twitched into a pleased, shy smile. “Thank you,” he said. “I did mean what I said earlier, though. I fully intend to return, regardless of what truth is revealed to me tomorrow. I also wish to believe I will be brave enough to share my personal secret with you regardless. The latter, however, I cannot promise.”
“You’re supposed to shake it,” Ellen announced, bustling up with two plates of breakfast and dumping them on the table unceremoniously. “You’re both totally useless at this, aren’t you? One angel pretending to be human and one human pretending to be a cat and neither of you knowing how the hell to behave,” she scolded.  “Try to get your acts together, huh? We’ve got a lot of ‘immigrants’ in here this morning. Don’t bring attention to yourselves.”
She was Wolfkin. It was impossible to meet the knowledge of a living American Omega with anything other than near-religious reverence and wonder.  Yet still there was fury. Dark and invidious poison that curled through her whole being.
. These guys were effectively just all victims of a disease, for all that they were now revealed to be werewolves, so the Quest was presumably to cure them of the disease rather than kill them.
to be in a position to fully understand the phenomenon he was attempting to destroy.  It was a necessary step in his process of thoroughly researching the issue, wasn’t it?
Jimmy looked uncertain whether to be impressed or horrified. “Mother? Is that you?” he queried hesitantly.
For Charlie C.H.I.C.K. was like… well, the only analogy she could think of was that working on OZ was like being given the keys to a shiny new Prius.  It was all sat navs and electric windows and fuel economy and shiny paintwork. Whereas working on C.H.U.C.K. was like being offered the keys to a classic muscle car with a V8 engine and more horsepower than the Kentucky Derby.  Sure the Classic was unreliable, temperamental, and needed to be coaxed and cosseted, treated with extreme respect at all times, but the pay-off was a performance that left the Prius in the dust.
Entering one of the elevators, Sam inserted the card into the slot beneath the dark control pad and five of the dozen buttons lit up, offering him only the options of LB, B, 3, 4 and 5.
Losing her Queen Charlie Avatar, her Oz Avatar and even her VR rig all in less than a week made her feel like one of her actual limbs had been amputated. That may have been dramatic but it was nonethless true. She felt sick and lost and literally as though an actual, physical part of whatever formed her identity had been stolen. That was how adrift she felt now that she was ‘trapped’ in the Real World.
”Computer girl?” Charlie repeated incredulously. “Anyway, how am I supposed to get inside the program? I’ve got an avatar, but no rig.”
Sure, on the surface it was a super shiny new virtual environment that would cause players to ahhh and ooh with excitement. It still beat the socks off anything any other gaming company could offer and, honestly, no one could exactly complain about flying monkeys...
“Complete nonsense. Johannes was a blunt man with an inflexible dogmatism. He won most of his arguments with his claws. He couldn’t have charmed his way out of a clamshell,” Rufus scoffed. “Good riddance to him, I say.”
It was both an assurance of their unarmed safety and a gentle reminder that the lives of the humans on the mountain were in their hands. The Wolfkin would never risk themselves being exposed.
”You’ll ‘stand’ for whatever the fuck my boy chooses to do,” Bobby spat.  “I’ll pass your kind ‘offer’ on to him, but don’t be surprised if he don’t take it.”
. She wasn’t precisely sure why Dey’hahn was apparently under some terrible threat on Tsaluna. As an emancipated Polilla, surely Dey’hahn should have been able to depend on Federal Law to protect him. Meg could only believe the threat related to Alastair, who hadn’t been seen since the evening Crowley had discovered his perfidy.
Dean surged to his feet and backed away from Castiel, from them all. “I can’t… can’t talk about this.  Any of this. Not now. I need… need to think.  Fuck it. None of this makes any fucking sense. I need to talk to Crowley. I need to know why the hell
“Feel free to tell me to mind my own business,” Eileen said. “But is this person you like someone from your past or is it a local?”
Still, easier to understand a man if you understand the weaknesses and motivations that drive him, so a little potted history of Fergus ‘Crowley’ MacLeod is warranted at this point before the Four players and their vampire companion meet the

But nature had rapaciously reclaimed the land for itself. What had once been flat lawn to better expose any advancing hostile forces had grown into thick scrub of wild grasses and sprawling thickets of gorse and shrub.
