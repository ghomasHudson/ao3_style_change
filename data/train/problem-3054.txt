“All of them?” She asked curiously. Sam nodded his head in response. Gabriella looked down at her clothes and they immediately changed into clothes fit for battle.
“But-“
“My name is Gabriella. Gabriel is-was my twin brother.” She said as if that would explain everything.
“I felt you die. How could-how could you do that to me?” She sobbed loudly.
“She’s telling the truth. I found out about this before I-died.” He admitted. Gabriella slowly nodded her head before turning back towards Amara who was studying her closely.
“Gabriel.” Jack said suddenly. The women nodded as she turned her undivided attention back to Jack. The brothers really took her in this time and it was hard to miss the obvious similarities between the two. She had his unearthly golden brown eyes, long brown hair except hers went to the middle of her back. They looked basically identical.
“I would never, ever leave you by choice.” Amara said determination leaking through her every word. Gabriella turned her attention towards Gabriel who nodded his head.
“It means I am not in your head. I think-from the pain I was sensing from Castiel earlier- that if I was to delve into your head I would not like what I found and would not be held responsible for the repercussions that follow.” Dean’s jaw ticked in anger but he sat back down.
~~~~~
“That doesn’t explain why you’re here.” Dean responded testily. The women finally let her eyes raise from Jacks and turned her attention to Dean.
“He does not like me.” She noted curiously.
“When Lucifer and Michael first started fighting you promised, you promised that no matter what happened you wouldn’t leave me. You said that no matter how bad it got we wouldn’t ever get like that when I needed you you’d be there, and if it got too bad between Luce and Mikey you would leave but you wouldn’t go without me.” She said avoiding his eyes.
“You- you can go in my head.” He whispered looking down at the table. Gabriella stared at the top of his head for a minute before delving into Dean's head and watching his every interaction with Cas. She opened her eyes, not even realizing she closed them to see Dean staring at her sadly.
“Are you going to leave?” Jack asked staring at her worriedly.
“My brother tends to overdramatize.” Gabriella warned.
“I do not see a problem with you staying.” He said offering her a smile. She returned it and playfully rolled her eyes.
“These angels have sworn their allegiance to you nephew, do well with them.” She said looking at Jack. Jack smiled and nodded his head before disappearing himself and taking the angels with him. The Winchester’s, Castiel, Gabriel, and Gabriella were the only ones still remaining. Gabriella looked between her brother and the taller Winchester curiously as they continued to take each other in but didn’t comment. Castiel and Dean were still wrapped in each other and Gabriella turned towards the library before walking into it.
“Who are you?” Jack asked softly.
“Don’t, I am not mad at you.” Amara said sternly. Gabriella suddenly looked less like an angelic being who could probably kill them all without even moving and more like a little kid who just wanted her mother. She ran into Amara’s waiting arms and sniffled lightly, choking back tears.
“Dean Winchester.” She said bowing her head slightly. Dean frowned in confusion and turned to face Sam mouthing a “what the fuck” before turning his attention back to the young women. Her eyes were now trained on Jack who was studying her just as intently as she was him. He suddenly appeared right in front of her and Deans eyes widened in panic.
“Gabriel.” Sam whispered breathlessly.
“His room has been transformed to fit his needs. He will not remember any of the burdens he carried when he wakes up. He’ll think he’s a normal human kid, but when he gets old enough and you want him to remember pray to me and I’ll give him back his memories.” Gabriella said never lifting her eyes from Jack.
Dean and Sam shared a look of confusion as a timid knock on the bunker door filled the quiet room. They both immediately grabbed their guns before creeping up the stairs. After sharing a nod, Dean yanked the front door open.
“I didn’t- I asked and he said you left.” Gabriella whispered guiltily.
“And then I woke up and you were gone. You didn’t even leave me a note.” She said feeling her eyes water. She shook her head when Gabriel made a move to speak her eyes filling with fire. Castiel discreetly pulled Dean and Sam closer to the exit, and slowly shook his head when they looked at him in confusion. His wings unfurled and blocked both of them keeping them from any unintentional harm. Gabriel made a move to say something only for Gabriella to slam her fist into his face. The sound of thunder crackling outside made the Winchester boys share a wide-eyed look. Gabriel’s head snapped to the side on impact and he stared at her wide-eyed.
“Where am I?” She hissed continuing to frantically look around.
“How are we supposed to take care of a baby?” Dean chocked out. Gabriella slowly looked up at the occupants of the table and smiled gently.
“You can have anything you want, Cas.” Dean said letting his eyes slowly drag back up to Castiel’s beautiful baby blues. Gabriella covered Jack's eyes just as their lips met in a kiss and smirked proudly.
“I will not allow your food to burn, Dean Winchester.” Gabriella said, with amusement coating her every word. Dean scowled but sat down across from her. She stared at him for a minute her piercing gaze unrelenting even as Dean began to shift uncomfortably.
“We were inseparable.” Gabriella verified with a nod.
It’s officially been a full week that Gabriella had gone to the empty and no amount of prayers had been able to give any of them a clue of whether or not she was even alive.
Dean spun around quickly staring wide-eyed at Castiel who was watching him cautiously.
“Without you my brother wouldn’t have-“ She cut herself off and shook her head.
“Of course, I’m sorry. In the beginning God started with creating the angels- the arch-angels to be exact. There are 7-excluding me- the four that you know are my brothers Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, and Gabriel. When God got to making Gabriel, his sister Amara-“ she cut herself off making sure that they knew God had a sister, when she received an eager head nod from Sam she continued.
“I don’t deserve him.” Dean ground out. Gabriella furrowed her eyebrows together in confusion as she stared at him.
“Jack.” Gabriella said staring at him meaningfully. Jack stared back for a minute before nodding his head sadly.
“What are you doing here? I- I thought you weren’t coming back?” Sam said chuckling happily and pulling the Nephilim turned God into his arms for a hug. They let go of each other and Jack seemed to consider his words carefully before answering.
“Rebellion? Castiel, why do you think you were able to leave heaven alive? And who is it that you think allowed you to be sent back to Dean when they forcefully dragged you back to heaven the first time? Why do you think Father brought you back to life when Lucifer blew you up for calling Michael an ‘assbutt’?” Gabriella asked furrowing her eyebrows together in genuine confusion.
“In the empty there is what?” She asked holding her hand out and making a sword appear in it. It looked a lot like an Angel blade yet more deadly and longer.
“Oh please.” Gabriel said rolling his eyes.
“You do not owe me anything, Dean.” Castiel said earning a snort from Gabriella.
Dean continued to stare at the rip forcing himself not to walk through as Angel after Demon walked through yet there still wasn’t a Cas. As more Demons continued to come out and the space started to decrease Rowena and Jack started to lead people towards the library. Eventually, people stopped coming out and Dean felt his stomach dip in disappointment. He turned to leave when a voice made him stop.
“We have no idea who she is, Sam!”
“Oh yeah, back when we were in heaven there was a bet going around that Castiel and my sister would end up together.” Gabriel said sending them both a wink. Dean couldn’t fight the sudden wave of jealousy that hit and overwhelmed him full force.
“Who I am is not of import.”
“She did it.” Sam said with a small smile. The map room quickly filled up with people until it was beginning to get stuffy.
“I’m so so-“
“You just left.” She spat cutting off his apology. The lights flickered, reminding Dean distinctively of when he’d first met Cas. Gabriella shut her eyes tightly and took a deep breath.
“If this is about my rebellion-“
“I am upset with you also, Castiel.”
“Castiel.” She mumbled shaking her head.
“Bloody hell.” Crowley grumbled making his way to his feet.
“I’ll come.” Jack said immediately standing.
“You never confessed before because you were afraid of the rejection that would come along with it. It also didn’t help that you're desperate for your father's approval and you feel you will not get that from being with a man when you are supposed to be a ladies' man.” She said suddenly. Dean stared at her in shock before it quickly changed into anger.
“I- I can’t.” Jack said frowning deeply.
“I think that was the first time all of them ever openly showed that they- loved me.” She said swallowing deeply. Gabriel kissed the top of her head and nudged her gently.
“I- I don’t understand.” Sam said when it became apparent she wasn’t going to continue on her own.
The two glared at each other neither waiving until Dean rolled his eyes and tucked his gun away. He bent down and lifted her up before walking down the stairs with Sam following close behind him. Dean dropped her in the first spare room he could find and started running the usual tests on her. Salt and holy water did nothing to her, silver didn’t get any response- it couldn’t even pierce her skin. But an Angel blade did cut her only for it to heal quickly. The brothers then began arguing about whether are not they should chain her up.
“Are.” Castiel corrected giving her a warm smile.
“I need a drink.” Dean grumbled finally tucking the gun away and walking toward the library. Sam followed closely behind him staring at the young women in amazement. She looked down at the clothes she was wearing and cocked an eyebrow in silent confusion.
“I do not understand. Pull who out from where?” She asked finally.
“I think I’ll go back to heaven with you.” He said his voice carefully void of emotions. Instead of responding Gabriella simply disappeared, appearing in the kitchen behind Dean. She knocked on the table lightly to let him know he wasn’t alone yet he still jumped. He turned to face her and squinted at her in annoyance but didn’t say anything.
‘She’s unconscious, Dean!’
“Castiel has confessed his love to you, why have you not said anything back?”
“You son of a bitch.” Dean chocked out as he took long strides to Cas and wrapped his arms around him in a tight hug.
“I want to be a kid.”
“Rest, nephew. You deserve it.” Gabriella whispered kissing the top of his head gently. He latched onto her finger as a pacifier appeared in his mouth and blinked heavily until he fell asleep.
“Who are you?” Dean asked gruffly. There was a young woman leaning heavily against the side of the door clutching a shaky hand to her side. Her head was bent making it hard to see her face.
“Castiel, the empty has him.” Sam whispered softly. Gabriella tensed and looked between the three men as if waiting for one of them to say it was a joke. She nodded her head suddenly and turned towards Jack.
She slept for two weeks after that. Dean was looking for a potential hunt when he found one that could possibly be vampire clowns. He opened his mouth to fill Sam in only for a sound of fluttering wings to fill the air. Dean held his breath as his head whipped towards the sound. He tried to quickly swallow back his disappoint when he realized it was just Jack.
“I am.” She said studying him closely. Her eyes dropped down to Dean's hand as he absentmindedly traced Castiel’s name, which was engraved to the table. She stood up and smiled brightly at the name.
“I am still a hunter and I thought you were going to force me to be your slave or something.” Dean explained looking down at his burger.
As soon as the words left his mouth, he began to shrink until he looked no older than a couple of months. The men around the table chocked as they took in an adorable baby Jack.
“And it lead you here?” Sam asked frowning in confusion. He shared a look with Dean before they both took off and into the room the mysterious women was in. Jack followed closely behind them and frowned in confusion at the women on the bed. He took a step closer to her only to freeze when her eyes suddenly flew open and she gasped loudly. She disappeared and the boys stared at the cuffs hanging on the bed uselessly wide eyed before running to find her. They found her standing in the map room and looking around wildly.
“She’s hurt Dean!” Sam said staring at him incredulously.
“He doesn’t trust any supernatural being, don’t take it too hard, Gab.” Gabriel said seriously. Gabriella slowly looked away from where Dean had just disappeared. She turned towards Cas who was feeling his own truckload of emotions about the older Winchester and his sudden departure. It didn’t take long for the pieces to connect in her head and she rolled her eyes with a simple head shake.
“I-I tried to pull him out. But- but I’m not strong enough.” He whimpered tightening his grip on her. Dean had guessed that since Castiel hadn’t come back Jack probably couldn’t get him out. Gabriella frowned and pulled back slightly so she could see Jack's face.
“Hello, boys.”
“He prayed to me and asked me to forgive him for any and everything he’d ever done wrong to me, including leaving me behind when he left to get a taste of normal when the fighting started to get bad between Michael and Lucifer. ” She whispered keeping her eyes closed. The Winchesters stared at her wide-eyed silently understanding how similar her situation was to theirs.
“I’m sorry, Gab. I’m so sorry.” Gabriel whispered softly. Nobody had ever actually seen Gabriel as emotional as he was now not even when they’d gotten him back from being tortured by Asmodeus.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Castiel? Is he here?” She asked looking around the bunker as if he’d appear from her saying his name.
“That’s fine. I’ll see you when you get upstairs,” He said sending her a wink and disappearing before she could respond. She shook her head and turned her attention back to Castiel who still had not responded and instead was looking at his shoes like they were the most interesting things in the world.
“Dean?” Castiel asked cautiously. The energy in the room immediately changed and the flutter of wings filled the room.
“You are right Dean Winchester you do not deserve Castiel. But it is also not your choice to make.” She said standing up.
“We were at what was a young age-for an angel anyway. I brought Castiel over to meet Gabriel first but that quickly backfired when he disappeared and came back with Michael, Raphael, and Lucifer flanking him. They spent the whole time interrogating him and then had the gall to invite him to dinner only for father to take his turn in interrogating Castiel- as if he hadn’t created him.” Gabriella explained shaking her head with a fond smile.
“Fine, do not tell me.” She said getting up to leave.
“Please brother do not tell me you pulled some titanic bullshit and confessed your love as you were dying.” Gabriella said knowingly. Balthazar suddenly appeared and smiled brightly at Gabriella.
“Together.”
“I drained him of his powers and we left him lying by a lake.” Jake said watching Gabriella closely for a reaction. She giggled and smiled brightly.
“I would hurry with a decision. I am leaving soon and Castiel seems to want to come with me.” She said before leaving the room.
“He swore his job in life was to protect me and keep me from harm's way and part of me always used to think it was because our father had basically drilled that into his head as if he was just some soldier used to do Daddy’s work. I know God didn’t trust me, I think when He first found out about me he made sure to tell Gabriel to take me out if I ever stepped out of line-if I ever became evil.” She whispered training her eyes firmly on the table. Dean and Sam’s eyes met realizing how familiar that sounded.
“What does that mean?”
“If you won’t ever believe a word out of my mouth again that is fine but believe this, I have always wanted to stay with you. I just- I did not think I was allowed.”
Dean didn’t respond and Gabriella rolled her eyes.
“Since the moment Castiel touched your soul in hell- he began to see everything differently. He didn’t want to stand on the sidelines anymore, he wanted to help people. To station “angels in hospitals”. I was the only one he told knowing what the others would do to him if they heard him speaking how he was. I told him I’d be on his side no matter what he chose, the host or the righteous man. When Naomi freed him from purgatory I was the first to notice something was off when he would come to heaven but wouldn’t come immediately looking for me. When he hurt you in that crypt Naomi was forcing him to do it I watched her make him kill you a thousand times over and yet when the real thing came and you told him you needed him, he stopped.” She stopped seemingly looking for the right words. Dean appreciated that she hadn’t said she caused Castiel to become lost already hearing it enough times.
“Really?” Jack asked turning his attention to Gabriel with excitement.
“Exactly!”
“Auntie Rowena.” Jack said smiling brightly at the sight of her. She was wearing a red gala dress to go with her hair and there were two demons on opposite sides of her. Rowena smiled back proudly.
“You are only three years old.” She said looking at Jack with a small frown. He nodded his head and looked down at the table.
“I’ve always been on your side Castiel even when you haven’t know it.” She said softly. Castiel smiled at her words and walked up to her before wrapping his arms around her in a hug. She tensed for half a second before hugging him back.
“You have all been explained the terms of your coming back. If any of you so much as have a hair out of place-well let’s just say you haven’t even begun to see what I can do.” She said letting her voice fill the quiet bunker. Her eyes found Rowena’s and she nodded slightly. Rowena nodded back before disappearing taking all the demons with her.
“I remember the first time Gabriella introduced Castiel to us officially. We of course already knew all of the angels by name and face considering it was our jobs to be the protectors but we never actually got- attached. Gabriella here didn’t realize that was how it worked. She got attached to Castiel quickly as did he. When she first brought him for us to meet I honestly thought he was going to cry.” Gabriel chuckled shaking his head with amusement dancing in his eyes.
“The one and only.” Gabriel said making a lollipop appear out of thin air and placing it in his mouth. Gabriella stepped through the portal last and it closed behind her. The sword disappeared from her hand as she looked around the room.
“This is all I have left of him.” She whispered letting her gaze drop to it.
“Do not apologize, Samuel Winchester.” She said looking up with a fire in her eyes.
“Are-are you Dean Winchester?” She mumbled weakly.
“What, Sammy?” Dean growled already knowing what his brother was going to say.
“Hey, Kiddo.” A warm voice said. Sam’s head snapped towards the direction of the voice and gaped at the sight in front of him.
“You do not deserve the burdens that are going to come along with being the new God. Your childhood was taken from you, would you like it back?” Gabriella asked studying Jack closely.
“The demon Castiel killed, Belphegor, was going to consume every single ghost or soul or whatever that was released and roaming the earth. You do recall what happened the last time somebody did something like that, yes? Except they had good intentions can you imagine a demon doing the same thing?” She asked staring at him knowingly. She didn’t wait for him to respond before she was speaking again.
“Jack!” Sam said smiling brightly at the three year old. Jack lifted his hand up in his half wave half high five signature move and smiled.
“I- I want you to stay. I’ve always wanted you to stay.” Dean said softly.
“Your plan was flawed from the beginning, from letting a demon stay in my nephew's body to openly sacrificing Castiel and sending him to hell, the same place he gripped you tight and raised you from. If it was his death that you wanted you should have taken his Angel blade and stabbed him outright.” She spat angrily. She took a deep breath as a high-pitched noise started to fill the room, which Dean knew distinctly was her real voice, and shuffled in her seat. She waited for the noise to stop before speaking again.
Jack walked into the kitchen looking exactly how Dean and Sam felt.  Dean offered him his own plate of breakfast before burying his face in his coffee. He’d apologized to Jack the first chance he got making sure Jack understood Dean hadn’t meant a word of what he’d said and even though it took Jack a minute to believe Dean when he said that Jack was in fact family things were beginning to look good between them. The sudden clutter of something in the map room sent all three of them into hunter mode. They each ran into the map room, Sam and Dean both holding guns and their respective Angel blades tucked into the back of their jeans, and Jack’s eyes shining their golden color.
“As a human?” She asked her eyes shining with glee. Jack gave a shy smile in response and hesitantly nodded his head.
“Would you like to travel back in time with me and unsink it?” He asked as his eyes shined with glee.
“You’re made up of Amara and Chuck's grace.” Dean said as if to clarify. Gabriella shifted in her seat as her gaze landed on him and nodded.
“I thought Angels didn’t grow up.” Jack said frowning in confusion.
“My brother.” She answered with a sad smile.
“I- I can’t really explain it. I felt a power surge.” Jack said tilting his head to the side as his eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Dean physically stumbled back from how much it was so like Cas and shut his eyes tightly willing the image and thought away. Jack looked down guiltily thinking he was making Dean upset from his presence after what he’d done to Mary.
“You have grown so beautifully.” Amara said finally. Her eyes were shining with tears and Gabriella took a small step towards her.
“Explain.” He said after swallowing his second glass. The young women frowned at the commend but didn’t say anything about it.
“Dean.” Castiel said waiting for Dean to look at him.
“No, Cas that’s not true at all. But-but that’s not why I’m saying this. Cas, I’ve loved you from the moment you walked into that barn looking a lot like a holy tax accountant.”
“The empty.” Jack whispered watching in awe as the angels and demons started filling up the map room.
“I thought it was going to be a porno when I first go it.” She said chuckling and shaking her head. Sam smiled and relaxed some into his seat. Dean hadn’t spoken a word the whole time and he was still eerily quiet.
“Gab.” Gabriel said as he and the others followed after her. She ignored him and poured herself a drink.
“We were meant to protect each other and obviously I failed in holding up my end of the bargain.” She said frowning deeply.
“The empty is a void this eternal darkness that existed before God before- anything. It’s where Angels and Demons go when they die.” Sam answered. Gabriella nodded her head again and sat Jack in the seat she was just sitting in.
“I don’t know yet.” She answered honestly. Castiel stepped forward, catching her attention.
“Despite what you may think, Dean Winchester you are very easy to read.”
“Who is?”
“She got jealous. God wasn’t treating her the same as he once did he was being cold and well Aunty Amara didn’t like that at all. So when he created Gabriel Aunty Amara snuck in and split Gabriel’s grace in half mixing half with hers and creating me. She raised me as her own and kept me a secret for a while until the day God came. She ran leaving me behind with no explanation, and God took me in. He introduced me to my siblings- more specifically Gabriel whom I shared grace. We grew up together and took care of each other. When we first met he couldn’t stand me, I think it was mostly because Lucifer swore that since he only had half a grace he was weaker and it was my fault. It didn’t help when God practically forced him to take care of me ‘watch out for Gabriella, watch over her, take care of Gabriella’. After a few millennia though he did start to warm up to me.” She said with a sad smile.
“I will not fail you, Dean Winchester. However, when I come back I expect that you would have apologized to my nephew.” She said staring at him with determination in her eyes. Jack looked down at the ground quickly as Dean's eyes trailed over to him. He looked back at where Gabriella was just standing only to see that she was gone.
“You know Cas?” Jack asked speaking up for the first time. Gabriella turned her attention to him.
Dean took a deep breath suddenly feeling very bold. He let his eyes drop to Castiel’s lips.
“How long have you been in love with Castiel?” She asked taking a seat at the table. Dean watched her noting how she always seemed to dominate a room and unlike her brother she seemed to be all business. She wasn’t as stiff as Castiel, sitting and walking and doing anything with grace and poise but there were still moments where it seemed like her power was too big to be contained. Dean opened his mouth to demand it was none of her business but what slipped out was a chocked “15 years”.
"Why don't you help Dean with the dishes?" Cas says, in a tone that can't be described in any other way than
“Of course I know him. Who do you think trained him?” She snorted. Her lips turned into a warm smile as she thought of something.
He cradles Cas' cheeks between his hands and rests his forehead against his. Cas' breath hitches and his eyes flutter shut. All that can be heard are their shaky breaths.
"I told you! We need grace! Let's go then, get it out of me already." Dean says, his skin crawling with impatience.
Dean's heart pounds hard enough to break his ribs the whole drive. The gravel cracks like fireworks under the Impala's wheels.
to be the reason Cas is crying his eyes out. The former angel of the Lord, soldier of heaven and smiter of demons, crying because of a
"What if I told you I got a better offer and let Castiel out and the Nephilim granted me eternal silence in return."
"It's okay, I forgive you," Jack says and smiles through the tears.
is far worse than feeling everything at the same time.
dark, no, it's dark as if light had stopped to exist all together. Dean can't even see his hands in front of him and the silence is deafening. Panic rises in his body, how in hell is he supposed to find Cas like this?
But instead, Dean laid flat on his back, wallowing in his own guilt and anguish. All he could think about was how he poisoned everything and everyone he ever touched. The thoughts were suffocating. He had to get out of there.
Everything in the Bunker reminds him of Dean. The kitchen is organized in the way Dean liked it, the cups, color coordinated in the right cabinet, the plates in the left. His robe is still hanging on one of the hooks in the bathroom, his stupid hot dog pajamas is in the dryer and Sam can't bring himself to take it out.
Dean has lost track of time, it could be days, weeks or months since they defeated Chuck. He doesn't know, and he doesn't care.
It feels like the earth is shattering around him. His head tearing itself apart.
What if the blood spell was the only chance they got? And now it's too late? No, there
Dean puts his hands on Jack's shoulders, squeezing them tight, "Hey, look at me! you
"I guess you can't hear me, huh? Prayers probably don't reach the Empty, but I'm on my way, alright? And then, then we can… I dunno man, just hold on for me okay." He whispers as he drags up fistfuls of grass by its roots and then buries his head in his hands.
Dean heads for the door, he needs to take a breather and get some goddamn peace and quiet. Fuck, he's such an ungrateful dick.
The big toe on his left foot has doubled in size and is colored in a nasty shade of blue and purple. So okay, maybe Cas does have a reason to whine about this.
Eileen furrows her brows in a way Sam knows means she didn't catch what he was saying. Sam takes a deep breath and signs, "I love you". Eileen's mouth curves into a huge smile and she cups her hands around his cheeks and says; "I know, dumbass", before kissing him deeply. Sam suddenly feels a thousand pounds lighter. Maybe he doesn't have to be alone in all this.
"No." He whispers, already on the verge of tears. They walk inside, the house is unusually quiet.
"I don't know what to do anymore," he signs, he wants to look away, but knowing his ASL isn't exactly flawless, he has to give her the possibility of reading his lips too.
Dean swallows hard, he often forgets the losses Jody suffered. Which makes him an asshole. She's been through a complete nightmare, and now he's here to burden her with this too.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can't keep me here, I'm human" Dean hisses and the Shadow twists his wrist even further back and fucking laughs. The pain is so intense everything else ceases to exist.
"Can you teach me?" Jack asks, grinning.
There's mentions of Dean's underage sex work, nothing explicit.
They end up back on the couch, watching Friends and arguing about who's their least favorite character. It has been a long time since Dean had a full day off like this. He doesn't even remember when he spent a whole day on the couch. Since the whole almost-apocalypse-sibling-quarrel between Chuck and Amara, they had been on hunts non stop. Mostly because Dean goes insane when there's more than a couple of days of doing absolutely nothing. He doesn't need a shrink to tell him it's an escape mechanism to avoid dealing with his feelings, he's perfectly aware of that. But he wouldn't mind more days like this, him and Cas doing whatever they feel like, without having to stop one apocalypse after another.
When the dishes are dried and put back in place, Dean walks to room 15. His fist raised and placed on the wood door, but can not bring himself to knock. Instead he stands outside, ear almost pressed against the door to detect any sign of movement in there. Jeez, he really is a creep.
Something slams into the back of his thigh and he stumbles forward, spilling his beer all over the floor.
"Just tell me," Cas grumbles, still in a shitty mood for being awakened before noon.
"Oookay, sure. I'll have someone else look into it then," Sam grumbles, clearly confused.
Cas." He slowly approaches Cas, his head spinning.
Dean drank himself to sleep that night as well, just like he had been doing for the last couple of months. But the nightmares came anyway. In the dream he was running, trying to get to Cas who was pinned against a tree by a leviathan, Cas looking at Dean with a desperate look on his face. But Dean couldn't get to him in time, it seemed like he ran in slow motion. Right as the leviathan killed Cas, he woke up. Sweating, heart racing in his chest.
The entity's grin grows impossibly wider, "Oh right, I forgot to tell you. Castiel isn't here, hasn't been for a long time, you're too late son."
Slowly, he shimmers away from beneath the car, and sits with his knees drawn up against his torso.
. He has no fucking clue about what really happened in the dungeon, what led up to Cas being swallowed by the Empty.
Eileen intertwines her finger with his and the lump in his throat dissolves.
His stomach drops, it feels like all of him is submerged in icy water.
Dean stares at him for a moment, stunned by the fact the kid wants anything to do with him after all he's done. It's not until Sam kicks his shin under the table he manages to respond, "Yeah, sure thing."
A shaky breath escapes Dean's lips, Cas is not staying. If he were, now would've been the time to say it, right?
The burning amber liquid fills the aching void inside him. It gives him some courage, "I'm happy you're back here with us," he mumbles, swiveling the drink inside the tumbler. "And thank you for bringing Cas back."
Dean lays on a bed in the infirmary, staring at the cracked ceiling. If this doesn't work, then what? Then Cas will be gone forever.
Dean clenches his jaw, of course Sam would object to this.
but you know what I mean," She winks at Dean and turns on her heel, the red gala gown twirls around her feet.
Dean lets out an exasperated sigh.
A bunch of episodes later, and an intense rant from Cas about how Ross is a complete assbutt, Dean decides it was time to call it a night.
“Archangels do not but I was different since Aunty Amara pieced me together. Other angels do grow up like humans.” Gabriella explained as simply as she could put it. Jack seemed to null over her words before nodding his head. Dean started to leave the room not being prepared for another storytime or having to see how perfectly Castiel and Gabriella fit together.
And he hates himself for allowing these thoughts to roam freely through his head. He made a deal with himself years ago to not go there, to ignore the feelings. Dean doesn't even know what those feelings are, more than it's like they are two magnets drawn to each other. And if he allows himself to feel, it will only end in pain.
Sam has to guide him down the metal stairs, barely being able to see turns out to be quite hindering.
Sam seems to enjoy it, their new normal. No apocalypses hanging over their heads or cosmic entities out wreaking havoc. He has started to put together a database containing every single piece of knowledge available in the Bunker, going on dates with Eileen and even started to look for a job. He's thriving.
Dean woke up and stared at the ceiling and then turned his head towards the clock on his nightstand, the bright red numbers on the alarm clock were mocking him, 3.34 am.
"Dean, just give him some space," Sam says the moment Dean is on his way to stomp out of the library to follow the infuriated Cas.
Dean spins around, a sudsy hand reaches for the gun in his back pocket, "Jeez Sammy,
"Uh-huh," Sam's obviously not believing a word coming out of his mouth. Why does he even bother to ask then?
He kept scrolling through news sites, but gave up. Slamming the laptop shut and stared at the bookcases in front of him. Maybe he should call Cas? Just to check in. It had been weeks since he had heard anything from him. But where to start? "
"Hey, that's my line," he sits down on the bed, "And I'm not
The words knock the wind out of him and the shame leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. It's the first time his darkest secret is spoken out loud, he buried those memories years ago, pushed them away. The memories flash before his eyes and it makes him sick.
"I'm trying to watch the movie Dean."
Dean heads for the garage, with his duffel over his shoulder.
"Sam-Sam what did I tell you? Be careful!" Garth reprimands but the little kid just laughs maniacally and continues to bolt through the room with an inhuman speed.
"Hey man" Dean holds up his beer as some kind of weird greeting.
Dean shoots her a pleading look, "just promise me, I need to know he will be okay if this goes wrong. It's not exactly a waterproof plan we got going on here."
John Winchester, or what looks like him at least, is staring at him with a twisted smile on his lips. He approaches Dean who takes a few steps back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas turns around and puts his feet up on the couch, facing him.
Hearing Cas' voice again feels like getting electrocuted. A shockwave of pins and needles shoots through his body. Instead of crushing the phone to a million tiny pieces, he listens to it so many times he loses count. Self-torture at its finest.
"Where are we going?" Cas asks, for maybe the tenth time since they got in the car.
Sam loosens his grip around him and takes a step back, still holding his hand on Dean's shoulder, right over the faded scar of Cas' handprint. Sam looks gaunt, with dark circles under his eyes. His cheekbones are more protruding than before and his hair is slick and greasy against his forehead.
"You're not the only one who lost Cas and Jack. I lost them too, you know."
"I can't do this anymore Dean, you have to talk to me." He has the same look on his face as a kicked puppy.
The thing wearing his dad's face laughs, a sound that cuts through the void like nails on a chalkboard. "I'm one of your worst nightmares Dean, so what's the difference really?"
and Amara"
The door creaks as it opens and Dean almost swallows his own tongue. It took him a while to get used to seeing Cas wearing anything else than his usual get up, but nothing could have ever prepared him for
Sam has been desperate, he still is. He needs his brother back. One particularly rough night he walked to the nearest crossroad and considered making a deal. Right as he was done digging a small hole in the gravel, Eileen found him. She brought him back to the Bunker, signing so fast Sam didn't even catch half of it, but he knows enough ASL to get that she was pissed. And she had every right to be.
How could you tell me that stuff and then fucking die on me?"
Dean snorts, "you had just burned my friend's eyes out, so excuse me for being a bit on edge."
The corner of Rowena's mouth twists and she raises her eyebrows. "Well shall we save that pretty angel of yours so you can set this straight once and for all? Or maybe not
helping with the situation going in his pants.
Dean walks up the hill that's covering the bunker and sits down in the tall grass. Dean used to find Cas sitting here, looking at the sky or mumbling things in Enochian with his eyes closed. He always seemed to be so peaceful here.
He turns around to face her, she smiles when he meets her eyes.
"Rowena?" Sam is the first one to speak after they stared at her for way too long. "What are-,
," he hisses and scrubs his hand over his eyes. Why is this so hard? This is his best friend, they've been to (literal) hell and back, multiple times. Seen each other at their worst and basically been in the trenches together for twelve years.
"I'm eating alright, it's fine." He gruffs.
With suds up to his elbows, Dean absent-mindedly scrubs the pots and pans from yesterday's dinner, since
witches summon me,"  Rowena chirps.
. He shouldn't have said that. He hasn't said it to anyone, not since Jess.
"That's what I said"
Dean's attempt of keeping it together fails, and a few tears roll down his cheeks as the end credits roll. He quickly wipes them away with the back of his hand. "I thought this wasn't
They walk inside the barn and it looks pretty much the same as it did almost thirteen years ago. The sigils on the walls have faded and there's still glass on the ground from the shattered bulbs.
Eileen is a saint, she allows him to grieve, to cry and to be pissed. But she's also not afraid to call him out on his bullshit, what the hell did he ever do to deserve her?
"Why would I know what
." Cas smiles and Dean takes his hand and places it over his heart, "feel that? I'm real. And I'm- I'm not going anywhere, okay?"
But instead of texting Sam, Dean dials the number he memorized over a decade ago.
"You like this song, huh?" Dean says.
When they walk into the Bunker both of them immediately feel like something is wrong. Sam doesn't know what it is, but years of living on edge and never feeling safe gives you this superpower of knowing when something is
Rowena helps out with preparing for the spell and Sam seems thrilled. The bond between him and Rowena is something Dean probably never will be able to understand. They are perfectly synchronized, it's like watching a dance.
Every night, they go to bed together. Dean keeps telling himself it's because Cas is scared of sleeping alone, being a freshly made human and all. But the one night Dean actually went to sleep in his own room, he kept tossing and turning for hours before he bit the bullet and crawled into the bed across the hall, with Cas' hand in his.
matter." Cas looks at him so fondly it makes Dean's insides squirm. "Yeah, sure buddy. You too. I mean, uhm, you also matter. You know that, right?" Cas takes his hand in his and smiles and the simmering fear disappears.
"Sammy, can you promise me something?" He says hoarsely.
"I love you too, Cas."
When Sam and Eileen are fast asleep in their room, Dean walks to the kitchen, in search of something to silence the war going on in his mind. His muscles are stiff and his knees throb with every step he takes, laying flat on his back is definitely taking a toll on his already broken body. He raids the fridge for beers, but of course they're out, it's empty except for some left over pizza. Maybe Sam poured all the bottles and cans down the drain, suspecting this might happen.
the wrong thing to do. It's not like Dean has a good framework figured out for how to console anyone. His usual method involves beer and guns. So he begins to shuffle away and that finally gets Cas' attention.
The room suddenly feels too small for both of them, making him feel claustrophobic. "How?" He signs, feeling disgustingly pathetic. He's a grown ass man, not a high schooler figuring out how to approach his first crush. Okay maybe he is,
. Usually it's Sam's duty to do the dishes, but Dean suspects Cas has an ulterior motive with this request.
"Better?" Cas tilts his head and his blue eyes glimmer and
"I'm gonna hit the shower," Dean says and drops his duffel by the bed. He rummages through it for some clean boxers Cas slumps down on the loveseat in front of the TV, yawning like he's about to swallow the entirety of the room.
He doesn't answer. If they don't leave him the fuck alone soon someone will get hurt.
"The day Sammy learns to keep his goddamn mouth shut. And why were you guys talking anyway?" He can't help but feel a bit jealous, which is extremely pathetic. It's not like Dean is the only one who's allowed to communicate with Cas.
"Cas, look… this whole 'you being human' thing sucks, I know. But you gotta, I dunno man, keep grinding I guess. You can't sulk in here forever." Cas scoffs and mumbles, "I'm useless." "C'mon, let's get you some coffee and then we can do whatever you want okay? What'd you like to do?" Dean slaps his shoulder and gets back up on his feet. Ignoring Cas' self-deprecating comment.
Losing Dean was like losing a limb and Sam wasn't sure how he would ever be able to walk again.
God, if only things were different. If only Cas hadn't done his stupid fucking deal. Making deals with ancient cosmic entities never works out, they've learned that the hard way.
"Dean, we need the grace" Sam says, hovering over a rusty cauldron filled with ten different kinds of weird shit. Dean hands him the syringe and Rowena cuts deep into her hand and lets her blood flow, making the bowl glow purple. Sam empties the grace into the mix and the four witches start chanting something Dean can't even begin to decipher. For a second, Dean could swear their eyes glow purple.
Jack is beaming when he greets them in the kitchen, his hand stuffed in a box of chocolate Cap'n Crunch.
, and he chuckles.
They are on the way back to the Bunker from a quick salt-n'-burn in Iowa when Sam's phone buzzes in his pocket. He doesn't care to look at it, it's probably Jody texting just to check in. She's been keeping in touch almost every day to make sure he's doing alright. It wouldn't surprise him if Dean told her to do so, even when Dean was facing his own death, his only concern was Sam. Dean's always been looking out for him, being more of a parent to him than John ever was. Dean was the one who made sure he felt safe, always made sure he got up in time for school, made sure there was food on the table when John left them without enough money. A sting of guilt flashes through him, he never thanked Dean enough for everything he did.
"Gimme' one of those" Claire says and gestures to the can in his hand and Dean tosses one to her. He rests his back against the counter, one of the knobs on the drawer digs into the small of his back.
He doesn't wait for Sam to answer. Instead  Dean scrambles to his feet, his knees giving off loud cracking noises with every move, "So you can either help me find a way or get off my damn ass 'bout it. Your choice."
"Of course. We're soon crossing the border to Illinois. Dean won't tell me where we are going." Now it's Dean who rolls his eyes. Passive aggression, real classy Cas.
"It is okay to want things for yourself Dean. What you want matters.
"You're not him, you're the Empty," Dean chokes out, gripping the blade so tight his fingers cramp around it.
"You remember this place?" Dean says as he parks the car on the gravel leading up to the ramshackle barn.
nice and yes I remember the rules. I haven't used my powers once! Tell them Sam!"
Sam leans on one of the cars parked next to Baby. Dean winces internally when he takes a peek and sees it's the '57 Thunderbird. You don't casually lean on a car like that, it's basically a crime against humanity. Carmanity or whatever.
"It's okay, breathe", Sam murmurs, like he's talking to a child. Dean's body shakes uncontrollably, the adrenaline still vibrates under his skin. His hand throbs to the beat of his heart.
Dean's stomach drops and hard viscous words echo in his ears.
forgive me," he chokes out.
It works like a well-oiled machinery, Jack washes the plates and Dean dries them before putting it all back in the cabinets. The silence between them itches under his skin.
The mattress is hard and lumpy and Dean grimaces when he thinks about how sore he will be tomorrow. Maybe trying out some of Sam's stupid yoga exercises wouldn't be so bad after all.
It feels like hours before Sam removes the needle. The vial now filled with blue shimmering grace. Dean is breathing fast and shallow, his clothes drenched in sweat.
"Your popped corn will get cold"
He manages to fall asleep despite the huge knot in his stomach.
This was really really stupid.
Dean burrows his nails in the gaps between the marks Cas' fingers left behind, with enough force to break the skin. Physical pain is much easier to handle than the constant gnawing ache in his midriff.
"I'm fine," Cas is barely audible, muffled by all the fabric.
It feels like a thousand fireworks explode inside of him. Like the lights are shattering above their heads all over again. Like a crack of thunder splits the air and the shadow of Cas' wings illuminates the room. It's like the night they met all over again. But instead of fear and anger he is filled with love. A love so strong it aches in his bones and fills the dark crevices of his battered soul with light.
"Guys! Jack's here!"
Sam wants to leave, who wouldn't? He's thirty-seven for fucks sake, still living with his fucked up brother only because he feels obliged to do so.
hurt like hell. White-hot flashes of pain shoot through his body, fire raging in his blood vessels. The world shrinks down to nothing more than the excruciating pain. Dean doesn't know if he blacks out or if he screams.
Dean chuckles and Cas rolls his eyes.
"Are you okay?" Cas looks at him with furrowed brows and Dean wants to sink through the floor.
Dean draws in breath like he's a fish on dry land, "so I, uh,
The despair turns into raving fury. He takes the lamp on the side table next to him and throws it against the wall, it shatters and glass shards fly through the room. His heart pounds in his chest, with rage in every beat. The books fly out of the bookshelves and he slams his fists into the wall, over and over, tears still flowing down his face.
"Whatcha starin' at old man?" She snips, but she's obviously trying to hold back a smile.
So he
Dean gives her a weak smile and places a kiss on top of her head. He appreciates the sentiment, even though he knows it's not possible. Sure, Cas was thrown out of the Empty before, but that was before his stupid deal.
"Because it's annoying," Cas huffs.
"Well
It is too dark to see if there's anything closing in on him and he has never felt this vulnerable before in his life. The only thing he can hear is his own pulse thundering in his ears and the rapid breaths leaving his mouth.
"I know everything about you Dean. I can see right through you. You're a disappointment to everyone around you. How many times did Sam die because of you? Because you dragged him back into the life he never wanted? And don't get me started on the angel, he sacrificed himself for you how many times? And you repaid him how? By kicking him out, screaming at him,
stupid, I know something's up."
Cas puts a tape in the deck and a familiar intro rumbles from the speakers. Dean's grip on the wheel tightens for a moment. Dean shoots a glance at him, Cas' features are soft, relaxed. His hands are strumming a staccato against his jeans-clad thighs. The moonlight lights up the car and reflects in Cas' blue eyes.
"I think I know a way, or-" He holds up his hand as he takes a few wheezing breaths, damn he's getting old. Not even able to run down a few steps without getting out of breath,  "- There might be a way to open a rift, I mean we've done it before right? It's probably not everything we need, but it's a start."
"Say it again," Dean whispers softly against Cas' trembling lips.
Claire and Cas' relationship was complicated to say the least. And yeah, if someone was walking around in his dad's meatsuit, he would be pretty fucked up about it too. Who wouldn't?
They stop at a restaurant, yes a
His room is covered in a thick mist of booze, blood and sweat. Dean picks up the scotch from his nightstand and lifts it to his lips, swallows the last of it and drops it to the floor. It clatter against the other bottles spread out all over the floor.
"So you're God, huh? Should I call you the Lord almighty now or something?" He tries to go for levity, but Jack just tilts his head in confusion.
Sam is sitting in the war room, head ducked down over some old book. Dean takes a moment and observes his brother. Sam looks thinner, hair longer than ever, and probably hasn't shaved in a couple of days. Honestly, he looks just as crappy as Dean does.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated 🥺❤
"Hello," He smiles and waves a sticky hand in their direction. Cas almost smothers the kid in a bone-crushing hug. Then Jack's gaze drifts to meet Dean's. Dean shifts awkwardly on his feet, not knowing how to approach him. What do you even say to a three year old turned God who you tried to kill on multiple occasions? Who looked up to you and you betrayed, over and over.
"I'm yours if you want me," Dean whispers, barely audible. Cas places his hands on Dean's hips and he melts into the touch.
So now, he spends his time in the garage, hiding underneath Baby and replacing parts that don't need to be replaced. It's a distraction really, he needs to keep himself occupied or he will go crazy.
. You didn't want to listen, man. Then you said all those things to me before you died. You didn't even give me a goddamn chance to -"  his voice breaks, and so does he.
With enough alcohol in his blood to knock out an elephant, he falls asleep on Jody's couch, bottle still in hand.
"Well two hours of sleep is always something" he thought for himself. He contemplated pros and cons with getting up or to stay in bed. He decided to get up.
Holy shit this really
"What happened? Is Sam alright?" She looks concerned, and rightfully so, it's not like Dean shows up at her doorstep at 7 am every other week.
Cas crawls into bed with him, thankfully dressed in boxers and one of Dean's old AC/DC-tees. Dean rests his head on Cas' shoulder, because yeah, that's a thing they do now apparently. God, this whole situation is confusing. He wants to finish what he started before Jack returned. But the spell had been broken and the words were pushed back in that heavy lidded box deep down in his soul the moment Sam burst through that door.
"Cas is being a dick," Dean signs the same time Sam signs, "Dean is an idiot."
"Of course, this is your home. We're gonna set you up in your old room, okay?" Sam says and pats Jack's shoulder.
"I meant-"
"Heyheyhey,
"Your turn, buddy," Dean says and points to the bathroom. Cas rises from the couch and shuts the door behind him.
Dean swallows hard and turns his head, looking out of the window. This song was number seven on the mixtape he gave Cas. Not being able to put things into words, he stupidly thought some songs would do, that Cas hopefully would get the message but apparently he didn't. They never spoke of it and Dean was fifty percent relieved and fifty percent heartbroken over it.
Dean doesn't fight back.
That'll show her. Claire sends back a dozen eye roll emoticons and he grins. His phone pings again right as he's about to put it back in his pocket.
"Don't you have any other words stored in that big brain of yours? You sound like a broken record."
"Whaddya' thinking about?" Dean murmurs and Cas sighs, "what if this is not real? What if I'm still in the Empty and you are nothing but an illusion?" Dean is taken aback by his answer, cursing himself for not realizing it sooner. Of course Cas is scared, he's probably as scared as Dean is.
"He saved you Dean, it was his choice, not yours." Jody's voice is compassionate and her hand is resting on his arm.
a drink. Or else he might actually die.
. You need to be careful, you're fragile now goddammit," Dean grumbles after he retrieved some tape to splinter the broken one with the second toe.
"Yeah, being human is annoying, but you gotta get used to it. Listen to your body and all that crap Sam always nags about."
"Why? I told him to stop being so goddamn reckless and he went all ballistic, how is that
Sam stares at him like he completely lost his mind. And yeah, he probably didn't phrase that right. But it's not his fault his brother is a bit slow on the uptake.
"I needed to find some purpose, and I did. Hunting, saving people so they wouldn't have to go through the same thing as I did. Raising the girls, even though I sometimes question my goddamn sanity for doing that." She rolls her eyes and smiles briefly, "And you need to do that, find something to make it worthwhile. Hell, you're
"Okay. So, here goes nothing. Remember back in purgatory? The, uh, second time, when you disappeared? So, I prayed to you, well yeah, you heard that," he rambles, sweat starting to pearl at his forehead. Cas places the book in his lap and clasps his hands together, softness spreading over his face.
"I looked through the archives, there's not much lore on the Empty or if there's even a way to get to it. Nick kinda managed when he tried to get Lucifer back, but you'll need the blood of the thing you want to summon… and the only blood we got is from your jacket, and that probably won't be enough for the spell."
They check into a motel right off the highway. Dean doesn't even hesitate when asking for a room with one king and not two queens and when the clerk gives them a non-approving look (because people are idiots, surprise surprise) he doesn't feel a sliver of uneasiness. It feels like vindication, a small victory against 20 plus years of shame.
Thank God he's lying underneath the car so he doesn't need to meet Sam's manipulative puppy-eyes.
happy you reached out and came here, but Sam needs you. And don't even try to tell me you don't need him. You guys need to talk, like yesterday. For two people who've been living inside each other's pockets for almost two decades, you suck at communicating."
Jody scoffs, "Like you could ever stop a Winchester from doing anything stupid, that's kinda your trademark. But there won't be a need for me to look after him, because you will come back and do it yourself."
"No, don't talk like that" Sam interrupts, clearly agitated.
He clenches his jaw shut, of course he knows that. But Sam wasn't
Without the small light source the rift gave, it's pitch dark. Not
The days at Jody's place go by fast. It is pretty much the same, Jody forces him to eat by using her
Someone takes a step out of the dim lit kitchen,
He pops some painkillers and washes them down with beer, earning him a disappointed glare from Sam, which Dean pretends he doesn't see.
Cas furrows his brows in confusion, "what did she mean by that?"
, who couldn't wait to get down on his knees for not even a twenty in every dirty bar bathroom he stepped his foot into."
"No, you said popped corn"
Instead of seeking up Cas and tearing him a new one he heads for the firing range, shooting stuff always calms him down. Though filling a werewolf brain with silver would be more satisfying than a piece of cardboard, but hey, he takes what he can get.
Dean traces his fingers over the curves of the bottle and tears start to well up in his eyes. His knees give in and he falls to the floor, he rests his head against his knees. He allows himself to break. The grief rips through his body like an earthquake.  His lungs are about to implode,
"Do you need anything?" Cas snips and goes back to reading his book. Fuck, this dude really knows how to get on Dean's nerves. Here he is, ready to pour his heart out and Cas decides to be a bitch about it. Great.
"Why did you say that you couldn't have it?" Dean asks and Cas tilts his head and furrows his brows, "what do you mean?"
The nightmares can't be outrun, and it seems like they are getting worse and worse as the years go by. If it's not memories from hell, it's seeing Sam jumping into the cage, Cas being stabbed with Lucifer's blade, the smell of his mom's burning flesh or something else he wished he could scrub away from his fucked up head.
"So, I hope I didn't interrupt something important between you and Cas?"  Sam asks, side eyeing Dean who's occupied with shredding the cheese.
The week that follows Cas' return is strange to say the least. They haven't talked about the things Cas said before the Empty took him. Dean gets nauseous just thinking about it, which is all the damn time because the words echo through his head over and over like a broken record.
"Yeah, that sounds about right." Dean said, pulling himself together.
, we can use me."
"He died because
"That's not on you. He did what every parent would've done, stayed and helped their kid. He made the right choice, so don't worry about me." He rasps and downs the rest of the whiskey.
The kitchen was empty. Sam was probably still sleeping, it had been a long weekend, hunting down what they thought was a lone vampire which turned out to be a massive nest. They were still a bit battered and bruised from the fight.
"I know" she signs back, "we're not leaving".
"You realize this is going to hurt like hell?" Sam says and Dean tenses up at the sight of the syringe in Sam's hand, Jesus Christ that thing is
"You don't have to wait up for me, go to sleep if you're that tired." Cas shoots him an annoyed glare, "I want to shower too, so please hurry."
There's a hesitant knock on the door and Dean turns around to face the opposite wall instead. He doesn't want to see Sam's desperate look on his face and hear whatever guilt-inducing shit he has to say.
"Kids, am I right? So darn wonderful" Garth says, with not even a hint of sarcasm in his voice. Just as Dean opens his mouth to respond, baby Castiel takes a huge bite of one of the books lying on the floor and Garth sighs heavily and gives Dean an apologetic look.
They pay for their meal and head back to the car. The sun is setting behind the tall buildings, making the surroundings bathe in golden light.
"I love you." Dean draws a sharp breath, for a second he's convinced Cas is going to be devoured by black goo again. But nothing happens. He presses another chaste kiss against Cas' lips.
The Shadow interrupts his derailing thoughts by grabbing his wrist, twisting it and the bone snaps with a loud crack that echoes through the empty space. Dean lets out an agonized shout and his vision blacks out.
"No! C'mon man, get over here. Let's sleep," he slaps the space next to him on the bed, a bit too hard to be casual. If he could act normal for once in his life, now would be a great time.
Jody stares at him, processing.
"Can you be a bit more specific?" Dean croaks and tries to ignore the anxiety brewing in his abdomen.
how he feels. He's been cooking, held him through his nightmares, tried to take care of him when he's been getting himself hurt. But maybe this is all Cas wants. And if that's the case, Dean's content with it. As long as Cas stays with him.
Dean can't sleep, which is not exactly unusual. He has an uneasy feeling creeping under his skin. He goes through Amara's words to him over and over in his head. What
Dean decides to take the bull by the horns the next morning and texts Sam that he's coming back home. The moment he hits the send button, a massive knot forms in his stomach.
fault?"
In the middle of the room there's a rift. It's not golden like the other rifts they've seen, this one is black and looks like the substance that devoured Cas.
Suddenly everything feels almost
"So, you're going to stay or do you have better things to do?"
He looks through the library for a hidden bottle, he always keeps a secret stash in places Sam won't look. The only one he can find is a half bottle of bourbon, the one he and Cas shared when they still had hope.
The cavalry of hunters manages to find all the ingredients needed for the spell. Dean doesn't ask how, since the stuff is pretty obscure even by their measures. The only things left now are the grace and the blood.
Another sting of jealousy pierces through him, because why didn't Cas call him? Cas always calls Dean. Not Sam.
"Sam told me you almost got yourself killed by a Djinn" Cas looks pissed. He's kinda cute when he's angry.
Dean holds Cas through the sobs that rips through his body. Then Dean's brain decides to go fully offline and he starts to sing. He starts to fucking
Dean gets up to get more beers, but they are out. Sam had promised to do the grocery shopping this week, and it seems like he decided to get a shitload of kale instead of beer. He puts a bag of popcorn in the microwave, because Sam is not here to roll his eyes at Dean's dinner choices.
, don't you hear how fucked up that is?"
So that's how they ended up on highway 36, the city lights of Saint Joseph flickering in the rear view mirror. There's no goal set with this drive. No monster to hunt. No lives in need of saving. Just them and the open road beneath Baby's wheels.
This is it. Maybe this is the last time he sees his family. Dean's heart clenches in his chest as he hugs them all. He puts on his usual bravado persona and tries to ease the somber atmosphere in the room.
Cas' stomach rumbles loudly and he makes an annoyed sound.
"I hope this will be enough…" Sam says as he inspects the vial. Dean grabs Sam's wrist tightly and Sam gives him a worried look.
When she releases her grip around him, Dean feels even more guilt ridden than before. His father's voice echoes through Dean's head. If there's one thing his dad hammered into his head, it was to never show any weakness. And right now, he's failing miserably.
Happy 100k Destiel fics day! To celebrate I thought it seemed fitting to upload the next chapter!
in the same room, it wouldn't be weird. Thanks to the Djinn-induced reality he knows how good it feels like to sleep next to Cas.
Patience and Alex show up for dinner one night, and Dean joins them, trying to focus on the discussions. His mind blank and his eyes glassy. Alex talks about her assignments and idiot professors at university and Dean nods and hums at what he thinks are appropriate times.
"Dean…"
possible, don't you think Jack would've brought him back by now? I mean he's
(See the end of the chapter for
"Really Dean? Beer for breakfast?" Sam scowls and nods towards the empty cans on the counter.
"Kids shouldn't play with knives y'know"
Well,
Claire takes off in her beat up Subaru, rolling her eyes as she waves at them. Dean really has to convince her to get a new car, that piece of scrap she's driving is a goddamn death trap.
How can he un-paint himself from this corner without screwing things up even more?
"It's up to you buddy."
"How could you even expect me to understand when you don't fucking
"Cas?" Dean calls out, slowly moving forward, with his heart stuck in his throat.
The Banes twins talk to Donna about how they, with the help from Sam, managed to bring Alicia back from the whole twig-doll thing she had going on. Somehow Dean missed this completely, probably because he's been too drunk and too selfish to even ask about anyone or anything.
" Dean sputter.
(See the end of the chapter for
. "No! Of course not, we were just, uh, talking," he lies.
Dean coaxes the limping Cas out of bed with a promise of freshly brewed coffee and pancakes, which seem to lighten his mood slightly. Always something.
"I can't." It feels like he's getting choked.
Cas' sobs seem to escalate by Dean' embrace and he panics, this was
Cas gives him an annoyed glare and Dean slaps his shoulder before picking up the bag of popcorn off the floor, "Come on, we got movies to watch."
___________________
"Bye Cas! Bye Dean!" Jack says and his voice is barely audible, probably already on his way to see another cool animal. Dean can't help but feel a bit jealous.
"Fine!" Dean storms off, slamming the door to his bedroom behind him. He packs his duffel, throws some clothes and his guns inside it. Anger is easy. That's what he's good at.
Dean taps his fingers against the table as Krissy silently translates the book. If she could hurry up already that would be great. Jody gives him an annoyed glare and gestures to him to stop. Which he doesn't.
"Can you please call Sam? He's driving me crazy. I'm not some mediator, you know that right?" She takes the plate out of his hand and places it in the dish rack.
While Cas and Eileen help Jack set up his room, Dean starts dinner, he goes with a classic; mac'n'cheese. One of the first things he ever learned to cook, before he  was even tall enough to reach over the stove. Well, maybe
"You had a full year without hunting, you should be well rested" Dean said, with a lot more bitterness in his voice than he intended. Sam furrowed his brows, but did not respond. Dean knew deep down he should not keep punishing his brother for not looking for him during the year he spent in purgatory. But it still hurt.
"No." His voice is sharp like the edge of a knife. Because it's true, he didn't fix things. Sure, he said
He went up from his bed, with a groan. His head pounding from one or seven too many glasses of whiskey last night. The only thing that seemed to keep the nightmares away was to drink himself to sleep. Sam had been nagging Dean non stop about his drinking habits since he escaped purgatory, but according to Dean they were perfectly healthy. Who doesn't need a couple of beers and a few shots of whiskey each day to function?

"He's doing great. Maybe we shouldn't have allowed him eating cotton candy for breakfast though," Sam says with a sigh.
Dean doesn't respond, there's no escape from this. This thing will kill him and make sure his dad's face is the last thing he sees.
And why in the hell does this turn him on so much? It's not like it's porn or anything, and he's seen so much porn he's basically desensitized by now. He can't take his eyes off the screen, but in his head, it's Cas with the cowboy hat, the two of them in a tent out in the middle of nowhere. And that imagery is
"Yea yea buddy, it ain't dinnertime yet." Dean mumbles to Miracle who watches his every move, with his tail thumping against the concrete floor.
When Dean tells Jody about Billie, the dungeon and Cas' last words, he gets nauseous and the room starts spinning. He digs his nails deep into the skin of his wrist, tries to ground himself.

The thing they have going on, whatever it is, drives Dean insane. Cas said he loved him, but still he has made no move whatsoever to take their rela-
A glass wall is separating Dean from the rest of the world, he can see the women's mouths moving as they talk and laugh, but he can't make out a single word.
"Dean" her voice is mellow, and without pity.
Eileen playfully punches his shoulder, "using your words for once in your life would be a nice start, Winchester."
"Jack!" He answers, the frown on his face gone in an instant. Dean knew Cas hates being away from Jack and who could blame him? He'd lost that kid too many times already. Dean gestures to Cas to put the phone on speaker and he obliges.
"Sam!" Dean yells as he busts through the door and almost stumbles down the stairs, the eyes of a dozen hunters are on him immediately.
Eileen rolls her eyes and gives him a meaningful look, "how you feel, dumbass."
"I know he's here, he made a deal," Dean snarls and pushes the blade harder against the entity's throat "so now, you bring him here and let us out or I'm going to bug you for the rest of eternity."
"We can't leave him there, he's family. If you'd known Eileen was in the pit, being ripped to shreds, would you have let her stay there?"
"Dean," his voice suddenly uncertain.
him."
"Hey, haven't seen you in a while" Sam says, warily, "y'know, it's not what you think, we were just… scouring the market, for fun. I won't just pack up my things and
This is probably a bad idea. But if there's something Dean has mastered over the years, it's going through with stupid ideas. It's still over a five hour drive so there's plenty of time to change his mind.
The Empty stands barely an inch from Dean's face, grinning at him but the eyes show no emotion.
The door opened and Sam walked in. "Dean, are you okay? You know you can talk to me right?"
Dean keeps driving north, and soon he passes the border to South Dakota. Before he knows it, he has parked the car on a very familiar driveway. He hesitates, this was stupid, what is he even doing here? Just as he's about to put the car in reverse and pretend he was never here, Jody sticks her head out of the door and looks at him with a confused look on her face.
Jody sighs, "when Owen died, uhm, the first time, I kept thinking
The waitress flirts mercilessly with Cas and the jealousy leaves a bitter taste in Dean's mouth. But Cas is as clueless as always and only seems to have eyes for Dean, which is both reassuring and makes his face heat up like a furnace. Blushing more than he did the first time he got to second base with a chick back when he was a freshman in high school.
"You never told me what happened back there, with my fa-
Dean catches a glimpse of Cas over Jack's shoulder and the sight makes him weak. Cas' smile is radiant, warm and contagious. Dean can't remember ever seeing him smile like this in the twelve years they've known each other. He looks absolutely beautiful.
let me down, I know I've been -" He falters, words slowly dying on his lips. Yeah, been
Dean stares at the sandwich in his hand, but can't bring himself to take a bite.
"She's such a little shit" Dean mutters and picks up his own phone, he does a few Google searches before he finds something to send back to her. A drawing of a whiny baby holding a knife. Perfect.
They drove to the nearest diner and sat down in a corner booth. Sam ordered some green smoothie and whole wheat toast, and Dean ordered the greasiest thing he could find on the menu. "You know you're gonna get a heart attack with that diet right?" Sam said. Dean rolled his eyes, "Not that I'm gonna live till I'm 70 anyway, nobody does in this business, and by the way, your drink looks like vomit." Dean said and started to eat.
Dean really wants to call Cas, his fingers are hovering over his name on the phone, aching to press the green button. He chickens out, because Dean Winchester is a coward.
forgave Cas but Cas never got the opportunity to forgive Dean. Not that he had deserved Cas forgiveness anyway. He didn't deserve anything from Cas, definitely not his love.
"You woke me up Dean, you disturbed my peace and now, now you're gonna pay. You will be trapped in your own worst nightmare forever."
Dean is standing by the sink, his hands drenched in soapy water when Jody sneaks up behind him.
“Flirting?” Jack asked looking between Castiel and Gabriella with a newfound interest.
“That’s right.” Sam said giving her a warm smile. Her frown relaxed slightly and she looked over at Dean who was holding his gun aimed at her head.
“They said you were back.” Amara whispered staring at Gabriella wide-eyed.
“Stay out of my head.” He growled getting ready to stand.
“No, Jack.” The Winchesters and Gabriella said at the same time.
“Dean.” Sam said shaking his head.
“I-I know you. Sam Winchester.” She said. She frowned immediately afterward as if she wasn’t sure if she was right or not.
“Does he know?” She asked softly her voice void of any judgment. Castiel looked down sheepishly before nodding his head.
“I’ll remind you every day if I have to.” He said giving her a wink. She smiled and nodded her head.
“Food is ready.” She said with a warm smile. Gabriel was watching her closely and she gave him a look, saying she’d explain everything later. They made their way into the kitchen just as Dean started to call for them. Everybody took their respective seats, with Castiel and Dean ending up next to each other.
“No, she would not.” Gabriel answered for her. Balthazar ignored Gabriel and continued to stare at Gabriella letting his eyes slowly rake her body.
“Gab, I’m-“
“What are you doing here?” Sam asked walking up to her and wrapping his arms around her.
“I think it helped that I was not afraid to beat my message into your brother.” She said seriously though her words lacked any heat. They ate comfortably after that, each of them taking turns to tell Gabriella different stories about their lives.
“I-“ She stopped talking as a rip suddenly appeared in front of them. They watched, prepared for battle, as a foot stepped out followed by another until the person stepped out completely revealing Crowley. Rowena was the first to react, casting a spell that sent him flying backward.
“When Asmodeus took him, he literally shut me off from him. I couldn't feel his pain, pray to him-nothing. But I never stopped looking for him. The day he- died, I felt all of his pain and I tried- I tried so hard to find him. I begged him to tell me where he was but-" She cut herself off and shut her eyes tightly as she rolled her shoulders once.
“That is not true at all. My brother had me locked away in a cage.” Amara said glaring at the ground for a second before looking back up at Gabriella.
“I did not mean to upset you.” She said softly. Jack shot up to his feet and threw himself in her arms. Dean watched, his heart twisting in his chest as Gabriella hugged Jack and rubbed his back soothingly as his body shook with quiet sobs. It was moments like these that reminded Dean that Jack was only 3 years old and he’d been through so much. Gabriella didn’t ask any questions despite her burning curiosity and continued to soothe Jack until he calmed down.
