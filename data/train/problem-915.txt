The next strike drew a strangled cry from him and he gave up restraining himself and began to roll his hips in a desperate bid to find friction. He managed to brush his cock up against his own awkwardly placed legs every once in a while to keep himself from going completely insane as the blows continued to rain down on his buttocks, thighs, and back. The flogger was the sort meant to be used for humiliation more than damage, but the leather was still likely to break the skin what with he amount of strikes. He could feel something trickling down the back of his thigh, but he wasn’t sure if it was blood or sweat. He’d never been so grateful for an awkwardly timed erection as he was at that moment.
“You have my permission,” Sherlock growled, then swallowed the man down as if starved for his cock.
John gently dabbed damp cloth across Holmes’ face and noted that the burns were superficial. He’d lost a spot of eyebrow, but nothing worse. When asked to open his eyes he blinked as if in pain and John watched the tears shift out the ashes that had strayed inside.
“And what am I to wear?!” John gaped, “Those were my only clothes!”
“If it’s you then I know it’s fair. You’re a morally upstanding man. You’d never kill needlessly, or harm for that matter.”
!” John wailed, “For
“All hands,” A crewman grunted, shaking his shoulder.
“Not yet. When you do the right thing I’ll… I’ll… reward you. Or something.”
John made it down to his boat and shoved Mary in, wrapping a few blankets around her out of concern for her unborn child before shoving his privateer hat down over her head and stuffing the gag back in her mouth. He grabbed some provisions and his journal from the cutter and tossed them into a small caravel with Heinason’s flag flying. He quickly pushed Mary’s boat off and then scrambled into his own, pulling off the nice dress and tugging on a hat and jacket he’d found over his usual clothing. He used an oar from the cutter to push the ship in front of him, rigging the sails of the caravel to make it look as if he were chasing after it.
“No, sir,” The man replied hesitantly.
“Sherlock!” John cried out, “Please, may I come, My Lord?”
The bells sounded for the first dogged watch, which was mealtime for the White Crew and the short- or dogged- watch for the Blue Crew. John’s stomach growled. He could smell the large meal of the day cooking in the galley and it was torture. He knew he could go down there and get food and simply take a debt hit, but it was starting to scare him. All of their debt bags were tacked downstairs on the galley wall and he’d seen his today. He had several red chips in there and he’d only been on the books for three days! It was half full! The cost to survive on this ship was more than most people in labor jobs made per day. He’d hoped to start earning back, possibly enough to request a hammock and blanket knowing he’d take a hit for those. It wasn’t looking possible.
“No you don’t.”
“They do, but now they’re waiting for you to screw them over,” Greg sighed.
. He can’t help you now, Sherlock. I can’t even help you.”
“John killed him.”
“I’ve been fantasizing about taking you for months,” Sherlock growled, “Having you back in my bed. In my arms. In my mouth.”
Lord Holmes considered that a moment before replying, “Dr. Hope. Jefferson Hope.”

She led us down the back stairs into the kitchen, and pointed silently to a bunch of keys which hung from a hook by the back door. Holmes pounced on them, identified the correct one immediately, and exclaimed in satisfaction.
I wondered if Lyndale knew who Mr Smith was and where his daughter had met the man. No doubt Lyndale could easily bring pressure to bear on Briggs if he wished. I did not know how the Catholic Church hierarchy worked, but I imagined Briggs could get into hot water with his bishop or with the Franciscan prior if Lyndale lodged a complaint against him. I doubted he'd been authorised to allow people like Smith to give secular talks on the premises here, for instance.
.. .. ..
Were we always to touch only with purely carnal intent?
"In that case, my dear fellow, our task is simple. All we have to do is be present in the house at the time of that next burglary, along with the police. I shall show myself, he will recognise me and most likely panic and attempt to shoot me, the way I suppose he did when he startled the man in the Gordons' hallway - though what he was doing there I still don't understand. Then we shall have him for attempted murder, which will see him hang."
"We were planning to go out riding in the park, father," he said in an aside to Mr Lyndale the elder. "Unless you need us here?"
"Does he generally make recommendations in your name without consulting you?"
"I have followed my heart," Georgiana said flatly. "I don't believe God will judge me harshly for that. I would have thought you of all people would understand, Nicholas."
I hid a smile. Holmes himself could be quite conceited at times, and it was only the fact that his conceit was well-founded that separated him from the pompous fools of the world.
.. .. ..
"I—I feel the same way," I managed to say.
"I suppose you're right," I said casually, "and we can do nothing but wish the young lady well."
On the way out of the friary, along a cool stone corridor, Holmes caught my arm, pulling me to a halt and drawing my attention to a large, dark painting hanging on the wall.
I fell to thinking of Miss Georgiana Lyndale. Where was she tonight? Did she regret the estrangement from the rest of her family, or did she not care? My own brother had always insisted he was indifferent to our father's opinion of him.
Holmes paused on one page to scribble something in the margin. "Hardly surprising, given the world we live in. It is more often the case than otherwise, I fear."
"Will you help me find Georgiana, Mr Holmes?" Lyndale begged.
.. .. .. .. .. ..
"Really? Most interesting."
. You make me sound like some kind of wanton."
In the event, we spent the evening curled up in my armchair, which was the broader of the two. With Holmes' arms around me, I read through a significant portion of my latest sea novel, while he devoured a densely written German text illustrated with rather gruesome pictures.
"That was quick," I commented.
Holmes, naturally, was looking out the other window, absorbed in the bustle of shops and people: office clerks and bankers on their way to work, street-hawkers already at their pitches, and sundry other ruffians and gentlefolk.
That made him look around sharply. "By yourself?"
The man laughed this off in the most horrid manner imaginable, and finished the conversation by handing over a small cloth-wrapped package. The maid tucked it under her cloak, and hurried away, followed a few moments later by the man she had labelled a murderer.
Pinet shook his head emphatically.
Holmes rose to his feet. "Let's see what this young lady's sharp eyes have spotted," he said, earning him a look of overwhelming pride from the young woman in question.
"No, no, Watson, he had a key. I first discovered proof of this in my investigation at your friends' home. The key in their kitchen still bore traces of the oiliness left by the wax used to take a copy of it. Someone was gaining access in a legitimate fashion to each of the houses, managing to take a wax impression of the house-key, and returning in the night for a more nefarious purpose. The question remained: how did he gain access in the first place? The explanation rapidly became evident: the neighbourhood is of recent build, and therefore carpet fitters, cabinet makers and the like often have occasion to call."
"In fact, the blackest piece of evidence we have against Lyndale is that I'm quite convinced this cameo theft is a complete fabrication," Holmes said. "But wasting a consulting detective's time is not a crime, sadly."
Darkness had fallen, and he was only a dim shadow now. I rose to draw the curtains and light the gas lamp. As I moved about the room, I turned over the details of the case in my mind.
I was surpised to hear Miss Lyndale had been visiting Father Briggs' soup kitchen. It was not something that ladies of her class, of any religion, generally did. They preferred to do their charity work at a distance. Visiting the poor on their country estates was fine, but they preferred to keep the urban paupers at a distance. Every fashionable lady in London had organised a bazaar or held a dinner party for charitable works, but few of them had ever ventured into the vast sprawling slums of the East End.
"I hope she knows what she's doing," I said. "A young woman cut off from her family is wholly reliant on her husband."
Then Holmes leant closer to me, and said in a low voice "Watson - "
"Is Mrs Spencer involved in this business with the cameos?" I wondered aloud.
"Unashamed, then," he suggested.
"Both the Armstrongs and the Winstons are involved in Lyndale's business dealings. Although that's only circumstantial evidence, certain elements lead me to surmise that they are involved in this business too. The Franciscans, however, are certainly not."
For a moment he did not reply, but went on stroking my bare forearm lightly with the tips of his fingers.
Could it always go on being this simple between us? I feared not. The world was a complicated place, with rocky currents to navigate. But Holmes seemed to want this as much as I did, and I clung to that thought like a lifebelt.
Mrs Georgiana Smith held out a hand to calm him. She looked directly at Holmes, her chin held high.
"We haven't even finished with the furnishings," Mrs. Mackay put in. "That empty corner there will hold a cabinet, for example - although the thieves took everything I intended to display in it," she added in a disconsolate voice.
"Good morning, Holmes," I managed, discovering my voice to be rough with sleep. I cleared my throat. The sound was followed by a short silence.
"The other set is in the kitchen somewhere," Gordon said. "I'm not quite sure where. Margaret will show us."
"Well, yes," I said, suddenly feeling shy. I had never distinguished between men and women, both different but equally fascinating. Holmes' gaze was on me, and I felt rather as though I were pinned under his microscope.
"Don't be ridiculous, old chap."
"I often dream that I am at your trial," he said in a low voice. "I am not on trial, only you. Sometimes, in my dream - " His voice broke. "I often wonder how many such cases end in suicide before a trial is even spoken of."
"They soon will be, just not quite yet. They can still be of use to me, I believe."
Next, he took the lantern from me and moved on to the kitchen window, leaving us inside. It was barred, and he spent little time there. The higher windows in the same wall were, I thought, too easily visible from the mews and neighbouring buildings. Holmes seemed to agree, for his next step was to crouch to examine the ground around the back door.
"I locked it myself after showing Monsignor Pinet the cameos," Lyndale confirmed. "And it was found locked when we discovered the fakes at the end of the evening. The housekeeper keeps the key with those of all the other drawers and cabinets, in the pantry."
On this dramatic note, he paused.
We returned to Baker Street in time for lunch.
"A trap!" I exclaimed.
He looked down at my outstretched hand, but remained standing where he was.
Before Holmes could reply, Doris herself took a deep breath and burst out, "Someone's been at the back window, sir! And the back door too."
"Mr Holmes, please tell me you've made some progress identifying those burglars," Mrs Hudson said as she served us lamb ragout. "I haven't slept easy in my bed since that night Doris found someone had been at the back window."
He laid aside the scrapbook. For a moment he sat staring into the distance, his gaze thoughtful. Then he glanced down at me.
I blinked, surprised. I had not expected Father Briggs to be sympathetic to her, much less for him to imply that he knew where she was, and had perhaps even aided her in her flight.
"I must say that the thought of investigating your boyhood haunts holds a definite appeal. You know I am constantly avid for any opportunity to increase my encyclopedic knowledge on the subject of John H. Watson M.D."
Shortly after that, Margaret Donnelly arrived, still out of breath from her long march on foot across town. She glanced around nervously before joining the man in the kirk doorway. I was sure that the choice of the graveyard as meeting place had not been hers.
As Garner spoke, my attention was caught by a tiny movement in the corner of my eye: Lyndale shifting in his seat. He looked uncomfortable, and I could not help but wonder why. Was Garner lying? His own face and manner were impenetrable, but Lyndale was more transparent.
Having won my freedom, I was not certain what use to make of it. I stood for a moment in the hallway in my hat and coat, attempting to think of some agreeable pursuit with which I could while away a long afternoon, whilst my mind returned continually to Holmes, his cold words of dismissal and his heartfelt expression of misery. I heard a door open behind me, and turned to see Margaret Donnelly crossing the hallway, her arms full of clean linen. She stopped, seeming to hesitate as if she wished to broach some subject with me, and I summoned up the will to give her an encouraging smile, despite it being at odds with everything I felt inside.
"But... what is the truth?"
"I don't disagree, Georgiana," Lyndale said awkwardly, holding up both hands as though to ward her off. "And I will never tell you to—to repent or anything like that. But—" He paused. "No, nothing. I've nothing to say."
"I don't think they're guilty of theft, if that's what you mean."
"Watson," he said in a warning tone, facing me now, his glassware abandoned.
.. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..
"The Lyndales are one of England's more well known recusant families, I believe. That is to say, one of those Catholic families of the gentry who managed to hold on to their land and wealth through the Reformation and since then."
Mrs Georgiana Smith was unaccompanied. Holmes offered her a seat, and Mrs Hudson brought tea.
"So you don't think Miss Lyndale stole the cameos?"
The girl cut him off, her voice carrying clearly in her anger. "Dinnae dare mention his name!"
I raised my eyebrows at the implication of bigamy.
He turned back to look at me, still curled up in my armchair, and gave me an amused look. "It's rather more likely to be me, you know."
"Inspector, I shall need you to send a constable to Baker Street at seven o'clock this evening. Let it be a stout, hearty man, who isn't afraid of a little rough and tumble. He is likely to be set upon with physical violence."
"Indeed." Holmes sounded thoughtful.
I drifted off to sleep with Holmes a warm and comforting presence beside me.
A few weeks later, Holmes paused in the middle of opening his post to show me a letter.
"Indeed I do know them," said Mr Willis as he set to work on Holmes' hair. "Not that I ever exchanged a word with any of them, o'course, but I sometimes see them at charity fetes and the like. The father's a widower, but he has two daughters and a son, all grown up."
Finally, he straightened.
Holmes leant forward. "Do you happen to know a man named Joshua Wilcott?"
"No." I thought of young Lyndale and his great friend Huntington—the love of his life, or a boyhood passion. Who could tell? "Perhaps marriage can bring him happiness nonetheless. After all, many people are drawn to both genders, you know."
I stared at him in confusion.
"I suppose the main problem is that there's no proof against Lyndale," I ventured to say aloud.
, I thought suddenly, an oft-suppressed fear coming unbidden into my head. I told myself that if this were a night for revelations, then now was the time to speak up, and did so in a rush, before I could lose my nerve. "However, sometimes - sometimes I fear that this cannot last forever - that you will tire of me. After all, I am a very ordinary man, and you - why, my dear fellow, you are Sherlock Holmes!"
"No, the burglary at the Gordons' was a little different - and it was that fact which led to the death of the unfortunate young man in their hallway. The difference at the Gordons, you see, was that they have in their employ Margaret Donnelly, who was already being used by Brodie, the cabinet-maker, as an intermediate between himself and the locksmith who cast the keys - we saw her take the wax impression of a key at the end of that meeting in the kirkyard, in fact. Now for some unknown reason - perhaps business was a little slack - Brodie decided that Margaret Donnelly's employers would also prove a profitable target, and ordered her to procure for him a copy of their house-key."
We breakfasted in silence, which was not unusual in and of itself. It was Holmes' habit to scan through all the newspapers at high speed, while I contented myself with reading the Times in detail.
.. .. ..
As for my father, he had never told me what he thought about the estrangement.
John glanced aside at Sherlock who merely raised an eyebrow at him as if to ask why he would question her story.
Sherlock sang out, “
“I can’t make heads nor tails of it,” Donovan told him, handing the book over, “It’s gibberish. There was no food and the water pot was long empty.”

No, that’s about accurate.
“So why would he let

“Don’t be ridiculous. We’re going through with my original plan.”
John sobered instantly. Of course, the doctor wouldn’t have stopped with killing Holmes, he’d have killed them
Lestrade bolted around the bonfire as well, tripping on a log- he hoped- and toppling to the ground. When he scrambled up and cleared the putrid mess of burning flesh he found Sherlock kneeling beside John. He was leaning against the well with his eyes shut. His lips were cracked and bleeding and his face was grey beneath the sunburn. The rest of the men who had jumped in the gig with them caught and stood there in shock. Another gig-full showed up while Sherlock dribbled fluids into John’s mouth. Donovan was on the boat, but Victor was kneeling by Sherlock’s side with his face tense with fear.

Greg chuckled, “You’ve been spending time around Sherlock again. It’s time to hide all those gorgeous curves.”
“John Watson, you said?” The reverend uttered, his voice shaking a bit.
one, and landing on his back on the deck with the wind knocked out of him. Sherlock stood over him and waited for him to gasp in air.
It was adorable watching John posture throughout the day. He didn’t seem to understand that he’d won the respect and even adulation of the crew, so he was still behaving warily around them while they struggled to impress the man who took a punishment for one of them, not to mention stood up to their captain and survived. Meanwhile he completed the more urgent of the cabin boy assignments Sherlock gave him and then stomped over with a determined look.
“I have
“Mutiny?” John asked in alarm.
Those nearest to the conversation looked interested, their eyebrows raised as they chatted about how beneficial that sounded. Lestrade had to put a stop to that
“Hush now,” Sherlock scolded with a haunted look to his face, “I’ve demonstrated more than once that I can go too far. You have a safety word and you will use it.”
They intend to assassinate the king, but not by actually killing him. They plan to destroy his reputation until the people revolt, but they’ll be doing it by using him as a pawn. They’ve already begun. Apparently they had him sign the plans to build a well in an impoverished town. The well plans were poorly constructed and the well has since become fouled by refuse and poisoned half the town!
Mycroft has broken me. I’m disgusted by this fact, but it’s the honest truth. Sherlock’s (former) shipmates have turned on him and reported that he’s going on a murdering spree. He’s given me the option to step in and confess to serious crimes, including forcing Sherlock to act this way. It will save him but condemn me. I’m going to be burned at the stake. When I made the promise I’m ashamed to say I wept, but as I write this I’m resolved and have made peace with the situation. I’ve never had anything beautiful in my life before that was truly mine, it only makes sense that I die that way as well. At least I was his for a time.
“Is that why they stank so dreadfully?” Holmes asked around his arm.
John smiled and slowly slid the garter down his leg, lifting his foot so he could suck on the big toe. It tasted of salt and wood from the deck. Sherlock laughed lightly and pulled his toe away, nudging John’s cheek with his foot as punishment for being tickled. John chuckled out an apology and pressed a kiss to the garter belt. He tossed it towards the bed and then walked around Sherlock to take a look at the clasps. He’d had the dress altered so that the tiny buttons down the back met. John let out a slow breath of wonder at how elegant his long torso looked and began to slowly slip each button down. He counted twenty by the time he reached Sherlock’s waist. Beneath that was a faded off-white corset. John eased the dress down and Sherlock stepped free with that unearthly grace of his.
“Bring those here, no point wasting the fabric. We can alter them quite a bit to make them seaworthy. They could be your… nice clothes.”
“No, no, and no.”
“That’s… a simple solution.”
John was tossed over the railing, the back of his shirt yanked over his head and tucked beneath his chin and his hands lashed to the rails as his face stared down at the crew. Their faces had changed from angry to shocked and confused. They literally had no idea why he would do something like this for a stranger.
“You can join your friend or I can pick you off one at a time like shooting fish in a barrel.”
“Oh, everyone is,” Sherlock sighed, pushing out of the sex swing and sauntering over to John.
“He attacked the fort. Singlehandedly. Pages are missing, they appear to be torn out. I think someone has tampered with this.”
Day 23

Greg’s face must have given away how absolutely horrified he was because Sherlock laughed and then put up a hand to stop him shouting at him.

“Yes, I’m happy like dis,” Xe smiled down at him as xe collected xyr kit, “I may not have de body I want, but I have de respect and de love of mine life. I have a future.”
“Relax! It’s not what it sounds like.”
“The one where my cabin boy refuses to let me beat and fuck him until get rid of the chip system and let him beat the crew!”
“It’s slightly more respectable than announcing that I’m paying you for regular sex, yes.”
“He was attacking you,” John pointed out.
“He’s tough,” Lestrade agreed, giving Sherlock’s shoulder a squeeze.
“What colour are your former fiance’s pubic hairs?” Holmes asked.

“Stay calm,” John spoke softly, “I’m going to clean up your face, but I need to get some clean water first. Do

the chip system, and I’ll let you have me.”
The doctor moved around him, studying the dedication to detail that came with Captain Sherlock Holmes. He wore the full outfit sans the stockings on his feet. The corset went from just above his pecks down to his waist, pinching him only a bit at the waist. John started at the bottom laces and worked them up to the halfway point where the next knot lay. He let the ribbons flow through his fingers before starting on the next. Finally it was easy to slip it off of Sherlock’s body and lay it on his desk. Beneath the corset was a chemise and underskirt of soft cotton. John let out a slow breath at the thought of such soft fabrics touching his strong lover’s skin.
“Answer me,” Holmes insisted, and then poured rum over John’s torn flesh.
John asked, coming fully awake.

‘How… how bad is it?’ I asked him, wishing I were mentally stable enough to scream at him about what he’d just done instead of wondering what it looked like and how he was so captivated by it.
unimaginative.”
John nodded and the man stomped back to his stove and promptly dropped a few coals into a bucket suspended from the ceiling. He plopped a teakettle down in it and walked away while the thing swung with the ship. John wondered that he wasn’t covered in burns and wandered away.
“No, we can’t risk you being seen.”
“Sherlock?”
Then he dropped into routine. John once again took over the main aspects of his father’s business. While he’d been away his brother had pulled a sort of Prodigal Son and returned with money to help the father John had abandoned in his quest for Mary. Now John was the shamed one and he found he cared less and less about their impression of him. He kept working hard to keep people healthy and when a few pleaded that they couldn’t pay he helped them in secret. His methods got out and a young woman approached him in church with a whisper of irregularity in her cycle. John knew nothing of abortion, but he knew of others who did and contacted them for her. They were ready to charge her the woman’s entire dowry. John paid them what little he had for a rough lesson and returned to her with that knowledge and a warning that she might not survive. She lived and in gratitude offered to marry John. This was not the first woman to recognize his disinterest in the female form, but John couldn’t tie himself to her. He didn’t want to live more of a lie than he already had. He sent her away with a fond smile and a fresh start. More came. Most lived. John perfected the method and found ways to help the women prevent it based on the stories Donovan had told him.
while John recovered. John was passed down the ladder and Holmes ordered Dimmock to take him to sickbay.
“Oh, he seemed nice,” Molly nodded cheerfully.
They stepped into the sickbay cabin and Holmes slammed the door shut behind them after dismissing Dimmock who only put up a cursory protest. John lay face down on the mattress, his breath coming in pants as desire and pain warred with each other in turn. Holmes kneeled beside him and John turned his head to stare into his blown pupils.
“I know where they are,” Sherlock grumbled, which was actually a surprise since he hadn’t set foot in the castle since he was a three-year old terror.
“My Lord!” John choked out, his voice shaking with joy or sorrow, “I thought you were dead!”
“Wha?” He asked blearily.
“What about fruits? Apples?”
“But what?” She asked, folding her arms.
Holmes favoured him with an intense look and then sat up, his bedclothes sliding down to reveal his pale chest. The nipples hardened in the chill of the room and John shivered as his body reminded him of how
Sherlock was the first on shore, and he went bolting through the city without responding to Lestrade’s calls. John should have seen their ship. He should have known and come to

because of this ship; yet the reality is that this ship will outlive us
“Well, I’ve spent months missing you inside of me,” John replied, “Perhaps if you wish to reward me some day, but… please, Sherlock. My Lord. All I want is your length inside of me.”

“I can pay you once I get back home if you’ll just…”
“White.”

where he was ordered to examine every single person while Holmes made rounds of the ships. He had to truncate his exam- sticking to asking about symptoms and glancing them over- with such a high volume of patients in line, especially since Holmes seemed to have no need of sleep. They were well into the early dawn hours when he finished examining the last patient and John was fit to drop. When told to swing over to

“What who wanted?” Lestrade asked.
“John,” Holmes said softy in greeting, not offering an explanation.

“I’ll keep you right.”
“Raising and lowering a boat several times over can be so tedious,” Sherlock explained, then he waited for
“The flannel bin, they’re useless for anything save that,” Holmes replied, resuming his fainting pose.
“I see,” Sherlock frowned, “Then we’ll be trying to lock me up in a ward for the rest of my life? I won’t have it.”
“My people are from islands,” Xe told him, “We saw dem pulled from the sea by the gods. We know of the moving of fish and currents. One such god saw me trown into de sea by a white devil such as ye self. Dey decided I was worth more dan dat and gave me powers. I used dem to change my body to make me happy.”
“My bed,” John replied sharply.
“If it sinks-”
Holmes hurried to catch him up and grasped his arm, “Come to

” The cook stated, stepping forward, “How long have you known, Sherly?”
He turned on his bare feet and strode out the door with a swagger that wasn’t lost on the fuming John Watson. He was ready to scream obscenities at the man, but he was too weak and was asleep almost immediately from the sheer exhaustion of having to speak and the emotional drain of finding himself in a slightly nicer prison.
Three days later and the island were silent. The bonfire had gotten out of control and burnt up a huge section of the town, largely burning unhindered. After that it had been a matter of time. The flames were reduced to a miserable smoulder as the remnants of a few older, larger houses continued to flare up and then collapse down on themselves. Sherlock felt peace settling inside of him with the silent setting that Tortuga had become. The only question he had was how long would it last? How long before Sherlock needed more bloodshed to reach this state of calm?
The boat swayed and John shifted across the deck, finding his sea legs after months ashore. He lifted his head and breathed in the ocean, eyes shut to the bright sun that warmed his face. He spread his arms and let out a slow breath before shifting to strip off his shirt. His shoes were next. His britches last. He stood in a bit of undergarment wrap and waited a moment, watching as Sherlock studied him from where he’d been watching John sing and cavort across the deck with the crew. The sport was done. The song over. The men and women climbing the rigging as they readied the sales. John was ready to purge himself of his past life and his lover was headed towards him to burn the past from his body.
The taller man ran his fingers down the centre of John’s back, watching his muscles flex. He moved them down to John’s ass crack and back up to grip his hair lightly. He pulled and John hissed as his head was extended back at an awkward angle.
Then he turns things around on me. He tells me that I’m not allowed to get off without his permission. ‘You’re mine and it’s time to prove it,’ he says. Then he unwinds some rope so he has a real thin bit of it. He wraps the string around my bits like a sort of harness for a horse with my cockstand as the head. It went around my waist, under my bollocks, and then looped around the base of my willy where he tied it in a bow. It was very loose. ‘I’ve made it so if you get an erection it will bother you, but not cut off your blood flow,’ he tells me, ‘this will help remind you that I and only I am allowed to bring you to orgasm. You will wear this always. Wash with it. Only when I remove it can you climax.’
“Slowly, slowly. It’s too good a job to rush.”
Sherlock smiled heatedly and wrapped his arms around John’s torso, pulling his naked body close to his own.
“Not civilized? We don’t let our chil’ren starve. Not civilized? We don’t buy and sell
“If anyone needs me,” Sherlock stated as he led John back to the captain’s quarters, “Don’t.”
“Among other things,” Holmes whispered, his lips brushing against John’s.
He buried his face in my hair. "I cannot lose you, Watson," he said in a muffled voice.
"I am very glad to see you up and about so soon, Watson."
"Never fear, Mrs Hudson," Holmes reassured her. "That's all under control. They won't be returning to Baker Street again."
"We're looking for a Mr Smith who once gave a lecture here on the thermodynamics of steam engines," Holmes said after we'd exchanged greetings.
Three times already. My goodness. After four years teetering on the brink, it had finally come to this.
Holmes was silent, his gaze fixed on me, his eyes in shadow. I wondered if he were thinking the same thing as I was. What words could express what I wanted us to be to one another that night?
Lyndale did not answer. He seemed shocked, as though he were only now realising the import of his actions. When he had embarked upon this insurance fraud, no doubt he had not foreseen that he would one day be doing his own dirty deeds in a London alley. I saw now that Holmes had taken away all his men, and simultaneously given him only a short amount of time to act, forcing him to do his own dirty work.
To my inexperienced eye the fakes seemed entirely convincing. I should never have suspected anything amiss, had I not had the picture of the originals to compare them to. Admittedly, the work was rather less precise, and the details a little blurred.
I looked up sharply. "Out of wedlock, you mean."
Willis beamed. "Glad to be of assistance, Mr Holmes. I suppose this is for one of your cases, then?"
At this point he performed once more his odd, seated bow in the direction of Mr Lyndale, who nodded in acknowledgement.
Without design, we found ourselves standing in almost exactly the same configuration as we had been yesterday evening, just before I kissed Holmes for the first time.
I called for the tab. "We are going to the police next, Holmes."
"Father Briggs looked like he often took a turn in the ring himself," I said thoughtfully. "Boxing club, soup kitchen, tournaments, lectures... it seemed like a busy place. Though I wonder if all those statues are really necessary."
"Guilty of nothing but extreme inflexibility, I believe," Holmes said.
"Well, not in my lifetime, at least."
But I said only: "Your basin is running over, Holmes."
She stopped short.
"Most concerning, most concerning," Lyndale said. "I have some interests in the area."
"It's not a particularly happy family, is it?" Holmes said instead of answering. "No love lost between the two sisters, for a start."
"Very well," he said. "Perhaps you could prepare a list of guests and servants present yesterday evening, in advance of my arrival?"
"You both speak as though your suspicions were principally directed at my guests," he cried.
He stowed everything quickly and tidily—coat, hat, gloves, umbrella—and then turned back to face me. For a second or two we stood there, still awkward at the last. Then Holmes moved, and so did I, and we were kissing.
I had been thinking we might just go on like this without ever discussing the matter, but this seemed like a good opening for a conversation.
"For what?"
I held out my hand. "Come over here, my dear fellow."
"Monsignor Pinet has been here since last Friday," he said in response to Holmes' first question. "We have a small guesthouse and often host visitors to the diocese."
"But Father Garner is available," suggested the friar who'd greeted us. "He's in the church, playing the organ. You can find your own way, Mr Lyndale, I'm sure."
"I'm here as moral support for Mr Lyndale," he said stiffly.
He raised an eyebrow. "Neither do I."
Less than a minute later, we saw a shadow slip through the gate, and come to stand by the side door of the kirk. I felt from the slight change in Holmes' stance that he had seen it too. There was little to distinguish, only that the man was small and slight, and muffled against the cold.
He took a deep breath. "He does not make for such a pleasant topic either. Indeed, I find it unbearable to know that we are sitting here helplessly, and all the while that villain is making his preparations for tonight."
I was obliged to admit that I had not.
Monsignor Pinet gave him a slight bow of acknowledgement, and cleared his throat.
"Mostly she liked the music, I believe," Holmes added thoughtfully.
"And she was a willing participant in all this?"
I put a hand to my head, frowning. It was still at least two weeks until I was next due a haircut, and his suggestion left me perplexed.
We emerged from the passageway into a small, dingy courtyard, lit only by the small amount of moonlight that managed to filter down through the gap between the rooftops far above. Our mark was nowhere to be seen. I came to a sudden stop, snatching Holmes by the arm and pulling him back into the passageway.
The son, Nicholas Lyndale, was already in the room with a young man who turned out to be one of the people featured in our list of reception guests, namely Mr William Huntington. The two young men were sitting in armchairs by the window, deep in conversation, forgotten novels lying open in their laps.
The cameos were about two inches in diameter, of delicate pale cream shell carved in relief on a dark brown background. The caption in the pamphlet indicated one of them to be a reproduction of Raphael's Madonna and Child. The other was also the Virgin Mary, but done in a Greek style.
"I am, but not at you."
"I suppose it was when you realised your father was a criminal and a fraudster," Holmes said gently.
However the construction site was far in the distance, and here we were quite alone.
I said as much. Holmes raised an eyebrow, no doubt detecting the suppressed emotion in my voice.
After a minute he turned away from the cabinet and cast a quick, searching glance around the rest of the room.
"Not hurt?"
At this point the coach came to a halt at the Haymarket. We climbed down, and walked slowly back to the Gordons, Holmes' arm in mine. I knew that the risk I would take that night weighed as heavily on his mind as on mine - indeed probably more so - and I tried to entertain him by recounting the stories of some of the recent popular literary works to come out of Edinburgh. This gave him the opportunity to scoff at tales of cut-throat pirates and Robin Hood's merry men, and thus we both passed a very agreeable half an hour.
"In the past I've known men who saw things otherwise," I said cautiously, hoping that confidences on my part would prompt similar confidences on his. "Men who were made miserable by their own inclinations."
"Certainly not. She is guilty of no crime worse than wanting to marry a divorced man, and outside her church."
"That boxing club this morning reminded me I haven't been in the ring in months."
"A fine building you have here," Holmes commented. "Have you been established here long?"
"Well then - "
It was something of an exaggeration. My parents' home did indeed contain a copy of that eulogy to Protestant martyrs, but I couldn't say I recalled ever having opened it.
A dour-faced housemaid showed us out. Silently, we walked down the steps and into the square.
On most evenings, he would have stretched out his long legs before the fire, the picture of ease. Tonight, however, he was sitting upright, his entire posture filled with tension. Finally he spoke up, his words emerging slowly. "If ever again, God forbid, you should chance to be injured in the course of an investigation, I hope I shall manage to behave with a little more restraint." He swallowed, a hint of nervousness in the action. "That is, if you will ever agree to accompany me again."
The first thing I became aware of was my dear friend's voice, snapping out orders in a harsh, strained caricature of his usual tones. Upon opening my eyes, the first thing my gaze encountered was his face, which was deadly white, his eyes blazing with fear and anger.
Father Garner gave us a small, superior smile. "It has occurred to me how peculiar it is that the theft should occur on the very night that someone was present who could instantly detect it. Were I in your shoes, Mr Holmes, I would have a particular interest in Monsignor Pinet."
Holmes nodded. "Mr Lyndale has recently been a victim of theft," he explained. "You will certainly be able to read all the details in the papers this evening."
"Why not? Many people are." Holmes closed the book he had been reading and looked up. His gaze was directed into the distance. "My own parents' marriage was a very happy one, I believe. Not that a young child can truly understand such things, but in my memories it is so."
The light of gas-lamps from the street only reached the area near the kirk, and our hiding place was steeped in darkness. The night air was more reminiscent of January than July, and the graveyard was cold and damp. I shifted uncomfortably, feeling a twinge in my leg.
I prevaricated. "Sometimes it's pleasant to simply stay in... "
"Dr Watson," he exclaimed. "I protest!"
I did not voice the thought, not least because the word 'love' seemed a little precipitate.
"I quite agree that what you describe is hogwash," I said mildly. "But mustn't each man find his own way of surviving in this world?"
"You think they're conspiring together?" Were they on Holmes' list of suspects? A man of the cloth, and the very gentleman who had hired us?
"It seems there's more to the matter than we first thought. Holmes speaks of a scandal to rock the foundations of London's banks."
"It's over now, and we can't do anything about it. I don't believe Garner was blackmailing Lyndale for money, by the way. Men like Garner are usually beholden to rich donors like Lyndale. I expect Garner liked having things the other way round for once."
He blinked. "I beg your pardon, Watson. The fact is, I can scarcely believe you are sitting here. I had rather thought you would be furious."
"Well, they certainly seem to have had a pretty good go at it," he said cheerfully. "They spent almost three hours here."
As I came further awake, I recognised what Holmes was humming.
"I suppose you were raised on the Oxford Tracts," I said, with a smile of my own.
"Mr Lyndale's son?" We had not seen him since Holmes interviewed him at his father's house, the day after the business with the cameos.
"That goes without saying," Holmes replied.
"Young Lyndale's friend Huntington struck me as a gambling man," I said. "Though Nicholas Lyndale himself didn't."
"May I give your brother your address?"
I sat down at my desk to sort through some papers relating to the case Holmes had solved just two days before, concerning the peculiar goings-on in a series of riverfront warehouses. The task of tying up the loose ends usually fell to me, especially when one case rapidly succeeded another. When Holmes was in the middle of a new case it had his undivided attention.
She rose to greet us, but the first words from her mouth were not a greeting.
I was taken aback by his vehemence. He saw my expression, and elaborated:
"Well, yes, of course." Lyndale gave him a puzzled look. "There can be no further need for enquiries."
It was to Sherlock Holmes that the vast majority of the post which arrived at 221b Baker Street was addressed. Aside from my correspondence with the editor of The Strand, I only received occasional letters from the few school and university friends I had kept in touch with, or advertisements from manufacturers of medical equipment who seemed unaware that I was not currently in practice. One morning, however, in early summer 1882 we received for the first time a letter which was addressed to both of us.
My chest was painfully constricted. I struggled to comprehend the exact significance of his words. Did he mean to suggest that I could no longer accompany him on his cases? Even worse, that one of us should move out of Baker Street? Or even - my heart clenched at the mere thought - could he possibly be suggesting that we should never see each other again?
"But you did foresee her elopement. Not that it's really accurate to call it an elopement. Her marriage, I should say."
"Mr Holmes. Dr Watson." Her eyes narrowed. "Did my father ask you to track me down?"
Nicholas Lyndale was taken aback. "Oh... Yes. Of course. Thank you. I mean—" He stopped short, then burst out, "The fact is, Mr Holmes, we have no idea where she is."
"This is my family, here in this house," she said, but regret lay heavy in her voice.
At this point someone lit the gas-lamps in the room, plunging us into light, and Holmes let go of my arm.
"I wonder if Father Garner has asked for permission to call on Mr Lyndale tomorrow morning," Holmes murmured. "I believe they have some minor business matters to discuss."
.. .. ..
Which did she think was worse, I wondered. Stealing her father's cameos or marrying a divorcé? Not that Miss Lyndale had committed the first of those acts, but she was presumably on the brink of the second.
He led us through the room to a small office-like space that seemed to double as a storage room, filled with wooden crates and canvas sacks, the few pieces of furniture groaning under stacks of religious pamphlets and sacks of potatoes.
Over lunch we both poured over the day's newspapers, which we had not had time to finish that morning. The lunch things had scarcely been cleared away when a boy called with a note from Father Briggs. Holmes unfolded and read it, then held it out so I could see the text.
He turned around at last, and the dead frozen expression on his face stabbed me to the heart. "I don't quite know myself yet," he said slowly. "I spoke without having thought the matter through, something I do not often do. But I could not hear your voice without coming into the room, and I could not face you, and yet hide what was in my mind."
"Isn't that for me to decide, Holmes? And it must indeed be me: he is far more likely to panic at the sight of me than that of anyone else. If you think it will work, then my mind is quite made up. I shall be on the alert, and I certainly shan't let myself be shot. I am not afraid. And we simply cannot allow him to go on terrorising people, as you say he does, if it be in our power to stop him."
We were just finishing dinner when Mrs Hudson came into the room, accompanied by the new maid, who was blushing and hiding behind her mistress.
He still stood some way away, his thin lips pressed together, his eyes dark and pained.
Holmes put his lips to my ear, although there was no one around to overhear us. It was simply something he took every possible opportunity to do. "That was Margaret Donnelly, the maid."
"It was on the recommendation of Mr Lyndale, through his man of business." He gave us both a puzzled look. "Father Garner told me to answer all of your questions, but I'd assumed you'd be asking me about that evening at the Lyndales when their cameos were stolen."
"Pleased to meet you both," he said as soon as Mr Lyndale had introduced us, with a cool smile that made it impossible to tell whether he truly was pleased or not. "Of course, I would be delighted to answer a few questions."
My heart swelled. "I want that too."
"I don't suppose anyone noticed anything amiss this afternoon?"
He refused all offers of a drink, looking uncomfortable and awkward.
Holmes shook his head impatiently. "The idea had already occurred to me, of course. But I will not hear of it."
Instead of being annoyed and disquieted, as I was, Holmes seemed intrigued and almost pleased by something. Before I could challenge him on this, he turned to Mrs Hudson.
"I am an amateur of cameos and other objets d'art," he began, in the overly pompous voice of a man who is savouring being, for once in his life, the centre of attention. "I was aware that Mr Lyndale possessed two particularly fine cameos. They are quite well known in the field, and feature in numerous catalogues and pamphlets. I was a guest at Mr Lyndale's house last night, and I intended to request a viewing soon after my arrival. In the end I did not even have to ask, for the cameos were on permanent display in a glass cabinet in the salon in which we were to spend most of the evening. As soon as I entered the room I had the opportunity to admire them, indeed to remove them from the cabinet and examine them in detail, for Mr Lyndale was kind enough to allow me to do so."
"You cannot possibly treat a man of my position like this!"
"I don't believe it will come to that." Holmes rose to his feet. "Thank you, Mrs Smith. You've been very helpful."
For a wild moment, I wondered whether Briggs had stolen the cameos and sold them to fund his work here. But that seemed farfetched.

She rang for the nurse, who came to take the children up to the nursery. As the children left, a man in his fifties appeared in the doorway. He had thick brown sideburns, and on either side of his nose were marks from the spectacles he no doubt wore to read engineering plans. Mr Smith, I presumed.
As he leafed through the pages, I watched his face. A small frown line had appeared between his brows. His gaze was fixed on the scrapbook.
I would have reassured him immediately, had I known just how to put it. Gushings of undying devotion seemed a little inopportune, not to mention potentially embarrassing for both of us. Nor did I wish to appear completely dissolute or licentious by announcing that I'd be quite willing to repeat the encounter, no strings attached.
"Of course."
.. .. .. .. .. .. ..
I folded the letter back up, raising an eyebrow at Holmes. He returned my look with a smile.
"Less than a year ago," he said readily. "We have only lived here a few months, like most of our neighbours."
I opened one eye to give him a baleful look. "Holmes, I swear, if you are thinking that you are looking forward to years of correlating my ale consumption with my growing waistline - "
I laughed. "Well, Holmes, if you will insist on buying a penny-dreadful guidebook, instead of one of those excellent brochures by Mr. Thomas Cook, you are bound to finish with a biassed view of the city."
"It's quite a simple matter, on the face of it," Lyndale began. "My family owns a pair of cameos, of historical significance and also of considerable monetary value. They have been replaced by fakes."
"Surely the note she left contained some details of her intentions?"
"Quite so, Mr Lyndale," said Holmes, which meant nothing at all, and then changed the subject. "What did these cameos look like, precisely?"
I decided it would not be inappropriate at this point to suggest retiring to the nearest bedroom.
I thought for a moment. "In fact, now that I think about it, the whole idea is ridiculous," I pronounced. "There are many other items of value in that household, more easily disposed of, not least many less distinctive pieces of jewellery, I'm sure."
"Holmes!"
Why now?
"Let us hope, nonetheless, that you will yet manage to find some measure of the usual thrill in hearing the facts recounted now, before they are quite confirmed or the story complete." He leant back in the coach-seat, his sharp chin resting on the tips of his joined fingers. "It's a tangled web, no doubt, but I was first put on the right trail by the spate of burglaries in the neighbourhood, all evidently committed by someone possessing a key to each house - "
The next morning I found signs that Holmes had retired to bed at some point for at least a few hours' sleep, late as the hour must have been.
Sherlock Holmes stood in the doorway, the most peculiar expression on his face as he looked down at me. He came forward to stand at the foot of the bed, still in silence, while the maid excused herself and slipped out.
Sherlock hopped down and headed for Greg with a smile that the Captain of
“What a pity you’re on a boat in the middle of the ocean.”
There were a few shouts of encouragement from below him so John pried his eyes open to see people looking at him with newfound respect.

Greg grinned as he tugged his breeches up, tucked in his shirt, and fastened his belt. The gorgeous woman draped across the bed was stirring and he wanted to see the happy, sleepy look on his face. Molly sighed and rolled over, stretching like a cat. Greg sat on the edge of the bed to adjust his stockings and buckle his shoes while she smiled up at him.
She waved her hand at Sherlock who rolled his eyes and shook his head in amusement, “That’s quite enough Sal. You’ve made your point. Sal, by the way, is

“Losing you…” Mycroft hesitated, and then continued with a stronger voice, ”Losing you is going to break my heart.”
me. Sherlock had decided I was to be his furniture. We shifted position numerous times. First I was on hands and knees while he sat on my hips and stared up at the stars. Then he had me lay on my back and he laid across me with his back arched across my groin. He pointed out constellations and told me how to navigate by the stars. I had to really restrain myself to not hump his back, but he snapped that riding crop over my thing whenever I did. He always reduced me to a whimpering pile of hormones.
Holmes chuckled and led the way to… his cabin. John jerked away from him and started stubbornly towards the ladder that led to the mess and the sickbay beside it.
“If this were
The man chuckled, “You’ll have hard luck with that. We’re all fit as fiddles. I suggest you take up a few chores to keep yerself fed.”
Then Sherlock spoke, ‘Oh, look at you. So perfect. So beautiful. I can’t ruin this. You must stay just how you are until it dries. Then I will have Cap’n Sal in here. He’ll use his superior skills with paints to capture this moment forever. Do you need anything, my pet? Water?’
John heard someone whimper and hoped it wasn’t him. Stubble brushed against his face, burning his flesh, and sent electric shocks down to his cock that drew a gasp out of him. A hand stroked along his side, tickling for a moment before turning firm and strong as it slid towards his back where it pressed to the small of his back until John was obliged to inch closer.
Molly scoffed at him and Sherlock turned back to Greg, “John will be punishing people on my ship.”
“Well?” Sherlock asked sharply, “I asked for him, not his-“
“Flog them.”
“Please tell me that’s an antidote?” Lestrade pleaded once again.

I’ve had a hell of a time getting free of the city. I managed to get a riverboat ride up the Thames in exchange for some labour. Once I make it to the harbour I’ll steal a boat and head for Tortuga at top speed.

“He’s a privateer. We all are.”
to hit them anymore! John will let me hit him!
“I need to see my patient.”
Sea Swing Stove
Holmes shifted onto his side and curled up, looking small and vulnerable with the blanket tight against himself. John drew closer out of curiosity.
“Doctor Watson is a stranger here,” Sherlock stated in a stage voice, “Unfamiliar with our ways and having never volunteered himself for this voyage. He’s a doctor and therefore valuable to us, but he’s offered to take the punishment of this idiot here which could very well result in his death. Therefore I have the difficult decision between lenience and severity. You will decide. The flog or the whip? We’ll vote for whip first since it’s my favourite. Who wants him whipped?”
“Then what am I to do?!” Watson ranted.
Holmes nodded, “I should have

to go. Cuba and Florida were still largely under Spanish rule, and while they had a peace agreement in place at the moment it was still tentative and they were angry about breaches in the original trade agreement. Virginia was the nearest safe harbour, but John would not live that long without proper care. Sherlock knew all this and his order was clear. Return to the nearest Spanish harbour in Florida and weigh anchor. They got to the harbour at sunset and were met by a group of guards, but the order to arrest hadn’t come in yet. They were merely to be questioned as to the strange reports from those fleeing Tortuga. Sherlock went with them silently after informing them of a crewman’s need for urgent medical care. Lestrade, Donovan, and all three first mates were also pulled aside as the officers. The crew were ordered to stay on the ship as it remained under guard in the port. Three escaped into the water that night never to be seen again but the rest remained to be shipped back to England along with Sherlock and the officers.
Sherlock grabbed Donovan by one arm and shoved the glass into her hand with trembling hands. She peered out and stilled.
Day 20
“This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” Sherlock groaned, petting John’s hair and offering him more water. John’s eyes opened weakly again and then fell shut again. They were glazed and disoriented.
I wasn’t able to woo my way back into his chambers that night, and the guilt of having been forced to abandon him to his misery alone was distressing enough that I lost sleep as well. This time he was the one to enter and comfort me, pulling me into his arms and pressing my head to his chest. I fell asleep listening to his heartbeat, soothed by the sway of the ship like the gentling of a loving mother. I understood then that there would be times when he simply needed my company, or to be held, or to be pampered in a way that had nothing to do with sexual release.
Sherlock was dizzy. All the blood seemed to have drained from his head and dropped into his feet. He sank to the deck and gripped the rails with white-tipped fingers as the world swam around him.

Lestrade opened his mouth to explain to Sherlock that they’d still be called cowards and worse, but Sherlock cut him off by pointing out something rather unarguable.
To John’s absolute devastation Sherlock knelt before him, slipped the fabric from around his waist, and swallowed him down. John’s head fell back and he choked on his breathe as the man’s tongue slid beneath his foreskin to tease the sensitive head. John was reduced to broken cries and pleas for permission. Sherlock continued to suck him, occasionally gripping his shaft as a mercy when he felt that John was too close. He worked him until John’s legs shook and he could focus on nothing but the feel of tongue, lips, and teeth. He’d lost control of his hands and was gripping Sherlock’s curls in both hands. The man allowed it, but only because he was as hungry for John as the doctor was for his captain.

“And prison,” Lestrade reminded.

“Anyone you know who will?”
“Force some water down his throat and leave him.”

John was getting steadily worse due to a wound on his shoulder, which was infected and they had no way to properly care for him. It had happened somewhere around the time of the missing papers in his journal according to how far along it was. They needed a doctor and urgently, but returning to land meant arrest. To top that off, they had to decide
His voice was so captivated, almost worshipful, his tone one of mystification and admiration. He almost sounded as if he were on the cusp of orgasm himself.
“I’m afraid not, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed, “Their pleas are useless without the object of your madness, and I’m afraid he refused to remain here to testify on your behalf.”
John’s eyes opened weakly and they all stared at him hopefully. He reached up to his neck and tugged at something shiny there. Sherlock helped him pull it free with his trembling fingers. It was a silver chain with three rings on it. John gripped the rings and weakly pulled at them, trying to break the chain. Sherlock helped him ease it open instead and John’s shaking hand fumbled with the ring, finally selecting one with tiny blue and green stones dotting a golden surface. It looked like the ocean at sunrise. John pressed it into Sherlock’s hands and gave him a weak smile before letting his eyes fall shut again. His breathing faltered, turning rasping, and Sherlock coaxed more fluids into his mouth. He drank it weakly but most dribbled down his chin.

eager to welcome you back.”
John’s footsteps grew dimmer and Sherlock sat in silence, breathing in the scent of blood in the air. He moved a foot and something warm and slick slid it across the floor. He wiggled his toes in it and recognized the substance as blood- copious amounts of blood.
The posh bastard’s name is Mycroft. He’s Sherlock’s brother. This explains Sherlock’s homicidal tendencies completely.
John shrugged in disinterest and shook his head. None of his clothes would work for the rough seas. A crewman stepped forward with an offer for trade and John turned over two spare shirts that he’d assumed he wouldn’t be keeping. He accepted the rough sailcloth clothes and slid them over his restored undergarments with a heavy sigh of relief. Trousers and a vest, letting his rings show as a portion of pride to his master. Sherlock smiled heatedly and stood up to observe his beloved.

and then tried to cover it up somehow. John stared down at the body now wrapped in a hammock and being slowly carried away. He’d basically poisoned a man for nearly a year and had gone out of his way to harm others. John felt any responsibility he might have had for his death vanish with the corpse into the murky sea.
“Which I don’t need
“Right, okay. Sure,” Greg folded his arms and tried to understand, but then shook his head, “No, explain it to me.”
“In the sick bay being
“We’re going to Tortuga,” Sherlock announced.
That didn’t happen because the other side of the pirate ship had been blown away in the first explosion, though John couldn’t see it from where he was. All that was left was the wall of his cell and the floor beneath him. When the attacking boat slipped away his prison plummeted sideways, and John found himself lying on his wall with the bars opposite it above him. John stared up at the sky. He’d never thought he’d see it again. He wasn’t even sure
“Admiral!” A voice called from the crow’s nest, “A boat is approaching Tortuga! It’s one of Heinason’s caravels!”
“Would you enjoy that?” John wondered.
John scrambled eagerly from the be and fled to Sherlock, kneeling on the floor at his feet. He lifted the dress and dove for the garter first, but Sherlock scolded him.
“He’s getting away!” John shouted, putting on a fake Dutch accent. He waved down several crewmen who bolted into his boat and immediately began hurriedly setting the sails. So busy were they that it took time for one to look at John’s face, and once he had John dispatched him quickly and silently, slitting his throat and shoving him overboard.
Dimmock answered that question by giving him a casual wave and heading off to dinner, leaving John to stare at an empty future he wanted no part in.
“No,” John replied softly, “You can’t. Then you’d be worse than Dr. Hope.”
“You don’t trust yourself to flog them?” John asked in confusion, “Why?”
“I never stopped being yours,” John professed easily, stepping forward and holding up his arm for Sherlock to take so they could walk together, “You were right, of course. I couldn’t bring myself to touch Mary and she was not the woman I thought I knew.”
ill so he could live off of him.”
“I’m a pimp,” John gestured to the women behind him, “Does that change your view of me?”
Let me try again.
“He’s living up in the woods,” The man stated, “I’ll send someone to fetch him. I suppose you’re interested in his… commerce?”

Sherlock opened the door and welcomed xem in, clearly having prepared for the occasion in advance. Sal had a box with xem and was quick to pull up Sherlock’s desk chair beside the bed. The box had little legs that folded out and xe set them up to sit beside xem. Xe wasn’t looking at John’s face and John wasn’t sure if he should be engaging xyr. He glanced at Sherlock to find he looked bored and had slouched down in John’s sex swing. He was pushing himself back and forth like a little girl and John gave him a light laugh.
“Mm, I’m a pirate now, that may change your view of me.”
I’m going to kill him.
Sherlock scoffed, “You misread me. I have no wish for
manage so large a ship on his own, but only by taking down the sails to let it drift during the few hours he let himself sleep during the day and sailing hard by night. He dared not let the sails fly by day. It was better it looked a ghost ship and risk being boarded than bombed from a distance due to the flags he flew. Yet those same flags might give him safe passage so long as he knew when to unfurl them. John kept a close eye out for Sherlock’s ships but he had no hope to find them. He did, however, know where Sherlock was heading. Without John to distract him he would go straight for Tortuga and defy his brother’s orders. His only choice was to get there as fast as possible and stop him from making a monster of himself.
Another boat slid by, this one also coated in metal armour, and he stared up at it curiously. He’d never seen a craft like that, but then he’d rarely been near the ocean until this mad voyage. As he stared up he saw faces staring down at him. He lifted a hand in one last effort to ask for help and someone jumped over the edge. John pushed himself weakly up on his elbows as water sloshed in due to the sudden addition of weight, drenching his clothes and soaking the feet of the man who now stood barefoot in his tiny, damp cell.
“You’re a lucky man,” John nodded, “The only ash that got in your eyes was already cool.”
“He just abandoned the ship

“Good, good,” Holmes murmured, “Let it out. Tell me more. How did you end up separated?”
“You, my handsome doctor, are going to scream my name by the time I’m done with you.”
“How so?” Sherlock asked, “You never exchanged a single word with him.”
“Which was that?” John asked, “Another piercing? A necklace? You have a fine neck, it should be adorned.”

“You’re

who wished to leave me. Apparently she knew what I had been too ashamed to admit, that the fairer sex had no sway over me.
“Come along, John,” Holmes soothed, putting a hand around his waist that John was too tired to shrug off.
The masses responded with derogatory sounds and Holmes rolled his eyes, “Sailors are buried at sea
Sherlock came out onto the deck, violin in hand, swaying with the ship and the music in a macabre dance as he sang in his cigar-and-whiskey-deep-voice. Lestrade gaped at him. It hadn’t had words last time he’d heard this song, and the lyrics only betrayed to him just how far gone their mad Admiral was. All around him the crew fell into sync with him as they often did when their Admiral played, but their expressions had changed to pre-John. All around him the men and women’s eyes were vacant, their eyebrows drawn, their lips pressed tight, their heads down. They were in survival mode and Lestrade wasn’t sure how many would survive despite his promise now that Sherlock was well and truly mad.
“Sorry mate,” Dimmock shrugged, “I’ve got someone.”
Rain. I stood in it and let it wash me, running my hands over my body and shaking with the cold. Sherlock would have loved to see this. He loved the sight of me vulnerable, and that I’m shaking with cold and my private parts have practically crawled inside of me would have driven him wild. He would have teased them, cupping them until they were warm enough to emerge and then exposing them to the chill to watch them flee. The thought of this aroused me until I was shivering and stroking myself off in the cold water. I was too frozen to climax, but it was a good feeling nonetheless. Sherlock would often leave me unfulfilled so that he could satisfy me later. It made me angry each and every time, but when he finally took me in hand or mouth I would come hard enough to scream, lights flashing behind my eyes and blood roaring in my ears. He was my London. My England. My entire world. How could I have been so blind to leave him?
Holmes rolled over dramatically, tossing an arm over his eyes and groaning as if he were the loneliest man on earth. John swallowed down his pang of remorse and stood up in a tiff.
“He was right,” Lestrade replied softly, “What will we do now? Run and lie? The people we ‘rescued’ and sent on their way believe they were fleeing a plague that we took advantage of, but there are those who will see through their tale.”
“This ship fights
” Holmes scoffed, “Don’t make yourself seem more useless than you already are.”
John had been backed into a corner during her speech and he swallowed hard as she stared down at him with fierce eyes and a look of revulsion on her face as if he’d put a bad taste in her mouth. She said the word
Sherlock’s eyebrows went up, “Not in the slightest, but the
“Yes. Off,” Sherlock frowned, staring around himself as he absorbed all the details of the men’s lives… or whatever it was Sherlock usually deduced, “You’ll be meting out punishments as you see fit from now on.”
Holmes knelt down and grasped his hair, pulling his head up until it hurt and John was forced to shut his eyes against the noonday sun. He leaned forward and whispered harshly into John’s ear.
. Now get do’n, shut up, and let us get dis over wit.”
and tell me you feel de same, starting wit dis freak here.”
Everything he’d been through. Everything he’d lost. Mary of the pale blonde hair who smelled like lemons from her use to keep her hair almost white. Lemons that smelled like happiness and summer and childhood.
“Very well,” Sherlock nodded, “Mannings! Signal
John tugged his arm free, missing the look of dismay on Holmes’ face, and staggered to the sickbay to collapse into the cot next to his smelly and snoring patient. He’d have to remember to give the fellow a bath the next day if at all possible. His sleep was dreamless, his body lax, but he woke stiff and anxious and it took him a moment to understand why.
“There are two cots.”
“I have none,” John replied miserably, “I need to get to Iceland. I need to get to Mary.”
John blinked a few times and took in the faces of the people around him. Where they had been calling for his whipping they were now looking at him with horror and pity. Apparently being Sherlock Holmes’ cabin boy was worse than being beaten with a bullwhip.
Archibald
Sherlock’s last words in John’s presence were softly spoken while stroking his hair, “He has family in Virginia. His parents and brother are there. Send him home with the contents of this box. He deserves to rest.”
“I was wrong about you,” Holmes purred, “You aren’t a doctor because your father was, you’re a doctor because pain
“It’s okay,” Holmes purred, stroking his hair, “That’s normal. You’re having mood swings from the stimulus. It will even out. You’ve made me

“Look, I’m just a bit weak from…”

“He what now?”
“I need to see my patient,” John stated firmly, “
The last step was the one Lestrade had talked him into. Using yellow and black paint he covered the well with four Yellow Jacks. All around the well in a circle he wrote a warning.
“So where do the chips come in?” John wondered carefully while he debated the horror of the story in his mind.
“This is a momentous occasion,” Sherlock told him, “I am so grateful to have you back, my love.”
“Sorry?” John asked, startled by his abruptness.

at the moment that doesn’t pay him until the end! He’s a rich man starving to death on a ship carrying his fortune!”
“Oh, that’s more like you, yeah,” Greg nodded.
“And within a few seconds of seeing you lying on that floating prison I knew you were a doctor who was chasing after a lost lover. I knew you’d left home seven months prior. I knew you were going to Iceland and had been captured a day before you reached it.”
I am a sodomite, and a privateer, and a doctor, and a killer. I am cold and unfeeling. I am warm and passionate. I am many things that my father would faint at hearing today. I can only now begin to contemplate the life that I have led and envision my future.
“Begging your pardon… sir… but may I ask how you came to captain a ship?”
“Yes sir,” Wilkes agreed.
that had just sliced through the one he’d been on as a hot knife slid through butter. He was now part of half of a boat that would plummet down into the waves as soon as the attacking boat propping it up slipped away.
“You’ll have plenty of chips by the end of today,” Holmes replied confidently, “I’ll deduct this from it.”
She demanded again.
“Anyway, he no longer trusts me to punish the men-“
“If it’s what I think it is, it’s not contagious,” John replied, “Mr. Wilkes, describe your diet to me.”
“I see,” John nodded, “Mind if I take a look at your legs?”
“I needed a way to make sure no one was punished for undue reasons,” Sherlock explained, “The chips are mathematical. Math can’t lie.”
Day 12
He squinted at his orders and the guard on the other side got disgusted enough to pull them from his hand and glance them over, “Holmes. He’s that way. Second on the left.”
Here's a clip from my favorite pirate movie:
During these times of restless silence I would have to guess at his needs. I made the mistake once of thinking sex was the solution. He took one look at my hand groping his crotch like a halfpenny whore and threw me out on my arse. Foolish man that I am to think another man could only be soothed by climax! Am I not a doctor? Do I not know that there are other things a man craves from a woman? Or in this case a man?
“Yes, but you might have simply restrained him, probably easily in these small quarters. Instead you sought out a weapon and attacked to kill, slicing his jugular. Nice bit of work, by the way.”
“It’s not that,” John worried, “It’s that I’ve been half starved and… look, I don’t know I’d last the night.”
“Do what?”
“I’ve won a debate,” Sherlock grinned.
“Goodness, no!” Sherlock laughed, “The healing time, and in the sun, no, no, no, no. Instead I must ask that we be joined by our dearest Cap’n Sal.”
John’s breath fluttered in his lungs. Holmes brushed his lips teasingly over John’s and then moved sideways to kiss along his jaw, his teeth teasing at his ear. John’s cock was hardening beneath the blanket and he clutched at it in fear and loathing.
They’re based in Tortuga. Magnus Heinason was a red herring. Even Moriarty doesn’t know. He’s involved in this as well but there’s another player, but they haven’t named him or her. Hopefully Sherlock DOES kill off most of the town or we’re in serious trouble. The end game is to raze the palace to the ground during a revolt and blame the people on it!
“Don’t be smart,” Mycroft frowned, “We both know why you want to go
Silence. They all looked confused, disgusted, frightened, and offended. Sherlock shrugged and gestured for John to rise.
“Useless considering you’re now taking up our only doctor’s time. I don’t even know if you’re a

was getting done and they were listing to port! Molly, AKA First Mate Hooper, was blowing shrilly on her whistle and trying to get everyone to pay attention. Greg joined her by shouting at them and even tried to tug on a few ropes himself before damage was done to the ship. He wasn’t successful and then he heard a loud shout ring up above the rest with a familiar deep voice behind it.
“Any of De Islands where mah people live?”
In response Holmes guided his hand to a rope pulled taught and tied to a ring beside the doorway.
“However, I
Sherlock gestured to the three women who hurried forward with light laughter and a parcel apiece. They found laps to sit in as well. John’s bag was thrown onto the boat. The boat was shoved to and John buried his nose in Sherlock’s curls as the familiar sway of water beneath wood left him heady with joy. He hummed lightly as he nuzzled Sherlock’s ear and held his lover’s waist tightly. His feet one forward and one back, his lover in his arms again, the scent of the sea as the spray soaked him through, and he was soon singing lightly as the men hoisted them aboard. When he made it to the deck he broke out into full song, one arm raised to greet his compatriots.
Lestrade checked the compass, the sun, and the men in the rigging. His hands never left the wheel when he was on the helm. He could leave it to others, but he preferred to be at the wheel. He had a good view here of the scuttle on most of the deck and half of the rigging. As such, he was aware that something odd was going on shortly before a man ran up the ladder to reach him.
“Good day,” Mycroft stated, squinting one eye and hoping his lack of makeup was enough of a disguise, “Sargeant McCain reporting. I’m here for the prisoner… er…”
,” Sherlock breathed.
“You didn’t know? Did he not tell you?”
“Nah, she thinks she’s a man! Literally believes it! She dresses her lower half like a man and the upper like a woman. Some say she’s got a willy, and I think it’s true. You should see the way her cabin boy walks after they’ve been going at it.”
“Sherlock, my Lord. My love. I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend. I am really, very sorry. Please, My Lord. Welcome me aboard again and I’ll be your slave, your toy, your willing servant until death takes me.”
Silence. And fear. Wide eyes all around the ship stared up at them as Lestrade watched the crew question their loyalty and safety with the man who was clearly losing his mind.
“There’s a philosopher by the name of John Locke. He has a theory that will be published soon, and I wish him well as he is one of the more tolerable people I have met. His theory goes along these lines:

John gave it an attempt but it didn’t come off well. A bit of more water and he managed to croak out his name.
DAY 3
“Keep dis covered,” Sal ordered, “And yes.”
“Land lubbers?”
“Those aren’t bruises. What is it?” Sherlock asked sharply, giving his other doctor an accusing glare, “Is it contagious?”
“Please,” John panted, worried about what he might do back there.

you. Have you ever been beaten before?”
“Iceland. Mary.”
Holmes’ eyes slid away and understanding dawned.
I feel like I’ve glossed over the part where Sherlock beats me senseless. That sounds awful. Let me try again. I feel like I’ve glossed over the part where Sherlock beats me until I come untouched while screaming his name and comparing him to God.
Then there was silence. The sound of the flogger striking his backside ended, the people below seemed to hold their breath. Holmes knelt down to give his cock a squeeze before tying him into his trousers once more. John couldn’t decide if he was grateful or horrified by the squeeze. Then he was helped up and everyone burst into loud cheers while John hung off of Holmes with his head spinning. His cock was fit to burst and his limbs felt useless. Sherlock waved his hand for silence and then shouted for Stevens, the fellow who John had been punished for, to be taken to the doctor on
“What debate would that be?”
“You have your body…”
The words were familiar enough to the crew that they soon joined him, wailing and moaning with the sea as they continued forward undaunted by weather or gods. The end of the song came about too early for Sherlock who had only scrubbed his flesh once, but he still sang it with his crew while letting the soap wash from his body in the lashing rivulets of rain.
“Huh?” Watson asked, not impressing him at all with his witty banter.
“The stables. To the right.”

“Ah, well,” Sherlock leaned back, taking away his blessed friction, “That rather changes things.”

“No.”
“Okay. So like every other ship out there?”
“Sherlock, that’s
. Even Hooper stepped in once when he was rampaging across the deck with the intent of beating a crewmember that had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. She threw her arms around his neck and hung onto him until his rage stopped, despite being drug partway across the ship while he snarled and tried to pry her off. In the end he finally stopped, dropped the riding crop onto the deck, wrapped his arms around her, and held her tightly for a moment with his head bowed down. When they finally eased apart Molly picked up his crop for him and handed it back. He slipped it into his belt and went to his room in silence. He stayed for nearly two days before coming back out with a tired look on his face.
Mycroft paled and then poured the water into his hand to study it. He could see nothing wrong, but he offered it to a nearby goat just in case. He then went about watering and brushing down their horses. He shuddered in horror when the goat dropped dead with an agonized bleat. Sherlock said nothing as Mycroft disposed of the supplies they’d brought with them. At least the little beast wasn’t going to gloat.
“Well, it’s just… I mean… if you were equals wouldn’t you have been… civilized when we landed?”
Holmes rolled him gently on to his side and pulled the laces on his trousers, freeing his aching cock. He let John collapse back on his front and then spread his legs and kneeled between them.
, my doctor,” Holmes replied, his voice rasping with desire as he sat back to meet John’s eyes, “I’ve never met someone who liked it before despite spending the last twelve years of my life around privateers and pirates. You’re someone who stands up to me without fear. You always seem to know right from wrong… you make me
“Well, that’s something you don’t see every day. Since when has Heinason started taking prisoners? And since when does a prison
“Americas!” The crew echoed heartily.
“I’m behind you,” Lestrade told him firmly.
“Then you’ll wait a few days.”
Mycroft rapped on the bar, “Up, you dog! Time to swing.”
Holmes sighed and backed away, “There are britches in the drawer beneath the bed.”
“Mind your tongue!” Sherlock shouted at them.
“You pick a watch yet?”
“We’ll see how closely you’re behind me when I’m headed for the gallows.”
That was where John’s luck ran out, because the four other men who had been in the process of casting off after Mary now froze. John’s movements may have been slick, but the boat was only 60 feet long. It was easy to draw people’s eyes away from his face, but not away from having just killed a man right in front of them.
Lestrade studied the pink wax around the bottle’s cork that had kept it from drenching into the letter. He broke it open, pulled the cork with his hip knife, and spent a good ten minutes grumbling as he tried to get the letter out. Inside was a sketch of their former cook- Moriarty himself- but something had smeared one side of his face. Lestrade turned it over after swearing to himself and narrowed his eyes at the words on the back.
up there.
“Must make room,” Sherlock flirted.
. All that was left was to silence Mary and get out quickly and easily. He decided to get a bit of revenge on her so he stripped her of her clothes, tied, and gagged her. Then he donned the dress from the closet that had made him think such naughty thoughts. It didn’t tie in the back, but it was enough to make him look like a woman with a bit of scarf tied over his head.
“-Because he
“Don’t think I didn’t see the way you reacted when our faces dragged together. You
“You’re rather good at that,” Holmes replied with a grin, “You must stroke yourself off frequently.”
“Because I didn’t take a beating from him just so you could have him disposed of on another ship!” John snapped.
“What are you going on about?” Sherlock asked, eyes narrowed angrily.
“Yer welcome… cattle prod.”
Yet I have made a grievous error. Some days ago- I’ve lost count, which is why I’ve started this journal- I abandoned my Lord, Admiral, and beloved in order to finish my pursuit of Mary Of the Lemon Scent, only to find that she was Mary the Unfaithful. I would have forgiven that, but she could not forgive me my own indiscretions. I regret it not at all. Though I am sorry for the loss of my childhood friend, she was quite right in her assumptions. I could never have loved her wholly. It would have been a lie. My love wears dark curls not white. He stands tall, not crushed beneath a corset. He has a firm spear rather than a soft… whatever the hell women have. I have a working knowledge of them but no interest. That is midwife territory.
“My knees started to hurt something fierce and after I climbed the rigging or swabbed the deck I’d barely be able to breathe.”
They moved in that direction and once they were hidden amongst the scent of horse and hay Mycroft removed his bonds. He led his younger brother over to the horse he intended to steal and helped him mount it without bothering with tack. Speed was important. Besides, they both knew how to ride bareback as easily as with a saddle. Mycroft led Sherlock’s horse out of the stall and grabbed their supplies, tossing the rucksack over his shoulder. He handed Sherlock a cloak which the man threw over his shoulder and pulling up the cowl to hide his face. Mycroft then mounted his own horse and spurred his horse on ahead of Sherlock’s. Sherlock let Mycroft lead them out of the gates with only a single call for identification before they were facing freedom.
“I’m asking
,” The man grinned, “I’m Lestrade, captain for practical purposes, but nobody calls me that. Can you speak?”
The men gathered behind the leaders made various sounds of fear and shock, several took steps back, and the four town leaders took on expressions varying from consternation to horror. The consternation came from the priest.
A harsh hand awaked John by shaking his arm violently. He jolted awake and stared blearily up at Holmes and the crewmember who had taken his chip from him.
John lay cold and shaking, the chain around his ankle had long ago chaffed his skin to the point of agony. His stomach had stopped protesting the lack of sustenance and decided rest would be best to save its energy for when it was needed again.

John shivered, “Will you brand me with it?”
“They’re paid at the end of the voyage! There’s no reason for this lunacy! Just let them do their duties and flog them if they don’t!” John ranted.
“Nothing,” John replied, blinking in confusion, “I’ve never heard of him before.”
“Let me tell you. I speak tree languages! Tree! How many you speak?”
“Hmm, perhaps,” Sherlock mused, “At least now that we are certain what we are dealing with we have a way to treat him. He’ll take a while to recover, and he is still in danger of going into shock, but I think he’ll pull through.”
“I don’t make
,” Holmes chuckled, “How quant!”
. He wasn’t the sort of bloke who was turned on by a glimpse of ankle or a coy smile. So I fetched a bit of rope, put it around my neck like a collar and leash, and walked up to him where he was giving poor Trevor a talking to. I simply waited until his hand went out in a gesture and tossed the rope across his wrist. He froze. He just stared at the rope swinging as it lay across his arm like a frightened snake. ‘You have the helm,’ he says to no one in particular. Then he grabs the leash and tugs me down towards our cabin. We didn’t make it there. He pinned me up against the wall, tugged both our trousers and hose down, and rubbed himself off against my hip. Turns out he needed to get off
Holmes snorted awake and then sat up, giving him a miserable look.
The sky chose that moment to open up on them, rain crashing down. Sherlock was unflustered though his brother sputtered and fled for the inner parts of the ship. Instead he stripped off his soiled and filthy clothing, casting them overboard and raising his voice to challenge the thunder that shook the ship.
,’ Sherlock purred, ‘Perhaps your mouth…?’
“Can I bunk with you?” John asked Dimmock in desperation.
He’s forced me to stay at the palace.
“To the Americas!” Sherlock shouted.
, yes. And no casualties on our part at all.”
“England?” Sherlock wondered, glancing around them, “Ah, England. Yes. Well, last I heard the king was in terrible trouble and I was terminated.”
Mycroft sighed, looking much put upon as he rolled his eyes. He turned and headed for the door, stopping with his hand in the air, poised to knock for the guard.
“Nothing is unsinkable.”
“You should see your arse,” Holmes growled, “The red stripes. Some of them are

“We’ll make a sailor out of him yet,” John chuckled, “Perhaps we can find him something to study on an island somewhere. A fantastic discovery will make him stop whinging.”
engage in battle if people board us. Run.”
John swallowed, his cock making a confusing attempt to retract and swell at the same time. He made a rather embarrassing squeaking sound and fumbled for the latch to the door.
“I…” John started, but was too tired to argue.
“So, Sal,” John drawled as xe prepared a large needle with a block of wood at the top, “Will you tell me how you came here yet?”
“As if I’d ever kill
John hadn’t gone in with a plan to loot the place of treasure but he
Sherlock had a bit of rouge on his lips and cheeks, just enough to contrast his sun-kissed skin. He looked radiant and beautiful with his touseled curls.
“Run drills to keep them in shape,” Sherlock replied, “We’ll be having them practice taking over each other’s ships.”
. If I don’t give them a battle to keep them sharp- a daily battle- than they will sink before this vessel reaches it’s next target and I will be crewless. As brilliant as I am, and as wondrous as these ships are, I can hardly sail all three back to England alone.”
“Which you don’t need.”
kind of power. I only wish for a challenge and you.”
“I like pirates,” He explained with a shrug, apparently understanding John despite his vagueness.
“You mentioned a brother the other day. That he was trying to keep you away from people due to some… impulses you have.”
“No I’m

Day 6
“They know the risks,” Holmes replied, and didn’t elaborate further.
“Come along doctor!” Sherlock shouted, unable to keep his amusement out of his voice, “You have a patient to see!”
“At least let me nurse him back to health first! If he can survive the punishment…”
“But I won’t
“Yours,” John admitted, “I wept after. Take me with you into Hades next time.”
Cap’n Donovan gave him an approving look and Holmes considered this for a moment and then nodded acceptance, “Well, it works for religion. Very well. One hundred five lashings for Dr. Watson.”
“Is that her name?” Holmes asked.
“I already know where Moriarty is,” Sherlock replied scathingly, “Fool!”

Caribbean, George.”
“No,” Sherlock replied, disgusted at him for asking for so much, “You may sleep on my floor. This cabin is warm and dry. That rug there will serve you for the night. I suggest you make due. Take this slip to the galley and get yourself a free meal. Make sure you don’t upset the cook.”
“No,” Holmes laughed, “I wish it had been something as vicious as mutiny. No, they were all amused by the genius child captain and alternated between placating me and obeying me. It was the former I took offense to and decided I must put to an end. One particular sailor had a son my age. He doted on me, petted my hair, and offered me candy whenever he managed to get some from a port. It disgusted me. One day he did it in front of several crewmen and they
John’s eyes widened, “You don’t mean…”
DAY 2
Sherlock slid off completely with a pop and John keened in longing as his balls tightened once again.
Lestrade locked the wheel and put his hand out, “What on earth? Why? You’re stranded somewhere than the bottle is more valuable than the letter that will probably never get anywhere. He could have put rainwater in here! Or better yet, fermented fruit!”
Having made his point Sherlock turned back to his maps, mentally dismissing the shocked doctor behind him.
let alone information.”
“Follow my finger,” John ordered, and watched the eyes effortlessly track his digit, “Any blurriness? Burning? Absent spots?”
John waited. Xe was pouring dark Indian ink into the well of a wooden bowl. The needle was split on one side like a quill and made of a substance he couldn’t identify. Perhaps bone or a wood he had not yet come across. Xe dipped the tip in ink and held up a mallot and gave him a challenging glance. John turned to lay flat on his belly.
cabin boy,
“This is a crew of entirely men,” Sherlock snorted, “You think we go without the touch of another for three years straight? Why do you think so many don’t have hammocks? They didn’t lose them, they traded them for necessities when having two hammocks between two men became unnecessary.”
the reason Sherlock’s gone mad! Apparently he gets to decide that because he’s spent an unusually enormous amount of time with his nose deep inside the King’s arsecrack.
“You only saw him for a few seconds…”
He had to snap the cane across my backside to stop me thrashing and ruining his ‘painting’. He was quite cross, but not nearly as outraged as I was. I cursed until I ran out of air and then stayed still long enough for Cap’n Sal to paint my likeness for him. When I was finally shown the painting I had to admit that the play of red from scratches and black from ink creating a strange pattern across my back was quite fetching. I told him I’d never forgive him for his trick, but I’m sure he knew I didn’t mean it. At least I hope so.
“You evar been to Africa?”
“North?” Lestrade asked in confusion.
“Where are you going?” Holmes asked in apparent surprise.
“I just…” He stammered when Holmes stood up, his myriad eyes taking on the hue of storm clouds. John backed away until he had no more room to go and pressed against the wall, “I have to piss.”
“No.”
Someone snickered behind Sherlock so he holstered a gun, pulled out his riding crop, and swung behind him to smack the man sharply. The Reverend had pulled back and indicated to the group behind him one should run to the woods and fetch John.
John worked his way down, keeping a hand on his hostage. When he got to the kitchens he slipped into them and snatched up all the cooking oil he could find. He took it out saturated the kitchen and hall floor with it, dumping lamp oil on top of it until the room reeked of it. The next step was to empty some stolen gunpowder into a pile in the centre of the hallway. He headed for the doorway and pulled out his gun, took aim, and fired a shot into the powder. Sparks flew and the entire first floor of the lighthouse lit up like a kiln. John shoved Mary out the door first, tugging out her gag and using her as a shield. She screamed and the men outside pulled their guns up to avoid shooting the gravid woman. John continued to plow through them, shouting instructions about putting out the fire as he used the confusion to distract them from his true purpose. With a naked woman in the lead, and what looked like a rich one following after shouting about a fire, John wasn’t surprised that no one took notice of the fact he was a man. They were all scrambling to pry their eyes off of Mary’s tits and refocus them putting out the blaze. Something in the kitchen took that moment to explode and John chuckled as everyone was completely redirected to dealing with the problem at hand.
They didn’t have to know he was left-handed and the sword was currently in his less agile hand. They clearly didn’t need to know much of anything else at all. One jumped overboard and the others stared at him anxiously. John changed his bloodied dagger for his pistol and grinned.
Sherlock came around me and lifted my head, his motions so careful so as not to muss up the mess he’d left of the flesh on my back. He pressed his cock into me and a few slow thrusts against my scream-raw throat had him spilling himself. He sobbed out his release, something that I had never heard. I was mystified. Alarmed. Overwhelmed. In love.
“Fine!” Sherlock threw up his arms and then sat down to read over the book in front of him.
The rest of John’s day went much the same. He tried to find something he could do to earn blankets for the night- it was dreadfully cold at night lately- and perhaps a hammock, but he was getting nowhere fast. He learned a great deal, as everyone was eager to spell things out for the ‘dead weight’ they’d just inherited. John was quick to tell them that he was a doctor and would be patching them up soon, but they only laughed at him until he stopped mentioning it. Finally Dimmock took pity on him and explained their amusement.
“What of you? You
John had rather expected his reputation to be destroyed by his attempt to get Mary back, but since no one knew what had truly happened he returned sickly and embarrassed. His father nursed him back to health without comment. His mother asked him what happened once he was able to sit up and eat on his own. John wasn’t ready to face it. He broke down and wept, his mother sat on the edge of his bed and wrapped him up in her arms as if he were a child again. John cried himself out over the next few days. He mourned his lost future. He mourned the love he’d left behind. He mourned Sherlock himself, because in all likelihood his captain was dead.
“No.”
“What is your obsession with this man?!” Mycroft exclaimed.
“I need to see the fellow I took a
He released John’s head and it fell forward, his eyes flying open as rage overwhelmed him and he started struggling in his bonds, his legs kicking out and scrabbling against the deck.
John thought over what he knew of the ship and other ships out there performing similar tasks. As far as he was aware, Holmes’ ships had the lowest amount of casualties of any seafaring vessel outside of merchant ships. They only engaged in hand to hand when necessary and there had been few injuries or sicknesses beyond the norm even before Dr. Hope was taken on; Holmes’ methods
ring later, stringing them on a simple chain and putting it around his neck. That was when he saw the shaving kit. He made quick use of it and then stored it in with the rest of his belongings. Sherlock might like a clean shaven face from time to time. He dragged Mary back out after checking to make sure the coast was clear.
“What if it has Heinason on it?” Lestrade asked, “We could use him to find out where Moriarty is.”
Williamson
“Unsinkable.”
“Moriarty,” Holmes snapped angrily.
, Greg! I felt
An hour later they heard the haunting tone of his violin and Lestrade shuddered in fear. Sherlock had only played cheerful tunes around John, or if they were sad than they were the pieces that he used to help his thinking process. This, however, was a piece that Sherlock had written two years ago when he’d first conceived of his horrific idea of poisoning the water supplies of islands that supported pirates. He’d originally wanted to enact his plan on Skansin, cutting out Moriarty’s right hand man Magnus Heinason, however since John had appeared he’d altered the plan to be Tortuga instead. Lestrade knew the reason, but it had been forbidden to discuss any plans- past or future- about Skansin. Mycroft had originally
“Lo mate,” John started out, “I’m looking to help out in the kitch-er-galley.”
with their worldly possessions. Though he lost the right to his hammock months ago, I allow them back for burial.”
“I have no idea! That’s why it’s so utterly fascinating!”
“Bless you, you’re trying to protect him,” Sherlock lowered his weapon and gave the man an amused smile, “Yes, John Watson.”
“I’ll never leave you again.”
, but at great loss to the other side. John recalled a veiled accusation Dimmock had made while he was in too much pain to ask questions.
To explain, I’ve been practicing escaping- more for fun and study than because I actually think I can get out- and it turns out that I
John spent the rest of the day running errands for Holmes after having Mr. Wilkes transferred over to his own sickbay and providing him with a treatment. Holmes’ requests were usually innocuous; ranging from ‘fetch me this’ to the dreaded task of adjusting the contents of each persons debt bag. John felt sick about the latter, but it also gave him a chance to see where everyone was at and find out if anyone else was sick. There were only two people on
John laughed at the nickname and the room fell to silence as John lay waiting for Sherlock to approach.
Then he had me kneel for him and suck him off while he fucked my face. I was so proud when we were through because I’d managed to relax my throat enough to let him thoroughly take me. He was so wrecked after he came that he just sank down and I had to break position and pull him in to straddle my thighs. He wrapped his arms around me so tightly and laid his head on my chest. I stayed that way long after my feet had fallen asleep, just holding him and breathing in his scent. My erection wilted and I can’t recall but I think I went without that night. Whichever it was, just holding him against me was so perfect and beautiful that my throat feels tight just thinking of it. I miss my lord.
“I’ll get better and…”
. Not civilized? We too damn busy surviving animals dat would make you piss ya pretty stockings to build
Sherlock signalled and a cannon fired into brine, splashing those on the shore while Sherlock laughed at the flying sand and water. The messenger was a young man who nearly fell in his haste to flee towards the woods. Sherlock meandered back and forth on the dock, ignoring attempts to engage him in conversation as he balanced on the very last board on the edge. Their arguments were pointless. John was his goal and endgame.
John had to admit he had not. The stove had suspended metal baskets that twisted and shifted to hold the pot over the flames without the contents spilling. The space was tiny and included a trundle bed hidden beneath the outer counter where the cook slept.
“Thank you,” Watson replied miserably, though he didn’t sound it.
“Her own ship.”
John shook his head in amazement, “You figured all that out when exactly?”
I was so turned on by his words that I throbbed for nearly an hour, even while working on deck to clean things up just to keep busy. I was starting to wonder if it
Holmes’ eyebrows drew down and he gave John a suspicious look, “You answered that too fast. So it was something. Were you in my bed?”
Sherlock stood slowly, slipping his sword free, “I thought I was as well, but as it turns out I am far from being one of them. Lestrade, find a way to transport John. He will die at home, in my cabin. Not on this filthy blot on the map.”
, his mind supplied, and also the female captain who pretended to be a man judging by the bulge in the front of her britches that was clearly created with a padded codpiece. What no one had mentioned was the pattern of tattoos on her skin, darker even than her flesh and menacing even in the light of day. Perhaps that was accentuated by the looks on people’s faces that made this seem more like a funeral than a punishment. Perhaps it was.
for liking hitting them. I had to make sure I didn’t look for excuses to do it. Now I don’t have to worry about any of that anymore.”
“I can’t sing and I don’t know any stories.”
. He recalled the food he’d stashed and sat down at a table to munch on it while considering his plight. If he could get more pay chips he’d be able to avoid the Admiral again, but he was still recovering and the mopping he’d done had worn him out. It was warmer during the day so he considered just sleeping in the corner until nightfall and then trying to find work then. That sounded the most intelligent, so he headed to the corner where a faded set of rugs had been thrown down as a sign of mercy for those doomed to sleep on the floor. John pressed himself into a corner and dropped off almost instantly.
Rather affronted, I protested that I could hardly have been expected to know that, having nothing to go on but the man's address and his trade.
Holmes said mildly, "I thought you would appreciate an update on my search for your valuable cameos."
We were obliged to remain in Scotland in order to testify at the trial, and by the time we finally set foot in Baker Street, it was over a week since we had first left.
From his manner, I was quite sure that he was already beginning to see his way clearly through the murky fog of facts, but try as I might, I could not yet follow in his footsteps.
I folded my arms and frowned down at him. "Holmes, if you have any theories about who they were, and what precisely they wanted, then I should like to hear them."
"And the lock has never been changed?"
"I don't know the Lyndales at all, besides seeing them in the congregation at Mass at the friary. With the exception of the younger daughter Miss Georgiana, that is. She takes an interest in our work here and has occasionally spoken with me about it."
"I prefer to stay," I said firmly.
"Hush, love." He smoothed back the hair from my cold, sweating forehead. "I don't think it's as bad as it feels."
"Mrs Spencer and I spent most of the evening on the sofa in the salon," Mrs Tyndrum said. "I'm sure we would have noticed anyone opening the cabinet."
"I did?" Without further ado, I ripped open the envelope and looked at the foot of the letter. "I say! It's from Alistair Gordon."
I rose to my feet, and lit a candle at the gas lamp to take to my bed, while Holmes banked the fire for the night.
I dropped the marmalade spoon with a clatter.
"Wyndmire Close is not far from the Castle; it connects Grindlay Street and Spittal Street," I said helpfully.
"Not really, no. By the time I was old enough to hold a full-size violin, hers had been sold off along with the piano and the rest of the house." He flagged down a cab. "Back to Baker Street, shall we?"
"If you care about justice, Mrs Smith, will you tell me about it?"
So for what reason was he blackmailing Lyndale? Holmes was looking thoughtful, and I did not want to interrupt him.
"And London's Catholics are not particularly numerous, and surely as gossip-prone as any other group. I'm sure I can learn something from him about a family as prominent in society as the Lyndales."
He disappeared again, as abruptly as he'd come. Upon reflection I was relieved to be left alone, and thus spared the awkwardness of dressing in front of him—even if it were something I'd often done before without a second's thought.
"I'm so glad to see you're awake, sir," she cried, with surprising emphasis. "I'm so terribly, terribly sorry about what happened."
I wondered whether Holmes would say he wished to interview each member of the family in private, as he sometimes did, but after a few minutes' conversation with young Lyndale and Huntington, he turned to the cabinet and bent to examine the lock.
“I made sure that dreadful scent of lemons was gone. Come and give us a whiff.”
“Spare me the theatrics,” The cook replied, glaring at Lestrade, “I’m hardly going anywhere, now am I? Even
“Wh-what?”
?” Lestrade asked, glaring at Moriarty.
“Yes. Terminated. You know, discharged. Sacked. Dismissed. Our arrangement was annulled and otherwise discontinued. In other words,” Sherlock removed both pistols from their sheaths, “I am no longer a privateer and my career as a pirate has been rather dull so far.”
The man we were pursuing did not seem to be in good physical shape and we soon caught up to him. I tackled him to the ground, and Holmes pinioned his hands to the cobblestones, relieving him of the folder at the same time—for all that it contained nothing but blank sheets of paper.
The list of people present in the house the previous night had been drawn up as requested. It began with Lyndale himself, his daughters, son and son-in-law, and two guests of the family, a Mr William Huntington and a Mrs Catherine Tyndrum. Also invited had been two Franciscans and Monsignor Pinet, four members of the Winston family, and a couple, Mr and Mrs Armstrong. The household's complement of servants consisted of a butler, a footman, a cook, a parlourmaid, two maids-of-all-work, and additionally the cook's niece, who apparently came in to lend a hand on such occasions. The Lyndale townhouse was on the large side: they were clearly extremely wealthy.
"You don't know the Lyndale family well?"
I was simply glad to know that he had managed to find some kind of equilibrium in his mind over the past week, and that his ever-present paranoia would not spell the end of the happiest period in both our lives. I hastened to reassure him that the overture of peace was heartily accepted.
"They weren't to your taste?"
I myself was not ready to dismiss the trauma of family estrangements so easily. I had seen my fair share of it, culminating when my brother was expelled from the University of Edinburgh for drunkenness beyond the usual limits, quarrelling and theft. Our father had not spoken to him until the day of his own death, and my only consolation had been that my mother had not lived to see the scandal.
Holmes remained silent for the first part of our coach journey back to Edinburgh, although his gaze returned often to rest upon me. His face was less tense than earlier in the day, its sharp lines softened. After some time he spoke up:
If he expected Holmes or me to exclaim in amazement, he was disappointed. Instead, Holmes murmured, "What a coincidence that the theft should occur precisely on the night when someone was present who could instantly detect it."
He put his hands in his pockets and frowned at me.
"Do you suspect Garner?" I asked.
I had not seen the Gordons in almost a decade, but somehow it seemed indecent to dawdle too long over tea while the dead man still lay unidentified and unclaimed in the Royal Infirmary's morgue. Holmes, too, was clearly impatient to make a start. As soon as I judged that Gordon would be satisfied we were sufficiently rested from our supposedly harrowing journey, I suggested a visit to the scene of the gruesome discovery.
He did not look up from his work of methodically opening his correspondence and sorting it into piles. "Primarily to you, my dear fellow, as you will find when you open it."
While Pinet exclaimed and protested that nothing could have been further from his mind, Holmes said calmly, "It would be helpful to know whom you yourself suspect, Mr Lyndale."
He paused, but Holmes said nothing. I knew it would take more than that to interest Holmes, and Mr Lyndale seemed to sense the same thing, for he went on:
"Yes," Holmes continued. "The Monsignor confirms that he told Father Garner of his interest in cameos upon his arrival in London, several days before the party where the theft took place. I think we may assume that Garner had mentioned this casually to Lyndale, thereby allowing Lyndale to construct his elaborate plot."
I knew Holmes was thinking of the scratch marks that, on a newer lock, could have indicated that it had been picked. This lock was so old and scratched that surely even he could not deduce anything from it.
"They irritated me, those two," he said shortly. "Indulging in one of those noble, platonic affairs which make me extremely impatient."
My father had seemed pleased, after his own fashion, to see me take an interest in zoology and botany. I was sorry he had not lived to see me become a doctor. I did not do it for him, of course, but he would have taken a great deal of vicarious pride in it nonetheless.
I had no answer to give to that, so I stayed silent, my stomach turning over inside me.
I shot him a dark look.
I did not voice the thought aloud, however, because I wanted to do nothing but sleep, and I didn't know how to convey that without risk of misinterpretation.
Smith burst out, "I say! That's none of your business."
I woke the following morning to the sound of Holmes humming to himself. He was sitting up in bed, leafing through one of the scrapbooks he kept in a pile on his dresser. He had twitched open the curtains on the window by his bed, to let in just enough light for him to read by. Through the gap I could see blue sky, and the upper branches of the plane tree out in the yard.
Holmes leant forward, his voice and posture urgent. "It's not just a matter of insurance fraud, you know. Three innocent men were seriously injured in those warehouse fires. Livelihoods were ruined."
Her interlocutor had raised his voice now too. "Don't you cross me, my girl. Remember, you have another life to protect. Remember your dear - "
"Not if I grow rich first," I said.
Father Briggs shook his head in apology. "You're out of luck, I'm afraid, gentlemen. I do know Joshua Wilcott—he'd been working here as an odd-jobman one or two days a week—but he was arrested just ten days ago."
“He says he can go on,” Holmes stated as he stood.
Sherlock laughed as he held him tightly, “You call me your Lord again, then?”
“You’re here for the witch?” The priest stated.
“Fall?!” Sherlock laughed at her, “I’ve already fallen! Look how I’ve grown wings and flown free! My ignorant brother with his fat riches can’t hold me back now!”
“Why does it matter?” Holmes asked.
John was fairly certain that he slept for nearly a day in the sickbay. He woke up disoriented and achy, his back, arse, and thighs having scabbed over after Holmes had properly cleaned him up (rum being a poor substitute for actual soap and water). His bladder was full to the point of exploding so he staggered upright and hurried to the door to sickbay to bolt topside and piss over the rails. Problem was pissing wasn’t all he had to do and he wasn’t relishing the idea of shitting over the side of the boat.
“It feels like ages,” John groaned, rubbing at his face, “Where are my clothes?”
realized how public their conversation was. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and waited for an apology. John squared his shoulders and raised his chin in obvious denial of that expectation. Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth tug upwards slowly and three people behind John backed up several paces.
As he was often want, Sherlock changed gears so quickly that John was left bereft. The man pulled away, did up his flies, and turned to the matter of sorting possessions.
When I descended to the sitting room a few hours later, Holmes was curled up in his armchair, a book lying abandoned in his lap. He had obviously intended to read, but been overcome by sleep.
.. .. .. .. .. ..
“It’s very easy to be morally upstanding when you haven’t got the
“Mary who?”
“We’re not going on that cursed place!” One man shouted, “We’ll be slaughtered by the ghosts of those poor people!”
. John packed up what little he owned, collected an inheritance/fee from his father despite the man’s protests, and left with a sack full of his possessions and a firm stance. He walked into an unclaimed portion of the woods, chopped down a few trees with a borrowed axe, and began to build.
“Pirates,” John groaned miserably.
The other doctor was sweating and looking panicked so John hurried to reassure them.
Molly saluted her husband and then marched out of the cabin to ring the duty bell. The crew thought their First Mate was a partial mute so she communicated with flags, hand signs, and a chalkboard. He’d even seen her get creative one day and use a flageolet to make disapproving sounds at a crewman who wasn’t working fast enough. None of them knew she was a woman. That was for two reasons, the first being that she was on the run from her drunkard father who had tried to sell her off to pay off his gamboling debts; the second was because most of the men on this ship were the superstitious type and had already opted not to be on the ship with either the female captain or the mad captain.
John opened his mouth fully and suckled on the damp cloth like a baby, whimpering as his tongue seemed to absorb every drop before it could reach his throat. The rag was tugged out of his weak grip with his teeth and rewetted to be pressed back against his chapped lips. John suckled it again, letting the fluids revitalize him until opening his eyes sounded like a viable option.
John took the green chip the Admiral handed him, relieved it
“I was mad.”
“Our cook is…”
He was dressed in a deep purple justacorps with lavish decoration, the frills of his shirt peaking out at the sleeves. His caravate countered that by being more practical while still appearing posh. He wore tight breeches with no stockings and his feet were bare. Around his waist a tooled leather belt held his sword and a horn. His hair was unfashionably loose and wild, his pale eyes flashing as he stared down at John.
Then it hit me. Sherlock wasn’t
my share.”
The man opened the latch and tossed the token back inside while John fumed and despaired. Then he marched off and rang the bell. The next watch was on and in the rush of turnover John was unobserved. He hesitated a moment and then snatched the chip back up again. He headed down to the mess with his chip tight in his hand and dropped it in the sack hanging beneath the slate with his name marked on it. Then he did a double take. His debt was gone. All of the red chips were missing from his bag and the notes that were beneath his name on the slate- reasons and exceptions- had been erased. It couldn’t be a mistake. No one would dare mess with anyone’s chart; a notice was painted above detailing the floggings they’d receive. A mistake? The slate was clearly marked with a ‘+’ but there was no reason listed unless…
; John found himself horrified with that comparison. He nodded his understanding and the woman (person?) stepped out of his space with her chin raised proudly.
“And you think this is the easiest job on the ship?” The ships cook scoffed, “Look at this stove. You ever seen anything like it?”
“Are you mad?” Mycroft scoffed, “That’s foul!”
The man folded up the missive and stuck it inside his jacket, and Mycroft continued down the steps into the lower levels. The smell was foul and the layer of rushes and straw did little to lessen it. If anything it just added a mouldy layer to the atmosphere. Sherlock was curled up on a mat staring off at the far wall with a look of miserable acceptance on his face. His hanging was in less than three hours.
“You. On your knees. Begging me to beat you again,” Holmes purred.
. There were three ships. Only two had been mentioned to him so far,
“I’m a doctor,” John tried, “I’m…”
“It’s got a piece of paper in it,” The man replied, looking anxious.
“Yes, but if I was gone to you, what did you think of? Picture? Whose voice called your name? What scent teased your nostrils?”

I’ve begun to hallucinate. I swear I saw a beautiful woman standing naked on the bow of my ship with only a man’s smoking jacket around her fair torso, but that is utter madness. My hands shake. I believe that I’ve been heading towards Haiti with a favourable wind, but now I’m uncertain. It must be the water. At least I’ve caught fish to eat but aside from one rainstorm that blessed me with fresh water for a few days I’ve been trying to boil the salt water and drink it. I’m to the point I can’t taste salt anymore. My eyes blur and I pissed brown yesterday.
