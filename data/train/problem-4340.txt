So now he knows what it is. But he can’t take it. And he can’t ask for it. And he can’t stop thinking about it.
“The stove, it’s just,” Dean sighs fitfully. “It’s really dirty.” Inexplicably, it feels like he’s said too much and Dean shuts his mouth before some sad, pathetic noise escapes from it.
“Your, uh,” Cas shifts in his lap, which uh-oh hey there, like he’s nervous or something, fidgeting with Dean’s buttons. Which is hilarious for someone who’s razed armies to the ground and sung with heavenly hosts and all that. “Your Zeppelin t-shirt. Hole in one of the arm pits. Faded. Very soft,” He glances at Dean. “Really, quite soft. Probably the softest shirt you own. I think I’ve felt all of them, but that one is definitely. Has to be the softest one,” He nods to himself and flattens his hand out on Dean’s chest.
.” The detective replied, and the three of them looked between each other.
"I figured it was worth a try." Dean got back into the car, starting it instantly, barely giving Sam a chance to get back in the seat. He pulled the car out and started driving again, faster than before. "Why didn't we give him a phone?"
Dean knows what it would feel like if he reached over, put Cas’s arm around his shoulders. He knows how heavy Cas’s head against his chest would be. He knows and craves the currents that zap through him at any point of contact Cas deigns to make. It’s almost enough to drive him forward, to say fuck it and fall into it.
Popcorn. Cas still hasn’t picked a movie, but it always takes Cas a long ass time to pick. He watches the trailers and gets distracted. The microwave beeps and Dean turns to it, pours the popcorn out into bowls. He pauses. He combines it into one large bowl.
He watches as Cas stands in front of a column of shelves, tilting his head to read the titles. It makes him feel a little guilty, suddenly. He puts it on the list of things to work on.
“Cas, I’ll stay. I’m staying,” Cas looks up. Dean brings his own hand up to hold Cas’s face. “I don’t want to feel like I can’t have this, but I do. I can’t feel good like this with you without, without remembering all the reasons I shouldn’t. But making you feel...like this,” He swallows. “I want this, I want this with you. I want it more than I’m scared of it. It’s just, certain parts of it are harder than others. But if I can make you,” Dean presses his lips together. “Happy. I will. That’s what I want, Cas.”
He doesn’t know how, but he has. They finish two more hunts, come home and decompress between them. Have a few movie nights, finish the popcorn. Go out to get more popcorn. Sam goes on another few dates with Eileen, she stays over a couple times. They drink together, play a few games of cards. And Cas stays at least 3 feet away from Dean at all times.
And what was once an unfathomable existence, following a train of orders and missions, became a life. Limited and uncertain, but full of meaning and love.
“I know you prefer more of a rare steak, but I like it a little more well done --” Cas tries to pull Dean back down.
Sam isn’t with them that night, out to eat with Eileen again. Dean imagines taking Cas out to eat somewhere. That’s another thing he would have to ask Cas to do, to ask Cas to do for him. He imagines himself spilling water all over himself and having to go home early. Much more likely.
“Wasn’t sleeping,” The rasp in Cas’s voice suggests otherwise and Dean looks over to him. “Well, not -- I drifted off for a few minutes, I guess. But I was reading.” Dean hands him his water. He takes a long drink. Dean watches the line of his throat as he does, suddenly feeling like he’s allowed. It’s warm in the kitchen and silent save for the sound of Cas gulping down his water. The water that escapes the glass drips down Cas’s chin and neck.
“Oh, then that’s gotta be it, Temple of Doom is a classic. One of the best movie sequels ever. You can quote me on that,” Cas brings the movie up and presses play. “I had the biggest crush on Willie Scott.” Dean takes another handful of popcorn.
Faith.
“I believe that was you,”
“I’ve always thought Indiana Jones was interesting, especially for the 80s. He is an icon of masculinity, but he lives in both worlds seamlessly,” Cas sticks his hand in the bowl before Dean has a chance to. Throws a couple pieces in his mouth. “One where he would be passed over as a macho icon. In an academic setting, mellowed out, in glasses, a suit, and bowtie. And one where he is an adventurer, rolled sleeves, bulging muscles, rugged scruff-” He isn’t looking at the bowl when he returns his hand there and neither is Dean. Their hands knock together. Dean jerks away an inch. Keeps his hand there. So does Cas.
“Than rescuing the ‘Michael Sword’?” Dean air quoted at him.
"Rufus's collection no good, then?" Sam asked, and Dean chuckled, looking back to the screen.
“We’ll find somewhere. We’ve been up against worse.”
“This isn’t-”
Those eyes had been so angry today, and so sad.
And Dean stood there, listening as the footsteps echoed down the corridor, until he couldn’t hear any more. He was left alone with what felt like a hole gouged out in his ribcage, spelling out the clear word
of all things-
wanted. And wow, Dean wanted.
Dean wasn't having the worst day of his life. Dean wasn't even having the worst day of his week. But, it was perhaps the most uncomfortable he'd had in a while. The fact was, he was stuck with a very odd piece of information, an unwelcome revelation that was staying irritatingly present in his mind, no matter how often he squashed it down.
“Please don’t patronise me, Sam.”
"What?" Dean peered in, looking for the offending object. "What did? Did we leave a knife in there?"
Sam smiled. "No, I meant-"
“Yup.” Dean answered quickly, yanking the door open and stepping in. “We’re hitting the shops first, Cas is making
“Which part?” He asked cautiously.
“That you didn’t want it, you only did it to please me.” Cas moved away, shaking his head as he remembered the guilt he had felt, and it was morphing into rage. “But you wanted it too?”
beat. A
“What’s are you thinking?” Dean asked.
The blade twisted, and Livvie reached in, grabbing what she could. Turning fast, she took the charm from the table with the other hand, and moving with ease she rushed for the window, slamming both hands against the still-wet sigil. She hit too hard, the glass shattered under the pressure, but it was enough, the deed was done.
“Dean.” Cas said again, clearer, determined, and Dean looked up at him. “Pants.”
“If you want me to be a perfect gentleman tonight Cas, I can.” Dean rushed out, trying to calm himself down for a second.
“I’m heading out into town.” Dean announced, trying to be casual. “Anyone want anything?”
“I meant…” Sam huffed. “You seemed kinda pissed at him this morning. Yesterday was great, you fixed the Crowley problem, got us safe-” The bee keeping woman looked up at them again, and Sam cut himself off. “You did really good. But you guys seem off again today. Did he say something, or…”
They made sure the bunker was safe every way they knew how, making sure the doors were locked, even finding a set of keys which fit the lock, which would be a way more comfortable and hygienic way of getting in and out. They laid a salt line at the entrance, which they realised was moot when they noticed the devils traps and warding painted in every door frame, every kickboard. They wandered the halls a little, and Dean’s excitement when they found the garage complete with vintage cars was unparalleled. But fatigue got the better of them, it had been a long day, and napping in the car just ain’t comfy, especially not in the face of those beds waiting for them.
“A book of poems. All different poets, I think. I chose one a bit at random.” He returns to his book, one hand coming up to rest over his mouth and the other coming to rest quite near Dean’s hand.
He'll work on it.
“Yeah, Cas,”
“Dean,” Cas rubs his thumb across the skin below his eye. “You do, Dean. You do.” He’s almost whispering, trying to soothe him. Dean feels sick.
“I like bugs,” Cas nods. “She doesn’t like bugs. Also, some bugs bite. I don’t want her to be bitten.”
“Thank you for the meal, Dean,” Cas moves his chair closer to the table. “It looks delicious.” He has a truly satisfied look on face, taking in the simple meal Dean has served.
“I’m sorry,” He says into Cas’s shirt. Cas’s fingers tighten in his hair and he breathes a sigh into Dean’s neck.
At least, it seemed, he now had time to learn.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean said quietly, watching as Cas flicked the page. Yeah, he was still mad.
"No!" Dean yelled. "Not this one!" He ran forwards to Cas, ready to catch him when he fell, but instead Dean felt his own feet fall, slipping off the dry boards and into the water below.
"They- what?"
“So, nothing?”
“You’re right.” Sam said, sighing as he flicked through the pages. “Could be a way to get rid of monsters in a controlled way.”
Cas looked around, noticing that it was, indeed, not the car that he was so used to. "This vehicle is different." He commented. "It is not as pleasing as your usual mode of transportation."
“What? Oh, shit.” He grabbed the spatula, flipping the patty, checking out the damage.
She paused. “
"You know," Dean began. "I don't have a bed here. Sammy gets the couch, you have the bed."
"Bite me." He growled.
Dean stopped, looking round, surprised. It was only then that he noticed a slight smirk on Cas's lips. They guy was teasing him.
Cas’s face softened and after a brief hesitation he leaned forwards, pressing his lips to Dean’s forehead in a warm kiss. “Never.” He said softly, and Dean felt his chest warm.
One of the problems about sleep is that once you get some, your body just wants more and more of it. Sam and Dean who routinely live on less than 4 hours sleep a night, are absolutely capable of staying awake, researching for hours on end, spending long nights in the car on stake outs. Cas, however, in a body that, before a few years ago, was used to a healthy dose of 8 hours a night, and had been comatose for the best part of a week, was wilting.
"Because we've all screwed up, big time, at one point or another." Sam reminded. "He kick started the apocalypse, I jumped it into overdrive. You became God to stop a worse one." Sam sighed. "We all had the best of intentions."
“Something tells me she’s safer than us.” Sam reminded him, and Dean shrugged in agreement.
"Yeah, it's the onions." He chuckled, gesturing down at it with the knife. "Makes you cry."
She hesitated again. "I don't know." She admitted, "She was gone by the time I had finished." Livvie took a step towards him. "I'm sorry it was her."
No, not just humans. Two archangels' vessels.
He remembered going to his room, happy but tired, the make-up weighing down his eyes in a way that was new. He remembered looking in the mirror, smiling, he could see himself smiling in the mirror, before shying away and heading to bed.
"It does affect me, Cas!" Dean told him, angry. "I have to put up with you moping around here!"
CW: Masturbation
how he’d phrased it. “Come on, it was one kiss.”
"It is not of import." He told her, brushing it off, but she held tight.
She tensed, and turned away, aware that those feeling she had been trying to quell had just visibly surfaced. She forced them down.
Dean glanced down at it, flexing and shutting it into a fist. “It’s fine, had worse.”
“Do you think folks will go for it?” Dean asked. “Organised hunting, a job. A nine to five?”
His brain began to feel fuzzy, next. His thoughts were difficult to track.
He now turned a corner in the road and, almost blissfully, Dean finally saw more signs of life than houses and a post office. He was being led onto a high street with shops, and, of course, a bar. He almost smiled, but hit a moment of hesitation when he saw the highly inconvenient name of the bar on the sign: The Angel.
“Yeah.” Dean firmly replied, so resolute. “I brought you here tonight because… I didn’t want to just take you back for a roll in the hay, I wanted to take you on a date, a real date, to give you what you deserve. I fucked up our first time, I wanna make this time right. You were right to say no after Crowley, to make me think about it all, and if you say no now I’ll get it, but…” He sucked in a deep breath. “I’m ready now, for this.”
"Since when are you ever the same Cas?" Dean joked. "When I first met you, you were a complete dick. Now, with the exception of maybe Sarah Michelle Gellar, you're the person I most want around." He stood up, looking Cas dead in the eye, and the angel moved from the sink to face him. Dean, despite himself, found his gaze dropping to Cas's chest, seeing the faint white lines of an old scar, a sigil that he had carved into himself to save them all.
Dean and Kirsty shared a look, but the hunter shrugged. "I'll make sure he sees it later." He assured her. "He just woke up on the wrong side of the bed today."
Sam frowned in disbelief at her. She was holding his friend hostage, and she was singing. Pushing down the urge to scoff in anger, he simply shook his head and gripped his gun tighter, before taking a deep breath and rounding the corner.
"Yadda yadda." Dean was looking around for the poker again, clearly stuck for a plan past that extended past get her away from Cas.
does the land really belong to?"
"I'm not-" He growled, defensive against her tone, the implication, but his pointless rebuttal was cut off by the fierce press of her lips against his.
He placed the duffel down on the bed, the one Sam had hastily packed from the upstairs room at the cabin, almost a day ago. So much had changed since he was last there, intangible moments scattered across the way, Sam’s blood dropped in the forest, his piss on the side of the road… his
"Dean?" He heard a mumble, and paused, frozen with his hand on the doorknob. He glanced over his shoulder, seeing the sleepy man sit up a little, bleary eyed, and completely adorable, still sleeping in the clothes he had been loaned.
“Strike out?” Dean asked when Charlie came back, and she smiled at him happily.
Castiel's appearance from the lake should have been special, it should have been something that was watched with marvel, and preferably with a touching soundtrack to tug at the heartstrings. It should have been graceful, like in the movies, and Dean and Sam should've been watching.
"Why? Because the guy betrayed us? Because he invited Leviathans over for dinner? Because he lied to us?" He clutched the steering wheel tightly.
Then Dean went home for a few days, but not without calling or texting Castiel every day of course. Dean visited some friends, who of course teased him endlessly about his new boyfriend, which Dean pretended to hate more than he actually did. On New Year's Eve he invited Castiel to a small get-together with his friends: Charlie and her girlfriend Dorothy, Jo, Ash and Benny and his girlfriend Andrea. Cas was hesitant at first but he agreed anyway.
"Gabriel, this is Dean. He's a nice guy, we talked about the weather and about his job." Castiel said.
Sam screamed and nearly dropped his phone. Dean? Coming home with a guy? Wow, he did not expect that, though he had suspected it for a while.
"Oh yeah, I heard all about it from Sam. So, are you guys a thing because you seem like a sweet guy, Castiel. Right what our Dean needs, he's been quite moody lately."
"Well, that went relatively well."
After ordering, they talked a bit to get to know each other more. Castiel and Dean found out that they liked most of the same movies and music. Although Cas had never really listened to Led Zeppelin. Dean found this unacceptable. "How have you never listened to Led Zeppelin? They're like the awesome-est band ever." He exclaimed.
"Hey, it was bound to happen."
Dean grinned and grabbed Cas's hand, kissing it. "Sure thing Honeybee."
"Well, I still think you should take it off, at least the trench coat." Dean winked at him before taking his shirt off, which meant he was shirtless now and Cas didn't think he could handle it. Dean just went back to work like it was nothing and turned around to bend over and look into the car engine. Cas was blushing heavily at this point and really felt like he could faint at the sight of Dean's shirtless body, nevertheless the remark about how he wanted Castiel to take his clothes off. After thinking about it for a minute, he did take his trench coat and suit jacket off. He decided to roll up his sleeves and unbutton the first 2 buttons of his shirt as well. This actually did feel better.
Dean looked under the hood of the car for a while before he got on one of those sliding thingies and got under the car, which was on a platform so it was higher than normal. He was under there a while before rolling back out. "Aren't you really hot?"
"Uh, yeah, we'll continue this next time, remember to make your homework. Have a good day and stay safe everybody." Cas blushed and exited the call, leaving his students in shock.
In the mean time Gabriel had bought the tickets and 3 big buckets of popcorn. Sam chuckled and took 2 from him, as Gabe was about to drop them all. They all went to sit down, their seats were somewhere in the middle, Gabriel on the far left, then Sam, Dean and Castiel. They all talked a bit before the movie started and Dean and Castiel got more comfortable together.
"Hi, wow, uhm-, hi Dean. I mean, Mr. Winchester, of course. My name is Charlie, I'm a big fan. I can't actually believe this is happening right now, wow." Dean could tell she was very excited so he offered to take a picture with her. Obviously people saw it through the open door so they asked for pictures too. Dean ended up taking pictures and giving autographs to a lot of people but after 10 minutes Cas had had enough of it.
As they read all the sweet messages, Dean and Cas were cuddling on the couch. "I love you so much, and I'm so glad I can now share it with the entire world." Dean said before kissing Castiel.
"Okay, everyone go to your lessons, they're about to start. And Dean, honey, I think it's better for the students' ability to concentrate that you leave too."
After that night Castiel was so embarrassed he stopped breaking his car and they actually didn't see each other for a while. Until one fateful night. Sam and Gabe had gone on a couple of dates and after the third one Sam had asked Gabriel to be his boyfriend. They were a really cute couple, except that there was a little too much PDA for Dean's liking.
"Let's just go home, we can cuddle and maybe I'll even watch one of those nature documentaries with you."
A few months before, Cas had accidentally hit his car - Gabriel called it the 'Pimpmobile'- against a lamppost. When he brought the car to a repair shop, he found out that there was a really hot mechanic working there. After his car was fixed, Castiel thought he would never see the guy again. 2 weeks later Cas's car broke again. Luckily the hot guy - Dean, as his name tag read - fixed Castiel's car again. While on the way home, Cas decided he had to see Dean again, so he made a plan: he would just break his car again so he could keep seeing Dean. It quickly became very expensive but it was worth it to Cas. He would also make trips to the repair shop for friends and family, claiming that he had time anyway and they could use his car until theirs was fixed.
"Yeah, I know, I'd just like a bit more privacy sometimes. Not that I don't like the fact that you're famous, I love you and everything you do." Cas quickly said, not wanting Dean to get the wrong idea.
"You know you could have just asked me if it was okay if they went with us, Sam."
~~~~~~~~
"Oh, well, I'm just gonna go see what Sam is doing." She left shooting a smirk at Dean, who just glared at her.
"Yeah sure, here you go." Gabriel showed Dean his phone with Cas's contact so Dean could put the number in his phone.
"Yeah, I'm coming, don't get you panties in a twist. Happy holidays, Gabriel." Dean said before he was dragged out of the building by Sam.
Dean: Hey, it's Dean, Gabriel gave me your number. I don't know if I'm coming on too strong but would you like to grab dinner sometime?
"MOm, why do you have to be so embarrassing?" Dean groaned and turned around to make the pancakes. "It is very nice to meet you, and to answer your question, no we aren't a thing, but I wouldn't mind it to be honest." Castiel blushed and shot an adoring look at Dean before turning back to Mary.
They ended the video with a quick message to Queer people out there, to be proud and to not be afraid or ashamed of who you are. It'll be alright.
"Okay, but please try not to attract too much attention. The students need to focus on their studies." Cas sighed.
"And if it isn't Dean, why doesn't your roommate show himself? It's not like you'd show yourself to the whole  world, we're just a bunch of teenagers." Jo says. At this point the whole class was intrigued by this mysterious person.
Cas looked up in confusion, a dark blush on his cheeks. "I mean, you're wearing a suit and a trench coat in the summer. Isn't that really hot? I'd be sweating my ass off wearing that." Dean chuckled.
"We're married actually, have been for 2 years." Cas waved his hand in front of the camera. Kevin, who had just climbed back on his chair, almost fell off again.
They got out of the car and grabbed the boxes. Dean stacked three on top of each other and Cas grabbed the last one. He had to lead the way since Dean had never been to the school before.
After about 30 minutes of Cas admiring Dean's muscled back and Dean pretending not to notice/ignoring it, the car was fixed. Sadly enough, this meant that Cas had to leave again. "I'll see you next time, Cas." Dean said before walking back inside. Cas drove home with a happy feeling in his stomach.
"How did you meet?" Cas decided to answer this one. "My brother Gabriel introduced us because Dean was good friends with him, and still is."
"Dean, I can't handle another day of 'Cas this, Cas that, did you know that his eyes are this amazing color of blue, he's like the most beautiful person I've ever seen.'" Sam mocked Dean.
Castiel drives his car into the garage and gets out. He almost trips over his own feet at the sight of Dean. It was almost summer and it was already very hot so Dean had tied the upper body of his overall around his waist and his white (at this point almost transparent) t-shirt was sticking to his body. It also didn't help that Dean just wiped the sweat off his forehead, thus showing his amazing biceps. Well, let's just say Cas barely managed to not drool.
Dean had been working on a new song for hours when he felt kinda hungry, so he headed to the kitchen to make some lunch. He didn't think about Cas' lessons at all when he walked into the kitchen, humming a Led Zeppelin song.
"You live with Dean freaking Winchester?!?" Charlie yelled into the microphone, after unmuting herself.
"I can totally do that. When do I ever attract any attention?" Dean grinned, knowing damn well that wherever they go, there will always be people who know him and want to talk to him. "But if I'm going with you, we're going in style. And that means we're taking Baby, not that piece of crap on four wheels you call a car."
"I think I have to leave soon or my dad will get really mad. I've never really stayed the night with anyone after a party before." He blushed before looking down at his lap. 'He is so cute' was Dean's immediate thought.
Mrs. Moseley closed the door behind him and Gabriel and Dean sat down on the chairs.
"Mmm? What? Oh, yeah." Castiel replied, sounding very distant. "It's just, they look like an angel and a demon, it's an odd combination. I've never seen it before."
It's been a couple of months since they came out and, since summer vacation is ending, the schools have opened up again. This means he has to bring all the books he had at home back to school.
"Castiel." The guy - Castiel, apparently - hesitated before he carefully shook Dean's hand.
"It's okay, I see their faces, I used to call it their true form. For demons it's like a black blur, for angels it's like a skull but made of blue light, it's hard to describe. My father was very religious so my psychologist says this kind of started because of that, but I might tell you more about that another time."
~~~~~~
Dean grinned at this statement but Castiel just looked more distressed. He didn't want his students to find out, not like this.
~~~~~~
The class he was teaching right now was one he had been teaching for a couple of years, which is why he was quite close with them. He was a history teacher and loved both the subject and this class but sometimes they were a bit too much. The class - especially Charlie, an enthusiastic red-head - liked to tease him about getting a boyfriend. Little do they know, he was already married to Dean Winchester, famous singer and youtuber.
"Ah, okay. Now onto the thing I actually wanted to say but I didn't get the chance last Wednesday: I want to thank you for being there for my brother, he's never really had friends before, people always left him once they found out about his condition. I now know the reason why you're so easy about all of this, because you've seen it before, but still, you've really helped Cas come out of his shell, even helped him make some new friends, something I've been trying for years but I never succeeded. Thank you so much."
"This is my husband Castiel Novak, we've been married for 2 years now, although we've know eachother for a long time." Dean smiled at Cas.
Gabriel: kisses, why?
"That's great Gabriel, but I swear if you said anything about me to Dean I will not hesitate to kill you." Castiel glared at Gabriel. "Oh no, Cassie don't worry. I didn't say a word about you. I wouldn't dare. I might have asked them to join us here though.."
"Hey, uh, would you maybe like to go on a date with me some time?" Dean blushed as he said this.
"Hey, my name's Dean." Dean held his hand out towards mystery-man.
"That totally sounds like Dean Winchester." Jo now joins the conversation.
"It's weird that they're eating ice cream in the winter, isn't it?" Dean nudged Castiel, who was now straight-up staring at them.
Castiel didn't have a car so Dean drove him home in the Impala. He had parked the car in front of the house when he asked Cas"How does next Friday sound for our date?".
At the end of the day, after school, Dean was leaning against the Impala when Cas came walking towards him.
"Casjel?" Dean chuckled at Ben's mispronunciation.
Then they decided to answer some of the questions fans sent them.
"Of course, I don't want him to be alone either. And Sam is going with his girlfriend, Jess, to visit her parents so I'll be alone too, it'd be nice to hang out. Do you maybe have his number so I can text him?"
Sam and Gabriel agreed that they were done with Cas and Dean's constant pining over each other. After Gabriel told Sam about Cas purposefully breaking his car so he could see Dean, Sam had laughed for about 5 minutes before telling him that Dean actually really liked it when Cas came and was practically in love with him. So they made up a plan to get their brothers together. Sam would ask Dean to go to see a new movie and Gabe would do the same with Cas. Then, with the power of Sabriel, they would bump into each other and spontaneously decide to go see the movie together.
"Sir, I have a question."
Castiel: Gabriel, what does "xx" mean?
Dean chuckled. "What, your mother tell you that?"
"Why do you think I'm getting you to do it?" Mary smirked. The last time Sam had to wake Dean up, Dean had thrown a shoe at Sam's head. Sam would rather not have that repeated.
"They're a couple? Oh, that does not bother me at all. Gabriel is bisexual, Loki is genderfluid and I think I'm gay, so it would be weird if I was against it." Castiel looked at Dean for a second before returning his gaze towards the odd couple.
"I'm available then, can you pick me up at six?"
They arrived at school 20 minutes later, thanks to Dean, who went a little too fast and sang a little too loud for Castiel's liking. They sat in the parking lot for a minute before Dean grabbed Cas's hand.
The movie was a thriller, it was about a girl whose parents were killed. She didn't have any other family besides them and any person she tried to ask for help was killed. So she tried to find who her killer was and why he wanted to kill her family. All while she was being followed and nearly killed a couple of times. It turned out to be a whole organisation of people, in the end of the movie she was in the same building as everyone from the organisation. She had somehow gotten hold of a bomb, so she made it go off, killing the entire organisation and getting revenge, sacrificing herself in the process.
Castiel: Hello, Dean. I'd like that. Will this be a date?
"Yeah, until Charlie ruined it." Cas grumbled.
While he was walking to Dean's room, he decided to film it, for comedic purposes. Dean had gone to a party yesterday night and he always comes home really late after parties, or early, depends on how you see it. So he would probably be hungover as hell, which always resulted in a very groggy and annoyed Dean the morning after.
Cas was just about to correct him when a woman, presumably Ben's mother, approached them. "Oh, I'm so sorry. Has Ben been bothering you?"
"Next one: Cas, could you please bring Dean to school one day?" "I assume this is one of my students, I am a history teacher at a high school. And to answer your question, I might do that, but only if you'll stay calm and don't have a meltdown. Yes I'm talking to you Charlie, I know it was you who asked this question." Cas pointed at the camera.
"Hey Cassie, you ready to go? Who's this? He's not your new punching bag, right?" The guy chuckled as he shook Dean's hand. "I'm Gabe, his big bro. And this is my kid, Loki."
"No, Dean has never sung that song in a video, I would know." Charlie says, trying to find out who this mystery person is. "And that was definitely Dean, or it had to be a very good impersonator, but even then it's not possible because Dean's voice is to great and unique to be copied."
"My brother."
"What was your first impression of Dean?"
Dean was telling Cas about a snowball fight he had with the kids at school when he saw that Cas was distracted by something. When he looked in the direction Cas was looking in, he saw two quite odd people sitting on a bench. One of them had white hair and was wearing a cream-and-beige-colored three-piece suit, he looked quite angelic while the other one had fiery red hair and all-black clothes. They were eating ice cream, even though there was no ice cream truck to be seen.
"Ugh okay then, but I'm not lending you any money when you run out okay? Now go off and let your boyfriend fix that damn car."
"Are you kidding me, Bradbury?" The teacher muttered under his breath, to which Dean just chuckled. They quickly walked to Cas's classroom and put the boxes on his desk.
"Are you okay, Angel? I know you didn't want this to happen, and I'm really sorry but they figured it out and we couldn't lie our way out of this one." Dean hugged his husband, who was quite stunned at the whole event.
Cas almost ran out of the apartment.
"Awesome."
"Yeah, let's just go, we still have to carry all of my stuff inside."
"No, I'm not gonna answer any more questions about Dean. Please ask questions about your homework if you have any."
"You're weak Cassie, just watch and learn." And with that Gabe walked over to Dean and the other guy, who were sitting at the bar talking to Ellen, the owner of the bar. Gabriel talked to them for a bit and at some point handed his phone to the tall guy. After about 5 minutes he walked back with a smirk on his face. "I got his number." he sang, waving his phone as he sat back down at their table. "His name is Sam, he's Dean's brother and he goes to the university here."
"True, but now I don't have a choice, you're just forcing me to socialize."
They all arrived at the cinema at the same time. Sam and Gabriel immediately kissed and hugged each other while Dean and Castiel stood there awkwardly. "Wow, what a coincidence you're here too. Well, we could just go all together, right Sammy?" Gabe said, way too surprised. When they all walked in together, Dean grabbed Sam's jacket and pulled him back for a bit. "You two totally set this up, didn't you?" Sam smiled sheepishly.
"This is my friend, Castiel." Dean smiled.
"Why would he hit me?" Dean's curiosity got the better of him and he did want to know if he had been talking with a criminal.
When Dean was walking home from work through the park on a Wednesday he noticed two things: the first one was a group of teenagers quietly laughing and pointing at someone, the second of was the person they were laughing at, a dark-haired man sitting alone on a bench.
"Yeah, no, that's just a video of him. My roommate's a big fan of his." Castiel quickly says, mentally praying for Dean to shut the fuck up. "Hey, roommate? Could you please turn down the volume of that video you're playing?" Cas said pointedly, turning around to look at Dean. The singer mouthed 'sorry', not daring to talk in case anyone recognized his voice.
"That is true." Castiel pondered.
"Who?" Michael asked in confusion. "Dean is Cas's boyfriend from the garage, you know, the reason Cassie here keeps smashing his car." Gabriel explains, earning a smack on his arm from Castiel "He's not my boyfriend, he is way out of my league and he's probably straight."
Cas blushed at this and kissed Dean, who quickly deepened the kiss before Cas could leave. After about 5 minutes of making out, someone knocked on the window. Castiel quickly pulled away to see his brother Balthazar standing there, smirking. "You better come in soon, dad's about to leave and you don't want him walking in on this." he said, motioning to them in the car.
Castiel, who had been out of frame before, now walked in and sat next to Dean. He looked a bit nervous so Dean grabbed his hand.
Sam waited a few seconds in front of the door to get his phone ready to film. When he started filming, he threw the door open, switched the light on and yelled "Wake up sleepyhead!".
Dean, the righteous man himself, decided to do something about this. So he went and sat on the bench, next to the man. Dean was a teacher at the local primary school so the laughing kids quickly ran away, Dean - or 'mister Winchester' was known to be firmly against bullying and he would often scold kids if he saw them bullying another kid.
"Oh, he's real happy you're there for him too, if you know what I mean." Gabriel wiggled his eyebrows before continuing, "I have one more request, since I'll be gone Cassie will be alone during the holidays, the rest of our siblings live too far away and have their own families to celebrate it with. Could you maybe drop by once or twice during that time? I don't want him to be all by himself the entire time. He wouldn't ask you himself because he'd only feel like he's a burden to you, but I know he'd like it."
But now that he was teaching from home, it was getting harder to keep their relationshil a secret. Dean didn't really mind if the kids would know or not, but Castiel was afraid they wouldn't pay attention to the lesson anymore and instead just ask him questions about Dean all the time.
Dean: I'll bring some movies and I'll also bring the food, I'll have to prepare it at yours, but that won't be a problem, right?
"But you know my name now, right? We're not strangers anymore." Dean knew that he might be pushing but it couldn't hurt to try, Castiel seemed like a nice guy.
When he arrived at the repair shop Bobby, the boss, walked over to him laughing. "Castiel, are you here again? At this point it'd be cheaper to buy a new car."
"Hey little guy, how are you doing? This is Ben." He said the second thing to Castiel, who looked at Ben curiously.
The rest of the day mainly consisted of Castiel trying to get his students to concentrate - and failing miserably - and him answering many many questions about Dean and about their relationship.
Castiel hesitated for a moment before grabbing Dean's hand. "I think I can handle it, let's go."
"I guess I'm okay with a video, people will ask questions anyway. And this way we can do it all at once and get that out of the way."
"So, I had a good time tonight. Despite the horrible ending of the movie, obviously." Cas blushed and Dean chuckled. "Yeah, me too. I uh-, I had a great time. We could do it again sometime if you want." This time it was Dean who was blushing.
"Nice to meet you, I couldn't help but notice those kids, were they bothering you? I'm their teacher, I could talk to them about it tomorrow." Dean suggested, and Castiel could see the honesty in his eyes.
"Hey, Zira. How're you doing?"
Dean flashed her a smile. "Not at all, miss Braeden."
"What is it?"
A few hours later the couple were sat in front of a camera. Dean had sent out a tweet saying 'Today I will be filming a video with a mystery guest. And because news travels fast, I'm sure you all already know who that is. Please reply with any questions you have, we'll try to answer as many as we can.' and the replies came rolling in.
Dean suddenly stood up, holding his hand out for Cas to grab. "Good, because they're good friends of mine and I'm going to introduce you. If that's okay with you, of course."
"Yeah well, I'm doing a lot better now so it won't happen again." Castiel huffed.
They talked about random things for a while until a man approached them, dragging a kid with him who definitely did not want to leave the playground.
"Gabriel, I swear to dad I'm going to murder you." Cas punched Gabriel in the shoulder. "Look, I know you don't like this but I'm tired of you talking about Dean all the time yet doing nothing about it. So just see this as a push in the right direction." Gabriel waved to Sam as they walked over. Sam looked really happy and immediately sat next to Gabriel so now there was only one chair left. Dean sat down next to Castiel while glaring daggers at his brother, who bitch faced him.
"Then yes, I'd love to go on a date with you." Cas kissed Dean softly before getting up to get his trench coat.
For a moment Dean was too stunned to say anything, then he shrugged, acting like it was nothing. "I- thank you. I mean, this is something everyone should do. The fact that people shut him out just because he's a bit different is horrible and should never happen. I'm happy to be there for him."
Since last week Cas's car made some weird noise so it was time for another trip to the garage. "Just ask him out already, then you can stop doing this because it's really getting out of hand." Gabriel said. "I am aware, Gabriel. But how am I supposed to do that? My 'people skills' are 'rusty', also he is probably straight so he's not interested in me like that." Castiel replied, getting frustrated with Gabriel.
To Castiel: See you then. xx
It was the beginning of December and it was getting quite cold so they were both wearing gloves and a scarf. Castiel was also wearing a winter hat which Dean thought was really cute. But to be fair, Dean thought everything Castiel did was cute. A few weeks after their first meeting, Dean had started calling him Cas, just because it was easier. Castiel normally didn't like nicknames, but for some reason he didn't mind it when Dean did it.
"Oh that's fine. Actually, Dean, do you mind staying here for a bit? I want to ask you something." Gabriel look at Dean with the last question.
“My --” Dean wants to turn around, but his back still aches from last time. “My soul?”
Dean swallows and opens his eyes. They sit there.
“Messed up.”
Cas used to turn his head away to not embarrass Dean with the smile that spread on his face. It always felt like the missing piece of the day, to have Dean sit beside him.
Castiel had to admit, he became shameless with those first few meetings in particular. It couldn’t be helped. He was lost from the moment he’d laid hands on his soul.
Dean gets dressed and walks to Cas’s room. He knocks on the door.
“You should stay in here,” Dean says against his chest.
“Then let’s stop and get something to eat, Sam,” Dean rolls his eyes. “Where do you want?”
“Don’t like bugs?” Dean feels Cas’s fingers tighten around his arm.
And though hunger followed him, it became more of a companion to him, one that bled and beat him one day, nursed and comforted him the next.
“You have nothing to be embarrassed about, Dean.” He links his fingers together in his lap. Dean tries not to pause on that thought.
“What the hell? The steaks were perfect, shut up.”
The hand not on his face moves slowly, slow enough for Dean to pull away. He touches Dean’s fingers lightly, testing the waters. Dean turns his hand around, palm up. Cas slips his hand into it, curling their fingers around each other, and looks back up to Dean. Shifts closer.
“Maybe that’s why you’re getting into poetry,” Dean says, a little breathless.
Cas shuffles in, rubbing at his eyes while Dean is washing his hands. Dean turns off the sink and looks at the clock. 1:30.
But this hunger was too strong. The faith of a man who never stopped hoping, despite having no proof. Endless hunger for an endless faith.
Dean is sitting on the couch, holding Cas’s hand, watching Indiana Jones, and talking about his feelings. Or trying to. He can feel every individual point of contact between them until he can’t, until it’s just them sharing space. He wants to run away, it’s too tender, it feels like he’s on fire.
He asks, “Reading what?” as Cas sets his glass down. Dean picks it back up and turns to the dishwasher.
Gabriel had always liked them. Castiel didn’t indulge the way Gabriel did, but with every moment spent in and out of Dean Winchester’s company, he found himself growing hungrier and hungrier.
“Good to know,” He murmurs, eyes shifting to Dean’s lips. Dean turns back to the TV. A moment later, so does Cas.
Dean can barely think about it without getting embarrassed. It isn’t all sex, either. It’s something bubbling up under Dean’s skin when the sex is over, though that too never seems to last long enough. His skin burns with it long after release is found.
"Happy holidays, Dean." He smiled and Dean blushed.
"I don't know if this is too personal but how do you know if a person is an angel or a demon? We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to." Dean asked carefully, not wanting to push Castiel into telling something he wasn't ready to talk about.
"Oh, uh, that? That was nobody. Just a - a roommate, yeah he's just a roommate." Cas blushes and looks away. Then they start hearing someone sing Good times, Bad times by Led Zeppelin.
"Kevin! Not you too." Cas groaned.
Castiel looked up in surprise."You really want that?"
"You know, we did come out. Which means we don't have to hide anymore. Which means, I can totally come to your school and help you out. Please, Angel, I really want to go." He now hugged Cas from behind, laying his chin on Cas's shoulder.
Cas just huffed in response before hugging Dean and giving him a quick kiss. He had to remember they were still in public.
"It's lovely to meet you, my name is Aziraphale and this is my partner Crowley."
When he finished, Dean put the pancakes on a plate and grabbed some more things before sitting down next to Cas. They ate in silence until Cas spoke up.
"Yeah, we had to reschedule the appointment because me and the fam are leaving to celebrate the holidays with Kali's parents in a few days. We couldn't be there for Diwali last month so I definitely can't cancel now." Gabriel explained.
"Dean, I do have to go soon." Cas climbed over Dean and started searching for his clothes. Dean reluctantly got up and put on some clothes as well, he would shower later. When they were both dressed, Cas pulled Dean into a soft kiss before walking downstairs to the kitchen for some breakfast.
Castiel: Okay.
"Wouldn't be the first time." Dean mumbled softly before looking at Cas, who saw the question in his eyes. The teacher thought about it for a couple of seconds before nodding reluctantly.
Castiel: A date sounds nice.
"I'm kinda craving some pancakes right now, do you want pancakes? I could make something else if you want, you know."  Dean said. Cas chuckled at Dean's cuteness.
"I don't think 'awesome-est' is a word, Dean." Cas replied.
"Who was that?" Charlie interrupted Cas, who was in the middle of a sentence. "Excuse me?" Castiel said, confused because he hadn't noticed Dean yet.
At that moment Sam walked in. "Dean, if I have to wait longer I will take the bus home."
~~~~~~~~
It was Saturday and Cas and Gabriel went for a drink with their brother Lucifer and his boyfriend Michael at this local bar called 'The Roadhouse'. They had been there for about an hour when 2 guys walked in, Castiel spotted them and immediately ducked his head "Oh dad, Dean is here."
"I'm just happy I finally get to show you off to the public, now everyone can finally see how smoking hot my husband is." Dean grinned, kissing Cas again, who just blushed and moved to get into the car. When they got home, they did, as promised, cuddle and watch a documentary. Even though Dean fell asleep in Cas's lap after 15 minutes.
Mary looked up from reading the paper at the kitchen table with an amused look. "Hey boys, d'you sleep well?" Dean jumped and almost dropped the bowl of pancake-batter he was holding. Mary smirked and got up.
"That's totally okay. But the fact that they're a couple doesn't bother you?" Dean asked, if this guy was a homophobe, he wanted nothing to do with him, however nice he could be.
"Well, I think Dean has nothing to do at the moment so he can help you." Bobby says with a smirk.
"Anyway, it was nice to meet you Dean but we do have to go." Gabriel grabbed his kid's hand again and tugged on Castiel's trenchcoat.
"Yeah, I mean, you're really cute, and hot. And I would never spend the night with someone I'm not interested in, I really want to get to know you."
"I'm used to wearing this so it doesn't bother me, I don't get hot very fast, also I don't sweat under any circumstances." Cas replied, ignoring the fact that Dean was making him feel very hot right now.
"I wanted to tell you something but now I'm curious, who was that? Are you here for yourself or for him?" Gabriel asks him straight away.
"Look, I know that you must have a lot of questions, and we will answer them all, just not right now. In fact, I think this lesson is over, isn't it, Angel?"
Dean set up the camera so it started filming before talking. "Hey guys, as you all know, I'm bisexual. I've always been very open about that, but I haven't talked a lot about my relationships, that is because I like to keep certain things private. Now, this morning something happened that forced me and my partner to come out, we have been out to our friends and family since the beginning but we didn't want the whole world to know about it yet. And although this isn't the way we hoped to come out, we're both ready now and okay with it so that's why I'm now going to introduce you to my husband Castiel."
"Sure, just don't forget the masks, they're on the kitchen table."
The few people who were already at school didn't really recognize Dean at first because he had a box in front of half his face but of course Charlie had to ruin the fun.
“There’s a third Indiana Jones movie.” He says. Cas comes out and closes the door behind him.
Works in progress, all of them, in the beginning stages. But it’s work he knows how to do, the kind he can do with his hands. He can touch something, grab something, move something and make it happen. Dean is a tactile learner.
A pile of butchered, burning rugaru behind them, Cas reached with an unfamiliar desperation for a bleeding Dean. Hands pressed into the wounds, searching for something to sop it up. His hands on Dean weren’t enough to heal anymore, and by the time Cas found bandages there was a wild look in his eye. After patching up the wounds, he went for the next best thing, Dean guessed.
“You --” Dean snaps his mouth shut. “My --” He hears the car unlock and turns around before Sam opens the door and settles in. If he notices Dean’s flaming face, he doesn’t say anything, only starts the car up and drives the half hour to Lebanon. Cas sneaks a hand into one of the bags for a couple french fries.
“What the hell,” Sam grabs a glass out of the cupboard and fills it with water, slowly moving his hand away from his eyes. “Dude.” Sam takes a long drink and looks with tired eyes at Dean’s moving hands.
“Okay.” Dean can’t look into Cas’s eyes for this long without falling apart, so he turns back to the TV, where Harrison Ford is punching a Nazi or something. He knows there’s more to say, but he needs a break.
“Sometimes,” He begins, cautiously. “I forget that --” He stops. Dean turns around fully and gasps at the sharp pain that spikes through his back. Cas lurches forward again and reaches a hand out, but stops. Dean leans into his seat and closes his eyes.
He volunteers to fight on the front lines at the museum while Sam and Cas go to burn the bones in a cemetery across town.
He had faith. Later on, he’d lament that he could not shake it. If not for his father, then for something else. Someone else.
“What?” Dean says just to say it.
Sometimes it almost seemed like Dean felt the same kind of hunger.
And then Cas just walks to his room. Dean watches him go.
“Sorry,” Dean breaths in and lets the breath out relax him. He lowers the volume.
He always knew when it came down to choice, he would give it all up. He’d done it before, and he’d do it again and again. To save the world he loved, to save the people in it, to save the family he built. It was another purpose for him.
Dean tries getting up and stumbles, his back taking him down. His phone rings. He uses the iron poker to get to his feet and answers.
“Did my soul tell you that?”
And his eyes. The deep well of his eyes.
Still, he hungered.
“Dude, I’m gonna kick your ass. Aren’t you supposed to be nice to me, now?”
He presses his lips together, a pained expression crossing his face, and it strikes Dean that Cas has feelings about all of this outside of just wanting Dean in the way he’s been having him. He wonders suddenly if the time and space between them has an effect on Cas like it does on him, and feels, not for the first time, like a stupid selfish asshole.
But now, having been really touched, having been with Cas, having tasted him, the intention of everything amplifies every interaction. There’s the memory of Cas’s hand on his bare hip, the wanting something from Dean that Dean doesn’t have to decide to give, that he gives Cas just by being. It rolls over again and again in Dean’s head. Now Dean knows it’s better than he thought. The deep satisfaction of it, the all encompassing feeling, the comfort and the connection that Dean has never been able to get from anyone else.
“I --” He sighs. “Can I sleep in your Zeppelin t-shirt?” Dean stares.
Not so bad to spend his last moments looking into green eyes.
Cas hangs around now, hangs around Dean, after hunts and they just finished one a couple days prior. Cas always likes to get some reading in during these in between times, though Dean doesn’t know what it is he reads.
No time to be held afterwards. The motel door opened with the smell of fast food wafting in and Dean slipped into the bathroom before Sam could see the pathetic look in his eyes.
And suddenly hunger rushed back into him, this hunger so missed that Castiel reached out immediately and without restraint to satiate it.
“I’m sorry that I’m, uh,” Dean watches Harrison Ford run on screen. “I’m just not. Good with,” He can feel his heart beating and tries again. “Cas, you know that I --” Jesus, he is bad at everything about this. He pinches the bridge of his nose and screws his eyes shut.
He’s sitting with his legs crossed on the couch, peering intently as he scrolls through the choices. Dean stares at him, listening to the whir of the microwave spinning the popcorn around. He knows he makes things a little more complicated than they are. It’s possible that Dean doesn’t need to ask. He can just sit close to Cas, he can put his arm around Cas’s shoulders. He can put his head on Cas’s lap. He is maybe possibly allowed to do that.
“You can, you do,” Cas breathes. “Dean, I want you to be happy, too. I want you to want to be happy. I want you to ask for the things you want and I want to give them to you,” He presses his lips to the corner of Dean’s mouth, dropping his hands to Dean’s shoulders. Dean shivers under him, tears welling up again and no, no more crying tonight, thank you. Another deep breath.
Cas wraps his fingers around Dean’s wrist, tugging at it. Dean keeps his eyes cast down.
He doesn’t know what it is, what to call it, what to ask for if he even gets the courage to ask. He doesn’t know why the cold that creeps in when Cas slips off and away seems to seep into him, tie him down, sink him into the floor. He can’t name its absence.
Popcorn.
Dean heads out before he’s asked to help.
“It is,” Cas doesn’t stop staring at Dean. Dean feels locked into place. “Good. I find myself relating to many of the poems in it. Humans have an interesting way of describing the way they feel. So many like to say it without saying it,” He blinks suddenly like his train of thought has been interrupted. “If that makes any sense.”
Being touched by Cas was being healed. It was a cleansing fire coursing through him, no time to register the warmth in his hands or the calluses on his fingers. It was holding onto each other for mere seconds after thinking the other had died. Desperate and short lived, ringing in his ears and his own breathing like a roar in his head. In the smaller, precious moments, it was Cas’s knee pressed against his at a bar. Sometimes it was fingers brushing to change the song on the radio. It was his heart beating out of his chest with Cas pressed against his side, waiting for a monster or ghost or demon to pop out around the corner.
He doesn’t end up sleeping much.
“Forgot what?” Cas looks up. He doesn’t speak for a moment.
Dean remembers his dad coming in sore and tired with blood on his face and an empty look in his eye. He remembers putting his hand on his shoulder, the muscles underneath tensing up. His dad had put his hand over Dean’s and gave him a weak smile over his shoulder. When his hand moved away, so did Dean’s.
Cas answers in one of Dean’s shirts.
How could Castiel not put his faith in him in return?
How ironic, then, that the thing to take it all away from them would be named Empty.
“I’m only living here for the food,”
That must be the end because Cas doesn’t say anymore, he just leans forward and captures Dean’s lips with his own, rolling Dean over onto his back and shifting over top of him. Dean grabs at the hair on the back of Cas’s neck and arches into him as Cas mouths at his neck.
Dean lets one of the bastards chuck him against the wall like it will knock this heaviness out of him, but all it does is hurt him. The night guard who let Dean in yells out and fires his gun into the air, the ghosts disappearing and reappearing closer to him. Dean forces himself up and grapples for his gun, firing off a few rounds and watching them disappear again. He crowds the night guard back into the salt circle with an iron poker and feels something grab him by the collar of his jacket. He’s lifted a foot into the air before the guard swings the poker at the ghost and, unfortunately, into Dean’s back.
“Yes.” Cas smiles.
He pauses on his next words, looking at Dean like he’s a scared animal again. Maybe he is one. But the hand on his face and the knee knocking against his knee and the warmth on all sides anchor Dean down. He wishes he had the shadows from earlier to hide in, a dark empty street to speak into, to be swallowed by.
“It’s not just bein’ touched, it’s when you touch me,” It falls out of Dean’s mouth because it has to. Cas can’t think that -- “It’s when you’re not touching me. You.” Cas’s breath stutters and he leans into Dean, his hand pressing against Dean’s leg.
“It’s good, I just need a minute,”
“Please don’t feel...embarrassed when I say this,” Cas starts and Dean laughs despite himself. The sound is fragile, but it makes the corner of Cas’s mouth lift. “I know, vaguely, how you feel when you’re being touched. And how you feel when you’re not,” Dean’s face is already on fire and Cas smooths a finger across his cheek as if his touch can cool it down. “And it’s a terrible feeling to have, Dean. Please let me --”
“Right,” Cas huffs and follows him.
“Man, I’m really sorry, do you need --”
He sits down, feeling a little better.
“It’s not too late to grab a bite, if you guys are hungry.” Sam slows the car.
“Actually, you --” Cas crosses his arms and glances away. “You’ve seemed a little out of sorts since we got back from the hunt the other day. Are you injured?” Dean pauses for just a second before continuing to scrub.
“That’s very interesting, Dean,” Cas leans against the counter. Dean rubs his hands down the front of his jeans.
Cas gives a low hum and turns back to the bookshelves, running his long fingers delicately along the spines in a row of books. Almost like a caress. Dean bounces his leg. “So the usual type of thing for Sam.” Dean can hear a bit of a smile in Cas’s voice. He gets the urge to crane his head around so he can see it.
Sam notices, because of course he does, and maybe Dean is being a little more snappy than usual. He makes a point of leaving Dean and Cas alone in a room as often as he can. Cas always looks at him like he’s expecting something from Dean and again and again and again Dean can’t give it to him and the feeling and the restlessness only grow.
“What are- what are you reading?” He rushes out. Cas glances up again.
“Smells good,” Cas is suddenly behind him. Dean jumps, only a little, and breathes out. “Sorry, I know. I should wear a bell.” There’s a smile in Cas’s voice and Dean shakes his head, not being able to stop the corner of his mouth from twitching up.
Dean sighs, rubbing circles into the strip of skin exposed from the shirt riding up near Cas’s hip.
Cas felt, all at once, filled to the brim. Tears spilled out of his own eyes and he let himself be held, felt the full meaning of it, as impossible as it was.
Dean cooks dinner. It’s another thing he’s working on, one that once again involves hands and elbow grease. And it’s something, he realizes at some point in the bunker, he can do for Sam. And for Cas.
“Did you?” Cas glances over. Dean shrugs.
In a corporeal form, he saw the soul he rescued come to life in every tick in his jaw, every flash of his eyes, every clutch of uneasy fingers.
“Okay,” Cas’s hand is unsteady on Dean’s face. “Okay.” He says again like he doesn’t know how else to respond and Dean is reminded again that Cas is human, now.
“You forget what, Cas.” Another moment of silence passes. “Cas,” Dean turns his head to look at him. He’s looking out the window at the parking lot. Street lamps light the empty lot, but there are no trees or statues or houses to cast shadows. They light up the side of Cas’s face. “I’m not gonna run away screaming.” He mutters, hoping that’s encouragement enough to keep going.
He pretends not to hear Cas sigh when he makes it out of the kitchen.
As usual, the words he thinks he might want to say get clamped down and forced back. Added to the growing pile of want in his chest, his throat, his arms and face and tips of his ears and is it getting hot in this library because his ears have to be red from heat he can just feel it-
Cas couldn’t quite find the strength to speak, but he wanted to say Dean’s name.
It was bright in the room at first, anything would be bright compared to where he’d been. When his eyes became used to it, he looked around to find no one else there with him.
Cas kept finding purpose. It never felt like he quite deserved the purpose he found, but Claire and Jack loved him anyways. Despite or because, he didn’t quite know. He loved them in return.
Too much, too much, too much.
And he changed, after millenia he changed, like a man changes. He found new purpose, new ones every day. The revelation of free will, the beauty that was to be found on earth in insects and flower and fauna, the well paying labor of forgiveness, the bittersweet sting of vengeance, the desperate claw for survival, and always, always, that undying hunger.
They moved frantically on each other in the back seat of the Impala, Dean gritting his teeth through the ache in his abdomen, Cas mindful of the injuries, and didn’t talk about it after.
Or it was until now. Now it’s both and Dean doesn’t know where to start.
Cas removes his hand and Dean can’t ask him to put it back.
He feels Cas’s eyes on him all the way out the kitchen.
“Dean,” Cas murmurs without looking at him. Dean starts, coming back into his body without realizing he’d been gone and every touch between them feels new. Cas is sitting with his head on Dean’s chest and he smells like Dean’s shampoo wearing Dean’s shirt from when he was 19 and had never slept in the same place for more than a week on purpose and hadn’t been really held by someone since he was a kid. He’s holding his hands. Both of them. Dean shudders. “I like when --” Cas squeezes his fingers. Lowers his voice. “I like when you let me do this.”
“I am in here.” He can hear a smile in Cas’s voice. Bastard.
Cas, damn him, is wearing slacks and a button up shirt, the top few buttons undone and the sleeves rolled up to the elbow. His hair is in its usual mess, Cas being unmoved to comb it, especially in the bunker. Altogether a very cozy look. The look of a man by whom you know it would just be nice to be held. Bastard. Dean chews the inside of his cheek, eyes still moving from the book to the lines of Cas’s back where his shirt fits unreasonably well.
“You’ve definitely got an eye for my taste,” Dean is burning up, but he goes on. “Brains and brawn.” He chances a glance at Cas and holds his eye. Cas gives him that small smile that makes his eyes kinda glow. God.
It happened without consistency or pattern, rushed moments of something like intimacy in the moments in between moments. Dean took what he could get and then, unbidden, the thought arrived. That Cas didn’t just want him occasionally, but wanted him.
Dean figures it out one night in an alley pressed up against a wall next to a blood stain. Between the teeth and gasps and pushing and pulling, one of Cas’s hands rests on his hip, underneath his shirt. Dean never finds himself distracted from Cas’s mouth when it’s on him, but that hand distracts him. The weight, the warmth, the way it holds him there, like it wants something from Dean that he can give just by being.
Duty, he still had, responsibility and loyalty, he still had. Faith.
“So?” Dean lets himself look over to Cas. Cas nods, looking back.
He takes a shower and brushes his teeth. He stares at himself in the mirror for a while, wondering if he looks like a guy who longs for things, if you can see it on his face. Apparently not. Apparently his soul is having conversations with Cas about how he feels --
Dean’s Zeppelin shirt really is soft as hell. He never noticed. He rubs his cheek down it a little. Well, he rubs his cheek against Cas’s chest. Which happens to be wearing Dean’s shirt. Cas plays with Dean’s hair, his other arm between his head and Dean’s pillow.
“What’s the fucking poem.” He scoots up, resting his head next to Cas’s. Cas follows him with his hand, leaving his back and holding Dean’s hand to his chest. His eyes roam Dean’s face and Dean still isn’t used to knowing how affectionate the look behind it is, so he looks away. Looks at their hands.
