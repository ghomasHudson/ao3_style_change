“And you sat at the table and ate them. And you took the necklace off before taking your plate to the kitchen sink. That means you didn’t wash your hands in between the two acts, yes?”
“Well, it would be sooooo unfortunate if something were to…happen to her,” Moriarty purred. “Get working on Sherlock. Wouldn’t want to have her simply disappear.”
He was hoping John would say no. Nothing sounded better than allowing John to take the other side of his bed and stay there the rest of the night…stay there every night thereafter if he wanted.
After the car came to a stop he was ushered out. He walked past Neilson on his way into the airplane. The man made a few snide comments, but Sherlock did nothing to stop him. He would have thought the man would have learned his lesson, but provided there were no threats to John or Mrs. Hudson he would try his best to ignore whatever was going on.
She gave him another smirk and pulled back, standing and going over to the other side of the room. There was a sound on the staircase, and then Mrs. Hudson was in the sitting room.
The other man’s blush intensified from the question. Sherlock cocked his head, studying his flatmate for hints.
Lestrade offered her a weak smile. Well, he’d learned a bit too much about Sherlock Holmes for his comfort. But at the very least they were a few steps closer. He’d pass on the information to Watson tonight, and with any luck they’d be home free from there.
“Yeah,” Lestrade said with a huff, shaking his head. “So you’re all right? All of you? No one harmed other than him?”
A groan nearly left John’s mouth. Did he have to do this now? If Molly hadn’t mentioned a boyfriend clearly she didn’t want to talk about it. She probably was still sensitive about the subject after dating Moriarty.
Irene was still trying to gather her wits about her. After a rush of knowing she’d beaten Sherlock, procured information for Moriarty to save Kate, orgasmed quite nicely, and seen her two pets play together for the first time, she was more than a little bit overwhelmed. But that was all to be put behind her now. She knew what she had to do.
“You’ve got to stop doing that.” John frowned before coming over to put a hand on his shoulder. “Please? It’s not doing you a bit of good. Just making things even more messy.”
He’d found himself unable to look away. John’s face, the way he smiled. There was just something in his eyes, so perfect, so lovely.
Irene glanced back at Kate still fast asleep. “Oh I can’t even remember his name…not sure he would have had a chance to say it with the gag in anyhow…so it’s really no matter. Now, what was it you wanted?”
Sherlock stared for a long moment, trying to figure out what to do. Had he been foolish not to tell Molly? He’d hoped to not have to admit his embarrassing mistakes, but maybe that was what needed to happen.
She especially liked the little tart who acted all horrified that Sherlock had known the body by proportions rather than a facial recognition. She was a pretty thing, Irene thought, as her eyes traveled over the rather unrevealing lab coat. She’d have to do something about little miss Molly Hooper in good time—or rather she’d do Miss Molly Hooper in good time. Convince her Sherlock wasn’t worth pursuing…that he was already taken…or at least make the pretty pathologist question her sexuality a little.
There was the same buzzing sound and then Sherlock was looking puzzled. A lump went down John’s throat as he realized what that meant. Sure enough the woman’s smirk was even more impressive.
Sherlock did his best to read the people he passed. Quite the wide array overall, but he caught a whiff of a few scandals that he might let Mycroft know about if the man was being good. He did deserve a little more help after all. Especially with the treat of the ballet tickets.
“Not at all,” he said, cutting her off before she could add she needed to go over notes before biology lab. She smiled and let him continue, noting that his hands were shaking a little.
John was trying to focus on eating. But it was hard. Especially with the Holmes brothers arguing over top of him.
He felt boneless. His body had completely given up trying to move or making more of an effort to clean. Sherlock sighed and let his eyes flutter shut again. Hopefully in the morning this would all be over. John was right. All he needed was a little bit of sleep.
“Adopted,” Donovan clarified. “The Holmes’ family decided to take her in when her father died. Violet Holmes was an old friend of his. And then the Holmes parents died too. I swear, they’re cursed or something. Death just follows them everywhere.”
Mary came to the table looking absolutely lovely. She was beaming at me, eyes sparkling. I couldn’t stop myself from thinking ahead, to years of happiness for the both of us. She was truly the most magnificent woman I’d ever met in my life.
It only took a few tugs before it was over. Sherlock crying out and pulsing into his hand. John felt himself throb desperately, but he didn’t dare do anything about it. This was about information. It wasn’t about his pleasure.
He couldn’t imagine what that would do to his reputation. After all, boys like Sherlock Holmes who did things like ballet tended to be lumped into… well…categories. He thought of how Donovan herself often called Holmes a freak. Yes, he couldn’t deal with that kind of pressure.
“Oh I have no doubt. I thought she’d be perfect. Sort of a feminine replication of Sherlock. Give him a little extra confusion,” Irene said with a smile. “And she’s promised lots of videos and information and all that. She really is darling. We’ll have to three-way again sometime.”
Irene sighed as she watched from the window. She’d been tempted to go to the hospital and see Sherlock’s reaction herself. But this was more important. She had to keep an eye out. Make sure Kate didn’t do anything stupid.
“Getting back at him for what he did to me,” Donovan said with a shrug. “Yes. Bastard deserves it. Here… scatter a few for me. And on top of that I’ve made a few social media threads too. News should get out pretty soon.”
Reminder as well…if you haven’t seen the movie 10 Things I Hate About You…you might miss references. I’m not saying you need to, but might be difficult without.
She shrugged. “I’m not sure what I could have missed. I know it was on my neck when I arrived home. And the money was there too up until I went to bed.” She paused and gave him a warm smile. “Why don’t you come sit next to me and Sissy, Dr. Watson? I promise she doesn’t bite…though I can’t make quite the same promise for me.” She gave a wink.
“Alright,” Sherlock said, not looking up as he tucked his phone away. Another case, another distraction. It was a good idea. However, he was stopped from making any move to grab John’s laptop by yet another moan coming from his pocket.
John wasn’t interested. He had been fussing over Jeanette all evening. His fourth girlfriend in half a year. That was what John wanted. Some pretty woman. Someone to one day marry and have a semi-normal relationship with…have children and a little house and a loving family… John would never want him.
“Oh no, Christmas is canceled,” John said, unable to think of anything more creative or clever to say. He was secretly pleased Sherlock was looking at his blog. The amount the detective passed it off as trivial had been annoying, but apparently he did think it worthy of a check every so often.
His gaze didn’t waver as he stared at the image. This was becoming a bit absurd, he knew, but without any other clues this was where he had to turn. And this was the key. If he solved the puzzle of the phone, he’d have Adler out of his life. And with her gone he could focus his attention on John…
John sighed and grabbed his phone, walking out the door into the hallway to make the call. He caught sight of Kate stretched out to the side and paused to check. She was still alive, only unconscious. Satisfied with that he turned back to making the call.
About an hour later, Sherlock reappeared, but it was only to grab his coat and scarf before heading out the door. John tried to ask if he wanted company, but his answer was no. John did his best to not act too hurt, grabbing his fifth drink of the night and settling back next to Jeanette. It was around that time he had a call from Mycroft. He apologized to the company and went to take it.
“Just a bit oblivious at times I suppose,” Irene said with a shrug. “Not really too surprising. Now tell me. What’s this about?”
Hmm, but if John was out that left him plenty of room to experiment however he liked. Not a bad idea really. Should he try to figure out what the chemicals he’d had forced into him were? Or should he try looking into the phone number from which Irene had texted him? Really, that was a good mystery in itself. Figuring out why she was playing this cat and mouse game, what was in it for her. Was this simply the mode she operated in? He supposed she had something attractive about her, but nothing that really struck his fancy…not that anything usually did.
“I’ll just change the sound,” Sherlock suggested at long last, deciding this was a better alternative than continuing to grill John. He’d keep an eye on him though. Just in case this was real.
Her eyes sparkled. “We all have our reasons, Mr. Holmes. I had mine. Just like you have yours. I told you…love can be a disadvantage.”
Donovan sighed and looked towards him again. “Let’s just say…we’ve had students not come back to school who’ve pissed him off. Even buried one last year. Nothing proven of course. But…well you must understand how it looks.”
He pulled John’s chair out for him, helped him with his coat (and earned another look for it). He sat down and looked into John’s eyes and asked him how his day was. There was a touch of incredulity in John’s face as he simply settled for saying it was fine. Sherlock was about to press for more details when the owner ambled over to their table.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Moriarty said. “Is there any chance we could convince Sherlock to take his medication before class? Or has he just fallen too far out of reality and needs to be institutionalized?”
Sherlock floundered for a moment, thinking of the phone still tucked in his coat pocket. He did indeed have a case. But tonight was special. This wasn’t just an average dinner with John. This was…a date? He wanted it to be a date. And when one was on a date they typically ate. He frowned and looked down at the table before coming up with a suitable answer.
“Oh whoops,” Sherlock said in a monotone. “Silly me. Appears I was a little too quick. Unfortunate accident. Suppose we all have them from time to time.”
“You ought to. He’ll help you. You should hold onto him while you can,” Irene said. “You never know when you’ll lose—” She broke off though Sherlock couldn’t place if it was because they’d arrived in Mycroft’s office, or because she’d begun to say too much.
Lestrade’s jaw had dropped. “Hang on, is that…no…couldn’t be…Sherlock is that a… who’re you seeing?”
He tried his best to silence her, snaking his tongue into her mouth and affectively quieting some of the louder noises. His hands reached for the clasp on her bra, undoing it and allowing it to fall to the floor.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stuck his phone back in his pocket. He turned back to John who was still staring at his neck.
“Just fifteen minutes,” he whispered. “Got to keep you alive. It’ll be all right.” He paused for a moment, readying himself for what came next. “I’m sorry, Sherlock.”
“Of course I’m not,” Irene said with a smile. “So I’ll be expecting a repeat of Rome in the next few days.”
He went to sit at his chair and folded his hands. There was so much to think about. So many factors to consider in all of this. Perhaps he’d done the wrong thing, but in the heat of the moment it had been a bit hard to think rationally…the one time he could ever really say that. But what had happened was in the past and could not be changed now. All he could do was consider his future possibilities and make his decisions from there.
Jeanette offered Sherlock something to eat, and he lost his concentration when he heard Sherlock use the name Sarah. It set off memories of Cindi again…how he’d called out the wrong name. Blast, no. He wasn’t losing another girlfriend because of Sherlock bloody Holmes. He and Jeanette hadn’t even had sex yet. He wasn’t going to have things end so soon.
“Can’t. Wait.” Sherlock pressed the end call button and slid a hand over his forehead. He looked back up in time to see Watson still staring at him. With a sigh he hopped out of his car and walked back towards the book store. Well, while he waited for Mycroft to figure out a way out of this situation, he’d simply peruse a few more volumes he’d skipped earlier.
Blog. Email. Porn. Searching a recipe for pasta. Porn. A map search of a restaurant address. Youtube. Porn. News. Some dreadful social site Sherlock was sure to avoid. A dating service. Porn—
“I still maintain that he is clearly having delusions. Likely drug induced or perhaps just the usual case of schizophrenia,” Sherlock muttered. “My deductions were not the root cause.”
“Now the party at Anderson’s,” Donovan said casually. “Perfect opportunity to take out Holmes. Sound good?”
“Now, we put our next move to work,” Irene said over her shoulder, busy at her vanity putting on a fresh bit of makeup. Kate watched as she expertly added a perfect line around the rim of her eyes. Sometimes it felt like there was nothing Irene wasn’t good at. Now if only she could speed up the little game they were playing on Holmes and Watson.
“Well, it just puts me in an awkward position,” John said. “You know, having to either be with her and having you constantly texting me, or having her here feeling unwelcome with your cold shoulder.”
John turned red again, and Sherlock realized that might have taken things a bit too far, especially considering that suggested something sexual when there wasn’t anything like that between them. Perhaps he should back off a bit, it was unlikely John had slept with Irene. And besides, the thought bothered him enough he decided he’d prefer to just forget about it.
. He’d had so many puzzles. But none worse than the man in his flat. None more meaningful or interesting to him.
“Good. I’m sure it shouldn’t be that much of a challenge for you,” Moriarty said. “Getting Sherlock to solve it for you.”
“Right, I’m going to go out for a bit,” John muttered, grabbing his plate and taking it towards the kitchen. If Sherlock heard him he didn’t respond. He kept playing. Until a soft sigh from the table broke his concentration.
John felt his breath catch. "Then it's all right? We'll just…work through it? I'm sure I'll move on eventually you know. I'll find someone else and we'll get married and it will all be fine."
Sherlock shrugged and reached out to put a hand to John’s face. The doctor froze up, staring at the detective.
Irene hung up without another word. She stood for a moment, considering. Risky, but it had worked. Now she had a month. It didn’t seem like nearly enough time, but it would have to do.
Lestrade sighed and just looked away. He wasn’t willing to admit being wrong just yet. Not when he hadn’t tried anything.
He listened on as she gave her demands. He tried to imagine what might be on that list. Money of course. Lots of it by the sound of things. Escape. A change of identity. But there had to be something else too. Was this really what Irene Adler was after? Money? It didn’t fit. The motives just didn’t suit her. And he knew if his name was on the list Mycroft probably would already be protesting. So what else could there be?
Her eyes scanned over him, and he smiled as he pulled the last few pieces together. His checkmate was ready.
Nonetheless, he had agreed to help Mycroft. Why he wasn't sure, but for now he'd stick with his original agreement. He was a man of his word. And besides, for some ridiculous reason he was set on trying to help Sherlock Holmes. And if trying to figure out how to make him better with the help of Mycroft worked, then so be it.
“Twice,” Irene added, smirking. “Or perhaps you’d be more compliant with John having you. I’m fairly certain he could make you beg if he wanted to. In fact I’m quite sure of it.”
“Do you ever wonder if there’s something wrong with us?” Sherlock asked. Anything to make his brother not suspect what he was thinking. He couldn’t let his brother know he’d actually come to care. No. Mycroft would berate him to no end. Sentiment was a defect. He knew that better than anyone.
"I did mean it, you know," Irene whispered, looking up into her eyes. "I love you so much, my beautiful lovely Kate."
Irene jerked awake to a jarring noise. She pulled herself half off the sofa to look around the room, eyeing the various corners of the tiny hotel room, only to become satisfied that she was indeed alone. After a long moment she realized it was her phone.
“Oh, just tricky with last names you know. Well, it is for everyone in the modern world I suppose,” Irene said with a wave of her hand. “But I rather like Hamish Holmes. Has a nice ring to it. Were you thinking surrogate or adoption?”
"John," Sherlock muttered. "I believe we might find more satisfaction in removing our trousers and pants. Or had you planned to simply rut upon each other while clothed?"
"No Sherlock always replies," John said, mind reeling. "He's Mr. Punchline. He will outlive God trying to have the last word."
“Come Mr. Holmes. It might even save your life,” Irene said before nodding to John. “Or his. Take your pick.”
“Your face is flushed, your pupils dilated, your breathing erratic. If I took your pulse I guarantee that would be higher too. I did this with the woman, John. Do you really not believe it will work on you too?” He gives this little half smile I’ve grown so fond of, and it proves his point, my heart leaping in my chest, stomach twisting almost painfully.
Irene thought her heart might have stopped beating for real. There were so many words in her mind, yet none would work on her tongue.
He was still walking. Sherlock looked over his shoulder again at the car and then sighed and put his car in reverse. With a quick tap of his foot he was careening backwards, and as expected he felt the telltale jerk as his car made contact, and then a dreadful crash of metal meeting metal, a screech as Moriarty’s car was pushed backwards.
He headed to the stairs in favor of not having to look at John any further. Not give away the fact that he was
I was originally going to have the phone passcode be Johnlocked but I figured that was too much. And no, I didn't add any attempts on the phone. He didn't try the one in Molly's lab that he does in the show.
Irene settled back in her chair again, eyes flashing between the two of them. Her smile had only grown in the last minute, but thankfully she did clarify what she meant.
She released him and he disappeared. Lestrade sighed and leveled his gaze back at the remaining contenders. They all looked a little unsettled, but hadn’t moved otherwise.
“We know what you’re trying to do,” Donovan said, raising her voice a little over the noise of the tools. “With Sherlock Holmes.”
He trailed along, stopped by a pretty girl practically jumping onto him. Jeanine wasn’t that her name? Jeanette? He couldn’t remember. Regardless he wasn’t interested at the moment, so he smiled and offered her a seat instead before continuing on after Sherlock.
Sherlock wanted to murmur some kind of soft reassurance, but instead he kept his face neutral. “I expect so,” he said. He did his best to keep the gun pointed and the phone up, even though he wished he had a free hand. Some means of touching John… “Now go.”
“You’re not afraid of me, are you?” Watson asked, before Sherlock could say a deduction that was coming to mind.
“As I asked, date Sherlock Holmes. Might even make it worth your while. Sure the bills are stacking up with Harriet. Could probably use some extra money.”
He stalked over to the other side of the room, picking up the gun and pointing it at his captive. A tremor shook his hand as he thought about John…about the threat just made to the man he loved. But he couldn’t lose control. With that in mind he grabbed for his phone as well.
“Well, he is certainly playing the right part,” Irene said with a half-smile. “He knows how to work the Holmes family.”
With a sigh he stroked Sherlock’s hair back from his face and wondered for the umpteenth time how he’d managed to get himself into this situation.
“Go ahead and kiss his neck a little, John,” Irene instructed. “Give him another of those gorgeous love bites.”
“It depends on the topic. My fenders don’t really whip me into a verbal frenzy,” he said with a shrug.
After feeling satisfied that Mrs. Hudson was all right, even if she did continue crying, he went over to haul the American up onto one of the chairs. He proceeded to find the duct tape and strap him to the chair.
"No. You pretended for my sake. And you supported me…but you hated it," Irene said. "And I always knew, but I always…I ignored it. Because I was afraid."
She knew it was necessary. Moriarty and the CIA were both closing in. Neither would care about Kate really. Not so long as Irene wasn’t with her…not so long as Irene was…
There was a flash of red in his vision. All she’d put Sherlock through and still all she cared about was her precious phone.
"You know Mycroft could just phone me," he grumbled under his breath. "If he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex."
Sherlock grabbed his things and went towards the door feeling his temper bubbling just below the surface of his skin. He made sure to give Moriarty a good shove as he left, hearing Mrs. Hudson’s clicks of disapproval as he went.
“Wait who did I call then?” John asked, blinking a few times. “Hold on, you’re saying it wasn’t Sarah either? Whose name came out of my mouth?”
John whispered it. He leaned in to kiss his helpful assistant before pulling out of his mind palace entirely.
Mycroft’s gaze was on him, a mixture of disappointment and frustration. Irene too was looking at him, though she was continuing to give him her famous smirk.
He'd woken up on the couch with a massive hangover. His head was pounding, he could barely sit up. But when he had managed to finally push himself up a bit he'd discovered some amount of stickiness in his pants…like he'd tried to clean himself up and had failed. John had vague recollections about some dream with Sherlock again…pushing him down onto the bed and having his way with him. Mmm…
It was over almost as soon as it had begun. Sherlock was pulling away, leaving John gasping and alone and confused. The fog of alcohol made it easy to just focus on the sensations, but deep down something in John knew that he needed to say something, not just lean in and kiss Sherlock again.
“I think things have become a bit more interesting,” Irene agreed. “But with our next week of changing locations, I don’t know that I’ll mind waiting a bit for the speed to pick up. Don’t you worry, Kate. We’ll have them both.”
His eyes closed, and he did his best to drift into his mind palace, look at something more pleasant than his memories of John. Something distracting.
"Do you not want to do this?" John finally asked. "Shit, I've messed up haven't I? You don't want to have sex and here I am pressuring you to do something you don't…" he broke off with another curse.
"I don't know, Mrs. Hudson. I've never been able to wrestle any answers out of him," he said. "But he and Adler do seem to be close, I'll give them that."
"Maybe," John said, unwilling to tell her outright that she clearly was. What else explained Sherlock's strange behavior the last few months.
Sherlock shot him a sharp glare but said nothing. He kept picturing Mycroft’s cold gaze the last time he’d sent a student to the hospital. No, he was not going to allow himself to lose control. Not now. Not when he had his future in his sights.
When he returned to Baker street he could tell the moment he walked into the flat that something was wrong.
He threw himself into lovemaking. Enjoying Cindi’s obvious pleasure, reveling in still being able to declare himself not gay as he made love to a woman. After all, what did Sherlock have that someone like Cindi didn’t? She was kind and funny and beautiful. She had the curves, breasts, softness that he liked normally. Sherlock would be all hard muscle and awkward angles and…why the hell did that turn him on?
However, just as he was thinking of hanging up to take care of Mrs. Hudson the door opened and John strode in.
He scanned over the crowd, noting no one of real interest until at long last his gaze settled on John Watson. Oh. Oh that was interesting. Quite good in fact.
I blinked a few times. Was that really what I needed? There on that pointless little DVD? Him just sitting there telling me he was sorry he left. It was nice in some ways. But the last part was what threw me.
Sherlock was scowling at the pavement by the time he got downstairs. The detective didn’t even bother looking at him. Merely set about hailing a cab.
And then he was hitting the final button. There it was. He turned to show her, watching her face as she saw the letters he’d chosen.
The detective ignored him and continued inspecting the windows. Lestrade just sighed and checked his phone instead.
“Jesus, Sherlock, is there any way you can turn that bloody thing down, or is the whole world going to have to hear me—well can’t you silence it or something.”
Sherlock had brought her here after the rescue in Karachi. She'd been startled when they'd been welcomed into the house by Kate at first, though she quickly discovered that Sherlock had contacted her a month before, and he'd done some kind of miraculous job at explaining the circumstances.
However, as the younger boy stalked off he was forced to note Watson still standing there smirking at Holmes’s retreating arse.
Molly sighed. “It’s a party, not a mafia meeting Mycroft,” she muttered. She grabbed her own coat and smiled at Mary. “But I’ll be sure to have fun if that’s what you’re asking.”
Rolling over she glanced back towards the computer just in time to see movement on the screen. Kate groaned when she pushed her aside, but Irene had to get closer, had to see. She pressed the volume button, turning it up so she could hear as well.
“Are you really going to just give up on doing anything with your life?” Molly asked, eyebrows furrowed. “But Mr. Stanford was telling me how well you do in his biology lab. He mentioned that you’d been talking about apiology. Or perhaps you’d find something in chemistry more suitable. Or even your violin to be honest. You’re quite good at that.”
Molly assured him her place was close enough to walk, so he led his bike on foot, following after her.
She ran her fingers over her dresser, wondering if Moriarty was already aware of her little plan. Most likely. She wasn’t sure that boded well for her or her boys.
“Is it a vanilla night?” Kate asked, cocking her head to the side even as she continued to give the most adoring smile.
Irene strutted over to the doorway and paused, glancing back towards the screen one last time, longingly admiring another furtive glance from Sherlock. So perfect. She licked her lips.
“We’re really not,” John said. “Erm…I’m going to go tend to Sherlock now if that’s alright…you know in a…non gay sort of way…”
She gave a feeble smile and nodded. “At least if he’s happy that’s something. As I said, I suppose I don’t have much to live for anymore.”
Sherlock put a finger to his lips. "That's not necessary, John. For tonight…start on top. We can negotiate other possibilities in the future. But for now let's keep it simple. Would you do the honor of taking me, John Watson?"
"Your brother," John said. "Wanted me to tell you about her and her death and all. You were right, your plan worked."
She swore loudly and shook her head, staring down at the mess before glancing up with her beautiful intelligent eyes.
“I’ll take you somewhere different,” John said, taking a few quicker strides to catch up with the taller boy. “I’ll…show you a good time.” He let his voice drop a little lower, trying to make his meaning clear.
“A code, obviously. I had one of the best cryptographers in the country take a look at it – though he was mostly upside down, as I recall. Couldn’t figure it out.”
“Oh, come on. It’s not code. These are seat allocations on a passenger jet. Look ...,” Sherlock said, turning the screen round to show him.
“No, just was in the laundromat and saw your car. Thought I’d come over and say hello,” Watson said with a smile.
If only she could convince Sherlock that everything he wanted was right in front of him. How someone as confident seeming as Sherlock Holmes hadn’t already declared his feelings to John Watson was beyond her. But she supposed everyone had their insecurities every now and then.
Sherlock’s hands had moved to his belt even as he continued to move to the beat. He undid the latch. He pulled the material out in a slow whisper, again throwing it into the crowd, even as his fingers moved to the button and zip of his trousers.
Getting lots of great feedback/follows/favorites so I’m feeling a push to get more chapters out...even as I feel a bit intimidated by the number of people reading this! Eek.
Textbook really. Sherlock could practically imagine Mycroft’s sneer, hear his brother’s disdainful voice decrying what he’d done as idiotic as he believed it to be.
But in a moment, he knew the answer. This was Sherlock after all. Nothing would ever be simple or normal with him, and that was what John loved about him if he was honest. His eyes opened and he stepped forward to smile at Sherlock.
“You’d better,” he said. “Or daddy’s going to get very angry. Daddy doesn’t like waiting, Irene. You’d best get it soon.”
“Just happy to be home after a long day,” Sherlock said, pausing as he realized this was perhaps a bit much. On seeing John’s puzzled expression he added, “Dinner?”
She smiled, hand tightening on him some. “You’re a fool to not see it, Sherlock Holmes.” Her eyes trailed over him.
Trust Irene Adler to make things completely awkward between them. If only Sherlock wasn’t asexual, everything might work right. He could just explain how he was feeling and maybe they could—it was absurd, but still John’s mind lingered on the possibility. Sherlock was probably one of his best friends. He was amusing and brave, intelligent, creative, a bit of an arse but otherwise and impressive man. John couldn’t deny there was something undeniably attractive about Sherlock, beyond just physical characteristics that he’d recently begun to admire.
“Take Sherlock Holmes on a date,” Moriarty said. “Should be simple enough. Get him to spread his legs if you’d like. I could care less. But the main thing is I need him out of the picture so I can have Molly Holmes.”
He jerked up and looked towards Sherlock, who again pulled his phone out to look at it before putting it away. Mrs. Hudson saw fit to comment on how “rude” it was, but Sherlock still offered no defense.
“And she told us she locked the door first thing when she got home,” Lestrade interrupted. “There’s no sign anyone picked the lock or anything. Dead bolt was still on when she woke up. The windows in the place only open a couple of inches.”
, he tried to tell himself. His eyes shut, and he tried to imagine it was his last girlfriend he was kissing instead of Sherlock. But even the fantasy was not enough to destroy the reality.
“Well worry about yourself. You’ll strain that mind of yours overthinking everything,” he snapped. “I’m going out. I’ll be back later.”
…there was only one person I could keep thinking about. There was only one voice that kept taunting me while I worked. I kept thinking of the one person who truly makes me ever feel humbled…has made me feel human…”
As she was pondering there was suddenly another noise from the desk. She looked at her phone again and sighed. Molly Hooper calling back? Perhaps the precious thing had changed her mind on her offer.
Well, the changes to the room were obvious. Drugs sweep. Mrs. Hudson had done some of it, because she always dusted off whatever she was searching too. Nervous habit of hers. John’s movements, however, more clumsy. So both of them had been looking. Why?
He slammed the door for good measure, even though he was angrier with Mycroft, and Irene Adler, and himself than either John or Mrs. Hudson.
Just as she was moving onto the tube her phone beeped. She frowned and pulled out the burner she still had. The message flashing on the screen was almost enough to make her drop the mobile.
She turned to look out the window, and he was well aware she was closing the conversation. He let his mind puzzle over her words. She’d said them to him regarding John. But here she was admitting this was her own weakness. Her own pressure point…one he could potentially use against her.
I arrived early, started a look through the wine selection while extremely distracted. The waiter kept hovering around and didn’t seem to give me much help at all when it came to choosing.
Mycroft wasn’t home yet, so he grabbed a chemistry book and settled down on the couch to read with a cigarette in his hand. He could hear music from Molly’s room and knew better than to even approach her when her door was closed. She’d either be absorbed in the latest Glee episode or studying for the next biology exam. Neither was a time to interrupt her.
That set off a series of images of Molly in various states of undress. He quickly had to clear his mind before any problems might arise. He groaned and refocused on the hallway in time to see Sherlock Holmes marching by with a young woman at his side.
She stood and reached out a hand. For a moment Moriarty considered biting it. He pictured breaking that soft looking skin and watching blood run down. Tempting indeed.
“Thank you,” she said. “Also, would you like my number? Wouldn’t mind seeing you again, Dr. Watson. I’m sure we could find lots of other mysteries for you to solve,” she said with a small wink.
“No,” John mumbled and leaned back in to plant a few more fleeting kisses on Sherlock’s mouth and jaw and even his nose. “Sex. Now.”
Why flee when there was nothing left to fight for? It was obvious Moriarty had won. There was nothing left for her. No matter where she ran he would find her. And at this point the toll had become too much. So what options did she have left?
“Most valuable stuff is probably on his cell, but I see tickets to the ballet for this Friday. Microft probably procured them to get Sherlock off his back. Hmm… I’ll snap some photos of the books he’s been reading. And there’s probably some music over on the nightstand if you want to have a look. Overall, not much more information here.”
stopped playing in the middle of a piece unless there was an emergency or—well something important was happening. John was used to having to wait until breaks in pieces to get his attention, even then sometimes the detective was in the mood and wouldn’t stop.
He made a soft shushing noise and kissed me again. “I have had my last fall. My last one I ever intend to have if things go as planned.” He stared at me for a long moment. “Oh come, John, you don’t see it? Why my last and greatest fall is this…falling for you.”
No it was unthinkable. Sherlock barely restrained an eye roll at the thought. Dear god, did Mycroft think he’d developed some kind of feelings for Irene Adler? Well, perhaps the man was right. She was different. But whatever feelings there were simply remained ones of fascination and perhaps a touch of admiration. But when he thought of Irene nothing in his body remotely stirred. He reacted as one normally would to any normal person. It wasn’t like John…
“Mycroft, you might want to look into our insurance policy,” he said, doing his best to keep his smile at bay.
It felt like ages before he finally wrestled Sherlock's shirt off. By that time the detective's fingers were working at the bottom of his jumper, pulling it up and over his head. John took a moment to admire Sherlock's toned chest before he fell back on him for more passionate kisses.
For anyone wondering Cindi was my interpretation of “the one with the spots” Sherlock lists when trying to figure out who is John’s latest girlfriend. Thought that would be fun.
“Oh my god, you don’t even know what you did,” she guffawed. “Some boyfriend you are. Can’t even moan the right name, you bloody bastard. Get out!”
“I’ve got plans,” he said, shooting a look at Jeanette. He had drunk enough that he was almost willing to tell Mycroft exactly what those plans entailed.
“Now, if you’re done bothering me with meaningless triviliaties, perhaps you’d like me to solve this case.”
“Oh you naughty naughty girl,” he said, and she could hear the smirk in his voice. “Who’ve you been screwing this time?”
She shook her head. “He loves you. He might deny it. But he does. I promise. If you ask him in a straightforward manner and confess how you feel you’ll get your answer. But it doesn’t take a genius to see the way he looks at you.”
Lestrade just stared after her as she continued towards another doorway. He simply allowed Donovan’s words to fade into the back of his mind. Past history was of little consequence to him. He’d find a way to win her, no matter what it took.
He stalked off, leaving her to consider what he’d said. It would be nice to go to the party if he really was looking forward to seeing her. Perhaps she could get him to discuss the finer points of Glee, instead of making it sound like all she liked were the cute guys and songs.
He pushed past Moriarty who was still leering at Sherlock. He headed outside, still keeping a tight grip on Sherlock. It was a bit awkward with how tall he was, but John managed.
John settled back on the sofa and asked Shannon a few more questions. Mostly he just admired the way the dressing robe emphasized her lovely curves. She was very pretty. And from the way she kept smiling at him, he was getting the idea she was keen too.
“We’re here to give you that information you wanted,” Donovan said, taking a seat on the stool next to his. “So, here’s Sherlock’s schedule. Molly got a look at it while he was distracted. Reading list. Music he likes. He also enjoys Italian food when he eats. Otherwise his passions are anatomy, and chemistry… and dance as you probably already knew.”
John wasn’t even sure why he’d decided to spend time in the sports hall. He was sitting on the bleachers, thinking about all the work he’d have to do for school once he arrived home. Sure, his nonchalant attitude was fun to try on the teachers and made him quite the legend around his fellow students, but he was determined to actually finish his schooling. After all, it would take more if he ever wanted to become a doctor.
The worst was the final one, the confrontation of feelings I needed in my life but that found me in sleep instead.
“Oh, my apologies,” Sherlock said. “So sorry. Why don’t you go change, I’ll clean this mess up and continue investigating.”
As he leaned in to kiss his friend again, Sherlock pulled back again. John opened his mouth to protest, to say it was all right. To say he was just relieved that he wasn’t going insane and that Sherlock wanted him over Molly or Irene. But before he could Sherlock said the most heart-breaking words of the night.
She was a very lovely woman, Mary. And I was so glad to have her with me. For a while, I started to forget about my dear Sherlock. And then Lestrade popped by one day for absolutely no reason…with a box of Sherlock’s possessions, most importantly a DVD with a note he’d left for my birthday.
He removed his coat and picked up his instrument, just in time to see John coming in with another drink in his hand. He shook his head, wondering why John was still choosing to abuse alcohol after their Christmas fiasco.
Sherlock ran through the possibilities quickly. Girlfriend—there hadn’t been one in weeks. Work—he’d already said no on that. Shopping—the kitchen had looked well stocked enough this morning. Hmm…friends? He hadn’t been out with anyone recently…hadn’t said anything either.
Lestrade paused, mouth still half open. Donovan watched as his eyes roamed over the ground before his jaw snapped shut.
Sherlock snorted. “Well judging by the rumpled shirt you clearly wore overnight, I’d say your idea of one-night alcohol filled sex is not far off from Hemingway. So yes, perhaps you’d see a touch of ‘romance’ in such a notion. Hemingway continues to demonstrate to me the most crucial of ideas. Love is weakness. Jake Barnes is only weak because he allows himself to love Lady Brett Ashley and because he falls for the classic notion that a man’s only strength is in his penis rather than his brain. Were he to disavow himself of these ridiculous notions, the whole drama might have been cut rather short don’t you think?”
"I don't know what you want, but I can promise I'm not going to help you. I have no reason to help you," he said.
It took Lestrade only a few more minutes to arrive. Apparently he’d deemed himself the least annoying of his officers. Sherlock was inclined to agree. And of course an ambulance was there as well, paramedics rushing over to pick the American up and strap him to a gurney. Sherlock did his best to appear worried, even as a small smirk crept onto his face.
One of Sherlock's long fingered hands came up to caress his cheek. John jerked a bit at first, stilling only when he saw Sherlock smile.
Sure, every bloke has a good cry every now and then. Those who say otherwise are lying. But this was different than the occasional little emotional moment. It wasn’t a few tears or a little sniffling, but wrenching sobs that shook every bit of me to the core. It was realizing that the person I’d come to care for in spite of all his aggravating qualities was gone for good, and there was no getting him back. I ended up falling asleep on the floor, no energy left to even drag myself to bed.
Greg was not happy when he watched Sherlock stalk away from Watson. In all honesty, he’d assumed it would be much easier than that. If Holmes really was gay, Watson seemed like he’d be quite the handsome bloke. Shouldn’t he have accepted?
He hadn’t anticipated this. Out of all of the deductions he could possibly make, this was the one that he’d failed to see.
He could picture his brother straightening up, voicing getting a little sharper. “Why? What’s happened?”
He leaned in closer to John, admiring the familiar smells of John’s aftershave, deodorant, shampoo, but also the muskier scent that was purely his. The smell of John. He breathed it in for just a moment, well aware that John would grow impatient if he took too long. But this was his chance. A moment he could enjoy being close to this man he’d come to feel attracted to…
Irene smirked again, but beneath her confidence he could catch something else. Sorrow perhaps. She was a tricky thing, Ms. Adler. He’d riddled her over a hundred times now, but that still hadn’t changed the fact that he still felt there was so much more of her behind all the boldness. He tried to picture her younger. A little girl perhaps. Wasn’t that the sort of thing John would do? What had made her the way she was?
“Never fear, darling. A little patience is all this game requires. Now, I must be off to see that client. You’ll be alright for another hour, won’t you?” Irene asked, glancing her over with obvious care.
The thought seemed to open a door in his memory palace, one he tried to normally keep firmly shut. Memories of his adolescence swarmed him. Thoughts of confusion when he had his first wet dream, many years later than most boys probably would. The elation of realizing he wasn’t a total freak, while at the same time wondering what this would mean for his future. Would he become a slave to his desires like so many men (and probably some women) were? Would he be able to find someone who would be interested in having sex with him? Would he find someone who
“Fine,” Sherlock muttered, setting the instrument aside. He went to sit in his chair again, steepling his fingers and doing his best to descend into the recesses of his mind where there might be something to comfort him. Why must John torment him this way?
And while he’d driven me up the wall, there were qualities about him I couldn’t help but find admirable. Bloody hell it sounds stupid, but it’s true.
Taking a deep breath John ventured back out. None of them were paying attention to him though, as Sherlock appeared to be picking up something on the mantle piece. John caught sight of a red package sitting there. He hadn’t noticed it before, but Sherlock had scooped it up and was making a hasty retreat back to the bedroom.
“Oh please,” Sherlock muttered. “Rich bored trophy wives? Surely you wouldn’t be all that interested in them.”
Mycroft left as Sherlock took up his violin. John sat a moment listening to the soft lilting melody of “God Save the Queen.” Normally he’d just listen a bit and probably head out if the noise started to bother him. But today he couldn’t help but stare at his flatmate, intrigued by how intimate and sensual violin playing could appear.
“Not like yours,” Sherlock muttered. “But then again, we can’t all drug unsuspecting girls at parties now can we?”
“Well that’s understandable that a virgin might not understand the importance of sex,” Moriarty quipped with a grin to one of his cronies. “Feeling a little exposed through Jake’s story are we, Sherlock?”
Well the resolutions to the party will have to wait a bit. I'm off to England for two weeks so it might be a bit, but hopefully I can do some writing on the road.
John glanced back towards the sitting room, but he saw no indication that Sherlock was paying them the slightest speck of attention. He took another drink.
After a few minutes he sat up and took the coat and scarf off, tossing them carelessly onto the floor. And then his shoes, kicking them off equally violently.
“Please don’t feel obliged to tell me that was remarkable or amazing. John’s expressed the same thought in every possible variant available to the English language,” Sherlock said, looking bored.
He could hear her smirk in her tone. “Haven’t I? As I said, the information on your little plot serves me little good though. It’s already out. Already destroyed. But I have other files you’d be interested in too…alongside those pictures of your client you’d rather not have exposed.”
“And John’s moans? I know you didn’t sleep with him, even if Sherlock had a hissy fit in his jealousy.”
“Aw thank you!” Molly said with a giggle. She turned to look at Mary who was smiling and nodding at her before catching Mycroft, arms folded, brow furrowed.
He swallowed. “But…I miscalculated. There was nothing right about saying it in the moment with a dead body sitting to the side. My timing was completely off. Besides, I’ve read that you’re not supposed to say that for at least six months.”
He swallowed, difficult against the wood of the violin against his throat, but not impossible. His eyes closed, and he felt that single drop of saline glide down one cheek and drip onto the instrument. In his mind he sang the words to the song, and reflected on how much more he wanted to have the truth than ever before in his life.
“Darling, you’ll do that thing you did in Rome if I order to and you know it, but I’ll accept that bet. Best get yourself nice and ready then. I guarantee, tomorrow I’ll have my first text from Sherlock Holmes.”
“Yes,” Kate agreed. “But Dr. Watson left after only a bit. I’m not sure we’re going to get much out of him if he runs every time he’s feeling something—at least if that wasn’t a knife in his pocket.”
Of course, thanks to her excellent camera planting, she did get to see every expression on Sherlock’s face as he saw her body for the first time. It was as she’d expected, clinical. Neutral. But what else would a gay man do when looking at a woman’s dead body? Any other reaction would have been problematic.
John only hesitated a moment before pulling Mrs. Hudson up and leading her to the door. Their eyes met momentarily, and Sherlock swallowed, doing his best to retain some semblance of control when all he wanted was to move forward and pull John into a kiss.
He tried again to think back to Christmas Eve. Everything was fuzzy. He had some vague recollections of the party, and Sherlock being an arse especially to Molly. He knew Irene Adler had been found dead, and he'd broken up with Jeanette due to his need to stay with Sherlock due to it being a danger night.
"Some lotion that has served its purpose for the occasional session of masturbation," Sherlock said. "But I certainly don't keep condoms. I've never really had a use for them other than the possible odd experiment."
Sherlock stared at him for a moment. Those words were not what he’d expected to hear. And for a moment, the surprise almost caught him off guard. But in another moment he was back on his feet, working his deductions.
“Ask him,” she said softly. “If he still declines you, then you can come back to me, pop the question. We’ll be married in peace. But I can’t sit here and have you wondering all the rest of your life if there ever would have been something more.”
I couldn’t decide whether to laugh or to cry. Every emotion on the human spectrum seemed to be flashing through me at once. Little bits and pieces set me off. His brazen apathy, his uncaring tone. And yet his stern face, those familiar eyes that I’d only seen in dreams as of late. A smile half twitched on my lips, only to be stifled as he continued on.
“I don’t see why we have to read this drivel anyways,” Sherlock muttered. “This whole class is a waste of time. I should be studying for chemistry right now.”
He was silent another long while. His eyes had wandered over to the windows and he was looking out, considering perhaps. I was only awaiting his polite decline. Or perhaps not so polite…there was no telling with him.
John just shrugged and went back to silently waiting for the cab. He wondered when, if ever, things would feel normal between the two of them again.
After a long moment, she finally picked up the phone. Irene raised it to her lips, hardly trusting her voice.
Molly was relatively surprised when her brother’s head appeared from the kitchen doorway. She would have expected him to be locked up in his room by now, trying his best to forget that weekends existed. He stepped into the room, folding his arms in a perfect imitation of Mycroft, though admittedly with a tighter purple shirt instead of the fancy suit jacket.
Regardless all of those didn't suit John's desires. He wanted Sherlock for himself.. But at the same time he knew in a moment that some things came at a price. And to buy Sherlock's happiness he would sacrifice his own.
She generally found herself more inclined towards the fairer sex, but that didn’t mean she hadn’t found men who interested or attracted her. To define sexuality was to limit sexuality. And limits were really only something Irene needed in bed, and even those were meant to be tested.
Molly just looked at him and sighed. She looked up at Mycroft again, though it was clear she had no real defense to offer.
It was true. It didn’t. Not anymore. As a boy, yes, he’d shoved his potential sexual partner away, favoring something less physical. But he’d soon learned most people expected sex where any sense of romance or partnership were found. And he’d abandoned the idea of such things long ago as a result.
"As long as you're certain we're not moving too fast?" Sherlock said. "I'm…still rather new to all this."
Watson didn’t move, just smirked and tossed his head. “Well then, maybe you like a little danger. Is that it?”
Mycroft stared at him, eyes boring into him. “In the end, are you really so obvious? Because this was textbook: the promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption; then give him a puzzle,” he sighed. “And watch him dance?”
He sighed and rolled over on the couch, wondering if he should attempt sleeping, or if work might prove a more substantial distraction.
Sherlock growled and turned away, eyes scanning over the room, trying to spot her. Where was Molly? Was she in trouble? Maybe she’d had something in her drink. Maybe she hadn’t arrived at all…perhaps there had been an accident. His thoughts were going wild.
Molly let him park his bike before showing him up the steps and into the house. She glanced around before heading upstairs to one of the first doors, clearly shut. She knocked once before opening it and looking around.
“John,” Sherlock murmured even as he tried to understand John’s slurred words. He’d broken things off with Jeanette? But why? “It’s all right. Let’s just get you back to bed, shall we?”
Were it not for the distraction of Irene’s sudden appearance, Sherlock might have scoffed at the apology. But for once, he didn’t know what to say to his brother.
“Of course not, darling. I have great plans for these two. Wondrous plans. Now, why don’t I tell you a few while you do that thing you did in Rome.”
“Suddenly one is aware of staring into ze face of an old friend…” he said with gusto. Mary had dissolved into giggles as I groaned and decided to dispense of him so I could get on with my awkward important question asking.
He nodded and pulled away without another word, still picturing Molly in Jim Moriarty’s car. His jaw clenched and he did his best to focus on the road instead of images of what the older boy would probably try to do to his sister given the chance.
Sherlock settled back in his seat as the swell of the orchestra grew and the lights dimmed, but he was not amused by the intent look that Watson was giving the stage. There was no way that boy was here for the ballet. This had to be about the silly attempts at courtship that Watson  had pulled off over the last few days.
She fell asleep not too long after that. I laid awake long into the night, staring up at the ceiling and thinking over everything that had happened. Part of me was so afraid that if I closed my eyes, it would turn out to not be real. But at long last I became too knackered to keep my focus, and I drifted off in the early morning hours.
She watched the door open and Dr. Watson come in to be surprised by the sight of Sherlock on the floor. He was mumbling things about her, until at last John pushed Sherlock back into bed and left him there.
“Enough time to create a little havoc then,” Mycroft said. He wrinkled his nose. “I thought we’d discussed smoking. If you must do it at least take it outside.”
, I handed them to him. He chuckled and looked at me with a warm smile I couldn’t help but feel a bit dizzy at receiving.
He eyed Sherlock's form by the window, trying his best to be nonchalant about it, even as he felt a spike of something warm but unmistakably melancholy as he regarded his best friend. Love, and sorrow, and arousal, and anger, and confusion all mixed into one.
“Watch it,” snapped a boy from the driver’s seat, icy blue eyes glaring at Donovan. “You might want to stop fucking Anderson, Donovan. It seems you’re unable to walk straight.”
He looked up in time to see that Molly Hooper had arrived. She was offering greetings in her usual cheery tone, a lovely lipsticked smile in place. Her arms were overflowing with bags of gifts. He came over to see if she needed help, not missing Jeanette’s glower as he did. And of course as she shed her coat he noted she looked particularly beautiful tonight in a black evening gown.
"You said you didn't," Sherlock pointed out. "After you told The Woman that you loved me you denied it…said it was to get her to act and help me."
He made a noise into my mouth and I finally withdrew, sighing as I looked up at him, wondering if this was the moment where he again rejected me, told me I wasn’t quite what he was looking for or something like that. This was Sherlock after all. This was the man who solved hundreds of cases and could look at someone and figure out their life story. This man was brilliant and beautiful, strong and stoic, handsome and humorous. Could he ever even look at me and see an equal?
She glanced around. A few decent looking guys, but nothing that was really worthy of her time. And then her gaze caught on Irene Adler.
“Thank you,” Donovan said with an eye roll. She patted his shoulder. “So trust me next time. I’m smarter than that.”
“For protection,” Irene said. “I make my way in the world; I misbehave. I like to know people will be on my side exactly when I need them to be.”
The heat in his belly had peaked. He felt a wave of pleasure wash over him as his body entered the throes of orgasm. Sherlock groaned and released into John’s hand. He felt John’s body speed up a bit and then he was moaning and going slack and Sherlock was sure he must have come in his pants.
“We set it up,” she said. “So that Lestrade could get the girl. We’re only using Moriarty for the money.”
Thank you to Blueegg713, phoenixdaisy, and feisty_one for commenting! I really appreciate the support. Thank you also to all those who have left kudos!
Perhaps he’d acted a bit rashly at the party, but he’d been so angry at the time. So upset that he had to sit by and watch John cuddle Jeanette and go have sex with her that evening. And then Molly Hooper had practically thrown herself at him, and that had been the last straw. He couldn’t take it. Not knowing that John was attached to someone else and a woman he had no interest in other than friendship was eager to be with him in more of a romantic respect.
Sherlock sighed at that. The only person he would ever let have him on a leash…well…it didn’t matter anyways…
“Perhaps,” Sherlock muttered, though he knew already that it was unlikely. After all, there would be more important things to do than find a romantic relationship.
“The heart to your brain. As you said. I suppose your little games with John and I make sense now. Living vicariously probably.” He snorted. “You said killers were after you. CIA would never have actually done away with you. Locked you up maybe. So who could that be? Why the man you mentioned earlier. Moriarty. And while he might have given you advice, I highly doubt it was free. So he wanted information? Information you did end up giving him. But at what cost? No, he had something more on you than simple helpful advice. He was the reason you faked your own death. He was the reason you ran. But it wasn’t for you. No.”
I had some really great feedback and am feeling inspired to keep going so far. Please keep up the comments if you're enjoying this! Positivity from my readers truly makes or breaks a fic for me. Anyhow, thanks again to all of you! Hope you enjoyed this chapter!
His words came out garbled. His body felt strange, heavy, his limbs suddenly unwieldy. He sat up, but jolted forward, toppling to the floor just in time for John to enter and find him lying there. His heart was racing, breath coming fast as he managed to stand, frantically looking for signs of her. She’d been here. He was certain of it. She’d been—what had she been doing? Leaning over him…something bad. Something very bad.
Irene smirked. “Oh we did. I can give you all those details later. For now, however, I want my own. Who asked you out? And what did you say?”
So, what did the evidence tell him? What could he deduce from the little he’d known? Had the drugging been for her own amusement? Had it been to prove a point? Had it been an attempt to seduce him? That seemed a bit low for someone as intelligent as Ms. Adler, but he wouldn’t put it past her. She was good at getting what she wanted. Quite good in fact.
"Just reflecting how life will go now," Irene said with a sigh, looking back at the fire before she could start staring at Kate dressed in that silky dressing gown Irene had given her three years ago for her birthday. It had always made her look lovely, that dark blue shimmery fabric. Irene felt warmth settle in her belly at the thought of Kate's soft pale curves beneath the garment. What she wouldn't give to see them again.
Sherlock awoke disoriented, mind flitting through the experiences of earlier with a great amount of frustration. How had the woman managed it? She had bested him, drugged him, taken the phone. He’d had it in his hand! Blast. He tried to sit up, wondering suddenly where he was. Did the woman keep him? He vaguely remembered her leaning over him and whispering something…something on a show…something on…
But why? How could that be? Perhaps the drug was still active. Sherlock decided to switch to another choice of stimulus. Hmmm…well who were other people he knew and seemed to like. Perhaps—Molly Hooper? Sherlock imagined her taking off her top and found this much less inspiring. His erection flagged. No, not that then. Men maybe? Lestrade? He nearly gagged at the thought, and that was enough to let him know that wouldn’t be effective. There were few other people he cared about in any capacity. So John it was.
She smirked. "Good morning. I like your funny hat. I'm sad tonight let's have dinner. You look sexy on Crimewatch. Let's have dinner. I'm not hungry, let's have dinner." She paused and looked up with a smirk. And then she continued. "John likes your funny hat. He says so on his blog. John writes such lovely things about you. Did you have dinner with John tonight? What's John wearing today. Dinner at Angelo's? Send John my love."
He stood and walked to the front door. She sat there and listened until she heard the telltale slam and then heavy footsteps on the front porch. The start of a car engine let her know he truly was leaving. She sighed and sank back into the chair as she listened as the car drove further away. Well, so much for that.
“I can admire a man’s strength in saying no to the system,” Sherlock muttered. “And… admittedly he might have a few nice qualities. However, that doesn’t mean I’m going to accept his ridiculous proposal. For the moment I need to focus on finishing school, working on my dancing.”
An orgasmic sigh rang out through the apartment. John gritted his teeth and walked back towards the stairs, not eager to hear any more after the horrible and embarrassing breakup. He just needed to sleep, forget. Hopefully by tomorrow everything would be better.
Ah, she’d have them both then. Watch the two of them on a bed, enjoy seeing who won out in dominance, who was the first to break and beg. Two worthy pets for her to play with and enjoy in her own way.
Sherlock set his chemistry book aside and stood. He grabbed for the envelope without even pausing, staring at the words at the top.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. “While this is…pleasant…I’m convinced you’ll regret your actions come morning given how intoxicated you appear to be.”
However, the flirting… it was out of character. And Sherlock didn’t like it. There wasn’t a logical reason behind it. They’d been together in school for months now and Watson had never showed a speck of interest. And suddenly he was over asking for a date.
It was tempting to try to make conversation, but John decided to just allow the silence to continue, just reaching over to turn the radio up slightly.
And so, I swallowed my pride and headed over to Baker Street, trying to rehearse in my head what I’d say if Sherlock reacted badly.
“There’s an elder brother who’s old enough to care for them. From what I’ve heard he’s the worst of the lot,” Donovan said. “And he’s the one who’s enforced a no dating rule for Molly and Sherlock both. I would steer clear of her if I were you. It’d only be trouble.”
John tossed the phone away, hoping to not have to deal with more text throughout the day before moving to enjoy the rest of his time with Cindi, unhindered by thoughts of his obnoxious flatmate.
There was a pause, but Sherlock quickly filled it with accusations about the CIA killers. John looked down at his food again, brow furrowed as he tried to not think about the noise. Just his luck of course, it came again.
A little bit of her felt bad for the betrayal. She and Jim had been working together for a time. But for once she knew whose side she wanted to be on. Though she normally preferred to just stir up chaos and scandal rather than ever helping anyone but herself, for once she was going to change all that. She would pick her side in this war. And that was most obviously with Sherlock Holmes.
John turned and stared just in time to see a dark figure disappearing off in the opposite direction. John felt like his heart might stop beating. Sherlock was there. Sherlock had heard him. God, he could never take those words back. They were out there.
“Then you’ll never date,” Mycroft said. “Now those are words I enjoy hearing. Perhaps you’ll learn the Holmes lesson, Molly. Love is weakness. It’s foolish to believe otherwise.”
To make matters worse, when he went over to talk to her by the punch bowl, hoping perhaps it was a mistake, she looked completely uninterested.
“No worries,” Irene said with a purr. “He has that effect on me too. Why don’t you start by giving him a little kiss, Dr. Watson?”
“You told me a long time ago you were flattered but not interested,” I said calmly. “I know…I asked you then if you had a boyfriend, merely out of curiosity, mind you. But…I’ve since come to realize I care for you and…if you have in any way changed your mind the offer is on the table. If not…well then…that’s no matter. I don’t blame you.”
Molly sighed and shook her head before walking away. She’d just have to find a way to make sure Sherlock had a date, and she’d be on her way.
“Good girl,” Irene said with a heady sigh. She closed her eyes momentarily, readying herself with those clearly laid out plans. A few surprised would be good for Kate, but she’d give some of the major details. There were so many delicious options. So many endless possibilities.
The dream dissolved into sensuality after that, and I woke with the evidence of that quite clearly displayed across my sheets. Having wet dreams like a pubescent boy, oh jolly good. Things I hadn’t missed getting older.
Not that that would be any better, of course. Sherlock had to keep reminding himself that another girl could be worse. The awful polka-dotted woman for example had been dreadful. Sarah had been bearable, but even the thought of her now made him feel furious.
Irene turned the gift from Kate over in her hands, admiring the smooth paper, put together with perfection and clear attention to detail. A silver rope had been used instead of ribbon. Lovely. Perfect. Just like Kate herself.
“Is it… something to do with… well…” she hesitated. She thought back to the other day when she’d talked with her tutor and he’d mentioned that Sherlock could find a guy. That plenty would find his behavior attractive. Could it be possible?
“Well, how about I seduce the wife and you seduce the husband?” Irene giggled. “And we can have a nice little foursome affair together.”
All she knew now was that it was time to run again. She had little doubt her cover was blown. And as much as she wanted to keep playing matchmaker, dying wouldn’t serve her purpose…or at least not really dying.
“All of those things,” I said with a sigh. “But I don’t want a dictionary definition, Sherlock. I mean it as I say it. I love you. And I suppose I want to know if you feel the same.”
“Wait, I didn’t—” His mind was a bit fuzzy as he tried to think back to what he’d called out. He didn’t remember crying anything out. But if he had—
He looked up in time to see Moriarty pausing, turning around, eyes wide. A single brow rose and a look of surprise flashed over his face before it was contained again. Those familiar lips pursed.
“Thank you, John,” he murmured. He hesitated a moment before leaning in to place a soft lingering kiss to John’s lips. “I meant it. Every bit.”
“John, in your medical opinion, do you have any ideas what she might have dosed me with?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock grabbed one up and downed it, slamming the glass down and picking up another. He’d take all he could get. Who cared about Molly. All of this was a waste of time anyways.
He’d never given head before. A few hand jobs, yes. But never this. It was different, but not unpleasant. Not repulsing by any means. And he found himself responding in kind as he saw Sherlock’s mouth drop open.
“Oh,” Sherlock said. He examined John and saw no signs of a supermarket trip. He hadn’t been to his room upstairs, nor had he made any movements in the kitchen. Odd. He was tempted to pry, but at the same time, if John was upset perhaps that was a poor idea.
I shrugged thinking back through our history together. “When we first met I asked if he had a boyfriend and he told me he was flattered but he was married to his work. I suppose that was before…everything…”
“It’s unfair,” Molly said, folding her arms. “In many societies I’d be considered a woman by now. I should have the rights to choose whether or not I date. Once I graduate I’m going to be a complete wreck not having gotten all of the awkward first time nonsense out of the way. I’m likely the only person in the school who’s not currently dating.”
There was a long moment of silence. Kate's expression was difficult to read. She kept her arms crossed as she studied Irene.
John kept shifting back and forth on the couch, trying to find the ideal place to put his hands and finally just settling for crossing his arms.
John was so startled for a moment he didn’t even know what to say. Sherlock? Wait…but he quickly caught up and realized what she was implying. He groaned. Just what he needed. Sherlock getting involved in one more part of his life and ruining it.
John smiled and set his wineglass aside. Taking one of her hands and leading her back to the bedroom. Cindi giggled the whole way along, sashaying in ahead of him and beginning to undo her shirt, revealing a polka dot bra underneath. John ignored that in favor of moving forward to begin kissing her. She moaned into his mouth, though he winced at that, reminded of Sherlock’s phone briefly.
John held his breath as a count began. Sherlock glanced at him, and John caught just a flash of panic in his eyes. No, that wasn’t good. Not for him.
He turned back to continue playing. John eyed his slim form in that familiar blue dressing robe. Once again he conjured up images of those fantasies. Sherlock on his back with John pulling that robe away and—
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and stared Watson over for a long moment. “I don’t know what you’re trying to pull?”
"Do be sure that if you hurt my little brother, you'll never see the light of day again. Do I make myself clear?" Mycroft said, pursing his lips.
“I have a healthy sexual appetite,” she said. “Not all of us can be asexual psychopaths, darling, it simply wouldn’t be practical.”
Molly’s eyes had softened some. She reached out and put a hand on Sherlock’s. “She’s an idiot. An utter and complete fool if she thinks you’re somehow not good enough. You’re lovely, Sherlock. So smart. So talented. You can be a bit…silly sometimes. But we all are. Nobody’s perfect. I bet if you told her how you really felt she might come round.”
“Give my love to Sherlock, dear. After everything that’s happened he could use it. I know you’ll take good care of him.”
“No. Thank heavens for small mercies,” Mycroft said with a smirk. “But that doesn’t mean I don’t care for your welfare.”
"You do realize I maintain surveillance on both of you whenever I can? It's not always easy with how clever Sherlock is, but I have my ways. Now, why don't you go break the news to Sherlock gently and then make it up to him with whatever carnal pleasures he desires."
I sighed. “She won’t have me until I’m sure you’re not in my future. She said she couldn’t marry me knowing I might wonder what would have happened if I’d told you. I love her…just not the same way I love you. I could be very happy with her. Probably happier than I’d ever be with you…but…that doesn’t mean I can just deny what I’m feeling.”
She was silent for a moment before adding, “Perhaps you’re right. Leave me out on my own. I won’t last six months… but without her maybe there’s nothing to live for. But at least you…I hope you at least won’t make the same mistake. Don’t let him slip away, Sherlock Holmes. Not while you have the chance.”
Eyes closed, he did his best to steady himself. He’d certainly made a mess of things, but how bad the repercussions would be he couldn’t say.
Molly was unable to keep a smile at bay. The way he was looking at her, so pleading and puppy-like was simply adorable. Her heartbeat quickened a little. It was nice to feel wanted.
Sherlock was looming over me, patting my face, eyes wide as he gazed at me. Though I’d never had his abilities to read people, looking at him I could see all he is feeling in the moment. Panic. Fear. Worry. Relief. Each emotion passed over him and all I could think was that this had to be yet another nightmare.
Her phone rang. Irene paused and looked down at it. Moriarty. She didn’t dare pick up. All it would be was a threat. And at the moment she simply didn’t have time for those.
“I can’t believe John is so blind to the way Sherlock looks at him,” Kate huffed before reaching out to smooth Irene’s hair before reaching for a comb.
“Good to see you as well,” Molly said, smiling a little brighter. “Er…did you have a chance to watch what I sent you?”
"Please, he's been unusually happy as of late. And you have a bruise on your neck with no girlfriend's to speak of."
Hmm, but she couldn’t be obvious. No. That wouldn’t do. Better to test the waters a little, play with them both. Better to see just how confused and riled up she could get them.
John froze, standing in the doorway just a moment. Sherlock waited patiently, and sure enough the doctor was soon turning around to shoot him a glare.
Sherlock screwed his eyes shut all the tighter, thinking of John staring at him with that brilliant shining smile. Eyes glittering, warm and mirthful.
John leaned in and Sherlock felt lips against his neck. He closed his eyes and merely let the sensations wash over him. It felt undeniably good, John touching him there. He’d never realized the neck could be such a sensual area, but under John’s mouth it certainly felt much more important than the part of the body holding up the head. Sherlock did his best to restrain a moan, clenching his teeth even as he prayed that his body wouldn’t give much response.
He opened the door to find the Americans holding Mrs. Hudson. He eyed the gun to her head, and decided to continue to react slowly, for fear any quick movements might set them off. He couldn’t allow Mrs. Hudson to be harmed. He’d never forgive himself.
“Hmm? Fine,” John said, setting the kettle on the stove. “Can I offer you a drink or anything? Mrs. Hudson’s made all kinds of lovely things to eat.”
Complaining? John shot Sherlock a look. With how grumpy the detective had been lately John had figured he would probably relish having some alone time. Apparently it was just the opposite.
So if I'm calculating correctly there should be one more chapter left. Now, that's provided I think I have enough time to wrap it all up, which might end up proving impossible with these two idiots. I'd say max two though (I really really hope I'm not miscalculating on that one…). But the end is nigh!
John hesitated a moment before leaning in to lick at the left one. Sherlock’s breathing was becoming harder now. He wondered how much more the man could take. After all, someone as inexperienced as Sherlock had to be pretty sensitive. He moved over to the right, kissing it before taking it in his mouth and giving a light suck.
There were several minutes of attempting various versions of John Watson as a username. But Sherlock wasn’t having much luck. Jwatson. JohnWatson. JHWatson. Johnhwatson. He even tried John’s favorite numbers after a variety of those. But it didn’t work. There were simply too many combinations. Perhaps if he went into John’s email he could find the original login information or reset the password.
Perfect. Irene smile and reached for her phone. Kate’s eyes popped open as well, and she scrambled up to watch the screen, beginning to smile as she realized it was time for Irene’s bet to be tested. Would Sherlock finally respond to her? She did sort of doubt it, but there was no telling what strategies the women had. For all she knew, in a few minutes the two men would be a panting mess.
“Obvious,” Lestrade said. “Guy got in when she was out walking the dog. Hid, then stole the jewels and money when she took them off and went to bed. Left through the front door.”
“Suppose not,” he said with a smirk. “But you know it won’t do the least bit of good to try to say something Sherlock. No one will believe you,” he said the last bit in sing song.
“Oh just a little surprise. I think the both of them will find it quite interesting.” Irene smirked and pressed the button on her own phone, playing the orgasmic sigh for Kate to hear.
One more look into Sherlock’s eyes, waiting for consent. Then there was a nod, and John knew it was all right. They both needed this. Sherlock to obtain information on Moriarty. Him to finally have his chance with the man he loved. John shut his eyes at the thought before moving in to slot his mouth against Sherlock’s.
Well, the answer came down to one glance in Sherlock’s direction. A single glimpse of those dark curls and those unfocused gray eyes. John managed to swallow, effectively keeping the emotions he was feeling at bay. He sighed and then closed his eyes for a moment.
Mycroft’s smile was quite forced. “Well, then find something for a few more weeks. Not long, of course, but it’s something. Good night, Ms. Adler. I assume you can find the way out?”
“Yep, that’s me. Er…but I go by Greg…or Lestrade if you’d prefer,’ he said, swallowing down his nervousness. She was decent looking, but the way she carried herself intimidated him. He was even more struck by her firm handshake.
John[E1] groaned and obeyed, leaning forward to kiss Sherlock before moving down his body, easily settling between his spread legs. He swallowed, doing his best to calm himself down before he began. No need to rush this. They had all the time in the world.
John’s jaw dropped. He sat there a moment, scrambling to try to put the pieces together. Sherlock? He’d called Sherlock? How had that hapepened?
I rose to my feet, unable to remain seated, unable to sit there while this man stood in front of me with laughter in his expression, not understanding one bit all the pain and hurt and confusion he’d caused me for all those months the bloody bastard. He was going on about how funny it was and how he “wasn’t dead.” Obviously, Sherlock.
“No look, seriously, could you—” I froze as I finally looked at his face. He’d randomly removed the spectacles he had on, and was staring at me with those eyes unhidden, that mysterious half smile in place. This had to be a dream. Sod it, this was a nightmare, and I would open my eyes soon and it would all be over. This was pre-proposal jitters, me as a nervous wreck imagining my imagined love Sherlock crashing the moment where I asked someone else to be with me for all eternity.
“No,” Lestrade said, unable to keep himself from coughing to keep himself from saying anything rash. Not when this crazy had a needle ready to be used on some kind of nasty drugs.
Kate sighed and shrugged. “I suppose it won’t be all that hard. How did you change his phone anyhow?”
But of course he wouldn’t. John had been like any other boy growing up, was like any other man now. He had dealt with his share of arousal and masturbation and intercourse and pornography and girlfriends and all the other nonsense people put themselves through in an effort to lessen their sexual frustrations. To him such things were perfectly normal.
He settled on prolonging the fantasy. John was on the bed with him, one hand running down Sherlock’s chest, reaching for his buttons on his shirt, working them open one at a time. John’s mouth was on his neck. Having undone his shirt he was working his way down his chest, kisses and licks and—the heat was growing hotter, energy coiling more and more. How was this happening? This seemed impossible.
John groaned and sank further back into the sofa. The golden retriever moved a bit closer, sniffing at him curiously. He patted its head to distract himself a bit, hoping it didn’t come down to Sherlock just blatantly telling the truth. The man sometimes didn’t think about those types of things.
Well that's a wrap folks! I hope you enjoyed it. I'm sad to see this done, but it's a relief to know I have one project finished. Now I'm off to finish my two WIP's plus work on a few other ideas I have brewing (plus some lovely requests to fill). Hope to see some of you again in the future! Feel free to drop me a line on Tumblr if you want to talk.
“I lost the woman I loved,” Irene said. “She’ll have no part of me since I lied to her. I never…I never even got to tell her how I truly felt….I danced around it. Pretended it was all sex. But it wasn’t. And I’ll never get a chance to make that up to her.
. Virgin. Important. Untouched. Pure. Sexually inexperienced. A conquest. For Moriarty? Perhaps. Or had it been a shove to Irene. He could only guess it was that.
“Was,” she said with a shrug. “Until I realized what kind of idiots are in it. I might still go into something in the public sector. I’ve been thinking it could be interesting to be in the police force. Going to head to college next year and then try my luck applying to an academy.”
“A drug sweep. If she is dead tonight is very likely to become a danger night. Can you do that for me?”
“I’m always right,” Irene corrected. “And if Dr. Watson feels anything remotely similar, it’s only a matter of time before both of them will be rolling around on the bed together. Can you imagine, Kate? It will be so lovely.”
Her brow was furrowed as she stared at him. He watched her swallow once. Signs of her coming fall. And she knew it. It was over now.
Greg nodded slowly, though John still wasn’t certain if the message had sunk in. However, Sherlock had tilted to the side, and he was forced to reach out and grab Sherlock before he could topple to the side.
"John," Sherlock murmured when they broke apart, panting for breath. He smiled again, fond and tender. "I am so incredibly glad…I never imagined…"
It was the last straw, the rage boiling inside hit a high point and I flung myself at him without a second thought.
. She swallowed, watching as he pressed the enter button. And for once the phone opened up to display its menu.
"You have any ideas?" he asked, studying her. God there were hundreds running through his head, but he was hoping she might just give him a few more of her own.
I don’t tend to label POV changes, I feel like people can usually distinguish those themselves, but if that bothers you please let me know. Read and review please!
I couldn’t focus on anything. Sherlock would arrogantly state something about being alive. Mary kept saying these things that reminded me why I’d fallen in love with her.
Veronica just smiled and led him deeper into the bowels of the building. John followed after her, trying not to stare at her arse. It had nothing on Sherlock's but still. The moment he arrived back home he was going to find one of his old favorite videos, wank, and then see if he couldn't set up another date on that dating website.
He closed his eyes. Why did this have to be happening? Sherlock Holmes had to finally have feelings for someone, right around the time John started to realize how much he needed him. Sherlock and his bloody timing.
He was glad he was lying on his stomach, hiding any signs of arousal from John. No, John couldn’t know he was feeling this way. No one could. This was—strange. He needed to figure out what was going on.
“Glances? Is that all we get? I thought you promised me a show,” Kate said, wriggling to try to adjust herself and get a better view of the screen. Irene glanced at her handcuffed wrists, calculating how long Kate could go in them. She’d probably be fine for another few hours. The woman was tough…hence her perfect makings for Irene.
Thankfully by the time he opened his eyes they were pulling up to St. Bart’s. He paid the cabby and stepped out, striding towards the building with obvious purpose.
Currently the little she could see through the curtains was Kate lying on the bed. She should have bugged the place before she’d left. But somehow in the moment her mind hadn’t been on Kate. It had been on her. Finishing faking her death. Finding the right body. Bashing in the face. Ensuring it was planted in the right place so it would be found by Kate (painful but necessary) and making sure Sherlock knew of course. She knew the phone would be safe in his possession. And therefore Kate wouldn’t be in danger. Of course she’d wanted to make one more attempt at pushing John and Sherlock in the right direction.
And without having her plan in motion to force Sherlock’s hand on the issue of love…she didn’t have the ability to play her move of achieving his help. It was one more reminder why she so often preferred women over men. Less afraid to voice their feelings. Unlike her two stubborn boys.
"The Woman…before we parted…she said you were lying. She said you…you have feelings for me. Is it true?"
Sherlock didn’t remember the last time he’d felt this level of distraction. This level of inability to think, to reason, to process through the events of earlier. Irene Adler—the woman.
“I keep imagining you up there,” Watson said softly. “You’re quite the talented dancer, Holmes. I hope you know that."
“I told you already, I had my reasons,” she said calmly. “So I ruined one little plot from the British and American governments. Trust me when I say there are bigger things coming.”
He eyed Sherlock cautiously, watching as the detective pulled his newspaper up again, stormy eyes gazing at it challengingly. John let himself examine his flatmate’s countenance, his fine features, his pale skin, his well-defined chest made impeccably clearer by the button up he was wearing—
Irene had reappeared and he could see that her stockings were misaligned and there was a small stain on her skirt. Well, she’d certainly made good use of the few minutes between the acts.
Of course, right about the time he was going to ask if Sherlock might sit down and have a drink with him, the man disappeared into the back bedroom.
“Please,” he said again, eyes opening to look down at John. “I beg of you. Finish. I…I need it…I need
She had to admit this was going to be an adjustment. Going from her high risk lifestyle and regular kinky sex and running from the law to this…this would take time.
Irene smiled, eyes lighting at the thought. She knew how to get what she wanted. Sherlock Holmes would come when she called.
"Come 'ere you," John said, sliding back into the bed and moving to pull Sherlock close again, lips finding a place on his collarbone easily and then moving back up to his mouth.
I poured myself a drink in light of all that had happened. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had to see his face again. Hear his voice. It’d been so long I’d started forgetting those details. And so, drink in hand I put it in and started watching him, seeing his unsmiling face as he monologued through a minimal birthday speech for me, sounded like his usual arrogant obnoxious self.
I sighed. “Well, if it weren’t for bloody Sherlock and his poor sense of timing, I would have asked you this evening what you wanted next, but—we were interrupted at a crucial moment.”
Lestrade looked across the yard, noting a well-dressed boy who’d said something to Molly and her friend in passing. He might have mistaken the boy for an adult had he not been a school yard with his jacket and waistcoat and tie. Handsome and refined with dark glittering eyes that kept staring after Molly as she walked away.
Lestrade’s jaw dropped open. He glanced back at the boy in the car, high cheekbones and scathing eyes all topped with dark curls. There was nothing remotely similar to Molly.
“I…” John hesitated a moment, looked at the floor as one of his hands ran through his hair. “I just…wanted to make sure she told you…so you weren’t so depressed. I thought if I went with what she was asking maybe things would work out all right. So in the moment I just sort of…lied…I’m really sorry if it offended you or anything of the like, but I had to make sure you knew and I was just so angry with her…”
God that felt heavenly! He relaxed into the sensations, especially as John’s mouth opened again and tongue came into play. Much more pleasant with the added oral stimulation, Sherlock decided.
A shadow was in the doorway. And then it was approaching stumbling closer. Sherlock tried to sit up more, only to have someone push him back, strong hands gripping his shirt and keeping his back to the mattress.
John stared in admiration at Sherlock’s toned chest, loving the way he could suddenly see so much creamy skin and hard muscle. In any other context this would be wet dream worthy, but he wasn’t ignoring the fact that Sherlock was clearly drunk, and that something must have upset him enough to cause him to go off like this.
John shot him a look, eyebrows furrowed. “Er…thanks? If you’re going to mention my clumsiness at work you might as well do it.”
I couldn’t begin to process what had actually happened in that sodding dream. I knew I missed him but that—no, that was utter nonsense. Something odd I’d seen on the telly transferred into the realm of unconscious and bubbling up in my dreams. Nothing more. I glanced at the clock. 4:30. Well, a cup of tea for me then, and I’d start my morning early.
Donovan raised one solitary eyebrow. “You make this sound simple. This is not only an issue of finding another boy interested and willing to be in a homosexual relationship…but also one who is willing to put up with the freak…the most obnoxious and callous and rude person in the entire school. On top of that, Sherlock Holmes hasn’t dated. Ever. And suddenly you just expect him to change?”
Though her beautiful Holmes and Watson plan did appear to be working well, Irene knew it would likely have to take less of a priority in the next few weeks. But as she’d already told Kate—these things couldn’t be rushed.
His mind was working faster over the information. Pressure points. Moriarty knew how to play people.
Greg just sighed and shoved his hands into his pockets. He was tired of plans falling through. Seemed like half his life was just him being out of control of his circumstances.
He stood a pace back, wanting to open the door, but unsure how to do so when Watson was still leaning against it.
“Hmm…I like it,” Kate said. She worked the comb deeper into Irene’s scalp, causing her to let out a soft moan. “I really never thought you’d go for me. What with all your brainy is the new sexy and all. I was so shocked the day you finally made a verbal proposition.”
It was difficult to keep the incredulity off his face. "Are you joking? I've been wanking to thoughts of you for months now. If I don't release some of this tension I'll explode."
For once the flat wasn’t a complete mess to come home to. Sherlock seemed to have made some kind of an effort on that, and even the bloodied body parts seemed to have disappeared. And then one day there was milk when he checked the fridge. An item Mrs. Hudson denied having bought, both of them turning to eye Sherlock upon hearing that. What could possibly be going on in that funny head of his?
“Hmm, well a little tip on the Holmes boys, the Ice Man’s pressure point is his brother. His brother’s is—”
Molly did as she was told, pulling back the sheet so he could peer down at the smooth pale skin. He was unsurprised to see 32, 24, and 34 in the hourglass figure presented to him. He nodded.
She laughed at that, though out of the corner of his eye, John thought he saw Sherlock making a face.
Sherlock’s gaze fixed on him. “I’ll get a few things I want. I guarantee it. As to what she wants…well we’ll see how that works. I’ll do what’s necessary in the long run.”
Mycroft sighed and shook his head. “As much as I loath to admit it, I wouldn’t mind seeing my brother settle down. John Watson has done him a great deal of good.” He paused. “I do hope you’re right.”
A/N: I just wanted to take this as a chance to tell people to embrace whatever sexual tendency you might have. I know I spent a lot of time in this chapter with Sherlock questioning what he is, wondering if he’s asexual or bisexual or gay or whatever, but I figured it was a good chance to give this message about loving yourself no matter what you are, not sitting around wishing you could be normal (because normal is so dreadfully boring sometimes ;) ) Anyhow, yes preaching segment done.
“So glad someone’s keeping track of when I lost all my virginities,” Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes. “Should I start taking a count of yours Irene?”
John glanced at Sherlock who was over by the windows with his violin. If Sherlock had figured out he was experimenting with men he hadn’t said anything. Then again, Sherlock had seemed rather self-involved lately. He hadn’t seemed to notice much of anything around John. It had taken him two weeks to realize John had broken up with Shannon.
“Hamish,” she said, rolling the name around in her mouth. On any other beautiful woman he might have found it erotic. But with Irene it was quite easy to ignore. “Scottish in origin? Quite handsome, though perhaps a bit old-fashioned. Would it be Hamish Holmes then? Or Hamish Watson?”
“Oh certainly.” Irene gave a smirk. “There were sparks on that kiss, Kate. Let me tell you. John Watson’s face, priceless. Sherlock tried to close himself off, but he looked towards the good doctor one time to many after. Yes, they’re well on their way. And I’ll play a few other games to solidify it.”
“No, this is…we set John up with Sherlock all so this could happen,” Greg whispered. “It’s…how could this not happen?”
“Tranquilized,” Irene sighed. “Such a pity they had to interrupt us. We were having such fun. Well, pack up the things darling. We need to move again.”
“You were around her age,” Irene pointed out. “Still so young and innocent. Still a virgin by all accounts. Other than oral if I’m correct. You gave that to Victor the year before.”
There were so many moments it didn’t seem real. Even reaching for his still form, pulling a slim pale wrist out so I could search for a pulse. I kept expecting to find one, kept thinking there was no possible way it could really be happening. I had to be imagining things. I had to be dreaming. If I could just force my eyes open I’d be back in my bed in Baker Street.
“Yes,” Donovan said. “Got out of any punishment for it too…said that someone had told her they were going to be doing figure drawing and needed nude models…had texts and everything to back it up too. But then of course…the rumor was she’s doing a few of the members of the staff. Wouldn’t really surprise me to be honest.”
After what felt like ages, she finally pulled the device from her face. Her shoulders began to shake as she sank back onto the sofa again. Her eyes closed, and she simply gave in. For once in her life, she allowed herself to be beaten.
He glanced towards her, brow furrowing even as the countdown finished. John readied himself for pain…for the bullet to pierce his skull.
My jaw clenched as I looked away. Had I gained Sherlock back, only to lose her? Before I could choke up any further, Mary lifted my chin so I was staring at her once more.
John had been upset? By what? He tried to remember what they’d last said to each other, though it was difficult for him to determine exactly when John had left the room. Had he said anything that seemed offensive? He didn’t remember doing so. Perhaps that was only Mrs. Hudson’s overactive imagination. No doubt she was watching some crap telly program while baking, probably inspiring all sorts of ideas about the drama that was going on with her tenants.
It took a few seconds to puzzle it through, and then he was springing to action. His coat flapped wildly behind him as he accelerated into a run, dashing to the corner. Hailing the nearest taxi cab, sliding into the vehicle before anyone could even protest. Someone called his name, but he didn’t turn. Merely ordered the driver to 221 B without another word.
Moriarty had been scanning the schoolyard for a while. Though he hated to admit it, there was a certain curly head he was looking for. And to his disappointment, it wasn’t anywhere in sight. Perhaps the oh so famous Sherlock had been given a detention for his outburst in class then. Well, at least there was something.
“Darling, if Sherlock would get in my pants I’d be all his, but sadly he’s rather…of a different persuasion. To be honest I am too…for the most part. Doesn’t mean I can’t have fun every now and then, though.”
John stared at Sherlock for a moment, but he knew the longer he waited the worse he made this. No, better to get it over with. And with that last thought he slid forward to take to his task.
Shannon had turned to give the camera a little wink. Irene smiled and closed the computer. That had gone even better than expected. Watson had thrown himself at her plant with no problems, while Sherlock had acted in clear jealousy. Oh the looks he kept shooting the two on the sofa. It was simply adorable.
Irene began to laugh as the consulting detective rose up to his knees before tumbling forward face first. Too good. She hadn’t expected this little joy; she’d get to the good part in a few seconds.
Irene didn’t know how she stood in the shadows. She was unsure even how to proceed. Nothing seemed to be going her way lately. She’d achieved the two of them having some level of sex, even wrestled a confession out of John Watson, and yet the two still seemed set on not being together. Playing cupid apparently wasn’t so easy as she’d initially thought.
“And what about this?” Sherlock is leaning over me, close, so close, foreheads almost touching. However, it’s the target of his hand that’s my real worry. I draw in a sharp gasp as he finds new evidence for what he wants to prove, smirking at what he finds there.
Thanks power0girl for the comments! Last posting thanking commenters, so the rest of you who comment after this is done thanks so much! Thanks for all my other supporters too. You are all wonderful!
“I can tell you what to do,” I muttered, lifting my drink to my lips, turning my gaze away from him as his back is turned and the sight of it is stirring interesting emotions. “You can stop being dead—”
Sherlock frowned and stared at it. So he had been right, she hadn’t gotten ahold of his phone. But then, how had she done it? Her cleverness was apparently boundless if she could find a way to change his ringtone without even being near him.
Still, it was nice. Having a smarter older boy interested in her for once. She couldn’t deny that she was quite excited by the prospect.
But it had been just after that when things had gone south. Staring at John and losing himself in a whirlwind of thoughts for a moment. Memories and fantasies and a gambit of perfect saved mind palace images of John, his little shrine in the back room. And before he could even process what he was saying the words had slipped out of his mouth.
“All right?” His eyes sparkled. He pulled firmly, tugging Sherlock to his feet. “It was perfect, Sherlock. Magnificent. Maybe a bit shocking for poor Greg…but lovely for me…”
She rolled her eyes. “Oh please, I wouldn’t be surprised if he wants you. Under all that aloof and pompous attitude he probably is looking for your approval. I think that was what was really going on with him telling you his elaborate plans instead of apologizing yesterday. He just wanted you to be impressed.”
He broke off. It was too late. Lestrade had looked up from his phone, and he’d apparently caught sight of it. In the light of the windows it was easy to see the dark bruise on Sherlock’s very pale skin. The otherwise unblemished column of neck marked with one solitary and obvious mark.
“What?” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow. It was rare for Mrs. Hudson to lose her temper, especially at him. She normally had all the self-control in the world. Understandable, given her background.
Sherlock remained silent. That was for her to guess, not for him to say. She’d seen enough of his private life for one day.
. He closed his eyes for a few seconds. John. He needed John. She was right. And even if his heart shouldn’t rule his brain, for once he’d let it.
“Hmm.” Sherlock said, not answering. By the way his eyes had focused back on the window, John suspected he’d gone back into his mind palace.
All he had to do was imagine John descending a bit lower, John’s mouth touching him, John—oh John, John, John…
“There’s no one crazy enough to date Sherlock Holmes,” Donovan said. “Even the ones who are loony enough still weren’t interested in dating him…just…” she tilted her head and sighed. “Well you get the idea.”
“Why would I need your help?” he managed to mutter. He could feel his face heating to match the rest of his body, well aware of the growing warmth inside, the potential consequences of that as well. He shifted against the mattress, relieved as John seemed to get the picture that he didn’t need help.
She could hear Molly shuffling some in the background. “Yes, Miss Adler. He really loves him. I could tell just listening to him talk about it. We’re doing the right thing.”
Molly sighed. “Can you just…for one night be my brother. I want to go to this. Would you please come with me so that I can go?”
She'd have to find another way to get the phone. Especially now that her cover was more than likely blown. She didn't expect John to be quiet about it unless Sherlock persuaded him to do so. But regardless of what John thought, Irene was aware Sherlock harbored no feelings for her. It wasn't her name he cried out during climax. It wasn't her he said he loved…
He allowed the kiss to continue just a second longer, relaxing slightly against John before reaching up and putting his hands on John’s chest. He was tempted to let them linger, to reach down and pull on the hem of the jumper and raise it over John’s head. But at the same time this wasn’t right. This wasn’t how he’d imagined it.
“The necklace, and probably the money too, would have both had grease stains from the bacon then. There’s a few other greasy fingerprints on the table area. Although a few of them are quite smudged nearer to the edge. Also, may I point out if this really was a true burglary, the criminal likely would have taken the fine silverware in your kitchen, or even your television set. No far too much left here.”
John rubbed his face as he listened to the umpteenth piece in a minor key. How much longer could this go on? He still wasn't even sure
“Looks like he’s clean. We’ve tried all the usual places. Are you sure tonight’s a danger night?” John asked, reaching up to rub his temple.
John sighed and pulled away from Sherlock’s mouth, nipping at one of his lips as he withdrew. He gazed up into the detective’s eyes for a moment, taking in the dilated pupils. Well, that was a good sign if nothing else. At least his body was responding.
They were still for a long moment, simply catching their breaths, enjoying the body heat associated with lying so close, feeling especially cozy with the snow falling outside the window. Sherlock pondered what it would be like to have this always…John at his side…John curled up with him in bed…John bringing him pleasure and him reciprocating…
But what startled John most was that the weeks of loneliness had ended. Suddenly, Sherlock kept finding ways for them to spend time together.
Watson raised a single brow. “Just washing my hands before I go to my seat. Not everything is about you Holmes.”
“I want to go to dance school. I want you to trust me to make my own decision. And I want you to stop trying to control my life just because you couldn’t control yours,” Sherlock said, slamming his fist into the dashboard.
And you’d think after the actual death it would just gradually get easier. But no, the death is only the beginning of the pain. Then there’s the funeral. And crying all over again, seeing a coffin lowered into the ground and knowing that this really is the end. There’s being around the little reminders each and every day: his chair, his smiley face painted on the wall, his room, his comb in the bathroom, his random rubbish left lying about as though any moment he might just pop up to claim his rightful spot again.
“I just…wanted to talk to you,” he said with an uneasy smile. “You know… just… it’s kind of why I came.”
His mind was a mess. He couldn’t straighten his thoughts out. For once answers seemed to be eluding him. He couldn’t process anything, couldn’t sort out the information Irene had just spoken to him. How could he when everything in him wanted to remember the moment John had brought him to—
“I was asked out,” Sherlock muttered. “More your area of expertise I’d say…judging by the lipstick stain on the collar of your dress I’d say you and Kate had a nice time this afternoon.”
And then the bloke at the bar who he’d ended up snogging and gone home with…it had been quite pleasant over all. But it just confirmed for John that the problem wasn’t about needing men. It was about needing Sherlock.
“From what you’ve just told me, it sounds as though John is a disadvantage,” Sherlock said. “Moriarty’s plan and all.”
He stiffened. “Your little sexual games prove nothing. As you said, love is not the equivalent to lust. John might have proven enjoyable, but sexual stimuli proves nothing on my feelings.”
Well, long story short, I ended up with her number, and soon we were seeing each other on a semi-regular basis. It was such a nice change of pace. Growing closer and closer to Mary. Moving in together. There was someone in my life to care for and love and talk to and be myself with. For once, I was beginning to feel better. In fact, I found Mary better to talk to about my Sherlock feelings more than the therapist—though I obviously left the more…embarrassing details out.
“Well, it’s a matter of…you…have you ever had feelings for them, but pretended you didn’t?” Sherlock asked. “As in, had the opportunity to say how you felt and flat out lied?”
"Well, that's Mrs. Hudson and Molly and my brother who know now," Sherlock said. "I still think we should just go ahead and shag in Lestrade's office and see if he or any of the morons who work there finally figure it out."
She rose and walked over to the computer, fiddling with it until a new image popped up. Kate gazed at a room where the secretary was standing talking to several people. Kate recognized one of them as some inspector Sherlock was associated with.
The problem was that he couldn’t stop thinking about the day before…everything that had happened…in particular the horrible strangeness of dealing with drugged up Sherlock.
The thought of that sent her thinking of Kate…and she quickly tried to disconnect her thoughts from the beautiful woman. She couldn’t afford to be distracted right now. She had to focus on starting a new life. Hiding from Moriarty and the CIA and all the rest of them.
"You've texted him a lot," John added. "And other than trying to manipulate him into touching me for some reason, I don't know what all the other texts were about."
“I’m your guardian, that is my right,” Mycroft said in a dull tone. “Don’t confuse my practically for sentiment, brother.”
“If it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night, would you have dinner with him?” she asked.
Once he was at the flat, he paid the cabbie. His strides were brisk as he went for the door, opening it up and heading in. His heart was still racing, but he was hanging on to his control by a thread.
Donovan glanced at him. “Oh Sherlock Holmes might be uptight but everyone knows that if not for his big brother’s cover ups, he’d likely have been in trouble with all the drugs.”
She settled back in the armchair, eyes on the light of the fire, watching it crackle and burn. So domestic and simple. As a child, perhaps she'd thought this might be life. The images her parents had tried to instill into her as a matter of principle. But she would never have chosen it on her own.
He focused on his driving, letting Irene tell him the latest gossip. Whatever he couldn’t deduce, she could usually seduce. It created a valuable pool of information between the two of them. While he might mock her sexual exploits at times, they did come in handy. He let the information sink in before he pulled up to her door.
Irene was focused, intent upon studying the past footage, while still examining the lone detective of course. He’d stopped playing his violin and had seated himself on the couch, staring into space. It was unfortunate the other pawn in the game had left, but she’d have him back soon enough, both of them at her disposal.
He looked up at last, eyes refocusing. “Hmm? I suppose we do don’t we? Now how is Moriarty going to end me?”
Thanks to power0girl for commenting! Love all of you awesome subscribers, bookmarkers, and kudo givers too! You keep me going.
John rolled his eyes and shoved the phone away again. He turned his attention back to Cindi, kissing her, caressing her, enjoying her soft skin and attractive curves. He worked to get his clothes off, reaching for the condom in his pocket.
The door to the bathroom closed and he heard the shower start. John finished dressing and headed out. He tried to think about what had happened in the cab ride home, but really there wasn’t much he could make about it other than the fact that he was clearly having some kind of sexuality crisis. No other men did this to him. He hadn’t been interested in anyone before, even though he’d had more than one man hit on him in his lifetime. But Sherlock…there was just something about Sherlock.
He asked her a few questions, but like Anthea she seemed pretty tight lipped. Managed to wrestle out her name (Veronica) and that she was in fact already in a relationship. Well, wasn't that just marvelous. Otherwise most of the drive was silent.
At home I watched the telly for a while and then retired to bed. But it was in my dreams that the strangeness began.
"He's writing sad music," John said, voice carrying and echoing in the large room. "Doesn't eat, barely talks—only to correct the television."
“I had a good few hours before I took it back,” Irene pointed out. “I dropped it by that IT chap’s place. The computer whiz…whatever you want to call him. He’s brilliant, though nowhere near Sherlock’s level. Merely gifted with technology.”
I'm estimating about 3, 4 chapters more on this one (no promises). So we are getting close for those worrying!
As he looked up, he realized someone was headed towards his table. Not someone he would have accepted.
John nodded, agreeing that he too was almost finished. There was a pang of regret at not keeping the pleasure going longer. But he knew there would be much more of this in the future. The thought warmed him considerably.
“I assumed you’d choose something more specific than that but, um, thanks anyway,” Sherlock said before typing in the numbers.
He sauntered closer watching me with those calculating blue eyes, observing every detail. What comments would he have for me? I wasn’t sure if I should be angry if those did come or relieved. Had I truly missed those obnoxious remarks?
The sweeping motion of the bow, the careful grip Sherlock kept on the long neck of the instrument, fingers dancing over the surface as he quickly morphed into a more lively concerto piece after Mycroft had disappeared out the door. His whole body was poised in anticipation of each note, eyes closing briefly in a moment of passion.
He watched Sherlock’s eyes scan over his face, then his usually stony expression morph into an unexpected smile.
“Yes.” There was a pause. “Is there anything else you’d like me to do? I really do want to help. Anything to make him happy.”
“What, don’t enjoy that sort of thing?” Sherlock asked. “Sure seem to like it when I order you around.”
“And are there any other tidbits you’re willing to tell me?” Sherlock said with a sigh, eyes boring into her.
Maybe that would get Sherlock. Sherlock liked solving problems. John felt a bit of hope as he glanced at the detective and then back at the blog.
Molly suggested meeting at a local park. Greg biked over, parking near the edge and sighing as he caught sight of Molly.
I'm bumping this up to mature due to sexual content, though I'm not a very explicit writer. Still, if such things bother you leave now! It's Irene Adler we're talking about after all.
The case really wasn’t all that interesting in itself. Hardly anything worth noting. Lestrade had shown up with some murder that he just couldn’t fathom the answer to (how surprisingly ordinary). So there he was, a half an hour later, bending over a body and trying his best not to throw every insult in the book at Lestrade. Staring at the mangled murder victim, knowing almost exactly what had happened and certainly what to look for.
John walked her out. Sherlock waited until he heard the door of the cab close before he went to grab up his instrument a second time, immediately starting to practice now that he didn’t have to worry about Shannon.
“Well, we can’t just go and get it, can we?” He looked at Sherlock, doing his best not to stare too hard. “Molly Hooper. She could collect it, take it to Bart’s; then one of your homeless network could bring it here, leave it in the café and one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back.”
"Yes," John panted, moving faster. It hadn't been like this in months. All those women. The few men. He'd forgotten what it felt like to be with someone he cared about. To look down into someone's face and feel his heart wrench with desire and longing and…love.
So, she'd settle for the domestic lifestyle. Relax and enjoy the time she had thanks to the help from Sherlock and John.
“I have no interest in the disgusting and disappointing selection of males at our school,” Sherlock muttered. “Not all of us are willing to spread our legs for the slightest bit of attractiveness.”
“And for that matter,” John added, still smiling, moving to grasp Sherlock’s hand, “I love you too.”
“Yes mistress,” Kate sighed, settling back on the pillows even as Irene’s gaze drifted back towards the screen. This was too good. Simply too good.
“So that’s it,” he murmured after a moment. “That’s it. You do fancy me me, John. With all those denials I really had given up hope.”
I didn’t magically turn queer if that’s the question you’re wondering. Look, I still very much like women. I don’t particularly find much about male anatomy all that appealing on its own. But Sherlock had given me something different.
Of course, John came out of his thoughts to find Sherlock continuing his deductions, moving on from commenting on Molly’s present to making remarks about her appearance.
Mrs. Hudson took a moment to process, but the second she did she went red in the face and let out a shriek before finally covering her eyes.
John shook his head, hoping his poker face was working. Sherlock had run it all past him. The best ways to fake a death. The means of procuring a body similar enough to work with. Methods of changing records. Between him and Molly Hooper it apparently hadn't been all that hard to put together. The only thing John was really lacking details on was what had happened to The Woman after Sherlock had helped her. He'd brushed off questions by saying it wasn't important. John let it go pretty quickly.
"Cor, I…I suppose more often I've fantasized about top," John said with a shake of his head. "But were you to want that I'd be more than happy—"
John was on the third girlfriend. Fifth partner if you wanted to count the dalliances he had with men. And Sherlock continued to pine and brood. In fact, many of his actions had only driven John further away if anything. They were working fewer cases together. Perhaps she’d been wrong in some of her methods, but really the two required a hands on method she simply didn’t have the time for.
He grinned. "I'd love to, Sherlock Holmes. Now, if you're quite finished running that smart mouth of yours, I'd rather put it to better use."
Sherlock moved slightly, going over to the doors and shutting and locking both, probably in hopes Mrs. Hudson wouldn’t barge in. As he went back towards the couch he glanced back at John for a moment, eyes flashing uncertainly. God he made a beautiful sight.
I was working on my laptop, deeply involved in typing out my thoughts about the latest case. I hardly noticed as he sauntered in, glancing over my shoulder before going to sit in his own chair. He stared at me for a long moment, eyes fixed. Feeling his gaze, I looked up. Those eyes, riveted to me, taking in every detail. While normally I might have rolled my eyes and told him to stop trying to make deductions about me for the day, this time all that happened was a bit of heat rising to my cheeks. It was the excuse he needed.
“John, please can you check those flight schedules; see if I’m right?” Sherlock said, not looking away.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. He stood again to go over to the table where he’d left his violin sitting. He picked it up and began picking at it.
However, the dreams were a conclusion to my questioning. I was apparently attracted to Sherlock. It had taken his death to prove it, but nonetheless, I had fallen for him. All those denials had been for nothing. I’d missed my chance, and now I would live with the regrets of that.
“I just can’t win,” John muttered, walking over to plop down in his chair, slumping immediately and letting out another long sigh.
The door shut, and Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. He rolled over, a hand reaching down to push his pants aside. It had been a long time since he’d done something like this, but nonetheless, the soft touches made some of the heat dissipate, allowed a small amount of respite. He breathed deeply, trying to quiet any sighs or moans, knowing John was just outside listening in to make sure there wasn’t anything wrong. Mmm John…
“Hope? What are you on about?” I managed to bite out. “Sherlock, there’s nothing to deny…I don’t fancy—”
Sherlock grimaced at the mess on his torso and lower body. He’d have to clean up later, but for now he wanted to get John settled. He wrapped an arm around the shorter man’s torso and walked him to the door and then out into the sitting room, helping him onto the sofa. John already looked ready to fall asleep. Sherlock watched him for a moment. Was he going to pass out? Maybe he should stay with him, make sure he was all right?
He pushed those memories aside in favor of considering the current case. Irene Adler, dead. It was odd really. He’d come to admire her. She wasn’t attractive to him in the slightest in terms of her beauty or her sexual allure, but her intelligence and cunning were incredible. It was rare for him to find someone so…complex to work with. And besides…she’d been the one to awaken some of his interest in John. Or perhaps to make him realize it. But his sentimentality was getting the better of him, and Sherlock soon schooled himself again.
He attempted to walk back towards his friend. Maybe he could do some damage control. But Irene held out a hand and stared at him, and even though she didn't speak he somehow got the message. He sighed and waited a moment. Maybe she was right, maybe chasing Sherlock wasn't the best option anyways.
That was all it took. John thought to himself that he'd never found a better way to shut Sherlock up. But by all means, this seemed to be the key. With a grin he allowed himself to be escorted into the bedroom, and with the door shut he let himself go in Sherlock's more than capable hands.
Even with the forced smile, for a moment he was slightly fooled. “Oh…thank you. So why don’t…” he broke off staring as he saw the phone coming out of Sherlock’s jacket pocket, holding it up to examine it closely before showing it to Irene.
However, just my luck, I was stopped from making a terrible mistake when I knocked into someone in my path to go flirt. I spilled my drink over her, wetting the entire front of her red dress.
“Of course we are,” Irene said in a purr. “Goodnight, Molly. Do look into that dating advice I gave you. I think it will prove quite beneficial.”
“Lovely, Sherlock, that was lovely!” Mrs. Hudson cried, giggling. “I wish you could have worn some antlers.”
John had pulled it away of course, told Sherlock it was all right, and he’d be home soon. But the man had continued to mumble things about John…about how good he smelled and how wonderful his body looked and…
She and Mycroft went straight to the table to sit down across from each other. Sherlock decided hiss thinking might be more productive were he to sit to the side. So he settled onto an armchair a few feet away, not even daring to look in Irene’s direction, or especially not Mycroft’s. He had no desire to see his brother’s famous scowl.
. He smirked. I am Sherlocked. Clever. Playful. Just like her. He’d told Molly she loved to play games, and he’d been right.
“You will thank me later,” Donovan said with a wave of her hand. “Trust me, Moriarty is the best person for it. He’s got personal interest and enough money and influence to get this done. And besides, while he’s making the setups with Watson…you’ll have more time to woo your woman.”
But in many ways there were elements of our relationship that were beginning to make sense under a certain new context. No, I didn’t think I was going to start thinking of other men now. I really didn’t think I was a proper bender. However, my relationship with Sherlock fell into a neat context under the idea of romance—though it was terrifying to think of it that way. But after all we’d been through, our companionship together, how I couldn’t keep a girl for more than a month or two at most. I thought back to the one girl’s comments on how Sherlock was lucky to have such a devoted boyfriend. It was true; I’d been more devoted to him than to any of my supposed romantic partners.
Sherlock turned to eye him suspiciously. The woman looked in his direction, but it was Sherlock’s attention he’d really caught. It was Sherlock who knew he didn’t say that name willingly. It was Sherlock who was all too aware of the extremes one had to go to get it.
Greg shrugged. “If he won’t accept Watson then there’s nothing left to do. Moriarty will get her and I’ll just have to sit and watch.”
“We’ll finish up when we move,” Irene purred in her ear. “Break in our new bed all right and proper.”
He’d spent as much time as he could away from the house. So that weekend he was making the rounds in his car. He and Irene had agreed to meet up later, but for now he’d start with the bookstore and then see what else there was to do.
John nodded, thankful she understood. He walked out into the other room and began checking the places he’d known Sherlock to keep his stashes before. He could feel Jeanette’s eyes on him as he walked around the place. He knew she had to be thinking about their promises to have a private Christmas celebration at her place. Well, as soon as he was done with this he was going to go shag her silly and forget all about Sherlock and his bloody drug problems and his obsession with Irene Adler.
"Oh, Sherlock. You're already mine. And in every aspect I'm yours. Now, come and remind me of it for a little while."
“Depends who it was,” Irene said with a shrug. “So tell me. What hunk… well I shouldn’t presume it was a man I suppose. Who is seeking the heart of Sherlock Holmes this time?”
He avoided looking at her as he walked over to where Sherlock was sitting, moving onto the couch next to him, and tilting his face to get a better look at the damage he’d done.
His brow wrinkled, but he didn’t respond. She would have to press harder if she wanted an answer to that.
"No, you prick," John said, voice coming out choked. "God, you're so clueless. I'm…I'm happy Sherlock. I…" He reached up to brush away a few tears, smiling as best he could. "I love you too. It's more than I ever could have hoped for."
“Just an experiment,” Sherlock muttered, finally managing to stop the video in its process. He exited the tab quickly, just in time as John grabbed the laptop, and pulled it away.
“Some, yes,” she said. “Why I’m half inclined to take your brother, Mycroft. I think that might be a very fitting punishment for you with your carelessness.”
The echo of violin music in the flat was becoming a daily experience John was steadily growing more and more used to. Sure, Sherlock had played the violin from time to time. But never like this. Never for hours on end, long melodies of sad music drifting through Baker Street.
“Oh, hi,” John said, doing his best to not slur his words. His head felt pretty fuzzy, and he had a good feeling Sherlock would see in a heartbeat that he was tipsy if not drunk.
Her eyes went wide for a moment before she smiled again. He could practically see her thoughts running wild. Most likely conjuring smutty imaginings up he supposed.
For the first time in a long while he found himself craving his traditional fare. Perhaps drugs might make things better… Maybe he’d have to search some out later.
And then Sherlock did the unthinkable. He leaned in and kissed Molly’s cheek. John felt his stomach drop, his whole body tensing as he stared at the man he loved kissing someone else. Married to his work? But apparently blood well able to kiss Molly after being horrible to her. John didn’t even know what to say. Thankfully he was interrupted from having to say anything by Sherlock’s phone.
“When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait. How true of you: the combination to your safe – your measurements; but this ...this is far more intimate.”
A hand slid up to the buttons of his purple dress shirt, sliding them out of the holes slowly one by one. There were a few whistles, and then Sherlock was sliding his hands over his bare chest. John felt heat flooding his cheeks as he watched.
Of course, after a long moment, John was expecting her to finally give in. Only to see Sherlock finally sigh and hand over the phone. He opened his mouth to protest, shocked to see Sherlock just giving into her whims. But of course, this was Irene Adler they were dealing with. This was
As the curtain rose once more, Sherlock sighed and settled back in his seat. Well, there was much to consider after such an eventful day. Certainly more than he would have expected at the ballet.
“And that she’s seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and what she’s wearing. Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts…”
John looked towards it, and then at Sherlock whose eyes seemed to have started glowing, a smile playing on those lips as he studied the space.
Sherlock chuckled and shrugged. He made some comment and then seemed intent on moving towards discussing the terrorist cell he’d been working on cracking. However, I couldn’t let him move on before we’d talked it over. It needed to happen.
Cindi was thrilled to welcome him up to her place. She kept giggling about how she’d been worried he hadn’t really been keen, considering he’d not spent much time with her in the last week. Well, that was Sherlock’s fault with his latest interesting case.
“Alright, I’ll try to investigate that. In the meantime, you plan out giving me some more action from those two,” Kate said.
information on Moriarty. Was she playing the two of them against each other? But instead it triggered his thoughts on their talk earlier.
His fingers pulled her hand away, trailing down her wrist for a moment. It was there. Unexpected, but there nonetheless. He looked up at her, eyeing her carefully. There was an obvious answer, of course. Not one he wanted. But it was possible. But why try to distract him with John? To better hide herself he supposed. Make sure no one suspected how she really felt.
And then he looked at John again and realized that Jeanette was missing…and he knew they’d had plans. Odd. He frowned.
He stood still, staring up at the landing where he knew three men were waiting for him. They’d picked the wrong day. Of course, he could deal with them most any time he chose, but today of all days they were not going to have any mercy.
“Have you never heard of the Kinsey Scale?” Donovan said. She finally just sighed and shook her head. “Never mind. Now’s not the time for a gender studies lesson. We’ll save it for another day…because you’re definitely going to need it. For now let’s just point out that this is a terrible idea. You don’t even know half the rumors about Watson.”
Sherlock snapped out of his reverie, suddenly becoming aware of Irene sitting there and staring at him, eyes glittering in the low light.
I sometimes forget how smart she is. I really admire that about her, but it does create problems in some situations. Namely, what happened when we arrived home.
I grunted. That did sound a bit like Sherlock. Showing off. But I couldn’t believe something like my approval really would mean all that much to him. Impressing me had been so easy for him at first, as it was with most people. But I’d gradually grown used to it, and I’d stopped reacting.
Irene Adler had to admit she was intrigued by the prospect of meeting Sherlock Holmes. A brilliant detective, he’d made an impression on her just from his newly famed reputation. Though she became even more intrigued when she received photos of him just a few hours prior to meeting him. He had some level of attractiveness to him, if one went for that sort of thing. Defined cheekbones and stormy gray eyes. Tall and slim. His stern gaze spoke of a man who would be a challenge to break. And she liked nothing better than a challenge.
“Holy Mary!” he said with a grin, unable to help himself. Perhaps he’d had a bit too much alcohol already, but who was he to deny Molly looked lovely? He was so used to her in lab coats and slacks that the sight of her in such feminine attire was shocking. He wasn’t the only one anyways. Lestrade’s jaw looked like it might just be stuck open.
“I’ve missed you,” he whispered. He leaned closer and my breath caught as his angular nose suddenly bumped against mine.
John did his best to maintain a straight face while Mycroft told him all about Irene Adler and her recent "demise." Honestly it was altogether humorous watching the older Holmes make a fool out of himself in thinking how good he was fooling his little brother to protect his heart.
Making sure he didn’t look too rumpled, Sherlock opened the door and ventured out to find John on the couch with his laptop.
If she’d been trying to get her claws into him, that he might have understood. But he’d been home alone in bed. And what had she whispered to him when putting his coat in his room? Something about John. He was almost certain of it. But again, that was absolute nonsense. There was no reason for the woman to talk about John. She hadn’t appeared the least bit interested in him. Her attention had been focused on Sherlock instead.
His body responded at the mere thought of that noise, recalling more intimate images to mind. He shifted uncomfortably, deciding maybe he should actually say something.
The door to the flat opened. He glanced up, heart beginning to pound as he heard footsteps on the stairs.
He watched as the other boy swayed his hips to the beat before heading towards the store. Sherlock’s jaw clenched.
"I promised your brother," John managed to say between kisses, "that I'd give you some sort of pleasure so you could forget about what happened to The Woman."
Lestrade smiled suddenly. “Er…don’t know if it helps, but you should know he has a red thong…er…and a dildo. You know...”
Sherlock was still lost in John’s blue eyes. He didn’t get a chance to reply. But he didn’t need to. A voice answered from behind him.
After a long moment he decided to follow Sherlock to his room. He excused himself from the company, catching yet another annoyed glance from Jeanette that he ignored. Walking down the hallway, he was relieved to see the door still cracked open. He pushed it the rest of the way to find Sherlock sitting on his bed talking with someone on his phone. Mr. Prefers-to-text actually talking on his bloody mobile.
