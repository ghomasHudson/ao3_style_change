No such luck. Five minutes later, not only had Dean not stopped, but he was now cupping Cas' face and kissing him. It was sweet, in a way that Sam didn't really want to see. The younger brother knew this was something meant to be private, and if Dean hadn't tipsy and on a hunting high, he wouldn't be doing this in front of anyone, let alone the whole bar.
The angel looked different without his suit and trench coat, but it was still Castiel, angel of Thursday. A little less scrawny, a little more scruffy, but pretty much the same. The hunter would have been glad to see him, if he wasn't so painfully aware of what Cas had done to Dean. Right now the only thing stopping Bobby from taking a swing at him was knowing that it wouldn't hurt the angel even slightly.
Dean wanted to ask why Cas wouldn’t bathe, but he didn’t want to embarrass his friend any more than he already was. If Cas wanted to tell him, he would.
As much as Sam did not want to admit it, Dean would never be the same ever again. He might be able to make the occasional joke or even crack a smile, and to most people he might even look okay, but Sam would always see it. He would always see that emptiness behind the grin, the sadness hidden behind the jokes. He knew Dean would keep on hunting and travelling, simply because he didn't know what else to do. He would drink to pass out a lot, he would be moody, irritable, down right scary on hunts and closed off any other time. And Sam knew the only thing he could do, was be there for his brother. Leave him a cup of water and an aspirin in the morning, find him some easy hunts to release stress, and most of all, do his best to never, ever again mention Cas. Once the hunter's funeral was over, Sam knew that his only job was to let Dean cope in his own, unhealthy way, and then help him bury this memory as best he could. As much as it would hurt them both, Sam needed to help Dean forget Castiel.
Castiel answered by leaning in, kissing with a certainty that eased the knot of anxiety in Dean’s gut. The kisses were chaste, so Dean followed suit and kept his tongue to himself for now. That wasn’t what this was about, anyway. Dean wasn’t trying to get Cas fired up and turn this into something more. He was just thrilled to
“Me and Sam were on a hunt and got stuck in this tiny mountain town during a snowstorm. Jill owned the B and B we had to stay in. No motels in a place that small,” he explained. Castiel nodded and let him continue.
“Nothing’s wrong,” Dean says, but he knows that doesn’t sound true. He’s literally shaking with relief now that Cas has his boxers back on.
bigger than him, Cas felt reluctant to make him take his full weight. Dean was also very observant and turned his head to look at Cas.
Dean carefully flexed his legs out in front of him, feeling the tightness in his thighs and calves protest. He already knew the ache would begin the travel up and down his legs if he didn't get moving soon.
Dean glanced out the window again at the two cops leaning against their car, an open box of doughnuts sitting on the hood between them. Each officer held one of the glazed treats in their hands.
He sighs, but Cas is just as stubborn as he is, maybe more. This isn’t something he’s going to let Dean brush under the rug to be forgotten.
The place was empty when he walked in, other then the bartender. She was about twenty six, she wasn't heavy set but any stretch, but she certainly wasn't a bean pole either, and had blond hair pulled back into a high pony tail. She gave him a surprised look. No one came to a bar at ten o'clock in the morning. Technically they weren't even open till six tonight.
There’s no trace of jealousy in his voice, only concern. Dean meets his eyes and sees love and sympathy and a desire to know all of Dean’s painful memories. Not out of morbid fascination or an ulterior motive, Cas wants to know so he can help.
The girl, her name tag said Beth, was about to tell Dean to leave, but she hesitated. For the first time since he came in, she really looked him over. He looked like he hadn't slept well in months, he had dark circles under his eyes and slouched and wobbled a little even when he stood. He looked sad and angry and confused all at the same time, but there was also something about him that she couldn't quite place. Beth only hesitated a moment longer before she grabbed a shot glass and a bottle from under the counter.
Sam sighed and shook his head in defeat before he went to sit at the table. He listened as Dean asked Bobby about a case the older hunter had found.
Dean's voice shook, Sam's heart nearly broke at the emotion his brother was demonstrating when he talked about the angel. It was so clear now that they had been together, how had he and Bobby both missed it?
The realization stopped him short outside their door. That wasn’t normal. Cas’s smell should have had him hard and practically drooling, but he felt no different from when Cas had caught the flu for the first time last month. All he wanted to do was curl up around him and hold him.
Dean kept his eyes glued to the road and pointedly ignored his brother. Sam huffed and leaned back into his seat to stare out the window, watching a light drizzle begin raining down.
The puppy dog eyes and concerned tone stopped him short for a second. Sam held his hand firm on Dean's shoulder to keep his brother from running out anyways.
Just then, Sam came back inside. Bobby knew instantly that the drive had done nothing to calm him down. The older hunter decided not to get Sam's hopes up by telling him he had found one more person to try, and simply went about making a crappy little supper of beans on toast.
Dean doesn’t get more than half an hour of sleep at a time that night. The bed is too empty without Castiel, and he keeps waking up each time he rolls over, expecting to feel a warm body and finding only cool sheets. After the first several hours of unsuccessful sleep, Dean gives up on not being pathetic. He pulls Castiel’s pillow to his chest, shoves his face into the fabric, and inhales the smell of coconut shampoo. That gets him another half an hour before the nightmare starts.
Dean whirls around and sweeps the blanket back up to cover Castiel's face. He could swear he felt the cold radiating from his dead friend, and something about it violently turns his stomach, giving him the sudden urge to vomit. He stumbles out of the Impala and stands there a few seconds, head spinning, willing his heart to slow down, forcing himself to think about literally everything
Dean can't think. His brain is a mess of emotions he's never learned how to process, and it feels far too late to even try. He drags his hands down his face, keeps his eyes closed for a few seconds. Then he just stumbles to his bed and collapses onto it, every last scrap of energy in him draining out. Suddenly Dean feels so,
Dean scoops up a handful of sandy dirt and lets it fall slowly through his fingers. He does it again and it's soothing for some reason. There's grit under his nails by the time the sky is painted pink. His palm is coated with dust by the time the clouds darken to blue-gray and pink burns into crimson. The crickets keep on singing. Dean wipes his hand across his face and a smudge of mud is left behind.
"I asked for that once too," he says softly. "because I felt like I deserved it. Do you remember that? Dean, please tell me why you think I should be hurting you."
Dean thought he could do this. But it's been barely a week and he's panicking. He's breathing, or at least he thinks he is, but no air is filling his lungs. He's just gasping uselessly, heart pounding too fast, mind scrubbed of everything except
"Dean, it's alright, I can drive tonight," Sam replies quietly, digging the keys back out of his pocket.
Tucked under the base of the bedside lamp, there's a neat stack of sticky notes and scraps of paper. Dean recognizes his own handwriting on the exposed corners and edges. Curiosity will surely kill him if he doesn’t snoop now.
Dean feels all the pains in his body begin to blissfully cease, but he can't even react. Cas touching his lips was more than enough to render him entirely speechless.
Dean can't bear the longing anymore. Tears slip out unbidden, and he's helpless to hold them back this time.
Making his way to the bed, Dean kicks his slippers off, and he crawls underneath the blanket behind where Cas is sitting.
His voice doesn't falter. It's a pitifully little victory, but one that feels significant, because usually it's Cas doing the comforting. Watching Cas be the one to break down…that's a special kind of painful.
Castiel looks frail and vulnerable in death, like a man who has finally found sleep after years and years without it. Almost peaceful. Those eyes that had held the raw divinity to crumble mountains, but in equal measure such quiet tenderness, closed forever. Dean already misses them so terribly.
Dean obeys, and Sam clambers awkwardly into the driver's seat as soon as it's empty, adjusting it for his longer frame. Dean slumps dejectedly in the passenger seat, feeling frayed and defeated. He shuts the door, not even bothering to try and slam it, and just sits there like a kid in time out. He wants so badly to at least put on a show of his usual attitude, but he's drained. There's no point.
The light is orange at first, a rich golden orange like California poppies, and the wispy clouds in the sky are dashed with brightness at their edges. There's a slight breeze that ruffles Dean's hair, and maybe it's just being here, but it reminds him of the way that Cas used to absently pet him in passing. How that gentle touch had made his spine tingle, and the fond way Cas' hand would linger when he wasn't in a hurry.
Dean has a death grip on the wheel, knuckles rigid and pale, the skin stretched taut where all the cuts from the mirror are trying to close up. Some of them have reopened more than once. Some of them are bleeding even now, in a slow trickle. Dean's hands are filthy with dried blood.
I would like to formally apologize for how long this took. I would also like to officially blame my ADHD. I have v little experience writing prawns so plz pardon me if this is ass.
Dean lies awake for hours in the dark, trying to tune out the cacophony in his head, afraid to fall asleep.
At some point, that had been another choice they never really discussed. Cas calls first, when he's lucid. They pretend there was no particular reason, but they both know that's bullshit.
That last plea showed up unbidden in his head before he could stop it. He hopes, suddenly, that Cas isn't listening. What was he
"I'm scared to death, Cas. I…I really thought you were gone for good this time, and…and I was fucked up, okay? I couldn't bounce back, I couldn't even cope…" Dean draws a shaky breath. "I-I can't lose you again. I can't. I'm sorry, I just
Dean drags his hands over his face, slowly letting his breath out. That caring tone makes him want to break down entirely, just shatter and become nothing. He doesn't deserve anyone's care. And he doesn't want it anyway, because it would make him feel, and he just can't feel right now.
Trying to ignore that thought, he wraps a towel around his hips, drags one hand across the heavily fogged mirror, and catches a look at himself. Empty eyes stare back, rimmed with dark circles, the beginnings of a bruise blossoming beneath the left one. Dean's hair is still drenched, the water rolling down his face, where it dilutes a slow trickle of blood from a split lip he's only just noticed.
Cas is. He reaches up to grip Cas' hand before he can think, and holds on like it's the edge of a cliff.
For the next four nights, Dean sleeps fitfully, with nobody to stand outside his door, and it's fucking horrible. He lies awake in the dark again now, too shaken to go back to sleep.
Dean presses his eyes shut harder, til he's seeing stars, til his ears ring. Opens them. Lets the colored static clear from his vision.
Cas looks a little exasperated. "Telling me you're okay when you're not," he says plainly. "You don’t have to play invincible for me, Dean. Never. No matter how broken you may think you are, I will still…"
Dean stares at the shadow for a long time, not even blinking, curious or scared or relieved or maybe all of those. There's no movement.
But there's a silhouette in that glow, a familiar shape standing in the dark, making its way slowly forward.
"We…we should fuel up before getting back on the road," Sam says slowly. "I'm gonna do a breakfast run. There's a corner store like 10 minutes away on foot." A pause. Then, "Are you okay to stay here or do you want to come with?"
He had immediately pulled a U-turn and started driving back to Kansas. This time, he was speeding on the off chance of outrunning the anguish he knew would catch up to him.
But every time he sees his angel's face again, sees those pretty blue eyes crinkle at the corners, sees those increasingly harrowed features soften when the call connects, Dean feels the tiny flame of hope within him get a bit warmer, a bit taller, if just for a little while. It's only a matter of time before it dies back down to blue again, but it's all he's got.
Dean stops for breath, his face hot, fingers curling restlessly, waiting for a reaction. Searching Sam's eyes for something besides kindness. But Sam just nods.
"Can I talk to you for a second?" He leads Cas through the doorway and into a corner where Sam can't spectate. Even though Sam already knows the whole scoop.
"I will," Cas repeats with conviction. "And Dean," he goes on, and with a gentle touch, he slowly moves the hand on Dean's shoulder down to where the scar used to be. "I have never regretted this."
"Sit," he orders, and Dean doesn’t argue, but he does sit as grudgingly as he can muster. It's not a lot.
Dean's mind fills with static as he takes in Cas' words. He tries to hide from the conclusion, tries to think about anything else, but it's no use. His days of being able to contact Cas have always been numbered, and now that number has gotten way too small to ignore. He didn't have a plan for when his plan ran out of steam.
"Cas what the…h-how are you —" Dean begins, but the angel presses a finger against his lips, sending another chill through him and effectively shutting him up faster than he's ever shut up before. Between the array of intense emotions washing over him at Castiel's touch alone, and the entire half of his brain that's short circuiting at Cas being here at all, Dean can’t function.
"Dean…" Cas finally says, slowly and quietly. "Are you sure you understand what it is you're asking for?"
After the confrontation— first with Cas in that hospital, then Sam in the parking lot— Dean goes to war with himself, torn over his decision. Afraid he's made a fatal mistake by promising to put a pin in his plan. He had sworn to himself that he wouldn’t let his emotions get in the way of it, but here he is, conceding anyway.
" He demands. "So you're gonna just waltz off to Heaven with some random ass angel and, what? Find the mean girls table and ask for some gossip? And what's the backup plan if someone wants you dead, huh? Puppy dog eyes?!"
For another few days, Castiel's protective shadow wards off the evils in Dean's subconscious, and it's pure bliss. Dean gives up pretending it was all a dream the next day; he was wide awake the next time Cas showed up, and there was no getting around it. He falls asleep facing the door now, snuggled deep in his blankets, glad that nobody will ever find out how much he loves this.
offa me Sam, I can handle myself just fine!" He'd intended to just snap at his brother, but the words come out of his mouth as a shout. "And we ain't gonna bring him inside, we're gonna bring him
Dean flops down on his bed and stares at the ceiling. "Cas, you better come back in one piece," he sighs.
Cas goes on after that, keeps on murmuring comforting words into Dean's ear, and Dean lets those words ease away his tension and stress, slowly but surely.
When Sam returns, Dean locks the pain back up, just like he has to. Like he's supposed to. Though a frayed part of him does want to let it all go, to sob into Sam's shoulder until he can't breathe, the part of him that instinctively stomps his emotions down is
He's tried so hard, but he's failing to settle his nerves, still reeling from the horror of coming way too close to watching his brother die. A couple of seconds— that's all it would've taken for Dean to be too late to save him. The wraith had already gotten a few stabs in. Just one more would've been the end. Sammy lost so much blood on that drive back, and Dean had been so frantic he could barely stay on the road. He was in tears when he saw Cas, barreling through the bunker door before the car had even stopped, hands already glowing.
Dean runs his hands through his hair, eyes darting around the room as if he might find something to ease all this confusion. Finding, of course, nothing, Dean decides right then and there that he's going to hide in his room. All day.
telling Cas how he feels. He just has no earthly idea when or how to actually do it. "Fuck off, Sam," he grumbles as an afterthought.
Dean lifts himself up on one elbow. "Okay guilty as charged but I'm not fucking blackout, Cas," he says. "Just sayin' the shit I don't have the nuts to say
Cas reaches out, touches his screen with a trembling hand, because that's the closest he can get to touching Dean. "I could never," he whispers. And he looks into Dean's eyes, just like he has so many times before, except this is the last time.
He flips sluggishly through the pages, until he finds a long, boring, wordy section on proper sentence structure, and hands it back to Cas, feeling incredibly self-conscious.
Turns out actually posting things makes me wanna go finish them so WIPs are bout to start flying out the gate homies
Dean keeps his eyes shut. He breathes, tells himself he's gotta get used to this, he's gotta breathe, he's
The library is nearly dark except for the amber glow of a single lamp farther in, leading Dean to think at first that maybe nobody is here after all.
Dean stares at it for several seconds, frozen, heart in his mouth. Up above ground, a storm crashes through the woods, heavy rain and raging gusts of wind battering the trees. Dean is hyper focused on the muddled noise, trying to distract himself from his mounting uncertainty.
he banished Castiel, and he agonizes over it during the long hours of insomnia, wishing he hadn't done it but unable to get his brain to let him take it back.
Dean wonders if he ought to be jerking off or something. That's what people do in the shower. But when he considers the actual effort that would take, one lousy orgasm hardly sounds worth it. He shuts off the shower.
"There's so much I want to say to you," Cas is saying, "but there will never be enough time. I want you to know that I don't blame you. And I don't want you to blame yourself. The time that I've had with you has been the best part of my life, and I have lived such a long, long time. I am so sorry it has to end like this. But Dean, I will love you until my sanity breathes its last. I will think of you until I can no longer think. I only wish I could offer more."
"Try and get some sleep, man, for fucks sake." He says, sounding far too tired himself. Dean accepts it wordlessly, and Sam squeezes his shoulder briefly before steering the Impala back to the road.
Dean doesn't touch Cas at first, because the fact he's lying in bed makes it feel too intimate, too much like overstepping.
bad, way longer than he cares to calculate. He doesn't know exactly when it happened. These feelings had just crept up on him over the years, knitting themselves into his very being until they were as much a part of him as he was of them. Until it felt like they'd always been inside him, waiting to be set free, stretching towards the angel like plants to the sun. Giving him a source of hope and purpose even when he would’ve had none.
Just, not this time. Cas has finally pulled Dean out of his own personal Hell, and Dean is never, ever going back.
There's a hushed ringing sound like a distant wind chime, as pale golden light illuminates the room for a moment. Dean gives a slight shiver at the brief sensation of a hundred tiny threads connecting him to Castiel. He closes his eyes, feels the pain fade to tingling warmth as Castiel's grace gently mends him. By the time the glow dies out and Dean realizes he's sighing softly, it's a little too late to bite it off.
Cas holds him, cards his fingers through Dean's hair and softly whispers words Dean can't quite make out. Dean focuses on his voice, and somehow,
Castiel pads slowly forward, and settles on the edge of Dean's bed, angling himself towards Dean. He says nothing. He just sits there, a warm, real, protective presence, and it's taking all of Dean's self control to keep from collapsing against his shoulder, and letting it all go.
He didn't have to say that. Dean knows he'd woken up and seen the empty bottles. The redundant statement is just a badly disguised offer to "talk about it," as Sam is so fond of doing.
"I'm fine." Dean throws the door open and brushes past Sam with his head down, shredded hands dripping a trail on the floor. Sam follows cautiously as Dean pulls a coat on and stalks to the front door.
"Dean, you...you called for Cas," Sam says quietly, and Dean can hear, because he knows it all too well, how difficult it had been to say that name.
It's not nearly as scary as Dean expected it to be. It feels right, natural. It feels like he's done this a hundred times and he'll do it a thousand more.
And Dean didn't. He'd booked it directly to his car without even packing anything for the 6 hour drive. He'd peeled out onto the road without a word to anyone, and went dangerously above the speed limit for hours in silence. When he was around 200 miles from Pontiac, he had texted Cas.
if I don’t watch him burn myself. But I need you to go easy on yourself, man. Taking the blame for this…it's gonna destroy you, Dean." Sam pauses for a breath, then finishes quietly, "That's not what he would've wanted. I just want you to know I'm in this with you. That's all."
"Wishful thinking's a helluva drug, Sammy," he says gruffly as he strides back to the table, opening one of the beers before he's even sat down. Sam starts to say something, but Dean cuts him off.
The phone rings a few times before Cas answers and a grainy video flickers on. His features are lit only by the glow of a screen on minimum brightness, painting ghostly shadows under his bloodshot eyes. He looks like hell, but still takes Dean's breath away. It's suddenly hitting him— how long it's been since he's seen his angel's face. How did he go this long without it?
"Cas?" Dean breathes as tears well up in his eyes. "Cas, no…no, I still—I still need you…there's so much I still have to say, I…I can't let you go yet…"
Dean closes his eyes and does as he's told, nodding even though he knows Cas can't actually see him. His chest feels tight and strained, but he pulls in as much air as he's able.
Because deep down, he knows he was trying to fill a void with those men, a void where Castiel had once been.
High on adrenaline driving back, Dean had felt awesome, victorious. Invincible. But he crashes hard, and by the time he comes home, he feels like he's only half alive.
"Oh, Dean," Cas says painfully, "I am sure you're tired of hearing me say that I'm sorry. And I wouldn't undo the choices I've had to make. But I will always regret that our time together was cut so short. For that I could never apologize enough."
Why the fuck has he waited this long? Until he's about to lock himself up in a box in the goddamn ocean?
need you back here, buddy." Dean tugs clumsily at the back of Castiel's coat. "C'monnn, stop being so serious," he whines.
When he looks up again, Dean is staring into the dark mirror of his phone screen, the red icon in the middle flashing to indicate the end of the call.
Cas shifts a little to face him, one knee up on the bed. He's reluctant, and Dean can see Cas is trying not to take advantage of him. It's sweet, but Dean doesn’t have the patience for it.
Dean feels his blood run frigid. He tries to say something, but all that comes out is a strangled noise.
"It's alright Dean. We…we don’t need light." He speaks with an odd tone. Almost sad. He sits on the bed slowly, reaches out and touches Dean's face, brushing a thumb over his cheekbone.
Dean pauses with the fridge open, feeling his face start to burn despite the frosty air pouring out at him. He reaches in, crams three beers into his hand, and shuts the fridge.
"If there's anything you need…" Sam loves saying that right before he leaves Dean alone for a few days. "Even if you just need to talk—"
Dean had been prepared to be as good as dead, and now he feels oddly empty without that doomed anticipation.
Dean wakes with a strangled cry. His heart beats so hard, he feels like it's trying to rip its way out of him. He sits up and, almost automatically, his wild eyes find the door.
And he starts shoving it all down. Stacking all the ruins of barriers back up and slamming the doors on his agony and grief. Boarding them up and sealing the whole fucking thing in concrete. Dropping it in the ocean for good measure.
Cas barely hesitates to shed his trench coat when he walks in and softly shuts the door behind him, bathing the room in shadow. He takes his spot on the edge of the bed, gathers the coat in his hands, and drapes it over Dean's body, wrapping it closely around him with what could possibly be described as…tenderness.
"I said I'm not stopping," Dean protests, but it's less than half-hearted. His eyelids are already getting heavy again, and he's practically slurring his words. There's no fight left in him and they both know it.
The only thing Dean is sure of, is that during the day, he craves the closeness they've somehow developed at night. And he doesn't know how to approach the subject.
Watches his hands slowly, deliberately choke the life out of the angel he loves more than he's ever loved anyone.
So Dean takes a risk, and leaves his bedroom door just a little open before he goes to bed. But his heart is thundering in his ears, and he's so high strung, he can't sleep worth shit.
Dean skims over a news article about two teenagers coming home late from a roller rink, found dead and dumped in a recycling bin behind the building. He grimaces.
Sam has stolen Cas away, the two nerds off to follow up on some lead or another, and Dean is at home, under the pretense of holding down the fort. That was, of course, bullshit. Dean is actually suffering an especially chaotic day with Michael wreaking havoc in his head, and he can barely stand up without the pulsing, maddening headache inducing a wave of nausea. As a result, he hasn't eaten or even left his room all day.
"It's okay if you can't," he hears Cas say as his eyes flutter shut, and he stares into the great big nothing, and it's peaceful. Nothing hurts in this void.
"I'll call you," Dean will answer, to placate him. If he's got the will, he'll even throw in a tired, forced smile that he's not even sure is fooling anyone. Smiles help people think you're telling them the truth. Smiles help people think you're more stable than you actually are. Smiles create an impression that you're going to get better.
Dean doesn’t go back to sleep this time, but for reasons a whole lot different than the ones he's used to.
Dean doesn't speak for a full couple of minutes. He doesn’t move. The silence stretches thinner, tenser with every passing second. A drop of blood falls from his right hand, the tiny splash like a firecracker, separating Dean from his trance.
Just the sensation of Castiel's warm skin against his own makes Dean feel like he's melting into a puddle. A slight shiver runs through him, and his resolve to stay locked up starts breaking apart with every passing moment.
Dean takes a long, ragged breath. "Go back to sleep, Sammy," he mumbles, turning to face away from his brother.
All the sorrow that's been hiding behind the ability to still contact Cas—it's free now, free to torment him as it wishes.
Dean's eyes snap open. The room still seems too big. A street lamp outside the window bathes everything in sickly orange stripes.
In those delicious scraps of time, when the loveless pleasure takes over, scrubbing his mind clean of the parts that tell him no, Dean allows himself to live in a world where he hadn't been so scared. A world where he had confessed how he felt and those feelings were reciprocated.
that voice is so fucking soothing it's not even fair. "Breathe. You're okay. You're okay…just breathe with me, alright? Breathe in, slowly, okay?"
"You drank the bar last night," Sam states, his voice thin and tired, but level. He starts slowly unwrapping the soaked gauze from Dean's hands, taking care to avoid the many cuts.
"You’ve had a rough day," Castiel says softly, snapping Dean out of the daze he'd just about fallen into. It's not a question, and Dean knows that’s on purpose, the sneaky bastard. He's not offering Dean a chance to deny it.
"Don't you forget me, Cas," Dean pleads in a shaking voice. Logically he knows that the likelihood of Cas forgetting him is very low, but he's not running on logic right now. "Please just—just don't forget me, okay?"
Dean is regretting every fucking choice he's made that led up to this. He feels so trapped, so lonely even though he's never alone anymore.
Dean plays dumb, and he's not really sure why. Maybe to buy himself time for more excuses. Maybe he doesn’t want to admit he's been called out. Or maybe he wants and
After a few seconds Dean pulls himself together. This is no time to be a miserable piece of shit. He has to get Cas home.
drug is doing as much good as he can manage, in as little time as possible. And it never hurts to put a little distance between Dean and Jack. So Dean just accepts it, going through the motions, but more and more often he's crawling back to another vice, despite Sam's attempts to keep him from self destruction.
Dean was struck speechless, only able to stutter a handful of syllables for a few seconds. His voice was trembling when he finally found it.
It's almost too quiet until a sudden rustle directly behind Dean startles him into full alertness. He scrambles back from the door on instinct, then freezes when the source of the sound dawns on him.
Sometimes Dean wakes up in a total panic. Sometimes he cries out in his sleep. Sometimes his eyes will snap open and he'll just lie there trembling, hands clenched tight, in the throes of some hellish memory.
Dean nods, propping his phone up right next to his pillow as he settles into bed. He flips on the bedside lamp and curls up next to Cas.
Sam fidgets uncomfortably, watching the two of them as tension rises rapidly in the room. Dean crosses his arms and stares at Cas. Truth be told he's scared out of his wits to see Cas putting himself in danger
Dean would gladly spend another 40 in Hell, more even, if it meant he could absolve whatever sins made him deserve this. He'd do time for Cas too, for whatever Cas did to deserve this, if that's what it would take. But nobody is answering prayers anymore. That's just the way it is.
It still takes a while for Dean to settle down enough to sleep, but Cas stays on the line with him until he does, and then a little longer until he can't keep his eyes open anymore.
"We should sleep," Dean croaks, hating himself for it, knowing he's refusing help, but simply unable to do otherwise.
Dean fixes his gaze intently on the floor, biting his lip, eyes darting frantically, searching for something that doesn't exist.
"Sure," Sam agrees, cracking open a beer of his own. "And don't worry about Cas, okay? He'll be alright."
He pulls on an old pair of sweatpants with holes in the knees that he's had for who knows how long. The faint scent of soy sauce, from the time Dean stashed leftover takeout in his duffel bag, still lingers on them after several washes.
Giving up, Dean falls into the haze. He wraps an arm tightly around his pillow for some sad semblance of comfort, and slips into unconsciousness.
"No, man, I just like to haunt the bunker in the middle of the night like a pajama wearing ghost," Dean says with a weak laugh.
Cas is so warm, so alive but so peaceful, and he can feel the angel's rhythmic breaths against his face, and it's lulling him to sleep.
Catching feelings ruins friendships and you know it," Dean snaps back, standing up. "I need a fucking drink for this conversation." He stomps off to the kitchen.
Dean pounds on the coffin's walls, claws desperately at them until his fingers are a shredded mess, skin peeled raw, nails split or missing. Useless.
"Listen to me, Dean." His voice is low and commanding, and Dean immediately feels his pulse react unbidden. "That extremely powerful, dangerous child is
"You're afraid. I can see that," Cas says softly, reaching out to settle one hand very carefully on Dean's shoulder. Dean leans into it, his half-hearted resolve to resist the urge crumbling in less than a second. He can't help it.
Eventually, Cas brings his hand to Dean's forehead, and Dean relaxes, allowing it. With a light touch, Castiel's grace envelops him in a blanket of calm, peaceful silence.
"Fuck," Dean mutters aloud, because sometimes cursing is the only response he has for things that scare him. And that voice scares him, because it made some good points.
There's a hole in the back of Cas' trench coat, blood soaking the fabric around it, torn threads sticking to the inside of the wound. The angel's face is drawn and pale,
Dean chokes back the heaving sob that wants to escape his throat, and holds his breath, eyes fixed on the door. He hopes Cas doesn't know he's awake.
except listen to the shuddering breaths Cas is taking, and Dean knows (because he's done this so many times himself) that he's trying to regain his composure.
He's about to go look somewhere else when the sound of a page turning nearly gives him a heart attack.
Dean barely remembers actually waking up and entering the dimly lit hotel room. It's their usual digs: water-stained carpets, two mediocre beds, a sad little TV that the 90's wants back, ugly partitions nobody ever asked for, and a small, passable bathroom that smells a little too much like air freshener to actually be clean.
After a moment Dean finally nods once, staring down at the floor. He doesn’t like it, but this is what he's getting.
He brushes the back of his hand gently against Dean's face, drawing an involuntary shiver out of him. Cas withdraws too soon, but the warm, faint electricity of his tender touch still remains, and Dean closes his eyes, letting it sink into him.
Dean snatches his phone and pulls it under the blanket with him, a little cave with only the light of his screen to illuminate its inhabitants.
Suddenly the sound of his own heartbeat is far too loud, his ragged breathing like a fork scraping against teeth. His ears ring, a piercing, endless screech. Frigid terror starts to clench around his lungs and he feels like he might be sick as the room wavers.
It's close to 4 AM, and Dean is settled by the door after waking from a particularly visceral nightmare. He has a blanket pulled tightly around as much of his body as he can manage to cover, but he still can't stop shivering. Every time he's sure he'll finally start to warm up, another part of him feels cold and exposed, unprotected.
Instead of waiting for a reply, he simply snatches the keys from Sam and gets in, not looking at his brother even once, and slams the door hard. Sam joins him, with significantly less aggression. He doesn’t argue.
Dean decides to go with that, because if he doesn't, then he has to go with "Cas sang me to sleep" which is much more difficult to even
That's the last thought to dissolve in Dean's head before he finally gives in, sinking into a deep sleep like warm sand.
Dean really thought that when the end was actually here, he'd have some miraculous clarity, that he'd be able to suddenly put together everything he wanted to say and deliver it without a single hitch.
He stares at the phone like it's just burst into flames, as two rings go by, then three, then four. He can't see the screen from where he's lying, but he
Two empty beer bottles sit on the nightstand, labels peeled off and a little bit of water inside. Air plants had been placed in the neck of each bottle, one small and spiky, the other cascading gracefully over the edge of its container. Pale rings of water damage have scarred the wood beneath them where Cas has put the bottles in different spots.
Dean wondered how to explain this to Charlie when he wasn’t sure he understood it himself. He didn’t want to make an ass out of himself or embarrass Cas. But he also didn’t want to without too much and make it harder to get answers.
The Winchester parked his truck across the street, got out, and made his way up the stairs to the front door, trying to keep his excitement down. He knocked and waited. A few moments later, a man answered the door.
“Sam, just leave it.” Dean sounded exasperated. He had blown off some steam during the hunt, chopping heads was great therapy, and he didn't want to get back into this now.
Now Sam was even more curious. Dean had finally admitted that there was something wrong, and whether or not he'd been evasive, that was progress. Sam wanted to push his brother for more info, but the truth was, if Dean didn't want to talk, he wasn't going to talk.
“But-” Castiel says, saving Dean from his mental spiral. “I am truly exhausted, and I’ve missed you so much these last few days. Would it be alright if we continue this conversation tomorrow?”
Dean's voice cracked a little when he mentioned the angel's name. He looked down and away quickly, clearing his throat in an effort to cover it up. If Sam noticed, he didn't say anything about it, just continued to pack the trunk of the new piece of shit car Dean had stolen while the Impala was on lockdown.
Sam couldn't finish his sentence, shocked into silence by the sight before him. Tucked under the sheets were Dean and Cas, in a very intimate position. Dean was mostly on his back, his one arm flopped on his stomach, the other wrapped around Cas. The angel in question was tucked up against the hunter's side, his head on Sam's brother's chest, one arm wrapped around Dean's waist, his hand curled into a light fist, bunching the material of Dean's grey t-shirt. Dean's head rested against the angel's as he snored softly. Both were sound asleep. Sam's barely there smirk grew to a full on grin before he knew it.
Something that his stiff muscles are reminding him of now. His back aches from the twisted position he’d fallen asleep in, and the tips of his fingers are slightly numb. As he stretches, he becomes aware that Castiel is not in bed next to him. For a horrifying moment, he thinks last night had been a dream and that today they would still feel miles apart while they were in the same room. His eyes fly open and he sits up so quickly his vision swims. Heart in his throat, Dean scans the room for proof Castiel was here last night.
“Hello, Beth.” Though he didn't smile, and his voice conveyed little emotion, Beth could tell he was friendly. She smiled once more at him before turning to Dean.
“I like it, Cas,” Dean says, ignoring the burning in his cheeks. Somehow, this feels more intimate, more vulnerable, than any time they’ve had sex. “I wanted to do it, okay?”
They drove for a few more minutes in silence before Sam spotted a gas station up the road. Deciding now was as good a time as any to call Bobby, he pulled in and told Emanuel to wait in the truck while he went to pay for gas.
Out of sheer frustration, Bobby hurled his journal across the room. It hit the wall hard with a satisfyingly loud bang. When Bobby finally calmed himself down enough to pick up the journal, he noticed a card on the floor beside it. Picking it up and turning it over, the ball-caped man noticed a phone number on the back that he hadn't seen at first.. Thinking 'what the hell', Bobby decided to call and see if whoever it was could help. No one answered, but he left his number and a message telling them to call him back when they could. Not having any idea who he'd called, he'd been fairly vague, only saying that he was looking for a faith healer. He figured the number at least belonged to someone in the hunting community, he didn't really know anyone who wasn't.
Cas had taken a few days to consider their offer, and on the morning when he’d announced, over pancakes no less, that he’d made his choice, Dean nearly puked. Just as he’d been thinking he could never eat pancakes again, Cas had said that he was going to stay.
“For your heat,” Dean said, pulling out his phone to text Sam as he explained it to Cas. “There’s special underwear and heat sheets that will help contain any, uh, mess we make, and keep you cooler. Snack food so we don’t have to cook is important. Um, a heating pad and ginger tea to help with cramps-”
"Hey guys, thanks for having us." He said into the microphone. "We're called Dime a Dozen, and we'll be doing songs by other, more well known bands cause we have almost no creativity. So uh...yeah. Hope you guys have a good time."
He took Dean’s hand and lead it to his boxers where he was soft. Dean’s eyes widened as he looked down to confirm what he’d felt.
Sam watched with wide eyes and a gaping mouth, shocked not only by Dean's new strength, but by the pleasure he had taken in killing Magnus.
“Okay. Well, if you’re experiencing this, then that means you feel safe, right? Isn’t that a good thing?”
The ex-angel only grabbed a fistful of the hunter's shirt and pulled himself up more. His lips brushed against Dean's ear, in a way that probably would have been intimate had the person doing it not been drunk and uncoordinated.
Then Sam stuck his head in the door to see what was going on, and the alpha instinct to protect his omega hit Dean hard. He pushed Sam back before he realized what he was doing, aggressively removing his brother from the room
The sun filtered through the thick trees and lit up the outside of the house in a soft, red glow. Dean barely noticed. He briefly checked that the sigils and traps were still in place, then grabbed his shotgun out of the trunk of his car, and started doing a check around the place.
Castiel smiled, tilting his head up for a kiss that Dean was happy to indulge. They stayed like that, holding each other under the warm spray of the shower for several minutes. When Cas pulled back, he had a gentle smile on his face.
The thing was, Castiel didn’t know how to ask why Dean rejected his touch, even when Dean was the one who instigated most of the times they had sex. And he knew even less how to ask for what he wanted. But as bad as he was at asking for information, Dean was even worse at volunteering it. Especially if that information made him feel vulnerable. Part of Castiel wanted to leave it alone, for Dean’s sake. If he wasn’t bringing it up himself, and didn’t seem unhappy, then was there really a need to make him feel embarrassed by asking?
“Yeah, Cas, I was. I wasn't suicidal, but...I don't know.” He finally looked the angel in the eye. “Maybe some nights I slept with the safety off.”
When they finally parted after several long moments, Dean felt more relaxed than he had in weeks. He grinned at Cas, unbelievably happy in that moment. There were still unshed tears in Castiel’s eyes, but they were happy tears.
Cas laid out in the middle of their bed, sweaty and flush. There was absolutely no smell of sex in the room, and no sign of anyone else in there. But the smell was coming from this room, so that must mean-
The older hunter was staring off into the distance, his eyes glazed over and his face a blank slate.
Cas groaned, burying his face into his pillow and looking like he wanted the bed to swallow him whole. Dean didn’t know what to say, but he was pretty sure saying the right thing was important right now.
Whoever was calling paused, obviously not recognizing the voice on the other end. It finally replied.
By now Cas is breathing more heavily against his neck, nose nuzzling down his shoulder in between kisses.
Cas knew that Dean travelled a lot, switched cars, safe houses, everything, and the angel was so touched that his hunter had kept the coat throughout all of that. That each time he'd switched car, he'd gone into the trunk or backseat, taken the over coat out, and then put it in his next vehicle. It gave Castiel hope that he and Dean might still be able to get through this after all. Dean wouldn't have kept the coat if he didn't still care on some level.
Dean smiled, pulling Cas closer and pumping out pheromones that he hoped Cas would find comforting and relaxing.
“If I ask, he’s just gonna feel guilty, or think I’m not happy. I don’t wanna pressure him. I’ll wait as long as he needs.”
Every time one of those little mundane things popped into his head, it was like a punch to the gut, and he could feel his heart clench painfully again. He had gotten so used to having it so good, so perfect, just for a little bit, and now the bed was too big and too cold with only one person in it, and Dean couldn't sleep without dreaming he was holding his angel again. And every morning he woke up from that imagined bliss to find the bed painfully empty and cold beside him, and he fought back the lump in his throat, and made himself get up. Because he had to.
Sam took in a deep breath. There was a very good chance Dean would react violently to what his younger brother was about to say, especially if Sam was wrong.
Bobby shook his head and stormed off. Dean sighed, if they would just let him deal with this on his own...
“Dean,” Castiel interrupts gently. “I’m not comfortable sharing this bed when I know you’re lying to me.”
Dean felt sick jealousy twist his gut, but ignored it. This wasn’t about him and whatever feelings he pretended not to have for Cas. This was about easing his best friend’s pain and supporting him through this. No matter how much the idea of someone else touching Castiel that way made him want to break something.
Dean laughed, imagining that must be a bigger part of the delivery driver experience than most people knew.
The next day, around four in the afternoon, Sam pulled up outside the house Matthew had given him the address for. He was exhausted, having only stopped three times on his way here. Twice for a bathroom break/coffee refill, and once for a short nap on the side of the road when he'd started head bobbing at the wheel. But, at least he'd made it.
“It was more unpleasant when you left,” Castiel said, taking a huge bite out of the first sandwich. Some jam dripped down his fingers and he eagerly licked it off. Dean waited for the shot of lust to hit him in the gut, but it didn’t come. “Worse than before you got home.”
Now there were only two flaps blocking his view of what the delivery man had been paid so high to bring out. The hunter frowned at the dark stains that he could now see on the flaps of the package.
Dean was laying on an old, beat up couch in the cabin. One leg dangling off the side, his foot flat on the dusty floor, the other leg flopped over the arm rest, dangling awkwardly and swinging lightly. His outside arm cradled his head, while his other was busy lifting a flask to his mouth.
Fuck. No, he can’t. He can’t because Cas might not be an angel anymore, but he would know how uncomfortable Dean is the second he sees his face. If he’d waited until tomorrow, if he’d just given Dean another day to come back to himself, Dean would have been able to fake it face to face.
When he enters the kitchen, Castiel is sitting at the table with a cup of coffee, reading his Russian book from the night before. Dean knows Cas prefers to read in the library, he’s even got a cozy little space set up in one corner just for himself. He’d furnished it with a garish chair that must have survived the 60s if the bright pattern of birds covering it was any indication. Beside it sat a worn end table, and a simple lamp with a pink shade. All of which they found at the same garage sale for the low bundle price of $20. When they were researching a hunt, Castiel joined him and Sam at the tables, but when he was reading for pleasure, Dean could find him in his chair.
The look Dean gave Cas was almost pleading. But there was something else in there. A hope that the hunter was trying to hide. Castiel hoped that meant Dean felt the same.
He felt a happy sigh against his neck before Cas was returning the favour. Kissing and licking and sucking over the spot that usually drove Dean wild. For a moment he expected to feel himself getting hard, pressed up against a naked, wet Cas while having his mating gland nibbled. But it didn’t happen. He felt happy and relaxed and loved, but not aroused.
At that, Cas lifted his head from the pillows to look at Dean. There was confusion and surprise in his face, but also hope.
Once he was close enough, he hammered on the brakes and cranked the wheel to the side, effectively sliding the car sideways and blocking the road. He opened his door and got out, aiming his 9 mm at the front window of the van.
Everyone had called back. He'd checked every resource he had at his disposal, as well as a few he didn't, and he'd found nothing. He'd been reading up on depression, loss, and coping, and it all seemed like horse shit. No way Dean would agree with any of it. He'd been raise to hide his problems, and resolve them in private with booze and spurts of violence. All this 'talking it out' and 'try changing your routine' crap would not work on the hunter.
Dean shrugs again. “Wasn’t planning on it. If you’re hungry, we got your disgusting raisin cinnamon bagels from the store yesterday.”
“Yes.” he finally said. He watched as emotions he couldn't read flashed across his brother's face in seconds. Dean finally seemed to make up his mind about what to do, and he shouldered past Sam and out the front door, letting it slam behind him.
The whole bar fell silent again at the outburst, and even Dean stopped short. Sam glared at the asshole in front of him, his fist clenched and his hole body tense, ready to take another swing. Dean stared at his brother in shock, mouth gaping before he forced himself to close it.
The angel could only imagine what Bobby must think of him now, how he must feel, but Cas wanted the chance to try and explain. He would much rather talk to Dean first, but he was also aware that there was no way Bobby would let him leave without some idea of what happened and why the angel had let it happen. He owned him that much.
He could feel his restraints warping, heard them groaning and creaking. The noise angered him more. Finally, there was a loud snap, and the pressure against his chest released.
He wishes they could just keep doing this. The kissing is nice, and he loves how Cas traces the muscles in his back delicately, like he’s touching something precious. He doesn’t even mind Cas moaning against his mouth, or the breathy noises that escape him when Dean finds a particularly sensitive spot on his neck. But it’s the anticipation of where this is leading that kills his enjoyment.
Pulling away, Dean wiped the tears from his own face, taking a shaky breath. Every muscle in his body screamed him not to do what he was about to do. But Cas had asked him, so he was going to. He was going to help Cas end it.
“Will you... stay? For the rest of my heat, I mean. I know Sam is looking for a hunt, but it’s only a few more days, and-”
And because perfect moments couldn’t last long, Cas’s stomach grumbled loudly in the silence, making him and Dean laugh.
“Well, I know this beta who’s ace. When she came out, her family sent her to a bunch of doctors because they figured something was wrong with her. They even gave her drugs to induce a presentation, because they thought she was just a late presenting omega.”
“I feel... tremendous shame,” Castiel says. “I feel like I used you each time we were intimate. When I think about it, I feel sick. What I did to you... I don’t know how you can look at me, much less touch me now.”
“Cas, I swear that I will do everything in my power to make sure I never leave you. I...” Dean's voice cracked, but he was determined to get the words out, Cas needed to know.
"We don't understand the lore, Dean! You think we're just gonna walk in there tomorrow and kill those things without anything to go off of?"
Dean feels his heart drop. Maybe Cas won’t stay after all. Maybe this is too big, and Dean just blew the best thing that ever happened to him. He could hardly blame Cas if he left after this, but that wouldn’t stop it from hurting.
Screw it. Dean hadn’t been one for making people learn the hard way since Sam broke his arm when they were kids. He knew how to make this better, and damn it, Cas was going to let him.
Dean couldn’t help the shiver that ran through him then. One hand pressed into Cas’s back, while the other tangled its way into the omega’s wet hair, encouraging him to keep doing what he was doing.
Cas whined, but relented when Dean promised he would take his turn to be pampered after Cas was through his heat. For now, he allowed Dean to dry him off and fetch him a pair of heat briefs, along with clean sweats and a t-shirt.
“I saw at the demons and it was almost instinctual, I knew I could kill them. When I smote them, my memories came back.” he explained, as if reading from a text book. As if this was the sorta thing that happened all the time, and he was merely explaining it, rather than just figuring it out himself. His hard gaze softened a bit before he spoke again. “Sam, I am so sorry for what I did to you, I should never have broken your wall. I will try to fix you.”
“Sam, I know I owe you an explanation, but I feel that I should speak with Dean first. If his condition is as bad as you say,” Cas looked down ashamedly. “...then he needs help soon.”
Castiel nods and relaxed a little, but there is still some hesitation there. Dean can sense that Cas is keeping himself at a distance while their new boundaries are being established. He’s scared of accidentally crossing one again, and while Dean understands that, he wishes everything could go back to how easy it was before.
“You’re up early,” Sam grumbles. He's used to having the bunker to himself for a while in the morning, and Dean is throwing off his routine.
“You so sure that's a good idea, Sam?” Bobby cautioned. "The last one you guys found wasn't exactly squeaky clean or innocent. How do you know you can find the real deal? Not to mention, I never heard of one that can 'cure' sadness. They cure sickness, don't they?"
Dean left Sam in the library, forcing himself to walk at a normal speed to Cas’s room. When he got there, he hesitated. What if Cas was sleeping? Or if going from a warrior of Heaven to a sick human embarrassed him? What if Dean was overreacting? Dean shook his head. He knew he was just looking for an out so he didn’t have to risk learning something more serious was wrong with his friend.
, but he smelled like an uncomfortable, unhappy omega. That scent had Dean feeling almost queasy with the need to find the problem and fix it.
“Actually, I have some ideas about tonight. There’s... something I want. Something we haven’t done.”
Castiel continued to rub firm but gentle circles over that spot. At the same time, he settled Dean’s dick on his tongue and
Dean was a little annoyed that Sam hadn’t been this dedicated of a wingman when Dean was in his 20s and had spent every other night at a bar looking to score. Then, Sam had mostly ignored what Dean was doing, occasionally pulling him out of a situation if it turned sour. But he never went out of his way to give Dean more opportunities. Now, he would have to throw a box of condoms at Dean’s head to be any more obvious.
"Get out of the van!" Sam commanded, pulling back the safety on his weapon the show that he wasn't joking. The driver did as he was instructed, getting out and putting his hands up in surrender.
The Winchester stood up and stretched, pausing to let the head rush hit him. They were becoming more and more frequent lately. Lack of sleep and all that. After unsuccessfully trying to rub the spots from his eyes with the heals of his hands, he headed down to the main level to find food.
“Uh, in the meantime, you must want some fresh blankets, huh? Do you think I can move you to that chair for a minute so I can change your sheets?”
After a couple of hours in the firing range, where they were finally seeing some progress, Dean couldn’t stand it anymore. Castiel was human now, and he was living here indefinitely. With Dean training him, there was a lot of physical contact, but it was strictly professional. Platonic. And that distance was killing him. Being so close and yet it meaning nothing. He wanted his touch to have gravity and purpose. Dean wanted Castiel to know he was here, with him, because it was what he wanted most.
Dean was getting worse. He usually just stretched out on the couch upstairs, sometimes he asked for another beer, most of the time he just asked to be left alone. He only ate when Bobby practically sat with him and watched to make sure he did.
“Yeah.” Dean can still remember the fear on Jill’s face when he freaked out, and the disappointment the next day when he gave her a mostly fake explanation. The backstory didn’t matter when the conclusion was the same; no sex.
So they went about their lives. Until Cas got used to the basics of being human, he’d elected to stay behind on hunts. Dean, secretly, was relieved. Angel Castiel was a badass who could take care of himself. Human Cas was still learning the limits of his body and regularly burnt his tongue on coffee or tripped over his own feet. He needed to relearn how to fight without his powers and get comfortable with a gun before he’d be any good on a hunt.
“Look, I’m still wrapping my head around it myself, alright? But I called Charlie, and it turns out this is normal.”
An impatient whine from Dean made Castiel realize he’d stopped moving, too distracted by trying to learn and memorize the parts of Dean that were new to him. When Dean’s hands came down to tug at his hair, becoming desperate, Castiel grinned and moved again.
No matter. The bunker had dozens of rooms with beds in them. Once Dean had tossed the sheets and robe in one washer with extra soap and lots of hot water, and the comforter and pillowcases in another with a gentler, nicer smelling detergent, he went back to Cas’ room.
It would embarrass them both, but if Dean didn't stop soon, Sam was gonna tell him and Cas it was time to go. He was gearing up to do just that, when a loud, booming voice surprised him.
"Yes! Finally! I have been trying to find Cain for years to complete my collection, but now I have something better. The new Father of Murder himself."
“Alright Sam, look. There is something bugging me that I haven't been able to ignore lately, but I can deal with it myself, okay?”
“Really?” Cas asks, and Dean is up and around the table in seconds. He pulls Cas into a hug and feels a moment of hesitation before Cas is hugging him back, so tightly it’s a little difficult to breathe. Dean doesn’t care.
Bobby had actually been getting Dean to eat food at least twice a day now, but he couldn't stop the booze intake. The best he could do was dump the stuff he found. He didn't know where it was all coming from, he'd quite buying it when he saw how the oldest Winchester was downing it. Dean must be sneaking out to get it himself at night.
On the way back to the car, Dean thought over the night. Him and Cas had had a fun, easy going time. It had all gone so well, and they were both in such a good mood, Dean wondered if he should tell Cas how he felt. It would be a good night to do it, everything had gone so smoothly. But on the other hand, what if Cas didn't feel the same? What if after Dean told him, he got all weirded out and left?
“If you don’t want to, that’s one thing. But please don’t deny yourself because you think there is a single thing about your body I don’t absolutely adore.”
The bartender, Sam thought he had heard someone call him Doug, leaned further over the counter and looked Gary in the eye. His next words were almost a whisper.
Realizing that Gary wouldn't leave without some sort of response, probably because of Sam, Dean jerked his head towards the door. Gary nodded and hustled out, holding his bloody nose again.
“I... I’m sorry,” Dean says. “It just... seemed easier.” God, it sounds even more fucked up out loud than it did in his head.
Dean knows that. He also knows the longer he lets this sit, the worse it will be when it finally comes to a head. But thinking about what might happen if Castiel finds out the truth still scares him.
After Bobby and Sam had fallen asleep, Castiel had decided to meditate until morning. It was a state similar to sleeping for angels, except they were still completely aware of their surroundings. Perhaps, a little too much in Castiel's case.
Castiel watched Dean carefully, ready for anger or confusion. He knew this wasn't exactly the best way for Dean to find out he was still alive, but he hadn't been able to stay away.
Cas moved back to his place between Dean’s legs, resting on his belly, hard cock pressed into the mattress, Dean spread out before him. He kissed his way forward, inching up the inside of Dean’s thigh. His breath barely brushed where Dean was most sensitive when the legs under his hands trembled. Castiel paused, looking up at where Dean was watching him.
When Dean retrieves their sheets from the dryer, he finds Castiel looking through the linen closet in the corner.
“Got it.” the redhead rasped out. Dean nodded, before slowly letting the guy up to help his friends.
“I have one more question, though,” Castiel says. Dean expects to feel his heart drop or anxiety spike, but neither happens. Cas said he’s not going anywhere and Dean believes him.
Maybe bringing it up in bed wasn’t the best time, but Castiel had been struggling for days to find a moment that felt appropriate, and it hadn’t happened. He and Dean had hardly had more than a few moments alone lately, other than at night. And they’d been so busy that by the time they fell into bed, they were both asleep in minutes.
“Hey, Dean. I just got here, and the place is kinda busy, but I’m moving as fast as I can, alright?”
But Castiel, he was it for Dean. He was it long before they ever kissed, and if Castiel had rejected him just now and walked out of his life, he still would have been it for Dean. There was no room in his heart or soul for anyone else. He knew he would love Castiel beyond his last breath.
and tensed as if he expected yelling, or worse. Instead, Castiel had waited until Dean looked him in the eye, and gave him a reassuring smile.
Castiel hasn’t let go of his hand or looked away from his eyes once. But it doesn’t make Dean feel scrutinized or trapped, it makes him feel seen and heard.
That got a snort out of Cas, and Dean grinned back. He never wanted Cas to feel self-conscious about any of this. Heats happened. Ruts happened. It was just a part of life.
, even in the face of certain painful death, heard Castiel whine. It shocked him enough that it took a moment to find his voice again. He pushed the door open further and slipped inside.
When he reached Dean’s waistband, he stopped to look up. Dean’s pupils were blown so wide he looked high when he met Cas’s eyes, but he didn’t hesitate to nod.
“Nah, nothing ever happened between us,” Dean said. “This was later. Just before you got back. I met a guy named Rico at a bar. He was grieving too, just lost his wife of 10 years. No kids, no other family. His wife died when a lone vamp broke into their house. We hunted it down together and after... That wasn’t a relationship, that was just...”
to Cas, and it had taken months before it felt normal to say. But Cas needs to hear this stuff, and there isn’t much Dean wouldn’t do for him. Even though it feels like his blush is going to tattoo itself on his face.
He bought them both drinks. The concession didn't sell beer, which was lame in Dean's opinion, so he got them Cas' favourite pop instead. They then found their spot. Dean was proud of his last minutes tickets, they were actually good seats. Near half court and close enough to make the game enjoyable.
“And you can’t go,” Sam said. No bitching, just stating a fact. An alpha leaving an omega during their heat was not advisable. “Don’t worry, I’ll head into town. It’s been a while since I had to do a supply run for this kinda thing. Text me a list and I’ll be quick as I can.”
Castiel's pale blue eyes, bloodshot, pleading as he tries to speak, as tears roll down his face, while Dean watches helplessly from the back seat of his mind.
sparks between them again, and he wants to fucking run, but he forces his feet to bring him forward instead. Slowly, Dean lowers himself to the sofa. He's apprehensive, but as soon as he's beside Cas he sinks into the cushions despite himself, as if a good chunk of his tension just stayed where he'd been standing.
Dean let Magnus' head fall to the ground with a wet /thump/, and began stalking towards his helpless brother. He kept coming until he was inches away from him, burning eyes locked on with his brother's brown ones.
Dean’s gut clenches as guilt tries to make him stop talking. Castiel is right, Dean would never say he loves someone unless he means it. But the lie he told, has been telling for months, feels pretty close.
Mike nodded quickly. He still had his hands up, despite the fact that Sam had lowered his gun, and he pointed to the back of the van with his thumb. Sam motioned for the driver to get whatever he'd been sent to deliver.
But, a lot of people were still hyped up about the murder spree of their two doubles, so he knew it was best to lay low, and unfortunately, that meant driving this piece of shit around for a while.
Half an hour later, Cas was at least stable and resting. Dean was currently sitting in a chair he'd pulled up next to the bed, idly holding and rubbing the ex-angel's hand and starring absentmindedly at the bed.
Sam's eyes widened and he gaped at his brother for a moment, before his gaze briefly flicked to the staircase, and then over to the empty living room. Where Cas had been when they'd all gone to sleep but was now obviously absent from.
Castiel looks nauseated. Dean gives him a minute and watches as Castiel takes deep, shaking breaths that don’t do much to calm him.
Dean was having a hard time holding up Cas with one arm and trying to fish his phone out of his pocket with the other. He almost had it, when he felt something smash hard against the back of his head. Surprise sobered him up and made him let go of the angel as he turned to face his attackers, getting ready for a fight. He noticed the broken bottle on the ground, but ignored it for now. He was pretty sure he wasn't bleeding, just had a killer headache.
sounded and brought up a list of recommendations. Given that Dean and Cas shared an account, it varied the recommendations between weird documentaries and generic action films.
“Cas, that wasn’t... you didn’t hurt me the way you’re thinking. I could have told you to stop, I know that.”
She’d worked fast, in and out in less than five seconds, but even so, Castiel screamed and was sweating when she’d finished. He’d collapsed to his knees after a moment, and Dean had rushed to his side.
Cas’s scent was getting more pungent as he struggled harder to hold back tears. He held on to Dean’s hand so tightly, and that’s when everything started to make sense to Dean. Cas was scared because he thought not wanted sex would be a deal-breaker. It probably didn’t help that Dean had barely touched him since he’d gotten home. Usually Dean swept Cas up in a big hug and lots of kisses after a week away. Now, Dean had been reluctant to hold his hand because he didn’t want to make Cas uncomfortable.
“Same sort of deal. She lived in New Orleans, so me and Sam had no shortage of salt and burns to keep us occupied for a few weeks. After we cleared her house, she asked me out to dinner. I figured Jill was a long time ago, I was probably fine now. But...”
“Dean,” Cas says, in a tone Dean rarely hears anymore. He sounds worried. “How many times have we kept something from each other?”
Most of the sigils were Anasazi symbols, meant to ward against wendigos. Thankfully, despite how far north they were, Dean hadn't heard of any wendigos in Montana for years. That didn't necessarily mean there weren't any though, so he did his best to stay vigilant. Besides, if he focused on paying attention to his surroundings, he could at least lie to himself and say he wasn't thinking about Cas.
Dean sighed, briefly contemplating trying to fall back asleep. Strangely, he didn't feel like he usually did after a night of heavy drinking. No headache, no cotton mouth, no upset stomach. He almost felt like he'd simply fallen asleep, rather than blacked out.
Dean grinned. Okay, maybe he also should have told Sam to take it easy on the food. He and Cas weren’t exactly expending a lot of calories cuddling and napping. But heats were draining and uncomfortable, and if Cas wanted to spend his heat holed up in here with Dean, then snacks were perfect.
“But if you thought she was dead, why aren't you with her right now? If my guy came back like that, I would be ecstatic. You don't seem all that happy.”
They arrived at the bunker around three in the morning. Cas had woken up once or twice on the drive, but it was only for a few minutes here or there, and he never said anything. Mostly he looked out the window, or glanced at Dean in the rear view, looking away if the hunter happened to catch his eye.
Gary's face drained of colour. Sam wasn't done though. The bar stayed quiet and still, the little group had an audience now.
“But you don't, Sam. You have some idea of what I'm going through because of what happened to Jess. The thing is, she never betrayed you the way Cas betrayed me. Jess didn't pull you from Hell, or rebel against Heaven to help you. Before she died, she knew that you loved her.”
Cas stood up. For a few long moments neither of them were quite sure what to do, they both just stood there and stared awkwardly at each other. Castiel wanted to say something, but he wasn't sure what. He also didn't know what conclusion Dean had come to while he was gone, and he didn't want to make things worse than they already were. If Dean had decided that he never wanted to see Castiel again, the angel didn't want to make it harder for him by telling how much he loved him. Likewise, he did not want to jump the conclusion that Dean had decided to call time of death on their relationship, and say something that might make the hunter feel unwanted or rejected.
“Is it true that you were looking for a faith healer for me?” The anger in Dean's voice was cold and clear. There was also a certain amount of sadness that he tried to hide. The fact that he had pushed Sam to the point where he was desperate enough to ask strangers for help was a sobering one for the older brother.
Cas was silent for some time. He been wondering the same thing himself ever since he realized he'd walked into that lake practically dripping leviathans. He stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, not quite sure what to do with himself. He'd never felt so self conscience or awkward before.
Dean looked up at him then, eyes shining, and for a heart-stopping moment Castiel worried that he’d said the wrong thing, overstepped some boundary. But then Dean smiled. Small and hesitant, but there.
Dean doesn’t protest as he stands to gather the ingredients. “Fine,” he says, leaning over to plant a gentle kiss on Castiel’s lips. They’re both smiling so hard their lips don’t really connect, but those are the kisses Dean loves the most. “But you’re helping.”
“Yeah, I know you do. I have a few ideas about what I wanna do with you. I’m just not sure where to start.”
“Oh sure,” Charlie said. “If you’re asexual and you don’t want sex outside of your heats, then you aren’t gonna want sex
Dean looked back up and met Sam's worried eyes. He hadn't meant to let that much slip. He took a long pull from his flask, grimacing at the strong, bitter taste. He felt the booze burn it's way down his throat, wishing it would help. Dean finally found his voice again.
The grip on his hand tightens. Not painfully, just enough that he knows Cas is still holding him on purpose. He also knows he could pull away if he wanted to, and Castiel would let go. Dean doesn’t pull away.
“A woman, Amelia, found me and cared for me. A few weeks after I had been living with her, we discovered that I had... abilities, that I could heal people. Of course, I didn't know I was an angel at the time, and neither did she. To us these abilities were simply amazing. I started helping people, healing them. From what I understand, Sam was looking for faith healers and heard about me-”
, even though that’s exactly what it was. But Castiel didn’t have the same hang-ups on language. He said exactly what he meant, and in many ways Dean was grateful. Even when it made him blush.
Dean tried to calm himself down, and lowered his voice the next time he spoke. He didn't want to yell at Bobby, he just hadn't been able to help it.
Sam entered the store, a little bell above the door ringing as he did. He uninterestedly browsed through magazines and candy, waiting for the cashier to return. He intended to get fuel, then sneak around back and call Bobby, but before he could do any of that, the cashier returned. Eyes completely black.
Dean made his way deeper into the room, shutting the door behind him. He noticed another smell now, one he was sure couldn’t be there. His brain must be playing tricks on him, because there was no way, no reason, for Cas’s room to stink like sex.
“Look, um... you didn’t do anything wrong, okay?” Dean starts, hoping Castiel will listen and will believe him. “You asked permission for everything, you checked in, you stopped when you thought something was wrong... Cas, you did everything you’re supposed to. It’s not your fault I lied when I answered.”
“It's what he wants.” Sam tried to reason with his brother. Make him see why he needed to either put the gun down and let his brother, who could still rationalize, take control, or leave the situation entirely. “He wa- he wants you to shoot him, Dean.”
So, between his two jobs, and trying to be at home when dad and Sammy were both there, Dean didn't have much extra time. He felt like shit for doing this to Cas, even if the guy said he understood. He knew how much Sam meant to Dean, and said he knew family came first. Still, Dean loved the nerdy guy, and wanted to spend as much time with him as possible, but he also needed to work. This time had been a really rare occasion where both Bobby and Ellen had insisted he needed a break. Dean was pretty sure they were conspiring together, since they both knew each other, and Bobby was a regular at the bar. Bobby had told him he didn't need him for the next two days, even though Dean knew that was a lie, and when the Winchester had gone to the Roadhouse for some extra shifts, Ellen had pretty much told him to fuck off. When he'd asked if there was anything he could do, she told him he should take the next two days off. So, Dean had been ready to sit at home, bored out of him mind while at the same time walking on egg shells, waiting for John to stumble through the door, when he found out Sam was gonna be gone the next two days as well. Some friend of his was leaving for the weekend with his family, and they invited Sam to go with them.
Dean was really uncomfortable talking about this with Bobby. Sam was one thing, but Dean wasn't so sure Bobby would be as accepting. And he didn't know what he would do if Bobby wasn't okay with it. The guy was family, and the Winchesters didn't have much of that left. He would hate to lose any of it because of this.
“I told you I love you so much it scares me. I was terrified if you knew the truth, you’d pull away like she did. I couldn’t... I could watch that. Couldn’t watch you stop loving me.”
But he thought it would be different with Castiel. He wasn’t a civilian, he had no interest in a “normal” life. Hunting, protecting others, that was his life. And he was good at it. For the first time, Dean had someone other than Sam he could rely on. He didn’t have to be on guard all the time, Castiel could take some of the burden and let him rest.
Dean holds up his hand, stopping whatever Cas had been about to say. He can’t deal with whatever it was
Dean exhales as tension drains from his body. Besides Cas leaving, his next biggest fear had been Cas not understanding. Explaining why he’d chosen to lie for months was difficult for Dean, but he couldn’t imagine trying to understand it from the outside. Especially while dealing with everything else Castiel has been feeling through this last week.
Bobby was at his wits end. He'd called everyone he could think of and asked them to call around, even going as far as calling hunters he wasn't exactly on the best terms with, and practically begging for their help. After a couple of days, it seemed like he'd talked to every hunter, psychic and supplier in the country, and still, nothing. No one could help, and now he was panicking. He didn't know what would happen to the hunter if they didn't come up with something soon.
“Easy, alpha,” Sam said, still backing down the hall until he was at the next bedroom door. “I’m leaving.”
Dean sighs deeply as he wakes. He hasn’t slept so well in days, maybe longer. After his talk with Castiel last night, he’d wanted to stay awake for a while and soak in the feeling of being held for a little longer, but he hadn’t been able to keep his eyes open. Sleep came so quickly and deeply he is sure he didn’t move all night.
His hands never passed the beltline, but they dragged gentle paths up and down the former angel’s back, through his hair, along his stubbled jaw. Places Dean had
Beth grinned at him, she hadn't expected to see him back here. He looked noticeably better, well rested and content. The bags under his eyes had lessened, and his eyes themselves weren't dull and glassy. They had a shine to them, they looked more focused. More importantly he wasn't asking for hard booze at ten in the morning.
But this wasn’t about him right now. And as much as it tempted him to sneak a hand down between his legs, he wanted to focus on Dean more. So when Dean raised his hips, Castiel gratefully pulled his boxers off, grinning once he had Dean fully naked. It wasn’t a rare occurrence, but it was a treat every time. Especially now when he could see how wet and flushed Dean was.
“Cas, no, that’s not what- It’s not your responsibility to...” Dean sighs. “I’m a big boy, alright? I can handle a few bad dreams.”
Dean slowly reached out a trembling hand, as if to cup Castiel's face, but stopped short and pulled back. With a sudden burst of energy he hadn't had in weeks, he flung himself off the bed and back peddled away from the angel. This was all too much. It was all too much. The rush of different emotions Dean felt at finding out that Cas was alive was too intense. It made him feel unbalanced and overwhelmed. He felt heady and shaky, and only then did he vaguely notice how badly his hands were shaking.
He doesn’t look like he slept any better than Dean. There are dark circles under his eyes, his hair is messy like he’s been pulling on it, and he shuffles toward the coffee maker like a desperate man.
Dean knows he has to return the favour, but his numb fingers struggle with the button on Cas’s pants. When he finally gets it, Cas is insistently pulling on his t-shirt until Dean raises his arms and allows the shirt to be pulled off his body.
He hooked his thumbs into Cas’s pants and underwear, gently pushing them down until gravity took care of the rest.
"Me? Nothing. Your brother could not have taken on the mark if he wasn't worthy of it. All I did was give him the missing piece."
He pulled Dean under the spray with him, pulling him close until they were pressed together from chest to knee. Cas tucked his nose into Dean’s neck, right over his mating gland, and breathed in deeply.
“After that, when she tried to suggest we should do it again, I’d brush her off. Finally, she got fed up and asked if there was someone else. I tried to explain the sex thing, and she just laughed. Said all men want sex, so I must either be lying, or I wasn’t a real man.”
The man in the ball-cap continued to look over the symbols, adding a little paint to the ones the rain had worn out a little, but he directed more of his attention to the young hunter.
Castiel still didn’t look completely comfortable with the idea, but he also looked like he didn’t want to talk about it anymore. He nodded and said a quick thank you before ducking out of the room and heading for the showers.
Dean handed Cas the bag of food to root through, while he pulled the sheets out. They were cool to the touch and so soft, Dean was kind of excited about sleeping in them. He’d never had the chance before to appreciate how nice heat sheets were, but they were specifically designed to stay comfortable and clean. The next time he or Cas caught the flu, he was putting these bad boys on the bed.
Dean shakes his head, grimacing at the thought. Castiel sounds so disgusted with himself, and Dean doesn’t want that.
Dean gets up and grabs his underwear off the floor. He knows he’s stalling, but that doesn’t stop him from walking over to the dresser he and Cas share and pulling out some pajama pants and a worn shirt. He finds some sleep clothes for Cas too, and tosses them on the bed before pulling his own pants on.
Sam could tell his brother was about to cry, he could hear it in his voice, see it in his face. He didn't want to, but he decided to leave Dean alone for a bit, and go talk to Bobby.
“Sorry,” Dean says. “I saw some almond milk in there if you’re dead set on something not from a cow.”
“Got a little distracted there?” Dean asked as he made himself comfortable on his back. His tone was light, almost joking, but Cas could hear the vulnerability underneath the bravado. Dean still worried he wasn’t enough.
