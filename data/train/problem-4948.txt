It wasn’t long before it was over, before Cho looked up at the pale distraught omega as she held the bloody little bundle in her arms. The silent little bundle, the baby had never taken a breath and by the looks of the child - her faint blue skin, she favored her ‘mother’. Cho carried the tiny body away to try to revive the little girl.
Barnes laughed watching the display, “buddy, if your ma could see this.” The soldier chuckled and wiped his eye. “Ok, ok, time to go you little heathens. March!!”
"I'm not a child.. yes I can." He said begrudgingly, fighting the urge to snatch up the milk when it appeared on the table.  Bruce poured him a glass and pushed it on him. Loki was grateful though silent on that matter as he gulped the dairy down. What sweet ambrosia that was.
Running from the mirror and into the shower his hands shake trying to twists the knobs as hot as possible. He'd rather burn than stand there crying or worse...fall to his knees in a pathetic heap and vomit. “Stop stop stop...”Begging this oppressive feeling to pass, for the vice suddenly tightening around his chest to release.
Phil hummed, “You told him to leave didn’t you, cause you’re really one of the few if not only people who can tell Stark what to do and have him listen. At least a good percentage of the time.”
“Darling...” Loki folded his napkin, his brows knitting. “I think we both know by now it is not a matter of stopping, it is that the effort is fruitless.”
From that day on, Tony was no longer left with servants to care for him. It wasn’t always easy, yet the prince was determined to show everyone that he was more than a trickster and a liar. He was more than the fool who had fallen for Amora.
“I never said you…” Loki signed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “You need to realize your actions have consequences. When I was your age, I made many mistakes. Mistakes that have marked me for the rest of my life as a liar and a trickster. The Court will never respect me. I want better for you!”
When Steve arrived at the cabin, Bucky had Wendy on Duchess's back walking the little girl around the yard while she cheered happily. He would have smiled if he weren’t still so leery of the massive creature, though Steve knew Bucky would never let anything happen to Wendy. Still, this was a massive and potentially deadly creature from off world. Even if the beast recognized Bucky and Loki as its pack, accidents could happen. The unknown is a scary thing when you have kids.
Then again, it wasn’t just Widow that Tony blamed, he blamed himself to. So he made a choice, he was going to fix this, that’s what Tony Stark does right? He fixes, he repairs, and he builds.
Fine do it but make it quick one glance then back to all this stupid paperwork. You're getting to old for this.
“Alright, it's time for you to get your head out of your ass.” The soldier barked, hands on hips staring him down.
The world would be shown the tall muscular smiling young man that Steve Rogers had become thanks to the serum. All gleaming teeth and golden hair.  They would all marvel at the star spangled avenger as he aided the boys ‘Over There’ and brought a stop to a tyranny most foul.
“We are all younger than you in that respect and yet...” Charles paused looking at the omegas youthful face. “Yet I think your heart is still very young. You're learning not only about this world but yourself. Learning is always a good thing.”
“Sir, I feel that Stark's most recent enhancements are genuinely only a valuable asset. It was nice inviting the smartest guy in the country on our elite team but with this...I'm not quite certain he's not the cleverest guy on the planet. Barring common sense of course. Tony still hasn't mastered that one and is still for the most part a whiny man-child with too many toys. Honestly Sir, I think we're more protected with him than without.”
Steve nodded, settling back into the plush sofa. “I will agree, there’s nothing like a New York pizza. I just couldn’t get anything like this in D.C.”
Was this some retribution for the weapons of war his hands helped to construct? Some divine hand moving to punish him for his sins of Vice? There had to be an answer for this pain that coiled around his heart- squeezing out the very life burning in his breast.
“James....” His voice quivers as it raises in question. Eyes darting around the various machinery of the factory floor.
The alpha furrowed his brow and glared up at the digital clock on the wall. There was never time, there was always something else pressing. Loki wasn't some modest omega that when all dizzy at the thought of his/her alpha being away. It was probably nothing.
Meanwhile it appeared they had forced the beat into a shallow dock where Hulk was having a great time doing some smashing.
"Do not utter such blasphemy. I would alert Mother and have her watch over our child rather than risk Stark exposure." Loki's lip curled in distaste - clearly the feeling was mutual.
Stark had woken up after seven days in a coma. They still did not know the extent of the damage and there had been murmurs of 'brain damage' and 'possible spinal injury'. It wasn't good but at least he was alive.
The com in Steve’s ear began to crackle as the pair made there way out of the rocky ravine. “Cap, we got company! Seems Hydra heard you two love birds having a domestic!” Barton shouted.
Howard nodded and stooped to heft up a bag. “Supply and demand, I get it. I’m a business man darling, this isn’t my first rodeo at the negotiation table.”
“Light up your face with gladness. Hide every trace of sadness. Although a tear may be ever so near. That's the time you must keep on trying. Smile, what's the use of crying? You'll find that life is still worthwhile
Would the serum reverse completely? Or would he be some freakish Omega mutation, would the heat kill him?
There's a pause after she talks about Pepper preparing the nursery and Bruce assembling the furniture. “So, how are things with you and Loki?” The why Bucky and Loki haven't had any pups yet is lingering in the innocuous question. He knows she’s avoiding the subject out of respect. Somehow, that doesn't take away the sting.
“Captain Rogers could  be experiencing low blood sugar levels as I have no meal records for him today. My sensors also indicate higher than his average body temperature. He is showing  visual signs of mild dehydration. I am not however,  picking up any vital injuries or drastic decreases in his heart rate. Additionally, his respiration levels are slighting higher. I can‘t seem to access any other information as the sensors with in the Captain’s uniform have been damaged. ”
“I do not know Thor, go and tend to your King now remember.” Loki snapped though it lacked heat as the man was more occupied by holding up his frail looking son.
The man paused taking a folder from his coat…oh Christ what was this now. Photos of Tony with his pants off with some pop star -would not be the first time. This is why he did not like being handed things.  “My name is Emil Rockwell; I was a friend of your fathers a very long time ago.”
Barnes just laughed and kiss the back of his lovers neck. “Not a demon hun. You feelin a lil better? I can get you some crackers and soda if you want.”
He wanted to have some smart mouthed remark about Tony just wanting to get out of a meeting, but he was honestly too sore to make the effort. Allowing the alpha to offer a shoulder to lean against on the way back to bed. Once back in the comfort of memory foam Tony promptly sat at his side, rucking the tight sleep shirt up over his belly.
Steve had been suffering from the preparatory contractions for weeks now, at any time of the day or night the omega would quietly sneak off alone with a pinched look on his face. It took several instances before anyone even knew, mainly because a particularly inopportune false contraction made Steve wet himself in the middle of the night and he thought his water had broken.
Thor frowned as the baby cried weakly; he could since the brokenness of the child’s voice. “My father’s hair was dark in his youth that is how. Much as I suspect the father of this child. You are a cold creature indeed Amora, betraying my brother by trying to pass his child off as mine. Do you desire a crown so fiercely?”
He followed the sound of his father's voice to the kitchen. Steve was standing in front of the stove with a dish rag over one shoulder. The smell of burgers cooking and homefries in the oven. "Your dad will be home in an hour or three. ... Knowing him. Anyway, why don't you go get washed up for supper?"
The doctor’s face gave nothing away as she finished, tossing her gloves in the bin. “You can get dressed now Captain.”
“Damn it Steve! Would you climb down off your goddamned high horse for once?” Tony shot up out of his seat. “I told you I could not care less, yes I know that you were an omega before the serum. I get why they hid it because of how things were. This isn’t about that, it’s about you and keeping you safe!”
James smiled watching Loki read to their niece and nephew. The twins adored Loki and for so long the omega had shied away from interacting with them. It seemed since they applied with the adoption agencys that a peace had settled over them. He'd done a lot of thinking over what it means to finally be a father. Thinking of the relationship he never had with his own dad, the few and far between relationships he'd had with older men in his life.
Was this the legacy he would leave for his son? Cap’s history would make a far better narrative for Peter to live up to. Not Tony and his sorry sack of co-dependent alcoholic shit.
Finding it was more or less letting Tony finds them. Natasha explained that they would get a ‘ping back’ when Stark's sensors picked them up. Steve didn’t care how they did it.
There was no holding in this pain, he felt like he couldn't breathe. "No I...Why..How did it happen?"
Rogers couldn’t even apologize for that, Bucky was his friend and this was Hydra’s doing. Still, none of this could be easy for Tony.
James flexed his metal hand and looked out the window, distantly listening to Coulson briefing his team, the Agent may have kept his voice level but the intent dressing down was clear. Barnes would have liked to point out that sending such young field agents out on this particular op was a mistake- he knew the critique would be unwelcome. To his right, Natasha spoke in soft soothing tones on the phone with Pepper no doubt. He thought of the omega and Banner alone in the tower with all of the pups. Well not alone, the penthouse was still on lock down so it was as good as alone. James was quietly dreading the inevitable call to Stark he would have to make, while he would try to avoid it if at all possible – tonight was a prime example of how sometimes things just didn't go as planned.
The beasts from the depths crept from there dark holes and swam on their bellies on the cave floor. Their large clouded eyes unseeing yet fins quivering at the sudden spike of energy pulsing through the water. Seeking the throb of life like the fluttering heart of prey.
“What is it?” Something didn’t sit right in Tony’s stomach all of a sudden. It was that feeling you get before you hear something you don’t want to. Or heard the phone ring in the middle of the night. That weird tingling sensation that makes you feel like you are going to vomit for no reason. A premonition, a sixth sense, if Tony wasn’t a man of science he would have believed in all those things. For now though, it was just ‘hinky’.
For now though, with time to kill after their appoint meant and no villains in sight - Tony Stark had some filthy plans in mind.
"I love you. Every part of you" James would say. Only when they were alone in their bed. The quiet darkness wrapped around them like a blanket. That's when the soothing words meant most.
The mer guards at first did not know what to make of the interlopers, at first thinking them cohorts of the beast, then seeing the beings attacking the creature as well the word of the “land walkers“ among the sea traveled quickly and made it to the ear of the king.
“Ok, look it's going to be ok you can stay on the guest floor and...as much as it kills me to say this – I'll call Pepper to bring you some suppressant spray and...”
’, which included detailed notes on how exactly Coulson and his spy pals could harm Stark and get away with it. It seemed even Shield’s  ‘den mother’ was prepared to go all Tiger mom on Stark if he so much as coughed in the wrong direction were Steve was concerned.
There are moments spend out walking the highways and byways that the once man of science thinks - would I take it all back?
“I know, I know so cool your jets there Spangles. We do this, it’s me, you and the pups.” Tony took him by the hands with so much determination brewing in the alphas dark eyes that Steve had to suppress a shiver. “I would rather die bloody than anyone takes you or them away from me.”
The inventor’s arms flexed and nostrils flared, “No it won’t. But ya know what it will do? It will make sure that no one else feels like this.”
Steve wanted to resist the calming scent; he wasn’t a child who needed coddling. He couldn’t though; it was harder with Tony because maybe he wanted it. Even now, even knowing that he couldn’t have this he wanted it. “Thanks Tony.”
Steve raised his head looking adorably disoriented and flushed from arousal. If Tony was honest with himself, he derived way to much pleasure in seeing the usually calm and collected Captain so unraveled. “Yeah… yeah ok.”  The omega wet his lips and stretched out an uncoordinated hand, fumbling for the little vial on the bedside table.
Tony hummed in thought and pressed himself fully to the soldiers back. “I do like a grilled cheese. Anything I can help with, something not cooking related cause I think we both know not to let me near anything like that.”
Loki was angry, of course he was and it wasn’t without reason. He had fought for the last 20 years to keep this boy alive and healthy, despite all likeliness and circumstance. At first his son’s inquisitive nature was refreshing and even whimsical; however, the older Tony grew the worse he was at self-preservation. Discovery took precedent over safety many times and Loki was going mad. After all, this boy was the one and only thing in this world that he was honestly proud of. No matter whose child Tony might have been - he was Loki’s son and always would be.
“That’s a nice visual.” Banner comments pushing his lenses back up the bridge of his nose. “ Did they take any samples at the hospital, or at least any that you know of?”
“This fucking blows...” The billionaire wheezed, behind the face plate. His knee and hand were on fire and his chest felt like a ton of lead.
In the stillness that followed, James returned to his omegas side, looking into those clear green eyes and trying his best to heal the hurt still lingering there. “It's something doll, it's more than we had before. I want you to know I'm with you in this. It's me and you all the way no matter what we decide to do. I'm gonna see this through with you.”
“I believe Sir, you programmed me to protect you and by extension your offspring. That is what I am doing, so yes Et tu.”
Steve got up slowly, careful to smooth any wrinkles out his dress. Something about putting in on made him move carefully. Made him sit quietly, made him…want more. It was like flipping a switch in his head that brought him back to that little bed in Brooklyn. Back to that moment when Bucky could lift him up easily and surround him in every way. The dress made him feel small again, protected and loved.
Steve cringed a little; he knew this was difficult considering Thor was in Asgard and Sam was out with an injury. Therefore, as far as air support all they had was Tony. Coulson had some of his agents assisting in watercrafts while they tried to corral the creature into a docking area and perhaps force it on land.  Much to the agents chagrin, the creature seemed to know the team’s intention and was striking out with its many tentacles.
Nick Fury knew when he had underestimated an outcome; he also knew when to make the hard choices. This was something that had been instilled in him through the years. Sometimes what was right was not easy and what was needed was not right. There was always going to be a loser, always-collateral damage. You had to weight the few against the many, and sometimes realize that a deal with the devil might be your best bet. If he had to become that devil to get the scales to balance… so be it.
"The fuck is this...Hogwarts!"  Tony was a little put out about the last one because the bird did not like him.
Only now, that voice was darker and breathy from the life draining from it. “I didn’t do it for him.”
A faint acrid scent reading of pain and loneliness wafted up between them like a terrible ghost whispering all of his secrets.
The newly made Captain of four years ago- would show the pride in is gait and determination in the formal posture he held in uniform. Men would look up to him, standing there on the bow in his dress blues, blonde hair waving in the sea air. The golden strands bleached with sun and salt. If anyone asked him what his plans were he would still have a smile, he’d nod to his friends and maybe say, “I guess I’ll have to keep them out of trouble even when this is all over.” Natasha would roll her eyes and slip an arm around Bucky’s neck; the subtle action would make Steve look away and blush. Even then, he was still innocent.
Leaving Loki with Bruce was the hardest thing to do. Even so, he knew the beta was the best person to take care of Loki right now and there really wasn't more could he do. There was a lot more at play here than just an early heat. A horrible helplessness settled over his shoulders as James slid down the wall in the hallway and sat with head in hands. Natasha, as quiet as she was sat next to them. She didn‘t speak for a long time, just sat there with her grounding presence.
It was late one evening when she called his name. It just sounded different that time . She held his hand and told him how proud she was of him . Steve started to cry.
Also! there is a few non-cannon elements Phil is alive in this cause… TEAM AGENT! Tony still has the arc reactor cause…yeah I love it. This is set before Ultron (i guess... yall really don't chew on my leg over timeline)  I’m not sure if I will mention it or not, so feel free to think of this as a separate verse altogether if you like.( God bless the multiverse)  There may be some mention of characters from Agents of Shield, I’m still on the fence about it.
So why try? Why look for acceptance where there wasn't any? Why reach for salvation when all you were meant for was the fall?
“We call it an o-estrogen conflict, or Latent syndrome. It’s when the o-estrogen can’t reach an appropriate level during puberty resulting in either what would be considered a half-heat, or prolonged heat. Depending on if, the level was too high or too low. It can be caused by a lot of things, from stress, malnutrition, medication, it’s not that uncommon. However, with Steve’s other conditions at the time it resulted in hospitalization. His body had no idea how to resolve the situation.” Bruce then looked to Steve who had fallen quiet.  “I have a theory, what happened to you wasn’t illness per-say more chemical imbalance. The serum fixed all the other issues but as far as balance is consider it did the opposite.”
Banner swallowed around the lump in his throat, eyes trailing over the misted flesh that almost glittered in the midday sun.
James sighed and started looking for an exit, “Munchkin what did your Omega say about going before you left the tower?”
Two men appear on your late night screen, a pair of smiling gents...way too smiley gents in pastel button downs and dockers. You would change the channel but honestly, its 3 in the morning and you already know nothing else is on. So why the hell not right?
Bruce had to wonder what role Barnes played in all of this. Part of his mind kept traveling decades into the past, seeing his mother nurse a black eye or covering a bruise. He didn't want to believe something like that was the case here, he wanted to believe Natasha when she assured him how much James loved Loki. Yet Bruce couldn't suppress the shiver of 'what if she's wrong'.
Of course, now… now he could almost see it, scratch that, he could see it. Right there in black and white.
“Nice try Jim. Shock tactics? To bad, I already know I’m a piece of shit. Peter is taken care of, he will be better off trust me. Now, you have two choices, 1 - you turn that old bucket around and let me work.  Or 2 - I kill you.”
Once Steve was settled in, Tony ordered out and had a stack of pizzas on the common room table by the time Steve finished changing into something more suitable.
“Mr. Stark,” The older man stopped in front of him in greeting, he looked a little familiar maybe…just around the eyes. Then again Tony met a lot of people he could hardly remember. Those were usually much more attractive and in the long run naked people, who still did not find themselves as little more than a footnote in Starks mind.
Loki was usually so careful, so guarded about that sort of thing. Most of the staff here tried their best to do the same for the sake of not upsetting the children. Speaking of which, a pair of little alpha girls where looking up from their play and eyeing looking with concerned little faces.
Pepper and Phil steeped off the elevator together, braving a slight chill from the winds at this height. this was the highest point on the tower aside from the thin pole mounted with a blinking red light to alert low flying planes (Or iron man suits) of the buildings size. However, it wasn’t what it was when the tower had first been constructed. Which was a black patch of roofing tar and an access latter to aforementioned blinking light? Now it was lightly shielded by low walls of Lucite, to break up the wind, and a soft almost velvety feeling yet artificial grass. Solar panels disguised as onyx stones powered a small charging station. Tony wasn’t wild about the old tech but Bruce had said this would make it the one true bit of solitude. No Jarvis, no RT tech, just the sun and a little plug in for whatever someone might bring with them. Next to the little station where the landing cornered off was covered, not nearly large enough to stand or even sit. Perfect however to lay and be partial shielded from whatever elements one might encounter.
Wiping his mouth on the back of his forearm Steve tried to straighten up and just breathe. This would pass, it had to pass.
Steve felt his heart spike and Tony’s hand tightening on his. “What’s wrong?” The alpha asked before Steve could even get the words out.
Tony hummed feeling the Captains heavy erection pressed into his lower back. “Maybe, seems like my nefarious plots worked, should I salute the flag?”
“Tony…I can’t fail him again.. I ..I can’t fail..”  he couldn’t breath, his head was pounding and his chest was burning. Steve felt like he was drowning all over again.
Soft piano notes began as a woman's voice rang out softly. Loki smiled a bit sadly and began to sing along.
“If they fight with us then they are our brothers this day!” Thor bellowed, he had yet to see theses “strange land walkers with magic weapons” but he had had far bigger problems to deal with.
Part of him wondered if everyone was lying, that maybe Tony really was dead and they all worried that he wouldn't be able to handle it. Therefore, they had collectively decided it was better for now to say everything was ok, and then maybe try to break it to him gently. This in itself was a little insulting. It wasn't as if he was some delicate little omega that would crumble and die. Sure, the shock of it had brought him to his knees and even now, it hurt, but now it was a numb cold somewhat hurt. The kind that had once kept him up at night dreaming about icy cold water filling his nose and mouth. Even so, He had endured that and he could endure this. Steve could teach himself to endure it, for the kids, for the team.
"Go have fun with James sweetheart. No need to linger about here. I'll be fine." she'd say and shoo them off when Bucky had a few pennies for the picture show.
Later Phil gave a similar talk, which included visual aid. There really is something to be said about receiving an email PowerPoint titled
There was a sound of running down the hall and Natasha was the first one in the room followed by the nurses as Steve got up with a slight stagger before pulling himself to full height.
. Tony never had been a praying man but there was a small part of him that considered it these days. If there was anyone up there listening maybe they would be kind enough to guide him home.
Green eyes narrowed in confusion.. “Safe?...James...no, James deserves so much, he has tried so hard with me.”
“She is well, she misses you but Duchess has been of great company to her. Father has missed as well of course.”
Time past and Steven grew, he was smaller than most and often ill. In the night she would watch him struggle through fevers, his narrow chest rattling with every breath, she thought her wishes had crippled him. Sarah tried her best to keep him well and always taught the boy to hold his head high. Yet, she knew he deserved more, Steven needed a father.
It was bitter sweet sort of moment, the golden sun of evening filtering through the long row of window in the lounge. The way the amber glow warmed the room and made everything seem quiet and still. This was closing a chapter for both of them. It wasn’t forgetting the past but it did bring it to a gentle end. Things were not over, they were just different. Time had changed them both and life had taken them down different paths.
Natasha stood off to the side passively watching the short-lived reunion with Loki and his students. It gladdened her heart to see him smiling again.
Steve let out a breath looking down at his hands. It was a weight off his shoulders to know that those closest to him were still innocent in this. However, that did not change one startling fact. “I need to get out of here, you have to help me Phil. You have to know how wrong all of this is.”
His eyes scanned the diagnosis and a big grin spread under his mask. "Why would I be! We're gonna have a little spiderling! I love you petey pie.....and you are so hot to me right now. Think of all the hot sweaty..."
“Sure did gorgeous. You should’ a seen me, working my hole in the shower before I came over here. Thinking about the last time, I did it to you. Remember how you begged me honey, how sweet you were when I sucked those pretty tits of yours.” Tony looked back at him. “I can’t wait to play with them some more Stevie.”
Unfortunately Steve was set on teaching him about ‘the good old days’ which lead to them staying in this horrible little cabin with a washer that looked older than Tony that was  …of all places on the front porch.
“Stark knows what he’s doing, “Steve said slipping the helmet on and shield into the holster at his back. “We may not know what down here but I know we have what it takes to get this job done, I have never fought with a finer crew and we have had success in the past with far less of a technical advantage.”
A response! Short but it was something. “You know if there is anything you guys need from home Tony could send a car out or even Natasha or me. One of us could go and get it for you.” Bruce spoke gently as the kettle heated. He found a pair of mugs in the cupboard and a packet of tea biscuits. Bucky said he'd ordered some of Loki's favorites to try to coax the omega into eating.
James turned slightly before the doctor could intervene. “Doll I don't think that's what the Doc is sayin. Right Bruce?”
James has bought stuff at gas stations and a drug store. He knows snack food and witch microwaveable burgers are fittin' to eat. These are both extremely important things. Also, why do they need toothbrushes? They have perfectly fine ones at home, and he's pretty sure there are like 10 more in the bathroom closet with the 20 rolls of Toilet paper. Oh, look what’s next.....Toilet paper.
Tony took a moment to just watch Steve, the blonds shoulders fell and he stared down into his cup. He looked so tired, so completely done in and yet… something held him there. The inventor knew what that was like to spend sleepless nights going over the ’what if’s’ and ’could haves’. It was written all over Steve’s face that he was analyzing every action and result. He was sitting there trying to work through things to far-gone to change, and in Steve’s case that could mean events over half a century ago. No wonder he was worn so thin.
Pepper would try. " it's ok tones they just don't get you and so people take things the wrong way. " or " just ignore it, some people just say things. There just words."
Things had been looking up, Steve and Tony’s relationship seemed to be flourishing since Steve moved most of his things up to the penthouse.  A lot of the team thought Tony might not do well with someone in his personal space constantly; however, with SI, the Avengers, and Shield - they both had enough time apart that the more combative aspects of their personalities did not clash. They complimented each other in such a way that the team often joked, calling the pair an ‘old married couple’. For all the bickering they could do (and there had been some dozies) they were fiercely protective of one another.
“Nu-huh, my bear isn't real he’s just fluffs, and fluffs don't eat.” Peter said confidently nodding his little head.
Howard felt the need to look away out of modesty. Despite what anyone had said about his in his youth, being married had changed him. He loves one woman, and she was gone now.
Loki held her gaze defiantly, “I think it is, I think it's what you all want. The monster to get what’s coming to him, well here you have it. I do so hope it was worth the wait.”
Bruce nodded and gestured for Tony to follow as they moved Steve into the jet. “Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out.”
Following the steps higher, she notices a few of the small windows along the outer walls have been rubbed clean for observation of the surrounding property.
Steve frowned and started to get up, Tony pressed him back gently. “I'll take this sugar. Give yourself a bit longer ok? Then get a shower and something to eat. Ok?”
As I look back on this week, with the loss of Marvel creator Stan Lee, I look to these characters and what they have meant to my life. I can't say enough about how I have connected with this fandom and its vast universe of wonderful stories. All the lessons I have learned and the lives I have seen that in so many ways have mirrored the pain and isolation I have felt in different parts of my past and present. Marvel has been a way for so many people to find strength to move on from the hurts in their lives and onto something greater. We have read or watched characters who haven't always been 'good' or 'bad' find a way to be Better. Seen how friends, honor, integrity and kindness can shape the world and improve it. For that I can not say Thank you enough to all of the artists and creators who brought these tales to life. Mr. Lee, the fans will never forget you.
The glint of dark blue metal in the agents palm said it all. A lighter with Steve’s Shield on the front. It was slightly dented and he knew….
“Thank you Doctor Simmons, really.” He said as the alpha clean off the gel and set to printing out the image.
Steve moved back allowing the brunette to get on his knees and work the buckles and zips on his uniform. He could have cried at the relief when his cock sprang out of its confines.
Tony had managed to cobble together certain set of rules for when he returned form long business trips. The idea for doing this hadn't actually been his – he will renounce the origin of the rules if you ask, because they are nothing like Howard's Rules. Even so, there was a need for them as Pepper pointed out “If you don't take care of yourself then how can you take care of anyone else.”
“Doll, I hate to sound like a broken record but we gotta go if we want to make it through that traffic.”
There was something oddly healing about that moment, standing there on the penthouse balcony with his family. A little candle in a lantern sitting on the patio table between them.
Because then the omega would have to declare a national stare of emergency. Code, blue or red...fucking chartreuse who the hell knew what those colors were. Tony couldn't help but think that as a super hero he might actually want to know that. Mental note, learn the color coded danger scale – Steve probably knows it- Steve color coded all the twins clothes, hell...Tony's  sock drawer had been reorganized  a week after Steve moved into the penthouse. Then again, Steve knew weird stuff like that. Like the release date of military commemorative stamps, and where Wendy left her orange binky that she used to love and was forever losing in the penthouse.
Pepper had likely spoken to Tony and he was probably sending her to do his dirty work. On the other hand, maybe it wasn’t even was that, maybe Steve just wasn’t even worth a face-to-face rejection. Phil…well Phil was probably there to make sure Steve didn’t lose his temper and break something…like Tony.  Not that he would, no…the soldier had already made peace with what was about to happen.
There are a lot wonders and joys of pregnancy. There are also all the things that don't fit into a vogue photo shoot. Like the morning sickness, swollen ankles, mood swings, rosachea, and last but not least – really weird cravings.
Steve wasn’t a big talker, he said what he needed to say or what he felt should be said. That wasn’t always the case; he was pretty bad about writing a check with his mouth that his skinny ass couldn’t cash back in the day.  Right now, though if it was words Tony needed he would do his best to give them.
Fury hasn't said anything on the matter and the black leather clad man has a look on his usually impassive face that makes James wonder if he knows more than anyone in this room. It wouldn't be the first time.
The alpha knelt by the bed holding his omegas hand, “I’m right here baby doll, Bruce is on his way and he’ll check on you and our girl. I’ll be right here.”
Steve laughed, getting up with Wendy on his hip. “Alright, that’s enough of that give me my baby Stark .”
Things felt calm for a moment few as they began setting the table . Napkins folded and silver wear in place, bowls and highchair's for the little one. It was repetitive and Steve needed that sometimes. The order of domestic ritual calmed him down. Only this time it didn't last. That 'bad feeling' Steve had reference in the kitchen, bloomed into full blown panic.
That voice was Tony's, this is real, it has to be. It's real, this isn't like all those dreams when Steve swore his mother was there with Peter and Wendy and her once blonde beautiful hair was snowy white and she was the grandmother he knew she would have wanted to be. He was awake and Tony was there just behind him but....
“I woke up a few days ago, do you think the meeting had something to do with that?” Steve asked, although he already knew the answer. If Tony knew he would have come to get him.
For the first time what he could do wasn't looked down on, for once he was just as valuable and not for the wrong reasons. To have someone look at him and believe that he was good, the way that James and his Mother believed. This place had been a godsend in a time when Loki was sure he would fall into darkness alone in the cabin. Even so, Loki had learned through his long life that trust was costly.
“Well I wouldn’t have to if your kids would get off my bladder. I was on the sofa before I came in here.”  Steve said not even missing a beat before popping another chip in his mouth.
Waking up tied to a hospital bed isn't the best experience, then again neither is the look of sorrow and disappointment on his mothers face. The too bright shine in his father and brothers eyes. Even his aloof sister standing against the wall looking down on him with pity.
“The Triskelion HQ, nothing beyond that since SHIELD doesn‘t know about Fury.  Steve and Natasha have both been labeled as persons of interest. Tony; look I know Steve is your friend but why this sudden interest in checking up on him? I understand this situation is all shades of bad but this is Captain America were talking about here, I’ve never seen you put this much effort into anything that didn’t directly affect you.”
Jim smiled, that was the thing about the Ai - once Jarvis liked you, and he was willing to bend some code to help you help Tony. Even if the AI were master wouldn’t be too happy about it. Thinking over the offer, using Patriot seemed like asking for trouble. It didn’t take a genius to know who that armor was modeled after. “Feeling nostalgic tonight J, how soon can I suit up War Machine with Tony’s current location in the GPS?” He asked, hoping Tony hadn’t blocked his access to the gps. It had been a concession back when Iron man was still on the front lines, that War Machine would have full access to location incase Tony was captured or injured and unable to call for help.
To much silence too many things held in when they should have just been said. Now it felt broken and so did Steve.
All he could think about was being a 5-year-old boy who just wanted to see his dad and being cruelly ignored.
The heavy scent of the alpha doubled as the smaller man nearly growled in appreciation at the sight before him.
Tony wiped his eyes with rough hands, hands that worked just as hard as the father he barely knew. “I thought I’d never trust anyone, that I could never get past the disappointment in your eyes. I was so broken… but I’m not anymore. My alpha is so much better than you were to mom. Everything you said to me, all the conditions and unattainable goals that I had to surpass just to earn your love… I don’t have to do that with him. I made something of my self, people who matter are proud of me. He takes care of me because he loves me, just because no other reason.”  The words seemed to pour like the tears from the omegas dark eyes.
It wasn’t as if Steve didn’t understand the reasoning behind the decision. He understood it perfectly - he couldn’t be off flitting around the globe playing Fury’s errand boy when he had something more important to protect. Also… Shield missions were not really in Steve’s list of ‘favorite things to do’ anyway. So getting a vacation from Shield wasn’t the worse thing that could have happened to him.
Loki sighs and picks at the blanket bundled around his spindly frame. “My mother..enjoys the sunrise as well. When I was young she would wake me and carry me to the gardens and we would sit in a swing of a flowering tree. I remember how special it was because it was just she and I. When I grew too old for such things..it was a loss to me even if I never said so.”
Steve had to stop, eyes trickling tears as he looked up in the cold blue sky. A shaky exhale leaving his lips, "oh..why..why." He sniffled and looked back at the monument. "I am so sorry, I want you to know that never picked Bucky over you. That wasn't about that, I know I told you that but i was always so afraid that you didn't believe me. I loved you..no.. I do love you, I will always love you."
“You would be right, all the meet-ups Mallen takes care of himself. It was never the same guy and since you didn't give us the go ahead to..”
If you just smile”  Tony sang softly leaning his cheek against the top of  Steve’s hair.  He thought of his mother, how she used to put on that old Nat King Cole record and sing to him. It was bittersweet, though he’d like to think she would be proud of him now.
It was then when Steve could quietly reflect on the past few days. It had been wonderful, but there was one thing…
“DONT GO INTO THE LIGHT CAROL ANN!” Tony crowed over the coms. “Jarvis, old buddy old pal; can I get some sexy comeback tunes for Point break, Reindeer games and our buddy Buckster?”
Loki worked for days forging the gem until it shined a brilliant blue that rivaled Aroma’s own eyes. It glittered as if a star plucked from the sky and seemed to almost vibrate in his hands. It was perfectly round and the magic swirled and danced under the smooth nearly translucent surface.
Tony lied, he was a liar… he left Peter with Barton of all people…but maybe because Clint got it. Clint hadn’t said much during that little last supper intervention the rest of them had staged. The archer knew what it was like to lose someone you love. Clint knew what it was like to have to live with a ghost, and he didn’t say a word when Tony stopped by his apartment with Peter. He never tried to stop Tony when he left Clint just said. “I hope you know what you’re doing.” and that was all.
“Bribing my personal growth with a mocha latte?  Yeah that will work, ok… Steve, contrary to popular belief I would like to make sure Capsicle stays in one piece. Plus ya know old people get cranky with busted hips. ” Tony supplied spinning on his stool.
Inside they found a cache of weapons made for three of their crew along with diving masks the likes of which no one had ever seen.
Soft touched became therapy for all of them, kind words and knowing looks because their medicine. It became the thing that buoyed them on through the darkness. Through medications and physical therapy, through speech therapy and countless doctor visits over that next year and a half.
"It's.... it's about Steve." Pepper choked on the words before taking a breath, smoothing her sweaty palms down her skirt. "I got a call, Ms. Hill thought it would be best..."
Tony was changing and now sending his son away from the tower. Someone had to do something and as usual, Pepper Hogan was there to try to talk her friend and employer out of things once again.
Rockwell nodded thoughtfully, “Moreover, what if I told you that you were wrong, what if I told you that the story of America’s super solider was all built on a lie? A lie that could very well destroy him in a way the good Captain may never recover from.”
Loki smiled, a year or so ago that would have worked. Peter would have sternly glared and watched his bear for any sign of thievery. Children grew so fast and became so bright, looking at the little boys twinkling brown eyes Loki knew this little boy would grow up to be just as smart if not more so than his alpha. However, it wasn't necessarily pride that Loki felt. More than anything, looking at the pup just hurt.  Peter was such a sweet child, such a gift to have him here but at the same time, he reminded Loki of all the things he could never have. Never would here be a bright little face sitting on these counters everyday asking to help make breakfast for their father. “What a bright boy you are.” he said, voice breaking with out his permission.
Intimacy between them wasn’t at all what Steve had been taught as a child. Tony never ‘expected’ him to submit, to be honest the Alpha was versatile in the bedroom, which led to many new experiences for his omega. Steve had never been ‘usual’ and it was refreshing to know his Alpha didn’t expect him to be either.
“I do not sense any structural issues Sir. I am not entirely sure how this is taking place. Atmospherically readings indicate a defined area between the main walls and what can only be describes as an energy membrane. With in the membrane the temperature, pressure, humidity, and over all gravity readings is like nothing on this planet.” The aI seemed just as perplexed with this.
“I promise babe I’ll be back before you know it!” He shouted running out to the formation pad on the balcony, the suit already forming around him.
Steve didn’t say anything; he just reached out and took his Alphas hand. He held that work weathered hand for a short time before looking up at the inventor. “You do something like that again; I will knock your teeth out with my shield and not even feel a little bit sorry. You got that?”
Fluff and more fluff. I...suffered from sweetness overload this chapter.  It's a little padding for next chapter
“Gotta fight fire with fire right Buck, you know I'm right. We can't stop him- not like this. Your arm is grinding and squealing louder than the breaks on a college kids used Toyota. The suit is done and do you really think that Agent and his band of merry men are really going to stand a chance against Tall Dark and murdery over there?”
The suits sensors began to flash, indicating an incoming flight signature, It was the quinjet, and Tony scowled at the reading and looked to the skies. They must have used cloaking to get this close; thankfully, hydra tech wasn’t as good as his was.
James felt his omega relax and Loki's breath even out. It wasn't much but it was an improvement. He tried to be careful of the IV Bruce had put in on the back of Loki's hand. Gently arranging his sleeping love beside him, trying his best to keep him comfortable. The days ahead were going to be hard, this was one of those things that had to get worse before it got better. He wanted to believe Loki was strong enough, that he was too but then...he looked down at how far his lover had declined right under his nose. Loki must have been wearing glamours 24hrs a day for him not to have noticed this.
That was enough, the sound of Steve breaking under his ministrations. That’s what Tony was looking for. He extended his tongue and began to encircle Steve’s length. Slithering his tongue down the underside of the shaft and worked his way back up to the head.  Tony looked up flattening his tongue and slowly bathing the hot flesh.
Seeing his omega standing there with his eyes wild, blood and oil on his hands and face, eyes half red and skin fading from blue to white. There was something too wild and unhinged about him. James isn't sure what to do with that and he can't stand himself for now hiding it better. The way Loki seemed when he left...so … broken.
When Steve opened his eyes he was on his knees in a little room off the master bedroom, he was shaking and muttering things that made no sense. None of this made any sense. Steve had given up 70 years of his life to end Schmitts plans, good men died in that war, Bucky had become…a monster.  A monster that killed so many people. What was it all for if hydra had come back and even regained there most powerful leader?
Gathering the broken soldier in his arms Tony retracted his right gauntlet and ran his fingers back through Steve’s blood matted hair. “Please Steve, I can’t be to late… I can’t lose the best thing in my life. I know I’m a jerk and inconsiderate, immature and a sloppy drunk but … I had you. Please..”  He pulled Rogers up into his arms trying to be as careful as possible as he made his way out of the compound.
Tony wasted no time in claiming his lips, speaking soft words and gently touching every inch that wasn’t covered in bandages. “I was looking.. The whole time Steve, I want you to know that. I would have never stopped, I will never stop.
“Steve?” Before Tony could say anymore the Captain turned on his heels and was storming past him looking paler than usual. “J call Bruce we might have a situation.” He followed at a jog still keeping some distance between him self and the unstable omega. “Steve just sit down.”
Steve looked up and wasn’t that a sight for sore eyes, he looked a little older around the eyes - tired and worn. Considering they all thought he was dead for the last seven months, not bad.
Her own words came back to haunt her, all the while watching the while lines fade into the tree shrouded horizon. All the things she did, the people she killed...and the forgiveness she found.
"I don't think it's misguided." Bruce started as he took a few tentative steps closer. "I think he merely wants to be sure you'll be okay. And...well, none of us want you to suffer..."
However, things did not seem to be going as planed. It had been a couple of months since his heat, and Steve was starting to wonder if he was going to have another soon. He shouldn’t, he knew that because most omegas only have two a year maybe three when they first start. Nonetheless, with his hormones in god knows what kind of state he wasn’t sure. The idea of something being wrong again made him nerves. What if he could never be normal? What if it would affect his ability to bond?
Riding up to his floor Bruce could hear Loki's voice piping through the elevator speakers. "Stop...stop singing...." Banner silently prayed but it wasn't stopping. If anything Loki was just getting more into it by the chorus. "This is a nightmare....he will kill everyone...I might let him. No I can't do that thats wrong, maybe just Tony. We need Tony, he pays for things...Pepper pays for things so maybe....No,no can't kill Tony. I'll tell Steve. Steve will guilt him to death."
James had been astounded to find Natasha in his home, upon his return from the grocery store, the red haired alpha had simply smiled and gestured to box of baked good on the coffee table. The excuse of a goodwill mission bearing sweets didn't really seem her style, then again, James wouldn't put it past Bruce or Pepper to have been the driving for that sort of thing. He tried not to read too much into, they both seemed to be whole. No blood on the floor so that was a bonus, after all Loki was a wild card when it came to his moods.
Maybe it was the alcohol; the lack of sleep, or maybe it was just that Tony could not do this alone. He grabbed his son by the shoulders and shook him. “Well we can’t have what we want! He’s gone and he’s never coming back!”
Tony knew seconds before the heavy tentacle slammed into the armors chest piece that this had been a mistake. He was counting on the monster to be preoccupied with the shield agents. Mild miscalculation, how was he suppose to know that genetically spliced abominable …what was it Bruce said? Squid/…axo… axe…ak… Aka-cues me? Some weird salamander fish thing from Mexico that Tony could not pronounce. Either way he did not think it would be so perceptive.
Stark wasn’t a religious man, or even superstitious, yet he wanted to believe that Steve was by his side. That for a moment it was like old times when Tony dawned his red and gold armor. When they fought side by side.
Stark wasn't buying it, he'd been keeping tabs on Loki and realized when the other man hadn't left the ratty little apartment building in over three weeks there was no way things where as shiny and clean as Loki was presenting them to be. Something was very wrong.
It was believable, then again it should be. To the untrained eye…it would be, to someone who had not been around this kind of tech for years it would be perfect. They wouldn’t have noticed the way the faint rays of light filtering through the broken windows seamed to shimmer. Projected camo technology, it was good - maybe even the best. However, even the best had its limits, the energy field energized to employ the cloaking over the area wasn‘t with out its flaws.
Phil tugged over a chair and sat down, taking a moment to straight up his tie and cross his legs, “It did happen though and you’re both adults. Listen, I know I’ve never been in this situation but I do have children. Clint’s became mine the moment I bonded with him, and I’ll admit I was scared to death. I had no idea how to be a parent, to be honest I was surprised Clint was so good at it. It’s a hard job but it’s also one of the most rewarding.”
There something, some kind of pull like magnetic north that attached to his spine and tugged. Some...unseen hand resting over his and the smell of electricity in the air. They had come this far. Too far to turn back. There was something out there...no down..down under all that churning water and Steve couldn't say no.
“Bruce will you give us a moment please.” Steve said from behind the two, now lying on his side to alleviate some of the pressure on his back.
Maybe Jarvis could tell how serious Tony was or maybe he’d just grown concerned with the way Steve was pacing and inevitably ended up standing motionless in front of the nesting room. The poor omega looking like he craved the comfort of the space but too stubborn to give into the instinct.
Tony didn’t say anything, he was bad at extremely emotional conversation. Truth be told he was still working out how that conversation was going to go in his head. He thought maybe just handing over his father’s journal to Steve and then hanging around for the question and answer segment. That would be the less painfully feely route. Then again, something else went along with all this. The fact that they might not be able to keep this a secrete for much longer.
So when Tony headed up to the common room he wasn’t suppressed to see a familiar ginger exiting the Kitchen with a cup of something sweet and steaming. Hot coco, knowing Pepper - she had a habit of assuming anything chocolate was a remedy for everything under the sun.
" living is pain and pain is motivation and motivation is success ." had say to himself eyeing a row of angry blisters. He just had to try harder.
“Picking up some paperwork from the compound. I know James has the day off so I figured I'd take one for the team rather than have Fury call him. Where is he by the way?” Not that she didn't know. Natasha had looked up the GPS on Barnes phone before coming; she knew exactly where he was.
“Now you have to flex your Alpha prowess over me because God knows the silly little omega can’t do it right? News flash Shell head! I‘m not an omega anymore... I‘m not anything!”  The soldier started pulling out the IV’s and monitors sending the machines in the room into fits.
“You won’t, your friend Tony. I know you are still in there somewhere.” Jim got to his feet and walked slowly toward his friend, it was a foolish thing to go but it didn’t matter. Reaching out he took the armored hand lowered it. “ That’s it, lets just calm down and talk ok?”
“Could she control someone if they were like that... likes a hive mind of something?” Simmons interjected over the line
“Captain, Captain Rogers.”  Jarvis sounded through the penthouse like an echo.  Steve wasn’t paying attention though, all he saw was the cold darkness that lay in the billionaire’s eyes.
“What heat is sanitary? Come on cupcake, and look at this way maybe we can beat the enemy by using your intimidating crotch bulge. Cause I gatta say…. I’m feelin nervous and I like it.”  The visor snapped shut and he was gone.
James hit the chain motor and carefully drew the sub up. “Yeah well..wait . guest? Where the hell is that punk!”
Steve looked up in those big brown eyes that held nothing but warmth. Tony was there, holding him by the shoulders then touching his face. The room was sloped, dark and warm; the only light was calming blue from the rector.  “Right here with me now hon, come on.” Tony’s voice cut through the ice.
“We have to help them.” snapping his oxygen helmet in place. Only seeing the terror and pain of the beings outside the sub. Everything in his brain compared these creatures to the ash and blood covered villagers in the war torn countryside’s from the war.
“There is, and he or she can’t wait to meet their big brother.” Steve said placing his own larger hands over his sons.
Loki drifted into view, an eel named Jormungand - slithered around the ravenette tail. The creature sparking with neon light every now and then. “What is it your oaf… what is that…” Loki stared at the sight of a bundled child in his brother’s arms. The little one dwarfed even more so by the blondes’ size.
Perhaps that was being dramatic, but for Loki it felt as true as the blue world around him. He had loved Amora, he would have given her anything, and he had given her everything. Every little piece of him until there was nothing left.
"Tony can you hear me say something?" Pepper was holding his face and he vaguely registered the feel of the cold lab floor under his palms where he sat.
“Babe I promise you, that I  would tell someone. I know this ...this stuff with Extremis is hard but – I would never. Ever. Leave you and the kids. You are my world do you understand that?”
Watching as his omega slid soundlessly back into bed, turning to face the wall. That was a little different, Loki usually was a back sleeper or more often a *this whole bed is my kingdom and your body only resides here at my pleasure. NOW warm my icy feet or become my pillow...the choice is yours* sleeper. Not that he had any problems with that, he loved waking up with arms full of soft sleepy sorcerer.
The two of them sat and talked, Tony bringing out a tablet to show Steve some new designs for various upgrades to the teams equipment. Tony had found Steve to be fairly knowledgeable when it came to design, he had that artist eye for lines and form. Were Tony had a mind for function. The engineer had to admit he’d come up with a lot just bouncing ideas off the omega.
Tony finally decided to sit taking the offered cup, it didn’t take him long to succumb to the call of a jelly filled pastry. “How is the birdbrain?” he said around a mouthful of doughnut.
Stark managed to maneuver both of them under the duvet and himself on top of the soldier, giving into the urge to return Steve's earlier scenting. Yes, omegas did purr and Steve sounded wonderful when he did.
He wears the sorrow like a fine garment, the hallow of his cheeks and dull black of his untamed curling hair could seem almost beautiful in an ethereal waif sort of way. Yet his eyes are lost, green glassy things that gaze out over the horizon or somewhere just beyond as if searching. Searching for something that will never come.
“Stay. Just stay. Tell me I am unbroken, that I am not the monster I know I am beneath this skin. Lie to me Thor...lie to me.”
Howard wasn’t crazy, he was devastated. He had a right to be, and as his friend, she had to be there to help pick up the pieces of the inventor before someone else came along and rearranged them into something dark and bitter.
Tony had enough of waiting for the fight to come to him; enough of megalomaniac would be super villains. He wanted to take the war to the source and obliterate it before anyone else had to die.
Lifting his head the soldier smiled, his vision graying at the edges and blood pooled around his feet. “Tony?”
She laughed pulling herself up onto her palms, the peppering of scaled over her belly and forearms shone in the moonlight. Her bare chest only covered with long tendrils of wet golden hair.
He gave his P.A a salute to which she rolled her eyes - swatting at him with the dishrag as the inventor passed.
The two to them dissolved into a fit of laughter curling up around each other in the tangled sheets. Little-by-little Tony’s hands found their way back down to the small bump, both men went quiet, just laying close soaking up the morning sun filtering through the windows. This was the first time they had done this- just stayed in bed for hours enjoying each other. It felt like it should be some kind of milestone in their relationship. Considering how busy life could be moments like these were so fleeting.
This story has 69 bookmarks!...*giggle snort* ...69..  I'm sorry y'all. Your writer is immature as fuck.
“I’m surprised he hasn’t had one of those too…” Bruce muttered and then realized what he said and laughed sheepishly. “I um…I mean that’s unfortunate. You two enjoy that…yep”
“Nien, I think I see well enough. There is something troubling you, these past few months it has weighted you down more and more. You might be good at hiding things Loki but even a master of deception has his limits. If you hold whatever this is in for so long it will destroy you.”
“We gonna get to see Unca Bucky and Unca Loki?” Peter asked as his papa helped him into his outfit. He was a big boy but still buttons were hard. So it was okay to have papa's help. Papa always told them that asking for help was important because no one is perfect and you can learn a lot by asking. Even though Daddy never asks for help and Papa, gets cross with him. Papa says that’s just Alphas.
“Thor...” Jane hesitated clasping his hand and directing her alpha over to the sofa. “Thor you can't just expect Loki to run home with every problem. Think about how he's been treated there. Well... everywhere actually... The point is; you know how independent your brother is.”
“Or something..”  Bruce tossed the journal onto his desk, “ I’ll need blood samples, hair, urine, and oral swabs to start. Then a physical exam and a secretion sample from his bonding gland. I figure I can refer to some underdevelopment diseases for omega and compare the levels. Then look into nature suppression research, something that might be comparable to the serums affects on his nature and go from there. Would be great if I had more than just Howard‘s word and some obviously questionable files from 70 years ago to get an idea of Steve‘s medical history.”
“Can’t help it..” the cause of Steve’s torment commented from between the omegas’ splayed thighs. “God you’re so responsive… I love it.” Tony muttered before returning to laving his tongue up Steve’s straining cock. Pausing only momentarily before wrapping his lips around the flushed crown of his prize.
Tony bit his lip as the mental image clouded his hind brain of the blond on his knees. “You minx...I love it.”
“I think it is a nice gesture Sir, historically white was an appropriate color for a courting bouquet. Would you like that in roses?”
Peggy wished it was that easy, wished there was some magic left in the world. The same magic that Howard claimed took his son, so that she could find that scaled witch and rip the very heart out of her. She wished there were angels and fairies, wished there were a million things she could not see and stopped believing in as a child and that even one of them could turn back time.
Loki moved along silently behind the group of inquisitive teens. From the moment the group had entered SHEILD he had felt eyes on him. There was a time that he would have taken this as a direct challenge and behaved as obnoxious as possible and try to prove how superior he was. That felt like a life time ago, days when he had been a foolish child and an angry young man who felt the need to prove himself without even a hint of provocation.
“Shhh… its ok champ, you’re ok.” The father said offering a finger to the infant to clutch in his tiny fist. The grip was strong despite the baby’s weak constitution. “You’re a fighter right Anthony, just like your mama. We’re gonna get you better and when we come home me, you, Jarvis and aunt’s Peggy and Angie- we’re gonna have a party for you just like your mother wanted to. You’re gonna grow up and one day you’re gonna be so smart.” Howard felt the lump in his throat as he spoke. Hoping against the odds that Tony would grow up, because he couldn’t lose someone else.
Tony did his best to shake off the hit. “Barnes? Where's he aAAAHH!” His words cut in half by a scream as searing pain tore through his right knee.
Tony wanted to point out that Steve lived in the city and how could he know anything about living like this. The blond just waved him off and said enjoy the fresh air, Tony pointed out that the air in the tower was filtered 100 times over and likely way fresher and smelled less like pine and wet animal.

Barnes doesn't have a comeback for that. Instead, he just sits down and picks up the little blade on the floor. “That why this is here? You thinking about checkin out Stark. Cause after what I saw in that warehouse I don't think this is going to do it.”
Pepper slipped away with an offer to listen when Steve was ready.  Her gentle voice whispering a goodnight before disappearing into the elevator.
“Friend Steven! Hiemdall spoke of your return and my brother and I rushed to the aid of our Shield brothers!”
Sitting alone on their bed, theirs...the word seems so peculiar now. Like this space isn't big enough for him anymore. Steve had worked so hard to put away that uncomfortable feeling of being too large for his skin. In this moment, he felt thrust right back to that scared kid who was suddenly walking around in a six foot frame he didn't know what to do with. Banging his shoulders on door frames and bumping his head in cars.
If only that were true. Maybe for some people it is. Some who do not constantly measure themselves by the worth given to them by others.
Steve had been puttering around the penthouse for two whole days, cleaning and acquiring everything in order for when his alpha came home. As for his alpha, Tony was currently out-of-town for Stark Industry business. Normally, Pepper would go to these sorts of things but since she was on maternity leave Tony had been force to step out in the name of his company.
Tony pinched his lips tight to swallow down the laughter threaten to claw its way to the top. “Look up the definition of upgrade Spangles. In Fact, J care to help me out here?”
So he pushed away, he did what he did best and put on a liars smile when he heard the things that broke him. When everyone reminded him that it was his own fault for how others looked at him. When his own brother left him.  He pretended to not care and locked himself away.
Without James, or their niece and nephew running around; Loki felt the silence bone deep. Even Duchess's soft snoring from the front porch did little to sooth the crawling under his skin.
Right ok, so far all he knew was this thing was out there – possible not usable but possibly in a stage where it could be. Great, that's great because this is totally what he had hoped to come home to. “You did the right thing Maya; just keep your eyes open and your head down. I'll get my guys looking into this.”
"I have made several shows of gifts with, less that positive results. I felt perhaps a mortal woman such as yourself may have a better insight." His morning gift of a beautiful white stallion had been accepted but as the Tower had no stables the animal had to be sent to the avengers training facility upstate. Though...she had accepted it.  "I have made some progress, however i had hoped to speed along the process."
Peter didn't seem to believe this and when his Uncle stepped back in reach he latched onto the man hugging him tightly, “Please don't be sad okay?”
Through some research with aid of the Towers AI, the couple began education themselves about the adoption process. As it turned out, adopting mutant children is simpler. Sad but true, most families did not want to bring a child with the X-gene into their home unless one or more members of said family was also a Mutant. In some cases it stood to reason when Loki considered that the abilities of some children – like those whom had been surrendered by their parents to the X-institute, demonstrated dangerous abilities. This was no fault of the child. It was simply that not everyone had the resources to care for them. This also stood true for non-mutant children with special needs.
“That makes perfect sense considering the harsh conditions of their world.” Hank pointed out. “The pack presence, omega interaction, not to mention adequate sources of food and water. Why produce a new generation into a harsh world where they would be unable to thrive?”
“Right, you're absolutely right.” Her tone spoke of regret so great it crushed the very life inside. “Extremis is fitted into a few billion graphite nanotubes and suspended in a carrier fluid. It was suppose to be the ultimate answer. It all seemed so damn elegant Tony, a one shot step to perfection just like the original super-soldier serum. Only...”
The first three hours were ok, the contractions were still far apart and his water hadn’t broken yet.
( Alternatively, breakfast, Lunch, whatever time he managed to stumble out of the workshop. This is a tradition and simply cannot be broken. Nothing says welcome home like a Beef patties, lettuces, tomato and cheese. Bacon if you're fancy.)
His first thought when seeing Stark, had been of the white knight in Alice in wonderland, or perhaps an avenging angel. Something sleek and perfect, almost too perfect with it's gleaming lines and light. There was something Barnes couldn't quite put his finger on, a subtle wrongness. Maybe it was in the other man's stance as bright rivers of turquoise danced around the opalescent plating. An air of arrogance that the media often portrayed the genius Alpha to have, an arrogance that all of the Avengers would tell you was stage Bravado at best and over confidence at worst.
Tony smirked looking up from his work bench." Hit me J" A screen lit up with an image that made Tony grin like a maniac.  "J, home share please, and record."
Green eyes began to clear, and Loki pulled away from the comforting touch. A mild defensive mannerism followed: Folding his arms and pressing himself as far back as the chair would allow. “Agent...”
Tony faltered and tried looking to Steve and Bruce for help, the former stifled a laugh while the later waved off. “That's all you Tones.”
AN: Some Strong Superior Iron man feels here. Don’t worry though, this will carry for a few chapters possibly. BTW thank you all for your continued support. As an unrelated note, I have started posting new Gamma Frost and Stony as well as a Harry Potter one-shot work, so please check those out if you are interested.
“Damn right I did!” Tony clapped his hands and looked around, “alright, so send up some food I’m thinking continental breakfast, have it left in the hall and let me know when it gets here.”
“Perhaps a bit of decadence.” he mused eyeing the expensive bath products. The towers bathroom was every bit the vision of luxury. Marble floors, large modern bath, a shower monstrous enough for several people and multiple sprays above. Loki selected a large emerald green ball covered in gold glitter. James had mocked him gently about the bath bombs Stark had left in a welcome basket.
“I'm sorry Mr. Stark. Your wife did not survive." the midwife said, standing just outside of the door where Maria Stark took her last breath.
Now the archer was home and thinking about his top five favorite things, Food, shower, sex, and TV. Whatever order that happened in was fine, or combination.  The alpha dropped his gear in the entryway and looked around for his omega.
“It’s a long shot but sure, I’ll also need Steve to tell me anything he remembers about his medical history.  As an alternative, if  it turns out we cannot find his specifically - I could possibly try to locate a similar case. If we know more about Pre-serum Steve, I can maybe get a better picture of some of Howard’s theories on the serum and its effects.” The doctor replied before turning his attention again to his troublesome billionaire friend. “ You know this won’t be easy right?”
“Don’t use Star Wars puns against me J.” Tony sassed right back. “Seriously though babe…snacks on the throne? I’ll admit there were some times in college when I had the drunken shits and ended up having ramen in the bathroom but that was out of multitasking necessity.”
What’s to say Steve even wanted this? Why would he? The guy lived for the mission. Steve wasn’t Steve if he couldn’t get out their and make a difference. Now, Tony had stolen that from him.
It didn't take long for Barnes to catch what he was asking, as understanding flitted across the mans face there was a brief flair of anger and then sorrow. “That what you think of me?”
His mother perfume was all gone now, replaced with the faint odor of axel grease and Hugo Boss cologne.  He smiled where Steve unconsciously pulled the faded orange fabric under his chin.
Weight settles on the other side of the bed and he knows it's Tony, he can feel the warmth of him from here but he can't feel anything. Used to, every time Tony was near him it was like wrapping up in a blanket from the dryer, this soft warm that settled over him and made him feel at home. Now it's just this cold open space between them and it's torturing.
Steve shook his head maneuvering his feet over the side of the bed.  “Yeah, that’s… not happening.”  He said reaching out to steady himself with the IV pole only to find a wall of muscle in front of him offering an arm.
“We’re gonna get in trouble Tony!” Bruce whined. The little boy watched as his friend shooed him away. Tony was always doing things like this and somehow Bruce was the one who always was dragged along.
Steve looked up from where he had paused mid stride. “Yes sorry.” He felt foolish for getting lost in the past like that; it seemed he’d been doing that a lot lately.
As Rogers looked to the face standing there in the entry he had to blink to be sure. This was getting stranger by the moment. “Phil?”
Howard would smile tugging a pencil from his ear and jot down a few notes or whatever ideas had been running through that big brain of his. He had even slipped the journal out of the sleeping man’s arms one night and sketched something among the pages. Steve wondered if it was still there.
Then there was Tony and Steve, in a way New York is what brought them together but there was so much about that day that had rocked them to their core. Tony had anxiety attacks and Steve struggled to stay strong for his new alpha and budding family. That all started with Loki. Could anyone blame them for feeling harshly toward him?
“Then get the hell out of my tower!” Tony shouted, vengeful began to form around him and Bruce took a step back.
The actual revel hadn’t been that much better though, everyone could tell something was wrong with Steve and Tony just kept eating, drinking and pretending to text when he was really just playing fruit ninja.
The ravenette wrapped his arms around his belly; the cramps had started in his back and shot through him like a bullet. If felt like the same torturous pain that came with an unaided heat. “Ah… I do not know… James… James.” Loki had never been one to truly show his fear but now…now he felt that fear so acutely that there was no way to mask the tremble in his voice.
“Look at my poor baby.” Stark purrs in a filthy whisper. All the while running his hands up his lover’s thighs and grabbing the waistband of the clingy uniform. The material fell and pooled around Steve’s ankles, if anyone happened to open the door now there would be no way to hide.  Tony smirked up his solider knowing when that realization occurred to the blond. “Don’t worry baby, I’ll take real good care of you”
Bass drums throbbed like a heart beat as Tony sat in the center of an old beat-up sofa he had in the workshop. It wasn’t a song on his usual playlist it just played because he thought of it. A single line cropping up in his head as he stared down at the pen knife laying motionless on the floor and there it was. He could do that sort of thing now, Jarvis wasn’t even in the shop any longer.
“I’m a little disappointed that it’s this easy.” Steve had to be honest, he was a super solider and aside from thick walls and doors, they were not exactly proactive in their handling of him as a prisoner.
Still, lying there alone in that double bed all he could think about was the manic brunette and the way the light in Stark’s captivating brown eyes had dimmed over just a few short days. How Tony seemed to shrink right before him under the accusing glares and harsh words thrown around him. Steve wanted to protect him even when those warring parts of him mind said that Tony needed to take his own medicine on this one.
“That’s it…oh sweet oh it’s ok. It’s all ok now.” Howard lifted the wailing child against his chest. Tony was wailing loud and healthy before snuffling into the soft fabric of his father’s shirt. The inventor just stood there holding his child with tears in his eyes. Anthony was going to be fine, he’d done it…they found a way.
“Their …I never thought I’d have this.” Steve didn’t want to cry, he spent the last nine-months crying more often than he had in his entire life. Still he couldn’t help the tears breaching his eyes, “Thank you, I know this hasn’t been easy and sometimes I’m hard headed but…”
Tony Stark wasn't exactly easy to love, because he didn't even love himself. He didn't think he deserved love. Let alone did he deserve James Barnes to look at him like that with those big bright eyes and easy smile. No, Tony didn't deserve any of that from a man like James Buchanan Barnes.
The omega looked down at the little plastic test in his hands, they shouldn't have done this, should have let better sense prevail. They hadn't though. Peter thought there would be no way his fathers could stop them if he and Wade bonded.
Anger and irritation dissolving like sand in the wind, Loki turned away, now he felt nothing but sadness. “I think perhaps you try too hard to see the good in others. It blinds you to their obvious defect.”
“It’s not…” Tony flinched and placed a hand over the center of his chest. Despite the burning that felt as though it was cracking his rips the metal felt ice cold. “Dad…something’s…. I don‘t feel right.”
“Bucky used to love this. It was a real treat to get fresh fruit in the tenements. Mostly it was just canned every now and then. My Ma would pitch in a few pennies with Miss Barnes, and they'd get what they could at the market.”Steve said brushing flower from his hands.
Instantly noticing the down turn of her friend's expression, she sighed. “I'm not saying I'm going to shoot him Phil, look I know things are different now but for many people here that's not the case.”
For now though it didn’t matter, right now he just wanted to wash off the dirt and stink from the fight. He paged the nurses to let them know, a kindly nurse showed up a few moments later to remove all the monitors and switch off the machines. She told him that he had a visitor outside who said they had some clothes for him to wear home. He thanked her and said he’d only be a moment.
Bruce wasn’t going to scold a grown man, they all had their issues and he had read Steve’s file. He knew PTSD was a factor and that the nightmares could take many forms. Generally, Steve’s anxiety came from memories of the war, however, given the current situation it wasn’t unheard of for that anxiety to be transferred over to anxiety about the baby.
“Stylish yet simplistic, Steve we have a little fashionista on our hands. She gets it from me obviously.” Tony said sliding the little yellow enamel daffodils into his daughter’s hair.
“Shouldn’t we stop them?” Bruce questioned watching along with the madness. He had a bad feeling about this, like most things his friends did. Though the little green-tailed mer honestly tried not to dwell on it - lest his fin spines puff up and that was just embarrassing. Try being the one pup in the school who inflated every time they felt threatened then tipped upside down. Thankfully now he had more upper body mass and it wasn't that bad.
Barnes headed back toward the kitchen commenting wryly over his shoulder, “Are you sure I can't make you anything before you leave?I could make you some bacon, I know how much you like it.”
The alien god had actually come back to notify everyone on his brothers trail and punishment. Apparently it had been deemed that Loki’s mind was broken and he was imprisoned and being tended to by Asgard’s healers. Most of the Avengers seemed skeptical but no one wanted to rain on Thor’s parade. The poor guy cared about his brother, and if what he said was true and Loki really had been tortured and brainwashed, then he should get the help he needed.
Stark took a step back shaking out his hands. “No …yeah… I mean. Look, we haven’t outlined things yet if that’s what you mean but we agreed that what ever happened that I wasn’t going to leave him unless he tells me to go. You have my express permission to call Pepper or the spy twins down here and kick my ass if need be.”
The fight just drained out of the billionaire at that point. “Fine, but J monitors everything and if things start looking sketchy I reserve the right to veto this home birth plan.”
It was James who suggested perhaps they meet up with Kurt and Logan and meet the couples adopted son. To be honest, James wanted to speak to Logan privately about the process, not so much from the legal or even financial portion, but how to be supportive to his omega. After reading that some adoptions can fall through at the last moment, the former soldier couldn't imagine how devastated Loki would be if such a thing happened.
This time there was more at stake, more of them had things they couldn't lose. It's different when you have little to nothing to come home to. Going into battle used to be a rush. While the adrenaline still flooded their veins there was always an under current of dread for each of them.
Tony was still so young then, so happy to hold his father’s hand and see all the exhibits. Then they would stop at the center of the room called “Hall of Heroes” right there in the center was the display devoted to Captain America and The howling commandos. Tony’s eyes would light up and his father would lift the little boy on his hip and point to the case and whisper.
A second happy side effect was that more people were coming around to Tony and Steve’s relationship, the idea that a love so strong could bring two people back together across miles and circumstance. It did not seem to matter that they were both men, the outpouring of support was something to behold.
For a split second, Tony thinks he's made a mistake, a single dreadful error and now this shit was going to kill him. Maybe his calculations had been wrong and holy hell if they were; he was beyond fucked. There was no way Barnes could fix this or even attempt to save him from the flood of nanotech rewriting his system.
“Tony I don’t mean it like that,” Steve soothed, leaning in to kiss the now clean jaw. “It’s soft, you’re very handsome.”
“Yes, and given my husbands profession I would not think we make such a desirable couple on paper to...most agencies.”
The omega startled at the cautious touch on his bicep. Steve was standing there with his shirt in hands staring blankly at the floor. It took a few blinks and deep breaths to focus on the hand that lay steady and warm on his arm. How long had he been standing there? He hadn’t even heard Tony come in.
Instead, the blond ignored the jabs of the older boys and continued with his sweeping up. Minding Fury as the old tabby swished out of the kitchen and hoped onto the table. The cat picked over the left overs on his master’s plates before taking up residence in Grants lap.
Natasha put a hand up to her com link before answering, “Friday’s routing all available cameras and satellites feeds to Coulson’s team now. We have everyone on this Tony, we will find him.”
“Aww, is the big bad alpha sad? Do I have to give him a back rub and a cookie?” Steve sassed right back, rolling over to press up against his lover’s side.
Phil had briefed her on the underground Shield operation and if Widow was surprised she didn’t show it.
Steve looked to the sky and watched in horror as an RPG, clipped the suit.  Tony spun out and bounces off the ground "yeah, good idea Capsicle" said the billionaire as he stood up trying to shake off the disorientation.
“So Strucker staged a coup?” Coulson added looking up at the woman on the screen, wheels already turning in his head. There was something about her, beyond the fact that she should be over 100 years old ...and according to Barnes – dead. There was something natural in here eyes.” I’ll venture a guess that your mission was a little more than recon?”
Steve smirked as he opened the bathroom drawers “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you without it.”  He said looking for his razor when he realized it wasn’t there.
Somewhere in that madness that was the battle of New York they even became friends. Steve realized how wrong he was when he saw Iron man steering that nuke into the sky. Prepared to die for a city full of people that had a love/hate relation ship with the former weapons manufacturer. To ‘throw himself on the wire’, Tony Stark was not pretending to be a hero …he was one.
Another image came to the alpha that made his mind purr as he walked from the office toward the nesting room. Steve bathed n the evening light, lying on the bed with the kids.  All of them peaceful and safe, this was what it was all for.
A group of sailors sat swapping stories by the taverns glowing hearth, frothing steins in their fists clinking against one another as they cheered for each others triumphs. Howard leaned over on his stool to hear their words when something caught his attention.
Steve sat in silence just staring at the old leather-bound journal, he remembered it. Maybe that made it worse because now he knew there was no way to deny its contents. Because he had seen this very book countless times before the ice.
The others began to promptly make their back to the boat and wait for Steve. This had been the most chaotic thing any of them had ever seen and would be happy to put this monstrous day behind them.
“Pete will be better off,” he said to himself glancing one more at the image. “Pep will be a good mom, and Hap he’ll be a good dad. They will give him a normal life, a good life.”  A small voice in his head said no… said Peter already had too many pictures on shelves of the people he loved who died. He was just a little boy, he’d lost too much.  That voice that sounded so much like Steve, pleading with him to turn back.
Recalling Steve's concerns months ago, Bruce wonders if this is something they all missed. Something they all were too busy to see or worse yet – something they didn't care enough to see. Loki may not have been that forthcoming but still, he had changed over the last couple of years and they all just ignored that.
The omega seemed to think this over before grabbing the offered hand and dragging the slighter male into the nesting room. He was doing this for Tony so it was ok. Tony needed help so it made it ok, it wasn’t about him and this didn’t make him weak. He was helping his alpha and that was important.
Stark covered his  face and chuckled into his palms. “Oh god, you Irish Catholics…allergic to birth control.” He pulled his hands away and looked into a pair of serious and longing blue eyes. “You know how hard it was with the twins. Are you sure you want to do that again?”
Time felt like it stood still at that one little utterance. "You forgive me? I killed you... Obviously not permanently yet even still, I have taken so much from you."
“How… I thought it was bioelectronics. There's only so far you can go with nanite tech before you end up all terminator and that's nothing like the serum.
In addition, to those of you who read “Glorious Purpose” this is not in connection with that story. However, I hope you all love this one just as much!
She sunk into the lush leather and let the tension leak out of her limbs. It was amazing to think that once upon a time Natasha could have never dreamed of a life like this. Home, Family, Friends, and Safety. All of that seemed like such a far away and childish dream.
No ones completely bullet proof, James understood that more than anyone did. Especially after this last mission. They could have died and then what?
There was the tremble again; Loki noticed it this time as he set the tray down. He clenched his jaw momentarily and sat back as if it hadn't happened. She suspected he knew that she would have seen it. He knew who she was, what would he do?
AN: So it seemed things were leaning to super family, however I’m not 100% ruling anything out. Therefore, I guess I’ll surprise you guys. Regardless of the outcome, please don’t be nasty if you didn’t get what you wanted. I can only write what I feel at the time and how this story unfolds is really dependent on how I feel .  So remember to be kind and enjoy.
Steve did as he was told and blushed as he felt the glide of lipstick on his mouth. This one was called Dubonnet - dark like blood and made his skin seem that much paler. When Bucky kissed him it smeared a little, but then that was part of it to because Bucky liked to leave him messy.
Steve sat there holding the little black and white print out, Simmons had stepped out to go get Tony. What was he going to say to him? How could he do this to Tony… things were so new between them and this. What if Tony was angry?
So the strange little pack was gathering around the dinner table together for the first time in months. Steve had pulled Tony aside privately and explained he felt he would just announce it. Stark just smirked and made a comment that Steve should just say  ‘pass the gravy oh by the way I have a birth canal if anyone was wondering. These are good biscuits.’  Steve was not impressed.
“Is it? Or is that the lie you tell yourself to make this seem righteous. You know I used to think Steve was bad about that sort of thinking. Truth is…you just cant stand losing, you couldn’t stand that your record as director of shield was a joke. So you wanted to make that one final push, and you sacrificed who ever was convenient.”
Stark fell stumbled back and soon took boot to the chest. The he tumbled backward and down a short embankment. The not-Steve coming down after him. He held up the gauntlets to fire but then the shield struck again. Looking up at the shining scorch and scratch covered red white and blue forces a sob from his throat.  “No… just…..just kill me already! Stop looking like him, stop using that fucking shield!”
Peter didn’t understand why he had to go stay with Aunt Pepper; Jarvis didn’t say that his daddy had to go away for work. That was usually when he would stay with her. That morning his daddy packed his things and Peter went with Uncle Happy. He asked his daddy when he was coming back but Tony just kissed his forehead and told him he’d come get him soon.
Said goal worked pretty well....up until a 6ft hunk of blond and blue eyes thawed out. Well, Tony always had been unconventional.  So tying the knot with Steve Rogers was just a natural progression...or an atomic bomb in the making. Depends on who you ask really.
Maybe it was his nature interfering -Tony wanted to tell the nosey Alpha in his brain to shut up but he couldn’t, he wanted to get Steve out of there as soon as possible. Everything about the blonde’s poster seemed off right now. When they started digging into Steve’s past, it was just reminding the omega of everything he had suffered. Tony could see with every moment Steve was pulling away, trying so hard to hold his head up in this body that wasn’t his- straighten out those too broad shoulders and put up every appearance that he was different now.
When they arrived, Steve held open the door as any gentlemen would, so set in his ways,  but it made Loki smile just a little as it reminded him of James. His alpha always pulled out his chair and held the door, something he'd come to understand was not customary in these days as it had been before.
Then again, Barnes wasn't exactly one to talk about his feelings either. So maybe they had just fallen into a comfortable silence and each built there own fences to protect them from each other. It was easier than sitting down and really digging into the root of the problem and airing out all of that shit that kept you awake at night.
There were no parades, no accolades, not that he wanted them now. Steve didn’t know what he wanted. The one thing he knew for sure was he couldn’t bear to follow the orders of dishonest men anymore.
Bereft – was really the only word adequate enough to describe the collective feeling as the quin jet faded into the distance.
What a body it was too. All lean muscle and fair skin, the kid had a cocky grin and he knew exactly what he was doing when he sauntered into Tony's office. Ever since Tony had become Director of Shield and by extension was now overseer to these kids who were suppose to be the next generation of Avengers, he'd been dealing with Loki's shit.
Banner looked down at the tiles and sighed, slipping his glasses back up onto the bridge of his nose. “I'm not saying this is the end Loki. I'm saying I need more data. Maybe if Thor or someone else on Asgard has documentation on your race that would go along way in figuring out where to go from here. As for right now, the best advice I can give is to remember that Fertility issues have a lot to do with hormonal levels and those we know can be influenced by mental states. So just try and relax and get back into a healthy state while we work on the logistics.”
“Damn it Peter I said go to bed!” Tony did not mean to yell, his nerves were just so frayed. He regretted it immediately when he saw the child flinch, losing balance tripping back against the door. Little eyes filled with tears. “Petey sweetheart I’m sorry.”
"I'm sorry Captain, I wish you did not have to find out this way." The agent said,  as they boarded the quinjet.
In those by gone days, there was always a team of faithful servants skittering around to make the royal rooms run as smoothly as the rest of the palace halls. Smells of roasted meats wafting through the gilded corridors; the hushed conversation of Asgaurdian council members and well-to-do members of society. That last one was a memory Loki did not miss at all.
Ever since the project Steve had an unspoken terror that one day, he would wake up and go back to the way he was. Useless and weak, days spent in sick beds watching the world pass by. He couldn’t go back to that, refused to go back to that. He’d fight with every once of strength he had left and if one day it failed. Even the he’d just keep on fighting, no mater how his body protested he would still push as far as he needed to get the job done. Until he dropped for good, until he really couldn’t struggle up on thin shaking legs, drag busted knuckles under an equally busted nose, and mutter those words… ‘I can do this all day.’
The director stood pinching the bridge of his nose. "I don't know what daddy issues you need to work out or whatever this is, but trust me when I say there are other fish in the sea."
(Dinner with his parents had been like this more often than not. His mother always insisted that they all have at least one meal together a week. As a child, sitting silently as he finished his plate hadn't been much of a problem. HE had learned early that Howard didn't have the patience for mindless chatter. As he grew up however, the rebellious streak was painted a mile wide through the heir of Stark. Tony would often make snide remarks here and there just to get a rise out of the old man – much to his mother chagrin.)
After the first impact rocked the foremost gates, Tony jetted out over the warehouse. Landing with a clunk on the distressed old tar roof, the HUD scanned for possible booby traps or monitoring equipment. Not that Stark expected to find any given the age and general dilapidated appearance of the building. Theses days, Hydra was spreading themselves thin. Since Red Skulls disappearance the group had floundered under some less than inspiring political minds. Bad for them but good for the world at large. Not only that but there were new baddies on the block and as the saying goes ' the enemy of my enemy is my friend.' SHIELD had been monitoring the cells of terrorist activity and ill-organized militia – so far the fall out for big red's escape had slowed the age-old foe down to a crawl.
“I don’t think we’ve met,” He spoke evenly with all the confidence exuded at countless board meetings and press conferences. Stark held out his hand with that photo flash ready smile of his. “Tony Stark.”
Charles Xavier waved with an equally good nature smile. “It was such a lovely day I believed I would pay a visit. It's come to my knowledge a key member of my faculty is in residence after all.”
Loki did his best to dispel the traitorous thoughts of the past and ground himself in the presence. Stark Tower was safe, built of cold unfeeling steel...but safe. Things were progressing for the better, and the presence of the others had been the balm Loki had never thought he would need.
Moreover, this was still Loki. The God of mischief might have a new face but still waters run deep. That almost other worldly green of the youth's eyes still sparkled with ...what was it he said in Stuttgart...ah. 'glorious purpose.'
Laying under the gleaming lights of the med bay, James wishes this day would hurry up and end. He wants deep down it never started. Why did anyone have to go out and try and muck up the world? What purpose did something like that serve? Mallen turned himself into a monster, for what? Hydra? Anarchy?
