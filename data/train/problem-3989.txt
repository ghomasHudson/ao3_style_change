For the first time since meeting him, Dean registers how magnificent Castiel’s smile is. Two perfect rows of straight white teeth, the smallest hint of forming crows feet at the outer corners of his sapphire eyes, making Castiel appear a little older than he probably is. Dean no longer feels intimidated by him, now he’s seen something other than an intense stare.
The blue-eyed boy pauses, lost for words for a moment. Although born into a pretty religious family, Castiel knows that his siblings wouldn’t
Dean thinks for a moment. It’s Friday night, so he’s got nothing to be up early for tomorrow – he’s only back here at night.
He’s not exactly tech-savvy. He mainly uses his laptop for Netflix or work, but he still knows the basics. Castiel hovers the mouse over the search bar at the top of the website. He doesn’t need to pause to think up his last name – Castiel has already embarrassingly ingrained those four syllables to memory. He types;
“Tell me about it! I’d seen the movie, but
“Dean’s told me a lot about you,” Castiel says when they pull away.
Rocky Horror in the next one - yay!
“Uhh, thank you, man. I’m not the owner though, I’m just the dog’s body.” Castiel’s eyes squint slightly, as if attempting to read Dean. Dean feels slightly intimidated.
“I did,” Sam continues after a short pause. “Look, Dean. Dad hasn’t heard from you in months, and the first thing you say is that?! You know he’s trying, he’s actually improved a crap ton. He was hurt by your text.”
“I know, Gabriel, I’ll be careful. It’s just nice to have a friend outside the family.”
of me not to,” she murmurs with a patronising tone of voice, shifting to look out the passenger side window.
“No way! They’re made for each other,” Jo shakes her head, “their chemistry is undeniable!”
which would let him know she thinks he’s an idiot for letting Lisa Braeden go. He gets none of that. Instead, she nods;
type, Cassie.”
He leans over the passenger seat and opens the door for her with an apologetic smile. “Baby, I know I’m late, I’m sorry! There was this fuckin’ mis-hap at the store – and Benny left me in charge, it just threw my whole plan off, Lis!”
Dean doesn’t believe the other boy means what he says, but he chokes at the compliment, “jeez, well... Thanks, man... We should – ya' know -” He gestures to the Impala and scratches the back of his neck which is feeling a little hotter than usual. He notices that this is becoming a regular occurrence when Castiel is around.
It’s always the same. He’ll never change. But he’ll do this for Sammy if it’ll make him happy.
The bulb goes out completely, and Ellen descends down the ladder, “it’s a new one but it looks like Ash ain’t installed it right.” She faces Dean and gestures to the problem, “you do it, please. I should’ve just gotten you to fix it in the first place, would’ve saved me the hassle.”
piece of music Dean Winchester has suggested. He would say he especially loves this song due to its Christian symbolism. In actuality, it’s because Dean stated it was one of his favourites. It’s a far cry from Bach and Chopin.
“Actually, yeah. They’re doing a performance of ‘The Rocky Horror Show’ at The Folly next month and I was wondering if you’d be interested in that kind of thing?”
“Yeah?”
He recognises a missed phone call from Sammy and presses the ‘call’ button. Sam picks up on the third ring.
“Dean, you know how I feel about drink. Dad is doing so well nowadays and I’m really proud of him. I don’t think he wants to see his past behaviour mirrored in his son.” Sam must see Dean’s face fall. Dean thinks that Sam is having a dig at him for his own drinking behaviour and obvious strained relationship with John.
by Dean’s.
Dean cringes at the thought of small talk with John. That’s only one of the reasons he gave up on speaking to the man in the first place.
Dean’s thoughts of Mr Blue-Eyes are interrupted by Bela’s sultry English accent, “So, Dean... You got a girlfriend or

like they had known each other for years, rather than mere hours.
“We settled for each other. Goodbye Dean.” With that, she leaves. He assumes she'll probably call a cab home.

He tells Jessica that life has been real busy recently, but he reassures her that he’ll give Lisa a call later tonight.
“Ouch! He’s not really
experimental in his hay-day.” Dean hovers his finger over the words on the back. “The first half of the tracks on here are fantastic, and uh... The second half of the record is completely instrumental, ambient and tranquil. Initially the project was to be used as the soundtrack for his movie, ‘The Man Who Fell to Earth’ – amazing film btw... But yeah... Like I said, I don’t know much ‘bout classical, but there’s some tracks without vocals on there and... Maybe it’ll be a stepping stone into the genre.”
“Yeah, of course! Benny, you don’t need to say any more.”
Once Dean has washed his hair and scrubbed his body, he allows himself a few minutes to just stand and embrace the hot lashes of water bouncing off his shoulders and down his torso. Skin reddened from the roasting water, and satisfied enough, the man turns off the shower, dries, and opens the bathroom drawer which is filled with his day to day attire.
Castiel’s voice is like being engulfed in a warm wool blanket on a winter’s day with the crackle of a roaring fire. It's soft, comforting, but also a little rough and raspy. Which is probably why Dean’s stomach flutters a little at him using his vocal chords to shape and sound Dean’s own name. “Wait, what?” Is all he can muster.
“Hi boys!” Jessica knocks once on her apartment door to make the brothers aware of her arrival, before walking in and planting a short kiss on Sam’s cheek. “Oh, Dean – thank you so much for helping me out with this; I know Sunday is your only free day of the week, so I
He shakes the thought from his mind. Too little too late. That was the final nail on the coffin for their relationship, it’s time to move on.
“Did you go back for the records... Or for
“Yeah! You know, De-Dean! I’ve never actually been to see a musical before!” He says a little loudly into Dean’s ear while pulling his leather jacket’s sleeve. It wouldn’t surprise him if the man is going to have permanent eardrum damage to his left ear by the end of the night.
Castiel thoroughly enjoys the rest of the show - however, he feels a tightening in his chest every time one of the show’s male actors struts across the stage shirtless, or in a tight leather corset. He’s thankful for the bottles of Bud because otherwise, he’d be shifting in his seat in a fluster.
Gabriel shows surprise at the mention of the nickname he gave the boy. “Yeah he won’t shut up about it actually – although it’s better than the fuckin’ André Rieu phase he had in high school. You’re becoming a tad of an influence on him; Castiel never takes any of
John looks past his son, “no car? Did you walk?”
It’s Sunday 21st of July, the show is tonight, and Dean will admit, he is nervous to see Castiel. He had hoped the boy would have popped into the store over the last couple of weeks, but he never did. It’s not as if the two hadn’t been in contact – they text almost every day – and Dean is often the one to instigate the messages; which surprises him as that was one of his vices when he was with Lisa. Dean understands that Castiel has been busy helping his father at Celestial Hope, but he misses his company during those long and sometimes quiet shifts.
And so, Dean takes Castiel’s money, thanks him for his purchase and says goodbye to the two brothers. Castiel offers himself a final glance back at the store once outside and smiles genuinely at Dean.
‘Hey Lis baby. I’m so sorry I haven’t been talking much this last week, work has been so hectic. Dinner at Cosmo’s Wednesday night?’ He thinks for a moment, figuring out when he’s not required at The Roadhouse.
“Hmphf,” Castiel grumbles, adjusting himself to lie on his side, he puts the other man on loud-speaker, “what can I help you with?”
Dean laughs at his own joke, “ouch- damn I’m kidding, I’m kidding!” Sam has just thrown a punch to his older brother’s right shoulder.
When Dean is finished, he expects Ellen to give him an eye roll, tut, or
Edit: I'm about 1000 words into chapter 9, hopefully will post in a week or so :)
“Wait? Lisa left you?” Sam, although the younger brother, is always concerned for Dean. Sam and Jessica have such a strong bond and he often worries that his brother won’t find someone like that to share his life with.
He doesn’t need Gabriel to elaborate further. Castiel doesn’t even know his own sexuality. He knows he at least likes men – tall, pretty men. But his brother is right, anyone could see that Dean Winchester is most likely straight.
Jessica shows up at her apartment sometime in the early afternoon; she was working an early morning shift at the hospital’s trauma unit. Dean liked Jessica from the moment Sam sheepishly introduced her to him, a bubbly, smart, and beautiful girl – he wonders how his little brother got so lucky.
I expected, but I love it so far,” Castiel smiles. He’s taking his time on the staircase, being careful not to let his feet disobey him.
– Dean ponders. The mixture of maturity in composure, rasp in his voice, and interest in retirement home music are probably to blame for that.
“Dean!” John sounds... Chipper? It’s been a hot minute since Dean’s felt happy to be seen by his father.
“So what’s your plan for the rest of the night?” Dean allows a sideways glance in Castiel’s direction, but he’s sound asleep – head tilted to one side, leaning against his own shoulder. Dean feels his heart go soft for the man.
After a multitude of wardrobe changes and enough swearing to make a nun sweat, Dean is outside the apartment of Lisa Braeden – and 20 minutes late. As he pulls the car over, he feels a pang of guilt for not texting her beforehand – letting her know he was running behind.
To say that Dean and Jo are a little tipsy is an understatement.
The temperature of Dean’s face rises, causing the freckled skin to turn a soft pink. It must be warmer today... Or the hangover?
The three sit on cushions and eat their lunch. Jessica tells Dean that Lisa is asking for him, and she hasn’t heard from him in over a week. Funnily enough, Jessica is relatively friendly with Lisa; the two work in the same hospital as nurses. Jessica being a student nurse in trauma, and Lisa; who just recently passed her exams and works full time in the renal clinic. Their relationship doesn’t extend very much outside of work, but they’re obviously comfortable with each other to be discussing Dean and Lisa’s love life.
They both know that this is the first step in mending their broken relationship, but wounds are still too fresh for a warm embrace.
“I know I’ve been a shitty father, Dean. God, I treated you like shit, you lost your mother and I had no right leaving you brothers alone half the time.”
Dean’s infatuation with Bela is severed at the mention of Castiel. He can’t hide the excitement in his voice,
He arises, staggers to the kitchen island and grabs his mobile phone. Leaning his forearms on the granite worktop; Dean drunkenly composes a text:
“Yeah, it is what it is. I’m doing good though, and you? How’s
“I don’t think I
The bar is warm and cosy; illuminated with the soft glow of yellowish-white fairy lights. It takes a minute or so of Dean searching the place for Charlie – Castiel doesn’t know what she looks like so he just kind of stands there.
Dean feels his neck redden with a smidge of embarrassment and greets Gabe, “nice choice – it’ll take a couple minutes, I have a few customers before you.”
“Yeah. Rocky is one of my favourites; I’m guilty of watching the bootlegs on YouTube, so it’s nice to be able to actually pay to see it in person. It’s iconic within the LGBT+ community; I’ll have you know.”
to have a new friend.
girl next to him.
. His hair is still a little scruffy, but he thinks the boy suits it; matches his character. Dean can’t help but feel the corners of his lips betray him as they creep into a grin.
“So you really did like it?” Dean’s keeping his eyes on the road, he only had two beers compared to Castiel’s five by the end of the night; but he likes to be careful. Especially when there’s company he’s responsible for.
for me and dust the picture frames on the wall over there,” she points to the far wall. “I’m too damn short and Ash has stolen my only ladder for whatever reason. You’ll have no issue reaching.”
“I suppose I’m eating into your shift now with all this drabble. Go on now – get!” She half points to the entrance to The Roadhouse and chuckles.
“I’m teasing ‘ya! Although I
Dean matches his baggy, burgundy t-shirt with some black skinny jeans and a black leather jacket. After styling his short, sandy hair, and patting some aftershave over his jawline; Dean Winchester thinks he’s looking pretty decent.
“I had heard of the film and the original musical, but to be honest, I had no idea what it was actually about. From what Charlie’s told me, she’s really piqued my curiosity about it all.” Dean grins at the other boy; Castiel must
It’s busier than usual tonight. One of the regular bands, ‘The Kansas Ramblers’ is in full swing tonight, and they fair pretty popular with the locals.
Dean was supposed to call her last night, he
Castiel’s heart skips a beat when Dean casually throws an arm around his waist, pulling the three of them into a tighter hug. He wants to remain in this moment forever, but it ends as abruptly as it began. They wave Charlie off and begin to walk towards the Impala.
Gabriel also recognises the older Winchester brother and gravitates towards him.
At least Dean can look forward to Castiel coming to the store hopefully this week, surely he’ll be itching for more records. Hell, it's so
“Dean.” She speaks softly, “what happened exactly?”
Charlie reassures Dean that she was joking, and she was getting Castiel up to speed about the show whilst Dean was buying the drinks.
10:45am.
Dean is the colour of beetroot by this point so he promptly excuses himself and stresses to the couple to have a good evening.
“Sex on the beach, a-thank you.” The only folk who order those type of drinks are either young women, or gay men.
“She’s a great girl, Dean. If you don’t wanna buckle down and make some sort of inkling that you’re committed; she’ll find someone who will,” Jessica is poking mindlessly at her pasta salad with her fork. The conversation moves to a lighter note. Sammy discusses his plan to apply to Stanford before he graduates, and Jessica, a year into her nursing course, can’t wait to work at the hospital full time.
you ain’t stopped since you took over this joint!” He waves his arm dismissively round the building’s interior. “How about you take the rest of the night off, it looks like it’ll be a slow one, no need for us both to be here.”
Castiel smiled tightly, hugging his knees. “That’s- that’s fine.”
With that, she swept away, and he darted upstairs to his bathroom.
"That's the best idea I've heard all year."
“Nah.” He smiled softly. “I’d rather continue our conversation.”
Sam looked reluctant, but did as he was told, scooping his jacket off the back of the chair, and moving to the door.
"Sam."
“Cas? Are you-?”
“You won’t.” He forced the words past the lump in his throat. “Not until we’re old, and grey, and ninety years old living in a care home. We can sit on a porch and shake our walkers at teenagers.”
“No. No, through there it's Earth, but...but different.” Cas joined him, staring into the light. “It's a– it's an alternate reality.”
"I don't know what to do now," he said softly, surprising himself.
Dean started forward, a horrified shout breaking his voice.
“Yes,” Cas deadpanned.
“Physically, he’s mostly uninjured, but severely dehydrated. The doctors believe there’s psychological trauma, though, given that he won’t say a word, or respond to anything we say.”
Within seconds the blue-eyed boy from before was standing in front of her, shoulders stiff, and hands by his sides. "Yes mother?"
The two women left, and Castiel noted that the security men had taken up positions outside the door.
Mary shut the oven door, smiling at her son. “I know, sweetheart. I talked to Mrs Milton earlier.”
She sighed heavily, turning to the door. “You can call the other family members. His brother, you said?”
he scolded himself.
The hour passed slowly, but he began to see familiar landmarks eventually, leading to a warmth kindling in his heart.
“Technically, we’ve met. Over the phone, that is. We asked her to keep you out of your dorms for the day.”
“What do you mean?”
"I want to stay with you," Castiel murmured, fingers hooking into Dean's belt loops. "I missed you these past months."
The sight hit him like an angel-blade to the heart.
Slowly, methodically, he loaded his guns.
“Castiel Winchester,” he said softly. “Sounds perfect, doesn’t it?”
“Hello, Dean. Sam.”
“The station. Call me from there, and I’ll update you.”
A flash of green whirled through his mind.
Cas stood carefully, stepping forward to take his elbow. “Be careful. Remember what I told you. No sudden movements.”
His own room was empty, left untouched, save for the bed which looked rumpled and slept in.
A split second of shock flickered through Dean’s eyes before his shoulders slumped, and his eyes closed. “He wasn’t- yeah. He wasn’t wrong.”
Maybe he might-
He didn't care what happened.
“I promise you’ll see in a minute. Yes or no?”
Please please please pleasepleasepleaseplease
In this moment it hit him that he was about to lose Jack again too.
Dean's finger was moving, tapping, and-
Every sound echoed when he was left alone, and either the silence came the memories, pressing in.
Castiel stared at her back, not sure if she was joking or not.
Castiel leaned into it, eyes misting over. "Yeah. Okay."
Cas traced a finger over the letters, a painful warmth blooming in his chest.
Mary looked up, and seeing Castiel, gave him a warm smile. "Hello. What's your name?"
“Okay, sorry. I thought- maybe-” a huff of air. “Anyway. Are you- are you hurting?”
Dean: Any way to climb out the window?
“Yes, your majesty. Bye.”
Cas felt every trace of energy that had appeared drain away, leaving him empty, and exhausted.
Dean’s hand swept soothingly over his shoulders, grip loosening enough to resettle him in a more comfortable position. “We thought you were dead. Thought no way could you have lived through getting hurt like that, the fall, and the icy water. Should have known, though, cause you wouldn’t let a tiny thing like that keep you down.”
Dean huffed a laugh. “God, that sounds amazing. I never thought retirement could sound so appealing.”
The air was hot.
When it escalated to physical, he avoided Dean on the days when he was bruised, or crying.
“Yeah, I got it off an old–” Dean hesitated. “New pal of mine. See, we have this bet, see if it works against an archangel. So... say hello to my little friend.”
Dean opened his mouth- to say what, exactly, he didn’t know.
“Try not to move,” Crowley said quickly. “You’re healing well, but movement will slow it down.”
Me: No
That was the first thing he noticed.
Dean curled a hand around the back of his neck, holding him close. “That all you got?”
Both just breathing in each other’s presence, neither moved, neither spoke, happy and together again at last.
Her eyes widened, and she drew in a sharp breath. “How is your back? I know that’s where you got it the worst…”
He’d have blisters in the morning, almost certainly, but nothing could overshadow the relief he felt at finally being home.
Cas darted forward, lashing out with the angel blade.
Loud banging woke them up, followed by Sam's voice.
It was night, and he slowly registered the sound of breathing beside him.
“You wanna bet your life on that? You think I couldn't get a sheriff to lend me his men to take down Michael King?”
Dean’s gaze lifted, carefully schooling his expression into a blank mask. “I should be asking you that, don’t you think? Or maybe we don’t tell each other these things anymore. Maybe,” he paused. “Maybe I should be asking what else you’ve hidden from me?”
He pointed at Sam. “And you were Polish.”
The movement, slow as it was, stopped when he saw just who was behind him.
He would have to thank his dad for keeping the windows oiled to where they wouldn't creak.
"Out, preferably."
"John's out back working. I'll get Mary."
"Also yeah." Closing his eyes, Dean took a deep breath. "Because I needed a little bit of a push to do this."
It didn’t feel right, but it was the only one anyone had given him, so he accepted it.
Dean was awake, though.
With everything he had in him, he hoped.
“Whatcha say, Cas?” Dean smiled softly. “Will you marry me? Be mine forever?”
He’s talking about me, Castiel realized with a burst of warmth.
Until Lucifer was gone, suddenly, and Dean rolled over painfully to find Crowley smiling thinly at the devil. “Surprise.”
Late afternoon sun cast shadows through the hall, motes of dust filtering through the air.
“I’m… I’m sorry, how is this relevant?”
Step after step backwards, Lucifer quailed, and was forced back against the flickering line of the portal.
Maybe it was night?
He was sitting at his regular seat, and he eyed her warily as she hurried to his side. “He’s got them,” she hissed.
Joanna grinned mirthlessly. “I can see why they like you. You’re not lacking common sense, that’s for sure.”
Jody grabbed his arm, tugging him over to the side of the bed, and into Dean’s line of sight.
“Shoot.”
Dean sighed happily, pressing another kiss to his forehead. “To continue, yes, Sam knows I’m back. I got here… uh… Wednesday? Figured I’d surprise you Friday, today, so we could have the weekend, and you wouldn’t have school.”
“That’s not even a question,” Castiel pointed out softly. “You know I always want you here.”
“You’re not getting out of here alive,” Michael said mockingly. “You, or your little friends. The three of you have been a stain in my ledger since day one, and I’m ready to end it, once and for all.”
Somehow he knew what Dean was asking, and it was the one thing he’d wanted for years, so he nodded quickly, and then he was being wrapped in warm arms.
“I’m not a defenseless child anymore, and I’m not going to let you stab me in the back again. You know I’m faster than you. You’re not leaving here alive.”
The front door was unlocked, to let them in, Dean explained.
Dean to the house in front of them, and Castiel to the house beside.
“They’re hunting Michael King, the guy that did this to you.”
Their reasoning in being there at all was that Chuck needed a quiet place to write his novel.
“She was very angry. Said if I didn’t “cooperate” she’d take extreme measures. She was… incensed, and insisted that it was your bad influence that had me acting like that.”
“Not about us being together, no.” Looking down at his hands, he swallowed tightly. “She doesn’t approve of me or you. Your ‘influence’ as she put it.”
Sam didn’t seem to expect a response, for he pushed himself out of the chair, and started towards the stairs
"Where's your head at?"
He had to time this exactly right, or he’d risk hitting something crucial.
The news was broadcast through the kingdom.
Flopping an arm across his eyes, he barely registered the slight footsteps until a hand prodded his ribs harshly. “Wake up lover boy.”
Deep breath.
And they’d left him alone, with no help.
“Cas? Hey, everything okay?”
Alright, that wasn’t much of an explanation.
“Both of you are welcome, Sam. I’ll get a second hotel room. You can bring yourself, alright? That’s enough. I need to call Bobby, but I’ll keep you updated, okay?”
With his memory returned, Castiel is back on the hunt.
-until he could breathe again, past the heavy weight of panic sitting low in his chest.
“You’ll be careful, okay?” He squeezed his son’s shoulder. “I don’t care if you’re God now. You’re still our son, so be careful.”
At that point, he gave up.
Windows.
"You too."
"Please… if you can't bring him back-"
The dust clouds rose higher, and soon the riders were revealed.
With a quick, steadying inhale, Dean met his eyes. “You. My turn. When we came back to the hospital, you were completely gone. No trace. What happened?”
With that thought, the tears came.
“I really don’t want to stay in bed.” He shrugged disparagingly, giving her a pleading look. “Please?”
"Thank you."
Seven.
“Hey.”
“You’re not a chatty one, then?”
"Turn around.”
He brought his legs up under him, resting his arms lightly on his knees. “Just happy.”
He backed away, grinning. "Yes or no?"
He grabbed the gun, slamming it into Dean’s face.
The sharp report of the gun echoed, once, twice, accompanied by a muffled scream, and the world fell away.
Steps creaked under his feet.
In a stroke of luck, no one was in there except for them, and when the lights went off, and the movie started, it was their own little world.
“I’ll be his best friend,” Dean declared firmly. “Forever and ever.”
Sam recognized the knife, Castiel knew. He’d used them for target practice with his friend many times.
Mrs Milton raised her eyebrows. "Stay clean. Do not distract your father."
He didn’t flinch as the door opened, just sat there, still and silent.
Too many dead, he thought tiredly.
Cas wrapped his arms around Dean’s shoulders, grinning down at him. “Been practising, have you? You couldn’t do this a year ago.”
Bobby raised an eyebrow. "Who are you? And what business do you have with them?"
He was out of bed at the earliest opportunity, exploring the town with many breaks to rest.
He began hunting, and each hunt alleviated some of the angry tension left in his shoulders.
The blank expression that settled over her face was terrifying. “If you will not cooperate, then I will be forced to… take action.”
They watched movies for most of the day, interspersed between nurse visits, and Jody stopping in.
She stopped, not looking at him. "Yes?"
Eight days later, Joanna came cantering in, barely stopping to tie her horse before storming into the bar.
Castiel pushed open the door, entering quietly.
If he had been paying attention, he would’ve seen the way Dean’s eyes flicked up to his face.
Instead of kissing him, though, he shoved his hand in his pocket and pulled out a piece of chocolate.
The living room, full as it was with smoke and flames, was empty.
“I mean you’re not going crazy. That option’s out.” Dean took another small step forward. “I’ve got another guess, though.”
“It’s beautiful,” he whispered.
Castiel drummed his fingers on his cheek, staring down at the cushion. “My mother had me taken to a burn center in California. She took my cell phone, which was of no use anyway, because I never learned your number. We had no need for phones when he lived beside each other. She made sure none of my letters got through, and-” he faltered, hands shaking. “Said she wouldn’t keep paying for the ‘best care money could buy’ if I didn’t stop being stubborn, and trying to contact you.”
The call with Bobby went much the same as with Sam, although the older man stayed composed. Mostly.
Sam nodded, staying silent.
He had washed up at a river, apparently, with only the clothes he was wearing, and nothing else.
With one last desperate burst of strength, he shoved his shoulder against the glass, and was rewarded by the shattering panes, and a burst of air.
Jack cooed.
“Yes. Sam. He’s at school right now. I haven’t talked to him today, really, except to say good morning and stuff.”
She stepped inside, and he made his way to the bathroom, turning the faucet on full blast, and ducking to splash cold water over his face.
Instantly Dean missed the warmth.
"You're an amazing person."
“Yeah.”
“I know you always said you wouldn’t eat pudding until you were eighty in a care home, but this is extenuating circumstances.” He peeled the top off the cup, stirring the pudding with the spoon.
Giving a sniff, she stood up. “The doctors will explain everything.”
Hated himself for not trying harder.
Wary, ready to pull back if needed, he reached for Dean’s hand again.
Instead his knee nearly gave out, and he ducked down to press a hand over it, hissing in a sharp breath at the pain. “Son of a bitch.”
“You’re a murderer,” Dean snarled. “Nothing but a weak, slimy, yellow-bellied excuse for a man.”
CASTIEL.
With no one around to see, he let the tears fall.
They had thought he was dead, he knew. With that injury, combined with the long fall and icy water, he should by all rights be dead.
Then, he heard a sound, vaguely familiar, but something he hadn't heard in so long.
Warm breath gusted over his shoulders as Dean leaned closer, bringing his hands up to trace the dark lines of ink.
The moments after that were a blur of hits, and then, after finding himself on the ground, kicks too.
“Try and feed him the pudding, the oatmeal and juice is for you.” Meg handed him two spoons, and backed over to the cot. “I have to supervise, of course.”
"He's… God. Sort of. Him and Amara are kind of… doing a balance thing. Yin yang. I don’t know."
"No. Castiel is dead. So whatever you are, you're not him."
Desk messy, papers strewn on the top.
"Kisses?"
He dropped to his knees beside Cas’ body, barely heeding the disappearing footsteps as Sam and Mary ran back to the house.
Something shattered in Sam’s face, and he shook his head weakly. "Cas, Dean is- he's…"
Cas had taken this hunt for a specific reason, not because of any misplaced sense of righteousness, but because he needed a reason to get out of the bunker.
But Pamela hadn’t said it, it was-
“I'll check on her,” Mary brushed past them, hurrying up the stairs.
She strode into the bar, slipping through the dinner hour patrons, and stepping up to the bar beside where he’d been sitting.
Next light, he was off again.
Dean laughed softly, pulling his knees to his chest. “Deal. You first.”
Sure, he’d known objectively that Dean was safe, but seeing it now was a different thing.
“Why is Cas sad?”
“Hey Jess. Is Sam there?”
The second time he woke up, he was in a different room, and his mother was there.
Another shake of his head.
“I love you,’ Dean repeated. “I’ll tell you that as many times as it takes to sink in, okay? I’m not going anywhere.”
He knew the moment his gun fired that it was true, that he had succeeded.
It felt like coming home.
Without breaking eye contact, Dean reached out to take his hand, lacing their fingers together.
"We finally have enough!"
A smile spread across Castiel’s face, and he pressed kiss after kiss on Dean’s face. “You- are- the- most- amazing- boyfriend- ever.”
The voice amplified the pounding in his head, and as he doubled over, his entire body burned.
Eyes quickly blurring, he paid no attention to where he was going, eventually ending up in a dim hallway full of unused machinery.
She had a soft, unguarded expression on, and for a moment he thought that was what she must’ve looked like when she held him and Sam, all those years ago.
"I didn't exactly have a choice," he said bitterly. "I was unconscious."
“I don’t think he’s interested,” she said slowly. “He turns everyone down every time he comes here.”
Me: I don't know
“Yeah. I capiche.” Castiel dropped his hands to the hem of his shirt, toying idly with the fabric before taking a deep breath, and unbuttoning his shirt, and letting it drop from his shoulders.
He was crying.
It had been a week since he’d been back, and silence loomed over his shoulder with every breath.
“Hey.” He glanced up to where Jody was watching him, and she waved a hand to continue. “It’s me. It’s Cas. Remember?”
He could see Sam struggling to stay calm, and Cas squeezed his arm. “It’s okay. Come on.”
"You feelin' better?"
“Yeah. Yeah. No worries. I’ll take care of him.”
One of Dean’s hands dropped to press against his side, pain filled his body, and the last thing he knew before he blacked out was Dean, ordering him to stay awake.
“Said to meet them at Devil's Point, in a weeks time. That’s in three days, with hard riding.”
His hand reached, unnoticed, for the gun at his side, while the other took the paper, and unfolded it.
"Do what-?"
Dean.
"Okay," Dean repeated. "Okay, uh… I don't know how to say this, it might sound a little weird- do you, I don't know, maybe-"
Dean nodded tersely.
His boyfriend sounded like he was crying.
“Yes. She was… angry. That I had run into a burning building, but refused to think of it as my fault, putting the blame on your family. And everything that happened before...”
Cas opened his eyes slowly, contentment spreading through every bone in his body. “Let’s take a drive,” he suggested.
The one word answer was definitive, but made him angrier. “No. You aren’t going to take me away. I’ve lived here as long as I can remember! This is my home. I’m not leaving. You can’t force me to.”
For some reason this made Dean beam wider. "Me too."
Making as little noise as possible, he rolled out of bed, and crept to the window.
“That’s your fault,” Castiel quipped. “Should’ve taken a nap instead of watching me sleep.”
Horror laced through his veins, and he dug his fingernails into the palms of his hands.
Dean.
She drew in a sharp breath. “You covered them?”
"We'll do it," Castiel agreed quietly. "I'm getting too old to be getting shot. I've always wanted to have a garden."
Most likely it was only a few minutes, but he needed to make another call, and he wasn't looking forward to it.
Soon enough they were pulling into the parking lot of a tall building, gray and dreary looking.
“We’ve got a lot to talk about, huh?”
His voice broke. “You left us. You
“Cas?” Dean mouthed.
“I don’t know if you’re actually… coherent, or able to even hear me, but I think the talking is keeping me sane, so I’ll keep doing so.”
‘Can you help me up?” He interrupted.
In an instant his demeanor changed, and he sat up. "Come again?"
His hands shook by his sides, and his breathing was quick and shallow.
There was a strange warmth on his hip.
"As if I'd get you anything else," Dean teased.
“Charlie…?” Dean’s hand tightened minisculely. “Is she- are you-?”
A small body crashed into their hug, and Sam was talking rapidfire about the planning they had been doing, but Cas barely caught three words of it, still happily dazed.
Dean darted forward, trying to burst through the fence of bodies, but they held him back.
He rolled over, holding his side while glaring at Meg tiredly. “You’re evil.”
“Oh.”
“Dean was always a bad influence,” she insisted. “You’re well-rid of him.”
“Cas, is this place warded?” Sam said urgently.
When Mary looked at him for an answer, the blue-eyed boy gave a small smile. "I'm Castiel."
Four.
“You can’t let yourself get attached. We’re leaving soon.”
Me: Soon
"He can stay with me." There wasn't even a question about that.
“And you’re… twenty-three, correct?”
"Thank you."
Gently taking his arm, Cas steadied him before letting go.
Dean let the silence hang for a few moments before leaning back, grin bright, but eyes slightly red. "Now will you come with me?"
A rustle of movement from the bed drew their attention to where Dean was watching them silently.
Dean was silent for a beat too long, and he twisted around to see his expression.
Castiel pressed his face against Dean's neck, fisting his hands in the back of Dean's shirt, and didn't answer.
Lucifer vanished, and so did the glowing rift.
“We’ve got a lot of time to make up for, then.”
"Do you- are you-?"
"But then which side wins?" Castiel pressed.
He looked up, forcing his face to remain emotionless. “Tattoos. I tattooed over them.”
Sam rested his hand on top of Dean’s, tapping gently.
“Okay, then he’s like the little brother I actually like.”
As his eyes slipped closed, he heard the roar of thunder, and a bright flash of lightning through his eyelids.
The summer air was warm after the air conditioning, and they walked slowly back.
It distracted Dean for a moment, he could tell.
“Dean?”
“Yeah yeah.” Castiel gave a sigh. “Save me some pudding, alright? I’m still hungry.”
He flinched at the bruising grip, but turned to see Dean watching them, silent, but with wide, terrified eyes.
"Thank you."
But it was a reaction.
“Yeah. Take care.”
The mural was everything Dean wasn’t.
“Yes- Yes, what- Why are you calling?”
Cas shrugged. “You know I don’t fit in with your friends, Dean. You’ll have more fun without me.”
This was it.
He sighed softly, opening his mouth-
Gentle hands rolled him over, face pressed into something soft, and fingers rubbed something soothing onto his skin.
The instant she reached for his arm, Dean recoiled, curling in on himself as he tried to get away.
Each step on the stairway let him discover new parts of his body to hurt.
“It has all my stuff in it,” he said softly. “But-”
Just down the coast, he could see the light of one of the human towers with a glowing ball at the top.
“Yes.”
If he ignored that, it almost looked like he was sleeping.
He hesitated, keeping his eyes down. "May I?"
“I don’t want it to be like this,” Dean stated softly. “I don’t want this awkward silence, and the weird feeling of this being not completely right, and for that to stop we need to be completely honest. Got it?”
The way his foot inched back.
“No.”
“Uh… no. Should I be? What’s going on?”
"It's… it’s good to see you," Sam said quietly. "It's really good to see you."
They didn’t speak through the transfer of belongings, communicating mostly through glances, and small touches.
His hand felt dry, and warm, and real, and Cas kind of wanted to cry.
“I think this is the happiest I’ve ever been,” Dean whispered.
Cas faltered for a moment, the first time he hadn’t seemed assured. “That wasn't me. That was the child. And in case you haven't noticed, he's a little busy.”
Maybe it did, and he was just on medication, but it certainly felt like he should be in a lot more pain.
“I told you that me an’ Sammy were always wandering, right? Before we came to the village?”
Castiel released a long, slow breath. “Where are they?”
"Be careful, alright?" Jody waved the guards back with a tight smile. "This is what I was talking about, Castiel. You need to consider that."
He looked down as Castiel stirred, squeezing him tighter. “Hey sleepin’ beauty.” The corner of his mouth quirked upward.
Smoke filled his vision, and he headed for the kitchen.
Right there, a gap in the bodies, and he took it.
The tightening of the skin around Michael’s eyes.
He almost slammed into her when she stopped abruptly, turning to face him. “Look, Mr Novak, there’s some things I didn’t tell you over the phone.”
“Yup. Pleasure to meet you. If you’ll come this way.”
“Dean?” Sam squeezed his hand tightly. “Dean, hey, look at me.”
There was a trick to not letting food spoil, and he hadn’t quite gotten the hang of it.
“I’ll be there as soon as I can. Thank you.”
Hurried footsteps skidded to a stop behind Dean, and Sam dropped to his knees beside him.
“Yeah.” Casting another glance towards the stairs, he lowered his voice. “You know, Cas has faith in this kid.”
The high-pitched beeping woke him.
His brother in all but blood seemed to shove all of the emotion down for a moment, setting his face blankly. "What are you?"
He had been invited to spend it with Sam and Eileen, but he didn’t think it was possible to be around them, see their domestic bliss, and not feel keenly the loss of his own love.
After that day, they stayed in touch.
She held up a tray. “I brought you food though.”
Cas was gone.
"We get together every couple of months, eat some pies, drink beer- not Sam," he added hurriedly, glancing over at Jody, who pretended to stare at the ceiling innocently. "Just me and Bobby, although I really hate the taste. I prefer water, or juice, or anything, really. But Bobby likes it, so he buys it, and offers it to me. I can't refuse it, because he'd probably feel weird being the only one drinking. I don't drive home, though. I usually stay the night."
“A great sacrifice.”
Then he gently moved Dean’s hand over, slipping his hand out of the way, and resting it on top of Sam’s.
"I like you," Castiel interrupted.
Eyes narrowing, she swept away in a huff, hips swinging.
If he would stop resisting, and not try to contact them again, she would send an anonymous donation to help rebuild.
“I went to the bar for dinner,” Dean explained. “I was gonna save the pie for dessert.”
The King’s son had saved a human.
"A hershey's kiss, Dean? Really?" He swiped it anyway, kissing Dean before the taste of chocolate was gone.
Castiel lay there in the dusky light, silently counting the freckles scattered over Dean’s cheeks, and memorizing the way his eyelashes fluttered in sleep.
He ducked out of his hiding place, knowing it wasn't secure enough to protect him from the storm, and hurried to find a new resting place.
"Yes." He stared at his hand, alternately clenching and smoothing the blanket between his fingers. "Yes, I'm fine."
“You’re a great guy, Dean. Thank you,” and with that, Benny hangs up.
are – and Lisa.” She eyes the older Winchester, scanning for answers. Ellen’s always trying to open Dean up – probably motherly instincts. She’s the closest thing Dean has to a mother, and he’s the closest thing to a son Ellen has.
Dean pulls up on the right hand side of the sidewalk and yanks the hand break up. Sam is quick to have his seatbelt unbuckled, shoving his school materials back into his backpack. He gives Dean a smile, thanks him for the ride, and when closing the impala’s door behind him, gives him a lazy wave before walking back to the house.
The curtains creep back, as the opening track begins.
“All good, I hope! He’s talked about you too; from how he described, I thought you’d be shorter.”
Closing the Impala door, Dean smirks at Ellen as he approaches.
“Thanks for the coffee, it’s good,” Castiel turns to Dean after they both have had a few sips.
“Yeah, I wasn’t sure if I could have waited much longer,” Castiel holds the girl’s water while she re-ties her doc martens.
Dean takes in the rest of Castiel’s appearance. He’s wearing a pair of black skinny jeans and a thick, white turtleneck sweater. His composure leads Dean to believe that Castiel is shy.
He thinks over and over – whether he really could have said something tonight which would change her persuasion, rather than just sit and stare.
It's Benny’s instant coffee, and Dean begins to wonder how long the jar has been sitting in the store kitchen... Probably way too long.
Jessica isn’t required back at the hospital until Tuesday, so she works with the brothers to pack up the remaining boxes and furniture into the transit van. Sam gives tiny Jess a boost into the vehicle, before jumping into the driver’s seat. He and his girlfriend give Dean final thanks, and set off to Jessica’s new place – which thankfully is ground floor, so additional assistance won’t be needed for the moving-in process.
Dean swears that Sam acts like such a mother hen sometimes.
“I don’t know, Dean... I gotta’ be in tomorrow morning and -”
He groggily throws on a black leather jacket and ties his boot laces before heading out the door. He considers going straight to the Impala, but Dean thinks he’ll walk to dad’s instead; he can’t bear John getting onto him about something he’s overlooked. On one occasion, John made Dean feel guilty about forgetting which type of break fluid the car took.
Dean knows he’s supposed to close the joint for half an hour lunch, but it’s quiet as it is – so he keeps it open while eating his food at the front desk.
“-and as for Lisa... I sound like a broken record; but me and Lisa just ran our course, right? So, can we please just leave it and watch another movie?”
John exhales, as if he was holding his breath  awaiting his oldest son’s response.
“Well I suppose I better head off. Was nice meeting you, Dean-o. Until next time!” Gabriel slaps the table with his hands to push himself away from the empty bar.
Dean was grinning one of those full blown grins which nobody often saw nowadays. He was cruising down the road, Black Sabbath blaring, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. He turns right to look at his little brother.
Walking to the kitchen’s island, Dean picks up his phone and checks to see if either Castiel or Charlie have texted. Charlie has;
Dean huffs at how adamant his younger brother is, before typing out a reply;
He frowns at the next line of Dean’s bio...
emerald green-eyed man listened so intently to Castiel. He felt
Dean knows that Charlie will be disappointed if he doesn’t put any effort into his appearance – she will most likely be in cosplay after all; and so, Dean has bought a graphic T-shirt, depicting Tim Curry sitting cross-legged on a throne, dressed in his Frank N’ Furter costume. This way, Dean can sport some merch, without totally embarrassing himself.
She cuts him off, “I
He hits send and throws the phone aside.
Castiel is used to this so replies promptly, “sounds like
“Yeah, yeah. As if you’re any better example,” Dean rolls his eyes. “Besides, Cas wanted to come, didn’t ya’?” He looks to the other man for support. A seed of doubt worries its way into the pit of his stomach that Castiel may not enjoy the night, and might only be polite.
“Dean! You know nobody could be
Dean splashes his face with cold water in the staff bathroom and regains  his composure to get back to work.
The two friends stand and stare each other before both exploding into belly laughs. “Please don’t ever do any impression without consulting me first. That one was just downright painful,” Dean is wiping a laughter-tear from his eye, “so what did you do? Did you meet any attractive guys? Like more attractive than me?”
– Dean thinks to himself, placing the heavy cardboard box he was carrying at his feet.
“That was so fucking awesome, guys! Couldn’t have had a better time!” Charlie has a spring in her step as the trio exit the theatre doors, onto the city streets.
of the actors in the movies we watch 'dreamboats'... You choose these movies ‘cause you secretly want your daily dose of man crush?” She giggles again, then notices that Dean is practically the colour of a tomato. She throws a piece of popcorn at his head, “Wait a second! I was kidding – you don't actually like dudes, do you?”
Bela has light caramel coloured skin, and sandy hair which rests against her collarbone. Dean learns she works in real estate and has known Gabriel for a long time.
Striding across the road, Dean can see the building clearly. It’s obviously a church; with its steeple and stained glass windows depicting religious figures. Although, Dean immediately understands why Castiel – and he assumes many others, feel comfort here.
“Well... I enjoy instrumental pieces. Bach in particular. Any of the greats-“
“Hi, sorry. Did I frighten you?” The blue eyed man’s face is primarily blank, aside from a hint of concern at Dean’s reaction.
He’s not been eating as well as usual – not on purpose; Dean has just been so caught up in work and helping Bobby at the scrapyard, that he tends to eat quickly on the move. He groans when he puts on his Rocky Horror shirt and realises it’s hanging a little on the loose side.
He also notices an unread text message from John. It reads;
Dean has nothing to add, so he lets John continue.
– he decides and hits send.
Dean doesn’t think before his next words, “Jo, are you serious? Man’s a fucking
“Okay, okay. What does everyone want? Charlie?” Charlie and Castiel have sat down, while Dean offers to get a round of drinks.
“That’s good though, having a bond like that. I’m closest to Gabriel – you met him already; he’s 24. Then there’s Anna, she’s 25 and married to Abel... Michael is the oldest of us, he’s 27, we never were that close, he lives in Topeka, teaching English,” This is the most Dean has heard Castiel speak in one instance since they met. He’s growing familiar to the unusually gravelly voice for his age. Or however old he actually is.
Dean boasts, “good luck then, those are some pretty big boots to fill.”
Castiel doesn’t have a Facebook account for himself, but his father’s church does. He opens up the log-in page. Its Anna’s job to manage the page for Lawrence’s ‘Celestial Hope Church,' and knowing his sister pretty well; Castiel guesses the password. It’s ‘Jeremiah 31:3.’ Anna is a full believer that God’s love knows no bounds so it’s not surprising that the reference for God’s unconditional love is her password choice.
Castiel’s face lights up, as he laughs at Dean’s matter-of-fact comment.
He isn’t left in the dark for long though, because the ensemble cast have appeared from the woodwork and are singing ‘Time-Warp.’ Castiel enjoys this one; he had actually heard this song before, so he’s pleasantly surprised to discover its origins. His head is buzzing like electric static, brought on by the beer, but he’s having a fantastic time; and it appears everyone else is too. The majority of the audience are belting out the lyrics – Dean and Charlie especially. Castiel feels genuine happiness watching the duo enjoy themselves so. In fact; he can’t remember being this happy
Intermission comes, and truth be told; Castiel is thankful as he needs to pee badly. Since the boy hadn’t been to The Folly before, he’s unsure where the bathroom is, and he’s also a little dizzy so he’s not in the mood for exploring by himself. Luckily Charlie wants to go to the vending machine for a bottle of water, so she suggests she shows him on the way.
When Castiel hangs up, he can’t stop pondering ‘what if’. What if Dean Winchester
would be here,” Dean playfully responds. He’s known the girl for as long as he can remember, Ellen being a firm friend of the Winchesters, it was only natural that Dean gained a sister figure in Jo.
Jo gives Dean an even harder kick. “Bishop? Kelly Bishop?! THE FUCKING MOM??” She winces in disgust, “you’re beyond help.”
“Yeah, well... Nothing better to be doing on a Friday night when you’re single is there?” She says dismissively. “Just - don’t tell mom I was here, ‘kay? She thinks I work too much.”
“Likewise! Fuck, it’s been a while,” he’s caught up in his interaction with Charlie that he almost forgets Castiel standing directly behind him. “Oh! Charlie, this is Castiel,” Dean steps aside, allowing Charlie to greet him.
“How did it go with dad? Did you both behave?”
The man dashes to the bathroom where he keeps his clothes and throws on a plain black t shirt and jeans. He doesn’t have time for his morning (soon to be afternoon) coffee; he decides he can grab one at the record store. Dean Winchester thanks his lucky stars that Benny is still away visiting family. He just hopes none of the locals phone Benny, curious as to why the store is still closed.
“-Cas?”
He had planned on closing the store at around 4:15pm which would have given him plenty time to drive home and gussy up for his date.
Dean let’s out a frustrated groan. He really doesn’t want to talk to John – even more so after his drunken text the other day. He takes out his annoyance on Sam for meddling. He doesn’t
He thanks Sam for his concern, and again apologises for being rude to John – for Sammy being the messenger for him.
The lights begin to dim slowly until they’re submerged into darkness.
When Castiel exits the bathroom feeling a lot lighter and comfortable, Charlie is leaning against the theatre’s lobby wall; waving to get his attention. “’Ya feeling better?” she asks.
that was The Shit!”
“Well look who’s actually early for once!”
“Actually... Lisa and I broke up. The other day,” he looks past Ellen, avoiding her gaze. Truth be told, he hadn’t thought of Lisa much since the night of their breakup. He’d been more fascinated by that Castiel Novak boy.
“Okay, no way. If you wanna go as Frank N Furter then that’s on you. I’m happy being Dean Winchester, thank you very much.”
both by David Bowie,
– he thinks to himself. He brightens up at the fact that Castiel enjoyed Bowie.
Before Dean can think otherwise he blurts, “will you come back?”
“Yeah, no worries Dean-o. Oh, and another one for my lady friend!” Dean does a double take between Gabriel and the frankly
regret drinking (the last time he drank was when he was 18 years old), but he doesn’t. He touches his cheek with his fingertips, noticing that the beer must have flushed some noticeable colour into his face. He kicks himself internally for the way he smiles so softly at Dean every time he talks to him tonight. He just can’t help it; Dean is beautiful when he's excited.
As they’re walking back to Dean, Charlie asks if the show is what he expected.
Seated on a bench outside the deli; Dean chews a bacon baguette with one hand, and texts his brother in the other,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Sammy. The peace was kept, no cause for alarm.”
Dean in turn decides it’s only fair to open up to Castiel. He details his oldest memories of his mother before she passed. He touches a little on his strained relationship with John. He gushes about Sammy and how proud he is of the kid, and strains that Castiel
The brothers say their goodbyes, and Dean gets up to make a coffee. Maybe a dose of caffeine will keep the tiredness at bay.
By the time the movie is halfway through, the pair are pretty drunk and are glued to the screen.
John nods. Dean can’t help but be bitter at the fact that his father can’t think of anything else to say – he’s ran out of pointless small talk.
Switching the engine off, once he reaches his apartment in downtown Lawrence, Dean locks baby’s doors and climbs the outside stairs two at a time, to his building, a small, studio flat situated above one of the city’s smaller dental offices. A quick fumble with his keys, and Dean has let himself into his apartment. He throws his keys into the bowl by the door, shuffles his brown heavy duty boots off, and flops down onto his tattered sofa which was originally property of Ellen’s bar, ‘The Roadhouse,' before one too many cigarette butts were pressed into its black leather. Dean looks at his watch: 5:15pm, he still had an hour and fifteen minutes until his evening shift. He groans, uses his arms to lift his weight off the couch, and shuffles to the bathroom.
Dean should probably get a move on, so he makes the first move, by texting Castiel to tell him he’s on his way. Once he hits send, he scrolls back up to double-check the address, mouthing its syllables to memorize it – he did promise Sam he wouldn’t go on his phone when driving after all.
Dean is feeling lighter the day after his afternoon with Castiel. He’s had a good – even
“Ab-so-fucking-lutely! Dean, oh my
” There’s none of Gabriel’s usual jokingly tone in his words, Castiel senses –
!” Jo dramatically grabs onto Dean’s arm to emphasise this, “we also did this stupid little outdoor shooting range experience thing which was actually fun, I ain’t been out shooting since before dad...”
Oh. Oh. Dean scratches his head. He hazily remembers sending his father a text message – and not a cheerful one at that. “Look, Sammy. I’m sorry. Tell him I’m sorry. Between you and me, I had a shit time of it yesterday. Lisa left.”
“I would like to save up a little for travel though. Don’t get me wrong, I hate flying – but I think I need to get out there, ya’know? Maybe see a bit of Europe; test the waters,” Dean elaborates. Sam brightens at this, visibly curious; he can’t remember his brother ever expressing an interest in venturing outside the United States.
love life?”
Dean remarks. He decides that since he’s in a hurry already, he’ll just have to leave it and hope Lisa doesn’t notice.
appreciate it,” the girl smiles a sweet, warm smile in Dean’s direction.
This ground the boy back to reality. He opens his mouth and blurts back, “I’m not gay! I mean... I had a girlfriend, we broke up not too long ago. Not that there’s anything wrong with being...”
? Dean gives the mug one last stir before bringing it to Castiel. “Be careful, it’s hot. I’ll be right back with a chair.”
“You know, I think Johnny could do better than Baby,” Dean talks mainly to himself.
“Uh, yeah, a little! Sorry, I didn’t hear the door, have you been waiting long?” He’s getting flustered again.
“Thanks, Dean... So did you call about anything in particular?”
He starts slowly. “I know it’s okay. I mean, we’re friends with Charlie, aren’t we? I’m really not gay though, everyone has a couple of man crushes-” He doesn’t think Jo fully believes him, but she doesn’t say otherwise,
he says with a painful smile.
Suddenly Cas sat up and before standing up he stared furiously at Dean.The look on his face was quite terrifying actually.He was full of anger, and his eyes stared to swollen up again.Was he about to cry?Dean wondered.Cas got up from the bed and headed towards the door.When Dean came back to reality , he quickly grabbed Cas' wrist with more force than he intented to.Cas looked back at him with now teary eyes.
And with a gentle motion he poured the antiseptic into the wound.Cas closed his eyes tightly, and tried to hold himself back from waking Sam up with his loud cry.Dean felt sorry for him.He was an angel, a warrior of heaven, and now suffers as a human on Earth.He can't imagine the pain Cas went through.Not just physically, but emotionally too.
said Cas like he was on the verge of crying.
Dean slowly let go of Cas' wrist, and with that, Cas sat down on the left side of his bed.Dean headed to the bathroom to get the medical supplies.Some bandages, antiseptic and a needle to stich Cas' bigger wounds up.When he got back to the room,Cas was already half naked.Dean blushed a bit, but he stopped when he saw the big bloody bite mark on the left side of his abdomen.He crouched in front of Cas and examined his wounds.Some of them needed stiches, so he warned Cas that might hurt a little.
The three chat briefly about the band’s song choices before Gabriel jokes that his brother can’t shut up about Led Zeppelin at the moment.
Lisa has been unhappy for months. Dean knows this, and yet; he still can’t quite believe she’s gone. Outside of Sammy, Benny, and the Roadhouse Crew; Lisa was a constant. No matter how shitty or neglectful he could be – she was always there. There for him when it mattered. He can’t say the same for himself. He fucked it up, and there was nothing now he could do to fuse the broken threads back together. That rope had snapped.
The rest of Dean’s Sunday is relatively quiet – especially since Lisa isn’t around to ask to spend time with him on his one day off. Since he is in no mood to spend his evening cooking, Dean orders some Chinese food from downtown and channel surfs while eating.
Dean gulps anxiously, “look, dad; I believe that you believe you’ve changed. I just don’t know if I can trust you again – I know I don’t deserve to be put through any of that same old crap. Sammy doesn’t either. But I’ll give you a chance; one chance – not for you, but for
“This isn’t working,” Lisa states, no longer sounding aggravated – just exhausted.
“Fuck it, let Ash open up! He’s in all day tomorrow anyway, and he has a key. It’ll make no difference to him. Besides, he’s the reason your mom almost fell off that goddamn ladder, he owes you.”
“Dean! So great to see you! I’ve missed you, dude!” Charlie has hopped up from her chair and throws her long, scrawny arms around Dean – pecking a kiss on his cheek as she does.
Dean decides against asking about Gabriel’s brother’s namesake. Instead, the two men bond over their shared experience being older brothers, and when Gabriel has had a few more drinks – they discuss their common interest in women, and porn with terrible plotlines.
Gabriel has wondered outside to smoke – Dean registers that it smells like weed and can't believe he's related to Castiel. He turns and passes the orange record to Castiel who looks at the cover curiously, before flipping it and scowls at the track listing
“Jesus, man, gimme a second! We just talked about the usual. This doesn’t mean I’ve forgiven anything yet, Sam, okay? He let me – ‘
Sliding it out his jean back pocket, Dean checks the caller ID: Benny.
Sam is quick with his response, unease in his voice melting away into excitement, “that’s great Dean! What did I tell you? He really is trying this time – and you guys really got along? What did you talk about?”
“I’m sorry for you both, Dean. Although, to tell you the truth, it’s probably for the best. I may have only met her on a small number of occasions, but I don’t think you brought out the good in each other. There was one time you brought her here and
Dean doesn’t appear to care though, he just looks proud that his friend is sharing his enthusiasm.
Finished with his sandwich, Dean is about to tuck into that delicious looking pie when the shop door bell rings; alerting the man that someone has entered the premises.
It’s 3am on Saturday.
“Yeah, of course! Its what I’m good for. How long you got? Because the water is still hot - I can make you a cup of coffee? It’s only instant mind you.” Dean really shouldn’t offer customers drinks, he’s not in The Roadhouse, Benny would flip if he knew food and beverages were being consumed in the store front – but Benny isn’t here and
Dean chuckles and promptly texts her back, letting her know all is good, and he’ll meet her at The Folly at 6pm. The show starts at 8pm but Charlie is insistent that she meets Castiel properly beforehand, so they’ll meet her in the theatre bar. He glances at the time on his cell – it’s now 4:30pm, plenty time since it’ll only take him roughly forty minutes to drive to Kansas City.
Back to Black by Amy Winehouse – he mouths. Amy is one of Lisa’s favourite artists.
Dean shakes his dad’s hand when he leaves, and feels a weight lifted off his shoulders.
He pats Ellen on the arm before ascending the ladder, two steps at a time, “you flatter me, Ellen,” he says enthusiastically.
Dean jolts at the voice coming from next to him – Jo.
Dean laughs at this, says his goodnight to Jo and begins his shift.
Dean is taken aback by hearing his girlfriend fill the silence finally. “Sorry, Lis? Did you say something?” He hurryingly wipes his hands and mouth free of grease with a napkin and awaits her response.
Dean Winchester is running late.
“Um, yeah... Yeah, it really was something. It’s nice to actually spend some time with girl friends, and not just our ageing bar regulars and co-workers. No offence, Dean.” Jo has adjusted her posture into a more confident stance, seemingly back to her usual self.
After Dean finishes up at the record store, he repeats his usual routine of going home, having dinner, going to The Roadhouse, coming back home, and sleeping. At least tomorrow he sees Lisa.
music suggestions.”
Around 10pm, a scruffy looking man with sandy brown, floppy hair waltzes in. He orders a scotch on the rocks and since he’s the only customer currently in the premises, he sits on a stool right by the bar, hoping to spring some conversation into the barman.
He’s taken away from Robert Plant’s powerful vocal chords by the loud vibration of his cell phone. Castiel doesn’t bother to prop himself up, lazily he reaches for the device in his bed-side table, and squints at the caller ID before accepting the call.
“Late last night. I kinda swore to mom I would take the rest of the week off and pass duties onto Ash, but you know how much I miss this place!” Jo grins and puts on the most outlandish, stereotypical pirate accent, “The Roadhouse, she was calling to me!”
want seconds, Gabriel. You only met him once before I did, I’d hardly call him a friend,” he pinches his nose bridge to fight the creeping tiredness.
Sam is a little hesitant, “I know, I know... Still it’s so fucking great I don’t need to worry about you guys strangling each other to death. Means you can actually come inside the house whenever I need a ride.”
be a light drinker – if he drinks at all ever. By now,  Cas has drunk two bottles to himself, a minuscule amount by most standards –
Dean, putting his thoughts of his relationship with his father aside, jumps at this opportunity. He always loves helping his baby brother, even if it’s technically helping his student nurse girlfriend instead. “No problemo, Sammy! Next, you’ll be asking me to be best man at your wedding.”
He clenches his jaw and is met with another worried stare from Jo’s mom. So he slowly recounts the event of their evening at Cosmo’s.
“-So I told Michael; I’m not taking the job until he removes that goddamn stick out his a-“
She presses play, and the opening titles for ‘Moulin Rouge!’ begin to roll.
The two men sit side by side at the cashier’s counter. Benny would be livid if he knew Dean was letting practically a stranger behind the counter where the cash register was. Maybe Dean feels like breaking the rules a little today.
The wooden panels which make up the exterior of the structure are painted a soft lilac, with the front door baby blue in colour - unusual for a church. Dean’s eyes are drawn to the right side, on the lawn – where a sign has written in bold black lettering;
how Sam is, Dean. I hear from your father often enough. I asked how
“Not at all. I thought I’d come say thank you, for the record.”
Dean allows his grip to loosen on the Harvelle girl’s arm, letting his drop back to his side, “none taken, Jo. It’ll do you good to catch up with folk. God
“Deannnn, you promised Dirty Dancing!” Jo kicks Dean’s stomach, giggling playfully.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of Course. I just have to grab my wallet; I’ll be right back.”
Dean promptly responds with a time. He’ll get Lisa around 6pm. Maybe after dinner she’ll invite Dean to stay the night. Beats watching crappy TV at his house.
– he thinks self patronisingly.
he could sense some sort of mutual attraction between them both? Castiel shakes this thought away and turns his lamp off before getting under the covers for bed.
Dean’s words spill out before his brain catches up, “as long as it’s not alcoholic.”
“Fine, Fine! Stop finger-wagging at me!”
– Dean mutters, settling on his studio apartment sofa. He’ll remain there until bed.
Dean doesn’t mind though, he finds it adorable the way Castiel loosens up with the drink.
In fact, the more work to keep him occupied, the less time he’ll be sitting in this apartment, loneliness consuming him.
The night is drawing to a close and the band is playing their final song of the night, ‘You Can’t Always Get What You Want’ by The Rolling Stones. Dean can’t stop thinking about Castiel. He finds he’s smiling to himself while he’s drying beer glasses, picturing the other boy sitting, listening intently while the needle drags across the turntable. A warm fuzzy feeling radiates in Dean Winchester; although he doesn't know why for sure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Excellent!” The man claps his hands together, “you go pay, then we can eat.”
“That’d be great, Dean! I think it’d be good for you to take a break from Lawrence – somewhere a little less familiar.”
“Did ‘ya find something, Cassie?” He questions his brother – who raises the record in response.
“What about you, Dean? Do you have any plans to go back into education?” Jessica gently taps Dean’s elbow.
“...Dad I-“
“Yeah, felt like I needed the fresh air. It’s a nice day.”
“Yeah. We’re just not enough for each other anymore I guess,” Dean tries to hide the sadness in his words. He knows Sam means well, but he can’t have his baby brother thinking he can’t manage.
“No really, it’s okay! You’re welcome. It’s nice when someone shows interest in music I’m passionate about. My little brother’s more interested in early 2000’s stuff. Can’t be doing with that really.”
This time it’s Dean’s turn to touch Jo’s arm. He reaches over and gives it a gentle squeeze. Poor Jo, like Dean; she too lost a parent at a young age. At least Dean wasn’t old enough to completely remember the painful details of his mother’s passing – Jo was 9 years old when her father was killed in a car accident on Christmas Eve 2006. It was nobody’s fault; he was driving home from the grocery store when he lost control of the vehicle when it hit black ice. The car spun uncontrollably and crashed down a steep verge; paramedics told Ellen that he died instantly.
“Wow, so enthusiastic. Save some of that energy for church,” his older brother responds sarcastically.
“Hello, nice to meet you. You have a beautiful store.”
“Gabriel, shh! Don’t be so rude!”
Dean has somehow made it to Sunday. He and Jo didn’t fall asleep until after mid-day on Saturday, and he spent his evening shift at The Roadhouse in a state of murder. Jo – being the superhuman that she is, doesn’t get hangovers, so she spent all of Saturday ripping the shit out of Dean for wearing sunglasses.
Bela purses her lips and faces her date Gabriel, who only narrows his brows in suspicion.
“The band’s pretty good tonight, eh?”
blame Lisa. This is entirely his fault. In the beginning, whenever Dean went days without a word, Lisa was always the first to talk. She gradually did this less frequently, until eventually waiting for him instead. This resulted in Dean not calling for two weeks. Lisa was tired of Dean fluttering in and out of her life, she tried.
“Sam?!” He takes notice of his brother’s vacant expression. Or what Dean assumes is a vacant expression; the dude is facing the window.
Speaking of his room… Dean blinked, confused as he looked around. Why wasn’t he in there? He had a moment of panic before he recognized his mom’s room and the answer came as soon as he tried to sit up.
I hope everyone has enjoyed this story as much as I have, and I sincerely hope I did the ending justice. I was excited and terrified to go last, so fingers crossed I wrapped everything up well! ♥ The chapter ended up a little longer than the 2-3kish we all did, but I couldn't figure out how to tie things up in less words.  Sorry?
Cas sighed. "I know. And I made the right decision. It's just hard sometimes, to look a person in the eyes and tell them their loved one's life isn't worth as much as someone else's."
“Alright.” Dean led him down the next aisle, slowing his pace so Castiel could peruse the trees here. Sam had already filled most of the spots that had emptied from that morning, and Dean had to admit he was impressed at how well his brother functioned before coffee. Why Sam insisted that they be out here and open at eight A.M. was beyond him. But, as Dean glanced over, watching Castiel’s profile as he turned his face up towards the sun to look at the tops of the pines, eight A.M. was worth it.
The big screen that was usually used for the school ceremonies now had the word “SEX” in big letters written over it behind John who was busy doing something on the computer next to it. He appeared focused on the screen, muttering something under his breath before he turned towards the class and cleared his throat to get everyone's attention.
"Guys! Behave!" Charlie hissed at them before opening the door. "Hey, boys... what the hell are
I'm so very much sorry for keeping you all waiting! Hopefully this chapter will be worth the wait, since the wonderful lotrspnfangirl has looked it (and past chapters) over and fixed it for me. I don't know what I would do with out her.
“I apologise for the mistake. I just assumed…”
“It’s a nice little restaurant owned by a family that lives here nearby. They bought this place a year ago and have been working on turning it into a restaurant. They haven’t fully opened yet so they are keeping it low-key until they are ready. But their food is really good, trust me.”
Anyway,
They used the time while they waited for the food to get to know one another better, filling each other in on their day and stories from their childhood. It was comfortable, easy and relaxing. Dean had gone on few dates before, but they had all felt awkward and forced. This one just felt right. He and Castiel just clicked and there weren’t any awkward silence that needed to be filled.
Castiel shifted, groaning when their bare erections rubbed together. “I
Ellen rolls her eyes and elbows him. "Don't be an idiot." She winks at Cas. "Everybody knows you chop 'em up and cook 'em in the winter."
Sam gave a small laugh, shaking his head. “I cried, Dean. Here I am, hanging off my new boyfriend, crying as I told him everything about Eileen and he… he just stayed and held me and told me he could see how special she was. And that’s when I knew that I was falling in love with him.”
“Fuck me!” he begged and almost before the words left his mouth, Cas was fucking Dean at a brutal pace, hitting his prostate hard with each thrust. Dean had never been so turned on before- he couldn’t catch his breath and his hard cock slapping against his stomach was the only stimulation he was getting, yet he was sure he could come from that alone. At this point, he was sure that not even the apocalypse could force him to stop. Little
He doesn’t want to appear too eager to talk more about Cas, so he doesn’t press Gabe further about his brother.
Jo, a hard-worker, barely ever takes time off, preferring to spend most days hovering round the bar, chatting to regulars who all remember when she was too short to even sit on one of the barstools. The week-long all inclusive trip to Vegas may seem a little extravagant for a 22nd birthday gift from Ellen and Bobby who were by no means well-off, but Jo truly deserved it. She never asked for anything, and would share her school lunch with Dean when John – more often than not, forgot to pack his son one. After years of swearing she didn’t want birthday or Christmas gifts, calling them ‘
Dean laughs at Jo’s horrified face; one of his favourite hobbies is shocking the girl. He turns on the television and searches for the movie on Netflix. He’s a self-confessed movie buff and owns the 4K Blu-Ray collector’s edition of Dirty Dancing but he’ll never live it down if Jo knew that.
Dean warmly smiles back. The man isn’t shy, merely quiet and reserved.
future. I can’t sit around and wait for you, Dean – not anymore. I’m tired. I should have said something sooner, I’m sorry about the dinner.”
like that with anyone. Certainly not that fast either. Dean had even given Castiel a nickname –
“Very much, Dean,” Castiel nods thoughtfully. “Maybe we could do this more often.”
Castiel likes to move around when he’s on the phone, he doesn’t even notice he’s doing it. He closes his bedroom curtains and thumps back down onto his bed. “Well, I actually went back to the record store today, and I bought a couple more vinyl.”
“Oh. Well... It looks like a lovely place to work-“
Enjoy!
gay? Maybe the freckled boy was tripping over his words
Dean instinctively scratches the back of his neck. He often does this when he’s embarrassed or nervous. What does Dean Winchester have to be nervous about in this situation?
He finally gets round to shaking up drinks for the couple and brings them to the table they’re seated at.
I was going to hold off posting this one, at least until I finished chapter 8, but chapter 8 is almost finished and I couldn't wait any longer!
The two men arrive at The Folly a little later than Charlie; she texted him to let him know she'd be sitting in the theatre bar.
The other man smiles gently and winks, “of course, Dean. If these records are as good as the last, I’ll be back.”
“Course I find him attractive – although it’s a little suspicious you keeping tabs on the hottest men list. Hey, now I think about it, you’ve called
“Yeah, when did you get back?” Dean has shrugged his brown leather jacket off, and is now trying to find a free peg to hang it upon behind the bar.
“Ahhh, rock and progressive rock?” Dean is glad Castiel shows an interest in these genres. Most people who come in are looking for the newest releases. Not that Dean doesn’t enjoy some Taylor Swift now and then. It’s just nice to have his extensive rock knowledge come in handy once in a while.
He can’t think about the Winchester boy any more tonight, his head hurts. Castiel puts his laptop back and plunges the room into darkness before closing his eyes.
This shock appears to jolt Dean awake. He cleans up his mess from the night before, and his eyes regretfully dot around the various empty bottles around the room. He hasn’t drunk that much since he moved out of John’s. He spots an empty half bottle of vodka in the corner – he didn’t drink that too, did he?
Dean chuffs, putting away the clean glassware, “you
They walk Charlie to her car and she throws her arms around the two men; bringing them into one big embrace.
“You too, love you!”
The man laughs; if he finds the conversation awkward, he ain’t letting it show. “Actually, my family and I moved here in 2005, but we were all home-schooled and never really mingled with anyone outside the church. Having such a tight family unit your whole life can smother you; so I decided to moved to St. Louis when I was 17, stayed there until last month, doing cash in hand work here and there, ya know? Back now though... “
Dean cracks up when he realises the other man is serious, “Cas, not for nothing, but your taste buds must be shit, because this coffee is the worst. I should actually apologise for brewing you a cup.”
. The vacation was for two people, so naturally Charlie was my plus one. It was good; we went to the Natural History Museum, had a few drinks at the Bellagio – Dean that place is sooooo expensive, we spent almost a quarter of our holiday cash on one evening there, I could have
Glancing at the clock over the office door, he notes that it’s 5pm and starts closing up, humming Enter Sandman as he goes. Once he’s satisfied that the place is locked up and organised, he scribbles down a note for Garth – Dean’s colleague who works weekends, giving him duties Dean never got round to (probably due to his afternoon with Castiel on Thursday).
Gabriel can sense Dean’s blatant surprise that he’s scored such a stunning lady, and he introduces them.
Winchester! Jennifer Grey not your type?”
They deserve each other. I’m not sad – I'm fucking furious for wasting years on that piece of shit... Oh and if we’re on the topic of hard workers – you’re not any better than me, you juggle two jobs, I don’t know how you do it,” she shakes her head.
Dean tells the men to ‘wait right there’ while he checks the stockroom. He reappears, clutching David Bowie’s 1977 masterpiece, ‘Low.’
Sam quickly zips opens his schoolbag which is wedged between his feet and pulls out a folder. He take out a study timetable which is annotated to the point where there’s more black ink than white paper, and waves it comically at Dean, “and besides, I have way too much studying this weekend to even think about go out! Although, if you’re free Sunday, Dean, I could do with some help emptying Jess’ apartment? She’s moving into a new one closer to the hospital so she won’t have to pay that ridiculous bus fare.”
He knows that the relationship has been a little rocky recently, but Dean blamed that on both of their busy schedules. Him working two jobs, and her; a full time nurse. He isn’t entirely sure what his girlfriend is saying.
The tension between you too; honey it’s better this way. I think you both want different things in life.”
“Well I was trying not to be rude, but I suppose you’re right. It’s a little... off?” Castiel frowns at the mug before placing it on the desk. “I did enjoy the record you recommended, Dean. Maybe you could show me some more artists you think I’d like? Surprise me, maybe?"
Dean’s head is again filled with white noise; he thought this guy had calmed down a little on the intensity. He was wrong. “Uhhh... Sammy! He’s 18 – Sammy’s 18.”
“Yeah, we’ve always been close knit. Dad wasn’t around much when we were younger so I think I felt a lot of responsibility for him. We don’t see each other everyday like we used to though, I live on my own now, and Sam is busy with his girlfriend whenever he has a second free,” Dean realises he doesn’t discuss his personal life with anyone he doesn’t consider family.
“Gabriel,” Castiel monotonously answers.
“-and... I suppose, I was looking to get into something different. These ones look... intriguing,” Castiel glances over to where he was standing a moment ago.
Hope you like this chapter! I just adore Jo and Dean's relationship.
Dean finds it hard to mask the butterflies forming in his stomach. Having someone show interest his own passions is a new thing for him. He tries not to think about the fact that Castiel isn’t interested in the music because Dean likes it – it’s because he works in a damn music store and the dude only sees him as an employee.
I'm almost finished chapter 8, so expect that within the next week or so :).
Apologies for my grammar sometimes, I'm in the UK so some words are spelt slightly different than the US, but I try my best.
Castiel’s head cocks slightly to one side, “you have a brother? How old is he?”
Lisa gestures to herself then Dean, “-is just not working. It hasn’t for a long time and you know it too.” Her deep brown eyes connect with Dean’s finally.
Castiel is lying on his bed on Thursday evening, eyes closed, tapping his foot to the rhythm of Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway to Heaven.’ He loves this one. He likes
Another reason for Dean’s choice to walk is that if he takes a slightly longer route via a residential street; he can sneak a glimpse at Castiel’s father’s church. He couldn’t get over the glimmer in the boy’s eyes when he spoke so highly of the church. Castiel says he spent most summers there as a child, helping his family, and hosting church BBQs. It makes Dean a little bit sad – he doesn’t remember doing anything like that with his brother and father when they were younger. Sure maybe before Mary died, but Dean was only four, he barely recalls anything from before then. This could be why he wants to visit Celestial Hope Church. Dean wants to see if the place Castiel spoke so adoringly of, is all that.
According to Dean Winchester, Castiel looks amazing – like the dude scrubs up
“Dean?”
Maybe Dean just isn’t relationship material. Sam and Jo joke about his commitment issues all the time, even Jessica could tell it was on thin ice. He’s pathetic. Just like his father. He treated Mary like shit, and she
Dean thinks he’ll need a few more drinks, it’s going to be a long night.
Dean grabs a fresh glass for the man, and pours him a double – no extra charge.
Dean tells Cas that there will
It isn’t until the two are weaving through audience members that Castiel clicks what Charlie said.
His good mood is dampened by a text alert from Sam.
Ellen doesn’t look down as she acknowledges his presence, “Dean Winchester, I am
much. If his dad wants to talk, he’ll have to prove he’s changed.
He spots her and nudges the other man, “there she is.”
Dean keeps himself busy pulling pints of beer, and mixing the odd cocktail on occasion. His mood has improved again since he’s the only guy on duty. No offence to Jo, or Ash; but sometimes Dean just likes to do his own thing and get into a rhythm while he works. He can’t exactly do that when he’s yelling over music to gossip with his co-workers.
The mens' eyes stay locked on each other for a moment, until the connection is broken by the sound of Gabriel returning.
“Bela, Dean. Dean, Bela.”
Dean feels a tear prick at his eye and he promptly wipes it away. John never took Dean and Sammy to church, called it ‘a waste of time.’
Walking back to the table with a tray of drinks; Dean watches as Charlie and Castiel are engrossed in friendly chatter, he’s glad they’re getting along.
He quickly walks back to the cashier’s counter, and grabs his cell from under the desk. Bringing up Lisa’s contact, he decides to text her instead.
I've made a start on Chapter 10 so hopefully won't be long until I've posted that too.
When Castiel recognises the time, with an annoyed expression; he tells Dean he needs to go.
“Yeah, yeah, maybe I’m here so early ‘cause I heard my
Dean Winchester parks the Impala near Curiosity Records, relief washing over him that nobody is waiting outside. This is probably why he should steer clear of relationships. He could have lost his damn job because of Lisa.
He awakes to a clatter. His eyes blink open, Dean groans when he discovers he’s kicked over an almost full bottle of beer; its contents slowly creeping across the floor.
“Looking forward to it?” Dean is nudging Castiel’s right arm. They’re waiting for the stage curtains to open.
Clicking back off the profile picture, Castiel begins to read the rest of the page.
Ellen rolls her eyes. She’s as much a workaholic as her only daughter is; Jo gets that from her. Dean supposes she immersed herself into her job even more after her husband passed. Dean understands that; when he and John were at their worst, he would throw himself into various projects for Bobby – fixing cars here and there, deliveries, etc.
“Budweiser’s fine with me,” Castiel takes his first sip and winces ever so subtly. Dean notices the movement but kindly doesn’t tease him. He determines that Cas isn’t a big drinker, unlike him.
“No, Joanne! Do NOT put that on!”
Dean licks his lip when Castiel turns back to his house.
“Hi, dad.”
Dean moves further across the store, checking for empty spaces as he goes. He notices some records are out of place; picking one up he flips it around and reads the cover.
“How old are you then? You’re younger than 24 anyway.”
even stop to look at this place, it’s a very cliquey establishment – not that we’re not friendly here! Love a fresh face!”
“So, Castiel was telling me how you two met; you corrupted him, you bastard,” Charlie puts on a dramatic voice. “Dragging this poor Christian boy to a show about-” she whispers, keeping up the comedic act, “-sinners!”
Dean isn’t really a fan of the song, but he’s in high spirits so he sings along in a low voice while he takes more drink orders.
She cuts him off, “no Dean. This isn’t about work. This is about us. We are on autopilot. We’ve been together two years and you haven’t even given me a key to your apartment? You never want to discuss the future,
Dean grins then he closes the door behind him, the jokingly patronising voice belonging to Jo Harvelle; Ellen’s 22 year old daughter, who is busy cleaning down the bar and placing down fresh drink coasters.
. I was saying, I could take you down for your first beer with me? I mean I know you’re only 18 but jesus Sammy, when I was your age I had built up a tolerance enough to rival a bull.” Dean doesn’t know why he bothered asking Sam. Truthfully, he just missed how close he was with his younger brother when they were still living under the same roof, hell, Dean even missed his rancid farts and his bitchy whining about his studies. He knows the answer he’ll get from his younger brother.
“Me? Nahhh, hated school, I left that place as soon as I could legally. Besides, I love working at The Roadhouse – it’s always been like a home to me. Also my day job at Curiosity Records is going great. Benny hints at a more serious position there, perhaps managerial.” Curiosity Records is a downtown record store owned by Benny Lafitte, a rugged 32 year old man. Dean met Benny over a year ago at an after-party for an AC/DC gig, and instantly became firm friends. Benny offered Dean a permanent position at the store when Dean remarked that The Roadhouse just wasn’t paying the rent anymore.
The Winchester boy’s heart flips. He blames it on the shitty coffee’s caffeine kick.
After a painfully tense car ride, the two are seated at Cosmo’s; the reservation held long enough. Dean is two fingers of good scotch down, tucking into his calzone. His paycheck doesn’t quite allow for extravagances, but he definitely needs the whiskey tonight. Lisa is pushing pasta salad around with her fork, with a tired, absent expression. She’s barely said a word to her boyfriend since they entered the restaurant; and now she gently lays her cutlery down.
Dean clears his throat, “um... So you said you enjoy instrumental music. I don’t really follow classical, it’s not my thing, but I do know Bowie. He was
– Dean thinks. He worries that he’ll put his back out with the effort he and Sammy are putting into this.
“So, Dean,” John proceeds to slump down on the armchair opposite the sofa Dean is sitting on. “Sam told me about your girlfriend, Lisa – was her name? I’m sorry, son. Plenty more fish in the sea though.”
“Yeah, maybe, Sammy.”
Dean isn’t sure about Castiel, something about that blue eyed boy sets something in motion within Dean.
Sam tells Dean how sorry he is for the man, and perhaps he could confide in Jo. She had a rough breakup not too long ago herself.
Castiel let’s out a small laugh, “I’m 22 years old. People tend to think I’m a lot older.”
“Yeah, well... It’s a little big on me, didn’t really have time to change it for a smaller size.”
Charlie, Dean, and Castiel are finally seated slap bang in the centre of the theatre. Castiel feels that he
Jessica. Now what if Jess texts Lisa and figures out Dean forgot.
“Okay, princesses; jack and coke for you, and – sorry Cas, wasn’t sure if you’re a beer drinker, but I am, so I got us a couple of buds,” Dean lays the tray down in the centre of the table before returning to his seat.
to him being anything other than straight. Michael maybe would be a little uncomfortable - his parents on the other hand; he’s not too sure about. Castiel decides to not reply to Gabriel with a snarky comment, instead he thinks about telling him about today.
“...And I know I can’t ask you to forget what I’ve done. I’m only asking for the chance to prove to you that I’ve changed. I’ve been off the drink since 2015, the garage is doing better than ever. I just miss having my boy around – no offence to Sammy, but he doesn’t care about cars like we do.” John looks at Dean with an uncertain,
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am glad you’ve connected with someone, Cassie, I really am. It’s just –“ Gabriel again, stops. Castiel can hear his older brother exhale slowly, “-I don’t want you to get hurt.”
He turns back around and switches the lamp back on, his eyes scrunched half closed with the suddenness of bright light. He reaches under his bed for a grey case, and unzips it – pulling out his laptop.
Can’t think about his blood alcohol right now. Dean is needed at the store. The store which is supposed to be open right now.
Hand on his hip, and the other in his jean pocket, Dean squints upwards for a moment, “what are you trying to achieve anyway? Is the light faulty?”
“What, so you can thirst over Patrick Swayze? What’s in it for me?” Dean is swatting the girl’s leg away.
“Hmmmm... What’s that one actress? Kelly something.”
“Ah- you’ll love Charlie, Cas! Just be prepared to be exhausted by the end of the night with her limitless enthusiasm,” Dean jokes as he holds the door open for Castiel and follows him inside.
“Likewise - I like your shirt, very fitting,” Castiel points at Dean’s tee. He’s beginning to feel a little self-conscious about his baggy shirt; when the other boy looks so carelessly dapper. He looks down at the top, stretches the bottom of it to look at the design, and mumbles,
“I’m not sure
be more days and nights out, Castiel is great company.
He doesn’t charge Castiel for the last record (another thing he won’t be admitting to Benny). He’s very appreciative of this, and keeps thanking Dean for the ‘gift’.
Dean must have drifted off, half a pizza crust is lying – discarded on his lap. It takes him a second to waken up and process his cell phone ringing.
“Ooft, me too, you do come across older though – not that it’s a bad thing!”
He learns that although Castiel is the youngest; he was protective of Anna in their childhood years. He tells Dean about her wedding to Abel, who runs a neighbouring church choir.
“You work here too?” Gabriel points at the desk which is currently occupied by Dean’s unfinished lunch, “It’s Dean... right?”
Wolfing down his dinner, Dean manages to catch the last 15 minutes of the latest episode of ‘Doctor Sexy M.D.’ When he’s finished, he carelessly throws the plastic food container in his kitchen trash can and heads out to Ellen’s bar.
“Sounds like you two really made it an experience to remember,” Dean responded brightly, dragging Jo back from dark memories.
“Hello, Dean.”
– Dean thinks to himself.
“That’s amazing, Charlie! So fucking proud of you!” Dean can’t help but beam at the girl’s success.
Ellen had finally had enough, and decided to split the cost with Bobby on a non refundable vacation.
? – Dean looks up; the name isn’t that common, and sure enough, it’s the man from The Roadhouse, accompanied by another man with dark ‘floofy’ hair and blue eyes. Like – ridiculously piercing blue.
“Ha funny, Dean. If anything it’ll be your wedding. You’ve been seeing Lisa for what? 2 years? I bet she’s just waiting for you to get down on one knee,” Sam does a complete 180 on Dean; who is now sitting in deep thought. It’s not like Dean doesn’t love Lisa – he’s sure he does. He’s known Lisa damn near his whole life; as long as he can remember anyway. He’s just never given much thought to the idea of marriage, perhaps because of the lack of healthy relationships in his own life to look up to, “Sam, if I ever think of making an honest man outta myself, I’ll let you know.”
“Hey, thought you weren’t coming in tonight?” Dean questions in surprise. He watches as Jo opens the cash register, licks her finger and stars counting the bills.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam sighs and turns to face his older sibling, “sorry, Dean, you were saying what about Ellen?”
Okay! So this is chapter 2. I haven't written anything in god knows how many years so I'm rusty as hell. I'll try to post frequently, but please excuse me if I fall off the wagon once in a while - I'm only human!
He rubs his face with one hand – trying to stimulate some sort of awakness in it. With his other hand, he checks his watch.
Castiel is grinning ear to ear, holding his can of coke which Dean jokingly suggested was a good idea rather than more alcohol.
As soon as he finished work last night, he crashed on the sofa. He stayed there until he woke this morning at 9am. After groggily throwing on fresh clothes, Dean brews himself a strong black coffee. Slumping back down onto the couch, he hears his phone’s message tone.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean is sitting in the Impala, outside the residence of Castiel Novak. It’s a charming little townhouse, with oak coloured wood panelling, and a garden bursting with colourful blooming flowers. He turns the engine off, leaves the car, and rings the doorbell. Dean’s taken aback when the front door swings open wide.
A couple of minutes later Dean’s cell rings; it’s Sam. The man grumbles under his breath - he texted Sammy, why can’t he just text back like a normal teenager instead of phoning? He begrudgingly answers,
The brothers talk for a few more minutes before Gabriel groans about some girl trying to get through to him on another line.
Castiel’s gaze moves from the record, back to Dean’s eyes, “thank you, Dean.”
Whenever Dean brought Lisa along with him to meet his friends, it was more often than not, a painfully awkward experience. And that was with Jo, he couldn’t imagine introducing Lisa to Charlie, talk about chalk and cheese.
Charlie holds a fire-door open for Castiel at the top of the stairs, “Yeah, no; your brother is totally correct, as a lesbian myself, this gives me brownie points.”
Dean takes in Gabriel’s appearance; the man is presented a little neater than a few nights ago – his mid-length hair is combed back, and he’s wearing a black jean jacket.
Dean satisfied in his intoxicated state, hits send. If he’s blaming himself, may as well blame the maker too.
Lisa is standing by the mailbox; wearing a body-confident short, black dress which, in Dean’s mind; hugs her figure in all the right places. Her arms are folded, holding her elbows tightly. She’s obviously upset.
“Lis? Lisa?” Again, no response. Lisa is staring ahead, refusing to even sneak a glance in the man’s direction. Dean racks round his brain for what to say next.
“I’m not sure yet. He has a good taste in music though. We sat for a while at the store and he made me coffee. He told me about his family and was really quite sweet,” Castiel’s mind wonders back to earlier that day when the handsome –
Dean listens intently, he’s never been so absorbed into a conversation – maybe only with Lisa in their early months.
Dean really should have changed his relationship status, huh?
“No, I know. I only meant that your recommendation was excellent. You were right, I really enjoyed Low. I was wondering whether you had anything else you think I’d enjoy?” Castiel hasn’t stopped staring at Dean’s face, while Dean struggles to make eye contact.
Pretty boy like yourself.”
“Hey, Cas; lookin’ good.”  Dean gulps, looking the other boy up and down; he’s wearing a form-fitting black button-up shirt, accentuating Castiel’s slim, but lean figure. His sleeves are rolled up to just below the elbows – Dean can’t help but notice the soft golden skin of his forearms, and his eyes follow a raised vein from Castiel's arm, right down to his inner wrist.
Ellen Harvelle is a kind woman, but she isn’t a sap. Her gentle tone slides into something a little more stern.
The two friends are sitting on opposite sides of the sofa, legs sprawled out across each other. They’ve only been at Dean’s apartment for little over an hour, but they started drinking while locking up The Roadhouse for the night.
Dean fiddles with his glass of cola. “Yeah, Lisa. I really thought she was the one, apparently not.”
“Castiel was actually looking for inspiration, sick of the same music he’s listened to for years,” Gabriel interrupts. He looks to his brother and nods, a cue for him to explain.
(See the end of the chapter for

His heart sinks when Castiel makes the connection between the pretty boy and the girl at his side in his picture. He scrolls a little further and surely enough, there’s tagged photographs posted by Lisa Braeden, starring Dean Winchester. If Castiel had any doubt; there’s even one of them
"So, Cas, have you at least watched the movie?"
“Cas liked the Zepp record?”
Castiel hums in agreement.
day at the record store, and it’s Friday, so he just has tonight and tomorrow at The Roadhouse before his day of rest.
The blonde girl stifles tears, although Dean and Jo act like siblings, they both have difficulty expressing emotions. “Nah, fuck him. He made his bed with
“If I find a girl who’s as awesome as you are, I’ll let you know.”
No. He can’t blame Lisa. He
The search brings up only 2 or 3 profiles – the first one he’s certain is the boy from the store. He clicks on the page, and surely enough it’s him. Castiel's heart warms at the profile picture and enlarges the image. The picture is of Dean, smiling sheepishly, sitting in a bar, sitting next to a stunning dark haired girl, his arm around her. On his other side, is a younger boy, who bears some resemblance to Dean... His younger brother, Sam perhaps?
He half expects the other man to decline his offer, he’s only here for the vinyl records after all. He’s pleasantly surprised when Castiel accepts, with a request for 2 teaspoons of sugar.
“-of course, if you like Bowie, you’ll probably enjoy some Lou Reed, or even Iggy Pop... Myself, I’m more of a Led Zeppelin fan. They sure know how to paint a picture in 10 minute long songs.”
Its roughly 10 minutes later and Dean has opened the store to the public for the day. Slight hangover creeping upon him, he takes a couple Oreos from the office hoping sugar will help, and slumps down at his seat by the store counter.
“Don’t flatter me, Dean Winchester,” Castiel says lowly, but teasingly.
His eyes snap up and Gabriel Novak is smirking at him; he gives Dean a wink.
ready for a home yet. Carry on like that and you won’t have a job here,” she remarks. Ellen is used to regular taunting from the boy – she secretly loves it because it lets her know Dean is happy enough to be humourous.
We could dress up!”
“Course, yeah. Well come in! Grab a seat, do you want a drink of anything?”
By the time Janet and Brad (our protagonists in the show) have been caught in the rain and have run into a seemingly empty mansion; Castiel is engrossed in the story - he wants to know what’s so mysterious about the place.
appreciate it if you could either come in an hour earlier or stay an hour later every day – handling the behind the scenes aspects; emails and stock taking etcetera. Just until I’m back, that is.” Benny sounds exhausted, poor guy.
a type, I’m just sayin’ it’d be good for you to meet someone,” Gabriel hints.
“Are you close? I would have loved to be an older brother, but I make do being the youngest of 4,” Castiel smiles, it’s obvious to Dean that Castiel enjoys being a brother. He recognised some of himself and Sammy the other day in Castiel and Gabriel.
Expression. He doesn’t know how to respond; his dad isn’t usually one to acknowledge any of his wrongdoings.
Dean’s eyes have shifted to look at the floor, he’s peeling off the paper label from his beer bottle. He does sometimes think of guys, but he assumed most guys did? He loves women, everyone knows that about Dean. It’s just sometimes, he finds himself getting off to the odd picture of a hot guy – big deal.
Dean checks a text he received from Castiel the other day; it contains his home address. It’s only polite that Dean offered to give the other boy a ride – Cas was reluctant to admit to him that he didn’t own a car; his plan was to get the bus. Dean wouldn’t stand for that; it wouldn’t be fair, would it? Besides, Castiel is only a ten-minute drive from Dean’s apartment, he’s happy to be of assistance.
A few minutes later, the man absently fumbles some crumbled cash out of his back pocket and leaves it on top of Lisa’s. He then grabs a 24 pack of beer at the store next door before heading home.
Dean has a momentary feeling of guilt. He does mean to drop Lisa a call – but she knows he’s busy, working two jobs, and she works long shifts herself. Truth be told, their romantic relationship is practically built upon time apart. Lisa for the most part has accepted Dean’s ‘lone wolf’ persona.
Jo and Danny had been high school sweethearts, they went to prom together, graduated together, they even shared an apartment together. That is until Jo found Danny in bed with Ruby a little while ago. Dean sympathises with Jo; it’s got to be hard carrying on without who you thought was your soulmate – even if he did cheat.
Dean stands for a moment, watching as the van grows smaller in the distance, then turning left out of sight. Dean turns on his heel, back to the impala, and phones for a takeaway pizza.
It’s hours later and Dean Winchester is half-ass watching some old black and white movie from the comfort of his couch. He’s consumed more alcohol than he cares to count. Lisa has left him.
Dean scratches the back of his neck, and tells his father he’ll take a coke. His hands are beginning to feel a little clammy so he hopes the coke will cool him down. He’s surprised when John even puts it in a glass with ice –
He phones Charlie afterwards; Charlie Bradbury is one of Jo’s best friend’s, and Dean can totally see why. She’s funny, smart, and she loves all the nerdy shit Dean wouldn’t admit he loves to anybody else. Since Jo introduced them both at The Roadhouse a year ago, they occasionally meet up to embrace in nerd culture.
