“He told me a bit about the - the dream,” she admits. Howard tilts his head towards her, listening. “The man sounded like
He can’t help the tiny flare of jealousy that sprouts up inside of him at the sight regardless. As much as Steve wishes for someone like that for himself, that person isn’t around yet, and Steve’s been waiting a long time already for his soulmate, that a few more years hardly makes a difference.
Tony doesn’t need the heart monitor to tell him that the organ in question took a swan dive into his stomach. He clenches his fingers around the itchy blanket draped across his lap.
As Anthony kicks his legs idly, he reflects on the conversation he had with the doctor before his parents had gone in.
The sunset has been ripped from Steve’s vision as the snowbank approaches fast. There’s nothing but unforgiving white in front of him. As the icy air whips around him, filling the inside of the plane with bitter frostiness, a small flame of hope warms his insides. He hopes his soulmate will forgive him for leaving early.
Steve took a deep breath, held it for a few seconds, and released it slowly. Everything he and Bucky owned was in that apartment. Bucky’s letters from his sisters and Ma, an aged portrait of Steve’s parents. Bucky’s small record collection that he’d been proud of. A photograph of Steve and Bucky as kids, and another from when they had gone to Coney Island just before Pearl Harbor. Steve’s sketchbooks filled with doodles and studies of Bucky, his Ma, and Granny McDonald. Bucky’s books, with their cracked spines and dog-eared, yellowed pages. Steve’s father’s watch. His mother’s soul band.
Then, like a button being pressed inside his brain, a dozen memories flash through his mind: a skinned knee and a chocolate chip cookie in an afternoon lit kitchen, nightmares in the early cold dawn, beach-side resorts, countless vacation homes in Paris, Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and Italy. A birthday spent in the hospital with the promise to talk more in the morning.
“You know I knew this would be a long shot, Pegs,” he admits to her. He lets out a shaky laugh as he does. “Just like I knew I wasn’t supposed to get a soulmate.”
Eventually the dumb doctors move Anthony into his very own brown hospital room where they leave him. But one of them wants to talk to Aunt Peggy privately, and so she has to go.
An image flashes through his head: a red gloved hand, a gentle grip on his chin, and a pair of determined eyes looking at him.
“What isn’t?” Rhodey asks, and it’s an age-old phrase between them, but right now instead of a comfortable sweater, it feels like a worn out scrap of cloth.
“Howard,” Aunt Peggy says gently, moving closer to Anthony's father. She’s at his side, laying a hand on one of his shoulders and he immediately deflates; relaxing at the contact. “I know you cared about Steve, I did as well. I know it hurts, even after almost thirty years of him being gone. But talking about him keeps him alive despite the pain. If you talk to Tony about
“There’s a note on your chart that at the time, you had a bad reaction to the anesthesia and needed to be revived,” she replies, raising her gaze completely away from the clipboard to evaluate him.
he had asked, his startling blue eyes meeting Tony's. Crystal clear blue, with a ring of indigo on the outside, and the smallest flecks of green, his brain helpfully supplies. The knot of nervousness he felt at meeting Captain America, and the gradual ease as they became comfortable with each other.
platonic soulmates. Steve even knows that there are family members who can be soulmates, like Kelly and her father Patrick who had lived with him and his Ma in the tenement apartment.
He had no idea what time it was, nor did he particularly care. Instead, he allowed himself to take in Tony’s relaxed expression. What would he give to just stay here, in their little sanctuary, and not face another day full of this hatred. Why couldn’t those people see what a wonderful man Tony was? Why couldn’t Tony?
Tony blinked, not bothering to hide his surprise when he saw Steve staring at DUM-E with wide eyes. The bot had turned its claw in Steve’s direction, rotating it back and forth as if to wave at him.
“Listen to me: devil or not, Lucifer or not—I’ve loved you for a whole long while now,” Steve said, emphasizing every word, as if once he put all his heart, all his force, all his conviction into them, even Tony couldn’t fail to hear him.
“Oh, safe it will be,” Bucky answered with a cheeky grin and raised his shackled hands in means of a goodbye wave. Outside, the psychiatrist was steering him towards a dark van, and on the next beat, Bucky was out of sight.
Tony probably stared open-mouthed now, but he didn’t bother trying to shield his surprise. The latest changes involved a lot of stuff that would shift control from UN back to the Avengers, like an emergency veto, and jurisdiction having to take events that had led to the crime into consideration, and not just the crime itself.
Bucky’s arms tightened around her once more, and Nat murmured something unintelligible. Her head was pillowed on his chest, her right arm curved over his, and a calm look of serenity graced her sleeping face. No one had ever made him feel the way Natasha did. The way she looked at him when she thought he wasn’t looking. The way she would brush kisses against his forehead or his hand when he was distressed. The way she shared his pain without losing her fortitude.
With the Hulk’s help, every confrontation became sloppier, and though there was a sizable part of him enjoying the thrill, it was damn difficult to avoid hurting someone.
,” he said with feeling. “How is that so hard to believe? You kept loving me, for all this time, despite it all…”
This was another thing he’d never envisioned for his first time. Them sitting like this, looking at each other in broad light. But here he was, grinding himself into Tony as he struggled to find a rhythm that seemed natural. His jerky breaths betrayed his nervousness, but when he faltered, Tony didn’t frown or roll his eyes or bring any of his worst fears to life. The look on his face remained reverent, his eyes never leaving Steve’s.
The elevator dinged, and Steve held up a hand, signaling to stop all conversations—thankfully—on the matter. When they stepped out and walked around the first corner, they came face to face with a wounded and pale-looking Helen Cho. The lab around them was a mess, glass shards and destroyed lab equipment all over the floor.
Steve shook his head, then dropped it forward against Tony’s chest. He felt his own dog tags rest safely against Tony’s chest where they belonged, where he could see the outlines through his white shirt. He pressed a soft kiss against the dog tags, sighing when Tony’s arms wrapped around his body.
“Quit going defensive on my behalf, Buck,” Steve replied with a low smile. “We don’t need to spend every waking hour with each other, and I’m plenty busy without him, thank you very much. Also… accepting the fact that Tony sometimes just needs to do his own thing… that isn’t a problem for me. Never was. He does things far beyond what you or I could imagine and I would
“Freddy’s victims and their nightmares,” Natasha whispered into Clint’s ear, grinning when he jumped a little.
“I am,” Tony supplied softly. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here when it counted, but… This is real. I promise.” He moved until he grasped Steve’s fingers, moving them along Tony’s cheek. “I wouldn’t have so many worry lines if this was after-life, right?”
He let two of his fingers trail artless patterns across Steve’s chest, memorizing every inch of skin, because he had a feeling this conversation might just put an end to all of this.
They stood for a moment longer, Steve interlacing his fingers where his hands lay on the small of Tony's back, keeping him anchored. He looked at Tony, and noticed the softness of his skin, the still-wary look in his eyes. It was amazing how many little things he could see now that he was really looking. Tony looked so vulnerable. Even though he’d lost his parents recently, and had a multimillion dollar company waiting for him… he still seemed so innocent.
"Yeah," Tony replied after regaining composure. Just getting moved around like this, while Steve was very much buried in him to the hilt, was definitely... something. He let his head fall back against Steve's shoulder, almost going limp against him while brushing his nose along his cheek. "Getting manhandled might become a new kink of mine," he said, smiling, even as he pulled off of Steve's cock for just the slightest bit before moving back.
Tony rolled his eyes, and bowed his head a little, as he looked back at Steve. “Well, nice to meet you ‘Way-Too-Old-For-Me History of Art Teacher Steve Rogers’. I think we all got the memo, Brucie, thanks.”
The longer Tony seemed to be here, back in his and Indries’ home, the more he seemed to be reminded of the severity of his loss, of the love he once had but that was gone now forever. Only at night would Tony smile at him, kiss him, and Steve would remember how Tony’s body felt against his own. How it felt when Tony was just
first,” Natasha said, pointing at Clint’s leg and, right—there was a red spot on his thigh and while it was probably just a light burn, it would definitely be a handicap right now.
Nowadays, Tony didn’t need to concentrate on Extremis as much as he used to in the early days after Maya Hansen had injected him with the techno-virus. He could do most things simultaneously by now. Walking while calculating projects, having a whole conversation while building new weapons for the team, kissing Steve while inventing another revolutionary energy system.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Barnes said, then crossed the threshold. He walked towards the other end of the couch, but stopped before he sat down. “Can I?”
Tony felt his face heat. “It wasn’t exactly how I had imagined to come out to anyone. I’ve wanted to tell you for a while, I had a whole speech ready, and then you just… well, you know.”
And with that, Ultron dished out one punch after the other, ramming his fist down on Steve’s shield repeatedly. Goddammit, Ultron was strong, and this hurt like hell. Soon, Steve couldn’t raise his shield in time anymore, and agony exploded through his body when he was hit square in the left side of his abdomen. He felt something bruise deep within him and could barely stay conscious as he collapsed to the ground.
Thank you all so much for your comments and... So sorry for the delay - life's been a bit busy lately. I hope you all had a great start into 2018, the year I will probably look back on as the year 'Marvel ultimately broke my heart'. Ugh.
Tony cast her a small smile, before the phone buzzed again in his mind, causing him to visibly flinch. “What?” he snapped, answering it on the first ring.
“Look, is there a single scenario running through that handsome head of yours which features me turning you down right now?” He leaned in again, tenderly brushing his lips against Steve’s. “I’m not deluding myself that this will always be easy, I’d just... rather enjoy the moment, right now, and not worry about things that haven’t already happened. Can we… can we do that?”
“Oh. Right,” Tony agreed, and, well, there went his brain-to-mouth-filter. Great. “’s… wha’ssat about? You… don’t lie t’me. Not tha’ I’d know if you did, ‘cause I never fuckin’ do, but… don’t. You ‘rly loved tha’ guy?”
The girl pressed up against him, held him down with an outrageous amount of strength. Warm lips found his, and she ground down against him, driving his mouth open with the force of her tongue. He couldn’t help but respond; something about her seemed to awaken what little was left of his humanity, buried underneath all that programming.
“Shut it,” Bucky snapped. “Tony did what he had to and we just did the same thing.” Bucky waved off all of Clint’s objections and interruptions. “We don’t know what Ross told him. What things he asked of him. He might as well be working his ass off right now to keep things from getting worse.”
“Nothing,” Tony murmured, then seemed to realize how far-fetched that statement was. He sighed. “Everything. I don’t know.”
Tony huffed in mock-outrage. “Your father has a sarcastic way about him sometimes,” he said, brushing his thumb across the baby’s back. “It’s not very attractive.”
“No,” Tony said, palming Steve’s cock as he settled his body on top of Steve’s legs. “First, I want to get to know you all over again.”
“Major Graham is a Civil War hero,” Steve explained to Tony when he’d stopped at the name plaque at the fencing. “That’s why they named the house after him and not his father. He was actually the one who planned and built the whole building.”
Steve nodded, then pressed another, rather chaste kiss against Tony’s lips. “Thank you,” he said. He opened his mouth to say something about Obadiah Stane, about the man they’d hunted down for the better part of the last year, however, what escaped from his lips was anything but what he had planned.
Apparently, Tony had met up with Reed Richards and a few other scientists. He’d come back to the Compound two days ago, but for some reason, Steve hadn’t seen him yet.
Sharon smiled very gently at him, and then at Tony. She gave them both equally very long hugs, with a peck on the cheek each. “Thank you,” she answered. “I should say the same to you.”
“Things will change now, won’t they?” Natasha mused and Steve nodded, though he couldn’t yet fathom to what extent.
Steve had always thought that there was something effortless and liberated in the way Tony moved in the suit, and looking at him now, as he climbed those trees, Steve realized, maybe for the first time, how much of that was actually Tony—and not Iron Man.
“There weren’t even any speed boats involved. No cabanas, no tennis court… How should I know he’d hold grudges this long?”
Some vague faith in the divine had returned to him after meeting Erskine, but World War Two had changed that. He’d never tried to let it show—although most of his men probably felt the same way—but after what he’d seen, and more importantly done, he had been convinced that life was little more than a series of events connected only by the people who were affected by them.
"Shut up, Barnes," Steve retorted, finally, regretfully, pulling back. He turned to look at Tony as he did. "Lunch tomorrow?"
Love had saved them, had saved the world, and Tony knew in his heart that, despite what the Eye had once told him, their love was a weave that could never be undone again.
Steve had to bite his cheeks to keep from laughing. “Walk around the beach, you know… let our spirits flow.”
Not that Rhodey wasn’t worth her love—he damn well was—but things like that didn’t happen, right? The popular kid falling for the nerd… it just didn’t happen.
Tony had wanted to say something before he woke up, Steve was certain of it. He’d licked his lips with that tongue of his and opened his mouth to speak…
“You didn’t hurt anybody, but you and Wanda both still get so caught up in the fight, that you don’t think about anyone or anything around you.” When it appeared as though they were going to protest, Steve held up a hand to cut them off. “I’m not passing judgment. I’m simply stating a fact. It’s something you’ll grow into eventually, and I’ll check on your progress in a month when I’ll take over training again. Now, if you want to continue, you’re more than welcome to do so.”
He knew that Scott did have a little daughter he cared dearly for, and Steve refused to bring him into a situation he hadn’t willingly agreed to.
Steve watched as Happy met Rhodey’s eyes, barely holding in his grin. “Such delicate words, darling.”
to bring you back. So don’t you dare dismissing that, Buck-o, because then you and I, we’re gonna have a problem.”
Steve groaned in pain, and there was the screeching sound of some knife making contact with the shield.
That was a disaster waiting to happen, Tony thought idly, but he couldn’t just let him sit here, either.
Rhodey snorted, though Tony was not finding anything about this funny. “You never even told me what happened between the two of you. You guys were inseparable; you even helped him with his physics project all the time. And seriously, Tony, Steve’s one of the nicest guys in school, what could he have possibly done to make you so angry?”
Tony was halfway through reciting every good reason not to go outside right now for the third time, when he eventually gave up, grabbed his jeans, and quietly walked to the exit door.
“You know,” Bucky said, suddenly feeling bold, “things were a lot easier when all I had to do was kill you.”
This was going to be good, he thought, smiling at the blueprint. Too expensive for mass production, but that was something he could work on later. For now, the functionality was all that mattered, and this… would be
Clint’s mouth opened, closed, and opened again. He didn’t try to look behind the door, and instead turned sideways, and nodded. “Gotcha. Hi, Nat.”
“Wait,” Tony said then, stopping Steve with a gentle press to his shoulders. “I don’t think we should be doing this.”
“I thought I could escape her,” he told Steve. “I thought if I gave you a room far away from hers we’d have our peace. But I was wrong. Every time I fall asleep, she’s there with me. Telling me how you’ll hate me… how you could never…”
A long sigh hissed through Tony’s lips. True to his word, Steve had settled down in the stupid tent, as soon as they’d reached the campgrounds. And now, several minutes later, the lights were already out, with Steve very much not sleeping in the RV.
happened? Why did Stane hold so much power over Tony? And would he truly do whatever Stane told him to?
,” Pepper said, grinning broadly. “I kept trying to pry information from Tony, but he insisted that I come up and meet you myself.”
He stopped in the doorway of the boathouse and the scene in front of him all but broke his heart. Tony looked hollow from where he sat on the floor next to one of the sailboats. As if he was slipping away from this world completely. It took a few agonizingly long seconds before he raised his gaze to Steve.
How much had changed in those weeks? Steve honestly didn’t know. With SHIELD being declared a terrorist organization, the structures of their allies had to be lying in shambles. There would be the next row of villains in the world, and they were the Avengers, and that made them a beacon for all kinds of new pain and suffering.
Tony hummed in understanding, and the next thing Steve knew, he had wrapped a slick hand around the both of them. Tony put his weight on one elbow and looked down at their cocks, thrusting against Steve’s—and the friction was unbearably good.
That… was definitely not like him. Why care what Steve thought of him anyway? Bracing himself, Tony turned around fully and cast Steve an easy smile. “Jup,” he answered. “You know me, give me something to rack my brains over and I’m one happy person.”
Tony blew out a breath, shifting his hair away from his eyes as he let himself fall back in his chair. That had gone well.
“Geez, thanks,” he said in return. He was leaning against the ceiling high windows, staring out into the jungle, his eyes trailing over the giant panther statue. It was midday, which meant it was sometime around three a.m. in New York.
With that, Tony packed his things and walked out of the room. It was Friday, so the UN headquarter was fairly deserted by now. Only a few rooms were still occupied.
In the face of Steve’s impatience, Tony grinned in spite of himself and let his hands wander beneath Steve’s shirt. Following a thought, he pinched his nipples.
“Two months? And you were together the whole time?” Rhodey asked, his tone veering on the edge to threatening. As he spoke, his eyes were on Steve, and only then, he looked at Tony, who had a hand over his eyes, as if fighting off a headache.
Steve’s arms were locked around Tony like a vice, the HUD’s data making it clear that Tony would need to put a really huge amount of power into his repulsors to get away.
Tony laughed. “Oh, I can relate. Imagine my difficulty believing I’m a dad. It’s a whole new world for us, isn’t it, darling?” he asked the sleeping baby in his arms. “You’re the boss now, gotta tell us where to go.”
Everything stopped. It just stopped and Steve realized the explosion was contained in some sort of bubble. He stared over his shoulder and saw Wanda shaking with the strain of keeping the fire under control.
Tony's breathing was shallow already, coming in quick little bursts that caressed Steve's face. He didn't try to stop Tony's hand from moving, and while he appreciated the kid's restraints, he found it weirdly frustrating.
“Shit,” Steve cursed, and now, they really had no other choice than to fight their way out. He saw the consequences of any action against federal police forces trickle down before his eyes, but there was nothing he could do about it.
A sigh of relief coursed off Tony’s shoulder, his smile broadening as Steve took the information in stride and just went on with his agenda. At one point, he’d tell him of those first years at MIT, his parents, and all of the other shit he’d gone through, but not now.
Steve turned around at that, putting the razor down at last. Half of his face was already done, and he finally started to look like the Steve Tony remembered—not that weary, unkempt and strangely bearded guy that had arrived in the morning, here, at Tony’s very last safe house.
A spike of grief, sharp and honed like a knife, rips through his heart, making a sob tear itself from his throat. Tony lowers his forehead onto the lip of the cool porcelain, squeezes his eyes tightly shut and tries to wrangle the fucker down because
“I don’t want you to go yet,” he tells her frankly. She blinks at him, her eyes wide. Anthony hastily tries to make his case. “You just got here, an’ I don’t get to see you anymore, an’ I
to get sick,” Anthony whispers sleepily to his feet, swaying forward slightly as his sense of balance becomes compromised. “I didn’t
I can blow you wherever I want to… ” He pushed one hand between them, massaging Steve through his pants. “And we can be so
Well, she was one to talk. It felt as if he was harder than he’d ever been and he let loose a heavy sigh of relief when Natasha unzipped his jeans. She leaned up slightly and seemed to almost forget her mission as he continued to pump his fingers inside her but then she opened her eyes and remembered. She slipped his cock out of his pants, smiling as she glanced down. Her hand slid upwards and she rolled her thumb over the head, swirling the tiny bead of precome around.
"Why not…" he repeated, staring at Tony in mild disbelief that he would actually ask that so plainly. "Because I love you, that’s why."
The glass-door of Tony’s workshop shut with a satisfying sound, and Tony leaned against it, sighing with relief. Unbuttoning his dress shirt, he pulled it from the waistband of his pants, then loosened his tie.
The low music coming from Tony’s phone ended and changed over to a song Steve recognized. His eyes widened. “Did you pick that?”
run into the guy who’d piloted Tony’s long-forgotten baby-project? “Obie told me the wings had been lost in combat.”
“I know, I know, he makes you happy. But—that thing in him? That ‘Extremis’ thing? I’ve not been around long, Steve, and I see how much space it takes up in his life. Even when he’s here, he’s also… not here. It’s weird. And you can deny it all you want, but I see how much it’s eating you up. When you came back home from that mission, you practically had to drag him inside because he wasn’t paying attention.”
He glanced over to where Sharon Carter was sitting. She wasn’t crying. Steve couldn’t see her face, but somehow, he knew she wasn’t someone to cry openly. He had talked to her a few times when he’d still lived in Washington. They had been introduced, but never went on a mission together. He’d only found out that she was Peggy’s great-niece when he’d already been back in New York. But of what Steve got to know of her she was a lovely woman who did her very best, and that was good enough for him.
Steve faltered in his next punch. The bag in front of him looked ready to tear apart, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop. He’d been in the gym for a while, though he hadn’t kept track of time.
“Thanks,” Steve said, though his heart wasn’t in it. It was a nice thought, surely, but it didn’t change the fact that Tony had fallen in love with Indries—and not with Steve. “And how… how’d she die?”
Suddenly, Tony’s hands clamped hard around his forearms and his mouth was pressed against Steve’s. And that was it. The last part of him clinging to sanity died.
Damn it all, he really should’ve told Steve as soon as he’d gotten notice of the Accords. It hadn’t been fair to keep this from him for so much as an hour, and yet… He guessed he’d been too afraid to take this step, because…
Banner took his glasses off his nose and looked down at some sort of chart. “Mmm,” he hummed, furrowing his brows.
, Tony loved the knowledge that he was the only one who got to see this side of Steve. He wanted to mark his perfect skin, etch himself so deep into Steve’s bones he’d never get him out again.
Steve had to laugh. “Maybe I love seeing you squirm with need,” he said, pressing forward again. Lifting Tony’s hips slightly, he pushed himself into the tight warmth. “Here we go,” he breathed, beginning to slide in and out.
And that he cared for Steve—that his future self, four years from now would still care about Steve—wasn’t much of a surprise either.
he had gotten it right this time. The test runs had worked perfectly. But when Obi had asked DUM-E to so much as open his claw, he had only made that pathetic shivery movement to the side, then nothing for the rest of the half hour. It was as if he had decided he hadn’t liked Obi and just…
Steve smiled, ignoring the condescending look Stane cast him. He stood right next to Tony, as always looming right over him.
Steve’s eyes fluttered shut and his hand found Tony’s. “You’re a genius, I’m sure you can put two and two together.”
With Ian in his arms, he walked over to Tony and leaned down, pulling him into a soft, indulgent kiss. They both started laughing when Ian’s hands once more pressed against their faces, squishing their cheeks.
The irony wasn’t lost on Tony, that there were already rumors about the UN working on a certain document, a bill to finally keep superheroes in check.
“That… well, that we’re sharing dreams. Or that… it’s real?” He bit his lower lip uncertainly. “I mean, obviously not real-real, because I’m definitely sleeping on a tiny cot right now. And you’re… wherever you are.”
Everyone set into motion, and Tony rushed through an inner debate with himself before he said, “Rumlow’s got a bomb, guys. Strapped around his torso. Beware of that.”
Steve didn’t know if he was looking forward to that. If Howard’s son had spent so much money on finding him, he might have expectations, and Steve just… He had no idea what to think; how to feel about all of it. But he wasn’t ready to pledge himself to yet another case.
Tony had a feeling that ‘well done’ wasn’t exactly what was going through Obi’s mind, but tonight, he decided not to think about that too much. After Tony had basically shut down weapon’s production the day he’d taken over as CEO, his relationship with Obi had turned… well, a freezing iciness of Antarctic proportions probably summed it up just fine. Whenever Obi had been involved in one of Tony’s project, they’d butt heads over it so bad they wouldn’t talk for weeks. It had taken Tony a good long while to finally man up and go through with firing him, but he didn’t regret it. Obi had gotten an obscene amount of money for leaving the company without causing too much public stirrup. He’d accepted, hadn’t even thrown a fit as Tony had expected him to do, and they’d parted ways.
“Quitter?” Tony echoed with a raised eyebrow, his tone scandalized. “I’m not a quitter. Just because I won’t take
“It can’t fly anymore,” Cooper whispered with a note of infinite sadness in his voice. “’s not just the wing, the engine’s broken, too.”
like him. I should’ve realized it’s you.” His eyes wandered over Steve’s face and he kept shaking his head.
Thor was still standing in the center of the room, and the sofas were mostly occupied by the rest of their team, but no one commented on the delay, even though Natasha did give Steve a knowing look, which he pointedly ignored.
. With every plunge, every parry, and the incoherent murmurings that tumbled from Tony’s throat, he felt himself falling into bliss just a little bit faster.
It took a while for Tony get comfortable, but he was a good driver, after all. Steve’s mind started drifting off and eventually, even Coca-Cola didn’t keep him from getting sleepy. “Should be there soon, right?” he mumbled, and Tony hummed in agreement. He sounded entirely too cheerful. Then, he blinked.
But Steve only looked up at him—numb but not unmoved. And Tony knew by the way his mouth fell open, closed, opened again: Something was very wrong.
“Can we talk about the fact that Tony just said ‘chatter’?” Clint asked and Steve saw him sprinting across the clearing while firing arrows right into the second huge tank in the middle, effectively killing its whole weaponry.
“Right,” Tony said, his mood immediately brightening. They both plopped down on the bar stools at the kitchen counter, and Steve bounced Ian on his knee. “Well, for one, I’m going to cook you the world’s most amazing Thanksgiving menu. Pepper taught me, and I practiced, and no, you don’t get a say in it. And second, well…” He looked at Ian, pressing a quick kiss on his rosy cheek as he took him out of Steve’s arms. “You wanna show papa?”
Tony’s mouth pressed into a thin line. He had a hand at his temple, rubbing circles into his skin to lessen the pain. “You realize that all you’re doing is putting a Band-Aid over the problem. Everyone has to face their demons at one point.”
It was almost peaceful now—everyone was likely preparing for the visitors—and the dread Steve had often felt when he walked past the many portraits on the wall was merely a faint echo. The mansion was just that: a mansion. Nothing haunted about it.
“What happened?” Steve asked with a lost and very confused expression etched on his face now. His eyes flew over their forms, obviously checking for injuries, for blood, and coming up empty.
He stared down on the city, his thoughts mingling with memories. Though he had watched the sun rise and set over New York many times by now, the city rarely looked this peaceful. And Steve doubted that he would ever tire of the sight. Peeks of light decorating the many New Yorker skyscrapers, pouring golden drops across the tower that he had come to know as home.
“It was fine, but I have a small concern or two that you might be able to help with. You mind pulling up that roster for this year’s testing?”
“I’m a little confused with the congruent triangles thing. I understand the proportion part and how to draw them on a graph, but I get caught in the angles aspect.”
“Don’t mind at all. Just take a deep breath. If you’re feeling tense about it after dinner, I’ll help you find a distraction.”
“Of course. You taught me a lot about myself that night. It felt like you were making me unlearn everything about sex and opening my eyes to something more…intimate and raw.”
, since the overachiever’s kisses leave a lasting imprint on his lips while he enunciates his words to make sure his students say them right. Tony, across the hall during 7th Period, can see his husband licking his lips, as if his saliva will keep Tony’s assault on his own mouth alive and present. More often than not, Tony can see the erection Steve tries to hide behind the counter island in the front of the room.
“I thought you had an accident, like slipped and fell or something. Then I heard you call out for me but then it started to sound like you weren’t in need of urgent assistance. Especially not when I opened the door.”
The student pulls out a TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator out his backpack before he sits next to Tony. He takes notice of the student’s initials etched on the covering.
“Ugh, you know I like getting those reward points, no matter how rigged I think that whole system is.”
“Deal. You’ve stretched enough, Stevie. It’s my turn to be stretched,” Tony remarks as he pats his own thigh, still tapping and scrolling through his phone with his other hand.
“Don’t change the subject, Tony. Although, if you have a problem, you can always come to meet me over in HR.”
“Yeah, just lemme finish entering these grades on my spreadsheet,” he answers, typing in a series keyboard commands along with a series of numbers, “grab my tablet please.”
“Let me see?” He asks and she hands the paper to him. He sees a silhouette of a crossbow at the top right of the worksheet and chuckles. “Okay, so–”
“I just want to feel you before you make whatever remnants of functionality I have left turn to mush.”
It was a quick motion. Steve has somewhat moved them further up the bed so that he was sitting, angled on the headboard. He had taken control of Tony’s hips, moving them in ways that Tony himself couldn’t.
to an agreement,” Steve mentions calmly. He sits up and takes their dirty plates, forks, and cups. He gives Tony a wink before heading to the kitchen sink.
“It’s okay, love.” Steve’s voice gets closer, until his lips rest on Tony’s cheek. “I’ll grab them after I get the shower situated.”
“Oh Steven, how chaste you are. Here I thought you wanted to negotiate your way into a little rubdown…or was that me?”
If that were to happen, Tony would definitely sneak pics of him, and he’s pretty sure a lot of the students would do so as well. Maybe not, though. Steve would probably confiscate everyone’s phones right when they walked through the door to prevent a lawsuit of public indecency against him. Tony would be willing to settle.
“What the hell, Steve? No Captain Modesty anymore? What kind of enabling, super strength Viagra did you take this morning? ”
Steven was more than that. Tony didn’t know how to describe it well, but he was more than what Tony would label as a soulmate or match made in heaven. He knew whatever deities there were wouldn’t allow him up there, not with the things he had planned to do with his husband if he went along with it.
“At least your shirt? You know I love playing with your tits,” Tony winked, making his husband shake his head in playful disbelief while trying to hide his blushing fit of embarrassment.
“I had a juice cocktail before I ran, which may have increased my blood flow. You know I like my strawberries, but you’re my favorite one.”
“I don’t know if I picked the right one from the stockpile in the bathroom. We have so many. I may have to switch it out…”
Both of their breaks last for two consecutive class periods. Steve’s break is during 5th and 6th Period, Tony’s is 6th and 7th. They spend their overlapping time together— ranging on a scale of contactless flirting to getting walked in on while fondling each other’s bodies in creative and calculated methods —and then staring at the other across the hall in hopes to catch a few suggestive glances from the other while busy with students.
“My plants don’t deserve your unnecessary comparison in sexualization, Anthony,” the multilingual chuckled.
“Do you really want me to keep explaining all of this? You don't have to sound excited about it if you’re really not into it.”
“What– that is so random! How do you go from shaming my ankle socks to now wanting to give me head?”
Tony knew Steve was a big guy in general: tall with big broad shoulders, bulky arms, lengthy legs, and thick meaty thighs.
“Gonna need a bigger size for that to happen. Not everyone has precious Cinderella feet like you do, and I know all too well how much you love your kink socks.”
Tony catches on to Steve’s feigned disinterest and tries to coax him out of his little play by playing along with him.
“Can you put the syrup on top of the whipped cream? I like those little topographical cream mountains you make.”
That wasn’t a problem for Tony, though. When their breaks overlap, one would go into the other’s room and sneak heated kisses. Or they would check to see if any of the nearby department offices were empty so they could make out there.
Tony gives in to Steve’s request, more a demand, crawling up the bed until met with Steve at eye level.
“Well, I don’t have any smartass remarks to give you. I’m spent. Now, where were we before this negotiation?”
“Uh, yeah. That sounds about right. I think maybe you should check your account when you get the chance, just to be cautious, ya know?”
socks,” Tony protests, pushing Steve off of him. Steve just rolls over and lays on his back as he laughs.
All he knew right now was how glorious Steve looked on the bed against the headboard, looking down at Tony, who’s making his cock disappear and reappear with his mouth
“Of course, Beefcake,” Tony coos, standing on the tips of his toes to give the taller man’s forehead a kiss, “I gotta get back to Karmen.”
“You were a hemisphere away, with the only other copy of the key. I didn’t think anyone was going to come in and watch me masturbate in the shower. It’s pretty common.”
The passing time in between 5th and 6th Period was over, and the bell rang. Students were no longer roaming in the hallways. Tony walked out of his classroom and into the hallway closing his door, then headed straight into Steve’s.
“Don’t use my quotes against me,” the blond scoffed lightly before searching for Tony’s personal tablet in his bag. He walked back over to Tony, tablet in one hand and a stray chair in the other to sit next to him with.
If the lights were still on, Steve would have been able to see the rush of heat forming in Tony’s cheeks from a distance.
“Hey look, it’s Mr. Stark!” One student, Wendy, blurts out and the room goes quiet for a sudden moment.
Steve grabs a handful of Tony’s ass with one hand and caresses his back with the other, while Tony’s tongue is attentively exploring Steve’s coffee-stained mouth, much to both of their satisfaction.
They pull away from each other for a breather, peppering each other’s faces and necks with sweet kisses, delicate and sloppy alike. Tony pulls Steve closer to him so that their bodies touch, feeling the presence of Steve’s growing erection, which only starts to make Tony’s physical arousal known as well.
Now temporarily alone, Tony peels the rest of his clothes off, save for his socks. Not only for circulation of blood flow, Tony’s feet are his most non-sexual erogenous zones. Keeping his socks on is also for added pleasure when Steve fondles with his feet.
“Whichever end you choose, Cariño,” Steve replied with a kiss. That kiss turned into another, then two more, and lots more following.
Steve reached over for Tony’s phone, the motion of his wrist making the screen come alive. It was a quarter after eleven, but all Steve was focused on was Tony’s lock screen. It was an impromptu shot of Steve eating a salad, licking the dressing off of a fork. He knew Tony’s hobby of sneaking pics like that, especially of his ass.
“Um, well, it wasn’t exactly porn, necessarily. I kept a note on my phone about the place that I found my card was used at. Still don’t know how someone tapped into it but at least we got that fixed.”
“Excuse me, Karmen,” he comments, locking his computer screen before rising from his seat. He follows Steve into the hallway.
“Steve, one more minute. My– ew! You’re gross! Get off!” Tony protests, fake puking as Steve picks him up over his shoulder.
In place of the vacancy, the halls would be filled with noises: teachers making sure the students in the backs of their classrooms could hear them; the audio levels of videos loud enough to produce a faint echo in the staircase area; and the quiet
“You and your schoolgirl socks,” Steve sighs playfully as he runs a hand down Tony’s leg. He finds the hem of Tony's sock and pulls it up until it reaches the top of his husband’s shin all the way around.
“That’s not always true,” Steve said, twisting his fingers together. “Sometimes… well it just depends on your point of view. You shouldn’t assume…”
,” Tony whined. “We’ve been talking about this moment for over ten goddamn years! I mean, if it were just Carol, I might… I don’t know, I’d still not like it, but I’d understand. But Steve and the whole gang?
Desperate, Steve reached into his utility belt and pulled out Tony’s small screwdriver. The one with the Hotrod-red handle he had carried around with him ever since he and Tony had met. With a kiss to the handle, he pressed it into Tony’s hand. “I’ll come back,” he promised. “And we’ll fix this.”
Undoubtedly, all roads led to Hopkinsville that day. Steve had known the eclipse hype had become really big in those last weeks. The eclipse-sunglasses had been sold-out more times than he could count, there had been numerous specials on TV, interviews, discussions, t-shirts, books—the eclipse had been everywhere.
Taking a first—heavenly—sip from the coffee, Tony walked up behind Steve, leaning up a bit to put his chin on Steve’s shoulder.
When he opened his mouth to speak, he was astonished at how guttural his voice sounded. Raw. Like dry leaves dancing together in a late autumn wind. “Friday,” he said. “Is Pepper…”
Tony had a moment to stare into Steve’s horrified eyes, and he knew something was different before he felt it. Then, he cried out in pain, clutching at his own head that felt like imploding in on itself. His vision came and went, and he felt himself shaking on the floor and scream out his pain. Somewhere inside him, Extremis switched to autopilot, pulling up every firewall that protected him of whatever Ultron tried to unleash upon him, as the rest of him bowed under some of the worst pain he had ever thought to encounter.
“James Barnes stays,” Steve said. Something in either his tone or his expression now seemed to give his emotions away and Ross flinched. “He’s officially a member of this team. So it’s his business just as much as it is ours.”
Sam shrugged. “We figured you wouldn’t want to stay here, after everything’s said and done. And we’ll go where you go.”
Shortly after, one by one, everyone drifted back into the conference room. Even Pepper had joined them. She sat opposite Rhodey, her long limbs folded into an uncomfortable looking shape, her head was tilted back against the wall and her eyes were full of worry whenever Tony glanced at her.
Which would’ve been fine, had he been home alone. The problem was, now that he and Tony had finally settled their fight, Tony was always looking at him. Always staring. And Steve couldn’t think at all.
It was one thing, to co-exist next to each other as best as they could, trying to be friendly, but Steve figured it was another thing entirely for Tony to actually agree to spending time with him.
Tony’s jaw twitched. “There should be a door around there somewhere,” he said, pointing with the light of the Iron Man gauntlet to the far wall. “We can take the stairs down to the basement.”
Rhodey took a deep breath, raised his hand, and rattled the list off his fingers, “You know that Car and Nat are practically inseparable. And Car told Nat, and Nat’s Bucky’s girlfriend, so of course he knows, and Bucky told Steve who told Sam—and now they’re all just, you know, really excited…”
Tony hummed in agreement, looking up at Barnes’ vitals. As expected, everything seemed to be stable enough. They were close now—closer than ever before. “And those fake memories will fade once we deactivate them?”
Tony stretched his poor old limbs, then squatted down in front of his jacket that he’d carelessly thrown to the ground. After fishing out a small paper card, he turned it back and forth for a handful of times, gauging the best way to do this.
“Yes. Soon as I activated the code, you went offline, and Ultron never resurfaced. I’m… so sorry it had to come to this.”
“Even so,” Natasha said, “we have a lead, which is more than I can say for where we stood a few hours ago.” She sighed. “Tony, you know Steve better than anyone. He’s onto something, and we’re too busy with the Accords to see it. Whatever it is, we have to help him.”
It took all of his willpower to turn around and walk away. The sight of Tony so relaxed and sensual followed him all the way to the meadow, and all of Steve’s concentration went to his groin as he tried to will his erection and the images of Tony away.
Steve opened his mouth and shut it again a moment later. Tony was right. He wasn’t okay. “Did you call the Maria Stark Founda—”
There was every chance he’d regret this in the morning. Every chance that they’d be back to square one. He had to savor this, had to make use of what he had, had to…
was the one who—” He shook his head. “—who killed them. And by then you’d visited me in the hospital, you’d taken me back home to the tower. You gave me back my shield. We’d started to spend time more together and… you were as relaxed and as friendly as you’d ever been and… Tony, I—this isn’t an excuse, not in the slightest, but I just… I was selfish, and I didn’t want to see you hurt. I
There was a flicker on the monitor where Zola’s face had been. It blacked out completely, and then, only a few seconds later, Tony’s flat, robotic Extremis-voice echoed across the space like Zola’s had done moments ago. “He wrote an algorithm. Clever, gotta give him that. It’s directly linked to Project Insight.”
Tony huffed, ignoring how his insides clenched painfully at the thought. “Much as I’d love to take credit for that, I assure you it wasn’t about me.”
There was a shadow on Tony’s face, a shadow of the most potent sorrow Steve had ever seen. He drew back his hands, tightening them to fists at his sight. “Steve…” he started, voice trembling in a matter that Steve never heard from him before. “I
It was a bit crazy, how much he loved the little bundle—and how that kind of love completely changed who you were. There were all these soft wisps of brown hair, and even softer blue eyes… and his son was
“And maybe tomorrow," he whispered against Steve's lips, overcome with love but somehow not caring very much, "we can dare the universe again and try for that dinner, huh?”
"Okay," he spoke up. "This meeting is clearly not going anywhere. I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired. Let's go over the rest of the debrief some other time."
Steve’s hands cupped Tony face and he pushed his tongue forward just a little. Tony moaned against him and all but threw his arms around his neck. God, how he had wanted this. Relief clashed in an explosion of sensory—Tony’s mouth, weaving his fingers through his soft hair, pressing his body against the hardness that met his stomach. And he was swallowing every single one of Tony’s murmurs and moans and made them his own.
“If you aren’t careful, you’ll have to give all of them autographs,” Natasha told him, leaning a bit closer.
He’d never tell anyone how much he still felt like he should be standing or sitting a little bit straighter whenever Steve was around.
“I didn’t think it’d feel like this,” Tony mumbled into the air, voice hoarse, his hands sliding under Steve’s shoulders. “Didn’t think it could feel this good.”
give the sliver of a thought. It was two hours after Ross’ departure, and they still hadn’t moved beyond arguments like ‘This won’t be happening’ and ‘We have to find a way to stop this’. There was no move for a compromise on Steve’s part, no signal that he’d let all of it sink in for a night and then see where they could go.
Tony glared at him through the mirror. He hadn’t told Rhodey about the kiss—he wasn’t stupid. Rhodey only had to blurt the wrong thing at the wrong time, and Steve really
you’ll talk to him. I don’t know what’s with you guys, but I won’t have Tony brooding when the eclipse starts. He has been waiting for this for all his life, so you’ll better make sure he is as happy as a toddler by then.”
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut when Steve kneeled down behind him and placed both hands on his hips. His body was so close. He felt him, his dick, but also the rough fabric of the uniform, and Tony couldn’t help but shiver.
Tony snorted as Steve pulled his hips up to shove the pillow beneath him. “God, we’re so terribly married.”
. He couldn’t have stopped himself if he wanted to. With slow, predatory steps, he stalked forward, eyes slanted and primed on the Detective. He watched as the man stiffened with surprise, his big muscled body tensing up and his hands tightening on the crowbar as a low gasp slid past his lips.
"I'm alright," he said, pulling slightly back to look at Tony's face more easily. He looked… shaken, but back to normal mostly. "Thanks for that last minute save."
He cringed inwardly as soon as the words left his mouth. That last sentence sounded too much like a demand, and he hadn’t really meant to ask for a definition, really, he just—
There was a tightening of Barnes’ jaw, but he did not offer any further reaction. Instead he turned around, ignoring Tony completely.
Sam nodded, though more to himself than in actual understanding. Then, his eyes travelled back to Tony. “And you? I didn’t know that about you either.”
He was falling, twisting as he fell. Steve caught a glimpse of a rock in the grass below him, knew absolutely that Tony was going to hit his temple on it. He flung himself at him, his arm coming around Tony’s head. They both struck the ground and Steve realized with a pained grunt that he had wrenched his shoulder getting between Tony and that rock.
“Great,” Tony murmured. He walked around the shelves, and stilled when he came face to face with a full board of beverages, including some bottles of liquor. It hadn’t been an issue in so long that Tony didn’t even feel that sudden yearning he’d once felt whenever he’d watched someone nip at a glass of wine. There was no itching in his fingers, no faster beating of his heart. He didn’t
Steve woke before dawn, slipping out of bed. Tony slept on, the look on his face peaceful. Content. A soft smile stole across Steve’s features and he reached out to smooth a stray curl of black hair.
“It’s what I know,” Steve corrected, shooting him an irritated glance. “Why is that so hard to believe?”
Tony managed to keep to his feet for a moment, while the world blurred and faded in a haze. He watched with a great deal of relief as the Quinjet ascended from the hangar’s rooftop, and rushed through the sky. The marines clearly had noticed, but there was nothing they could do at that point.
"My second question," he said then, pulling back so he could see Tony's face more clearly. "Do we have condoms and lube with us? I…" He smiled ruefully. "I wasn't expecting us to get here so soon."
He tried for a smile, a thumb tracing Steve’s fingers from where the guy still held his hands up and far away from himself. “Come on, Steve,” Tony pleaded. “Plausible deniability. Here, repeat after me: ‘I really thought he was older’.”
"I'm counting on it," Steve heard himself say before he could think better of it. It was… too much, wasn't it? He glanced briefly at Tony but couldn't quite read his reaction. He was smiling absently with the fork in his mouth, but that was all. Steve took a steadying breath then and turned to dig in. He couldn't deny that he was pretty much starving at this point.
“Guys. We’ve got more important things to do right now,” Bruce said, clasping a hand on Clint’s shoulder.
Then, Steve’s pants were off and Tony pushed both his jeans and his briefs down. Steve groaned aloud as his cock sprang free into Tony’s hands.
Behind her, Natasha and Clint filed into the room, looking a little disheveled and more than a little tired—it was probably dead of the night then, Tony really had lost track of time. Natasha only cast Barnes' form a fleeting glance. She'd been in his room a couple of times within the last days, but never actually gave him more than a moment's consideration. Tony could tell that she was guarding her reactions very carefully, but aside from that, he had no idea what was going through her head and he figured, that was exactly what she wanted.
“Your usage of petnames has reached a disturbing new level,” Rhodey said from where he was reclining on the smaller couch next to their bed. He had been staying in the facility for the better part of the last year, and Tony
Almost blindly, Tony reached out. The relief inside him was fierce and all-consuming, and some innate part of him had to touch Steve. When his hand found Steve’s shoulder, he nearly crumpled at the raw strength that coursed beneath his fingertips.
They held each other’s gazes for long moments, before Tony broke the connection. He pulled both knees towards his chest, and settled his head down on them.
A sigh rolled off Tony’s shoulders as he looked up, his eyes irrevocably drawn back to Steve. He must be on his third refill, at least, and next to him, the one armed guy was talking to some redheaded woman. And he wasn’t just talking to her, that was obvious flirting going on.
Stroking a fingertip over his wedding band, Steve looked down on it. The vibranium seemed a bit duller than usual; maybe it needed to be polished.
Tony bit out an almost hysterical laugh, struggling to keep reign over his own emotions. He stared down at the sink and shook his head. “We can never let Steve see him like that.”
With the main code—Steve could override Iron Man. He could shut down Friday. He could destroy every bit of tech Tony had ever created.
"He's a kid, what did you expect? Maturity?" Bucky huffed, taking a sip from his vodka. "Look, I get taunted about it all the time. It's not a big deal."
Tony cast him a crooked grin. “You know, for two guys who don’t really prioritize ethics, this is a fairly large dilemma.”
!” Tony hissed. “This was my room, and my privacy and you had no right—” He clenched both hands to fists and took a deep, trembling breath to calm himself. “You know, just… stop it. I don’t want to fucking talk about it.”
“You’re right,” Steve said, “thanks for pulling him out, Thor. When his signal died, I…” He trailed off, shaking his head at the memory.
“I’m sorry,” Tony said. “I should’ve… I should’ve told you. I just… There are things about me you don’t know. And it wouldn’t have been fair to you. I was selfish when I brought you here, but… I don’t deserve you.”
When Tony’s head dropped back against the wall, eyes wandering upwards until they clashed with Steve’s, Steve didn’t look away. “Can’t hide from me, here,” Tony whispered.
Try as he might, he could not wrap his dizzied mind around what the woman was talking about. The last thing he could remember, before waking up in the container, was a fast moving train, snow, and a then nothing. His fingertips pressed firmly into the armrests. He closed his eyes, trying to force the memory into the forefront of his mind. It did not work.
Steve smiled when he stepped into the room. Although Bucky’s attention seemed focused on the television, his hands were idly playing with Natasha’s hair, stroking it back from her forehead and twining her curls around the fingers of his metal hand. For Natasha’s part, she looked half-asleep, her eyes glazed and nearly shut, her gaze trained on nothing at all. If she were a cat, Steve was sure he would have been purring.
Natasha opened her mouth, but Clint talked over her, “Let it rest,” he said with a clipped voice. “You don’t know anything about what she—”
Steve regarded Tony closely. As he suspected, it seemed he hadn't exactly planned ahead when he drove up here to meet Steve, and was now getting a little insecure. Steve hurried to fill in the gap.
TS 6:43 P.M.>Srsly considering becoming super villain. Maybe if I cause some trouble I’ll finally get to see you again
“What time do you have to be in today?” Steve asked after a few minutes had ticked by. Ian was calming down, still slightly suckling but it seemed he was on the verge of falling asleep again.
Which meant that, despite Steve claiming to have married him in the future, it didn’t mean that would still be happening.
. Nat—well, I have no fucking clue what they did to Natasha, but you probably do and I’m guessing she won the worst-childhood-lottery. And
“He never did with me.” The little smile rising to her lips seemed a little bit too self-conscious for Tony’s comfort.
Natasha jumped to their side out of nowhere, and leaned down to check Tony’s body for injuries, freezing when she noticed what was probably a lot of blood soaking right through his shirt. “Stay awake, okay?” she asked softly.
She nodded, and her eyes were glassy when she spoke up again. “Ты даже не будешь помнить, что кого-то не хватает.”
An all too relieved breath. “God, yes,” Tony said and chuckled when Steve pressed him down and settled his whole body on top of him. “And what’s that now?”
“I’m not. But—as I told you, it really does take two to tango, and had I treated you differently, you might have decided that talking about it to me beforehand would’ve been a better option.”
Tony bit his lower lip, a little dazed, and honestly a little short-breathed, as he leaned up on one elbow, staring down at Steve.
He’d got rid of almost everything that reminded him of Steve. Made him negative space. Clearing away all the things that reminded Tony of what he lost.
When everyone called it night, Steve decided to take the tent again, and this time, Tony didn’t even argue. He just cast Steve a short flimsy smile, before stepping into the RV. A few minutes later, the lights were out.
Steve swallowed. Given the opportunity, he felt himself hesitating. He had a vague understanding of Nat’s training. There had been hints, and a few lines in her file, but never a word from Natasha herself. It had never been personal, before.
“Understood,” Steve said, moaning when Tony finally freed him of his pants as well and they made first contact. “See? We’ve already solved one of the problems. How hard can it be?”
Tony somehow didn’t fit into anything. With his goatee, and his extravagant suits, it almost felt as if he didn’t belong into this world at all.
“He’s a clever guy,” Tony said simply. He walked over to the bar as soon as they had arrived in the penthouse. He stared down at the bottles there for a moment, before he served himself a water, filling a second glass right after. Minutes passed, until Steve stepped up to him.
Rising with a sigh, Tony scrubbed a hand over his face. Only then, he realized that while someone had taken the helmet off, he was still inside the suit. Staring at the left gauntlet, Tony’s head was throbbing its displeasure. “Just peachy,” he lied, only briefly glancing in Natasha’s direction. Her face was mostly impassive, but he’d known her for a whole long while now, and he spotted the little things that meant she was worried as hell.
Steve paused, rubbing a hand over his forehead as he felt his cheeks heat. Yes, definitely lovers. Just—
And then they were lying there, clasped in each other’s arms, and Steve was kissing Tony over and over again, his mouth desperate on his.
He turned a little, brushing his nose against Steve’s jaw line and pressing a soft kiss on the skin there. “Sorry for that pedophile comment. He crossed a line with that one…”
“You look like you’re gonna faint,” someone said, and Steve startled. He turned around and saw Tony leaning against the doorframe.
He held her arms with one hand. If he’d still have his other arm, he would trail it down her stomach and right into her pants.
Tony swallowed, and only managed to shake himself out of his stupor when Ian reached for him with two chubby hands. He wished he could rely on a mindset like that, on such a fierce trust. But without Steve… he just didn’t see the end of the damn desert.
The other man had a booming roar of a voice that bounced off the walls. He spoke with a thick accent and Steve figured it simply was one of Stark Industries’ business partners.
Steve smiled. “No.” He guided Tony towards the door and leaned down next to a flowerpot, retrieving the key. “Come on, I’ll show you the house.”
Tony chuckled, his hand still pumping them rhythmically. “You make me sound like a blushing virgin, Rogers,” he said, and even though he said it as a joke, he
A part of him had known Fury would take this route, of course. He’d seen it in his face after New York as well as anyone. Whatever time, whatever place, faced with uncontrollable forces, humanity always tried to surround themselves with things they could control.
“Re-route everything. We’ve got one shot at this.” Tony glanced around, then added Rhodey to the Avengers’ comm-line. “Hey buddy, can you help Vision with taking out the last stray bots? We can’t let them get away, not even one.”
“It’ll get better,” he promised with a low voice, now steadily pumping his finger in and out. He felt Steve tremble around him slightly, still squeezing him a bit too tightly, but he was also gradually easing into it.
Vision hummed. “He never told you that he found out about Steve’s undercover mission back then, did he? About half a year before you found out yourself.”
“The Avengers are not part of SHIELD. This is not my area of responsibility,” Steve continued and shot Fury a meaningful glare. “And this goes both ways, Nick. Next time you send one of my team members on a mission without telling me first, I will not let it slide that easily.”
Accepting the water, Steve forced himself to ignore the pointed distance Tony had put between them. It only made sense he would be wary of Steve's reactions after last time, wasn't it? He tried to tell himself it didn't sting.
Tony watched with bated breath as Steve’s thumb brushed over the back of his hand, and he couldn’t help it. He shivered, his own forefinger moving just that tiny bit to touch Steve’s hand, watching the movement as if it might be his last one.
much. I tried getting over the part where I mourned you, but… it didn’t work out. When Bucky was in cryostasis, I… I hit a wall. Headfirst, full-speed. I sat by his side for hours, and I… talked. I told him everything. All my regrets. Not just about you, but
"I'm not gonna change my mind," he said after a thought, guessing that Tony might need to hear this. "But I want you to understand that this gap
Tony sighed as he watched Steve step into the elevator. He leaned against its door for a moment and waved a hand. “Bruce and I will start working on one of the bulbs it threw on the street, so… when you’re done, meet me down at my workshop.”
Tony snorted, and lay down next to Steve. With a raised brow to see if it was okay, he snuggled into Steve’s side, winding an arm around his upper body.
anything,” Tony intoned, and despite everything that had happened in the last twelve hours, Steve realized how much he’d missed hearing Tony’s real voice on missions instead of Extremis’. He’d gotten used to it, had learned to appreciate the slight variations that robotic voice made whenever Tony was amused or annoyed or angry, but this… this was infinitely better.
"Of course not," he said, trying to keep the statement from coming out forceful. "And you?" It was a strange thing to ask, he mused. He rarely found himself tumbling into bed with someone without being a hundred percent sure he wanted to be there.
Steve swallowed as they lifted the last pole together. He looked sideways and stared right at Tony’s face. “Look, about what happened…” he began carefully. “I just want you to know that I don’t—”
Steve rolled his eyes, though he really had a bad feeling about this. “Alright then. If you wanna spar, let’s spar.”
"That's a relief," Steve said, turning to look at Natasha and Hawkeye in turn. "Have you guys had any side effects since the fight?" And if he was hoping to hear them agree, that they had gone through similar hallucinations, he wasn't going to tell anyone. Both agents shook their heads, however, which was disappointing, but also good news.
“You still love me?” Steve asked between kisses, but Tony was unwilling to let him go long enough to answer him. He wanted to savor this. Hell, he wanted to freeze this moment. And yet, the part of him that needed to eradicate Steve’s insecurities was stronger.
His entire body felt loose and slow, and his mind a little bit lazy, if he were honest. He was incredibly warm, and the realization that he had a male body in his arms didn't jostle him at all. He remembered the previous night perfectly.
Tony followed suit with his own glasses, and his eyes were tense. His lips were pressed into a tight, straight line, the corners pointed with strain. “I liked it,” he said, as if forcing the words out.
His tongue flicked over Tony’s lips and he tilted his head and did it again before dipping inside to kiss him properly. They were moaning into one another’s mouths, digging their fingers into each other’s arms, muscles tightening, memorizing every second.
“Da-da,” Ian giggled as Tony blew a raspberry into his tummy before raising him into the air and doing a full-turn that had his son laughing in delight.
There was another lengthy pause, and Steve watched with shaking, trembling breaths how the three of them stood there, just staring at each other.
Steve let out a shuddering breath and parked the LAPD car in front of his house. Peter still seemed to be at his friend’s, and Steve was glad for it. Because while he had the urge to take his little son into his arms right now, knowing what he knew, to make sure he was safe—he also needed time to figure all of this out by himself.
Steve’s kiss was just as singular as Tony had always imagined it to be. And when Steve opened his hand, letting go of them in favor of spitting in his palm and taking hold again after, Tony threw his head back with another long groan. His weak heart was pounding so hard, he was sure it would break through his chest. He felt hot all over, his mind spiralling helplessly into a fog, and right now, he didn’t care if reason ever decided to come back to him.
Beneath him, Natasha twisted her body towards the back seat and reached into a bag, pulling out two guns, pressing them into Sam’s palm. There was no time for him to really check if they were armed and ready, but this was Natasha, so they probably were. She pulled out a few daggers, too, and pushed them into the straps of her uniform.
serious.” He pointed to some back-lights ahead of them. “That one. Here, let me take the wheel and better drop your pants, Stark.”
Her eyes stared down at him, and she seemed to have found something there that made her pause momentarily. “Tell me my name,” she ordered him with a steely voice, knife pressing down harder.
The words were hauntingly beautiful, and strangely familiar, but they were kissing again before Bucky could question their origin.
“You should bring Zemo to Secretary Ross,” Fury told Tony. “It’ll force him to take back a few statements he made.”
“You look like a thousand thoughts are running through your head,” Steve observed, tilting his head.
And now? He would just need to convince Tony that he didn’t care whether or not Tony was gay. That he would never just out a guy like that against his will. Tony was still very much in the closet; that much Steve knew for certain—as far as he could tell, not even Rhodes knew. And above that, Steve needed to let Tony know that he was his friend, no matter what had happened.
“Sorry,” she said immediately. “That was… not because he’s a guy. Trust me, that doesn’t matter to me at all.”
Steve’s mind blanked out completely. He was floating away. He didn’t—Well, Tony tasted exactly how Steve had known he would. Not that Steve had imagined Tony’s taste, but it was Tony, and he always smelled like warm metal, and mint and coffee and… this was exactly how he tasted like, too. And he kissed Steve with mild desperation and slightly too harsh movements that didn’t give Steve any room for thought.
“We reap as we sow,” Steve intoned, cupping Tony’s cheek with his left hand. “I don’t like my life without you either. It’s been all out hell.”
An answer was forming on his lips, taking Steve by surprise. He swallowed it down, and chose the second one that came to mind.
The scene with Obadiah Stane was still on replay in his mind. The cane—of course he’d have a dagger inside that cane, it only seemed fitting for a cruel man like Stane. Had he really wanted to murder Steve, or had he only tried to scare him off?
Steve’s head poked out again, and he grinned like the Cheshire Cat. “That’s exactly what it takes, yes.”
When Tony didn’t say anything, a long sigh heaved off Rhodey’s shoulders, and he was up the next minute. “I’ll get you some coffee. It’ll make the hangover more tolerable.”
Steve raised a hand in greeting. He hadn’t seen much of Rhodes during the battle, and he was glad Jim didn’t seem to be too banged up.
All of the other words between them hung thick and heavy in the air, but otherwise remained unspoken. Steve just couldn’t bring himself to tell Tony. He didn’t know how without destroying everything.
There was so much left to do. So much to accomplish. With Stark Industries, with Obi, the board. He knew he was too young to really get things in motion yet, and that meant he had to be patient, something that hadn’t exactly been his forte, so far. But with Steve at his side, well… for the first time, he felt it was safe to take a proverbial breath and analyze the hurdles set in his path. To plan for all those little obstacles, and to… change things.
There were a few photos arranged there, most of them of Steve, Jarvis, Rhodey, Bruce and Pepper, and Steve huffed in amusement when he picked up the
His voice sounded almost easy-going, but Steve could feel the way Tony’s fingers impatiently drummed against the steering wheel, and how his mouth twitched with whatever horror-scenario was currently running through his head. If he had to guess he’d say Tony was trying to reactivate Extremis by sheer force of will just so he could log into a camera at Stark Tower to see for himself if Ian was alright.
The dream had done wonders to heal his wounds, but Steve wasn’t going to be blindsided again. Stark might help find Tony, and even if Steve’s absence had very likely extinguished all feelings, he wanted nothing more than to see him again.
“I don’t know what to tell you,” Natasha retorted, something like frustration flashing within her green eyes. “I don’t know what you want to hear, or what I can say that you haven’t heard already.”
The blur of motion returned. Running, hard and fast, its movements erratic. The guy was doing his best to lose him, by darting away over the roofs, and Steve was still yards behind him.
There was a loud crowing coming from the woods, and Tony startled, the knife skidding across the surface of the wood. Steve caught its handle in a blur of super soldier speed before the razor edge of the blade could impact with Tony’s knee.
Steve eyed the Stones. “Then scatter them,” he said. “Send them through time and space, so no one can find them anymore. Not all of them—never again.”
The next morning started on an early note, and even hours later, when it was already close to noon, Steve’s thoughts kept drifting back to Tony’s rather
At the end of the day, however, Steve mostly thanked the heavens that Bucky hadn’t been thrown back into his own nightmare… That would’ve been disastrous on top of everything else.
"Like I could say no to an offer like that…" he said with a crooked smirk as he kneeled on the bed. "We can always eat after."
Eventually, Tony lifted the plane in the air, inspecting it before handing it over to Cooper. “There, better than ever.”
When Tony stepped out of the elevator, there was noise, music and laughter and a steady stream of conversation. Most parties at the tower were packed, but the common floor seemed even busier tonight.
Tony sighed. “I always knew that Extremis isn’t foolproof, so Bruce and I planned for the worst case long ago. If anything goes wrong… someone needs to handle it. I probably won’t be able to do it myself, and…” He took a deep breath, reaching for Steve’s hand. “If anyone shuts me down, it should be you.”
doesn’t see me as part of the team anymore,” Steve corrected, staring up at the two and willing them to agree. At least to this. “I won’t step down as long as you don’t want me to. And not as long as the world still needs me.”
“Hi,” he returned just as awkward, his eyes briefly flickering towards Ian, who, just as Steve had told him, had gotten real big—and apparently able to walk. When he looked back at Tony, the guy was brushing a hand through his hair, as he visibly searched for words.
There was a long beat of silence. Then Tony huffed, putting the paper down. He still felt dazed, completely off his game. This had easily been the worst hour of his life and while he loved Steve, this had been a
The grin turned softer and he looked after her for a moment, before he turned back around to finish the dishes.
Steve swallowed and didn’t know what to say. He’d almost forgotten about the day at the river, that moment of revelation when he’d seen Tony touch himself.
Vision nodded. “Yes, I understand my priority will be to take Ultron off the net and then follow your orders.”
gotten Steve’s attention. Rhodey had managed to get Carol’s, which had led to Rhodey getting to know her friends, which had somehow led to Tony not being invisible anymore. But once Steve had noticed him it was like… the sun rising, like taking a really deep breath.Steve Rogers was a kaleidoscope, who’d turned Tony’s world to colors. It was…
He couldn’t help himself, really, laughing a bit with how completely and utterly unable he was to regain control over his body. His limbs were numb, and a deep exhaustion had settled over his muscles. He was also pretty sure he was dripping Steve’s spunk on the floor, but some things just couldn’t be helped. “I think you broke me,” he admitted with another chuckle. “I never managed to come without…” He waved a hand at his lower region. “You know.”
“They’ll applaud, they’ll take my money, these things always end the same way. You need me in Lagos. Take Natasha and Clint and Thor. And you should call Sam.”
Steve sighed, shaking his head. “No. But… ever since I came back to New York… everything’s skewed. I didn’t know how to behave around you. It always felt like you didn’t want to talk.”
Steve felt sick to his bones. Was this Tony’s doing? Was he trying to keep his dead wife from leaving him?
In that second, he reached behind himself and pulled out one of the data chips, just in time before Bucky grabbed for him and pulled him over the railing.
Experience alone refused to let those words get to Steve too much. He’d been toyed with before—the Red Skull, Killian, Alexander Pierce… but something
“You might not be the man Steve knew,” she told him quietly. “But you’re also not the man HYDRA tried to make out of you. You’re you. And even if it takes some time to find out what that means… try to do it with people who care about you.”
Tony settled back against the pillow, willing away the fog that clouded his mind. He must’ve drifted off at some point, because when he opened his eyes again, Steve was sitting at his side. He was already wearing his uniform; the shield leaning against his chair. If Tony had to guess then time was probably running out on them and he wondered how long he’d been out.
By the time the thunder-lit water made its way inside the suit’s helmet, Tony’s heavy eyes conceded the battle to fatigue, and he fell into a deep blackness.
“That’s over now,” Natasha promised and when Bucky raised a brow in question, she ground down again, harder, and chuckled with satisfaction when he groaned. His groan turned into a full-out moan of ecstasy when she bit down on his jugular. He took in shallow unneeded breaths, licked his lips and craned his neck back to give her more access, lifting his hips into hers as her movements became more determined.
If Tony had anything at all to say about it, they wouldn’t be going anywhere. After a solid week of the government systematically driving him crazy about Lagos, the last thing he wanted to do on a Saturday evening was get dressed up and go to a goddamn banquet for the CIA.
Tony crooked a small grin. “Just come by the tower whenever you like. JARVIS will guide you to the top floors. You can move in, or you can just visit sometimes, it’s your call. You’re part of the team now, as far as I’m concerned, and since our leader is out of commission right now, my word’s law.”
“Interesting,” Bruce said quietly. He had one of the vials in his hands, twirling it back and forth. “Maybe we could talk to them sometime.”
“The only way,” Steve echoed, his voice carefully blank. He slowly turned to face the hangar, paused, then glanced back to Tony. “If that’s how it is.”
Steve moved upwards, lying down on top of Tony. They both moaned at the contact, bodies rubbing against each other. “We’ll see about that,” he said.
The only reaction he got was Steve furrowing his brows even more. A soft little whine of fear and frustration left his throat—a sound that sent chills all the way through Tony’s body.
Steve saw Pietro looking around the Quinjet, his eyes thoughtful as they settled on Sam. Steve hadn’t seen it himself, but Clint had told him how Sam had snatched Pietro off the ground on a last second’s notice. He’d saved his life, who in return had shoved Clint and a little boy out of the way before one of the robots could’ve killed them all.
Steve looked adorably put-out as he glanced at Tony in question. His lips were red and decidedly kiss-swollen and Tony almost leaned in again to mess him up a bit more.
. He couldn’t do this. Just hearing the words on Barnes’ lips would end up propelling all sorts of images around Tony’s mind and he really wasn’t ready to be dealing with this.
“Well, let’s just take away everything that means anything to you, Maria, and then take away your conscience, too. Then, you tell me what you’d be capable of—”
come to terms with the fact that I’m the Antichrist?” Tony said, mocking him. “Yeah, I don’t think that’s how it works.”
To his credit, Sam only stared at them for a minute. Then, he smirked, and gestured for them to walk inside. “Come on in then. Can’t say no to the Avengers, can I?”
When Tony looked around, they were alone again. Pepper and Maria had accompanied Ross outside and Natasha’s expression fell into a kind, sympathetic smile which did nothing to conceal Tony’s own worries. “Sharon has a few contacts left. Maybe she has an idea.”
“How was your talk with Wanda?” Tony asked as he walked out of the bathroom. He was naked, save only for his boxer briefs. His eyes immediately snapped to the giant television hanging on the wall across from their bed. Ian was already fast asleep in his room, and the rest of the team had settled down as well.
you,” the man replied exultantly. “A Super Soldier of my very own; I’ve been waiting so long for you.”
Steve shook his head. He couldn’t say anything. The air was cold against his skin. He was barren and exposed—virtually naked in front of Tony. Naked in ways he hadn’t been before. He’d finally unveiled the last part of himself that he’d tried to keep secret. It was his fault for falling in love with a ghost from the future, but it was also Tony’s for allowing it to happen. For making Steve believe, even reluctantly, he had reason to hope beyond dreaming.
right—they would work it out, with the UN and with Thanos and his army, and screw the rest of the world, they would have a whole future together, finally making it right.
He had half a mind to just stand up and leave again, but one glance at Steve’s completely absent expression had him linger.
With that, he exited the car, bracing himself. There was light in the foyer. If his information was correct, they’d all just returned from a mission half an hour ago.
Tony nodded, watching the movement of his hand as it skimmed down the side of Steve’s rib cage. “I know you don’t… I know you won’t come back for a while.” His Adam’s apple quivered as he swallowed hard. “But this was… this meant something to you, didn’t it?”
It took longer for Bruce and Thor to stand up, but eventually, they all shared a hug and some words of compassion. It wasn’t much—there was no strength for more—but it made Tony feel a bit lighter nonetheless.
They separate into groups and begin searching through the small town. Steve approaches a collapsed building, picking his way carefully through the blackened grass and fallen debris of plaster and brick. He can see through the building; there are no more walls left standing, and he can clearly make out a cemetery beyond the shattered remains. It dawns on Steve that this was a place of worship.
Howard says facing her, as he lifts a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose in frustration. “My kid did not die on the operating table and meet his soulmate. If he had, I would have sued that hospital so
At each blinding blue light that flashes and every whine of a Hydra weapon that’s starting up, his stomach lurches. He hopes that the Commandos will be safe, that Howard and Peggy and even Colonel Philips won’t be taken out by a blue blast of light, and that every acquaintance he was forced to make while at Fort Lehigh will make it out okay.
“Being alone,” Tony grips the blanket tightly between his hands. Then he speaks quietly, acutely aware of how late it is. “I don’t...I don’t like to be alone, and everybody left. My parents, Aunt Pegs, you, Jarvis and Ana. I didn’t
It doesn’t bother him, and out there on the front lines, it hardly matters what two soulmates do if no one’s around to pay attention.
With shaking fingers, Steve opens the flap to the envelope, pulling out the letter and unfolding it. There on the page, was the familiar elegant handwriting of Bucky’s mother.
He’s assaulted by flashes of memories: Bucky giving him his first taste of stolen beer, and afterwards rubbing his back as he threw up the stuff in an alley ten blocks from his apartment. Bucky, coming home with dawn’s light, tossing Steve his expensive medicine, despite the fact that they hadn’t been able to afford it the day before. Bucky smiling crookedly at him while Steve drew him. Bucky flirting endlessly with the girls in their neighborhood. Granny McDonald smacking him so hard upside his head, Bucky’s dark hair fell over his eyes, making Steve laugh until he received the very same treatment. Bucky and him getting into a fight over something stupid. Steve in church drawing the windows while Bucky groaned and complained at his side. The two of them sneaking into a picture show. Both of them picking through garbage for enough money to get something sweet. Bucky and him strolling down the street, coming out of a fistfight and feeling elated and high from their victory. Bucky slinging an arm across his slim shoulders and pulling Steve into his side, like he belonged right there.
It isn’t exactly normal being Markless, especially at his age. In fact, it’s a topic people just don’t talk about, given that anyone over the age of sixteen--the socially acceptable age difference between soulmates--and
Steve squeezed his eyes shut, feeling small and like he was back in Fort Lehigh all over again, with the other soldiers in Basic for company and not being able to find a moment’s peace. Suddenly the laughter and joking cut off, and Steve’s ears only met silence. Confused, Steve trained his ears and caught bits of conversation.
They didn’t even known Bucky. To them he’s just a name, a pal of Captain America’s. A character in a comic book. Not a living, breathing person who had crippling moments of self-doubt, stubborn opinions about Markless people, devotion to his sisters and mother, and unwavering loyalty to his friends.
“If your soulmate never comes around--don’t give me that look, lemme finish,” Bucky said at the face Steve made. “Promise me that if she--or he--never shows, you’ll try to build a future with Peggy?”
He has never wanted a bland, perfect person as a soulmate. Steve isn’t perfect, so how could he expect his soulmate to be? Maybe the soulmate he has won’t be what he wants, but what he
Bucky would grouse the entire time they were there, but he never left Steve’s side even when Steve reassured him that it wouldn’t matter if he went away. By the time Steve finished his sketches, Bucky would always be impressed by the results of Steve’s labor. Steve had been young, and untrained, but after a few years of visiting the different churches in Brooklyn, and sketching each glass window, each pew and altar, he developed an eye for detail and a strong desire to accurately capture the aesthetic and layout of everything he saw.
Jarvis frowns in thought, his newly released hand draped over his knee. “I’ve never heard of anyone with a Mark on their right wrist. But I imagine not.”
His hands still, and he stares at Anthony with wide eyes. He sits slowly on the edge of Anthony’s bed, and his shoulders tense up. He’s quiet for what feels like a long time.
“Tony, what happened to you?” asks the man quietly, but his lips don’t match up with the words. Tony’s eyelids feel heavy, and he wants to sink back down into sleep.
It’s only when Steve’s standing in the middle of the smoking and shattered remains of the church with the acrid smell of charred wood and human flesh in his nose, that the thought occurs to him: he’d never been very religious.
play matchmaker for me?” Bucky always asked angrily. “If I find a good gal, who doesn’t have a Mark like me--why should we
, Howard.” Aunt Peggy argues, her tone angry and arms crossed over her chest as she leans against the loveseat, her body angled towards Anthony. “Steve was good and kind -
Cap smiles warmly at him before looking up from Anthony’s face, his eyes widen in wonder and his mouth drops open slightly. Anthony knows it’s because of the toys because he feels exactly the same way whenever he sees them. Cap gets up, walking to the toy display that’s just behind Anthony. He steps aside, his eyes following Cap’s movement. His hero studies the case for a long time before he slides the glass door open with one of his red gloved hands.
At the touch, Horowitz lifts his head up from the blackened ground and looks into his companion’s face. During their conversation, Edwards has sidled closer, and is now only a few inches away from Horowitz’s face, head bent to better look into his friend’s eyes. Edwards gives Horowitz a reassuring smile, a well of warmth in his brown eyes as he murmurs something else only Horowitz can hear.
He screws his eyes tight, trying to remember the good things about Bucky. He was as close to a soul mate as Steve had ever had in this life and it hurts so goddamned much that he’s
“No,” he replies, shaking his head. “I’ve had, maybe four cigarettes in my life.” She nods and writes down his answer.
“Not my future,” he had told Schmidt. Looking down at the busted control console and the sunset ahead, Steve’s insides feel as though they’re beginning to freeze at the inevitable outcome that lies in front of him. He won’t
have yogurt and cream. Anthony frowns and crosses his arms over his chest, unhappy with his options.
. And that there’s no trace of him left. Every sign of Bucky’s life--in photographs, in Steve’s sketches, in his letters--all of it is just
what she’s capable of. She has delicately curled, greying brown hair that ends just at her shoulders, and wrapped in a burgundy pantsuit with a large teal blue suitcase in her hand.
But then again, “finest moments” are in short supply when a grieving person decides to hit a party just after coming home from the funeral of his second father. Although Tony has to give Howard
Bucky snorted. “Stevie, I’ve known you since we were nine years old. I think I’ve got a pretty good read on you by now.”
“No! Don’t!” Anthony yells, stomping his foot, but his vision doubles and he feels even warmer. “I just wanna have my party - ”
“Captain," she nodded in acknowledgement before getting right to the point. “I’m sorry to report that the city was bombed once again in the night.”
Horowitz returns his smile with a small watery one of his own. Edwards lifts a hand to wipe away the track of tears from his cheek. They stare at one another for a long moment, and time seems to slow down exponentially as Steve watches them. Then the two men lean forward at the same time, and meet each other halfway with a tender kiss.
But as he got older, and he became aware of his own sexuality, the idea of a soulmate became complicated and convoluted. He constantly wonders what his soulmate will be like, and how will his soulmate be the person suited to him anyway? Will his soulmate be the man of his dreams, resulting in a future where they’d have to live in fear and hide their love because it’s a ‘sin’? Or will his soulmate be a woman, who he is sure he would love anyway, but he would still have to spend his life lying and lusting after the opposite sex? And what would happen then, if he fell in love with someone else? A man? What then?
It’s not like he saw a lot of these kinds of moments where he grew up, anyway, in a place where a shared Mark between two people of the same sex is extremely taboo. To some people, a shared Mark means a shared bed. The only way same-sex soulmates can possibly get away with their Mark is by dismissively saying that it’s because they’ve been best friends all their lives, which in some cases is true: there
anything in what feels like ages, that he dives into it headfirst: letting the grief wash over him in waves and at last feeling its effects on his face like a waterfall.
“Oh,” Steve said. He looked quickly to his Ma, who got that faraway look in her eyes she got whenever she thought about his Da. She brushed the black band she wore over her left wrist--over her
No matter how he looks at it, in the end Steve always loses. He can’t see a solution where he and his soulmate would be happy, even in his musings. He would be uncomfortable either way.
. Not like those horrible Captain America cartoons that don’t even sound like him. We may have to accept that maybe…” she pauses to exhale a shaky breath, “maybe Steve and Anthony
Bucky had been helping the rest of the Commandos poke through the remains of the buildings, searching for any signs of life. There’s nothing left of the tiny village they were about to pass through but charred remnants of homes, a wall or two with carefully handpainted signs that gave Steve the impression that a shop had stood there once, and what was left of their place of worship.
“First you want your dick rubbed and now want to play with my so-called tits. We don’t have a lot of time here, according to your cautious calculations, so which is it going to be?”
Tony’s office was across the hall from Steve’s, his classroom is now also across the hall from Steve’s classroom. He made sure of this after he persuaded (more like blackmailed) his bosses higher up into a promotion and a room change by proposing a high-tech approach to reduce contributions to climate change.
Steve was leaning comfortably against his island, licking his lips and smirking down at his phone, scrolling slowly at his screen. Tony didn’t know exactly what it was that Steve was looking at, his best guess was pictures. Maybe those nudes Tony had sent him out of generosity a few days ago.
“Blame it all on me, why don’t you,” Tony laughs before leaning down to kiss Steve. He tries to sit back up but Steve wraps his arms around his back.
“We’ve never talked about this before. Not even during dorm days. I’m not judging, though. You like what you like. So, what kind of porn have you been watching recently?”
“Ah, right. For starters, you bring the sass everywhere you go. It’s mostly when you’re having an argument.”
“Which end?” Tony asks and Steve snorts, giggling soon afterwards. He looks up at Tony who casually smirks down at him.
He marks Tony everywhere he can with whatever method: soft kisses on his pecs, fingers teasing his nipples, bites on his shoulders. He makes sure to hit every erogenous spot he could at the moment.
The tall and wide, uncovered windows allow the moonlight to provide an ethereal shine on many parts of the bedroom walls, the floor, the bed; even Steve, who is standing on Tony’s side of the bed, slowly stroking himself in a silent but soft plea to beckon his lover over.
Tony was rubbing Steve’s nipples with his fingers, knowing Steve liked the stimulation while occupied in thought.
Steve and Tony were in bed, having their nightly dose of discussion. Tony had been wondering what Steve had wanted to say ever since being told, and now they were having a sort-of Socratic seminar about it.
Not that it mattered so much, though. Everyone, staff and students alike, knew Dr. Stark, the honors and advanced math teacher (who should technically be teaching at a college), and Mr. Rogers–Stark, the Beefy Blue-Eyed Blondie who teaches the Spanish language, are a thing. They are so much of a thing, that many students, all ranging from freshman to seniors (seniors not so much, but still) wish they weren’t wearing wedding rings, or even remotely close to dating each other, at the very least.
“Yeah yeah, but soon you’ll be on top too, Beefy. Plus, pumpkins and lemons both have seeds. Describes us perfectly.”
Had it not been for Steve’s arm around his back, Tony would’ve fallen backwards on the bed, but instead, Steve came inside him with an elongated sigh of intense pleasure. He pulled Tony close to him, their chests heaving against each other, mixing sweat and sweet caresses.
He would try to hide it by leaning over the island and slightly arching his back, for the sake of not straining his back so much and not rubbing his clothed member against the door of the island, near a door handle, which could add to a more pleasurable experience. That would definitely be a sight for Tony to see, especially when Steve already knows Tony’s shameless wandering eyes are already glued to his muscular form.
Tony practically screamed. Thick white stripes were dripping and spurting out of Tony’s length, some of it landing on his stomach, and some of it dripping onto Steve, who was now pressing in and out of him through the brunet’s orgasm as he came down from it.
“Yeah… Your arms, your back… I think you’ve even grown a little.” Tony’d smiled, then leaned in, and when he nosed at his neck, Steve realized it was true—Tony didn’t have to lean down at all anymore.
Rhodes cast Steve and apologetic look and helped him with hauling all of their backpacks and other belongings onto the second floor of the RV while the others had already settled into their seats. The RV itself was exactly the grandiose vehicle that Steve had envisioned from going on a road trip sponsored by Howard Stark. It was pompous, all red-and-gold interior, and only contained state of the art tech, LED TVs, leather seats and porcelain floor tiles. There were porches to don both entrances; a whole dining room next to the kitchen, a den connected to the first bedroom, which was similarly connected to the hallway. And there was a full-out bathroom and another bedroom tucked in the back.
Steve was thoroughly distracted by Tony’s ministrations that he couldn’t hold back the sounds he was making. Tony’s movements sped up minutely, and he held Steve’s wrists in his hands, drawing them firmly up next to Steve’s head. And as Tony thrust into him fully, repeatedly pushing against that point inside him that made Steve’s toes curl, his head snapped back and he arched so hard he lifted both of their bodies from the mattress. His eyes flew open wide as another orgasm washed over him and a choked moan tore from his throat.
Steve lowered his sketchpad to the ground, suddenly unable to hold its weight any longer. It was… it was a horrible thought. That Tony might be permanently broken with no way to fix him.
Steve stepped closer, and his expression turned very serious. “You have a huge heart. That you’re trying to solve every problem with rational thinking, it doesn’t change the fact that your heart always leads your way, too. You agreed to work with Ross because you saw what our powers could do if they weren’t controlled. You… have the biggest heart of us all.” A self-deprecating smile rose to his lips. “And where does that leave me?”
With every glide, Tony's breath quickened. One hand dropped to the one Steve had pressed against his shoulder, while the other shot upwards to rest on Steve's head. When a subtle shift in position made Steve's cock hit that tender spot inside of him more fully, his name fell from Tony's lips in a long groan, followed by a list of strangled obscenities when Steve held that angle with precision, hitting Tony's prostate over and over again.
“Cuddles and dimmed light,” Tony mumbled after a minute. “If we ignore the slime-monster from outer space and my little freak out, we might as well call this our first date.”
She smiled knowingly. “Sure thing.” She leaned up and pressed her lips against Bucky’s cheek, lingering for half a second before pulling back again. Bucky only rolled his eyes and tugged on Natasha’s arm until she leaned back in and let herself be kissed decently.
Bucky was staring at the blueprint. Steve peered at it over his shoulder, and then fell very still. It didn't look like a simple prosthetic that would just sit there to give Bucky a more or less 'normal' silhouette. Steve glanced at Bucky. They'd discussed the reasons why Bucky wasn't using one and he'd been quite clear about it.
,” Steve said softly, tightening his hold around Tony, “is to not think for a little while. I need to… get out of my own head. Please…”
He walked closer and sniffed the air. There wasn’t much of a scent there, but something rang familiar. Inside the house, everything looked mostly as Steve had expected it to. Dusty shelves and walls, a musty smell. There was a stairway down into the cellar, and Steve could see footprints on the floor, clearly those of a man.
Tony smiled and leaned up to place a soft kiss on Steve’s forehead. “Look, he just woke up. It would probably be better if you waited a bit, but—”
get him a bit sentimental. The prospect of starting a new year in your life while simultaneously keeping the good things… he was a sucker for new beginnings.
“I’m not sure that’s gonna be enough,” Tony pointed out. “They had specific demands, and we very clearly couldn’t find common ground and—”
“What I’m saying is: you can work with me on my terms, or not work here at all, very much your choice. But try setting your dogs on Steve and I will crush you.”
Steve’s hands abandoned Tony’s hips and grasped his arms again, holding him fiercely as the waves crashed over him. Tony was quivering against him. Shaking almost. And when Steve looked down, he realized that Tony must’ve come too, if the slightly damp stain on his jeans was any indication. And slowly, allowing a few moments to tick by, he opened his eyes, finding Tony’s upon his.
They sat like that for a good few minutes, and Steve almost nodded off at some point, when he heard Pietro speak up. He and Wanda were standing in a corner a bit further away from the rest of the team, and Steve watched Wanda clean some of the cuts on Pietro’s face. “What are you thinking of?” he asked her.
And now… how could you believe in a God when your brother was tumbling to his death a second time while you could have saved him?
A sigh tore through her lips. “It’s… I changed. People change you,” she admitted and her eyes darted to the clock on the other side of the room. She made to stand up then, and Bucky only barely caught her around the waist, pulling her back. He coaxed her to lie down on top of him, disentangling his legs from the bed sheets.
Tony heaved himself into a sitting position, braced on one straight arm, then nearly folded over again.
“This is just getting better, isn’t it?” he asked, chuckling a bit as he slumped against Steve’s chest, trusting him to take his weight for now; letting Steve hold him, because it felt too comfortable resting in his arms not to stay here. His gentle touch was now a safe haven in the aftermath.
“You’d give Barbie a run for her money, Tones,” he says and Tony laughs, knowing it’s true. Tony may not be able to live up to the
Tony resists the urge to make competitive remarks and digs into his portion of food, glancing at Steve. Steve takes a sip of water from his cup and exaggerates his sigh, glancing back at Tony.
The next few minutes, they exchanged a series of texts. The precalc kids didn’t have to know. If they looked up, they could only see Dr. Stark occasionally looking up and out the room, as if he were drifting off into a thinking session. Or he was just eye-fucking his husband while they were finishing their test. Either way, the kids wouldn’t know.
Steve couldn’t help but be amazed at how fast Tony types. His hands were sometimes rigid when switching his hands between the letters and the keypad, but the motions of his fingers were smooth, like a fluid travelling through the bends and curves of a pile of bunched up soft fabrics.
“Okay, well, there’s different sizes and colors and shapes. I don’t know what’s so fascinating about them but I like them. Maybe just pulling them out of you is what gets me off.”
When Tony’s mouth needed a break from time to time, he would play with his beefy friend with his hand and make Steve watch as the brunet’s fingers wrap a fist around his member and squeeze and tug at it. For a little added fun, Tony would grab the base of Steve’s shaft and use it to wave Beef Junior from side to side as the head slid across his tongue back and forth.
Dr. Stark’s precalculus class was taking a test, so it was quiet in the room. The room across from him, Mr. Rogers–Stark’s Spanish classroom, was vacant, all except for the muscular blonde who taught the subject.
Steve woke up with Tony at his side, They were on each other’s side of the bed, which means Steve couldn’t reach for his phone without stirring Tony awake. He was curious about the time, it was sunny out and he could hear the voices of the neighboring children playing in the communal park.
Both of them can feel each other’s growing erections, but neither are quick to move things along at the moment.
“Karma sure is a bad bitch, but I'll be a little more gentle,” Tony remarks before licking a stripe up Steve’s shaft. He flicks his tongue back and forth against the head, and the blond continues to respond in expletives.
“Ha. Anyway, lemme get this straight. You want to go to that sex shop that was documented on your credit card statement?”
“I’m the hopeless kind,” Steve replies before he attacks Tony’s lips with his own, nudging Tony’s legs open with his knee before marking hickeys in his neck.
Steve and Tony are at their local warehouse store that sells products in bulk. They’re in need of stocking their fridge and more importantly their cabinets and cupboards. It’s Steve’s to push the cart, as part of their little amusing activity to alternate turns whenever they went shopping. Tony is at his side, phone in hand with a shared shopping list that Steve had mostly utilized throughout the week on his screen.
“Babe, you don’t even let me take your socks off if I give you a foot rub. You have a special sock kink.”
