"Neuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction." Mycroft said before he looked over to his left, another pathway being revealed. He exchanged a look with his sister before they headed down the route. "We're in the Vault."
Sherlock frowned. “You might do your job better if it did. Not that you’re doing a poor job now, but –”
“No need,” the midwife smiled. “You’re delivered, and both of you are healthy. You just need to rest, and feed, both of you. It’s been a long day.”
Sherlock went still. Though John couldn’t kill him, his fangs could still do serious damage. Sherlock had had to spend more than one uncomfortable night waiting for a limb to re-attach back in his early vampiric days.
John nodded, sitting back against the rest of the wheelchair. He realised he was exhausted, and dirty, and his brain was almost actively shutting down against the situation. He looked back at his daughter, laying like a starfish on the pad, covered in tubes, a nappy as big as she was taped carefully around her middle. She had a few longer strands of dark hair on her head, and her entire tiny self was covered in a fluffy down, like a little chick. She was very red. She didn’t look much like either of them, in her face… she wasn’t cooked enough.
Sherlock adjusted his collar. “I mean it, though. I am grateful.” He stood, and seemed to take a deep breath before walking to John’s chair, and to John’s surprise and delight, sitting on John’s lap, straddling him, legs either side.
John would later look back on the photographs from that time with a bittersweet ache in his chest. By that time, the ache had a name, and he knew what it meant.
“It can mean as much as you want it to,” Greg said. “You love him. You’re not leaving him because he’s abusive or cheating or whatever. You’re leaving because it’s self preservation. There’s no betrayal to get over, no one to blame. It’s just… something you think needs to happen.”
“No!” Sherlock stood up. “No, John would never… he’s a good friend, he…” he winced. “He’s too good.”
. Its horrible, evil, tentacled mouth was strewn over John's body, and John was inside it, or crushed beneath it as its suckers roamed over his skin. He yelled, and kicked hard, trying to scramble away. Pain shot sharply through his limbs, and tore at his skin as he realised he was naked, and that the disgusting tentacles were armed with biting suckers. Was this monster some sort of gigantic octopus? But they never left the water..? Did they?
Sherlock sat, looking a mix of confused and amazed and proud and angry. It was as if his face was flickering through all the emotions in determination to find the right one.
"Jesus christ." John sighed. "I get a pack of lies from my daughter and my family. Brilliant! Just bloody brilliant." There was a quiet pause.
"My mum. She's dead. She's dead." Sammy said, Sherlock and John sharing a look before Sherlock found himself hugging Sammy to his chest. "She shot herself. She...I thought...they're all..."
"We know it does," John said before Sammy sat down on a chair with Rosie who eventually hopped off his lap before climbing quietly onto the bed next to Atlas and lying next to her. "Careful, sweetheart." John whispered.
"You will be." John said as he came around and sat down on Atlas' mattress, back leaning against the side of Rosie's bed. Rosie came over with Jeff and nestled into John's side. Catching on, Sherlock sat down and leaned against John, shuffling when he realised Atlas didn't know where to sit. Atlas slotted into the gap between the men and leaned her head on John's shoulder. John tucked an arm round Rosie who, bored of her position, climbed into John's lap with an
"Thank you," John said as they were served their panini's and Rosie her tuna sandwich. He tucked into his chicken sandwich and made the childrenswear not to tell Sherlock about it. "Alright?"
"I'll give you a lift." John said as he picked up his satchel. "We'll leave in fifteen." He said as he went over to the desk to get his laptop.
"Oh, grandma!" Atlas exclaimed before leaning against Sammy where they could see her. "Me and Sam have been binging The Crown like you and Mycroft said we should."
"Other animals have it too." Atlas added, Upper Sixth looking towards her. The head of year looking like she wanted to just go on an all expenses paid holiday to Nice and drink cocktails on the beach. Pink bikini's and surfboards.
"Fine." John said before both men got up and went up the stairs to the bedroom. Atlas was peacefully sleeping and had been for the last two hours.
"Oh, Atlas." John said, looking at her from where he was leaning on the breakfast bar. She was perched on the kitchen counter and Sherlock as standing next to Rosie who was sitting on the breakfast bar. "I left something in a box on your bed for you."
"My man likes it," John smiled before Sherlock put his hand to John's chin and stroked it, a blush spreading across his cheek.
"Seven minutes and twenty two seconds." Sherlock said quickly before the male paramedic came to kneel on the other side.
"How are you two managing parents evening on Thursday?" Lucy asked with a grin, signing as she went.
"Yeah, yeah, I want to come home." Sammy smiled before he shuffled. "I don't know what to do about Leanne."
"Relax, I know," John replied before kissing Sherlock's forehead again as Sherlock sighed. "She means a lot to all of us. That's the scary bit. She hasn't even been with us a year and yet, everything is right now she's here."
"He's alright. Been more caught up here and he seems okay. Sherlock was a little rough the other day but other than that." Sammy smiled as he rubbed Atlas' arms again.
"Yes. I have heard from your dads that you have a very good picture memory and not such a good audio. Thank you Miss Watson-Holmes. I'll be by in the next few days to see you with your results."
IT was sharp and sudden when Atlas came around, sitting bolt upright in the bed and looking around flusteredly.
"Is everything al-" Sammy said coming into the room his face stained with tears, Atlas' weighted blanket gathered around his shoulders.
"And you should know, I'm proud of you," Sherlock said. "Atlas has lived with us for nearly a year and you've already adopted her. So, I love you, John. For all of that. Everything. For giving Atlas two parents and for making her happy. You changed our lives, I hope you know that."
"What if Papi...What if papa dies?" Rosie cried slightly as Sherlock pulled her close. Sherlock's eyes spilled over with tears as he bit back the sob that wanted to escape his throat. Atlas joined the hug, the three of them feeling pain inside of themselves.
"Have you got somewhere to stay?" John asked, shocked when she shook her head and gestured to the bags leaning against their feet under the table.
"I've got wooly slippers," John smiled as Atlas giggled and nestled against him and he kissed her hair in the light of the fire. He looked over at Mycroft who nodded in his direction from where he was occupying Rosie. Peter and his mother were sat over on a bit of the picnic bench, with Mycroft, Isla and Harry sat on individual seats taken from the kitchen.
"I missed you too, Ro." Sherlock said quietly as he closed his eyes and opened them again. He looked straight at her.
"Yes, yeah," Atlas whispered before moving to put her head in Sherlock's lap. "And I've got a funny feeling."
"My aunt wants me," Sammy sobbed, John's head snapping back. "My aunt wants to take me. I told her no. I want to stay here with Atlas and Rosie and Sherlock and you and Redbeard and Mou. She keeps ringing me and I keep telling her we've settled it with child services and she won't leave me alone."
"Yes I'm bloody sure," John snapped before frowning and looking at Sammy. "Sorry, that was uncalled for."
"Careful, Uncle, I thought you said this good behaviour towards each other wasn't supposed to continue," Atlas said with a smirk.
Wanda and Mrs Hudson swiftly made their way outside, whilst Rosie was occupied with Eurus and the dog. Mycroft frowned and headed up to find Atlas, pleasantly surprised to find his father following him.
"You and your dad are the same there," John said with a smile as Atlas looked off into the distance, waiting a moment longer. "Back with us?"
"So in other words. He doesn't remember you." Mycroft said bluntly to which Atlas responded with a steely not-helping-me-get-over-the-fact-my-father-has-forgotten-me look. To which Mycroft shied away and entered the room.
"Shh, we know," John soothed, moving forwards in his seat. Sherlock's hand travelled up and touched the side of her head, holding it closer to him.
said woman he was nervy. Couldn't tell if John had liked her. And it startled himself to find that he was doubting everything he was. Doubting if John was bisexual, if it would last. If there relationship would last. Would John love him forever? How could John love him after all those stupid, terrible things he'd said?
"You did what was best at the time." John comforted, carding his hands through his hair. He rubbed his hand over Sherlock's back - his fingers gracing the scars gently - before the other man sat up and looked at him. Their temples rested against each other as Sherlock closed his eyes, a silent tear falling down his cheek. "Oh, love." Gently, he put a hand to his cheek and rubbed a thumb over his tear. "Stop worrying so much." There was a pause. "Just talk to me, I don't care what it is, just tell me. Anytime. Anywhere." His hands moved to the man's neck, and their foreheads pressed together again. And Sherlock realised, this is what being in love feels like.
"Yeah." Atlas said quietly, leaning against him slightly. "I'm sorry I took the explanation from you."
"Okay..." Atlas said warily as Sammy pulled her out of her thoughts about how on earth they had actually managed to fit all four of them into a five door, 1 litre car that was tiny.
"C'mere, love," John said to Atlas who crawled into his embrace, his hand rubbing her back. "You are not your mother." He kissed her cheek before she rested her head against him again.
"Daddy?" She asked quickly, then paused as Sherlock looked at her expectantly. "Why doesn't Atlas have a mother?"
Eurus spotted it first, the laser before realising that the requirement was to trip them all at once. Oh, far too easy. Suspiciously easy. They did so, lying objects of clothing in the right spots in order to trigger them. With a bellow of air and an interesting click the Vault opened revealing a concrete room. The room had concrete beds and was empty.
And when she done that and the piercing noise of the room still hadn't dissipated, she moved to something she deemed harder. Naming a whisky for each letter of the alphabet.
Sherlock, loved his mum and dad, that was clear as day. His parents however had reversed roles, it was his father who would comfort him, his mother who would show him the ropes of life. It was strange, but not unconventional. Estranged but not silly.
"Yes, and anything else you can hear. Is not. Listen to my voice and keep your fingers against my pulse." John said, feeling her shaking hands resuming their position. "Good girl."
"Hello." John smiled, standing and taking Leanne's hand. "Nice to meet you." Just as Sherlock slipped through the door and scooped Rosie up into his arms. A fit of giggles as Atlas plonked a little melody on the piano.
"Yes. Of course I am." Timothy laughed before his face regained its usual position. "Once upon a time, I wrote a book."
"I want you all to start writing a short story." Mrs Pertwee said, from the front of the class. Noisy chatter filling the room. Atlas remained quiet and still. Mrs Pertwee's gaze ran over all the students before landing on Atlas. "Atlas Holmes!" She shouted among the noise. "Be quiet and move seat to over here." She gestured to the lone seat at the back, Atlas picking up her things.
ROSIE'S face smiled in delight as she looked at what she and the other female family members had made. She was excited, in a way no-one had quite seen before.
"Uhh...Sherlock." The man said. It must be Dr John Watson, the man who writes the blog's on Sherlock's webpage. The way he was standing suggested Iraq or Afghanistan due to the fact he was leaning slightly heavier on one of his legs. However, she knew this was psychosomatic and that it was actually his shoulder judging by the way he kept positioning his arm. She made a mental note to ask him later.
"Hello Sherlock." A voice said on the other side. Distinct yet unfamiliar to the pair as the voice continued. "Good to see I've got your attention. Now, if your listening carefully I have a case for you."
He decided to get up, swinging his covers off and leaving John peacefully sleeping in his side of the bed. He went through into the living room. Then it occured to him. Why? There was nothing he was going to be able to do when he was in there. Nonetheless he continued onwards and entered the room. He had yet to read his fathers book and there were plenty of copies lying around the flat, waiting to go to local bookshops. Slowly he picked it up, tossing it in his hands.
"Friends change and people move on." John huffed as his eyes caught Sherlock's who was watching with concerned eyes.
"Yes." John laughed kissing him. Then Sherlock looked like he was crying and John looked at him confused.
WHEN they re-entered their hotel room, they walked in to find John sitting on the bed reading a book whilst Rosie was colouring in on the little desk - Redbeard made a beeline for her and sniffed at her pocket of dog treats eagerly.
"I attached it to personal connections. Losing Mary and the people over in Afghanistan." John sighed. "You?"
"Think fast." Sherlock said as he came back into the room, throwing the pillow at her. Only she didn't catch it and stood frowning at it with a crinkled nose.
"Are you awake sweetheart?" John said as he walked over to her bed and put the painkillers, medicine and water onto the sidetable.
"Lestrade. Greg Lestrade." He announced, shaking the girls hand before noticing the likeness between her and Sherlock. Confused was the best way to describe how he was feeling, however he swiftly brushed it off.
"Do you guys wanna head out of the city? I don't know, make a day of it? Go and explore somewhere. We can pick up sandwiches at the shop." Atlas suggested before looking over to Sammy who was smiling.
"We'll go shop for what we need this afternoon." Wanda explained, Rosie bouncing excitedly in Sherlock's lap.
Their singing however, had drowned out the sound of someone hammering on the door. And when they finished, they heard it, loud.
"I love you too. Now, what do you want?" Sherlock chuckled as she rubbed her nose against his shoulder.
"Stop apologising about that," Sherlock whispered. "You've only done that and well...um...sometimes...she...well...you've always made sure I want to."
"Good." John said quietly, Atlas' breathing approaching some sense of normal. Her body still shook, tears still fell and her throat was still dry.
"He's out in the kennels so you'll have to put your jackets on." Mycroft said somewhat bitterly but nevertheless he was letting them see the dog.
"We haven't." Atlas said keeping her face unreadable as she had mastered. She'd been working on it a while, more since she moved in with Sherlock due to his ability to also read people. Unfortunately Molly's face gave it away and Atlas knew that.
"Okay. Then, she was brilliant, she was beautiful and she saved people." John began, thinking of how to navigate it. A lot of their story would come later. There was so much to tell her about her mother that he wasn't even sure she would understand it in her twenties.
"I know." John admitted just as Mrs Hudson came up the stairs to make three cups of tea. She silently applauded them before making some cups of tea for them all. "I always assumed her last name was Holmes. But is it? What actually is her name?" John queried the question playing on his mind furiously.
"We were just about to come down," John said as he looked down at Atlas' locked hand before up at Sherlock who frowned.
"Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know, but I know that I just want to go home, curl up in a ball and go to sleep. But I can't go home so I'll have to go to Mycroft's." Atlas sighed as she looked at Sammy with those eyes. The eyes that sammy knew was a means of secret speech that only the best friends knew. Atlas was simply saying:
"Oh Atlas." Sammy sighed as he rubbed her back and sat up. "Okay. Okay. Do you need me to get you a doctor?" Atlas shook her head and held up her hand as she heaved again and threw up the contents of her stomach - which wasn't much. Doctor Aduba appeared and stood by her bedside as she threw up some more.
"Ah-ah." John scolded as he closed the laptop lid back down. "No more homework this morning young lady."
"Alright. Some of your symptoms are because the poison isn't out of your system and I'm going to guess and say it will be another two weeks before it starts to clear. Okay?"
"I do, I hate you." Balled up fists made contact with his chest and he just took it. He was deserving of it. "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!"
and so many other things. Atlas sounds like my son so I'm going to give you a tip. You do everything. You ask if they're alright and you give them love. Make sure she's not alone but I'm guessing..." She looked over as Atlas gave a cackle of laughter. "Your already doing a pretty good job already." She smiled just as rain began to fall. "I live about two miles round the side of the Loch. You can only get to my house by foot but would you like to come for tea. I have access to the water there and if your into photography?"
"People?" She asked looking at John who just nodded in response. Rosie had become accustomed to strange and funny looking people entering the house at open hours and appointment times. She found it quite entertaining and Atlas had been helping her to observe people as they came in the door.
"Oh hello." Mrs Hudson said coming out the kitchen with a pot of tea and mugs. "John, are Sherlock and Atlas-"
Atlas and Rosie had been sat, cross legged on Sherlock and John's bed having an in depth conversation. Rosie was attempting to keep Atlas occupied on something other than the fact she had woken up with a dead body some hour and a half ago. John soon came into the room looking absolutely knackered. He climbed onto the bed and shuffled back against the headboard. Atlas lay down in the middle of the bed next to John, Rosie lying with her head on his legs.
"I'm going to ask John for help...And...well...you." Atlas replied. Mycroft sighed looking at her smugly.
"Me and your pa have some work to go through." Sherlock explained looking at her. Her eyebrows furrowed in response.
"Sherlock," John said softly, looking at the sad blue eyes staring up at him. "C'mere." He outstretched his arms for Sherlock to fall into and he did so, tentatively at first, but soon enough he was melting into his husband's embrace. With Sherlock's head just under his chin, John kissed his temple and kept his nose in his hair. "You didn't fail her, you didn't fail me and you haven't failed us. Your ok. I love you. Your ok."
"Oh! Uh, very nice. Thank you for getting it for me," Sammy smiled before he leaned against John with a smile. "Love you."
"That's called excitement dad." Atlas sighed before looking at him. "I am too and I really want to go make sure it's all okay."
It didn't seem right but that's what she had been told, so that's what she has to go by. For once in her life she didn't opt to contradict what they had said. It had been hard the past few weeks, what with Sherlock's memory loss over New Year and now this. It was also now that she and Sherlock had made themselves new rules.
"I think I'm going to go back to sleep." Atlas said before she lay back down on the bed, her head tilted slightly to one side.
"But you worked at a doctors practice, how could they not understand that?" Harry asked urgently, John shrugging his shoulders.
"ATLAS," Sammy said sliding into the room and looking over to the bed. There, her form was shaking, shivering like she was cold. "Atlas, are you alright?"
"Yep," Atlas said back before swivelling around to sit crossed legged, looking at Mycroft. "How do you deal with them?"
"What's up?" He asked with a little smile, gentle as she continued to roll her shoulder and her wrists.
"I know." Eurus smiled. "But you need to stay awake a little while, and then we'll go back to your room and I can sit with you."
doing up?" Atlas asked, looking over to him from the top of her book. She'd switched the floor light on and it was casting a warm glow over the living room.
"I finished the violin section for my music." Atlas said as she handed Sherlock the piece of music. He studied it before nodding and placing it next to him. "We're playing it on New Years Day when everyone is around."
Recently Rosie had started speaking to a wider number of people, but they all just supposed it was because they were who she felt the most comfortable with. So far she'd only spoken to Lestrade twice and Sherlock, John, Mrs Hudson and Atlas. She still wouldn't speak to a stranger or Mycroft or Sherlock's parents.
"If you promise not to misbehave you can stay." Sherlock warned as Eurus nodded her head in reply. Sherlock stood, looking around slightly.
"Hello!" Wanda exclaimed walking over to the door becoming quiet when she saw Rosie sleeping over her sons shoulder. Atlas stood behind them with Red.
After Mary-Anne, her thoughts began to shift to her time in care. She'd spent a lot of time thinking about this.
"And it wasn't," Mycroft finished as Atlas stuttered a nod. "And you've also had enough of death and danger for a little while and you weren't ready for more just yet?"
"Papa," Atlas whispered into the dark, trying to contain the sobs threatening to pile up. It was getting to be too much, the nightmare, the new seizure, the broken picture frame that wasn't going to be the same and the photo that had faded over time. "Papa." She croaked again but when he wouldn't wake everything became a bit too much and she was transported back to the recurring flashback of James dying. And how she'd tried to wake him but he wouldn't. It was the same as her nightmare. She had to make sure her parents would wake up, she had to-
"Yeah, no, your not feeling alright this morning are you?" John asked as he rubbed her shoulder and Atlas shook her head.
Sherlock, was sleeping, his head lolling in John's lap and the TV was blaring The Great British Bake Off.
"Felt like exploring the American civil war." Atlas explained, laughing slightly as she looked at him.
"Yeah?" He asked coming over to the single bed. She sat down and patted the space next to her, sitting she began.
"I got some new gold ones...which have engravings on the insides." John smiled as she looked at him. "They say 'Dinner?'"
"RIGHT, you lot," John said eyeing up Sammy who was standing with his guitar slung around his neck, Atlas who was sitting on the piano stool with her cello and Sherlock who was stood holding his violin under his chin and righty tighty-ing his bow whilst Rosie watched. "Our storage space on this trip is limited...however...each of you can take
"Yes, grandma is coming," John smiled as he looked over to Sherlock who was wiping down the counter. "Now, May, Xerxes. Considering we're all heading off to Scotland soon, would you two like to stay over tonight?"
"No, come on." Sammy said taking her hand and leading her to the door of the canteen. This was a big deal for her, having to enter the canteen. She didn't even like walking through when there were a handful of people there, let alone more. Too much to read, too much to see, too much to know. Her hand went clammy and Sammy tightened his grip as they entered. "You start to feel unwell and we leave, okay?"
"Yeah," Atlas also lied, she didn't know what she felt. Just a little tired but she knew that, once again, it was a symptom of her of FND.
"Yeah, look at us. With children and pets and it's all so great..." Sherlock was grinning and bright eyed before his face all fell and he suddenly looked deep in thought.
"Because I'm ashamed I did it." Sherlock said, still holding a crying Atlas but he opened his arm and welcomed John into the hug. He kissed him chastely before smiling sadly at him.
"I signed up to be your dad," John said pulling away and looking at her, with his hands either side of her face. "Which means I signed up for this." He looked at her face which was screwed up and so...so afraid. Stroking several strands of hair behind her ear he gave a kind smile.
"How was your appointment Ida?" Mycroft asked, looking to his other niece who jumped off the counter and walked over.
ATLAS' eyes tracked a blonde haired woman walking around outside her room. Before the woman enquired and approached a nurse. Then, the click of her heels entered the room and Atlas watched with her head turned to one side on her pillow. Her dads looked up to see the woman and Atlas watched Sherlock's face as he went through periods of recognition.
"Your not." John said reassuringly, Sherlock looking at him once. The spark was there again, he wanted to. By God did he want to, he just didn't know if John wanted to.
"We need to catch a bus to the next one," Sherlock said as they went up to the bus stop. There they sat, waiting a few minutes before they got on board. Sherlock gave a small smile to the bus driver and sat down on a double seat. Conveniently, the bus was relatively quiet and they managed to get a seat next to each other. Sherlock pulled out his phone and updated his tweet page before looking at it.
"For the seizures," Atlas said with a gentle smile. "The first is lorazepam but administered by needle. And then at the hospital they gave me two other kinds cause lorazepam doesn't always work on me. Buccal Midazolam and phenytoin. Normally used to treat epilepsy but they might be able to help the ones I get when they're bad. Like, normally if a seizure is over 30 minutes long then I'll get the big stuff like phenytoin because it works for me but it makes me really sick and amnesic. And then I tried Keppra but like Diazepam it made me sick."
"Of course I can." Atlas said before she re-tied the lace of her right yellow high top, removed her royal blue corduroy blazer till she was left in her yellow turtleneck and green tartan trousers.
"Smelt like?" Mrs Hudson asked incredulously. Atlas nodded. "Then how'd you get poisoned and not your dad or your papa?"
Their last period was a study and he assembled the remaining four of them and they darted off to different teachers. Slipping into idle gossip they tried to see if they could extract information on the woman, if anyone had something to say about her and everything they found out was catalogued in the group chat.
"It's alright dear." Mrs Hudson replied kindly. She really couldn't care less what had happened, the girl was right - she did spend it alone.
"Morning," The man at the checkout chirped before Atlas promptly found a bouquet of Roses which she collected before making her way over to the Costa machine at the side. Two Cappuccino's later and Atlas was walking to the checkout, and handing everything over. "Early morning today?"
When Sherlock didn't lift his head from his hands she leaned forward and gave him a semi-awkward hug. It was awkward until Sherlock put his own arms around her and stroked her hair.
"I don't care." John scowled. "You can't just do that." The older man took off after the woman, in an attempt to apologise. Sherlock was way out of line.
Fifteen minutes later and they fitted a cannula, a dose of Lorazepam flooding her veins as the seizure stopped.
Upon arrival, he signed in, had a few congratulations from colleagues who must have finally found out that he had married Sherlock and continued into his office. Flopping into his office chair, he removed his blazer and pulled out his phone. Finding Sherlock's number and his finger hovered over call, before finally landing. There was a total of four rings and just when John was sure Sherlock wasn't going to pick up, he did.
"Yes." Sherlock replied shortly into the phone. "I'll see you soon. Send my love to Rosie and Atlas. I miss them. I miss you. I miss Redbeard."
SAMMY, Rosie, John and Sherlock all found themselves in different places that afternoon. Sammy had a trumpet and saxophone lesson - from the same teacher, an hour of each - which took up two hours of his afternoon; Rosie and John were out at the park meeting up with Sophia Thorpe, one of Rosie's new friends; and Sherlock was busy working through paperwork that had finally caught up on him at New Scotland Yard.
"She will be ok," Mycroft said as he folded up the tissue and put it on to the table. Wanda came back up the stairs and sat on the sofa by Sammy, Rosie creeping up and standing next to Mycroft with a tear-stained face. Timothy appearing a moment or so later.
"Sherlock!" John shouted angrily, the younger man turning to look at him. The crowds around them looking momentarily before rejoining their conversations. "Enough."
Sherlock smiled, turning his head to kiss John’s palm before moving to kiss his throat again. “Happy Birthday, beautiful.” He scraped his teeth over John’s goosebumped skin.
John pulled him close by the shirt-front, so Sherlock was pressing him against the wall, and kissing him deeply, and oh
John dropped his hands, which had been creeping up to Sherlock’s face, back down to the tops of his arms. “What… what for?”
“I’m not expecting her to… I mean, they don’t always find it easy. Premature babies, I mean,” John said, going red. “Um. Are you ok with… me having a go?”
“Just lay back, John.” Sherlock kissed the flush pink glans before suckling gently at it, pushing John’s foreskin down with his tongue and lips, mimicking soft penetration that made John moan, before taking him further into his mouth.
That sparked a fury in James eyes as he clawed at Sherlock's hand, his face going red from a lack of oxygen. Sherlock sniffed, then slowly let the major down, sighing as he coughed, then heaved on the floor, gasping and pulling at his collar to loosen it.
“I asked her to,” Charles said. “You’re much too clever a boy to simply plod along at everyone else’s pace. Some people think omegas should just learn to read and write and do household accounting, but I say that’s a waste of your potential. Your gender shouldn’t come into it if you’re naturally intelligent.”
Note: Sherlock and John are seventeen. This is over the age of consent in the UK, so I haven't tagged as underage, but just a heads-up that here follows sexual content.
“They get a bit arsey up at HR if it’s longer than two weeks. There’s different allowances for omegas, of course, and alphas if they’re… with them.” He cleared his throat, and went a bit red.
In case anyone is wondering why Sherry didn't ring Sherlock sooner - he was taken into police custody for questioning, but released without charge.
Sherlock shifted slightly, but didn’t move away, just kept on playing at the game, hardly giving away that he’d even noticed John’s hand on his belly, aside from a slight pinkening of his ears.
‘Sherlock!’ his parents darted over as John turned his drip up higher. ‘Sherlock, it’s alright…’ His mother took his hand again, and Sherlock shut his eyes, his chest heaving.
don’t deserve to be beaten up in the toilets. You’re my best friend, and I… I’ll always come running. If you want me to.”
“What’re you thinking?” John asked, coming around to press their chests together. “You were smiling.”
John swallowed. Was her own father the father of her baby? The thought made the omega twist under the duvet, and pull his knees up. It wasn’t just being grossed out – it was sheer disgust, the fact that incest had, probably, taken place, and made a person. A baby. It was horrifying, and John put his hands over his face as if he could hide from the thought of it.
“No,” John rubbed his belly frantically, trying to feel movement from his baby even as the pain increased, and his trousers were soaked through. “No, no, please, no, please, I don’t want this to be happening, please –”
Mycroft came in to greet his family, next, and soon they were all drinking port (except John, who had a sad orange juice that made the baby do wriggling again), and eating nibbles in front of the fire. John had to smile as he looked at them all. Mycroft, texting Gregory. Sherry sitting on Alfie’s lap, feeding him grapes and cheese. And Sherlock, curled up, cat-like, beside John, one hand on his thigh.
John crushed him against the wall, grinding their hips together so Sherlock had to gasp at the sharp pleasure.
John groaned, and forced himself to sit up, putting the plate on the coffee table. “I can’t believe I’ve got three more weeks of this. I feel like I’m going to explode.”
A wave rolled him into the air, crashing him down in a haze of painful bubbles. As John was shoved beneath the water, the more buoyant oar spiralled away, shooting out of his grip and whisked away by the current. And when John kicked to the surface, he realised he was in serious trouble. The rain was only increased, and visibility had dropped to only a few feet in front of his face - salt-water was stinging his eyes and skin, and he began to feel extremely frightened. His fear of drowning was giving way to his fear of freezing to death in the water before he could even get close to shore.
‘We were at his house,’ Sherlock said to the waste-paper basket. ‘Alone. And I… I did something. Gave him some sort of signal – not on purpose! I swear, Mycroft, it wasn’t on purpose, but I… I made him…’
“Yes…” Sherlock indicated the papers on the coffee table. “Lestrade dropped them off. I’ve been glancing at them.”
“It shouldn’t be long,” John opened his laptop to order online. “Did you want to call anyone else? Use the internet? Watch TV? Read?”
“You can have me,” Sherlock whispered, his voice like a falling leaf. “I want you to have me. Please…” he kissed John’s cheek. “I just want… you.”
"Sherlock --oh, fuck, that's bloody good --shit," John stammered, his abdomen tightening. Sherlock took his hand away, though he was more than hesitant. John whined.
John exhaled, and actually leaned forward, to rest his head on Sherlock’s chest. But the alpha stood, and John had to catch himself, feeling strange. Had he
Sherlock’s mouth turned down. “Psychologically speaking. I only started transitioning… presenting as a boy… when I moved schools.”
John was extremely glad he was sitting down. Beside him, Sherlock’s elbow slid off the arm of the chair.
‘Let them.’ Sherlock shut the door, but didn’t turn the light on. ‘Or, let’s not stay all night, at least.’
“No. We… ended up shouting at each other. Sherlock pretty much threw me out, if it makes you feel any better.”
“Sorry,” Sherlock said, starting to slide up and down, his own erection bouncing as he moved. “No time to wake you up.”
On the afternoon of the day before they were scheduled to leave, John was collared by Sherlock in the crooked corridor that separated the bedrooms.
“You took too much!” Sherlock sobbed. “You never… you never looked at me as if you might even one day… you said you didn’t want me!”
John groaned, the alpha inside him crowing in triumph at the omega’s submissive words. He picked Sherlock up, quickly, and carried him through the kitchen to his bedroom, dropping the young man onto his bed as gently as he could manage.
Salisbury Academy was an old manor house, set back from the main streets by vast grounds on all sides, and with enough space inside to house boarders as well as day-students like John.
Easter arrived, and John burst out of school like an explosion. He didn’t even bother saying goodbye to his school-friends, just raced to the bike-racks and then cycled home at top speed. The freedom he felt as the spring warm air whipped through his hair, in need of a cut, made him feel beyond free.
"Yeah," John said, moving closer to Sherlock with a grin, and pulling him forward by his shirt. "How stupid of me."
“Not precisely,” Sherlock said. “He did say I ought to make more of an effort…” he paused, as if thinking. “He… had some opinions.”
They kept their faces close together, shaking breaths mingling as their hands shook similarly. John’s heart was pounding in his ears, and he didn’t know whether to move in for another kiss, or to freeze or to run away or to let go of Sherlock but…
“Maybe you’d like a water birth?” John took his usual seat in the armchair. “Did you think about that?”
“DO IT!” John shouted, trying to swing his legs out of bed. Several nurses, and Sherlock, caught him, holding him still. “I need to see my baby, don’t you fucking understand me?!”
“Yes, but that was a relationship arranged with the help of your father,” Tabitha pointed out. “Was that consensual on all sides?”
This was not a court. Courts were for important matters, not alpha / omega disputes like this, but there was a desk ready to receive the judge that would make the decision. In front of this desk were two others, spaced apart, facing the judge. John and Miss Ali sat at one. Mayhew and his solicitor, Miss Kogen, sat at the other. To one side was a school-like desk where the clerk was sitting at a typing machine, ready to take notes. There were six seats at the rear of the room which served as a viewing area. Sherlock had taken one of the seats. Two of the others were occupied by an elderly alpha / omega couple, whom Sherlock deduced to be Mayhew’s parents. This, too, was infuriating. A man like that shouldn’t have frail-looking elderly parents. He shouldn’t have family invested in this outcome.
“You will not be saying that tonight when I will be fucking you wearing only the coat”, I said amiably.
“With luck we may be able to prove Mr. Leeds's innocence from that ticket alone”, he said. “That being the case we have four other suspects in the case; Mr. Major, his two fellow employees and his lady-friend who alerted the police when he failed to show for their date on Sunday.”
“I rather think that I might persuade him so to do”, I said. “Can you tell us what happened to Private McCall?”
“We should definitely talk to this gentleman”, Sherlock said. “Would you mind if we explored the vicinity of the field today, sir? I am afraid that the constable and his men have almost certainly trampled on any evidence there may have been around the stone, but we may still find something.”
I reminded him sternly. “In modern war there are limits on the use of deadly weapons, doctor. Sir, what are the names of these ruffians who are bent on destroying your business?”
I nodded and went so to do, knowing from the unhappy growl that someone else was up too. I had the good sense to take him his dressing-gown; my son did not need any extra trauma just now!
“A chance to save the life of the gentleman who avenged your poor mother”, I said. “I only wish that I could use my gun, or that you had taken those lessons.”
One way in which my own life had changed in those immediate post-war years was when the village garage had set up a petrol-pump on the Lewes to Eastbourne road to the north which was starting to see more and more vehicles, although mercifully it was far enough from the village for us not to hear anything. There was also a sign directing those 'cars' that broke down to the smithy (really a second garage by this time) next door but one to pub, where they could be repaired. Sometimes we even saw the odd vehicle passing through the village
“That is exactly his contention sir”, the sergeant said. “Because of the late hour at which he left work that Saturday that would have had to have been a Sunday morning train; he could have reached Derby that night but there is no train back. Expresses don't stop at somewhere as small as our little town.”
Mr. Jukes nodded, sighed and turned to us. Despite their similar heights he looked much smaller with the giant’s huge bulk behind and beneath him. He carefully pulled his lover’s arms around him eliciting another fierce blush (and something that sounded suspiciously like a contented sigh) before he began his tale.
Likely murderer of his grandfather Lord Harold, he came to London to secure his inheritance by dispatching his elder brother Sulien who had become a beggar. Having tried to kill him he earned the Most Grave Displeasure of Queen Molly (see under the quickest ways to end your existence), who sent a warning through Sherlock that if the villain tried to avoid a long sentence he would not do well. Ethelred tried successfully to avoid a long sentence and served only a year for his crimes; he was killed less than twenty-four hours after leaving prison when he fell into the river. Four times, from his injuries.
"WHAT are you doing up?" Sherlock asked Atlas during the early hours of Sunday morning. She was sat on the sofa with "The Da Vinci" code, reading away when he came in.
And Sherlock smiled that smile until the need for sleep consumed him and he slept the best he had in years.
"Its alright. I'm a primary school teacher. I saw my class list for next term and I saw a Rosie Watson. I'll make sure it gets changed to Watson-Holmes, provide it's her. Reception?" Leanne asked, her cup now half full.
"I came back." Sherlock smirked. "I came back for you, just as much as papa and Rosie." He pulled away and put his hands either side of her face. "I don't know where I would be today if you weren't in my life."
When John was fourteen, Ryan from his class took a sudden week off, and when he came back was moody and sulky until Tom talked to him, and found out Ryan was the first in their omega class to go into heat. The news caused ripples of anxiety to go through the other boys, and for weeks afterwards they were all a mess checking themselves for signs of puberty, with Tom winding himself up into a frenzy after developing a fever that turned out to be the start of a difficult cold, rather than anything else.
Halfway through, Eurus snaked an arm around Atlas' shoulder and rubbed it gently. With a hidden smile, Atlas rubbed her nose against Eurus' shoulder.
"Good." Doctor Aduba smiled. "But take it slow. Another two steps to me and your dads and then we'll stop."
"I shot someone." Atlas said sharply, Mrs Hudson's eyebrows raising impressively fast. "When we were at the lodge we were taken to a facility or something. Long story short I shot someone. John was asking why, I told him to back off."
"Hold on. You've baked with Mycroft?" Eurus somewhat sniggered. Now Atlas could get a proper look at Eurus she saw how her eyes looked distant. How her thoughts didnt always seem to match up, but sometimes she would makes sense. Yet, Atlas had noticed how certain things changed her distant behaviour, cooking, dogs, violin, children but most of all family.
MYCROFT sat quietly on one of the chairs on the top floor at the top of the stairs. There he could be sure to catch one of the girls if they went off looking for their parents. His phone rang quite abruptly, stirring him from his paperwork for the government.
"No problem, I'm here alright?" Sherlock said as she sat up. "I will always be here for you, Atlas. No matter what happens. I promise."
"I love you too," Sammy whispered quietly before letting go as the kettle clicked and left the kitchen.
THE two men arrived home, Sherlock immediately taking a seat on his chair. John collecting two mugs of tea. He came back through and placed them in the appropriate places.
"Me and Atlas have a few things to finalise before you get to see it." Sherlock insisted before John gave a small smile.
"No, he chose the house." Atlas informed, surprised eyebrows rising from the other parties in the room. "I just helped him choose the decor and where to put stuff, the colours. That sort of thing."
"I'll always be here for you, my little duck," Sherlock said with a smile before she pulled away and looked at the birth mark on his neck before resting her ear over his chest. He had his chin on the crown of her head, his arms squeezing around her.
ATLAS neatly placed a piece of basil onto the top of each bowl of prawn pasta before taking a step back to assess her work. Smiling she picked up the smaller bowl for Rosie and another bowl and entered into the living room where Mrs Hudson had moved the table to previously. She was pleasantly surprised to see that Sherlock was not drinking, impressed that he was making the effort. John and Mrs Hudson were sharing a bottle of red whilst candles adorned the table. Atlas made a mental note to appreciate Mrs Hudson a lot more often than what she currently did.
“It concerns a photograph that you took some two to three months ago”, Sherlock said. “I really hope that you can remember it for your own sake. It was commissioned by one Lieutenant James Anderson; it featured himself and three of his fellow officers.”
I moved to the front of the stage and stared out into the audience. Tonight there would be not just a couple of hundred members of the public but the King-Emperor of Great Britain and the President of France watching on. All looking at the bumbling fool that was Doctor John Hamish Watson.
We returned home and, after I had made manifest my annoyance at my friend (all right, and had a good long rest to recover from same) we had a quiet evening in as Sherlock wished to wait for our leering friend's information before going any further with the case. Mr. Trevelyan duly came through and a telegram that arrived just after six assured us that whatever he was up to Mr. Galahad LeStrade was not selling his body for profit.
“Very useful”, Sherlock agreed. “It would have been up to three trains to get here from our little hideaway plus a carriage ride at either end. Though it did mean that I was subjected to John’s driving which has not improved one iota since he became mobile. If those rumours about them making people pass a test before they can drive are true he may well be forced off the road!
arguments! Especially when he fucked me afterwards while wearing his 'Bee Prepared!' sweater – and only the sweater!
I was surprised at that, as I could not have imagined the fellow we had met being able to manhandle anything more than a paper tissue. But then perhaps his gawky height counteracted his lack of substance.
“A Mr. Cheam borrowed five hundred pounds from the North Midland Bank in Derby about a month ago”, he said. “A false name of course. The manager who made the loan said that he was a slight gentleman, quite young but of good character. At least until they came to want the money back and found they'd been kippered!”
Inheritor of the family's tea fortune although he looked after both his brother Inglis (Sherlock's tutor at Tarleton) and their sister Lily. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness that would have taken years to finish him. His sister was packed off to the United States for a year after Iain decided to avoid all the suffering that lay ahead of him and take his own life by poison; his brother shot him to make it look like a burglary because suicide was still considered a crime.
“Is the gentleman's client known to you?” Mr. Guilford Holmes asked, looking curiously between us. “Because I have to tell you, from what little he did say of the matter it does not look good.”
My readers may remember a few years back the case of Sergeant Josiah Templar, so foully forced out of the Lancashire Constabulary and whom Sherlock had subsequently helped and been helped by (The Adventure Of Josiah's Jumbo). I knew that he had kept a weather eye on that excuse for a police force thereafter, and I was sure although he never said anything that his recent communications with our old police friends LeStrade and Inspector Macdonald in neighbouring Cumberland had been behind the dreadful 'Hornby Castle Affair', which had erupted in the newspapers a few months back. Fraud and corruption were far from the worst things to be revealed, and the upper ranks of both the Lancashire and Cumberland & Westmorland Constabularies had been decimated.
Mrs. Susan Start was an elderly and, as Sherlock had said, a very small woman who was in her late sixties. To save anyone asking, yes she did simper at someone, and no it was not me. One thing that I would
I was impressed that John had somehow obtained both a pot and a kettle which he now held up. My brother scowled at his excellent and quite accurate point.
“We need numbers in case someone tries to stop us”, I said. “One of us must get through. I will say that I am checking you out and taking responsibility for a day out in Chelmsford; they cannot object to that. Then we can go to the station and catch a train to Baker Street although we will have to change somewhere. We should just make it in time!”
1910. The dynamic duo visit the capital again for a memorable experience, John's fears of flying prove all too accurate and, miracle of miracles, he actually manages to say No to Sherlock!
The other annoying thing is that young Tobias has a lion's mane of hair while I (like my old dad) started going bald in my late twenties and have shaved my head ever since. Gives me the barely controlled savage look, which is a lot better when dealing with criminals than a nancy who looks as if he's just emerged from six hours in the hairdresser's while still styling their precious locks. And despite what some smart-arses at the station say we're
“Oh”, I said, reading down further. “He says that he has just moved to a place called Brierdene which is in the south of the county”, I said. “Do you know of it?”
Our circle of friends had, predictably, not come through the war unscathed. Just weeks before the whole horrible business had been ended, Gregson's eighteen-year-old grandson Tobias had been killed in the trenches with victory within sight. We had I suppose been fortunate that that had been our only loss; Lord Hawke's third son Harry had wanted to join up but the war had ended a month before his eighteenth birthday, while the same fate had befallen our friend Mr. Blaze Trevelyan's son Austol. And another friend, Mr. Cecil Forrester's son of the same name, had actually landed on the Continent and had been on his way to the Front when the Armistice had come into effect.
“I agreed an arrangement with your mother that she had promised to tell you on your twenty-first birthday”, I said. “In return I kept out of your life, much as I did not wish to. But as you neared that date your grandfather the colonel was entering his final illness then and your mother asked to delay until he was gone. She did not mention that she too was unwell; the first I knew of it was when you wrote of her passing just weeks after his. I was furious, but I could do nothing without upsetting your life completely. How did you find out, may I ask?”
“This does concern the fourth soldier in that photograph though not for any good reason”, Sherlock said, nodding slightly for some reason. “Certainly not to do with that dratted American female whose involvement in the case is a complication that we could well have done without. The sooner she goes back to her homeland the better as far as I am concerned, let alone my ear-drums could benefit from the extra peace and quiet. Now, as a photographer you would have had to stand close to these people to put them into the correct positions before taking the photograph. When you took this particular picture, did you notice anything unusual about that fourth soldier?”
jealous. They did not make hotel beds like they used to, and  after seeing Mr. Benjamin Jackson-Giles whom some annoying blue-eyed person still called 'Benji', we had gone to the hotel and... well, I had not strutted at 'someone' needing two cushions the following morning.
“I shall call in on a friend in Brighton after seeing you”, our visitor smiled, “and then back to Fray in Cumberland. His determination to prove that he still had it in him – and me! – was how he got the sprained ankle that kept him home this trip. I am sure that since Chummy took his boys to a new life in America, he has somehow gotten even worse!”
I had forgotten or more likely did not think to recall Sherlock's brother's warning about the seven cases that still lay ahead of us, the last of which might be particularly traumatic for me personally. Instead I looked across at the man that I loved more than life itself and smiled.
The men all greeted John with great enthusiasm; he had as I know he has said played rugby for his village team before they had merged with the team here some years back, and had once scored a try in an important match against their local rivals down in Alnwick.
“The thing that I love most in my job is finding that special something in a fellow that I can ignite and that will make him into a soldier, not just a man. It took me all of five seconds to see that Scott, bless the lad, did not have as much as a scruple of it. As you say he came into the army because his father made him, something that did not surprise me in the least as the blackguard has a dreadful reputation across the March. I knew full well that Scott would fail, and I knew that when he did it would not be good.”
I pulled on my coat and went outside, uncaring of the cold evening air. War with Herr Hitler's Germany had finally broken out and next week would be my eighty-fifth birthday – but what did I have to live for now that the man I loved was gone?
“I suppose that there is no harm in telling you”, he said. “But I warn you, it is hard to believe. Even for me, and I have the damn papers to prove the whole sorry mess!”
“Because although it may deter a small-scale war, it will mean that a major conflict will likely drag in everybody”, he had said. “The Continent is divided up into two warring camps, and those alliances could drag in everyone if just one domino goes over.”
The following morning Lady Bradstock sent her carriage for us as agreed and the two of us were driven up to Stalwarton Hall (we left Miss Kelley to travel back to London for obvious reasons although Sherlock promised to telegraph her once the case was sorted). The hall was a charming grey-stone building, not overly large for an ancestral home and set on a slight hill above a model village of some eleven identical cottages and a timber-framed inn called The Stalwart Man. The River Cherwell gleamed in the summer sun not far to the west and it was hard to believe we were barely five miles from the hustle and bustle of Oxford, scene of our first meeting almost exactly thirty years ago.
That was maybe stretching the truth slightly. I had had Miss St. Leger find me four very large Northumbrian men who had visited Bamburgh and ‘strongly advised’ Mr. Nye to leave the area. While he still had the use of his legs!
1904. Incredibly one of the worst examples of modern policing might actually be promoted another rank up the Metropolitan Police Service, despite his involvement in a crime. In another case with foreign overtones Sherlock 'takes time' to break another unbreakable alibi.
“I cannot believe it!” Dane yelled at us. “At my own damn school? Have you any idea what I will have to face next term for this? I will be the only pupil whose relatives have been barred from De Montfort's for life!”
I chuckled to myself. I could just imagine my father rolling his eyes when I told him that later. Some things in this fast-changing world stayed the same, thankfully.
“Breakfast”, he grinned, slipping out and seemingly unaffected by our little marathon. “I shall fetch it into the main room.”
“John?” I managed, gesturing to the ring. I really needed release too. But to my surprise, he just stood up and sat back on the chair opposite.
By all rights Ivan should have known that he was my son by now, as it was nine months since his mother Mrs. Leeds had written requesting a delay in informing the young man of his true parentage while his grandfather – not actually his grandfather, I thought sourly – Colonel Warburton struggled with what Ivan's mother had assured me was his final illness. Her last letter had said that the colonel was still losing ground so I had been anxiously preparing myself for the inevitable – and now this!
One of the things that Sherlock wanted most now that we had a place of our own was to have a 'proper' garden (the sole disappointment of the cottage was that the tenants had obviously bothered little with either the front or back gardens of the place which had become completely overgrown). Of course it was already autumn when we moved in but apparently one could do a lot of preparation work for the next spring, and we both enjoyed preparing the ground for what he had planned. There were some disagreements over what went were but we were manly men and had a sensible way of resolving such things.
“Distraction sex when I will let you eat the Branksome's éclairs that I bought you off my naked chest while....”
“What I have to tell you is in some ways difficult”, I said, “and given the delicate nature of the matter at hand I would ask that you not mention what passes in this room once you leave.”
“I dare say that the fellow that you passed near Guildford might disagree”, smiled someone who was not letting lucky that evening. “I do not think that your gesture quite qualified as an authorized hand signal.”
Eighteen years. Except for that chance meeting in an Alresford bookshop I had not seen Ivan since Sherlock had put away his murderous uncle and I had nearly killed the vermin when he had attacked my son. I had remained in communication with his mother, and had put aside money for birthdays and Christmas in a bank account for his recent coming-of-age. The last photograph that I had received had coincidentally been not long before that great event; just as in our chance encounter in that Alresford book-shop there was rather too much of me in his looks although he did have Stevie's ridiculously long hair, a complete lion's mane. He also bore some resemblance to my nephew Jack who himself was almost eighteen years old. I was thankful that the two would almost certainly never meet, although given my luck I was not reliant on that never happening.
“You have quite a few family members, Benji”, I said, thinking that I was understating things by a factor of... a lot, “and Luke has appointed some good lawyers to help you. As for spending it, you have all those grandchildren and great-grandchildren still growing up. You should honour my cousin's memory and use his money for them, as he would have wanted. He left it all to you because yes, he loved you. He loved you enough to overcome the pain he felt when you were with someone that you loved better and to always respect that union before his own desires. That, Benji, is true love.”
“It is where she meets her confederate from the Derby works”, Sherlock said. “We were told that there was no train that would have got someone to Derby and back that evening, but it was possible to go to Leicester and back. There is just time for her to hand over the copies of the plans that Mr. Brown has supplied her with and then to return as far as her grandmother's house in Kettering. We were told that that lady was 'dotty'; if she had been asked and had remarked on her grand-daughter's arriving later than had been claimed her evidence would likely have been dismissed.”
tenant. This tenant is a large, formidable and loud woman, who is very fond of her own opinions and believes that everyone should have the 'benefit' – as she if no-one else sees it – of hearing them. At every waking moment. She may only be in the area for a relatively short time but to those around her it seems so much longer.”
There was also the death of someone that my love and I had both known. I cannot in all honesty say that this event was deeply mourned on my part.
My nephews and niece had all gone to Hetty's parents for the New Year so it was just the four of us for the last few days which was nice in its own way. Much as I loved being Uncle John (and Sherlock always blubbered whenever one of the children called him Uncle Sherlock!) an adult Christmas, our last before we would decamp next September to our new hideaway, was wonderful. True we could still visit them for the festive season thereafter but it felt like this was in some way a defining moment. Just nine months to get through without any hiccoughs, and we were there.
Lion and I occasionally saw Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson but I doubt that either of them had spotted anything amiss. Father had accompanied us the last time only a few days ago and Mr. Holmes had mentioned that they were about to head off to East Suffolk for a case there. I was therefore most surprised when they called in at my home in Chipping Ongar, as the route back from where they had gone would have been quite difficult involving as it did either a long carriage-ride from Chelmsford or a most circuitous route back through the capital. I thought at first that they might be here to see young Henry, but the worried looks on both their faces quickly told me otherwise.
“The general did request my services”, I conceded noting how both young men turned pale at that. “However, having seen how things are I am inclined to deliver him justice. Although maybe not the sort that he is expecting.”
"Please sir, you can't tell anyone!" he said desperately. "The team accept me for one of their own; they'd drop me like a stone if they thought I was a nob!"
“Then it is our pleasure to wish you good day”, I said. “Once I have informed the general of the way things are, I will send a telegram to let you know all is well. Mr. Hale, I am trusting you with something most precious. Do not let me down.”
Not for the first or the last time I was sure he was going to kill me through too much sex. Oh well.
“A court will not admit these as evidence”, the lawyer said, but I could hear the uncertainty in his words.
The calm, collected way in which he said that would have been chilling, yet his eyes bore the same righteousness of character that my half-nephew and son-in-law Lord Hawke had, and that he had passed on to all three of his sons, my wonderful grandsons. Like me this boy had chosen justice before the law.
"When you're alive for as long as I've been, you stop believing in coincidences," Sherlock said, smiling softly at John.
"I bet." John wrote something down. He glanced up at their oblivious teacher, and Sherlock got a hint of John's aftershave, escaping from his shirt. John shaved, every third day or so, though he could have gotten away with longer. He probably liked doing it. Sherlock understood that. Mycroft had caught him trying it, once. It had felt lovely. John used a wet razor, and some own-brand cream, and he went with the grain, because he had sensitive skin. And chapped lips, sometimes, though it didn't detract from his handsomeness.
When they got back, Sherlock took himself to his room, and lay out a line, not bothering to measure the correct dosage. He checked his phone.
“Mm, yeah. Nice to get a lie in,” John turned his head and opened one eye, peeping at Sherlock’s sleep-tousled head. “I thought you’d be up.”
Mayhew glanced at his solicitor, who stood up. “Madam Justice, it is hardly fair to ask an alpha to show restraint when in the same room as a heating omega.”
“What do you… call…” John glanced down at Sherlock’s crotch. He swallowed, a blush creeping over his cheeks.
John pursed his lips. “Sherlock, I’m not going to lie, here – it sounds like you’re buying yourself time.”
They dressed warmly, Sherlock pulling John’s hat on firmly, and knotting his scarf under his chin, so John’s heart sang with the joy of being cared for. He even let Sherlock hold his gloves out before wriggling his fingers into the holes.
“John has always been well behaved,” Sherlock said. “But yes, I agree. I trust you to keep an eye on him whilst I’m away, Father.”
“You know what I mean… everyone is stupid. I find that if I adopt certain characteristics, people stop trying to scent me, or stare me into somehow presenting. Depending on the circumstances, and the gender of the opposite party, it can work rather well.”
Sherlock looked at him, eyes glazed, snot on his upper lip, stubble with tiny bits of fluff clinging to it where he’d wiped his face on his sleeve.
John had gotten away from that house having had his worst fears confirmed – that people he hadn’t told knew about the abuse he’d suffered as a child, and that that
“Come on, I’m not even thirty,” he tutted, wincing at the tiny flecks of grey hair that had appeared at his temples. “Parenting’s a magical experience alright. Makes you transform…” he washed his hands, and went out onto the landing, listening to the clatter of the caterers down in the kitchen, the laughter from outside. He went over to the window, and peered down into the garden.
“Looks ok to me,” he handed the photo back, and turned to start putting his shopping away. “What did Sherlock think?”
It was nothing like he’d imagined. As soon as his back hit the mattress again, Sherlock’s mouth latched onto his throat, John orgasmed. He cried out in a broken and ragged voice, arching from the bed as he held onto Sherlock’s hair with one hand. Pleasure shot through him fast, but refused to die down. It burned through him fiercely, setting his nerves on fire, and wouldn’t be extinguished. It grew hotter, and harder, and drained him in the most wonderful way he could imagine.
“You’re welcome,” Sherlock beamed, as John took in the sight of at least twenty Easter Eggs. “I wasn’t sure which chocolate you liked best.”
“No, it’s not debatable at all,” Sherlock insisted, squeezing John’s hands. “Whatever happened, and it was enough to get you to use violence, was not your fault.”
Sherlock darted into the bathroom. He didn’t bother with his teeth – they had already kissed, John knew what he was getting into – and made the rest of himself as presentable as he could manage, before flying up the stairs.
“Mm,” John snuggled back, enjoying the attention and closeness, even with Sherlock’s solid cock up his arse still. The inflated knot pressed against his buttocks, and some part of his brain wondered how he could ever fit that inside him again. It felt enormous, though admittedly it was larger than it would be if compressed inside John’s body. “Does it hurt?” he asked, rocking back against it.
“Talking about you,” John kissed him on the top of his head. “I can’t take my eyes off you, you look so beautiful. You’re distracting everyone from their work.”
“Her,” Sherlock said. “Her, John. She’s – she’s been born, she’s not – not…” he swallowed. “She’s in intensive care, upstairs.”
Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, answered it. "John, good evening. Had a good day?" He stood in the doorway, which was odd, because usually he let John straight in.
John took a moment for that to sink in. “Right. Ok. That’s…” he sat on the window seat. “Makes my scarf look a bit shit.”
