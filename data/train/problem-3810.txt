“Hate to break it to ya, guy,” Dean scoffed “but it's the truth. Now, I know there's such a thing as multiple gods and all, killed a couple of those too, but last time I checked there's only one with a capital 'G'.” Aziraphale looked down at his hands, contemplating for a moment, before glancing up at Crowley, who shrugged in response.” Look guys, I know it ain't easy to believe, hell I'd think I was crazy too if I hadn't met the son of a bitch myself, but it's the truth, and I need your help.”
In the blink of an eye, a ball of fire consumed Chuck's hand and he pulled it to his chest with a slightly pained hiss.
“You seem to have no problem with Castiel.” Aziraphale countered. “He's a seraph. Far more dangerous than I am.”
"Don't be so patronizing, Crowley." Aziraphale chided. "Cooking is an art of passion. It is easy to tell through taste whether or not the chef cares about what he is doing. It was a truly marvelous, Dean. Thank you."
When they got back to the bunker, things only got worse. The jokes weren't nearly as frequent, but their ever present threat was maddening. That, coupled with the fact that Dean was now constantly overcome by guilt every time he was in the same room with Castiel, it was enough to drive anyone to extreme measures. He knew the angel would do anything for him. He had died over and over again for Dean's sake. It was only a matter of time before he lost his friend for good and it was all his fault. He had corrupted Cas so much over the past ten years that he was worried he'd never be able to have anything outside of saving the Winchesters.
"You...?" Castiel tilted his head in confusion. That confusion quickly turned to pride as he realized that Dean had to be holding back his anger. The hunter was trying his damndest not to fly off the handle like he had so many times before. It was obvious that he was furious with Castiel, but he wasn't going to let his anger get the best of him again. "Dean…."
Rowena sighed, placing a magic seal over the gap, to keep in the souls. "We do have another option..." She said quietly.
Dean chuckled and patted his back before pulling away. "What do you say we find our prophet?." Dean smiled, before smaking him in the chest and walking away.
Cas settled back into the booth crossing his arms "You seem to bee awfully worked up over nothing, Dean."
"That wasn't the point of tonight, Sam." Cas said, reaching over to take one of the shots sitting, untouched, infront of Sam. He slammed it back and let out a sigh, clearly starting  to relax a bit. "We're  here to get our minds off the things weighing on us, correct?" He took another of Sam's  shots before continuing. " If Dean feels 'losing m virginity' is the way to accomplish that goal, I'd hate to dissapoint him." A hint of sass bubbled up under his tone.
"Oh, come on, Aziraphale...." Crowley whined, stepping into the room and shutting the door behind him.
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Sam watched Dean curl in on himself. The gasping sobs only made worse by his injuries. Sam sat and rubbed his back as he waited. It broke his heart to know his brother had been holding it in for so long. He knew that it had taken Dean a while to respond to his frantic phone calls after Chuck had wiped the Earth, but now he was starting to realize, those few hours weren't nearly long enough for Dean to handle his grief. It was a while before he pulled himself together enough to speak again.
“Your manners could use some adjustments, Angel.” Crowley chuckled. “The Youngs are going to start getting suspicious about a grown man calling about their son and hanging up without explanation.”
"You bastard!" Aziraphale snapped. Crowley placed his arm over the angel's chest to keep him from lurching forward. "They're good people. How could you possibly do this to good people?"
"Castiel said he had a copy of the play." Mary replied. "He told Jack and I he would watch it with us, since he enjoyed it so much the first time."
"I just had the most interesting conversation with young Marie outside." Cas's small smile turned into a full blown smirk.
Cas gave him an annoyed glare as he settled his coat over his shoulders. "Well I was also trying to pass the time. I've been stuck in here for too long. Besides," he leaned over to pop the tape out of the deck and place it back into its case, " not every problem can be solved with powers, Crowley." He ran his hand over the words on the case before sliding it into his pocket.
“Do you think you could take me to Anathema, so I could ask her for help?” Dean asked trying to stay on topic.
Cas stood up straight and raised an eyebrow at Dean  "Did you just call me hot?" He smirked "Really, Dean I'm flattered but now is not the time. Your brother is right here." He and Sam broke into yet another round of laughter.
"It will. But first things first." He turned to Cas, who was still in nothing but his tattered shirt and pants. It was rare to see the guy in so few clothes and it made Dean uncomfortable (for reasons he never really understood) to see so much of his skin. It wasn't a bad feeling, but it wasn't welcome either and Dean had never really taken the time to unpack all of that before, so there was no reason to start now. "You gotta do something about that Cas." He waved his hand gesturing to Cas's clothes. "It's almost like seeing you naked dude and I gotta say it's a little distracting."
"It's a..." Claire started, before shaking her head and moving on. " Never mind. You won't get it. You're like an alien I swear!"
Dean looked down and nodded his head, possibly reflecting on the times his own arrogance almost did him in as well. "Good." He said breathlessly. "Good, that's...that's pretty frickin awesome actually. Guess karma's a really bitch, right?"
"Dean?" Sam breathed as he dropped the blade and jogged over to help Dean to his feet. "Are you okay?"
"Okay, one: you shut your fucking face!" Dean said pointing at Cas. "Two: what do you mean by 'the entire internet'?"
"Then perhaps we should be figuring that out instead of arguing!" Rowena screeched. "You're wasting precious time acting like a couple of school children when we should be coming up with something!"
Sam blew out a sharp breath and ran his hands through his hair. "You might change your mind about being benched in a minute..." He mumbled under his breath.
“I know.” Adam said, looking down as he shuffled his feet. “But I couldn't help it. A great, big portal to another world right in front of me? I had to see it.” He lifted his head and looked around a bit before settling back on Dean. “It’s a little messy you know. My mother would have a fit if I were to let my room get like this.”
"He's in a better place, Sam." She said quietly as the embers started to fizzle out. It was a cliche thing to say, she knew, but it was all she could think of.
"Great." Dean said grabbing his jacket off the back of his chair. "Let's go. The sooner we get this over with the better."
"Ha." He slid up the bed to rest his back against the head board, looking down while he thumbed across the small plastic box in his lap. "Yeah that ain't happening." It was odd seeing Dean so broken. He always seemed to be full of fight and fury.
"His judgment, for one thing." Sam answered. "I don't know, just ever since he got back from purgatory… he's been…it's like he can't think straight anymore. He used to be no nonsense when it came to killing monsters and only trusting people he knew he could trust and now… I mean, I get it. Purgatory was rough on him, but the guy has literally been to Hell and back. I don't see why this time is any different."
"I didn't know what to do." Dean admitted. "I…he told me that he wasn't sure what his happiness would even look like, because the one thing that would make him happy was something he could never have…"
"I'm not stupid, Dean." Cas stated, rolling his eyes. " I know you've been doing things to get a rise out of me. Consider this a taste of your own medicine."
Cas smiled as he walked back over to the bed and sat down by the hunter. "You are as well, my love." He said drawing a stray strand of hair away from Dean's face.
When Dean got back to the room after scarfing down a bag of chips and chugging a cup of coffee, he found Sam and Cas huddled over Sam's laptop at the table, snickering to each other. "What's so funny?" He asked trying to peer over the top of the screen.
Crowley opened his door and slid into his seat. He closed the door behind him and turned to point a finger in Dean's face. “If I ever catch you trying to drive my car again, I'll...burn off your hands or something!” He snapped his fingers and the car started, and before Dean could even argue they were racing down the street.
"Dean." Cas said calmly, placing his hand on Dean's shoulder, which almost instantly calmed him. "Sam's right. While I don’t think our case should be, or would ever need to be repeated, it would be wise to keep everything under close observation incase a similar situation arises. While we do have an ideal situation in regard to immediate crisis, there's no telling what the future holds. People will always be at war. Monsters will always create more monsters. While things may remain, for the most part, harmonious, true peace is an utter fallacy as long as free will and thought are allowed. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is smarter be prepared for the worst, than to assume it won't come."
Dean took a few more deep breaths before replying to his confused friend. "Dude, no. I mean say that to her. That was beautiful. Anyone would fall for that."
“I'm sorry, Angel, but he's right.” The demon shrugged. “She's acting extremely suspicious. I know you want to believe that everyone is full of rainbows and sunshine, but something is definitely going on with that girl.”
“So, what is it then?” Dean asked. “Witches? Men of Letters? You guys hunters? I mean, the last one wouldn't explain the magic, but it would definitely explain how you knew about the blade being enochian.”
Cas bit his lip and shook his head. “It hardly matters anyway. The Shadow said it would only come for me when I allowed myself to be truly happy...”
It was Crowley's turn to blush, though he tried his best to hide it. "That was different." He said, turning back to face the angel with his tongue peeking out between his grin. "Everyone was doing it then."
"Never the less," Aziraphale said gently, " I wanted you to know that Crowley isn't just a demon. You shouldn't judge a book by its, scaly, cover. After all, if you were from our world, you and he would be in the same boat."
It was Cas's turn to sigh as he walked over and placed the clothes on a chair beside the door. " I'm not mad at you, Dean." He said, turning to face the hunter. "I'm just....I suppose I'm just not used to the realization that somethings mean more to me than they do to you."
She smiled wide as she placed her free hand down on the bar and leaned in to Cas's bubble. Having no sense of personal space himself, he remained unmoved, which she read as encouragement. " You, know I've   been working  here a long time. I see a lot of men drink themselves  silly. I don't  think I've  seen many who can..." She paused, looking Cas up and down and gave him a wink "...handle themselves....quite as well as you." She stood back up sliding the empty  glasses towards her, never breaking eye contact. "If I didn't know any better, I'd  think you were some kind of freak."
Dean waited until he heard the door close before turning on the witch. “What the hell was that about?!”
"Sheesh," Sam put his hands up in surrender "sorry, I was just kidding. That was actually really nice of you."
had been found, and they were free to leave their posts, before placing his phone back in his pocket and approaching the door. It was locked. "Cas? You in there, buddy?"
A knock on the door broke him out of his spiral. “Go away.” He choked out over the blaring music. He couldn't face Sam right now. He was responsible for the loss of his brother. He couldn't bare to look him in the eyes. He contemplated just flying off and never returning when the second knock came. “Go away, Sam.” He yelled, trying his best to sound forceful through the onset of woeful regret he was feeling. The door swung open and Cas stood to usher the hunter out. “ “Sam, I can't....” He shut off the music and turned towards the door, stopping when he saw Kaia standing in the entrance instead.
He glanced back up into the rear view, ignoring the wicked smile growing on Rowena's face, to see Cas's face scrunch up in confusion as his head tilted to the side.
"I'm not entirely certain I'm completely restored, no. " Cas replied. " But that appears to be the case so far. I'm still weakened a bit, as my powers are tied to Heaven, and well.... but yes, I am more myself than I have been in recent years."
Sam was quick to elbow his brother in the gut before turning to their host. "This is... really something Marie. You really went all out...but um... isn't this a little...Dark? For an engagement party, I mean."
"I have." Cas said. " You haven't though. Not truly, anyway. You have only ever seen me as Jimmy Novak."
Siobhan instantly had a knife in her hand shoving Kristen behind her, and Kristen had her hand over Siobhan's shoulder, clearly having a better understanding of what was happening. She covered her small face with he other hand a giggled whispering something into Siobhan's ear that seemed to make the situation click for the other girl. Siobhan dropped her head and started laughing, tucking her knife away in her pocket and pulled Kristen into her arms. "Oh, my God you guys! You can't Sacre me like that! What is all this?"
“I told you, my budd...Cas... he's an angel.” Dean wasn't sure if he could really call Cas his friend anymore. The seraph had made it pretty clear that things weren't okay with them. “The guy's healed me more times than I can count. I know what it feels like.”
"Whatever it is, Dean…" Cas said quietly "please let me know. I can change it. I want to make Heaven perfect for…for everyone."
"I don't wanna come out of the damn closet, okay Cas!" Dean admitted. "Don't get me wrong. This? Definitely wanna see where this goes. Like, hot damn, Cas! That had to be some of the hottest shit I've ever experienced. Seriously, I don't think I've been so turned on in years. But I just....I don't know if I'm ready to face the whole....gay thing...not yet."
“Kaia....” He shook his head. “I...we can't ask you to do that. You've already sacrificed too much.”
"Can't you just, I don't know, make your self unhappy or something?!" Dean asked. "Like, think of dead puppies or whatever?"
"I don't like this Castiel." Jack shook his head. "You told me demons can't be trusted, I don't understand why you would...."
"Down stairs in the dungeon with the others." Dean replied, tucking his gun into his waist band, as she and the others took off down the steps. "What part of 'God's on our asses, don't come to the bunker' did you not understand Garth?"
About a million thoughts raced through his head in a matter of seconds and he watched the girl in front of him stumble for her footing. How had Cas been able to find her so quickly? Did he already know where she was? If not, it didn't take him very long to find her. He was looking for Dean for hours. How many times did he search the Earth to find him? The thought of Cas frantically searching the entire world over and over, desperately searching for Dean was cut off when Kaia's hands found the edge of the table and she lifted her eyes to meet Sam's.
"Dean?" Aziraphale asked as he poked his head into the hunter's room, receiving a particularly pitiful groan in response. "Oh, honestly!" The angel huffed as he marched across the room, tossing the pillow from the hunter's face. "I understand that you're upset, but that is now reason to curl up in a ball and cry into your pillow like a child!"
“Forget it!” She yelled. “Last time I helped you, promises were made with no intention of being kept! You have nothing to give me, I won't help you!”
“I'm just saying, guys.” Dean chuckled. His stomach was now sore from laughter and his face hurt from smiling but honestly, he couldn't care less.” It's not that complicated.”
Dean let out a sigh and scrubbed his hands over his face. “No, that sounds about right.” Dean groaned. “Why would things go the way I need them to? My luck doesn't change just 'cuz I'm somewhere else.”
Cas quickly schooled his features, donning his usual stoic glare. "I said 'you win', Dean." He huffed. "I'm sorry. I'll drop it." With that, he turned and left the kitchen.
Dean licked his lips and dropped his head, giving a weak nod in return. "I promise, okay? I promise."
"It was going to kill you, Cas!" Dean shouted back, feeling tears well up in his own eyes. "You can't expect me to just stand by and watch you die! Not again!"
Dean smiled at her and turned on his usual charm. “ Hey, there darlin',” he winked “how are you doing tonight?”
"Don't." Cas snarled. "Don't pretend like you actually care what happens to me. I know what I am to you. You don't have to pretend anymore. I am at your beck and call until this is over, then I'm gone. I won't bother you ever again."
Cas straightened to his full height and closed his eyes. He took a steadying breath before he spoke. “ I thought I would be ready, when the time came. I thought I would be able to let go. I even...I even told Jack that it was part of being who we were, what we were. That we would have to watch the people we love disappear from our lives, and we would have to take solace in the fact that we at least got to know them in their brief existence on this earth.” He shook his head and opened his eyes, staring deep into Sam's soul. “I was wrong. I'm not ready. I was foolish to think I ever would be. Call it pointless, think me selfish, I don't care. You may be willing to give up, Sam, to let your brother wander some unknown world because you think that he may be better off, but I'm not. I will find a way to bring Dean home, with or without your help.” Then, with the flutter of wings, Cas was gone.
Just like he played off getting Cas something like it was nothing, like he was just trying to keep him from dragging every one else down. Treating him and his feelings like a burden. Again.
"Look, Sammy boy, " Gabe shrugged, "we don't even know how many worlds there are out there. If you want to go out and find them, that's on you, but I'm not going out of my way to try and fix things that may not even be fixable. There's no telling how lost some of those worlds may be, how long they've been forgotten. I know it's kinda against your code and all, but you can't save everyone."
“I don't think I remember the small woman's name,” Adam said thoughtfully and then shifted his gaze to Kaia. “Dean didn't tell me about you, but I saw you. You were in this room with the sad man. You seemed to be in an awful lot of pain. Are you alright now?”
Dean nodded back and threw her into gear, speeding off down the road. The first place they went was his parents place, after asking Cas for directions. Mary flew out of the house (his old house) before Dean could even put the car in park. He got out, and raced to meet his mother, picking her up and swinging her around in a circle. He heard the car door shut at the same time he saw John approach Castiel, the two of them sharing a few short words of introduction, but they would both have to wait. Mary grabbed Dean's face and kissed his forehead, crying about how much she missed him. They talked for a while, about everything that happened after she died, everything with Jack and Chuck. He told her about his final hunt and getting a Job, what Sam and Eileen had done with the bunker, the baby. He felt a small twinge of sadness explaining how he was on his way to meet his nephew when he ended up here. Mary shushed him and hugged him again, telling him that it wasn't his fault. Before he could respond that he knew, that sometimes accidents just happen accidentally, Mary had stepped back and began rushing toward Cas.
Dean took his tone as confirmation that he was on the right track. “Look, I may not be the sharpest knife in the block, but I ain't stupid. I fell, on my back on your stupid stone floor and, I don't feel a damn thing. You wave your hand and magically knock me out, I'm guessing I probably hit my head pretty hard on the way down and all my cogs are still ticking away at full strength.” Dean saw Aziraphale swallow hard. Good. Maybe he would get his answers easier than he thought. “I'm no spring chicken. There are mornings I hurt myself crawling out of bed, more often than not these days, and I get tossed on the ground here, wake up and feel 20 years younger? That ain't natural! So, I'm gonna ask you again, and if you want your answers, I'm want mine. What...Are...You?”
Cas took a deep breath and nodded his head, bracing for the storm he was about to unleash. "Claire, listen. About K ..."
“Don’t.” Cas interrupted, lazily waving his hand up to stop whatever Sam had to say. “Just don't, okay? I'm not your brother, Sam. I don't have a drinking problem. I'm not constantly looking for the solution to my sorrows and fears at the bottom of a bottle. I'm well aware that alcoholism isn't a healthy coping mechanism.”
"And what good is that going to do, Dean? " Sam asked. "It's not like yelling at him for something he can't control is going to make it better. There's nothing we can do."  This wasn't how this was supposed to go. Dean's reaction was expected but he needed to let Sam explain. Cas wouldn't die until he was happy. He wanted to tell Dean that they didn't need to worry until everything was over. He had a fleeting thought that he should just let Dean go at it. It would definitely keep Cas from even smiling for a while if he just let his brother tear into him, but that wasn't fair. "Besides, we've already been over this. You think I didn't scream my damn head off at him when he told me? It's not going to do a damn thing but make things between you worse!"
“Yes.” Aziraphale replied. “With each other. Castiel did it on his own, before he even knew the heavenly father didn't care."
So, Crowley would visit him, if for nothing else but to see that he was, indeed, alive. It helped him keep from giving up. He let out deep sigh as he snuck passed the angel's door, so as not to interrupt the, rather melancholy, birthday celebration and made his way through the halls towards the library. Aziraphale sat at a long table, close to the door, surrounded by books containing information about various creatures. The demon sauntered in and plopped himself down in the chair next to the angel, letting out a long, drawn out sigh. Aziraphale kept his eyes fixed on the page in front of him, paying Crowley no mind. Crowley sighed louder, then, making a show of propping his elbows on the table, placing his chin in his hands.
“Oh, you didn't have to, Sam.” Aziraphale said, still not looking up from his book. “It's written all over your face. I've lived amongst humans for thousands of years, you know. I've learned a thing or two about them in that time.” Sam stared at him in silent shock for a moment, not really knowing what to say. “I suppose my only question is,” he finally set down the book and turning to face the hunter, “whether it is my personality that you seem to utterly abhor, or my nature. I can't change either, mind you, but if you were to ask my opinion, I have a feeling the answer is leaning a little more towards the latter, considering the variety of people you two seem to surround yourselves with.”
Crowley smiled back, hooking one long finger under the angel’s chin. "What do you say we go find you something to eat."
Anathema, Crowley, and Aziraphale sat around the table as Rowena fussed over the crate of witch's balls, explaining the uses and history of them to the group, so they could understand how they work. Sam left to set up a room for Kaia to rest in and heal any injuries she might have sustained from the rift. Which left Cas and Dean alone with Adam.
Sam took a deep breath and let his head slump back down to the table. As he let the air out, he felt the last little bit of hope he had go with it. This was it. After everything they had worked for, everything they had done, everything they had fought for their entire lives, this was it. This was the end. “Good for Dean then, I guess.”
"Oh, I will?" Chuck scoffed, and suddenly, Jack went flying to the side, only to be replaced by Cas a moment later.
Cas responded with a confused, angry glare. Dean was gonna have to remember to explain it to him later. " Okay, everybody load up." Dean said after clearing his throat. " Let's get this show on the road. Samsquatch here gets shot-gun so he don't crush anybody with those tree trunks of his he calls legs. Jack's gotta have a window seat since he gets car sick and I ain't having anyone yakking all over my Baby." He pointed between Mary and Cas. " So, I guess it's up to you two to decide which of you wants to ride bitch."
"Oh, goody." Cas said robotically, through a forced smile as he began gathering the plates. Sam had to try way too hard to bite back the laugh that almost escaped him.
Sam was stuck. She was their only chance to get his brother back. The only chance at lighting a fire back under Cas's ass and getting him back on board. Their only chance at having a chance and she has no reason to help. They had taken advantage of her too many times, just like everyone else they had come across. All she wanted was one good reason. “What about love?” He asked
"So, what you're saying is, I saved Cas while he was saving me?" Dean winked at the angel in question.
"Don't worry, Hunny." Cas chuckled. "You and I are still the most popular. On the entire internet actually."
“Really?!” Aziraphale gasped, looking over the book one more time before closing it. “You boys really have had to tangle with some nasty creatures, haven't you?”
"Dean." She scoffed before pausing and looking up at the angel "Does he...wait..what?" She looked up at him in confusion, while Cas did his best to keep his eyes both on her and the road. "Am I missing something?" She asked, receiving nothing but a blank side eye in return. "Are you missing something?" She chuckled, noting Castiel's confused expression remained unchanged and burst into another bout of laughter. "Oh, man this ride just got so much more interesting." She snatched the walkie-talkie off the dash and went back to searching the glove box. " Hey, Deano!"
Cas heard them moving through the hall, so he got into position. Waiting for his orders, like the good little soldier he was. It's all he would ever be.
“Really, though, we've put that child through enough.” Crowley said. “You tried to shoot him! We can't possibly ask him to do anything more than he already has!”
"It's suicide, Sam!" Dean shouts. "Maybe not for me, but you're sending Cas to his death! How can you be satisfied with a decision that is gonna kill someone that you call a friend? A brother!"
“I believe the girl may be right, Samuel.” Rowena said, looking around. “We’re playing with fire here. It might be wise to move this somewhere a little more secure.”
"I think anyone who has been on the receiving end of your brutality would share that sentiment." Rowena said bitterly, from the front of the line.
"Uh, no." Sam shook his head. "Actually, I have Charlie and Bobby on that stuff. She does well with weird and Bobby's got her back. They should be enough to weed that kind of stuff out."
Mary made an uncomfortable face and shook her head. " I don't think I'll ever be able to get used to some of that advanced technology. Makes me queasy. Besides, I want to spend time with both of you, so wat do you say?" she smiled.
“We need something of Dean's that holds sentimental value...” Rowena began before being interrupted by Sam saying “Baby” at the same time Cas said “The Impala”. “So that I can burn it and mix the ashes with the other ingredients.” She finished gravely.
"Yes, he was!" Gabriel piped up. "You dickwads were just too stupid to see it! You're the ones who fucked it all up!"
"Yeah," Dean chuckled, slumping further against the wall. "He's been a real little shit about it too. I think it's cuz it was the only thing he had on me. Demon's gotta do what a demon's gotta do. Can't even get the son of a bitch back with his relationship with Aziraphale because any time I do he just uses that as some fucking admission, which it's not! I don't....those two have been together since the dawn of time. Me and Cas ain't like that. Fucking asshole thinks he knows everything. "
Dean gave him a soft smile, trying his best to hide his own sadness. “That's Cas. He has a lot to be sad about. He lost his whole family. His home. Everything. A lot of it was my fault.”
As the guests started piling in, Sam and Dean began recognizing more and more faces. The ones who recognized them approached them the same way as Marie and Maeve had. Arms open and tattoos on display. The men asked them quick questions about their lives and shared a few stories of their own. Each of them marveling at the wonder that was Castiel. Dean had to admit, it was heart warming to see all these girls grown up and living their lives. He and Sam had done that. Had they not intervened, all of their lives would have been totally different.
"Crowley?" Dean smiled. "Yeah I do. He's a really good guy, Sam. He helped me out a lot when I was with them, and not just by letting me crash with him either. He's just misunderstood, is all. He's just a really cool guy."
Sam thought he was joking. A wink from his angel confirmed it. No one knew. Cas didn't tell anyone. He wouldn't. He was just playing along. Dean let his body relax and quickly elbowed Cas in the ribs. " Hey, fuck you buddy." Dean said, trying to sound more annoyed than terrified.
Kristen and Siobhan dropped Cas's hand and linked them with each other's "Yeah," Kristen says " We kind of figured as much."
The look on the seraph's face, knowing the cries were for him. Knowing that if the man succeeded in entering the battle he would surely be lost forever, but if he made the call to soon in order to save the man, it would be everything else that was lost.
"The protection sigils are fading too fast now." Sam groaned. "We can't risk her leaving. If she's gone too long and they fade we're screwed. Even if we did kill everyone here and collect their souls it wouldn't be enough. We'd still be stuck at square one."
“If you two are quite done playing kissy face,” Crowley called from the car, “I’d like to get on the road before rush hour! The M25 is a nightmare.”
“Yes,” Crowley said “I know she's beautiful. Now get in.” Dean nodded and reached for the handle, only opening it about an inch before the door was slammed back shut. “And just what in Satan's name do you think you're doing?!” Crowley growled beside him.
"As I said, the timing was extraordinary." Aziraphale continued as he put away his supplies. "A fraction of a second sooner and Amara would have been bested, most certainly. A second later and the Almighty would have broken free of us all, and well....anyway, when Castiel made the call, it was so desperate and loud, it confused the Almighty for a moment, causing him to pause, just long enough for the angels who were assisting Amara to finish their task. By the time he regained his senses Amara was already on the strike, along with the angels that were on reserve. Jack then let out some sort of sonic scream causing the Almighty in his weakened state to stumble backwards into the box, but just as Gabriel and Castiel began to lock him in, he let out a burst of power, the likes of which I have never seen! If it weren't for Amara's quick thinking in shoving the door closed just as the building began crumbling and Gabriel managing to get the lock closed just in time, he surely would have escaped."
"Oh." He said suddenly, his voice shattering the calm, despite his quiet tone. " Oh, no. Oh, dear...oh..."
When she left Dean, reluctantly chanced a glance in Cas's direction, who still had his eyes on Dean, eyebrow raised. “ I figured I can split my plate between you and Jack, since he loves tacos and what you ordered clearly won't be enough for you.”
" Coffee." Yhe three of the said in unison. She gave them a nod and told them she'd have it out for them in a jiffy.
Dean's eyes went wide in panic as he tried to think of some way to change the subject. "Yeah, man! Of course, you can help me out!" He said, a little too loudly. "I'll show you how to make...that thing...so you and Aziraphale can have it when you get home."
"Don't worry Dean." Sam huffed. "He's not dead. Though I'm pretty sure he wishes he was. I don't know where he is, but he's alive and, by my guess, pretty fucking miserable, so ..safe." Dean turned to Sam again, a million questions filling his eyes. "The Shadow told him it wanted him to suffer like it did when Cas woke it up. Said it wanted him to know what it was like to feel true happiness and peace, so it could be the one to rip it away. Guess you beat it to the punch."
"They said they wanted to speak with who ever is in charge now." Their demon guide said. Then the entire room burst into howling laughter. "Have at it guys." She smiled closing the door behind her as she left.
She stopped her pacing and turned on the angel, her face determined and hard. “How would you feel? Huh? How would you feel if your entire life was determined for you by someone you hardly even know? No room for error, no straying from the path, destined to do one thing with no say!” Aziraphale gave her a very unamused look. He was an angel, after all, that's all his life was. She pulled back a bit after remembering who she was speaking to, but kept on. “I didn't want to be just a descendant anymore. I wanted to be free of it all, have a life of my own. I knew that was impossible if I kept that damned book. So, I burned it.” She flipped down into a chair and covered her face with her hands. “It’s not like I had any idea something like this would happen. I just wanted to be my own person.”
It had been a little over six thousand years since his heart had made the right call. It was about time for another one.
"Oh, no!" She waved her hand in dismissal. "Of course! You two have been gone for a while and I'm sure you want to get home and rest. We'll have tea sometime and you can tell me all about it! Let me walk you to the door. I've had that spell that Rowena gave me protecting your car for you since you've been gone." She said as the three of them began walking towards the door, Newt following numbly behind, utterly dumbfounded. "I hope you don't mind I've had to keep it on the street. I was worried about someone crashing into it, being invisible and all, but that nifty little spell seems to have done the job." She opened the door and waved her hand, sure enough, revealing a black Bentley parked in front of their house.
Amara weaved her way down the Halls of the human home following the sounds she had come to learn was called music. To her it was simply noise. She listened as the pitch started high, lowering with a punch and reverberating, growing louder as she drew closer to the source. Soon she noticed another sound, in the form of words, not quite matching the pitch coming from the strange black box resting on the desk of the room she eventually found Dean in.
"Sam called Jody while you were in panic mode and I guess that triggered something for Patience. She saw you scooping up the hooded figure and her hood falling of and..." Her voice broke slightly, and she bit back some tears. "Yeah, I know. And I gotta tell you at first I was pissed. I hadn't felt so hurt or betrayed since..." She looked up at Cas with watery eyes, conveying what she meant without words. "But I get it you know. Getting Dean back and saving the world was more important than my stupid little crush."
“There's a good lad.” Crowley smiled. Not for the first time, he found himself to be glad he and Aziraphale had wasted their time trying to convert Warlock instead. The humans did a good job raising him on their own. “Your parents must be so proud.”
“Tomorrow morning actually. “She replied carefully. “I'm sorry do you mind telling me what this is regarding? He's not in trouble again, is he? Whatever he did, I promise...”
"It's so good to see you again, Dean." She said softly as he turned to face her, melting his entire resolve.
Cas tried to school his face and failed miserably before opting to gaze out the window instead. "While there do seem to be a few factions that agree with you, the general consensus is quite the opposite."
“I think that's enough questions for the night.” Crowley said, grabbing the empty plate off of the island with one hand and snapping it away with the other. “There's a guest room down the hall, to the right and the bathroom is to the left. There should be night clothes in the dresser and please try not to make a mess.”
"So." Aziraphale said after a moment of silence, looking on as Castiel stared in the direction that Dean and Crowley went off. He tapped his fingers over his legs and rocked back and forth on his feet, painfully aware of the tension winding around the other angel. "What about Gabriel?"
Cas turned to look at Sam, his face twisted with a mix of horror and disgust. "Yes, well I'll grant you your brother has had it coming for some time. However, you could have waited to make such comments until the three of us were alone." Cas smiled back.
“We don't know that yet.” Rowena shook her head. “Getting it in the orb was only half the battle. We have to make sure we can get it out before you start celebrating.”
"That's how it is then, is it?" Aziraphale sniffled. "Not satisfied until your big adventure is finished? Fine. I'll just go home without you." Aziraphale moved as if to walk towards the door when suddenly he was met with a face full of angry demon, snake eyes glowing with rage.
"Enough." Dean grunted. "Don't think I missed that shit earlier. Cas is my friend. Yeah, he's protective, but he always has been. Me and Sam are the only family he's got. He'll fight for us to the death if he has to and it goes the same way for us. Tell me you wouldn't do the same for Aziraphale?" Crowley raised his eyebrows at that, a wicked smile creeping up his face. Dean knew exactly what his mistake was, bringing up their relationship in parallel to him and Cas. "Shut up!" He groaned. It was a fight he wasn't going to win.
"But I may have a solution." She added. "One that works for everyone involved. Your world will be saved, and my brother will be locked away and you won’t have to concern yourself with me and my powers again."
“Dean.” He grunted. “Dean Winchester. I'd shake your hand, but I'm a little tied up at the moment.” He said, tilting his head behind him gesturing to the handcuffs.
Anathema's head snapped back to Adam to make sure she heard him right and back to the men when she didn't see the lie on his face. Dean just smiled and waved at her awkwardly. “Adam, why don't you go inside and make yourself a sandwich or something while I talk to you're new alien friend.” Adam nodded happily and shuffled inside. Anathema checked to make sure he was safely in the kitchen, before closing the door behind her and turning an inpatient gaze to Dean, Aziraphale and Crowley. “Alright, now perhaps one of you can tell me what's really going on here before I make you all regret even looking in that boy's direction.”
Sam let out a gentle laugh and shook his head. "Believe it or not it was actually a total coincidence. we had just finished up a job a few towns over when we stopped for lunch and ran into Marie."
"I owe you guys everything. You're my family, and you always will be, but this is something I have to do. You raised me to believe that we do whatever it takes to help the world. Let me do this. Please?"
"Cas... please..." he whined desperately trying to move. The angel's own erection pressed against his leg wasn't help the situation, either."
The guys settle down for the night and watch their movie. A conversation with Cas causes Dean to relive all his regrets.
Jack and Mary were sitting on Baby's hood, scrolling through pictures on Jack's phone and Sam was nowhere to be seen, not that Dean cared the second he laid eyes on Cas. He was leaned up against the passenger side door, looking down right sinful. He was wearing the leather jacket Dean had acquired in LA (and kept because it looked cool as hell dammit) over a tight, dark, grey t-shirt Dean had forgotten he even owned. The jeans he had picked out wear one of Dean's favorite but he had to stop wearing them because they had gotten a little too tight. A problem, he didn't mind at all, seeing them squeeze the angel's form. His feet  were clad in the Chuck's he had worn back Flint, and we're crossed stretched out in front of him. His hands were tucked behind his head, ridiculously disheveled sex hair sticking every which way. The way his arms were pulled up caused the hem of his t-shirt rise just enough to show just the slightest sliver of skin above his pant line.
Cas's hand reached out and grabbed him by the wrist, stopping him. "You need to rest, Dean." He used his best authoritative tone, the one that sent shivers up Dean's spine and made him almost impossible to argue with. Almost.
It was a terrible lie, Aziraphale knew. It was clear that apprehension was not what was causing the seraph's sour mood. Even Sam was able to sense that.
Cas's face shot up to meet Dean's, his mouth a gape, his eyes wide as they searched the man's face for the lie. Knowing that there was none to be found, Dean closed his eyes, cringing against the pain when he saw the glimmer of hope in Cas's as he reached for Dean's face, preparing himself for what he knew was coming next.
"But...you..." Crowley finally stammered. " What about all that 'I dig chicks' nonsense you were spewing at me when we got here?"
They left the 'Dean Cave', everyone saying their separate 'goodnights' and headed off to their own separate rooms. Even Cas, much to Dean's dismay. Without so much as a word to Dean. He closed his door and went over to his dresser mind reeling. Had he done something wrong? Maybe he read the whole situation in the closet earlier the wrong way. Maybe Cas really did just see him as family. It had probably been years since the guy got laid, probably not since that fucking reaper. Maybe Dean had just confused him. That's why he really stopped when Dean got too excited, he finally came to his fucking senses.
After he had bathed himself, in what had to be the finest soaps and shampoos money could buy, he made quick work of getting himself dressed and cleaning up his mess before making his way back to the room. He placed his dirty clothes on a chair across the room and let himself sink into the luxurious king-sized bed. He drifted off considering the conversation he had with Crowley. He had never really put too much thought into the gender of angels and demons. The way John had raised him there were only two: men and women. Anyone who said different was just kidding themselves. Same with sexual orientation. Gay or straight. That was it. He never even thought about the fact that angels had been around before those concepts had ever been invented. The world was changing now too. More and more the lines between genders and sexuality we're becoming more blurred and widely accepted. Which was great! Dean loved that he was living in a time when people like Charlie, Cesar and Jesse, and all the others like them could be themselves without living in fear. He just...never thought about it. Not until he found himself in an odd in between area, but that was something he preferred not to think about.
"Besides the fact that he's her brother, and we'd be asking her to help trap him?" Sam scoffed. It wasn't totally outlandish. She might still harbor some ill feelings towards Chuck for locking her away. Hell, she might even jump at the idea to get some revenge...but still ..." She's chaos dude. She's the embodiment of destruction. We aren't exactly lacking in that area right now, I don't think it would help to being more in."
Dean turned around just in time to see Jack reach for the plate next to him on the counter. “Ah, no!” He said popping Jack's hand with his spatula. “ Mine. Yours is in the table. You had enough sugar yesterday.”
“ I know, “ Cas said “ but you require sustenance. Not to mention, your mother is leaving today and I would imagine she would be quite disappointed if you weren't present to see her off.”
The nausea hit Dean as soon as they landed, but it wasn't because of Angel Express this time. The streets of Reno were littered with corpses, human and monster alike, some of which had baked for weeks under the Nevada sun. Bile rose to his throat as the smell of death seared itself into his nostrils, while he surveyed the slew of bodies around them, in various stages of decomposition. He wasn't sure what was worse; the smell or the sight of the rotting, bloated corpses being preyed upon by the various scavengers of the desert. He barely suppressed a full-on gag as he witnessed a wake of vultures feasting on a particularly mangled carcass. He felt his knees go weak beneath him from the overwhelming stench, almost losing the entire contents of his stomach before he felt Cas place two fingers to his temple, dulling his sense of smell. "Thanks." He muttered, holding onto his stomach as he glanced up at the angel, relived that at least one of the puke worthy factors was taken care of.
The witch turned an angry eye to Dean. "Well, Winchester, you just efficiently sealed his fate! A horrible existence for sure, but after that little tantrum of yours, I'm sure it will be eternal."
Crowley used their connected hands to spin Aziraphale back into his chest. He hugged the angel's arms tight, hooking his chin over one shoulder as he spoke into his ear. "You underestimate me, love. I've already fixed all that mess."
"You almost got the entire universe destroyed because you couldn't trust me enough to handle it!" Cas growled back. "It's your own fault that we're even in this mess!"
"Hmm." Cas nodded thoughtfully, sliding his hand under Dean's shirt, along his side. "And other times?"
"I know you're going to miss them." Aziraphale smiled. “It’s fine to have friends Crowley, other than me that is. You're allowed to like people. It doesn't make you any less of who you are."
Cas looked at her, confused, then looked down at his clothes, pulling at the edges. " I don't understand. I assure you they are clean." He glanced back up to meet her eyes. "I feel comfortable with my attire."
"No, Dean." Sam said as Dean started to walk away. " That's not what I meant. We have to talk about..."
"Please!" Dean yelled, and Amara paused. She glanced at Dean with a confused look but kept her hold.
"Dean," Cas leaned over towards the hunter, eyes focused on Marie "who is this woman? Why does she know your names? Who told her about demons?"
"Hey, hey no!" Dean shook his head. "None of that. You got us out just in time. She was like one second away from toasting us both. You did good buddy. You did good."
Dean didn't notice Rowena shuffle passed as he practically ran across the room to pull Cas into a hug. He couldn't hear the others speaking around him as he sobbed his apologies into the angel's shoulder. He wouldn't care even if he did know what they were saying. He had almost lost his best friend, yet again, without the guy knowing how sorry he really was. “I'm sorry Cas. I'm really sorry man. I didn't mean it. Any of it. I fucked up so bad. Please forgive me?”
"My ego's fine, thank you very much!" Dean huffed. "I've just gone and put all of existence in danger again, given Crowley enough teasing material for the next five centuries and effectively killed my best friend. I'm just peachy!"
So this chapter was super important for me to write. I needed Dean to realize that not all forms of love, outside of family love, are inherently sexual. That it's possible to be madly in love with someone without wanting to jump their bones all the time. I also needed him to understand that the concept of gender has ( almost) nothing to do with sexuality. Love is love. No matter which way you slice it. The world is changing and learning to accept the fact that gender and sexuality aren't black and white concepts ( hi! I am a proud member of the grey here) for some reason I needed crowely to be the one to help him understand that.
"Dean, stop!" He didn't even know the full story yet. If he got to Cas before Sam could finish telling him...
“I know what they've been doing, what we've been doing seems cruel, but Dean....you really scared us. Sam and Castiel are doing everything that they can to keep you...to keep you YOU.” Mary gave him a sad smile. “ If that means pissing you off or making you uncomfortable, then so be it. They love you, we all do. You have done so much to save all of us. It's time you let us do the same, even if you don't like it.”
“What do we need?” Asked Sam, trying his damnedest to keep the tension between the two of them to a minimum.
She shuffled through the pile, looking at each one carefully, before plucking one from the stack and handing the rest back to Sam. “This one of Mary should do perfectly. It's bound to be fresh in his mind given her recent...” she paused, giving Castiel a weary glance “.... departure.”
"If that's a fancy way of saying I like Star Trek, then yeah." Dean shrugged. "Spock had a point. I don't like sacrificing good souls any more than the next guy, but we don't really have any other choice here." He turned his sad, broken eyes to Amara and nodded again. "So, do it."
He had worked so hard. He had suffered for so long. He had done everything that was asked of him for most of his life, only disobeying when his orders seemed unjust. He was faithful, he did what needed to be done. He had fought through hell for forty years to rescue the righteous man, to rescue the world from destruction. He fought against Heaven and Hell to keep humanity safe. He did what was right. He did what was good. He fought for choice. He fought for love.
Cas dipped his head, looking at everything but Dean. "Jack. He brought me back from the Empty when he put the world back in order. He needed help rebuilding Heaven and thought I would be the best candidate. He also said he missed me, and that I shouldn't have had to die. So…" he pulled his hands out of his pockets and opened his arms, before letting them fall back to his sides, still refusing to look at, Dean."
She turned on her heel and made a  motion for Dean to follow. Perfect. now he didn't have to make an excuse. As soon as they turned the corner they stopped and faced each other. "Okay, listen." They said in unison, shocking each other.
“ Alright, mom.” Dean smiled as he watched her walk out of the kitchen. She had really gotten better at being a mom to them since she came back. It was difficult for all of them at first, but Dean feel that he was finally grateful to have her back in his life. If it wasn't for their talks this last week, he may have never realized how much Cas truly cared for him. Dean was snapped out of his thoughts quickly when he heard his brother groan.
"You know we're real people right?" Dean said, trying to keep an even voice but still reeling from the discussion earlier. " You guys don't think it's a little weird loving a series about real people? You know, people you've met. In real life. You didn't think maybe it was weird to keep reading about our actual lives?"
Cas's jaw clenched tight at Sam's words, as he moved dangerously close into the hunter's space. "Now is not the time for these petty arguments." He snarled in Sam's face. "We have more important matters to attend to. "
"Easy now, dearie." Rowena said, placing a gentle hand on his chest to guide him back down. "You've been properly banged up rather recently. It's really best that you get some rest." She stood up and placed the bowl on the night stand before smoothing down the front of her silken gown.
"That's something coming from an entire army of demons afraid to disobey one measly little human." Crowley barked out, fed up with the display.
"Very, well." Aziraphale nodded, tilting his head towards the door. "Call us if you need anything, Dean. We're here for you." He grabbed Crowley by the sleeve and pulled him out of the room, closing the door behind them. What else could they do. He knew the pain of losing his best friend because of things left unsaid. There wasn't going to be anything they could say to make the human feel any better in that moment. There was only one person who had the ability to do that now. It wasn't until they had managed to make it halfway to the library when he realized something. He pulled Crowley back and pressed him against the wall placing his hands on either side of his face before pressing his lips to the demon's.
“You know, I've always kinda wondered...” Dean said from the back seat. “Who are Moey and Chandon anyway?”
Dean groaned, his joints and muscles creaking in protest, as he jumped down from the snowplow. It had made the journey back easier, for sure (they were able to make the trip without stopping for the night, at least) but it still came with their fair share of fights. The population of actual humans was shrinking rapidly, with each passing day, leaving a slew of new monster behind. At this rate, he wasn't sure if there'd be enough humans worth saving if they waited too much longer. He held his hand out to Donna to help her down from her seat, Crowley falling in behind them, as they made their way over to the Impala, shivering in the early morning air. They had to park the snow plow a mile or so away from the entrance, due to the amount of vehicles crowded around out front, and none of them were in the shape to be walking that far, so Cas had followed them to a safe parking area so they could all ride back together.
"A bit, yeah." He replied, weakly, pulling the door closed behind them. It turned out that, once again, everything he knew about life was dead wrong.
There had to be a way to get a way to get Dean back. There wasn't another option at this point. He couldn't let either of them suffer like this. But Cas was right. It was hopeless. Jack was gone. The archangels were all dead. Even if they weren't there was no way to be sure they could even get to the right universe in time. Everything was over. There was nothing they could do. There was no one else who could possibly open a rift...
"I don't care." Dean said firmly, finally turning to look his brother in the eyes to make sure he understood. Sam would be fine. They had a family now, people to look after. Sam had hunters to train. He could go on, finally be his own person. Be the man, the leader, he was always meant to be. But Dean? This was it for him. He had wanted out for so long. He deserved the life he wanted too. He had spent almost forty years taking care of everyone else. He wanted his life back, he wanted his life period, but the thing was, this was it for him. Cas was it for him. And without him...
“Of course, it's complicated!” Crowley said. “Everything’s complicated. Humans are complicated. Even you, as hard as that is to believe.”
Sam cleared his throat and put his fork down “ Uh, Dean I think you might still be a little drunk from last night.” He chuckled.
Once every one was out of earshot, Crowley finally turned to face Aziraphale with a sheepish grin on his face. “What?”
“Ow!” he laughed, rubbing the spot she hit. “ Sorry, you set yourself up for that one.” They both laughed for a while before stepping in for another brief hug. “I love you mom. Be careful, okay? Call is if you need anything and please let me know when you make it back.”
" Hate to break it to you, mom, but if skeeball is what your after, the only ass that's getting kicked is yours. I spent a lot of time in places like this growing up." Dean shrugged. He quickly glanced over the place again, hoping Mary would assume it was for emphasis, finding Cas a jack had moved on to some version of whack-a-mole. He hated that he felt relief at seeing Cas's expression turn to frustrated concentration, as he attempted to throw his hammer at the tiny creatures. This was going to take some getting used to.
Dean hugged him right and ruffled his hair.  “Yeah you did pal! You really are the most powerful!” He let Adam go, shot up, grabbed the angel blade off of the table, tucking it into his belt and took a step towards the rift, but stopped. This was it. He was going home. He was leaving behind his new demon friend, the dorky angel, the pretty witch and the totally awesome Antichrist, to go home. To his angry brother, and a mourning best friend. To a world taken over by monsters, abandoned by God. No more comfy rooms or restful nights. No more luxurious meals or speeding through the streets of London as Queen blasted through the speakers. No more insightful conversations, no more playful teasing. Just home. Where all hope was lost. He took a deep breath and shook his head. He couldn't stay. Mad at him or not, his family needed him. Even if they didn't, he didn't deserve any better than they did. He deserved to die with them. That's how it had to be.
"So, don't lose her this time." Dean said. Sam dropped his head, tears steadily streaming down his face. Dean slowly got up, giving Miracle a final scratch before he made his way around the table, carefully sitting down in the chair next to his brother. He grabbed Sam by the face and pulled his attention up, looking into his eyes. "Eileen is perfect for you, Sammy. She's not like Jess. She's not Amelia. If you wanna keep hunting, you'd have a bad-ass partner by your side. She can handle her own. And if you don't, I'm pretty sure she'd be willing to settle down with you. Hell, you two could even stay here, set up a school, revive the Men of Letters. Make it what it should have been. You both have the knowledge and the experience. You could make it work."
"Don't get too excited." Crowley grumbled, licking the last of his Creme Brule from his lips. "Aziraphale just loves food in general. I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you." He winked.
"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. " Cas quoted with his eyebrow quirked. "I will not forget the things you have done, Dean. Not the good, and certainly not the bad. I will never forget the pain you have put me through, but if you think, for one second, that I can't forgive, then that just proves you haven't been paying attention. If being by your side these past eleven years has taught me anything, it is forgiveness. That is the most important thing I have learned from loving you. I will forgive you for almost anything, because that is what love is. If that is what you desire, then that is what I will do."
"And? That was two days ago! Kinda hard to talk to someone when they can't even be bothered to be around you in your time of need."
The demon flared red with shock and embarrassment as his eyes snapped up to meet Dean's "No one said anything about kissing." He snapped. "There was no kissing."
The smile fell off the angel's face as he turned around and marched towards the exit. “I hate you both.” He pouted.
Sam made a face that showed he understood why and nodded. "Actually yeah, good idea. We don't wanna roll in to a place for families with a guy who looks like he belongs in an empty house with Chris Hansen."
“ Dean.” Cas interrupted. Dean immediately snapped his mouth shut. He was pretty sure he had just royally fucked up.  The angel sighed and Dean could feel him shift on the bed. “In the spirit of total honesty, I feel that there is something you should know.”
"Of course not!" Aziraphale smiled moving from one Winchester the other. "We've learned such a great deal from you all, it would be impossible to forget you."
It was a quiet calm in the library as Aziraphale settled in his, now usual, spot next to Sam with his book on demonology. The previous day had been torrent of chaos and stress. A few of the hunters had given him a rather wide berth, as expected, but a lot of them, assuming him to be Sam's second in command, (mostly due to Dean's disappearance after his little chat with his brother) had questions about things he didn't know how to answer. Now that things had calmed down, he figured it was only right he learned about the creatures that were now to be partially in his charge, for the time being. He had offered to assist Sam in his organization of the hunters, but he made it clear his main focus would be on demons. He didn't want Crowley taking on more than he could handle by himself, after all. It was a nice feeling, though quiet tension hung heavy in the air, with the worry of Dean's mission filling them all, it was almost peaceful. That was until a static of ferocious energy sucked all the air out of the room, preceding the angel that stormed in after it.
“Well, I suppose this is where we take our leave.” Anathema announced, efficiently cutting off whatever Sam had to say. She grabbed an orb out of the crate and ushered Adam towards the rift.
The group saw Crowley wave them over with a confident smile as he slipped his glasses back on. "Alright guys, you ready?" Dean asked. "Cas?" Cas sighed and let himself disappear into the ethereal plane. "Awesome. Just keep a hold of my sleeve or something, so I know you're still with us, alright? Don't let go unless it's an emergency and keep quiet." Cas rolled his eyes and followed the other two to the door where Crowley was waiting. The four of them followed the other demon into the depths of Hell.
Oh. Oh, fuck. Is this what Cas felt like when Dean said that to him? Did he feel like someone had just ripped out his heart through his stomach, too? Probably not. Sure, he probably felt miserable, but he didn't deserve it then like Dean does now. That had to be what was making those words hurt so fucking bad. Or maybe it was having his own words thrown back in his face when all he wanted to do was make things better. Or maybe because...Cas stepped back then, turning away from Dean again and that's what made it worse. Cas hadn't been trying to beg forgiveness from the person he loved. He was trying to beg forgiveness from a friend and was denied it. So, yeah, Cas probably felt terrible when Dean said it to him, but at least he wasn't heartbroken. Dean wanted to yell. He wanted to tell Cas to go fuck himself. He just wanted to say he was sorry and Cas wouldn't let him....but then....he wouldn't have known to use those words if Dean hadn't done the same to him. So, did he even have the right to be angry? The answer was simple. No. Cas just gave him a taste of his own medicine...and it wasn't easy to swallow at all.
“Stop!” Sam screamed as he lurched forward. Rowena pulled him back and shook her head, warning him not to interfere. The twin screams rang out again. “Stop! Cas, please you're gonna kill her!” He pulled forward again.
"Your friends!" Rowena huffed. "I never claimed any kinship with the likes of them. Most of the people here would like nothing more than to see my head on a platter! They've hunted my kind for years. We might as well put them to use!"
Dean swallowed again, and closed his eyes. "I told you. Jack's sacrifice, Cas's…they mean nothing if we don't  try to live the best lives we can. We owe it to them to try."
"Crowley isn't at all like he seems." A soft smile spread across Aziraphale's face. "He was an angel once." Cas's head snapped back up with a curious expression. " From what Dean explained, it works very differently here, but in our world, demons are merely fallen angels. Those who followed the Almighty got to stay in Heaven, while those who followed the Adversary were cast down along with him. But Crowley....wrong place, wrong time, wrong angels, I think. He's chaotic for sure, and mischievous to say the very least, but I promise you, he's a far cry from evil."
"I'm just trying to understand here Dean." Sam let out a mirthless laugh. "Why is it one minute he's dead to you and the next you can't function without him? You know, why is it that you're the only one who gets to hurt him? You get to yell at him and hurt his feelings over and over, but the second anyone else lifts a finger against him he's suddenly this fragile thing that needs you to protect him?"
“Excuse me?” Cas replied. He actually had the nerve to sound offended, which only served to piss Sam off even more.
"I'm done being his pet." The angel snarled. "Let him worry. I doubt he even did. If anything he was just concerned that he lost a weapon. That's all I am to him anyway. I know that now. "
i had alot to unpack, alot to describe and i wanted to get it all shoved in because we are actually nearing the end here.
Cas's head shot up to glare at Dean for all of two second before his expression faltered. He went from wrathful, to sad, to expressionless so quick that Dean almost missed it. "I apologize for wanting to make your lives easier. I should have been considerate of your concerns and perhaps let you know I had returned before I came home and fixed what was broken. Forgive me for wanting to set things right and placing the needs of humanity as a whole above relieving, what may or may not have been, a little grief on your part."
"No!" Dean practically shouted, attracting the attention of a few patrons. There it was. Now he remembered why they never told Cas about this case. He made a point to scoot away from the curious Castiel and lowered his voice. "No. It's not a 'thing'! No 'thing'! You got that?!"
Dean decided right then and there that he needed to go find a bar to pickup a chick that night. The way The angel winked at him should not be exciting him that much. It had been waaaaay too long since he had banged it out with some random floozy. It was the only explanation as to why he could feel his face heating up. "Please stop, Cas...." he begged.
"Yes I do!" Dean yelled. "You've given up everything to fight for us! Why won't you let me do the same?!"  Castiel stood silent, and swallowed hard, the sound of footsteps running down the halls lending an eerie ambiance the feeling of hopelessness falling upon the room. "You're bleeding." Dean said nodding toward Castiel's hand. "Aren't you going to patch that up." He could feel the wet streaks streaming down his face.
"So ..." She pursed her lips and crossed her arms, rocking back and forth on her feet. " Special mission, huh."
Rowena grabbed her by the shoulder and pulled her back. "Don't worry, dearie. It doesn't matter now. "
Another fun fact: seraphim actually rank higher than archangels in theology as they are they ones who sit by the throne. With six firey wings no less. So if the show followed actual theology, Cas could take down all the stupid archangels (Gabriel excluded) all by himself.
All at once nine years of similar  phrases starting flowing through  the hunter's head like a flood of clarity.
"Sam, look." Dean sighed. " I know okay. I know we got some stuff we need to get off our chests. We all do. It's been a long time coming a frankly I'm surprised we haven't spontaneously combusted with all this pent-up bullshit. We got stuff that we need to unpack, but now isn't a good time. I got a lot on my mind right now and I don't have time for 'sappy family time hour with Dean and Sam."
Sam was left to himself, completely bewildered by what had just occurred. Dean had certainly not been acting like himself, but this was a whole new level. Maybe there was some truth to Charlie's words? Maybe he really was just scared? Maybe Sam really didn't know everything about his brother. Now, wasn't the time to think about that, though. Dean was right, the had to look for Kevin. They had work to do. Research.
To be honest I'm actually kinda struggling with the chapter I'm currently working on (I'll explain later when the time comes) so in the grand scheme of procrastinating, I figure uploading another one today would be a nice distraction. So heads up...
"Ha! Yeah, okay." She laughed. "Whatever you say." She started walking down the hall, so they followed her. "Fuckin Winchesters." She mumbled under her breath.
"They have suffered enough by your hand." Cas continued, without sparing a glance at the two of them so as not to draw attention as the tried to make their escape. "I will not let you harm my family again. We can do this the easy way, or the hard way, Father, but you will leave them out of it."
Dean froze, panic washing through him. He had told Crowley to drop it, even accepted that he would keep teasing him regardless, but now he was dragging Cas into this bullshit. The guy wasn't exactly the most knowledgeable when it came to human behavior. He has gotten better for sure since they first met, but there were still a few holes here and there. What if Crowley managed to convince him that Dean had some weird crush on him. He didn't need that awkwardness. He and Cas were finally getting back on the right foot but circumstances were shaky at best. Anything could tip the scale one way or the other and a demon telling Cas that Dean had feelings for the angel that Dean swore he didn't was definitely something that could mess with that balance. "What the hell are you two talking about?" He demanded, glaring daggers at Crowley.
"Hey, I'm just warning ya. Don't let the Holy Tax Accountant look fool you. Cas is not to be fucked with." Dean shrugged.
"And Castiel." Aziraphale said moving in front of the seraph before tipping his head. "It has truly been an honor to fight by your side. I only wish the angels of our world were half as noble as you."
"I sent you the link to the website I used to read the books." Charlie said as she zipped up her bags. She slung her backpack over her shoulder crossing her arms as she stared him down. "I know you lived through it all and everything, but not every part was about you. There's a few things you may have missed."
"Both of us of course. But it's too late for that now. You let your sympathy for these creatures make you weak." He pressed his lips into a tight, barely believable frown as he raised his free hand, letting the power build around it. "And now you left me with no choice but to end you too...."
"No, Sam! Fuck him!" Dean was near hysterics at this point. "Don't you get it? Jack lied too! He knew what Cas did and he didn't say shit! Worse! He watched Cas trade away his life for him and still burnt it away! He knew what was at risk and it's like he didn't even care! How can you still be defending that kid?" Sam shrunk back a little. He hadn't even thought about that. "Face the facts Sam, that kid was the biggest fucking mistake we ever made. He was the son of Lucifer for Christ's sake! He was trouble from the get-go, and I should've killed him when I had the chance."
"That's what I'm trying to do." Dean said Carefully. "I'm trying to move on. I want us to have the lives we deserve."
"As much as I am loath to admit it," Aziraphale explained, “given what we've seen as of late, I do believe it's safe to say that the Almighty might not be the best judge when it comes to what is good and what isn't."
Dean stood there, speechless. If he wasn't already feeling like shit about himself, that definitely would have done the job. The worst part was, she was absolutely right. Every single bit of it was true. All it did was strengthen his resolve. He needed to find Cas and beg his forgiveness, but he wouldn't be asking Claire. She had enough to deal with. He watched and she swiped the angry tears from her face and turned to leave. He wouldn't stop her this time. What did stop her though, also stopped Dean's heart.
"Not a chance, hot shot." Dean said. "You can easily just mojo yourself clean. Some of us actually need soap and water. We ain't waistin any on you!"
"I thought you were omnipotent, Charles." Rowena said, stepping forward. "You would have known what Castiel was going to do. Why come for him now instead of before?"
“No, I didn't say that.” Dean defended. “I have mad respect for Freddie. He was a phenomenal musician. Way beyond his time. Just not really my style, ya know...” He shrugged. “Mind if I...” He asked gesturing towards the stereo system.
“Yours?” Dean knew it was his own fault. He let himself be distracted the whole day before and now he was suffering the consequences of too much thinking and not enough eating. “Couldn't you just zap the hunger away?”
"You know..." Aziraphale said, finishing off the rest of his tuna wrap. "Your brother talked at great lengths about you as well, in his time with us."
“Well, there was also Jack. “Dean offered. He felt another pain of loss wash over him at the mention of the kid's name. It was like rubbing salt in an open wound.
Sam sighed, rubbing his eyes with his forefinger and thumb before shaking his head and taking a sip of his tea. "Yeah I figured as much." He grumbled before clicking through a few pages.
"Whoa now!" Garth chuckled " you telling me Dean willingly went off with a demon? This really is the end of the world."
Cas wrenched in pain again, tossing his head back and forth over Dean legs. "I'm so sorry, Dean. I should have never put you in that situation. I'm sorry." He let out a wet cough, wincing with every movement.
"Yes, it was something your brother gave to him." Crowley waved it off, like he found it to be nothing.
Aziraphale sighed and shook his head. “As you can imagine, I am not exactly in good standing with Heaven, at the moment. I doubt they'd do anything I would request from them. They'd be more likely to try to kill me than anything, for even suggesting such a notion, I'm afraid.”
"I didn't say anything!" Crowley snapped. "I went to his room, saw him fiddling with that ridiculous mixtape, tried to strike up a polite conversation, which was going decently enough, until Dean showed up. Then for some reason he got his feathers in a ruffle, threw the damn thing down, and stormed out. I'm as confused as you!"
"Yeah, yeah," she dismissed, with a wave of her hand. "Daddy threw a tantrum and you want to knock him down a few pegs. You can explain the details later, but first...." She slid around Cas and began circling Jack,
"Looks great, Sam." Marie said as she entered the foyer, setting her trays down on the nearest table. "Thank you."
"Jesus…" Sam huffed. It was hard to hear. The Winchesters had set the example of self sacrifice and Castiel had followed in their foot steps in the worst kind of way. "What….what did he have to do…to make it feel like he had suffered enough?" Sam felt sick. It was bad enough that Dean had to watch his best friend die, again. It was bad enough that Dean had been alone when it happened, but the thought of Dean having to watch Cas suffer as he died, suffer, in order to save Dean's life…it was a wonder Dean wasn't a complete wreck.
Sam was pacing back and forth across the Bunker's library. He wasn't sure if he was more pissed or worried at this point. On the one hand, he had kept this major secret from them, knowing, that at any point, he could just die, and they would never know what happened. He lied to them and, although that was nothing new, he had dragged the kid into it too. They worked so hard to make sure Jack didn't turn out like his father and yeah, they lied all the time, about who they were, what they did for a living, but that was part of the job. They didn't lie to each other, at least....they weren't supposed to. Then, on the other hand....
Sam turned to her and gave her a sad smile, before signing "I know." and taking the baby from her, to bring him inside. Maybe she was right. Jack was God now. Sam had faith that he had fixed Heaven. That's where Dean would have gone with Jack in charge. Dean was in Heaven, he had to be.
"See," he managed to fake a chuckle. "not so funny now, is it? Two can play at this game, pal." Yep! He definitely broke the angel, as if he needed another reason he was going back to hell. Cas still hadn't moved. "What's wrong Cas? Did I make you uncomfortable? Offering you something you don't want, or can't have?" He smirked, repeating the angel's words back to him. Surely, that would get a reaction out of the guy. And it did. But not the one Dean expected at all.
Dean smirked and quirked an eyebrow, glancing between the two of them. “Strap in fellas, I got a hell of a story to tell ya.”
"I'm an angel, Dean." Cas said. " We were created before the concept of time. I don't have a 'birthday'." And damn, those stupid air quotes.
"Last night." Aziraphale answered the unfinished question. "Sam came to me and told me Castiel had suffered a few injuries and asked for my assistance. The physical damage was nothing too terrible, but he certainly looked like Hell. Happy is probably the last word I'd use to describe the state he was in." Dean jumped up from the bed and immediately moved towards the door. He had to go see Cas, he had to apologize, he had to do something. If only Crowley wasn't blocking his way.
Castiel leaned even closer, his sharp nose a mere inch from the witch's. “Bring him back, now, or I will disintegrate you and find someone who will!”
And that would've been encouraging. It would've been the point where he smiled and pulled her into a hug and thanked her again before he went off to wait for the other hunters to arrive so he could reorganize them before he found Aziraphale to get some work done on their plan. It would have been...if he didn't hear Cas's voice echoing through the halls.
"Well, I certainly hope you're proud of yourself! " Aziraphale chided and he pulled Crowley from Amara's returning strike. "Just look what you've started!"
Dean looked down at himself and pouted when he saw that Cas had put his shirt and boxers back on. "How come?"
Dean swallowed hard. It took a lot to make Cas even look like he was crying. He couldn't imagine what must have triggered such a reaction. "Yeah. We did. Thanks." He forced a smile on his face, hoping to put one back onto the angel's. "Man, what did you do all that time anyway? While you were waiting for our 'appointment'?"
"You need to find Amara!" Sam shouted, finally at the end of his rope. "She's the only thing powerful enough, that we know of, that even stands a chance against Chuck!"
“Wicked!” Adam exclaimed in awe as he stepped further into the bunker from the portal. “A real-life alien planet!”
“Is it always like this with them?” Crowley asked, leaning into Sam as they all stood and watched the exchange from the other side of the room.
"What about your happiness?" Sam asked. "You say you want me to find Eileen and make a life for myself. What about you?"
" 'fraid not. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to doing nothing." Crowley turned on his heel and walked away. "Nice to see you again Castiel," he called over his shoulder "give your boyfriend a kiss for me, would you?" And with that he was gone.
"Take your time." He called back taking another sip of coffee. He supposed he could wait a few more moments. It wasn't like he could properly describe what he was seeing and it's not like he felt they were in danger or anything. He spent another minute or two wondering if maybe his eyes really were playing tricks on him, until something appeared out of the light. "Ana?!" He called again, a little more alarmed than before.
"Hmmm." Crowley hummed in agreement as he moved his head to nuzzle the back of Aziraphale’s neck. "I told him I was much more likely to fall for him, given my preferences." Aziraphale tensed up and Crowley snickered placing a soft kiss to the base of his skull to calm him. " 'm only joking. You're more than enough angel for me."
The weight of Cas's words could have caved in the entire bunker. It was one thing to hear profanity slip from the angel's lips. Despite everything, he was still an angel. On the rare occasions he did curse, Sam was sure the worst he had ever heard Cas say was bitch. Beyond that, he had never said anything that hadn't been used in the Bible itself. Ass butt was the worst insult he had ever allowed himself to use. Hearing him drop the F bomb would have been jarring enough, but to hear him say it in reference to the state of the world....
Aziraphale sighed again and shook his head, making his way towards the door. "Sometimes ignorance, Dean, can be just as deadly as arrogance. It would do you some good to keep that in mind. For future reference, of course."
Dean caught himself against the support beam, taking a steadying breath before launching himself once more at the vamp with all his strength. The vamp pushed back and caught Dean off balance. He stumbled back a few steps trying to regain his footing, but it was useless. Instead of gaining any ground, Dean found himself toppling backwards, his body meeting the ground before he had time to blink, causing the creature to trip over him and fall, face first, into a piece of re bar sticking out of the post with a sickening crack, as it pierced the ridiculous mask and stabbed it between the eyes. Dean got to his knees and flipped around just in time to see Sam slice through the bastard's neck, its body falling to the ground while the head remained stuck, its blood soaking into the wood and dripping onto the dirt below.
"I thought of that too." Sam replied, still clicking through the pages. "I don't want to risk either of them getting hurt or worse. Reversing it isn't an option as far as I can tell."
“And now we're out.” Cas said, finishing off the last of the bottle. “Of liquor too it would appear.”
"Please, Dean?" The angel's face shifted from fierce to pleading so quick it caught the hunter off guard. "I watch every movie you ask me to, without so much as a complaint. Every. Single. One. I'm simply ask that you return the favor. Please?"
“I’m sure that isn't true, Dean.” Aziraphale assured. “They seem to care about you very deeply.” Dean just grunted in response. “Enough, sulking. What shall we do now? We have the rest of the day ahead of us.”
Okay, so Dean had a thing about seeing other people in his clothes. It was hot! It expressed a level of intimacy he rarely ever shared and honestly, it drove him up the wall. Nothing used to get him ready to roll quicker than seeing Lisa or Cassie walk in wearing nothing but one of his band shirts and some panties. But seeing his clothes on Cas....if it wasn't for the sound of his brother walking up behind him, he would've been on his knees, dragging his tongue over that exposed bit of skin in a heartbeat, present company be damned. He was still considering it (he could pretend that Cas forgot to tie his shoe and offer to 'help him out') until he felt Sam slap him on the shoulder on his way to the car, knocking a little bit of sense back into him.
"Anyway, Gabe's right." He repeated, sitting in a chair on the opposite side of the table, next to Amara. "You're powerful as shit Amara, but that power is dark. As much as you might have changed you can't help who you are. Heaven is not the place for you."
“Alright, enough!” Sam said. The two of them turned to face the younger Winchester. His face was tired, his eyes were red and weary. He looked like he had aged ten years from that morning, yet his voice made him sound so young and small. “She's right, Cas.” He shook his head and ran his hands through his hair. “That was the last of Gabriel's grace. Unless he's somewhere playing dead again, or if there's another archangel left living that we don't know about, Cas, he's gone, and we can't get him back.” He crossed the room and plopped down in a chair across the table from them. “You know what, maybe he's better off.”
"She's the only defense we have right now!" Sam argued. "If she drains herself and it's still not enough, we don't even have a plan! If we could just get Billie to..."
“A witch?” Dean grimaces. There were very few things Dean hated more than witches. He had only recently gotten used to Rowena being around, he wasn't sure about trusting another one.
Cas simply rolled his eyes before snapping his fingers, returning to his normal holy tax accountant look, stupid trench coat and all. He held out his arms and let them fall back to his side with a clap. "Better?" He asked.
Okay, so let me explain something. When I get stuck on something it's bad. And I end up babbling on until I can pull myself out of the hole. Basically this chapter was gonna stop in a certain spot, then I realized that I had completely neglected one of the main characters, therefore it got longer, and because of that one little bit I added I have to now write an additional part to this story that was never intended and work what I already have planned around that. This thing was supposed to end like a chapter or two after Dean got home, but because I keep writing myself into corners, you lovely readers are being submitted to my ramblings far passed that. I apologise.
Cas turned to face his friend, tears pooling at the corners of his eyes. “I didn't mean to do it, Sam. I didn't mean to...” Cas swallowed passed the lump in his throat and stared back at the empty space that was once his best friend. While it was true, he didn't mean to toss Dean into the rift, he did fully intend to push him away. Not just physically either. Things between them had been getting worse lately. Even before his father decided to prove he was the cruel, capricious God he claimed himself to be when they first met him, all those years ago.
Dean ignored him and made a grab for the phone. "I've gotten pretty good with these things lately. I'm pretty sure I can..."
"I don't know, man." Dean forced a laugh, trying to lighten the mood " Maybe because you're my friend and you're upset? You're pretty much acting like the biggest sore loser in the world right now."
"What are you talking about?" Aziraphale demanded, finally wrenching out of Crowley's grasp and coming to a full stop.
"I can't believe this!" Dean spun around and started marching towards his room. "I'm not dealing with this anymore!" And with that he was gone.
Sam rolled his eyes and pulled his final shot away from Cas's clutches. The angel was clearly going through something more than he was leading on. "Alright, then uh...what exactly do you look for in a girl Cas?" Sam asked, realizing he had never really given his friend's romantic  interests much thought. Not with women anyway. "What, uh...what do you find attractive ?"
"Ready as I'll ever be." Dean said as they started to file out towards the garage. "Cas, ya comin?" He called behind his shoulder when he realized the angel wasn't right beside him.
“Samuel...” Rowena tried to chide. It didn't come out right, though. Her voice sounded as tired and hopeless as Sam felt.
“Seriously, I'm not a shopping kind of guy. I'm good.” He whispered to Crowley on their way out behind Aziraphale.
“Love?” Crowley scoffed. “Love?!” He pretended to be offended, but somehow, Dean could sense the sarcasm in his voice. “Whatever do you mean by love? Do you mean Eros? Hmm? Philla? Storge, ludus, mania, pragma? Love is such a broad word. I'm afraid you're going to have to be more specific.” He reached over and grabbed three more fries.
"It sounds like an interesting activity to engage in." Cas added thoughtfully. " I have often observed humans at these 'arcades'. They always seemed to be enjoying themselves."
"I most certainly will not!" Crowley argued back. "Worst experience of my life. I wish we had never gone. I have never been happier to be home. I say good riddance. I don't care if I ever see them again."
"He's definitely more concerned about you than you think." Charlie said firmly, standing up as she did. She began packing once more, keeping her eyes averted from Sam's. "He's not trying to control you, you know. He raised you, Sam. You mean alot to him. You ever think for a moment that he's just really scared for you? Scared of losing you? I mean, back to my point, he is really bad at losing people."
"Yes." Cas said curtly, walking away faster, practically shoving Crowley and Aziraphale out of the way.
"Sam, either lay down and relax or I will do it for you." Cas said in a firm tone, still avoiding Sam's eyes. "I need to heal you and you are risking further injury if you don't..."
Sam hobbled down the hall to the guest room, his hand still  throbbing from knocking Dean unconcious . It was…worrisome, to say the least, that he was having this much trouble with healing from such a minor injury, not to mention the other things that were happening to his body; the fatigue, coughing up blood. Troubling, but, as much as he hated to admit it, worth it. Dean had been pissing him off more than usual lately anyway. It wasn't just the trials. Sure, he was frustrated with Dean for thinking he wasn't strong enough to handle them (he had fought against Lucifer in his own mind for christ's sake) but it was everything else too. His loyalty to Benny still didn't sit right with him. He had been so quick to kill Amy, just because she was a monster. He didn't care that she was just feeding her kid. She was just a monster to him. But for some reason, Benny got a pass. Sure, the guy saved both their asses, he was grateful for that, but even Bobby knew it was wrong.
“I don't know!” Dean said, throwing up his hands. “Can't you talk to your angel buddies or something? I'm sure they'd like to know what kind of dick their creator is. Maybe they could come up with something!”
"You coulda asked one of us to get your shirt for you." Dean grumbled as he stood. "You shouldn't be using your wings and stuff yet, dude. You’re still healing." He leaned over the bed and batted Cas's hands away to finish buttoning it for him. "Let me help you with that."
Both men raised their hands in surrender, still snickering. Dean started the car and threw it into reverse. He hoped that would be the end of this 'Destiel' nightmare for the rest of the day.
"You don't get to tell me what to do anymore." Cas snarled grabbing Dean by the arm and pulling him back in, another, weaker pulse surging through.
Aziraphale took a deep breath, still refusing to look up. "We have worked together since the beginning. He has done his demonic duties, to the minimum extent, but he has also assisted me in mine."
"Don't do that!" Dean practically shouted, shoving him away again. He knew Cas's grace had to be running low after everything that happened. There's no way he had fully recharged. He was gonna make himself sick trying to help Dean.
"Good one." Garth laughed, lifting his own drink to his mouth as he studied Sam's face. He scrunched his brow in confusion, lowering his glass marginally. "You're pulling my leg, right?" Sam just shrugged in response, finishing off his glass and pouring another. Garth slammed his drink back down. "Well I'll be damned." He said in an astounded whisper that slowly turned into a laugh. " You Winchester's, I swear. What the hell were you even thinking, man?
Dean just continued his string of confessions. "I used to be jealous of Sam, ya know. I hated him actually. He got to go off and be his own person while I was stuck being dad's personal
"Actually, we were just discussing that ourselves. " Aziraphale replied. " So, let's get started. What's our plan?"
"Cas, no." Jack choked. "That's not right! We can talk to Sam and Dean. They can figure something out. This doesn't have to…"
"Sure it is!" Dean offered. "Look at the world around us right now. There's plenty to get upset about."
The noise Cas made in response could only be described as a literal growl, the dim lights in the dark room flickering around them. "Cool it, Cas." Dean whispered behind him, pulling tighter on the angel's sleeve. Cas's head snapped back to glare at him, his eyes glowing with Grace. "Not the time."
"Oh." Castiel replied, a smile spreading across his face. "That is excellent news. Thank you." He stood up and stretched out, moving to grab his trench coat off the bed.
Dean placed his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair, smirking "Well, well, well. Did ya hear that, Sammy? Seems like our buddy over here is still a virgin."
"Then why don't you do something about it." Jody glared back. "I'm sure there's something in that book of yours that can ward off whatever you think is brewing."
"It's part of the reason I brought you back with me." Cas answered, smiling at her fondly (which did NOT make Dean sick!) "You are smart, and loyal, and strong. I trust you more than most anyone I've ever met. These are excellent qualities for a leader. I trust that you will not let the power get to your head and will rule over Hell with fairness, only taking the souls who deserve punishment, as it was meant to be."
Cas turned to Dean and tilted his head,  keeping a sarcastic smile on his lips, but only Dean could see the hint of lust behind his eyes. "Promise?"
"I'm done waiting for people to give me things." Cas smirked before raising his hand to Dean's cheek placing his face against the other. "I take what I want now." He growled into Dean's ear. Cas placed a gentle kiss on his cheek at the same time a small surge of Grace pulsed through his veins.
Crowley liked living on Earth well enough, but truth be told he could take it or leave it. More than once he has mentioned leaving it all behind, the two of them flying off into the stars and starting over somewhere new. He couldn't care less about Hell or his fellow demons, even less so about the other angels or Heaven. He enjoyed humans, as they always provided entertainment, but it wasn't their possible loss that he was mourning. Crowley wasn't attached to any of that at all. In over six thousand years, there was only one thing he cared about above it all. “Oh...” Aziraphale felt tears welling up in his eyes as well. “... Crowley....” a million thoughts flooded his mind of things he could say, things he should say, but the words died on his tongue when he saw a flash of light from the corner of his eyes.
" What are you going to do about it?" Chuck huffed. "I'm God! I am literal CREATION! You are nothing!"
The two of them laid like that for a while, clutched tightly in each other's arms. The room was dark, the only sound was their breathing. Eventually Cas pulled out of Dean(earning a low hiss in response) and rolled over beside him. He borrowed his head in the crook of the hunter's neck and swiped a hand over their bodies, cleaning them off with his grace. Dean wrapped his arms around the angel's shoulder pulling the blanket, that had gotten pushed off to the side of the bed during their escapades, around them.
"Is that what's got Dean so messed up." Garth asked, following Sam's gaze. "I mean, it's dangerous for sure, and yeah, the end is nigh, but it's not like y'all haven't been down this road before. I ain't ever seen him look like someone shot his puppy in front of him." He chuckled. "I mean good God, who died?"
Aziraphale couldn't help but smirk at the nervous tone in the demon's voice. He had been working with Dean in the kitchen over the past month, learning how to cook things the human way because, as Dean had told him (and as the angel always believed, himself), 'food tastes better when the person who makes it puts their heart into it. It's not the same if you just pull it out of thin air!' It was a simple sandwich, nothing fancy or over complicated, yet every bite filled him with a sense of pride and affection, just knowing that the demon had put in the effort to show how much he cared. "It was as good as the person who made it." He replied, using his napkin to dab the corners of his mouth.
"No!" Dean growled, shoving Sam off of him. "We're not leaving him behind again. I'm not doing that to him again, just let me grab Cas and we can..."
"Look, I'm not saying anything is definite, but alot of people who write fanfiction are really good at reading between the lines." She clicked her mouse a few times before closing her laptop and setting it back in her bag. "I mean, I've read all the books myself, and I totally know that you guys are real people and not some fictional characters, and it's completely not okay to speculate on your lives and feelings or whatever...but I mean, it's kinda hard not to see where they're all coming from."
He was right. They could sit there for days and go over every book in at their disposal ten times and still come up with nothing. Amara was the only surefire way they had any hope. "Dean's gonna hate this." He groaned.
“ That obvious, huh?” Dean said glancing around the table, to be met with four concerned faces. “Alright, I'm eatin.” he picked up his first taco and listened while the other's engaged in conversation. When the water came, he downed that too, before finishing the rest of his food in silence. He heard the laughter and lightness in his family's voices, but all he could think about was how big of a dumbass he was being.
The drive was spent mostly in silence. Cas and Sam chalked it up to Dean being in a pissy mood, which wasn't entirely wrong, but I wasn't 100% true either. Dean had seen a couple things on one of the sites he scrolled through that he definitely had to talk to Marie about. He spent most of the way there trying to go through situations in his mind where he would be able to get her alone without his brother and best friend being suspicious.
“We took her from her world, Sam.” Cas's voice was as hollow as his face. “We may not have pushed her through, but we gave her the opportunity to leave. It was a dangerous place, but at least there she had a chance to stay alive. We took the only weapon she had to defend herself, with a promise to return it, and we lost it. She is out there alone and defenseless because of us, because of me. Had I not let Lucifer take over my vessel he would never have been able to walk this earth. He wouldn't have been able to impregnate Kelly. Jack would have never been born, the rift never would have opened, Michael would have never gotten through, it was all because of me. Had I just done my job, and pulled Dean out of hell and walked away... everything...all of it... it's all my fault.”
"I believe most women do carry small mirrors with them at all times to check on the status of their cosmetics through out the day. " Cas replied "I think they are called 'Compacts'."
"Then take me now." Cas said, his voice wavering, but full of rage. "Erase your mistakes and take me out of the equation because I promise you, if you don’t, I will continue to keep fighting against you to save my family."
"You heard me." Cas said, in a cold, ruthless tone. He stepped forward into Dean's space, his eyes calculated and dangerous. He hadn't looked like this since he backed Dean against Bobby's counter and threatened to throw him back in Hell. Dean wanted to retreat to run for the hills out of fear that the angel would snap his neck, but he couldn't. He was frozen as Cas moved his face not two inches from his own, his eyes and words burning holes into his soul. "Fuck. You."
It wasn't until the next morning, when the two of them finally decided to return home. Sam had spent much of the previous day meeting with the other hunters to explain his idea, brainstorming procedures and protocols that should be followed. Dean and Cas spent some time throwing in ideas of their own, along with talking to everybody about the new dynamic between them. Claire was happiest to hear about them finally admitting to themselves what had been brewing between them for years, and even though the idea had made her uncomfortable at first, she had learned to accept that Jimmy was gone long ago. She also admitted to them that she had spent some time with the other Kaia and was learning that she wasn't all that different from the one she knew. Kaia had decided to stay on their Earth, most of the people she knew back home were gone anyway, and she wanted to explore the newfound bond that was forming between Claire and herself.
He turned around to see the former reaper smiling, leaning casually against her scythe. "Billie." He nodded stiffly, resisting the urge to back away.
“Wait.” Kaia said. She swept her hand out in front of her, gesturing towards the room. “Here? Just out in the open like this, where any old body could just walk in? What if he's in some crazy monster filled world like mine, and he's not the only thing that comes through?”
"I found him!" Gabriel called over his shoulder before reaching down offering Cas his hand. "Up and at 'em baby bro, times a wastin."
“I've heard of them.” Anathema says. “They were used centuries ago to ward off evil spirits from homes. Now they're mostly used for decoration.”
Sam tightened his jaw and glared at the witch from across the table. “I'm not really in the mood for this right now, Rowena. And will you put that stupid fucking book down! You heard Cas! We're screwed! That thing isn't gonna help us!”
Sam began crying harder, fear swelling in his eyes. Dean pulled his brother to his shoulder and let him sob against it as he rubbed his back. "Hey, hey it's okay. It's okay. I know you're scared. I…I know it hurts. I know you don't wanna have you're heart broken again. I know you don't wanna let yourself love someone only to lose them…I…I understand, believe me I do. But sometimes you gotta take that risk. Sometimes you gotta put yourself out there. If you don't….life's too short to live it full of regrets. I don't want that for you man. You deserve to be happy. No one should live their lives not knowing what happiness is." He choked back his own tears as he held his brother, rocking him back and forth. "She makes you happy, Sammy. And that's all I've ever wanted for you. You gotta at least try. Please? I need you to be happy."
“Nah.” Dean shook his head. “If I'm being honest with myself, I've always kinda found guys attractive.  I just wasn't totally aware of the extent.”
"Good." Cas replied. "I'll go inform Sam." And then he turned away. Not hint of emotion, no smile of relief. Just a few short words and he was walking away.
Dean just shrugged and took another bite of his food. " Never took you for the judgmental type, Sam."
“Nothing.” Crowley said in a not so convincing tone. “Never mind. Here we are.” They screeched to a halt in front of the bookshop. “You can get out now. The sooner we go in, the sooner we can get you out of my hair and back to your brother and 'not your angel'.” He said as he practically pushed Dean out of the car.
The fact that it had been Dean that gave it to him probably attributed to his heavy analysis of the music. He wanted to learn everything about the band that the hunter loved so much. They were important to Dean, and Dean was important to Cas. Admittedly he had probably read into the whole thing too much. Dean probably just wanted something to listen to if he ever had to ride with Cas again. It was probably nothing more than an act of convenience for him, rather than an act of friendship towards Cas, but that didn't make it any less meaningful to the angel. He cherished the tape with everything he had, going so far as to carry it with him where ever he went, if for nothing else but to serve as a reminder of a time when Dean seemed to care.
Cas looked down at the loose clothing swallowing his frame before narrowing his eyes back up at Crowley. "Sam lent me some clothes while mine were washing. He is significantly larger than me. Forgive me for not having the foresight to be fashionable while waiting for my clothes to be laundered."
"Then you look terrible. Worst I've ever seen you. Seriously, I'd be embarrassed to be seen with you in public." Dean shoved past his friend to the door and opened it. "I'm going to get some coffee from the lobby, and a snack. I didn't get to finish my lunch." He plastered on one of his snarkiest smiles. "Can I get you anything? You must be starving?"
"Hey, Cas. I'm finished loading up so whenever you’re ready...." Dean paused, surveying the scene before him. Crowley was spread out on Cas's bed, looking oddly comfortable and weirdly suspicious, while Cas was standing, looking like a deer in caught in the headlights, fiddling with something in his hands. "Am I interrupting something?" He asked skeptically.
"Oh, because you know me so well, don't you, darling?" Crowley snapped back. "I'll have you know that I was more helpful in saving the world than you could ever dream of."
"Exactly!" Dean huffed. "And that 'bond' or whatever you want to call it, almost got all of us killed! She's got a hold on me! I can't stop it! Believe me, I tried, you know I tried! I can't do it! If things go sideways, she's got the upper hand!" He heard Cas breath in sharply behind him. He turned to see the angel's face consumed with fear, finally letting it click into place who the two of them were talking about. " We're not going, Cas. I'm not letting her take you again."
Cas squinted his eyes at her, tilting his head to the side, obviously confused by her question. “Very much so, yes.”
"Shut up and go get dressed." Dean chuckled, turning away to try to hide his smile. " I'm gonna wipe everything down before I get in the shower. I'll meet you in the garage, okay?"
Sam shook his head against the frame, trying to remind himself to stay calm. “Yeah, I get that, man and that's great. It was great to get Jack back and all but it wasn't worth losing you in exchange. It would've been messed up, but we could've figured something out eventually. That's what we do.”
“You could at least pretend to look like you're not giving up completely, Samuel.” Rowena chided, she flipped another page in the Book of the Damned, reading through it like she didn't already know every word forward and back.
Cas let out a small laugh. “Then, I suppose Dean's assessment of your powers being 'cooler' than mine, is correct.”
Kaia nodded and kept her mind focused on Dean while the image became clearer. “He's... he's in a house. He has people with him...there's a child and....AAH!” Her scream of pain echoed through the room, mixing with Cas's.
It was wrong. Cas knew it was wrong. He should to walk away or let his presence be known, ask what they needed him to do and leave so he could wallow in his pity alone.
The sounds of the bar flooded into the night air as the three of them walked into the building. The last time Dean tried to get Cas  laid hadn't gone over so well, but he was determined  to make it work tonight.
Cas's panicked scream was the last thing Dean heard before he was sucked through the portal and began tumbling towards the unknown. As he was tossed through the dimensions, a sick part of him couldn't help but think that it served the son of a bitch right! He thought it would be different now. This was the big one. The real end of the world, set in motion by God himself. All they had left was each other, and that asshole's first instinct was to leave them again!
"C'mon man," Dean sighed., " it's not like I go around telling every Tom, Dick and Harry that I like my Toms with hairy dicks." The angel and the demon made twin faces of disgust. "Okay, bad joke. What I mean is that it's not something I go around broadcasting, okay? I don't know about your world, but stuff like that's generally frowned upon here."
Sam was right of course. He had said that and, although the prospect of making some broad regret her life decisions did sound a little appealing, it wasn't nearly as good as the thought of continuing to explore what he had started with Cas. "Yeah, well, mom's only gonna be in town a couple more days." Dean explained. "I figure we might as well all spend as much time as possible together while we got the chance. I can get laid any day of the week. A few more nights won't hurt."
"I can't fucking believe you!" Dean said between cackles. “Really living it up to the legacy there, aren't you Sammy?" He fell against the wall with one shoulder, his breaths heaving. "Demon blood still coursing through those veins of yours?"
Marie just shrugged. " Well I couldn't have very well fit all these people in the dorms. That would've been a fire code distaster!"
" It's fine Sammy," Dean replied. He was trying to track his brain for all the times he had used the name "Smith" but nothing too serious came to mind. " She seemed to like us, so whatever it was, we couldn't have caused too much damage."
"They are people, Aziraphale." Crowley snapped. "In case you have forgotten, they're the ones who got us into this mess. It was people who made the world what it is today. Not angels, not demons; people!"
"He is your friend, Dean." Cas said. "I wouldn't let harm come to someone you care about if I am able to prevent it. You say that he is trustworthy. I trust you."
"It should be an exciting experience." Cas said thoughtfully. "I've never interacted with people who know me from my father's books."
Sam looked at him in disbelief. The bunker had a well-stocked liquor cabinet in case of emergency lock down, not to mention Dean's multiple 'secret' stashes around the place that Cas undoubtedly knew about. There had to be enough alcohol in the bunker to kill at least 10 seasoned alcoholics, and Cas had drained it all in a matter of hours? It was worse than he originally thought, and he knew his concern was evident on his face. “Cas, man, that's not....”
Crowley opened his mouth to say something but closed it and shook his head instead. It wasn't his place and for the first time in forever, he felt like he needed to stay out of it. "Well, at the very least, I'm glad we got that confusion out of the way. I hope this means that we can finally get around to being friendly with one another? I've rather enjoyed getting to know the others but I have to say I find you rather intriguing."
"I'm so sorry Castiel." Jack cried squeezing his face into the angel's shoulder. "I never meant for any of this to happen. This is all my fault. I let you down. I'm sorry."
"Then what are we waiting for?" Sam asked from the entry way. "Let's build this thing." He strode across the room, his eyes red rimmed and hair a mess, and plopped down in the chair next to Aziraphale, pulling the angel's notes to him.
Sam sat, dumbfounded. He wasn't wrong. Rowena had said the chances of being able to even track her were slim, the chances of them being able to use her if they did were damn near impossible, but it was their only shot. He had weighed the benefits against the negatives in his head for an hour before he even brought it up, and decided that he would rather go down fighting beside his family than spend the last few moments of his life knowing that the two most important people in it, would spend the rest of theirs miserable and alone. Who knows? Maybe they even had a shot at winning, but not if they weren't together. He just couldn't understand why the only other person in the world who loved Dean as much as he did didn't even want to try. “Why?” He asked again.
"Oh you don't know the half of it." Marie's smiled. "But really it was my pleasure. It's the least I could do for my favorite stars."
Rowena sighed and looked up from her book. “Love, Samuel. I'm talking about love. That angel loves your brother with every fiber of his being and it is tearing him apart. The worst part of it all, is that he has no idea that Dean feels the same.”
"For everything." Dean added, slinking back into his chair. "We couldn't have done any of this without you.
“All that 'Dominating, do as I say or I'll make you my bitch' shit you just pulled. Don't get me wrong, it was sexy as hell, I just didn't know you had it in you.” Dean explained.
"Thanks." Sam breathed out, watching the man walk away. He quickly ran to the bathroom as Bobby began calling out for everyone to head to the War Room. He flung open the door, locking it behind him, and ran over to the sinks. The cold water he splashed on his face did very little to calm his nerves. He was shaking, he was nauseous, he couldn't even take a solid breath. He couldn't do this. Not again. How was he supposed to do this again, when he had failed so miserably the last time? How could he be expected to lead another group of people to their inevitable deaths? He glanced at himself in the mirror, droplets of water falling from his face as he stared back at the monster he saw in the reflection. That's what he always was. He wasn't a hero, he wasn't a leader. From the moment Azazel entered his nursery, all those years ago, he became a monster, and that's all he'd ever be. It didn't matter how much good he tried to do, how many lives he tried to save, nothing could erase what he truly was. His eyes began to sting as he gripped the sides of the sink, his knuckles bleeding white over the porcelain. A knock came at the door. "Occupied!" He choked out, trying his best to keep his tone even.
"Riiight." The demon chuckled striding back to his seat and plopping down. "My guess? You pissed them off and they wrote you off, so you figured you'd just come here and push us around to get back at them. Either that or they sent Castiel off to get killed and sent you here with stunt angel number two to figure out a way to bring him back. Either way it doesn't matter. Word around the grape vine is, world's ending anyway and there's nothing that can stop it. Sorry, but I'd rather die a free demon, than listen to some fuck boy like you boss me around." And as last words went, those were rather inelegant.
“I burned it!” She began frantically pacing the kitchen. “I was just here, minding my own business and it showed up on my doorstep and I burned it to ashes!”
"No, no, look, will you just listen! Like for once?” Gabriel snapped. "When Mikey was here, he pumped a bunch of monsters full of Grace. That's half the battle! If me and the kid can figure out how to drain the monster part out and pump more angel juice in...."
It was dark. Pitch black. Quiet. The air was neither cold, nor was it warm. It was just there. He tried in vain, to open his eyes, to blink, searching for light, only to realize that it was impossible. His eyes were already open, there was just no light to be found. He took a breath, but it lacked the relief of cold air entering his lungs. He sat up, scrambling for purchase, for something around him to grab onto, for something to ground him, something to touch. Anything. But it was pointless, because the everything around him was empty
Marie slammed herself into the booth next to Sam and scooped the sasquatch into a massive hug. "Oh, my God! I never thought I'd see you guys again! This is so exciting." She let Sam go and reached across the table to grab Dean by the wrists and squeeze. "How are you?! Wait!" She dropped Dean's hands and looked around the diner suspiciously "There's not a demon here or anything is there?" she asked, a little too loud.
"Why bother?" Dean pouted. "I've been sitting here, practically on my death bed and it's like he doesn't even care. He was so pissed at me, he sent me away when I could've helped. I just....why bother, you know?"
Knowing full well the decision Crowley, himself, would make, were he in the seraph's position, in that brief moment he came to accept that this was truly the last moment he would ever see. If he had to choose between the person he loved and everything else....
Castiel scrubbed his hands over his face and turned around. He slumped down in the chair next to Sam and shook his head. “It was wishful thinking.”
Cas stopped at the top of the stairs, holding on to the railing with a white-knuckle grip. "Why do you care?"
“Oh, good!” The first man sighed in relief, before approaching Dean. “You're awake! How are you feeling? I do hope you aren't terribly hurt. I did the best I could with your injuries, but it proved quite difficult with your...being incapacitated and all...”
"Let go!" Dean barked trying to wiggle out from beneath the behemoth. "Sam, we gotta get Cas! We gotta get him out of there! Let go!" He managed only to wiggle one arm free, the other still effectively pinned beneath them on the ground. He used his free hand to pull at Sam's arm, trying to loosen his brother's grip. "Sam, please!" He cried out, fighting against him with all his strength. "I gotta get to Cas! We can't leave him again! Please!" He managed to free his other arm and began pulling himself across the ground, his fingers scraping across the gravel and dirt, blood seeping from his nail beds as the nails peeled away from his efforts to pull away. He managed only a couple inches before Sam heaved both of them back, sitting up on his knees, still holding tight.
" Cas, wait!" Dean called as he followed after the billowing trenchcoat. Cas was upset and he had no idea why, but he wasn't about to let him just walk away like that. "Where the hell are you going?" He asked when he reach the library and saw Cas walking up the stairs.
Dean's head snapped up to meet a pair of, barely open, impossibly blue eyes and a very disgruntled face. It was possibly one of the most heartwarming sights he had ever laid eyes on. "Heya, Cas." He managed to choke out, his voice cracking at the end as he tried to fight back his tears of joy with a wavering smile.
"Who're you trying to convince that you aren't worthy here?" Gabriel asked, eyebrow raised. "Me or you? Cuz all I'm hearing is you tellin me how you managed to put them in their place."
Dean smiled back and leaned in to kiss the palm of her hand. Part of him was sad to see her go, but it was the best decision for everyone. At least he knew someone he cared for would be happy. An odd flare of jealousy shot through him then, probably because he wanted to be happy too. But...that wasn't in the cards for him now.
"I doubt that." She hummed, bringing her face in closer. She was so close, the pull was irresistible, his mind became muddled as he leaned in close to her. He could feel her breath across his lips, when a pained groan in the distance snapped him out of it.
Aziraphale sighed and put on a sympathetic smile. "Perhaps you should find him then, I'm certain he is more than willing to speak with you if you were to seek him out. You're well enough now to move about the bunker...."
“Oh...” Dean grimaced. He really thought he had it figured out with all the staring and what not. Now he just looked like an ass “Yeah... Sorry, I guess. I just assumed...”
Hooo! Okay guys this is a long one. Like, reeeeeeaaallly long compared to the previous chapters, but it is also an important chapter. I'll explain afterwards. I really needed to write this chapter the way I did and if I'm being honest, I actually cut it down a  lot! This was actually the one of the first concepts that came into my mind as I started writing this. I've been super excited to get to this point and I really hope y'all enjoy it.
As soon as his lips left Cas's, Dean became certain of a few things. First and foremost being, that he was right the first time and gay chicken had been a terrible idea. The kiss was was short, probably no more then a couple of seconds, but damn if it didn't have Dean's heart beating out of his chest.
