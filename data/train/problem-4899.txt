Clint moaned as Coulson dragged him closer, his hips rocking instinctually against the other man's. With a soft gasp, he broke the kiss, nipping at Phil's neck as his hands moved from hips to shirt. His fingers trailed over Phil's abdomen, feeling the lean muscles, the dusting of hair. His handler wasn't cut like he was, but Clint could feel the lean strength in him nonetheless. The archer's fingers dipped into Coulson's waistband, teasing the skin beneath briefly before one strong, nimble hand slid between Phil's legs. Clint couldn't help the sharp gasp that escaped him as his fingers traced the outline of Phil's cock through his jeans. "Jesus..." he breathed, his voice rough and deep against Coulson's ear. "You... God, you really *are* hung."
Watching Victor touch Clint made him feel sick. He'd always reacted poorly to his agents being hurt, but Clint was more than that. They'd woken up together that morning to the sound of Fury's ring tone, and they'd curled up together the night before. That Victor knew it made the situation more maddening. "Leave him alone. If you want to play with somebody, start with me." Phil had no real plan. He couldn't stand up to Victor on a physical level. Neither of them could, frankly, and anyone who could best Clint in a fight was likely to be able to take him without much trouble too. Which meant that the best he could hope to do was buy them time.
"Giving up on all the fun we can have just the two of us?" Phil pressed. He didn't want Creed to touch him. He wanted less for Creed to touch Clint. He'd read enough about Clint's time with Loki to know there were some files even he couldn't tolerate reading all of. If there was a chance he could keep it from happening again, he'd take the gamble. "I'd hate to think you're already disappointed."
Logan snorted, smirking faintly as he shrugged. "Jury's still out. But then, this place ain't exactly put together o' well-adjusted types like the X-Men were," he said wryly. "I mean, we got the bondage twins, a guy who makes me look even-tempered, some spook with an eyepatch... Well, to sum it all up, I'll just say: Tony Stark. And you get an idea o' how cohesive this bunch is." Then there was Steve, who was more or less a slightly taller, American pie-er, possibly a hair more uptight version of Scott, but Logan didn't bother mentioning the good Captain. Mostly because Logan was slightly afraid he'd slip somehow and let the cat out of the bag about the little romp he'd had with Stark and the tall blond. "And, t' be perfectly fair, I ain't done any world-savin' just yet."
Logan huffed quietly as Scott put the brakes on, frustrated on a few different levels. Sober, Scott was a hell of a kisser. The contact had made Logan want to throw aside what little facade of civility he was holding onto and bend Scott over the kitchen table. The man's hands on his hips felt like they were burning holes through Logan's jeans, resting teasingly close to far more intimate areas. //Hey, he's not the one that shut things down last night,// Logan reminded himself as he leaned in, nuzzling Scott's neck and nipping at the man's stubbly chin, his hands coming to rest on Scott's waist and pulling him closer. "This makin' me wait is payback, ain't it?" he asked gruffly, though there was a hint of amusement in his eyes.
"That is rather a lovely thank you," she answered, blushing and smiling and feeling her heart flutter nervously. "Shall we?" Jemma nodded toward the tower. It wasn't that she was eager to get back, but she knew there were larger things afoot. Bruce might well be called on to do things that she knew made him feel terrible. "For the record, if you're up to it when things are taken care of tomorrow, you're always welcome to come and hide in the lab with us, decompress."
Clint barely registered being freed until he heard Phil settle on the floor. Slowly, he edged over to his handler. Clint barely registered his own injuries as he gently ran a hand down Phil's arm. He wondered a moment later if the man would even want to be touched. It was impossible to keep from trying to offer comfort, though. Seeing Phil look so hurt and shaken was entirely foreign to Clint, and they'd seen some truly hellish ops together. "Boss?" he whispered hesitantly, his own voice sounding ragged and foreign to him.
Hulk scowled at Loki's name. "Puny god!" he growled, smacking a chunk out of the floor and giving everyone present a good reason to flinch.
Loki let out a sound best described as a purr of pleasure. His hips undulated sinuously against Tony. He was determined to put the man in mind very clearly of the skills he would bring to bear on the action to come. "Much better," he agreed with a lingering kiss to punctuate the praise. By the end, Loki wondered if he could succeed in making the man forget his ties to his fellow Avengers for a few moments. //Perhaps tomorrow I'll tell him that he has no reason to do this other than his own desires.// The god smiled at the thought and licked a long stripe along Stark's throat. "You're gorgeous when you give yourself to me."
That would be never. He would never be ready to walk into the lab and see Tony not in it. The thought left him panicked, so he assured, "A-after I have something to eat. Thank you, Jarvis."
Nat shook her head firmly. "Don't. Don't do that. Not your fault." She breathed through a wave of nausea. When her stomach settled, she asked, "Did Logan get back? Loki said... but I didn't exactly trust him."
Tony smiled and forced himself to get out of the bed, kissing Steve's forehead. Morning breath didn't worry him too much, but he was pretty sure that more lip-to-lip contact would result in him staying well past lunch. "Definitely grabbing them some food and coffee," he agreed, ruffling Steve's hair. "And you better. Come by, I mean. I think Fitz is freaked out by the fact that we're dating, and at the very least he needs to be subjected to me eye fucking you for a few minutes."
"It's Tony," Steve assured quietly. That was one of the few things he was sure of for the moment, but it was plenty to keep him vertical and relieved instead of panicking even with Loki sitting in a chair next to him. At least with Thor flanking the man, he wasn't worried about Loki trying anything more stupid than his usual. "As for Loki... well, we need him to straighten Clint out, and besides that, he did surrender. He called down the Brotherhood too from what we can tell. Creed broke the truce, and he's getting carted down to a cell right now." That was a problem they'd need to deal with sooner rather than later. "He surrendered, offered the help without our asking, and... and Stark asked us to pull punches for the time being." He cast his gaze to Tony, leaving it open to him what more to say.
"Aye, we should fortify ourselves before we travel," Sif agreed readily. "We shall await your arrival, Captain."
Steve sagged back in his seat as they took off. They'd enlisted a compatriot of Coulson's, Melinda May, to take the helm of the plane. She was curt, cold, and distant. From what he heard, she was also absolutely fantastic at her job. He hated leaving without Tony especially with Nat and Logan and Scott all locked up like criminals for something beyond their control. "Any word from the X-Men?" he asked Clint to distract himself from the idea that they'd have nothing to do until they landed.
"Sure as hell don't wanna stay here," Logan decided, pushing himself to his feet. He felt shaky - an unusual sensation for him - but otherwise alright. He was recovering quickly, though. As he started toward the door with Scott, though, Bruce stood.
Loki took a step back. He wasn't sure Sif could kill him before someone else could intervene, but he also wasn't entirely sure anyone else would intervene. "As Mr. Stark pointed out, I may be of some use in aiding Mr. Barton with his," Loki flicked a glance at the archer and his glowing gaze. It was familiar, and he looked away again. Guilt had its own time and place, but this was not it, "With his condition. Excellent as he feels now, he will feel a thousand times worse than where he began once he sets down the hammer. Isn't that right, brother?"
"Okay, then, maybe... Plan B is me getting dead. Probably," Tony admitted simply, able to practically feel Bruce cringe next to him. "But! The plan is that Bruce bashes Mr. Evil against the pavement a few times before Logan even tries to shoot at him. It's practically fool-proof. Plan B isn’t a plan we’re really looking to, uh, use. Probably. Hopefully."
It was becoming more and more difficult to pretend that Creed didn't have a chance of succeeding. The man was honestly terrifying, and help was likely to be too far away to be any particular help to them. Not until they were in bad shape. Phil rested his head against the wall and did what he could to breathe evenly. The solid weight of Creed was an uncomfortable dose of reality. "Better men than you have tried. And gods for that matter."
Tony relaxed and enjoyed the show for a moment. It was a definite turn-on to watch the two powerful men pressed so close to one another and slowly dropping all pretense of restraint. The bedroom was still several paces away, but Tony didn't really care. He was as happy fucking around on the floor or the kitchen table as anything. //Though the table might not handle all this,// he thought, pressing himself against Logan's side and giving the feral mutant a less-than-gentle bite on the neck. It was in part play, but he was also definitely starting to feel a little left out and wanted to take out his frustration on the guy who was distracting Steve.
Tony listened intently even as the drugs pumping through his system threatened to steal his consciousness away. He had no reason to doubt Steve, even if his assertion that a dead man had tried to assassinate him was fantastic. "Okay, so your best friend is back from the dead and he's gunning for me." Tony set his jaw, mulling over the possibilities. "Jealousy issues? Otherwise, I can't even begin to imagine why I'm his target." He was only mildly teasing, hoping to lighten Steve's mood. It was abundantly clear the other man was deeply troubled over this development, and rightly so.
"Not a word," Fury admitted. He paused when Melinda May swept into the room. She took a seat without a word. "Agent May has agreed to help us out for the duration. We need warm bodies, and her skills should be a strong addition."
When the door to Logan's room opened, Steve was only momentarily surprised to find a shirtless Scott looking back at him instead of Logan. "Uh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt, but could I speak with Logan for a moment?"
Steve tried hard not to look scandalized when it sunk in what kind of 'fakes' Tony meant. "Think I'll make do with something a little more, um, real." He chose one of the pages that boasted of being the biggest fan site on the web dedicated to Iron Man and Tony Stark. It opened with ancute animation of Iron Man flying across the page, and he couldn't help smiling. "Looks like they really are big fans." He selected the Photos link, expression studious. He navigated the page as if it took the utmost concentration to execute the task properly. On that page there were half a dozen categories, so Steve chose a section at random and began scrolling through the images. There were shots of Tony on magazine covers, a few taken out and about at various events and, at the bottom of the page, a small collection of older photos. Steve selected one that showed a young Tony cradled in the arms of a beautiful woman who shared his dark hair but had flashing green eyes. "Your mom? She was really pretty, Tony."
Either offended by Tony's indifference or sensing the tension, Steve's temporary companion quickly made his excuses. Steve barely noticed. "Funny," he finally managed in a tone that was only mildly shaken. He even took a long sip of the champagne. Once again Steve found himself regretting the fact that getting drunk wasn't really an option. The alcohol was dry and almost sharp, the bubbles tickling his nose. At least it gave him something to do. "You don't look drunk, but if I'm the highlight of your evening... bad day?"
"Wait.. Stark's... dead?" Logan fell silent for a moment as he held tight to Scott's hand. He slowly sat up on the edge of the bed, still not quite feeling himself. He looked around at the faces in the room. Bruce, quietly sitting in the corner with his glasses in his hand, looked like he'd been crying. Natasha looked angry, but under that Logan could see the hurt. His gaze drifted to Scott, looking miserable and deflated. Logan ran a hand over his face as the news sank in, and slowly he went from mournful to angry. "Why the hell would he take the body?"
Clint was trying his damnedest to not let some twitch, some flicker, give away the fact that if he hadn't been alternating between chewing on his cheek and his tongue, he would've definitely been starting to poke Phil in the thigh by then. He didn't entirely succeed, though, as his hands tightened on Coulson's hips, nearly pulling them both to a stop before he reminded himself to move. As it was, he was pretty sure his pupils must've been blown from the arousal. The mention of Nat barely registered. Barely anything registered except the man pressed firmly against him. "She just tries to keep my ego from getting overgrown," he finally managed, feeling inordinately proud of himself for managing to keep track of the conversation and even putting together a decent sentence to boot.
At that moment the doors burst open, and a very angry Thor charged into the room. "Where is he?" he thundered. "Where is the scum that took our comrade? He shall be nothing more than a nasty stain once I am through with him!"
Similar thoughts were filtering through Loki's mind, and he shoved them roughly aside. He had done fine on his own. He would continue to do fine on his own. There were no other choices. "Neither are you. Not yet," he answered with a slow smile. "If you're hungry, there's food." Loki gestured to a table not far away. There were no real paths out. He was beginning to wonder if the idea of victory was a ridiculous one. The mutants would have earth, but Asgard would eventually slip through his fingers. It seemed inevitable. There was a futility in all of it, every broken plan or botched mission a reminder that he'd never had a chance at emulating his brother's glory. "Have they even bothered to tell you why Thor hasn't come to your rescue yet?"
Bruce nodded, taking a drink of soda. "Jarvis says it will, but it's hard to be sure without full data. We don't really know what can hurt Loki. Except the hammer, which is off-limits. Thor's folks weren't exactly kind enough to loan us weaponry to get an idea, and that thing," he hooked a thumb over his shoulder at the well-contained evil-hammer, "is like trying to photograph a black hole."
//He isn't lying,// Jean commented silently to Xavier, her arms crossed over her chest, //but he isn't telling the whole truth either.//
"Pretty damned nice," Clint agreed, leading them toward a small nearby park. He had to sign a couple of autographs for the few people who recognized him in his civilian clothes. He knew he wasn't as popular as some of his teammates, and he was completely comfortable with that. He much preferred quiet anonymity. Clint wondered absently who would've even put Hawkeye merch out on the market, then decided it was probably Stark's fault at some juncture. "Hey, ducks." Looking around, Clint spotted a duck food dispenser and dug a few coins from his pocket. "Wanna feed the ducks?" he asked, grinning a little at Phil.
Logan looked up at Scott, expression sobering a bit. "I kept wishin' I could just hold you, even just for a few minutes." He smiled faintly. "I even asked the agents if I could. They looked at me like I'd asked for a chainsaw," he said, smile broadening a little before he leaned in for another slow kiss. His hands slid up Scott's stomach, thumbs lightly brushing over his nipples before moving down to the man's hips and urging him fully onto his lap.
Logan frowned. He hadn't really thought if that. "I think that girl with the red hair... Potts? I think she's probably got some of it. Far as Jarvis goes, though... maybe Bruce can take care of it. Or that kid... uh... Fitz. Not really sure, but it seems like everyone's pretty attached to the place. I'm sure it'll get taken care of."
Clint had patiently waited while Phil cleaned up. He didn't want to see the damage, and he respected that the man wanted to keep what was left of his dignity. As Phil took his hand, Clint managed a faint smile. "Yeah, you don't get a choice in the matter. You know that, right? No more dying on my watch." He leaned in, hesitating for a moment before he pressed a soft kiss to Phil's lips, his fingers trailing lightly over his handler's jaw and neck. He felt the feverish skin next to the bite Creed had left and winced, looking at it. "Sorry! I didn't hurt you, did I?"
"See, I told you," Tony murmured close to Steve's ear. He hadn't been entirely sure if he would ever feel comfortable being intimate with anyone again. Tonight proved he could, that a little cuddling wouldn’t send him scurrying back inside of his shell. Steve's solid, muscular form felt wonderful against him, and Tony could not help but smile. "If you think this one's good," he added, nodding at the TV screen, "just wait till you see the next one."
Coulson thought that through carefully. The truth was it had been a long time. A very long time. He wasn't sure when he'd realized that he felt something more than the usual tight, sick nervousness in his chest when Clint was in danger. It took Coulson awhile to see that line silence when Clint was in the field hurt him more deeply than it should have. "A long time," he confessed. "I'm not sure when it started. Somewhere along the way... You were a real pain in the ass at first, but somewhere in there, I started looking forward to working with you more than working with anyone."
"Probably gonna be right after e convinces himself," Logan guessed. While Fury was obviously good at not being freaked out by anything in public, Logan had a feeling the man was a lot less guarded in his own office. Or maybe not. Fury could have just as easily been one of those that was so jaded that nothing threw him.
Surprised by the sudden, easy shift in Tony's demeanor, Steve took the drink gratefully even though it wouldn't do much to ease his nerves. "Thank you." He lifted the glass in silent salute before taking a sip. Though he was no connoisseur, it tasted like the good stuff. The burn going down was a slow, pleasant bloom. "I'd actually like that if you really don't mind." He'd taken up temporary housing at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, but it was a pretty lonely living. He preferred people. After going from the orphanage to a place with Bucky to the road with a huge entourage to the barracks, Steve was used to company. Being alone gave him too much time to think about things he didn't really want to think about. "Maybe we could try a movie out? Something you like. I trust you."
//Did I just get told to stay because I'm a warm body?// Clint didn't argue, though, taking the woman's hand and letting her lead him back to the bedroom. He'd planned to just sleep on the couch. "I think I'd be willing to play body pillow for you, if you need me to," he agreed, tugging off his boots and shirt. "Wouldn't want you to get cold."
The woman glanced back long enough to nod. "You too, Captain," she answered in a monotone before putting her eyes back on the horizon.
"Remind me not to combine thinking and blow jobs. It's a bad way to go," Steve answered with a sigh as he righted his clothes and did his best to make his hair presentable. When the door opened, he nodded solemnly to the men filing in for a meeting. They all looked vaguely shell-shocked at the implication of what had been going on in the room and Steve tried to pretend he had no idea that they were staring. His cheeks were flaming red by the time they were free of the distraction. "Right now I think I'm done with thinking for the day. What about you?" Steve asked in a tone that seemed oddly coy considering he'd been on his knees sucking Tony off a few minutes before. "You have any plans?"
Clint hadn't thought of that. It actually sounded kind of appealing to think that people might see Phil in Hawkeye boxer shorts and make all the right assumptions. "I think I like that idea," he said with a smirk. He was pretty sure that his handler would kill him if he left hickeys on his neck. The boxers might be the next best thing. Of course, Clint was already plotting his way to leaving a few marks that might at least show up in the locker room. Realizing that blood was starting to flow south and that he was probably starting to get a little flushed, the archer focused on taking another sip of his coffee. "You might make Cap jealous, though," he added, his voice a little rougher than intended. Hell with it. If Phil liked the idea of Clint getting turned on over him, Clint was damn well going to run with it.
Steve woke in the morning still curled happily around Tony. He smiled against the man's bare shoulder and then nuzzled against Tony's neck. He didn't care if it was sappy or silly. He liked cuddling Tony, damn it. And try as he might to pretend otherwise, Tony liked it too. "Morning, handsome," he whispered with a kiss to Tony's ear. "Gonna put on some clothes and get us breakfast. And decent coffee. Any requests?"
Tony felt a little bit like an ass. He feeling fairly sure there was a better way to have told Steve. Then again, just letting him figure it out on his own sounded like a terrible idea, too. Tony had no way to know all the other ideas Steve was starting to get into his head about having lost the serum, but he couldn't stand to see his lover cry. "Steve... easy, baby. We'll get through this, whatever we have to do. Bruce and I can work on something... or maybe it'll come back on its own," he soothed, wishing desperately he could pull Steve against him and hold him tight. The aesthetics weren't really a concern for Tony, but he knew Steve well enough to know that the man's spirit was too much to be relegated to a body that couldn't hold up to the sort of heroics he was inclined toward. Tony placed a hand gently on Steve's narrow shoulder. He had to fight to remind himself that it was really Steve, but the idea just made him want to take care of his lover even more. "We'll get it figured out. I'm with you, whatever happens," he promised.
"Oops, missed." The woman smiled in a way that would have been sweet if she hadn't looked suspiciously like Nat after she snapped the neck of someone who really deserved it. "I'm afraid Loki's busy at the moment, but he sent a few friends to say hello. So hello."
"Yeah, that could work." Steve was pretty sure he'd have better luck raiding Coulson's wardrobe, but the truth was that finding out he was actually too small to borrow shirts from even Coulson would be a blow he wasn't ready for. "A shirt would be good. It's the strangest thing: Clint Barton is actually not my fashion icon." Tony wasn't either, sharp as he looked most of the time. Steve liked his own odd, dated style. Tony could call him an old man as much as he wanted: it made Steve feel like at least some things didn't have to change completely. "You make pretty good pancakes, by the way." Under the table, he let his foot find Tony's and knock against it. "Thanks."
There weren't many people who were willing to try deep throating him. There were even fewer people who would try it on the first go in such an unorthodox situation. Which all somehow made it glaringly obvious that of course Clint Barton was going for it. Phil cursed under his breath and breathed in heavily to keep from thrusting. He wanted to encourage Clint's efforts, not hinder them. He couldn't look away from the sight of Clint sucking him off. It was easily the hottest thing he had ever seen in his life. "God, Clint, that... that's perfect..."
Tony watched Steve in the bedroom mirror as he changed into a T-shirt himself and tugged on a pair of sleep pants. He wasn't planning on going out again, and if he was going to be entertaining tonight, he wanted to feel comfortable. "Well, I'm not exactly one for sharing my personal space," Tony replied, noting how paradoxical that sounded now that he'd given Steve his clothes. "I'm sure you'll see me around there from time to time." Turning, his gaze lingered on the other man. Tony could not help being impressed with the view. Not only was Steve a perfect physical specimen, he was so handsome it was almost painful to look at him. For the first time in a long time Tony Stark found himself simultaneously intimidated by and attracted to someone. Feeling a little flustered over the notion, he cleared his throat and steered his guest out of the bedroom. "Those lessons we were talking about?" //Subject change. Nice segue.// "Where would you like to start?"
Steve liked the roughness. Tony made a note of it, filed it away for future use. //Might have to repurpose some of that closet-full of ties,// he thought to himself as he slowly pushed forward. "You feel fucking amazing," he returned, his voice a gruff rasp as he leaned in to nip at Steve's ear. "Love the way you look squirming under me, begging me... Makes me so fucking hot," he growled.
She handed Clint the keys to the black SUV and then gave Logan a smile. "Since you can't get drunk, you get to be the default designated driver. Plus he won't be able to keep the keys from you if you decide to take them." Natasha deferred the front seat to Coulson and slid into the back alongside Scott and Logan. The pair of them were actually kind of adorable. She knew that a lot of Scott's lingering, his need to be close, came from what had happened to him over the past several months. She didn't comment on it. If taking comfort in Logan helped, she was all for it. Everyone needed to find their own way to drown their sorrows.
Simmons only barely contained the urge to squeal with delight at the sight of the suit. She stepped in closer and then stayed her hands. Even her urge to explore was tampered by the reminder that there was a person in the suit who might not appreciate being groped - at least not by her. "Right. Yes, well, the simulations should do just fine until... well, hopefully permanently." Though her smile faltered briefly, Simmons found it again soon enough.
Natasha smiled at the exchange, the teasing and then the sincere admission. There was something there. It wasn't much of anything yet, but it was something.
Steve was shocked into stillness at first, but he recovered quickly and brought a hand up to cup the other man's cheek. When their lips parted, he was grinning like an idiot and didn't care in the least. Nothing mattered but how good it felt to enjoy the open, easy connection he felt with Tony. "I think we're done with questions," he added, glancing at the reporters before his gaze returned to Tony. "I also think we have some plans we discussed earlier. Now's as good a time as any. Upstairs," he added quietly before Tony could get any ideas.
A real relationship was something Clint wasn't sure he'd ever had in any traditional sense. He thought he'd come close with Nat until she'd more or less ignored his offering of flowers. That was when he'd given up trying to keep worry about staying exclusively hers. Shaking himself out of that thought track, he focused on the man beside him. Phil looked honestly happy, and Clint couldn't help but smile in response. "You know... I know it wasn't technically a date, but yesterday afternoon was nice. It made me feel a little better, with everything going on," he said finally.
"Love you, too," Tony murmured, holding his lover tight. It hurt to think that he might have to make the sacrifice that meant leaving Steve behind. Steve needed him, and he needed Steve, and losing that was way more terrifying than getting killed.
"Yeah, you're not the only one with a past. Fury wasn't kidding when he said the team was kind of a mess," Clint said with a faint smirk.
Phil had no idea how much time would be enough. How long would it take SHIELD to figure out where they were and get there? Coulson wouldn't allow himself to doubt that it was going to happen, but that didn't make a timeline any easier to put together given that he hadn't the faintest idea how far they'd traveled. For all he knew the alien gadget had flown them halfway across the world. "Don't touch him," Phil finally grated out. He knew it wasn't exactly a smart decision, but he knew that it was better than watching Clint tortured. It was better than letting one of Loki's flunkies violate him after everything he'd already been through. "Please, I'll do whatever you want, but take me first." He chose his words carefully, mindful of the fact that Creed had made it clear they were taking turns, not getting off the hook. The more placating he could be, the better it would sell. "Just tell me what you want me to do."
"NAT!" Darien forgotten, Clint practically dove to the woman's side. He ran a hand through her hair, then regained his senses enough to check for a pulse. It was there and going strong, but Natasha was obviously the worse for wear. Clint darted back to his bag and grabbed his comm. "This is Barton. I need a medic team in my suite," he barked shakily into the device as he lingered close to Nat. Kneeling by the bed, he slowly stroked her hair, so relieved that she was back he could barely think.
Coulson frowned at the image on the screen and finally spoke, "I don't think their intentions are to hurt the team. Unfortunately intentions don't always mean anything. Summers is a standup guy by all accounts. He's a by the rules type." Of course, so was Steve, but the man was willing to bend the rules if it meant keeping his people safe. For Summers, that meant protecting Logan. "If Logan's been compromised, we may not know how until it's too late. As you said, if we jump the gun and start a fight, we're hurting ourselves, and we're ruining a chance of alliance likely not only with Logan and Summers but with the X-Men. If we're up against the Brotherhood, that's not a sound strategy." He looked over at Clint, feeling bad for suggesting inaction when the man was itching to deal with the potential threat. "We need to wait. If we confront them at all, it needs to be private. A meeting, not an arrest. If Logan's holding back or Summers is, give them a chance to come clean on the record."
Natasha waited until Thor led the way before she moved. The woman paused and finally told the guards, "Keep an eye on the big guy." She hoped that Bruce would be able to join them, but after the fight, she knew it might be awhile. Before Thor could say anything, Natasha told him, "Stark is dead. Barton and Coulson were taken. Cap... well, he's not on the roster at the moment. We need you and anyone else you can spare, and we need to get rid of Loki once and for all."
Tony barely registered anything at first. Everything seemed muffled. It was cold. He felt heavy. Sick. Feverish. Especially the sick part. Like he wanted to puke but couldn't. He moved to roll over only to realize that he wasn't able to; his hands were suspended out to his sides. In fact, he seemed to be held upright by the bindings. He blinked, his eyes fluttering open. At first, he saw nothing. Another blink, harder, squeezing his eyelids together until tears oozed slightly from the sides. His eyes opened again, and slowly, painfully, hazy shapes appeared. Dim lights. Tony could barely remember what had happened, but he assumed that if he was tied up, they'd lost. Still unable to make out his surroundings, Tony let his tongue wet dried lips. "Couldn't just put me in a cell? Had to get all kinky, huh?" he managed, his voice gravelly and weak as he tugged weakly at his bindings.
Clint had the decency to blush a little at that, but mostly because the mention of the shirt reminded him of the related conversation centered around boxers and pajamas. "Yeah, uh, apparently I have merchandise," he said, looking a little sheepish. "We were trying to stay casual. Trying to keep from going crazy. One of our best friends was in jail, and I wasn't even allowed to see her without handcuffs, soooo... we got a little stir crazy. But, yeah... uh, apparently there're boxers and PJs, too. I'm blaming Stark."
It wasn't a surprise to have visitors, really, but Phil found himself still having to take a deep breath before he went to the door. Going over the attack with a shrink had been hard even though the doctor was one he'd spoken to before. That almost made it worse. They'd both survived their assessments, though, and to Phil's surprise the doctors seemed to think that they would be ready for field work again when they felt ready. It was no surprise to see Natasha on the other side of the door, but it was a surprise to see Thor standing behind her. "Come in, please." He stepped aside to let them in and cast a glance toward Clint, checking the man's reactions.
"Well, your ass is getting some mileage on it, and I'm thinking I should probably let you have a rest, so..." Clint shoved his partner to the floor and pushed his pants down far enough to expose himself. "I think you can guess what the next step is..."
"Hydra's not a big fan of mine," Steve replied, though he wondered if that could be all it was. He shook his head. "I don't know." It was hard to think at all when he wanted to run out the door, find Tony, and get him home again.
"See? Worth moving," Phil observed. He got a muffled sound of approval from Natasha as he grabbed the blanket and pulled it up over all of them. They made for a ridiculous family, but he honestly couldn't imagine a better one.
Blushing furiously from the quick embrace, Simmons stammered, "Well, yes, but not because of you," she added in a rushed tone, "but it's... he doesn't, well, we don't hug often. Except each other. I'm not sure that counts." It sounded more and more mortifying the more she talked, and finally Simmons ducked her head and pointedly closed her mouth, determined not to dig the hole any deeper. "I meant it, though, about not being able to do this without you. I'm brilliant with this sort of thing - sorry, modesty, but, well, I am - but you're even better."
Clint knew he'd baited the other man into this, but the tickle in the back of his mind that told him that taking the invitation was stupid, unprofessional, and potentially dangerous was irritatingly persistent. Still, he'd already come up with a list of ideas of what he could do to Darien, and he felt as though he needed to check a few of the items off of it. Now. Clint didn't respond verbally, instead stepping through the door. His hand shot back and dragged Darien through with him, and he crushed the man against the wall, his hand catching Darien's jaw as he slammed their mouths together. He drew back, giving Darien a predator's stare. "Sure you're not in over your head?"
"He's like a big blue teddy bear," a voice agreed from over Hank's shoulder. Holding out a hand, the young man smiled. "Bobby Drake, otherwise known as Iceman." He shook Bruce's hand, then did the round of introductions with the group at large. "I'm sorry we couldn't spare more people. Things have been messy all over."
Logan grinned broadly at Scott. "Afraid you're gonna kill me?" he asked, obviously amused. He'd seen what Scott's abilities could do unchanneled, but he was pretty confident that if he could survive a nuclear blast, he could cope with whatever happened in that room. "I'll be fine. Unless I'm makin' you nervous?" he teased.
It was a terrible idea if he intended to walk for the next couple of days. It really, really was. Just the feeling of Clint's cock pressing against him made Darien's breath catch, though, and he was following Clint's rough order before he could think it through. The stretch was too much, painful and aching, and he loved it. A near-sob of pleasure escaped him as he drove himself slowly downward. "Oh, fuck... fuck, that's..." He wasn't sure what it was. Darien could think of no word to describe the pleasure-pain and decided not to try. He suspected that Clint knew anyway.
Natasha nodded. "Okay," she agreed simply. "For now, how about something to eat?" The pair had been holed up alone in Phil's suite almost exclusively since their return from what she'd heard. They needed to get out in the world and be reminded of the people who cared about them. She smiled faintly at Thor. "Lunch sound good to you?"
“According to Captain Rogers, he agreed to a date.” The whole thing still sounded a little surreal, but it was good for both of them - at least Phil hoped it would be. “Given that Sergeant Barnes is still in medical for at least the night, I don’t foresee that going badly.” Someone with Steve’s rather old fashioned sensibilities wasn’t likely to try to push Tony any farther than he was comfortable with under any circumstances, let alone the ones in which they found themselves. “Barnes wants the arm removed. Well, replaced,” Coulson amended. “He’s not comfortable wearing Hydra tech, and I can’t blame him.”
"That's true," Clint agreed, smiling a little as he leaned forward to check for traffic at an intersection. He put on a grim smile. "Gotta remember to feed the ducks when this is all done. It's not over until we've fed them." He remembered the peace he'd felt in that moment, and he felt a strange pang at the thought. He did his best to shake it off. Another glance in the rearview, and Clint caught sight of the two cuddling in the back seat. Another strange stab in the chest, and he refocused on his driving. //Maybe I'm just having a heart attack. That'd be alright.//
Clint nipped at the other man's jaw. The back of his mind screamed at him that there was no reasonable way Scott would have known that, but with Scott's lean-muscled form pressed eagerly against his own, Clint wasn't interested in what seemed like minor details. Stepping back, Clint unfastened his quiver and dropped it on the counter. He didn't bother shedding anything else as he fisted his hand in Scott's shirt and dragged him back to the bedroom. The faintest scent of sex and sweat still lingered, but that just served to fuel Clint's arousal. He certainly appreciated the value of sharing. Clint dragged Scott into another punishing kiss before practically tearing the man's shirt off of him. "You wanna be my bitch? First rule," he shoved Scott to his knees, "you start out where all good little bitches should. Second rule: you don't cum 'til I tell you to." Clint unzipped and presented Scott with his cock. "Suck."
Scott just let himself enjoy for a moment before venturing, "Just... one more finger, maybe, then... I'm not feeling really patient right now." He swallowed hard and tried to remember that both of them having a little control in the moment would make the whole thing better in the long run. Rushing would take discomfort into pain, and Scott wanted it to be good not just for himself but for Logan. He had no intention of it being a one time deal. //Patience is a virtue,// Scott reminded himself firmly. "A little more," he repeated as if to convince himself to take the extra time and care as well.
"I can't blame somebody for wanting to talk to you," Steve teased in return. He kissed Tony's cheek sweetly. It was surprising but pleasant to find that Tony didn't mind the affection. He'd been terrified that Tony would insist he was above such things or something ridiculous - and utterly Tony - like that. "What did he need?" Coulson wasn't one to call and interrupt for no reason, especially with Tony hurt. On the contrary, the man had offered to play interference as much as possible so that he could remain by Tony's side.
Scott lost all sense of their companion in that moment. He was too busy whimpering and panting as Logan fucked him harder, faster. "Close, baby, so close," he managed, ready to explode but unconsciously waiting for Logan to tell him it was okay to let go.
Tony and Coulson arrived to find everyone busy and no one particularly inclined to stop and speak to them. Which meant waiting. With the adrenaline flowing and every muscle in his body tense, the last thing Coulson wanted to do was park himself in a chair and wait. But he did. He parked Tony's chair right next to him, sank down onto the plastic surface, and tried to look calmer than he felt. "He'll be fine. He's survived worse than this."
"I think I might appreciate that," Natasha answered earnestly. She gave Clint's thigh a squeeze, but it was a quick, affectionate gesture obviously not intended as more. He belonged to someone else, and far from being offended, she was relieved. He deserved every last bit of the affection that Phil could offer him. She could keep him physically safe. Phil could protect his heart.
"Yeah, I guess that takes some getting used to. It's funny to me sometimes. I know the PR machine... it was all pretty squeaky clean, and I try to be a good guy, don't get me wrong, but I've never been what everybody thinks I am." Steve shrugged at the idea. He knew that helping people was too deeply entrenched in him to do anything else. "The calm, normal life wasn't ever an option. I wish it had been. Anyway, the more people get to know me, the more they're gonna notice. Might as well show 'em with hickeys."
Logan glanced between the two of them. He already hated them both. Steve reminded him of Scott's unending douchebaggery, and Stark just seemed too slimy. Still, Stark was right. Sitting around wasn't his style. "Alright. Fine. But I ain't wearin' suspenders," he said, giving Steve a pointed look.
Hearing the emotion in Clint's voice was enough to get Phil choked up, so he gave himself a few seconds before he tried to speak. He didn't want to start crying because for one it would have been ridiculous, and for another, he was pretty sure Clint would have run screaming out of the room - or at least wanted to. Once he felt relatively sure he could manage it, Phil gave Clint's hand a squeeze in return. "Believe me, I'm not going anywhere if I have anything to say about it. Period." He didn't need any assurances from Clint that they'd be together forever to know he wanted to be there for the other man regardless. Romance was nice, but ultimately that was only part of his tie to Clint. "Dying once was plenty."
Steve beamed and threaded his fingers through Tony’s. “I’d be honored. I’ll even cook if you’d like.” He wasn’t a master chef, but Steve enjoyed cooking, and he doubted Tony got a home cooked meal often unless it was one of the nights where someone got a yen to make dinner for the team and invited everyone down. “The only thing that matters to me is the company. Dinner’s just an elaborate excuse to spend time with you. We’ll do whatever you’re up for. Whatever we’re both up for.”
Steve frowned. JARVIS always followed orders. "JARVIS-" It registered exactly what he was seeing a second later.
Bruce allowed himself a few tears, holding onto Jemma's hand gratefully as he tried to keep himself from breaking down completely. Once he'd regained a little bit of composure, he dabbed at his eyes and blew his nose on a napkin before looking up and offering Jemma a smile. "Thank you," he said earnestly, giving her hand a squeeze before finally relinquishing it and sipping at his cocoa. "Well, at least I have a reason or two to stick around, still." Frankly, he couldn't imagine going anywhere else. At least people in the Tower treated him like he was halfway normal, and SHIELD knew what to do if the Other Guy turned up. Still, he had a feeling he'd relate to Jemma and Fitz a lot better than the rest of the Tower's denizens.
Clint groaned and rolled his eyes as he heard the exchange over his earpiece. "You must be stressed, Stark. That pun was terrible," he hissed as Natasha dropped into the room ahead of them. He didn't get a chance to dwell on it, though, as four short, sharp blades sliced through the ducting in front of him, narrowly missing his face. Clint shifted back, though with Coulson behind him there wasn't far to go. One meaty, powerful hand sank claws into his vest and its blast-proof plating and dragged him out, using his body to widen the opening.
Tony parked the car and climbed out. "Anyway, you'll be fine. Time Magazine'll do some provocative, artistically challenged, exceedingly flamboyant magazine cover about how open-minded America is, then the latest American Idol star will do something tragically stupid and it'll never be spoken of again." Tony shrugged, stepping onto the elevator and pushing the button for his floor. "Uh... you guys staying with me, or...?"
Logan couldn't help the faint smirk tugging at his lips. They were adorable, really. Oddly right for one another. He briefly wondered about the age difference before remembering he had a couple centuries on his own boyfriend. "You might want her to step back, unless you're plannin' to just bring 'er with us," he remarked, smirking faintly.
"Over easy," Phil answered, leaning against the counter and savoring the luxury of letting someone else do the cooking. It was a bizarre thing, really, to let someone else take on the workload. He wasn't used to the division of labor at home. He wasn't used to not being alone. It was amazing. "And the bacon should be so crisp it snaps easily. I will never understand why anyone would have any use for soggy bacon."
Logan let Scott drag him onto the dance floor. Somewhere in the back of his brain, he realized he might know how to do some ballroom dancing of his own, but the beat was far too fast for anything like that. Letting Scott take the lead, he grinned as they both awkwardly managed some sense of rhythmic movement. It was stupid, he felt stupid, but Scott seemed to be having fun. That was all it took to make Logan feel sure it was completely worth it.
Logan couldn't entirely suppress a smirk. "So this happens a lot, huh?" Reaching out, he grabbed the case of cigars out of Tony's breast pocket. "Y'know, I think I'll have one o' these after all," he said, helping himself and lighting it. It had been awhile since Logan had had anything nice. "Let's go. Before we completely wear out my welcome. I kinda like this place."
The woman smiled, eyes bright. "We shall be victorious in Asgard, and then we shall bring the wrath of Asgard down upon Loki. You have my word."
Steve was fishing in the nicest way possible. Tony, however, found himself unsure over how to answer. "I wouldn't say that's anything's wrong," he eventually replied. "Pepper and I... we decided that we needed a break, that's all." It amounted to a whole lot more than that. Pepper had noticed Tony's interests shifting, becoming more and more focused on Steve, and she had graciously decided to give him time to figure things out for himself. "It's nothing you need to worry that pretty head of yours over," Tony assured him.
"Not uncomfortable so much as I just... usually say all the wrong things," Tony admitted. He always felt the need to caveat and preamble and generally just wound up getting lost in his own train of thought before he ever managed to get around to saying what he'd intended. He'd managed to make Pepper angry not just a few times doing so.
Scott sighed happily at the contact and the assurance that Logan liked what they were doing too. It was lazy, and maybe it wouldn't even go anywhere, and that was nice too. He didn't really care as long as the night ended with them curled up in bed together. While he'd been desperately trying not to freak out in the cell, that was the thing he needed most. Scott had ached for Logan's arms curled around him and the warmth of the man's body, his steady heartbeat. "I really, really missed being close to you."
"He mentioned them once. They sounded hideous," Phil observed, earning a hearty nod of agreement from Thor. "You'd probably enjoy it."
"No one's perfect. Personally I always vet their ability to make cookies. Life's too short to skip dessert." Phil held the door open when they reached the meeting room. "Sir," he greeted Fury. "Any updates?"
Seeing that the joke had fallen flat, Coulson sighed and tried again, “I’m serious about bringing in someone fresh, but I don’t think that Barnes is a direct threat to him. Obviously we’ll keep an eye on them, and there will be procedures in place should things get out of hand. I don’t expect them to. If anything, over time, I expect outbursts like what happened today to become more rare. Even soldiers who don’t go through the severe, mind-altering processes that Sergeant Barnes suffered come back with PTSD. We would be doing him and ourselves a disservice to treat him differently and deny him help because of what he’s been through.”
Natasha shook her head. If Logan had kept his mouth shut, she suspected that the man wouldn't have been the wiser. Scott was obviously buzzed and having a good time. He looked more confused than distressed by the idea that Logan had been so sexually adventurous in the brief time he'd been with the Avengers. "I wouldn't say it's part of the training program, but you learn to enjoy yourself while you can."
Clint was appreciative of the reassuring touch. "Thanks," he murmured, rubbing his right hand over his other arm as he tried to ignore the strange tingle in the limb. "Glad to be getting away from that thing. It was too close, Coulson. I felt too close to losing it again," he confessed shakily. "Gotta give you credit, though. You didn't seem to have any problem putting it down." Then again, it shouldn't have surprised Clint. Coulson had nerves of steel and an ironclad mind to go with them.
Before Coulson had a chance to warn Clint to get his hands the hell off of the hammer, the door exploded inward. He was slammed back into a shelf only to be righted by Steve's hand on his shoulder a beat later. "I'm fine." He looked around, trying to spot Bruce. Of all of them, he could do the most damage - which was a good and a bad thing.
Clad in a simple white shirt and skintight black jeans, Natasha smiled at the group as a whole. "We're awfully pretty."
"You don't have to lose either," Phil chimed in when Clint finally seemed to have run out of things to say. "We'll find a way to fix things for Nat, and I'm not going anywhere. Neither are you. I won't let it happen again." If he'd had to fling that hammer out of the plane, he would have done it. "I know that I'm usually the one following the rules. There's a good reason for it. It's helpful. It's part of what keeps us all safe, but when it comes to you... I don't know if you've noticed, but when it comes to you, I've got a blind spot. Do you really think that I won't do absolutely everything in my power to keep you and to keep Natasha safe?" Phil actually found it in himself to smile. He wanted to take Clint's hand but held back from the familiarity. "We've survived worse, and we'll keep surviving. Period."
"That's good," Clint croaked, "because I don't think Fury would like me falling asleep for it." He followed his handler in a haze. It was hard to stay conscious when there was no real need to. He didn't bother to ask where he was being led and barely registered that they'd apparently both made the decision to go back to Coulson's suite. Clint walked out of his shoes and pants, leaving the shirt in place for the sake of the bandages on his back. He slouched on the edge of the bed until Phil was almost settled, not trusting himself to stay awake long enough for the man to undress. Once his handler was in the bed, the archer pressed himself as tightly as he could to the other man, his face buried in Phil's neck as he relaxed gratefully into sound sleep.
"To put it mildly." Fury didn't care who slept with who as long as no one was in traction when it was time to work. He knew that Clint was likely to spend the night beating himself up over Natasha. "Maybe you should call him in for duty tonight.”
Clint swallowed hard and his right hand clenched subconsciously. He'd had to watch the security footage as part of their debriefing. It had given him nightmares. Coulson wasn't the first agent they'd lost. Wouldn't be the last. But there weren't a lot of people at SHIELD Clint felt any sort of connection with. Phil was one of them. Shaking himself back to reality and trying to level out his breathing, he tilted his head at Coulson. "Does it matter? You're still here. And I'm glad. I don't have many friends. Don't like the idea of losing one," the archer managed, the faintest quaver in his voice.
Having noticed Steve the moment he'd stepped into the room, Tony caught the other man's eye and raised his champagne flute in acknowledgement. It was strange seeing him again. The battle against Loki and the Chitauri seemed like a distant memory even though it had taken place not that long ago. Excusing himself from the middle of a rather tedious conversation, Tony crossed the room and deftly plucked another champagne glass from a waiter's tray. "Now this is a surprise," he commented, ignoring the man Steve had been talking to. "I didn't expect to see you here."
"Turnabout is fair play." Loki eased his pants down over slender hips and gracefully stepped free of them. Already his cock was hardening at the prospect of the evening ahead. A bit of companionship was the perfect way to celebrate his victory with Logan. Stepping in closer to Victor again, Loki sank to his knees and placed a rough bite on the mutant's hip. "All to your liking?"
Logan shrugged and turned away from the bar enough to look at his companions. "Far as I can remember." He hadn't really thought about it much. He sure as hell didn't give a damn what other people did, or even have a thought about freaking out if a guy were to hit on him. As to whether he'd accept... //Right guy? Guess it could be.// He noted a very young, very flamboyant-looking man at one of the distant tables. "Guess I just never thought much o' havin' a guy around as interested in shoes and People magazine as Marie 'n' Ororo were," he said, making it clear he wasn't interested in the bystander by turning more toward Steve. "I mean, if I'm gonna date a guy, I want all the perks, too."
"You've just got to make... this difficult... don't you, Rogers?" Tony barely managed to tease. "How am I... supposed to get better... being distracted... by that handsome face of yours?" A faint grin quirked his lips, but he found even that simple action painful. His mind was filled with the possible candidates who wanted him dead. It had obviously been an assassination attempt, or at the very least, a message, but the purpose remained a mystery. "You know... whoever did this... could try again. I want you... to be careful."
Clint moaned as he unzipped, finally letting his aching shaft free of the confining leather. He liked the idea of fucking her more or less fully clothed, and the feeling of her legs and feet running over his legs through the leather. Wrapping his hand around the throbbing flesh, he dragged the head of his cock up and down her slick opening a few times before he could no longer stand the temptation. He forced himself to go slow with every ounce of his being as he guided himself into her, his hands bracing on either side of her chest as he buried himself into her tight, welcoming heat. Clint panted desperately as he slid home, his face coming to rest against her neck. His hand slid up her side to cup one of her breasts and play with the nipple as he began to thrust slowly.
Logan shook his head at the two. Anyone else would've been thumping their chest at the grouping. She'd emptied a full magazine into the target, and it took a good eye to tell that more than three bullets had passed through the central ring. "Sweetheart, I don't think you gotta worry about anything survivin' that, anyway."
Bruce couldn't help the smile that split his face. He'd blushed at the earlier compliment, and it was hard to find Jemma talking about hot chocolate anything but profoundly endearing. All things considered, it was nice to have something to smile about. He knew there'd be time for mourning and grim strategizing later. For one little moment, he was damn well going to enjoy himself. "I like this place," he decided. It was quiet, cozy, and didn't remind him at all of any of the miserable recent events. "I think hot chocolate sounds good." He'd originally planned to grab some kind of coffee, but comfort foods sounded a lot better. "Maybe a muffin, too."
"We've been cleared as soon as we feel ready," Coulson assured in light of the pronouncement." His fingers were still laced carefully together with Clint's under the table, and he gave them a squeeze. "As soon as we head out, I think I'm feeling pretty ready to deal with the situation." He hadn't missed Logan's glance and gave the man a nod. "It's good to know we're all on the same page."
"I wish she didn't," Coulson answered honestly. He hated the thought of it too, the idea of putting the woman into bondage when she was already so bad off. "In this case, I think the director has a point. We didn't know that Logan or Summers were so far gone until it was almost too late. Realistically, even hurt Natasha could do a lot of damage before we could contain her if it came down to that. Right now, I want to put it to her. I think I know what she'll want."
Jemma's eyebrows rose up toward her hairline. "Uh, is that... is that a good... nevermind," she decided halfway through the question. It really didn't matter whether it was a good idea or not. It was probably the only idea, and she knew it. Instead of dwelling, Jemma smiled faintly. "Well, I am glad to hear that we get to finish this. I'd hate for you to only have half a muffin. They're divine, aren't they?" She could read the anxiety easily enough. Bruce needed a distraction. She was completely fine with the idea of providing one.
"Yeah, just..." It took Steve a second to get the suit open, the face shield sliding back. He'd managed to split his lip at some point, but Jarvis had noted that the bleeding stopped far more quickly than it had previously. The fact that he'd gained a little bit of bulk had also helped to make maneuvering in the suit a bit easier. Catching the look on Logan's face, he explained, "Tony left it for me. I... it seemed like a good idea to learn how to use it. Maybe I can actually help out." He took note of the striking woman at Logan's side. "Captain Steve Rogers, ma'am. Sorry for not being able to shake properly. This is just as hard to get off as it looks like."
Steve didn't bother with a verbal reply. It was too much fun watching Tony fall apart. He stared at the gorgeous man beneath him and angled his thrusts to try and get the most out of every one. It wouldn't take either one of them long, he could see that from the way Tony twisted beneath him. That didn't mean it had to be anything less than spectacular. Steve wondered if he could talk Tony into staying with him after they got inside, if they could curl up together and just sleep. "Open your eyes," he pleaded gently. "Let me see you."
"You're inspiring," Phil answered with a faint smile before he leaned in to steal another kiss. It was hard to believe what they'd just done. He sank back onto the floor next to Clint and finally bothered to actually zip his pants up and catch his breath. It was awkward in the aftermath, and Phil found himself hosting the unwelcome thought that Clint might have made an impulsive decision solely because he was drunk. "You're right, though - that was amazing."
"Yes, Tony... I... more than ready. More than," he murmured again, a shiver running through him and his hands braced on the couch to hold himself steady while he waited for the first thrust. He looked back over his shoulder and fixed dark eyes on Tony's face. He held all the power for the moment, and he wore it well. He looked absolutely stunning standing there with his hair wild and his eyes shining. "I need you." Steve had never meant that on so many levels at once. They completed one another in a million different ways, and together they made a bizarre sort of sense. Steve wasn't sure he'd ever feel entirely whole again without having Tony at his side.
The medical team swarmed in, taking Natasha, barely conscious, away with them. By the time they were heading to the medical ward, Coulson had heard and appeared to follow along with Clint. "Was she awake?" he asked, stepping quickly to try to keep up with the orderlies checking vitals and trying to get the woman to talk. Even as they walked, Clint texted Steve to let him know. Fury, of course, would have already heard. "Did she say anything?"
Tony was speechless for a moment, which for him was more or less equivalent to an average person staring with their mouth hanging open in shock. "You and... Damn," he said softly, feeling earnestly sorry for Loki. He searched the Asgardian's face, and it dawned on him just how vulnerable the god looked, lounging nude in their shabby surroundings. "If SHIELD heard me say this, I'd probably get put on some kind of list, but I can definitely understand why you'd be a little pissed." He wondered what Thor's side of the story was, but obviously he wasn't going to get to ask. "I would've thought your brother would be a little more stand up than that. But it kinda explains a few things. Like why he wouldn't kill you the first time we caught you."
Scott considered that and finally nodded slowly. On the off chance that they headed past windows on the way, he grabbed the glasses that Coulson had found for him into his front pocket. It was insurance. Frankly he wasn't ready for a full recharge, but the universe didn't always go along with his plans. "I'll sit in."
Logan stared at the bruises. He barely remembered grabbing Scott earlier. He had to think hard to even recall the moment. "I hurt you," he stated flatly as the realization hit him. He swallowed hard. The idea made him sick. He wanted to protect Scott, mind and body. Instead, he'd scared the man and given him bruises. //Not much better than what I rescued him from.// He raked a hand through his hair, trying to think clearly. "Maybe... maybe there is somethin' wrong. But what're we supposed to do about it?"
Tony shrugged. "Barton killed a shitload of SHIELD agents before they took him in. And then there's Romanov. Banner broke the better part of New York City way before your army showed up. Your brother brought down half of Asgard on us. And you. Hell, they put up with me, and I've broken I don't know how many international laws. Pretty sure that Steve is... is the only one that hasn't..." He trailed off as his mind wandered to his lover, his jaw clenching as he realized that the whole conversation as likely pointless, anyway. Loki wasn't about to go turn himself over to the Avengers or SHIELD, and they both knew it. The god was going to toy with Coulson and Barton until they snapped or came close to it, let them go, and then make sure Tony was dead in fact rather than in theory. He took a deep breath. "Well, moot point, right? They won't trust you, and you won't trust them."
"Yeah, that would probably be a good idea." Clint could not even begin to imagine how awkward it might be involving Stark. Then again, if anyone was going to replace a high-tech prosthetic arm, there was no one better to oversee it than Tony. "You could *try* asking Stark, I suppose," he suggested guardedly. "Who knows? He might say yes for Steve's sake." It was the very definition of a long shot, but Clint had seen crazier shit happen.
"Well..." Clint glanced at Nat, then back to Phil. Outing the man in front if them all might have been crossing the line, but since they were already in pretty personal territory and he had Natasha’s blessing, Clint didn’t care. She would keep Phil from murdering him. "I hear," Clint said, quirking an eyebrow and giving Phil what was supposed to be a mock smoldering look but felt a little more sincere than he would have liked, "that you've got some pretty impressive equipment." Clint felt himself blush faintly as he said the words, but he was still too amused to feel self conscious about it.
The pair both beamed at the praise, and Simmons continued, "Dr. Banner has been absolutely invaluable. Honestly, I don't think we'd even have what to do if - and, of course Mr. Stark," she added when Tony looked offended at not being included to start with. "This is quite thrilling."
Logan felt his heart skip a little at affectionate touch. It vividly brought back some memories that he was pretty sure he didn't want Scott to know about. The way they'd been able to go at each other without concern for injury, the raw -  //Okay, think about something else before you have to explain a boner to both of 'em.// "Fine," he said, moving away from Steve's touch under the guise of grabbing the file. He was relieved to see it only seemed to address one particular subject, rather than his entire past. //Hopefully one that ain't too rocky.// Skimming through the files did little to jog his memory, but the fuzzy picture of the artifact was another story. Logan remembered fighting with everyone on the team that had found it and was supposed to be hiding it. He grimaced as he recalled struggling with a man not unlike himself, finally throwing him into an icy lake. "So, Stark was right. I do have a brother. Or did..." Glancing up at Steve, he remembered that the man was looking for something more weird artifact related.
"No. If I knew where she was, would your drunk ass still be sitting there?" Fury rubbed his forehead. "It'll be online in a few. This is a courtesy update." He looked Coulson over and then added, “Just make sure Barton's still alive in the morning."
When Phil looked ready to argue, Thor caught the man's eye and shook his head. Thor knew that pushing Clint on the matter at the moment would do no good, and that there was a fair chance of a dangerous outburst on Clint's part. The hammer had a powerful draw to it, especially for non-Asgardians.
Bucky, genuinely surprised to see Steve, perked up a little. "I'd be a lot better if you could spring me out of here," he answered honestly. A part of him was desperate to ask Steve how things had gone with Tony. He could easily lose his best friend to the other man. Then Steve would forget about him and Bucky would be left all alone. That sparked dangerous thoughts in his mind, thoughts of somehow getting Tony Stark out of the picture permanently. But Bucky quickly dismissed such reckless ideas. It frightened him how quickly violent notions entered his head. Realizing he'd zoned out for a moment, Bucky added with a light tone, "I think I've had enough migraines to last a lifetime."
Victor smirked, running his hands over Phil's sides, letting claw marks raise angry red welts along the man's flanks. "Gonna make you mine..." he breathed, running his tongue along the ridge of Phil's ear.
The response was so fast and sure that Steve hadn't even found a breath to thank Tony for his intervention when Logan was driving into him. He cried out, shocked but not at all displeased by the sudden entry. The burning edge of pain only made it that much more intense, and he would have been lying if he said he wanted anything but intense from a man like Logan. Anything else would have been sorely disappointing. Spots swam behind his tightly-clenched eyelids. Steve fought for breath and finally found it, sucking air in deeply and opening his eyes to find Logan's mouth again. The hungry kiss was a perfect way to get the man to settle for a second to let him adjust, and it sparked a perfect flicker of pleasure through the pain.
"Yeah, strangely not why I'm flinching," Tony grated out, taking a step back from the god. "Not to sound like I'm trying to talk you into not killing me, but I'd say you'd definitely have a marginally better chance of them not killing you if they find out you kept me alive." He moved toward the bathroom, adjusting the water for himself. He felt a stab of fear as he slid under the water, realizing he might well have to explain what had happened to Steve.
Steve winced but met his gaze evenly a beat later. "You know what he can do, Agent Coulson. This isn't my first choice either, but it's... we're trying it out."
Logan grinned a little, the touch raising pleasant goosebumps along his skin. He still couldn't remember anything new, but instincts told him that this wasn't a first time with another man for him. It felt too familiar, too comfortable. Steve was as awe-inspiring without his shirt as Logan would've guessed. The mutant didn't hesitate in reaching out to touch Steve's beautifully-developed torso, fingers tracing over strong muscles. Logan was leaning in for a kiss when he felt Tony press against his back, fingers sliding down his stomach and over the growing bulge in his jeans.
The suggestion, almost gentle considering who it came from, was enough like some of Steve's attempts to get Tony out of the lab after long days that his breath caught. It took a moment before he found his voice. "Yeah. I heard. That... it's a good idea. I could use a break. I'll meet you upstairs in a few minutes?" Steve knew that Logan was right. Pushing himself and not resting wasn't going to help anyone. Going back to his own room or to Tony's and being reminded of how lonely it was scared the hell out of him, though. "Some dinner sounds pretty good."
"I wanted to be here with you. Clothes are overrated." Even obviously in pain, it made him feel worlds better to see Tony acting like himself. "I'll change when you're ready to get some sleep. Rain check on that sleepover?"
"We're all here for you," Coulson offered quietly. "However this turns out, SHIELD still needs you." It didn't matter what Steve's body looked like, the mind and spirit inside it were the same ones that had brought the more victories than he could count already. "The rest can work itself out."
Realizing he was being a little ridiculous, Clint smiled more easily - and maybe a little sheepishly - and did as he was told, pressing himself close to Phil and sighing quietly. His handler felt warm and reassuring against him, and Clint found himself surprised at how comforting his presence was. Not to mention, Phil smelled fucking amazing. Clint had been too focused on other things earlier, and it just then occurred to him that the man's aftershave or soap or whatever the hell it was smelled absolutely fantastic. Clint's arm slid around Phil's waist, and he burrowed his face into the man's chest. "This feels good," he said quietly.
Logan looked at the armor with more curiosity than anything. It was interesting to note that Stark had left the suit for Rogers. It was strange to see something coming to fruition that Tony had started just before his death. "You look pretty beat up," he noted as he took in the split on the blonde's lip. "Think you oughta take a break? You know Coulson and Barton are back, right?" It didn't seem as if Steve had really left the lab since the team had left the planet. "You could eat and see how they're doin'."
Clint smiled back, opened his mouth to say something smartass, then shook his head. "I... No, actually. I mean, not that I'm above hearing dirty stories about you, but... no. That was perfect." He ran his thumb over Phil's, thinking quietly. "I was a lot older before I realized it. Dad was..." Clint choked a little on his words and shook his head. "Well, I didn't feel too safe telling anyone in my family much of anything that personal, and I got the feeling that being anything but 'normal' wasn't okay, so... I just tried not to let myself think too much about the fact that I'd catch myself staring a little too long at the other guys in the locker room or feel my pulse hike when I got to look through men's health magazines. I kinda managed to not think about it for a long while, and then I found myself in the circus." He smirked, looking a lot more relaxed. "They didn't see things as much in black and white. I was about sixteen when I joined."
As much as he hated to bring the moment down, Scott couldn't help but worry that Logan might be hurting more than he let on. "I know that you and Tony and Steve... it was just a one off thing, but..." He couldn't help thinking it had to make things hit a little harder and a little closer to home. “You sure you're okay? I mean, as okay as any of us can be at the moment?" They were all shaken. The whole Tower was a mess. He wondered if Tony's AI would continue on without maintenance, if the robots down in the lab would keep working. It was kind of creepy thinking about it, so he promptly stopped.
"Shit!" Clint nearly got trampled in the fracas, but his strangely acute reflexes saved him once more. He rolled out of the way, collecting his bow even as he dodged a massive green foot. "Goddammit, Bruce!" Clipping the hammer back to his belt, Clint managed to fire a few arrows at Loki, but Bruce was doing a good enough job of flinging the god around to make him a hard target, even for Clint.
Darien was still in the kitchen, and Clint couldn't help but smirk as he crept up behind the man. Pressing himself fully against Darien's back, he ran a hand down the man’s chest and took a firm grip of his cock through his jeans. "Gotta learn to keep your guard up better," he whispered in Darien's ear. "Something... bad... might happen."
That immediately got Clint's attention. "Closed door?" he echoed, not daring to hope. It had to be a big deal if Fury wasn't letting anyone else in on it. Especially Stark and his thirty pound brain. "Did they figure out what Loki's after?" He knew better than to think it was about Natasha. Fury didn't exactly regard people as expendable, but Clint also knew that whatever world-ending plot Loki had up his sleeve would be more likely to warrant Fury pulling only Rogers into a meeting.
This chapter is a threesome. Like, pretty much the entire chapter except a few paragraphs at the start and the end. Not into it? Skip it!
//Who indeed?// Phil shook his head at his own foolishness and nodded his agreement a second later. "Good point. We're supposed to be dressing down." There were only two screens in the theater, and only two options. Hoping it was a safe bet that Clint wouldn't want to see the Care Bear Movie, Phil asked for two tickets to Weird Science instead. When Clint looked at him strangely, he realized what he'd done and ducked his head. "Sorry. I don't go to the movies with anybody all that often. It's habit to just... pay." He pushed the door open and held it. "I might as well be a gentleman."
Loki chuckled and rolled onto his back next to the man. "As if it would ever be anything else with me." He clucked his tongue at the implication despite not sounding terribly offended. He didn't take lovers often, but that just meant that he felt it was even more important to make the time count. Of course, with the exception of Creed, lately it seemed that all of his lovers remained so only by some form of compulsion. Loki sighed heavily and let his eyes drift closed. "You will find that when I choose to be, I can be a worthwhile partner in more than one sense."
Coulson arched an eyebrow. "Mmmhmm," he answered without any apparent faith whatsoever. "Are you hungry? We don't know what's going to happen in the next couple of days. I want you fed and rested. My life might depend on it." If Logan broke down on top of whatever was happening otherwise with Loki, they'd need all hands on deck and in control. "What's your poison, Barton?" Coulson asked, already leading the way to the kitchen.
It felt like they were walking the green mile, and Coulson didn't care for it. He'd sworn immediately to Clint that he wouldn't let the man touch the gun, and he wouldn't. He just didn't want Steve touching it either. He noticed that Bruce hung back in the lab, which was probably for the best. The Hulk tended to gravitate toward Tony, and considering there was very little chance of Tony not getting upset, it would be at best a volatile situation. There were all silent on the walk because no one knew what to say. Coulson watched Steve's hand gravitate to Tony's shoulder, holding on while he still could, and his heart broke for the two of them. Even if everything was absolutely, completely fine, facing something like that, facing the thought of losing someone like that- He cut off the thought with a shudder. He wished he'd put on a suit. It would have felt less vulnerable. Standing there in his glasses and t-shirt with a bound Clint by his side, Coulson felt utterly and completely useless.
"Always," Coulson agreed without any hesitation at all, "though I suspect you're underestimating Clint."
Fury looked annoyed to see Loki. Then again, he usually looked annoyed about most things. He growled the god's name, sounding thoroughly disgusted that Loki was a prisoner and not a corpse. "Have a seat, gentlemen. And I guess the dead man can have a chair, too." He glowered at Steve. "Captain Rogers, if this... person did anything but surrender to you, I want a really good explanation of why he's still standing up."
It was one of those moments where Steve found himself honestly wishing that he was a little more inclined to violence. It was one thing fighting an opponent who was holding their own, but Loki wasn't. He wasn't even trying. While it was easy to believe that it was all an act, the fact that Tony didn't see it that way was enough to give him serious pause. "Right now, sir, I'm not sure what to think." He turned his gaze to Loki and drew himself up to full height, which wasn't much, though the armor helped add a little bit of bulk. "What's the angle?"
"I should imagine so. You're not too stupid to realize that he could kill you one day, and yet you keep him." Loki shook his head as if he was utterly unable to understand what SHIELD was thinking. It boggled his mind to think that anyone would purposefully keep around a creature that could destroy them. It had hadn't served Thor well, after all. Reaching out, Loki ran a hand down Stark's arm, curious to watch his reaction. This time he couldn't pretend it was Rogers. He was wearing his own face. "Then again, I suppose I haven't exactly thrown Creed out of bed either, so perhaps there's something to keeping a pet monster in the house."
"Then you know I'm not going to tell you shit." Fury sounded more exasperated than angry as he clasped his hands flat on the surface of the conference table. "We tried a few things. It worked. You're breathing. The details? Those aren't your business. You know exactly as much as you need to. Exactly."
"That's the easy part. Just remember that we're going to be seeing things that we can never unsee." Coulson led the way to his own room, a modest but comfortable suite that looked like an odd cross between a library and the room of a twelve year old boy. There were framed posters mixed with leather bound volumes of Shakespeare, but Coulson walked past it all to a study filled with file cabinets, a sleek computer, and a collection of monitors. It took a few keystrokes to bring one of the monitors to life, and they were looking into Logan's suite. "Just don't say I didn't warn you. Anyone who's ever had to watch Stark for any length of time has had to get therapy."
"End of the world can at least gimme eight hours a day of personal time," Tony decided between light kisses. He nuzzled at Steve's throat, running his fingers through the blonde's hair. It felt strange to have someone so delicate pressed against him and to know it was Steve. It was different, but someone smaller than him wasn't unfamiliar to Tony, and he still definitely wanted to do more than just make out. He knew Steve wouldn't allow it, though. "Besides, you have to make sure I take care of myself, remember?"
Loki felt the sudden hesitation and pressed his fingers against Tony's prostate. "Let me hear you moan." He wondered if Rogers was ever commanding. He was certainly in charge in the battlefield, but that didn't always translate to the bedroom. For all Loki knew the man preferred to spend his time being fucked into the mattress and giving up all power. It didn't matter. Stark was going to need to get used to something with a bit more edge. At least this way he could ease into it. "I rather enjoy the sound."
Steve let out a shuddering groan against Tony's neck. He knew they couldn't follow through, but the promise turned him on to the point where he could barely see straight. "Close," he murmured, kissing Tony's shoulder, his neck, finally his lips. It took only a few more rough thrusts before Steve came, chanting Tony's name like a mantra. He did his best to maintain a decent pace with his hand. Steve wanted more than anything to make Tony feel every bit as good as he did.
"It is," Jemma answered, her eyes sparkling. She was flattered that he'd remembered, silly and small a thing as that was. "That doesn't mean that it can't seem like magic. Awful as it is to say, I almost wish that we could get hold of Loki for awhile, study him... well, that's neither here nor there." There wasn't much chance of that unless it was to perform an autopsy. When the Avengers went after Loki this time, it wouldn't be to bring him in as a prisoner. "Once things are more settled, maybe we could have a proper dinner together?" They weren't even done with one casual date, and she knew that fishing for a second might be pushing things, but it was going well. Being with Bruce was surprisingly comfortable, and she hoped that he felt the same way.
"I'd offer you one for the road but you'd puke it up. You might want to reconsider calling Darien. I learned a great many years ago in the most embarrassing way possible that there's a fine line between fun drunk and performance inhibiting drunk." Phil patted Clint's shoulder. "You, my friend, are the latter. Let's get you back to your room for some sleep before you have to wake up and start enjoying your hangover."
Tony snorted. "As long as you two don't insist on fighting in the back seat on long road trips, I think we can manage." It was almost amusing to picture in his head: Loki and Thor sitting at opposite ends of a cafeteria table, asking each other by proxy to pass the salt and so on. "I think a squabble between the two of you might break New York." He fell silent for a moment. He'd forgotten about Logan. According to the mutant's file, he had a nose far more powerful than a bloodhound's. No real hiding anything from him. Then again, Logan also seemed the sort to let other people take care of things on their own. Tony doubted he'd have to say much. "I mean, I'm not really polite to anyone, but they put up with me somehow."
It was part of the image. He'd known that for a long time - decades, really, even if he hadn't been awake for many of them. Steve sighed and tried to smile politely as the man in front of him droned on and on about the bills he intended to put before Congress. It wasn't that Steve didn't care, precisely, but he hardly considered a party the appropriate venue for someone trying to curry political favor. //Reality's not on my side with this one.// As usual, he'd bowed to the wishes of his erstwhile handlers, donned a fancy suit that he'd been told was Armani and gone out into the fray to play politics.
"Yeah," Clint nodded, rubbing at the back of his head and raking a hand through already disheveled hair. "Yeah, I'd say you've got a good sized blind spot for me," he agreed, thinking back to what he'd done to Scott. He was pretty sure Coulson would have thrown anybody else in the brig, probably with Logan. "Good thing, too, or I think Fury would've already had me put to sleep," he said with a faint smile. "Appreciate it. You sticking your neck out for us. You're... you're pretty much the only friend I have. You and Nat."
Tony nodded, smiling faintly. "See, now you know how I felt," he said, giving his lover a wink. "I'll see if I can argue with the doc to get you out of here," he said, looking at the mass of medications. Allergy pills, asthma meds, a few other things Tony couldn't even recognize. //God. He must've been so sick.// Tony realized that it was probably Steve's strength of will that had even let him survive to adulthood with the kind of medical problems he'd had, especially with no doctor. His gaze fixed on Steve. "I want you home, too." He pressed a few soft kisses to Steve's lips. "Coulson's been on my couch, making sure I sleep. I think I'd rather just have you in my bed." He pushed himself off the edge of the gurney and went back to his wheelchair. "I'll be right back. If you hear yelling, it means I'm negotiating the terms of your release."
"Get ready," Scott shot toward Logan, sending a blast straight at Loki. It wasn't going to hurt him, and it didn't, but it did slam Loki back against the wall - giving at least one shot without the god moving or having as much opportunity to dodge. It would have been a lot more helpful if Hulk had been able to immobilize Loki more fully, but Hulk was still chasing Quicksilver like a dog chasing its own tail.
Victor smirked, glad to know he wasn't the only one ready for the main event. Straightening, he drew away from Loki and grabbed one of the various bottles from the collection Loki had indicated. It had been a subtle hint, and Victor hadn't missed it. Not about to displease the god, he slicked himself up, then smeared a bit over Loki's cock. His fingers trailed lower, slicking his partner's balls and then his deliciously tight-looking pucker. Corking the bottle and tossing it aside, Victor moved closer to Loki once again, then grinned broadly as he grabbed the other man's slender hips, his claws digging into the flesh as he took a firm hold. "Think we'll do a different angle," he decided, using his hold to flip Loki onto his stomach. Victor allowed his throbbing shaft to rest between firm, lean buttocks as he bored down on Loki, pinning him to the mattress. "Much better."
"Easy. Take it easy," Tony urged, taking a few more moments before he finally started working another finger in. Tony wanted to melt right then and there at the way Steve's body squeezed him so fucking perfectly. "J-just remember you won't heal... Fuck, you..." Tony took a deep breath, realizing he was shaking a little with the force of the arousal he was feeling. Watching Steve's lips part and his fair skin flush pink was enough to make Tony crazy.
Clint was just wondering the same thing about the mug when Phil called him out. He reflexively opened his mouth to agree to pretending it hadn't happened if that's what Phil wanted, then shut it again when he realized that that might not be what Phil wanted. He'd honestly expected it to be something along those lines. The archer fiddled nervously with his still-empty mug, rolling the bright yellow ceramic around on the counter as he tried to figure out what he wanted. "I love Nat," he said quietly to the countertop, then looked up. "But... she's never gonna love me." He smiled ruefully as he played with the mug some more, chewing on his lips. "The guys are filler. Distractions." He set the mug on the counter upside-down. "Nat was trying to set us up." He was thinking the whole thing through out loud, trying to sort out all the facts. Finally, he looked up at Phil, still smiling faintly, though he mostly just looked lost. "I guess... maybe you should tell me what you want, 'cause I'm not sure of what I want," he finally admitted.
"Thank you," Scott answered, too tired and overwrought to be anything but stiffly formal. He swallowed and climbed into bed next to Logan. Once upon a time, the man wouldn't have so much as said a kind word to him in such a situation, let alone given up half his bed. Scott should have been ashamed of his own weakness, and he was in a way, but it felt too good having someone close to let himself overthink it. Instead Scott closed his eyes and finally drifted into an exhausted sleep.
"Feels more like that when you're in it," Phil agreed. He wasn't saying it to make Clint feel beholden somehow, he simply wanted the man to know what his presence meant. It made Phil feel strangely whole when he woke up to Clint's smile and to the way he clung to his coffee mugs like they were a buoy and he was a drowning man. It was adorable and familiar and warmed his heart every time. "You remind me that it's not all about the job. It's easy to forget to be a person sometimes when you're on your third twelve hour shift in a row. I'd feel like I was drowning in paperwork and then you'd be there sitting on my couch so... so normal. I'd remember to breathe."
Phil recovered slowly from the sight and finally shook his head. "I'm even more convinced now that you're the terrible influence," he decided. He tried to look disgruntled, but it was difficult when the sight of Clint taking half of the bar down had been far too close to more intimate activities, and it had left him barely able to think about anything but the night before. "Terrible influence," he grumbled again before returning to eating. Phil couldn't quite drag his gaze away from Clint again, though, watching the movement of his throat as he chewed and the wicked glimmer in his eyes. "You're making it very difficult to try to re-establish that I'm actually not easy."
Bruce, hands still in his pockets as he moved to another row of shelves, started looking through the massive collection. "I think I saw this place on an episode of Hoarders."
"Yeah... fuck, yeah, definitely," Scott agreed without hesitation. He'd enjoyed the addition of Natasha to their fun. There had been no strangeness or jealousy despite his initial fears. Instead her attitude and obvious focus on wanting to enjoy herself - and them - had translated to something that was good for all of them. It hurt to think that she in too much pain for awhile to really enjoy any time with them, but he didn't talk about it. It was too fresh a hurt, and he just wanted to enjoy his own lover, who was whole and gorgeous and there. Scott rocked his hips and twisted until he found Logan's lips blindly with his own, sealing them together and kissing away the momentary concern.
Logan gladly obliged, his free hand tangling none-too-gently in Scott's hair. He ground himself against the man's thigh and groaned his arousal against his lover's perfect lips. He let go of Scott's cock for a moment to shove his own boxers down to his knees, then tugged Scott's up a bit. Logan swiped his hand over Scott's cock once more, gathering precum on his fingertips to smear on his lover's twitching hole. If Scott wanted to forget, Logan was going to make him; he slowly pushed the tip of one digit in, his tongue still sliding along Scott's, more or less fucking his mouth.
Steve couldn't quite resist grabbing Tony's ass as the man typed in the security code to open his locked suite. "Type faster," he ordered in his best commander voice before smiling and sliding one of his hands into Tony's back pocket to add an extra layer of distraction.
Phil smiled at the idea and hummed his approval as he slid one omelette onto a plate and started the other, then shifted the bacon in the pan. It had, somewhere along the way, become habit to cook for both himself and Clint when time and missions allowed. He wasn't sure when it happened, but he was glad it had. It felt brilliantly, perfectly domestic. Their friendship was established, but it was too early to put pressure on the rest. Phil honestly hoped that however it came down he wouldn't have to get used to always cooking for one again. "I might just order a pair or two. The upside of me being me is that no one's going to have the guts to say anything while I'm changing at the gym."
Logan didn't like the idea of rushing the whole process, but Scott was right. //Or maybe you just don't like the idea o' him gettin' done so soon and leavin'.// "Alright. Guess that'd be easier, anyway." //For both of us.// Logan wasn't entirely sure he'd be able to keep from walking off and finding every last dirtbag he'd already encountered and killing them horribly if he had to hear all the details.
Scott wondered if he would have ever been able to do the same things with someone else and suspected not. He trusted Logan with his life, so trusting him with embarrassing sexual proclivities didn't seem like that big a deal. It was so damn much easier than it had been with Jean that it was laughable. When Logan dragged all three fingers against his prostate, Scott's whole body bucked, his legs spreading wide to give Logan as much access as humanly possible. He gladly bared himself for Logan in a way he never had for anyone else. "You're so fucking hot like this. Sometimes I'm not quite sure if you're going to fuck me or eat me alive."
Steve had the grace to blush at being called out. "Give us a half hour, Clint." He knew he couldn't afford to let Tony stay with him no matter how much he wanted it, but that didn't mean he was above insisting on keeping Tony to himself for a short period of time. "Bruce could use the breather anyway." There would be no good argument to that and Steve damn well knew it.
It took a few more shaky minutes to build back up again. Steve was eternally grateful for the fact because he loved the feeling of Tony driving him toward the brink of absolute insanity. He whimpered and forced himself back and then forward, cock twitching in Tony's hand. He let out breathless moans with every punishing thrust. The head of Tony's swollen cock massaged him from the inside until Steve could barely do more than hold on for the ride. Soon he felt his whole body tense before exploding in one of the most satisfying climaxes he'd experienced  in his life. Steve knew he murmured Tony's name, but otherwise the roaring of his own heartbeat in his ears covered any sound.
"Barton!" Phil reached out, grabbing Clint's shoulder and spinning him before he could unravel any further. He made sure the other man was looking straight at him. "We're going to get them back. Right now, there's still work to do. Summers, keep tech on the video feeds. We need to know if there's another end on that rainbow. The flash was blinding on this end."
Fury met his gaze evenly. "I don't care. I don't wanna know. Cap trusts you, I'm willing to give you a chance. You help my team get back in one piece and then we talk."
"It made me feel a lot better too," Phil agreed. "I actually don't know if I would've gotten through it so smoothly without you. Taking a few minutes to feel just... just human again. Sometimes I guess I get a little swallowed up by the suit." He knew that sometimes he let the persona take over, lost Phil a little beneath the veneer of Agent Coulson. "So if I can help you slow down every now and then, maybe you can help me unwind a little more often. It's easy to forget I'm not actually married to my desk even though she and I have been in an exclusive relationship for quite a few years."
"Is it weird that I get goosebumps when you do that?" Tony asked, giving Steve a look that made it completely unclear as to whether he was serious.
"Good point. Up to now, the best they could do was Bobby Drake, the professional metrosexual," Logan pointed out from the back seat as they rolled down the underground ramp into the Avengers' garage.
Steve finally took a breath and nodded. "Thank you. It may not feel like much, but it's a lot more than I had five minutes ago." He took the file and allowed more breathing space between himself and Logan. Looking to Scott, he added, "I'm sorry about the interruption."
"Find out where this is coming from," Steve broke in, his throat tight. The camera was pulled in tight on Tony's pale, groggy features and then pulled back, the action jerky and mechanical, until he could see that the man was actually nude and strapped to some sort of metal table. Torn between looking away and not wanting to miss a second in case it gave away some hint as to Tony's location, Steve sank down onto the couch. //At least he's alive...//
The morning came with light through the window and the smell of coffee brewing. Tony was never up before him, which meant that he'd never gone to sleep. Probably up all night. Steve smiled and stretched… and saw Pepper's shoes lying next to the bed. It came crashing back down so hard and so fast that Steve found himself reaching for his inhaler to have even a chance to catch his breath.
"We look ridiculous," Phil observed as he took Clint's hand. He didn't really mind. Clint was worth looking ridiculous for. "Well, I look ridiculous. You actually look kind of gorgeous. Why do you look gorgeous when you're blushing? I just look like I got winded running up the stairs." The complaint lacked venom, and soon they found the stands to procure the items they'd decided on with a last minute addition of spiral cut potatoes. "If we're going to do the fair food, we might as well do this all the way. There's no more certain way to prevent sex than eating enough to make you feel like you never want to move again."
The archer didn't reply, instead sliding to his knees in the most graceful way imaginable, his hands still tangled in Phil's pants. He tugged pants and underwear away far enough to get at the goods, leaning in until he knew Coulson would feel his breath, then pausing and looking up. He made sure he had his handler's full attention before he slowly licked a line up Phil's cock. His hands were inside Phil's shirt again, callused fingers tracing circles on hot skin as he savored the taste of Phil's arousal on his tongue.
"And what are you planning on doing if Natasha has heard something?" Tony wondered, returning his attention to the rest of his breakfast. "You and I had a deal, remember? No going off on your own." He pointed his fork in Steve's direction, emphasizing his words. "We're doing this together." Even as he spoke, Tony felt another sharp pang in his ribs but tried to swallow the reaction. The last thing he wanted was for Steve to discover he was in more discomfort than he was letting on.
"You should try his margaritas," Hank chimed in jovially, still casually searching through all the bits and bobs. "Agent Coulson, you should probably talk to SHIELD about their cataloging system. Rather messy."
Though Simmons rolled her eyes, she was smiling too. "Of course, Captain Rogers. We'd love to have you."
Coulson let out a slow breath and nodded. "I know." He wanted to hear that Natasha was okay too. He also knew that Clint was rarely wrong when he was absolutely certain of something. If Clint was sure Logan was somehow hiding something? He was probably right. Medical wasn't the place to deal with it, though.
Steve didn't entirely disagree, but he was stopped dead in his track when he actually saw Bucky, unconscious on the floor and being snapped into cuffs by Clint. He was frozen for a moment as anger and relief and fear warred for a place in the moment. He finally settled on looking for Tony instead and finding the man looking haggard and half dressed with Natasha's hands carefully keeping him on his feet. "Tony... are you okay?" Of course he wasn't okay, but Steve could think of nothing else to say. He wanted more than anything to rush forward, grab the man and hug him until he couldn't breathe. After everything Tony had been through, the last thing he needed was someone invading his space.
Coulson couldn't help but be curious precisely as Clint had intended. He reached up to stroke his fingers through Clint's hair. "Something I don't know? I didn't know there were such things." He wasn't actually quite as much of a know it all as most of his coworkers tended to think, but Phil kept on top of things. He did his homework, so to speak, and it showed. Leaning down until his lips almost touched Clint's ear, he whispered, "Any way I could convince you to tell me sooner?"
"Thank you, Jarvis." Reluctantly, Phil shifted and offered Clint a faint smile. "No rest for the wicked. You ready for this?"
Darien shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He'd always believed that when scary people got scared, it was time to bolt. Watching Clint submit so easily to the woman made him wonder exactly how many men she'd killed with her scary mind powers. On the other hand, watching Clint submit was also kind of hot.
"I happen to be fond of your thighs. I'm pretty sure I still will be even if there's more of them," Phil decided, tucking into the food with equal vigor. "I'll be hitting the gym tomorrow. Possibly for most of the day after this, to be honest." It took a lot more than it had once upon a time to keep off the extra weight, but he also indulged so heavily no more than a few times a year. It was a treat, not a lifestyle, which generally afforded him something of a buffer even when his job kept him on his ass at a desk for long, frustrating stretches. "Thankfully I know I'll regret this later otherwise I'd be worried about doing it too often."
That was the Clint that she knew, and Natasha smiled. "I wish I could get a video of the look on his face when you say something. I already missed out getting yours." She sighed at her own lack of preparedness. "I really am tired if I missed an opportunity like that. Speaking of which, I need sleep. You can stay. I'd like you to stay, actually, but I need sleep. Lots of sleep. You look well rested, and that sort of sickens me at the moment, but you're warm." Natasha swung her legs off of the couch and rose, holding out a hand to Clint. "C'mon."
Clint smiled, feeling himself blush a little. "It was pretty cheesy, really. Just a lot of me doing a lot of acrobatics and shooting things while wearing spandex." He was downplaying it, but he hated bragging on himself. People had loved his act, especially the mercenaries that had offered him an opportunity to 'really utilize' his talents. "Though I guess if you've seen me on an op, it's about the same. Just less trapeze and more people getting dead."
"I've got a tall, blue-eyed, blonde drink of water with me and you think there's any hope of not getting noticed?" Tony offered his partner a wink and squeezed Steve’s hand in return. "At least they've got technology now. No more getting a giant camera rammed up your nose. Usually, anyway. There was this time I was in Russia and-" The waiter arriving with their food and two glasses of wine interrupted him.
Steve hadn’t known until that moment that a computer could sound so pissy. He rubbed his forehead with one hand. “This is not gonna be pretty.”
Bruce refrained from commenting; Clint looked like he was going off the rails. The scientist instead tilted his head at Loki, eyes narrowed suspiciously. "What did you mean? 'Things aren't as they seem.' What are you-?"
Fury stared hard at Loki, surprised to see nothing but fear and vulnerability there. That was something he'd yet to see in the Asgardian. "So, let me get this straight: you show up, try to kill us all, turn one of my best agents into your personal playtoy, go to prison, break out, break one of my Avengers, nearly kill one, abduct two of my best agents... I'm sure I'm leaving things out here, but you get the idea. And now you want me to let you not only live, but stay here and join the Avengers?"
Instead of a stronghold of power, their temporary base felt like a cell. Every time he moved, Loki's broken ribs reminded him of the damage that the hammer could do. It was a power that was his to wield, not theirs. Breaking them wasn't enough, obviously. They would have to be disposed of more permanently. The Avengers were becoming a very frustrating liability.
Thor gripped the hammer tightly as it quivered in his hand, trying to answer Clint's call much as Mjolnir would Thor's. Fortunately, Mjolnir seemed to give Thor the strength to resist its counterpart's pull both literally and figuratively.
"I suppose someone has to." The longer they moved together the less appropriate it all felt. Phil was having trouble remembering that getting hard and grinding against a coworker was a terrible idea, especially when said coworker had never shown any romantic interest in him. "What are we doing right now, Clint?" He needed some idea before it went so far off the rails that they couldn't get it back on. "It's starting to feel like more than dancing."
Natasha let her smile broaden at the words, glad to hear that the pair were bonding. She supposed there was one other option, but given that she hadn't seen him all day, it sounded like a long shot. "What about the other one?" she asked, clarifying, "The tall one with the nice ass?" Of course Natasha remembered Darien's name, but that didn't mean she cared what it was. Unless Clint actually cared, it didn't matter. She wasn't likely to see him anywhere but passing by in the halls, which might prove awkward for Darien, but she didn't particularly care one way or another. Natasha wondered how Clint would take her casually equating his interactions with both men. For someone who'd known her for so long, sometimes it was surprisingly easy to pull Clint's strings.
She rolled her eyes. "It's not exactly a state secret. You really need to relax." She nodded over Phil's shoulder. "And you really shouldn't leave a friend hanging like that. Slap the man's hand." When Phil continued to look at her like she'd lost her mind, Natasha crossed and slapped Clint's palm herself. "There. I got laid too, after all. I suppose I deserve as much credit as you do. Maybe more. It was my idea."
It was Logan's turn to feel a little nervous, and not just because they were dropping altitude. He remembered how easy it had been for Xavier to toy with his mind, and Chuck hadn't had any bad intentions. "I'm startin' to get an idea," he said, gripping his seat white-knuckled as the plane careened wildly to one side and the pilot notified them it was time to get off.
Clint nodded. "Fury hasn't mentioned it. Which makes me think he knows something." Fury staying silent sometimes was more telling than when he actually gave someone information. "And, uh, sorry about the coffee. I mean, the you finding me... when I was... Sorry," he said, clearing his throat. Bad enough Coulson had been under orders to watch everything Clint did for who-knew-how-long. It had to be even more awkward catching Clint's act live. "I'll, uh, try not to... indulge so much. Here."
"They t...ake some getting used to," Tony replied, his voice catching as Steve's lips moved across the perfect spot on his neck, near his collarbone. "Repulsors." When Steve's eyes flicked up at him, he clarified in the most distracted voice ever, "They're r... repulsors - and fuck, that's the right spot," he breathed, squirming against his lover. "Besides, you'll heal. Fast." He nibbled at Steve's jaw, not minding the faint saltiness one bit. "Maybe I could... put in... What are we talking about?" he wanted to know, his fingers fairly digging into Steve's back.
"When you out it that way, it sounds much more appealing," Tony noted. He slid into the shower, tugging Steve along with him. He couldn't resist just holding the blonde under the hot spray for a long while before he finally made himself grab the shampoo and start washing Steve's hair. "I am definitely looking forward to waking up next to you. You're cuddly," Tony mumbled happily. Between the sex and the hot shower, he was starting to feel relaxed and sleepy.
Tony grinned, squirming a little to shift and unzip Steve's pants sufficiently to let him slide his hand in. "Good enough," he agreed, leaning down for a long, slow kiss. "Hope you're as flexible as you are ripped, or this's gonna be awkward as hell." After all, neither of the men were exactly short. Tony had managed to get in a good fuck or two in much more cramped spaces. Deciding they'd worry about it one step at a time, Tony lightly trailed his fingers over Steve's cock before leaning down to give one of the man's nipples a few light licks and beginning to suckle at it.
Victor chuckled quietly, watching Clint's face. "That's right..." His tongue flicked out over his lips. He glanced up at Coulson. "Much more responsive than you were. Have you fucked him yet? Just wondering if I could get the same sounds out of him that you do."
Unable to get a decent grip on Tony's wheelchair, Clint stood back and looked to Coulson. They didn't all need to sit at Steve's bedside, but he'd be damned if he'd leave even Tony Stark to face something like this completely alone.
