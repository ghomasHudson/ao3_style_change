Dean walks slowly over to where Cas is standing. There’s so much blood. It’s staining Dean’s old shirt.
“Doesn’t matter. He’s gone,” Dean whispers to the encyclopedia in front of him.
Dean miscalculated his ability to balance, and ended up crashing into Cas. Cas caught him before they both ate shit, and then they were giggling like little kids, trying to stay quiet with Jack only a few feet away. Cas’s hands were hot against his waist, and Dean didn’t care how there was only a breath of space between them.
There’s a chip in the concrete right by the sole of his right boot, and Dean presses his thumb into it until the jagged stone starts to cut into his skin. The pain is familiar, but it doesn’t stop the pounding of his heart. Before he can do anything else, his mind conjures up his own words above the rushing of blood in his ears.
Dean knocks back the rest of his drink. It burns warm in his throat. Dean doesn’t mean it when he sends it falling to the floor to shatter in a million, glittering pieces. His hand is shaking so bad, and he tries to stand to clean it up, but Sam tells him
“Sammy, I’m sorry,” Dean tries to say as Sam gets up to throw out the shards, but the words get stuck in his throat.
“I dreamed,” Castiel says into the silence, right hand itching to touch the hair brushing over his busted knuckles. “I’ve never dreamed before.”
Dean thinks again about deals and consequences. This must be the consequence. His life for his Grace.
“No,” Cas says, always so blunt.
. After a few moments of being wrapped up in each other, Dean pulled away for a breath, their foreheads resting together.
Dean opens his mouth to say something, but his voice fails him. Sam begins to walk towards him, but the crunch of glass stops him in his tracks. He stoops down to pick up the remnants of Dean’s phone.
Dean threads the needle, and before he starts, he grabs a fresh bottle of Jack Daniel’s from the pantry. He twists off the cap, takes a swig, and offers it to Cas. Cas takes it, and appraises it. He brings it to his lips, and takes a shot of his own. Dean watches everything. Cas scrunches his nose against the taste, and Dean’s chest aches.
Dean shakes his head, jaw locked up tight, teeth clenched. He slides his elbows up on the table and holds his head in his hands. Dean thinks if he doesn’t hold himself up, he’s going to shatter just like that glass. Thousands of tiny little pieces Dean all over the floor, no chance of being put back together again.
“I don’t know how to dance,” Cas said in that serious way of his, squinting down at their socked feet.
“What happened?”
You gotta pick, Cas.
It drives Dean up the damn wall is what it does.
Jack’s questions tear Dean out of his thoughts.
He understands that there’s no use. It’s just himself alone, no one with their ears on to listen to his begging, but it doesn’t stop him.
Cas hisses out something that sounds a lot like
Silence again. So much silence.
and more than once
Dean knows he looks like a mess. His cheeks are tight from the dried tears, and snot is dripping from his nostrils. He can feel the dried blood on his temple. Sam takes another look around the room and holsters his gun. He doesn’t come any closer.
“One of these days, I’m just gonna throw this in the fucking trash where it belongs,” Dean huffs, sweat already pooling on the back of his neck and the dip of his back.
“Fuck,” he hisses, reaching for his knife out of instinct, but when he looks down and sees what’s lying before him, Dean collapses to his knees.
“It’s okay. I think I’ll go to my room now.”
It was just one of many, many Christmas Eves together to come.
They work in tandem all day--Dean fetching water, and Cas spreading fertilizer. Dean waits till a little after five to mow. The tractor refuses to cooperate with him, and Dean handles the situation like any other grown man and shouts himself hoarse. He surrenders once the sun starts its descent, shadows bleeding along the barn floor like ink, and threatens he’ll be back tomorrow with the proper tools, fresh oil, and some fuel.
Dean’s seated to his left in an old foldout chair. He’s unnervingly pale, which in turn brings out the dark circles beneath his eyes. Castiel doesn’t have to ask to be sure he hasn’t slept.
They have time.
There’s always a catch. Dean knows this. No deal is ever equal. Been there, done that. He doesn’t know what this means that Cas didn’t wake up once they got out. He didn’t stop breathing, so that’s the silver lining Dean is going to cling to for a while.
“You really know how to sweet talk a guy, you know that?” Dean laughs, but it comes out high and nervous.
Sam hums, keeps looking at him with those endlessly sad eyes. He reaches out a hand, and Dean hands over the bottle. Sam studies it for a moment, and then knocks back a shot of his own. He winces, and sets it on the table with a muted thud.
, Kafka
There’s a massive crick in his neck, and his spine pops in three different places. Jesus, he’s getting too old for this. Sam offers the coffee to Dean like some sort of olive branch. He takes it gladly.
“Where’s Cas?” Sam asks, quieter now.
Jack.
“Dean, listen,” Sam starts after he comes back. “I know something happened. I know you don’t want to talk about it. Hell, I don’t… I get it. But I gotta know what we’re up against here. Was it Billie?”
“Dean, I am sorry that circumstances were not different. I knew that the only way for you to get out alive was if I let the Empty take Billie and I together. The things I said were true, and I meant them, but you have no obligation to acknowledge them. They were a means to an end, and for that, I apologize. You do not have to talk about it.”
A single tear clings to Dean’s left eye, pooling along his lash line. He swipes at it before it can fall.
Cas was still holding onto Dean, and Dean let him. He surveyed the records Cas had brought out. There was an old Christmas collection one, and Dean figured that was good enough as any.
“Cas, hey, it’s me. It’s me, and I’m here, now. I’m here. We’re going home. You’re coming home with me. I found you,” Dean babbles, nearly hysterical.
Once Jack is satisfied that Cas is, in fact, not dead, they all manage to move Cas off the floor, and into Dean’s room. There’s no question as to why, and Dean isn’t sure either, but it feels right for now. Cas doesn’t wake up during any of it, even when Jack accidentally bangs his unsupported head against the doorframe. The three of them stand around the bed for a minute and just stare at where Cas is lying crooked on the bed. Dean makes the first move, which is to gently wrap Cas up in a spare blanket he keeps under the bed. Dean lingers after he makes sure nothing except Cas’s head is exposed. He looks ridiculous in this makeshift cocoon. He lifts his hand to smooth down a stray hair that had fallen across Cas’s brow.
A familiar palm settles over the back of Dean’s hand and he doesn’t hold back the wide smile fighting to tug up the corners of his mouth. He can feel sunburn on his cheeks, but it doesn’t fucking matter.
going to be a weepy drunk. That was Sam’s job. Of course, Dean was happy. His family was alive and together. Dean got to feed them, keep them warm, and tomorrow, they would all wake up and he would get to do it over again. And the cherry on top? Dean was dancing with someone who looked at him in a way he didn't know how to handle, not like he was just a pretty face. He couldn’t believe this was his life, that he was this lucky.
Cas hummed, and Dean tracked the way his eyes flicked down to Dean’s lips. He swallowed around the lump in his throat, and blinked away the wetness in his eyes. Jesus, he was
“Yeah,” Dean grunts back.
“What time is it?” Jack asked, rubbing at his eyes and yawning.
“Where do you think you’re going, hot shot?”
“I don’t understand. Why would anyone hope for inclement weather?” Cas breathed as soon as they pulled apart.
Dean does the only thing he knows how to do. He cooks breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He makes Cas eat, even though he knows he doesn’t have to. He makes him coffee, tea, brings him water. Dean even washes his clothes, for Christ’s sake, and sets out some fresh ones of his own as a choice. Cas wears them, and Dean pretends it doesn’t please him as much as it does. There’s something different about Cas that he can’t quite put his finger on. He seems smaller, the lines of his face more pronounced. Cas looks just as worn out as Dean.
When he wakes up, Castiel’s inside one of the bunker’s spare rooms that’s filled to the brim with old files and cardboard boxes. There are three pillows shoved behind his aching back. When he tries to sit up further, his chest erupts into searing pain.
“Did Cas say anything before it happened—whatever it was that happened?”
He picks up the entire bottle this time, and takes a long swig. He doesn’t want it. It curdles in his stomach the second he swallows. He thinks he’s gonna puke, but not from the alcohol.
“Cas!” Dean yells as loud as he can.
Today, Dean finds himself hauling that dumbass watering can across the lawn he still has to mow later (
Castiel realizes he is okay with this. There’s nowhere that his grace could take him that would make him happier than here, nothing it could grant him that would fill the emptiness in him quite like the soft wisps of brown hair tickling his fingers, or the warmth of the quilt tucked in around his sore legs, or the lulling exhales of the man beside him.
It was new, this thing between them. It was new to be looking at Cas, and when Cas caught him, not feeling like he had to look away. It was thrilling, made his stomach churn and his nerves feel like exposed wires. Cas’s palm was as calloused as Dean’s was from too many rough hunts since he’d gone full human, and Dean gave it a squeeze as he started to sway.
“It doesn’t matter,” Dean says, and fixes Sam with a stare that he hopes conveys how serious he is.
“I don’t know. This is how I found him. He was breathing before,” Dean says, shifting Cas gently off of him so that he’s laying fully on his back on the bunker floor.
“I came down here to tell you that you can,” Dean says.
Sometimes, Dean looks at Cas, takes in his uncut hair and quiet smiles, the way he slouches when he sits, how his hands shake when it’s a cold, and thinks,
“Don’t,” Cas murmurs, wincing as he tries to flex his hand.
Cas takes off his hat for a moment, fanning himself and flashing Dean a tiny grin as if they’re sharing some great secret.
Dean prays, even though he knows Cas can’t hear him anymore
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. It’s me. Didn’t mean to scare you,” Dean says, holding out his hands in an attempt at a calming gesture. “It’s just me.”
, and it punches a laugh out of Dean. He hasn’t laughed in ages.
“Yeah, Cas. We’re real,” Dean says, echoing Cas’s words to him from when Dean had been having his existential Chuck-centric crisis.
It’s hard to focus on anything. He squints at the fluorescent lights, and tries to rub away all the spots clouding his vision.
“Dude, the hell?” Dean said, slurring, and wow, yeah, he was a lot drunk.
“It’s so fucking unfair,” Dean says, shakes his head, and hates the way his voice breaks.
He doesn’t know what makes him say what he says next, but Dean says its anyway
He can feel his grace splintering as if it were a mere piece of rotted wood. It crackles, sparks, breaks apart and drifts out through the hollow space in his chest that’s part exit wound and part delirium. They were tiny pieces at first, small enough that Castiel could pretend that the feeling of being sucked dry was his imagination. Now, it’s as if whatever’s left is racing to escape and find a new home, like a hermit crab tired of its shell. He imagines the hole widening to accommodate the efflux, and presses a calloused hand to the spot above his pounding heart, prodding at the useless armor of skin that’s torn to shreds. His useless armor of
“Is he okay? What’s wrong? Why isn’t he awake?”
Okay, so maybe he was a lot drunk, but it wasn’t his idea to put Sam in charge of the alcohol. Dean was basically drinking straight whiskey the entire evening with a spritz of eggnog after his idiot brother had his way.
He had to fiddle with the volume, but then, Sinatra was crooning
Dean muses, and he returns the private smile Cas gives him from across the room as he helps Sam and Jack divide up the canned goods they snagged from the convenience store in the next town over.
“Oh,” Sam says. “Well, that’s one less thing on the list.”
“Dean, I know. He’s—he was my friend, too, but the entire world got zapped, and Billie’s still on the loose, and now you’re telling me Cas is gone—“
Castiel can sense the anger, the pure rage, but it’s as if Dean’s too exhausted to both play and look the part. Dean sags like a deflated balloon, forehead pressed directly to the thin sheets bunched around Castiel’s thighs, hands palm down on either side of his head. He looks defeated.
Dean doesn’t know what else to do, except start walking. He hesitates to yell for Cas. He’s worried about what else might be lurking around here. He thinks about how he’d been up late with the TV on, and there’s been some space documentary talking about dark matter. He can picture the way they’d animated it, how one moment there had been a star, the next second nothing but the emptiness of space. That’s what the Empty reminds him of. Something there, but not quite there. Something just out of sight.
“Yeah, so am I, Cas,” Dean says, and settles his shaking hand over the hole in Cas’s jeans just above his kneecap. “Sam says he’s gonna come visit next Wednesday with Eileen.”
Dean knows. He knows this is when he should say it. They’re alone, and he’s thought this over so many times. He’s rehearsed it in the mirror as he’s brushed his teeth. In the shower. Making coffee. At one in the morning.
on one of the supporting poles in Sharpie. If he’s being honest with himself, Dean actually kind of likes it. In fact, if he’s being entirely honest, he’ll admit to sometimes retracing the words while Cas is busying uprooting weeds and humming some Top 40s song Dean knows the tune of but not the lyrics.
. His plan is working so far. Whatever protection they’d placed around Jack had actually kept him from getting sucked in with Dean.
Castiel thinks he’s dying.
“You’re real,” Cas mutters, tracing the baby hairs along Dean’s hairline.
and Dean’s heart was too big beneath his ribs. He was feeling brave from all the liquor. Or stupid. Same thing, really. God, Dean wanted to kiss him, but he grabbed Cas’s hand instead, let the other one rest above his left hip.
), swearing under his breath when his elbow pops and grinds in its socket. His right hand is starting to act up, too. Over dinner, Cas will sometimes rub the ache out of his fingers with gentle ministrations. Dean’s noticed how long hours spent in the brutal sun have marked Cas’s arms, speckled his skin, and he’ll return the favor when he’s buzzing with the dull warmth of a couple of beers and the press of Cas’s body against his.
Cas is already staring at him. Dean swallows thickly. This isn’t how he imagined this day going, but shit happens, and he’s dealing. Dean knows how to do this. He knows how to take care of people, and he wants to take care of Cas—angel or human. Doesn’t matter. It had never mattered. Cas’s hand is the same size as Dean’s, only smoother from years of being healed from Cas’s grace. He doesn’t know how, or why Cas is human again. Or maybe, he’s only half human. Dean doesn’t think it’s his place to ask the details.
Dean snorts. He can’t argue with that.
He’s not doing this. It’s too soon. Saying that had almost been too much to bear—admitting that Cas is gone. Dead. Dead all over again, and this time it felt very fucking final. All those other times, Dean had grieved, grieved so hard and horrible he thought there could be no one else on this earth who had ever grieved like him. He hadn’t felt like this about anyone else, not even when Sam had been taken from him. Sam is different. Sam’s his blood. This feeling inside, it isn’t like anything else.
Cas is mute for two straight days. He doesn’t say anything except when they ask him a direct question. Dean knows that haunted look, the look that says
He hopes he can feel the love.
Jody, Donna, and the girls showed up after dinner toting presents and food supplies for Christmas breakfast, completing the Winchester family affair. After everyone settled in, they played a few board games, which resulted in Claire and Kaia trying (and failing) to teach Jack the rules of Monopoly and Dean accusing Cas of conspiring against him with Sam to bankrupt him. Bobby called to wish them a happy holiday, and to relay his regrets for not being able to make it. He promised he’d come down for New Year’s. Charlie rang, too. She was doing Christmas with Stevie. She sounded content. It put Dean at ease, knowing everyone was safe even if they weren’t sitting right in front of him.
“Maybe.”
Sam shakes his head, and holds up a hand.
“Okay, yeah. Jack should be back pretty soon. We can regroup tomorrow.”
“Me, too,” Dean agrees, picking at some dirt lodged underneath his broken nails.
, Dean begs himself.
“Dean? Dean! What the hell, man? I’ve called you twenty times!” Sam half-shouts, but he drops his gun to his side, visibly relieved. “I thought you were dead.”
Dean blinks. The handprint stays. Sam is still looking at him with those goddamn pitying eyes. He has nowhere to put this feeling in his chest. He’s too tired to be angry. Dean wants to be. That would be known territory. He wants to kick, and scream, and spit, but he doesn’t. Not really. Sam offers him a hand, and Dean takes it, letting himself be pulled to his feet.
“Breakfast first, though.”
He remembers when Cas first started this whole gardening hobby, how the guy had insisted on purchasing tomatoes even though he doesn’t remotely like them. Dean had joking called them “their” plants, and Cas, being the weirdo that he is, decided to put in writing as
“Let’s, uh,” Sam starts to say, but Dean is hardly listening, can’t take his eyes off of the near-perfect rusty handprint, like it’s some sort of hallucination, like if he blinks all of this will disappear.
Cas blinks at him. His face doesn’t betray whatever is happening in that ancient, stupid enigmatic brain of his. Just when Dean thinks he might pass out, Cas stands up from his chair, and Dean braces himself for impact. He’s made an ass out of himself, and this is what happens. Cas will reject him, and they’ll never talk about it again. This is the ending Dean had prepared himself for the most. He waits for Cas to walk away, but a gentle touch to his temple startles him back to the present moment. Cas is so close, bare feet toe to toe with Dean’s socked ones.
“I’m just glad you’re okay.”
“This does the job perfectly fine, Dean.
Dean swirls his third glass of whiskey, watches as it catches the light of the table lamp and paints his lap in amber. He doesn’t know what time it is. Sam looks exhausted, but he doesn’t go to bed, just keeps hovering around, exuding this nervous energy that is driving Dean nuts but he’s too defeated to bitch at him. Neither of them have said much of anything for the past twenty minutes, except to confirm that the entire world is wiped out aside from them and God. How fitting, that. The two of them (and Jack, too) against the world, but there’s no world left is there? Nothing to save, nothing to kill, nothing to fight. Nothing to love.
Dean carefully moves the jacket off the bed and onto his desk, and replaces it with himself. Sleep begins to wash over Dean, a request for a calm surrender to a different kind of darkness. He keeps his distance on the mattress, but makes sure he’s facing Cas so if anything happens, he’ll know. He’ll be there whenever Sleeping Beauty decides he’s had enough beauty sleep. He’ll be there no matter what.
In the beginning, a small part of Dean had resented her. He’d resented her for giving Sam something Dean couldn’t, for Sam leaving, for everything. It took months, but after seeing his brother happy—well and truly
“Told you,” Dean says, and chances a glance at Cas’s face.
Of course, I forgive you.
Dean finds Cas in the kitchen. The sink is running. Cas is cleaning the dishes, the muscles of his arms working as he scrubs at a plate, and he doesn’t look up like he usually does when Dean enters a room. He watches Cas pick up a knife in his right hand, and there must be too much soap because it slips out of his grip. Cas cries out as the blade slices through skin, skin that shouldn’t be bleeding that much.
He can feel the heat of his brother against his side, and then the searing weight of a hand at his pulse point for a brief moment. Dean hears Sam take a sharp breath, and when he opens his eyes, his brother is staring at Dean’s left shoulder, lips pressed together in a tight line. He doesn’t want to look, but Dean does anyway. It doesn’t process at first, except for the fact that there’s blood, and he knows it isn’t his. When he pulls the fabric taught, the red takes shape, and he thinks for a moment that he is going to throw up, like maybe he was concussed from slamming into the wall.
Castiel knows that there was never really a question. He has always and will always make the same choice.
The air feels like it’s been sucked from the room. His lungs can’t fill up enough, and he feels a little dizzy. Cas just keeps staring him down with those piercing eyes of his, and Dean sucks in another two quick breaths.
Dean can see the film of tears in Sam’s eyes, the way he’s swallowing around the same lump in his throat that’s in Dean’s. Eileen is gone, too, now. Sam doesn’t have to say it. He knows Sam loved her, the real kind of love. The kind of love you wait your whole life for.
They lapse into another silence. Dean wants to reach for the bottle again, but it’s just out of habit. He’s warm from what he’s already had, but nothing’s changed. If anything, he feels less in control, like the whiskey is washing away whatever glue was keeping himself together.
Sam doesn’t say another word.
“Wonderful.”
“You know, I didn’t think you’d stay here. With me.”
Screw being. Screw destiny, and screw death. They deserve the having. They made it up as they went, and things may have been rough. Hell, things have been beyond rough, and they’ve all done fucked up shit that can never be truly forgiven or forgotten—but they’re here. They’re real.
Cas just squints up at him from his place in the dirt with a bored expression, dark hair plastered against his forehead underneath his ridiculous straw hat. His hair starts to curl when it grows out, and right now, it’s a bird’s nest. Dean’ll give him a haircut tonight if he can find Dad’s old pair of scissors.
This is the norm now. This is it.
“The tomatoes look like they bounced back,” Dean comments as Cas stands up, tipping the watering can with both hands over a cluster of basil and rosemary.
Dean’s room feels suffocating tonight. He drops the bottle on the nightstand, untouched, and sags into the mattress. He doesn’t bother with his jeans, or his boots, just curls in on himself on top of the sheets. There’s that silence again. It wraps around him, filling the room and his ears like water, makes him want to smack the side of his head to get it out. He stares at the wall, and thinks about the black void, how it bubbled and roiled like floating tar. How it had just congealed into existence. He wishes for a fleeting moment it would take him, too. Wants it to ooze out of the spot on the wall he’s burning a hole into with his mind and smother him, send him spiraling into whatever void Cas is in right now.
“Merry Christmas, asshole,” Dean said instead, laughing when Cas pushed at his chest without any real force, and then they were dancing again between kisses and jokes.
“Let me see it,” Dean says softly.
Cas has an old, rusted watering can that weighs a ton and leaks in some places if he fills it up past a certain point. He’d found it one day when they were packing up the bunker, and hasn’t parted with it since then. There are these little hand-painted honeybees that decorate the mottled surface, and every once in awhile, Cas brings it inside to patiently repaint each insect with that meticulous, laser focus of his. Cas ignores Dean every time he tries suggesting they take a quick trip up to Home Depot and get him a brand new one, one that doesn’t waste water and make Dean’s elbow creak when he lifts it.
“I knew they would.”
. He sits, useless, and watches Sam pick up the bigger pieces in his busted up hands and thinks,
Before the drinking started, Dean cooked up quite the Christmas Eve dinner. Eileen was staying with them for the past couple days leading up to Christmas proper, and it turned out she wasn’t half bad at baking, so Dean granted her permission to help with pie crusts which was understood to be a sacred honor. Sam, Cas and Jack took up the roles of decorators while Dean and Eileen were in the kitchen, and Dean tried not to laugh when he found Jack covered in more tinsel than the tree.
played softly on the TV. Dean watched him sleep for a bit, made sure the sheets rose and fell in the right rhythm. Cas had disappeared a few minutes ago mumbling about wanting to listen to music or something like that. Dean was only half paying attention. He had been too busy memorizing the way Cas’s flushed cheeks brought out his eyes, how his laugh came easy and loud after two drinks. The way his leg was pressed up against Dean’s at the dinner table the whole time.
Dean felt heavy, and warm, but he wasn’t ready to go to bed. Jack was curled up on the sofa next to him under a mound of blankets, fast asleep, as
“I just... Sam, I couldn’t...”
I love—
skin.
He’s careful, takes his time with each pass of the needle through pale skin. Dean’s a little rusty, but Cas takes it like a champ, doesn’t bitch when Dean pulls too much or too hard. He just sits there and lets Dean fix him up without a word. When Dean’s done, he holds Cas’s hand for a moment, and hopes Cas understands him, what he means.
“I told you,” Cas said, swaying on his feet as he plopped the record player on the coffee table with an air of triumph, “I wanted music.”
“This is real, Cas,” Dean says, and he means more than just that Cas is standing here in the bunker’s kitchen in front of Dean and not some cold, dark emptiness.
He wants to laugh. He wants to cry.
. Dean thinks about how he’ll give Cas the bigger portion of the leftover Chinese, or how he’ll lend Cas another pair of gloves to fend off the chill of morning dew and blustery weather. He tries to remind himself how much things have changed. Dean doesn’t know when the universe shifted, doesn't know when the planets aligned just so and he agreed to buy a house, or when he complied with doing the dishes every other day and grilling burgers when the weather is bearable.
The skin doesn’t knit itself back together. The implications of that hit Dean full force.
Nothing comes popping out of the dark to kill him.
Dean closes his eyes again and lets his head fall back against the wall. The fluorescent lights pierce straight through his eyelids, stoking the flames of a soon-to-be migraine. He doesn’t even know what to say.
“I’m gonna hit the sack,” Dean says, and stands, swaying a little on his feet.
“Do you think they’ll get married?”
They made it. They made it home together.
It freaks him out a little that there’s no echo. He feels like he’s in one of those sound-proofed rooms, or like when the first snowfall happens and there’s a different brand of silence at sunrise. Dean keeps moving forward. It’s indescribable, the way the Empty moves to accommodate him in its space. It’s not quite like liquid. It’s like curtains that flow past him, but there’s no way to tell where they end or begin.
“Hand it over,” Cas says, motioning with a gloved hand, and Dean gladly forfeits the piece of junk. He swears he can hear his entire arm sigh in relief.
“Thank you,” Dean says, quietly.
That’s not what I meant
“You can have it, Cas. If you’ll, uh, still have me, that is.”
Cas just hums.
Just as Dean thinks he’s going to go insane, searing light bursts into his view, and he throws up his arm to shield himself, crying out against the assault on his senses. A hand comes down on his shoulder to steady him, and he reels back, tries to run away but Cas’s limp body anchors him to the ground.
“He’s breathing. He’s alive,” Dean says, and it almost comes out as a sob.
“I like this place,” Cas says after they lapse into another silence.
“This is gonna hurt like a bitch,” Dean says right as he starts to dab at the cut with an alcohol-soaked wipe.
the angel, something older than the earth itself, and he is sinking beneath the waves of a nameless ocean, far from the reaches of humanity, with the fading memory of what the stars had felt like beneath his fingertips.
“I thought for a moment, you know, when you didn’t pick up that you were gone, too,” Sam says, eyes not quite meeting Dean’s, and somehow there’s still enough of Dean’s heart left to break.
“What’d you say we bust out of this joint? Not really my vibe,” Dean jokes, stroking at the collar of Cas’s shirt where he’d checked his pulse.
, Frank promised them, and Dean felt for the first time in his life that that might be true.
A new chill seeps through the denim of his jeans, roots itself in his core. He inhales a shaky breath and feels the chill wrap around his lungs and squeeze. Dean knows objectively that he is about to have a panic attack because his hands are now shaking, and his vision is blurry not just from the unshed tears, and he can’t breathe. He can’t breathe. He sucks in another gulp of air and tries to focus on something.
(That was a good day. Two days prior, Sam and Eileen went to the mall in the city to do some last minute present and food shopping, which left Dean, Cas and Jack to go chop a tree down at a tree farm not that far from the bunker. Dean let Jack pick the tree, and Dean and Cas chopped it down. Dean tried to ignore the way his joints creaked from the effort. Jack was so happy, it didn't really matter how much Dean ached for the rest of the day. Cas rubbed the knots out of his shoulder later after they’d got back to the bunker, anyway, so it was a win for everyone in the end.)
Presently, everyone had either gone to bed or passed out from a food coma and/or Sam’s killer eggnog. Speaking of, Sam and Eileen had stumbled their way to bed about an hour ago with their arms wrapped around each other as they went. Sam was wearing this big, goofy Santa hat that jingled the whole way down the hall until Dean heard the door slam shut. It was a good look on Sam, the head-over-heels look, Dean mused. Claire and Kaia were sweet, too, even if they did gang up on him and call him an old man. Jody, Donna and the girls had also long since made their way to the guest rooms Dean had made up for them. Claire and Kaia had been the last ones to go, and Dean knew Claire had had a few too many herself after she gave him a one-armed hug and a kiss on the cheek before letting Kaia drag her away.
Dean bunches Cas’s t-shirt in his fist, and pulls Cas forward so he’s between Dean’s knees, so he can lean his head against Cas’s torso. Cas smells faintly metallic and like a cheap fabric softener Sam bought ages ago. Cas stays stock still for a few tense seconds, and then both his hands are there cradling Dean’s head.
“You look happy,” Cas said after another rotation.
. Not half-angel, not anything except… Human.
He prays. Dean prays so damn hard, he thinks he’s gonna burst a blood vessel and then some. He prays to Jack to hear him, to open the portal back up. He hopes to fuck this works. It’s the only shot he’s got. The only shot
Dean startles awake again, but this time he’s using an ancient book of sigils as a pillow. Sam’s towering over him like some menacing statue, coffee mug in one hand, and phone in the other. He looks like he got as much sleep as Dean got. His eyes are rimmed in red, and the skin beneath them is bruised.
“Time for bed,” Cas said in an exaggerated tone, like he was attempting to manage some semblance of sobriety. “We apologize for waking you.”
Living with Castiel means accepting all these annoying quirks. It means waking up at ass o’clock in the morning to freezing toes and loud snoring because Cas has terrible allergies and refuses to take anything for them. It means having to put up with sharing a bathroom with a man who wastes all the hot water on hour-long showers, and a man who still doesn’t know how to tie a tie right. When the two of them return from a particularly nasty hunt, and Dean finds out that Cas forgot to turn off the AC before they left for the
“Shh,” Cas shushed as he snorted out another laugh.
He presses his fists so hard against his closed eyes, colors burst and spark to life in the darkness.
“You good?”
Cas is in the kitchen, elbow-deep in soapy water and dirty dishes, when Dean stomps through the door, exhausted and drenched in sweat. Dean joins him at the sink and starts drying in comfortable silence. They bump shoulders every once in a while, and Dean can see the smile playing at Cas’s lips, which only makes him laugh and shake his head.
“Ok, you should try and swing by though. It’s going to be fun," Rachel said. It wasn’t. It was going to be the same people talking about the same thing, just like always. “And Castiel? Hester said that she hopes you change your mind,"
“Why are you here?” Dean snapped. It felt wrong for Tessa to be on the Novak-Reeves property, she didn’t belong here and her presence just reminded Dean that maybe he didn’t belong either.
“Wait,
“Pissing myself over you wearing a dress might be needed.” Dean quipped but the smile he gave Jo felt very forced. He hurried out of the ER and headed towards the elevators.
It was then that Michael leaned over and said something low into Bela's ear. Cas, Anna and Inais watched with surprise as Bela smiled back and actually blushed.
Dean smiled back at his mother and motioned for Cas to help him move the barre into the middle of the room. Cas smiled back, half of him just happy that Dean could make his mother smile and the other half ecstatic to be dancing alongside a woman he’d admired from a young age. The three of them got into positions and Mary gently worked them through a barre warm-up. In a soft voice, she called out various moves, from piles to grande battements. Cas marvelled at both of the Winchesters and their perfect lines.
With Cas pulling him in closer, Dean soon found himself straddling Cas’ hips. The kisses they exchanged grew more and more heated, with Cas’ hands soon finding their way to the hem of Dean’s t-shirt. Without giving it a second thought, Dean pulled his shirt over his head, throwing it onto the floor and Cas’ soon followed.
“Yeah, Anna and I are here most days. Anna and Jo are good friends and Anna has been in love with the guy who works here for months though she won’t do anything about it.” Castiel explained. “This place used to be this pretty cool diner type bar place until a few years back then Ellen turned it into a coffeehouse that sells the best burgers in Minnesota. This place is kind of mine and Anna’s favourite place if I’m being honest.”
“I still can’t understand what you're saying, dude.” He said with a grin. Cas groaned and rubbed his eyes before looking up at Dean.
“Oh really? Do you think that a few days of people saying stuff is really that hard Dean? Try having people saying awful things about you since were thirteen years old. Try having half your family not really understand who you are because of the gender you love.” Cas snapped. “I hardly speak to my family and it’s not because I’m always busy.”
“No not really, carry on with your lesson.” Castiel said smiling slightly. He heard a few people snicker from behind their hands while Anna shook her head slightly. His best friend didn’t mind Castiel toeing the line occasionally but when his smart mouth tended to annoy her slightly when it landed Castiel in detention.
“So you’re saying these can perform miracles?” Cas said, smirking slightly as he handed over a mug of coffee.
“I guess I have a passion for cardio…if you want me on your service that is.”
Meg had been his closest friend at the school since she had started. She’d blown into the school like a tornado and totally turned Cas’ world upside down. Cas didn’t even want to know the person he would’ve become if he hadn't met her when he did. Sure, she was a troublemaker and had a colourful past but Cas had never cared about that.
“No. Castiel, get out the damn closet and see your ex-husband like a big boy.” Gabriel said because of course Gabriel knew exactly what Cas was thinking. It was at that point that Claire strolled into the room holding a sandwich, stopping when she saw Cas stood in his closet holding out two nearly identical sweaters.
“Yeah…yeah it is.” Castiel said with a loud, tired sounding sigh. As Dean went to light another cigarette Castiel held out a hand. Dean furrowed his brow with surprise. “Mind if I have one?”
“Why? Because you know you could easily be killed by doing this?”
. Mary Winchester's son is here." She added leaning in close for dramatic effect. “Not just for a visit either, he’s actually joining the senior class to dance.”
“You heard it? How?” Dean pressed with a furrowed brow.
“Just eat breakfast dad.” She said while Jack handed a plate over to Cas. The twins sat down, their own plates stacked high with waffles, and exchanged smug looks.
kiss me back and don't try to deny it." Dean snapped. Castiel opened his mouth to say that he didn’t kiss Dean back but the words wouldn’t come out. That seemed to be one lie he couldn’t tell. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before speaking.
“We won’t have long because we have to set up for the first group date. We can’t go too far.” Dean said.
“Meat Feast with extra spicy sausage and four kinds of cheese?” Jo asked excitedly. Dean guessed that everything between them was ok now. Pizza was pretty magical in that sense. “Pizza sounds good to me…thanks Dean.”
“Cas!” Dean snapped.
“And you have Charlie” Dean pointed out. “And…and you have me.” He added after several moments of silence and in a quieter voice that sent a pang of something Castiel wasn’t sure of into his stomach.
“Dean-“
“Mom, this is Anna Milton. She’s Cas’ younger sister and a student at the academy as well.” Dean said with a knowing look to Cas. He was taking all this in his stride.
Despite his better judgment, Dean actually went to English class on Monday. Everything inside of him said it was a bad idea, namely because there was a very good chance that Cas would yell at him, or worse ignore him. Still, Vic had made it very clear that Dean needed to be in the class to get a grade for his sonnet assignment. Not that he'd actually done it. Dean slunk into the room just before class started, taking his normal seat nearest to the door. He spotted Cas right away and wasn't at all surprised when the other guy blatantly ignored him.
“Why, because this making you nervous?” Cas asked, still smirking. Dean gently punched Cas on the arm.
Jess promptly stomped on his foot. Castiel winced while Dean just stood there and smirked.
“Yeah I should be fast; I’m the state champion.” Castiel said with a shrug knowing full well that it sounded like he was bragging.
“Luckily I have the whole thing on my phone thanks to my mom.”
“They’re completely harmless.” Charlie had said later on that day when they sat in the cafeteria with Jo, Sarah and Adam.
. If this was eight months down the line I would stay and never leave but when I’m like this I can’t stay.”
“Hey, you were awesome today man. It’s good to have you here," Adam said glancing over at Jo. She was pointedly not looking at him. “Um…hi Jo," Adam said warily. Jo narrowed her eyes and remained silent. “Have a good summer?” Adam pressed. Now Jo cocked an eyebrow while folding her slender arms across her chest. The tension in the air could have been hacked at with a butcher’s knife.
“Hey!” Claire and Jack yelled for the second time.
“Shut up loser.” Dean smiled.
The man who stood before him now was different. Harder, like his life had been broken over and over again.
Dean noted the lights in the kitchen were on and curiosity got the better of him. Gently pushing the door open Dean glanced into the kitchen and was surprised to see Castiel sat at the breakfast bar, a sandwich and cup of tea sat in front of him. Castiel looked up as Dean slowly walked into the room.
“Oh?”
“Dean, I took the job at John Hopkins. I accepted their offer and I'm handing in my notice at the hospital by the end of the week." Fuck…Dean
"From the moment I met you I thought you were the most beautiful person I'd ever met. As mad as I was being thrown into this insane situation, I couldn't stop myself from thinking about you." Cas said, his low voice ringing with such sincerity. He closed the space between them with a deep kiss, hands moving now to the belt on Dean's jeans.
“You should know that I worked every single summer since I was twelve to save up for my tuition. I worked nearly every night at a crappy bar when I was in college and both my parents saved up all the money they had so I could go to Yale so it’s not like I’m a freaking princess.” Dean said cocking his eyebrows because he had the feeling that Jo was going to call him a princess for the rest of the year. He could barely handle a day of Novak calling him ‘Budweiser’, he couldn’t handle Jo calling him ‘princess’ as well.
“Well was it good bread?” Dean asked. Honestly, he felt like this was a good question.
"That's what you think," Cas said as he buttoned up the shirt over his t-shirt. "Come on, there are rounds that need to be done and I have to talk to the chief sometime today about my research budget," Cas added. Dean handed him his jacket and a travel mug of coffee. Before Cas would have thanked him with a smile but now he leant over and closed the space between them with a kiss. Yeah, that was something Dean could get used to.
“So…that was your mother?”
. We lost touch when I went to dance in Boston then I moved to Russia. It’ll be pretty awesome to see her again,"
“I shouldn’t piss him off? The same thing should be said about me Danyael! You angels think that you can just take my little play thing and expect me to not become perturb?” Zachariah snapped angrily. “I thought you overgrown pigeons were smarter than that but clearly you’re not. I’m going to ask nicely and if you refuse to cooperate then things will get messy and I mean that quite empirically. Hand Castiel back over to me, I will even say please if I must.”
"Of course I do Claire!"
for days without telling
Cas actually adored this side of Dean, the human side that wasn’t hidden by a smirking mask and otherworldly talent.
“What’s up with you?” Dean asked, glancing over to a very pale looking Sammy in the passenger seat. “You look…”
“I'm fucking starving and I'm hoping to see someone cry, preferably Hester or Rachel," Jo said with a shrug of her shoulders.
“You look awfully young to be an officer.” Was the man’s response. Dean’s pulse quickened at the man’s scrutiny. Normally people accepted his aliases without question Dean could see that this man saw through it almost instantly.
Dean found it far too much fun riling Cas up sometimes. Dean picked up his own mug and took a sip of wine. He really didn’t care if Cas thought any less of him, the red could have done with something that made it taste less…well less like wine if he was being perfectly honest.
“I did.” He flips a piece of paper and reads it. Dean stomps over and gathers the pages up into his hand.
“Listen, there’s a difference between watching Britney Spears dancing in some skintight spandex on MTV and saying she’s your personal life coach, okay?” Cas just keeps staring at him. Sometimes Dean tells him about stuff that he should and should not like, and Cas can never really understand why, despite asking questions to parse out the answer. The same thing happened last week when he and Dean were trawling through a thrift shop together and he spotted a turtleneck that looked to be his size.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas cracks it open but doesn’t take a sip yet. “How was it?” Dean takes off the jacket he wore, his over shirt.
“Why are you doing this?” Sam says, harsh. “You could’ve had a cushy position in hell if you wanted.”
“Of course.”
The wannabe kick boxing instructor isn’t killing the locals - one of her students is. Dean gets her with a silver bullet while Cas protects the instructor before she can become missing person number four. They burn the body and get out of town. Dean glances at the little postage stamp sized houses on either side of the road, the flower beds and freshly painted fences.
"I'd rather not."
(See the end of the chapter for
“She probably thought she had a good reason. Wouldn’t you go to extreme lengths for your family?”
“She didn’t want to upset you?”
“Shut up!”
They don’t talk about John, or the Gillespie family, or Cas’s lack of memories. Cas catches Dean staring at his phone, thumb pressing buttons to go through menu options. Once or twice he heads to the bathroom and Cas can vaguely hear him talking to someone through the door, and whenever they finish a case, he has a new one ready as if pulled from thin air.
Also a rare male crossroads demon?? What could it mean?? Something something subtext lmao
Cas makes a noise and sits up, stretches. Dean watches his silhouette as he goes into the bathroom, turns the shower on. He leaves the door open, not so much an invitation but just a sign that Dean can be there, if he wants, in the same room that’s slowly growing humid.
"With him?" Sam guesses.
Anyway, I'm not expert in tarot myself but I did try to write this scene in a way that was accurate, easy to understand if you're unfamiliar with tarot, while still having the all important Narrative Foreshadowing. Also shoutout to @memfys23 for looking over the original spread with me and making sure it looked good.
"What, like a bad soap opera twist?"
"But she's safe," Sam says, flat.
(See the end of the chapter for
"How?" she asks. "How the fuck is this going to work out?"
“I must be going,” it tells Cas. “There are more seals, and we can’t hold them forever.” With another furtive glance at Dean, the angel flies off.
“Why not just kill her?” Dean asks. “No Grace, no real way to fight back. You must have all the same info she has. What do the angels want with her?”
not. She just found someone to make it happen.” He frowns. “Dean, what do you know about demonology?”
She sighs, walks to her desk and sits on the edge of it. Her mouth is twisted like she’s reevaluating what she’s seeing. "...You know it's… alright, don't you? Like, you don’t have to lie to me."
I really like the idea of Cas and his relationship with food throughout hfym. I held back on posting this bc I'm tempted to do a more fleshed out fic, but idk if I'll have time now that I'm trying to write more for the main story so take this <3
"What if - this - we just can't? If I can't?"
"Goodnight. I'll watch over you."
“What about her?”
Cas to try and paralyze him, is the thing. It looks like an attractive guy their age, dark hair, muscular, and it presses up against Cas and -
“I didn’t say anything,” Cas says, taking a sip of coffee - iced. It’s ninety-seven out and even Dean looks like he’s regretting his choice of ordering his hot.
“No it’s not. Not with her, I mean. Not exactly. But with…” He looks over his shoulder at the two girls still at the bar, drinking something red and sweet. They’re his type. He doesn’t know if Cas has a type. But maybe… “I mean, do you ever think about. Just.” Words dry up in his throat.
He’s the good looking one - that’s what people told him, growing up - still do. Delicate features, too pretty to be a hunter, less of a dirt-smeared, devilish rogue and more like someone who ends up on his back. But this is Cas, he reminds himself. Cas is the one who likes collecting soft sweaters and drinking fancy, caffeinated drinks with made up names. He's the one that reads Cormac McCarthy novels back to back with Nora Roberts. He kills the monsters and heals Dean, endless power neither of them understand flowing from the same hands; wide palms, long fingers, cupping Dean’s jaw.
"Yeah, uh. We can - I just - give me a sec, okay?" Cas takes his hands away and Dean tries not to be so obvious about the deep breaths he's forcing into his lungs. They're in their motel room. He knows their toothbrushes are stuck in the complimentary plastic cups by the sink. A pair of Cas's jeans are still in his duffel from the last time they went to the laundromat. Cas is wearing a pair of socks Dean let him borrow. They're stretched out, close but not even touching. It should be fine.
**The French movie 'without any samurai in it' was Le Samouraï, a 1967 neo-noir crime French film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, who was an inspiration to the later French new wave.
“I wish I knew.” Dean didn’t sleep enough. He feels a headache pounding behind his eyes. He’s so tired. “Do you think we should call your dad? Maybe he can help.”
“I had an extra set laying around,” Dean says, looking away. Cas leans forward, hooks his chin over Dean's shoulder, puts arms around Dean's middle.
she tells him.
heard,
"So..."
“Denise, come on, it's Mike Eles?" He flips through a copy of the class of 2003 yearbook to get to the group shots. "You know, from Key Club? I just want to make sure Heather really is alright. Just like you."
Castiel has enough angel mojo in him to fight, to heal the two of them, and to listen in on angel radio so they know where to go for the next job. Dean drives, figures out the human stuff they're willing to opt-in on, and does the boring day-to-day shit to keep them going.
A cop passes by around five in the morning and tells them to get going. Dean finds a Dunkin Donuts that's open early enough and uses the bathroom to brush his teeth. Usually a night spent sleeping in his car means cramped legs, a crick in his neck, and dealing with whatever setback made him sleep in the car in the first place. Staring at his reflection, he feels surprisingly okay.
*Warnings for some rather gruesome deaths, mention of domestic abuse, mention of suicide, and a minor character completing suicide.
Cas manages to kneel, brush bits of ceiling and sawdust from his hair. “You destroyed them,” he says, almost regretful.
"I know!" Pamela giggles again. "It's just - wow." She devolves into laughs and Cas can't help but join in until they're laughing over something, something... well. It doesn't matter. He finally comes down with a sigh. Pamela wipes at her eyes, blowing out breath.
In the motel room he crushes the wild aloe with his thumb and forefinger until the insides come bursting out of the middle. He takes a knife and slices it open, scrapes the rest out, and rubs it down the pink of Cas’s back until it glistens, sticky and with promised healing. Dean’s hands are still wet when Cas turns around and looks at him, forever chapped lips curling in a smile that’s too gentle to be aimed at Dean, but Cas only gives it to him, anyway.
leaving. What he and his dad actually do for work, because that’s the truth, and he wants her to know.
“I’m fine,” he says, swaying. Cas’s hand closes on his arm. He shakes it off, over corrects, and nearly falls over. Cas drags him to the car and presses him between his body and the cool metal of the Impala. “I’m fine, Cas, I -”
“Dude, you reek,” Dean says, shutting the door and starting the car.
He makes a face. “It doesn’t taste as good as you make it look,” he says, after swallowing.
“What Ruby and I have is different,” Sam starts. “Whatever you and Dean -”
hell screwed us both over before we were born. Both sides had their sights on our family. Yellow Eyes wasn’t even the start of it all. We’re just some chess pieces to them." He sighs, rolls his shoulders. "So you want to know why I’m doing this? Same reason you are.”
“I don’t think I actually require -” Cas starts, as Dean shucks his clothes for him and tosses them into the laundromat’s washer.
So if you came here from tiktok you know I had a joke about Cas listening to Quirky Weird Girl music produced in the 90s-2000s. Aka Fiona Apple, which is how she was always described to me growing up. Anyway I made a Spotify playlist for this fic, as you do, and realized I probably ought to listen to some Fiona Apple. Now I really really like Fiona Apple. I honestly don't know what I expected. And you can listen to the playlist here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4VaaFaHZ9mWHJ8PhEQKUbz?si=o0OAAn8URfG1HtpU2uBH0Q
He’s shoving the tools back into the trunk, organizing the equipment just how he likes when he hears Castiel say it, more to the trees than him. “I probably wouldn’t have the Grace for it, anyway.”
But when Dean shows John the box, his dad’s eyes go dark. “This is bad,” he says. “Where did you find this?”
The sky is blue and cloudless when they leave the library after another fruitless search through the archives. “I’m gonna head back to the field, just in case we missed something,” Dean says with a sigh. Their last search was fruitless. They’ve been kicking around for almost a week without finding out anything about the case. “You coming?”
“So, uh, how does breakfast sound?”
got. He prays and prays and prays.
Dean leaned forward. He accidentally caught Cas’s cheek instead, lips pressing into stubbled skin, but Cas pulled back. Before Dean could apologize or say something dumb, Cas kissed him for real. It was chaste, and both of their lips were chapped, but it made Dean weak at the knees, made him pull Cas all the way against him for support. They stopped swaying, and Sinatra phased into Crosby’s
say, so he continues marking the freckles on Cas’s hand, basking in the simplicity of human touch till the fireflies come out and the sky turns navy blue.
“She’s good for him, I think,” Dean agrees, and reaches down a step and picks up a forgotten bottlecap, turning the warm metal over in his palm just so, and watches the light refract off of it.
Cas’s voice is tentative. Dean flips his hand so their fingers can lace together. He rubs his thumb over Cas's tanned knuckles, traces the sunspots sprouting across his once unblemished skin. Dean doesn’t say anything to that. He doesn’t know what
. There’s a split second before he drifts to sleep that he looks at Dean, and Dean looks at him, and he can see that soul again. It’s a weak flicker of light, blinding and wonderful and painful, but he still, impossibly, perceives it. Dean is shouting something, but he cannot hear anymore.
If he thinks about it some more, Dean thinks he might be a little bit in love.
“I’m glad this is where we ended up.”
Dean takes another step, and his foot collides with something solid.
He was a little dizzy, still a little unsure of his footing, but Dean powered through it. He turned them in a slow, steady circle, and Cas finally stopped looking at their feet to look at Dean’s face instead.
Cas deflates. He holds out his hand, and Dean inspects the wound. It’s a clean slice right between his thumb and forefinger. Nothing some rubbing alcohol and stitches won’t fix. Maybe some whiskey, too, for good measure. They’re both gonna need it.
“I’m going to summon the Empty,” Dean says over the rim of the mug, steam warming up his cheeks, like he just gave Sam the time, “and Jack’s going to help me do it.”
Dean lifts a shaking hand to hover just over Cas’s mouth, close enough that he can feel his skin is freezing to the touch. He almost dry heaves again, but then, a puff of warmth. A couple seconds later, and there’s another.
“You doin’ that on purpose?”
There’s a shift. Dean can feel it. He wraps an arm around Cas’s chest, and shoves another up under his back so he can bring him into his lap. Cas’s head falls slack against Dean’s shoulder. He holds him tight, and braces himself. The Empty doesn’t give up without a fight. It rages around them, and Dean thinks for a terrible second that he can see Alistair smiling at him in the distance. He blinks, and it’s a child he once had on the Rack. Another blink, and now it’s Ruby giving him a wave, then Michael, and so on. Another Cas, blood pouring down his face, covered head to toe in red. Every nightmare, everything he’s ever feared.
Dean was a little bit drunk.
They have leftover pork sandwiches and cold beer for dinner on the porch steps, and Dean makes idle comments on all the small things he needs to fix. There’s a loose board near the front door under the doormat, and the paint’s starting to peel off on the railing, also the whole area could use a good sweeping. Cas, of course, promises he’ll assist him with whatever needs to be done.
Sam and Jack are gone again on another run. They think they’re on to something, but Dean had only been half-listening as Sam had explained their idea to trap Chuck in the Empty and throw away the key. He knows he should be more invested. Dean is. He cares. He wants to make things right, but first, he has to figure out his own shit.
Dean retrieves one of the many emergency kits he keeps around the bunker from under the sink, and drags a chair next to where Cas is at the kitchen table.
“Cas,” Dean chokes out.
Dean sighs, and scrubs a hand across his face. There’s nothing to say. Nothing he can say will make anything right.
"Hello?" A sleep heavy voice said.
Jo rolled her eyes heavily while Dean gave Charlie a well deserved high five.
“Oh Dean, honey! It’s so good to hear from you. How’s everything going with the wedding? Have you told Jimmy and Amelia that we’re sorry that we can’t make it? We’d love to be there but your father really isn’t feeling up to traveling at the moment which is such a shame.” Mary rambled. “We’ve sent them their wedding present and a card though, have you told them that they’re in the mail?” She added.
“Sam, I was seeing my ex-husband for the first time in two years. You’re just talking to a girl you’ve got a crush on. It’s a whole different story.” Dean said. Sam snorted loudly. “I’ve got a point and you know it, little brother.” Dean added. He saw that Sam was about to say something else but stopped when he noticed Cas, Anna and Jess walking towards them. Jess gave Sam a welcoming smile.
“Fine.” Sam said narrowing his eyes slightly at Dean.
The tone alone would have set Dean over the edge but Cas’ irritated expression really took the fucking biscuit.
“Fuck…Adam is going to be a mess, remember what he said this morning about a trauma in the ER?” Jo said. “He’s going to think that he’s cursed or some shit like that.” She added running her hand through her hair with fatigue. “Is it alright if he comes back to the apartment tonight? He’s going to need a drink or something.” Jo asked turning to Dean. Dean nodded, Adam wasn’t the only one who needed a large drink after this. “Thanks…I…I better go and talk to Andy’s girlfriend. Lafitte will come and talk to her too right?”
"I need some air." He said, rising from his seat and quickly going outside. Josie instantly motioned for Dean to follow him. Ah, the life of a producer. Dean hurried after him and found Cas frantically smoking outside.
“You aren't gonna lose me Cas, I love you too much,” Dean muttered sleepily. Cas kissed the tip of Dean’s nose and whispered something but by that point Dean was too tired and drifted off to sleep.
“Was it that skeevy looking nurse on the first floor that was at the party?” Jo asked examining the mark.
“Dean-”
Dean gave her a weak smile as they said their final goodbyes and it wasn’t until his parents left that Dean realised he’d been holding so much in.
“You’ll love it, I picked it.” Arthur intoned.
It seemed as though Garrison was like every other high school in the country. Well defined cliques that fell into the typical high school stereotypes. The theatre kids, the painfully hip art kids, the nerds. Jocks loudly bantering with each other, cheerleaders hanging on their every word.
“No, I’ve heard nothing from him in years.” Dean said still wincing as Castiel’s prayers whittled down to next to nothing. “There’s gotta be a plan though. We can’t just let the man rot down there.”
"We're not joking here Cas." Charlie said. "We
Cas chewed the inside of his cheek at Bela’s words. “The girls are ready, are you ready?” he asked Dean. Dean gave him another mocking face before shrugging. “Is that your ‘I’m very excited for tonight Cas’ face?” Cas asked with a smirk. Dean flipped him off as Cas fired back a text to Bela.
“They wouldn't...the interns wouldn't be asses to you. I told Jo to be on her best behaviour.”
“Yeah…I mean you’re an asshole with piss poor people skills but, like you said all those months ago, you and I would have fun together this year. I think the next year in Maryland could even more fun.” Dean said remembering back to that first shift at the hospital.
Instead, Dean just nodded and said “Thanks for staying.”
“I would
“I may have forgotten my wallet and I know for a fact that you left yours on our bed. So… run!” Cas said quickly leaping from his seat and sprinting towards the door.
"I've just been having a very interesting conversation with Novak here and I would very much like your side of the story." Dean looked over at Cas with about ten questions in one look. Cas' reply was an apologetic wide-eyed stare. Fuck…
“Oh, I just wanted to go over the day and what was going to happen.” Cas said. He watched with a bemused expression as Dean nearly drained the whole mug. It was then that Dean noticed the large power shower in Cas’ en-suite, Without giving it a second thought, he put his mug down and unbuttoned his shirt.
“Awesome.” Dean said acerbically looking down at the glass in his hand. “What did the winged dictator have to say for himself? Was it a rousing sermon in order to rally the troops?” The acid tone of his voice cut through the room and judging by Sam’s disgruntled frown he did not appreciate it.
"My mom and I are on a hunt and we need your help,
"Not at all, I was merely having Dean help me go over some past patient files. It helps in preparation for the intern exam." Cas lied smoothly. Well, it wasn't so much as a lie, they had looked over charts until Dean has decided that kissing a bruise into Cas' collarbone had been more fun.
"Wow…you look like you needed that." Anna remarked once they were in the car and she had backed out of the drive. Castiel took yet another gulp in a way of agreeing with her. "How many hours sleep did you get?" Anna asked sounding concerned.
“It would help if you were going to…” Castiel started to say before his brow furrowed again. “You’ve got accepted somewhere haven’t you?” he asked when he got a full look at Dean’s expression. Clearly he wasn’t the only one who’d been hiding something college related.
“Dean, I think we both know that your job is far more interesting than mine. I talk about budgets all day while you-”
“Cas?”
mad at you and I think you're an idiot! You love Pops, I know it and you know it. Heck, Jack, Uncle Gabriel, Uncle Sam and Aunt Eileen know it! Even Pops himself knows it! You love him and he loves you! YOu've always loved him otherwise you wouldn't get drunk and cry watching cowboy films." Claire yelled, her eyes filling with tears again. "I just want my family to be together and instead we're driving away from them! I
“That’s a shame, it seemed like the two of you got along really well.” Amelia remarked. She handed Castiel a large glass of red wine with a small smile on her lips. “You’ll be glad when he’s back though.”
“I wasn’t passed out. I was napping, I had a full day of lectures,” Jessica said by way of defence not even denying that she was indeed Sam’s girlfriend now. “Seriously Dean, you’ve
. We met at a bookstore," Charlie said with a whimsical smile. “We bonded over our love for fantasy novels, Dungeons and Dragons and green tea,"
“I just cannot understand why you’re acting like such a dick especially when I thought that we were friends but clearly you’re just some asshole who-”
“You're forgetting I saw you passed out on my couch, you don't scare me anymore.”
Inside the control room. Josie was stood with the remains of her latte. Her steely eyes fixed on the monitors. Interns scurried around while the other producers were sat in their chairs, notepads in front of them and eager looks on their faces.
"It's already been opened." Castiel pointed out.
. Castiel’s been living under a rock and has never seen any of the Star Trek films so we’re amending that right now." Charlie said.
Cas reached out, his hand finding Dean’s in the dim lighting and holding on tightly. Silently telling Dean that he was there no matter what.
not dying pigeon.” Naomi called out.
“Want me to be honest?” Dean asked. Cas nodded. “I’m thinking about how
“Like they miss a thing that happens in that school. Also, Gabriel showed me some very interesting footage from the cameras in studio A”
On the morning of the wedding, Dean woke at the crack of dawn. Try as he might he couldn't get back to sleep so he slowly made his way downstairs into the kitchen and made himself a cup of cocoa. Once it was made he took the cup out onto the deck and lit a cigarette. The sun just beginning to rise as he sat there, steam from his cocoa warming his face. He was so lost in his own thoughts he nearly didn’t hear the back door open.
Jess Moore?” Sam asked suddenly looking like a nervous fifteen year old. “Blonde? Tall? Inhumanly gorgeous?” Sam pressed. “That Jess Moore?”
"Amelia just said you two were close." Cas pressed.
he said with his eyes. Cas nodded in agreement. While Claire and Jack began to plan a road trip that was several years away, Cas coughed to get Dean’s attention.
"Cameras, make sure to get shots of them looking excited. I don't care if Sam had to flash some abs."
rude of you.” Zachariah said in that smarmy voice that Dean had detested back in Heaven but now he hated it even more.
Castiel walked back inside after nearly an hour of sitting outside. The cool air had calmed him down and steadied his breathing until he felt like he could be back inside Anna’s house. He didn’t say anything to Anna or Samandriel, instead choosing to walk back upstairs to the room he’d be sleeping in in order to get changed out of his clothes. He was looking through the small collection of his clothes that Anna kept for whenever he stayed there when Samandriel knocked on the door meekly.
was Jimmy calling him so late?
He stretched out his legs, ending up with them perfectly parallel to one another. Dean smirked at him as he too began to stretch, the two turned it into a competition to see who could stretch the furthest. Dean finally collapsed with a laugh when Cas' whole upper body was pressed against the floor, his legs still spread outwards in perfect parallel.
"Mom loves Cas." Dean pointed out. Mary did, she loved both the Novak twins. She'd always doted on Jimmy and now she accepted Cas easily, even with all his weirdness. Cas had a lot of weird qualities as well.
“I am beginning to become bored by your continuous refusal regarding my offer. The truth is that men greater than you took up these tools to rid themselves of the pain. You may think you are being honourable by refusing but really you’re just turning yourself into another pathetic martyr.” The whip holder said stopping his torture to move round the body of the man before him. The whip holder crouched down and peered into the startling blue of the man’s eyes and gave him a sneering smile. “You could just make this all easier on yourself by just changing that frustrating answer then we could both get up and stop this little daily rendezvous. I could make your infinite stay here an enjoyable one if you just let me.” He added.
“Yeah…” Meg said. “They’re a bunch of vapid-”
“Shit…did I do something wrong?” Castiel asked, his face full of worry.
“Spiralling? Interested in what Dean Winchester has been up to for the past twelve years? Clearly not emotionally intelligent enough to handle all this right now so you’re hiding in a closet like a child?” Gabriel intoned.
"I think I'll take the French cursing over brutal murder," Inais said with a shrug before he turned to Adam. "How was your Christmas?"
"Your brother, Gabriel I'm guessing, sent me up here so I could wait for you." Dean explained.
Castiel stared back at him, his eyes still wide. Dean was tempted to say something,
"You're such a moron at times. Why would he risk so much if he didn't?"
“That’s not entirely my fault,” Dean said with a smirk. “Getting a drink sounds like a good idea to me.”
"Someone is pissed off." Sam pointed out with a huge smirk on his face.
“You know, eventually we’ll have to return to reality.” Dean said as they were toweling themselves dry. Cas shrugged his muscular, tattooed shoulders.
“That’s fine, I’m just glad I can actually leave this place.”
“I won't cause a scene.” Dean said. “Shower then talk, OK?”
“I don’t want to hear it Castiel, just go to the office.” Ms Mills pointing in the direction of the office with a furious look on her face.
“So tell me about yourself Dean.” Castiel said as they slowly jogged away from the mansion. It was a stunningly beautiful morning. Dean couldn’t help but think about how it was great light for filming. He’d been in the television business for too long.
His feet pounded against the track making the familiar sound that he’d loved since he was young. His muscles complained for the first few minutes as he hadn’t been running since the last track meet the week before until they grew quiet and he fell into a steady pace. Part of him wished he had a stopwatch with him to record his time but they were all locked up back in the gym and he wasn’t in the mood to be caught trying to break into the gym cupboards on a Friday afternoon. He didn’t really have to worry about his time though; he had been the fastest at the track meet the week before just like he had for the last several months.
“Oh yeah, we’re old family friends," An open smile spread across Dean’s face. “Ellen and Bobby know my dad and we used to dance together when we were little," Dean said. “Man, I haven’t seen Jo for
“Nah, an RA took all my stuff up there for me but I haven’t had the chance to go up myself yet,"
“Sure thing sugar.” Dean said with a mocking salute as he walked towards the only free desk which was in front of Anna. Castiel watched as Ms Mills frowned slightly at being called ‘Sugar’ and the look on her face, reminiscent to that of a disgruntled animal chewing on barbed wire, was quite priceless and was normally the look she saved for when Castiel was derisive towards her…which happened to be on a nearly daily basis actually when Castiel really thought about it.
“What?” Charlie asked blearily.
“You’re a fucking asshole.” Castiel snapped.
“God, they let you back here? Are they out of their minds?” Cas said as Meg pulled him into a crushing hug. It had felt like years, instead of months, since Cas had last seen his best friend.
“I’m not prickly.”
He built up his speed as Dean became heavier, hotter and slick. Impatient feeling lips jammed against his own and every single minuscule taste of Dean was saturated in desperate and pleading want. There really was no going back. Building up momentum even more so Castiel revelled in the gasping breaths coming from Dean's mouth as the heat if their skin intensified until Castiel felt almost burnt as Dean rested a cheek against his own, stuttering gasps brushing against Castiel's ear along with his name tumbling out of Dean's mouth with hoarse desperation. Dean was becoming undone just the thought alone sent shivers up and down Castiel's spine.
(The idea to treat ARVC that Dean offers to Jo and Sarah) stand for Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and it is a small battery-powered electrical impulse generator that is implanted in patients who are at risk of cardiac related death.
“I missed you like crazy but I’m so fucking proud of you Dean, so proud,” Cas said into Dean’s skin.
“Hey, I’m twenty-five.” Dean retorted.
"World's tiniest violin." Dean said. Cas glared at him but Dean didn't back down. They only looked away when the back door opened and Jimmy came walking out, large coffee mug in hand.
“I’m scared. I’m scared that I’m not gonna find a way to sort this shit out. If that happens it’s gonna be on my conscience for the rest of my freaking life.” Dean said. “Damn, I’ve only been here for a day but I can see you’re a great guy Castiel. You care about people and its bullshit that this is happening.”
"Take me to bed Cas." Dean said, his voice wreaked with desire. A gasp escaped his lips when Cas gripped onto his thighs, expertly lifting Dean so he could wrap his thighs around Cas' waist.
"At me" Castiel said without any question to it because Dean probably had a right to be angry at him after what he did.
“Someone said something to you didn’t they?” Jo asked hitting the nail on the head instantly. “They
“Double cheeseburger please,” Cas said moving a few files out of the way to make room for the food. “Did you get enough food?” he added almost sarcastically.
“I’m going to sleep now Castiel.” Gabriel said slowly closing his eyes. His breathing became more laboured for a moment before his whole body stilled. The grip on Castiel loosened and Gabriel’s hand slid from Castiel’s skin to the ground. Even though it made the smallest of sounds to Castiel it was utterly deafening, it was the only sound he could hear apart from his own strenuous breathing as he held back his tears. He had to be strong for Gabriel; he had to be strong for his baby brother even though Gabriel was long gone.
He was too old to be having an emotional crisis. He needed to get dressed. He needed to stop thinking about Cas naked.
.” Novak said looking horrified by the thought. The harrowed look in his eyes sent waves of pity through Dean’s stomach. The guy looked so distraught that Dean found himself opening his mouth before he even realised what he was actually saying.
He never wanted to run more in his life.
"It’s probably just a catalogue for next year or something like that." Castiel said. Gabriel groaned loudly and stomped off into the hallway, muttering that Castiel was a ‘fun sponge’ as he went. Moments later he threw a heavy envelope in the general direction of Castiel's head. Castiel caught it just before it hit square in the face and glanced down. "From now on she can do her own damn theatrics." Gabriel muttered under his breath. “Just open the damn envelope you dick.” Gabriel said.
“Show off.” Dean muttered. Honestly, he was starting to feel total empathy for his poor old couch which probably meant he'd drunk too much. “Thanks for this...letting me come back with you I mean. I know I should be using this time to catch up with Sam but I can't really do that with him downing Jo's lethal cocktails.”
"Dr Novak I'm sure that is an abuse of power," Dean said smirking just as hard.
“So what the fuck are we doing here Dean? What the fuck am I doing here?” Cas snapped. “Why don’t we just break up right now? Save us both the fucked up heartbreak later on.” He said pulling himself up off the couch and going to grab his jacket.
“We knew each other for years, how come you never told me any of this?” Dean asked.
Sam skidded to halt when he saw the fierce look in Jess’ eyes. Her whole body seemed to radiate furiosity as she took in Michael’s words.
All I've eaten today is a power bar and a damn salad. I swear the thing was 90% leaf."
“Well, you’re shit at not interrupting people.” Cas said snippily.
When he was a boy his mother used to complain bitterly about them but for Castiel they meant comfort. His father used to make them for him when he was feeling unwell or sad so now Castiel associated the simple sandwich with happiness. He made himself a cup of milky tea to accompany the sandwich and settled down at the breakfast bar. It was strange, after all, breakfast was always served in the dining room but it reminded Castiel of the years he studied in Boston. Breakfast was always grabbed in a hurry before going to classes and never served on silver platters. He used to occasionally sit in the cramped kitchen back in Boston and drink coffee with housemates, talking about their days or complaining bitterly about their professors. It made Castiel sadly sentimental.
Castiel walked back to the party in a daze, his head swimming and his vision blurred. He was vaguely aware that Dean Winchester was at his side still in the immaculate suit but if the other man was trying to say something Castiel wouldn’t have been remotely responsive. The two men walked into the ballroom, Dean letting out a low whistle, and Castiel instantly caught Amelia’s eye.
“Of course I do. If there’s a choice between kickass surgery with you and cleaning up my shithole of an apartment with Sammy and Jo. That’s if her cocktails didn’t kill them both.” Dean said grinning over at Cas.
got time to prove you don’t deserve this.” Dean said.
“I’ve tracked down his brother.” Sam said completely stumping Dean in that moment. Whatever he thought Sam was going to say it certainly wasn’t that.
"Oh, I was a tumbler and was a base for stunts. That means I did tricks like back springs and caught the flyers during big stunts. It was cool and it turned out I really good at it. It kept me and Jo out of trouble and forced us to get ok grades. You had to have a 3.0 GPA to stay on the team so it helped keep my grades pretty high. Not genius Sam level but still high enough for a decent college." Dean explained and he realised he'd been talking almost non-stop for a good five minutes. "I'm talking about myself too much aren't I?" Dean asked.
“Which is worse?” Dean asked. Jessica still looked pissed but Dean saw a flicker of a smile.
"Zophiel, if he wants to talk then he can get down here and talk to me without sending you."
“As a heart attack Cas, marry me… again. No swans though.” Dean said. “So… will you marry me?”
"It's
“You've really found him?” He asked. Sam nodded his head in reply. “Thank you.” Castiel breathed out sounding beyond relieved.
?" Cas questioned after about five minutes of being in the air.
“Cas after everything I think I’m ok with answering one more question,” Dean said.
“Aortic dissections, Castiel’s doing an arch dissection tomorrow and I want to be ready for it. I’m going to be scrubbing in on it.”
Both Dean and Sam piled out the car without a care in the world and after breathing in carefully for a few moments Castiel followed because it would have looked strange to just continue sitting in the car. Dean strolled up to the front door and opened it before calling out “Hey mom, we’re home!”
"Still standing. Whatcha doin'?"
Opening the door that lead up to the roof, Dean took the stairs two steps at a time. Out on the roof, the Chicago wind was even more fierce but it wasn't strong enough to warrant going back down into the packed out apartment. The sooner he was away from the apartment the better. He couldn’t stand and watch as Cas talked to some random nurse or have Jo making obvious remarks or pitying faces at him.
“Wow…now I feel bad for getting mad at you. You should have punched him harder.” Anna said.
"Yeah...yeah ok, be right out."
in Meg’s room. Ate popcorn and drank these truly disgusting zero fat hot chocolates but it didn’t matter. She’s my best friend and I love her. She
The rest of the journey went by in total silence.
Meg flicked her burnt-out cigarette to the floor and gave Cas a smirking smile. “Ready for this bullshit?”
"Wow...do you keep in touch with any of them?"
“I was going to ask why that dick was here but it didn’t feel like my place.” Dean said.
"I would have killed you if it was just fucking but it isn't so I don't know what to do." Jimmy said. "Break his heart and I'll break your neck though."
“Don’t even get me started on that. I’ve already called both of them morons.”
“What were you doing up to see the list go up?” Cas asked Meg, hoping that it wasn’t anything bad for once.
Castiel Novak-Reeves.
Dean.” Hester piped up. “Especially Castiel.” Several people, namely Cas, Bela, Michael and Meg, glared at Hester over that comment.
"Yes," Cas said until the bus came round the corner. "No, I'm going to be sick. Dean I’m honestly going to be sick." He countered quickly.
"I'd say her meds are too high but this is how blunt she always is. She hasn’t sworn yet though which is a miracle." Said the tall blonde who had been sat next to Krissy’s bed, a chemistry book in hand.
“I really love you Dean, I’m so glad we’re best friends and family.” Jimmy said sounding only slightly sarcastic.
"Fuck, that's mushy." Cas said. "But, I can't wait to see you too." He added before they said their goodbyes.
“Yes. To all of it."
“That doesn’t surprise me.” Jack said as the pair walked up the driveway towards a large Tudor style house. Huh working in government definitely pays well Dean thought. Swallowing down his fear, Dean rang the doorbell. He prayed to whoever was up there that he didn’t throw up on the tasteful doormat. The door opened and Dean braced himself to see Cas. Instead, he came face to face with-
“Know what I wanna do?” Cas said, raising his eyebrows suggestively.
When Dean returned to the Novak-Reeves estate he could hardly stop his hands from shaking.
The cold chill Castiel had been feeling down his neck all day, all week actually, returned with surprising force once he stepped into the library. Out of all the rooms in the Novak-Reeves’ large estate the library was where Castiel felt at home, it was where he felt safe and yet now he had the strange feeling he was being watched. Castiel looked around the library but it seemed empty apart from Castiel himself. Still…the feeling someone was watching him still remained.
“The Seven? As in the archangels? They were both archangels?” Samandriel asked with interest. Seriously, if the kid was a dog his ears would have pricked up with the potential of acquiring new knowledge.
Dean just continued to stare at Cas. He hadn’t changed much in two years. His hair was still a complete mess, his stubble just as wild. Like every other man at the party, he was in a suit but the sleeves of his shirt and jacket were rolled up to his elbows many of his tattoos were visible. He was still as good looking as he had been the last time Dean saw him. That didn’t mean shit though. Dean couldn’t think about Cas like that anymore.
“Huh?” Charlie asked absentmindedly. Castiel looked pointedly at Charlie’s red hair which had been pulled up off her face and into a messy bun. “Oh…
“Look Meg and I are really good friends so it doesn’t feel right talking about this,” Cas said warily.
“As in…” Dean nodded. “Oh, you are so fucked. Mom is going to kill you.”
“Nothing like that happened Meg. We just kissed and I kind of slept in his bed. We’re together, sort of.” Cas mumbled.
"I need someone to keep an eye on me?" Castiel snickered. Anna gave him a playful push on the shoulder with her hand.
fall in love with you?"
“I’ll be there with bells on.” Castiel called back. He heard Amelia gave a loud laugh before she disappeared.
"He's Pre-Law, Sam Winchester. He's flying out for the wedding."
“Bingo! Gold star to Bradbury!” Sarah said grinning sleepily as she leant over and pressed a gold star sticker onto Charlie’s forehead. Charlie’s whole face was littered with shiny gold stars as were Jo, Adam and Dean’s as Sarah saw it as a good teaching method. “What percentage of Americans will get an acute appy?”
“Also no,” Castiel said, fighting the grin on his face.
“It’s six am, you want me to go
Finally after nearly six weeks of dancing around what had happened Dean finally snapped. It was a Tuesday night and neither of them was working at the hospital for once. Before the night would have been filled with Cas cooking and relaxing on the couch before going to bed. Now the silence filled the apartment, seeping into Dean’s skin and making him itch. He had to do something before he exploded. He had been studying for his upcoming intern exam for hours and the added stress was close to pushing Dean over the edge.
"Um...do you like cowboy films?"
“Dean...I know Meg was kind of blunt with the whole ‘Dead Parent Club’ thing but...we’re all here for you, ok?” Charlie said, her voice just loud enough to be heard over the film. It was almost as if she was afraid to say anything. “Meg, Jo, Bela and I...we all get it. It sucks losing a parent but we’re all here for you. If you just want to bitch about the world then we’ll be here to listen.”
!” Adam asked.
“Well done on getting the part son.” Dean’s father said though Cas could hear a twinge of insincerity in his tone.
Once again green eyes flashed in Castiel’s mind and the nineteen-year-old man posing as a police officer came back into Castiel’s mind for the second time that day. Had it happened that night? A chance encounter between two people that could have become more? Had Castiel let it slip by all those years ago when he had let the man leave and not call?
“Do…do you want me to leave?” Dean asked hesitantly. He made to move away but this time it was Castiel that stopped him with a hand on his arm. Dean felt a lurch in his stomach which he tried to ignore.
“Don’t look at me, she’s been planning this ever since you and Harvelle left. Wouldn’t shut the fuck up about it.” Meg pulled herself up out her chair and stowed her phone away in her pocket. “Come on Clarence, I ain’t doing this without you.” she added with an exasperated sigh as she looped her arm through Cas’.
“You knew jack all about angels before today so how did you stay hidden for all those hours?” Dean asked him.
"For God’s sake ladies! If you want to stare at some bulges in tights there's a drag show three blocks away," Gabriel yelled over to the door as he shot several glares over to the giggling girls.
." Dean muttered as he put Cas down. "Sorry."
Dean hurried through the house until he found himself in the kitchen. Jimmy was sat at the table with a large mug of coffee in front of him and a thick paperback in his hands.
"Cas? As in your resident
Hester went pale for a second. Everyone knew what Meg was talking about even though Hester had never owned up to it. Cas could feel the air around him crackle with tension. No one talked about what happened the year before but everyone knew exactly how Hester had been involved in what happened.
“My leader, my garrison and I built it. It was a safe place for my garrison when they needed it.” Dean explained. “The garrison was larger back then...we've lost some over time.” He added as his chest began to tighten. Ok maybe it wasn’t such an easy question to answer.
if Raphael is there? She’s our family and we love her, we can’t leave her there just because this might be a trap or some shit like that.” The look Adam then threw Dean was one of fierce determination. “If you don’t save her Dean then I’ll go. Raphael doesn’t want me dead half as much as he wants you dead. I’ll go and save her if you won’t!”
, you two can flirt in the car. Hurry up.” came Jess’ irritated voice from somewhere near the Impala.
Downstairs, Cas could hear the sound of laughter and clanging pots. He was warm and cosy in Dean’s arms but if he didn’t get downstairs soon then there was a high chance something would catch on fire. Careful not to wake Dean, Cas slid out of bed and dressed in a simple sweater and pants combo. From the bed Dean let a contented sigh, smashing his face into one of Cas’ duck feather pillows. Cas smiled to himself as he looked down at Dean. Even after all these years Dean really was the most beautiful person hee had ever met. Another loud clang from the kitchen pulled Cas’ focus from him. He prayed that his kitchen was still standing as he hurried downstairs.
Who had he been kidding? Last night couldn't be a one-time thing, he was pretty sure he was falling hard and fast for Cas and one night would never be enough. He wanted as many nights as he could get. He wanted to wake up to Cas' sleepy mumbling and ridiculous bed hair. He wanted long kisses in the shower and playful hip nudges while they brushed their teeth.
can go home.” He said pointing at Gabriel. “And you two can go upstairs to think about what you’ve done. Without your phones as well.” Cas said, holding out his hand for Claire and Jack’s phones. “Upstairs.
Dean let them into the apartment, making sure not to make too much noise because Jo was probably asleep in Dean’s bedroom. He really needed to sort out the spare room. In fact, with Castiel sleeping on the couch, he would have to move several of the boxes on the spare bed or he’d be sleeping in the bathtub. “Do you want a coffee or something like that?” Dean asked flicking on the light to the main room that served as a kitchen, living room and dining room.
The spare room was mainly full of the stuff Dean hadn’t gotten round to unpacking when he’d first moved into the apartment during the summer. A lot of the boxes were full of photos and stuff from Yale, college and photos from back home. There were countless textbooks and journals from both college and medical school, with the spare bed serving as a makeshift bookshelf. Both Dean and Castiel surveyed the room as they ate their breakfast muffins (and Dean could really get used to those damn muffins because they were fucking amazing).
“Oh…yeah, sure,” Cas said. “Try not to kill Bela. I know it’s getting stressful but I’m sure you can get through one rehearsal without calling her a ‘deep throat whore’.” That had been one of the more tame insults Dean had thrown out the day before.
“Excuse me? Who is in here?” He called out looking around wildly for the source of the voice and yet still only being met with the empty room.
? I mean you’re going to see me all cut open, gross and pretty much naked…again.”
Dean. She scares me more than any other person I have ever met. Seriously, she’s worse than my AP American History teacher, and I’m fairly sure he was possessed by either Satan or Ronald Reagan, whoever is worse.” Krissy was seriously babbling, a classic intern freak out, and Dean was pretty confident she was a few seconds away from shaking.
“Hey, you doing ok?” Adam of all people asked as he slipped into the scrub room and stood next to Dean.
“Oh of course, I concocted this whole plan just to see Dean Winchester without a shirt on. Now more your lazy egotistical ass before you talk yourself out of breakfast.” Castiel said. Dean pouted mockingly but let himself be pulled out of bed by Castiel and pushed in the general direction
Dean woke to a strong arm wrapped around his chest, pulling him inwards so his back is flushed against Cas' chest. He would have complained bitterly about having to be the little spoon but it actually felt damn nice having Cas' arms wrapped around him, legs tangled together and Cas' face buried in the crook of Dean's neck.
No. He wasn’t going to do this here. He couldn’t do this here.
“Fine, I will be your best man. I’m going to sleep now.”
“I don’t know what that means.” Claire replied. “Anyway, I just spoke to my dad and they’re stopping for coffee. He said they’ll be here in four hours or so.”
"Yeah, I'd do as Red says because we're about to have visitors." Dean said as a cold shudder went up his spine.
“Yeah, me neither. Hi dad!” Jack called out to Cas. Cas let out yet another long sigh and shook his head.
said it was his fault.”
Nineties rap and hip hop mixed with classical music from below on the streets. Everyone seemed at ease as they joked around and drank from their bottles of beer. Dean and Charlie were talking animatedly about a book series they were both fans of. He seemed to be fitting in well.
“I mean it, California is ruining you,” Dean said shaking his head.
"You're very bossy at three in the morning." Castiel pointed out.
While they did so, Cas explained everyone's little quirks. Anna hated eating facing a window. Gabriel liked to have the chair that squeaked because he was secretly five years olds. Ruby liked to sit near Amy so she could ask her questions and Meg liked to always face the door for reasons Cas still didn't understand.
"If I get a contract with the company I want to get it for my dancing, not because I was pals with the staff." Dean said. He must have realised what that sounded like because he suddenly shot Cas an apologetic look. "I didn't mean it like that." He said quickly. Cas waved him away.
“Hi honey” Mary said as she rinsed off a large coffee mug.
"And Cas." Dean said.
.” Jack said. “Dad? Dean…no,
“Anna won’t complain that way, there’s no way she could get into any bars.”
go now?” Jess asked pleadingly. Chuck just frowned and pointed at Dean.
"No shit." Dean muttered. "So you divorced me because you were a fucking idiot who freaked the fuck out?" Dean asked.
"Dean? Are you lost?" Jimmy asked. Despite how identical they looked on the outside Dean could see so many differences between Castiel and Jimmy. His soul was so much more stable than Castiel’s and at times Dean noticed that it thrummed under his skin in perfect timing to Amelia’s. If there were ever two people meant to be together it was Jimmy and Amelia.
nervous, Dean. High school and all.” Sam shot back, a sneaker covered foot moving to rest against the dashboard.
“Oh yeah! Just black coffee for me.” Dean said. Jo smirked as she took their order.
"They were fighting because Gabriel is Gabriel like always, Luke is Luke like always and Michael is a douche...like always." Castiel pointed out and Anna seemed to agree because she nodded.
“Nah, let’s just live our own little bubble for a few hours longer before dragging everyone else into it,” Dean said as he pulled Cas down onto the bed and covered them both with blankets. “So fucking proud of you Cas, so proud.” He muttered. Dean nuzzled into Cas’ warm neck, revelling in the softness of Cas’ skin and how he always smelt so…well so ‘Cas’. As the two of them drifted off to sleep - with Cas taking most of the covers even with Dean so close to him - Dean realised that he was fully content with the little life he and Cas had built together. Things were good.
“― ”I got laid”. Yes, I remember that, but I honestly thought he was only doing that to rile me up, as you two like to say,”
“It makes me feel powerful, and like I am worthy of the love you both willingly offer,”
At least one of the brothers could enjoy their newly-earned freedom.
“Well, it’s as you said, brother,” Benny chuckled softly. “It was left untouched, but if what you say is true, then it makes sense. Your God has no power here, but you two came across with some of that golden thread in you,” He shrugged. “Not sure if you noticed how gray and wild this place was when you were here, but the longer you two stayed, the greener it became,”
around your neck,” He pressed a quick kiss to the corner of the hunter’s mouth. “You have the angel’s equivalent of my
“If you don’t mind my asking, Cas,” Dean raised an eyebrow and gestured around him. “But how’d you score this place? Unless you’re secretly a meth kingpin, there’s no way you can pull digs like this on a college professor salary,”
But now the moon is trying its hardest to fight against the dark clouds, and Dean could feel his hands trembling in need. What he needed, he wasn’t quite sure, but he did know two things for certain. He was in town for a stupid convention, and he knew his old friend was still residing in the same old apartment. His old friend knew
“Well, I, uh,” He swallowed, rubbing his forefinger over the tracing of the W. “You’re...you know you’re family ‘n all, and you didn’t have a last name, so I just kinda thou―” Cas threw his arms around Dean’s neck and pressed a warm kiss to Dean’s blabbering mouth. When they broke apart, Dean was beaming. “I take it you like that, then?”
‘Euphoric? Powerful?’ Cas was wearing a secret smile. ‘Like lightning striking through a frozen river?’ Dean tilted his head ever so slightly. ‘I could see your thought patterns when I pulled you out of your dark state. It was unintentional, I promise. But, Dean. You seemed...’ He hesitated, but Dean smirked.
'Wouldn't be so sure of that, pretty boy,' Dean's perfect green eyes flickered black, and Castiel couldn't stop his wings flaring in a show of enmity. Dean's smug grin only spread wider. 'Damn, Cas. You been holding out on me?' He brought his normal eyes back, and there was a shimmer of awe in his gaze. Cas' wings stilled. He had forgotten Dean could now see his true form, broken and mangled as it was. The thought made him nervous, and it must've shown in his wings. 'Aww, come on, angel. Don't be shy,' Dean raked his eyes over Cas' form with a dark hunger.
“No, Sam.
“I know, Dean. I always knew.” He caught Dean’s chin and pulled him slowly in for the best type of kiss.
Emma stirred just as they entered the border of Kansas and was wide-awake and starry-eyed as Dean started yawning.
So he went along to the luncheon on Monday, grumbling in the back of his mind the entire time, until Crowley cracked a joke about the host’s perverted enjoyment of peonies. He felt lighter the rest of the day and was genuinely looking forward to this dinner date. Now he’s here, and all he can think of is how pretty Castiel’s eyes look in the glow of the twilight sky. Crowley had noticed the shift in his mood, and Dean didn’t miss the sly glance towards his bodyguard.

needed a drink.
“Nope, not with Em―

child. Their child. Fuck.
“I’m fine,” Cas smiled, waving hello to Eileen. She smiled, but her eyes held an echo of concern, like Sam. The taller man raised an eyebrow.

he gets on tequila. That’s probably going to come back to bite him in the ass. Oh, hey, there’s an idea, perhaps he could see if Cas would be willing to―
Cas sat there, in silence and contemplation. He was always happy to wait for Dean to start talking first. He saw himself as the second domino, always. He would only fall if Dean gestured for him to do it. Some might say it’s a dangerous way to be, but he knew no other way of being. He existed for his own merits, of course, but his own merits were usually aligned with Dean’s, or what would be Dean’s merits if he had no bars on his inhibitions.
“How’d you do that, Davies?” He surprised himself by the question. He was thinking it, for sure, but he didn’t know he’d have the nerve to ask.
get used to. He tightened his arms around his angel, and slowly rolled over so Cas could hover above him. They both made let out contented sighs as Cas broke the kiss. “How’d you sleep, love?”
“I was just about to say,” Benny was grinning wolfishly now. “I’m not a vampire anymore. Jack and I had a long conversation about it― good kid, by the way, could tell you two raised him― and he brought me back human, so I didn’t have to live with being a vampire again,”
“And its’ nectar is used for a trapping spell on a primordial being,” Cas shrugged.
closer than he expected. Cigarette smoke eclipsed Dean’s senses, but he didn’t find himself pulled away from it. Instead, the heady spice of Castiel’s aftershave cut through the grey and Dean found himself intoxicated from it. “You shouldn’t listen to anybody else but yourself. I don’t know you all that well, although I hope I get to know you quite well in the future. But what I can tell from having just met you, is you deserve everything the world can offer you, and if you have a gift, you should chase it to the stars,” He waved his other hand nursing his cigarette and glass gently. “And do me a favor,” He let go of Dean’s shoulder to pull his cigarette to his lips again. “Don’t get a job at Sandover. I have a friend who works in publishing who owes me one, let me set up an interview for you,”
“Just being honest, sir,”
The drink started to feel warm on his tongue, and the suds turned slightly bitter. He placed the bottle down beside Bobby, cautiously eyeing the oncoming dark clouds heading in from up in the east of the long, winding road.
Oh, right, and Sam was his brother, and throwing the mug at him would hurt him. That too.
“Oh, I understood you perfectly, Dean,” Cas’ eyes shined that magnificent blue, and Dean was helpless to succumb to him. “However, I know that you’re only wanting mindless sex right now because you’re grieving, and you need something to distract from the sorrow of being alone, truly alone, for the first time in your life,” A painful twinge in the upper part of Dean’s rib made itself known, and nothing could stop the wetness deep in his eyes.
“No, it is not,” Mary’s voice was cold, and Dean could hear how very close she was to cracking. She pulled a tabloid up from beside her and practically threw it at Dean’s face. He caught it, frown creasing his forehead as he looked at the front page.
“Brilliant.” Castiel widened his smile, and Sam felt his heart twist at the sight.
Jack closed his eyes and took a deep breath as anger washed over him. It seems with every step forward he thinks he’s making; Chuck’s past mistakes throw him back to square one. One more miracle, one more star to fall, one more thread of gold for the Winchesters’ victory banner. No matter, Jack thought, as he scooped the sunflowers into a bouquet he planned to send to his mother later on. He can take his time in making things right again.
know what it takes to make the teacher come undone.”
“It didn’t seem life-threatening,
, after all.
‘What’s there to talk about?’ Dean repeated. ‘All I know is when you touch me like that, I feel...’ He was speechless.
“Finally, what took you so long?” Mary huffed out as Dean and Castiel entered, Cas giving Mary a courteous bow before taking his post near the door, next to Sam’s bodyguard, Gabriel. Dean raised a snarky eyebrow at his mother, before giving her an apologetic smile.
dating?” Castiel gave him a curt nod and went to let go of his charge’s face, but Dean still held on. “Then why do I feel like this?” That stopped him, and Castiel was at a loss of what to do. Discussing feelings was never something Dean was ever comfortable enough to do, least of all with Castiel, unless under dire circumstances. “Cas?” He breathed.
“You make it sound like I shouldn't trust you.” Castiel said. “I probably shouldn't. I said that everything is telling me not to trust you but I do.”
“Oh my god, Michael Donner has touched my brother’s junk. That’s gross.” Jessica said, her nose wrinkling. “I need brain bleach.”
“I didn’t say love.”
“Why are you whispering?” Jimmy asked.
“No, I know you’re going to say that you’re sorry that you couldn’t save me but you did in a way. You gave me the chance to right the wrongs in my life and I’ll forever be thankful for that. I…I guess I’m ready.”
"Jesus Dean! What in God's name are you here?" Dean’s mother gasped.
“Told you it was full of stuff,” Dean said
“My sister will hang out with him, he’ll be fine,” Meg said. Dean did not look convinced. He had a reason to, Ruby was just as bad as Meg. “Dude, she’s
He barely registered that they were inside the school, riding the elevator or even on their floor until he and Dean reached the common area. Cas stopped in surprise when he saw Bela, Charlie and Jo all waiting up, their eyes red with fatigue. Michael, Inias and Adam were all asleep on the nearest couches. When Bela saw Cas and Dean walking into the room, she nudged Charlie while Jo shook Micheal and the others awake.
“So tonight we are having this sort of party," Charlie said, her eyes looking bright. “Well, not a party so much as a get-together. We’re all going up to the roof to just hang out. We do it on the first night of every term. Want to come with us?” She asked Dean. He looked at her with surprise.
"It’s amazing,” Meg groaned. “Fucking
was that asshole?” Sam asked.
“He does seem like the toeing of the line type.” Castiel remarked absentmindedly.
With a gentleness Dean wasn’t expecting Cas ran his fingers down Dean’s side and gripped onto his hips, locking Dean in an intense gaze that sent jolts of electricity through Dean’s whole body.
“Yes, it is. But before she left, Amara wanted to give me, uh, me ’n’ Cas, a gift. She, uh, well, it’ll probably be easier to explain when we get back to the Bunker,” Speaking of the Bunker... “Which has a
to help Dean. That wasn’t even a question.
“Let me,” He would say. Cas wouldn’t be able to find the words to respond, but he’d give his enthusiastic consent in other ways. A nod of his head, pleading eyes, directing Dean to his buckle...and he’d be rewarded with a glowing smile, so blinding...

“Wish I could say the same, cher,” The smile on Benny’s face showed his sharp canines, and Dean felt a hot flush crawl on his face at the nickname. He hadn’t been called
“Better?” Cas murmured. There was the smallest curve of a grin on the angel’s face. Dean couldn’t speak, too tongue-tied, too shocked, too overwhelmed to respond. “I believe that was the best course of action for you. You were about to have a massive panic attack, and I didn’t want to risk you waking Emma up,” He tilted his head, that smile still tucked in the corners of his mouth. That mouth...Dean had that mouth on
“You prefer orchids. Out of all the flowers the Queen put in her garden, you gravitated towards the orchids because they looked close to death,” Cas gave Dean a fond look. “And you nursed them back to health.” Dean chuckled.
“But, I figured, since their deaths were stupid, these three don’t belong in the early graves Chuck dug for them.” Jack considered Sam, Dean and Cas slowly. “Besides, these people are ones you all at some point considered family, and I would love to meet more of my family, officially.” He smiled, and Dean couldn’t control his wild heart and his racing brain as he ticked through his mental list.

“I know what you mean, Dean,” Cas smiled. “What do you remember?” He brought his hand to hold the hand on his cheek. Dean’s soul sparkled like a firework as their skin touched, reaching, reaching, reaching for his grace. Castiel wondered, for the thousandth time, what would happen if he reached back. Even though his superiors were dead and gone, he could still hear their furtive whispers in his head.
“Well, definitely Benny. Even if we don’t work out as far as courtship goes, he was always a laugh and I’d like to catch up with him again. This Fergus Crowley guy doesn’t look too bad, bit rough around the edges, but I’m down with that. And, maybe Lady Lisa Braedon? She seems nice. But Benny first,” Charlie nodded and took the folder from Dean. There was a weird queasy feeling in his gut, and he knew it was just nerves about the idea of marrying a total stranger, but if he and Benny clicked, that could be some type of reassurance. Maybe.
“Thought this was a dry event,” The man’s name was sitting on the tip of his tongue, but it
He would know that voice in any port or storm. Castiel opened his eyes to see Dean standing in front of him, timidly fiddling with the hem of his Henley. He gave the hunter a small smile, which he didn’t catch because he was pretending to be fascinated by his shoes.
“I did, my Lord, thank you,” He took a small sip of his wine and shared a conspiratorial glance with Cas from the balcony door. It was a beautiful, balmy night, and Dean didn’t want to have yet another dinner surrounded by his family, as much as he loves them. This was his second date with Crowley, and he wanted a small moment of privacy with him. As much as he could get while still at the palace. The food he was sharing with his date was sent over from Crowley’s favourite restaurant, and Dean has to admit, he likes the taste of his beef brisket from Inferno Bar and Grill. When they first met, Dean had been apprehensive of Lord Fergus Crowley, but after their first conversation Monday night, he was enjoying himself more and more. He was always a fan of people who want to drop pretences of propriety after introductions. Lord Fergus Crowley had immediately asked to be referred by his last name since he despises the name his mother blessed, or in his words, cursed, him with.
He made demands, asking for Chuck to bring Cas back. The rage in his heart had made its mark on the world around him, and he would let it burn to get his angel back. Chuck didn’t do as he asked, but Jack heard him. Jack listened and he wanted to help. Their son opened up a doorway to The Empty for Dean.
“Good, then that’s settled,” Dean glanced down before looking back at Cas, raising an eyebrow. “Do you trust me?”
“What makes you think she isn’t?” Cas tilted his head. Sam startled.
“Balthazar, how have you been?” Cas stretched out his legs on the couch, scratching the back of his head.
“I think you’re good and ready for the next stage, boy, what do you think?” Cas raised his eyebrow again, momentarily tightening his grace
“Sam would respect your privacy, Dean, come on,” Charlie shook her head.
“A little, but I still feel...”
“You two should head on home. I believe there’ll be some people waiting there to celebrate with you.” Dean blinked away tears and pressed a kiss to the boy’s head as Jack pulled him in for a gentle hug. “Goodbye, Dean.” Jack reached out for Sam next, pulling the taller hunter in for a hug too. “Goodbye, Sam.”
“Dean?”
“If your neck’s hurting,
“Dean,” Charlie gave Dean a fond smile before glancing towards Cas. “You’re never alone.”
, of course, I know you.” Dean felt his anger bubble up in his chest, and he had to bite down his protests about her avoidance of his troubles. It would do no good, there was nothing she could do, especially now, when she’s on her way to the Royal Botanical Show.
on Castiel. The unspeakable pull between them led Cas to wrap his arm around Dean’s shoulders, and the hunter shuddered.
That was all Dean could say. He didn’t even manage a manly clearing of the throat or even a light-hearted quip. Sam’s eyebrows shot up so high, Dean thought they’d gotten lost in his mop of a mane.
His heart leaped at the sound of his name falling from the only one who knew. Castiel was the
“Sweet...sweetheart’s fine, I guess,” He mumbled, keeping his eyes firmly on his all-too-clean plate. Cas felt a wave of vindication cascade over him at the blush on Dean’s cheeks. He could kiss them; they were so pretty. High off the adrenaline gifted to him by Dean’s reaction, he sauntered over to the sink. The blush in Dean’s cheeks became more and more pronounced, and Cas smiled before pressing his lips to the burning pool of red in the hunter’s left cheek.
“No,” He growled. “Your prayers are always
‘Cas, too,’ Dean growled, and Cas’ mouth quirked up in a half-smile. Crowley let out an exasperated sigh.
fly us back, but I’m not too sure how well Emma will handle being shifted through dimensions, especially with her powers to consider,”
So, Dean was
Jack stared hard at the leftover space in Heaven Chuck had all but abandoned.
“What?”
Right?
‘Of course, my apologies,’ Cas’ tone was void of any emotion as he approached the hunter. He still refused to meet Dean’s eyes as he broke the chains off his wrists. Dean rubbed the rawness on his skin, and Cas tilted his head as he gently placed his hand on Dean’s. The wounds faded, but Dean flipped his hand over to hold Cas’. Dean smiled as he heard the angel take a quick breath. ‘Dean?’
Dean only recognized the Savage Garden song and the Elvis Presley one. Something told him all of them were, at the very least, love songs of some description. He took the Post-It’s off his door and arranged them neatly onto his desk in the order Cas had indicated for him to read them, smiling all the while.
