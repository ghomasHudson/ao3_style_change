There was a wildness in the writer at that moment, he could feel it. Something clawing and brewing inside waiting to come out, with all of it, all of
He collapses on top of Dean, but instead of the Omega feeling uncomfortable with the heavy weight pressing him down, somehow it just makes him feel grounded and safe, the smell and feel of the Alpha surrounding all his senses seems to calm down his rapidly beating heart, lulling him into a drowsy, floating space, where it seems as if he's as light as a feather.
“Aw, don't look so grumpy, I got a major surprise for you.” Gabriel responds, waggling his eye-brows as a mischievous look starts to spread across his face, a look that, in the past, never bode well for Castiel.
“Please honey, I’d rather be prepared than hear you complaining for an hour straight about how you’re freezing your cute little behind off. Now, go take a seat and warm up a bit while I find someone to help you take off that complicated mess.” Jo replies as she waves a hand motioning to his outfit.
It was rare that Dean made requests from Sam, and he trusted his assistant to come back with all the information he needed on the writer who was going to be publishing an article on him and potentially be spending a lot of time asking Dean questions. He wanted to be prepared for whatever Cas would be throwing at him. Not that it helped when all Dean had done was scurry away from the man at the beginning.
Looking him up and down, not even playing at being discreet about it this time, the singer can’t help but roll his eyes at the writer, because of course he couldn’t leave behind the ever-present trench coat, even though it was almost ninety-five degrees outside, the evening air lending only a warm breeze.
With a firm grip in his golden strands, Castiel tugs as he draws his head up, getting the Omega’s attention locked onto his eyes, “What do you need my Omega, anything, it’s yours,” Castiel’s gruff voice speaks, words floating in the close space, lips coy as they hover close together, almost touching but not quite.
Cas, always quick on the uptake when it comes to him, asks, “What’s this look about,” his fingers drifting as he smoothes out the furrowed lines of his Omega’s brow.
At the sharp sting to his already tender lips, Dean opened up for the writer, allowing him access to all he could give at that point, and Castiel gladly slipped his tongue into the warm, slick heat of the younger man’s mouth, tasting and exploring and utterly consuming him.
Of all the thoughts, all the logical arguments he could present to John as to why this wasn't a good idea, the only thing that manages to escape his slowly narrowing airway is, “John, don't make me do this, with the tour and recordings, and events. D-dad, please...it's too much.”
Taking a deep breathe in, and collecting his thoughts, Castiel decides he should just start from the beginning.
That night in Cas's home, Gabriel himself had been slightly different from the person he usually was whenever they did shoots together. He was still just as goofy and loud as ever, not to mention totally inappropriate by constantly bringing up the couple's sex life, with Cas finally having to stop his brother when he saw how flustered and fire-engine red his Omega had gone when Gabriel's commentary had turned to the frigging sex toys they used in bed! Seriously, who the fuck even brings that shit up in front of their siblings, clearly the Beta had no such reservations or boundaries.
Before Dean can protest further though, Cas comes up to him and whispers intimately, “Like I said, just trust me, Dean”
With that thought being the push he needed to get the vague bubbling of excitement out of his system, he finally raps his knuckles on the door, taking a step back and bouncing on the balls of his feet as the last of his over-anxious energy seeks an escape.
However, I wanted to write something different and something I would have enjoyed to read myself. So, I won't be changing anything about my story unless it's my choice and I'm happy to do so. At this point I still stand with what I've written and honestly in this regard don't see myself erasing this scene at all in the future. I love my readers, but at the end I need to write what I want and not something someone else says I should.
Both of them were still fully clothed, trading lazy, indulgent kisses back and forth for what must have been the past hour, Castiel’s hands having found their way under Dean’s t-shirt as he stroked his skin, while Dean’s arms couldn’t seem to leave their position from around his shoulders as his hands moved all over; tangling in his hair, making it even messier than it usually was, smoothing down towards the nape of his neck, and across his back, the singer delighting in the flex of Cas’s muscles at every new spot he touched.
But then Cas made it all the better and yet so much worse at the same time, as he takes his Omega’s hand that was locked with his own still, drawing it up until his arm was similarly wrapped around thr older man's other shoulder. The Alpha’s now-empty hand grabbing onto the other side of his waist, fingers curling  more securely, bringing their bodies flush together and resting his cheek against the side of Dean’s head.
, worth it Castiel, then tell him what it is you really want. If he's not convinced you're what's good for him, that you're a great fucking Alpha, which all of us here know you are, then you better get ready to fight for what you want and fight for your Omega. Don't let this chance be your life's biggest regret, you'll never forgive yourself if you let that happen.”
At least he could take pride in the fact that he was damn good at his job and he was considered one of the best in the business.
When Cas had asked him about some big project the Beta had apparently been working on for a few months now, which would be showcased at a prestigious art gallery sometime the next year, Dean had been able to see a different, more serious side to him. The passionate and enthusiastic way he spoke about the ideas he had been throwing around as concepts for pieces he wanted to present reminded him so much of Cas during the times when the Alpha himself really got into explaining new research he had read up on or projects he was currently part of.
And maybe, just maybe, they both knew they were still lying to themselves, to each other. The love they had growing between them wouldn’t ever settle for their
Dean couldn’t help the pleased and self-satisfied smile that spread across his face at Cas’s comment, mentally patting himself on the back for getting something right for once.
They stood there, facing each other with Castiel’s back to the door, the writer unable to take his eyes off the other man and this time his hand didn’t hesitate like it had before as it seemed to move of its own free will.
Strangely in sync, they both salute her, with rim-rod straight postures and all, as they say in unison, “Yes, ma'am,” slinking off to do whatever it was they did here.
Castiel knew he was staring, but he couldn't seem to take his eyes off the beautiful Omega. He was wearing a pair of ripped, black skin tight jeans and a baggy t-shirt that had various holes slashed into them.
Castiel certainly hadn't told any of them anything about Dean. Let alone that he even existed where they were concerned. The only person who was in the know how was Gabriel, and he certainly had a grand old time when Castiel spilled the details of that night he and Dean had hooked up. But, Castiel also conceded that this was what made Crowley one of the best lawyers out there right now, even though he had slowed down with the number of active cases he took on, once he had decided to pursue the practice of teaching law around the same time Castiel became a professor.
There was a shadow that passed over her face, a sorrow Dean hoped he’d never know as the implication of her words sinks in.
The Omega can’t help but to step all the closer when the music finally drifted to his ears as the beginning notes of the song starts to play.
Cas seemed content to just watch him, head leaned against his hand as he watched the Omega with those blue eyes gone soft as he gazed down at Dean. The action should’ve been creepy, but it wasn’t, not to him anyway. Recognizing that in the Alpha’s look there was disbelief that Dean was even here in the first place and it was as if watching him,
He pulled out of Dean’s mouth soon after, wincing as the singer still sucked on his over-sensitive cock with every inch that was guided out, the brat actually smiling coyly up at him. He arched a brow at the display of the singer licking his lips as if to catch any stray drops of his come, “Mmm, just as good as I thought you’d taste, baby.”
it was bad enough that he was practically an open book to Cas, but it seemed the other Novak brother had his sibling's same level of observational skills, pinpointing the exact reason for Dean's discomfort on the first guess. It was either that, or Dean was just really fucking bad at hiding his emotions these days, a fact he did not like at all. The Omega knew, if he didn't get with the program again, soon, he would have an even more terrible time abroad, dealing with no doubt difficult and stressful people, who would take every weakness they found and use it against him for their own pleasure.
A numbing sensation soon started to replace his anxiousness, nerves held in check by foreign chemicals invading and controlling his body. Dean could feel yhe familiar echo of that glass dome slamming down around him, trapping him inside his own mind as the sounds and stimuli of the things and people around him were filtered and pushed out.
He felt warm. Castiel couldn’t remember the last time he felt this way, if he even ever did. It came from somewhere deep inside him, the warmth, a budding heat that bloomed, leaving no room for that cold, distant nothingness as it radiated out, touching every part of himself, every single corner and crevice, leaving the writer feeling as if he were being drugged, left to ride out this intense high.
He slammed his laptop closed at that thought, the screen to the word document he had open blinking out to black.
With an arched brow, Michael looks straight at Dean, “What would you have said instead then, if your
Fuck, he couldn’t seem to stop kissing the man. Or maybe it was Cas who couldn’t stop kissing him, drawing Dean back every time, trailing his lips down his neck when the singer had to separate to get some much needed air back into his lungs, making his way back to Dean’s mouth once he deemed he had been parted from them long enough
He messes around with the device for a bit, taking random sips of his tea since he isn't really expecting a response from the Alpha anytime soon. It was around eight in the morning and Cas was probably already at work. It's one of the reasons why he's so surprised when his phone pings only about ten minutes later with a new message from Cas.
But Cas simply shrugged his shoulders as he gave Dean one of those rare reassuring smiles of his, “I spotted an air hockey machine over there,” the writer says as he nods in the general direction where he spotted the air hockey machines in the far back, “don’t think I’ve played since I was thirteen, maybe fourteen years old. Was actually pretty good at it if memory serves well.”
On a basic level he knew people experienced either state in fluctuating degrees and although hyper-sexuality was a prime staple, with Alphas and Omegas exhibiting even higher degrees of this fact seeing as their sexual drives often doubled or even tripled that of Betas, it didn't always necessarily mean either was reduced to mindless sex crazed predators who couldn't think or control their actions beyond the next warm hole or knot, it just didn't work like that. Although it couldn't also be said that they never behaved differently in some ways or that heats or ruts were any less shitty since a reduction of inhibitions relating to their secondary brain functioning caused an automatic reverse in which part of the brain ran the show.
Castiel had only ever been to a hand full of the actual fashion show events compared to the after parties, which was the scenes he usually went to when Gabriel ever invited (or forced more like) him to come. Because even though Gabriel had been determined to get his brother out of his shell a little bit, Castiel could appreciate Gabe's tactfulness, since he was always careful to never push too hard and make him feel like more of an outsider when it came to these things, and his methods seemed to work considering the amount of times Castiel had actually agreed to go, even if he was reluctant.
It was something that surprised Dean, that Cas was so good at reading him, and maybe it wasn't something to be proud of, but he could secretly admit he took comfort in the fact that he was so good at being slightly deceptive and manipulative when situations called for it and people were none-the-wiser. He didn't know how to feel about Cas being an outlier to all the rest.
It was the same old mantra that he played on repeat in his head, which, if he were honest sounded more like a broken record by now than the encouraging words they were meant to be. But he couldn't let himself spiral down the rabbit hole like he did the night his dad broke the news of extending his contract so soon after he had just finished coming back from a tour that had already sapped every last bit of energy he had.
Castiel had always thought he was incapable of being loved, so utterly ruined and marred by life that he didn’t think
inside me, making me feel like I’m going out of my goddamned mind. And it’s not because I miss him, not that I don’t, I do, God, I miss him so much it hurts, but it’s different, I know it is.”
“But, there had been this one Alpha that took an interest in the new kid when everyone else already had their own cliques and friends. And it was nice, the attention. I-I didin’t get a lot of that, and suddenly here was this charming, funny guy who seemed to have liked me,” Dean sees the sudden dawning in Cas’s eyes, the flicker of wisdom that only came as you grew out of the naïve sphere of teenage thoughts.
**I feel I should say something about my thought process when I write this story that I'm not sure I'll include into the actual narrative: So in this Sam and Dean are only two years apart, not four. Dean is 22-23 and Cas is 27-28 years old at this point, and you can assume it's part of the basic info they learn about each other in the time gaps if I don't mention it later on.
“Hello, sweetheart. What are you doing, sitting all the way over here by yourself. If you want some company, I'd be more than happy to provide it.” Alastair says in a slimy voice, practically breathing down Dean's neck as he leans in to place a hand on Dean's thigh.
Removing the rest of their clothing in quick succession, leaves both of them completely naked, each taking a minute to enjoy the view of the newly revealed skin laid out before their eyes, Dean admiring the sculpted, well-muscled form of the Alpha's body.
After some thought, he finally says, “Definitely the straight A student. Not exactly quiet, but not exactly sociable either," and with a derisive snort he says, "you probably wore a shirt and tie throughout high school, though you don't seem to have been the type who particularly cared what other people thought of you. Am I right?”
“Judging by that dopey, heart-eyed look you just had on your face, are you sure it’s just ‘having a little fun’ for you?” Jo questions, as she comes around his chair to lean against the white dresser.
It wasn't very much phrased as a question, since Dean doesn't give the Alpha a chance to actually say no as he slides his hand down from Cas's shoulder to grab his hand, leading him to the middle of the dance floor.
While Dean had been setting up picking something to watch, Castiel had decided it was good to order in some food since neither of them had eaten anything yet. Coming back from collecting their food at his door, he found the singer loading the movie on whatever streaming service the hotel had.
But fuck, Dean needed it harder, at least there, where nobody would see the writer’s marks besides them, a secret only they would have, would know about.  He needed Cas to just fucking bite down and leave some type of reminder behind, for Dean to know that this was all real, that Cas wanted him, that he got to be with the man, if only this one time.
These were all small, inconsequential little details he had picked up, but they were meaningless in their materialistic nature when it came to Castiel wanting to discover who exactly the Omega was as a person.
Yet, at the same time, here Dean was, a mere man himself, made of flesh and blood and bones, nothing remotely ethereal or otherworldly, with lush green eyes, bright with mirth, smiling back at him every so often as the night wore on. That warm gaze aimed at
After their little interlude on the rooftop that happened about three days ago now, Dean hadn't tried to run away from him, but their interactions had been only the bland exchanges of two people who were unavoidable when finding themselves reluctantly orbiting the same spaces.
He didn't exactly know how or when it happened but Cas had gotten to him, burrowed deep down, deeper than his flesh, deeper than the blood pumping slowly through his veins, and deeper still than his slow-beating heart.
He had given himself the same pep talk throughout the day. It didn't help. Not when he kept finding himself looking across the spaces of the various rooms he had been in that day, seeing if he could spot the flash of a lone-standing figure amongst a pool of people moving this way and that.
He was a wolf in sheep's clothing, and Castiel would gladly use that knowledge, testing his own strategy as he says, “Dean seems to be handling things rather well from what I've seen, even for how
But when he saw how Dean had instantly clammed up as he sat there squirming, all awkward with nerves and twisting fingers, attempting to stutter out responses that weren't rehearsed, the writer had ended it, much to both their relief. It had been productive in a surprising way though, a learning experience they both needed to see how to go forward from here.
The evening was going rather well. He was glad to note that the Roadhouse did in fact have one of the best cheese burgers he thinks he has ever tasted.
Dean found that baking was always something that helped him to settle down, the mindless task of simply following instructions and letting the unconscious movements of his hands do all the work allowed his brain to shut down from the hurricane of thoughts it bombarded him with, often sending him spiralling into an anxious, panicked funk that he found hard to get out of when he let them get out of hand.
Dean looks at him with wide eyes as if the Alpha had betrayed him in the worst way and Garth looks at him with a big smile and then back at Dean as he shoves the sheet further in Dean's direction, pen pointed out too, “See, your Alpha agrees, if not for Ellen, do it for him, I'm sure he'll find a way to reward you somehow later on,” Garth says, the implications made clear as day.
Crowley lets out a whistle at that as Balthazar, in his usual fashion exclaims, “Now that is one fine, Omega. Just look at those gorgeous...” but before he can even finish that sentence, Castiel snatches the phone out of his hands and says in a steel-toned voice, “That's enough. All of you.”
As Dean moves his fingers through Cas's thick, dark waves, nails scraping against his scalp, the Alpha can't help but hum in pleasure and a sudden, raging urge goes through his body as he moves his hands away from the Omega's hips so he can tilt the Omega's head to the side instead, exposing the luscious expanse of skin along his throat. He moves lower, scenting the more concentrated sweet, ripe apple and cinnamon flavours of his scent. When Cas finally gets to the fading mark he had made at the base of Dean's throat right above his Omega glands, he bits down hard on the same spot once again, not enough to draw blood, but hard enough that Dean knows the bruise left behind will be just as visible as when he first made it, if not more so. The spark of please-pain makes Dean moan out and he can feel the stirring in his groin as slick starts to form.
It was while he was watching a pair grinding against each other, their obvious drunkenness making their movements sloppy but entertaining at the same time, that he heard a close voice asking, “Is this seat taken?”
Though Castiel hadn't been able to come up with anything new, besides impulsively purchasing a notebook he had seen at a random store, gifting it to Dean before he could rethink the whole thing. He had told the singer he could use it for anything he wanted when he looked skeptically at the brown leather-bound book.
And he knew, like the newbie photographer, the Omega was going to be the one getting eaten alive before the end of this trip if he didn't straighten himself out and soon.
At the same time, he was far from wanting this conversation to end so soon, so he instead tries to get them back to where they had started, even though that
Minutes pass, both Alpha and Omega catching their breaths, the lazy kiss they’re sharing not doing much in aiding their heart rates to slow down any.
“Need to be inside you Omega,” Castiel rumbles as he dips down, covering his Omega’s now swollen and saliva slick lips with his own, his tongue chasing the Omega’s sounds, only to draw back as his teeth nip gently onto that plush bottom lip, the slight feel of pleasure-pain from the ministration distracting the Omega as the Alpha plunges two of his fingers into the wet, slick heat of his pulsing hole.
Cas turns around, eyes trained on him, seductive in their heat as he zones in on Dean. The Omega feeling trapped by his presence, warm and tingly with nerves as his entire being seems to stop and stare at the sheer beauty of his Alpha as Cas saunters over across the room to his Omega.
It's that flicker, that spark of recognition that he grabs onto and holds close, looking straight into Dean's green, green, eyes as he says, “You're not the only one who has a story to tell Dean. You're just the only one out of the two of us willing enough to freely share theirs.”
Castiel starts observing the chaotic studio, his scepticism of them being able to leave soon growing, “You're sure you can leave already? It still looks rather busy in here.”
In that moment he had been consumed, and enraged, with the fact that someone was threatening not only the Omega the Alpha had set out to court, but the very claim to the stake he had made on the Omega. It didn't matter that it was a ludicrous assumption since he never even remotely made his intentions known to the Omega, but the only rationalization the Alpha needed at the time to justify his reaction was that one way or the other,
“It’s team building night, Cas, seems the crew decided to take advantage of the budget leeway and the fact that no higher ups actually care about work appropriateness. Not that I’m complaining, isn’t this awesome!? This is gonna be such a great night!” Dean looked up at him then, knowing he probably looked like a kid in a candy store getting to have the run of the place, but he couldn’t help it, he had never really been to any arcades when he was a kid himself and only saw these types of places in movies, so it was truly a dream come true.
But Castiel was equally surprised that although he never wanted to talk really, he still sought him out for comfort, and it wasn't ever hard for the Alpha to give him just that whenever he needed it. The pair usually ending up on either of their couches during those times, depending if they were at Castiel's or Dean's, with the Omega laying his head on the Alpha's legs as he gently ran his fingers through Dean's silky strands as they watched one of the documentaries about bees the Alpha had developed an interest in, and the combination of Castiel's gentle touch, his warm presence and comforting scent never failed in lulling the Omega to sleep.
“But in the beginning of ninth grade, John decided we should move to L.A, since that's where all the action was happening for budding artists and everything. Was really our last stop before I was signed to my first record label. But for most of that year, I was in the same school, managed to make a few friends, and eventually got a girlfriend too. I was happy. Just really fucking happy for the first time in my life.”
But fuck if he didn’t want this feeling to never go away. Cas wanting him sent a pleasant thrill through the singer, who couldn’t quite wrap his head around the fact. Still, it lit up something else in him besides the burning desire, something sweeter, gentler and more beautiful. Just as intense, but in a different way, wanting to be let out too, and Dean knew what that was, and he also knew he wasn’t doing the best job in keeping it from showing just then, not with the way he was clinging onto Cas, not with the way he was pouring every single thing he wasn’t able to say in the reverent way his hands smoothed over the man's body.
“Gotta settle with your mouth for now,” was all Castiel said before Dean bobbed his head quickly, enthusiastic about getting his mouth fucked even when his body was as lax and over-sensitive as it was.
Thankfully he wasn't scheduled to have another one of these shoots for a while, baring he had no last minute calls for the last couple of shoots he did so far.
“Dean, right?” The Alpha speaks first, the sound of her voice immediately familiar as he recognizes it from when they had spoken on the phone.
Not being above begging at this point, the Omega manages to stutter out, “C-cas, please please, want you, Alpha,”  when he feels Cas's thumb start to tease his rim alongside the other three fingers that are driving deeper into his body. With the added pressure, Dean moans as he feels more slick start to steadily trail out around and between Cas's fingers, his body preparing for the thick girth of an Alpha cock.
“Well, that's great, boy. 'Bout time you two sorted out yer problems, when you meeting up then? It'd be nice to see him, hav-”
“What made you want to hold onto her?” Castiel asks, and a part of him knows it's that inquisitive, journalist side of him wanting to understand the memory of a world and place he had no hope of truly knowing except through a few loosely strung together words that made the story he was telling all blurry around the edges, and it was Castiel's job to iron out the edges with his own questions.
The kiss goes on for a couple minutes, leaving Dean gasping and trying to chase after Cas when the Alpha pulls away.
Their breathing became harsh and jagged as neither moved to part for much air, Dean not being able to help the strangled gasp he let out at the contradiction of chapped lips scraping against the seams of his mouth, only for the burn to be soothed away by the slick wetness of Cas’s tongue, feeling Cas’s thumb move to the corner of his mouth, pressing down so Dean could open up wider for him, the kiss getting deeper and sloppier the longer it went on.
With the Omega's attention diverted to scenting along the column of the Alpha's neck, trying to draw in as much of his pheromones in his system, Dean doesn't even notice that Cas had started steering them toward his bedroom until he hears the bang of the door against the wall, no doubt from Cas having kicked it open. Instead of putting Dean down on the floor like he was prepared for him to do, Cas simply adjusts his hold on Dean's thighs climbing up on the bed with the Omega still latched around him as he knee walks his way to the center of the bed.
And as they move together,Dean can't seem to look away, green eyes captured in the almost hypnotizing stare as the Alpha's deep blue pools gave intently back a him.
The words washes over him, and he feels his throat clog, the Omega hiding the sound against Cas’s shoulder as he breathes in that rainforest scent, bodies slowly swaying against each other.
“Dean!” The singer heard his name being called by a familiar voice and spotting Sam raising his hand to get their attention he grabbed onto the sleeves of Cas’s coat, walking in the giant moose’s direction by the railings separating the bowling section from the rest of the game machines.
The whole costume, which is what the Omega called it, he refused to call it actual clothing, definitely deserved a spot at the top of his list of most bizarre, unflattering and downright degrading outfits he has ever worn in the history of his career.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The days had started to blend together, a litany of constant movement, constant nights of waking up not knowing exactly where he was for a few moments before reality had set in when the dredges of nightmares had washed away to that place he kept bottled up. Or tried to at least. It worked most days but it was getting harder lately.
Cas straightens up and goes over to his dresser, pulling out items from two of it's drawers, “That's good, you can take the pain killers I brought if your migraine isn't gone yet, and you can wash up in the bathroom if you want, here are some fresh clothes you can wear, sorry, I didn't feel particularly comfortable with changing you into more suitable sleeping attire,” he says, as if nothing at all is strange about this situation, as he places said clothes at the end of the bed (
Dean can feel the sudden hot spike of embarrassment from getting shot down begin to crowd his thoughts, blinding him to the fact that Sam sounds just as nervous and on-edge as the Omega feels, so instead of waiting for Sam to finish off whatever he was about to say, ears ringing he speaks over the Alpha and rambles on,“Oh, no it's cool. Yeah, of course you're busy, it was stupid of me to call anyway, it was a bad idea, I don't know what I was thinking.”
This time, there was no beat of silence that stretched on, there was only Cas’s blue eyes landing on his green ones, Cas stepping out of their embrace and turning around, facing his room door as he swiped his key card, and finally turning back to the singer as he stood there in the hallway, robbed of the heat Cas had been providing.
As the Beta fixes his camera onto the tripod, making sure it's set-on and angled properly for one of the scenes he had in mind, Gabriel shakes his head in mild amusement as he says offhandedly, “I swear, with how you two have been all googly-eyes over each other lately, I have no clue how either one of you'll survive your little trip across the pond for fashion week, or well weeks that is.”
“What the fuck do y-...” Castiel's words are cut short when he finally opens the door all the way, only to see that it's none other than Dean, in all his wide, green-eyed, golden haired glory, standing on the other side of
He was happy that he let Dean choose this place, if it were up to the Alpha he would have gone in trying to impress the Omega at a bar on the up-scale side of town, not knowing that this, more run-down type of place was more his scene. It made him all the more sure about where he was taking the Omega after this though, since he had some reservations while he had been planning their night's activities.
“Fancy, gotta say, I'm surprised Dean brou-...” before Garth can finish his sentence, another voice comes through to them yelling in a similar fashion as Garth had, “Oh my God, Dean!”
Dean's hand that isn't trapped between their bodies comes up to cup Castiel's cheek, not a slight bit of concern going for the fact that the still wet paint on his hand is smearing all over the Alpha's cheek as he opens his mouth in response to the probing strokes of Cas's warm lips and tongue that run themselves along the seam of his own plump mouth.
But just as Cas seemed to get better at reading him as every day went by, Dean got even better at reading the writer’s tells that weren’t really tells at all. In that moment, Cas looked rejected and hurt and Dean couldn’t blame him for that.
Well except for one aspect, which was the actual dinner portion of the evening, but he hoped Dean had a few suggestions and it felt right that the Omega should have a say in what they would be doing for their first time out. And okay, maybe him choosing was also a way for the Alpha to get a few more hints as to what the Omega liked, he had a feeling using more subtle cues was the way to go if he wanted to get to know a little more about the Omega's preferences seeing as he definitely did not want this to be their last date.
But it never went further than that before the older man moved away, pressing his forehead once again to Dean’s as he finally responded, “Fuck, I like you too Dean.”
As Castiel was thinking about ways to somehow rectify the situation, Dean had the strangest epiphany, a sense that if he never did anything now, if they both turned away, going back to their hotel rooms, separately, this would be it. The end of a
The silence stretches out between the two of them, Dean not being able to help himself when he keeps sneaking glances at the man sitting silently beside him, looking as if he had no intention of breaking his vow in not asking Dean questions once his guard was down. It's unsettling for the singer, with Cas not taking advantage of the situation since this would probably be one of the only times they'd be alone together by accident.
There had been a gentleness about her the moment he heard her soft, almost motherly voice over the phone, with Dean blushing bright when she had asked if he was Cas’s boyfriend, the Omega having stammered out a reluctant response, hoping that his Alpha wasn’t too private with keeping his personal life separate from his working one.
Taking a page from his dad's book, the singer turned back to the group and with a suave that came from years of practice, he put on his own version of John's charming and winning smile as he picked up the story right where John had left off and with an effortless ease he continued the fabricated father and son story his dad had been regaling to the appropriately captive group.
The room was silent, not an awkward kind of silence, but an expectant one as Dean could tell the Alpha was gearing up to say something.
“I-I don’t know, it’s gone, Cas, it’s gone,” The Omega was frantic, hand coming up to his neck, rubbing and rubbing over the clear flesh at his neck, trying to create his own pale illusion of a mating mark as he felt the conscious sting of his own fingernails digging into his soft skin.
Staring at her, and hearing the sincerity in her voice, Castiel's own resolve and conviction seems to snap into place. They had been wavering for a while now, lost to what Castiel felt was good enough for right now and the stubborn voice in his head that had been repeating, for the last month, that he should just enjoy whatever time he had with the Omega, because he would no doubt find Castiel a poor choice of an Alpha since he never thought himself to be anything special .
The sensual action had dual moans escaping both their lips, but this was all very much counterproductive to the writer’s goal, so he slid his hands down until they were each grabbing a hold of his hips until he had the younger man pinned to the bed, effectively stopping Dean’s now frantic motions so they could both calm down a little.
Not one to ignore the Omega's pleads, Castiel reluctantly tears his mouth away from where he had been sucking and licking at Dean, lapping up his warm nectar, and as he moves up the Omega's body to cover the man, skin to skin, his thigh slides in-between the Omega's parted ones, forcing him to spread out that much more for his Alpha as Dean bends his one knee up in acquiescence, grinding his ass up until he can feel the hard length of Castiel's own hard thick heated arousal right where he wants it to sink raw and deep inside his body.
With that he bends down and gives the omega a soft, chaste kiss on the lips, breaking away when it threatens to become more heated, something that happens almost too easily when he's anywhere near that soft, freckled skin of his. He trails his hand down to Dean's neck so his thumb brushes over the mark he left over his Omegan glands, which was very much intentional on the Alpha's part, and Dean would soon know the implications of the mark too. It was the Alpha's way of making his claim on the Omega known to everybody else, something that would need constant re-marking since it wasn't permanent, but Castiel wasn't about to go into this half-assed, not anymore.
It was a few hours later, while he was placing the apple pie he had baked onto the stove top, that he realizes he can't actually eat it.
“What happened, then?” The words were blunt and steel edged against Dean's softer and more vulnerable ones, but at this point that just defined who they were when with each other. Both finding a strange comfort in this fact, realizing that nothing had really changed since that first meeting on the rooftop, a balance to the unacknowledged fact that in reality, everything about their relationship had changed since Dean's request.
Dean can’t help it when he steps forward, running his hand over the name of his Alpha emblazoned on the door with such pristine that it shocks the Omega that someone like Cas could ever find anything of value in someone like him, a high school drop out who in all honesty couldn’t hope to keep up if Cas went into detail about his work.
Cas was a stone wall at that moment. He was cold and hard and unyielding, not letting anything through.
It was another one of those dead-pan jokes Cas seemed particularly good at delivering and not realizing whether it was a good reaction or not yet, the singer couldn’t help but laugh at that, the wide stretch of his mouth turning into a sly up-stretch of the lips as he moves to stand closer to the writer, crossing his arms as he shakes his head, replying, “‘fraid not this time, although your request for some shitty booze could very well become a reality.
And in those moments, Dean felt as if all the built-up stress and anxiety and fear and shame and longing and fucking memories became a little quieter when he let it out during their conversations.
“Nothin', nothin',” Dean's quick to divert. Even though he's relatively comfortable with the Alpha, nobody likes admitting to the person they're trying to impress that they're not that much into physical fitness, except maybe the kind that involves a
The first thing the Omega does is head straight for the bathroom, a long, hot shower definitely being in order after the day he's had.
Dean takes the reprieve as an opportunity to get his heart rate back to normal. He wasn't sure what, exactly, was going on right now, but a part of him was glad Jo had forced him into coming out tonight.
But he was here, in a strange place, being surrounded by people who couldn't give two shits about him day in and day out, putting up a front that he was fine, that it never bothered him when he found himself alone in his dressing room during the brief breaks they got instead of mingling and having more friends. Attempting to ignore the whispered insults doled out by up-and-coming models that his appearance never looked as striking as his pictures made him out to be, as they snickered not so subtly behind their hands, knowing that it would only get worse the bigger he became. But the ones about his perceived sexual favours in getting to the top were the worst, about how he sucked cock in his way to the top, made him feel dirty and exposed and humiliated. And the thought that if Cas ever heard that kind of gossip about him increased his embarrassment and made him nauseated to even think about the possibility of it ever happening.
But the singer knew with every fibre of his being that he could be the one to break that, to completely wreck and destroy and challenge everything that made Cas believe that, as surely as he knew Cas was destroying all his beliefs, all his carefully crafted barriers and walls and masks.
Dean could still remember the discomfort he felt at constantly being the new kid, all eyes on him, even back then, when teachers would introduce him to the class, the other kids watching him as if he were a shiny new toy. Not being able to really make any friends when he was forced to decline offers to hang out, not when he was constantly being booked for auditions or any other platforms his dad could find in getting him some exposure.
“Don't worry Dean-o, you still look good enough to eat!” Gabriel says, laughing rambunctiously at his own joke.
“Oh, would you care for another beer, I could go and get you one, it is rather hot in here isn't it?” Cas asks him as Dean places the empty bottle back on the table top.
Things came to a head when Sam and John had their ultimate blow-out on Sam's graduation, probably one of the worst nights of Dean's life. He remembered the feeling of his world slipping out of his fingers faster than he could hold any of it together, their exchanges becoming more heated, and when words weren't enough, the sickening sounds of fists connecting with skin rang out in their small motel room. Seeing John tackle Sammy to the floor had finally brought him out of the stupor he was in and he had managed to get them both off each other, earning a few bruises of his own as he was shoved against various furniture pieces by the two during the process.
It was hours later, after Gabriel had spent long stretches trying to console him, saying that Dean would be back and that he wasn’t gone
“Fuck, Dean,” Castiel responds, breath warm against his ear as the Alpha immediately leans over him, gripping his hips in a tight hold as he lines up once more.
Deciding that standing here thinking about all this was just putting a damper on his already gloomy mood, he pushes all those thoughts to a dark corner of his mind and locks them up tight. He didn't want anything to spoil his night with the Alpha, least of all his, admittedly, shitty self-esteem issues.
Giving a bitter laugh that sounds out too loudly in the quiet space between the two, Sam tells Bobby, “He wanted to meet up.”
But that's nothing compared to how grateful he is that he can finally get out of the frigid beach water. Doing beach shoots had always been his least favourite, what with the fine sand always managing to creep its way into every crevice of his body, the sessions always taking a lot longer since what would have been perfectly good photos were ruined by the unpredictability that was mother nature, where waves would unbalance certain positions or the wind could mess up the shot, not to mention the aggravating sting of the salty water on his newly waxed skin.
Both of them are covered with patches of different shades of paint, their hands being the worst off as they're almost completely covered, with the paint reaching just above their wrists. There's some soft music playing in the background that Dean had put on before they got started, and they both just lie there, enjoying the silence of each other's company, the Alpha taking the Omega's hand in his as he twines their fingers and places them on his chest, over his heartbeat.
And now here Cas was, with his stupidly blue eyes and big soft hands caressing him, arms embracing him as he folded Dean into the contours of his body, letting Dean rest his head against his chest, hearing the strong beat of his heart underneath his clothes as the singer moved his own arms underneath Cas’s trench coat, hugging him back and soaking up all the heat Cas was radiating.
“Really? Oh God, you weren't like the emo, goth type were you, if so that would have been so cool, I could totally picture it, fake piercings, gloved arm tattoo, heavy black boots,” Dean laughs at his own description, finding delight in his imagination of a teenage Castiel listening to hard-core metal rock music and the whole ordeal that came with that particular stereotype. The Alpha himself can't help but let out his own chuckle at that as he replies, “No, definitely not that type of teenager, I assure you.”
It was why he never asked Cas if he wanted to be there during his heat, he knew it wouldn't be the sex-fest the Alpha no doubt expected.
Smiling conspiratorially, Cas replies, “Only one more,” and he turns his attention back to the basket as the Omega sees him rooting around in it to get whatever else it is he has in there.
He thought that was why it was easier opening up to Dean, all those long-ago stories tasting like acid, scorching and tearing at the tender, soft flesh of his throat as they made their way out of his mouth, the words bubbling and bubbling to the surface, until even he was surprised at how much he had said. Still, Castiel thought they were probably easier to get out than the ones he wanted,
Castiel had, for a brief moment, thought they would have at least made it the few steps to the couch, but his Omega’s hands are impatient as they start to strip the Alpha, and Castiel’s mind, so addled with arousal and heat and
“How long've I been sleepin',” Dean's words slurred out of his mouth as the dredges of sleep tried to pull him back under.
Cas's mouth moves gently, yet firmly over his, the tip of the Alpha's tongue swiping over the seam of his lips, until the Omega opens up for him, but not before the Alpha's teeth graze and nibble against the plump flesh of his bottom lip, before delving in to deepen the kiss, thoroughly claiming the Omega's mouth for his own right there in the middle of the fucking bar.
At his unwavering blue stare, John's lips curled into something mimicking a smirk of satisfaction, as if he were pleased with the new player in his little game.
In the end they had struck up a deal, he would give Sam the job, if he promised that he wouldn't be running around telling John about every single detail of his life. A fact Dean knew was one of the only reasons why John wanted him to get a PA since the business end of his career made it so that his dad couldn't be with him every day and every where he would be travelling. Predictably, John hadn't been so gung-ho on the idea of hiring somebody so young, but Sam was the one thing Dean hadn't backed down on, and not telling his dad about the fake documents probably helped his case too though.
Before Dean can say anything, he turns to the side when a splash of colour catches the corner of his eye, only to find that there is a small bouquet of flowers, sitting innocently by the edge of the kitchen counter, out-of-place and seemingly forgotten there, “Those are pretty, where did you get them?” The Omega says as he nods his head up in the direction of the flowers, mostly as a way to change the subject of their conversation.
He wanted Cas’s perpetually chapped lips to scrape against his softer ones, he wanted the older man’s arms to wrap around his waist while his arms went up and circled Cas’s shoulders, hands sliding through his messy strands, mussing his hair up even more. He wanted the writer to invade his space, even though he never enjoyed it when people did that, but he didn’t think he would mind if Cas took that liberty. He wanted to feel how their bodies would be as they fit flush together, the heat permeating and growing as they got wrapped up in each other. He wanted Cas’s strong hands to stroke and scratch up and down his back, bending and arching it the way he wanted, hand coming up to cup and hold Dean’s head, moving it as he searched for the best angle to deepen the kiss, tongue probing and exploring of its own volition. He wanted Cas’s mouth to move against his, maybe not so gently anymore, wanted Cas’s tongue to join in the rougher and sloppier ministrations of completely wrecking Dean.
Soon enough though, Castiel found that along with the physical attraction that grew even more instead of less the longer he saw Dean, his interest in him grew ten fold. This was mainly because they always ended up losing time simply talking to each other, the Omega opening up to him and actually willing to answer all the random questions Castiel threw his way, being especially more susceptible to this tactic of the Alpha's, in a ploy to get to know him better, when he was all warm, and soft and pliant in his arms after their more strenuous
Dean didn’t know whether to feel more disappointed or relieved at Cas’s indifference. For all his talk about knowing Cas’s tells, sometimes the man still confounded him and threw his for a loop. Something he suspected wouldn’t change no matter how many amounts of time Dean could spend with him.
Opening his eyes at the quiet words and the shaking to his shoulder, which slowly brought him out of the deep sleep he was in, Dean groggily pushed himself up, rubbing the palm of his hand against his sleep-swollen eyes.
all of him, he dreaded having to ever tell him about the hell he'd been through and the scars they left behind.
Finally, once he’s three fingers deep, he finally withdraws, his instincts roaring at being denied the tight heat of his Omega for so long now impossible to ignore.
And this time, it was Dean’s turn to smile, placing his hand in Cas’s, feeling the heat return as he laced their fingers together, squeezing Cas’s hand just slightly as he responded, “Yeah Cas, I’d like to. Very much.”
But that just leads to Castiel openly staring at the deep, golden-green hue of his eyes that are staring back at him with amusement, the writer noticing the crinkle and genuine mirth in them instead of the polite and confused looks his humour usually gets.
When those thoughts wandered too far, became too loud to ignore, he then tried to imagine what other people saw that made them all comment on his good looks, that made them all suffocatingly love him so damned much, yet still all he could see were softly bowed lips that looked too feminine for his own good and caused more trouble than what they were worth. Freckled skin that he had to constantly cover up no matter where he went, all in an attempt to mask both the childish spots that never quite matched onto the smooth faced image being sold to the world, and to cover the black and blue blemishes left behind by angry fists when nobody was looking. Green eyes that he remembered seeming to be so much brighter in their hue, but now instead just stared dully back at him, the bright, golden green now gone dark and mossy, tinged with red from his constant lack of sleep.
He then decided it was probably best to be as blunt as he could, diving straight to the point as he leaned in, “I would very much like to fuck you right now Dean,” he whispered, causing an imperceptible shiver to run throughout the young man’s body, the writer feeling the tensing of his muscles before he seemed to melt back down into the mattress.
The words were said quietly, meant only for Dean's ears, and looking down at the ground Dean nodded his head as the knot in his stomach seemed to travel up his chest, making his throat clog with a burning sensation he knew would make his voice quiver if he so much as opened his mouth.
Unintentionally Sam snorts, and when he finally looks over and down at Dean he has the oddest smirk on his face, one Dean can't quite place, “Oh please, you saying you're not then?”
Eyes widening at the sensual display and words, Cas wastes no time in latching his mouth back onto the Omega's as he says between breathless kisses, “I can do that,” in a voice equally filled with want and need.
“Hey, wanna sit out back for a bit, get some air?” the singer asked before he over-stepped the bounds of this night, which Dean thought was looking and feeling a lot more like a date the more he thought about it and the whole getting dinner after made it seem even more so.
Thoughts and speculations about what the Beta meant and what he could possibly do filtering in and out through his mind since the encounter with Alastair sapped the last of Dean's energy, knowing his slate wasn't as clean as he pretended what with the minimal amount of scandal and drama he stirred even with his high end status, preferring to live as peacefully as he could under the radar, which worked out well for him since the media had little interest in his boring personal life. It all left him drained, mentally and physically, the tension building until he could feel the strain of it in his eyes and throbbing through his skull, hoping it wouldn't serve as a catalyst for one of his migraines to take advantage.
“Shit, what’re ya doing to me Cas?” Dean asked as he stared, with round almost shocked eyes at the older man, whose entire body weight was holding his own down, trapping him in the most delicious way possible, forcing his body to yield to his commands, and damn if that wasn’t fucking hot, riling him up just that much more.
Castiel doesn't dispute that either, since he couldn't deny that he felt more himself than he had in a long time, if ever. As if he had the all clear to finally be comfortable in his own skin, but he also knew that Dean was the catalyst to this change in him as well.
Although the Omega had walked off before Castiel could respond, he thought he could hear a note of hopefulness in the Omega's voice, but that was probably his mind playing tricks on him. He was certain he never left any kind of memorable impression on the Omega, that was for sure.
The writer was concerned with knowing he’d probably never get enough of kissing this man beneath him, never grow tired of hearing his voice, feeling his touch, exploring his taste, being inside him, and just being with him.
“Yeah, if there's any movie I'd remember watching when I was younger, it'd be this one. I saw it during one summer vacation, and it was Gabriel's last few months at home before he went off to college. He could have done a million and one things with his friends, you know, the last hurrah and all that. But he knew how devastated I was that I'd soon lose basically my only friend and ally. So he vowed he'd spend the summer with me, and we'd go off and have our own adventures, just me and him.” Cas smiles at the memory of how Gabriel had come to find him sitting in their tree house, his not-so-secret hideout, when he tried to cover-up the fact that while he was happy Gabe managed to get into CalArts, he was ashamed that he had felt sorry for himself, because no matter how much his brother annoyed him, he would miss having him around and he would miss having somebody to talk to. He had been elated, no matter much he tried to talk Gabe out of it, when the Beta proclaimed that he was planning to spend his entire summer at home, so he and Cas could 'make some memories' as he put it.
Breathing out a long, deep sigh, Dean accepts the situation for what it is, no use getting worked up when the Alpha had clearly helped him out last night and he couldn't reward his kindness by sinking into a nervous and panicked mess. It's also then that Dean remembers that he had actually been looking forward to seeing Cas the entire week and he smiles a little when he stares at the familiar blue eyes that he finds watching him intently when the Omega hasn't given a response yet.
Castiel had been a little sceptical, because it seemed to be the type of artistry that walked the fine line between being considered appealing to the eye or simply end up being just one big bloby mess and the results one would get seemed to be a fifty-fifty toss-up of either, based on the multiple pictures and videos Dean had sent him. But the Omega had insisted and said it looked easy enough, and well, all the Alpha could really do was give his in-put with Dean making the choice for himself, and besides he was happy to help regardless.
All Dean can do is nod vigorously until he feels the blunt head of Cas's cock breaching his fluttering, empty hole. For a minute there Dean tightens up in response to the intrusion, but then the Alpha kisses him hard and deep, making the Omega go all soft and loose-limbed with the way he ravages his mouth as he plunges his tongue in at the same time that he pushes his throbbing cock deeper into his ass.
“Cas, come on, need you in me,” Dean knew he wouldn’t last much longer, his own cock hard and leaking, already fired up and ready to explode. It’d been a long while since Dean had bothered finding a discreet enough hook-up, let alone finding the energy to get himself off and it was too much, too much stimulation, too much arousal coursing through him and he was ready to just let go, but fuck, he wanted the man inside him first.
But he was so so wrong, as the Omega decided to lean in and press his lips against the Alpha's, and with the shock of the action taking momentary control of his body, the Alpha didn't know how to react at first, but then Dean had let out a moan that set the Alpha off and all of a sudden he couldn't seem to get enough.
