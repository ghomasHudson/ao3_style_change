The door opened and Greg walked in.  Sherlock eyed him wearily, subtlety shifting his weight to prepare himself for anything Greg might do.
“Do you know anything about that building there?” he asked, pointing to the one that Greg had brought him to.
“Fine,” Greg said.  “Here.” He tossed a key to Sherlock.  “Between now and then, do what you can.  Get me something.”  He quickly left.
Nobody said anything.  Sherlock glanced around.  Jim still had his mask off, but the others.  Sally was to his right.  Molly. Greg. John. Sarah.  And the others behind them?  Workers from the dig, or...if the benefactor was a terrorist would this be a private army?  Both, most likely.
“Damn it,” he whispered silently.  Maybe there was something he could salvage, but he would do it later.  He pushed back the wooden chair, the legs scraping roughly across the floor boards.  He quietly closed the laptop, went to the door, opened it, and left the room.
There was nothing to tell.  Curious and scared.  Nothing to be scared of.  Scared.  Mary wasn’t in the best of moods when he left.  If Molly said something, anything, would it make it even worse?
“You don’t want to know,” Greg said.  “This is your new assignment.  You WILL translate it and I don’t want to hear any excuses.  Start on this tomorrow.”  He turned to leave the pit.  “Come on.”
Sherlock wandered out of the cafeteria, looking around, trying to avoid the guards, before wandering about, acting as though he moving about randomly, but very carefully working his way to the building he saw John and Richard at earlier.  But as he got close to it, one of the guards came up to him.  “Nereye gidiyorsun,” the man said.
“Yeah,” Greg agreed.  “I think that I have some workers to spare to start laying out the grid lines and begin with some excavation.  I want you to coordinate with Richard on that.”  Sherlock noticed that John frowned slightly when Greg said that.
She looked over at Sherlock.  “Mmmmm. He knows exactly what I want,” she moaned as she parted her legs slightly so that he could lick her clit better.  “His tongue feels so good right now.”
John shuffled in from the kitchen.  “Is that finally over?  I think they were going to be showing some T20 tonight which I thought I might catch.”
Greg moved back in front of Sherlock, forcing him to take a step back.  “So, I have all of the updates from today’s digs.  John, I think you’re really getting somewhere in Building Two .”
He was just arranging the books he had brought on the chest of drawers when there was another knock on the door.  Sherlock looked over.  Greg stood there, smiling broadly.  “Ready to meet the rest of my team?” he asked.  “I know you’ve met some...” He trailed off.
“Are...”  Sherlock started, but trailed off.  Greg didn’t even glance at him.  Sally and her workers stood nearly motionless, just shifting slightly. “I’ll just go.”  As he headed back to the dorm he heard voices start up again.
"Nice to meet you Ms. Hooper,” he said, letting go of his suitcase and awkwardly extending his hand, trying to keep his duffle bag from dropping off his shoulder.
Sherlock turned around and John moved in to kiss him.  He was shocked by the suddenness.  He had wanted to tell John that while he was flattered, getting him into bed wasn’t going to magically produce results that did not exist.  But the contact flustered him and he enjoyed the feeling of John against him.  He pulled John in tight instead.  John grabbed Sherlock’s shirt and began to pull it off of him and then followed with his own, moving back in to passionately kiss him when they were bare-chested.
It was dimly lit with only the faintest of sunlight slipping through the cracks between the pieces of steel.  Greg pulled a torch out of his jacket and led Sherlock to a pit and down some crude stairs.  He turned off the torch and fumbled around in the near darkness.  “This is it,” he announced as a halogen light illuminated one of the sides of the pit.
When he came out, she was already in bed.  “He called,” she said as she rolled over.  “I guess it’s time to go running off to him.”  She said nothing else and lay still.
They got up and left the room, talking among themselves.  Sherlock turned to Greg.  “I’m not sure why I’m here.  If it’s Achaemenid history we’re talking about...”
“The logograms,” Sherlock explained, somewhat patiently. “It’s Hattic.” He quickly added, “I think.”  He dropped down next to Greg.  “The repeating blocks, not all of them, but several of them are names, and much like Egyptian hieroglyphs, these have a distinguishing mark.  Here they have an additional line over the logograms.” He looked over at Richard.  “Scribbles, you said?  Didn’t think I would notice the patterns and marks?”
“I’ve no need to,” he said, shouting a little. “It all comes to me.  Quite often people will send me a picture of something they’ve just dug up and I’ll work on the translation and send it back to them. It’s cheaper for them to do it that way, so unfortunately I really haven’t had the opportunity to do any.”
Surprisingly, it was pretty straightforward.  It took him until early afternoon in order to make a rough translation of the three tablets. It was all very technical, unlike most of the cuneiform tablets he was used to translating.  The part that made sense was a description of the alignment of channels.  What didn’t make sense was the logograms discussing many suns and combining their rays.  He went over his notes three times, but it was the best translation he could do at this time.  He must be missing some sort of nuance, maybe it was some sort of mystical treatise.
Sherlock sighed.  “This is completely new.  It’s not like there’s a database out there with logograms from late neolithic Anatolia because none have existed before.”
“What do you mean ‘no’?” Greg asked incredulously.  “You translated what was on the wall.  Why can’t you do this?’
The space they were excavating wasn’t particularly big, approximately 6 metres square.  String criss-crossed the whole area, breaking it into square quadrants.  Molly stood to the side with a notebook and would direct the three men as they slowly scraped away dirt to expose bone.  The other woman sat on the edge of the shallow pit, sketching how the bones were lying as they were exposed.
The corridors wound endlessly through the rock.  Sherlock tried to make note of points he passed, but there was a sameness to them all.  It was the same sparse retro-futurism look with minimal lighting, enough to allow him to see where he was going, but nothing to orient him; nothing like what he would expect in a neolithic settlement.  Doorways led to other rooms, some the same size as the one he had been in with Jim, but others were much bigger.  Other doorways led to more halls.  His eyes darted about for logograms from the Atlanteans, or some other signs that the dig might have placed to help them navigate this labyrinth, but there was nothing.
Jim put the tube down and walked over to a cabinet along the wall.  He opened it, and pulled out a block, and dropped it on the table in front of Sherlock.  Sherlock reached out and lifted the top.  It was a book. Only it was made of thin, metal pages instead of paper.  His eyes scanned quickly the logograms that filled the page and he began to quickly flip through them, going through as many of the pages as quickly as possible.  The logograms themselves were not uniform nor always neatly spaced, as though somebody had written them into the metal.  He rubbed his finger over them.  There were no sharp edges or burrs.
Sherlock went back to his room to grab his notes before sitting down at the computer.  He was just about to open Word when he noticed that there was an Explorer icon on the desktop.  He double-clicked it and a security window opened asking for a password.  How strong was the password?  He tried ‘password’, ‘1234', ‘ABCD’, and all of the other common passwords that the average person used.  Nothing.  He tried Greg’s name, the town they were in, all sorts of names from history important to Anatolia.  Still nothing.  Sherlock sighed and closed it before opening Word.
Sherlock pursed his lips.  “You were expecting more? Did you want more?  Was it not enough for you?”  he pressed.
The sun was already hovering above the horizon by the time he decided to call it quits for the day and left the building.  He had to knock on the door for it to be opened for him.  Veli handed him his cell phone back and re-locked the door.  Back in his room he reviewed his notes.  He had spent the day just looking at the blocks, finding several that repeated multiple times.  Those he had carefully copied over in his notebook.
Greg stared hard at him.  “You were hired to come here and do a job.  If you don’t think you can, I’ll send you on your way.”
John dropped the mask, a harsh metallic clattering on the stone floor. He approached Sherlock.  Sherlock eyed him warily, but as he approached, he lowered the tube pointing at John.  John gently took Sherlock by the arm.  Sherlock swallowed hard.  John escorted him towards one of the walls of the cavern.  Jim started signing, ‘For he’s a jolly good fellow.’  Sherlock glanced back at him and saw Jim wave his arms to encourage everybody else to sing along, which they started to do.  The song echoed around the chamber.  Sherlock willingly allowed John to guide him, but at the same time kept any eye on the rest of the figures whose dark hooded heads followed his movement.
His eyes flew open.  Time.  He grabbed his notebook and flipped through it.  One of the cubbies he had translated had a discourse on the movement of the planets.  He went back to the article on the Antikythera mechanism.  Other than the wild idea that it originally came from an ‘earlier advanced civilisation’ the article itself was rather boring.  The leaps of logic one would have to use to reach the conclusion required a certain suspension of disbelief and the amount of the archaeological record that would need to be ignored was enormous.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied, and drifted over to look at the dildoes that he and Mary had been looking at earlier.
Sherlock’s heart was racing, and he wanted to go back to his room, but he thought it best to stay where he was.  He sat back down, pulled out his notebook and went through various logograms he had copied.
Sherlock began to back up slowly, putting his hands up.  “It’s not a problem...” he mumbled.  He backed into another man and jumped.  When he whipped his head around, he saw it was Greg.  “I didn’t...”
Richard stood up, pushing out his chair loudly as he did.  “Sherlock Holmes...”  People around them were looking at them.  “I will be impressed, I will, completely and totally be impressed, if somehow YOU can take that and make it mean something.”  He laughed. “I mean, the brilliant cu-NE-i-form-ist figuring out a kid’s art project-”
Here?  Where exactly was here?  Was he sure where he was?  Could he trust himself to know that this was London?  He assumed.  Experience taught him.  What was his experience?  Experience taught him nothing tonight.  He experienced, but he didn’t.  None of it made any sense.
Moonless, starless sky.  Thick, heavy clouds blanketed the city.  Suffocating.  He felt that if he pushed out to the edges of London, the clouds would descend to the ground and there would be no leaving.  He was trapped here. This wasn’t anything new.  He had always been trapped here.
Sherlock sat back, surprised at his intensity.  “I think you’re compensating for your inability to solve this problem.”
John was on his knees immediately.  Mary walked over to him and gently placed her hand on the back of his head.  He knew instinctively what to do and began to kiss and lick Mary between her legs.  She sighed as she pressed his head in and urged him on with her fingers.
“Sorry,” Greg apologized.  “I like John, but sometimes he seems to think he’s the one in charge of this dig.”
Down in the pit, he turned on the two halogen lights and sat down on the floor.  He ignored the paleolythic drawings and focused on the blocks.  They were about three inches square with three or four signs in each one. There were hundreds of blocks.  This was going to take time.
He looked around.  He was still in front of 221B, penned in on all sides, pushed back.  A dash for the kerb.  Cab.  From Baker Street to Molly’s flat.  He was there sooner than he expected.
Sherlock looked up and realized that there weren’t any lights, but the ceiling glowed almost like it was one large LED panel.  But where was the power coming from for it?  He doubted that Richard, Greg or even John were able to hook the ceiling to the dig’s power source, which means there had to have been an independent power source that was still working millennia later.
“What’s going on?  How many times have I come here tonight?”  John glanced around frantically.  Time ticking by slowly.  The hands on the clock the mantle weren’t moving.  Not an echo.
John looked up at Greg.  “If he had a larger vocabulary, it could help us with our work.  And as nice as it is for that show piece to be fully translated, it’s our work here that is the top priority.”
She was stretched out on the couch.  Low lights.  He stood silently across the room.  “Well?” she pouted.
“Here,” she continued, ignoring his question, “meals are a time to come together and be with our colleagues.  It’s a great way to be able to collaborate on our various projects.”
The door clicked shut behind Sherlock as he left the lavatory and made his way back to his seat.  The captain came over the intercom moments later to inform the passengers that the plane was now making their final approach to Esenboğa Airport in Ankara.  Sherlock was thankful when he was finally able to stand up for good.  Airline seats were not designed for people of even average height.  The people were slow to exit the plane.  He couldn’t wait to finally get off.  He had boarded a plane at Heathrow at 6:30 that morning and even though he had almost a ninety minute layover in Istanbul, now seven hours later he was done traveling.
She put her hand on John’s forehead, stopping him.  “That’s enough, sweetie.” She pulled her hips back and knelt down to kiss John passionately.  “Go on,” she whispered.
“Come on,” Greg said and headed out of the cafeteria and back to the dorm.  He led Sherlock down the hall past the conference room.  Sherlock realized that he had been so preoccupied with everything else going on that he hadn’t even explored this building beyond finding the toilets and showers.  He didn’t even know who was staying in each room, other than he figured that the women were not on this floor.  At the end of the hall there was a small room with several computers and printers.  “In here.  I don’t think I need to give you any pointers on how to use these things,” Greg said and promptly left.
“I’m a cuneiformist,” he explained.  “Do you know how many untranslated tablets are sitting in the British Museum alone?”
Sherlock woke himself up with a gasp.  He exhaled slowly before sitting up.  Wide awake.  These dreams.  Why did he keep having them?  He never dreamed like this before, so vivid.
Jim put the tube down and walked over to a cabinet along the wall.  He opened it, and pulled out a block, and dropped it on the table in front of Sherlock.  Sherlock reached out and lifted the top.  It was a book. Only it was made of thin, metal pages instead of paper.  His eyes scanned quickly the logograms that filled the page and he began to quickly flip through them, going through as many of the pages as quickly as possible.  The logograms themselves were not uniform nor always neatly spaced, as though somebody had written them into the metal.
“Come on,” Greg said, turning and heading back inside.  Sherlock followed him and down a narrow, ill-lit hall to a room.  Greg opened the door.  “It’s small,” he said, gesturing into the room, “but it’s better than being in a tent.  I’ll let you get settled in and then I’ll come get you to meet the rest of my team.”  He went back down the hall.
Sherlock got out and went to the rear of the vehicle to grab his bags.  Molly didn’t offer to help this time.  He slung the duffle bag over his shoulder and grabbed the two suitcases.  She was heading into the building and Sherlock tried to hurry to catch up.  Just as he was getting to the door, a man came out.
“John?”  Mary called.  John turned but she was no longer by the toys but over by a rack of lingerie.  John nervously wandered over.  She held up a sheer, red...well, he couldn’t tell what it was.  He wasn’t sure there was enough material to cover anything.  “What do you think?”
Sherlock carefully placed the tablets back on the shelves and hurried after him.  He’d obviously been hired exactly for this sort of work, but they kept moving the goal line on him.  He couldn’t pass up this opportunity though.
Sherlock moaned loudly, lifted his hips up hard and erupted in John’s mouth.  John kept swallowing until Sherlock slumped back into the chair.  He let Sherlock’s softening cock slide from his mouth.
Sherlock spun him around.  He could feel his hot breath on his neck and back as Sherlock’s hand traced his back, down his spine, parting his buttocks.  Coldness, making him shiver, from the slickness that Sherlock pushed into him.  He didn’t stop him.
The razor slid over his face, sliding through each whisker, but every time he ran his hand over his skin, it was still rough.  He shaved, but the blade caught and pulled before.   The razor doing it’s job but not.
Sherlock stared at it.  It was a metal tube with what looked like a grip at one end.  “Clearly it’s some sort of weapon, Richard.  Or should I call you Jim?”
Sherlock let John’s answer roll around in his mind.  A matter of convenience, then. Or...was there some coercion there?  “You should shave that mustache,” he said switching topics.
Sherlock stared at him and then quickly glanced back at the rest.  Nobody else had moved, but they had stopped their singing when John opened the door.  They silently stood watching him.  Sherlock walked through the door into a small room.  The door swung shut behind him.  A plain wooden table with a computer terminal sat in the middle of the dimly lit room.  Sherlock walked over and sat down placing the tubes on the table.  An old-fashioned computer monitor and keyboard.  A most unusual set-up. The glowing green cursor blinked expectantly on the black screen.
Who exactly were these people he was working with?  Greg had introduced them with their areas of expertise, but he didn’t know anything about them professionally.  He’d start at the top.  He had looked up ‘Greg Lestrade’ when he was hired and found his name in various academic journals about digs in Anatolia and Greece.  It was fairly mundane work on bronze age sites, but nothing of note.  Adding in new search terms gleaned from this site didn’t provide additional results.
The door opened.  “We’re going to put on Infinity War,” his housemate said, sticking his head in.  Mike...Stamford, or something like that.  He didn’t really know his housemates that well; he kept to himself when he was home. “You want to join us?”  Mike looked around, craning his neck to see what was on the screen.  “What are you doing in here?”
Standing in front of the door to 221B. Crooked knocker again.  Was he there before?  Why did it seem like he was there before?  Was it all in his head?  Repeating himself.  Or an echo.
Sherlock opened the door and the two of them squeezed into his bedroom.  Before Sherlock could say anything, Molly moved to him and kissed him.  It was sudden, but Sherlock responded, returning the kiss and pulling her against him, instinctively.  His hands slid down to cup her arse and pull her into him.
Sherlock opened his lap top and loaded the browser.  When the password prompt appeared, he carefully typed ‘DemBones’ and he was on-line.  He shut the computer, looking forward to finally being able to make some progress.
By the time the morning sun’s faint rays slipped between the cracks in the corrugated steel walls he realized what was written on the wall.  “Fuck,” he said quietly to himself in amazement.  “Fuck,” he said louder, reviewing his notes. “Fuck, yes!” he yelled.
Sherlock was immediately out of the chair and began to lick Mary and tease John’s ass with his fingers.  John groaned, pushing up into Mary.  The presence of Sherlock was too much for Mary and she began to shudder with her orgasm only moments before John had his.
At the Thames.  His mobile was still ringing.  He was barely aware of the constant sound, just blending into background noise, almost lulling him to sleep.  Drop it in the Thames?  He’d just have to get a new one.  Tempting.
The match ended on the telly Sherlock sat there dumbfounded.  “But, Portsmouth had the better team,” he protested.
Things began to fall into a regular pattern.  Breakfast, wall, lunch, wall, dinner.  At meals he felt as though he were being observed.  He felt a presence throughout the day, but it was more so at meals.  But when he would serendipitously observe the others, they paid scant interest in him.  John would join him for most meals, although they never spoke about anything related to work at the site; mostly John would inquire about former work and translations he had done.  Sherlock was rarely able to ask John about his background, and when he did John would answer tersely and quickly change the topic back to him.  He noted that John rarely sat with Sarah.  An interesting dynamic.  Some sort of romantic interest there, but not a particularly warm one.  Sherlock was glad for the company.  He didn’t say anything but he noticed that John had started growing a mustache.  During the day he slowly worked through the hieroglyphs, cataloging logograms. And every morning we was woken by a horrible dream.
“Stop this,” a female voice said.  Sherlock glanced around, trying to figure out which one it came from.  “It gets us nowhere.  He should at least be of some use.”  Sally.  Practical.  But which one was it.  And who were all these people.
“There’s going to be a roast tonight at five,” a voice said.  Sherlock opened his eyes.  Sarah was standing across the table from him.  “Greg wanted me to tell you.  He expects you there.”  She turned.
“I’ll need to access the internet,” Sherlock said flatly.  “Since nobody bothered to tell me what I would be doing here, I don’t have the right resources with me.”
Sherlock frowned at her.  “I’ve never seen the two of you working together.  He’s with Richard at the sites, and I’ve only ever seen you here inside the buildings.  The two of them have professional...entanglements that you appear to be outside of.   Whatever they’re doing with their portion of the dig, you provide excuses and maintain the facade of his interest being in Achaemenid history.  You’re not John’s assistant; you’re his handler.”
He spied a stream and hurried over to it.  He knelt down and was just about to lift his cupped hands to his mouth when he saw that opposite him was a leopard staring intently at him.
Greg considered what Sherlock said.  “OK.  So where does that get us?  How soon do you think you can get me something? Anything.”
John leaned in, looking over Sherlock’s shoulder, his left hand on his back.  “Hmmm.”  He moved in even closer, his hand slipping down Sherlock’s back, until he was pressed up against him.  Sherlock shuddered slightly in pleasure.  Was this going to be like being with Molly?
Greg looked a little sheepish. “Our...benefactor insisted on you.”  There was an uncomfortable silence before he continued.  “Tomorrow, I want you to see the dig in action.  Get a look around at what we have going on here and settle in.  After that, we’ll talk.  Ok?”
Mary sighed and put the piece of clothing back.  She looked into his eyes.  “If I didn’t want to, I wouldn’t have suggested it.”  She pulled him in close as Sherlock came over to them.  “This is supposed to be fun.  You are always very agreeable to everything we suggest, but you almost never volunteer anything yourself, and certainly nothing particularly daring or adventurous. ”
“We think it’s a location where they would expose bodies for vultures,” she answered a little sullenly.
“I wasn’t authorized to show you this,” Greg said.  “And I’m still not, so I’m taking a risk in order to help John and Richard with their portions of this site.  But, realistically, this is what we need translated.  Are you up for it?”
Greg turned the light off and led Sherlock out of the building.  “I’ll need progress within a week,” he said flatly, as he locked the building.
She got up and left him shivering in the bathtub.  “Yes,” she agreed.  “Do that.  You ARE a doctor, aren’t you?  The last I knew that’s how you introduced yourself.”
“I was told,” Veli growled.  “But I’m still in charge of the lock.”  He held up the key and shook it in front of Sherlock’s face, but made no move to unlock the door.
“Sherlock!” Richard called.  “Come join us.”  Sherlock walked over to the group.  “I was just telling everybody about the amazing logograms you’ve deciphered.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, just wandered around the site, watching them as they did their work.  It was very tedious.  The bones were already exposed and lying on the floor of the pit.  A worker would carefully pick up a bone for Molly to inspect it, and after she looked it over it was bagged.  There were a lot of bones, almost like it was a mass grave site.  The bones themselves looked darker than what he expected.  He was curious about them but thought it might be best not to ask questions of Molly.
He left the building, carefully locking it after him and hurried to the cafeteria.  Greg was eating breakfast with John and Richard.  “It’s Hattic,” he announced to Greg.
She smiled brightly at him.  “Yes.  You must be Sherlock? I’m Molly Hooper.  Greg sent me to pick you up.”
Sherlock was trying to concentrate on fucking Molly, but her talking was interfering.  “Mmm. Can we not?”
Sherlock followed Richard as they headed across the site to the building he had tried to get into the second day.  “Who are you working for?”  Richard asked as they walked.
The cafeteria was already closed for the night.  After dropping off his things in his room, he walked down the hall to the conference room.  The only person in there was Sarah, who was typing on a laptop.  “Excuse me,” Sherlock said, rapping on the door frame.
“Ohhh,” Sherlock moaned as John began to repeatedly thrust into him.  He clung to John with one arm and stroked his own cock with his other hand.  John was entirely focused on fucking.  Suddenly Sherlock’s cock erupted, warm stickiness between the two of them.  John thrust one last hard thrust into him and groaned loudly.
Sherlock spun around.  The sound.  It was...it wasn’t...he couldn’t put his finger on it.  Familiar, but he couldn’t identify it, or where it came from.  He hurried on.
A call to Mary, but looking for him.  He needed a stooge, like a Lestrade or a Hooper, used in each their own special way, but only in that way.  Why did he bother?
Sherlock was already nonchalantly looking around.  The store wasn’t particularly bright, but there was still plenty of light to see the merchandise.  John swallowed hard as Mary steered him over to a wall of dildoes and vibrators.  “These look interesting,” she said.  She let go of John’s arm and took a box off the shelf.  “It’s silicone.  Seven inches is a good size. Should we go with realistic looking? Would you would like to watch me using this? Or would you like to try it?”
John hurried over to the selection of plugs, nervously grabbed one and brought it back, dropping it in the basket, his face beet red.
John turned to plead his case to Mary but discovered that she was no longer in the room.  “Mary?” he called.
A soft knock.  She opened the door.  “You’ve been in here so long,” she said in a matter-of-fact sort of way.
She walked over to the bedstand and took a pair of handcuffs out of the drawer, before walking over to John.  John offered up his wrists and Mary snapped them tightly on.  “You can hold onto your cock, but that’s it.  Now, kneel.”
Standing in front of the door to 221B. Crooked knocker again.  Was he there before?  Why did it seem like he was there before?  Was it all in his head?  Repeating himself.  Or an echo.
“And you’re not.”  Jim replied.  “You can’t kill me.  Hero.  Villain.  What is the difference between the two?  Without me, there is no you.  I have to exist, I always will exist.  I am your antagonist, and I am sooooo good at antagonizing.  I do have to say I wasn’t anticipating your impulsive action in killing me.  You’re much too...calculated.”
Molly didn’t ask him any more questions.  Mile after mile passed.  At times Sherlock felt like he could drift off to sleep, but he was too curious to let himself nod off.  After about two hours they came to a small group of buildings that was practically in the middle of nowhere; a small village could be seen a short distance away.  It was typical brutalist architecture, probably built during some mis-guided government development plan in the 1970s.  “This is our lodging,” Molly said as she drove up to what appeared to be a three storey apartment building.  “It’s got...problems, but it beats tents.” Molly climbed out of the truck.
Jim stopped clapping instantly and the others immediately did as well.  “I do not doubt that but doing so at this point would be so anticlimactic.  You did it once already.  It was an incredible cliffhanger leading into the finale chapter, but now...now it would just be sadistic.”
About fifteen minutes later he walked over to them.  Mary and Sherlock were standing making small talk.  Mary had a basket hooked over her arm filled with various things that the two of them had already selected.  “Positive? No judging?” he asked.
“Insisted,” Sherlock completed his sentence.  “I wasn’t aware of a benefactor.  I thought this dig was sponsored by the BIAA.  Who is the benefactor, then?”
He was back in the corridor.  If he was able to retrace his steps, he’d get to the lift to take him back to the surface, but he didn’t know how Jim had made it work.  Had it returned to the surface?  And if people came looking for them, that’s where they would be coming from...unless there was another entrance.  He had no way of knowing.  A map would be useful. He continued away from the lift, clutching the weapons tightly.
A salmon swimming up river, pulling his arms in tight to push his way through the mass of humans swarming.
Most of the cubbies had ten to twelve tablets in them.  He found one with just three.  If he was right, all of the tablets in one cubby would be related, as though it were one book, so starting with a cubby with only a few would give him a sense of what he was dealing with.  He took the three tablets and lay them on the ground. He sat down in front of them and opened his laptop and pulled out his notes.
Sherlock sat down in the pit and opened his computer.  Surprisingly, the connection which wasn’t that strong in his room was extremely strong here, and he had no issue with connectivity and speed.  He caught up on a few e-mails and settled in to cross-referencing the logograms with other symbols commonly used in Anatolia.  Better, but still this would take a while.
Molly.  She sat astride him as he lay on the ground.  They were naked.  She was grinding against him.  He reached up to stroke her breasts, making her moan a little louder than she already was.
“Did you think what you saw was the only written material? I just said what was in the library was meant for public consumption, which means there is even more material elsewhere.”  Jim tilted his head and looked at Sherlock.  “I’m so disappointed you couldn’t make that logical connection.”
A huge bonfire roared.  Sherlock wandered about the people gathered.  It was the same groups of people that he would see at meals.  He didn’t want to talk to them but he felt compelled to be there.  He was looking for John but he found Richard, who was holding court with several people around him.
“Too bad you have no idea how that works,” Jim said, still somewhat relaxed, “Or I think I might actually be a little scared at this point.”  He pulled a smaller metal tube from his pants pocket.  “But I do, and while this one isn’t as powerful, it does get the job done.  Sadly, this is the end of the job for you, but you don’t get to resign.”
He followed Greg down the hall to a small conference room.  Five people were seated around a conference table.  Molly and Sally sat on one side of the table.  A rather handsome man with dirty blond hair sat at the far end.  He sat serenely, his arms gently folded across his chest.  The short sleeve shirt he was wearing showed off his muscular forearms.  On the other side of the table from Molly and Sally sat another woman.  Blonde as well, but her chair had been slid down close to the end.  Her shoulders were tensed up.  From how close she was sitting to the man at the end of the table, there was clearly some relationship there.
“I do not think that is a good idea,” John hissed, looking back over at Mary.  She was still looking at the dildoes.  “Put it back.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “I’m still working with a very limited vocabulary.  I think if I rushed, I could give you a translation within two weeks.  It would still be very rough.  It’s not like I have a dictionary to work from”
“Come on,” a voice said.  Sherlock looked up and behind him.  Molly stood there with her hand on her hip.  He looked around.  They were the only ones left. “I’ll, uh, I’ll walk you back to your room.”
He closed his eyes and his dream came flooding back.  Everything you know is wrong... What could his mind see that he could not?  And why was there a need for such mundane translations.  John and Richard were practically pushing Greg to show him more.  There had to be even more than what he now had.  They were looking for something more, something bigger than bureaucratic records or technical minutiae.  But what? And they wanted it quickly too.  How could he really translate everything in such little time.
Both John and Sherlock started towards it but Mary grabbed John’s arm.  “No, not you, sweetie.”  Sherlock sat down.  Mary went opened the top drawer of John’s wardrobe and took out two of his ties.  “Arms on the armrests,” she instructed and quickly tied his wrists to the arms.  When she was done, she leaned in and kissed Sherlock, letting her hand drop to his already hard cock and very gently stroking it with her finger tips.  “You don’t do anything until I let you.”  She grinned at him.
Going through customs didn’t take long, but he had to wait patiently before he was able to collect his bags from the carousel.  There were two rolling suitcases and a large duffle bag.  He wasn’t sure if he had packed enough, or maybe he had packed too much.  He had no idea.  Now he just had to find his connection.  He slowly meandered through the crowds and headed towards the doors.
, Sherlock thought.  “Let me ask you then,” he said, stopping.  Greg was forced to stop and he let his arm drop from Sherlock’s shoulders.  “I wasn’t brought here for translations of Akkadian, Pontic, Greek, or even Latin.  What exactly am I doing here?  Because if you can’t...or won’t...tell me, I’m ready to go home.  Now.”
He sighed.  This was a dead end, no great revelation.  He absent-mindedly scrolled to the top of the article.  There was a co-author with John, a ‘Jim Moriarty’.  Sherlock typed that name into Google.
Jim laughed.  “You’re not the first that we’ve had out here.  And though the others didn’t get anywhere near as far as you have, do you think they were permitted to leave?”
“Everything you think is wrong,” the woman said.  “When you know who everybody is, you will know the answer.”
Mary didn’t move away, keeping her hand firmly on John’s head.  She stared down at Sherlock, watching him squirm as John sucked his cock hard.  John was sucking and slurping loudly as it slid almost all the way in with each stroke.
At the end of the week, Greg approached him at breakfast.  “I’m going to need, by the end of the day, a report on your progress.”
John leaned in.  “Think of this is a vacation.  You can have anything you want, and not have to worry about cost or anything.” He leaned back.  “Trust me, Sarah keeps nagging about what I eat here, but as you can tell...” John nodded at his plate.
Sally looked up and nodded at him in acknowledgment.  “Keep going,” she said to the dig team and then climbed out of the pit.  “I imagine you’re talking about Molly.  She can be a bit...intense.”
The cursor blinked agonizingly before the response appeared.  “Who are you” Then again and again, slowly at first and then rapidly, filling the screen.
Sherlock rarely ventured away from the British Isles; his last trip abroad had been after Uni when his parents had encouraged him to go on holiday to America.  He only ended up going because they paid his way.  Otherwise, he would rather have begun his new job almost immediately.  He was quite comfortable teaching his classes and working on a variety of translations in his office.  Traveling this far abroad was quite a change of pace for him.
Sherlock tilted his head slightly.  “And yet you’ve approached me to discuss the matter.  So, I ask again, what do you know about it?”
He turned back to Greg.  “I don’t know why, because I didn’t do a full translation of it, but you have essentially the telling of ‘The Slaying of the Dragon’. And you need to understand that this is a very rough translation of only a small percentage of it.  I don’t have all of the nuances down, and I only have a small portion of the words worked out, but Teshub, Inara, and Hupašiya figure prominently.  And it clearly tells of a conflict between Teshub and The Serpent.  Nobody though it existed, that Hattic was only oral.  But clearly what is here is a script for Hattic.  Or something very similar.”
“Shhh,” she said and rubbed his cock against her clit.  She moaned in pleasure as his head rubbed back and forth against her.  Finally, she leaned back to grab her trousers that she had tossed onto the bed and pulled a condom out of her pocket.  Sherlock was a little embarrassed he hadn’t thought about the need for one; he was too caught up in the moment, and he also hadn’t packed any for the trip.  She rolled it over his shaft and quickly slid onto him, moving her hips gently up and down his cock.
“Oh, mmmmm,” Mary said from the bathroom.  “This is...different.”  She came out wearing a black lace cupless and crotchless teddy, nylons and heels.  In her left hand she held a studded glass dildo, but in her right she held a furry tail that connected to a plug.  She let the tail drop and shashayed over to them, pivoting in a circle as she got to the bed.
Sherlock looked over the tablets in each of his hands.  “I...I...Do you know that people in my profession would kill for an opportunity like this?”
She leaned forward and slid her hand over his cheek.  “You’re rough again.”  It wasn’t a gentle caress, but a firm hand.
He spent most of the day working on the report, carefully writing up his findings, leaving some space for drawing a few of the hieroglyphs. He finished around three and headed outside.  After walking around the site a bit, he saw Greg at Sally’s site.
“I think, at this time, it best that I leave.”  He looked around.  “So, you should move out of my way.  I’m not anxious to use this again, but I will if you leave me no other option.”
“I just thought that I should take my time to get acquainted with them, and not just insert myself into their group.”
At dinner, Sherlock sat the same table he sat at breakfast, barely eating.  He watched the people come in for dinner, but Greg wasn’t among them.  Richard sat down at his table this time.
Sherlock shrugged and put it back and then turned and started to examine clamps.  “These, though.  Definitely.”
It didn’t take long before they were both undressed.  Molly pushed Sherlock back onto the bed and climbed on top of him.
“You don’t have to worry about getting a reputation, since you get to just sit in your office.  If I did something like that, when I applied for a different dig, I’d probably get labeled a ‘troublemaker’ and not get the position, and if I can’t get chosen for a dig...”  She kicked at the ground as they walked.
“Then I guess you can let Veli know that I won’t be going to the site today.  I’ll need to be able to print.”  Sherlock leaned back slightly.
“Really,” Sherlock said, settling next to Richard.  Sherlock had noticed that Sarah had been following him from a distance since he had come to the roast, but now came closer.  Richard put his arm around Sherlock, rubbing his shoulder, staring intently at Sarah.  Sarah lingered before a moment before disappearing.
Mary, smiling, looked down at John. He reached between her legs and gave the tail a light tug.  Mary closed her eyes and moaned softly.  When she opened them, she climbed into the bed with them and said, “Mmmm, Mr. Watson. You can be adventurous when you give it a try.”
She leaned forward so that her breast hung down enough for John to lift his head and lick and suck at the nipple.  Mary moaned, “Mmmmm. You want me, don’t you?  You want to be able to slip you cock into me and fuck me.  I’m your wife after all.  But you can't.”
Mary leaned out from the bathroom door.  “I forgot I  was supposed to be meeting up with Rosie. You don’t want to know what she texted me.”
The cafeteria was in a long one-storey building next to the dorm.  It was about half-full of people by the time he got there.  He saw Molly, Sally, Sarah and Richard sitting at a table, but thought best not to join them.  He found a spot by the wall, where he could sit down with his breakfast: a bowl of porridge and a cup of tea.
Greg’s clothes were rumpled, his typically neat gray hair mussed and his face was red.  “I, um,” Greg started, “I submitted your report, exactly as you wrote it.  I just wanted you to know that I didn’t alter anything.  And then, I spoke with the benefactor, and...you were right.”
“A shower?  Not a soak?  Wouldn’t that have been better?” She had pulled back the curtain slightly, gazed over him.  Her eyes roamed over his body with indifference. His arms at his sides, he wanted to cover himself.  He was very self-conscious oh his pasty, flabby body. “It’s like you wanted a soak, but it never happened.”
“You collaborate with Jim simply to prove your theories right.  You know what it is that Jim is after but you have no interest in his machinations; he’s the conduit to allow you access to the funds necessary for an operation like this.  Sarah is simply there to enable you and give you a buffer between Jim and the benefactor, as much as she might detest Jim.  It’s time I know who the benefactor is.”
“I can do it.  But the larger the sample size I have, the easier it is for me to do it,” Sherlock explained.
Sherlock went to the desk and began to copy all of the notes he had made.  Molly’s questions and demeanor had put him on edge.  Maybe he was being paranoid, but he was positive that he wouldn’t be allowed to leave with drawings of what he had seen.  He wished he had been able to take pictures of the wall because then he would have had proof of the existence of the script, but his drawings would be better than nothing.  Once he was done, he unzipped the lining of his suitcase and put the copied papers, evening them out as much as possible so it wouldn’t draw suspicion in case anybody checked.  Then he began to put his clothes into the bag.
After breakfast he walked over to the building.  Veli was waiting for him, as usual.  “I’m not giving you my phone today,” Sherlock said brightly.  “Nor my laptop.”  He held it up to show it off.
He didn’t get it.  When Molly picked him up, at first she had been friendly, but since then she had been very stand-offish.  Was this just some sort of attempt at consoling him?  A sympathy fuck? If that was where they ended up?  Or did she have any interest in him that she never expressed and since he would be leaving tomorrow wouldn’t have another chance?  Frankly, at this point, he didn’t care which one it was.  She was very attractive and the warmth of her body felt nice in his arms.
John let go of his arm and opened door.  He gave Sherlock a quick kiss.  “This is as far as I can go.  What you need to know is in there.”
The knocking was coming from the door.  But if that’s where the knocking was coming from, why had he been able to hear it long before he came into the room?  And why would somebody be knocking when they could easily just open the door and come in?
Sherlock waited a moment before heading back to his room.  He scanned the books that he had neatly arranged on his chest of drawers.  He didn’t think any of them would be useful.  He picked up a book by Anna Davies on Luwian, but from his brief glimpse at the wall the symbols didn’t appear to be that similar.  He also took his cuneiform dictionary which included proto-cuneiform pictograms.
Molly sat back up and started moving again.  He was hard again instantly.  Sherlock closed his eyes and concentrated; he just wanted to be done with it.  Fortunately for him, it wasn’t long before he groaned, held still and erupted.
Before John could answer, Greg walked back over to the table.  He looked at Sherlock.  “I spoke with Molly and I want you to follow her around today and learn about the site.  She’s working on a section towards the North border of the site.”  He tilted his head at John. “That site isn’t going to excavate itself.”
At breakfast the next day Sherlock sat across from John. “Are you going to stick with Achaemenidian being your speciality?”  John didn’t answer him.  “So, what exactly are you excavating? Why does everybody seem to be doing their own thing here and what’s the press for me to do these translations?  Obviously it’s really a Hittite site, or proto-Hittite at least, but why the secrecy about what’s going on here?”
In the bedroom, he undressed. Sherlock didn’t have to say anything.  He knew it’s what he wanted.  Sherlock was naked as well.  His member was already turgid.  Kissing, rough and hard, he wasn’t in charge.  He reacted.  He accepted.
It wasn’t like with Mary.  Maybe it was.  He just went with it.  Naked bodies rubbing against each other, tongues in each other’s mouths and their hands and fingers everywhere.  He enjoyed it, but didn’t want it to happen, yet he let it, not saying anything.
Sherlock nodded.  “Sure.  I don’t get why I’m here in person.  It would be better if I was back in my office with all of my resources....”
Not acknowledged he headed up the stairs and into the bathroom, starting the water.  Hot, so hot.  Too much for him.  How did she stand it so much.
“Fine,” John said, taking a deep breath.  “If you two really want to go in, then let’s.”  He gestured at the nondescript door.  It had been Sherlock’s idea.  Or Mary’s.  One of theirs, of course.  One of them got it in their heads to go shopping.  The only thing John had been insistent on was the location - far away from Baker Street.
Veli crossed his arms and stared at him.  Sherlock sighed and reached into his trouser pocket and pulled it out.  After making sure it was powered off, he handed it to him.  Only then did Veli turn and unlock the door for Sherlock.  Once Sherlock was inside, Veli closed the door after him.  Sherlock wasn’t sure, but he thought he heard the lock close.
Sherlock followed her and stuck his head out of the door, watching her walk away.  It was too brief of an encounter to get a read on her. On one hand she introduced herself, but she was very distant as well.  He wasn’t sure what her comments meant.  He sighed and went back into his room to continue unpacking his bags.
Sherlock shrugged.  “I'm well aware of what I wrote.  I’m not sure which part you’re taking exception to.  It is entirely accurate.  You asked for a report on my progress.  I have none, because I’m essentially doing the same work I did my second year at Uni, cataloguing logograms.  Anybody could do what I’ve done so far, even you.”
Mobile ringing.  Not answering.  Mobile ringing.  Still not answering.  Mobile ringing.  Mobile ringing. Ringing.  Ringing.  Ringing.  One long, continuous ring.  Not stopping.  No voicemail.  Just ringing.  His steps faster.  Going to...
They spent the rest of the short walk in silence.  When they got to his room, Molly said, “Let’s go in.”
There was no talking.  He placed his hand on the bed, knowing what would come next.  Sherlock pressed his body against him, his muscles taut, his ragged breath was hot on his shoulder as one of his hands spread his buttocks and the other held his cock, probing until it pushed into him, not much resistance, but some.  Sherlock’s hands went to his hips as his cock stretched him open as it slid deep into him.
Sherlock studied him.  If he was here for expertise on Roman and Byzantine archaeology, why would he show any interest in what Greg had showed him?
“Then why am I here?” Sherlock asked.  “I mean, with what I’m being paid I could hardly say no.  But you’re right, I don’t do field work and I have a dozen colleagues that do that I could recommend who would be better suited to any of the eras you’ve mentioned, especially Achaemenidian.”
Greg went on. “I should have given you the password to connect on-line.  It’s ‘DemBones’.  Capital d-e-m-capital b-o-n-e-s.  All one word.”  He chuckled nervously. “Archaeology humor.  Anyway.  I want to apologize for what happened earlier, too.” He turned to leave.
John blushed a deep red and looked around, scanning the store quickly, hoping nobody heard what Mary had said.  That’s when he noticed the only other person in the store was the cashier, and he was flipping through a magazine, almost bored.  “Shhh,” he said, taking it from her and putting it back. “Not so loud.”  He nervously picked up a box with a glass dildo.  It had ridges running around it in a spiral pattern.  “Maybe this?”
John moaned.  He throughly enjoyed how much he had to lie there and let Mary use him.  He looked up, watching her enjoy herself, grinding down on him, and all he really could was lift his hips and she controlled how much he rubbed against her.
John let Mary guide his mouth down to Sherlock’s cock.  He closed his lips around it and began to bob his head up and down rapidly.
The search for ‘John Watson’ gave him results in a completely different direction than what he expected.  There were multiple articles either written by John or quoting him about Atlantis.  The earliest articles he could find weren’t in reputable journals, but rather fringe publications.  Only within the last year did his name appear in more scholarly works.  The early works posited that rather than being the creation of Plato that not only did Atlantis actually exist but it was located in Anatolia far earlier than 400 BCE and it was also significantly more advanced than people suspected.
“That it’s Hattic?” Sherlock mulled it over in his head.  “I’d say 80% positive it’s Hattic.  Or else it’s in their language tree, given it’s very rough similarity to what we know about Hattic from Hittite.”
“The material I found today,” Sally said, “You want me to keep excavating or do you want me to work on the analysis on it?”
She smiled.  “5 o’clock.  Maybe you should ask John then.  Be seeing you.”  She turned and walked away.  Sherlock watcher her leave.  If she wasn’t going to volunteer any information, there was nothing more to be had from her.
“I think you should be the one to tell John that you lost.”  She grinned as she got up off the sofa.  “Oh, John?” she called.
She giggled.  “She can’t tell the difference between me and Sherlock?”  She arched her back seductively.  “I’m pretty sure she knows the difference.”  The robe slipped open, off her shoulder, baring her breasts.
“Yes, on paper,” Mary agreed, “but the Cup isn’t played on paper.  Portsmouth loss.”  She let that sink in.  “The wager?” she finally prompted.
Mary kissed him.  “Take your time.  I’ll be picking something out to wear.”  She went back to looking through the clothes.
“Sherlock Holmes?” a voice called.  He looked around.  There was a very attractive woman in khaki shorts and a t-shirt with her hair pulled back in a pony tail in the crowd of people. She looked quite out of place in central Anatolia.  She waved to him.  He headed over to her.
The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn’t place it.  It was male, but it wasn’t Greg or John.  He ran over and over in his mind what he had just said.  It didn’t make sense.  “Who are you?” he demanded.
“The cafeteria opens at 7 tomorrow morning.  I wouldn’t miss any more meals,” she said and looked back down at her computer.  “And try not to cause a scene.”
“Sherlock Holmes?” he asked, sticking his hand out.  “I’m Greg Lastrade.  Good to see that you made it.”
“I do what I’m told to do,” he said, shrugging.  “I don’t ask questions.”  He unlocked the door for Sherlock and once again, when Sherlock was inside, closed it and locked it.  Sherlock sighed and headed down into the pit.
She walked over to the counter and the clerk rang her out, not batting an eye at everything they got.
When the cafeteria was empty save for two or three others, Sherlock closed his eyes.  He was missing something else.  All of the cubbies he had gone through had contained tablets technical in nature.  He had to have missed something in one of them.  Maybe his translation was still too rough
“Aren’t. You. Coming?”  Insistent. Demanding.  “Or should I tell your wife?  You know what I would tell her.  She wouldn’t like it.”
If Sherlock didn’t know better, he would have thought that he was standing in a modern lab.  It didn’t look that much different from what he saw on the telly at night.  The walls were metal, with cabinets along the walls and tables in the middle of the room.  “There are numerous corridors extending under the entire site, filled with rooms like this.  We still don’t know what happened on the surface, whether their buildings were constructed like this, although I suspect not, given what little has passed down through sources and what remains above us.  Then again, Plato mixed up Atlantis and Santorini and he couldn’t comprehend what Atlantis was truly like since he had no context for it compared to the city-states of his day.”
Mary slipped her hand between her thighs, undid the cuffs and lifted her hips slightly.  John immediately pulled his hands away before Mary settled back down fully on his cock.  She looked back at Sherlock. “I know you got those knots undone the minute John sucked you off,” she said, “so get over here.”
When he was done with breakfast, Sherlock headed to the new building and was greeted by Veli.  “So, you’re here now,” Sherlock said to him.
Sherlock whimpered slightly and started thrusting up into her, trying to take control.  He was so close now and just wanted to finish, but he started to soften as well.  He had wanted to make sure Molly got off too, but everything was crashing down on him and he didn’t care if she thought of him as selfish if he came and stopped.
Cab or walk?  Does it matter?  Was it urgent?  Does THAT matter?  Probably not.  He would be disappointed either way by the time he arrived.  When did he call?  He hadn’t heard the phone ring.  He slipped his phone out of his pocket as he strode down the street.  It wasn’t to his phone, which meant it was to Mary, but why not him?  He considered the possibilities.  None were satisfactory.  Of course, if he were HIM, he’d be able to reason out the logic for this little game that he was playing now, but he wasn’t so he knew that it would escape his reasoning.
“This is what you have to work with,” Greg replied.  “Are you going to do it, or should I get somebody to drive you back to Ankara?”
Sherlock stood on a small hill looking around, shielding his eyes from the harsh sun high overhead.  The landscape was empty.  He had been examining the dig to try and learn what was going on but ended up following a dirt trail away from the site.  Now he couldn’t find it.  He didn’t even see the buildings.  How far away did he walk?  He couldn’t have gone more than half a mile away at his pace.
Sally shrugged.  “It’s not part of my assignment.”  Non-committal.  Either she didn’t know, or she wouldn’t say.
She still didn’t say anything.  Sherlock sighed and tried to settle into his seat.  He looked out at the countryside around him.  Esenboğa Airport was located on the eastern outskirts of Ankara and they were quickly onto empty roads traveling through a hilly region dominated by scrub. The roads themselves were in poor condition.  They were driveable, but between them and what must have been the original shocks on the car, it could be rough at times.  There were few a small towns that they went through, barely larger than a quaint English village, but decidedly much more dilapidated.
The most recent article was about the Antikythera mechanism and how it wasn’t a product of Greek, Roman or even Achaemenid civilisation, but rather a remnant of an earlier advanced society.  It didn’t name it specifically, but if read with his other works he was clearly referring to an Atlantean civilisation. Sherlock sat back and ran his hand through his hair.  How could anybody believe this?
Mary slid forward, copious amounts of liquid dripping from her onto his belly.  She got up and went into the bathroom, picking up her phone along the way.  Sherlock crawled up from between John’s legs and lay with him on the floor as John caught his breath.
There was a knock on the door.  Sherlock looked up from his unpacking, realizing that the door hadn’t closed after he came into the room.  A woman pushed open the door fully.  “You the new guy?”  she asked.
Sherlock decided to just head back to his room and go over his notes some more before the cafeteria opened for dinner.  At dinner, as usual he sat alone.  He was just finishing his meal and standing up to put his tray away when Greg stormed in and made a bee-line for him.
He closed his eyes.  It was over quickly.  Sherlock had his release.  Practically pro forma.  Still no talking.  He quickly got dressed.  “So...” he said, drawing out the word.
John opened his mouth and slowly slid the rubber cock into his mouth, but not all the way at first. He pulled back slowly until just the tip was in his mouth and then plunged forward again, taking it deeper.  He kept going, quickly reaching a quick tempo, but taking it deep into his mouth.  Every time he pushed his head forward, the dildo pushed against Mary causing little moans to escape.
Mary took it and examined it.  “Maybe...” she said.  “It says we can put it in the dishwasher to clean it.  That’s a good idea.”
“These rooms are filled with what we call ‘notebooks’,” Jim said, crossing his arms over his chest.  “But once we have a reliable lexicon and an understanding of the grammar, we’ll be able to sort, index, and translate all of what is here, most of which is still more advanced than our civilisation.”
Greg was about to walk away but he stopped.  “Just do your job.  We all have our responsibilities here, and now since I showed you why you were hired you have yours.  Do your job.  Got it?”
Sherlock moaned loudly, lifted his hips up hard and erupted in John’s mouth.  John kept swallowing until Sherlock slumped back into the chair.  He let Sherlock’s softening cock slide from his mouth.
They came to another building composed of corrugated steel.  Greg fished into his pocket and pulled out a key to unlock the padlock on the door.  They went inside.
Sherlock moaned softly as he felt John press against his crotch.  Even as they kissed they both hurried to undo their trousers and push them down to the floor with their underwear.  John pushed Sherlock back against the bed.  Sherlock felt for John’s hard cock and stroked it.  He pulled away from John’s kiss.  “Wait,” he said.
“It’s a chimera,” the figure behind him said.  Sherlock pivoted and pointed the other rod at him.  The figure gestured and lights flooded the tube.  A massive metallic head, demonic in its visage, stared up at him.
At breakfast, he didn’t have to wait long before Greg came over to him.  “I’ve already spoken with my security team.  Veli will be waiting for you to unlock the building.”
She turned and followed her crew.  Something wasn't right.  Her eyes flickered from side to side too much when she was looking at him.  If they exposed bodies to vultures, this would be a paleolithic site, which means no writing.   And if there was no writing, then why was he here?  Sherlock stood there for a minute, looking around.  He saw Sally with another crew at a site a little distance away to the west.  He looked back at the buildings.  He could see John and Richard walking to another building, but this one temporary-looking, built with corrugated steel walls and roof.
“Have you...” Sherlock started, but didn’t finish, the question hanging out there, but he was unable to fill in the blank.  It was pure ambiguousness.  Echo.
“I’m sorry,” Sally said interrupting him.  “How does this relate to me?  Because unless there’s more to this than just a wall with some writing on it, I have my own portion of the dig to handle.”
He stopped.  He didn’t know.  Where was he going?  Home?  That should be the place, lie down, sleep.   But was it?  No other place to go.
“Hypothetically,” Greg asked, “Given what you have already, how quickly would you be able to get something more than a rough translation?”
Molly stopped moving when Sherlock came.  She sighed and got off of him and quietly got dressed.  She left without saying another word.
The entire building was flooded with bright light.  There was a pit, probably about 8 feet tall, that was neatly divided into ten rows, each about twelve feet long.  Greg went down a set of stairs dug out of the dirt into the closest row.  Sherlock followed.  On either side of him were rough earthen cubbies stacked 6 feet high, and within the cubbies were clay tablets.  Sherlock reached into one and pulled out a tablet.  It was covered with the same sort of logograms that he had been deciphering.  “You told me there weren’t any more,” he accused.
Sherlock waited patiently before finally saying, “I can do this for as long as you like.  All day if necessary.  But, when I see Greg later, I will tell him what transpired here...and then you can deal with that.”
Greg stared at him and then pulled out the last page, flattening out the creases in an exaggerated manner. “‘While this author has begun to extensively catalogue the various logograms, further analysis is impossible due to the dig director not permitting access to remote sources via the internet.’ That’s what you wrote.”  He threw the papers down on the table.
Greg grinned.  “You’ll get used to it.”  He looked around.  “You didn’t sit with everybody I introduced you to last night.”
The shower itself was typical.  Water, soap, shampoo.  When that was done, he gingerly lowered himself and sat down in the tub, letting the droplets from the showerhead dance over his skin.  Over and over.
He didn’t answer immediately, but waited.  How long? “Yes,” he said definitely, and then trailed back, “...but...no?”  Echo.
Sherlock was very thirsty.  He reached for his canteen but it was empty.  He knew he had to hurry.  He continued walking across the open land, deciding to avoid the hills that would allow him to view the landscape but would also make him visible.
He heard a growl.  He tried to look around, but Molly grabbed his head so he couldn’t move it.  He blinked.  She had the head of a leopard.  She snarled, lunging down with her jaws wide.
“It’s definitely different,” Sherlock said softly as he approached the wall. He got close to it, not touching it, but inspecting it carefully.  He turned back to Greg.  “You want me to translate this?”
Mary ran her fingers up the back of John’s head until she griped the hair on top. “Go ahead. Suck him,” she said, pushing John’s head down.
Sherlock lifted his right hand and slowly pointed the rod at each of the six.  The was no movement from them.
“You’re his assistant,” he explained with a hint of annoyance in his voice.  “Well, at a certain level. And Greg introduced you as John's assistant.  But you are not just an ‘assistant’. John has said as much, and from the way you sat close to him when I was introduced to everybody, there is a comfort there of more than just colleagues or simple friends.  Although, I’m not quite sure you are his type.  You know what people are doing here.  So why is John working with Richard?”
He was only able to get through the first tablet before he realized it was soon dinner time. These tablets seemed to be an administrative report, addressed to Inara, about some sort of material that Hupašiya had required.  Whatever the material was, it was needed by Wurunkatte to construct chimaera.   This was a myth he wasn’t familiar with.
“Ah!” Jim shouted, striding forward.  Sherlock kept the rod pointing at him, adjusting his grip slightly.  “We’ve now reached the moment of truth.  Who IS the benefactor?” Jim walked right up to Sherlock letting the rod poke him in the chest.  “Who is this director moving around the characters on this elaborate stage?  You, in your demands, continue your role, deeply immersed in the character.  So rational. It’s so...”  His voice trailed off and he shuddered, gasping slightly.  “But I,” he picked up again, “I, your humble servant, have played my role to perfection, and each other character, including you, have been exquisite in your performances.  Brava!” He raised his hands next to his head and started clapping politely.  “Well done.”  The other robed figures started clapping with him.  Their applause echoed through the chamber.
John let Mary guide his mouth down to Sherlock’s cock.  He closed his lips around it and began to bob his head up and down rapidly.
He ignored Jim’s psychotic ramblings; at least Jim wasn’t trying to attack him. He wouldn’t let Jim distract him now.  “What’s down there?”  Sherlock asked her.  “I’d guess it were a missile silo, only what use would an ancient culture have with that.”
“He’s so very good at it,” Mary said, teasing him.  “Watch him take my dildo deep into his mouth, and, mmmmm, you wish it was your cock.”
Molly stopped in her tracks.  Sherlock nearly ran into her.  She turned on her heel.  “Get to the site and pick up with what we were yesterday,” she told the workers.  She stared hard at Sherlock.
Sherlock followed Greg out of the cafeteria.  They headed towards the building that he had seen John enter on the first day, but instead went around it to another building of corrugated steel that was behind it.  Sherlock didn’t know that this building was even here.  Greg fished his keys out of his pocket and unlocked the door.  “Welcome to the library,” he said as he flicked a switch.
Mary ran her fingers up the back of John’s head until she griped the hair on top. “Go ahead. Suck him,” she said, pushing John’s head down.
“Don’t be daft,” Greg responded, a little annoyed.  “He’ll sit outside the entire time.  He doesn’t care what it is that you’re doing in there.”
Sherlock stirred his porridge slightly. “What am I doing here?  If you’re here because of your background in Achaemenid archaeology, then there’s no need for me. The Hittite languages, sure.  There’s not that many of us who have a working knowledge of Luwian or Akkadian or even the little bit of Hattic that is known.  Later languages?  It’s not my specialty and there are others who would be better at it.”
“You will be here tomorrow,” Greg said as he locked the door to the building.  “Consider this your priority.”
Sherlock looked at the tablet up and down.  He pulled out another one.  “Do you know...” he started, before trailing off.
He sighed.  It was all stupid.  None of it made sense, nothing was consistent.  The logic behind everything was non-existent.  Characters dropped in and out.  And the sex scenes were just forced.  There wasn’t any real reason for them.  He sighed again.
He had noticed that building yesterday when he drove in since it stood out from the rest of the concrete buildings.  He also noticed quite a few burly men patrolling the entire camp.  Each of them carried some sort of submachine gun.  He still wasn’t sure what he was doing here.  This wasn’t what he expected at all.  He was in the middle of nowhere in what in the daylight looked like an armed camp.  He sighed and followed after Molly.
John flopped back onto the floor, his hands still firmly holding his cock, and before he could move Mary settled down onto him.  Only the tip of his cock probed at her, his hands blocking more of his cock from slipping into her.  Mary moaned loudly as she ground against his cock, feeling it hard against her clit and letting the thick head rub slip slightly into her
“You shit!”  Greg reached out to grabbed Sherlock’s shirt, but Sherlock stepped back and Greg missed.
Mary and Sherlock looked at each other and nodded.  Sherlock opened the door and headed in.  Mary gestured to John, who fell in behind Sherlock, and she brought up the rear.  As soon as John stepped through the door and looked around, he nearly bolted back out against, but Mary wouldn’t let him.  She grabbed his left hand, interlacing her fingers with his, and with her right hand held tight to his arm.
“I have to say that your work so far hasn’t been exactly what is really needed.  There is a reason why we refer to that as the library.  It was meant for public consumption, unlike the work down here.”  Richard walked over and leaning down behind a table pulled out a device and placed it on the table.  “Do you know what this is?”
Back in his room, Sherlock sat on his bed before pulling out his laptop.  No internet.  He’d have to talk to Greg about that.  His books would only take him so far, and he didn’t bring that many because of the weight restrictions with flying.  What was he doing here?  If he weren’t so tired he’d try and make sense of it all.  There were too many things said to organize neatly in his head.  He sighed, put away the laptop and turned in for the night.
Richard lunged forward, a dark shadow flashing across his face, planting his hands on the table causing Sherlock to jump back slightly.  “Don’t you DARE challenge ME!  I can...”  He stopped and stood up, smoothing his clothes.  The meanness he had just displayed was gone.  “You are out of your element, Sherlock Holmes.  Do not think that you will find allies here.  You are alone here, to do a job that is pointless, and you will fail.  And for the rest of your life you will be haunted that out there is a script you cannot translate and,” he slowed down for effect, “it was all just a bunch of scribbles.”  He looked smugly at Sherlock before turning and walking away.
“Well, umm, sure, if you want to,” he said, unable to stop picturing Mary in it, or at least trying to picture her as best as he could figure out what it would look like on her.
Curious about who this Jim Moriarty was, he clicked on the ‘Image’ tab in Google. “Fuck,” he said slowly, softly.  It was Richard Brook.
Sherlock pointed the rod in his right hand at him.  He started, “I will not be pushed...”  The man reached behind his head and with a faint clicking sound followed by a soft woosh pulled the helmet forward and off.  Sherlock gasped when he saw Jim’s grinning face.
John blushed, and then said.  “I was hoping to find out how things were going on your end.  Anything you can work out can only help us.”
Sherlock glanced around.  Everybody in the cafeteria was staring at him.  He realized his hands were shaking.  He quickly left the cafeteria and hurried back to his room.  He’d find Greg in the morning.
“That would be telling,” she said and then paused.  Sherlock looked at her expectantly before she continued.  “If you don’t know who the benefactor is, then I shouldn’t tell you who the benefactor is.”
He opened the door to his flat.  Mary was asleep in bed.  He quietly changed and slid in next to her.  Dark room, lying on his back, staring at the ceiling, not sleeping.  He was unsure why he didn’t want to go to sleep, but he fought the urge.  There was nothing in sleep for him.  But nothing in waking either.
Greg stared hard at him.  “I don’t think I need to repeat this, but you were hired to do a job.  Do it.”  He left the room, slamming the door after him.
Richard stared hard at him.  “What have you figured out?  I mean, you’re smart.  I’ve seen the work you’ve done.  Not only the work here but prior translations as well.  If people are stumped, you’re the one they go to.  A consulting cuneiformist, if you will.  You don’t get what we’re doing here, but that’s just because you don’t have the context.”
“I’ll see what I can do,” Greg said, interrupting him, looking a little nervous.  “Get started with what you can.”  He shook his head and walked away.
“See,” Jim gestured at her, “she pushes forward the plot, but that is not what is most pressing.  But you don’t realize it quite yet.  So we shall engage each other in this elaborate pantomime, and by and by all will be revealed.  For the time, I withdraw.”  He bowed low to Sherlock.
Greg moved close to Sherlock.  “Let me introduce my team.  You met Molly already.  She’s a forensic archaeologist.  And next to her is Sally Donovan.  She’s our resident ethnoarchaeologist. John Watson.  His speciality is Achaemenid history.  Next to him is Sarah Sawyer, his assistant.  And then we have Richard Brook.  He’s here for to help with any other Roman and Byzantine artifacts we encounter.”
Sherlock walked next to Molly after leaving the cafeteria.  Four others, three men and a woman, followed a little distance behind carrying tools.  “What am I supposed to be seeing at your site?”
“We have different styles...” John paused, “and goals.”  He clearly had chosen his words deliberately.
Sherlock was surprised at the question, given that Molly had initiated this, and was momentarily distracted.  “Am I sure about this?  Absolutely.”
“I’m going,” he said.  “I don’t care who you call.  Tell them anything you like.”  Back out the door, onto the empty street.  He checked his watch.  Late, very late.  He wasn’t going to find a cab here at this time of night.
John knelt between Sherlock’s legs, looking at him.  Sherlock stared back as he sat in the chair, his cock throbbing.
Sherlock crossed his arms.  “Are you telling me that you are willing to prevent me from doing my job?  Because if that’s the case, you can send me home and I’ll tell my contact-”
Greg shook his head.  “It’s central Anatolia.  At almost any site I can find material from 10,000 BCE to well into the 1500s.  At this site alone, we have excavated artifacts from the Median Empire, the Kingdom of Pontus, the Seleucid Empire and the Ottoman Empire.  I know you don’t do field work, and I’ll be honest, your name didn’t come up when we were brainstorming who we could bring in to assist us with some translating.”
Sherlock lunged forward and grabbed the tube by the grip and pointed the other end at Jim.  “Beam weapons.  That’s what you have.  They incinerate the bodies, leaving only charred bones.”
He actually wasn’t intending to go to 221B, despite the beck and call, but as though pulled by some unseen force he ended up there anyway.  Crooked knocker again.  He didn’t care, but were he to straighten it, it would drive him mad.  It wasn’t just his brother who would passive aggressively get on his nerves; he was as guilty of it as well.  Not that he wanted to be considered in the same breath as that sniveling, bloated, gas bag of questionable moral standards.
Greg whipped his head around and glared at John.  “I’m not so sure.  It’s not what I was told to do.”
It was then that six robed figures emerged from the corridors into the room.  Each person had on a white hooded robe.  They were followed by a dozen more behind each of them also in hooded robes.  Sherlock carefully adjusted his grip on the weapons, raising them about waist high, waiting, anticipating.  He spun quickly, trying to keep an eye on each of them.  “I would advise each of you,” he called out loudly, his voice echoing around the sparse chamber, “that unfortunately I had no choice but to use a device to eliminate Richard Brook, or Jim Moriarty, if you knew him by that name.”
Greg stared at him for a minute and then sighed.  “Fine.  You want to see why you were hired?  Come on.” He turned and led Sherlock back towards the building that they were just at, but instead of going in there, led him around past it.  Greg was walking at a fast pace.  Sherlock wasn’t used to moving so quickly and struggled to keep up.
The door clicked shut behind Sherlock as he left the lavatory and made his way back to his seat.  The captain came over the intercom moments later to inform the passengers that the plane was now making their final approach to Esenboğa Airport in Ankara.  Sherlock was thankful when he was finally able to stand up for good.  Airline seats were not designed for people of even average height.  The people were slow to exit the plane.  He couldn’t wait to finally get off.  He had boarded a plane at Heathrow at 6:30 that morning and even though he had almost a ninety minute layover in Istanbul, now seven hours later he was done traveling.
John shivered in his coat as the cold November wind whipped through the streets.  He wished he had brought a hat, primarily for warmth.  “It was your idea.  Well, one of you.  Maybe you both conspired together.  It doesn’t matter.  And now I’m getting cold, so either let’s get this over with, or head back to the Tube.”
Sherlock remained silent as they descended down a long metal shaft.  The elevator came to a stop in a long, rock-hewn corridor buttressed by metal ribs.  Richard started walking down the corridor passing by several metal doors.
Sherlock awkwardly shook his hand, again keeping the duffle bag from sliding off of his shoulder. “It’s a pleasure,” he said.
“What’s there to know?  It’s just a cutesy geometric design with some paleolithic drawings tossed in.”  He leaned forward and lowered his voice, practically growling.  “Personally, I think it’s a waste, a waste that they brought you all the way here from merry ol’ England.”
Sherlock gasped, lifting his hips off the chair.  He wished that he could grab John’s head but his wrists were still tied to the arms.  He groaned loudly.
He walked back outside.  He didn’t see where Greg had gone earlier and wasn’t sure where he could even find him.  He spotted Sally’s portion of the dig and headed over.  The pit was larger than the one Molly had been working in.  There were several short walls running perpendicular to each other.
“Greg said you were a linguist.”  She leaned against the door frame, watching him as he pulled out his clothes and put them away.
Sherlock had just gone back to eating his porridge when John sat down across from him.  Sherlock smiled at him.  “Good morning.  John, was it?”
Sherlock swallowed.  “Your mistake is that you handed me a manual for one of your weapons.  It’s a different device but there was enough similarity between what I hold in my hands and what the book describes.  And I can actually read...enough...of what it was you handed me.  At least the important parts.”  Sherlock carefully applied pressure with his fingers and palm and thought about the energy flowing from him and into the rube.  A bright light shot out of the end of the tube and struck Jim.
He could hear a lively discussion as he headed over, but as he approached closer, they fell silent.  “All set to go,” Sherlock said as he approached Greg and handed him his report, who was standing on the edge of the pit looking down at Sally and her crew.  He smiled down at Sally but she just stared back at him.
“I’ll show you,” Sherlock said as he led John into his room.  He opened his laptop and showed him a picture of the last tablet he had been working on.  “It’s just a request for material of a certain quantity, but I can’t figure out what the material is, and while I sort of have it worked out that they want to construct chimaera, I just don’t know what that means, but that was the closest I could get using the available lexicon I have.”
Article after article appeared about Atlantis, and in particular there seemed to be a focus on the power of Atlantis, militarily, and the weapons that Atlantis had at their disposal, including an article on a compact beam weapon that ultimately found its way into the hands of the Israelites which allowed them to conquer Canaan. “The Ark?” Sherlock asked himself incredulously.  “Did he watch one too many Indiana Jones movies?”
Sherlock stared at him. “I lost,” Sherlock said through gritted teeth. “I should say, we lost.  The bet, that is.”
Sherlock blinked awake.  This was a more pleasant way to wake than the nightmares he had had every night.  He looked at his clock.  It was 5 in the morning, but he didn’t feel tired.  He got up and opened his laptop.
There was a knock on the door.  “Come in,” Sherlock called, although not really wanting anybody in his room right now.
Sherlock nodded, sad that unfortunately his suspicion had proved right, despite how enjoyable it had been.
Mary leaned down and kissed Sherlock on the lips before turning to John.  “It’s time for my fun.  Get on your back.”
Too many corridors as well.  They turned and bent at odd angles, none of the floors level so he was constantly going up and down.  As much as he tried, he could feel himself becoming disoriented.
“Don’t worry about it,” he said.  “The Discovery isn’t exactly the pinnacle of luxury, and this one is nearly 20 years old.  The flight wasn’t bad, but this was only the third time I had been on an airplane, so I don’t really have anything to judge it by.”
John knelt between Sherlock’s legs, looking at him.  Sherlock stared back as he sat in the chair, his cock throbbing.
“You just don’t get...”  Jim picked up the device and examined it briefly.  “I’m going to guess that if I handed this to you, you wouldn’t know how to work it.  And that was the problem at first, although we’ve had some success with it simply through trial and error.  Most of what we’ve accomplished has been through that.  But I’ve seen your translations, and they will help with the notebooks we have down here.”
Sherlock gasped and sat up, panting.  He was alone in his room.  He glanced at his wrist.  It was almost seven.  He flopped back onto his pillow, still breathing heavily. He rubbed his face and decided he might as well get up.
There was somebody behind him.  He turned around.  A woman in long flowing robes stood before him. “Who...?”  he asked.
He hurried over to the cabinet and started pulling books out, quickly flipping them open and scanning the first few pages.  None of them appeared to be about the weapon he had or the weapon Jim had.  He went back to the bones, crouched down and pushed them aside.  The weapon was still there.  He grabbed it and headed out the door.
Sherlock looked at him calmly.  “What you expect me to do, within what I’m assuming is a small amount of time, is something that cannot be done.  I told you I had a very rough translation of the ‘The Slaying of the Dragon’ and it is a very rough translation because it is using logograms that are unique to any catalogued writing system.  And the problem is that I’m assuming that certain logograms are translated a certain way.  Given a larger vocabulary, I will be able to refine the translation, to be more accurate, but in order to be more accurate, it will take time to slowly refine the translation.”  He held up the two tablets in his hand.  “There are approximately 48 blocks on each side of these and,” he gestured at the cubbies, “I can’t imagine how many tablets there are here, and I can’t imagine they’re all well-known Hittite myths.”
The figure reached behind his head pulled off his mask.  “What makes you think I can give you what you want?” John asked.
