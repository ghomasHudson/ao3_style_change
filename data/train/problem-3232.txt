I scream at the top of my lungs! I momentarily have forgotten that one, I am in the gym that echoes, and two, people can hear me loud and clear.
I sneak a glance at Destiel to see if she catches the looks our parents have made. No. Destiel actually looks distracted. I raise my eyebrows.
Aunt Eileen smiles and signs, “That’s great! That is the key, Sage. If a guy or a woman signs, you don’t have to worry about the communication barrier! What does he look like? Is he from around here?”
She narrows her eyes at Sage and then looks at me for an explanation. She also catches my pie and gives me a questioning look.
Eileen remembered the very day she discovered that she was pregnant, out of nowhere. The last person she loved was Samuel “Sam” Winchester. But he didn’t know I was alive and that hurts me like a motherfucker but I got over it.
Before Sage could speak, this guy signs out of nowhere, “Oh, I’m sorry. I am a bit rusty with my signing. Are you ok?”
Aunt Eileen makes the bitchiest face she ever did and sign, “Har har. Excuse me for being a hunter at the moment. This does not happen for a long while but that does not mean I lost my guard. In the meantime, are either one of you going to tell me what the fuck just happened?”
I roll my eyes because it is obvious. The conversation we are having, this is not what many families would discuss, at all.
Cas signs, “The truth. I have never wanted Destiel to lie and I am not about to start pulling lies to her. She will kick my ass, as you know. She hates lying. We both know that. She can easily figure things out, Eileen.”
I sign, “Woo fucking hoo. He is a hero and all. But seriously, dad. How the hell do we get to fight for ourselves then? Like I have been saying to you and Aunt Eileen a fucking hundred times, Sage and I need to learn how to defend ourselves. AND LOOK AT US NOW. We are goddamn prey, wandering around, clueless like we are asking them to attack us.”
Sage and I glance at each other. I response before she could make up a lie. Sage takes forever to think up a lie.
I walk into the kitchen to see Aunt Eileen and Sage setting up food to put in the dining room. I ask if I need to do anything to help. They both shake their heads because everything is ready in the dining room. I grin and wash my hands.
I smile again and sign, “Sam was a wonderful man. He was so kind and very patient. He was also very brilliant. Not to mention that he was loyal as well. He cares about his family a lot. I will always remember him.”
I gaze down the street, watching people get ready for the weekend. I mean, weekends are the best. We can do what we want to do and that means FUN is included!
Cas snorts with confidence, "She will punch Dean right in the face. Probably a few times. That kid has never been more violent toward anyone else than Dean. I can feel her emotions when the name, Dean, pops up."
Aunt Eileen smiles big and signs, “I am glad you are doing something you enjoy. I have not seen you this excited in a long time.”
So this is the real Sam Winchester. Sage JUST met her father and I just met my uncle. How do I know? Because he just asked that one question that no living ever needs to ask.
The bed jolts as if the earthquake is trying to rescue me from perpetuating facing that strange man. Before one eye gets to open---
I wish he is my dad instead. That would make me feel so much better. But at the same time, I don’t because if Sam is my dad instead then I would not exist. Dean Winchester took Castiel Novak for granted and I am here to show Dad Novak that I am not like Dean Winchester.
, trench coat fanned behind him as he crouches to put two fingers on Sam's forehead. Dean's hand darts out to grip Cas's shoulder without thought, tugging his friend around to look at him. Dean’s not even sure what he means to say, but whatever it is the words die in his throat as their gazes meet.
The Zanna looks between them, brows drawn together thoughtfully. “Don’t worry honey, I don’t share stories that aren’t mine to tell,” she tells Dean in a surprisingly soft tone. “But I think it would help you to tell him someday. You’ll think about it, right?”
immediately begins to play from beneath the bed and Dean chucks his phone across the room in frustration. “Damn it, Cas,” he growls.
“Sully’s busy,” Sam says. He’s vibrating with tension, shoving a hand through his hair again and again as if the strands will magically give him answers. “I don’t know what kind of Zanna emergency could be more important than endangered children. I thought the kids were the most important thing to them, you know? Whatever it is, it’s got him all tied up.”
“You aren’t asking, I’m offering,” Dean interrupts. He ignores everything else. He hasn’t been on a real honest-to-God date in over a year, and somehow he hasn’t missed it. It’s way more fun to hang out on the couch with Cas than it is to make awkward conversation with strangers at a bar. “Just think about it, okay?”
Dean shivers, clutching at his shoulders. Something heavy falls over him almost immediately, cocooning him in warmth and the scent of mountain air. He makes a contented sound and starts to relax. Sam’s there, so he’ll be fine. Dean just needs a real nap to gather his strength before he has to face the world alone.
Dean allows himself a small smile of appreciation, but then remembers why he can’t...feel. Not here, not with Muller’s eyes on him, and certainly not with their last conversation bubbling dangerously near the surface of his memories. He looks away, jaw tight, and pretends he doesn't see when Cas's face goes stiff and blank.
“Yeah, start of term ain’t exactly my favorite time either, but you don’t usually take it this badly, buddy.”
“This is different,” Deann snaps. “Sully knew you just needed to get out, and he was right. My shit was...complicated. Big stuff, not hunting, and I was so confused. She wouldn’t leave it the hell alone. She harped on and on about ‘we are who we are’ and Dad doesn’t have the right to take that away from me. And—”
Cas’s hands are all over him now, moving, exploring, gentle but inexorable, leaving streaks of heat and chill in their wake by turns. Fingers ghost over his face, brush his lips, trace his nose and brows and jaw. Dean’s eyes flutter shut and Cas even runs his fingers lightly over his eyelashes.
It’s a good thing he doesn’t expect his complaint to be acknowledged, because it isn’t. Soon enough they’re pulling up to 117 Arbor Street. It’s a tidy ranch-style house in a cute suburb: flowers in the front yard, basketball hoop nailed above the garage, tell-tale glow of a TV screen through the curtains, the whole nine yards.
On the page, two buff men are lip-locked against a classic car. One is wearing a fluffy halo, the other a cowboy hat. Castiel chooses to skip over the details. “That’s...Dean’s?”
He’s utterly unsurprised when Sam walks in a few minutes later, heaven doing its handy time trick to keep the lovers together. They laugh and drink and talk for hours, and Dean heads home after with a spring to his step.
“Never freaking do that again,” he snarls as Sam pushes himself up on his elbows. Anger is the only thing he dares to let through; anything else and he might crack and break, reduced to useless emotional ash.
It’s hell on Earth, everything they've given their lives to avoid. They fought Heaven and Hell and Leviathan and everything in between, lost friends and family, their futures, their sanity, their freedom. Every sacrifice they’ve ever made, every battle fought and won, all the pain and fear and death and sleepless nights, it all led to this point.
“Forget it,” Dean snaps, “Let’s go see what razzle-dazzled fresh hell is waiting to show us the stairway to heaven this time.”
“Too much of a scared jackass to try,” Dean says between light kisses to soft skin, his nose nudging the shirt upward. “I can’t face this fight without you, Cas. Better to die wanting what I can’t have than lose what I’ve already got, so I just...kept on.”
The silence stretches, pregnant with some impending doom that he wishes he hadn’t disturbed. If he’d kept his fat mouth shut, maybe their pleasant little bubble could have continued forever, but no he just had to go poking around into trouble.
The angel retreats thoughtfully. “It was definitely spellwork,” he says, “But I’m not sure what it’s meant to accomplish.”
“What the hell! Wait, is that why...” Dean rubs his forehead with two fingers, eyes rolling up in brief exasperation. “You thought I was with Lisa in that dream, and I was upset you took me away from her?”
Dean’s not quite sure what happens next; whether he moves first, or Cas does. What he does know is that one second he’s sitting there, his heart out for Cas to smash, and the next his arms are wrapped around solid shoulders, there’s a hand curved around his ass almost possessively, and there’s another cupping his jaw. Better yet, ice blue eyes are studying his face like he’s the only thing on the menu, and Dean is more than happy to deliver.
Two fey stand to either side of the entry. If they’d seemed out of place in the crystal cave, they seem positively uncomfortable here. They’re a blur of sparks and static in the sun, bits of them spitting and hissing as they fade in and out of existence.
Violet presses her lips together and looks at her hands where they rest palms-down on her knees. Castiel reaches out and Dean’s eyes follow as the angel gently touches her forearm. “Where was he, Violet?”
A spell envelops them; Castiel can feel it pulling at his vessel and his grace. He reaches for a knife he doesn’t have. “Witch,” he snaps.
Cas pretends to push him away, then gives in with a chuckle when Dean catches him by the belt loops and pulls them back together. His returning caress is fire to Dean’s smoldering ash, a bright invitation that Dean has never been able to refuse. He’s suddenly hungry for more, burning for it to the point it’s easy to forget they’re in the front yard in full view of the entire freaking world. He loves. He
“If you had seen my true form before—” Cas cuts himself off, gently pushing Dean’s hand away from his face. “If you knew me in my natural state you wouldn’t think so.” He’s got that weird half smile he uses sometimes when he thinks Dean won’t notice that his feelings are on his sleeve, and Dean’s heart does a painful double-tap in his chest at the thought.
a first, the first time anyone’s called his name at all, let alone in that tone of devotion and need, and Dean squeezes his eyes shut against the wall of emotions that want to take over at the realization.
Dean expects to see his bedroom ceiling when he opens his eyes, but instead he gets an umbrella of green leaves against a clear blue sky. He can hear birds calling in every direction and water trickling some ways away, but otherwise, it’s eerily silent. Even the distant rush of cars or airplanes is conspicuously absent.
His fear and shame escapes in tears, salt trails burning down his cheeks. Cas wipes them away, kisses the corners of his eyes, murmurs a soft benediction to the crows feet that have taken permanent residence there.  He’s gentle, overwhelmingly so, every touch bearing the weight of outright worship. It’s hard to believe a being that can lift anvils and break fists with his face can be so soft...but then again, behind every touch there’s a hint of thunder, so perhaps it isn’t such a stretch after all.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says. It’s uncertain, a little wobbly, as if Cas himself can’t believe he’s saying it, but that’s all it takes for Dean to jump off the porch, to cross the space between them, to grab Cas by the front of his stupid
He wishes he could feel that anger right now, could find the drive to keep going that he’d had back then, but there’s just nothing left. He’s running on empty, alone in his mind. At night he sits on his bed with a bottle of Jack and pushes his fists against his chest, harder and harder until he can hardly breathe.
Dean’s expecting a hug or a peck on the cheek, so when Cas grabs him by the waist and shoulder and reels him in for the full mouth-to-mouth experience, his soul practically leaves his body. He’s not prepared for his thoughts to start spinning in lazy circles as soon as their lips meet, or for every muscle in his body to turn to jelly, or for heat to flare up in distracting waves everywhere they touch.
“I thought Zanna helped children,” Castiel comments, unable to keep his puzzled curiosity to himself anymore, “But you’re,” he waves at her wordlessly, then changes what he’d been about to say, “I would not expect a child to imagine
His phone is still beeping. Dean fumbles for it, staring bleary-eyed at the display that tells him his alarm has been going off for a solid ten minutes. He jabs the “dismiss” button and lets the damn thing fall off the bed completely.
things. Things he would never understand, you know? And I can’t, I just can’t. It’s too late for me.”
They remove each other’s clothes with gentle, slow gestures and reverent touch. They kiss again, this time peaceful and seeking and unhurried. Their bodies meet skin to skin for the first time, and Dean closes his eyes as a shiver travels from head to toe. He’ll never forget this moment, he’s sure. Never.
Eileen’s laughter rings through the open door, followed by a deep chuckle. Sam flinches, his fingers rubbing at his wedding ring as if for comfort.
“Anything. Fucking anything,” Dean gasps, and maybe he should think about that a little more, but this is Cas, this is an
“Fuck you,” Dean says, ever the diplomat in the face of peril. “I want Cas.” There’s a rustle, or perhaps it’s more like static; every hair on his body stands on end.
In the panting, gasping aftermath, Cas’s hand slides down Dean’s body and wraps around his cock. He pumps at an uneven pace, with a grip a little looser than Dean normally likes, but even so it doesn’t take long before it’s Dean’s turn to cry Cas’s name, white striping his quilt as he comes, and comes, and fucking
Grass grows sparse, poking up in tufts through stretches of broken stone and around rocks that shoot up from the ground, then sheer off at odd angles like broken glass
Cas squeezes his eyes shut. “Beyond the confines of this one perfect day you live in, your human body is wasting away. In the real world you have maybe an hour before the djinn poison destroys your brain. In here, it will feel like a few days, maybe, before things stop making sense and you succumb entirely.”
Dean forgets all about getting himself off in favor of the promise of that question. He reaches for the bed stand and gets the bottle out of the drawer, then pulls a strip of condoms out as well for good measure.
“What can you do to help?” Dean looks at Cas and their eyes lock. There’s suspicion in that expanse of blue, even if his words are steady and accepting.
Bobby is comfortably congratulatory when they visit that weekend, and Dean wonders exactly how many people in his life have assumed he’s dating Cas in secret. To his disgruntled surprise, Bobby agrees to officiate, but only if they have a real wedding. “Don’t make me knock yer heads together,” he tells them when they protest. “It don’t have to be a big to do, but you should at least invite your brother.”
Once things feel a little more manageable, he nods the go ahead and Cas pulls back and starts to thrust—though it isn’t until Dean twists around and snaps “Fuck me like you mean it!” that Cas really lets go and gives Dean the pounding he’d been hoping for. Somewhere along the way Dean shifts his knees a little and suddenly every thrust is sliding right over his prostate, nerves already hyper-sensitive from Cas’s fingers earlier.
Dean tilts his head upward as he blinks himself away. “G’morning sweetheart,” he grumbles in a sleep-roughened voice. “Thought I’d kick you out, didn’t you.”
Something warm and overwhelming blossoms in Dean’s chest, pressing outward until his entire body is tingling. His hands twitch, wanting something to hold on to as he jumps into the unknown. “The only bad part about last night was waking up alone this morning.” He tries for casual and misses by an entire continent; his voice cracks mid sentence and his cheeks flush with embarrassment.
When Cas neither moves closer nor responds to his comment, Dean reluctantly drops his hands to his sides and lowers his chin to look at his friend.
As Sam watches the angel write yet another new label, clarity strikes like lightning to a church tower:
Cas doesn’t stir until the sky is silver-pale to the east and the air is clammy with dew. Dean is stiff and shivering, but waves good morning nonetheless.
He almost adds that soulmates are usually some straight-up romance bullshit so clearly he and Cas can’t be that, but something stops him short.
When Dean wakes the next morning his mouth tastes like a dead animal and his head is quick to inform him he’s probably still drunk. He reaches for his phone and blinks sleep out of his eyes enough to see it isn’t even seven. “Fuck,” he grumbles, tossing the gadget to the side.  Memories of the night before slam back into focus as he rolls over and his entire body flushes hot at the thought. He reaches for Cas and the heat is quickly pushed away by dread when he finds only cold, empty sheets.
, and ain’t that just a trip? He imagines Cas’s face as it must be at that moment, slack-jawed and glassy-eyed with pleasure, and that gets Dean so close he actually whimpers.
“Okay I can get being angry or something, but afraid?” Dean frowns, his sluggish brain refusing to make sense of the situation. “You don’t seriously think I would-”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” he chants, casting about in his mind for something, anything, to distract him. “
They make it to solid ground at the bottom of the waterfall without further incident, though Cas moves slower than Dean’s ever known him to, and seems near to collapsing by the time they step away from the stones and look around. The sun dropped below the edge of the hill while they climbed and the deepening shadows make it clear they won’t make it to the town before nightfall.
Dean snorts. “That sounds very altruistic. What do you get out of the deal?” He’s heard this ‘it’s for their own good’ story too many times before; he’s getting tired of the faded repeats.
, though there is the occasionally “like that, yes, yes” that stokes the fire inside him even higher.
. He can feel it every time Cas touches him, every time he says “of course,” every time he puts himself between Dean and danger without a second thought.
He thinks back over the years since they met, thinks of every time he’s realized he cares about the son of a bitch despite all reason or odds. He thinks about the first time he realized he not only cares about Cas, he
To his surprise the kiss is as easy and real as every other part of their friendship, and that’s not as strange as he expects it to be. Scruff snags his lips as he pulls away and heat and confusion shoot straight to his toes. “Thank you, sweetheart, it’s beautiful,” he says. If it comes out a little breathy, well. Blame that on having to play it up for the clerk.
Cas watches him with both immense love and a pragmatic, albeit painful, awareness that his human might very well decide yesterday evening didn’t happen. If that is the case, trying to force the matter will cause more problems than it would solve, but he’s not sure he can handle being pushed away again.
Dean had said. It had been almost too real, that dream, stirring up hope Castiel had nearly squashed...but Dean had called it a nightmare.
“I need—want—you to know something important. Something I should’ve told you a long time ago.” He pauses to take a breath, to swallow the shaky feeling in his stomach, “I love you, too. You deserved to be happy,” his voice hitches with a dry sob on ‘deserve’ and breaks altogether on ‘happy,’ “You deserve so much better than this. I’m gonna—gonna get you out of there. Somehow. I swear.”
. That has been the foundation of Castiel’s existence for years, the unquestioned reality that guides his every move. That ironclad truth seems less certain now, but the spark of hope in his chest is dangerous beyond measure. What if it’s still, somehow, a misunderstanding?
No valid reason to shoot the witch comes to light before she answers the door, so Dean slinks in after Sam, practically shoulder-checking Cas out of the way as they enter the house. Cas huffs irritably and Dean jerks his chin up, expecting some smartass comment that never arrives.
“Yes, we’re on our way,” his companion says. “No, we’re not- Christ, no! Mind your own damn business.” His cheeks are burning red, and Dean can only imagine what prompted that reaction. “Good-bye, Meg.” Cas puts his phone away with a muttered, “that woman is an unholy terror,” that has Dean cackling as he heads for the shower.
“Such a strange, contradictory creature,” the original speaker says, and then its long fingers touch Dean’s forehead in a flash of white.
“They say this is for you,” Miriam explains. “They say it’s the last step to heal the fracture, if that makes sense to you. They won’t let any of us near.”
Dean had been so focused on Cas that he hadn’t even noticed what was going on behind him. The space was
“I summoned the Empty to get rid of Chuck once and for all.” Cas said abruptly. Okay, looks like he was tackling the serious questions first. “It was a necessary sacrifice—“
It was supposed to be a cut and dry vampire hunt, just a week after their last one. Cas was with them this time since they figured the killings had been done by a nest. The more the better, and Dean didn’t really want to spend another three days away from him again. Sam was terrible company sometimes.
“Yes.” God, Dean would never get tired of that smile. “I like watching the sunrise up here. It’s beautiful.”
Every once in awhile when his eyes drifted shut of their own accord, Cas would rap him sharply against the cheek to jolt him awake.
nearly had him at full mast on the spot. He let out a desperate noise, twelve years of holding back manifesting in sheer need, and started rolling his hips.
What did it matter what Jack wore? Dean was never bothered by cross-dressers or drag queens he had seen over his life. Hell, he had wore
well, or Sam grinning and clapping him on the shoulder in congratulations. He didn’t want to hear Cas talk about June in general.
He nearly brained himself on the hood jerking his head up. They hadn’t spoke much beyond the usual morning greetings, but the few days that had passed had been enough for them to move past their big talk in the garage.
“Figure out what grub y’all want?” She asked brightly. Her voice annoyed him. Sam ordered a salad (figures) and Dean ordered the diner’s classic hamburger and cheese fries.
“We’re supposed to go grocery shopping today.” Cas reminded him. “Sam gave me the list and says, I quote,
“No, I’ll be fine.” Cas replied without answering the first question. Dean glanced at Sam, who wasn’t paying the slightest attention. He tried again.
whatever her name was.” Dean flapped a hand dismissively before returning it right back to Cas’ cheek like a magnet. “Y’kept leaving all the time after the diner and since she gave you here number, I…I thought you were…”
“I bought Bobby’s place. Gonna fix it up.” Dean mumbled, avoiding the piercing gaze that never left his face.
“I thought I might go for a walk. There’s a field of wildflowers only a mile or so from here, and I wanted to watch the bees. What about you?”
“When are you not going to greet me like that?” Eileen’s amused voice, tinny from the speakers, replied. Dean grinned when Sam flushed.
“I’m sorry about them.” He murmured, stroking his thumb across Cas’ hand. “I know it doesn’t make it any better, but—“
Before he could talk himself out of it, Dean pressed his lips quick to the top of Jack’s dirt blonde head, feeling the kid’s smile grow wider. When they finally broke apart, Cas was looking at him with a soft expression on his face. His eyes were shining with something that looked like gratitude and pride and…something else.
Dean almost physically shook his head to shake away the odd thoughts. Why did he care again? He didn’t, that’s why. It was just him adjusting to Cas’ new style after twelve-some-odd years of his holy tax accountant getup.
Dean hadn’t even realized he started thinking about it until he was twenty minutes into Dr. Sexy MD and not listening to a word of it.
. The joy I felt in telling Chuck my happiness,” Dean glanced over to see Cas’ eyes had closed, a small smile playing on his lips like he was reliving a wonderful memory. “—paired with the satisfaction that it was the ultimate rebellion against his story, it was unlike anything I’d ever felt before.”
“Ah.” Cas said, and then didn’t say anything else. He just ducked behind his menu. Dean caught Sam’s eye, who grinned and shook his head in amusement. Surely Cas didn’t have a thing for the waitress too? He could only hope his best friend had better taste than Miss. Pep In My Step.
Next to Jack and across from Cas, Dean felt his entire body go rigid. He clutched his fork in his hand, feeling the metal bite into his skin.
He clamped his mouth shut before the words could spill out. It was too vulnerable, too close to that
the car, Cas.” He told him, although his lips were tugging up and there was no seriousness in his voice.
That should have made him feel better that Cas wasn’t doing some stupid shit behind his back like he’d done in the past, but if he wasn’t, that meant Dean’s first assumption was correct. Cas was seeing the waitress. Yes, dating was harmless and it sure as hell was probably making him happy, but it made Dean feel absolutely miserable.
At first, it was just a dry press of lips, still awesome in its own right, and Cas let out this broken little sound in the back of his throat, his fingers clutching Dean’s so hard it was like he were afraid he’d disappear. Both of them seemed frozen in place, shocked that neither one of them were yanking away.
“The apple and peach work together to provide shade.” Cas explained, pointing down to the ring of seedling boxes around the base of the tree. “As the plants grow older, I move them further away from the trees so they can flourish on their own. I’ve got avocado, lemon, lime, and orange trees dispersed around to provide shade on extra hot days.”
“Cas can run errands by himself, Dean.” Was all Sam replied with, only half listening and his eyes glued on a book.
Sam was gunning it like a madman despite always pestering Dean to follow the speed limit. Cas’ free hand was gently carding through Dean’s hair, something that felt very nice, he decided.
. Instead of the usual cold drop in his stomach and wave of self loathing, his blood immediately began to boil. He glared at the empty space where Cas parked his truck, almost slamming Baby’s trunk on Sam’s fingers.
Downstairs, Dean had recreated Bobby’s panic room and the rest of the space had been fleshed out for Cas’ gardening tools and work area. Outside, the open-air garage connected back into the house and opened to the scrapyard and wild grass fields. The wrap around porch was completed with two rocking chairs and a table between them.
Dean felt himself immediately bristle when he realized the waitress had followed them outside. He felt a snap rising and his hand itched to grab the back of Cas’ jacket and tug him away, but he stopped himself.
Jack must have been hanging around for maybe fifteen minutes before the idea struck Dean. They were eating Cookie Crunch in the kitchen when Jack asked,
“I am your father.” Cas rumbled over him like some kind of competitive Darth Vader. Dean gleefully listened to the drama unfold as he drove them to Hutch’s.
“Yeah, they’ll be there for another ten minutes at least.” Dean snorted. His eyes caught a street stand a block or so down from where the Impala was. “Hey, you wanna get some ice cream?”
“Yes.” Jack murmured. Pristine white Keds stepped into Dean’s line of sight. “I’m sorry Dean, but the afterlife’s not ready for you yet.”
So the lack of hunts didn’t bother him. There was plenty to do around here anyways—prank Sam, hang out with Cas since they were two old farts with nothing better to do, have some Alone Time in his room because hey, erectile dysfunction could happen to anyone and Dean wanted to get his dues before it potentially happened to him.
Jack positively beamed at that and eagerly wrapped himself into Dean’s embrace. They never really got the chance to patch up their relationship, before or after Chuck. Dean knew Jack had forgiven him, but sometimes his own self deprecation made him think there were some things left unsaid. But he was trying to be better. Hence the hug.
He said vehemently, tugging him impossibly closer before he could get the wrong idea in his head and pull back. “I mean, yeah at some point but…’was gonna—“
“This will hurt.” He warned before lifting Dean right off the rebar like he weighed nothing. Dean let out a grunt of agony, squeezing his eyes shut against the wave of pain. He crumpled into Cas’ arms, feeling the blood seep into his shirt.
die on me, do you understand?” Cas warned lowly, sounding pissed off and scared shitless. Now, he was clearly talking to Dean. “I won’t allow it. I’ll drag you back down from Heaven myself because I can and
The daydream gave him an urge to go to Bobby’s place and fix it up, to just hop into Baby and drive to Sioux Falls.
He got stuck paying the bill, leaving Sam and Cas to race outside for the next shotgun yelling match. June hadn’t come around again, which was good news for her because without Cas around, Dean was pretty sure he would have said something rude.
“The garden looks incredible when the sun rises.” Cas told him, swinging his feet lazily and munching on a strawberry. “I often watch it and read a book.”
There was a sharp knock on his door, interrupting the headspace he had accidentally wandered into. Dean jumped, instinctively slapping the lid of his laptop closed like he’d been watching porn instead of a medical drama.
Cas gave him a squinty glare and allowed it. Dean made up excuses for almost everything he put in, although Cas did win some battles, mostly over the things that Dean knew he wouldn’t eat. But he drew the line as they stood in the dairy section.
Sam’s argument got interrupted by a phone call, and Cas slid into the passenger seat before he could stop him. Glowering, his brother ducked into the backseat again.
Jack disappeared pretty quick after patching Dean up, mentioning something about rebuilding Heaven. Dean guessed that had been what the kid meant by the afterlife not being ready for him.
Gritting his teeth as another aching crack of despair ran through his chest, Dean focused his attention on wiping the oil from his hands.
“It’s not…it’s complicated, Jack.” He sighed, reaching over to catch dribble of Jack’s ice cream before it could hit his hand. “Sometimes people think it’s wrong for people to wear some things.”
Dean was having a hard time trying not to glower at the waitress, who was raking her eyes all over Cas. She was his girl after all, she had a right to. And, judging by how frequent his trips out have been, it was safe to say Dean might have to start getting used to her.
“—and with Daphne I didn’t have much conscious choice in the matter.” Cas continued. “I’d lost my memory and wasn’t really
“Yeah…” Dean mumbled. His brain couldn’t fathom some stranger living there without paying homage to the man who had owed it before. It didn’t seem right. “How…how much s’it goin’ for?”
looks that happy before they die unless they’re nine kinds of crazy. And why’d you have to go dying again in the first fucking place, huh? Why can’t you just
He remembered vaguely pinning Sam on dish duty before ducking out of the kitchen. His hands were itching to do something, and the urge led him under Baby for the entire day. She had gotten a little busted up on their last hunt, and working on her meant his mind could wander like how people’s minds drift in the shower.
A loud ringing filled the room and golden light washed warm all over him. The pain faded into nothingness as Dean felt his split ribs patch over and his skin and muscles sew themselves as if the wound had never happened.
Cas tasted vaguely like toothpaste and there was a lingering hint of maple syrup from the pancakes that morning. Dean could hear and feel him breathing hard through his nose, a sound he was undoubtedly matching. His hands gripped Dean’s hips and pulled them flush together from thighs to chest. Their stubbles scratched pleasantly against each other as their lips became wetter and wetter and their tongues pressed and wrapped around each other. Cas’ tongue traced his inner gums like he was exploring the cave of his mouth, leaving tingling sensation in its wake. Dean’s hands itched to get a hold of that soft messy bedhead and it took him a moment to realize that the could. He was allowed to touch Cas now.
Unable to hide the smug smile, Dean dumped his cheap white eggs into the cart and toodled on. Cas’ eyes burned into his back the entire rest of the trip.
Cas sidled into the garage so quietly that Dean didn’t notice until he was standing right next to him.
Cas disappeared from the Bunker a few days later, as did his car. No warning, no “I’m going on another errand I won’t tell you about”, just gone.
How exactly had Cas summoned the Empty? What had he meant when Dean had gotten impaled and Cas whispered about watching him die and never imagining it being like this? Where had he been disappearing to, if not to see a lady? Why was he suddenly so obsessed with sitting shotgun when he had never been before?
Either way, Dean didn’t want to overload the newly turned human with all his questions. Cas was adjusting to things like sleep and food and pissing, and Dean remembered how annoying it had been to remember to do those things after his whole demon phase. The last thing Cas needed was Dean adding his pestering questions to the mix.
Jack beamed brightly and nodded, hugging the dress to his chest. Cas’ carefully blank expression melted into a soft one, his eyes shining with gratitude and approval. Okay, that made Dean feel a little better. As Jack skipped ahead to find Sam and get his approval, he felt a hand on his shoulder, right above the faded, matching mark.
Dean was pretty proud of himself for managing to stay quiet about two hours into their drive, but when they passed the Oklahoma border and there was nothing but wide empty road, a box of mixtapes they’re already listened through once, and a foot of space between him and the angelic being he had been in love with since he stabbed him in a barn, Dean knew the moment he snapped.
“Nah, trust me. I don’t let ‘em walk out the door if they aren’t in pairs.” Jody chuckled. “Donna either.”
He should probably be wondering why this touch was affecting him so much. He had known plenty of best friends who liked physical affection and touched so casually, so logically, Dean knew it wasn’t that big of a deal but—he and Cas didn’t
Dean wanted to disappear under his blankets. He wanted to shoot the test dummies in the gun range. He kinda wanted to cry.
experience that there was more than enough space to fit two people, so Sam was just being a sore loser.
“I can?” Sam asked incredulously. Both Eileen and Dean pinned him with a look that had him clearing his throat and nodding. “I can.”
He was gently laid on his stomach in the infirmary, Cas sitting on front of his turned head so Dean could see him while Sam rummaged through the cabinets.
Jesus, every time Cas put a hand on his shoulder or looked at him with that soft gaze, Dean wanted to melt into the goddamn floor. He was just so…
“I came to say hello.” Jack said simply, sitting down with his hands resting on his knees. A very Cas-like gesture. “I have some free time between reconstruction, and I wanted to spend it here. At home.”
. His father had done what he wanted with his life, so why should he get to control what Dean did with his?
All Dean could gather from context clues was Chuck spewing every insult he could think of, every taunt and egotistical snarl. All he could see was Cas smiling up at the father he had rebelled against, talking about
“Cas says it’s good to be polite.” Jack said seriously. “Can I choose who gets shotgun next since I won?”
“I could do that, but I fear I would be wasting my time.” Cas said as casually as a summer breeze. What the hell did that mean? Were they just fuck buddies? Did June not want to know Cas more, and if not, why
Jack was already carving a decent chunk out of his ice cream, apparently not minding the mix of tastes. Dean’s was pretty good, just vanilla with cinnamon added. It kinda made him want pie (more than usual, anyway). Maybe he would make one when they got home.
poking his head. He had tried ignoring it, but it seemed to find ways to pop up and bitch smack him across the face so he would deal with it anyway.
to say it. He couldn’t bear seeing that open, cracked, stricken look on Cas’ face. It reminded him too much of when he kicked him out of the Bunker the first time he had turned human. He never wanted to see that look cross those features again. Dean
There were less hunts to go on now. With Rowena reigning in all the demons and Chuck no longer throwing case after case at them, hunts were few and far between. Sam had also created a huge network of hunters now that the population had grown, which just meant there were less jobs for them all.
He didn’t even have anything of Cas’ to carry or burn this time. Just a video of his death without sound, a faded handprint on his shoulder, and memories that just made it all the more painful. He didn’t know how to live when Cas was dead and
Cas entire face lit up when his eyes fell on the omelet, and he happily sat down with it wearing a rather giddy smile on his face.
A flicker of something flitted across Cas’ face, but it was smoothed over before Dean could even begin to process it. The corners of his mouth ticked up.
“I think I do.” Dean shrugged. “I wear whatever’s comfortable. Maybe that’ll change, who knows. But the point is, some folks don’t understand that things like this don’t matter. It doesn’t make you a freak, Jack.”
Jack had somehow managed to scare Dean twice in a row with his sudden appearance and blunt question. He blinked down at the kid, who was twisting his hips back and forth subconsciously to make his skirt swish around him. It took him a moment to make up an excuse that didn’t involve spilling his crush out to his son.
“They’re usually much more rectangular. I bought mini packs because—“ Cas’ tan cheeks flushed, and Dean felt a thrill go up his spine as he remembered that pink hue. Cas had been
with Cas, letting him move him and touch him however he wanted. He had never been that way with Lisa or Cassie. He remembered them touching him somewhere and how he had flinched away as a bad memory took its place. With Cas, his touches felt safe. Healing. Comfort.
Dean didn’t remember how they got to the car, but somewhere in a far corner of his mind, he was touched that Cas immediately bypassed the free passenger seat to sit with him instead. Dean was sprawled in the backseat with his head on Cas’ lap while a wadded up shirt was pressed to the gaping wound between his shoulder blades. The rebar hadn’t been long enough to pierce his lungs, Dean surmised sluggishly, but if he didn’t get fixed up he would just bleed to death instead.
Dean found his free hand drifting towards the newly healed leaf, stroking the soft greenery with his thumb.
The inaction was rewarded a moment later when Cas’ voice murmured, so quietly he almost couldn’t hear him over Baby’s rumble.
“Okay then.” They fell into a mostly comfortable silence. Cas leaned against Baby’s side while he watched Dean fiddle with the engine and tighten some bolts. He got landed with turning the car on and off when Dean told him to, frowning down at the maze of metal and tubes and listening for any more wheezing.
New Orleans in general were very aware of ghost activity, which made their jobs easier and harder. Some folk didn’t bat an eye when Sam told them they were looking for ghost, even helped them with ways to contact them. Others only believed it was a tourist trap and laughed at them.
That mindset actually got him through the rest of the meal, and he was happily satisfied after about three baskets of fries that just kept coming. Cas also looked pleased, having polished off his cheeseburger and still picking up fries. He had a funny way of eating them though, as Dean noticed. Cas liked to squish out the mushy innards of the fries and eat them before popping the crispy skin into his mouth. If he hadn’t been a newly-made human, Dean would have made fun of him for it. But hey, he’s a weird dude.
, Dean surmised as Cas shifted his hips, dragging his thigh up against his and making him lose his train of thought all over again.
Cas sat shotgun with his hand resting on Dean’s thigh, absentmindedly rubbing his thumb up and down the denim. They dropped Sam off at the Bunker and Jack said goodbye before disappearing. There was a five hour drive ahead of them, and Dean turned to Cas.
Dean didn’t want to go to Hutch’s. But seeing how Sam’s glower intensified the moment slight hesitation crossed his face, he decided against going somewhere else.
“Where?” Jack asked, his back hunching as if to duck—an instinct that Dean knew he had instilled on him the first time he tried to shoot him. Ah, there was the guilt again.
“It hasn’t been a popular site, from what I’ve seen. They’re selling it pretty cheap. The scrapyard too. Just thought I’d oughta let you know.”
“Hutch’s?” Cas asked expectantly when they both slid into the car. Sam kneed the back of the bench rather aggressively.
He didn’t even notice Sam and Cas were waiting impatiently at the door for him until they were both bellowing on either side of him,
A dark flare burned brightly in Cas’ eyes, clearly reliving of their activities the night before. Dean was still pleasantly sore.
They caught wind of a case in New Orleans. It took five days, only three of which were actually spent in the city. Dean liked the place well enough—he’d heard Mardis Gras was like a party that never ended—but they were there at the wrong time. But the streets were still filled with jazz music and people bustling up and down the cobble streets. It was a nice place. Twenty six year old Dean would have had a great time there.
When the waitress came back with their drinks, Dean noticed Cas’ was topped off with an apple slice.
“Stop it.” Dean mumbled, but his body sinking and softening under Cas’ ministrations told otherwise.
“So why’re you really here?” He side-eyed Cas as he poured bright blue liquid into the coolant tank. “Wouldn’t happen to do with wanting to call shotgun?”
“Cas, let’s go.” He heard himself snap, narrowing his eyes at the waitress who didn’t even glance at him. Cas, however, turned right around. The confused look on his face morphed into one of vague amusement.
“Like you said,” Dean interrupted firmly. “it’s not even a case. Cas and I’ll go pick it up while you bring Queen Scam here.”
Sam griped the entire way to Hutch’s, whining about being squished in the back and his legs were too big to fit. It was rich, coming from the guy who had practically grown up in Baby’s backseat and was able to fall asleep there without batting an eyelash. Dean knew from
But he was okay with saying goodbye this time. This time, he and Sam would be only an hour away once he and Eileen moved, Jack was going to stop by more frequently now that most of Heaven’s building was complete, and he had Cas next to him throughout it all. He was ready to take on the next portion of his life, to make the house their new home, and to spend the rest of his time on Earth with Cas. He was ready to finally sit back and grow old with the wild grass fields and the ex-angel he’d been in love with for years.
It was just before sunrise when Dean woke up to find the pillow next to him empty. He was tired—after the emotional talk with Cas, the sex, the drive back, explaining everything to Sam and Eileen, the sex—Dean pretty much conked out afterwards with his arms and legs wound around Cas like a goddamn octopus.
“Thanks, Jack.” Sam said weakly, crushing their son in a hug. Dean rose to his feet unsteadily, noticing how Cas immediately moved to help despite knowing he had been healed. Jack smiled up at Sam before turning to Dean and Cas.
that wasn’t going to go away but demanded his attention. There was something to this, something about how Dean didn’t pull away or feel that flash of fear at any physical contact that wasn’t intended to hurt.
, exactly. They felt like the way Dean used to talk as a kid, echoing phrases and words to sound important, more grownup, more—like John.
. He wasn’t supposed to wear stuff like that. He would have taken the horrible plaid coat over that—
“—I’m free anytime, handsome.” The waitress winked, hanging Cas a slip of paper that he just blinked at.
Dean stared at his cereal. Cas hadn’t seemed desperate. He was firm and steady almost the entire time Dean was dying. He made Sam’s slightly shaking fingers look like an overreaction. But his anguish and fear had been so intense that Jack heard it over the billions of other prayers in his ears?
he was supposed to work out? His internalized gender and daddy issues? There had probably been a lot of shit Dean said without realizing he was just echoing his father’s mentality.
There was an ugly, twisting feeling rising up in his chest that Dean couldn’t quite identify and before he could look at in in detail, bright blue eyes were suddenly boring into his.
“You can come in.” Cas smiled, warm and shy. Dean ducked his head and shoved his hands in his pockets.
Clutching his dress, Jack just about bolted towards the cart. Dean followed at a much slower pace, ambling by Cas and Sam while they argued, completely ignoring him.
Dean flinched at the loud noise before rolling his eyes, his hands still balled into fists from his reaction. He glared ahead as Sam and Cas bickered on either side of him, walking across the parking lot towards Baby. People passing by where giving them weird looks—two grown ass men fighting over the passenger seat? ‘Course they were getting weird looks.
It was a daunting task to take on, but what else was he gonna do? Less and less of his time was spent hunting, and if he bought Bobby’s place…it could be his ticket out for good. He was tired of hunting, of constantly putting his life at risk. He was getting too old for it too. Sooner or later he was gonna throw out his back on a case and get murked.
“Until Sam demands to implement this rule, I will abuse his ignorance.” Cas replied, smiling too. He had been quick enough to claim shotgun a few times since the war started, and every time, Dean felt that itchy bundle of questions pressing in his throat. Why did Cas suddenly cared about seating arrangements? He had never bothered before, he just sat in the back because there was never any room in the front.
“Perhaps we could have been friends, but I doubt she would be interested in a friendship considering the life I live.”
Codependency wasn’t anything to freak out about, right? It certainly didn’t have anything to do with why his brain turned into mush whenever Cas touched him.
Dean nearly swallowed his tongue, suddenly aware of Sam staring at him too. Cas just blinked, a relieved look smoothing out the usual scowl he wore. Dean swallowed, trying to find it within himself to say something normal.
“Y’like being out in the open, huh?” Dean murmured, poking through the variety of berries before choosing a blueberry. He picked it up with the hand that still held Cas’, which in turn dragged his hand along as he popped the berry into his mouth.
They went to a thrift store at Sam and Cas’ insistence (something about being better for the environment), but really Dean had pulled into the parking lot because thrift stores were what he was used to. He bought all of his and Sammy’s clothes from second hand shops growing up. They were easy, cheap, and the people were usually nice. Retail stores always seemed too fancy for him.
Sitting on the concrete ledge that ran around the edge of the roof was an abandoned book and a handful of berries piled in the bowl of a wide brim straw hat. Dean felt a grin slid onto his face at the mere image of Cas wearing it, bent over one of the planter boxes wearing nothing but a pair of overalls, sweat glistening against his skin, dirt scattered on his hands—
for Cas to come back just to lecture him on prioritizing hunts over getting his dick wet. He and Sam could have used Cas’ help in New Orleans, but the guy was too busy with his prissy little waitress to care. Sam could have died. Dean nearly cracked his ribs again. He could appreciate choosing sex over responsibility, but this was getting ridiculous. It was like Cas was gone all the time now.
“Why don’t you let me decide for myself, huh?” He shot right back just as vehemently. Cas’ glare intensified as he sat there without answering.
Now that Cas pointed them out, Dean could see slightly smaller trees strategically placed around the rooftop.
do you mean, your happiness? Why would you be sorry for how something that makes you happy affects me?” Dean demanded.
“Yeah?” He needled, his lips quirking into a teasing smirk, wanting to see that pink darken. Cas was pointedly
Instead, he sat down with Cas on the ledge, their bare feet dangling a good thirty yards off the ground. He tucked himself a little closer to Cas’ side, one hand bracing the ledge just in case.
He wasn’t sure which was worse—living under the assumption Cas had a girl, or living knowing Cas was only attracted to men and still didn’t want him. He couldn’t blame him, though. Dean wasn’t exactly the poster child for healthy, loving relationships. He had baggage, he woke up at night screaming, he got angry and lashed out. ‘Course Cas would want more for himself. Dean wanted more for him too. He was his best friend too, Cas wouldn’t want to get involved with his best friend.
“Not helpful.” Dean snapped. He got a vague hum in response. When he turned around to pester Cas further, the bench across from him was empty, and the plate half eaten. Dean glared suspiciously at the door Cas had disappeared through. If it was just a dumb errand, why wouldn’t he tell Dean what it was?
“It was a simple case. I arrived back yesterday.” Cas said, although there was something stiff in his shoulders and there was a pink tinge in his tanned cheeks that Dean blearily noticed.
“When you stop doubting your self worth.” Cas bargained. His warm hands trailed blazes as they traveled up to clutch Dean’s hands against his face. “You are worth
“When Jack died, I made a deal.” Cas told him, talking smoothly over Dean’s internal panicking. “The Empty was after him and I told it to take me instead.”
Dean cut him off with a murderous glare before fixing his eyes back on the road, his shoulders hunched.
“How could she have an object for me if I do not know her? Did I drop something?” Cas asked, and Dean wanted to either smack his forehead on the tabletop or laugh. But he was still annoyed, so he just rolled his eyes instead. Sam laughed.
“Um, hello.” Cas shifted, much more awkward than he had been before, probably trying not to give her the wrong idea. Dean took comfort in noticing how he held his hand a little tighter.
This time, Dean really did slam on the brakes. Baby shrieked in protest as they skidded onto the shoulder, tires wailing as they dragged black marks on the greying asphalt. The car came to a wobbling stop, and Dean threw the stick into park and basically yanked himself out of the car. He needed open air for this, cool wind instead of stale, cramped air of the car. Cas got out of the car too, and Dean whirled around to jab a finger in his face from across the hood.
Dean sat bolt upright in bed, ripping his eyes from the spot on the ceiling he had been blankly staring at, choking on a gasp instead.
He decided he hated it. He has gotten pretty comfy being able to look around and find the ex angel nearby, and he had caught himself opening his mouth to tell Cas something only to remind himself that he wasn’t there.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean said, forcing his voice to remain level and casual. He was looking especially good today. He had layered a black leather jacket over a grey t-shirt with Dean’s old ripped jeans. With his fucked out hair and intense blue eyes, the whole ensemble made Dean want to rove his eyes around hungrily. But he restrained himself.
There was no apple in Cas’ cider this time, and “handsome” was out of June’s vocabulary. She spent the rest of the evening pointedly
“Do you—“ Dean nearly choked on his tongue trying to get the words out. He tried to stay casual. “so, do you…have you ever wanted more with someone? Have you, y’know…” And apparently that was all the words his throat was going to allow.
No. They were past all that. There were no big threats anymore that warranted secrecy. Cas was just being a stubborn ass.
Cas was leaving for a few hours and wouldn’t tell Dean where he was going. Had he picked up on his dislike for the waitress and was hiding the fact that he was going to see her because of it?
A week ago if Cas disappeared, Dean would’ve panicked and think he was gone fucking the waitress, but now when Cas disappeared, he knew exactly where he went.
Dean just nodded and flashed Cas an awkward smile before all but fleeing from the room before he embarrassed himself any further.
“Guess not.” He mumbled instead, leaning under the hood to screw the cap open on the coolant. But because Dean is a self-deprecating little shit, he didn’t believe he deserved Cas’ company without the usual impending doom looming over them. Which is what compelled him to ask,
Dean threw himself against Baby’s side and crossed his arms, now glaring at the garage entrance. He was gonna fucking
Dean let out a scoff, marching over to stick his face into the camera. Sam let out an indignant huff but angled the phone so Eileen could read his lips.
“Of all the ways I was shown your death.” Cas said, so quiet that Dean figured he was talking to himself. “I doubt it could have ever imagined up something like this.”
“Hey! Watch it, dude!” He snapped, whipping his hands back just in time. Dean didn’t even hear him. He just clenched his jaw and glared at the empty space. Vaguely, he heard Sam let out an exasperated huff and lumber further into the Bunker.
“There is it.” Cas whispered, turning his head slightly to gaze at the scarlet-orange fireball peeking over the forest canopy. “Look.”
In a sickening slice, the vamp’s head was suddenly gone and the pressure against the blade vanished.
“Ohh, I like this one!” From one of the racks, Jack took out a white dress with balloon sleeves and little cloth buttons that ran down the front. It was patterned with artistic gold-orange butterflies and flowers, and there was a leather belt that Dean assumed was buckled around the waist.
Of course, Dean never really cared who sat where. Sure, Sam had been the reigning owner of the passenger seat, but Dean never minded if Cas sat up there, although he only did it when Sam wasn’t riding with them.
like some grieving widower. Car to car since the Impala was busted, consciously moving the coat between trunks. How hadn’t he seen it earlier? Why had he let John dig so far into his own subconscious that he didn’t even realize the things he was doing?
“Oh.” Dean said dumbly. He mulled over that for about two seconds when he remembered something. “Hang on! What about those condoms I saw you hiding in your pocket? When we came back from New Orleans?”
John’s voice floated back into his mind, tainting the vulnerable memories with their own opinions. Dean forced it away. This wasn’t about John. This wasn’t his life, it was
“So, Cas.” He began in a voice that promised he was starting shit. “That waitress last night. You two seem friendly.”
“Y’know what you could do, though?” Dean said as the idea hit him. “you could spy on him for m—just to make sure he’s okay.”
“Mornin’ sunshine.” Dean greeted Cas as he did every day. He gave Dean a small smile before beelining for the coffee.
“That’s what matters, Dean.” Cas said, tugging at his shoulder. Dean turned effortlessly, thoughtlessly. He was pinned under that blue gaze a moment later. “You’re making an effort to be better with Jack, better than your father ever was to you or Sam. It doesn’t matter how close you were to saying otherwise. What matters is that you caught it and made it right.”
“Bring the car here, I’ll patch her up.” He offered, although it was more of an order. “Shop’ll do the work all day and pay you twice as much. Sam can take the tow truck and meet you.”
He and Cas had been almost inseparable since they started their relationship. Dean would follow Cas whenever he disappeared to the roof, Cas hung out in the garage when Dean was working. When a rare case crossed their path, Cas would either go with Dean or stay with him, never skipping out on another hunt again until Dean decided there were no more hunts for him or Cas to go on. The house had occupied most of their time and Dean wanted to get used to the idea of retirement.
“Why the hell do seed packets look like condoms?” He demanded, more embarrassed than anything else. Cas shrugged.
When the food arrived and forced them to relinquish their hands, Cas almost immediately replaced the loss of contact with his thigh, pressing hot and sturdy against Dean’s. When he could, Dean ducked a hand down to rest on that thick upper leg because he
“In your society’s terms, I believe the closest description of me would be homosexual.” Cas said flatly, although his eyes remained fixed on Sam rather than Dean. “Although very few men have interested me romantically either.”
The next morning, Dean was feeling better. He had spent the rest of the night repressing his newfound discovery as he had been doing with his emotions since he was a kid. He wasn’t sure he wouldn’t glitch out if he saw Cas, but at least he forced himself to go and make breakfast as usual so no one would get suspicious.
. Nothing about what you said is something you gotta pursue, and those sound a helluva lot like needs. What are the things you
to know what Cas told Chuck, but the now-human wouldn’t budge. Dean had maybe pulled Cas to his feet from the floor before Sam started demanding answers.
When the waitress came back with their food, the only reason Dean didn’t rear up and snap when she called Cas ‘
Dean had honestly been expecting a bit more protest, but hey, the kid’s four. He sat alone in the kitchen as the seconds ticked by, getting increasingly anxious. He would be back any second now…
Dean stopped mid-chew, wondering how the hell to tell a four year old kid that his dad was out banging a chick.
“Not the weapon, Jack.” Dean said gently as Jack eased back upright. “It’s a game Cas and Sam are playing.”
“Damnit Cas, you know what I mean.” Dean shot at him. “What the hell do you mean, what you want is something you can’t have? And what about all those trips you’ve been taking if you haven’t been out banging Miss. Bouncy? Where the hell have you been goin’? Or—or that shit you were saying about watching me die and not being able to stop it? And
Yes, you assholes. You read it right. I am profoundly deaf but hey, my hearing devices (hearing aids) help to fulfill the capability of my hearing.
I shrug and sign, “I don’t know, Cas. But that is not important right now. What’s important is that something or someone could possibly come across them. We need to be extra careful with our kids, Cas. I mean, they are the KIDS whose fathers were hunters and their primary parental figures are a celestial being and a hunter. That is said enough.”
I explain that I felt something this morning and it was LOUD. It was coming from Destiel’s room, so I ran to get my gun out from the hidden spot and went into her bedroom. I found both of them lying on the floor. Destiel said that Sage tried to wake her up by screaming into her less deaf ear and Destiel send her flying and she fell on Sage. And then this afternoon, she was smiling so big. Not to mention that Destiel bought a whole pie. They both met this "really kind" man at the bakery.
That's the thing about curly hair. They have a MIND OF THEIR OWN. They get to decide if the curls would look good or being a motherfucking pain in the fucking ass.
Eileen knew this is too true. Ever since the World has literally come to an end, no one expected the Winchesters and Jack to fight against Chuck (the former god) and won.
I roll my eyes and eat the breakfast sandwich. I grin because Aunt Eileen added avocado in mine. I pumped my fists in victory. I grabbed the hot sauce from Sage and put a good amount that covers all the breakfast.
I sign, “Honestly, I have no fucking idea what this is all about. But I know, for sure, I feel something. I am not sure what but something. I don’t like it. And the floating in the air you saw? I wasn’t floating. I was FLYING."
After that whole strange incident, I could not stop thinking about what just happened. I FUCKING flew. In midair! And that is not the worst part. The worst part is that Sage was there and she saw me flying! I never felt mortified more than the speech I had to give at the middle school promotion.
20 minutes later, “WOW. I am really stuffed! That is the best dinner dish, no question! Thank you, Aunt Eileen and Sage for making them yummy ass food. Now, I know I will go to sleep peacefully tonight!” I sign and smile at them both.
Aunt Eileen laughs out loud and signs, “You have no idea how stubborn he is, compared to Sam. Sam is much calmer out of two and is always more stable than Dean ever was.”
I grin hard, “Oh I know. I am not ashamed at all. I am very glad I am her mother. Can you believe that the Winchesters have no clues that they have kids? I cannot imagine the reunion. It is going to BE AWKWARD."
Sage signs, “THAT WAS FLYING??? But-- but you are not an angel, like your dad, are you? We have to tell my mom about this. She can help us.”
Dinner is served and I am sitting down next to Aunt Eileen and across from Sage. Tonight, we are having street tacos! There are variety meats we can put in our tortillas such as shrimp, al pastor, carne asada and chicken. Aunt Eileen eats hers chicken and veggies. Seriously, I wonder if that’s Uncle Sammy’s doing.
I continue to sign, “Yeah, I know. Shocking. But then she joined us at the table, eating with us. Then Uncle Cas started to chuckle. Destiel caught that and asked what’s funny.”
I just stare at her. The fact is eerie that she is so much like Dean. She is practically mini Dean. I find genetics a bit scary but very fascinating.
"Like I can control that!! Come on, Sage! What can I do? I keep apologizing profusely and every time he answers the same, "It's okay. I am here now."
Sage wide her eyes. Why does Sage look like that? I look at what Sage just looked at. I find Sage's eyes looking over at Destiel. Destiel gapes her mouth wide open. Destiel suddenly looks somebody has been slapped her.
Sage talks about how much she does not look forward to Prom. On the quite contrary, for me, I am BEYOND excited because I am on the committee. I work very hard to make sure the decorations go smooth for PROM. That is the best part of Prom, I believe.
Sage sits across from me and takes a sip of her “chocolate glazed donut” coffee. After swallowing, she sighs in content. The early sun hit her perfectly. Her light brown eyes shine. Her olive skin is standing out with her long, auburn that is mixed with her natural hair color, light brown. She is definitely the child of Sam and Eileen.
I sign, “Sam was a healthiness freak. He constantly was eating salad and drank protein shakes. Sam wasn’t obsessed with bacon. Dean, on the other hand, was.”
Sage and I are late so Sage gives me my pop tarts for breakfast since we did not have time to sit down and eat. The pop tart flavor is Cookie Dough and I shrug. I love cookie dough, real ones, not pop tart kind. I don’t like pop tarts, in general.
That hits me home. I realize something. Dean and Sam. I have heard those two names countless times and they are brothers.
Sage widens her eyes and gape her mouth. I didn’t have time to react because Aunt Eileen signs furiously.
I shake my head because I don’t like missing school. School is something I like to go to every day. It gives me something to focus on the hand of task. Besides, I like to be around people, not isolating away. Besides, if I miss school, dad will be more disappointed than he already is and I don’t want to play him like that.
I sign, “Dad, I understand that you are not ready to see us being grown up and all. However, I do know that we are old enough to take care of ourselves. I may not be no celestial being but that does not mean I can learn how to fight like a hunter. I do not want to be a hunter, no thanks. I still want to go to college.”
Cas said and sign, “Ever since last night, I felt some weird presence. I wasn’t sure what that means or what it is. Then this morning, I felt power wave and it immediately made me woozy for a sec or so. It is most likely something or someone that should not be in this world. They do not belong here. Then recently, like an hour or so, I felt that same presence again. Only this time, I was able to pinpoint and it led me to here in this very town. Something or someone is here.”
Sage perks up and I grin so hard. We see all those delicious sweets on the display. I run to the glass and smash my hands on them.
As I thought about my dad, I scamper around my bed and found some clothes I plan to wear today. I look outside quickly. I want to feel the weather so I open the window and put my arm out there like I always did every day.
I get myself a slice of chocolate peanut-butter pie, because they are fucking delicious. Sweet, yet salty! PERFECT combination. All more for me if you don’t like it. You suck.
As we stop at the intersection and wait for the light to turn green, Sage is about to say something but the strange feeling gets me first. This same strange feeling I got back in the house. I must make Sage confused because of my facial expression. I look around my surroundings.
I sign, “Destiel, think about it. Our parents are not ordinary. I mean, Uncle Cas is a goddamn celestial being and Mom over there knows about Supernatural and she hunts those for a LIVING. So of course, that will impact us because they are OUR PARENTS. Just think of you and me as a couple of lost cats. What happens to those cats? They will be locked up and put to sleep.”
Sage shrugs and smiles while I clear my throat and tip my head. Destiel just rolls her eyes and makes a beeline for the coffee. Destiel have started to drink coffee when she was only eleven years old. She likes to pour a small amount of creamer in her coffee, though.
, Dean thinks affectionately, and then he’s slipping, sliding, tripping backward, and inky tendrils pull him into the void.
“Time to roll for Perception and hope we don’t get screwed by the dice, ey?” Dean quips. He shrugs his shoulders to adjust his pack and peers about for a way to follow the stream down the stony wall in front of them.
,” Cas replies senselessly, hopelessly lost in the storm of feeling inside him. He moves, then, seeking, and when their mouths seal together, it feels like coming home.
Cas’s fingers cover Dean’s. He tries to pull away, but the angel's grip tightens, pinning him in place. Suddenly Dean is drowning in stormy seas and lightning, every hair on his body struggling to stand on end. “You didn’t pull the trigger.”
They can’t stay in bed all day, of course. Charlie and Meg descend on them around dinner time with a veritable laundry list of stuff they have to do, and for the first time Dean doesn’t fear the conversation. He shares shy glances with Cas as they go over who will stand where, who will say what, when this or that event will occur. None of it is new, but now there’s a certain kind of magic in the air as they hash out the details.
to Cas, however, because he comes so hard Dean chokes on it, coughing and gagging, then licking and sucking to clean up the mess. His hand remains clapped to Dean’s shoulder through the whole thing, his fingers curling so hard that Dean knows he’ll have crescent-shaped bruises the next day.
of it is.” He turns his attention back to the fey. “I don’t want to fuck this up, okay? Just...just get under the hood yourselves. Have a look around, tinker with the spark plugs.” He spreads his arms. “Do what you gotta so I can talk to him. I won’t stop you.”
He finds himself pushing up to meet the angel’s caresses then, turning his head to accept the kisses given to him. Then all restraint is gone and Dean gives as good as he gets. Lips taste, test, and demand more; teeth nip and scrape, delighting in every shudder and groan the angel gives in return; arms and legs tangle together, fall apart, then wind together once more.
Dean’s mind does a lazy handspring or two while he processes those words, but when he finally understands what Cas is saying, his mouth drops open of its own volition. “You think you took advantage of me.” It’s a statement, not a question, but Cas nods anyway. “Last night?” Cas nods again, gloved fingers curling into his coat.
Cas pushes himself off his chair and begins gathering glass fragments and herbs together with careful fingers. “Don’t let me keep you from Princess Needza Dicken, Dean,” he says, and if Sam couldn’t see his face from here, couldn’t see the way he squeezes his eyes shut and sniffs after, he might think Cas didn’t give two shits about Dean at all.
“Yes, Dean,” Sam replies, patience effectively burned to nothing, “we have blogs. Now, as I was saying—almost all cultures have some kind of bogeyman figure. There’s usually a sack involved in some way, and their purpose seems to be to scare children into obedience. They feed off the fear that they create.”
about his voice—a little too high, a little too fast—and his hand doesn’t move. His fingers curl, even, pressing closer to Dean’s skin as if seeking comfort.
needs to be the one to tell me about it,” Crowley grumbles in response, but he’s quick to go back to the computer to do...whatever it is he does all day...and Dean wonders, yet again, how the place actually stays in business.
He pops the pie in the oven, then crosses his arms and leans against it as he faces Cas once more. “What do you think, Cas? Think a bunch of salty hunters could do some good out there?”
Cas walks through the door just then, so the other woman bites back whatever she’d been about to say. “Don’t forget,” she responds instead, her tone ominous.
With a sigh, Sam sucks down the last of his smoothie and snaps his laptop shut. It’s time to tell Dean about the case.
Dean stares down at Cas, transfixed by the feel of his mouth and hands, the sweat on his brow, the blue of his eyes when he looks up to meet Dean’s gaze. “Cas,” Dean whimpers brokenly through cascading pleasure, stroking his hands over and through Cas’s hair because he’s utterly incapable of doing anything else.
Cas follows him to the kitchen first, where he helps Dean peel and slice apples, and listens patiently as his righteous man explains (with expansive hand gestures) how to make a proper pie crust. The apples go in a bowl with sugar and cinnamon, then both fruit and crust go in the fridge to chill.
” Cas wrestles him up the mattress and then they’re trading kisses that can last as long as they want, now they’re somewhere private and warm. Dean loses himself in velvet and silk, wet heat, smooth skin, the burn of stubble against sensitive skin and the dark, spicy scent of
“I—” Cas pauses, eyebrows pulling together as he visibly sorts through his memories. “I don’t remember,” he says, then runs his tongue over his lower lip. “We were going to Ohio, I think.”
Violet’s visibly shaking as she leads them around an old tricycle to a china cabinet of sorts. It’s scratched up, but not falling apart; big and bulky, with shelves above and cupboards below. The doors are open, presumably left that way by the police who’d swarmed every inch of the place for hours according to the witch.
Sam blinks, taken off guard by the odd phrasing until he realizes what Cas actually meant. It’s endearing, in a way. Infuriating, too, that the angel can try so hard to be more human, yet this divide remains, as cold and empty as the empty halls the angel paces while his human friends sleep. It’s visible most in moments like these, when he says something innocuous but gets it wrong in a way no human would.
There’s a stone rolling down a mountain somewhere in Dean’s mind. It bounces and gathers speed, crashing and churning until it brings the whole hill down with it in a rush. When the debris hits bottom, his mouth opens and words fall out. “Dad would hate me if he knew.”
It wouldn’t be the first time Cas has pulled a similar hare-brained move thinking it would protect Dean in some way, but this time…this time doesn’t feel right. Sure, Cas had been annoyed at Dean, but there had been something else afterward, something that ran deep and raw and authentic to
“Cas,” he tries, but his voice breaks and it comes out barely a whisper. “Cas,” he tries again, this time a bit stronger. “Wake up. Castiel!”
He pulls away again, and this time when he ducks down he pauses just before his lips press against Dean’s.
When Castiel awakes, the first thing he notices is that he’s been moved. There’s just enough light for him to see he’s surrounded by shelving in what he guesses is a larger warehouse. He’s also alone (or hopes he is), and he’s strung up by his wrists, toes touching the floor just enough to give him the illusion of stability. It’s an uncomfortable, but impermanent situation; Castiel rolls his eyes and shoves his grace through the cuffs holding him upright.
for one god damn man. He remembers Castiel slouched against a couch some years before, blood dripping down his face as he stared up at Dean. He remembers the angel’s voice as he said
“Hell no, babe. You really think I know where that boy stashes his porn these days?” She shakes her head. “Name’s Muller,” she says, scooting across the bed to offer her hand. She’s wearing a variety of rings, he notices, and a studded cuff adorns her wrist. “You must be Castiel. Nice to finally meet you.”
Miriam’s eyes widen a little at ‘angel,’ but she doesn’t pause to address it. “That isn’t what I asked.”
Famine had been another desperate attempt to get Sammy back, another glaring failure on a list of similar misadventures, but for once the memory doesn’t even twinge. Dean is far too focused on making sure Cas knows what’s going on.
Dean opens his mouth, closes it, then opens it again. “Sure,” he says finally, though it sounds more like a croak, “but you aren’t gonna believe a word of it, lady.”
Dean nods, then forces himself to sit up and adds somewhat incoherently, “depends, are you trying to sacrifice yourself again?”
with the need to be touched, so he reaches down and starts to stroke himself, one leg cocked up so Cas can see.
“Oh, I don’t have a choice. This is my destiny.” The words are meant to be a joke; they roll off Dean’s tongue so naturally he doesn’t realize what he’s said until it’s already out between them. As soon as his mouth closes the truth explodes inside his head, the memories he’d pushed down until he’d convinced himself they no longer existed coming to life once more. He remembers his death book in Billie’s hand, the words on the page, the destiny he’d read that made no sense back then—back when he’d thought Michael was their greatest threat, that there's no way he would survive what they were facing.
There’s another crash, this time much heavier and accompanied by the skittering sound of broken glass bouncing across the floor. Sam and Cas turn as one to look at the source.
Food successfully diverts Dean from his defensive curiosity; Cas watches with amusement as he loads up on eggs, bacon, pancakes, a biscuit and coffee, apparently unaware of the suggestive gestures and amused faces Eileen is making behind his back.
is what breaks the tension. That’s what lets them stumble and laugh the mile and half back to their cheap hotel without incident or awkward silences.
“Fuck off yourself, jackass,” Dean replies. Instead of snapping back as Dean expects, Cas abandons the mess and stomps outside, leaving Dean feeling off balance and grumpy. They argue frequently, but it’s usually a toe-to-toe multilingual swearing match that ends in clarity and a beer, not… whatever this is.
He’s come while rolling before, but nothing like this. Before he would have said it’s a decent enough experience, but this time...he’s pretty sure he just met God and every single one of heaven’s angels, and found all of them lacking but one. White lights dance in his vision, and his overloaded brain starts to feel in colors for a bit, twisting spirals and fanciful mandalas dancing behind his eyelids as his body shudders through release.
, they say to each other silently. Routine, this part, albeit never easy; Dean nods agreement.  “Violet,” he says as carefully as he can, “are you able to show us where your son died?”
They have a full ranch spread for breakfast, sitting together in the airy breakfast nook that had been half the reason Dean insisted on
“I don’t deserve you,” Dean says, feeling dumb. He’s said it before, but Cas doesn’t seem to be getting the point.
He reaches out, his hands catching on the soft fabric of Cas’s sleeve and tugging him back. “Don’t go,” he says, he fucking
“Yes, Meg,” he concedes with a laugh that doesn’t sound nearly as nervous as he feels. The two women hoot as he turns to face his friend head-on, but he barely hears them over the roaring in his ears.
“Sometimes all it takes is a little help in the right direction,” she says, and, with the air of someone delivering a judgment, claps her hands three times.
“What’s going on?” he asks, dropping onto the couch next to his brother and nudging a cold beer into his hand. “Eileen is over the moon, but you’re acting like you’re at a funeral.”
“Nah,” Dean says. “This ain’t my first rodeo; I know what I can handle.” This time when he goes down he keeps going until his nose is buried in dark hair and Cas’s cock is cutting off his air. He swallows to prove his point and Cas
, and that’s it, that’s definitely his cue. As happy as Cas and Dean seem to be, Sam has no desire to stick around for any further brain-scarring events. “Congratulations guys,” he manages to get out, then flees for the relative safety of noise canceling headphones, a locked bedroom door, and a whole new set of issues to take into consideration for the future.
Whatever is out there doesn’t come any nearer, thankfully. Dean stands, stretches, then walks over to where Cas is lying cocooned in blue wool, his face vulnerable in slumber. Dean crouches to tuck a fold of fabric more securely around Cas’s shoulders. He squats there watching Cas breathe until his thighs cramp; then he stumbles back to the boulder to settle down with a sigh.
In the absence of torture, distration, or any real hope of escape, it’s easy for Castiel to fall into a sort of dream state and let his mind drift.
His surprise lasts only a minute. Then his face melts into a relieved smile and he props his hip against the sad excuse for a table. “Oh. You must be Sully’s friend?”
“Oh, honey,” Miriam visibly argues with herself for a moment before continuing, “does he know you love him, Dean?”
“Please tell me this isn’t a dream,” Dean begs, his breath warm on Castiel’s face. “Please, I can’t do this again.”
because Dean never had the cajones to push three little words past his teeth. It’s utterly absurd, yet the possibility that it may happen is horrible, a gut-punch worse than lighting Cas’s funeral pyre. This time it would be his fault,
Dean cracks open the beer and settles against the counter across from Cas, and a little to the side. “I’ve been worried,” he says in a neutral tone. “You should answer your phone sometimes.”
They meet Meg and Charlie at the Roadhouse that night to share their news. Meg immediately drawls “tell me something I don’t know, Winchester,” and Dean flips her the bird. Charlie squeals and insists on a group hug, then demands details about their romance, the proposal, and the wedding. Dean and Cas share a single horrified look before ad libbing answers as best they can. They talk for hours, it seems, and Dean is shocked at how easy it is to pretend the whole thing isn’t a giant sham.
The woman looks up from her reading. He thinks she might be Rowena’s size, perhaps a little larger. However, this woman has a thick cloud of black hair that bounces a little when she looks up, and a round face that splits into a wide, mocking smile when she meets his eyes. Hers are blue, too, he realizes, stunningly pale against brown skin.
His stomach feels like jelly, but he strides inside with his head held high and his shoulders squared.  He expects it to get dark, but as the cave opens into a corridor that dips sharply downward, he realizes the crystal walls are emitting a soft, steady glow that lights the space just enough for him to see. “I’m here,” he tells the air around him. “I’m coming for you, Cas.”
“I messed up.” The words are a whisper, but they have the force of a shouted prayer. “I’m sorry, Cas.” Remorse is bitter on his tongue. It’s not enough, and he knows it; there’s nothing he can do to make up for what he’s done. No way to undo it, even, not anymore.
He takes a drink of beer to help wash the food down, then clears his throat. “What are you getting at?” He asks carefully.
Cas’s mouth slides down to suck at his collarbone. his stubble and lips are in sharp contrast to one another and the combination is waging total assault on every last one of Dean’s fraying senses. Cas’s hands circle his hips, push aside his jacket and flannel, tug his T-shirt out of his pants and start fumbling at his belt.
He’s standing on the outskirts of a forest. There are endless rolling fields of tall grass blowing in a gentle breeze a little distance away in one direction, and in the other...trees. They start out sparse and thin, but they get bigger, closer together, and overridden by underbrush within a matter of feet. The trees themselves seem...odd. Not twisted or evil by any means; if anything, they’re lush and inviting. They’re a little too green though, the trunks a little too smooth for their size.
“Cas!” he hisses, then crouches and scrambles across the space between them to shake Cas’s shoulder. “Castiel, wake the hell up.”
There’s movement off to the side and Dean swings toward it, his hands scrambling for something, anything, to fight with.
He reaches for Cas, his hands bumping and fumbling until his fingers are buried in dark hair. “Please come home, sweetheart.” That gold soulmate bullshit inside him is so big and bright he can barely stand to look at it and it feels
“Do you have any idea how long I’ve loved you?” Cas whispers-laughs, the words blowing little gusts of air over Dean’s mouth that light him up from the inside out.  “And you’ve sat there this whole time thinking I
Somewhere along the way he gets distracted by warmth. At first it’s just in Dean: an odd spark where there shouldn’t be, growing a little stronger the more Castiel examines it. Then he feels an answering flicker inside his own vessel.
Metallica fills Baby as soon as Dean starts the engine. No one objects; Dean’s clearly not in the mood to talk, Sam’s shuffling through email on his phone again, and Castiel’s not certain he remembers how to form words. And so it goes, all the way back to their shoddy accommodations.
“Look at this,” he says instead, spinning the laptop with a little more force than strictly necessary.
The library has little of interest, the coroner gives him nothing he didn’t already know from Violet and Muller, and attempting to speak to the parents of the other victims turns out to be an exercise in emotional sadomasochism with so little return that he ultimately decides to leave it be.
It’s now or never, Dean knows that, but the plain truth is too big, too scary, to just say outright, so he hedges a little at first. “When humans want something really bad...they lie,” he says.
Dean’s chest twinges painfully and he winces, rubbing at it with his palm. Just his luck, his brother looks up at the movement, lifting one eyebrow in silent judgment. It passes quickly.
