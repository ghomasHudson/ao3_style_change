“Top gun? Really?” his smile wide,
"Oh yeah! Unless you're like Baal,"
Sam had woken up early, the night before he couldn’t hide what was happening to his wife anymore. She was a hunter herself, he knew she’d understand! But what worried him was the ominous feeling in her voice,
"Do I not get some cool tasks?" Booker called as they walked into the room with Norma at their heels, she waved at them before brushing past the group and into the kitchen to start cooking.
"I don't think you should be thanking me till you're a star athlete."
"Danny come on," she groaned, "you're so frustrating sometimes,"
A tense silence hung over her suddenly, Baal got to his feet. Clearing his throat, he placed a hand on Bailey's shoulder.
"Who the fuck do you think you are?" Mammon spat out, getting to his feet and placing the drink on the coffee table. He stood over Robin now,
He uploaded a picture of the selfie they took, placing it as the profile picture. He had taken a few artsy pictures of salt with Abel's bat, attempting to make it seem like some sort of promotional material for their "ARG" as Abel put it. Chamuel had spent the past few hours understanding, reading and watching videos on the subject of an ARG.
"You always say don't shut me out, but then you turn around and shut me out." Abel looked away from Chamuel, glaring out at the cars that were in front of them. Chamuel shook slightly from the anxiety in his system, he didn't have anything to say to that because he knew Abel was right as he attempted to self soothe himself. Rubbing his hands together as he tried to come up with what to say.
"As long as I have my Grace I'm basically safe," Chamuel said, leaning back into the lounge chair he had dragged out into the garage, shrugging. Though in the back of his mind he wondered if an anti possession symbol might be a good idea for him to get with how weak he felt.
They finally came to a large red door, the paint was chipped off in patches, a few claw marks on the bottom. Fritz knocked a few times, swaying back and forth. There was a soft shuffling before the door opened a little, a man with bushy curls on his head glanced out at the two before his pale Amber gaze settled on Israfil.
"Oh what a wonderful idea," she sang out,
Baal's face turned a shade of red, he blinked a few times as he found himself lost for words.
The blonde felt himself starting to calm down, refusing to meet the others eye.
"Dean," They both said at once, turning and racing back towards the room they had just run out of. Hahasiah and Dutch both looked shocked as the pair made for the stairs, swatting the cobwebs away as they fell in sync before pausing at the steps.
"I love you,"
"It's too bad we couldn't get any questions asked," Baal grunted as he heaved the man's body into the back of the home with Sam and Chamuel. The two followed behind Baal and Norma who directed them to where 'the perfect spot to bury a body' was.
Bailey felt as if she'd been punched in the gut with the others words.
"Shut up, we just finished,"
"You just…" Abel shook his head "I don't know, you seem off,"
"Well my Uncle might know, but he's on a mission and won't answer his phone,"
"You're siding with him?" Cain asked, tiling his head to the woman like an angry dog. She bit her lip, her mind attempted to find the correct words but she drew a blank as fear flooded her body.
Abel looked at the man with a surprised look on his face before a smile broke over his features.
She smiled at him, "You're a Campbell, you'll find a way," She murmured, pulling a small box from her sweater pocket. She handed it to the other who looked at her in complete shock as he flipped the top of the black, small box open. Inside were two wedding rings, they were old and made of pure gold.
"Yeah, A walk, I uh, I-I couldn't sleep. You know, it's just one of those days. Maybe I had too much sugar before bed, or had some sort of...o-odd reaction to…" she trailed off, running her fingers through her hair a few times in frustration.
"How does it work?"
As they zoomed towards the home a large pair of wings flew above than through the clouds, a video camera held in their hands as they recorded the car. A grin bright on their face, eyes glowing. Whispering to themselves, "That's four Adinkra found only one more to go, than the real fun begins,"
The sounds on the TV were second to the thoughts running through Abels head, tugging off his shirt the man tossed it onto the floor before rolling to his feet. Trampling his way towards the small fridge, he pulled it open, snatched up a soda and made back towards his spot on the couch. The scream on the TV didn’t capture his attention as he fell into the cushions, his high causing him to sail above the world. His body tingled lightly from the drugs racing through his system that caused his head to float off his shoulders.
"Stop," Abel yelled, his voice cracked as tears burned into his eyes. "That's Arphaxat, he's my...boyfriend,"
"Sleep under the stars!" Chamuel chuckled, watching as the hunter flipped out a pocket knife and made a few holes into the plastic tubes.
"Come get it, asshole!" Abel shouted, the monster charged him. Abel leapt out of the way only for butch to grab his leg just as he was about to vanish over the edge. Abel shouted in shock as he was dragged into the hole, grabbing the side of the pit.
"Alright, why are we going to town?" She asked, grabbing her leather jacket off the back of the sofa and tying her hair back in a messy bun.
"Justice," Fran whispered, "upright, it shines," he turned the card upwards to show the face of the warrior covered in gold with a crown up top of his head. The man turned it so it was upside down now, casting the warrior in a shadow of deep, angry holly green.
"Oh, let me see, I just need to verify,"
"Yes well, me and B-- Nahem,"
"Was it made of iron?"
"Hi Paul!" Israfil sang, grinning wide at the other. Donnie rested his head against Israfil and let out a sigh as the angel described what had happened. Going into great detail, mentioning the Adinkra's powers as well knowing Donnie kept his large family in on all their secrets.
"And? Is that not enough clothes?"
"I thought you did good," Arphaxat said, appearing beside him in the passenger seat. Causing the hunter to leap with surprise. The demons smile bright, pulling his glasses off and cleaning them before placing them back on the brim of his nose.
"Come on, not my teeth, I was able to keep them even when I was doing meth daily," He whispered, tears racing down his cheeks as he attempted to fight back. Wishing Danjal was here, he couldn't fight against the big men.
"Hello?" She said into the phone as the silence dragged on, the howl exploded around them again. Sam nearly dropped everything in his hands, 'Donnie!' he thought.
“Is it...dead?” someone asked. Murmurs rose around the bar.
Sam let out an exasperated sigh, running his fingers through his hair. Norma laughed at the doctor's terrible joke.
“Alright!” Abel slammed his phone on the table, the screen flashed a few times before the title screen showed.
"Unfortunately," he chuckled, shutting his eyes as he was told to do.
"Is...that a human tooth?"
"It said online all the deaths were strange," Chamuel pointed out as they made their way towards the front of the building.
He pressed his forehead to Donnie's and rolled his hands through the others fur, Donnie shut his eyes. The mix of the weed and his friend's presence caused his body to shutter. Slowly, the fur started to vanish and his body returned to its normal state. Donnie's forehead pressed against Israfil's as he returned to his human form, groaning inwards. His pants torn but holding strong, though his shirt had been completely ripped off he didn't seem to notice.
"Legit?" Abel whispered, shooting a glance at Chamuel who shrugged. Rooster pocketed the Chamulet,
"Do...you think he'll approve?" Donnie murmured, scratching at his cheek from the anxiety that pulsed through his veins.
"Cain used his own Adinkra," Abel pointed out.
"Faint, the bastard must have drugged him, God he smells like a brewery,"
Sam felt his heart drop, without thinking he reached his hand forward and put it over hers. The eye on his finger was opened, staring up at the night sky, up at her. She looked up at him, giving a small smile that lit up her features.
"Oh no way!" One of them shouted, "You can't just--"
Sitting up before the hunter could answer and pulling out his phone, he handed it to the other.
“You alright? Can you walk? Run?” Baal asked, Butch scramled to his feet and held out his hands, the chains clinked together. Baal snorted at them, the sound of racing footsteps could be heard rapidly approaching. His science experiment must not have done much. He grabbed at the chain with a hand, they sizzled against the man's skin. The bottom of Baal’s hands seemed to turn black before the chains exploded from the intense heat.
"You two are best friends, what the hell!" He gasped, Israfil got to his feet and made his way towards them. The howling wind made it hard for the angel to walk straight as it pushed against him.
"Close, but it's an old language. Spoken by the Pishacha, they're like little goblins."
The group left the busy city behind them, entering the large agricultural lands of New York. With rows and rows of bright green, yellow and orange stretched across hills in all directions. Cattle roamed lazily from place to place behind wooden gates, the bright early morning sunlight casting it's cold rays below. Winter was finally dying down, making way for the springtime.
Screaming in surprise the hunter dropped into the blackness.
"We need you to hurry up, this is taking too long. We wanted this done in...a month? Maybe two."
The two got back to Bobby's with no issues or police sniffing about, Abel parked the car quickly, scrambled out of his side and made for Chamuel. He helped the half asleep angel down from the car, letting the man lean on him as they made for the beaten up home. The air was freezing, pain sparked through Abel's body as the wind made contact with his skin.
Abel shrugged, “Your breath is going to break the gold down,” Chamuel teased,
"That's great!" Robin smiled bright now, running his hand on his yellow hoodie to get rid of the saliva.
"Sorry," Israfil murmured, "I'm Israfil,"
Cain sniffled softly at this, he didn't want to hurt anyone or anything. Yet here he was, holding a gun in his hands with his father beaming down at him. The large man pulled his hands away from Cain, the child let out a shaky breath and shot.
Mishka held the broken phone out, grinning at Sam,
"I think we might be able to make a deal, Mrs. Gunnr," he whispered with a wide grin on his lips.
"Oh your boyfriend is here too? Such a lucky girl," Chamuel snarled, Abel put his arm out in front of the angel to stop him. Staring daggers at the demon,
"Hey! No gays in the hallway!" Booker shouted playfully, causing the two to split apart. Abel flipped the doctor off with a grin, "Oh shit!" He pulled away from Chamuel,
“Couldn’t I just blame you anyways?”
The group sat in silence, Cain took a few pictures of the painting as well. Grinning lightly towards the prophecy.
"The two of swords, you have two roads," He said, pointing down at the card, "One path," He started "Leads to the sun," His finger traced the path on the card that led to the crown then allowing his finger to dance towards the more dark sword that led to the thorns.
Abel looked down at his feet, sharp pain flashed into his system as the demon shoved him.
Cain continued to breathe deep, he had pulled his own Adinkra out and stared at it with wide, confused eyes. The darkness should be that, dark. Yet somehow he had turned it to angels' grace, he didn't understand and where was Cherm? He felt the creature's presence but it didn't come to his rescue. He could always depend on the demon but now? He looked up at Mishka as she went down to him, racing her fingers through his messy hair and looking him over.
Abel looked at Chamuel with a surprised look in his gaze, "Cham, you can't, it's probably a trap,"
“Israfil?” Chamuel asked, surprised as he looked at the bright shirt the angel wore towards his smiling cheeks.
"Jacob and Esau," she murmured, "their father picked the names."
The flash went off sending the monster backwards in shock, screaming. Israfil fell to the cold water as the monster roared in rage, Donnie grabbed his friend and hoisted him up. The monster shriek as it towered over them, it's long, worm-like tentacles lashed out at them causing the men to step back and out of the way.
“Do you know anything about angels? We’re not all dresses and halos,” Chamuel pointed out.
Cherm moved from the man's shadow to stand beside him, smiling as he did so. None of the demons got up from their bowing as Cain swirled the dark liquid in his cup. Standing up he held the goblet to the skies, the demons slowly looked up at him with wide, hopeful eyes.
“It’s almost Halloween, do you really think you stand a chance? And the second it hits midnight, this entire town will be swallowed whole! Not only that, but I’ll have the Chamulet!” His voice sounded as if it belonged to multiple people at once of all gender, it spoke with a slight wheeze.
"I...hope not," He whispered.
"You okay, Angel?" Cain asked, hazel eyes glowing with an emotion the angel couldn't place.
"Come on! The wind didn't do that!" Abel huffed, pointing at the book. The phone camera moved from Abel to the book and back to Cham who was rubbing the bridge of his nose.
Baal returned to Sam a short time later, sitting down beside him, his fingers dancing over the letters on his screen.
Donnie sighed, sitting back in the seat as Paul and his wife ducked their heads together to chat. Her fluffy dark hair fell over his brother's face causing the man to snort out a laugh, the wolf rolled his eyes at this and moved his gaze back to Israfil.
"Hey Baal, good to see you," A lady said, holding her cigarette up as if it were a wine glass. Baal nodded towards her, pushing inside Sam looked in awe at all the kitchen supplies that suddenly came to view.
"Swnw?" Abel snorted, tilting his head at the word, letting it roll between his tongue. Israfil blinked at the King of Kings for a few heartbeats,
"Daddy," he whispered as the gun was shoved back into his arms, he stumbled and fell back into the gross water. Pain flooded his body as a rock jammed into his leg, he let out a yowl of pain.
He never had a friend aside from Amaryllis, who was less a friend and more a pawn in his scheme to reach the top. Perhaps it would be good to indulge, after all, his mother's rambling did tend to bring him down. Though he was certain this was a trick, he wanted to give it a shot regardless.
Abel smiled towards the other, checking his text. His smile fell as he brought up the screen shot of a text conversation between Morris and Chamuel.
"Six kings," Hahasiah replied, crossing her arms over her chest.
"That's just how my face looks,"
His phone buzzed, he wiped his face a few times before turning on the screen. A text from Obizuth,
He shouted loudly, leaping up and down causing Castiel to pull him off.
Donnie grunted and growled a few times, visions of the angel in his mind.
"We don't know what it is," Chamuel hollered back, the two continued down the tunnel attempting to not fall into the sickening black water. A thought flashed in the hunters mind, swallowing hard he turned around quickly. The monster roared, diving at Abel who pulled his small gun from it's holster. He had almost forgotten he had it attached to his hip before entering the home, holding it up now the way Sam had taught him. Saying a silent prayer to whoever was listening that the weapon wasn't waterlogged.
"I'm goin' to get so many views on this," Breaker murmured with glee flooding his voice but Danjal could only focus on one thing. An army. Cain's army. What did that mean? Why did they need an army?
Chamuel ignored him, scrolling through pictures of the museum on his phone before hopping over to the website. Shaking his head,
Chamuel groaned, curling into himself as fire blasted through his gut. Attempting to settle himself down, the sirens were getting closer.
"I..pushed him away," Chamuel continued, "I...think I messed up, cause now he's...mad. I don't blame him, I've...been a little weird about it all."
He sighed, his shoulders sinking. "I tried to help your father too,"
"Did you see? I'm a king!" Bailey said with her head up high despite the ominous feeling that they were somehow being watched.
"Motherly instincts,"
"It's odd," Hahasia said as she made her way to the door, glancing back at the two.
"Yes, Baal, this is holy land. You deserve to be able to walk on it,"
"What is this?"
"Yeah that's true, do you know how to work it?" Abel asked, pulling the necklace off and holding it to the brilliant moonlight that shone through the bay windows.
Laszlo laughed, "Eres todo un personaje, ¿No es así?"  ("You are a character, aren't you?") His eyes gleamed as he switched himself to English.
"Did you see that in a movie?"
"Why should I call Amaryllis 'they'? I don't think it's necessary,"
"Nothing," he cleared his throat, "I just tripped, fell down the stairs." He stepped away from the two, they watched him with puzzled expressions "it's not a big deal, guys, me and stairs just don't mix!" He laughed,
"The darkness and me, we are one," Cain said, holding up his arms in pure joy as the sludge clung to his legs and moved upwards. The glow on the necklace getting brighter as the deep, dark muck moved in and out of his skin. The demons stood now, going for the cups, each one taking a cup in their hands and downing the liquid.
"Are you...mad at me?" Chamuel asked, Abel refused to look at the angel. His heart still ached from the rejection he felt the night before, dancing his fingers through his hair he could feel the slick wetness of the oil on his palm.
A loud crack causes the pair to turn attention back to the game. Everyone around them cheered, Chamuel laughed as Abel yelled with the crowd.
"Holy hell," he breathed, practically shoving Abel aside as he leaned down to Chamuel who was sucking in air heavily, his face white as a sheet.
"We're lookin' that up 'morrow," Chamuel laughed as they pushed into the guest room. They both collapsed on the bed, laughing.
"Oh, that's a can of worms," she laughed, "you know that saying? My teacher always used to say it. It basically means that--"
"Just stop filming," Obizuth snarled as the tall, giggily demon grabbed Mammon's feet and started to drag him. Badger didn't move as he filmed the entire thing with a smile,
"Mammon? A trap? Hah! The guy's like a cartoon villain. He probably laid a few leaves over a hole in the ground,"
"Well, if I know Faith she did it on purpose,"
A blast of white exploded around Chamuel as he took into the air without a second thought, the pain falling to the back of his thoughts.
"I'm...so sorry," Robin whispered to the bull, placing a hand on its head as tears ran down his cheeks. The Adinkra glowed vivid now, Robin could see the darkness was starting to seep out of the animal on its own. He made a note of it, telling himself to call Abel about it. The darkness must have some sort of its own mind if it could recognize when it had been defeated in an attempt to keep itself alive.
“You coming?”
Sam flipped to a different channel, it also spoke of the darkness. Then another. And another. The darkness was all the news seemed to be speaking about.
Israfil pulled away from Donnie, smiling bright at the other. The werewolf placed a hand on the man's cheek and brushed his thumb over the other's warm skin, his heart skipped a few times.
"Let's make a deal," Arphaxat said, causing the older hunter to freeze.
“We don’t allow winchesters in here,” She said in a sing-song voice.
"Shut up, we're not going after Ancitif. Yet. We need to kill the next king before he gets his Adinkra,"
Chamuel felt his heart skip at this, looking down at his feet he glanced back up at Fran.
Robin didn't seem to need to think too long, reaching forward and pressing down on the button after a few short seconds. The box buzzed softly as if it were a radio stuck on static until a voice popped out. A woman, with a chipper tone.
“Are you tired?” Abel asked suddenly as they made for the car,
"I have a plan that might just get you your cruddy little amulet."
Tears continued to roll down his cheeks as his wings shuttered, tucking themselves back into his body before he even got to the floor. Robin felt himself fall but almost didn't care, he hadn't ever felt so exhausted in his life. Danjal caught him with a grunt, laughing as he did so. The crowd erupted into cheers as Robin felt darkness swamp his vision. He clung to Danjal, attempting to keep himself awake.
"Open up, it's us,"
"My car's tire is a little flat and I was hoping one of you," She leaned against the table, pushing her chest forward in a flirtatious manner.
“Well...we were flying,” Abel pointed out, “We can work this out later, we need to get outta here,” He picked his bat back up, shaking it out as he did so letting the blood splatter around them. Silently knowing the police were going to have a field day attempting to understand what had happened here.
“Well, we’re going to make this bat more...useful, for hunting, Follow me!”
The sky painted itself in reds and pinks as the two drove down the highway, Sam was busy texting his wife who was adamant about moving somewhere safe for a while. Sam wasn't even sure where she could go, with the Supernatural showing no fear anymore cases of demon attacks, werewolves, and vampires were spiking up all over the place.
"Wars scary, Chamuel."
It came out meaner than she intended but she could practically hear her mother cheering.
The angel didn't question this, pulling his phone out and tossing it to Abel. He linked his headphones to the other's phone quickly and hit the speed dial. Uriel answered without hesitation,
"We met Chamuel from SingersSalt! He's a real angel! (Not click bait)" the title read. Chamuel groaned, "I love the thumb nail," Chamuel said sarcastically.
"A leads a lead, Maverick,"
"And Sam Winchester was taken? This isn't a game. Tell me what you came to tell me," he turned his chair back around. Snapping his fingers a few times, causing the woman to splutter over her words,
"I'm in," He whispered, "They trust me, I'm going to need to stay here a few days. Get their trust fully, then we start phase one."
Abel was shocked by how sincere the man sounded, though the demon's presence still spooked him from time to time he wondered silently if he was judging the man too quickly. After all, he never met a demon. Maybe he was good and his negative energy was something he couldn’t control, and honestly, it wasn’t a bad name.
Pain flooded over the hunter as he collided with the black water, it was cold, thick almost. His back screaming in agony as he laid in the swallow muck, groaning outwardly. He was silently thankful for the minor cushion of the cold water, turning to his right he screamed in surprise. Leaping up and scrambling back, a human head grinning at him. Half of its skin had been heavily chewed on by large, sharp teeth, leaving a pure white skull. The other half was drowning in the dark waters, old skin peeling off the bone with the soft flow of the river.
"Shut up!" He laughed, playfully slapping the top of his friend's head. Donnie's eyes glowed at the others touch,
Cain glared at the hunter, he had his arms covered in the Christmas lights that wrapped themselves around his body. Abel started to do the same for his own. Wrapping the smaller, sharp looking bulbs around his arms and torso, after searching they came across a few batteries in another box, it took a few different tries before finding batteries that weren't dead.
Chamuel chuckled, getting to his feet and grabbing the other. Pulling him into a tight hug, Abel laughed at this. His head fit in the crook of Chamuels neck.
"You trying to fight us, look buddy, we just want his necklace and money and we'll leave,"
Abel pushed into the unused guest room, throwing his jacket off with a low groan before sitting on the bed. He felt numb, nothing felt real. It was as if he was stuck in his dreams with Arphaxat but he was in the waking world, right?
"Hey Bails! What's cracking?"
“Me either,” Sam confessed, "and for it just to...show up on your camera like that? That's...really strange,"
Abel took in a few breaths as he tried  to calm the swirling panic in his mind, staring at the spot the other stood only seconds ago.
"It'll give us a good chance to look around," Robin replied with a shrug, Danjal glanced back to the gate that let out a soft hiss and opened up before them. Robin pulled off his hoodie causing the butterfly to flutter lazily away, tying it around his waist before the pair made their way into the ranch.
"You don't drink, right? But you smoke?"
"I'm Sam," Sam said, "Winchester,"
"I'm sorry Buster…" he murmured, running his fingers over the bloody fur.
"Get out of here Ancitif," Danjal whispered, "if I die the family needs you to guide them,"
“Abel!” Donnie's hand was on his back, Abel groaned inwardly, shaking now.
Donnie nodded, Abel didn't argue. Something was wrong but he didn't have the knowledge to know what,
“Yeah, same number,” He replied, pulling his phone out of his pocket.
"Robin?" Danjal whispered, making his way to the other and sitting beside him. He was looking down at his phone before moving his gaze to Danjal, the others blue eyes shone like the stars above sending another ripple of warmth through the larger demon. What was wrong with him? Robin was always at the center of the mans mind, even when he dated Merlin. Though she also graced his mind often when they dated he understood why she broke up with him. The intense desire to find and protect Robin often got in the way of their relationship which was frustrating to the large man. After all, he wasn't into men. Right?
"That reminds me, stop trying to kill him! I'm trying to get his soul and you shoved him off a building,"
"That hurts Abel, I didn't want to be eaten by dogs."
"You need to go back, staying down here isn't helping you,"
"What," Chamuels voice hardly heard as a look of horror entered his gaze.
"Stop sending me nudes," She snarled, causing the demon to grin wider, "They're not mine,"
Donnie continued to scream into nothing, cursing God, Faith. He hated them both. They had told the only person who made him feel alive that he didn't matter and now, he was gone.
The hunter groaned, rubbing his forehead as he tried to understand what was happening.
“He just vaporized her!” She practically shouted at Ancitif,
"As long as he doesn't taste human blood I can fix him," he shouted to the wind, pushing past the innocent.
Abel shushed the man, racing his fingers through his hair. Bailey watched them with a puzzled look, she glanced down at the painting.
Baal chuckled, "Yeah well, I know you're thinking all us demons are these...terrible beings, and it's mostly true, but there are exceptions to the rules."
Chamuel went to follow only to be blown back, the camera collided with the floor loudly.
"Weren't you angry at me?"
"Oh it!" Chamuel was already powered up, using his light to rip the blackness from the others skin yet it didn't seem to budge only bulging out a sickening sucking noise.
"You should join our pack!"
Arphaxat smiled now, making his way to the other.
"Unfortunately, I can't seem to escape you,"
"Fuck off, I aint in love with nobody," Danjal snarled out
"No! No...I...guess I never really fell in love before?" He groaned, attempting to not harm the man's feelings. After all he did all this amazing stuff for him.
"He's what?" Spitting the words out like venom.
“What the hell!” She shrieked,
He looked down at Chamuel who had, at some point, fell asleep beside him. He felt a prickle of anxiety at what the demon said in his dreams but pushed that to the back of his mind. Opening his phone to check their twitter he was met with swarms of people messaging them.
"Oh! That reminds me!" Donnie said as he got to his feet, Israfil followed without question.
"Cain, come home. Eve is demanding to talk to you," Amaryllis said, he could hear his mother shouting in the background. Cain frowned deeply, he wasn't usually gone this long from his mother. He looked at Mishka who returned the look, tilting her head to the side in a confused manner.
"It's not stupid! How would you have kids though?"
"Maybe," he whispered, "I don't know," guilt filled his veins, was Lucifer after her because of him?
"Can you imagine? Ancitif fighting beside Born Again, piles of once evil creatures behind me. My hair flowing in the wind!"
Abel scoffed, punching the other lightly as the two men made for the front door. Abel couldn't remember the last time he had felt such a strong, deep sense of agony that ached in his chest and rolled down to his legs. He swore, as they left the home behind and walked out into the dying sunlight, he heard his heart shatter. Yet being with his brother made him feel a touch better, it filled a hole in his chest he couldn't describe. For once, he felt close to his family.
"We'll show them who the real king is, don't worry," Cain murmured into the cold air. The promise of snow covered the skies above, thanksgiving was coming up quickly, bringing a cold front with it.
"We're born again!" He shouted, "this is our matter!"
"Did you want something?"
He hesitated, not wanting to take the two back to his place in case the demons had any type of tracker on them. Deciding against stopping at home he drove them out of the town, going the opposite way. He knew he had to drop them off somewhere and uber back home, he had to do some research.
Jasira flipped her off, howling into the air the group turned and charged away. They let out yaps of laughter as they went, kicking up dirt with the large hooves of their horses. Gretchen rolled her eyes, running her fingers through her hair. A few of Gretchen's employees had made their way to the small girl, helping her down and looking her over.
"Well, what good are you?" Abel teased, winking at Chamuel which sent a rush of warmth into his chest.
Bailey groaned, letting her head fall to the pavement in defeat. The Pishacha laughed, causing her to get up, pointing a finger at the monsters.
"Keep the change," the man beamed at them before going to make their order.
"Yeah? I...guess you're pretty cute," Abel laughed, looking uncomfortable as Arphaxat led him across the dance floor as though he were wearing a dress. Dean could see the frustration of being treated in a feminine manner clear on Abel's features.
The air got tense as the angel looked back to his phone, Abel regretted bringing it up again.
He stumbled slightly, Fritz nearly jumping out of his skin when the angel knocked into him.
"You okay, Issy?" Donnie murmured,
"Get away from the doors!" Bailey shouted at the people around her, they gasped as she practically shoved them backwards.
"And a Winchester,"
"I'll call you later, Abe, just-- if you need help I'm only a few hours away,"
The woman chuckled, leaning down and snatching the dirty dollar from her friends hand.
Abel shot up causing Chamuel's heart to stop, the hunter scrambled to his feet.
"We are Winchester bloodline, that makes us even more King than before" Cherm whispered.
“Hey man! What’cha got on tap?”
"Is he coming back?" Cain whispered, slipping behind the other. He never felt so humiliated but his brain didn't seem to care as panic flared at the thought of seeing the man. Memories washed over Cain's mind causing him to shiver as if he was cold, Abel leaned on the man as an attempt to bring any form of comfort.
"It's clear, whoever it was ran," Cain whispered to the other, using his elbow to smash in more of the glass. It twinkled in the light that came from the small room, falling down to join the lost golf club.
Her breath coming out raspy, chest falling up and down in a slow motion. The doctor eyed her for a few extra seconds as the gears in his head turned before placing a hand on her forehead.
He shot her an evil look, "I like his soul!" The demon hissed.
Abel scrambled up, his wet hair plastered to his forehead, “I’m alive!” Abel shouted, with a quick movement of his arm he showered the creature in the salt. It screamed in agony, stumbling away from Abel with a roar. It’s blood showered the floor below,
"...No," Uriel finally said, dipping his head, "We...we don't know what can stop what's coming. We...only certain angels were blessed with that knowledge, and the last one alive is in the Chamulet."
"We are that's where we're going!" She leapt up, causing Baal to follow.
"I'm guessing you don't know what Paishachi is, do you?"
"Baal, come on, I won't let Chamuel blast you. We need to go, we told Abel we'd meet them in an hour," Sam pleaded, standing up from the bed and holding his hands out.
"Donnie! I'd have been in first!" Mishka squeaked, shoving the other playfully.
“What is it?” Abel asked again,
"We're not police, ma'am. We're FBI, and our set of rules are just a bit different," Theo held up his badge, special agent Theodoric Rose. Dagmar held hers up as well, special agent Dagny Marshall.
"Sure!! Think of me as your arranged friend,"
Chamuel and Abel listened numbly as the two spoke, describing the events that had taken place the night before. They asked the hunters a few additional questions before standing and leaving the motel room. Abel leaned against his friend, removing his hand from under Chamuels, they sat in silence for what felt like hours.
They laughed into the air as they raced through the church and out the door, leaving a large sigil on the brass bell. The couple hopped over the fence at rapid speed, taking off towards the park and back to Norma's house. Sam couldn't recall the last time he felt so alive! Even fighting didn't have this type of feeling, this feeling of excitement, as he looked towards her he couldn't keep the joy that surged into his body down.
Abel didn’t fully believe the angel but he bought him something?
"I know Abel, but I can't,"
Butch let out an inhuman roar, his body mutated, shuttering, his skin crawled with thin blue veins that raced into the mans arms causing them to explode outward. Large muscular tissue expanded from the other's body, showering the brothers in blood. A deep, rich, black fur rolled up the man's arms stopping just before his chest.
"Angel whisperers?" Abel piped up
"Me and my brother helped you!"
"But why?"
"Alright," Abel brushed his hands on his coat as he slammed the trunk of the car closed. Chamuel blinked a few times, he felt war practically purr with joy at seeing the hunter.
"I can't believe that, who would reject you?" Arphaxat sat up now, looking down on Abel with bewilderment.
The demonic owl stood a few inches shorter than the hunter but his glowing red gaze didn't leave Bailey.
Abel relaxed now, his body going still as Chamuel filled him with much needed dopamine to calm his restless nightmares. Since he met Abel he could see the internal war being waged inside him, brushing some of the man's hair from his face Chamuel got to his feet yet again. He could handle the negative emotions, the painful anxiety, even the deepest depression. It was what he was originally created for, yet, for whatever reason, seeing the man in such great agony hurt him more than he was prepared for. Shaking off the thought as he dizzily made for the restroom.
"Holy shit!" Sam breathed, "what the hell were those?"
Israfil laughed at this, getting to his feet with a small yawn.
"Yes baby," She murmured, making her way over to the doctor. Tears rolled down his cheeks as she wrapped her arms around him, hugging his head to her chest and kissing the top of his head a few times. He clung to her, nearly crushing her as he hugged her. He started to sob into her chest as she held him, sitting down beside him and allowing the man to break down. She pet his head lightly, rocking him slowly as if he were a child.
Abel let out a yowl of pain, leaping upwards with wide, confused eyes. Chamuel's heart stopped, one of Abel's pupils was giant while the other was the size of a pin prick.
"I'm trying to find my friend," Israfil said, sitting on the couch next to Fritz while Convel sat in front of him on an old coffee table covered in cigarette butts.
"If-- mother sees Abel and decides he isn't fit for king I will return to my path. I...just need time," he whispered, smiling at the message from Mishka.
"Wait, we can't just go up stairs and steal a painting,"
"think about it, what kind of crazy luck that you quit drinking, got off drugs, happened to move to New York to buy an ugly lizard, only to be dragged into the middle of this with the other demons and you're the only good one.
"Hey," Bailey called to him, she was standing by the wooden altar with her arms crossed over her chest.
"Jacobson!" Chamuel called after her,
"Let me guess, you had a boring white people wedding?" Bailey challenged with a playful note in her tone, Sam snorted and grinned down at her.
The angel's grace had faded but he felt as though he could run a hundred miles as he pelted himself towards the janitor. The necklace around his neck glowing a soft shade of gold as he held his arms back, with all his might he swung the bat smashing the janitor against the side of the wall. The monster squealed in agony as the sharp silver spikes ripped its skin apart, blood fell to the floor, covering Abel as he stood his ground.
"Are ya'll both demons?" She asked with a tilt of her head, smiling at them.
"We need to leave," Abel said quickly, he snapped a few more pictures before. Glancing up at the wall he held his phone up, taking a quick picture of what seemed to be art on the stone. His phone flashed, panic exploded through his mind when the dark eyes of a creature glared down at them. Its head shaped like a goat, large wings pushed against the wall, It let out a loud, inhuman scream causing Abel to gasp in surprise. Stumbling backwards and nearly falling off the structure, Chamuel snagged him by the jacket at just the right time, pulling him from the edge.
"What about all the people out there that need us? And Sam? Butch! Even Mishka," Abel asked, a troubled look on the man's face.
"Well," Abel murmured, "I got these texts today, basically saying Cham didn't like me. Ya'know, he was talking to a friend and...well, he called me...childish, and I just…I was going to tell him when we got back. But I don't know now,"
He made sure to speak calmly, deepening his voice to sound more powerful. He could hear her hesitate,
"You ever think about the fact that we, somehow, got the names Cain and Abel?" The hunter asked the doctor, using the golf club to whack down large vines that sat in the way. They walked, knee deep, in muddy water that smelled awful. The world around the pair covered in bugs, trees, and smoke of different colors and densities. The bugs in the bog raced against his ear as they walked, attracted to the lights that blinked lazily around the brothers arms. Many of the bulbs had broken from the running and fighting, Abel felt as if he was going to snap at any second as he continued to swat down the leaves around them.
“Baal, are you feeding the strays?” Sam could hardly believe his eyes as the cats willingly took the food from the demon,
"He's one hell of a hunter, I haven't seen him for ages,"
Rapidly the sludge swallowed him, his screams filled the air as he vanished into the darkness. It was like a switch, the second he had been eaten the rest of the crew didn't have time to react as the sludge exploded outwards. Bathing everyone around it in it's blackness, digging into their skin, causing panic screams to cover the room around the hunter. The screen went to static only a heartbeat later, Sam stared with wide eyes, he felt a tear race down his cheek as fear plugged deep into his core.
"stop stop," Dutch put a hand out, she scrambled to her feet, "We need to leave, Bailey you guys have to get out of here." She grabbed a sheet of paper and scratched something onto it with a pen. Bailey got to her feet,
“Yeah, like, a shopping center or whatever,”
"Why does everyone say that?" Abel shouted after him as the pair pelted upwards.
"God's also trying to shut us down, did you see that?" She nodded her head to the gravesite on the opposite side of them. It was small, mostly for show, with a few old tombstones that someone had stolen and placed there at some point.
"I don't need a couple of Winchesters making fun of me," Baal growled, glaring at Sam who patted him on the back.
"I'm not sure," Baal admitted, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly, "but Chamuel...he has more grace than any angel alive currently. He's far more powerful than we could ever imagine,"
"Yeah, he's smart. He's a lot like his father," the demon whispered, causing the group to murmur to one another again. Their voices were concerned, fearful.
"No! Not at all," He spat out the words as though he were disgusted by them, freezing in his place. Racing his hand through his hair, letting it rest on his neck, rolling his head back a bit.
"She's been talking to the demons all day, what's happening?" They asked as the two made their way down the steps of the fancy apartment complex and towards the man's car. The demon radio wasn't as talkative as the angels, it was odd to hear them so often. The bigger the darkness grew, the more they talked. It sent a chill of excitement through Cain.
Abel paced back and forth now, bringing a lit cigarette to his lips as he listened to Uriel's explanation. The entire thing seemed to go on forever as he listened — Sam and Dean fighting demons, dying over and over, heaven, hell, it was making his head spin as he tried to collect a single string of thought.
Ancitif swallowed hard but his shaking stopped as he looked at the Adinkra. It was the shape of two hearts, one heart upside down and the other right side up. The humps of the hearts pressed together, curling inward.
"He saved Dad's life!"
“Haven't you heard the phrase 'close but no cigar?'.”
"This place is like a camping group for hippies," Baal chuckled as they came up to a pink camper. It looked as if it had rolled out of the eighties, with it's metal frame, odd shape and rusty edges. A shag carpet was laid out in front of the small trailer, it was as pink as the moving home with an awning stretched over a couple of plastic chairs.
"I'm not," He grunted, "Not yet."
“I did, I was given another chance.” he replied bluntly, turning towards the man behind him before setting eyes back to the long haired hunter,
Everyone's eyes turned to Israfil, even Abel looked to the angel.
“And those wings!” Marshall breathed, staring up at the angel with wide crystal blue eyes. Causing the angel to feel his face turn red from the attention, rubbing the back of his head awkwardly.
Cain's eyes opened to the waking world around him, he had found a small patch of dried surface to sleep on. Babs curled up against his chest, the rabbit's soft fur tickled his nose. He blinked the dream away a few times, sitting up and looking around him in frustration. It was so dark, the vines slapped him in the face causing him to swat at them.
She shook her head at this, "What are you? 'I feel there's a story here'! You and your little boyfriend have seen too many Disney movies," she laughed, Danjal felt a flash of heat flood him at the others words.
"I love you, Cain,"
"Are you texting Abel?" She asked with an arched eyebrow, "Cain's taking him to see Eve after the eclipse."
Chamuel went to his knees, attempting to calm the storm inside him. Sucking air in as if he had run a few miles,
The car raced forward causing the two men to fall back to the floor with a yowl.
Israfil drummed his fingers against his leg, "I...know Faith picked you,"
"Yeah, sorry, just allergies,"
"Why...did I get paired with him if War was just--"
"Hey!" She spat at another child who scoffed at it, his dark hair flopped greasily over his eyes, his shirt a few sizes too small for his frame as he looked over the paper.
"We are suddenly blessed by the Gods with great power," She sang out, her light brown skin and long, straight brown hair seemed to simply glow with her words, "We are to take The Grotto for ourselves, tomorrow, we will show 'em there can only be one true ranch in this town!"
"Baal's...been seen around her a lot," She said with a shrug,
"Thanks Goose,"
"He was sapping your grace, right? He can't do that anymore," Bailey mused, "so it won't work, right?"
"But wouldn't that destroy Earth, too?" Israfil whispered,
"But--"
Sam looked positively shocked at the other, the candy he'd been eating had dropped to the floor and fallen through the large gaps in the wooden boards. He looked exhausted, with hair tied back and his hands covered in red marker.
“Abel stop it!” Chamuel whispered, “Be nice, he’s just a kid,”
Sitting up he turned on his phone, he and Chamuel promised not to check on their account till the morning.
"I don't smoke much," He confessed, "Is that what tipped you off?"
Abel gasped softly, panic exploded in the mans head. His mind reeled back to Arphaxat sending a rush of adrenaline into his system. He shoved the other off, Chamuel sat up with a puzzled expression on his face as he was shoved away.
Robin wanted to inform her that this wasn't a romance novel, he and Danjal had a real mission and were in danger but he couldn't help himself from fantasizing about it. If they weren't in a life or death fight for the Earth, if they didn't have to find Bohdi, if Danjal would ever like him back.
Chamuel looked at the other puzzled, "What? Are you taking me to the woods to murder me?"
"Uh--"
“When Iggy first got this guitar his dad carved that into it, said it was important or something,”
"Oh, I didn't know," Cain lied, rubbing the back of his neck as if he were a little embarrassed with himself, "I was wondering what those comments were about,"
He kicked Arrow's sides lightly, sending the horse racing a few paces faster than the woman. She growled deeply, her skin shuttered with fur as she snapped her teeth towards him.
"Where are we going?" Israfil asked, his eyes bright as they walked past the dark homes that sat tall against the vibrant deep purple skies above, moonlight painted their path as if guiding the men onward.
"I better not be getting sick," She hissed to herself as she stepped into the waking world. It was incredibly early in the morning but this didn't bother her, her only thoughts on Cain. She had to find him somehow, groaning inwardly she knew she'd have to go back to Norma's eventually to get help from her friends. She shoved her hands into her pocket, pulling out a vile of herbs and debating on posting about them somewhere but decided against it. If someone saw it that wasn't on their side it could make her a target.
"It'd be a shame if someone found out you're love for Juliet," She said to him, Robin's jaw dropped.
"Abel, do you have your bat?" Chamuel asked, feeling power pulse under his skin, the palms of his hands glowed against the darkness. Brightening the area around them with a tint of pink light.
"Sorry," He chuckled, putting the beer down on the counter beside Baal.
With that the wolves collected themselves together, pelting towards a path hidden by more sharp, thorny flower bushes leaving Bohdi with two other wolves who started to untie and usher him into the barn behind them.
The room was empty, blinking in surprise the hunter felt a rush of fear only for it to diminish. He’s probably with Chamuel or on the pot or something, Sam smoothed his hair down as he closed the door behind him. Checking the restroom but no luck, he made down the steps to the second floor and went to Chamuels room, the door was ajar which caused a prickle of anxiety to kiss the tips of sams fingers as he grabbed the knob, shoving it opened lightly.
Abel collapsed into the room, his body falling through the unseen opening of the wall. Sucking in air, a raw red line burned into the hunters neck where pressure had been applied by the rope.
"If you ask me," Fran mused, not looking at the other as he spoke, "you're far stronger than those other people,"
Chamuel hesitated, the words on his lips but he was fearful. He still didn't fully understand his own feelings, if they were his, his vessels? Were they real or was it something he was forcing himself to feel? He recalled the day they met, the feeling of being struck by lightning upon seeing the other. It was as if the world stood still, he wasn't afraid to step forward and speak to the man.
"Is something wrong Chamuel?"
"You're Singersalt!" Mavis shouted out, getting to her feet, "How did my dad hire you guys? I mean, your special effects are pretty cool but you're not real ghost hunters!"
"No, I was a little busy not trying to be eaten," Sam replied, attempting to keep the frustration from his voice.
She opened her eyes to the light above, they had been standing on a trap door. He was smiling down at the two with a glint in his gaze,
"I don't know," She admitted, "Maybe to have my kids back?"
Castiel hesitated, "Dean has disappeared,"
"So I...did my whole romantic gesture thing and I--" He shuffled lightly, Arphaxat moved himself closer to Abel so their arms touched.
Mishka followed behind Cain, she felt a touch nervous since she wasn't exactly close to the doctor. He had yelled at her the night before but something told her there was more going on under the surface, she didn't take it to heart especially after the night he spent with them.
"Danjal, don't! He just wants a fight!"
His voice cut off, Kurty flashed in front of his vision for a few rapid heart beats. His dead body drenched in freezing water, the only thing that saved Abel from death. The crushed body of the man he called his brother under him.
"And you said you're Hahasiah?"
"Hey good looking" he joked, only to let out a started Yelp as the creature appeared behind him. Swinging his bat he connected it with the wall,
"I'll go," Cain said simply, placing his coffee down on the table.
"We all...have our traps I guess," Cain murmured, sipping at the cold water. It felt good in his parched, raw throat.
"How...did you even know it was missing?" Bailey asked, getting to her feet. Bodhi didn't turn to look at her as he spoke, "Fran," he whispered.
Donnie watched in awe as his halo shone bright, hundreds of eyes opened under the angel's skin that sent shivers through the hunter's body.
"The loss of the children is terrible," he continued, stopping in front of them with a smile.
Cain hesitated, he felt as if the group was suddenly against him despite saving Donnie who leaned against Israfil on the floor. The man didn't look well, his dark skin paler than usual and his body shuttered but he insisted he was alright.
"I'll get the tweezers," Abel chuckled, standing up and running his fingers through Chamuel's hair. It was sticky from the water under the house, Abel didn't understand how an entire water system was under the small building but he felt that was something he'd learn about later.
"A little trick I learned, once Michael and Lucifer fight and he comes down to hell, the next part will start. Now give me your Adinkra," she whispered into his ear. He opened his jaw to speak but a scream escaped his lips instead, the middle of his chest sat a blob of demonic energy. It was slowly eating the skin, turning his chalky white color to grey.
"Is everything alright with you, Daniel?"
"Probably the same as a ghost," he whispered as he flipped the page, only to find it had been ripped from the spine.
"Do you trust me?"
"Drink drink!" The man shouted at his followers, Baal landed on the ground with a loud bang. Bailey hopped off him, swatting the cups away from the nearest innocent who gasped.
"Not at all, I love cats," Robin whispered, leaning down to roll his fingers against the animals back. Cherry rubbed her head against Robin's palms, purring softly at the touch. Danjal found himself staring at the archer, why was he stuck staring?
"What happened?" She asked,
Abel scoffed, “No offense but you look like a math teacher,”
"What happens if his soul is taken?" The moth asked, tilting his head at the other.
With that she stood, glancing over the Savannah of Africa. From here, she could hear the sounds of music. The roar of a lion. She walked away from the corpse, a smile on her face as she vanished into the darkness. She'd return. But not until the darkness grew with the power of Angels grace.
"you gotta hear my plan!" Iggy retorted, joy buzzed in the teens voice,
"I didn't volunteer for this so I could bath in horse shit,"
Abel stared at Arphaxat, he wasn't sure what to think but his head swam with possibility. He knew the group wouldn't be happy to know he was with Arphaxat again but the other demons were reformed, the idea of having a normal life as a cisgendered person was something he silently wished for every night before bed. Especially recently,
"Don't worry, Romeo, I ain't gonna flirt no more," She chuckled, trotting slowly towards Danjal.
A snap could be heard all around them as the hell hound fell to the floor in a heap. Unmoving.
“Stop it, man!” he snarled, “I’m fucking tired,”
'Ink gun: Shoots a perfect devil's trap anywhere, anytime, no mess!'
Donnie watched the angel with a broken heart, 'I'm not like Abel, I'm not destined for great things or a soul mate,'
"What?"
Now he stood in front of the terminal with his hands in his pockets as he awaited for Baal to come pick him up. The loud roar of planes taking off was ear shattering to the man who wasn't incredibly big on wearing headphones despite Abel's constant bellowing about how 'amazing' wireless earbuds were.
The group walked up a flight of stairs, turning into an open window and climbing down a chimney that led seemingly nowhere before they landed in the muddy water of the swamp.
"Cain, my king, have you come around?"
"She's tryin' that new hair care technique!" He laughed, the crow seemed to enjoy this too as it flapped its wings in glee.
"So…" Abel started, biting his lip, "I was born a girl,"
"Hi babies, hello!" Chamuel said in a squeaky high voice, Abel felt the fire in his chest ignite. It rolled over his bones, smiling wide at Chamuel. Baal chuckled, eyes moving from Abel and Chamuel and back.

"Got it, Boss," She hung up, he pocketed his phone as Norma pulled into the garage. The sun had dipped away almost completely now, the full moon rose quickly.
“Shooting ghosts huh? I’m starting to think this is all real,” Abel chuckled nervously, handing the shell to Chamuel who held it to the light as if he expected to see through it. Sam ignored Abels comment as he took the shell from the angel.
Robin blinked and glanced back to Norma who was leaning against the counter of the kitchen with remote in hand, the strong smell of food filled the room as she cooked. They'd been waiting an hour now for the group to return but so far no one had returned causing the archer to feel a few shots of anxiety.
"Bacon?" Cain whispered,
"Stop yelling at me," He cried out, "You know I hate that,"
“Yes Mr. Knight?”
Baal nodded slowly but continued to stay quiet, causing Sam to drop his arm dramatically to his side.
A shot of anxiety flashed through him as he pulled it out, the blue light turned his eyes to silver as he looked down on the message.
"And I will come right back and bust down anyone's door with you to get Cain back, alright?" He placed both hands on her shoulders, giving her a small smile of reassurance.
Chamuel blinked back the frustrated tears in his eyes as the group watched the home smolder. He was so frustrated, he wanted to scream. Why had he snapped at Abel?
"My name is Chamuel," He said to the camera, "And I'm an angel of war,"
"Blessed, Cherm."
"Issy, I...I think I know what's happening," his voice is deeper than usual. He grunted painfully, sitting himself up in the bed. Israfil followed the action, tilting his head.
Everyone hesitated, "sit down," Abel said with a nod to his friends. They all did as they were told. Chamuel made sure to sit close to where Abel stood, eyeing Rooster as if he expected the man to attack.
Bailey's eyes grew wide as she noticed the solo cups they held, even a few children seemed to be gripping the cups tight as they shook with fear.
"Some kind of flower," He mused, though he was curious about what it was as well. Breaker pulled his phone out, snapping a few pictures of himself in front of them while he winked at the camera. Danjal gasped, pushing himself against his friend to join in on the selfies. The pair forget their mission for a few heartbeats only to be harshly reminded of the reality at the sound of a painful scream.
“Fuck you, bitch,” He spat, the cursing caused Abel to look up at him in terror,
The three ducked into the home without another word, the strong smell of old weed and incense flowed from inside of the apartment like a cloud. Israfil felt anxiety in his feet as he looked around. The apartment was tiny, a small kitchen settled beside the door with pans everywhere, trash scattered along the floor. Past that was the living room with an old, stained couch, a large flat screen and a few old gaming systems. Beer cans littered the shaggy carpet under his feet.
“Who’s next?”
Dutch grinned at her friend, flicking the cigarette to the floor and stepping back into the small camper.
Abel's throat felt dry, his mother's line was the odd one out. He silently wondered about her family tree, what would he find?
"Kill them!" He roared out, the bodies started to shutter around them again.
"Look, I wasn't stalkin' you," Baal huffed, "least, not the way you think."
"Of course! They don't call me 'Eligos the discoverer' for nothin'" The man snorted, placing his glasses back on his face. The two demons surrounded the man as he fiddled with the large suitcase, punching in a code into the electronic key that was wrapped around the front to prevent anyone from getting inside.
Baal blinked away his shock at the beautiful home, moving the bike closer to the keypad so Sam could do his thing. The gates let out a whine as they pulled themselves open, it reminded Sam of entering a cheesy horror attraction at a theme park. The two drove up to the top, Sam noticed the Impala was parked in a garage a few inches from the front door, beside the garage was a large van that looked like a good mix of a weather van and the Mystery Machine in scooby doo. With it's large back end, a skylight opening that held a radar of some sort beside it.
Abel felt Chamuel lace their fingers and for a few seconds he debated on holding on tighter as he looked up at the other. The warmth in Chamuel's gaze caused the hunters face to turn hot,
"Cham I gotta, you'll bleed out,"
Abel looked at his boyfriend than to his friends, "...What the fuck is 'The Grotto's'?"
"How are we going to find this tiny thing? It's like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles,"
"No! You can not use our bathroom. I am not cleaning it," Hahasiah replied.
Cherm roared angrily at him, "You've made the wrong choice!" Cain didn't feel the beast enter his body but he heard a loud pop, hiss and the tunnel vision closed in on him.
Chamuel looked shocked at the burst of power that hurt his friend but he didn’t have time to think about it as the black sludge fell from their hosts. Leaping at Chamuel now causing the Angel to blast a few away from him.
"But down, it's covered In shadow,"
"Get out!" He roared, Cherm melted into the man's skin fully now. Turning his caramel flesh to black. The man fell to his knees as the darkness started to take him over, Mishka felt tears racing down her cheeks as she skipped past him and grabbed the door handle.
"Abel,"
Cain nodded in understanding, leaning against the tree as well. Glancing up at the darkness above, he silently wondered how all this was possible. He knew Arphaxat was part of it all but he couldn't believe the demon was able to do all of this, on top of that, to allow danger to come to him was unacceptable.
"Look, if he kept it a secret maybe there's a reason," Abel pointed out.
"Y-yeah?" Abel asked, pulling his mask back down.
"Kurty!" He shouted at the man on the cross, watching in horror now. It wasn't Kurty on the cross anymore, it was himself. He wore a crown of thorns, thick blood racing down his forehead.
"Did you hear me?"
"I'm going to have to call you back," he said quickly into the phone. Hanging up on her the man pelted up the steps without another thought. Norma ran behind him as he made for the door and grabbed the handle, throwing it open with wide eyes.
"No? What's that?" He whispered, sniffling.
He didn't fight her, submitting to the woman. She asked him a few light questions, but he mostly replied with one word answers. His leg bounced as she continued to work,
"Why are you making dinner? Isn't it...almost midnight?"
Chamuel arched an eyebrow at the words, playing them in his head for a few short breaths.
Dutch's voice caught her so off guard she nearly dropped the watch, scrambling with it for a few seconds until catching it tight to her chest.
Chamuel laid his head against the cold window of the small truck, seated in the back while Cain and Baal chatted in the front about the 'monster house' as Cain continued to call it. His mind thousands of miles away, he wanted to be in the Impala but he didn't want to get into whatever talk the pair had to have. He was afraid he'd let it all fall out, afraid his feelings were Jedidah's and not his own. It was something the angel hadn't even considered as he stared numbly out the window.
"What?" he arched an eyebrow at her,
"What's this about?" Bernard asked, standing in front of the two beings with his hands folded neatly behind his back.
"Is...this a shrine?" He asked out loud, the water continued to slosh around his pant legs as he made his way towards the oddly placed structure.
"Why didn't we bring Butch?" Sam asked as he rubbed his hands together, Baal seemed to dislike the other hunter, sticking close to Sam despite Sam's annoyance with a few of Baal's quirks.
"We think the king of Beasts is being crowned today," Hahasiah said in a matter of fact tone.
Abel glanced around them one more time, swallowing hard. He had just beaten a man in the face with a bat till he was dead, it wasn’t a great feeling.
"We're not gonna get in trouble for going down?" One of the two men asked, eyes wide.
"Thanks…" He whispered,
"No, I'm an archangel, those shouldn't affect me,"
Abel blinked a few times, he still felt tired but his burning head seemed to have faded out. Rubbing his eyes for a few seconds he squirmed closer to the angel, he knew the man didn't have feelings for him, or maybe he did, he wasn't sure anymore.
"The King of Beasts has been crowned,"
"If I was an angel, or even just a human maybe I'd be happy," he whispered, sobs wrecking through his body, "I just want to be happy."
"So that's what we're going to do," Dutch interrupted, "Look, it's not something I do often. We gotta do this quick, if anyone finds out what we're doing it could be the end for ol' Dutch,"
The world churned under him, again. His vision blurred as he watched Arphaxat hold up his arms and fall backwards. Fear flooded his heart but it vanished when he saw the man melt into the floor.
"For what?"
"So, ten tonight. We'll drive down, steal the picture, and get back here. No cops, the paintings not….super expensive is it?" Donnie asked to Baal who shrugged,
"Guys probably nuts,"
Cham bent down beside the hunter, glancing at the words that scrolled across the screen.
“Thank you, sir, but I'm here with important news,” He said this with a smile, bouncing on his toes as if this entire conversation was a game.
"Yeah, deadass, boss is always hounding us," Donnie chuckled, patting Israfil on the shoulder who looked as if he'd fall asleep walking.
"Ya've never shot anyone before ya just gonna shoot him, are you really gonna risk it? Ain't I ya 'friend' Abel?"
After the two teenagers had calmed the night before they sat together to come up with any sort of plan, as the two teens explained what occurred to them Abel couldn't help but assume it was all imagination. He and Cham promised to act as teachers for the day to do some digging at the school and Abel was regretting it now.
"Silver bullet," the older hunter replied, "Should be some in the car. Just get it out of the tunnels, gank it, move on."
"Sorry," Dean whispered, Castiel shook his head before lacing their fingers together, giving Dean a small smile.
"No Abel,' Chamuel murmured, blue eyes locking with green, "that was me fighting it from coming out,"
"No homo," Abel whispered, scrambling onto the couch next to his friend. Having to lay on the opposite end.
“This doesn’t make sense, I was told you died Uriel,” Sam’s voice came out in an almost whisper as he looked the male up and down,
Bailey stood up straight, anger flaring in her brown gaze as she stormed up to the man. Her face inches from his, he glared down at her refusing to back down. He felt Cherm shutter against him, knowing the monster would protect him no matter what Bailey did.
“Watch it, poodle head!” Someone shouted at him but he didn’t listen, rushing past the memorial that had been set up by the opened library doors, slowing down for a heart beat as he glanced at the handfuls of flowers that cluttered around a picture of an older looking woman with a bright smile and comically large round glasses. Her pinched nose and dimples gave her an innocent look.
"Donnie, thank you," Israfil whispered, "For being my first kiss,"
"You okay, Uji?" Honey asked, putting a hand on her friend's back. He nodded to her, she smiled at him and brushed her dark hair from her face. Uji turned towards his sister, locking eyes with her, he could feel her reading his thoughts. The universe around him swirled, it felt wet under his fingertips as they communicated through the waves of it's being.
He gasped softly, Abel turned towards him "you good?"
"Me and Dean didn't just drive around and gank everything. We had days off!" Sam laughed, "and Dean was terrible at this game,"
"Amaryllis," He said, beckoning them to his side.
"So they can beat the hell out of whoever isn't on your team?" Cain asked with an arched eyebrow, sipping his coffee.
"Sam, I think somethings going on," Baal said as he pushed into the room, the hunter hunched over his laptop with a few soda cans tossed around him.
This caught Abel's full attention, looking into the others crisp blue gaze. His eyes were covered by a pair of glasses with a thick rim on the top.
"It's not like I can just call the ghost busters, are you sure, Mavie?....No I don't think you're a liar it's just............Yes I know.......I'll find someone......"
“Shit,” Abel whispered, making his way to the other people, Chamuel staggered only to grab onto a nearby table for support. Abel stopped, turning towards his friend.
"Fool!" The devil spat, "Don't give him the relief of death," he snorted towards Cherm with anger blasting into his voice.
"Answer it," She said lazily, blowing a puff of smoke out of her cigarette. Sam hesitated, glancing at Bailey who shrugged again.
"Cain right?"
"I think I figured out why he's not picking up,"
Dust kicked up under Danjal's boots, swirling in the hot, dry air of the Texas heat. A few small homes were settled around the ranch, with trees littered everywhere. A small pack of gogs charged past the pair, only to stop and run back to greet Robin who went down to them without a question. His smile bright as the sunshine above as the dogs yapped and licked at the others face, Danjal caught the others eye and glanced away quickly. Feeling heat rise into his veins that made him want to run with the energy that sparked through his being from the man's blue gaze.
"You should tell Issy,"
The sudden onset of nausea caused him to claw his way up to his feet and pelt out of his room, he practically knocked Vanilla, Max and Paul over to get to the bathroom. Clenching the toilet as he let out his sickness into the bowl below, he sobbed loudly. Going back to his knees, his head resting against the toilet seat as he screamed out from the pain in his chest. It was so cold, so empty. The only thing that could fill it was the touch of the angel.
"Sometimes...I like to remember that the world is beautiful,"
"I don't think Frodo and Samwise were lovers, mom"
"So...the theory is that a child could make the Adinkra work? And an angel has to be dead to pass on their Adinkra?" Bailey asked, she sounded confused but Abel didn't blame her. He had a hard time making heads or tails of the Adinkras and the only one who could really answer his questions was running around New York with a werewolf.
"I have a bad feeling about this," Abel confessed, watching as the time to drive flashed from twenty hours to two hours on their maps app.
Sam shuffled the phone around a bit,
"Time?"
Richie glanced back at Cain then at Mishka, she didn't say anything to this which made Cain's mind race with curiosity. As they entered the large space Cain felt shocked with how many people were there, he'd seen homeless folks around but never so many at once. The place was dirty, covered in trash, old food and rats, yet everyone seemed to be going about their business as if it were nothing.
"Wow! You cleaned, just for us?" Bailey asked Dutch, a glint of humor in her gaze. Dutch turned her head to look at Bailey, motioning to her hearing aid.
"Captain America isn't a sidekick,"
"A girl, oh Baal," He chuckled, watching the woman storm away from Baal. He turned his attention to Obizuth now, his eyes burning with a menacing joy.
The employees gasped in shock, screaming now as they scrambled to stay away from the woman. Her hips swayed as she grinned at the pair, Chamuel's hands lit up as she got closer. Abel glanced down at the desk he stood beside, he grabbed the chair and shoved it forcefully at the woman.
"Like I said, I don't know. Maybe I did it by accident, why would I want to be your primary doctor? I don't help attention seekers,"
"They're gonna notice an entire painting's gone anyways, why waste time?"
A rock maybe? Shrugging towards himself and following his friend into the poorly lit home, he could feel his grace prickling at the bottom of his palms as adrenaline kicked forward through his veins. The dusty smell of the old home reminded the angel of when he first came to Earth and was introduced to his vessel, silently wondering if Jedidah missed his skin.
He dropped it, right before jumping for his brother. Cain reached into his pocket for his own phone only to freeze.
He hesitated, maybe Uriel was right, he couldn't even follow a negative energy into a room. A negative energy that could be dangerous. Standing outside of the room for a few minutes, he could hear the soft tick of a clock somewhere in the home. The light on his palms flickered off, he couldn't do it. Letting the knob go he realized he had crushed it slightly under the strength of war. If he had let war go, what would have happened?
For just a few heartbeats, he was reminded how much the angel must have seen being hundreds of years old. For a rapid second he could see the age on Israfils face but it was gone quickly.
"Wow, you're right you are better than Tom Cruise," Booker's voice ran with sarcasm.
"What a shot," Danjal breathed as he made his way to Robin who ignored the comment and charged up to the animal. Though out of breath he continued to run, leaning down to the angry werewolf as the monster attempted to rip himself free of the thick fabric.
"Why does he get a reason for secrets but I don't," Chamuel whispered, Abel ignored this.
"What was that?" Abel murmured, Cain glanced into the darkness with a puzzled look in his face before eyeing the zippo. Pressing on the red button now the fire exploded out in a power, brilliant blaze. Abel jumped back in shock, light broke the darkness apart. Casting brilliant red and orange against the deep, wooden cave. Large, sharp looking teeth stuck out of the deep hole that stood before them that dripped with wet, thick saliva. Abel glanced down at the floor, small bumps covered the wooden area before his eyes moved up to the hanging light bulb directly between them and the teeth. It swung lazily with every movement, the bulb itself broken.
"You can hear me?" Dean asked with wide eyes, Baal snorted at this and nodded.
"I...I think so," He murmured, glancing down at his tank top and pants combo. It felt odd not to wear his usual hoodie, his arm burned from where the bow string had ripped at his skin the night before but it had been covered with gauze to keep it from being exposed to the dirty air of the farm.
"My names not Damien anymore!" She growled back at the other, "Chamuel wouldn't want anything to do with your fat butt!"
“I’ve never seen you this perplexed!” Chamuel laughed, as Abel continued on with his disbelief. “That’s my favorite movie, man! I always loved Maverick,”
"Bless my Poly heart," She breathed as Israfil floated towards the two.
It ended, "I think someone took them," Abel murmured, almost in disbelief. Chamuel glanced over his shoulder to read what had been said, "or something," Cham whispered, his cold breath sent a shiver down the hunters spine.
“Uh you guys? You know you have loads of fans, right?”
"Go back to the rodeo, win the last event. If you lose, it will be your end," He hissed at Jasira who flinched away from Cain. Her tail tucked between her legs as she nodded in response, turning towards her minions,
"That's be amazing, thank you! I'm Mishka, this is Cain,"
"Stop!" He shouted,
"Are you just saying that?"
Abel groaned inwardly, she could have changed since he was a baby. Right? He felt dread pump through his veins, why now? Cain had mentioned wanting them to meet but Abel had hoped he could stall it out.
"Answer,"
They pounded against the ground, taking him farther and farther away.
"Israfil," Donnie whispered, holding the man close and pushing his hair from his face. His mind worked hard as he attempted to find a way to stop the bleeding but the angel was so soaked in blood he couldn't figure out where it was all coming from.
"You were just upset over nothing," He said, grabbing the other roughly and kissing his lips. Abel relaxed against the other, leaning into the man and placing his hands on the other's chest.
"Wow, Badger!" He said in a cheerful, silly voice as if the crow beside him was talking, "You really are the best at this kind of stuff!"
Israfil shot from the middle of the explosion, his eyes bright against the darkness. Wings large as he flew towards them, the loud tune of the guitar could be heard for miles as he shot energy from the guitar to the police that chased the wolf.
Abel drove the large hippie van down the streets, the park was a good few hours from where they were but it wasn't anything the hunter wasn't used to. They'd get there before the sun fell, look  around for an hour or two and probably stop at a motel for the night and continue the search in the morning.
“I like it!” Donnie said finally, turning in his chair and starting to type it into Twitter.
Abel got in position, leaning down in the dirty gravel that crunched below his feet. They had covered all the devils exits with salt so it wouldn't be able to pass though any of them but the one inside. He was hoping Cham was right about the salt, they had nearly no information and if this went sideways he wasn't sure what he'd do. Though he kept his air of confidence about him around Mavis.
"Well, let me help you," Arphaxat snapped his fingers, the once old home vanished slowly around them. They now sat in a large, beautiful field, the stars dancing around them with the soft ripple of water being their music. Arphaxat settled beside Abel who now found himself overlooking a vast, beautiful mountain side. The aurora lights beating overhead, moving slowly as the snow under his feet bunched up. It didn't feel cold, in fact, he could nearly hear it falling.
"Or be in love. But you gave me both on my last days,"
Chamuel blinked at the words, saving him? For what?
"A lot, why?"
"Sam!" Norma called from the kitchen, Sam turned to look at her as she stuck her head around the corner with a smile.
"You piece of shit!" She snapped, he grabbed her without a second thought. She yelped in shock as the man ripped the picture she had of the little boy from her back pocket. Holding it up for all to see, everyone gasped.
Bailey froze, she looked at Baal who looked at her. Both of which had nothing to say to this, the woman shuffled a bit.
Donnie spoke up this time, sliding out from under the car. His shirtless frame muscular, the anti possession symbol on his chest looked a little raw as if he had been itching it.
“This is the end of the world”
"As a great man once said! "You spend so much time up this Creek, I should think by now you'd have brought a paddle""
"Ol' Penny doesn't like no one," She mused, clicking her tongue at one of the dogs that raced her way over to the girl. Robin chuckled, running his fingers through the other dog's fur before getting up, "Sorry," Robin whispered, Danjal shook his head at this.
Sam felt his face burn once again, laughing as he pushed his long hair from his face.
“A lot?” Abel arched an eyebrow at the other.
Cain blinked up at the other from his spot on the floor.
"I swear there's so much salt in this place you could single handedly wipe out the snail population," grabbing a can of beer and snapping it opened,
"I can not believe my dad did that," Mavis groaned, her face turning a shade of red in embarrassment.
The door let out a loud, low buzzing this time. Buster and Fritz exchanged a quick high five, Fritz opened the door and held an arm out.
"God works in strange ways," he huffed, "I can not speak for them, but what I can say, is to get rid of this infatuation!"
"Don't think so," she hummed, licking her lips as if she could imagine already having Abel's soul.
“That’s right Alice, get your boyfriend to save you,”
"What about the blob?" Israfil asked when they got far enough away from the two. Donnie groaned, pulling his phone out, frowning as he attempted to turn it on but the battery was completely dead at this point. Israfil did the same but his phone didn't turn on either, he shivered in the cold night.
"Get all these people out of here, unless you want to be Pishacha chow,"
"Wow, this place is gorgeous," Chamuel said, still laughing a bit between words.
"Holy shit," he heard Mavis whisper but ignored this, grabbing the red gas canister and a shovel,
'It's just something small. People do it all the time, it doesn't mean I'm indulging Jedidiahs feelings right? Or are they mine?'
The group all started to chatter together as the shock of it wore off. Buck guided Israfil from where he stood towards the kitchen, the family following close behind. The kids were chatting with one another in excitement at the whole spectacle as they sat down to eat pizza. Donnie could hardly even believe how well Israfil seemed to fit in with his family, he recalled things that his siblings enjoyed from their posts on social media, told stories of his journey, though Donnie noticed he avoided talking about Faith.
“I have so many ideas!” He started, “First off I think you need to make shirts and stickers,”
Saint Bernard walked beside him, the man's hands in his pockets, his phone out but it floated in a dark light in front of his gaze. Scrolling through it without a sound, Uriel followed close behind though he didn't fully agree with what was happening but he saw no point in arguing. Jegudiel's hair had been slicked back, wearing his usual turtle neck with a blazer over it. An usual outfit to the humans but he enjoyed the way it looked on his vessel's skin.
"I'll get the gas for the way back," Bailey said, swallowing the last of her coffee.
"Who are you?" Someone asked as he filmed them, being shoved into the back with the rest of the innocent.
"God," He murmured, glancing up at the cold, endless black abyss that was the nighttime skies. "Am I just supposed to be an endless killing machine?" He asked, rubbing his hands together in an attempt to warm them.
"This whole Jesus shit, thank fuck I'm not Jesus. Yaknow? Who's wanna be nailed to a cross?"
"Said to come see her with the painting, she gave me an address and told me to bring the violin."
"And whatever this disgusting mess is," Abel laughed as he tossed the box to Baal and Sam who both shot him a look.
Pain, that was all he could really think about. The pain that ran through his skull as he glared daggers at the men surrounding him. Sam Winchester was tied to a chair, his eyes swollen from being beaten, his body ached from the lack of sleep, his stomach knotted from hunger. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt so terrible, a sharp, thorny crown sat on his head. It dug into his skin with every movement he made causing blood to fall into his eyes. He’d been wearing it for days now, everytime he moved it would reopen his wounds.
"Pay up," Bailey said as they stepped out of the hospital, she held her hand out to Baal who dug into his jacket pocket and dropped a few hundreds in her hands. Huffing to himself,
Abel felt a lightning flash between them, Chamuel pressed his nose to the hunters causing the man to lean up towards the angel. He found himself breathing heavily now at the speed his heart rammed against his rib cage. The distance closing between them, he could nearly taste the others lips.
"Hey, isn't that…" Bailey pulled to the side of the road next to the shapes of Donnie and Israfil.
"Mhm," Baal turned towards the house, Abel shot a glare at Chamuel before following the other. Chamuel rolled his eyes, rubbing his hands together anxiously as he watched Cain take the lighter from Baal and set fire to the home. The flames started out small before slowly eating their way up the wood, a loud, haunting scream ripped from the inside of the home but the salt that surrounded the area trapped the creature inside.
“You can’t just blindly trust people, someday that’s gonna get you killed”
"Have not," The other student replied.
"Run, I run," Donnie growled to Robin,
"Yep! It was the only badass archer comic's Bailey had. Her son was deaf and loved 'em so she had a lot," Donnie mused, "Besides, it's perfect for a jumping off point! I just need the basic understanding of how his arrows work and I can take it from there,"
Sitting up from his makeshift bed on the floor. He had piled a few blankets down and a pillow, Sam snored softly from the chair. A blanket drapped over him, while Butch slept on the other couch. The house was dark, silent with sleep.
“I just...I feel like I was made some kinda guinea pig with this necklace. Like, is it a weapon? Am I the one testing it? What even is it?” Abel continued, he could tell that the hunter wasn’t mad which eased his anxiety some.
"When?"
"Can you believe this?" The smile died again as he hugged the other tight, burying his face into the man's neck.
"I'll see you around," she said quickly, ducking into the loud coffee shop.
"I already think it's Issy," Donnie mused, the brunette's face turned red. He spluttered and shoved Donnie softly,
"Please accept this token of my love,"
"I-I mean with Cham and Abel, not with...well, yaknow...hey uh, I think I smell pancakes? My favorite breakfast food. Sometimes you just have to have a little food and a hot coffee," she continued her rambling in an attempt to cover up her embarrassment.
"Oh we definitely do," Sam murmured, "I was reading a book...it said something about the magic in the world that masks the creatures of it. You know? Makes them look human? I thought it was mumbo jumbo but..."
"That was happening long before Abel," Bailey teases to the other as she sat in the passenger seat beside Baal, Sam shook his head and left for his plane ride.
"Yep! Every hunter gets one," Sam pulled down his shirt to show the old tattoo on his chest,
Cain shakily nodded, taking his backpack off and leaning the gun against a tree on a less wet part of the ground. He dug into the bag for his supplies, running through what he'd need in his head to fix the bleeding cut. He glanced at his father who eyed him with a dead gaze, a shiver passed over his body as Cherm giggled in his ear.
"Fake or fact? Jesus returns to earth?" The title read.
"The darkness within him, it was turned to grace when he tried to protect his lion heart."
"No, it was Ancitif," he whispered, "I don't know, I just-- felt like it was right,"
"...Sure," He finally whispered, pocketing the phone. Maybe it would give him a bit of time to make up an excuse for his sudden jealousy.
"That's fine, cause I'm gonna do it!" Abel said proudly, puffing out his chest dramatically. He nodded to Chamuel who grinned at the man,
"Robin's is--"
"Little every so often won't kill a guy," He replied smoothly, "Make him weaker? Maybe,"
He handed her the keys, she greedily snatched them up only for a knock on the window to startle the duo. A pair of detectives stood outside the door, the agents looked as if they had been just waiting for the two.
“Yeah…?” Chamuel asked, fearful what the other could possibly say. The entire incident was a blur in the blonde's mind as he looked over at the bruised and beaten up hunter. He had glass in his shaggy hair, cuts on his hands and face, yet a smile was settled on his lips.
Chamuel sat on the bed, Abel took a seat backwards on a small office chair. Letting his chin rest on the head of the chair watching the officers,
His mothers voice caused his heart to stop, her body shuttered and stood up from the chair she had been rotting in. It took all his power not to gag, her stiff frame walked ridged towards Cherm.
"What's a hunter doing with all of this," Abel murmured, "Sam always said they...don't exactly like to be...yaknow, fancy?"
Chamuel turned towards the voice, a woman with short strawberry blonde hair grinned at him, “Who are you?” Chamuel asked, his voice sounded echoed as he rapidly lost control over war.
"Can you find out for m-- oh," leaning back now as a woman stormed up to Baal, smacking the helmet from his hand. Lucifer watched with a devilish grin twisting his pale skin. Excitement was clean in his face,
Baal stood up suddenly, cutting him off mid sentence.
"Yep! Got hit by lightning," Donnie grinned, "That's how I found this place! We call it the ugly tree,"
"What? How?"
Sam sat down on the couch, taking Mishka's controller.
“That’s where we were heading,” Chamuel breathed, his words slightly slurred.
"Want me to come with you?" Danjal asked as Robin leapt out of bed and started to collect the clothes he wore the day before. Having washed around bedtime the previous night. He pulled the pants on and glanced towards his friend,
“Wake up, dude, it’s sunday. We gotta job to do,”
Chamuel blinked a few times, relaxing himself but he could still feel the grace roll through his veins. Pumping his body with energy,
Both Jegudiel and Lucifer turned to look at Bernard who's eyes were narrowed to slits, "because I believe I just witnessed that very thing,"
"They might be too drugged out to see it," Cain scoffed
"Gotta weird email, said their animals were actin' funny," She pulled out her phone, handing it to the other who scrolled through a collection of screenshots.
Everyone looked back down at the burns before looking at one another.
"What?"
It was broken down, the wood rotted from the outside with a caved in roof. Grass and weeds overgrown in the front of the house, the trees that surrounded the old beaten down home loomed ominously over it's red, brick roof.
"Did you see where he ran to?" Chamuel asked from the back seat, he was leaning forward so his arms wrapped around the neck of the passenger seat.
"What? You taught him and not me?"
"Abel about last night, I uh, think we need to talk about some things,"
"So he has the prophecy, and he wants to sell it?" Abel asked, Bailey nodded at this. Holding up the crumpled up paper, Abel took it from her and turned it in his hands a few times. It was covered in chicken scratch writing that took the hunter a few seconds to decipher.
“Baal?”
"No it was the new floors," Chamuel replied, beaming at his friend.
