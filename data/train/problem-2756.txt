He was deluding himself, a part of him knew it, and even Sam seemed to be aware of this, but Dean didn't want to listen, and there was nothing Sam could really do about it, but hope that it would work out. He hadn't seen his brother interested in someone for a long time, and was glad to learn that was happening, before the incident occurred. His brother deserved to be happy.
So Dean waltzed over, naked, swaying his hips seductively, and reached for the alpha who seemed glued to the spot. His hand tugged at the belt and let the bathrobe fall open, revealing a very big and red, deliciously looking and fully erect alpha cock. "Oh. Alpha..." Dean scolded just a bit. "You shouldn't hide these things from me, Alpha. Let me take care of you..." Dean said and waited for a confirmation, because he wouldn't do anything without the alpha's consent. Never again. Cas raised his shy eyes and studied Dean for a moment, before finally giving a small nod.
It was about an hour later that Dean woke Cas up with a smell of Mac&Cheese in the air around him, and Dean smiled when Cas took the printout of Dean's article, crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. They ate, talking about random things and Dean couldn't believe how lighter Cas seemed. He smiled more, talked more, even cracked a few jokes. He ate a second serving, and Dean was pleased, almost preening on the inside for being able to do this for him.
"But what if someone comes in and sees that I'm not…" The omega trailed off again, glancing at his corner. Castiel put on a reassuring smile before he replied.
He gasped slightly when he felt Dean's fingers brush against his cheekbone, his hand cupping his face, but leaned into the warm touch, the feeling so intimate and... Safe. He looked up, finally, and it was those same green eyes that watched him with that gratitude and with such affection that simply could not be faked. Those same green eyes that were filled with wonder, those green eyes that said
Deep down he knew he is safe. And would be safe in the car. And in the penthouse. At yet, his broken mind screamed at him and Dean just... Froze. He didn't remember when Benny opened the door for him and lead him into the limo, or when he drove, or even when they reached their destination.
"No, please. Don't... Don't stop." Dean spoke back and let out another beautiful sound as Castiel's hips rolled again. It felt amazing. The way Dean takes charge, but then lets Castiel back in control when they both need it. Like he knew.
It didn't make sense, none of it did. Not the way Dean acted, not the way Castiel felt about him the first moment he saw him, not even those soldier guys. They wanted to take him, but why, he had done nothing wrong? At least he didn't think he did.
"You wanted to skip out on a meal? And when there are so many starving people in the world?" Crowley said with a glare and Dean threw him a wtf look. Did he seriously just use that parental line on him?
He heard Castiel ask and he nodded without thinking, never wanting to part that soft touch. Castiel's lips spread into a wide smile, his hand slipping down Dean's neck and landing on his shoulder.
His above average omega dick slotted right next to the big alpha's and Castiel gasped, both from Dean's words and his actions. He didn't even know he was hard, his mind too lost in the sight and smell of his omeg... Dean, but when he felt that sweet friction, his eyes rolled to the back of his head as he closed them, letting out a very gluteal moan.
"Are you his guardian? Finally found an alpha to fuck you into submission?" Ketch spat out, quietly, riling Dean up without letting his team hear. He was just looking for a chance to arrest the omega, and throw him in the worst cell he could find, then misplace his paperwork for a day or two. But since he couldn't find a reason enough to do that, he would try and pick a fight, or do anything that would in any way hurt or piss off the omega.
He was scared, okay?! Could you blame him? His whole life he had his little brother to look after and suddenly he didn't need Gabriel anymore and the omega still hadn't really comprehend that, finding too much free time and uncertain what to do with it, sometimes even forgetting that Castiel wasn't there and he would start talking to him (to a wall). It was only two days ago that he realized he could go and meet new people and it was scary.
"Then perhaps I should reveal a secret of yours, Lord Samuel?" Lady Charlotte said, crossing her arms and pouting adorably, but all Castiel could think about was the so-called secret as he watched Lord Samuel turn pale for a moment, eyes going wide before he scolded his features. He was not fast enough.
He spent the next few hours receiving lords and barons and other high patriots, hearing their complaints and promising to look into them, no matter how trivial or absurd they sounded. As if he had no better things to do then settle whether calling someone a bastard was an insult if they are indeed an illegitimate child, or if they should be rewarded for exposing a thief after stealing from them.
He was just about to turn a corner when Lady Megan's voice reached him, the tone far too forward. "I don't wish to be matched with anyone, thank you very much. You are good at that, but you are no miracle worker."
"That's awesome! I'll be back by the time dinner preparations start. Thanks, Red." Dean replied as he walked into the shelter and once again caught sight of Cas helping around with a smile on his face.
They went back to work, and with only a quarter of the boxes left, they figured they would be done before the late lunch. They chatted more, about casual things like weather, books, tv shows and movies and Dean was astounded that there was a person out there that hasn't seen at least one Star Wars movie, so he joked he would have to correct that. Needless to say, Castiel blushed at the implication, but dared say nothing.
"Hey, you okay, buddy?" Dean asked turning to see why Castiel wasn't getting up. Buddy. He called him buddy. That left a poor taste in his mouth. But what was Dean supposed to say? Boyfriend? Sweetheart? Ugh! Zach used to call him that, with such condescending tone, the word forever making bile rise up his throat.
Benny was the first to excuse himself, and Dean made sure he brought food for Andrea, a little too much food if Gabriel was asked, but it wasn't as if they didn't have enough. Garth and Bess left next, after Dean spent good 5 minutes assuring her she didn't have to help with the clean up and that it wasn't a bother, but she wouldn't back away, not until Gabriel guaranteed he would help Dean, as it would be the least he could do. Charlie left right after, mentioning something about a conference call and telling Gabriel he had to come and visit, for coffee and Harry Potter talk.
Glancing over Dean's resting form, he had to smile, all those feelings from before rushing back to the surface. How easy it would be to just lean and set a small kiss on those plush lips, Castiel could only imagine. His tongue swept over his own, wetting them, wishing he could feel Dean's lips.
"You do want m… I mean, you don't see me as damaged or…" Dean's eyes were averted as he slowly started to move away from Castiel.
When Castiel came in that evening, smiling and happy to have finalized the merger and would be able to spend more time with Dean, he expected to find Dean curled up on him bed again, wearing his trenchcoat. He found it so adorable seeing him like that, and even if he didn't know what incited such behavior, he felt good about Dean taking the coat as if he needed to feel Castiel close. Or at least he hoped that was the case.
His soft, trembling hands, reaching out in a desperate need of contact, but so shy and scared to be slapped away.
represents another name for France, used in the 18th and 19th century. The title has a slightly mocking connotation.
Dean woke up and without even opening his eyes, he snuggled back into Castiel's embrace grinning. The images of their activities last night still vivid in his mind, he just let them come, relishing in them, especially the shower part where Castiel insisted he made a mess and hoped Dean would let him clean it up. Like Dean would say no to more soft touches. It was so amazing feeling those hands caress his body, gliding over his skin lubricated by the shower creme, rubbing and gently massaging his every muscle. Dean felt so loose and relaxed after that, he literally floated out of the shower. Castiel was constantly smiling at his blissful expression as he wrapped him up in a huge towel and dried him up, his hands never parting Dean's body. He caressed Dean's thighs as he knelled and helped Dean into a pair of briefs, then lead him back to the bed. He set Dean down and laid beside him, and let out a small gasp when Dean snuggled so close to him. His expression matched Dean's, feeling so elevated and so drugged on joy, he fell asleep with a wide smile on his face.
Cas stayed away during dinner and even sat on a chair while they were supposed to be relaxing and watching TV, and no matter what Dean did or said could persuade him to come closer. Dean didn’t want to push and try and pull him into his embrace when it obviously wasn’t welcomed, and he had no idea what else to do, fearing that any move he could make could backfire. So instead of letting Cas sit on an uncomfortable chair, he offered him the couch, and Dean would take a shower and retire to bed. Once he was finished with the bathroom, he told Cas it was free and went to bed. He tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep, thinking about Cas and all the bad luck that followed him around. Dean wanted to help him, to support him and be there for him, but it just seemed like one bad thing after another kept trying to bring them down. Still, Dean was nothing if not persistent. He would fight for Cas for as long as he had to.
"Shhh, it's okay. I... I understand. How... How about this... How about I tell you if something doesn't feel good. If something you do hurts? I tell you and then you try and stop."
Castiel got up and moved, settling right behind Dean. One hand lubed his aching cock while the other shot up and ran down Dean's back, a bit rough, more massaging then caressing and he leaned in, pressing a soft kiss on Dean's shoulder and whispering into his ear. "I got you."
"Our dicks are touching." Castiel said, huffing a nervous laugh, too drained to feel embarrassed about it.
"I need... I need you to fuck me... Can you please, just... Fuck me? Please?" He never liked begging, he was never that kind of an omega but damn, he desperately needed Sam to take over, he needed to tell him, to show him just how much deprived he was and how essential this was. How important it was.
"Yes." Castiel answered simply as they reached the door, then slowly entered the room so as not to startle the hurt omega.
Dean looked down on the offered piece of clothing. It really wasn't much, just another layer that didn't fit and didn't hide much, but it wasn't about that. It was more about what it represented, and right now, it meant that he could more easily hide the shame he was feeling. He reached for it, letting the blanket slip off his shoulders and quickly put it on.
"Harder, Sam, harder and faster..." He asked and he received, his head slowly falling forward as he tried to breathe the words out. It felt incredibly good, and
The way Dean's eyes sparked and the way he bit his lower lip, Castiel would say 'funny' wasn't the word he wanted to say, but he didn't think his rustled half wet hair was that attractive, so he only huffed a smile and motion for Dean to lead the way. Seconds later, Castiel was sitting in the two-seater, his hand draped over the backrest in an inviting way. Dean sat attentively next to him and gave him one shy, but questioning look and Castiel raised a brow with a smile making Dean puff the air out and thus making Castiel start to laugh.
"I am sorry, sir, but in order to get a new card with your social security number printed, you must provide some other form of identification, either an ID, a driver's license or a passport. Otherwise, I cannot issue you a new card." She said with disinterest, a perfect vision of a government employee who didn't give a shit.
"I read about this, I studied it profusely." The alpha said and yeah, brag about reading porn, why-don-cha. The bastard probably never had an omega in heat and knew one would submit to a strong alpha as it was hotwired in their brain. "And I also talked to Pamela and she confirmed it, so you have nothing to worry about." The alpha said and wait what?!
"I really am sorry for insinuating that you were following me." Cas said as the two walked back to the shelter.
"No, it does not 'suck'." Cas replied and wowey. The guy actually used air quotes? How come Dean didn't know that? "It is really good, concept-wise. But there are a few things that could use improvement. I could edit this for you, or... Maybe we could go through it and I could explain it?"
For a few moments the room was completely silent aside from Castiel's panting. Dean froze once again, torn between the lack of that inner voice that would say how wrong it was of him to act upon his own desires and that amazing and arousing feeling that he elicited all those sounds from Castiel and made him come just with his hand.
Castiel barely got any sleep that night, altering from sobbing into his pillow to dreaming of one nightmare after the other, each one almost the same. Dean, kind and gentle, turning into a beast and attacking him over and over and over again.
Considering that visitors had to be 'buzzed' in (the air quotes are Castiel's, not mine), this could only be someone from the building. Maybe it was the guy downstairs again, Nash or Dash, whatever was his name... No, Ash. Right. He would come by sometimes looking for matches or sugar. Still, wasn't it a little early to get high?
For a moment he just focused on his breathing, and trying to relax and gather his strength to get up. He rolled till he reached the end of the bed (the damn thing was huge, how did it even fit in the room?!), then took a deep breath and lifted himself to a sitting position while swaying his legs off the bed. Realizing his mistake, he grimaced at the yucky feeling of cold slick still wetting his pijama's and was just about to get up when the alpha came back.
Yeah, Dean pretty much expected that from his brother. He didn't really knew the answer, he just knew he was mesmerized by those striking blue eyes and he didn't want them to stop seeing Dean. Not like he could tell Sam that.
And yeah, Meg was so infatuated with him, but Castiel was glad she found someone, even if he still worried about his connections to the Pellegrino family. Still, the change in Meg's attitude would change, she would smile more and be a lot more polite, generally happy, and it would show.
"Oh, shut up." Cas said, and abruptly doing it for him, shutting his mouth with his and drawing him into a deep kiss, despite probably tasting himself along the way.
"Why not?" Castiel asked, and waited and waited, but when he didn't get an answer, he tried something else. "Can you... can you show me?"
Just as he was about to reach the nightstand, the blinding pain cut through him again, making him wrap his arms around himself and curl into a ball and just tried to breathe. It felt like someone was hammering nails into his spine and at the same time screwing big bolts into his stomach and it was so strong and so choking, Gabriel felt bile rising up in his throat. Because he hadn't eaten since yesterday morning, he had nothing to throw up but the water he drank, but that didn't stop his stomach from clenching and he eventually vomited something he might describe as a mix of stomach acid and water, but he didn't really care. He had to get to that phone and call for help.
treat an officer of the law." Ketch said to the guy behind him. Dean hadn't seen him around, and since Ketch called him a rookie, must mean he is new, or at least new to their squad. He had a blank expression and unmemorable features, and was just another nark in the line of many.
"Lord Samuel!" Lady Charlotte berated him, then smacked him in the shoulder with the back of her hand. She seemed a bit embarrassed, but not too much. "I thought we were becoming friends! That was supposed to be a secret!"
Cas gave him his bed to sleep on. Even after Dean said those things to him, but in Dean's defense, in all the time he had spent out in the streets, not a day passed by that someone didn't offer something sexual, whether it was a sleezebag too ugly for a hooker, or even a fellow homeless person looking to let off some steam. God, how he blushed at the mere insinuation of sex, how adorable he was when he tried to explain. Damn, Dean felt like the biggest jackass then. The feeling hadn't changed.
"Can I... Are you gonna come to the shelter tommorow too?" That wasn't what Dean was going to ask, Castiel was sure of it. Dean was going to ask if he could see him again.
Watching Castiel fall apart under his willing touch was so much different then jerking off some... No, no, he didn't want to think about others now and the things he has done, the only thing that mattered was here and now and how... liberating this whole thing felt. But... what was it?
During the day, he would sometimes excuse himself and go back to his penthouse, more often so, feeling like he is only in Dean's way. Not because all Dean talked about was his brother, no. It was because he started to shy away from his touch, his kisses were short and cut and less initiated by him. And of course, Castiel didn't want to push, wanted to give him his space.
Not for the first time today, Castiel came to mind. Memories of their 'dates' and their kisses and the warmth of his body next to Dean's attacked his mind and suddenly all he could think about was the dark haired angel. His guardian angel.
"That's alright, Cas. I mean... I kinda do that for a living, being an investigative reporter, I follow people sometimes... Not that I am following you or writing about you, I would never..." Dean trailed off. He wanted to say he would never do that without his permission, but he kind of already did. Whether it was him or his editor is nothing more then semantics, and therefore not relevant, so he didn't really have a good argument beside adding "... Not again..."
Castiel took a deep breath, and tried to calm his racing heart and his overstimulated mind. He was in love with Dean. That could potentially lead to a number of disastrous things, to heart break, to being physically hurt, to becoming even more emotionally unstable...
"And... Yours?" Castiel asked lifting his shy gaze up on the omega. Dean's smile grew wide, eyes sparking up.
Turned out, Dean was his a few more times after that. Each time one of them climaxed, the effects of the vine plants lessened, but came back full force when they caught their breath. It didn't let go until Castiel, in one of his moments of delirium, proclaimed that he belonged to Dean, that he would always be his, no matter what and Dean… Dean told him he loved him. That orgasm was mind blowing, literally and Castiel had no recollection of any thoughts or actions after that, until he woke up the next morning, body tangled with Dean's.
"Alright, um... You... You need more energy, that's... That's understandable." Sam said and Gabriel nodded leaving the bathroom and heading towards the kitchen. "What... What would you like?"
"I fear I could hurt you. I can't... I can't just let it go, I can't... I don't know how to... To let... To let it consume me, there is always that voice that says that it isn't right, that..."
"I didn't... I didn't assume you'd care." Castiel blurted out. It wasn't what he really meant, he was just surprised to see Dean having such a strong reaction to all of this. People lose their homes everyday, he saw and heard enough stories to know that well, so why get this emotional over Cas' building burning down?
"Can... Can I... - he shook his head - May. May I..." he kept trying, stumbling over his words and looking everywhere around but not at Castiel. It would have been so endearing and adorable and Castiel would in any other circumstances tease him for it, but considering all that has happened to him, he knew he couldn't. And not just that, he knew he had to help Dean ask for what he wanted, to help him find his voice and to make sure he knew he could say no, but also that if he wanted something, he had to ask, he had to show. He really needed to get Dean out of this shell. So he gripped his chin and forced an eye contact, but with a smile, Castiel nodded at him, encouraging him to speak up or act up.
"No, Cas, wait…" Dean said with a laugh, but apparently it was the wrong thing to do. Cas' brows furrowed as he stared at Dean for a moment, then suddenly snapped out of his daze, turned and bolted out the door, leaving Dean with absolutely no idea what just happened.
Castiel startled awake, groaning as he lifted his head off the couch's armrest where he must have fallen asleep. He had spent the whole day yesterday looking through job offers and reconsidering going back to Crowley. The man was a slimebag, but a paycheck was a paycheck.
"Not yet. I want to make sure you're okey, cher. Then... When he comes... You'll tell him. And don't argue with me on that. You will tell him, gottit? Now. Are you hurt?" Benny spoke, his strict and serious face bearing no bullshit.
That was until a soft knock came. Mechanically, Castiel stood up and walked to the door, opening it to find a very strange looking alpha on the other side with a wide smile on his face.
With his head still thrown back, his eyes closed and his back arched, he slowly started to rise, able to reach just half way before he felt the need to slam back down again, hearing the alpha try and breath his sounds out instead of releasing them loud and clear. Sam's hands were locked by his side and when Gabriel reached for them, he felt the alpha clenching the sheets, the muscles in his arms hard and tense.
"Yes, I do, I do, Cas. You are the best thing that ever happened to me, and I pushed you away, and hurt you. And you... You shouldn't forgive me that easily, even if I know you will, because you're you, but, you shouldn't. I have finally found someone that cared about me and I fucked it up. I don't deserve you, I really don't..."
"You smell so good..." The alpha murmured against his shoulder, sounding shy like before and so adorable, plus he was trying to nuzzle under his shoulder and it made Dean's heart fill with giddiness.
"I could handle wrist scenting. I meant, it is much less then when we first met." Castiel said completely serious, and Dean turned red as a tomato, but then Castiel looked up at him and they both started laughing.
"You really okay with me working at Balth's shelter?" Dean asked, his voice careful and quiet. "Just that... You seemed wary of me."
Dean bent over, wiggling his ass in the air before turning around and in one swift motion removed the yellow trousers. This was his favorite costume. Not just because it was a good material that didn't rip easily, but also because he always wanted to be a fireman.
"And I suppose you have the key? And in exchange you would want me to... " The image of Adam's mouth on the man's hole filled his mind and made him want to gag, but he disregarded it for now, opting to remember what else Adam said about him. "...Fill your ass with random objects and fuck you with them? Or use a big ass dildo, if you got one lying around?"
It was on the fourth... Or was it fifth day? It was then that Sammy called and Dean waged if he should answer, since he hadn't replied to any of his texts. But he knew if he didn't pick up the phone, Sam would think something was wrong and he would drop everything and come running and Dean couldn't let that happen. Sam just made Junior partner in Cage & Fish law firm and he couldn't afford to miss one day of work.
Dean figured he should try and apologize face to face, but soon realized Cas didn't want to be reminded of that night, so instead, he made sure Cas didn't mind him helping out at the shelter. It was a rather nice save of the situation.
"Cas? You okay?" Dean asked, his face morphing with concern. "Did we fall asleep? Did you... Did you have another nightmare?"
"No much, boss. The club's papers are clean, everything's legit. There is a large sum of cash being drawn from the profits, but that's legal, if the owner wants to keep his money in his safe and not the bank. I tried to trace the money, but you know cash doesn't leave a paper trail to follow. You sure you don't want me to look closely at the owner or the employees?"
"Your name? That guy, your, hm... brother? He called you Cassie, but somehow I doubt that is really your name... Unless you don't want to tell me which is totally okay, I get it... You don't have to, it not... I'll stop talking now." A little lost kitty indeed. Castiel surprised even himself when he laughed, but it was worth to see that spark in those green eyes.
Finally he pulled it out and let himself take a few minutes to try and relax. Next stop was the second finger and as much as he hated it, he knew it had to be done. His eyes teared up and something caught in his throat when he pushed two fingers in, but he blinked the tears away and focused on his breathing. Humming 'Nothing else matters' by Metallica seemed to help relax if he focused on the tune and on the lyrics and soon enough he was ready for the third finger. Too bad he was out of luck and out of time.
"Pick the lock? You mean you don't know where the key is?" He asked, his words giving Castiel pause.
“You know, they aren’t going to care. Charlie’s opinion is the only one that matters and she loved you, man. Besides, have you seen her Hermione - unicorn pink shirt with golden flecks? You think that is work-appropriate? Pff… I would… I would buy you all that stuff if I knew you would accept them, but they aren’t going to make you feel better. That’s just stuff. What you have here… (Dean pointed to his head) And here… (then to his heart) is all that counts.”
Shaking the negative thoughts, Castiel thanked the good doctor and watched as Dean walked him out the door. He felt rooted to the spot, some anxiety creeping inside, but not as bad as it should be. It was almost as if he knew he would be okay if Dean told him he had to leave. Emotionally okay, at least.
So naturally, when Mr. Novak pulled back to break the kiss, Dean's still hands finally moved, shooting up to cup the man's face and hold him locked in that kiss for only a moment longer before he realized he wasn't the one running this show. He was the bottom, the puppet for Mr. Novak to direct, the one that was supposed to lay down and take it, not ask for anything. Not what he was paid to do.
“Sorry,” he says, and even Jack is up now. God is staring at him in dinosaur pajamas with a stuffed animal tucked under his arm. “Bad dream.”
“Uh, but time works differently there, apparently,” Dean continues. “He was there for a while. Years. And he didn’t want to leave. But I made him,” and Dean is biting down on his lip, ears echoing with Cas’s pleas to let him stay.
Dean’s shaking, breathing faster than he should be. He remembers the nightmare now, of Cas fading away into the Empty without Dean being able to catch up to him. Dean had probably been yelling for Cas in his sleep, and that’s what woke everybody up.
Cas sits down at the table with his head in his hands, looking down. Dean thinks back to the confession. He said that telling Dean would make him happy, happy enough to trigger his deal. It was supposed to be the best moment of Cas’s life. And it was the worst moment of Dean’s. Dean should have kissed him, then. He should comfort Cas now, say he’s sorry for everything. All the times he hadn’t asked Cas to stay, or blamed him for something, or not kissed him. He should apologize for not kissing him now.
“I bet he is. Talk to you soon, okay?” Sam tells him, sounding like he’s about to snort, and hangs up the phone.
“Someone should worship you.” Dean would get on his knees, that isn’t the issue. It’s the other shit. The cookie-cutter picket fence, the art on the walls. He’d tried that before, with Lisa. It hadn’t worked out. Dean isn’t built for long-term relationships. He can do one-night stands, but he doesn’t want that with Cas, and Cas doesn’t want that with him, and neither can pretend to be content with that.
Dean tries not to think too much about Cas leaving. His son is here, if nothing else. Even if he wouldn’t stay for Dean, he’d stay for Jack.
He lifts the tablecloth off and looks at the face of the table. The last time he’d seen it, it had been his initials, Sam’s, and Mary’s. Their little family. Now he looks. A clear CW is carved, right next to DW. Cas’s initials, as a Winchester.
Dean is all the way lost in Cas’s touch when he gets his breathing back to a regular pace. They’re both lying on their backs, and Cas reaches out to run a hand over Dean’s bare chest. Dean almost trembles.
“You too,” Dean tells him. He feels Cas smile. He just wants to stay like this, wrapped up in contact and affection. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get enough of Cas spoiling him.
Dean is probably on the verge of losing consciousness, but he still protests when Sam tries to get Dean to go to his own bed. Sam ends up inflating an air mattress at two in the morning and letting Dean put it outside Cas’s room. Dean kicks the blankets off the mattress a few minutes before he even goes to sleep, and he passes out in his flannel and jeans.
Dean’s eyes roll back, even though Cas isn’t moving his hand. Dean’s finger is still wrapped around Cas’s in his mouth. It’s perfect. This was – good. It’d keep Dean from saying anything dumb and emotional, and he tells himself that that’s the only reason he likes it. Nothing to do with how he just desperately wants anything he can get, any touch that’ll remind him that Cas is here and alive.
He uses his hand on Cas’s wrist to guide his index and middle fingers all the way in. They’re curled gently, relaxed enough to bend with Dean’s tongue. He pushes between Cas’s fingers, spreading them apart with his tongue, and licks at the webbing between them. Dean is pretty sure he’s drooling, eyes rolled up in his head. He keeps expecting Cas to pull his hair with his free hand, but Cas never does. He just leaves his hand where it’s playing with Dean’s hair, twisting the short strands in his fingers. He gets tingles when Cas touches the hair by the back of his neck.
The lights are bright and dizzying. The adrenaline is going down already, no longer overriding Dean’s hangover. He walks past Cas into the bathroom and pats his bare shoulder.
Dean digs back into the fridge. The limiting factor for pancakes had been flour. He can make sausage. Nobody is going hungry.
Cas doesn’t stir. Dean tries to shake him, too, and his hand touches Cas, at least. He doesn’t react.
“We were both supposed to live!” Dean shouts, and yep, looks like they’re having it out in front of an interdimensional void while their son psychically yells for them to come back.
Cas unmuffles himself, and his breathing is fast. He leans down and kisses Dean, messy, mouths open, hands on both sides of Dean’s face, legs on both sides of Dean’s hips.
The trench coat has to dry for a while now, so Dean can’t distract himself with that. And he shouldn’t distract himself by hanging out with Cas, either. That’ll be some awkward eye contact. He’ll just have to waste time for the rest of the day.
“Okay. I can do that. I’ll bring some more blankets in here tonight too,” Dean promises. The request is almost meaningless, because it’s so far from what Cas truly wants. But if that’s all he can give Cas, he’ll do it. He’ll get him whatever damn slippers he wants. Gloves and a hat, too. Other Dean wouldn’t need to wrap Cas in blankets, because he’d keep Cas warm himself. He’d tangle their legs together and let Cas use him as a blanket or a heater. Both. Wrap himself around Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean can’t get anything else out before she hangs up. He does hear her start to curse out another driver. He sets Cas’s phone on the nightstand.
Dean is still holding Cas’s wrist, right by his lips. He shoves Cas’s fingers into his mouth with his hand, then moves so they almost come out. Cas gets it after a few more movements, fucking in and out with his fingers like it’s intercourse. These are the hands that wielded weapons Dean couldn’t understand, the hands that marked him when he was raised from hell. They had healed him and tossed him around, and Dean bobs his head on them now. He’s aware of a sucking noise. Cas moves his other hand from petting Dean’s hair to just resting on Dean’s chest, over his tattoo. The placement lets Cas put a little weight on it and shift his hips better. He’s leaning a little closer to Dean’s face, too. He keeps his thumb moving, though, tracing gentle circles.
Dean doesn’t let Cas out of his sight for the rest of the evening. Cas lies down on the guest bed, still wrapped in the damn trench coat, and Dean pauses in the doorway.
“I’ve been God. It was the loneliest time of my life. I don’t want you to worship me. And I don’t want you to be the illusion the Empty created,” Cas tells him.
Cas pushes him away. His eyebrows are set in something between anger and despair. “You should have left me there.”
“We should put the kid on here too,” Dean tells him, and Sam forks over his knife. Dean carves in a JK.
“What?” Cas asks him, teeth finding a good spot by Dean’s jaw. He’s looking at Dean, and – he’s a caretaker. He’ll go along with whatever Dean wants. “Anything you want,” Cas says.
“Okay,” Jack says. It doesn’t matter to God if two of his dads shack up. Jack already thinks they’re married. He’d brought it up once, during a sitcom rerun. Dean hadn’t corrected him.
Because Dean knows now that Cas does want this. He hadn’t had time to process Cas’s words, but Cas had said he loved Dean. Dean still doesn’t get it. Cas has made some questionable decisions in the past, but this one is something else. The confession had left very little room for Dean to wonder how exactly Cas loved him. This is even clearer. Cas’s declaration of love had been so abstract. Dean is looking now at tangible things Cas wants, things Dean could have done.
“No,” Dean yells back. Whatever it is, it’s not worth waking Cas up for, and it’s certainly not worth his brother walking in on his morning-after.
“You don’t want me here?” Cas is biting down on the words. And that’s the problem, isn’t it? Dean does want him. More than anything. Dean wants him there enough to keep him there when Cas would be better off elsewhere, with somebody who can be what he deserves.
Dean can’t do anything except watch as Cas walks past Sam and Jack, out the door. His knees are shaking.
Maybe that was how he’d talked to Jack in the dreams. And it’s not Jack’s fault that Cas is back without his powers, it’s Dean’s, and for once in his life he has to admit it.
Dean could be asking about any number of things that Cas certainly should regret. Leaving the Empty, or making his confession, even falling in love with Dean.
“Of course I do,” Dean admits, because he can’t let Cas believe that Dean doesn’t care any longer. Cas should know that he matters to Dean, at least, if that’s the best he can have. Dean is rapidly losing control of the pitch of his voice, crashing to the ground. “But it doesn’t matter, does it? I’m your – I’m your consolation prize for him. You’d rather be there. I can’t – I can’t be him.”
He just stands there. He hadn’t even got his reunion kiss with Cas. He hadn’t even gotten a real reunion hug, like previous times.
The Empty absorbs both of them and Billie in one second. Dean holds onto Cas and feels everything fade.
Cas sits up from his lap suddenly, and Dean wishes the contact wouldn’t have been ripped away so abruptly. He feels cold without it, stranded. Dean thinks again of Cas’s Empty hallucination of Dean. Cas would have stayed if the other Dean was the one whose lap he’d fallen asleep on.
Dean tries to make words come out. They don’t. Besides, the fake Dean had told Cas he loved him. And Dean’s scared of what’ll happen if he says it back now. Maybe Cas will lose track of reality, think he’s back in the Empty. Or the Empty could come for him again.
Jack talks through breakfast about his new ideas for heaven. Dean wonders what Eileen would like her bumper sticker stick figure to look like. He’d seen one with a fencing sword. She might like that. Another was labeled as a paintball player, but the paint splatters looked more like blood. He’d kind of pegged that one for Claire.
Cas smiles, but Dean can’t meet his eyes. When Cas speaks, it’s soft. “Why do you think you can’t have me? Do you think you don’t deserve it?”
Dean doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t know what to say. He’s been out of his depth since long before Cas confessed. But it’s good to see Cas, at least. Have him be in front of Dean, where Dean can make sure he’s not going to try to send himself back to the Empty.
“At our wedding,” Cas tells him, head tilting. Usually, Dean loves the head tilt. It’s cute and endearing, except when he’s trying to arrange a jailbreak. Cas is still just staring. He doesn’t remember.
Cas is scared of bugs now, and that would be funny. He’d gone from smiting armies to making Dean smush pests for him. Dean can’t decide how he feels about it. Part of him feels guilt that Cas can’t wield his powers any longer. Most of him feels fondness. It’s endearing, and he wants Cas to call him in every time he sees an ant. Dean couldn’t protect him from Lucifer, and he couldn’t protect him from the Empty. He wants to be able to protect Cas now. He wants – so much that he doesn’t know how he can even stand.
“What time is it?” Dean asks. Cas’s fingers are gentle on his cheek like he’s healing him, and Dean could lean into it. Tilt his head so Cas’s fingers were in his hair. But that much tenderness from Cas – Dean would overdose on it. It’d ruin him for anyone else. He shuts his eyes, just for a second, pretending he’s the fake, the one who was good enough to get Cas to stay.
“The Empty made one up for him. A human family. Gave him a neat little utopia.” It’s not the whole truth, but Dean is choking on his words.
Dean can hardly move. He’s drunk on the kiss just like he knew he would be. He doesn’t think he’s making it as good for Cas as he should, but Cas is touching the side of his face, and it’s gentle enough that Dean could just melt into it. He lets Cas’s hand trace his jaw like he’s not a loaded gun.
“Listen, it’s not your problem,” Dean tells him. He can’t even be pissed at Sam for knowing, now. “I don’t – I didn’t mean it like that.” His head is pounding.
As soon as Cas agrees to it, Dean is going to kiss him. Nothing matters except for that. He doesn’t care how he’s awake, just that he has another chance with Cas.
He braces himself to do whatever Cas will ask him for. He owes him that much, after Cas lost his family.
Dean chokes before Sam can even say anything. He can remember – snippets, of talking to Sam. He’s pretty sure he told Sam much more than he meant to, combining a self-loathing rant with a recap of how shitty his week has been and probably a coming out, plus a tangent about the trench coat. Or maybe he’s remembering the whole thing wrong and he hadn’t said anything at all. His head hurts too much to try to sort out what was actually real.
Sam hands him a thick book. Dean stands under the spray, getting his clothes soaked. The damn thing is right next to the shower handle, so he can’t turn the shower off. He takes a blind swing and crushes it. He wipes the wall clean with a page torn out of the book. He hopes it didn’t have any important spells.
“You hate yourself, think you’re not good enough for him, whatever. Who do you think is good enough for him? Give me a name.”
“I was upset and confused. I’m sorry I lashed out,” Cas says, and that sure is a 180 from yesterday. “I mean it, Dean. I’m happy with this life. I have Jack, and I have you and Sam with me.”
Dean sees a light in front of him, and he knows enough to walk towards it. Maybe this had been how Cas found him in hell. The light has to be Cas, waiting for him.
“You want that?” Cas asks, and it’s so soft. Dean presses with the hand that’s in Cas’s so their fingers are wrapped together.
“Right. Because knocking out on the floor is the best way to cope with grief,” and Sam is getting into argument mode now. Dean stands up. He and Sam can take it to the kitchen so they don’t wake Cas. Dean is the one who wants to leave, but Sam has to sort of pull him. Dean slumps down in a kitchen chair.
Dean doesn’t take in anything else. He doesn’t notice the second nightstand or the sheets rumpled beside Cas. He doesn’t care what might be between them.
The lights in the hallway are off, at least, and Dean somehow still has a blanket over him. He can still see that Cas’s door is open.
Cas stops moving his fingers, just leaving them in to the second knuckle. He presses the tips down on the center of Dean’s tongue. Dean feels a nail scrape. He hasn’t gagged yet. He sucks harder, bites a little, flicks his tongue at where he can feel the fingers bending. His top teeth are resting just below Cas’s second knuckle. Cas is whining a little, shoving his hips against Dean, too.
“Alright. I’ll do pest control, and then you can, uh, go back to what you were doing. Sammy, get me a gun. Or a shoe. Doesn’t matter.”
Dean’s not sure what he’ll even do when he finds Cas. He doubts that the Empty has much for entertainment, and it won’t let them leave. Maybe – maybe Dean and Cas could just stay with each other. They could be quiet, let the Empty rest. Maybe they could have a life together here like they never could on earth. Just the two of them, telling each other quiet stories forever. Tragic, but still better than Dean thought he’d get. Dean remembers the layout of heaven, how soulmates can share a heaven. This wouldn’t be so different.
Dean imagines Cas trying to fill out a dating app profile. Dean would – have to help him. And that’d be a slap in the face. Maybe Claire would help him instead. Teaching her long-dead father’s reanimated corpse how to work Grindr. Every young lesbian’s dream.
He’s expecting to just be able to leave the box on Cas’s bed, not to have to look him in the eyes while he hands it over, but the door is closed, so Dean knocks.
Cas puts them on, and Dean resists the urge to check the fit like Cas is Cinderella. He’d be too tempted to kiss Cas’s hand.
Sam seems to hesitate, and yeah, it makes sense that he might not know all of her food preferences yet. They hadn’t had that much time together, and certainly not much time where they have the luxury of selecting the food they want. Dean doesn’t know which one Cas likes more, either, just due to Cas not eating much as an angel.
Dean hadn’t even seen them last night, but Cas’s slippers are on the floor next to the couch. Cas slides them on.
He doesn’t move for a while. He remembers Cas coming back from the Empty the first time. As soon as they were alone, Cas had put a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean had felt the tingle of Cas’s grace running through him, but he hadn’t known to where. Dean had asked him what he had fixed. Cas had hummed and told him he’d healed the damage to Dean’s liver and pancreas. He’d started getting into the anatomical details, which Dean didn’t much want to hear. Cas had fixed up plenty of hangovers over the years, too, always looking at Dean like he was a little disappointed.
It probably will, at some point. Dean is pretty sure he’s going to have a crash one of these days, some kind of crisis about Sam knowing and what John would have thought and any emotional vulnerability. He’ll deal with it when it comes up. He’s still floating, now.
“You’re aiming for the most awkward breakfast in the history of food?” Sam says, turned to face Eileen.
Dean hands him the slipper box without a word. Cas opens it, runs his fingers down the wings of the bees. Dean is overthinking it already. He should have gotten nicer shoes, not ones he could DIY, and they look like kid slippers.
Cas is the first to break the kiss. Both of his hands are still on Dean, and Dean’s entire front is pressed into Cas’s, so that’s enough to slow down the withdrawal crash from the loss of Cas’s mouth.
Dean is sure he won’t ever admit to this, but he cuddles into Cas. Cas pulls him close, and Dean ends up on his side. Cas reaches out, and he rubs circles into Dean’s back.
He doesn’t see any evidence of more bugs when he gets to the bathroom. He stands in the same place Cas had stood, and he only has so much willpower to not think about what Cas might have been doing in the shower, might have been thinking about doing to Dean.
And he treats Cas better than Dean could. Cas flops back onto the bed once the coffee is gone, and the mirage of Dean lies down and curls around him without a second thought. Like it’s natural to him to comfort Cas, to be a good husband. Dean wants to drag him away, tell him to stay the hell back.
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry,” Sam says, and he doesn’t even know the half of it. He doesn’t know the knots that dig into Dean’s stomach when he thinks of Cas with the mirage of him. Dean hasn’t even touched on the issue of him absolutely not deserving Cas. Sam just sets the water glass in front of Dean.
“I told you I’d do what you wanted. If you got out of the Empty,” Dean says, and then he looks away. “What do you want?”
“No, I didn’t,” Sam points out. “You’d make me leave the room in case they were venomous because you didn’t want me to get bit.”
Dean could have more, maybe, if he had the guts to ask for it. Dean could kiss Cas, and Cas would let him. Cas would let him get away with anything, probably. He’d let Dean put his hands all over him, until Cas’s voice broke and legs shook. Dean could give requests too, and maybe Cas would indulge him, with fingers in Dean’s mouth and whispers of praise in Dean’s ear.
Dean had brought Sam to the lobby of a museum once, while John had gone off on a one-day hunt. The museum had a coin funnel for donations, complete with ramps to direct the trajectory of the quarters. Sam spent most of the day watching visitors pass by and drop coins in, where the money would go in circles until falling into the vortex. Dean had spent the time watching for threats. A stressed nanny had abandoned a stack of quarters to chase after a runaway toddler. Dean picked up the coins, and Sam looked at him. Dean handed Sam just one. Sam put it in the coin slot. They had watched it circle, getting closer to the bottom of the plastic vortex, as the orbits got more and more erratic. As it reached the opening, it went faster and faster, and it stayed there for what felt like an eternity before it fell through. Dean is in the same place now, orbiting Cas like he’s not eventually going to fall.
Dean walks up the sidewalk, past the perfectly manicured flowers lined up in straight rows. He knocks, and his hand goes straight through the door.
He knows there’s an obvious solution that neither is mentioning. Dean’s bed should be able to accommodate two adult men. But it’d be more difficult under any covers to pretend that what he really wanted was to sleep a foot away from Cas without touching him.
Dean wakes up to Cas saying his name. He opens his eyes, and Cas is crouching next to him, with a hand on the side of Dean’s face like he’s healing him. His fingers are wet.
Cas takes his finger out of Dean’s mouth, bringing Dean’s finger with it. Dean opens his eyes, and Cas is staring down at him. Their fingers are both shining a little with his spit.
The fake Dean walks right over to Cas and hands him one of two cups of coffee he’s holding. Dean wonders where the other bedroom in the house is. He’d only seen this one and Jack’s. This thing must have been living here for a while, in Dean’s place, where Dean is supposed to be.
It’s awkward, the fact that two of them died and came back. The other two mourned them. And none of them are talking about it.
He brings his laptop to the library and thinks about Baby again, the closest equivalent to Cas’s trench coat he has. Cas had changed his trench coat, done something to it that represented Dean, in a way. Dean owes him something like that on Baby. He starts opening tabs.
Cas’s ring finger is clear of jewelry now, and Dean feels sick. He still has hands on Cas’s shoulders. The sigils are still there, painted in Cas’s blood.
Dean moans around the fingers at Cas’s reassurance, and his eyes shut again when Cas moves his finger in a little deeper. It’s an awkward angle, and Cas has to move and sit up on Dean’s hips. Dean resents their torsos not being pressed together any longer, but Cas’s finger is still flooding his senses enough to quell the withdrawal from contact. It’s enough to keep Dean steady.
Cas breathes out some kind of yes noise, and Dean looks. Cas is flushed red, biting down on his lip, watching Dean like it’s a show. Dean resolves to get popsicles next time they’re grocery shopping. Dean reaches for Cas’s waistband with the hand that had been gripping Cas’s ass. He doesn’t have the coordination to try to get Cas’s pants off, but Cas releases his hair and helps guide Dean’s hand where he can grind on it. Cas gasps out a breath, hard.
Cas doesn’t respond. He can’t hear him, either, or see him. Dean’s punch passes right through the mirage of himself. It’s going to kill Cas, maybe. Shifters shouldn’t be here, they should be in Purgatory. But whatever is pretending to be Dean can’t have good intentions. Cas is just sitting up in bed, waiting for him. Cas has no idea. He looks happy, even, to see the impostor.
Dean doesn’t want to leave. He wants to sit in the corner of the room and make sure that Cas doesn’t go anywhere. But he can’t, because the fake Dean had shared a room with Cas, and Dean didn’t want to taunt him with things Dean couldn’t give.
He doesn’t let Cas or Sam help him with the bags, although they’re both sitting in the kitchen. The slippers aren’t exactly a surprise, considering that Cas had directly requested them and had to give Dean his shoe size. He still wants to keep them hidden until he figures out what to do with them. He sends Sam to get Jack to eat and runs to put the slippers in his own bedroom.
“But as I became more human and started to understand the concept, I realized I was getting preferences,” Cas continues.
“It’s not real,” Dean says, and that hurts him more than he can even process right now. He’s in escape mode. Breakdowns can wait.
“Hope you washed those,” Dean says, because Cas looks a little too floored to speak, but he must want something else if he’d stopped. His hips have stopped, too, holding still, precarious.
“Are you sure you want to go back in there?” Cas says, except it’s not him. The voice is pitched up and cruel. This is the Empty talking.
“Okay, cool,” Dean says. Sam is acting like it’s not complicated, and all Dean has to do is go talk to Cas and everything will be fine. Sam is looking at him like he can’t fathom why Dean is hungover on the floor instead of hugging Cas. Maybe it was deniable. Maybe Sam thought Dean meant that he didn’t deserve Cas as a best friend. He doubts it. Sam isn’t that dumb.
Cas looks at Dean, still searching him, and Dean wants to hide. Cas reaches out one of his hands to set over Dean’s open palm. Dean traces the palm line with one shaky finger, because that’s all the touch he can handle without exploding.
“Really? Do you think you can do more to hurt me than I can to hurt you? Don’t you want to hear about what your beloved angel was doing while you slept? I can tell you all of it, show you their first kiss, their wedding. Their wedding night, too, if you want the tape. And you should go back to sleep before I start, unless you want to hear all about how well the Dean in his mind treats him. But that’s not who you are, is it? You followed him here because you panicked, and because you didn’t want to be alone. He wanted this. He didn’t want you. He doesn’t know who you are.”
It turns out not to matter. Cas is exhausted, and he falls asleep on the couch just a few minutes later. His head tilts onto Dean’s shoulder. Dean isn’t about to wake him up. He just puts on a Dr. Sexy marathon on mute and listens to Cas breathe instead. He could brush the hair back from Cas’s forehead, plant a kiss on it. But this isn’t real, not the way he wants it to be. Dean had turned off the lights before Cas had sat down, so he can’t see Cas’s face. Maybe Sam will wake them up when Eileen gets there.
Maybe it’s too cutesy for Cas. Maybe he likes realistic bees and not little cartoonish ones. Or he might be upset at the eyes not all matching. Dean puts the slippers back in the box anyway. He takes it and the extra blankets he’d grabbed and walks over to the guest room Cas has been staying in. Dean thinks of it as Cas’s room by now. He has for a while.
“Castiel is awake in his little domestic fantasy because that’s the only way he’d shut up. You, I don’t know. Why are you awake, Dean? You want to watch?”
“Yes. She filled up a warehouse with copies of you and had me kill them. And I believe she had put me through lobotomies before. The memories inserted then felt the same as the ones in the Empty. Something was just off, like I wasn’t actually there for those memories.” Cas is looking away. He speaks like he’s telling Dean a bee fact.
“Yes,” Cas says, and Dean gives him a goodnight kiss that probably doesn’t taste great, but Dean still drags it out.
He keeps walking. He looks into what must be Jack’s bedroom. But it’s wrong. It’s empty. The bed is made perfectly, and he doesn’t see any toys scattered on the floor. Jack is just sitting in the middle of the room, completely still.
“He deserves someone else,” Dean tells him, and he’s basically circling the same point, but that’s how discussions between the brothers generally go, especially while inebriated. Repetition of the same opinions until one of them gets bored. He does take a sip of water, just to appease Sam. Then he can’t remember what he said. He’d meant to say ‘somewhere else’ again. He’s not sure he said it right.
“Alright. So. Did you want your stick figure to be a ninja after all?” Dean says. He grins, deflecting hard.
“Jack?” Dean asks quietly. The kid couldn’t be here. It’d just ruin Cas if Jack was stuck in the Empty too. And Sam would be the only one left to stand against Chuck. Jack doesn’t reply, and Dean can’t put a hand on his shoulder either. It passes through. This Jack isn’t real, any more real than the rest of the house. He’d gone with Sammy to a museum once, looking at replicas of historical bedrooms with wax figures. Dean thinks of it now. Maybe that’s all this place is.
Dean wakes up feeling pretty damn sorry for himself. Headache, nausea, the works. He can’t exactly be surprised.
Dean supposes the only thing he has that’s like Cas’s trench coat is Baby. If Cas told him he hated Baby and would feel better if she was bright yellow, well. Dean would take her in for a repaint the next day. Slap some groovy flower decals on the sides, if it’d make Cas happy.
“It’d make me. Very happy,” Cas says, and he does sound like he’s about to cry. He yanks on Dean’s hair again. Dean’s eyes roll upwards.
“Sam said I’ll have to tell you sometime. That’s how I got you out,” and Jack smiles, like God is a fun little costume Dean bought him and not the responsibility of the universe.
“You’re not the consolation prize, Dean,” Cas says, and his words are soft, soothing, like a touch. Dean wants to lean into it. “He was. The Empty gave me that life to stop me from returning to you. And I’d take an hour with you before a lifetime with him. What do you think he could give me that you can’t?”
“So you don’t think you deserve him and you don’t think anyone else deserves him. The way I see it, if he’s going to end up with someone you think isn’t good enough for him, that someone might as well be you.”
Cas takes the coffee Dean made for him with a kiss. Dean makes the kiss longer and grosser than he has to, just because he can. Cas lets him. He even puts a hand in Dean’s back pocket for just a second.
“I’m sorry. Do you want your own fake reality?” it says, and Dean looks away from where it’s using Cas’s body to speak.
“You’re making a stick figure family?” Sam says, and then. “Why is my sticker self just holding a computer?”
Sam is waiting for him at the kitchen table, and he only glances at Dean for a second before looking away.
He ends up standing next to Cas, mixing bleach and water in a giant bucket. He isn’t sure why they even have a container that size, but it’s useful enough now.
“No,” Cas says. “When I was a full angel, gender wasn’t relevant to me. When I kissed Meg. With Daphne, I was just confused.”
“Dean, you. I want. Forever,” Cas is saying. It’s nonsense, but Dean is getting off on it anyway, on the idea that he can have Cas. He can keep Cas. He’s drowning in touches and words, like he’d spent his whole life with occasional sips of hard cider and just started chugging vodka. He’d spent so long subsisting on whatever Cas would give him. He’d thought he was lucky when Cas would smile at him or watch a movie with him.
“What do you think I could make your reality into to get you to be quiet?” It’s still going. Unbidden, Dean feels images rising to the surface of his mind. Flashes of the bunker, of Sam, Cas, Jack, Eileen, Claire. Everyone. All okay. And that’s it. No details beyond that.
“She’s coping pretty well.” Dean remembers how Cas had called after his first escape from the Empty. That was the best phone call of his life, even when he didn’t know if Cas was the real deal.
“I want you to be the man I fell in love with,” Cas says, and Dean’s choking on nothing like he’d choked on dirt all those years ago. He gets an irrational rush of fear, the same one he has every time Cas mentions his feelings, that the Empty is going to come back for him. But it doesn’t. Cas pauses and breathes. “You already are.”
Dean isn’t quite selfish enough to let himself have this. Cas is going to realize it’s real, that he’s waking up with the real Dean, and not the mirage from the Empty. The sooner Dean tells him, the less it’ll hurt for both of them. He permits just a moment more before clearing his throat.
“You can eat cereal in your room if you want,” Dean tells him, like he has the power to ground his tall adult brother. Eileen snorts.
“Is this good for you?” Dean asks, quiet. The movement of his lips makes Cas’s fingers move a little, too.
“So Cas is staying?” Sam says. Dean blinks. He hadn’t even considered another option, one where Cas would leave. He should have. Loving someone didn’t mean you’d stay. Dean knows that as much as anyone. He knows it more, now, after Cas’s love for him had dragged Cas away to the Empty. Cas had left him so many times over the years, and Dean had never stopped him. He wonders how long Cas had loved him. If Cas had loved him when he fucked April, he also loved him when Dean kicked him out of the bunker.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean to make you think I was him. It’s – I thought.” Dean cuts himself off before he can reveal that he would have let Cas use him as a pillow because he wanted it. Still wants it, now. He’d like nothing better than for Cas to lie back down, head all the way on Dean’s lap, and stay there. He wants – wants Cas to let Dean hold him.
Dean is glad for the alternative topic, especially combined with a chance to make fun of his brother. “Yeah?”
“I came back to you,” Cas tells him, and Dean remembers that, too. Remembers finding Cas with his wife. He wonders how she’s doing now, and he wonders just what she and Cas had done before he ditched her for Dean.
“I didn’t know it was cool to use a vacuum as a sex toy these days,” Eileen says, effectively crushing Dean’s hopes at a truce. Sam’s eyes water a little. He’s trying not to laugh. Dean sighs. Of course she and Sam are going to team up on him. Dean doesn’t know what else he should have expected.
Dean mumbles something. It’s muffled. Cas pulls his fingers out and waits for him to talk, but he keeps his other hand where it is, starting to massage Dean’s scalp instead of hair.
“Good,” Dean says, and he means it. Eileen is great. He’d be glad to have her around even without how happy she makes Sam.
Sam comes back to the kitchen with Cas in tow. Cas doesn’t speak. He just looks down, at where his fingers are folded together, with no ring.
“It’s not an issue, is it?” And Dean gets why Sam would be suspicious. He’s said enough shit over the years that probably didn’t age well.
He picks up a picture from the nightstand, and he’s corporeal enough to shove it at Cas. It’s of what must have been their wedding. Dean and Cas are holding hands in the picture, dressed up all nice.
Dean stares it down. Of course it’s wearing Cas’s face. “I’m not going back to sleep. You gotta ask yourself if it’s worth it, bitch. One human and one angel for never getting to rest again.” Dean had threatened a lot of people before, but he’s not sure what other leverage he could have over the Empty. Cas had said, long ago, that it didn’t like being annoyed. Dean could do annoying.
Cas flips the lights on. Dean covers his eyes with his other hand, protecting from both the brightness and Cas’s gaze. But Cas sits back down, and Dean calms himself. Cas isn’t leaving. Dean’s hand flops down on the cushion between them, open with the palm up. He wants Cas to touch him, even if he’d drown in the contact like he’d drowned in his grave after Cas revived him, dirt in his mouth as he clawed desperately for the surface.
“But I don’t think it was really five years,” Cas says. He moves back and sits down on the bed. Dean isn’t sure where to go, so he just stands there. Cas continues. “I don’t think it was actually more than a few minutes. I think the rest of it was just stuck into my memory. It feels – different, like remembering a documentary. It wasn’t ever truly my own life. I think the Empty only constructed it in a hurry when it felt Jack trying to pray to us. The first time it felt real was when I woke up just before we got out.”
Maybe they’ll find something else to burn, just for the symbolism. One of Dean’s flannels could work. Cas doesn’t have much to burn. He’s wearing his trench coat. Sam and Jack can find one of his ties. And maybe the ashes of the two will get mixed together, and that’ll be enough. Dean had spread Cas’s ashes once before. He’d rather die with him than do it again.
Dean can’t do anything except let his brother steer him out of the room. Jack is walking in front of them, pausing every few seconds to look back and stare.
“What do you wanna do to me?” Dean says, fingers pulled out of his mouth. He’s still slurring his speech a little anyway. Whatever Cas wants, he’ll do it. Not because he owes him. Because he wants it. He’s already gotten plenty out of it. But Cas wants to take care of him, and Dean wants to let him. He wants to just curl up in it, let Cas pet his hair and ribs and listen to Cas tell him how much he loves him until more words can’t fit in his ears.
“I’m going to make breakfast,” he announces, and the bloody jacket falls off his lap when he stands up. He picks it up. He really should wash it. His back is not happy with the movement.
Dean chats with Jody on the phone for a few minutes. It’s all small talk. He tells her about the bug in the shower, and she talks about her daughters. Apparently Claire has sobered up since she talked to Cas. She has to go, and Dean just sits with the phone and walks to the couch in his Dean-cave. He wants to wait up for Eileen before he knocks out on the mattress outside of Cas’s room, but he’s tired. A drink sounds – not like a good idea. It still sounds like an idea he wants to do anyway.
“You’re what?” Dean says, and he wishes he wasn’t sober. He dies for less than a week, and Cas’s toddler becomes a deity.
“Cas,” Dean has reached the pleading stage. “You go with me, and I’ll do anything you want. We get back to Earth, you just ask, and I’ll give it to you, okay? You want another kid, I’ll get you one. You want me to marry you, I’ll do it. I’ll – whatever he did, I’ll do it too. I’ll pretend I’m him. Promise. You won’t even know the difference.”
Cas’s voice is soft. He cradles Dean’s face with one hand. “I told you that everything you’ve done has been for love. I learned love from you. I don’t know how you don’t think you can love. I don’t know what else you think it is when you cook for your family, or when you put bees on my slippers. That was how I found you in Hell. Your capacity for love was what shone through. I love you, not any other version of you.”
“And then after?” Cas is saying, but he’s certainly noticing Dean’s movements. “I’d like for you to get something out of this as well.”
Dean wakes up on the couch sometime in the middle of the night, his back in knots. But Cas is there. Cas’s head has slipped further down on Dean’s shoulder so it’s almost resting in his lap.
The thought of Cas with anyone else makes Dean want to shatter the glass in his hand. He doesn’t say anything.
He walks the rest of the way through the door. Maybe Cas lives here now. He can find the bedroom, and that’s where Cas will be asleep. Dean can wake Cas up from whatever coma the Empty has put him in.
But it hadn’t. It had been the Empty’s mirage of Dean, too. Cas had told the projection that he loved him.
“I am. Good morning,” Cas tells him, and he wraps himself all the way around Dean’s midsection. Dean freezes. Cas wouldn’t usually do this. Dean doesn’t know what to do, so he just sits, lets Cas cling onto him. It’s nice. He could stay like this.
Dean looks at Cas and thinks of the Empty telling Dean he didn’t know what he wanted. He wants to be the other Dean, the one who could make Cas happy. He isn’t that guy, can’t be. But he wants what the other Dean had had.
“Yeah, sweetheart,” Dean tells him, voice slipping in and out of haziness. “I’ll let you put ‘em in. Bet you’ll make it good for me.”
“I have to stand up to cook,” Dean warns him. It’s not that he wants to go anywhere. He’s just pretty sure that his smell will drive Cas out of bed soon enough anyway. Cas lets up a little, and Dean untangles Cas’s arms from his waist. He stands up, but he leans back over to kiss Cas.
Cas gets back out of the shower in time to place his order. He isn’t wearing the trench coat, and Dean relaxes a little. Cas is down to jeans and a t-shirt. Neither fits him well. The clothes are just borrowed. The jeans especially look a size too small and ready to rip down the seams at his inner thighs. That’s an image. And his arms are visible, too, solid enough that they could hold Dean up even without powers. Dean hadn’t considered enough the protection the trench coat gave Dean from constant distraction.
He has access to more bare skin now, and he can’t leave it alone. Not with how Cas sounds, and he’d forgotten that Cas has a tattoo. He strokes it to feel the muscles under his abdomen twitch. He can feel Cas’s hands on him, too, one petting the back of his neck and one a few inches above the back of Dean’s waistband.
He cuts out stripes of black felt, and then white teardrop shapes. He gets them pretty close to the same size. The edges are a little uneven, but it shouldn’t show.
Maybe Dean could do that much, at least. He’s not capable of a functional relationship, but he could make Cas feel good. Just for that. It could be a consolation prize. Besides, Dean had promised to do anything Cas wanted if Cas came back, pretend he was what Cas had lost. And it still counts, even though Cas didn’t come back willingly.
Cas unceremoniously drops the trench coat into the liquid. Dean had taken more care than that of it after Cas’s death by Lucifer. He’d patted it down, just in case there was something in one of the pockets that would help revive him. He didn’t find anything that could break the laws of the universe to get Cas back, of course. The only thing in the coat’s pocket had been a cassette tape. Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx. Dean had burned that with his body, smelling melted plastic in the smoke.
Cas suddenly yanks his hand off Dean’s face, like he’d only just realized what he was doing. Dean doubts that Cas had ever had to wake up Dean’s Empty lookalike. The other Dean wouldn’t get nightmares. He’d be able to hold Cas all night and never wake him.
“Anything else I can do for you?” And Dean wants Cas to say yes, wants Cas to take whatever he needs from Dean. Just so Dean has an excuse, can say he’s only doing it for Cas, can lie to himself that he doesn’t want it too.
“Goodnight, sweetheart,” Dean whispers, and Cas nuzzles into the back of his neck. He’s holding Dean, breathing quietly into him. Dean is just wrapped up, cocooned in Cas’s touch. Sam had told him to get a weighted blanket, once. This is better. Dean sleeps easily.
“My bed – memory foam. Could be easier,” Dean says, hoping that his string of words makes some kind of sense. Cas stands up, and Dean grabs his hand, because otherwise they wouldn’t be touching at all, and he can’t risk that, can’t risk getting lost. “Need me to carry you, sweetheart?” The pet name makes Cas react again, gripping Dean’s hand and splitting his face into a smile.
“Then I don’t know what I can do for you.” And that’s the full truth. Dean doesn’t have anything real to offer Cas. He just looks down at his lap.
It’s a house. A cookie-cutter, picket-fenced home with a nice lawn. He doesn’t recognize it. It’s just a random house. Boring gray paint, mailbox out front. The works of suburbia. It might be their house, something the Empty is providing to keep them out of the way. And it’ll work, Dean thinks. He’ll take it, a mirage life with Cas there. The only thing familiar is the Impala, sitting in the driveway, sparkling clean.
“You gotta know what I want by now, Cas. I – you’re it,” and the admission doesn’t choke him like he thought it would. The Empty still doesn’t appear to take Cas.
“Dean,” Jack yells in his head, a cross between a psychic phone call and a prayer. Dean smiles. That’s his kid. “You don’t have much time. You have to get out.” His voice is distant, not like he’s there, not really. He can’t see Jack in the portal, but he can hear him. Maybe Cas can too.
He gets half-lost in Cas’s soft touches to his shoulders and hair while Dean goes down on him, handling Dean like he’s a jewel. Dean can’t say anything in response, considering his position. He just looks up at Cas and blinks hazily, gripping Cas’s thighs tighter. Cas says he loves him again when he comes, repeats it once more when he gets Dean flipped onto his front. He tells him again, afterward. Each time, the Empty doesn’t appear for him.
“You got a knife?” Dean asks him. Dean had lost one of his when Cas took it to cut his hand for the sigil, and he hadn’t wanted to be near one since.
“Leave more,” Cas tells him. Dean moves to a new spot and resolves to get that one covered too. He’s not 19 any longer, and Cas certainly is much older. Hickeys shouldn’t be that hot after you hit middle age. But Cas is into it, and Dean isn’t about to deny him anything.
“Dad? Where are you going?” Jack says, and his lip is trembling like a little kid. It’s not him, not the real Jack. It’s the Empty’s corrupted version, the wax figure brought to life to serve its own purpose.
“You stay? Sleep in my bed, and I’ll make you breakfast. We tie-dye over your trench coat, and I show you the bumper stickers I’m going to order for Baby. Maybe we can take a drive, hold hands in the car. You want that?”
Dean stands up, reluctantly. Cas looks like even more of a mess from this far back where Dean can get a full picture. His hair is messed up, lips parted, shirt open. He’s breathing hard.
“Two?” Cas gets out, and Dean nods. Dean moves his hand down to Cas’s wrist. Cas keeps his index and middle fingers together, and he puts them just through Dean’s lips, so the pads are over Dean’s teeth. Dean sucks them in deeper, then runs his tongue over the tips. Cas’s thumb strokes Dean’s cheek, right up to the corner of Dean’s mouth. Dean feels Cas’s hips move, and he tightens his grip on Cas’s thigh, guiding him until Cas is grinding down on him in a pattern. Dean would ask if it was good, wants the reassurance, but Cas grunts, and Dean would have to give up the fingers to speak. Dean jerks his hips up too on Cas’s next thrust, as much as he can while pinned.
He takes a shower first. The Empty goo didn’t leave any visible traces on him, but he still feels dirty. He feels like he’s washing off Cas’s touch, too, but he has to keep going.
He manages to get into and out of the bathroom without anyone talking to him. He runs his fingers through his hair, shutting his eyes as he remembers Cas doing the same. The shower is already off, and it’s not worth turning it back on to jerk off, so he goes to start eggs.
“No,” Cas says, and Dean can feel Cas’s eyes on him. “Dean. I want to know that this is real. I never lived the memories I have of that other life. I’ve had memories taken and added before. This was the same. The Empty was messing with my head.”
“I shouldn’t have made you come back here,” Dean says, and he focuses on the TV. He tries, anyway. Dr. Sexy hasn’t been his type for many years.
Dean walks through another closed door. This one is another bedroom, and he was right. Cas is there, sleeping on the bed with his head turned toward the door. He looks peaceful. It’s a far stretch from either the expression of bliss when Cas confessed or the despair when Dean followed him through.
Cas’s eyes are roaming him, and Dean is conscious of how the wet clothes might be clinging to his body. It’s uncomfortable for him to be this soaked, but it probably looks good to anyone who might find him attractive. Dean puts his free hand in his pocket to push his jeans a little lower on his hips. He doesn’t look down, but he knows there’s a stripe of skin visible, and he sees Cas struggle with where to put his eyes before he looks straight at the floor. Dean wishes he’d been wearing a t-shirt, something that’d go see-through, be a real treat for Cas.
“You think I’m going to fall for the Purgatory trick again? You push me through and make me leave you here?” Dean says, and he grabs Cas by the wrist. Cas struggles against him.
“Go get Jack,” Dean says. Maybe his brother and Eileen will be a little more merciful to him and Cas in front of the kid. Sam leaves, and it’s even more awkward.
Dean pauses, and he wants to believe Sam, but Sam doesn’t know half of it. Cas only wanted one thing, and it was for Dean to get all housewife on him. Then. “How did you know he was gay?”
Cas takes a turn stirring the bleach. He takes the dowel from Dean, and for a second, their hands are touching. Through two layers of yellow gloves, but they’re touching. Dean just wants to leave his hand there, let Cas curl his fingers around it.
Dean remembers Cas looking at him in the barn all those years ago, asking Dean if he didn’t think he deserved to be saved. “I’m not good for it, for you. You’ve seen that enough by now. I can’t – poetry and flowers and shit. Dating or long-term relationships or whatever. I thought you couldn’t love for a few years, but you can. I’m the one who can’t.”
The pictures on the walls of Dean’s home are often crooked, knocked to the side during games that go past the edge of rowdy. His carpet is worn down in places from his visitors’ various shoes. The art he hangs up is all Jack’s, scribbles that even Cas has to admit don’t look like anything in particular. Cas leaves his slippers in random places and makes Dean fetch them for him before he’ll get out of their bed in the mornings. The garden outside is a mess of disorganized flowers and vegetables with no discernable pattern. His car is covered in bumper stickers, decals of bees and Cas’s pop radio stations and Jack’s favorite cartoon characters slapped on randomly. It’s all real.
And Sam shakes his head. “No. I just. There’s a baby sticker with angel wings? You know Jack’s just as tall as us, right?”
And Dean had almost forgotten that everyone else had been gone too, too wrapped up in his and Cas’s own deaths.
Cas’s phone rings again, just a few minutes later. He’s ready to tell Sam to leave him alone, but it’s Claire who is calling.
“Anyone want to set the table?” Dean says, and Sam is looking for something to do that isn’t just standing there, so Sam gets plates down.
He’d told Cas it was weird to watch Dean sleep, once. Dean does the same thing now. It’s a rarity to see Cas vulnerable. Cas has spent so long basically impenetrable to most weapons. The times Cas had been vulnerable, he’d been hurt. Or dead. Dean feels another wave of jealousy of April the Reaper. She’d been one of the first to see Cas like this. And she’d used him, and then killed him. Dean wants to curl over Cas, wrap him up so nothing can hurt him again.
It’s not a great idea for Dean to entertain any sort of fantasies about someone who is currently asleep on him. He tries to shake himself out of it, remember that he can’t, that Cas wants someone else, a version of Dean that Dean himself will never be able to recreate.
Dean wraps a hand around the back of Cas’s thigh. He lifts it up, hoping to get a leg hoisted up around his hips.
“No. I loved you then too. She pretended to be human and offered me shelter,” Cas says. “I thought about you.” He gives Dean half a smile. Dean can’t return it.
Cas sits down next to him in some kind of weird pajamas before Dean can stand up, and Dean remembers that Cas has to sleep too, now. He’s not sure where Cas got them. The shirt has buttons. He doesn’t know why Cas would wear a buttoned shirt to sleep. It’s also long-sleeved, and Dean feels a little deprived at that. But Cas has been cold recently. It makes sense for him to dress like a grandpa. Dean should get him a stocking cap too.
He misses Cas more in retrospect. Cas’s death via Leviathans hadn’t crushed Dean the same way he’d been destroyed after Lucifer gutted him. Dean hadn’t known at the time what he wanted. Back then, Cas had just been another friend he’d failed. It hurts, too, that Cas had been married to Daphne and happy without Dean. And Dean had taken him away from his wife. Dean looks away, and Cas notices the movement.
It throws him to the ground in frustration. “I can’t do anything with that. You don’t even know what you want.”
“When else did you get your memories changed?” Dean asks, because apparently Cas hasn’t been through enough of Dean’s questions. Dean knows a lot of Cas’s history. He hasn’t heard about that.
He wonders how he hadn’t known then that Cas loved him. Carrying a mixtape until you died is something else, something more than romantic. He doesn’t even know if Cas had any device that could play the mixtape. But he still isn’t sure how Cas thinks he loves Dean now. He might never get it. Maybe Cas just doesn’t know what love is. Dean had shown him too many romcoms.
Sam walks out of his room a while later. Dean has changed into pajamas by then. He’s half nervous that Sam will try to continue their earlier discussion. He taps on the tablecloth Jack had thrown over the table to glue together some kind of 3D model. He’d said it was a blueprint for a building in heaven.
“You told me,” Sam points out. “And he’s my friend too. It’s not an issue for me, okay? You deserve to be happy.”
“That’s why you didn’t call her before,” Dean says, a rare moment of sensitivity. “You were fucked up about her dying.”
He gets the brightest yellow slippers he can find. And then he hesitates, because slippers had been the one thing Cas had asked for. Dean should put more work into the task than buying the first thing he sees. But they’re fuzzy, look comfortable.
“What do you want from me, Dean?” Cas asks, and Dean shakes his head. He can feel Cas’s eyes on him, searching him. It’d be easier if Cas would just look at him like something consumable, something he could use up. Not somebody who he wants to keep forever.
“Is there anything else you think would make it more like the other place?” Dean is still looking into the far corner of the room. “You had, like, a nice coffee machine, right? Anything you want me to do?”
He sits down on the floor outside of Cas’s room, listening for any sign of movement. Nothing. He checks his phone for the first time since emerging.
Cas doesn’t say anything. Dean wonders if he’d been dreaming, maybe about being back in the Empty with his fake Dean. The last time Cas had been human enough to sleep, Dean had wondered if he dreamed of heaven, of his angel family. Dean wonders now if Cas had always dreamed of him.
Or maybe Cas will already be awake inside, waiting for him, and Dean can run into his arms, kiss him like he should have done years ago. Cas deserved a kiss. Dean would do it.
“I don’t want to go,” Cas says, and more Empty apparitions are right behind him. Mirages of Dean, Jack, Claire, Sam. All begging Cas not to leave him, explaining how he’s better off here.
He just sits, nausea setting in. He’d – Dean had dragged Cas through. And it wasn’t like Purgatory, where Cas wanted to stay out of some self-punishment. Cas had been happy, in the Empty. And Dean had taken Cas away from his husband and son, the same way Cas had taken Jimmy. He can try to justify it, say that it’s always better to live in reality, but it isn’t. He’s not sure what he thinks Cas has to lose here. Dean had promised him he’d try to be like the other Dean, but they both know that he can’t. He’s no good for shit like that. Relationships just can’t happen for him, not ones that last.
“Probably nothing, for you,” Dean tells the kid. He won’t notice a damn thing. Eileen waves back at him.
“Why not?” Sam says, and he’s pushing at the seams of everything Dean has been hiding. “You can. He won’t kick you out.”
He remembers the nice coffee machine from the hallucination. Maybe Cas liked fancy coffee. The mirage of Dean would make it for him. The real Dean turns on the coffee pot, the same one they’d inherited from the Men of Letters. One setting.
“Fine. I’m disappointed in you. I thought you were going to sort your shit out,” Sam says, and Dean flips off the closed door, even though Sam can’t see.
Cas can’t do that any longer. Any time Dean fucks up his organs from now on, he has to deal with the consequences like any other guy.
“Fuck,” Cas says, and Dean hasn’t ever heard him say that, or say much in that vocal register. He doesn’t take the finger away, though, so Dean pushes it deeper into his mouth. He can feel the saliva on his own finger, too, tongue moving over both of them. Cas’s chest is warm over him, and Dean keens at the skin-to-skin attention.
“Okay,” Cas tells him. Dean fills up on the view, of the sight of Cas on Dean’s sheets. He pulls the blankets up back over Cas.
“I’m making both,” Dean tells Sam, and then checks to make sure that there’s coffee in the machine. Sam had started it.
Cas takes a few deep breaths. He looks wrecked from his position over Dean. Dean can see hickeys blooming on his neck, and Cas is staring between his own fingers and Dean’s mouth. Dean feels up the front of Cas’s pajama pants. Cas lets out a keen.
“A few days. Chuck’s not a problem anymore. Everything’s okay now,” Sam says, and Dean nods, running a hand over his eyes. He should care, want to know more about what dangerous players might still be a threat. He really doesn’t give a shit.
Dean moans around the fingertips. It’s a weird sort of hot. Cas says something again, probably some bullshit about Dean’s soul or whatever that would make him turn red if he wasn’t already pinned to his mattress, humping his best friend and begging him to fuck his mouth with his fingers. He tries to make it good again, tries to suck hard enough that Cas will either shut up or talk more.
He moves to flip them over, and Castiel Winchester, former angel of the goddamn lord, just fucking lets him. Cas lies on his back, legs sprawled to the sides. Dean strokes the inside of one thigh through Cas’s too-small pajamas, watching how Cas reacts. Dean likes them, wonders if he can get Cas to wrap them around his head sometime until he can’t breathe in anything else.
“I’d love it. I love you,” and Dean is dropping through the vortex. Maybe Cas is right, maybe there’s something left in Dean that he didn’t know was still there. Cas believes that, and Cas kisses him like he can force the belief into him through his mouth.
“Cas is missing,” Sam tells him. “And I know you’ve been worried about if he’s okay since he got out of the Empty.”
Then Dean is outside the house, sitting on the lawn. He stands up suddenly, and Cas is standing there next to him.
“It’d make me happy, too,” Dean tells him, knowing he’s going to be shut up again very soon. He feels Cas inhale hard at that.
They all split off after lunch. Sam takes off. He still hasn’t had a chance to corner Dean about their last discussion. Cas puts the dishes away, and Jack goes to his room. To apparently do God stuff, now.
He knows why he’d grabbed onto Cas, and why he’d pulled Cas out of the Empty. It’s not charity, it’s selfishness, because he can’t stand losing Cas again. He’d made Cas lose his paradise because he was too scared to deal with life alone.
“You can make him happy here,” Sam says. He doesn’t know shit. “I mean, he does have a family here, and that’s us. And maybe he wants to get settled down with some guy, I don’t know. But Jack’s his kid, too. And a lot of what he had over there would just be stability, and not having to deal with apocalypses. We have that now.”
Sam is dying to ask what happened. Dean can tell by one look that it’s on the tip of his tongue. He glares at Sam and shakes his head in a symbol of don’t-ask-what-we-were-doing-in-the-Empty.
Cas is right that it’d be better for Dean’s body to be back on his memory foam, but he’s too worried that Cas will disappear in his sleep. Dean isn’t sure he’d be able to shut his eyes, not without getting fucked-up drunk again.
He’s effectively a widower now. Dean shouldn’t have forced him to leave. Maybe Cas hates him now. Dean would understand.
Cas is wearing a full ensemble of fake-Dean’s pajamas. They don’t fit him right. And his mouth is half-open, eyes widening. Maybe he’s remembering something.
He’s pretty sure that this fake-Dean doesn’t drink too much. He doesn’t get angry and say things he can’t take back. He’s probably in the Empty’s fake neighborhood watch and PTA.
“Yeah, he just. Said something about it. I’m not sure he even meant to tell me. It just sort of slipped out,” Dean says, which is the complete opposite of Cas’s planned-out monologue.
When he blinks, Cas is dressed in the same clothes he’d been wearing when they died. The goddamn trench coat. And he looks at Dean with something Dean can’t identify. It’s certainly not love. Cas is pissed, maybe, if Dean had to guess.
“I’ll blow you, and then you can go wild, okay?” It sounds awkward, even to Dean, but he doesn’t need to worry about awkwardness with a man who doesn’t get social cues whatsoever.
He’d had nightmares about Cas’s deaths before, especially after Lucifer gutted him. But they usually faded once he got Cas back. And Cas is back now, however reluctantly. Dean’s spine hurts, too, from sleeping on the floor. He winces at the tension in his neck.
Dean himself tries to stop it, tries to push the illusory Dean away from Cas. It doesn’t do anything. His hands pass through. All Dean can do is watch. It should be him. And this isn’t actually a shifter, just an element of Cas’s fake life generated by the Empty. It’s only a mirage, which can’t hurt Cas, at least.
“Well, Sam can’t be cooking, because he can’t cook for shit. Cas isn’t eating burned waffles,” Dean tells her. Sam flips him off.
Cas moves his fingers to the inside of Dean’s cheek and puts his thumb on the outside where Cas can feel the bulge of his own fingers through the skin of Dean’s cheek. Dean’s mouth is just – wide open for him.
“Hey,” Sam says, and he walks to Dean. He tries to put a hand on Dean’s shoulder, then sees the bloody handprint. He goes in for an awkward waist grab instead. “Let’s get you out of here.”
Dean relaxes. The Empty had implied that they had, but it was lying, and Dean wants to sink down next to Cas in relief.
“’m good with this,” Dean tells him, and he’s snuggling further into the side of Cas’s torso. Cas had stood up to turn the lights off after, and Dean had gotten a more complete view than he’d had all night. Dean throws one arm over Cas’s midsection.
“I can’t look at him,” Dean slurs, because he’s already spilling his guts. “He walks around in the trench coat, and he died in it. I just see it, and I see him getting taken again.” Because it had been a constant. Cas had always worn one, which meant that he’d always been wearing one when he died, except with April. Dean had fished it out of the lake when the Leviathans made him walk in, and he’d held it in his hands again when he had to burn Cas’s body, pulled the mixtape out of the pocket. Dean hates it. So much. It’s a weird tangent for his mind to be on and he’s not sure how much of it he’d said aloud.
At least Cas is happy here. One of them should be. Dean had only had a second to see Cas’s reaction when Dean ran at him, but he’d been heartbroken. He’d wanted Dean to live. If he thinks Dean is alive and that makes him happy, Dean will take it.
The Empty’s projection is standing uncomfortably close now. It grabs him by the chin and looks into his eyes. Dean’s arms flail, but he can’t push away.
He could let his head drop down to Cas’s shoulder. Stay there until the timer on his phone to stop bleaching goes off. Maybe the contact would be brief enough for him not to get addicted. Dean doesn’t think he’d be able to ever stop if he touched Cas now, not without the worst withdrawal of his life. He loves him. Nothing he can get will ever be enough for him, and if he sets his sights too high, he’ll fall so short.
Dean feels the withdrawal from not touching Cas any longer, and he knows they’re about to talk, really talk. Cas is going to make him talk, at some point. Maybe he should wait until it’s not the middle of the night where it just seems so easy to speak to the dark and pretend like Cas won’t hear it. But he can’t. He’s spent years as a satellite, maintaining just enough speed to keep Cas’s gravity from making him crash through the atmosphere down to the ground. He’s going to have to fall.
“It’s very – beautiful. To watch. I enjoy – seeing it,” Cas continues. It’s an awkward sort of dirty talk, but it’s working for Dean, just the reassurance that Cas wants him. “I like seeing you happy.”
“He’s not your type? So what is?” Dean must hate himself to be trying this much to get Cas to talk about other men. Hot celebrities. Anyone other than Dean. Because maybe Dean wants Cas to show interest in a single other person, because then Cas has a chance for a happy life with someone else, a life he deserves. Maybe Dean will get over him then.
Dean buries his face in Cas’s neck and opens his mouth. Cas lets out a noise that Dean hopes won’t wake anyone else. One of Cas’s hands flies up to hold the back of his head in place. The other hand is groping at the hem of Dean’s shirt, pulling it up to get fingers bare on his lower back. They’re making out on the couch like teenagers. Dean sucks on his neck, hard, where Cas is holding his head. He moves his face to the other side of Cas’s throat. He takes the skin between his teeth and keeps it there until he can be sure it’ll bruise.
Fake-Dean kisses Cas. It’s quick, with the projection of Dean just leaning down for a peck on Cas’s lips. And Cas responds, pulling him in by the shirt collar for a moment.
After Cas’s previous death, Dean hadn’t even had the guts to tell her himself. He’d made Sam call and break the news.
Dean tries to remember what teenagers say to each other now, and then he tries to think of the most embarrassing way to misuse teen slang.
“You’re not going to try to send yourself back to the Empty, are you?” he asks. He thinks of Ephraim, the Rit Zien who had believed that Cas was in so much misery that he would be better off dead.
“I know,” Sam says, and Dean hadn’t thought enough about him and Jack, finding the sigils but no bodies to burn. Trying to mourn both of them, and apparently everyone else in the world, while defeating God. “Jack was able to pray to Cas. That’s how we found him, and you were there too.”
Cas is sitting closer to him now, and he tilts Dean’s head with his free hand into eye contact. Dean wants to push into the touch, bury himself in it. He wants to fall the same way the coin had.
Dean blinks, and he is alone in the Empty. He looks up for Cas, for Billie, for anyone. It’s all dark.
Dean looks up, and Sam and Jack are both staring at them. Dean gets to his feet, then pulls Cas up too. He keeps the touching to a minimum.
Claire was his surrogate daughter before she was Dean’s, after all. Maybe Dean should be the one to call, but he doesn’t have any good advice on dealing with things. He’d probably be more drunk than she was.
“You’re going to have to run for it,” Jack prays to them, and Dean feels the moment when Cas relents.
“Um. Yeah.” Dean doesn’t know how well she’ll react to the news that he’s hooking up with her father’s resurrected corpse. “He’s just tired.”
He’s covered by a hastily wrapped towel, but he’s okay. He’s not hurt, not bleeding from an injury, and not gone. The shower is still running behind him.
Cas wants something like that too, if Dean knows how to read a body. Cas’s hands are on Dean’s lower back, and he’s pulling, holding Dean in position like he’s scared the Empty will come back to try to take him away.
Dean doesn’t look back, doesn’t even think his plan through until he’s standing in the middle of the supermarket.
“That you’re all torn up about Cas dying, but you don’t think you deserve him staying with you,” Sam says, and at least he’s being honest. Dean groans. “And I think you meant it,” Sam continues.
“You gonna be here when I wake up?” Dean asks. He can guess the answer, but he wants the reassurance.
He’s not sure how Cas is even going to look at him without seeing the face of his mirage husband. Maybe Cas is going to move away. Try to replace the fake Dean with another man. Maybe have kids. Dean wonders if Cas will even let him visit them. He’d understand if Cas didn’t. Dean’s record of raising Cas’s kids without threatening them with deadly weapons at some point isn’t exactly successful.
The only difference between this kitchen and the real one in the bunker is the coffee maker. It’s much nicer here. It has flavoring options that Dean doesn’t understand.
He goes back to his room and looks at the slippers. He should just give them to Cas already. Cas had wanted slippers. He hadn’t specified fancy slippers.
“Yes,” Cas says. “It’s-” he’s struggling to talk, but Dean stops sucking and waits for him to say more, just leaving Cas’s fingers resting where they are, keeping his mouth half-open around them.
“Jack’s the one who woke me up?” Dean had kind of figured, but he hadn’t been into critical thinking or trying to understand how he’d gotten his chance to leave. He’d just been glad to take it.
He had thought he’d be the one taking care of Cas, but it seems like Cas could go for it the other way too. Cas finally strips his own pajama shirt all the way off, and Dean isn’t sure where it ends up. Cas gets Dean’s shirt off too before he starts kissing him again, tracing over Dean’s tattoo. Cas moves his mouth down to Dean’s neck, imitating what Dean had done to him. Dean can feel his stubble. Maybe he could get Cas to grow it out like he’d done in Purgatory.
“You were indulging me,” Cas says. Dean is pretty sure he’s about to go into a speech about how it’s in the saying, not the having, or some shit like that about how Dean doesn’t need to pretend to love him. He doesn’t want to hear it.
“I talked to Sam,” Cas says, before Dean can leave the table. Dean shouldn’t panic. Sam has at least some sense of not telling other people what others said while intoxicated. He wouldn’t have told Cas anything important. Dean panics anyway.
“You’re going to run out of batter,” Cas says, pausing. “You should save some for yourself and Sam.”
And Cas might let him, if Dean tried to hold him. He might let Dean lie on top of him where no angel blade is going to get at him, where the Empty would have to go through Dean if it wanted Cas. This is better than Dean ever thought he’d get. Cas is here, alive, and showing no sign of leaving. Sam is happy and working his shit out with Eileen. Jack survived everything. They’re all free of deals. It’s better than Dean deserves.
“The angels, or?” Sam remembers, too. The angels had been Cas’s siblings. Cas had lost all of them. Sometimes willingly, because he chose Dean.
Dean can’t remember how many pictures of them were ever taken in real life. It’s not like they ever had time for photo ops. He reaches for one of him and Cas smiling at the camera before remembering that he can’t touch. His hand passes straight through it.
Dean keeps pulling, even as Cas tries to slow them down. Cas starts resisting him more the closer they get to the portal. He breaks Dean’s grip and backs away.
“I don’t care for all of my father’s creations. Arthropods were much easier to deal with when I could smite them,” Cas says over the sound of water, and Dean smiles despite himself. Sam snorts a little bit.
“Cas,” Dean yells out as a warning. “It’s not me.” And he tries to touch Cas again, but this time he can’t.
Jack is the only one who doesn’t pick up on anything when Cas walks into the kitchen. Predictably, Cas is wearing a v-cut shirt that shows most of his marked collarbone. It’s definitely Dean’s shirt. His hair is still wet from his shower, and he has the bee slippers on. Dean grins at him. Sam looks between them and snorts.
Cas’s pajama shirt has buttons, for some reason. Dean doesn’t want to pull back from Cas’s neck long enough to lift it over his head, so he doesn’t. He’s fine with undoing buttons, especially when it gives him a chance to grope at Cas’s chest. He gets the shirt open. Dean pushes it so it’s back on Cas’s shoulders. He wishes that he could see Cas’s arms, but. He’ll have time. They’re doing this again.
“We don’t have much time,” Jack says distantly, and he sounds like he’d wired a speaker through the entire place, and Cas looks up. Cas can hear him too.
“How long have I been here?” Dean isn’t sure that the Empty will bother answering, or if anything he gets will be truthful.
He’s next to Cas’s side in an instant, and he’s going to kiss him. As soon as Cas wakes up and Dean gets tangible enough, Dean is going to kiss him. He’s going to kiss him like it’s the end of the movie and they’re standing in the rain. He owes Cas that much, at least.
Dean can’t tell Jack that he killed a bug. Jack would be all upset about it. And he’s – God, so a temper tantrum wouldn’t be ideal. Maybe he already knows, omnipotence or whatever. Maybe he’s just being polite by asking. Dean doesn’t understand the kid.
Cas should be out soon. The last slices of French toast are almost done. Dean gets a cup of coffee poured for Cas between flips.
“I love you,” Cas pants out, and Dean just wants to wrap himself in the affection. Dean watches out for Cas’s bad knee and shifts himself down.
“He should be somewhere else,” Dean says, and his voice shatters. And he knows Sam must sort of get it, must understand that if they care about someone enough to want even a friendship, they should also care enough to not let them get hurt. They should know it’s better to be away from anyone they don’t want to watch die.
Dean has a chance to respond this time. Cas isn’t going anywhere or to anyone else. Dean can process the confession now. He can barely remember the last one. He’d been too fucked up, knowing that Cas was telling him goodbye. This isn’t a farewell, and it’s – freely given, not used as a weapon. Cas loves him, wants him. Cas told him because he wants Dean to hear it this time. Dean is the one crying a little now. Cas wipes Dean’s face with two fingers.
And Dean tries not to grimace at the memory of Meg, although at the time he sure hadn’t complained about watching a hot demon make out with his even hotter friend. Dean certainly didn’t have any moral high ground there. He’d kissed people in front of Cas before. Including Anna. That was a douche move. He’d hooked up with Cas’s sister in the backseat of his car. And he still drives around in that car, often with Cas. Damn.
“Fine,” Cas spits out, and then they’re both sprinting down the stairs. They could go a little faster if Dean let go of Cas’s hand, but he’s not risking that.
And Dean cringes, because he’s scared to hear it again. Scared that the Empty is going to show up for Cas again, if he says it. He makes the mistake of looking back at Cas, and Cas has the same brilliant smile he’d had before he was taken. He looks the same, too. He’d never changed out of his trench coat. The only difference is the stubble that is a little more present now.
“That’s good – yes,” Cas says, and Dean knows he’s too far gone at this point to ever go back to occasional friendly pats. He used to treat hugs from Cas as a delicacy. Now he’s feasting, on fingers and pressure where Cas is straddling him, and Cas is going to stay. He’s good enough that Cas is going to stay and keep him filled up on contact and promises to keep loving him.
He can’t stay indefinitely. He has to get up at some point, go explain to Sam that he’s done sleeping on the floor by Cas’s doorway. He’ll probably have to give Jack some kind of talk too.
“I’d like some slippers,” Cas says. He’s not even looking at Dean. He must be cold, now, after he’d gotten used to divine climate control.
And Cas hadn’t even wanted a life with his angel siblings. He’d wanted a life with Dean. Dean had denied him for a decade, and he wasn’t done breaking Cas’s heart. Because Cas is going to find out that he was wrong about Dean, that Dean isn’t the most caring man on Earth.
“That sounds,” Cas says, and then spends a long second searching for words. He doesn’t seem to be able to come up with anything flowery, but the break in his voice speaks for him. “Good. And after that. Tomorrow. What do you want then?”
“Sorry – the left knee has been – since I got back,” Cas sounds out of breath. Dean thrills at that, at the effect he’s had. Cas’s voice has plummeted below even his usual register. The lights are still on, so Dean can see his pupils blown out too.
Cas’s thighs are open over Dean’s hips. Dean reaches his spare hand down to put on one through the pajamas, and it’s big, solid, pinning him. The seam on the clothing feels ready to just tear with how much his leg is straining the fabric. Dean resolves to never get Cas pants that fit. Dean squeezes close to Cas’s ass, digs his nails in a little. Cas’s hips jerk, meeting Dean’s.
Dean is the first to land on his own bed after the door clicks shut. It’s the first time he’s been on it since before the Empty came. He’s on his back this time, and Cas kicks off the slippers and crawls over him.
“Anyone want a sandwich?” Sam says instead, and it’s so inappropriate for the aura of the room that Dean almost laughs. Dean shakes his head again. He might throw up if he eats anything.
The hangover is less intense now, seemingly mitigated by either Cas’s brief presence or the impromptu shower. Dean runs back to his bedroom and changes out of the wet clothes before Sam can try to bring up anything too close to the gut.
Cas looks tired when he shuffles out. He’s still wearing the trench coat and the clothes he’d been wearing when he died. He gets a cup of shitty coffee before he even looks at the food. He takes one pancake at a time but just keeps going through most of a stack. He didn’t eat much throughout his angel-hood, and that all must be catching up now.
“Goodbye, Dean,” Cas says, and Dean lunges at him. He wraps both arms around Cas before he can push Dean away. This isn’t what Cas had wanted. Cas had wanted it to be a sacrifice. He’d wanted Dean to move on, have a life without him. Dean can’t let that happen. Cas was going to die with a soft smile, but now he’s staring at Dean in horror.
“Not really,” Dean admits. “I don’t remember most of it. I thought you were about to die, so. Couldn’t really pay much attention. It was a lot to take in.”
There’s a design that’s labeled as a beekeeper, but it doesn’t look much like anything in particular. It just looks like the stick figure is standing by a weird barrel with dots. The gardener one is cuter. Dean remembers the garden in front of their home in the Empty, wonders if Cas would want a garden here. He skips over the option that is holding a Bible.
Dean lands on top of Cas, and their skulls smash together. That’s probably good, because it gives the real Jack enough time to wave his hand and shut the portal, and that way Cas can’t try to jump back through.
Eileen is the next one up. Dean abandons the stove for just a second to hug her. She’s wearing one of Sam’s shirts. It’s far too large on her. He doesn’t know if Sam had told her about his whole situation with Cas. He’s guessing not. Sam and Eileen probably wouldn’t have been saying much. They probably fell right into reunion/you’re back from the dead sex with no complications, because they’re adults who know how to talk to each other normally. Or, somewhat more normally than Dean and Cas, anyway.
“Oh.” And the implication there burrows somewhere into Dean’s stomach, that Cas knows Dean has been attracted to men before. Cas certainly won’t judge him for it. He has enough else that he could judge Dean for. “Was it the cowboy boots? You don’t like the cowboy boots?”
Cas can’t have what he wants, not with Dean. Maybe it’s something else that’s confusing him, the fact that Dean was the first human Cas was ever friends with. Cas just needed to get to know other people. Then he’d know Dean wasn’t special.
Dean reaches for him, grabs onto Cas’s hands. The contact is enough that Dean can barely stand it. Much more and he’d be drowning. He looks at the wedding ring. Dean could – he could tell Cas he loved him back. That might get him to go with Dean. Dean opens his mouth to say it, and he can’t make the words come out.
Dean wakes up with Cas still cuddled up to him. He doesn’t think Cas is awake, but he’s there, breathing softly. Dean is a little cold, because his pajamas are still on the floor somewhere, and the blankets have all tangled up by their feet. Cas is warm, though.
“Are you alright? Do you want to stop?” Dean asks, and he’d be okay for Cas to just hold him and kiss him on the forehead for the rest of the night. It all seems sudden, an instant shift from emotional discussion to making out, but he’s been thinking about it for long enough, and he’s guessing that Cas has too. He’s done circling. This is the fall.
And now Cas is going to go back. To showering. He’s going to take the towel off and run his hands through his hair under the water. Maybe put his hands on other places, too. Thinking about Dean, and that’s an image Dean enjoys. Or he’ll think about fake-Dean, and that makes Dean want to find another bug to smash. Maybe he’ll think back to the memories the Empty had given him and use those.
“Cas had a deal with the Empty to make it show up and take him. And he used it to – to catch Billie. Dumbass thought it’d save me. And I sort of jumped in with him.” He’s dodging around the most important part of the conversation, and he’s sure that Sam can tell. He tries to put spin on his words, use the right amount of frustration and bravado in his tone to keep Sam thinking Dean just followed Cas as a bro thing.
“I don’t know,” Cas says, and he blinks a few times. “I can’t remember.” And it’s breaking Dean’s heart, to watch Cas’s happiness falling away, and being the one to take it. He keeps going.
Dean nods. His head still hurts too much to cook, so he asks if everyone is good with ordering pizza for lunch.
He’d gone all out buying sauces. Cas tries a bite with every one of them. Sam just goes for some fancy mustard. Dean takes Jack’s burger and draws a crooked smiley face with ketchup before he hands it back.
Jack just looks at Cas, and he brings out the puppy-dog eyes that had always worked so well on the angel, whenever Jack wanted anything at all.
It’s already awkward, because talking to someone who you know is banging your brother is awkward in itself. The shower turns off, so Cas is probably on his way out, which definitely won’t help, because then both Dean and Sam will be in the position of talking to someone who is banging the other’s brother. He refuses to let Eileen help cook, saying that nobody who recently died should have to cook.
“Was that good?” Cas asks, and Dean could laugh. Cas was nothing if not eager for approval. But – it’s not like Dean isn’t the same way.
“Oh,” Dean says, then wonders how many things he’d done that Cas didn’t know about. He’d held Cas’s face a few times, but only when Cas wasn’t conscious to see it. And he tries not to think about anything he’d done after Lucifer stabbed Cas. Cas didn’t know. He’d never seen Dean begging God to bring him back, or trying to find out if Jack could return him, or injecting himself with something to stop his heart. Dean doesn’t know what Cas remembers from being possessed by Lucifer or if he’d even heard Dean scream for him. He hadn’t seen Dean make Gadreel revive him. Cas had also known that Dean was praying to him in their first trip to Purgatory, but he hadn’t seen how far Dean had been willing to go.
“I can walk,” Cas says, but he lets Dean wrap himself around him. They shuffle more than walk to Dean’s room so neither has to let go. Dean spends most of the time praying that Sam and Jack don’t wake up and that neither of them trips on the air mattress outside of Cas’s room.
Cas snuggles his face all the way into Dean’s stomach, and Dean’s heart breaks a little bit, just a few inches above where Cas thinks he’s someone else.
“Roll to your other side,” Cas instructs. Dean does it without complaining, and it’s worth it when Cas wraps arms around him and presses his entire body to Dean’s back. He rubs Dean’s front, like Dean is at risk of forgetting that he’s there.
He thought he’d be able to kiss Cas when he rescued him, but no. They’re all just sitting there. Dean can’t even force himself to reach out for Cas. His hands won’t move.
Dean is no stranger to various entities attempting psychological warfare on him. His usual method is just to repress it. “Okay. So why am I awake?”
“He told me about the overcoat,” Cas says, and Dean nods. That’s probably the least embarrassing part of everything he’d said to Sam. “He said that it bothers you.”
“Good,” Cas says, and Dean finally sees the indent in the sheets next to Cas, and he gets it. This other Dean isn’t even real. He’s just part of Cas’s dream life hallucination.
Cas nods, and Dean pats him on the knee when he stands up. It’s not near enough. Dean wants to throw himself onto Cas and just lie there, soaking up proximity to Cas like he’s tanning. He wants to put his hands in Cas’s hair and just play with it for the rest of the day, let Cas sleep on his shoulder.
And no, Dean doesn’t. Because Cas would either describe Hugh Jackman or whoever, or he’d talk about Dean. He’s probably into middle-aged dad types who barbecue. If Cas says he likes the attractive young celebrity of the week, Dean will kick himself.
Dean stares into the mixture. Cas is right next to him. He could put a hand on Cas’s waist. It’d be easy. And he’s wearing the gloves, so maybe that would make it even easier. He wouldn’t even have to deal with direct skin contact. But there’s no point, then, not if he’s touching Cas like he’s acidic.
“I’m sure he’s fine,” Dean calls. Cas is stirring behind him now, and he buries his forehead in the back of Dean’s shoulder.
Cas hums. “Usually, you weren’t exactly functional. I would be healing another wound, and just catch that too.”
“I don’t know what to put for Cas,” Dean tells him. The current stick figure has angel wings. Dean doesn’t much like it. It’s not accurate any longer, and it sounds like Cas is happy to be human now. Besides, maybe the angel wings were supposed to be for dead people. He hates that.
Cas’s skin is heated from the water, and Dean wants to hold on to it. Cas can probably smash a bug just as well as Dean can, after overcoming the initial shock. Still. Cas’s fake version of Dean would have killed it for him. And Dean – he just likes the idea of doing something to help Cas. He can use this to make Cas think he’s good, convince him that he can be the version from the Empty.
But Dean had never thought of a future where Cas can stay, and try to fit in. He doesn’t legally exist, and he certainly doesn’t have a job or viable training.
Cas pulls the fingers out suddenly, and Dean doesn’t want them to go. He tries to chase them with his mouth. Cas keeps his hand close to Dean’s face, though, and he uses his thumb to wipe off the spit from the corner of Dean’s mouth. It’s really a pointless gesture, because Dean’s mouth is still open and he’s pretty sure it didn’t make a difference, and Cas’s fingers are coated and wet. Dean appreciates it all the same. Cas holds them in front of his face, lets Dean look at them, at how they’re shiny all the way down to the palm, at the slight tooth-shaped indent on the lowest segment of Cas’s middle finger.
“I can’t cook either,” Eileen says, and Sam smiles at her like they’re kindred spirits. Dean refrains from commenting about how gross it is because he’s pretty sure he’ll need their mercy for when he and Cas inevitably act gross too.
“Yeah, ‘s good,” Dean tells him, like any words would say more than how his legs had been shaking, or how he’d tried to shove Cas’s spare fingers back into his mouth to muffle himself when he was about to come, or how he’d cried out into the room when Cas said he wanted to hear it.
“It’s okay,” Cas tells him, and it’s gentle. “Once I brought Sam back from the Cage and forgot his whole soul.”
No, it’s the wedding rings on Cas’s finger. The picket-fence house. The endearment given so freely. Dean can’t do that. He’s pretty sure that holding Cas’s hand would make him combust, after so long subsisting on scraps of shoulder-pats, the occasional hug, and Cas touching him to heal him.
“I’m not the creeper who sleeps outside of his room,” Sam tells him, rubbing his forehead where it had hit the floor.
Cas announces that he’s going back to bed, and Dean nods. He still feels the guilt for waking him up. Jack leaves too, probably to play the Sims. Or maybe reality is his Sims now. Dean doesn’t know.
He – he can touch Cas now, even though neither of them is dying or coming back from the dead. So he does. He lets go of Cas’s hand and puts both of his hands onto Cas’s broad shoulders, arms, back, whatever Dean can reach. He knew that one kiss would break the dam, and it did. He wants to drink Cas in like this. Stay there forever, clutching at each other.
“You see any other bugs, you let me know,” he tells Cas. “Don’t bother asking Sammy. He’s tall, but he’s scared of ‘em. Always made me handle them when we were younger.”
And that. Dean can’t – he can’t tell people that. Especially when it’s true. He was going to say it back. He really was. Before. But it would have been easier in the heat of the moment, with adrenaline rushing through him and not having to deal with any consequences. He could have said it then, because Cas deserved to hear it.
Dean throws the bloody jacket over his bed. He isn’t sure what else to do with it. He gets changed and starts to pick up the knives he carries. He thinks of Cas, taking Dean’s knife to cut his hand open, and he sets all the knives back down on his nightstand.
It’s not what he wanted from his first morning free of apocalypses on the horizon in years. He’d never expected to make it that far with everyone still alive. Dean isn’t sure where he’ll go from here, but he’d hoped it wouldn’t be right back to the nightmares.
Dean doesn’t answer. He’s pretty confident he’d just go back to the nightmare. Or to a different nightmare, of Cas dragged into a lake by leviathans or gutted on the ground. His subconscious has a lot of material to choose from.
“You can borrow clothes from us, in the meantime,” Dean tells him. He wants to offer Cas his own clothes specifically, but that’s too close to what he wants. If Cas walked around in one of Dean’s flannels, that would be it. Maybe he’d roll up his sleeves, too, and Dean would just fall to the ground from visible skin. Maybe it’d be tight over his chest, too. Dean couldn’t survive that, either.
He piles the cart with everything for a good dinner, more than burgers. It should be enough to serve ten people, so he’s hoping it’ll serve two regular guys in their forties, plus a freshly human being, and… God.
“Oh.” Dean doesn’t know how else to respond. He should say something supportive, drop a sympathy card quote. Or he should hug him.
That succeeds at pissing Sam off. He glares and takes a step back from Dean. Sam hadn’t talked about her by name since she and everyone else apparently disappeared and reappeared. Dean doesn’t know if something happened between them or if Sam is just being a coward, too. He learned it from the best.
“Dean,” Cas says, and that time he does pull a little on Dean’s hair. Dean’s hips jerk up again at that, and Cas raises an eyebrow.
“Yes. So very much,” Cas says, and Dean thinks that maybe if Cas can say it over and over, push the words into Dean’s mouth with his fingers, he can forget all about what happened the first time Cas had told him. Cas puts one hand, the one clear of saliva, into Dean’s hair and pets it, runs his hands through it. All the attention and touch are just spoiling Dean, spoiling him rotten, ruining him for anyone else. He’s warm under it, and under Cas. He opens his mouth again. He can imagine what he looks like.
Dean ignores him and gets out a pan. He hears the shower turn on, so either Cas is out of bed, or Jack has decided to play with boats again. He’s a little grumpy that Cas isn’t with him at the moment, but it shouldn’t last long.
Cas groans, and it’s not good this time. Dean pulls back immediately and looks at him with a question, tracing Cas’s face with his hand. He manages not to panic. They haven’t talked this out as much as they should. Maybe Cas feels attraction different than humans, doesn’t want anything past the romantic element.
Dean zones out until the evening, letting himself get swept around. He announces his retirement for the night early.
And it’s not that Dean doesn’t want to make Cas happy. He wants that too. Cas – nobody deserves to be happy more than Cas does, and Cas had apparently decided Dean would be the one to make him happiest when he was dumb enough to fall in love with him. Dean would take the place of the impostor if he could.
Dean grabs Cas’s free hand and lifts it up so he can kiss the back of it. Cas strokes his jaw, pulling his face back to watch better. Dean wraps his index finger around Cas’s. He kisses the tip of his own finger, then of Cas’s. Dean turns his head into it and guides their entwined fingers into his mouth.
Dean’s retching, suddenly. He always did hate portals. He crashes down on one of the kitchen chairs and gestures at Sam to go after Cas. Jack stays with Dean. Nothing’s coming out of his stomach, but Dean wipes his mouth anyway.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” it asks, and Dean hates that smarmy-ass voice. “You think he’ll be happier with you? Angels don’t get to go to heaven. He loves it here.”
Or he could kiss Cas, but the Empty’s vessel had done that too. They’d probably done everything, over five years, or at least Cas had gotten memories stuck in of them doing everything.
“It’s okay,” Dean says, and he remembers djinn dreams. He – he should go sit down next to Cas on the bed for this conversation. He’s sat next to Cas before, many times, in closer quarters than this. It’s not a big deal.
“I can sleep by your room if you’re worried,” Cas says. But that feels like a betrayal for Dean to be comfortable when Cas is on a shitty mattress.
Dean bunches up the tablecloth in his hand. He looks at the initials carved again. More middle school shit, but he likes the idea of his and Cas’s initials next to each other. He could draw a dumb little heart around it, or a plus sign between. He doesn’t entertain the thought for long.
“It’s fine,” Dean lies. He hates the thing. But it’s Cas’s, and he can’t ask Cas to get rid of it. It’s like the one thing that’s been constant for Cas, even when Dean wasn’t there. He’s always had a trench coat. Not always the same one, since they keep getting destroyed, but he’s had one since he took over Jimmy. And he thinks it might be kind of a comfort thing for Cas. He’s almost jealous of it, how it had been there with Cas when Dean couldn’t be. “I can’t ask you to get rid of it.”
He sits down a while later and eats his own breakfast. Sam and Jack are done. Cas is still cutting up sausage with his knife.
He’s intangible. Dean is pretty sure he’s been like this before, doing some kind of astral projection.
“Fuck off,” Dean says eloquently. Between the two of them, it passes for punctuation. He takes another drink of water, this time as a cover for his complete lack of words.
“Goodnight,” Dean says. The mirage Dean would tell Cas he loved him, give him a goodnight kiss. Then he’d get into Cas’s bed and give him more than that.
“Eileen got here last night. I didn’t want to wake you. You were all cozy with Cas,” Sam says, and that makes Dean look. Sam isn’t meeting his eyes, staring down at the table instead. Dean isn’t sure how Sam expects him to react. Eileen is fun to have around, and she makes Sam happy. Besides, maybe Dean can make a deal with Sam. Sam won’t comment when it’s obvious that Dean and Cas have been hooking up, and Dean won’t say anything when he can tell that Sam and Eileen have been doing the same. They could work out some kind of truce. Sam had told Dean the night before that Eileen was on the way, but Dean had completely forgotten. He’s not sure if Cas knows.
“You don’t have to try to be him,” Cas says, and the words sit heavily between the two of them. “You’re not him. That’s okay. I’m glad.”
“You want that, sweetheart?” he repeats, and he gets treated to a full-body shiver from using the endearment.
“I think so,” Dean tells him, and he manages not to panic. “I mean, he hasn’t said anything else. And – Jack’s here.”
Dean isn’t sure he knows how to love like that, in a way that doesn’t demand anything back. Except he has, for Cas. He has spent years thinking it’d be enough if the angel stayed, if Dean could just be somewhere within Cas’s orbit, spiraling for an eternity until gravity eventually made him crash.
“It’s all yours. Whatever love you think I have. It’s for you. You can take it, Cas, just. Kiss me,” Dean tells him, because he should have done it years ago. He can do it now, with nothing bad happening. His reasons for denying himself seem far off.
And now Cas has done two big confessional speeches, and Dean has done zero. He almost jerks to check the walls for the Empty coming back to take Cas again. But Cas doesn’t end the speech by telling Dean goodbye.
“I’ve searched the whole bunker. He’s not anywhere,” Sam continues. “His room is empty. It doesn’t look like he slept there last night.”
They won’t leave anything behind. Sam and Jack will never know what happened, never have bodies to burn. All they’ll be left with are traced sigils and a God to kill.
“So turning human turned you gay?” Dean blurts out. Sam would probably smack him for saying it like that, but Cas just tilts his head a little like Dean’s making a far point.
And – the April thing. Dean had thought about it a lot, right after. He’d imagined everything about it, but he hadn’t tried to understand why Cas had done it. Dean had thought it happened after he knew she was a reaper somehow.
Dean could crawl off him, kneel on the floor next to the couch and push Cas’s legs apart, suck bruises into his thighs instead. But he’d have to give up contact for that, and he’s not willing to move away from Cas for even a second. He just keeps going, and he’s running his hands through Cas’s hair and trying to feel up his stomach. Cas makes an encouraging noise when Dean palms at the front of his pajamas. Cas’s head is thrown back, and that gives Dean a better angle to suck on his throat. Cas had given Dean blanket permission to mark him up. The Empty’s illusion had never had Cas like this. And April – Cas hadn’t been in love with her, and Dean can make it better for him than she could.
He pulls his hand away. Cas stirs it on his own. Dean treats himself to a look at the movement of Cas’s arms.
Dean doesn’t say anything. He could tell Sam everything. It might be better. It’s all going to explode out eventually, and it’s better to detonate early with Sam than risk the countdown hitting zero with Cas. He still can’t make himself say anything, about how Cas can’t have him here. He’d say he was just a good friend, and good friends will go along with it if your true happiness is kissing them. That isn’t true, and he knows it.
“But it wasn’t real. You did the right thing bringing him back,” Sam says, and of course he would say that. They’ve lived through enough djinn dreams and alternate realities.
He’s not sure how long he sits in the dark. He only jolts up when Sam trips over him in the hallway.
Cas eats, but Dean keeps catching him watching Dean chew, the movements of his jaw and throat. Dean almost chokes when he sees Cas’s eyes flick downward, at where Cas’s own fingers are gripping the fork a little too tightly.
Jack is the first to wander in for breakfast. He didn’t even really sleep before he was God. Jack is God, and that’s the weirdest damn thing in Dean’s life. He still wasn’t sure on the specifics of how that had gone down, or how that’s going to work in the future.
