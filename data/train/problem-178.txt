“I never would have thought you would the first time,” John said coldly. “Are you done up here?” He stalked away, though he didn’t enter the stairwell until he was sure Sherlock was following.
“He has before. For the most part.” Mycroft glanced at the window. “There were two times he’s done this. Redbeard he replaced with ash. Victor he replaced with a seven percent solution. They’re nothing but faint memories now. Life lessons if you’d rather look at it that way.”
Clearing his throat, Mycroft glanced away, as if disinterested. “Because it is important that I am kept abreast of developments in the lives of those who interact with my brother. If it is simply a business arrangement, then I am less concerned.”
“Africa, perhaps India. Somewhere where he can have mobility. People need good men, good doctors. John Watson needs a place where he can be good, even if he strays.”
Anthea raised her eyebrows, and then gave a small sigh. “Would you like a list of all acquaintances you have with silver wings sir?”
“No. I’ve learnt my lesson.” Sherlock looked away, looked out the window, eyes focused on a distant point. “Many times,” he murmured, almost soft, almost inaudible.
Sherlock scoffed and fluttered his wings, turning away from the roof’s edge. “Honestly, John. Does he think I would repeat the last rooftop incident?”
Mycroft scowled. “You know that will do nothing Anthea.” He signed and handed the tablet back. “They'll be stuck like this until I sort out who’s causing this nonsense.”
“I love you, John. I will not say it often.” Sherlock searched John’s eyes. “I won’t change. This won’t change me.”
“I’m rather surprised it took you so long to call. Yes, Sherlock is ‘all right’ and yes, I do know his location. You however, will no longer be privy to such information.” Mycroft leaned back in his chair, twirling a pen as he kicked his legs up onto his desk. “I’m going to put this in no uncertain terms. You’re to stop calling Inspector Lestrade, Miss Hooper, and most importantly, Sherlock. You will have your things cleared from Baker Street in the next day, as that is the end of the timeline Sherlock set for you, and you will not attempt to return there to speak to him.”
“Why not?” John suddenly felt his stomach drop as he saw Sherlock’s wings, still just as black as they were the day they’d met. “Oh. Oh. I...Oh. Right. Sorry. Just cause mine are...you know. Doesn’t mean….Right.”
“Perhaps you did. Or do. I don’t quite know any longer, and I can’t be bothered looking. But you run, John. You stray from anything that has the power to make you happy. And I won’t be a part of that. I’ve fought for too long to have myself. I won’t give myself to someone else who will simply leave.” Sherlock turned again, and left, his steps on the stairs measured and steady, John staring after him.
A small buzzer went off, and Anthea stepped in moments later, setting down a tablet. “Your signature, sir.” She set out a bottle of wing oil as well, and a small dish of pasta. “Your lunch and the oil you requested sir. Would you like some wing dye?”
Mycroft sighed. “If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, can you imagine what real people are like? I’m living in a world of goldfish.”
John moved to the bed, laying down.  Holmeses. Specifically, Sherlock. The cause of most of his trouble and angst. Heartache even. Greg and Mycroft might manage to get together, but him and Sherlock? No way. Sherlock wasn’t...well, Sherlock wasn’t interested in anyone. Let alone him.
“Since the very first day he arrived. The case, Lestrade.” Sherlock looked down at him, holding out his hand.
Mycroft looked at their joined hands, and then brushed his thumbs over Greg’s knuckles. “I am aware. And I do not know what this will mean for my brother, but I must trust that he will be able to continue on without John.”
“You thought you loved me. But if you had, this wouldn't have happened. And if you had known the way I loved you, love you still, you never would have let her sit on your lap. I'm nearly surprised you didn't break the chair with your rocking and bouncing, but really, enjoy the memories when you’re sitting there. It's all you'll have now. Be gone from the flat, have all your things moved out in the next two days.” Sherlock turned around, case in hand and headed for the door.
, can be loyal and stay, but you will always stray. You have always done so, and you will always do so.”
“I said not now!” John snapped, shoving Sherlock’s hand off his shoulder and turning, wings flaring out.
“I expect you to be three pounds heavier by Monday. The diet isn’t working, Lestrade will never fall for you if you continue to put on weight like this!” Sherlock called as Mycroft strode out, wings flared at the tips and belying his obvious upset.
John smiled, the kind that had his eyes wrinkle at the corners, and his ears get a tiny flush at the tips. “Good. Good.”
Once they got down, Sherlock flounced over to Greg explaining the case in quick, clipped terms. John waited, and then once he saw Sherlock had finished, he turned on his heel, walking away again.
“What was that about?” Greg asked, looking at him in confusion. “You and John...when did that happen?”
Some people had it harder. Had their soulmates change, die, or even sometimes, had it turn out that they had more than one. And then other people….
Mycroft didn’t reply, though the music he was playing suddenly changed tone, becoming something darker and heavier. Frazzled, and volatile. Greg breathed out slowly, and took a seat on one of the chairs in the room, listening carefully to all the things Mycroft wasn’t saying.
Mycroft’s frown deepened, and he pushed open the door, taking in the papers pinned along the wall, the music notes inked in messy lines along them, and the completely silent man standing in the middle of the room, fingers steepled under his chin.
John took another sip, choking as Mycroft’s gaze turned on him, cold and calculating, intended to stop his thoughts in their tracks. The choking caught Sherlock’s attention, and the man came over, snapping at Greg as he checked on John, shuffling his wings in concern. John waved him off, and escaped up to his room, watching out the window as Greg stalked off, and the shouting from below resumed as Sherlock started in on his brother.
“Yeah, I have, and yeah, we did, but that doesn’t mean we’re engaged. She’s helping me out with my new cat, he’s a rescue, and sorta nervous.” Greg stared at him. “Mycroft, why are you so...aggressive about this?”
John shook his head, watching Greg and Sherlock argue. At first, he’d thought that maybe the pair were soulmates. But then he’d seen the way Mycroft’s feathers were slowly bleeding sliver, the tips looking as if they’d been swirled in a canister of molten nickel. And the way Greg’s under feathers were shot through with auburns and ambers.
“Duchess of Cambridge. The shopkeep. There, solved them both,” Sherlock said, nudging the files off the coffee table with his foot.
“His wings finally changed,” Sherlock replied, looking up. “Continue on with this...idiocy. Explain the case you have for me.”
John sighed and came in, picking up the scattered pages, and tossing them down onto Sherlock’s stomach. “You can be an utter tosser sometimes, you know that, right?”
?” he sneered. “Didn’t think, wasn’t thinking, didn’t mean anything. Words, John! Just silly words. Congratulations, really. You've done what so many have tried and failed to do, and then threw it away for a quick
Mycroft turned as the last strains of the piano faded out. “You’re awake,” he replied. “Very good. You need to have another shake.”
“So...what happens now?” Greg asked looking out the window with him, frowning as a first few raindrops hit the glass.
Mycroft blinked after her. “Honestly. I will never understand that woman.” He stood, taking the oil with him into the bathroom, rolling his eyes as the phone call continued on.
Mycroft gave him a sarcastic smile. “Friends. Of course, you go in for that sort of thing now.” He gestured up the stairs. “Feathers need a bit of preening, Sherlock.”
“Don’t.” Sherlock turned away, leaving the room. “I’m going to Baker Street,” he called out as he passed Greg in the sitting room.
Sherlock tipped their foreheads together, wrapping his wings around John. “So...Can I stop plucking them?”
John smiled. “Yes. Please do.” He tilted his head, and pressed their lips together, seeking out a chaste kiss.
“I’m not getting married.” Greg stared at him. “Do you think that…” Greg glanced at his wings. “You don’t think that this is because of Molly, do you? I mean, first off, her hair isn’t actually red, she just dyed it that way last month. She actually hates it.”
“I want you for everything. Because of everything,” John said. “Everything that makes you, you. That’s all I want, Sherlock.”  Sherlock reached forward, cradling John’s face in his hands. John trailed off, whatever he was saying lost as he gazed up into Sherlock’s eyes. “Sherlock?” he murmured.
Sherlock met him halfway, in this as in all things, hungry and dominating, seeking control with only half an idea of what he was doing or where he'd end up.
Groaning, John rolled onto his stomach, letting his wings flare out and relax, closing his eyes as he listened to Sherlock and Mycroft’s grumbling.
John looked from me to her, watching and waiting. I stood slowly and went to Sally, reaching out my hand to hold one of hers.
I reached over and placed my hand on the back of his head, and brought our foreheads together, just touching. And kissed his brow before letting go. I had nothing to say to John at that moment, but had much to think about. This was not a good development. If MacDougal truly believed what he said, that John had gone to the other side, a man like him would feel justified in doing anything he saw fit in response. And I wondered at the mental toll on John, spending nearly every day in the company of toxic thugs. Things were getting messy, and messy things were impossible to control.
“Ok,” he said, “Mycroft gave me a couple of names, people he is looking at. There are a couple of pubs they are likely to hang out at. I go in, spend some time having a pint or two, watch a game - I can get a conversation going and see where theyʼre coming from.”
Shit. Shit shit shit. My mind filled with reasons why John would have been unable to complete his message. Hopefully he merely needed to cut it short because he realized someone was coming. Hopefully no one saw him. Hopefully no one grabbed his phone from him, hopefully no one was pummeling him to his death at this very moment, hopefully…
“STOP IT!” My own voice, loud in the empty room. Self-torture was a waste of energy that would be better spent keeping a semblance of mental balance as I moved forward with our plan, and I dressed carefully for the afternoon’s performance. Everything else would have to wait, including a few choice words with Mycroft. Even as I headed out, I had to reluctantly admit to myself that he was in fact a master manipulator. As I headed for the rendezvous I was in the mood for a fight, even recognizing that Mycroft had played John just as he was playing me.
“John?” He had to be here. We were right on top of the signal. There was a stairway going down on our right and I heard a movement.
He looked devastated and I could not bear to see his face. I turned abruptly and stormed off. I wanted to text him immediately, as soon as I was out of sight, to reassure him that I meant none of it, to beg forgiveness (ah, there was a surprise, I actually felt it badly, kept thinking of his face). But I did not want to text too soon, let him get out of the range of the witnesses at the cafe and the girl with her mobile so that his relief would not be a matter of public record.
He and Sally followed as I strode out the door, Lestrade calling instructions to one of the teams for backup as we went. A text came through from John at that moment.
As I began to work on the lock, I kept up a constant patter to John, “really you are even a worse idiot than I thought if you think I can’t manage to get these off you in under a minute, you completely underestimate my skills, John, I’m surprised at you, surprised and disappointed both…”
“Look, Sherlock, if anyone can figure this one out, you can. I can keep a discreet eye on what is happening here, but I’m not privy to MacDougal’s planning. I’ll see if I can ask around. Discreetly.”
“Is that what you call this? I don’t think so.” I was angry, and to hell with the audience. The medical staff looked at each other, uncomfortable.
He looked up into the harsh light, and carefully shook his head, ‘no’. I carefully walked forward and stepped over the wire. Lestrade and Donovan followed with equal care. John was still shaking his head and when I tore off the duct tape he gasped, “get out of here, get out. Sherlock, you have to get out,” and I was examining the handcuffs (damn!) that held his arms behind him, around the pillar, and I was screaming at Lestrade to get the bomb squad back here as quickly as possible, hurry, and he ran and I was telling Sally to get out as I pulled out my lock picks, and John was hurting, clearly, white as a sheet and one arm was swollen, likely broken and still telling me to get out, “no time, Sherlock, not enough time,” and I told him “SHUT UP JOHN.”
“It makes absolutely no sense, Mycroft!” I began pacing. “Subterfuge is, well, let’s just acknowledge that it is not John’s strong suit. You have plenty of government-trained spooks whom you can send down this particular rabbit hole to see what these fine gents are up to. Agents who are trained in the fine art of living a lie, unlike John whose heart is prominently displayed on the sleeve of every shirt he owns! Why are you doing this!”
“As for those thugs, well… It wasn’t just about stopping them, Sherlock. Don’t get me wrong, I am delighted to have done so. But you know, well, ever since I got back from Afghanistan I’ve wondered…”
“Oh goodie, I can hardly contain myself. No... actually I can. Let me know when you wish to share your secrets, I have an experiment that requires my attention.”
“Sherlock? What is it like for you to walk into Scotland Yard after all the water… under the bridge or over the damn or whatever…”
“Christ, Sherlock, it was a lot more than the usual foul language and kidding around.  I’m used to that sort of thing, it’s just how we talked in the service pretty much all the time.  But tonight… I guess I would say there is something… a kind of hostility behind the jokes, you know?  Not the sort of good-natured ribbing guys do when they are just trying to size you up.  Nothing good natured about this crew - lots of paranoia though, so that was charming. But I think I can find a way in, to see what they are up to."
“Look, Sherlock, I do realize that you are worried, whether you admit it or not. You don’t need to apologize. If it makes you feel any better, Greg and I talked about how I can signal if things get sticky, so I can get some backup…”
“I don’t know how you weather these things, Sherlock. I want to slug someone pretty much every time I walk through that door and see those guilty looks. They were just so damned smug, so self righteous, so sure they were right about you. When they could not have been more wrong.”
“Let us wait until the good doctor gets here. I have come to discuss something that involves you both.”
And then the medics were upon us in their pandemic gear, dragging gurneys over the rubble, and I was trying to see what they were doing with John while they were trying to talk to me, asking stupid questions I could barely hear and I was batting them away.  I saw John strapped in a spinal brace and being lifted to the gurney and then it was my turn - they were accustomed to non-cooperative patients and had me strapped into the gurney quickly and efficiently. Sally was on her feet and they were helping her along as we were removed from the building out into the night air and the people and the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles. It was too much, and I closed my eyes again.
I spent the next hours online, gathering everything I could find on the group known as The Squad. They initially got together as a loosely organized bunch purportedly to play rugby, and perhaps more to the point, to drink together afterward. One of the group, Jack Davies, dishonorably discharged from the service, seemed to hold some authority judging by his presence in the news as well as his Youtube Channel where he spouted venom about immigrants and foreigners, and any government figure he deemed soft on crime. Nothing too original there. But he seemed to have a certain charisma, an ability to inspire others to follow him - and there were certain veiled threats implied in his rants as he carried on about how long are “we” going to watch our country being taken over by foreigners.
I sat down next to him on the floor by the fire. Leaned in and whispered, “they think you’re normal.” I smirked. “We both know you are not.”
As I walked into the Visitor’s Room, Mycroft had already pulled up the feed to Jack Davies’ office on his laptop. The video revealed a conversation regarding technical details of materials and personnel. John appeared to be stationed by the door, armed with a Glock - not his usual piece, but effective.
“I… um… Look, Sherlock, this is not what it seems, she jumped on me, I had absolutely no interest in her…”
My mobile rang shortly thereafter and I closed my eyes with a deep sigh of relief when I heard his voice.
“Ah, ok then… I guess. At least we have that cleared up. So… are you going to tell me about ‘normal’ now? I can’t wait.” He was chuckling now, leaning in to stoke the fire. “And what prompted you to share this insight about my character at this particular moment?”
“Look you wanker, you never trusted me, you are INCAPABLE of trusting anyone, no matter how much they run after you, tell you how much you matter, prove to you every sodding day that they care!” And he launched into a blistering string of invective - he always had a talent for the creative use of language - which culminated in his letting me know that he had “fucking had it” with being tricked and made a fool of by me.
I snickered as well and Mycroft again rolled his eyes. “I would advise you both to take this seriously. Any cracks in his story” (Mycroft glared at me) “and John will be in greater danger. You and he will stage a fight, a very public fight, perhaps in a coffee shop where you will have plenty of witnesses and one of my operatives can be present to get a video on her mobile. She will then post it to her Instagram account and to YouTube where it will no doubt, ‘go viral’ as they say. So make it a good one.  After the fight, John will go stay in a bedsit we have arranged. And you, Sherlock, will need to keep your distance, no more sneaking behind his back to follow his every move.
The GPS took me to a forsaken area outside a run-down industrial park with a number of large hangers, formerly storage for large machinery. I took my place in a copse of dense thickets at a discreet distance from where the men were gathering. Pulling out my binoculars I saw an area clearly set up for target practice. I was too far to hear the conversations, but close enough to have a plain view. When John emerged from an SUV I tracked his movements closely. it being a day with a damp chill, he was wearing his black jacket and leather gloves which he removed in preparation for positioning himself to shoot. Will drew Jack over and introduced him to John, who nodded and shook his hand. Jack’s stance was clearly challenging, his body language that of one accustomed to dominating the group. He barked something at John, who stood army-straight, nodded again, and commenced to shoot.
At my indignant huff, he merely smiled. The doors at the Diogenes Club close softly no matter how much force one uses. A pity.
Will: “Let’s see what he can do with a gun. He’s always got his on him, seems to know his way around a weapon, I wouldn’t be surprised if he turns out to be useful. We’ve got time to try him out on a couple of smaller jobs before the big day.”
“GODDAMN IT! Goddamn it, Sherlock you know damn well that is not what I am talking about. Stop trying to divert this into something it isn’t. I WANT this assignment. For me! This is not about you competing with Mycroft, this is about my having an opportunity to do something that matters. Something I am uniquely suited for. Can you not see that? Why can you not see that!”
“Christ, I should have known!” Now he was chuckling too. “So you managed to keep an eye on things, of course you did.” His voice became deadly serious then. “So looking at the chemicals and equipment they’re putting together out there, I’d say we’ve got a bombing in the works, not sure exactly what the target will be but could be a news office, a mosque, even a politician’s house. I’m just not sure yet where they’re going with this.”
“Sherlock, I know I owe you one. A big one, after what you went through with the Yard. And I consider John a friend, a good friend, never mind his bad temper and PTSD…”
We sat and ate without dressing, and I counted up every bruise revealed on his skin. I speculated about the ways I could make MacDougal pay for each and every injury. I am not a good person, much as John persists in believing otherwise. And I have a powerful imagination.
“So what DID you intend, exactly? We were already on board with your plan, and as if that wasn’t toxic enough you had to provoke things further. John does not need the humiliation, particularly while he is in the middle of doing a JOB FOR YOU!”
I laughed at this. “You have not seen roaches until you’ve seen the inside of a crack house, John. These can’t compare, not even close.”
“Do you really believe you have any say in the matter Watson, you arrogant little tosser? You got off easy last time but I think you’ll find you’re not so lucky now.”
A miscalculation on my part. I could see Johnʼs neck stiffen and shoulders square. His response was downright mulish.
“Alright mates, that’s enough,” a third man shouted, “we really don’t need a riot,” with John and Will laughing as John extended a hand to Will, helping him up and then righting the table. They all agreed that more whiskey was in order, and as John approached the bar approximately a half dozen uniformed police barreled through the door, pushing other patrons out of the way as they surrounded the group. John held up his hands in a gesture of peace, saying “sorry, sorry officers, we’ll pay for the broken glasses,” with Will drunkenly leaning on his shoulder and giggling slightly, saying “yes of course, we’ll take care of it…” just as the officers grabbed each of them and handcuffed them, marching them towards the door.
I felt as if I were under water. I tried to draw a deeper breath but could not get past the knot in my chest. John looked a bit worried.
Will: “C’mon mate, you saw the pictures - which were hilarious by the way.  First we see our little Johnny with a nice girl in his lap on the front pages and then that huge blowout with the old boyfriend all over Twitter. (Laughter  from all.)  “And by the way, John’s got a new flat, the git threw ‘em out.”
“Bethnal Green! They are going to Bethnal Green Station, the immigration services office is nearby and John’s GPS signal is in that direction.”
“He punched you, you buckled over, he grabbed your hair and pulled your head back and said something to you that I could not hear!”  I was furious all over again.
I stepped back from the door and waved him in, saying “well, we’ve made quite a hash of things already so we may as well keep going,” and trying on a slight smile. Enough to test the waters without setting off yet another explosion of his infamous temper. If he weren’t so small and boyish looking, I’m not sure he would have any friends at all, but people tend to forgive him easily. He usually does not scare them even when they should be scared.
I wanted to track him down and take him away. Away from London, from all the intrigue, and to tell Mycroft to fall down a sewer and stay there til he rotted. I was perfectly aware that this was a set up. Mycroft no doubt chose the most provocative of the hundreds of shots he likely had of John at the pub and passed it on to the tabloids. (Who knows, I would not put it past him to have hired the girl to get John stirred up.) With all the time spent drinking in rowdy pubs, Mycroft knew it would only be matter of time before John’s strong sexual responses put him in a compromising position, at least for a moment, and he made sure I saw it.
As they were wrapping up a dart game one night, Will remarked on John’s skill  (or, being a “lucky bastard,” as Will put it) and the talk turned to skill of another sort, with firearms. The conversation turned into a veritable festival of bragging about unlikely feats of accuracy and skill, and I could see John joining in with some real gusto. He always did like his gun and being a natural crack shot, he knew his weaponry. That was how the assignation was made to go to a clandestine shooting range somewhere on the outskirts of an industrial park to do some target practice. I slipped out and returned to the flat, waiting for John to make his slightly inebriated way home to see if I could tell how all of this was affecting him.
“Just shut it, Sherlock! Shut it and stay out of it if youʼve got nothing useful to add. I know what these guys are like, and yeah, as a matter of fact my brilliant plan is to go and have a pint and play some darts. And you know what? Itʼs the best way to get a foot in the door, it really is. So unless youʼve got a better idea... no, you know what? Even if youʼve got a better idea, ESPECIALLY if youʼve got a better idea - I donʼt want to hear it. Iʼll see you back at home.” He nodded to Lestrade as he briskly got up to leave. “Greg - thanks. Iʼll keep you updated.”
“There’s rumors about a couple of the men even joining up with alt-right groups, thinking we all need to get tougher on crime, as they see it. What they really don’t want to see are black and brown people getting fed up and demanding their rights. Mind you, not much cop in anyone busting things up or burning the town down, but someone like Owen isn’t thinking about that. They just want whites to stay on top. And I’ve got no use for that, either.”
And so he got back on his feet and finally came home. By the time a month had passed, he was down to two physical therapy sessions a week and was regaining the strength in his right arm. We slept with a small lamp lit in the room, something new that helped him orient himself in the night so he did not awaken in the darkness hearing the ticking of the timer on the bomb.  He wrote in his blog and his readership expanded exponentially now that the story was out about the brave veteran who had thwarted an attempted terrorist bombing. Well, three terrorist bombings to be exact. Of the other two bombs, one had been defused (in the law offices) and the other had detonated but with no loss of life. He gave his reports to Mycroft and to the Commissioner, who was initiating an investigation into alt-right influences at the Yard. MacDougal was likely to see a demotion (if not worse) based on his actions.
Things are heating up for our boys and for the case. Warning for a sexually confusing/abusive incident.
“Come John, if we take this to the shower we can accomplish two things at once. Unless of course you want to eat first.”
“I’ve notified Mycroft. He will put surveillance in place at the warehouse.”  I paused, considering. “You know you can get out of this at any time, John. If there is any hint that their suspicions are aroused or if you simply want to leave…”
I waited until the men went into a hanger for the rest of the business of the day. I would have to ensure that Mycroft had this place surveilled. Whatever they were planning, it would behoove the government to have definitive evidence to corroborate John’s information.  I got on the bike and headed back to town, feeling a bit bereft and disloyal, knowing John remained behind in that warehouse hanger in the company of men who would not hesitate to do lethal damage if they knew his mission. I tried to focus on the speed of the road going by under my feet but nothing could remove the sense of dread at leaving him behind.
“I’ve heard mention of a bloke named Jack, but I don’t know much about him,” was John’s response. Mycroft explained what I had already learned through my own research, that Davies was an ex-military man and likely the organizer for the group of toughs at the Black Dog’s Bone. John nodded, looking thoughtful. “It does seem that his name comes up in reference to making any plans. They mentioned that he will be at the shooting range this weekend.”
Mycroft was right, although I would not be telling him that any time soon. This group did bear watching.
“I got a text from Jack while you were out. I’m to meet up with him for a drive out to the warehouse for a meeting today.”
If I were not already in a panic I may have admired Lestrade’s skill in maneuvering through the traffic at high speed. Between Sally’s reports and Mycroft’s people, no doubt the bomb squad was assembling at both addresses. As we pulled up, lights were flashing outside the tube station and people were pouring out, already in the process of evacuation. Further down, more lights, and people being evicted from an office building. That would be the immigration offices.
“Ok, Sherlock, Iʼm the second person this hour to tell you to just shut it. It is blatantly obvious that youʼre worried. Look, I know what John means to you, itʼs got to be a bit tough to see him walking into this one. But he wants to be useful! Think of it: heʼs been out of the service for a while now, doing locum work and being your assistant. So stop sulking and support him in this one, ok?”
As I ran, Lestrade and Donovan followed without question. I came to a dark brick building, sides encrusted with graffiti, in the dark shadow of the overhead tracks. John had to be inside, but where? I zeroed in on his signal as near as I was able and threw myself at the black, rusted metal door. It gave with a  screech and I activated the light on my mobile. Boxes and indeterminate pieces of junk were scattered about. Donovan pulled out a torch and shone it around.
The relief came when he showed up early the next morning. Still angry. Stubborn. But present and wanting to “hash things out,” as he put it although I’m not sure even he knew what that meant or how to go about it. His sister likely pushed him into it. God bless Harry.
So I was still asleep when Mycroft’s text came though shortly after noon.  I sat up, reaching for my phone, realizing that John had long since arisen and gone about whatever his business for the morning happened to be. I opened the phone to find:
“The two are not mutually exclusive Mycroft, so let’s start with the venting. You sent that woman to harass John at the pub. Did you tell her that sexual assault was a permissible part of the game plan?! Is it gratifying to you, watching your video of that particular incident?”
He nodded and opened his eyes, tearful now, and I could see all the fear and hurt of the last days in his face. He reached for me and I leaned in.
“Alright. I will do it for you but I don’t like it. And do not expect me to simply disappear when you are out there with them. The situation is too volatile and unpredictable. I must insist on being present, even on the periphery. You know you have a tendency to getting in over your head."
Alright, then. We were getting somewhere. I prodded a bit more. I knew he was not done with his shouting yet.
As I flopped onto the sofa I considered my next objection. I injected a note of sincerity into my voice.
I ignored him. “Mycroft. Why are you doing this. You know damn well that I need to be a part of this, that it will do no good to try to separate us.” My voice was rising steadily. Mycroft, the puppet master, moving us about like pieces on a chess board. “Taking him away from 221B will only leave him more isolated and at greater risk, and furthermore…”
“There was talk of some guns coming in at Liverpool. I’ll be going along to take a look at the shipment.”
“Got a bit banged up? Is that what they are calling it these days when an officer of the law beats a civilian who has his hands cuffed behind his back, Lestrade? How genteel!”
He glanced at the headline of the article: The Squad: far right extremist group said to be gaining popularity with some ex-military.
“Sally? Could you c’mere a moment?” She appeared and Lestrade gestured her to a chair, closing his door. Interesting.
Once his initial moment of outrage passed, John took a deep breath and feigned disappointment. “So wait, you’re telling me she wasn’t just overcome by my massive and irresistible sex appeal? Is that really what you are saying? Because I’ve had a long day and I’m not sure I can take it, being crushed yet again today.”
The next day dawned with a dismal grey light and the sound of rain. I had slept lightly and when I opened my eyes, John was snoring quietly. We had fallen asleep fully dressed, and he smelled of blood and sweat. I was wearing my homeless outfit and smelled even worse. Suddenly a wave of longing for Baker Street washed over me, of wishing we could go home and make tea and watch telly while waiting for Mrs. Hudson to bring up some scones. Sentiment. As always, so incredibly useless. Particularly while we were suspended in this damp limbo of a room and John was immersed in a labyrinth of lies and malice, a place where violent imaginings were coalescing into real world plans designed to bring needless destruction. He stirred and I worked my arm out from under him and flexed my hand to bring back some circulation.
I gently stretched out beside him on the narrow bed. He burrowed into my shoulder, adjusting his position to accommodate his sore spots. I stretched an arm over him, checking for other sore spots, ribs, back, hips…
“Yes. Chief Superintendent MacDougal. His motives at this point are unclear beyond his ambition to right the scales of justice by getting back at John Watson.”
I had been up most of the night, long after John had drifted into a satiated sleep. He had been aggressive and demanding in bed, fueled no doubt at least in part by his anxiety about what was to come. He was endlessly attentive and inventive as a lover (due no doubt to years of practice).  Whatever else I thought about his seemingly endless stream of lovers before me, I did derive some benefit from his level of experience. I could not imagine anyone ever making me feel what he did. As he slept I ghosted my fingertips over his shoulders, his down his back, over the curve of his butt, admiring his compact form. He was made for me, as I told him repeatedly. He had the good sense not to argue with something so obvious.
“Ahem, yes, well then…” he mumbled, ’I’ll see you in bed, then,” and headed off, his face ruddy and his eyes pleased. I quickly put away the items from my kitchen lab that needed to be protected, and headed to the bedroom. I forgot the tea - but then, he forgot to hold that against me.
He got there first. He was sitting on a bench at the end of the pier, leaning forward, elbows on his knees looking down at the water. I approached cautiously, trying to gage his state of mind, trying to figure out just how much damage needed to be undone.
“Ahem… Look… Sherlock. I know I am a right arsehole when I get a head of steam up. I did not want things to go the way they did last night.”
It was late afternoon when I returned to Baker Street. I set my mind to the task of hacking MacDougal’s official email account, something long overdue. I found numerous exchanges with the Commissioner about the Squad, including MacDougal’s initial suggestion that John would make a good candidate to infiltrate - “in spite of being a medical doctor, he is a bit of a ruffian. But he’s a former soldier, he’s bright, and not one to back down from a fight,” he said. (All of that true, well done MacDougal.)
He startled, and then gave a clear sigh of relief. “You wanker! You scared me half to death.” He smiled (while still looking grim, that tight, thin-lipped grimace that tells me when he is barely tolerating a situation).
As I approached 221B I noted the knocker had been straightened, which could only mean one thing.  Mycroft. I sighed and entered. He looked up from where he was seated (in MY chair, of course) and nodded a greeting.
“Not my pawn? Perhaps, but apparently you believe he is yours. Did it occur to you at any point that John might welcome a chance to see some action again, for Queen and Country?”
“Stop it, John. Don’t waste our time. We’re both crap partners, if you want the truth, so let’s just agree that we were made for each other. But why all the flirting last night, you knew exactly what you were doing.” I thought for a moment. Added, “This is about Mycroft, isn’t it. His offer. Wanting you to work for him on an issue of ‘national importance’ as he put it. My answer is still no.”
“You are now going to get ready for bed and go lie down at which point your tea will be cool enough to drink and I will bring it to you.”
As we spent the time together one cold and sunny afternoon, I contemplated all that had occurred over the last several weeks. I sat back in my chair, thinking hard, while John had made tea.  He was now seated on the rug in front of the hearth, nursing a small flame that he had started with kindling. I went to join him, putting two small logs within reach, glad that he allowed me to help.
“Now, John, you have my admiration. You have had for a long time but perhaps you did not realize how much I rely on your strength and your own inner compass to keep me upright.”
He was already far enough gone that he merely groaned, this time with pleasure as I continued to work on him with hands and tongue. At last he gasped, “shower, yeah… sounds good,” and I had his vest and jeans off before he got up to cross the room. My clothes were on the floor next as we finally met under the warm flow of water, blissful, skin on skin, washing away all the dregs of the previous day and night. We know each other’s bodies well, know when to ease up and when to press harder. His was a natural talent for sex, operating on instinct and a fierce appetite. As for me, I devoted the same attention and study to pleasuring him as I do to any other vital experiment, trying different techniques and noting his response, adjusting pressure and speed according to whether I wished him to come quickly or in a prolonged and drawn-out shudder. Today was quick and intense, and when we finished we were both spent, but very pleasantly so. I felt restored to myself for the first time in days in that grubby little bathroom, wrapping a towel around my talented lover and rubbing the tension from his shoulders.
“At worst, gun running, explosives...” Lestrade was saying as I opened the door. He and John looked up, John with a priceless grimace that was part annoyance and part long-suffering tolerance. Followed by a fleeting smirk, his sure give-away that he was not really angry. Ah, the many complexities of John Watsonʼs expressions. He was always flattered as well as annoyed by my unasked-for intrusions.
“Thank you for that brilliant summation, doctor! Very impressive!” I was still angry, done with his tendency to make jokes and deny the pain of it. As he so often did. If he thought he could placate me to avoid dealing with what he had been through, what we both had been through, he was much mistaken. But then he closed his eyes, and turned his head away and I could see every line on his weathered face deepen in despair.
“Mycroft, given that Sherlock and I are not actually legally married I don’t know how we are going to be able to get divorced. And then there would be the whole question of who gets custody of Mrs. Hudson, we could be in court forever.”
“Sherlock, I do apologize. The agent’s rude behavior was uncalled for and she has been reprimanded. She was instructed to get a compromising shot and got carried away. Please extend my apologies to the good doctor.”
I chuckled. “Actually I had a front row seat. Surely you don’t think I would let you loose on your own out there. Nice shooting by the way. The lads were quite impressed.”
The days passed. He had his surgery, slept most of the time for the 36 hours following. I monitored his progress from the reclining chair at his bedside, instantly awake when he awoke, when staff entered to take his vital signs, when he needed help walking to the bathroom. Friends came by, Mrs. Hudson bringing biscuits and flowers and fussing over him in her own inimitable way. Lestrade teased him about his appearance and let him know he could take the time he needed to give his complete report. John did not talk of what had happened between the time he and I last spoke and Owen outed him to the gang. I did not push him.
“No need to guess, it is obvious that you had three pints, played darts, and endured approximately three hours of particularly vile homophobic slurs while pretending to laugh at racist jokes and discussions of conspiracy theories, all the while acting as if you, like them, were fed up with the majority of this administration’s policies and ready to do something about it.  So did you make some new friends tonight, John?”
I left the Yard feeling in no way reassured. The Diogenes Club would need to be my next stop, and I flagged a cab.
I had not despaired of extricating John from this unacceptable risk. But the more I centered myself in the plan, the better to control the outcome. I leaned across the desk and gave the DI my full attention.
John laughed. “Yeah, I know. But the truth is you wouldn't miss it for the world, you tosser! No, I wouldn't expect you to bow out of something like this. Not just when it's getting exciting.” He moved in closer, grabbing my shoulders and turning me to face him. “I know you're not going to skip out on the fun, we both know how you love the drama!” Affectionate. Teasing.
“JOHN?”  I started down the stairs and saw a shape in the darkness downstairs, someone seated on the ground in front of a metal support column, a white face, movement. I could smell him. John. Donovan shone her light at the figure and there he was, hands tied in back of the metal pillar, duct tape over his mouth. He was shaking his head ‘no’ frantically, trying to mouth the words, sweating with panic, but John does not panic, I have seen him face death with aplomb, what was he trying to say as we crossed the distance toward him…
A cheer went up from the group which I could hear clearly from my hiding place. John’s marksmanship had made an impression and I noted with some amusement that I felt pleased and proud of my soldier in spite of the nature of the outing. Will pounded John on the back and even Jack was smiling. They set up for another round at a greater distance and gave John an automatic rifle. Again John hit the mark nearly every time and again was congratulated. The others spread out a bit and lined up for target practice. John said something to Jack, who nodded, and John stepped forward to observe the others shooting. He walked along the line, making comments to a couple of men along the way, clearly correcting their stance and posture. Will and Jack looked on, seeming pleased. Apparently John had passed the audition.
His brow furrowed at that. “Nope, staying right here. Some butterfly bandaids will work fine after I’m done with this ice.” He grimaced, looking at the towel which now showed blood, and put the ice back on his face.
“There is an excellent possibility that it was he who tipped off Davies a while back,” I said while simultaneously texting John. “We have no time to lose in getting John out of there.”
Mycroft looked sour. He sighed, “I’m afraid whatever plans have been made were not made at this meeting place. It is likely that only one or two of Davies’ confederates know of the actual target. We need to find out, and hopefully soon. We do know there are plans for at least two bombs, with materials for more.”  He looked thoughtful. “John has been appointed as the armed guard for their meetings as well as running shooting drills for the men. I think it safe to assume his presence will be required at whatever event they have in the works. But whether he will have any advance knowledge of the timing and the target - that is doubtful. And we need to have compelling evidence of their plans before we lower the boom. We don't know where their higher-level planning meetings are taking place. As yet none of our surveillance feeds have captured any specific discussion of their intent to commit violence. They talk about combat training and available supplies, but we need an air-tight case before bringing them to justice. A conspiracy charge will be much more compelling to the Crown than a mere illegal arms charge.”
One of the staff said, “We’ll give you a few minutes,” and they drifted over to the desk to confer but clearly were listening closely to us. Mycroft said he would go let Lestrade know what was happening, and then it was just John and myself. I leaned over and gingerly kissed his forehead, not sure where it was safe to touch without jostling him.
John was smiling. Sally shook my hand and thanked me, and John stood to embrace her. When she stepped back her eyes were misty, and she exclaimed,  “Okay, enough of that rubbish. When are you two wankers going to get married? It really is long overdue, y’know, and I’ve got a pool going back at the office so if you could arrange it for this January it would really help my vacation fund, I’m just saying…”
“How did you want it to go, John? We both have our jealous snits, that is nothing new. What was so different last night? You drank too much, danced too much with someone other than myself, I objected. It happens.”
John’s expression said it all: he had not noticed me in the pub, and now his face reflected a struggle to reconcile his contradictory feelings about the humiliation of being watched without noticing it, along with some gratification at the thought. Oh, John. Did my actions not tell you everything?
John looked up at me, looked down at the paper, and paled. Clearly he had not been aware of the publicity. He stuttered for a moment, not having prepared for this particular possibility. His response was accidentally genuine.
“John, I… I can’t… I don’t… even know what happened to you. I lost sight of you and now. This.” I knew I was not making sense. It was the best I could do under the circumstances.  I reached out and felt the stubble on his chin. It was scratchy.
Friday afternoon I received a brief text; they would be at the pub later on. I pulled on the hoodie, jeans, and horned rimmed glasses that comprised my uni student outfit and slicked back my hair. That, along with a carefully cultivated slouch was all I needed to again spend the evening observing from behind my laptop in the corner of the Black Dog’s Bone. Will, John, and couple others of their cadre came swaggering in, clearly inebriated, and ordering whisky and beer. They commandeered the area in front of the dart board and proceeded to toast each other for “a job well done.”  The conversation quickly deteriorated in quality, with the men discussing women in a manner that I will not deign to reproduce here. John held back, this not being his characteristic mode of engagement regarding the fairer sex, but the others seemed accustomed to his reticence. Suffice to say that the atmosphere was becoming a bit rowdy, so what came next was really no surprise.
He brought over two steaming cups and sat facing me. I leaned forward and reached over, cupping the side of his face with my hand. He closed his eyes and leaned into it.
As for me, forgiveness never even entered the picture, that being something that was totally unnecessary. John was essential to my life, to my being, and so I did not ever even think in those terms. Whatever his rages, I weather them and gladly to have him stay with me. I am, after all, really not that sensitive at heart. I want what I want.
“If you’d known, you would have left,” Sherlock said slowly, closing the box. “You would have. They started changing the very first day. Yours...they only started changing now.” He turned away, setting the box on his chair.
“No, you’re not.” Greg sighed, and leaned forward, rubbing his temples. “Look, Mycroft. Whatever this is...just come out and say it, won’t you? I’m getting damn tired of dancing around the subject, and wondering what we are to each other. I know you’ve seen your own wings changing, and I’m sure that with your job you know a lot of people with silver hair, but I only know one person with red hair.” He propped his elbows on his knees, eyes fixed on Mycroft. “So. You wanna get coffee or something? Might make for a better date than being interrogated over my relationship with Molly Hooper.”
“They are,” Mycroft replied. “But that does not mean the choices and pheromones our bodies change in reaction to are without merit. I...do not date. If this is to be something, it must be concrete, and committed.”
“I’m not going to leave you again.” Sherlock examined his face and then leaned down. “I promise you, John,” he murmured, soft lips brushing just against John’s chapped ones. “I will not leave.” John’s eyes widened slightly, and then he shut them as Sherlock pressed their foreheads together for a long moment, cupping his face. “Do you understand?” Sherlock asked quietly after he pulled away.
Mycroft hesitated, and shuffled his wings a bit, showing the drips of silver slowly making their way up his feathers. “It can hardly be anything else.”
Taking a step away, Mycroft tugged Greg with him, and across the hall. “He is deleting John,” he said quietly. “Replacing him with song.”
“Yes, well. I've given him case, and I expect he may get into some trouble over it.” Mycroft handed Greg a thin file.
Greg sighed, and took Mycroft’s hand, leading him over to the edge of the bed, and sitting down. He tugged Mycroft to stand between his knees, looking up at him. “I love you, My. And you know I love Sherlock. But do you honestly think that he’s going to be able to start over this time? John was…. he was something different for Sherlock. ”
“I’ve given up calling the little kidnappings you orchestrate anything different.” Greg gave a little shrug. “I enjoy them too much for them to be anything different. What do you think about it?”
Greg smiled, relieved as he curved his own, showing off his inner feathers and the distinctly red tones of the new growth. “Thank god,” he said quietly. “Thought you’d be one of those pragmatic wankers and wouldn’t admit this meant we were matched. That wing colors are just all a crazy evolutionary development.”
“You’ve been meeting with her regularly. At her flat. You brought her lunch, just recently, and you both went out to a restaurant.”
“Yes. Installed in a motel, and still hoping you’ll take him back, if I’m not mistaken.” Mycroft straightened up, and stood, closing the lid over the piano keys. “Will you?”
“Good day, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock walked out, leaving the elderly woman looking after him, clutching her cardigan together in surprise.
He turned, only to stop as Sherlock’s wings brushed against him, and Sherlock touched his shoulder again. “John. Wait.”
“Wait, Sherlock! Why don’t you-” Greg was cut off with the slam of the front door, and he sighed, taking his seat again, listening as Mycroft started to play once more. After a long moment, he got up, taking up his mug of tea, and going into the library, leaning against the door frame. “Will he be all right?” he asked quietly.
Greg sighed, and reached into his coat, pulling out a notebook. “This is all I have. Enjoy. Molly will let you in to see the body and a few other bits you might enjoy.”
“Ah. Mrs. Hudson. I suggest you go away for a few days,” Sherlock said, pausing at the curious voice. “There will be movers in.”
“I know,” John said, closing his eyes, stepping forward and pulling his wings around them. “I wouldn’t want it to.”
Mycroft waited a moment, and then there was a sudden click, and the tone of an empty line came through the receiver. He sighed, and hung up the phone. “Gregory? What is it?”
“You don't get to touch me,” Sherlock said, voice icy, cracking slightly. “Never again will you touch me.”
Mycroft shifted, sitting properly at his desk once more. “I can only assume you were going to say I am a piece of work, and I assure you I am. As well as icy, cold, arctic, heartless, and whatever you wish to throw at me. By all means, Doctor Watson, throw the entire book. But understand this. First, I will do whatever is necessary to protect my brother, and that does include protecting him from you. Second, you are at fault for what has occurred here. This is your fault and you did quite enjoy yourself, so do not continue with petty excuses, and empty apologies. Deep down, you are relieved at being free, even if guilt drives you to grovel.” Mycroft held up a hand as Greg slipped into the office, shifting anxiously at the door. “And finally, Sherlock will not ever let you back in. Give up. Find somewhere that you can be of use, and go there. If you wish, I will assist you. I think we can both agree that it would be best if you were no longer in London. You know how to contact me.”
“She’s fine I suppose. Unless Sherlock goes and causes trouble for her, I just sent him that way to see the body.” Greg shrugged. “Why?”
John gave a small nod. “Yeah,” he said, and then cleared his throat. “Yeah. I...ah. Still gonna take that walk.”
Mycroft scowled, preening his feathers in a stony silence as he listened to a conference call. He paused, pressing a button. “Excuse me, Ambassador, but that is not what we agreed on, nor will it be done. Do you understand me? If you'd like to continue in that line of thought, I'll simply sort it out myself. Is that what you wish?” There was a second of silver toned silence, and then a hurried apology. Mycroft gave a satisfied look, and then pressed the button again, going back to his wings.
John steadied him, gentling the kiss with only a hand to Sherlock’s chest. “Not going anywhere,” he murmured. “Can do this now. Relax.”
“Yet you seem to assume I do,” Sherlock replied, opening the box and spreading the cards out. “So brother mine, bring me a worthwhile case or get out of my hair.” He narrowed his eyes, picking up a card. “Go fish.”
It was a moment before Mycroft could nod in agreement, and Greg smiled as he did. “Good,” he said, shifting over to the seat next to Mycroft. “And now that I’ve left you speechless, I’m going to go a bit further. Be my boyfriend?” he asked, slipping his hand onto Mycroft’s thigh and giving it a squeeze. “Let’s do this properly. God knows we’ve known each other long enough.”
He had abandoned Sherlock after Mary's death leaving nothing but an ominous hateful letter. The letter contents were too painful to even recount. All he knew was after reading it he had deleted it from his mind and stopped his daily texts to John. He tossed the soiled rag into the trash before searching the couch cushions for his phone. He found it buried underneath the middle cushion. He withdrew it and clicked it on, slightly disappointed to see no calls or texts for John. He groaned at the missed calls from Lestrade. Reluctantly he called back. The DI picked up after three rings.
Sherlock mindlessly dragged his nails across the concrete of the roof. "You're dead. You're not here. This is just the drugs. The overdose. It's my brain trying to stop me."
Sherlock hung up the phone and reached with shaky hands for his kit that was left on the coffee table from the night before. His breathing was picking up and he couldn't seem to control it. With unsteady hands, he prepped the solution before getting high once again. He leaned onto the armrest and closed his eyes as he became numb once again.
"I was angry. I was angry at you because I love you and I knew it was wrong. I blamed you for Mary because I couldn't face the fact that I love you far more than I loved her. Being angry at you was easier than facing the fact my marriage was a lie." John was ranting letting his tears gather on the collar of his jumper.
John tightened his grip on the bottle. "That's not an excuse, Sherlock. I should've been there for you, you were hurting too."
"I've been busy." He cringed at how fake the lie sounded. "I will not be attending Mary's service out of respect for Doctor Watson. He has specifically requested that I refrain from contacting him and his daughter."
Mycroft’s eyebrows rose in shock. “Sherlock, I think that we’re the ones who are sorry. I should have paid closer attention." Mycroft frowned for a moment, "Sherlock, what have you done to your hand?"
"You should. She wants you. Do you know how fussy she gets when she doesn't have her stuffed bee? She recognizes pictures of you and gets excited when we pass Baker Street. You've probably spent more time with her then I have. You're her other parent, not Mary. Now hold your daughter before she starts crying." John stepped forward pressing the baby against Sherlock's chest so he had no choice but to hold her.
John reached out and grabbed his shoulder while clutching Rosie against him with his other hand. "With me. You're coming home with me. You need someone to look after you." John explained.
"I'll be back. I'm not finished with this conversation." John stomped from the room leaving Sherlock panting over the side of the bed.
"I no longer have anything here. It's best to move on." Sherlock turned away from John hoping to end the conversation.
John smiled as he placed Rosie into her playpen. The baby immediately giggled with delight when she spotted her stuffed bee.
By the time he had purchased the drugs, it was four-thirty. He was high five minutes later and sitting on Bart's roof by five. He hummed as he allowed his feet to dangle off the edge. The wind felt amazing and it felt like the first breath of air in over two months. The sun was starting to rise, covering the city in an orange and pink haze. He felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He withdrew it to see a message from Greg.
"I uh- Mary's funeral, it's tomorrow. Are you coming? No one's heard from you in a month." It was clear how uncomfortable Greg was.
Sherlock went to look at her but the space beside him was empty. He stood using the box to balance himself. He felt dizzy and out of place. He pushed himself back up onto the ledge and stared beneath him. Molly was still standing there with large tears streaming down her face. In addition to that, he could see a police cruiser on the street. The doors of the cruiser flew open and a panicked Greg Lestrade was running across the lot. He looked up and his panic increased immediately. He watched the D.I. reach into his pocket and withdraw his phone. Sherlock’s phone vibrated from beside him. He snatched it and answered it with a quick swipe.
Mary laughed in her funny little way that always made John smile even when Sherlock pissed him off. "You've never known or seen John or Rosie without you. You have no idea how much they need you."
He hung up without saying goodbye. He threw his legs over the couch and stood, swaying slightly. He made his way to the bathroom where he flicked on the light. He cringed at his own appearance. His face was pale and gaunt. His eyes were bloodshot with black rings around them. He had also allowed his beard to grow in nearly completely. If anyone looked at him they would immediately know that he was an addict.
He bought several packs and a new lighter before he began his trek back to his flat. Loneliness was what he needed, what he deserved. He ignored the black car following him back to his flat. He assumed it was Mycroft making sure he wasn't getting anyone else killed.
The phone ringing is what woke him. He glanced at the clock noting that the time was two in the afternoon. He quickly answered it and held it weakly to his ear.
"I love you, too." John could barely hear it. It was enough however for John to lean further forward and press his lips to Sherlock's, who leaned slightly into it. John pulled back with a smirk.
Sherlock frowned and placed the glass onto the nightstand. "I planned on leaving London." He admitted coldly. "I apologize. I insisted that Lestrade not contact you. Sorry, he wasted your time."
John ushered Sherlock to the kitchen table and forced him into a chair. He pulled the coat from him and let it hang off the back of the chair. John cringed at the bandage on his hand and wrist. It was caked in blood and falling off at the fingers. He stood from the table to retrieve his kit from the bathroom before returning.
“Sherlock, please don’t. You’re high, you aren’t thinking straight. Just stop.” Lestrade pleaded into the phone hoping to buy enough time.
Sherlock didn't reply as he tiredly stared down at Rosie. John moved to prep a bottle in the kitchen but glanced at the other two occasionally.
Sherlock sighed, accidentally clenching his hand into a fist instinctively. "I was high and I punched the mirror.”
"You won't find anything. Our association has come to an end, goodbye. -SH" Sherlock leaned onto his hands as he continued to watch the busy city streets below.
“It’s all too much. The emotions and pain. The loss. I just want it to stop." Sherlock choked on a sob, "I've done nothing but cause people I love pain and heartbreak."
John scoffed but it sounded more like a breathless laugh. "Yes! If you do this I swear to God I'll follow you, because I need you. Hell, Rosie needs you, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and god forbid your brother needs you!"
John cleared his throat as he pulled back the covers of the bed. "I haven't slept in here since- you know."
It was Janine, Mary, and John outside the chapel. Sherlock could see his own hat peak from below the frame. The fold was careful to ensure that it wasn't noticeable. He jumped at the hand on his shoulder.
John laughed bitterly, "Sherlock, you don't need to be sorry for that. I forgave you for that so long ago. Now come let's get to sleep before Rosie wakes up." John stood from the bed and continued pulling back the blankets before he slid himself in between them.
"I wish I would've realized how much she missed you sooner. It would've saved me a lot of sleepless nights." John smiled but it didn't quite reach his eyes.
Sherlock's grip tightened on John's waist. The pain of finally hearing it was breaking him down. "I loved her too." He gasped out as he choked on a sob.
“What.” He snapped into the phone. “Are you here to arrest me for the drugs and public intoxication? Because as you can see there is really no point.”
“When have I ever done something without thinking it through. This is the right choice.” Sherlock assured him.
Lestrade grew more concerned with each passing minute he couldn't see John or Sherlock. He held baby Rosie close to his chest, comforted by her random babble. He was pleased when he saw John leading Sherlock out of the front door. Lestrade was startled by the detective's stressed appearance. Sherlock wasn't looking at anyone, deciding the concrete was more interesting
The harsh light pelted his eyelids as he blinked awake. He opened his eyes to stare at the sitting room ceiling. He sat up and realized he had been laying on the floor and cringed at the smell of stale vomit from beside him. He grabbed the empty syringe that was discarded on the floor from the night before.
He didn't take a cab home. He walked, appreciating the cold air against his feverish skin. By the time he made it back to Baker Street, it was noon. He was startled by Lestrade's police cruiser parked out front along with two others. He rushed into the home and up the stairs in seconds. He burst into the flat to find the place turned upside down and police picking apart everything.
The door slowly creaked open and John stepped in. John observed the scene before him. Sherlock snuggled into bed, the sheets strung around. His former friend looked ill and exhausted.
Once he took the dive everything would be okay. John would no longer worry about his presence and Mycroft wouldn't need to monitor him constantly. He was only doing what he should've done the last time he was on this roof. He was foolish to think he was worth anything. He hadn't even realized he had started to cry until he felt that his shirt collar was wet. The phone beside him vibrated again.
"That's it? You're just going to pack up and leave everything?" John stepped closer to the bed. "Being a coward are we?"
An addict for what? He wasn't sure. He'd dabbled with all kinds of drugs in the last 25 years; marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and many others he had come across at University. However, it was clear his drug of choice had always been John Watson. This was merely the withdrawal.
Sherlock circled around the bed and did the same. He turned so he was facing away from John towards the window. Sherlock felt at ease being surrounded by the smells of Watson's. He sniffed slowly, letting the smell of John (tea and rubbing alcohol), Mary (flowers and biscuits), and Rosie (baby powder and powdered milk) surrounded him. He jumped when a strong arm snuck around his torso. He turned to face John in confusion. As he looked into John's eyes all he saw was pure admiration and love. Sherlock swallowed the lump in his throat and pulled a hand out from under the covers to rest on John's cheek.
Sherlock followed John to his closed bedroom door. He was uncomfortable at the prospect of being invited to John and Mary's marriage bed. John smiled reassuringly as he turned the knob and flung the door open. The room was dusty with disuse. Sherlock examined it carefully, taking in every little detail. The muddy footprints and various stains were created by an infant on the carpet. The walls were a pale blue with cobwebs hanging in the corners. Mary's vanity stayed untouched and dirty from her powders and creams. Mary's bedside table was filled with books, a lamp, and her reading glasses. John's however was bare except for two things, a picture of him and Sherlock and another lamp.
Damnit. Well, I told John I would do it for his sake, so I supposed I should get dressed… and then another text came through:
As John strode away, Lestrade had the look of a man who wished heʼd left early on this particular day. “Sherlock... look. I know this is a bit out of the ordinary for you...”
Will: “Look, I think he’s promising… I like the way he thinks. I get the feeling he’s not happy just sitting around watching the nation turn to shit. I’m bringing him in for a bit of shooting so we can see what he can do.”
“John.” I learned in to him at the stove. He had to look up. “Do. Not. Trust. Anyone. Particularly that lot. Other than Lestrade, there will be no one who you can rely on to ‘have your back.’ Don’t expect it and don’t count on it.”
I paused, and turned to face him directly as we sat there with the flames growing and beginning to send off their warmth.
She rolled her eyes and responded, “Well mate I guess you’re stuck with me. You’re a little guy but if you’re not steady when we get you up, you’re gonna need the two of us, I mean, have you looked at Freak? I think he’s lost a couple stone worrying over you, nope I think it will take two of us to get you over that trip wire and out of here…”
“Oh I think I can come up with something,” he grinned. “Hate to see that beautiful bum of yours in that ratty underwear again.”
Mycroft had the gall to chuckle. “So. You told him to refuse my request. And how did that go over, Sherlock? I have to admit I would have enjoyed being there to watch. What exactly did he tell you I was asking of him?”
When I arrived at the Yard, Lestrade hunched over his computer, immersed in the bureaucratic trivia of his job. As I took a seat in front of his desk, he rose without a word to me and stuck his head out his office door.
I took a deep breath and pushed open the doors, and heard John’s voice, weak but coherent, asking about the surgical procedure. I walked up slowly and the doctors looked up as I came around to the side of the gurney, seeing his pale face with the evidence of the injuries of the last few days, his right arm encased in a bundle of padding. He stopped in mid sentence and fixed on my face, reaching out with his left arm, dragging the IV line across the blanket as he did, reaching for me. I froze. The relief was so powerful that I simply blinked and stared for a few moments.
“This is going to sound ridiculous but y’know I wondered, could I do it again. Could I be the man I was there, not just the jumping into danger part, but taking command, not just following your lead.  There are things I still miss…”
Sally entered, greeting us with “Holmes, John, how are you two?” She smiled. “Playing nice with each other?” I would have bristled but John just laughed.
The ringing in my head was slowly subsiding. We’d escaped the worst of it, no large debris landed on us but John was not conscious and I felt his neck, thank God finding a pulse there. He coughed weakly, his chest in a spasm where he lay in the dust. Sally had pushed herself to her knees and was shouting for Lestrade and the medics, but her voice sounded far away. I felt John’s shoulders, neck, no obvious (new) damage but the injured arm was at an awkward angle (his right, thank goodness, at least he would have the use of his dominant hand.) He barely stirred as I shouted his name. My own voice sounded far away. I gently brushed dust and grit off his eyes, his nose, his mouth. He was breathing but his skin was grey and his lips bluish. Shock.
Jack: “So you say he did a couple tours in Afghanistan?  How much do we really know about his loyalties? Anyway, we really don’t want to attract the attention of his posh fuck-buddy now, do we?”
“I am sure I have no idea what you are doing here, dear brother. Perhaps you would care to enlighten me.”
He looked up in amusement. “Besides, I assume the GPS you planted on Dr. Watson was not a cheap model? It should continue to function long enough for us to follow him to whatever target they have planned.”
As I watched him sleep I realized I would not be drifting off myself, and went out to retrieve my violin. The composition I was working on was giving me trouble, a particular passage that just would not flow. I did not rejoin John in bed until nearly 4am.
