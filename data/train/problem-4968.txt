"Hey Cas?"
"No, no, the tuning can't be wrong, I did it myself about ten minutes ago. Jack, pay attention to the notes, please. Play it from the top."
"She?" Castiel asks incredulously, but he isn't quite surprised by the fact that Dean probably has feelings for his car. He's a strange guy like that. He once mentioned his love for memory foam— a completely random fact that pops into Castiel's head for absolutely no reason. The way Dean had described sleeping on it, Castiel knew it would put the greatest poets to shame.
"Horrible, as always."
to understand."
"A month?” Mr. Kreschner asks, his voice laced with disbelief.
A hand on his shoulder, paired with the loud tenor of Sam's voice, draws Dean out of his thoughts, and he sucks in a deep breath, keeping his eyes pointed down as he swallows thick, giving a curt nod.
"I have to leave in a few minutes," he says.
Their eyes meet, and silently, Dean urges Castiel to lie down. He complies, and slips down onto the mattress, looking up at Dean through his thick, coy lashes, and it takes Dean every last ounce of restraint to not lean over and press his lips to those delicious, slick, plump ones on Castiel's face.
"I always come when you call." Castiel croaks out, and finally, Dean's eyes are drawn to the glassy, hazy tears brimming at Castiel's eyes.
A silence crawls between them as Castiel rubs the cloth over Dean's shoulder, down his pliant arms, and up his chest. The water pours over them, hot and soothing, and Dean sucks in a shaky breath. His head falls against Castiel's shoulder, and Castiel can tell he's trying so hard to bite back a sob.
"Yeah, you are. What, are you jealous?"
"Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to sound rude, Cas. It's just... This is hard on both of us, and I know you know that, I'll just, I'll try to be a bit softer. Yeah?" Slender fingers touch the bottom of his chin, urging him to look up, and Castiel gives in at last, unable to resist as he meets Dean's soft eyes, and they share a tender smile.
"Mhm, I guessed. And why'd you need to be, huh? Bet your pretty omega hole hasn't ever been fucked before has it?" Dean scoffed, and bit down on Castiel's nipple, eliciting a loud moan from the omega, "—do you know how much you
"I don't know. Maybe settle in, y'know, get the furniture in place, see if all my stuff's there, talk to Sam. Oh, I haven't talked to Sam this morning, I'll ring him later." Dean shrugs, and they walk into the elevator when it opens up, Castiel helping Dean in with his bags.
"Fuck baby, you're in heat? I thought our cycles were synced."
"Why don't you go ask that friend of yours? Maybe he told you wrong. 'Cause he was real firm when he told me the date last night."
And how could Castiel have refused that?
"Trust me, Blue."
— shouted out practically, as he pulled Dean down and into a fierce, passionate kiss.
” He sucks in a loud breath, “
Now it's about the touches— the stares, the grins, the blushing, the whispers— some odd sort of feeling has grown between them, one which neither young men intend to vocalise, and yet, hovers over their heads— a double-ended sword.
"I can't, Rowena. I don't remember, for god’s sake. And if I did, you think I wouldn't tell you? Especially if it meant Castiel would be healed? I said I don't, and that's the end of it."
"Yes, master, I'm leaking for you, only you—"
"Because if you weren't," Castiel cradles Dean's jaw in his hands, "-you'd be much happier about the decision you made. Rule of thumb, Dean, the happiest choice is always the hardest one. But I don't blame you. You've been through enough, and you don't need the guilt. So, go, before I kidnap you and imprison you in my one-room apartment." A wet chuckle falls past Castiel's lips, and though he expects Dean to smile at the jest, he doesn't. His eyes harden, something along the lines of guilt blooming within them, and he pulls away, his hands sliding down Castiel's arms to hook through his fingers, before Castiel pulls his hands away.
"Why do you think I'd hate you? Dean, you mean so much to m-me, h-how could I hate, how could I hate you?"
"Let me think it over."
"Die? Mom from a tumour. Dad from cancer."
, and then he had headed home alone, pulling the jacket Dean had given him over his shoulders. He'd hidden it in his bag, and he wouldn't dare wear it in school, but only where he knew Dean would never find him.
"At this hour?"
But at once, Dean is crumbling.
Dean's face had contorted. His eyes had gone pitch-black, and his seemingly harmless tongue had now erupted into a long, thick ribbed dark, moss-green tentacle which split at the tip like that of a snake.
It bothers Castiel, how helpless he sounds, and yet, he persists, standing his ground. All the while Dean mumbles his name over and over again, as if it would bestow salvation upon him.
"Sir, you might be confused. Perhaps, you need some sleep too. The door, after the young mistress' passing, the door has never been opened. The only way you could
"I mean," Dean's breath hitches in his throat as he looks up, meeting Castiel's tender eyes, and at once, he feels the weight roll off his shoulder.
"Ugh, I hate you."
"When I was in Castiel's room this afternoon, I could feel his grace flittering. It was depleting, and I could feel it at once. Whenever I, or any experienced witch for that matter, is in the presence of something equally and or, more powerful, we sense it. And I could sense Castiel's grace depleting. It was as if there was no life to it anymore. As if he was turning human. And then, after I started my spell, after I delved into the intricates of his body, I finally realised what I was looking at." Rowena pauses, allowing the brothers a moment to follow her words. Both Sam and Dean, now leaning forward, their eyes glued to Rowena and their ears perked, share a glance before Sam speaks up.
Dean didn’t tell him. Dean lied to him. Dean isn’t supposed to lie to him. Dean is his friend.
"But first," Dean started, and Castiel fisted the front of Dean's shirt, tiny, soundless sobs wracking his petite frame, "-don't you think you should be punished, Castiel? After all, look at what you've done. You've stunk up my room with your stench, rubbed your sweet, leaking ass all over my bed, and then, since your filthy omega hole couldn't get enough, you fucked yourself on your fingers on
These days, the passageways aren't as narrow anymore, and they don't seem to cave in on Dean, especially when he's walking, laughing with Miracle in his arms, running his fingers through the golden fun as Miracle continues to lick around his face. This time, the passageways light up with the sounds of '
Thick fingers brush over Castiel's forehead, and his eyes flutter shut.
three months.
Castiel shrugs and lets the words hang in the air. He glances down at the book and blows out a soft puff of air, resting his head against his hand.
"I'm hungry, baby."
"Cas..."
sounds more familiar. It just fits.
"Mhm," Castiel hums, and his eyes widen with confusion the moment Dean slips his fingers inside the hem of the sweatpants. It becomes fairly easy after that, to dip his fingers lower into the warm, inviting crevice of Castiel's ass.
"Oh," She grinned, "-lovely. That's lovely." Her eyes dimmed for a moment, and Castiel watched as her shoulders loosened, as if she were dejected, "-The house could do with some laughter."
For the first few moments, Castiel felt strange. Something wet was licking at his hole. How could it possibly feel good?
"Baby, what's wrong?"
And with that, he ends the call.
A pause, before the man from behind the wall speaks up again.  "What'd I say.” There is a slight smugness to his voice, and no matter how hard Castiel tries to hide it, he can't help the grin spreading across his face.
"Will you let me go now?"
"I bet."
This was something filthier and unholier than anything Castiel had seen before. Had Castiel been ignorant, he would have deemed the demon as Lucifer himself, but Castiel knew better.
To breathe.
He tried
"I came for a walk.” Dean admits, “-Needed to take my mind off of things."
"You gonna' suck me off, baby? Gonna' swallow me down?"
The knife in Dean's hand found its way to Castiel's skin, and Castiel would be lying if he said the first slice of his skin didn't excite him. The thrill of watching his blood stream down in a slow, crimson red trail and stain his pink nipples had his cock twitching, and part of him had been thankful Dean had left him free at his hips.
Love. Castiel has never been in love before. It’s never bothered him, not having a lover, but sometimes, when he catches his thoughts wandering, he does imagine a future filled with love. With someone to stay beside him. With someone who chooses to love him, above anything else. With someone who means everything to him, perhaps more than everything. He thinks of cold mornings and warm blankets, and sunny afternoons and lively chatter, of rainy nights and comforting arms.
A beat passes before Dean continues, a reminiscent tone to his words.
The voice belonged to the man who tied him up. Dean Winchester. 27 years old. Mechanic. Alleged serial killer. The man who was supposed to be Castiel story-of-the-month and give him his long-due break in the publishing agency. Castiel had been following him for days— to convenience stores, to gas stations, to random 7/11's, to strip clubs, to gay bars, to glory holes, to his house, to his garage, to everywhere. The stalking had not been on the job description. It was something sick and twisted inside Castiel that compelled him to do that, and yet, he blamed it on his job, saying he had no choice but to stalk Dean to get as much information as possible.
Dean nudges him away, pressing his hands to the sides of Castiel's face as he wipes his tears away with his thumb, finding himself smiling on instinct. Castiel sniffles softly
"Cas—" Dean panted, and Castiel turned around, watching as Dean held onto his knees, gasping for air, holding a hand up to assure Castiel he was alright. On pure instinct, Castiel moved to Dean's side, pressing a hand over his back to soothe him. Dean groaned, before pushing himself up, and he towered over Castiel by a few inches, which prompted Castiel to take a step back.
"I got you, baby, go on, fuck yourself on my finger."
"You came back," he states, but his voice is soft, barely a whisper.
"I don't know what's happening, Dean." Castiel croaks and his voice is low and strangled, muffled over Dean's skin. Dean wants nothing more than to push away anything and everything that has been bothering Castiel, that has been hurting him, but he doesn’t know where to begin, so he simply resorts to rubbing a hand over Castiel’s back.
"Then," Blue starts, his voice tender and endearing, "
"You mean...?"
"Oh, I see you've assumed quite easily of my attractiveness."
A beat passes between them.
He doubts the man could have heard him, especially with how soft his voice was, but his doubts dissipate the moment he hears a soft
Their eyes meet across the table, and Castiel pulls his hands away to cross them over the table. He watches from the corner of his eyes as the waitress approaches again, this time with a tray in her hand. She beams at Dean as she sets their plates down.
It's hard for Dean to express his emotions— Castiel can clearly see that in the way he clenches his fist, his jaw locking and eyes wandering meaninglessly over the table.
thing is a joke?"
Until junior year.
"What do you think you're doing, Castiel?"
Tears fall onto the pillow, one, two, three, until Castiel can’t feel his face anymore.
no, the memories, down. Dr.Mosely had been very specific with the instructions:
They have strict rules pertaining to their identities, and although the world wouldn't crumble if they did happen to stumble into each other someday since they are
"That's enough, baby, you did good, you did very good. I'm going to take care of you now, alright?" He cooed, and grazed his knuckles affectionately across Castiel's cheekbones.
Dean was good. He didn't deserve this. He didn't deserve to have himself used the way Castiel was using him. Letting Castiel stay at his home, renting out his guest room (for such a meagre rent at that), helping him with his studies, cooking for him, cleaning for him— Dean was a saint. An alpha unlike Castiel had even known. No, Dean wasn't an alpha overruled by his instincts and libido, rather he was composed, gentle, respectful— and now that Castiel thinks about it— big and broad, like he could pin Castiel down to the bed or against a wall for hours.
Claire gasped. For the moments after, her expressions remained inscrutable, and Castiel exchanged a concerned glance with Dean, who simply nodded with assurance.
Castiel glances down at his watch. It's nine-fifteen in the morning, which means they have almost an hour and a half left together. Fifteen minutes doesn't sound like an issue, and with the way Castiel's stomach rumbles, hamburgers sound like a savior.
He admonishes himself with a brief cough, trying not to stare into the pool of Castiel's eyes.
Dean laughs, tugging a frown at Castiel’s lips, before he speaks up in what Castiel deems is a horrendous English accent.
Castiel tells himself it's not an obsession— no, because he knows obsession is not something he's capable of, or even has the time for, but yes, he's invested. He's more than willing to listen to Dean ramble on about the mixtapes he made back in high school, or the story of how his parents met, or how his liking for powdered donuts developed.
Castiel wanted to claw at his own flesh, tear his skin, gouge his eyes out, rip out his hair— anything to not be where he was, anything to disappear. Had the ground opened up under him and swallowed him, he would be more glad. Maybe he could shut his eyes, and realise Dean was simply a figment of his alcohol-riddled brain's imagination, but apparently, every single thought consuming Castiel vanished the moment Dean's eyes caught his from across the floor.
"I'm wearing scent blockers. Have been for an hour now."
, the target, and not me, the power source. So even if you kill me, the spell will live on."
Castiel knew already, the words on the tip of Dean's tongue.
a boyfriend in that while."
"Then I'm happy for master!"
A pause ensues between them.
? Mr.Green, please, don't be so modest, it was very good. Trust me. I have nothing to gain from lying to you, so when I tell you it was good, you believe me."
Slick gushed through his hole, and he lifted his ass up in the air, settling himself between Dean's legs on the bed, as he eyed Dean's bulging erection. The fabric strained around it, and Castiel traced a hesitant, testing finger down the bulge. Above him, Dean let out a stuttered moan. His hands, warm and big, wrapped around the back of Castiel's head almost tenderly, but contradicting their actions when they shoved Castiel's face over Dean's crotch.
“Why not?”
Castiel knew Dean would be leaving in a month. But that was enough time to relish in the memories. Besides, they'd meet each other soon
Dean's thrusts only increased.
And with that, Mr. Kreschner clicks his cane on the ground, and walks away, leaving Castiel to himself. Castiel glances at the road, then turns away, hitching Dean's jacket closer to him on his chest as he takes a few heavy steps forward.
"I need to, buddy. This is for you, alright, so you can get better soon. I'll be around if you need anything. Now come on, let Rowena help you."
"I— I don't know. I'm sorry."
"Well, you know what they say, Cas," Deanna winked, and made her way inside the covers, peeking her head out from between Cas's thighs, "-the night is young."
"You don't need to say anything. I know, I always have known. I'm an angel, you ass, I've heard you pray."
A pause follows Dean's words and Dean watches the eggs cook.
proof enough. He's rambling now, something about house rules and music, but Castiel isn't listening to him, he's watching him, watching his eyes widen when he speaks, watching his eyebrows bounce, watching his lips twitch, watching his bow legs strut as they walk outside.
"Oh, how mannerless of me," The woman chuckled, "-I'm Mildred. I've been asked to cook here. You must be the Winchesters?"
no, he’s simply been tolerating Castiel. That’s what Dean has been doing all this time.
"It’s none of your business, Sam," Dean growls.
For a long second, Dean can’t find it in himself to answer. Should he tell Blue? It’s not like Blue would judge him. Undoubtedly, Dean would be accepted for who he is, but then again, he can’t say it out loud for the life of him. Not since John. Not since the fight.
A week had passed by already.
I'm leaving on the thirtieth, Cas."
He hears in the distance a door slamming shut and, with the certainty of Green having noticed the flyer, Castiel continues along on his walk down to the bus stand.
play dirty? I can play dirty. No more chocolates in your Tupperware,
"Yeah?"
Mr. Kreschner smiles, all gummy and wide as he claps Castiel on the shoulder. Part of Castiel wants Kreschner to leave him alone, to leave him to mope to himself, to cry, to regret, to brood, but part of him appreciates the empathy Kreschner shows him, especially the silent, mutual understanding lingering between them.
A brief pause lingers in the air, before Green's voice travels along, sheepish now.
"So, first off, there's several types of spells that exist in witchcraft. Each spell has a different nature and origin. But what I'm going to talk to you about is a collateral spell," She pauses to make sure she has all attention, before continuing, "-A collateral spell is when the spell is aimed at a person but ends up affecting the people
"Asking questions, are we? How about I make you a deal? I answer your question, you answer mine. Sound good?"
a morning person." Sam snorts, folds his newspaper, and slides out of his seat. Dean watches him for a few seconds, before nipping at his bottom lip, then nods.
"Wh—"
"Jesus, Blue."
"I want to see you."
"Happy new year, Cas."
Dean laughs, his head thrown back, before looking to the side to face Castiel. All at once, he feels an urge crawling through him, the urge to pull Castiel closer
His eyes rolled to the back of his head as Dean's tongue sucked him, assaulted his hole in the best way possible, fucked into him with no less mercy than he promised he'd show, and Castiel struggled to hold onto the leather seat as he felt his orgasm near.
The wipes are soft and damp, and they glide over Dean's rough skin, the blood on Dean's skin seeping away into the wipe, as Castiel skims his fingers over the wounds.
is only comforting with some people. Like it is with you. I don't think I'd be able to cuddle
"I read," says the man, a glint of satisfaction in his voice.
"But?"
"Fuck, taking my cock so good, baby, all nice and tight like a good boy for me. Dirty little whore, you wanna' swallow my come? Where do you wanna' swallow it? Should I feed it to your hungry little cunt or to your filthy fucking mouth?"
"What?" Dean mumbled, dejected, mostly hurt, as he crouched down to help Castiel, his face crest-fallen, a frown curling at his lips.
As much as he hated it, he felt a smile curl at his lips.
— do something— I can't take it anymore—" Castiel moaned into the back of his palm, and his persistence only encouraged Dean, who began moving his hips with a slow, testing pace, leaning down to wrap his arms around Castiel's petite body, and hold the omega close to his chest. He felt Castiel's breath over his neck in soft, warm puffs, and Dean himself dove down to press his nose into Castiel's scent gland.
"The name's Dean. Ranking? Eighth Knight of Hell, specialty—"
"Yeah?"
A relieved sigh escapes past Castiel's lips
"Dean,” Castiel whispers, his voice hoarse and laced with exhaustion, as he struggles to sit up.
Sam's words draw him out of his reverie once again, and Dean turns to his brother with his arms folded across his chest.
Castiel feels his face heat up under Kreschner's gaze, but he compels himself to keep his head up as he watches Dean's car, his Baby, pull out of the parking lot. Without bothering to send Castiel a single glance, the car speeds down the narrow road, out the gates of their apartment complex, and Castiel hangs his head down.
"My parents didn't approve, Mr. Green. They wanted me to have a stable job and a big, fat family, one who'd visit them every Christmas and Thanksgiving. But I couldn't give them that. So, I decided to pursue nursing and here I am. It's a good profession. Pays well. The people are nice. I know what I'm doing."
"Say it," Dean urges Castiel. Their eyes meet for a brief second before Castiel is stepping into Dean's space, close, so close it causes Dean's breath to hitch, and he has to refrain himself from diving down for a kiss.
The loud, hasty patter of footsteps into the kitchen alerts Dean of Sam's presence, for he can tells his brother's footsteps without a prior thought, and at once, he feels the weight of Sam's hand settle on his shoulder. He shrugs it off, and looks away, keeping his eyes fixed onto some mundane part of the kitchen counter.
"Yeah, thanks Dr. Phil, I'll keep that in mind," he quips, before pressing his palms into his face.
There won't be anyone like Dean ever again. His presence in Castiel's life, fitting in so seamlessly, has rendered him irreplaceable. And the hole his departure will leave in Castiel's heart? In his life?
The three white dots appear again.
"Yeah, Cas?"
"That's what I thought," Castiel mutters, and turns on his side, falling back into the mattress, hitching the blanket closer to his chest, his face turned away from Dean.
"Cas, you—" Dean grabbed at Castiel's arm, pulling it back, until Castiel was stumbling into Dean's arms, their chests pressed close, faces inches away, and breaths mingling. The crowd around them carried on with it's chatter, not bothering to care about how close Dean was to Castiel, or how Castiel could smell the scent of coffee in Dean's breath.
Silence hung between them, and the only sound filling the air belonged to the sound of their gasps and pants. Castiel paused for a few seconds, before hooking his fingers through his panties and pushing them down. Dean watched as the lace rolled down his smooth, slender legs and his thick, meaty thighs, before pooling around his ankles, and then Castiel was turning around.
"Very much," Dean smiled, and Castiel broke into a wide, beaming grin as he bounced in Dean's arms, and his skirt bounced with him.
"Hey." A voice drifts along from behind the wall, only muffled in the slightest for today has been quite educational for Castiel, especially in terms of the thickness of his walls. Good to know if the building ever collapses, he'll be dead in ten minutes flat.
"Good," Dean said, and nudged Castiel down until he was on his knees, and watched as Castiel's hungry, excited eyes roamed over Dean's cock, "-have at it then."
this time however, with their hands held in each other's.
"Not a bit, sweetheart."
"Do you want to... Do you want to come sleep with me for the night?" Castiel asks.
Even as his eyes focus on the road ahead, as he continues driving, Kansas blaring through Baby's speakers, he can't help but feel empty. His vision turns hazy, and he realises after a few seconds, it's tears. They cloud up his eyes and threaten to spill.
Dean gulps, and although Castiel is tempted to, he doesn't meet his eyes. He needs Dean to know he's wrong. That he can't just barge in anytime he likes, with no explanation, and expect Castiel to treat him as usual.
"You said
"Great. I mean, the usual. Listen I
Dean replaces the prince's fingers with his own, and adds in a first finger, to which the prince lets out a deafening whine and presses his face into the soft pillows under him, moaning out a muffled string of Dean's name, as Dean adds a second finger. This time, he focuses more on stretching the tiny hole open, rather than simply pleasuring Castiel, as he pulls the rim apart, crooks his fingers, and brushes his digits against the prince's sweet spot. With every brush against the ridge, Castiel's breath stutters, and Dean relishes in the sound of it as he adds in a third finger to check if Castiel's wet hole can at last swallow him inside.
The young boy laughs, watching as Castiel is caught up in his words. He reaches for his violin case with one hand, and with the other, his knapsack, which he slings around a shoulder, before pushing up to his feet.
Straight brown hair that was tucked behind her ear, that flowed like a river over her shoulders; hazel brown eyes that seemed golden when the light caught them, and a laugh so bright, as bright as the sun, especially with her pink lips curling into a grin. She was an angel. A living, laughing angel. And perhaps she knew she was making heads turn. Perhaps she didn't. But that was part of her charm, how she didn't care about the boys who stared at her, or the girls who glared at her.
And now, six years later, Castiel was proud of where they were. He had Dean, he had Claire, and now, he had Jack.
, paired with the obscene squelching, wet sounds of Dean's tongue and lips debauching his hole. Castiel's flesh was soft and it made it all the more better for Dean to squeeze his hands into as he fucked his maid with his tongue, before finally slipping one finger in.
Before Castiel knows it, his fingers are drumming against the wooden arm of the chair, and his head sways on its own volition.
The most amusing part of this pantomime in their life, in Castiel's opinion, has to be the fact that their conversations no longer have to be deep or engaging or meaningful, as he once believed they had to be. For now, they just have to exist.
"I find it's highly comforting. I knew humans needed to share body heat in case of emergencies, but engaging in it myself has put it in a new light. I find it soothing. Very assuring. But I've observed that this
The rim of Castiel's hole burned with the stretch, aching in pain unlike Castiel had ever known, and yet, he craved every second of it, as he held his legs up for Dean, like a perfect little slut, and let Dean thrust up into his tight, wet, heat with a loud string of curses.
Dean pushes himself off the chair, careful not to spill beer over his trousers as he walks over to the table. The screen reads, in bold,
in this feeling. I felt cared for. Understood. Validated. L-loved. And now you’re going to take it all away from me.”
"Well, they're blue."
He's going to miss Dean.
Around him, the room burst into laughter, as Jack simply blinked his round, deep eyes and giggled.
"So, I didn't hear your student today?"
By the Beatles. It was a song she used to sing to put me to sleep each night. It was our song."
"Christ, Cas," Dean sighed, rubbing a thumb over the vinyl, "-you didn't have to do this. You said you hated working overtime. Said you didn't get enough sleep, said it was fucking you up, and you did it all for
This was no ordinary demon.
When Dean reaches Castiel's room in the Bunker, he pauses before the door, waiting for Castiel to call for him, since Castiel has already memorised Dean's footsteps around the floor, but instead of his usual gravelly voice, Dean is met with radio silence.
And Castiel found himself unable to fight against his own urges.
"Alright, so, I think I might play, uh, it's uh, a Serenade, by Franz Schubert. Typically, a piano would act as the background, but I can't play both at the same time."
"W-why would you think I'm moving in a week?" Dean asks, but his voice is weak as if he's been caught doing something wrong.
In a brazen show of assurance, Dean steps forward and laces his fingers through Castiel's. The action has Castiel fluttering his round, expectant eyes up to Dean's, and his lips turn down in a soft frown.
and his stomach leaps with anticipation as he makes his way over to the wall, tucking his hands behind his back as he sighs.
food, and I'll think about it, yeah?"
"Hard, ain't it?"
, y’know. Every time you talk to me. It’s always there in your voice, and god, I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t make my heart break. ‘Cause I hear you, and there’s so much hope in your voice. So much
"'Cause," Castiel starts, a sly tone edging his voice, "
"Hello,” he says.
"Sam, I'm going to need you to shut your face for a hot minute. It's not a woman, and it sure as hell ain't love. Am I not allowed to have my own personal reasons for not moving in so soon?"
Unable to hold himself back anymore, Dean thrust in one last time, with the strength of a thousand muscles, and felt Castiel twitch under him, his legs trembling as they hovered in the air next to Dean, his hole leaking and his back arching off the bed. Castiel felt his orgasm rip through him, and it burst out in thin streams staining his and Dean's skin, but the euphoria of his orgasm was quickly overshadowed by the feeling of Dean's large, throbbing knot lodging itself inside Castiel's hole.
"Yeah, uh, that sounds great, maybe someday in January. When I give this flat up."
Castiel smiles pours coffee into a cup, before turning back and handing it to her.
"Do you like him?" Castiel asked. Claire gulped.
Castiel asks, and Dean shakes his head.
"Hey, Blue."
"Your cock is beautiful, my liege. So small, and red, and leaking. I can't restrain myself anymore," Dean whispers, to which Castiel moans, almost as high as a young maiden, and Dean is struck once again, by how exquisite the prince is.
Dean smiles.
and rises from the table, not bothering about the coffee settled on it. He walks into the bedroom, where the comforter is draped over Dean up to his neck, and without a word, crawls onto the bed, slipping under the comforter, and shifting until his body is pressed against Dean's. Dean is warm, so soft and tempting, and it aches Castiel to disrupt his peace, but he can't hold himself back as he runs his fingers through Dean's hair and burrows his head in the crook of Dean's shoulder, drinking in the sound of his slow breaths, feeling the weight of his chest, rising and falling steadily against Castiel's own, and drapes Dean's arms around himself.
Castiel had asked him, leaning against the window in their breakroom.
"My condolences, and yes, I do remember you speaking of your parents."
The man smiles and steps forward, and at once, Dean's eyes drop to where the man's soft, pink lips curl into a grin. He allows himself the smallest luxury of drinking in the man’s form, his cardigan snug on his broad shoulders, his black denim jeans hugging his lean thighs, and his phone and earphones clutched tightly in his hand. By all means, Castiel,
Dean asks, eyes narrowed in confusion as he stares at the wall behind him.
"Dean," Castiel breathes, his chest heaving with heavy breaths as his eyes flutter open, only to settle upon Dean with a lewd and yet, somehow tender glint within them.
"What did she say?"
A moment later, Castiel pulls back, and Dean sits up, following Castiel's actions.
"That's not fair, you're using my weakness against me," comes Dean's loud, clear disdain, and Castiel can almost imagine the frown on his face.
When Castiel had moved into a noisy suburb of Central Lawrence one winter morning, he had never expected a boy with dark, clustered freckles, apple-green eyes and three broken teeth to show up at his door and beam at him, introducing himself as Dean Winchester. Castiel, timid as always, had initially found Dean too intense for him, since the boy was always off getting himself into trouble, but soon enough, the two boys were inseparable. Where Dean was, Castiel had to be, and where Cas was, Dean was. Having been through elementary, middle and almost all of highschool together, since they were in senior year now, the two of them had been friends for longer than anyone else.
Castiel nods.
Which is what made it worse.
In the distance, Castiel laughs, and Dean smiles as he grabs his phone from the rack he left it on in the kitchen.
Castiel doesn't respond, but Dean notes his breathing quicken.
right now."
"What is
it back onto the shelf before turning back to Dean. His eyes wander over the space above him, pursing his lips as he appears to think about something.
"It's just... Siblings... It's either love at first sight or..."
Castiel lets out a wet laugh. "He's gone, Mr. Kreschner. Nothing left to fight for anymore."
, in that moment.
"And you'll come back, right?"
Dean might think Castiel is being quiet, as he always tends to be. In reality, Castiel just doesn't want to show Dean the tears that roll down his face, one after the other.
Castiel scoffs, and Dean laughs as he pulls the car out of their parking. In a few seconds they're on the road, the Impala rumbling, the heater whirring, and the touch of Dean's hand to his skin.
A single tear rolls down Castiel’s face.
Dean thought, it looked too good not to eat, and before he knew what he was doing, because at this point every last semblance of conscience and reason had flown out Dean's mind, he dropped to his knees, and rubbed a careful thumb over Castiel's tiny, pink pucker. It quivered under Dean's fingers, but before Dean could refrain himself, Castiel, the slut that he was, pushed his ass back against Dean's face.
"Dean? What are you doing?" Castiel asks, genuine curiosity in his words, and Dean swallows thick, before turning around to Castiel.
"Where is he?" She demanded, and Dean laughed. Sam walked out from inside the kitchen, smiling when he noticed Dean and Castiel, and joined Claire in her demands.
Dean turned his face away, but somehow, Castiel reached out and gripped his trouser, calling to him. Dean paused, and turned around to stared down at him. Castiel noted his face was inscrutable, a bit strange, as if he was deep in thought.
"A few times."
"I— yes. I work at the main NY Presbyterian Hospital, and I usually leave at around ten-thirty in the evening."
"Cas? Buddy?"
Dean quirks his bottom lip in curiosity, but doesn't stop cracking eggs into the pan.
"That should teach you," Dean chuckled, and his black eyes now peered into Castiel's hooded, dim blue eyes, "—I'm gonna' fuck you with the blade, as hard as I can, then I'm going to come in your hole and choke you until my name is the only thing you can breathe in, is that clear?"
“Will you listen to me? For god’s sake?” Dean heaves a loud sigh
"Oh fuck," Castiel hissed, as he let go of a leg, using his free hand to slide it under his skirt and stroke himself. He hooked his leg around Dean's neck, pulling Dean closer until their faces were inches apart, and the moment his blue eyes fluttered open, Dean dove down to crash his lips against Castiel's, not letting the man adjust to his lips before shoving his tongue into Castiel's mouth. Their bodies rocked on their own accords, and Dean found himself losing his senses with every passing second as he drank in every last taste of Castiel's lips. Castiel moaned and hummed into the kiss, rolling his tongue around Dean's and sucking Dean's lips into his mouth. Spit drooled down the sides of their lips, but Dean didn't care, he continued to taste as much of Castiel as he could, until Castiel's head fell back, and his eyes rolled shut.
"Great, why don't you get dressed, and I'll meet you in twenty minutes. I'll knock on the wall. Besides, I need to pack my bags into my car anyway. Might as well do it as soon as possible."
"But life goes on, Blue."
"Let me go," Castiel sighed. He didn't turn back, rather, he couldn't. He couldn't face Dean. Perhaps Dean knew that, which is why he walked around, hand still gripping Castiel's wrist, to face Castiel himself. Even then, Castiel kept his head hung, not wanting to meet Dean's eyes, as Dean stood before him, waiting, uncertain, hesitant. A hundred unspoken words buzzed through Castiel's mind, and perhaps if he had drunk a little more of the bitter, diluted beer, he would have been able to say them out loud.
Gulping with fear, sweat glistening across his body and face, carefully, Castiel turned around, too shocked to even let his fingers fall out from his hole.
"Okay, whatever." Blue laughs, and Dean hears the sizzle one again.
"Alright, I'm going to need you to listen up
It's Cas's.
"I missed you too." Castiel whispers against his face, his breath warm and soft over Dean's cheek.
He asks, and Castiel hands him the glass of water without a word, folding his hands across his chest as he leans back against the counter, watching Dean's throat bob as he downs the glass in a second flat. Dean sets the glass back onto the counter and turns to face Castiel, simply staring at him for a moment before he speaks.
A silence falls upon them as Castiel sucks in a breath, eyes fluttering open to meet Dean's teary green eyes. Absently, he reaches his thumb down to wipe away the tears at Dean's face, despising the way they stain his skin.
Hope you liked it! 💖🥺
Everything but Dean fades into white noise, into something grey that isn't important, and all Castiel can see is Dean, bleeding his color into the world. For a moment, he finds himself speechless.
Castiel doesn't deserve this.
Right as he's about to turn towards Dean's door, it clicks open, and in front of him appears Dean, hands laden with a few duffle bags, the fresh scent of his shampoo floating in the air as Dean smiles. Castiel allows himself a moment to wander his eyes down Dean, down his damp, blondish hair, down his toned, well-built arms stretching taut against the fabric of the dark, brown canvas jacket he's wearing with a green Henley underneath, the very arms that held Castiel the night before.
"F—" Castiel gasped, "—fuck me with your blade— come in my hole— choke me—"
Dean falters, his mouth falling open as he stares at Castiel, who squirms on the bed, a single tear rolling down his face before his eyes slip shut, and he buries his face into the crook of Dean's neck, his trembling hands clasping at Dean's back, gripping at his shirt, as he sobs, and holds Dean close. Unable to move, Dean simply sighs and gives in to the touch, wrapping his arms around Castiel's shoulders, pressing his lips to Castiel's hair, as he stares down at the angel in his arms, writhing in pain, scrambling for purchase, pulling Dean closer and closer.
"Fuck me—
Castiel feels his eyes pool with tears, and although Dean dives down for a kiss, Castiel presses his cold, numb fingers to Dean's lips, eyes wandering back to the car parked a few feet from them, before drifting them back to Dean.  "You're...? You're not leaving?"
?" Round, intrigued eyes peer down at Dean, and for the first time since the morning, Castiel somehow resembles his usual, curious and naive self.
"I am not grumpy. I'm just sleepy right now."
Castiel was disgusting. Or at least, so he thought.
"Why? What is it you do?"
"I want him back," The Empty parrots, teasing Dean before breaking into a low cackling chuckle, "-ah, Dean, so naive, so hopeful. I pity you. Does this look like a joke to you? Do you know the consequences of causing an anomaly in the cosmic balance of the universe? Do you even know
"Maybe you did it wrong."
He was right. Lisa was an angel.
"No. You look like a lumberjack to me."
Castiel squeezes his eyes shut, exhaustion burning the rim of his eyes. He needs sleep; he needs sleep or else he’ll end up saying things to Dean that he’ll regret, and at this point, he doesn’t need things to become worse than they are. He just wants to sleep. Wants to be wrapped in the warmth of a blanket. In the warmth of his bed. He doesn’t want to argue, even though he knows eventually, he will have to talk to Dean about this, but right now, he’s too tired to do so.
The murmurs of the wind, the screeching of tires on the road, the faint chatter, the beeping horns in the distance
"I thought it was cute. And sexy. So sexy."
"Is this alright?"
"I don't even speak in a British accent, Dean, it's not that funny."
"Dean—"
the universe works? Hah, not that I expect you to. After all, you've always been the dumber brother. Bet Sam would know."
"Fine, good night."
"Alright, calm down guys, he's right here." Dean stepped aside, and Castiel smiled, kneeling down in front of Claire, and cradling Jack down in his arms so that his face could be seen— innocent, pure, and serene.
"Right there, Dee—"
"Well, well, well. If it isn't Dean Winchester. Maybe I have to start putting up a sign out side the gate saying No Humans Allowed."
“It’s a classic, Blue, ain’t nothing like it in the world anymore. S’irreplaceable.”
"And that's something you need to work on, but it doesn't mean I'll stop liking you," Castiel argues back, and
"You— keep moving, Dean—"
"Excuse me?"
She laughs, a wicked, pitchy laugh, before turning to Sam.
"Mhm." A pause, before Green speaks up, "-I mean, no, I'm awake, yes, I’m completely awake."
Castiel nods, humming something incoherent, and drops his head against Dean's chest.
“Don’t call me that. Don’t ever call me that.”
"I know what you're saying."
"Sam? Rowena? What's going on?"
home, but hey, Dean wasn't complaining. Castiel bounced on his toes to reach up to a top shelf, and his short, low-cut French maid outfit bounced with him.
Hesitantly, Castiel leans forward, poking the tip of his tongue out to lick through the messy droplets of come on Dean's hand. His eyes, big and blue and round and coy— tease Dean, only deepening his arousal— and so, with his gaze never leaving Dean's, he presses his tongue flat against Dean's palm, and licks up his own come, dipping into every nook and cranny of Dean's hand to suck every last drop of his thick, white release, resorting to kitten licks at last— a move he knows will fuel Dean's arousal, and as expected, Dean mutters out a broken swear.
Deep, blue eyes wander over Dean's chest, and all Dean can do is breathe. He brings his hand up to cover Castiel's on his chest as he shakes his head.
Jack nods and, with a breath of conviction, rests his chin on the chin rest, turns to the stand, and commences playing.
Dean pulled away in time to catch Castiel's awe-struck expressions, his blue eyes wide and gawking. A loony grin spread across Dean's face as he stole a kiss off Castiel's lips.
to check the problem. "What's wrong?" he asks, as he straightens up.
A loopy smile pulls at Dean's lips as he mumbles, "Always."
"Cas."
“Well, when was the last time you played?”
"The spell that hit Castiel, it's a deterioration spell."
"Then stay," he says, and feels Dean nod against his shoulder, feels Dean squeeze him, Castiel's hands roaming across the expanse of his naked back.
Two, wet fingers pushed into Castiel's hole.
"Just trying to process it."
With that, the heavy lull of a slumber drags Dean away, his consciousness spiraling out. Paired with the warm embrace around him, the delicate fingers dancing in his hair, and the assuring weight of Castiel next to him, Dean finds himself falling asleep faster than he ever has before in months.
Dean isn't Dean anymore, and neither is Castiel a person of his own, for in that single moment, everything Dean has belongs to Castiel
"Are you mad at me?"
Dean snorts, throwing another peanut into his mouth. “Did your parents try to
Dean let his mouth fall open as he turned to Garth, and sent him a wide, charming grin. He let go of Castiel's waist, and walked over to catch Garth's hand in a firm, strong handshake. Garth smiled, obviously charmed by Dean, for Castiel knew nobody was immune to Dean. Besides being an alpha, he was confident and self-assured, and Dean had such a big, bright presence, it was hard to not feel overwhelmed by his side.
“I can’t. There’s no time.”
Fallen as he was, Castiel nodded, now devoid of every shred of self-respect and dignity. Oh yes, he would love it. It was dirty, filthy and so utterly human to give into his carnal needs.
"Dude," Dean said after a pause, "- I need to know her, like right now."
"Like a bitch. Couldn't eat for days. Every time I opened my mouth, there would be this searing, hot pain, just
"Good," Dean pulled his fingers away, and touched them to Castiel's chin, urging him to gaze up, "—somebody knew about this portal. Somebody knew about the demons' den in this warehouse. Who was it? Who told Zachariah about this warehouse?"
them. Dean holds his hand out the window, and Castiel's eyes follow the movement as a few beads of white snow settle on his open palm. Dean flicks his palm over Castiel's hair with a rich laugh. Castiel simply shakes his head, running his hands through his hair to shuck the melting snow away, and Dean reaches up to cup his cheek. Their eyes meet, and Castiel feels a pang of guilt course through his veins as Dean reaches up to steal a soft kiss off his passive lips.
"No—" he croaked out, as Dean grinned and cradled Castiel's jaw. He pulled Castiel down, until their faces were mere inches away, and Castiel watched as the last drop of green in Dean's eyes faded into pure black.
Silence falls upon them for a few moments, where Dean and Castiel simply stare at one another as the world whitens around them, drowning in the beauty of the first snow of the season.
"It's uh, I don't know, it's usually messier," Castiel scoffs. He seats himself down at the edge of the bed and peels his socks off. Dean doesn't really know what he's supposed to do, so he simply stands and watches Castiel.
Castiel smiles, nodding along to the elderly man's words, "-Oh, I know. I make up for it in the morning, though."
"That's not what you should be sorry for." Dean's voice had dropped to a whisper, and yet in the silence, it was louder than Castiel expected it to be.
"Listen up, ginger, I don't have time for your fucking jokes. Castiel is hurting, he is crying, and he is in so much pain I can't even begin to describe it to you. If anything happens to my angel because you thought it was fun to lounge around and have a little wine, be all buddy-buddy with us, I'm gonna' grab a witch-killing bullet and lodge it straight into your red little head."
"And does he live up to his name?"
"Son of a bitch, Blue," Castiel hears Green gasp. "This smells amazing."
"That was...
"Shoulda' done this ages ago."
Castiel groaned.
"‘Course you do, sweetheart."
After a short silence, Sam, at last, speaks up.
, and turned his head away. He rubbed at his red face— but then there were broad, tender arms draping something over his shoulders, and he blinked up strangely, only to find Dean's letterman jacket now draped across his shoulders.
"You know, this reminds me of a quote actually," Blue says. His voice has gone higher with enthusiasm, something Dean finds rather endearing, "
"Are you worried about me?" Dean asks.
Castiel urges him once the water is warm enough. Dean blinks back, as if being drawn by Castiel's voice, before he moves, stepping into the shower, eyes glued anywhere but Castiel as Castiel steps in with him. A sigh slips past both of their lips at the first spray of warm water over their heated bodies. Castiel rubs a hand down his chest, watching the sticky release stuck to his chest wash away. Dean shuts his eyes, his breath stuttering as he lets the water wash over him altogether, through his hair, down his muscled shoulders, and down his bruised chest.
Ink flows through the pen in Dean’s hand as he writes, unbothered about the smudges or the stains on the side of his palm for all he cares about in this very moment is penning the words
"Tasty," Dean growled, his voice suddenly octaves deeper and grittier as he growled, and Castiel found himself unable to tear his eyes away from Dean's cock.
Upon being greeted by silence, he shakes his head and walks into his bedroom, digging into his duffle bag for a t-shirt. He pulls it on and stuffs his phone into the pocket of his sweatpants. He grabs a hooded jacket, grabs the keys to his apartment, walks out, and shuts the front door behind him. A shaky breath slips past his lips as he glances at the door next to his own.
is all he has.
"Cas," he pants, once they've parted from each other to suck in a breath, although Dean is sure Castiel doesn't need any, "-I don't know if I can—"
The sound of muffled thuds follows, and in the distance, Castiel hears a door click open
"It hit you," Castiel whispers, his hands coming up to press over Dean's chest, and Dean feels himself seize up at the touch, "-the curse made for me, it hit you."
"Oh, uh, cool, great. I'll be around if you need me." And she's gone, vanished in the blink of an eye.
He was tied up, hanging from the ceiling, with a thick rope wrapped around his chest, framing his dusky, brown nipples, a rope around his neck, a rope around his wrists to hold them in place above his head, and thick, fat ropes around his thighs, digging into his flesh and leaving a bruising mark on his tanned skin. His great, mighty black wings, tied up and plucked at places, with the same, thick ropes. He tried to move, tried to break through, but to no avail.
lay on the seat below him, spread out like Sunday buffet, as he rid himself of his shirt, and ducked down to swipe a tongue over Castiel's navel.
"Are you alright?" A voice called from behind him, and he turned around, only to find the very face he'd been envying seconds ago. Bright, glorious, the epitome of beauty. Lisa.
allowing Dean enough time to move his own mug aside. A moment later, his jaw is being held in Castiel's soft hands, gentle lips brushing against his own, and as if on cue, Dean's hands slide around Castiel's waist, pulling him in, closer and closer, the faint, bitter taste of coffee dancing on their tongues, paired with something so uniquely
"Oh—" Castiel cried out, bucking his hips out and grinding his pantie-clad ass against Dean's cock.
It's by—"
A sick, metaphorical knife twists within Castiel's guts.
"Shut up," Castiel mumbles, and when his eyes shut, he finds himself at peace, at ease; finds himself falling into tranquility, one he finds only with Dean.
Dean doesn't hesitate then. He settles down at the edge of the bed as Castiel glances at him from under hooded, dark eyes, and Dean watches— and feels too— as Castiel raises a smooth, tanned foot; soft and pale at the soles, almost holy, and strokes the tip of his toes against Dean's jawbone.
"You're a hundred per cent sure?" Rowena asks, her voice rising with desperation, as she stares at Dean.
it's done. Castiel may have had a few kisses before, but it stills feels virginal and chaste, despite how the angel is licking into the seam of Dean's mouth, insistent on slipping his tongue inside, and Dean lets him. Their tongues slide around— wet, heated, heavy, messy, dripping— and Castiel makes a tiny sound— the softest of whimpers, and Dean finds himself grounded by how eager the angel is to taste him. Arms entangled, lips joint and drool streaming down their chins, it's sloppier than Dean would have expected, and perhaps it's wandering into a territory Dean doesn't yet want to explore with Castiel, but damn it, he's only human, and there's a gorgeous man, a man whom he loves from the deepest depths of his heart, moaning in his arms and sucking his tongue with such fervour, he can't restrain himself.
Dean was silent for a few seconds, as if testing the tone of Castiel's words, but Castiel couldn't take the silence between them anymore, as he turned around and met Dean's eyes for the first time in fifteen days, "-What do you want Dean?"
"Well, at least they get a star for effort, right? I mean, if I ever had a child, you bet your ass he's listening to Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. Obviously at a lower volume than I do, but the kid's going to need some personality."
Using Castiel's pliability to his own advantage, Dean gripped Castiel by the hips and plowed into his swollen, red hole, their gasps filling the air, before at last, Dean felt the pressure in his gut pop, and he paused, still buried deep inside Castiel when he came. Thick, hot semen filled the tightness of Castiel's ass, and Dean felt himself grin as he wrung his orgasm to its fullest.
Castiel groaned, letting a tear fall down his face.
"Yeah, it's me."
Dean pulls away, tears stinging his face, and he watches as the colour slowly returns to Castiel's face, and a soft smile spreads across his lips.
There's nothing more to it, actually. It's easy to say, much easier to understand. Castiel is in love. For what seems like the first time in his life, he's in love with someone, and it feels
"My break ends in a bit. At four."
And it terrifies Dean. It terrifies Dean because he finds himself torn between wanting to shower the young man with every single ounce of affection the universe could allow him to, and wanting to run away, so far away from Castiel that he'd never see him again. What is even more terrifying, is the fact that Dean even considers either option. He only wants Castiel safe. He wants him happy. And part of Dean knows he'll never be able to keep Castiel happy.
Castiel wanted to hate her. But how could he?
"I have the answers you want," she starts, and Dean gives a soft sigh of relief, "-but," she says, and Dean furrows his eyebrows, "-before I tell you those, I have some questions of my own. For better understanding."
"I, erm, you see—" He started, evidently unsure of himself as he shifted his weight from foot to foot, "-I got a player in my car," His green eyes met Castiel's at last, "-what I'm tryna' say is—"
"Oh, of course."
His head is dizzy, pounding with the slight traces of an oncoming headache, thumping deep inside him. He wants to hold Dean, the same way he did last night. He wants to stay in his arms, wake up with him, go to bed with him, kiss his stupid, salty mouth, listen to his favorite rock songs with him, hear his signature ‘
Don't ask stupid questions," he sniffles and watches as Dean pulls up to a familiar neighbourhood,
up if I fall.”
"Needed to mark you in some way." He growled, only to grab a stunned Castiel by the waist, and flip him over onto his back with a loud thud. Dean crawled over to Castiel's chest, his huge alpha cock hanging right in front of Castiel's face, and grabbed a chunk of Castiel's hair to yank him up.
A silence lingers between them for a moment, and Castiel feels an unusual affection pool inside him. But it's not affection. He supposes it's a certain familiarity that bonds both men, the feeling of being understood, the feeling of being seen.
"Well," Sam pauses, "
Dean almost came again.
"Huh?" Dean asks, turning to glance at Sam, before turning back to Rowena.
sound weird," Dean retorts, himself taken back by the sudden aggravation, before schooling himself to be calm, and when he looks up at Castiel, the angel is smiling, all soft and tender.
"You sound like Dean now."
lives on these pages. And on these pages, he hurts, he envies, he cries, he fails, he stumbles, he loves.
"I'm not trying to complicate things, okay? I'm trying to make them easier for us. If you don't meet me, you'll forget about me sooner. And if you forget about me sooner, you'll be happier sooner." Dean’s voice is agitated, but that is all Castiel knows.
"Hey Alicia. Do you want some coffee?"
"Eh, she was an old friend. Before I was drafted. Cassie. Cas."
and it was
A single tear rolls down his eye.
, before schooling himself and turning back to Rowena.
But now it was Lisa's.
Dean Winchester was going to ruin Castiel. And Castiel was going to love every second of it.
At that, Dean's eyes widen. "And? What is it?"
"Anywhere. I don't wanna' go. I wanna' stay here with you, and Sammy."
"But we're having so much fun."
"Bye sweetheart," he says, and pushes himself up to meet her mother's eyes.
"Not that it's my concern, but do you ever think, maybe, you're just,
"She's— she's— she's—"
Another tear trickles down Dean's face, an almost pathetic reminder of the way Dean has everything he will ever need, and at the same time, he doesn't.
"Forget about it, Blue. It's a part of me I'm always going to carry along, okay?" Dean snaps, wincing at his tone and listening to Blue go silent. "-Every day I wake up and look at myself, there's a blaring reminder of what I did. Nothing is going to change that. Nothing is going to bring back those men or those boys, and nothing is going to make the bombing disappear. And trust me, I'm way beyond the whole trying to
"My bags are stuffed full; besides, I'm wearing a jacket already. Just, y'know, put it on if it gets cold or something."
As Castiel takes a second sip of his coffee, he decides
Things have changed.
Sam sighs, and the grin at his lip falters in the slightest.
He yawns, so wide it makes Castiel chuckle, and he turns onto his back to stretch his arms out before grinning, rolling onto his side and burying himself within Castiel's arms, nosing at his neck, hands sliding around Castiel's waist, under his shirt and over his bare skin, pulling him closer.
She falters, but immediately corrects herself, resuming her knowing grin.
Laughter will echo through the passageway.
With a fading laugh, the Empty's voice vanishes, and yet Castiel stares up at Dean, a confused expression on his face.
A wide grin spreads across Dean's face as he twines his fingers through Castiel's.
"Cas." At once, at the sound of his name, Castiel's eyes snap to Dean, and he raises his eyebrows.
"Congratulations," he said after a pause, "-She's a lovely girl."
"Bullshit. You cook me stuff all the time. You play amazing music for me. You always make me laugh. And you understand me, Blue, more so than anyone I've met. So, really, are you not an angel?"
Castiel throws a wide-eyed glance towards Alicia who seems quite engrossed in her phone, typing away furiously with a blank expression. He turns away, inching his lips closer to the microphone as his face stings with heat, and his words quiver.
"So? Think you'll go?"
Dean pulled away at once, and his eyes dropped down visibly to stare at the smile on Castiel's lips. Castiel, in turn, continued to stare at the adorable freckles on the alpha's nose and cheeks. But a moment later, Dean's eyes wandered up, meeting Castiel's, and a panic-struck expression spread over both of their faces upon having been caught staring.
Castiel sucks in a breath.
Flustered at being caught, Castiel shakes his head, rubbing his face on his sleeve as he clears his throat, and steadies his breath.
, but all that comes out is a confused hum.
Castiel smiles and tightens his grip around the buns before raising it to his mouth and sinking his teeth into the soft, fluffy bread. The meat is tender, oozing with oil, and it's the right amount of spicy and smokey, paired with the cool tanginess of the tomatoes and the crunch of the lettuce. The cheese sticks to his tongue, and he groans because it's been days since he had a burger — something greasy that will probably clog up his arteries.
"Oh please, just say you have a pathetically lonely love life and go."
A week from now, he knows he'll still be numb. A month from now, who knows? A year from now? Can't tell.
"Oscar Wilde."
"Why?" Castiel asks, holding the jacket up in his arms as he watches Dean lick his lips.
"Yeah. Lives in LA."
The alpha paused, stepping before Castiel, much to Castiel's confusion, and gripping him by the shoulders.
He simply doesn't feel the need for a partner. Besides, if he ever got down to wanting one, he's sure he'd have to search far and wide to find someone who understands him. It's a typical excuse for people to say so, but Castiel means it. Vanity means nothing to him, what
"You’re an idiot, by the way.”
"Her," Dean mumbled, "-the girl who just walked by."
"I'm thirty-six,” he says. “-you?"
Mildred smiled, and Castiel realised she seemed sweet, quite approachable. Her presence was bright and large, similar to Dean's. Perhaps she might be more of a dominant alpha. To Castiel though, she seemed quite motherly, and with the way her face softened at the sight of Castiel's swollen stomach, Castiel found himself at ease with her presence.
"Never."
"This," Castiel started, "-is more my type."
But Dean doesn't care. As long as he has his family, his love, his happiness next to him.
The itch usually accompanied with his heats had finally subdued, all thanks to Dean's insistent finger-fucking and Castiel's orgasm, and yet, his body wanted more, no—
And because Dean couldn't refuse an offer as tempting as that, he dove in, pressing his face against Castiel's taint, rolling his tongue around the lace, soaking it with his saliva and rubbing his finger right over the hole, never pushing in.
"Deeeeaaan— want you to fuck my hole, please, want you to feed me your come—"
"I'll cook you something for lunch, Green."
Sitting in a corner in his room, since all his furniture was packed up and transported a few days ago, his phone in his hands, thumb hovering over Castiel's number, Dean glances at the time on the screen. It's already past eleven at night. It's a Saturday, which means Castiel doesn't have work, but it's also Dean's
It was a hilt. The hilt of The First Blade.
"The only thing you should be using your mouth for," Dean growled, digging his nails into Castiel's jaw as he gripped his chin, "-is to make those pretty little noises, yeah?"
"Just a single glance, Dean. A single look."
“I, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to assume, it's just— I’d been under the impression that you were straight. Especially since we talked about your past relationships a few weeks ago. May I… May I ask why you don’t tell people about it, or am I crossing a line?”
"No, what?" Dean asks, now confused himself, unable to read Castiel's expressions.
"Niccolò Paganini. He's one of the best violinists of all time. People say he sold his soul to the Devil to play the way he does. He had fingers so long, he could play three octaves at once," Castiel says, and Dean laughs.
Rowena pauses, setting her hands down on the table, sighing in content, looking up at Sam and Dean through her mascara-laden eyelashes, and at last, sends them both an amused grin.
"God, we should do this every day," Dean mutters, but pauses as if realizing the words he said.
The book in Castiel's hands is pressed shut as he leans forward in his chair.
The soft click of the door unlocking draws Dean's attention to it. He wonders if Castiel heard it as well, since he doesn't quite make it known he has. With his eyes to the door, Dean watches as Sam steps in, confused, concerned, mostly bemused when he spots Dean on the bed, and then, of course, curled up by Dean's side, Castiel.
I don’t want to talk right now.”
"I said, who told Zachariah about this warehouse?"
"Which one?"
Men don’t cry. Men don’t cry. Men don’t—
Castiel cried at Dean's words, hoping half-heartedly for Dean to push his fat cock inside his hole already, but also for some miracle to appear out of thin air and save Castiel from his fate.
At last, Dean will end up before his bedroom, the door still shut. But instead of the usual darkness lurking inside, bright, yellow light seeps out from underneath the door. With a smile, Dean pushes the door open, and his eyes will fall upon him, upon his other, bigger
"Dean—" Castiel sobbed, his face flushed with heat, as he heard the sound of a zipper sliding open, followed by the sound of trousers rustling. Scared, yet somehow aroused, Castiel pulled away, putting a good distance between Dean and himself, but his actions were in vain, because the moment he'd pulled away, a hand gripped him by the back of his head, and shoved him down over Dean's crotch.
He ran, pushing people aside, shoving them out of his way, dashing out the door, where the noise of the music was muted, and the air was fresh, and didn't reek of alcohol and puke, and this was what Castiel needed— space. He needed space to breathe. He filled his lungs with the fresh, cool air until once again, the chill of the winter begun to crawl down Castiel's skin, and he wrapped his arms around his chest, blowing out a soft puff of air as he walked down the narrow pathway into God-knows-where.
"Oh? Which podcast are you listening to?"
Before Dean can protest, Sam holds his hand up, "-I know, I know, I have you, you have me, but at the end of the day, we need someone else, someone we can hold and touch, and choose to fall in love with each day, rather than be obliged by familial ties."
As he moves about his living room, his eyes fall upon a book in one of his boxes and he leans down to pull it out. It's ‘
how did you get this?"
"Is that a
“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” he asks, and his voice rises higher with seething anger.
Dean loved watching his catboy work around the house.
Castiel's chest heaved with deep breaths. Dean's hand dropped from his wrist down to his palm, his fingers brushing against Castiel's in the slightest, and the touch had sparks flittering over Castiel's skin. Dean's words echoed through his hazy mind.
I can’t even pick
"Ah, hamburgers. God's greatest creation," Dean said with a wistful sigh, causing Castiel to grin.
"Mhmph-" comes the loud, muffled reply, and a few seconds later, "
"I'm Dean, by the way, Dean Winchester."
"God, you're— ah, you're cute, c'mon, I don't care. I'm not going to be easy on you just cause you're a virgin."
Dean smiled against Castiel's face, and his hands wrapped around Castiel's stomach protectively. Castiel laughed, tilting his head to meet Dean's eyes, "-Hmm. I wonder who it could be. Certainly there is no one prominent who comes to my mind," he teased, and watched as Dean pouted, so endearingly petulant, Castiel couldn't help but grin wider. Absently, his eyes wandered back towards the manor, and he sighed.
"Bite me," Castiel groaned, expecting another slap, or perhaps even a punch, but it never came. His eyes fluttered open, and he found Dean smiling.
Page after page, after page of music.
Dean used to hate nights.
Green hisses audibly, before clicking his tongue.
"I know it's a Saturday, you must be sleepy," Dean says, and rises up, hand reaching out to touch Castiel on instinct.
Green eyes meet his.
and Castiel jumps back, eyes wide as he glances at the wall in front of him. "Was that... Was that the wall?"
"You're annoying. So, so annoying," Castiel grit out, his lips in a pout as he glared at Dean with narrow eyes. Dean, much to his surprise, laughed, and with another firm touch to the small of his back, led Castiel out of the record store.
"Well, y'know," The alpha scoffed, assuming a much confident position now as he straightened his shoulders and lifted his chin with a nonchalant shrug.
Castiel meets Dean's eyes. His eyebrows knit and his face flushes red as he stomps a foot, then turns away from Dean to grab his coffee.
"I just need you to be with me, Dean, and I know we'll work through this."
Dean looks to Sam as if to say
Something soft. Something tender. Something frightening.
"Dean?"
"Of course."
"You won't leave? Promise?" Castiel asks, all at once, and although Dean doesn't really know which
"What do you mean
In response to Castiel, Dean simply nods, and lets Castiel's fingers explore— watching much more intently than feeling— as Castiel unbuckles Dean’s belt, undoes his jeans, and pulls them down to his thigh. Castiel pauses for a moment, as if hesitant and unsure as he stares down at Dean's boxers, but Dean rubs his thumb across his cheekbone, and with that, Castiel seems to melt into the touch. His fingers pull Dean's boxers down, and his eyes widen as Dean's cock springs up in his face.
Something dark. Something hungry and greedy. Something
"—He warned Orpheus that for no reason must he look back while his wife was still in the dark, for that would undo everything he hoped for. He should wait for Eurydice to get into the light before he looked at her," The Empty continues. Dean however, struggles squirming and grunting, as he feels his lungs being crushed, his skin being burnt, and his nerves ablaze—
"Castiel, no."
This is exactly why Castiel hates crying. Because it always puts him in a tight spot, always makes him mumble, shout, and say things he isn't supposed to.
"I did, Dean."
“It’s… It’s true,” Dean admits.
"Go on, baby, I want you to come all over your skirt. That's what a dirty little girl would do, wouldn't she?" Dean growled, and snapped his hips until he was pounding into Castiel with all his might, his orgasm creeping closer and closer. Castiel's hands fell back to grip the edge of the counter and his legs fell open wider around Dean as he knit his eyebrows together and rocked on the counter with his toes curled . Dean watched as his cock came in thick, white splurts and painted his skirt. The come stuck to the fabric, and Castiel almost went limp, but Dean hadn't finished with him.
"Hey Cas?"
"That's it– that's the one–" Dean gasps, and glances over at Sam, who stares at him with wide, expectant eyes.
"Hey,” Sam greets, glancing up at Dean from his newspaper, and with uncertain feet Dean treads into the kitchen, heading for the bottle of water on the counter before turning to Sam.
"Yes! Yes, Dean, I want to redeem myself to you," he says, and scrambles across the bed, bending over the headboard, grabbing the mounds of his ass to spread them open, and presenting his sweet, ripe hole to Dean, who wraps his hand around his wet cock and begins jacking himself off at the sight. No matter how hard he wants to grab Castiel by the hips and ram into him, Dean waits and watches.
. It was warm. Much warmer than Castiel had expected it to be. Warm enough that Castiel's
" Shaky breaths slips past his lips,
Dean falters for a moment before collecting his scrambled thoughts and composing them into comprehensive words. Or at least he hopes that’s what they are.
Castiel’s voice is broken, pathetic, repulsive to himself. He wonders if Dean is as distraught as him. If he feels a weight inside his chest, if he finds it hard to keep himself composed, if he finds it hard to think straight. There is one thing Castiel admires about himself, and it is his ability to string himself together, even in times where his mind is screaming at him to break apart. And yet, it startles him how easily Dean can break through his precariously built walls of self-control.
Castiel’s face remains unreadable for a moment before he gives a soft smile and looks away, towards the garden behind Dean, and it allows Dean a free moment to drink in the sight of Castiel's face
"Don't you regret it, though? Not having made more effort to keep her?" He asks.
Their fingers link together at last.
Castiel was supposed to be at the Winchester's place, helping Mary with the pies in the kitchen while John and Dean set up the table, and Sam, Dean's brother, followed after Castiel like a puppy, eyes wide and tail wagging when Castiel taught him about a new scientific discovery. Michael and Gabriel were supposed to bring over meat and wine, and gifts for the Winchester family, and they were supposed to eat lunch together, laughing and chatting. Castiel and Dean were supposed to head up into Dean's room, and fall back on the bed, their bellies bulging with food, with Castiel always falling asleep on Dean's arm and Dean waking him up when it was evening.
, the love of his life, the crux of his existence, his best friend, his confidant, his— his everything. And though these words will crawl in the back of his throat, all he'll be able to say is, "-hey grumpy."
"What did, erm, what did Rowena say?" Castiel asks, breaking the heavy silence between them at last, as he clicks his teeth, and shifts back until his body is nestled between the soft pillows on the bed.
"Let me, uh, let me get it." And with that excuse, Castiel ran up into his room, ignoring Lisa and Dean's murmured whispers. Maybe they were worried about Castiel. Maybe they found it strange. Once in his room, Castiel let his head fall against the door, and he sighed, rubbing the sleeve of his robe over his face and concentrating on steadying his breath as he wiped away his tears. A few seconds later, he dug Dean's gift out from under his bed, and a smile graced his lips at the memory of buying it.
"What if I see a cat? Huh?
"I suppose so." Another chuckle from the man, and Castiel's eyes slip open, as he feels prompted to ask,  "-you moved in two days ago, didn't you?"
teacher, but also as companions.
replaced you, how I almost lost you."
"No, Mr. Kreschner. Dean's moving out at the end of the month, not this week. If he was moving out sooner, he'd tell me. Did you read the letter right?"
"No, no, this is wrong. You're both wrong. This ain't got anythin' to do with me, and my- my- my
"Yeah, this is my mate, Castiel, and I'm Dean. You could just call us by our names, that's alright," Dean said.
"Dean?"
—" Castiel sneezed suddenly, ducking his head to the side and burying his face over his shoulder, sniffling and rubbing at his nose on his shoulder, when all at once, there were hands on his back, and something draped over him.
"It's the angel? Oh dear, should've told me, my poor little bird is in trouble." She snorts, a short, wicked smile tugging at her lips.
It was the third of December. Winter had begun to creep its way into Lawrence, and although Castiel should have known better than to walk out of his house without a jacket, wearing his usual half-sleeved button-up and jeans, it was too late to turn back now. So, he had carried on with his day, and now, stepping out of the coffee shop, where Dean and he often frequented, the chill of December finally crawled down his skin and a shiver ran down his spine. Standing a few feet away, leaning against the black, glossy Impala, was Dean, his face hung and eyes staring down intently at his phone, but the moment he sensed Castiel's presence, his eyes lit up and a smile spread across his face. And with a charming grin like that, Castiel found it hard to hold back his own smile, as he walked over towards Dean to hand him his coffee.
"You think," the alpha growled, his breath panting hot against Castiel's throat, his canines sharp and hovering over Castiel's neck, right over the frail, smooth flesh, and Castiel felt himself leak in Dean's lap, staining Dean's skin with his slick, "-you think you can just come in here," Dean panted, "-act all cute and submissive, show my your hole, show me your neck, show me your pink, little nipples, and not leave with a mark on your neck? You brat, you
It's settled then.
"Dean," Castiel rasps, his voice hoarse from having just awoken. The need in his voice dries up Dean's throat, and he feels a punch to his gut.
What follows after can only be described as a flurry of clothes being pulled off and tossed to the side with no care, and a bustling of skin on skin as heavy breaths drench the silence of the room, and paired with them are soft, keening hums made by Castiel every time Dean twists his finger against his prostate. Somehow, they've ended up on the bed with Dean on his knees between Cas’s legs and Castiel laid back on the pillows, and Dean surges forward to drape himself over Castiel for a kiss, fingers squelching inside Castiel's lubed, wet hole.
"No," Castiel starts, "
Castiel's words had sent a wave of arousal coursing through each inch of Dean's being. Deep within his bones, he felt his urges deepen, and all at once, Dean needed to see Castiel. The faces he was making, the colour of his nipples, the way his hair was a mess, the way his collarbone looked so tempting— so without a word, he hooked his arms under Castiel's chest and pulled him up. Castiel groaned at the action, but followed Dean's lead.
"Oh?"
"Dean," He moaned, finally, as he went limp in Dean's arms and fell against Dean's chest, the high of both of their orgasms mingling in the air as Dean shuffled them onto the seat in such a way that his back was against the car door, and Castiel lay atop him. A few silent moments passed between them.
But then he felt something else poking at his hole. Something wet.
"I'm heading home for a shower," Dean states, blunt and decisive.
Castiel smiles. Dean always talks about things with such passion and, such admiration, it's hard not to smile. Dean
"No, what I'm telling you," Blue heaves a breath, his voice stern and resolute, "-is that despite these flaws, you deserve to be happy. You deserve to fall in love with whoever you want, you deserve to do the things you love, and you deserve to live life your way."
"Alright, just lie down for me, buddy, okay, I'm gonna' go get Sam, and we're gonna' take care of you. Are you, do you have a fever? Do you know what's happening?"
A broad grin spreads across Dean's face as he kisses Castiel's fingers.
And she'd never been the one to spent months searching for Castiel in purgatory, day or night, praying and praying, and she'd never been the one to see Castiel get left behind in purgatory, only to be haunted by the thought of him for every night that followed.
"Why not?"
"You should be thankful I'm putting it inside the safe way up, yeah? Fucking angel scum," Dean growled, and the warmth Castiel once felt from his words had now ceased to exist, replaced with pure, fiery hatred. Fear grew in the pools of Castiel's gut, knowing now Dean had accomplished his goal, knowing he meant nothing to Dean now. Of course, why would Dean treat him with compassion anymore? All Castiel was to Dean now— was a hole to ruin.
"My nipples and my hole," Castiel answered softly, bringing one hand up to pinch a nipple, while the other reached down to rub a finger over his soaked rim.
"You deserve this, Dean, you deserve happiness, and love, and good things. You know you have me, right? For anything, for everything. And I need you, Dean, I really do. You make me happier; you make me stronger; you make me want to be better for both of us."
“Good or bad?”
Think about all the people you could meet, all the people you could be with. Out of every single person you could possibly find, you choose me?"
Castiel glances back at the clock
"Well, that's a relief, but to answer your question, I don't like silences."
"He's got a house, my childhood home, back in Lawrence, Kansas, where I grew up. Since Mom isn't here either and he never drew up a will, legally the house is mine. I thought I'd come here for a few months first, y'know, to detach myself from there. To detach myself from the memories, good and bad, to detach myself from the house. It's up for renovation. Once it's done, I'll be moving back in."
"Fine. Move in with me back in Lawrence. Get another job as a nurse there. Start a new life with me. It ain't easy, baby, it's hard work."
"It never is. I'd sell my soul for even a single day with you as my love."
Dean asks, and Castiel tips his head back, over to the comatose body on his couch, chest rising and falling under the blanket.
Right as he's about to enter the building, however, a voice yells out to him,
"I made us some curry and rice. I'll leave it at your door." he says, and Dean's eyes widen as he walks out into the living room, having finished his third bottle of beer that evening, phone pressed to his ear.
"Erm, not yet. I mean, he knows I like someone. He just doesn't know who."
With a sigh, Castiel pauses and looks up at the wall, a dreamy smile on his face as Green’s pouty words settle in his thoughts.
Castiel's voice is soft, genuine, and it tugs at something deep inside Dean's chest.
Dean remains silent for a moment
"Dean? The veteran from my flat?"
Drenched in the heady scent of Castiel's heat, Dean found it hard to will himself to stop. At this point, where his hips were nothing short of pistoning into Cas's tight, slick hole, even if Castiel were to claw at him and push him away, slap him or beat him or kick him, he wouldn't be able to stop. It scared him, but with the way his omega continued to writhe in pleasure under him, he decided to ignore his intrusive thoughts, and focus on the beautiful, adorable little thing under him.
"No, no, it belongs to an angel. The angel Cassiel. My mother was a devout Christian, and my father a hippie. They went crazy naming their kids. So I have brothers named after angels, Michael, Gabriel—"
With a sigh, they slip into a comfortable silence, the air around them sweet with laughter, and Castiel wonders if Dean ever thinks of him outside of their daily conversations. If he ever finds himself thinking about Castiel when he's busy writing his therapy reports, or if he ever mentions Castiel to anyone else, or if he, like Castiel, finds himself smiling at the thought of their conversations.
"And? What did you see?"
"Blue I—" Dean begins, only to be cut off by Blue, who now seems to have slipped into a venting episode—
Now this fact, although quite endearing, has put Castiel in a rather tight spot since it means Mr. Green is now privy to all aspects of his personality, and not just the one he's been showing for the past, well, two weeks now.
"Are you alright? We don't have to do this, baby? We don't—"
"I'm... I don't know."
Relief washes over him, and he turns around, at last, a smile spreading across his face. The rift zap shuts, and lying at his feet—
It is as if the world and Dean have become two separate entities, where nothing outside the room is of importance anymore, as if time passes by slowly, no buzzing, no rush, no haste
, I need to know everything. So, who will it be? The handsome, tall one, or the love-sick puppy?" she grins, and Dean feels the exceptional urge to punch the grin right off Rowena's wicked, bright face, but he keeps his impulses in check, and resorts to a simple snarl.
This had to be a lie.
Castiel groans, and Dean feels his body twitching under him, before at once, Castiel is taking control of his own actions, much to Dean's joy, and pulling away.
Castiel lets out a staggering breath, before turning his eyes up to Dean's, and Dean feels his breath hitch. "No, Dean, we can't say for sure. Are you feeling alright? Dizzy, uneasy, anything?"
"Twenty-four hours of skin-to-skin contact. If it's an object that's deteriorating, it must be held to the owner's skin for twenty-four hours. In our case, we have a cute wittle angel rotting to death, so Dean needs to hold him for twenty-four hours, bare skin touching. The energy consolidated in your bond with Castiel will rejuvenate him. But it is of utmost importance that the contact must not be broken for a period of more than a few minutes. If it is broken for more amounts of time, the degenerative process will fasten."
"I think I undoubtedly will."
Both his catboy and him groaned out, and Castiel curved his back, his cute, black ears twitching when Dean fucked into him. He pulled his cock out inch by inch, only to plunge it deeper, and Castiel rocked against the desk with each thrust. With his black skirt fallen open and his panties pooling at his ankles, he couldn't be more arousing. Paired with his tiny mewls and whimpers, he was someone straight out of Dean's wet dreams.
person to know.
That makes sense. Dean moving to New York to detach himself from the memories back home, now it makes sense— This must be why he couldn’t answer Castiel the day the first spoke, because he wouldn’t have wanted to be revisited by those memories.
"It just did."
Castiel obeyed, turning around wordlessly, and bending over the countertop. Dean watched, awestruck, as Castiel spread his legs open and grabbed both cheeks of his ass in his hands to pull them apart. The thin fabric of his pantie sunk into the narrow depths of his ass, and the lace rubbed against his pucker beautifully. Dean's eyes tracked every inch of his skin with a predatory gaze, and he dragged a finger over Castiel's thigh— up his netted stockings and over the round, plump flesh. Dean grabbed one of the cheeks in his hand and squeezed it tightly.
—" Dean side-eyed Lisa, who in turn, stomped on his foot, "-Christmas gift. I'm sorry."
"My— my ass—"
"This is my voicemail. Make your voice... a mail."
"Classic rock? As in?"
Castiel glanced down at the cassette and chuckled.
The long walk to his bedroom, leading from the narrow passageway of the bunker which seemed to cave in with every passing second, the ear-stinging creak of his door as it swung open to reveal the dark, bare room, where nothing but Dean's own shadow greeted him. Dean would walk in, switch on the dimmest light, push of his boots and slump back down on the bed, unbothered about a blanket or a pillow, until sleep lulled him away.
Their waitress, on the other hand, looks like a kid who's been told Santa isn't real.
Unable to help the lump rising in Dean's throat, and the tightness in his chest, Dean shifts closer to Castiel, slipping his arms under his pliant, too weak body, as he helps him sit up. However, the first touch to Castiel's body has Dean's fingertips burning, and he stares at Castiel's sullen face, his own eyes wide as he sucks in a breath.
With a shake of his head, Castiel dismisses his scrambled thoughts and fixes the lid of the container on tight, confining the tempting scent of the apple pie he baked a while ago for Dean, for no reason at all. It's about eight in the morning, which means Dean must have finished with his shower already. Maybe Castiel should knock. Or maybe not. He purses his lips and glances between the wall and the door before deciding to leave the container at Dean's doorstep. It doesn't take him more than a few seconds to do so, and he walks back inside his apartment, a giddy anticipation in his veins, and raps against
Dean watches as Castiel rubs his thumb against the tip and strokes Dean, fingers dragging up and down, and the hand in Castiel's hair tugs slightly, prompting Castiel to let out a sated hum. The pressure building in Dean's gut coils tighter, and he dreams of the sheer anticipation of being able to touch Castiel's cock after ages of self-restraint.
"Do you like it?"
"Blue."
"So, what are you going to do today?" he asks, clearing his throat.
Alright, I'm done. You can get to the fic now, folks.
"I can't believe it. Of all the people..."
drunk— smashed, hammered, absolutely piss drunk— or Castiel was
"You're rambling, dear," Rowena sings, a smile dancing at her lips, and Dean fixes her a narrow glare.
Castiel leaked at the tip, his pink cock dripping pre-come against his own volition, as Dean reached a hand up to rub against Castiel's blood-stained nipple.
"You can, Dean. You can, alright? You just
"But Mildred I—"
The limited edition Led Zeppelin Physical Graffiti album vinyl.
But he's not.
It rings and rings and rings.
"It's alright," Castiel smiled, "-a gift is a gift. I'm sure it's lovely."
, and Castiel grins at having enticed such a reaction from him. Castiel hums as he sinks his lips lower on Dean's cock, knowing just how lewd he must look to Dean with his fat, pink lips wrapped around Dean's cock. Dean knows Castiel, enough to know when he's being sincere and when he's teasing, and this is most
"Promise?"
"What do you wanna’ eat, sweetheart?"
"Oh, it's been locked for years. Some fifteen and counting, as of now."
"Cas?" he calls out once again, but to his surprise, he's met with more silence.
, needing Castiel to be closer to him, as close as possible.
"Dean."
"What? Why?"
it was supposed to be under renovation until January, right?"
"Good," Dean sighs, and drops a kiss between the prince's clothed shoulder blades, "-I will be gentle."
With every ounce of energy he could muster in his body, "-die, you filth," Castiel spat out.
No one could tell how soon. No one could tell if he'd come back at all. The cost of being part of Crowley's gang, of being one of his best henchmen.
“That’s true.”
lingers on his tongue, he lets it fade away as he captures Castiel's lips in a kiss, revelling in the tiny sound that escapes past his plush, pink lips. Castiel arcs his back into the kiss, hands fumbling around Dean's shoulders as he spreads his legs open wider. Dean lets a hand curl around Castiel's neck, while the other fucks into Castiel's greedy hole, which swallows him in without any hesitation, and Dean is prompted to wonder about what else it would swallow in so easily. It's beautiful, Dean muses, Castiel's hole. Pink, tight, tiny, and fleshy. It's tighter than Dean expected to be, and the moment Castiel clenches down around Dean's fingers, it brings Dean crashing back to reality.
Perhaps he would have spared himself some misery.
"Who?"
"Dean— I'm close—" Castiel hisses, breath heavy and panting, eyebrows knit together and his bottom lip caught between his teeth as he nears his climax.
Castiel's face was coloured with a beautiful scarlet blush, his eyes deep and disoriented, his hair tangled and tousled, his lips swollen from having been biting them, and his neck sweaty and glistening. Damn it, Dean missed out on
"You never let me apologize."
“‘Cause I’m
As if on cue, Dean growled, and Castiel felt excruciating pain on the flesh of one of his ass cheeks. He glanced behind, only to find Dean snarling, his canines on display, and a small drop of blood on his teeth.
"Oh yes, Dean please—"
"This," Castiel chuckles. "This, this reminds me of a—" His chuckle exalts into a rumbling laugh, and he hears Green sigh on the other side.
"More than anything."
"Your parents must be extremely happy together in heaven, Mister, mister— I don't know your name."
As if having realised he was the center of attention in the conversation, Jack fluttered his big, blue eyes, almost eerily similar to Claire and Castiel's, and the first thing he did was—
"Man, I can't believe you were dumb enough to not wear a jacket. It's fucking winter, it's gonna' snow in a week, and you're out here in your—" Was that worry lacing Dean's words? It sounded like. Castiel glanced up at Dean, who had pulled off his own red, letterman jacket and had draped it over Castiel's shoulders.
It's by
Disgust and shame coursed through his body.
Dean was silent for a solid minute before he spoke.
Dean reaches behind him to flip the light switch, and instantly, drenches the room in utter darkness.
He doesn't really know why the question pops into his mind, but whenever Dean mentions their house at Lawrence, Castiel can't help but think of Dean's brother, although he's never seen him.
And another.
There's a distinct affection in Blue's voice, a fondness to his words as he speaks.
"B—but how? I
The door grit open, and although Castiel found himself unable to move a single muscle in his body, he lifted up his head and glanced at the stranger at the door.
"I need you, buddy."
Had he been a
Castiel waits, expecting the man to fill in the gap by responding with his name, but instead, he is met with silence. So, with a soft exhale, he grabs his backpack and walks out the door.
"Why? Planning to have all the fun without me, omega?"
Sneezed.
"In ancient times," she starts, not bothering for Dean's hesitancy, "-it was often a curse used on kings, by witches who wanted to fall at their feet as their whores, and it would essentially cause the kings' queens to die a slow death."
It isn't something he'd usually say out loud, but then again, it's not as if the man will remember.
Another silence ensues.
"Don't think you will for a long time, sweetheart," Dean scoffs as he rests his head back against the wall.
, and Dean complies. He pulls back at once, leaving the air above Castiel empty, only joined at the hips, as he grabs hold of Castiel's waist, and at the utter of the words
Dean was a good alpha. Castiel knew that. He had always known that. Any omega would be more than lucky to have him.
Knock, knock, knock.
Before he can stop himself, his eyes cloud with tears, and he feels a single, small tear roll down his face.
about men, but I've always thought of them as forbidden territory."
Dean simply squeezes his arms around him, and buries his face into Castiel's neck.
"Fuck," Dean snarled, as if fuming fire from his nose as he rolled Castiel over onto his tummy, and pressed his face down into the bed. He grabbed Castiel's hips and raised them up high until Castiel was practically digging his toes into the mattress to keep himself up, and with anticipation and relief coursing through Castiel's veins— because finally, his alpha was going to take care of him— he waited for the first touch.
Dean gulps. It has to be something inducing him, but at once, his mind flashes with images of gorgeous, cold blue eyes, and then, a bright, warm smile. A beige trenchcoat, a blue tie and messy black hair soon fill his sight, and he feels himself stumbling down over his feet, his head thumping loud as if being torn apart.
"Then you do things my way."
, isn't here anymore. And as unfortunate as that is, you have the freedom to live your life the way you want to. No one is going to question you, no one is going to stop you. You can't let the words he said to you ten years ago keep you from living the rest of your life to the fullest."
Christmas was supposed to be the way it always had been for the past ten years.
He sips his coffee, pursing his lips as he leans back against a support beam, one he's adorned with pieces of abstract art he'd bought at an auction last year.
But the soft heaving of Castiel's chest, the faint snores, the light rumbles— somehow, they lull him to sleep as well.
"All in good time, dear boy, now, I need to know if you heard the words of the spell. Is there anything you recall? Even a single word?"
"You know," Dean continues after Castiel remains silent, "-phone calls, video chat, texting, stuff like that."
"But that doesn't mean it isn't worth fighting for."
, and she'd never been the one who watched him live out his human life as a fucking Gas’n’Sip worker.
“Nothing, uh, I was about to ask you if, uh, if you finished reading the book, erm, I gave you?”
Castiel's eyes widen at Dean's answer, and he pulls away a bit, mostly in awe as he studies Dean's face. The gleaming of his vivid green eyes, the smile at his lips, the thick, coarse skin of the scar running down his face. He feels at peace, more connected to Dean, more than he's ever been before.
"Oh, but those panties you're wearing under that skirt aren't?"
"I promise," he whispered after a beat, and Dean smiled, setting him down and stealing a kiss from his lips. Castiel smiled, not pulling away, rather staying in Dean's arms for a little while longer.
All Dean can do at that moment is rub a soothing hand over Castiel's hair, and tuck him closer to Dean, so that's what he does.
and lifestyle
He bit down on the fabric of his shirt as Dean's large, veined hands slid up his chest, sending shivers down each nerve in Castiel's body. His thick, long fingers pressed into one of Castiel's perky, stiff nipples, and toyed with the bud, squeezing it and pulling it, before Dean ducked down, his eyes glinting red before changing back to green, as he wrapped his tongue around a dusky nipple.
"Ha Ha." he grumbles and rolls his eyes at the way she grins.
The maid outfit was rumpled all over. Castiel's skirt tented with his erection poking the fabric, the stockings had rolled down slightly, the buttons had been undone and the blouse fell open, revealing his bare, creamy chest to Dean, and the strap of the apron had fallen around Castiel's arms.
"Stupid. So stupid," he mutters, and in a heartbeat, Dean's lips are on his. The kiss is brief, but it lingers on Castiel's lips, and all the while, Castiel can think of nothing but the fact that Dean is here. That he's standing here in Castiel's arms, despite the fact that he
"Shit, that's fucking delicious. I could fucking live on this," he rasped, and Castiel in turn, only bucked his hips backwards so they brushed against Dean's cock.
"That's not nice, omega, now I have to clean it," he growled, and without a moment's hesitation, brought his hand to his lips to lick every last drop of come off his hand. Castiel watched, absolutely appalled at the lewd scene in front of him, and was it not for his orgasm just about a few seconds ago, he might have come again.
“Felicity? I did, should I give it back tonight?”
"Go on, fuck, Dean, make me come, oh god, I need it, need you to fuck me with your tongue so fucking hard,
A hand travels across Dean's neck and cradles his jaw.
A smile spread across Dean's face. A smile Castiel have never before envied so much.
"I saw something hit you. Are you sure you're okay?"
Dean smiles.
"Mr. Green, go to sleep, please? I can practically
A sigh drifts over from across the wall, before Castiel hears a soft chuckle.
Dean sighs and dusts off his hands, wiping them on his trousers before walking into the living room to grab his discarded shirt. It's December already, and sure it's cold outside, but Dean would rather freeze from hypothermia than walk around his house in a shirt. The threadbare, gray shirt lies on the couch, and right as he flings it over his shoulder, a knock raps against the wall. He turns to the sound, nerves trembling with anticipation at the prospect of listening to Castiel's voice.
Silence meets Rowena's words.
"I've been meaning to buy Mary Oliver's collections. I've heard they're one of the world's best."
"Hey, Cas, what's wrong?"
"Oh god, yes. I think everyone in a radius of ten metres is going to have to wear some heavy-duty ear plugs— unless they want to hear a bunch of kids play the violin as brashly as possible."
"Eno—enochian spellwork," Castiel hissed, knowing once he answered Dean, the reward would be mighty. And as expected, Dean's thick fingers returned around Castiel's cock— massaging and stroking firmly, pushing Castiel closer and closer to the edge of his orgasm. Right when he thought Dean would let him climax, the fingers fell away and Castiel let out a cry, his lips now curling into a pout as he sobbed, and tried to squeeze his thighs shut, but to no avail.
"I said put it back."
"'Kay."
"Good boy," Dean hummed, and at once, his hands were gentle where they cradled Castiel's jaw, and a soft kiss pressed against Castiel's forehead. The fingers on his nipples returned, delicate and insistent, as they massaged Castiel's nipples, squeezed them and pressed them, all tenderly, and Castiel felt himself float closer and closer to ecstacy. His cock leaked thin, clear pre-come, and his hole quivered with the need to be touched.
“Fine. Fine. You want me to forget you, right? I won't wait for you to leave; I'll start right away."
Dean grinned, touching the back of Castiel's waist to guide him towards the front of the record store as they spoke.
"Fuck," Castiel moans out, his voice breathy and exasperated as he squeezes his shut eyes. His eyebrows furrow as he leans his head to the side to give Dean enough leeway to assault Castiel's neck with his lips.
"I can play the keys, if you want," he offers.
"Are you ashamed of it? You don't have to be, Green."
That's what his body needed.
"My pretty little kitten, what a sweet hole you've got. So hungry and wet for me, is that what I do to you? Make you so wet your tiny cunt starts dripping for me?"
Castiel makes a face, sticking his tongue out at Jack
With a scoff, and an incredulous shake of the head, Castiel smiles.
"Dean, you think you don't deserve this?"
"And?"
"Hmm."
"If ya' follow me for a minute, I could show you the bedroom. But please feel free to use any room you'd like. After-all, yer' gonna' be living here for a while. The house's yours."
"Oh? Are you saying that as people who live right next door, we'll never once see each other?"
Fifteen minutes from now, they'll be standing by their apartment building.
"Your father? What did he do?"
"Oh, uh, my apologies if I'm prying, you just mentioned it earlier, and I thought it had something to do with me, since I play some music at night before I go to work."
"Oh," Castiel croaked out.
He knocks, loud and resounding, the enthusiasm under his skin thrumming as he heaves a breath, bouncing his leg against the wall as his eyes roam the expanse of the accent wallpaper. A few minutes later, the sound of shuffling, accompanied by slight thuds from across the wall float over and a soft, joyous voice greets him.
Silence fell upon them once again, and Castiel wondered if Dean wanted to say something more, perhaps sing more praises and hymns in the name of Lisa, or perhaps he wanted to leave this conversation, leave Castiel and the awkwardness between them. Perhaps he did. Perhaps he always had wanted to get Castiel off his back. Perhaps he was enjoying his time without Castiel.
Dean halts for a moment, everything disappearing as if at the click of a finger, and he questions, for the first time in years, if what Blue says is true.
"Mm, you smell good," Dean mumbled into the crook of Castiel's bare neck, and for a second, felt the man under him squirm.
every time he wakes up, hear him say ‘
Castiel balances himself on the step-ladder, eyebrows furrowed in deep concentration as he glides the paint-dipped flat brush across the bare white wall in measured swipes, careful to paint in only one motion. He rubs his sweaty forehead on the back of his palm, engrossed in the sheer action of painting the wall as perfectly as possible, when at once, the step-ladder shakes with a thundering tremble, and Castiel's eyes go wide as he glances back—
Dean hates how he has found himself a new addiction, the taste of Castiel’s lips. Castiel is rocking in his arms, enthusiastic and keen, threading his fingers through Dean's hair, tugging at the short, spiky hair at his nape, enough for their kisses to be passionate, desperate, but never wandering farther than the borders of demanding. Their hands settle at modest places on each other's bodies, and it isn't until the elevator dings, its rusty metal doors grinding open, that Dean pulls away, his mind hazy, his lips tingling, and his hands grabbing at any and every expanse of Castiel's body as they tumble out of the elevator.
Castiel laughs and walks over to down the remnants of his coffee.
"Dean, are you
"Nope."
Dean brings his hand up and raps against the door, once again, thrice in a row, and louder.
"I was going to tell you I need to leave soon."
"I'm calling Rowena."
With Dean's cold, green eyes staring into his own, drawing him in and yet, pushing him away, Castiel realised something.
his cock twitched at the thought,
He sighs and rolls over on his bed, his eyes cloudy and head thrumming with an oncoming migraine.
Castiel's heart skips a beat as he glances down at the delivery time. Oh? It's only been about ten minutes since the message was sent? Why did it take Green so long to text him? His eyebrows draw together and a frown graces his lips as he taps away at the keyboard.
What Dean sees, is by far, the most pained face on a man, he has ever seen.
"Because patience, my boy, is what matters. There are things you think you can't have, but don't worry. The world isn't as unfair as you think it is, especially not to lovers."
"Please."
Dean pauses.
"And how is it going?" Castiel follows up. He's found being friends with Mr. Kreschner does put him at a bit of an advantage when he's got issues with the rent.
"Didn't hear you sing tonight."
"Please don't."
Just at the mere thought of Castiel's words, Dean feels the pressure in his gut recoiling and simmering, booming through his gut before ripping through his body, and he comes, thick, hot semen flooding Castiel's tight, virgin hole, as Castiel cries out, and goes almost limp in Dean's arms.
About seven to eight performances later, Jack is playing the tune quite well. The tone, although a bit sharp to the ear, has improved quite a bit from the moment they began. Castiel makes a mental note to teach him about better body language in the next session, for they only have about ten minutes left now, and these ten minutes are simply for a cool down. Castiel believes excessive practice tends to warp one’s judgement. The larger the breaks one takes, the better one is able to listen to music with a different perspective each time. He follows the same principle for his own practice.
When Dean turns back to Castiel, he half expects the angel to be sullen, to be disgusted, to be– anything but glad. However, the look on Castiel's face is that of partial confusion, of blank amusement, as if he thinks Dean is playing some stupid, cosmic joke with him.
"It's Sunday," Castiel whispers, "-you have to leave."
so much love, and I can’t begin to tell you how unworthy I am of it. I can’t make you happy, Cas, trust me. I can’t give you what you need. You want someone who can help you up when you fall, and Cas, I
After the third of December, Castiel hadn't been able to look Dean in the eye again. No, he couldn't, he simply couldn't. Because if he did, he was scared of what he'd see. He'd see Dean falling for Lisa, see how he smiled at Lisa, see how his eyes lit up when he was talking to her, see how everyday, Lisa became what Castiel used to be to him. And he couldn't take it. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday— Castiel had walked to school himself. He'd leave early, before Dean would drop by his house with the Impala, and he'd left it to Gabriel to tell Dean that Castiel had left already. At school, he'd try his best to avoid Dean's eyes, to steer clear of the tables at the cafeteria Dean sat at, to avoid crossing his path when they met in the hallways.
Hesitantly, he holds his hand out behind his back.
"Who said you'd get my cock, bitch?"
"I love you."
"Check your doorstep."
But these days.
"And it's not just that," Blue sighs, “It's my own personal journal. If I'm sad, my music is sad, if I'm happy, my music is happy. Like a thirteen-year old girl with a diary—but in my case, it's my music."
I want to see you. Please. Now."
Dean, I just..." Castiel breathes in a deep gasp, eyes spilling a tear as he reaches back to hold onto the counter, trying to steady himself as another tear rolls down his face. "
, or ‘
"Stop staring at me, you're making me self-conscious."
"Nice try, you sonuvabitch, but see, I ain't jealous of Sam. I'm proud of him—"
"It's just that," Sam sighs, "
"I guess…" comes the bleak reply from across, and Castiel dims at the sound of the words.
the wind felt. As if it wanted to speak. As if it wanted to scream. But it couldn't, it had no lungs, no throat, no mouth— but it wanted to make itself known. And Castiel wanted to know. What did it want to say? Was it for Castiel? Did he need to know? What was it about? Was it about the house? What about the hou—
"I'm sorry, Cas," he hiccups, and before he can speak any further, Castiel's hands frame his face, pulling him up until Dean's face is only an inch from Castiel's. He watches as deep, round blue eyes flicker over his face, from his lips to his eyes, to the lines on his forehead, to the dimple at his mouth.
"Did it end?"
"Yeah," Dean says, but his words sound hollow. Meaningless.
Just four words.
For the first time in weeks, Castiel felt butterflies flutter inside his stomach with excitement.
," Green starts, and
"'Course I do."
"Ah, I remember. And yes, I would love some coffee right now."
"Mr.Green?"
"What
"I can't come. Just enjoy your Christmas, Dean."
bed. That's not a nice thing to do, is it, Cas?"
"When do you leave?"
Castiel laughs, and in that moment, Dean decides Castiel's laughter, by far, despite the exquisite piece of music he heard seconds ago, has to be the most beautiful sound he has ever heard.
"I don't want to live my life running from people, Cas."
"Mhm."
His blue eyes blur with unshed tears, and all Dean wants to do is bury himself in Castiel's arms, hold him, soothe him, tell him they're going to be alright. He finds himself shaken by the sudden onslaught of emotions he feels, but he stays put, standing his ground and meeting Castiel's teary eyes, although it stings him to watch Castiel teetering on the edge of a breakdown.
"Thought I made it clear with the note."
"Dean," he breathes the word in as if it were the very air above him.
"Dean," he states, heart leaping at the sound of Dean's voice after so many hours apart.
Let’s hear it then. I would
He sits up, rubbing at his eyes.
The smile on Dean's face falters. His dim, dismal green eyes, not the ones Castiel had seen the night before, filled with adoration and affection, wander down Castiel's face, to his mouth, and with the softest touch, Dean brushes his thumb over Castiel's lip.
or at least Castiel hoped they would.
"Maybe,” Blue says. “So, how are you?"
A hopeful tone laces Castiel's words as he voices his suggestion to Dean.
"Love hurts," Mr. Kreschner starts.
It's a vague statement, Dean knows. It could be his calls from across the wall, or it could be his phone calls, but Dean doesn't find it in himself to want to elaborate.
"Hey, Cas, sweetheart," Dean whispered, cupping a hand over Castiel's jaw and urging him to look up. Castiel sniffled, eyes tinged with a glassy sheen of tears, and met Dean's bright, gentle eyes, "-you're here, I'm already living my dream. So don't you think I need anything else, kay'?" He flicked Castiel's nose, which Castiel guessed must have been red, and Castiel swatted his hand away with a fond smile, only for Dean to chuckle in his face.
immerse him.
"Green? Are you there?"
cares for, is his potential partner speaks, what they say, how they treat everybody around them. Needless to say, Castiel has high expectations from a partner. In essence, they need to be Castiel's friend before he would ever consider them as a lover.
"I do have a sense of humour, you simply don't understand it."
Castiel smiles, tucking his hands behind him as he rests his head against the wall, a warmth creeping across his cheeks, up to the tip of his nose at the words.  "Thank you, that's very sweet of you to say."
"Do you think she's ready?" Castiel asked, as he stared down at the soft, squishy ray of sunshine snoring in his arms, with its wavy blond hair swept across it's face. Beside him, Dean sighed, and yet, a smile lingered at his face. One hand on the steering wheel, the other on reaching out to steal Castiel's hand into his own, Dean turned to his side to meet his husband's eyes.
Dean asks, as playful as Castiel.
It sounds so brash, so meaningless, when he says it out as such. Dean's head falls back against the wall as he heaves a sigh.
"Aw, what?"
"I like older men," Castiel whispers, and shrugs with an air of nonchalance, eyes twinkling with mischief.
The words Blue utters drift Dean into memory, and he shuts his eyes, letting his head fall back against the wall...
, anything you
One of Dean's hand retreats from Castiel's hips to guide his cock into Cas's tight, wet hole, sticky with lube coating the cheeks, and at once, Dean watches Castiel feel it— the excruciating burn of something big breaching him, and he cries out Dean's name as Dean's thick cock slides inside him, inch by inch, forcing his hole to stretch around it. He feels a mixture of pain and bliss coursing through him, Dean supposes. He's been in his shoes before, and hey, let's say he's seen better days, but with the tears stinging the rims of Castiel's eyes, Dean decides to pause for a few seconds, and let Cas adjust to the sensation.
"Dean, please—" Castiel found himself begging, before clenching his asshole and feeling his body rock upwards as Dean thrust the hilt faster, rougher, harder. Castiel tried to resist, tried to push it out, but Dean wrapped a hand around his neck and squeezed tight enough for Castiel to see white as the painful intrusion in his ass continued. Tears streamed down his face and his lips trembled as he flailed around in the ropes tying him, feeling the hilt of the Blade stretch him open and plunge into him. His flesh seemed to tear and rupture with every thrust, but Castiel was helpless as he cried out and begged for air.
What if he... No. No, that would be too forward.
"Why not?"
"Lately, your highnes—,"
Dean planted his hands on the marble counter on either side of Castiel's hips as he thrusted in, as deep as he could physically get. Around his cock, Castiel's wet, heated flesh opened up, swallowing him in inch by inch, and Dean felt himself slip into a trance where he could comprehend nothing but Castiel.
"You know, all this time, people kept blaming the circumstances I was in. They blamed my seniors, they blamed the times, they blamed everyone but me, trying not to burden me with their opinions. Never once did I expect a stranger to put me on the spot and tell me, maybe not to my face, but nevertheless, about the blame being my own."
"Yes! Yes, master— please— I want master's cock in my hole—"
The Prince's finger thrusts into his ass, and Dean watches as he plays with himself, feeling the digit around in his hole, curving and crooking his finger, pressing the finger into the walls inside his hole. Arousal courses through Dean's body as he crawls upon the bed and kneels behind his highness, until his cock brushes against the prince's, tight, young chaste hole.
Now that seemed to take Castiel aback, and he paused, feet coming to an abrupt halt as he stared ahead at the alpha, his eyes green and inviting, and Castiel felt himself flush under the alpha's insistent gaze.
"I'll say it, alright?” Castiel says. “-You know why? 'Cause right now, I'm not scared. I don't give a damn about repressed feelings, about what's wrong or what's right. All I know is that you're here and I'm here, and I love you,” His voice breaks, only spurring the ache in Dean’s chest, “-and I'm going to lose you tomorrow."
An array of emotions course through Dean's veins. Guilt. Shame. Embarrassment. Penitence.
Castiel shrugs, and turns away, letting his hands fall from his chest as he stares down at some mundane part of the wall. Beside him, Dean steps closer, the scent of soap mingled with the faint trace of Dean's cologne encompassing him. Soft hands slip under Castiel's arms, pulling him close to Dean's chest, and a shaky sigh slips past his lips as he presses his cheek against Dean's pecs, a shudder wracking his body, as he tightens his arms around Dean.
His eyes shut and he continues with a soft sigh, "Oh, my apologies. As I said, I'm not quite well-versed with rock music, although I admit, it really riles you up when you listen to it."
"Yeah, Cas,” Dean whispers, his hands bracing the side of Castiel's face as he smiles, his tears rolling down the curve of his lips. “-‘m staying here with you. Forever, as long as you'll have me."
"Ugh."
"Oh, of course not. I walked here anyway."
A third finger pumped in, and Castiel almost saw white.
"Mr.Green?" Castiel asks, hesitant but curious.
"Baby," Castiel moans, reaching up to press his hand over Dean's jaw, turning his head to the side until they're facing each other. Dean's eyes twinkle with prominent need and want, and Castiel's are no different. He pauses for a moment, simply drinking in the sight of his husband, before diving in for a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss. The air thickens with the sound of their moans and whimpers, as Dean continues to pump his hand around Castiel's cock, jacking him off right there on the floor, in the middle of their new, empty, bare house— but theirs nonetheless.
"Oh, you angel." Dean sighs, and plops himself down on his couch, crossing his leg over the other as he sprawls back.
Castiel shoved his tongue into his cheek, biting on his lip to hold back another round of tears as he averted his gaze, keeping it fixed to the floor, while silence crept between them, strange, off-putting, distant.
"When will you be back?"
"I'm not making fun of you."
"To love someone is to tread through thick snow, for even though you might not look back, your footsteps will always leave a mark."
"Thank you Benny, I think Benjamin is a sweet name as well."
Castiel doesn't mean to eavesdrop, but Dean isn't moving away from him either, so Castiel supposes he doesn't mind Castiel's presence.
"So...? Are you sure?" Castiel asked. If Dean was telling the truth, which somehow he looked like he did, that meant Dean was Castiel's—
Large, empty corridors extended into the corners of the foyer they were standing upon, and Castiel caught glimpses of strong, brown doors in every corridor. Standing before them, was an enormous flight of stairs opening up into the second storey of the manor. Above the stairs, Castiel could see a few more doors, and two other corridors extending into the sides of the staircase. As he twirled around in place, eyes trailing upon every minuscule detail in the house, he found himself strangely unable to tear his gaze away.
The moment Castiel leans against the railing, memories come to mind from the night before, memories of Dean's weight against him, their lips eager and desperate, the moans that had escaped Castiel's mouth. He flushes red now, swallowing down a lump at the back of his throat. He wonders in the back of his mind if Dean, like Castiel, is thinking of the same. He glances over at Dean, who meets his wide eyes before averting his gaze with a slight blush. Well. There's the answer.
His steps falter, and he feels his chest constrict, breath restricted as he grabs hold of the trunk of a tree next to him, and leans back against it, lips trembling with each sob that wracks his body.
Castiel surged forward and shut him up with a kiss.
"God, of course,
Before Castiel can turn with his angel blade gripped tight in his hand, Dean is on his feet sprinting over to push Castiel away. Something small, but powerful, gushes into his back and out, as if right through him, and he turns— his sight snapping over to the witch in front of them as her purple eyes glow with sheer fury.
Of course, Dean cracks a joke.
"Whatcha' cookin'?" Blue pauses for a moment, and Dean hears the clinking of plates.
"Give me the violin," he says, and holds his hands out. Jack sets the instrument down into his hands, and Castiel steps in front of the stand, although he doesn’t quite need the sheet music.
"Oh,” Dean says suddenly as they step out of the elevator, “-this is good, this is good, you haven't met Baby yet, have you?"
"I don't give a shit, okay? Cut the crap. Remember Jack? The nephilim?
Until he stood right before the door, his hand inches away from the door knob.
"Ramble On."
"I'm right where I need to be."
Dean moans, and Castiel lets himself loose, flowing and drifting with the kiss, wherever it takes him, as he drinks in the taste of neat whiskey, paired with that of Dean's lips, and he's sure somewhere in there are tears. His hands cradle Dean's face, and Dean's settle at his hips.
Everything was the way it always had been. Ordinary.
"No, I've never listened to podcasts before. Although my brother listens to quite a lot of them. Mostly about health
"–and we're going to get him back to normal. And I know it's hard for you, more than any of us here, because we've lost Cas before, and I know how much of a toll it takes on you, but please, for Cas' sake, stay calm. We can't get into this with a troubled mind, alright?"
"I'm sorry."
cock? Would you like that?"
"I erm, I got your gift too. I was going to give it to mom, but she told me to give it to you myself."
Sighing, Castiel puts his wallet away, but not before grumbling about it. They slide out of the booth and turn towards the glass door. A few long moments later, they're seated in Dean's car without surprisingly, having spoken in the past few minutes. Of course, the silence isn't as torturous as it had been a few days ago, but it does itch under Castiel's skin.
A sob rises at the back of Dean's throat, and Castiel can see the way his lips tremble, eyes leaking tear after tear, as his wide green eyes stare right into Castiel's eyes.
A pause lingers in the air.
At once, the fantasy dissipates into thin air, and Castiel blinks his eyes open. Silence ensues around him until he reminds himself Green is waiting for him.
"This reminds me of a quote."
"Y— yes?" Castiel asks, just as breathless as Dean as he reaches up to cradle Dean's face in his palm, turning his head until their faces are inches away.
you, makes you
Bacon. Do you have bacon?"
"There was this picture frame in our house, y'know," He swallows, “-on the shelf above the fireplace. Me, Sam, mom and dad. My mom was beautiful. Blonde hair that framed her face so perfectly. Beautiful eyes, a big, wide smile when she laughed. You know, it was one of those rare pictures where my dad was smiling wide and open. I remember very clearly the moment we took it. Dad just came home for the first time in three years. He was in his uniform. He got me this little wooden toy he found at a local shop in Iraq. And I was about eight, Sam was four, and I was thinking, I don't think I'll ever be this happy again. My mother asked some stranger at the airport to click it for us."
"Hmm, it's debatable," he chides, voice high and squeaky as he makes fun of Dean. Dean sends him a look, and Castiel snorts, basking in the ease between them. Somehow, being with Dean always makes him calm. He feels no need to hide who he is. He can be what he wants, say what he wants, do as he please, and he knows there is no judgement. Dean is always on the same page, and being with him flows through Castiel without any uncertainty.
"Oh?" Castiel asked, scrunching his eyebrows together as he studied the alpha.
Somehow, Dean likes this man. Dean doesn't know much about him, but he likes him. And hey, he can work with that.
"What?"
"But it's not enough."
Castiel chuckles, nosing against Dean's neck as he hums and feels Dean's hand snake over his thigh.
of Cas. Dean was furious and it was all Castiel's fault.
Dean groaned, and felt himself orgasm at last, stronger than he ever had before, as load after load of semen filled Castiel's ass. For a moment, Dean felt Castiel's hand reach for his, and he broke their kiss, watching as Castiel gripped Dean's hand and pressed it over his lower stomach, near his gut.
"Dean," An exasperated groan accompanies the sound of Dean's name, and at once, Dean turns to Castiel, who Dean discovers now, is shivering, and to his anguish, Castiel groans, his weak, pliant body curling into itself as tears roll down his face.
"Eleven in the morning.”
Does Green not want to talk to him?
Dean looks up at Castiel, blinking through his tears as he leans in for a kiss, but Castiel holds his hand up to stop him, and Dean glances up at Castiel's eyes.
, Dean realizes, just how far gone he is. Gone, no point of return. He's fallen, and he's fallen so deep, he can't see anything but Castiel.
Dean's voice is wet. It's quiet. And it churns inside Castiel's gut, sending a searing pain right through his chest as he weeps—not cries— weeps against Dean's chest.
"This can't be– this can't be right–"
Dean nudges the chair away from the table and pushes himself to his feet as he scours through one of his bags for a lighter. He grabs the slip of paper and his old, yellow lighter, and walks to the kitchen. The rim of his eyes burns with every falling teardrop, and he folds the paper in half, holds up an edge to the sink, and flicks his thumb over the lighter. He watches as the spark lights up and then he holds the flame to the paper.
And there he was. Dean. With Lisa, at that.
Dean's hand hovers before Castiel's face, and he stares down at Castiel with an expectant look in his eyes.
"What? Have you never seen a cock before?" Dean growled, impatience dripping from his words, and Castiel blinked out of his haze, glancing up at Dean with a flushed expression on his face.
"Wait, you're not even forty? I'm sorry, you see, your voice sounds quite mature."
"You should be, you fucking asshole."
An angel of the Lord, a warrior of heaven, a Seraphim, a leader, a fighter, a merciless soldier— tied up in a demon's warehouse like a piece of fresh meat.
"Call me when you get home. Or when you take a break."
, he wants to go home. He wants to go home, bury himself under the comforter and cry. Wants to grab a bottle of beer and down it until he can't feel a thing. Until he's numb. He's never felt this urge before, the urge to ruin himself, even if it's for a few seconds, but now that Dean's gone, things don't fit into place anymore. Bees aren't cute, kittens aren't adorable, pie tastes disgusting, and rock music is trash.
"Well, that's obviously not a bad thing. You wanna’ share why you’re feeling so upbeat?"
He sucks in a breath and digs the book out of the jam-packed shelf, turning his face away when a puff of dust flows from the book cover. He flips through the browning pages of the book. It's been years since he bought this one. Or did he borrow it from a library and forget to return it? Who knows?
"Why do you think so, Cas?"
Dean doesn't say anything else, and Castiel takes that as an indication to shuffle closer to him, to press against his chest, and absorb the warmth he exudes. Castiel shuts his eyes and allows himself to be held. Dean's arm, long and broad, wraps around his back to settle at his waist, and Castiel sniffles, trying to suppress his sobs.
"You see that?" Dean asked, his eyes dropping down to his cock.
A cheeky smile spread across Dean's face, and Castiel shoved him by the shoulder, giving out an amused groan at the flirtation. And yet, he found himself unable to fight the heat thrumming under his skin.
Castiel doesn't know why Dean insists on calling him so. It is a cute nickname, no doubt, although Castiel doesn't see the problem with his full name.
A flurry of images zooms past the window where Castiel gazes out. Lights— red, green, blue, yellow; and buildings— small, big, short, tall— all pass by in a haze, as if in a film roll. That is when Castiel realizes,
"Would you like to?"
A laugh slips past Castiel's lips for he finds the statement rather silly.
He was practically
Three months. It's been three months since Dean visited him. The last time he visited, he'd spent the day with Sam and Castiel, playing a board game Castiel had bought once, playing cards, talking, laughing, bonding. The night though, Dean's nights were always reserved for Castiel.
"Because if you have been, Green, you need to let it go."
"You know what, I surrender. Mint chocolate it is." He laughs for a few seconds, before continuing, "Jeez, I feel like a kid high on dopamine."
Before Dean knows it, the fingers on his lips have been replaced with Castiel's eager lips, and Dean lets his eyes flutter shut as Castiel swallows him in, tongue licking ardently at every corner and curve of Dean's mouth, and his hands, curious and exploring, travel up Dean's bare chest, palms grinding into Dean's nipple and prompting him to let out a rumbling moan inside Castiel's mouth. Unable to keep his hands to himself, Dean slides his arms under Castiel's shirt, but this time, he pulls it right over his head and tosses it aside, allowing himself to feel the press of Castiel's naked chest against his own, and as exciting as it feels, Dean needs more of it. More naked skin, more grinding, more rubbing, more sweat, more noise— he needs everything Castiel can give him.
Dean's eyes drop down to Kreschner, who claps him on the shoulder once before turning and meeting Castiel's eyes. Castiel's breath hitches. How does he even know where Castiel is? Has he been watching him the whole time? He walks with his cane and limps over to where Castiel is standing, but Castiel couldn't care less as he watches Dean send him a smile, a sad, broken smile, before slipping into his car.
"Eh, it's nothing compared to the stuff you make for me."
"My voice does not go high?!" Castiel all but yells out, eyes wide with offence.
He rolls over in his bed, grabs a pillow, and groans into it.
"Dean."
Castiel's hand settles once again on Dean's shoulder, and at this point, with Castiel so close to him, the realization has sunk deep into his bones. He had always wanted his first glimpse of Castiel to be monumental, but nothing, nothing can top this.
"Dean."
"The door—" He swallowed, eyes flickering from the room towards Mildred as uncertainty spread across his body, "—it was unlocked, right now. I heard it click open. And I was just about to open it when you—"
"We'll make it work tonight, okay? We still have some time. Come on, stop crying, Cas, you're strong, aren't you, sweetheart? C'mon."
who shouldn't be affected by humane things, to be down with a fever— to be burning up, body searing with heat, to be in such agonizing pain. Dean needs an answer. And for an answer, Castiel is his only hope.
Dean hates fighting with his brother, especially when they’re talking for the first time in months.
Dean snorts and shakes his head, grinning with a mellow mirth.
"Mornin' sunshine," he teases, leaning against the wall, folding his arms across his chest.
Castiel groaned at Dean's teasing words, and yet, found himself unable to wipe the loopy grin off his face.
a pie for me. Wait, is it something special today? Am I forgetting something?"
"I'm sorry I couldn't be brave enough. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you when you needed it the most. Cas— I'm— I'm so sorry—" he sobs, unbothered of how petulant he sounds or feels, because right now, it's all he can do— let himself fall apart in Castiel's arms. But he knows Castiel will put him together. He always has.
"Mmhm. This is good, this is good,” Green laughs, his voice low and hoarse, sending a shiver down Castiel’s spine, “-I like hearing you all flustered, y'know, 'cause your voice goes kinda’ high and it's hilarious."
Obstructed by a long, wide, black sheer curtain, stands a large bed in the far back of the chambers. A few candles lit in the corner of the room are the only source of illumination, and they drench the room in a soft, yellow glow. Lying atop the bed, dressed in nothing but a sky-blue silk robe, is his highness, Prince Castiel. In his hands, he holds a rose, twirling it between his fingers and picking at its crimson petals, dragging his finger down the stem, unbothered by the thorns sitting the green stalk.
"What about it?" Dean tries to prompt Sam, who has gone strangely quiet.
"I guess ‘Stairway to Heaven,’ the most popular one in my opinion. I've heard ‘Traveling Riverside Blues,’ ‘Ramble Off,’ or something similar."
So, with a hesitant hand, Dean reaches up and knocks. Once, twice, thrice.
Rowena laughs, flicking a streak of red hair behind her shoulder as she grins, and takes a sip of her whiskey.
"Take, for example, a normal spell– let's say, I curse you with a degenerative spell. If it's a normal spell, it will affect you, and
Dean, whose voice sounds like a beautiful Sunday evening with a mug of hot cocoa, whose laugh, contagious to say the least, is always hearty and rich, no matter how mundane a situation may be. Dean, who struggles to understand himself, but makes an effort with Castiel's advice. Dean, who leaves books for Castiel to read at his door, only asking for apple pie in return. Dean, who falls asleep at times, in the midst of their conversation, making Castiel chuckle and give a fond roll of his eyes before ringing him up and urging him to get to bed. Dean, who leaves little chocolates in the containers he returns to Castiel after dinner.
"You can change things if you want. But you're too scared to," Castiel whispers, his lips ghosting over Dean's ears as he wraps his arms tight around Dean.
"Okay," he says firmly and with emphasis, "-for starters, I'm eight years older than you, Cas.
It's comical, really, how Castiel's eyes widen, how his mouth hangs open, how Dean can see the gears shifting in his brain. His chest heaves with deep breaths, and his eyes study Dean's face, dropping down momentarily to rake over his body before drifting back up, and a single, hoarse word escapes his lips.
"I ain't here for a long time, Blue. I need you to remember me as
"Hello Dean."
Castiel whimpered, and hid his face in the depths of Dean's neck, chest heaving with loud pants as Castiel struggled to regain his breath. Dean's hand ran up and down his back, rocking him gently and kissing his forehead as he coaxed Castiel with soft shusshes.
Green laughs and Castiel feels his face flush with heat.
“Green?” Dean blinks, the sound of the word drawing him out a stupor he never realized he slipped into, and he wonders how long he’s been silent for.
It has been a year since he returned from his active duty overseas. Being a Marine Corp, the reputation, the respect, the treatment? It's all aces. People love you. They respect you. But the mental toll of it is something a soldier can only share with another soldier. Even if you're not in the midst of a war, the conditions you find yourself in during duty are much alike. And Dean? He’s lived through fifteen years of it. Fifteen years of service. Dean recalls a young, twenty-one-year-old boy clad for the first time in the signature tan combat uniform. For the world, it was the mark of a soldier, for Dean, the crux of his existence.
Castiel turns to the wall, unable to find the right words to express his... his... surprise? He's not quite surprised by the man saying he reads. A lot of people are avid readers. He finds himself struck by the ease with which the man finishes his sentence, the certainty in his voice. "I... So do I... And well, not to digress from what you said, but it's true. I'd prefer thoughtful conversations over idle chat any day."
It's as if Castiel realizes
So, this is what he has been missing out on these past several weeks. Part of him does enjoy their moments spent in anonymity, but another part of him, seeing Castiel move so seamlessly in the kitchen, yearns to spend more time with him like this, to hold him, wrap his hands around his firm, warm body, to kiss the soft skin at his neck, to be the only one to make Castiel laugh, to make him smile, and
On the window is a little scrap of chipping paint- Castiel slips his thumb under, fiddling with it as he speaks.
however, had been on Friday.
Dean doesn't answer him, only spurring Castiel's tears on, and he presses a hand to the wall, face damp and skin feverish.
"Yeah, s'my fault."
It's not a memory, Castiel realises. It's a fantasy.
"The kiss of death? What does it do?" Castiel asks, and Dean notices him sitting up, leaning over Dean's shoulder.
Castiel sucks in a shaky breath, biting on the inside of his lips to refrain a loud sob he feels rising at the back of his throat, and it dissipates into a helpless sigh as he clutches onto Dean's jacket, eyes falling to a loose thread at the hem.
“What?” Dean’s voice is softer now.
Sharp. Cold. Electrifying.
A considerate silence follows, before Dean hears Castiel hum.
"Yes," Castiel calls out. Right as he's slipping his white sneakers on, his eye catches something bundled up against the sofa in the living room. As he walks further to inspect it, he finds it's—
"A deterioration spell."
ringing through Dean's mind on repeat.
"Green. Your father,
The lights in the dark room flip on, and Dean is astonished by the elements of the room, standing out at different points. As if on instinct, his eyes first drift over to the wall they share, and instead of the bareness Dean has been staring at these past months, Castiel has a beautiful accent wallpaper covering the entirety of the wall. He quirks his lip up in an impressed notion, eyes skimming over the long three-seater sofa, the television screen across it, a peculiar stand
"Orpheus? History? What does that mean?"
"Not my fault you're an idiot," Castiel teased, pressing his head against Dean's cheek as they found their voices again.
? Fuck.
"Out of the three of us, she is, much more than we ever could be," he assured, and brought his hand up to brush it through the mess of blond hair at Castiel's shoulder. Castiel chuckled. Sleeping sound in his arms, snuggled tight and tired almost from laughing all day, was Jack.
"— and nothing you say about him or me is going to break me. So we can do this the easy way. You give Castiel back to me, or I tear down the Empty and take him back
"Did he hit you?" Dean laughs.
"Totally."
Dean sighs and fixes him with a look before sliding his hands over Castiel's thigh.
"Wait, so what exactly are you getting at?" Sam asks, and Rowena sends him a grin, before turning to Dean.
happens to be an angel Dean cares for and trusts deeply, and who hasn't been acting normal lately, he isn't above entering his room uninvited. Beneath his fingers, the doorknob twists with a soft click, and he pushes the door open, inch by inch, with a low, creaking sound, and slips his head inside the room.
“I said,” Dean raises his voice, “
"Then mine does too, prince."
"Oh?" Castiel raised an eyebrow, already excited, "-could I come meet her sometime then? I expected to be quite alone while Dean was at work, but it seems there could be someone I could befriend."
"Maybe. Maybe you're not as pretty, maybe you've got a weird, Rudolph-like red nose right now," Dean mused, pinching Castiel's nose, and Castiel swatted at his hand, "-and weird, messy hair," Dean continued, poking at Castiel's hair, earning himself a glare, "-and you're taller, bigger, stronger than any of them, but it never mattered."
It's as if every single word Castiel has said this past hour, echoes through Dean's mind, over and over again.
The sound of polished leather boots clacking against the tiles filled the room as Dean stalked over to the bed. Castiel swallowed thickly, unable to move, overcome with guilt, regret, shame, arousal and anger.
"Awh, ain't you a charmer."
As Castiel enters the compound of his apartment building, he finds sitting idle on a bench nearby, Mr. Kreschner, the very man Dean had mentioned this morning, and who originally owned the flats Dean and Castiel live in.
"I can't wait to dig in, buddy. I mean it, I don't remember the last time someone
"Lisa's gone," Dean said, his voice unwavering, and the affirmation in his words had Castiel turning up to face him at last, but the moment he did, Castiel found himself sucking in a breath, preparing himself to meet Dean's eye, nibbling on the insides of his cheek to steady his loud, beating heart which seemed to have travel up to his head from his chest. The distance between them was close to nothing, and a few mere inches stood between them. Castiel could distinguish the scent of Dean's cologne, even out of the hundreds of smells in the room, Dean's cologne always found it's way to Castiel's senses. Their breaths mingled in the air between them, and Dean squeezed Castiel's hand.
. And he hates small talk. Dean finds himself liking his unique conversations with Blue. Maybe it’s worth a shot.
"Dean," Castiel starts, stern now, evidently frustrated, as he squeezes Dean in his arms, "-I don't know. I've been feeling different these days. Powerless. Weak. I couldn't stay awake last night, and it was strange, because I- because I- because I'm an angel, I don't, I don't, I don't need sleep. And then I woke up a while ago, I can't move— I can't move, I can't– It hurts." A sob slips past Castiel's lips, and Dean swallows thick, tears welling in his own eyes at the sight of
, he promises himself, and stand up, letting out a shaky breath, before walking further, watching as the rift moves closer towards him.
Two hours ago, he had stirred. He'd breathed louder than usual, and he'd rolled on the bed, then promptly slipped back into his slumber.
"Because... Because I can't. I can't let you see me. You'd only hate me, Cas, trust me
At once everything around them stills, and yet, everything seems to move further and further away, as if the world is spiraling out, and Castiel is its vortex.
"Oh, by the way," Blue starts, "-I have been meaning to ask. Do you always call the people you talk to ‘
Dean almost chokes on his beer, his eyes going wide as he spins around to fix Sam a glare.
At this, Castiel's expression softens, and he steps back, a flicker of defeat within the deep, blue eyes Dean finds himself staring into. His shoulders stiffen, his demeanor morphing back into the same frigid one as before and his voice drops low.
. Dean swallowed thickly the moment he caught a glimpse of skin under the skirt.
Three months. Green is going to be here for three months, that's all.
"Good boy," Dean laughed, and stepped closer to Castiel, his cock hanging out of his unzipped jeans, a rumpled, erotic sight, and the feeling of being stripped down naked and bare in front of somone almost fully-clothed had Castiel buzzed in a strange sort of way. A broad, warm hand gripped his cock and Castiel moaned. The hand stroked down his cock for a few moments, before pulling away.
There's a hum on the other end, and a gasp followed after it.
“Just forget about this, Cas. Let’s go back to the way we were a month ago, okay?”
"You came?" Dean gasps, throwing the door open, stepping out and pressing his back to the  car, unable to move as he drinks in the sight of Cas. Still dressed in his horrible beige trenchcoat, and his usual blue tie. But somehow, he seems different. His face is smoother, somehow, and Dean realises just how beautiful he looks without stress lines creasing his forehead.
Which then had him wondering.
"Eight years? Buddy, I was in boot camp when you were in high school learning 'bout cooties or whatever."
"Missed how you feel, Cas, missed your touch."
, very worried, as you should be too, since we're his only friends," Dean says, hoping Sam will accept it as a fair-enough answer and leave the teasing for later.
"Guess we're not always on the same page, huh?" he hiccups, and Dean nudges him forward by the back of his head, pulling him closer to himself as he rests his cheek against Castiel's.
But even then, he'd ended up stumbling into Dean in their shared classes. Dean had smiled at him, and Castiel had met his eyes for a moment, before settling at the seat farthest from Dean. Of course, Castiel had felt Dean's eyes linger on his skin, before shifting, and the moment they turned away, Castiel was letting out a breath he never knew he'd held. Once the bell rung, he had shuffled out of the class faster than he could even say the word
Castiel smiles.  "Yes. I'm a fairly decent cook, and I have some ravioli left. But, I have a condition."
"No." Dean states and pushes himself to his feet. Before he knows it, he's marching into the kitchen, unbothered about Sam's calls for his names. Marching? More like running away.
"Dean," Cas says behind him, but the word is flat, choked out, as if someone is pretending to be Castiel, imitating him— but it isn't Castiel.
It couldn't be Green. After all, Castiel had trusted him. Every time Castiel had wanted to complete a task alone, Green, or perhaps Dean, had trailed him around, protected him, stood up for him in the discussions when anybody suspected Castiel, and Castiel in turn had stood up for Dean. There was no way Dean could have done it. Dean had been with Castiel every moment. How could he possibly have done such a cruel thing? How could he betray Castiel? After everything they shared, after their friendship, after Castiel had trusted Dean with his
And yet. He could swear the door had been open, simply waiting for him to step in and explore.
"Nothing. Just stuff."
"I will," Dean says, and then, "-I love you."
"Like?"
"Oh, come on, you can manage without me. Besides, I'll be back home in a few hours, right?"
"Need you to fuck me till I can't walk straight. Fill me up with your pups alpha, mark me up, breed me, use me,
Perhaps Castiel should have checked his visitor through the peep-hole, but he was in no shape, mental or physical, to do that. His hair was a raving mess, his shirt was wrinkled from having slept on it weirdly, his pyjama bottoms were old and faded, and he wore a long, navy-blue robe over his shoulders that dragged behind him wherever he went. His face was groggy, nose red with having cried, and his eyes weary. If there was a Christmas spirit, it sure did miss Castiel.
be Lisa.
Dean grumbles after a pause.
"Cas, I need answers, buddy, please."
you falling asleep now."
"Master, won't you feed my hole?"
It takes him every ounce of self-restraint not to turn around and hold Castiel, or even glimpse at him, but he knows better. Even with tears stinging his eyes, he compels himself to walk towards the golden rift.
"No, I just, we haven't talked in a long time. Dad and he don't get along easily. I mean,
"Dean? What are you—?"
"Is it really that bad?"
"Use your words, baby. Cunt or mouth?"
to be bred. His body needed to be filled with seed— an alpha's seed— over and over again until he was sure he was with pup, his body needed to be fucked so thoroughly that the next time he woke up his womb would be swollen with a pup.
"That seems way more believable than the prospect of me finding someone actually decent to date, if I'm being honest."
Sam sighs, swallowing audibly, before moving back to give Dean some space to himself.
"... His name's Cas. He's my... He's my best friend."
"I don't have magic fingers," Castiel huffs, a naive grin curling at his lips.
from across the wall.
over and over again in varied tones of concern, but Castiel was far from responding to them as he felt his ears ring, felt his heart pound,
"M'sorry."
"It is. It's very hard."
Castiel hums in response, and continues to clean the wounds on Dean's face. It takes them a while, what with Dean flinching, cursing, not to forget, their incessant staring.
"Eh, some people would call me a superhero."
How he would stand up on his tip-toes to reach the top shelves, sneeze a soft
"Heartbreak, Blue. It’s supposed to be harsh."
Claire peered up at Castiel, big-blue, bright puppy eyes bearing into his, hitting him right in the center of his heart, and when Claire nodded, her tiny head bobbing with enthusiasm, Castiel couldn't help but smile. Carefully, he maneuvered Jack into Claire's tiny arms, making sure he supported her from beneath.
Dean swallows, his eyes tearing away from Rowena's to fix onto the table below him. He doesn't care for it in particular, it's just a resort for not having to meet Rowena's eyes and Sam's awestruck gaze.
A loud snore from behind him had Castiel jerking, and he blinked his eyes open, somewhat dumbstruck by himself. What had he been doing? Simply standing before the window? And what was he thinking? He knew he was trying to hear something, but what was it? Who was speaking?
Castiel's hole
No, it couldn't. Dean wasn't coming home until a week after. How could he...?
"Yeah, I guess," Dean mumbled.
Sam hums in agreement.
Either he was
"Well, get a hobby then." Green gives a loud, exaggerated sigh from across the wall.
"Hey Winchester," Benny called out, drawing Castiel out of his trance, and he tore his eyes away from Dean, instead letting them wander down to the ground. He untangled himself from Benny's arms, scooting away and putting a good few inches between him and Benny, "-c'mere brotha, it's been days."
Castiel chuckles, unable to keep his laughter in.
"Please, anything—"
and Castiel rolls his eyes, pressing the book shut as he leans back against the wall.
"Lame."
"Buffalo. New York."
It must be somewhere around midnight.
Inside his room, Castiel doubles over, eyes stinging with tears as he clamps a hand over his mouth, violent tears streaming down his face as he sobs, head falling back against the wall as he sucks in quick, shallow breaths to suppress his sobs, hands wrapped around his stomach.
He switches the stove on, grabbing a frying pan and flicking some butter into it. It sizzles as he grabs some salt and pepper and turns back to the stove. There's a bounce in his steps, a flair in his shoulders, and a smile on his face as he chops up some bell peppers. Right as he's about to grab the eggs, his phone rings, and although he tries to ignore it for a moment, the incessant ringing is annoying, so he digs his phone out of his pocket and swipes up without bothering to glance at the caller ID, wedging it between his shoulder and ear.
"Touch me, please—" Castiel gasped, struggling to reach out, but the ropes around his body stung his bruised, red skin, and a sob fell past his lips, tears staining his flushed face as pain crawled through him.
"Dean, may I..." The prince starts, sending Dean shy glances from under his coy eyelashes, "-may I see you as well...?"
Their bedroom was as lavish as the rest of the house. Long, pleated, white curtains hung at the front of the room, framing the large, French window spanning halfway across the front wall. Opposite the window, stood the bed, furnished with the softest baby-pink silk sheets and pillows, and a huge, white net canopy hung above it— something out of a fairytale, and Castiel raised an eyebrow at Dean, who simply smiled. Castiel wandered through the room, simply studying and familiarizing himself with the touch of the paintings hung on the wall, the small, round table at the corner with a grand, golden gramophone sitting atop it, the wardrobe which opened up into a smaller, narrow room, and at last, the window. The window overlooked the woods, the murkier side of the land, yet from above here, the woods felt much calmer and sober than they had before, and Castiel breathed in the scent of the leaves, before feeling a pair of thick arms travel around his chest and fidget with the buttons of his coat.
—Dean, and pressed to his side, Lisa. They were sparkling, Dean looking charming as always in a rich, green button-up, the sleeves of which tightened around his biceps, and Lisa in a short, black dress with a pair of fuzzy, red, thigh-high socks.

"I don't know. Just the way you spoke, I guess." She shrugs and with a smile, walks off.
Castiel smiles. A smile nothing in the world can erase.
"What a pretty little cock, baby, you want me to suck it for you?"
A shiver courses down Dean's spine, and yet, he wills himself to stay upright.
Silence follows his answer, so he supposes Dean must have walked away. Not wanting to delay their

Castiel seems to consider the question with a long, considerate hum.
Castiel swipes up and presses the phone to his ear, pushing himself up on his feet as he strolls over to the window behind him.
"I said it's hard, isn't it, saying goodbye?"
"Your highness."

thing.
Dean loved watching his catboy work around the house.
"I can't hear a thing, Blue. Why don't you laugh first, and then speak?"
As Castiel took a step forward, he felt a pair of broad, warm arms embrace him from behind, and he gave into the touch naturally, letting his senses breathe in the scent of his mate— a piny, musky, minty scent which never failed to charm Castiel, despite having etched every trace of itself into his mind for the past few years. Soft, plush lips pressed against his neck, and he smiled, letting his eyes flutter shut as he let himself loosen into Dean's touch. A trail of kisses pressed to his neck with every passing second, and Dean slid his hands over Castiel's round, prominent stomach.
"Well, you could always go talk to her," Castiel suggested, fighting his instincts that urged him on to sound displeased, but he couldn't let his feelings surface, so he put on a smile. The one he always did when he realised Dean would never love him the way he loved Dean.
A heated flush spreads across Castiel's body, and he sucks in a sharp breath, breathing in the musky scent of Dean's flesh, before leaning down and pressing his tongue flat against the tip of Dean's cock. For the first time in a long while, Dean lets out a noise— a loud, hissing
Now this tugs a smile at Dean’s lips.
leaving soon. But if Dean is leaving soon, and in a week for that matter, why would he not tell Castiel?
Dean smiles. He loves hearing Castiel speak in the morning or late at night, when his words are easy and languid— like that of a young child.
"He doing well?"
"I hope you can hear me. Need to set some things straight."
But he couldn't get far enough, before the leaf on the path behind him was crunching, and the air was filled with the sound of someone panting. It took Castiel less than a second to realise who it was.
But it wasn't anymore. Never had been.
"N—no—"
"A deterioration curse is where the body begins to degenerate, as it would if it were dead, the organs slow down, the body temperature rises, the person shivers, trembles, shakes. They're essentially rotting to death."
"I don't want you to be."
"How did you..." Castiel's breath staggers, and his blue eyes meet Dean's, "
for Cas, or whatever. Maybe the spell was wrong, maybe it hit Castiel before I could stop it, maybe–"
"Please—"
"I know. Something about their innocence, it just seems unfair for them to be so upset, I suppose." Castiel sighs.
You see, Castiel had not seen many alphas in his life. At school, there had been more betas, and well, the alphas were always kept away from the omegas, for biological reasons, of course. By no means was this Castiel's first time being attracted to an alpha, but it was the first time he had ever felt something ring so deep inside him, that too, in the span of such a short time.
He slips a hand around Castiel's waist, pulling him in until Castiel is stumbling into his arms, and slides his hand under Castiel's shirt. A palpable shiver courses through Castiel's body at the touch of Dean's cold hand to his warm, supple skin, and he curls his back into the kiss. Castiel's hands end up gripping Dean's shoulders, and Dean decides to show Castiel just
And goddamn, it hurts. It hurts more than Dean would ever admit.
"You go over there," Sam starts, stepping over to Dean with heavy, treading steps, "- and you tell Cas what you feel, and you save my best friend.
"Go back to the way things were. I'm used to being alone on this floor. A few months ago, there was a man who lived across me, but he only had the flat for namesake so he lived there on and off— not that I paid him much heed. I've already told you about the actress that lived in your flat before, and the fourth flat is empty, has been for years."
It's how he had spent the past ten Christmases.
"Yes alpha, need your fingers inside me. Need your tongue," Castiel moaned and heard Dean groan out loud. A glance behind showed him Dean was palming himself, the tip of his cock nudging against Castiel's round, meaty ass, and a few seconds later, Dean let go of his cock in favour of running his thick fingers down Castiel's taint. Castiel felt his cock twitch at the touch, but he willed himself to remain put as Dean slid a finger through the slick dripping down his thigh. He gathered some up between his fingers before bringing it to his lips, and Castiel watched, gaping, as Dean sucked those fingers into his mouth and let out a vulgar moan.
"Uhm," Castiel hummed in thought, now brought back to the present, realising he was here to hunt for music, not ogle at green-eyed, dark blonde-haired alphas. Perhaps he must have frowned or grimaced because the alpha's eyes widened.
"Cas, I need to get lube."
"Mr. Winchester— Dean— I'm going to—"
Castiel refrains from pacing across the room for he knows it will be harder to hear Dean if he walks away from their wall.
"Such a hungry kitten, aren't you?"
"My— my cunt—"
"They're not stupid," Castiel pouts, only to meet Dean's broad smile. "-Besides, this one I wrote myself. I tend to just say its author is unknown, because I don't want to sound too pretentious."
Some days he blabbers about the tiny lizard he had to kill in the bathroom.
. Old age must be giving way to a lot of confusion for him these days. He regards the elderly man with an almost pitiful expression.
"Read it out for me, sweetheart."
"Ah-ah, be a good boy and clean it up for me, Castiel."
"Do you still wanna' eat Master's come off your fingers?" Dean asked, feeling his cock bulge out again, as Castiel rubbed his ass against Dean's desk.
"It's— it's magnificent. I can feel you Dean,” Castiel chuckles, still bouncing on Dean's cock, "—I can feel you so deep inside me, I never want to be empty again."
"I got you, angel," Dean says, his voice barely a whisper as he noses against Castiel's head, nibbling a hickey at the soft flesh over Castiel's neck, rocking their bodies together— his chest pressed flush against Castiel's back— and pressing a trail of kisses down Castiel's shoulder. He lets go of Castiel's hands, and as expected, Castiel doesn't bother pushing him away, instead, he reaches back to grip Dean's thigh, all the while Dean loosens the knot of the apron at his neck, letting it fall to the ground as he kisses over the smooth skin at Castiel's nape.
And then, the air changed.
"Cas," Dean starts after a few moments, "- I know you're hurting, I know you're trying your best to be strong right now, and you are Cas, you're so strong," he whispers, his lips pressed to Castiel's forehead, "-you know I have to tell Sam, buddy, he's going to help you. Please, let me get him, it won't be too–"
"Hey, uh," the alpha said, and Castiel couldn't remind himself what he had originally turned to the alpha for. All he knew in that moment, was the pair of deep green eyes gazing into his.
Castiel laughed, watching as a string of drool ran down Jack's tiny, chubby red face, and the baby cooed to himself.
, only for them to leave, settles like a boulder on Castiel's chest. It's a bittersweet feeling, if he's being honest, for he has found a friend like no other friend he’s had before, and he knows now, how dearly he must cherish his time with his friend. Still, the foreboding feeling of being left alone in a few weeks' time nags at Castiel.
"Use your words, Cas."
"Sam?" Dean calls out, peeking his head into the Bunker's kitchen where Sam is sitting at the table with the morning news in one hand, a mug of coffee in the other. Castiel is supposed to be in there, he always is, either chatting with Sam about mythology, or Sam rambling to him about puppies. However, this morning, Castiel is nowhere to be seen. Not in the library, not in the showers, not in the living room, and as Dean now discovers, not in the kitchen either.
It's half past two in the morning when the bell rings.
Blue hums.  "You didn't answer my question yet."
son? He's back. Alive and kicking, and oh, so down to kick your ass. So I'm gonna' give you a chance to give Cas back to me, without any bloodshed, and I won't be bothering you anymore."
"Alright. Let me know soon, okay?"
Before he can voice his doubt, however, the door to the bathroom clicks open, and Dean's eyes dart over to it. He watches as Castiel, his body swaying, his hands scrambling for the wall, and his eyes, reddened with exhaustion and tears, his hair a mess— leans against the door frame, and for a moment, it seems as if he's going to lose his balance and crash down to the floor.
not a long stretch, just a step or two forward
"You'll find love one day, Green, I’m sure you will."
is a lie. And it hurts Dean, because he loves Castiel, and that's something Castiel should know at this point. All Dean wants to do is make Castiel happy. Not hurt him.
Allowing Dean some time to relax, Castiel crawls up his broad, firm, inked body, and lays his head down on Dean's chest, hair grazing the bottom of Dean's chin, and warm hands come around to wrap over Castiel's waist. Silence lingers in the air, uncertain and thick. Castiel drags a nimble finger down the large tattoo piece on Dean's chest. The colours are dark, a little faded, but the lines of it are prominent. It reminds him of an old canvas, one that has been painted too many times, and the colours of which have darkened. On his back, Dean's hands move up, holding him close. Against his volition, Castiel's eyes drift up to Dean's. He expects Dean to be sated, content.
"What do you want me to do? Tell Crowley I want out? Because my boyfriend wants me to? Don't think he'll kill me the moment he finds out I'm a pansy?"
. Settle for one. Sweetheart or buddy?"
"Yes master, yes, please—"
"Let me guess, you got the short straw, huh?"
"It's alright, Dean, I'm alright."
This time, he couldn't find it in himself to struggle against Dean.
more.
Dean gives a weak smile as he accepts the folded clothes, and Castiel kisses his nose, before walking away to grab a fresh set of clothes for himself.
"Bite it."
"Keep— keep fucking me, Mr. Win— Mr. Winchester—"
And somehow, in these little things, Castiel finds himself smiling, nodding along to Dean's words, losing himself in the sound of Dean's blithe laughter.
You got some more pie left?"
A moment later, a familiar husky voice speaks up. "Hey, uhm, it's me, uh, your neighbour. And uh... I just, I wanted to apologize for uhm, interrupting you a while back."
“It’s a Saturday, so yes.”
"Dean, go—" Castiel shakes his head with a defeated grin, and pushes Dean away, their eyes meeting. A glimmer of mischief twinkles within his eyes.
His fingers tugged Castiel's trousers down before he crumpled it up and threw it over to the front seat, all the while licking a stripe of spit down Castiel's chest and stomach.
"Fucking. They were fucking, Cas."
Castiel pauses once again, and this time, Dean pauses with him. They turn to each other as if guided by a pull, and Dean quirks his bottom lip.
"Cas—" Dean starts, ready to speak, to let it out, to spill everything that has been lingering on the tip of his tongue for years, but a weight settles against his jaw. A hand— unmoving, simply there.
Green doesn't respond for a moment, and Castiel's heart begins to drop lower in his chest. Then he hears a soft sigh, soft enough for him to miss it were it not for the silence drowning them.
Dean sucks in a deep breath.
"I hope so too."
When Dean pulled away at last, Castiel blinked his eyes open. Now completely black, instead of the once bright blue and filled with grace. He felt strangely rejuvenated, as if his body had regained its strength.
But mostly, it's a litany of the phrase
"They'll hunt me down, Cas. Just like they did with Barth today. They'll kill me, worse, they'll kill you, kill Sam. I can't risk it."
"Yes— yes— yes, me too—"
Castiel will never know. He won’t know Dean is leaving until Dean is already gone.
"Oh," The alpha gulped. His eyes travelled up to meet Castiel's, but not before lingering on the curve of his hips, and he quirked his bottom lip, "-not bad. Didn't peg you for the classic rock type."
"Like shit." Castiel grumbles, and Dean snorts, glancing up at Sam, who has a half-smile on his face.
“No, I didn’t tell them until I was eighteen.”
Cas smells like Dean's shampoo. Like detergent. Like Miracle. Like home.
There's a rising irritation in Dean's voice, but Castiel reminds himself he's the one who started it and lets it slide.
"I don't know. I call you Mr. Textbook."
"Rowena's waiting for us outside. Said she needs to study Castiel to know what's happening to him. I let her use the inventory for whatever ingredients she needed for the diagnostic spell."
Dean's eyes slip shut. God, he wishes he could just push it down, this— this anticipation, this thrill, this buzz that lingers under his skin when he hears Castiel speak.
"Like... What it means to move on in life. What it means to let go. What it means to love again. And have your heart broken again." Green laughs, and Castiel senses a bitterness tinging his voice.
