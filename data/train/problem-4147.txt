“Straight to the point, huh?” she said, not particularly unkindly. It confused Castiel, and he didn’t like it. Now she was pulling a ham sandwich out of a ziplock baggie and laying it on the library desk, for some reason. Was she trying to eat lunch with him? Red flags were up and waving in his head.
“Yeah? Don’t you have homework or something?” Dean knew she was in the midst of an avalanche of homework, with end of year studies and the extra complications of dropping in unexpectedly from a patient lenient homeschooled background.
______________________
As the cool gravel dug into his side and face, Castiel gritted his teeth and tried to sit up, only making it a little bit into a sitting position before pain in his ribs flared up and he slumped back to the ground. His heart was beating so fast, it hurt too along with the rest of his body. Dean looked down at him with something like pity in those beautiful green eyes. Wait, when did the word beautiful make it’s way in there?
Alistair smiled at him as Castiel tried to recover from the shock of falling asleep in a trashy alley way, and waking to find one of his tormentors in chief with his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, grinning down at him scarily. Trying to get away from the vices on his shoulders, Castiel pushed himself harder against the brick behind him, eyes squeezed shut. The grip only tightened, and Castiel gasped before he could stop himself at the pain of it. He opened his eyes and tried to look past Alistair for something he could use to defend himself.
“Oh come on, we’ve all seen the Batman movies. I think Joker is a close second.” Chided Azazel, apparently following Dean’s train of thought.
Thursday, May
“Come on, say hello to dad!” Zacharia mockingly said opening his arms as if welcoming a hug, and Cas walked stiffly across the room for  his father to squeeze him into a bone-crushing mangle of a hug. It made all the injuries on his body cry out, and Castiel bit his lip hard to keep from making a sound. He didn’t return the hug, just stood there and took it. Fake affection was at least a little better than beatings.
“Don’t talk that way to me! I am your mother! I am trying to help you!” His mother shouted.
He cringed, and backed down the stairs, listening to the dripping of his hair, suddenly louder than it had been before. “Yes mother?”
Of course, there was always the fact that there could have been something terrible about to happen to Castiel, and Dean wanted to get one last look at his plaything before it disappeared forever. But Castiel was just being dramatic, right?
Castiel lay on the kitchen floor several more minutes to collect himself. He let the residual fear leave his body, slowly calming his own breaths and concentrating on what was real, however pitiful it might be. The dream had been bloody and disturbing, filled with silent people and crows with wet green eyes that pecked his hands to raw bloody messes. It left him gasping for air.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eyes. Blue. Lips. Stubble. Wrinkles. Eyelashes. String.
He caught her staring at his wrist, the one not covered by the cast, and looked down at it. She was looking at the red line engraved into his skin from the zip-ties he had been tied with. His stomach dropped, and he looked back at her worriedly, wondering what she thought caused those marks.
It burned like a fire, ached like heavy blows and cut like sharp glass. It was everywhere. Castiel was awash in flames now, so much so he wished he was back at home miserable and frightened, rather than here, optionless and painfully immobile.
Sobbing under his breath, he started moving again. His backpack was gone, his mother was dead, there were weather predictions for unusually cold winds in the weekends, and Castiel was beaten blue and black. Shit couldn’t hit the fan much harder than this.
His father arrived shortly after Castiel finished dinner preparations. His mother bolted from the couch, slipped on some high heels to match her red dress, and went to greet her husband at the door. Castiel hurried to the bathroom, just for a few seconds to make sure he was decent, and then walked into the living room to greet him.
Sam opened up the screen, looking ready to kill Dean. Then, his eyes traveled down, and widened to the size of baseballs. Without a word, he opened the door wider and Dean staggered in, being careful so that he didn’t give Castiel brain damage by whacking his head on the wooden rail of their door.
Winchester just looked at him. Uneasy, Castiel slowly stepped back like he would with an unfriendly dog. Winchester just stared at him for a moment longer, before the took a breath in as if he were about to say something, but he seemed to change his mind. Castiel waited just a second longer before he began walking away quickly, weirded out and confused. Winchester didn’t shout anything after him, and Castiel just kept walking down the sidewalk until the school was out of sight.
He escaped upstairs before she could glare at him or get mad.
“‘No one was supposed to get hurt’?” She repeated in a dangerously low voice. “Dean, I have a hard time swallowing your bullshit. And I think you do too.”
So when it was time for his last class, he hurried past the stairwell, this time full on running. His stomach leapt when he saw a hand reach out to grab him, but he swerved and managed to avoid it. As he continued down the hallway, he heard muttered curses coming from the stairs.
But he couldn’t find the black hair and pale face in the crowd, and gave up when he saw one of his other play toys walking fearfully down the hall.
_________________
The more he thought about the pool, the feel of Alistair’s bony hands on his tender neck, the sound of laughter echoing off the damp walls, the more angry Castiel became. At how weak he was, how cruel the Knights were, how hopeless his situation was. How easily bruises formed on his skin, and instead of growing used to it it was like his skin was flaking off, each layer was more sensitive than the other and he could feel it more firmly than before. Maybe the knowledge in his head that he was a pathetic excuse for a person was strengthening the pain of it all. He never used to feel it like this. He couldn’t defend himself, he relied on the pity of others to keep himself alive, to save his ass at the important times and ignore him at the others. Yesterday was one of the worst Knight attacks yet, and he had been rescued by a petite blonde with a sharp mouth who shouldn’t give two fucks about him but still sat with him at lunch. Pathetic.
“So….How are you?” Castiel asked haltingly.
Dean had gotten the call sometime after 2 in the morning. He had barely shouted at Sam to wake up before he was rushing out of the house, starting the impala and yelling at Sam to hurry up. The taller man had just gotten in and Dean had slammed on the gas, leaving Sam’s door open because he didn’t have time to wait.
He started with his head, lifting his neck up and then bumping it back as gently as he could onto the floor with a groan. His neck was horribly painful, having been pulled so many ways the night before. After a few moments he tried again, forcing his head up and then his shoulders, eyes welling at the pain but no tears spilling. He gasped as he felt the bruise on his stomach burst in pain. Then in turn almost every other body part he had bloomed in a fiery complaint that echoed through his brain. Now he could feel the beginnings of an unwelcome headache.
Novak nodded at the wall, but still didn’t say anything. Sam turned to Dean again. “It you have, like, a scrap of decency in you, you’re gonna fix things Dean.” He started gathering himself, saying “And we’re both gonna help.”
Yesterday father came home. As you can see, I am starting to forget to write in this journal. Last night I completely neglected it, though it was a rather stressful day. School was rough, Winchester and Abernathy gave me a scare. I thought they were going to break my arm again, for a second. Then I came home and cleaned, and father arrived soon after. He quite enjoyed reminding me how friendless and hopeless I am at dinner. He and mother were fighting in the kitchen, though I’m not sure what about. It hasn’t turned physical, yet. Though that could be happening now and I wouldn’t know until he dragged her screaming down the hall. He likes to be quiet sometimes, it’s quite startling.
School has been terrible, people pushing him around and down, knowing how hard it is to get up with one arm. Luckily, he was due to get his cast off next week.
She looked over at him from where she was watching TV on a giant flat screen, and answered “No.” In a monotone , if slightly slurred voice. Castiel left the room.
Saturday, May
“It’s nothing. Just remembered how much homework I gotta do. So let’s get my book and I can go take care of it, aright?”
He was pulled out of his reveries by the sound of feet on the stairs. He bolted upright and turned the TV off, knowing his mother liked to have it when she came down. He quickly whisked his three mugs to the kitchen and dumped them in the sink. Then his mind went blank as to what he should do now. Stand in the kitchen? Wait in the living room? He never knew what to do when his mother came down, he ended up standing creepily in front of the couch, holding a book he had read a long time ago.
Here lies Castiel
Too quickly, he heard the floorboards creak to him, his father’s dress shoes clicked across the hardwood and soon the man walked into the hallway Castiel was occupying, making it feel small and claustrophobic.
_________
Flickers of grief flared in Castiel’s stomach, but they were faint. After all, it wasn’t like he had many good memories of the woman who’d ‘raised’ him, but she was his family. Had been his family. He wasn’t really surprised that Zechariah was using her death as a way to finally get rid of him.
When he was released, he stumbled back and “Welcome home father.” left his mouth numbly. “Dinner will be starting in a few minutes.”
After about thirty minutes of nonsense and mind numbing stupidity, Castiel turned off the TV and stood up. He stretched his arms over his head, his back cracking pleasantly. The cast bumped his head when he put his arm down, and he found himself wondering how many hours he had before he could get it off. He wished he could take it off right now, but the doctors and his mother both told him to wait. Castiel had been immensely confused, and still was, about why his mother would make him wait. Surely it would just impede him from being useful? He didn’t get it, but he didn’t get a lot of things.
He hissed as Cas started scratching at his hands, tearing the skin. He was desperate to escape whatever they had planned for him. Dean called to Alastair “Hey Al! Get the ties, would you!?” Ties? What were they planning on doing to him? His breathing quickened, and Dean rubbed his back in mock sympathy.
And just like that, Dean launched himself at Sam, who raised his fists and got a solid punch directly onto Dean’s cheekbone before he was slammed to the floor. Dean heard a sharp rustle of blankets from the couch as there was a fantastic boom from their hitting the floor. Hands, elbows, knees where everywhere. Dean was still keeping in mind Sam was younger than him, so he wasn’t quite cementing him to the rug, but Sam was giving as good as he got and Dean was getting pissed. In a few minutes, the fight was over.
“Good, good. Take my bags upstairs. There’s more in the car.” Zacharia dug around in his pocket, and tossed a key to Castiel, who fumbled and let the key drop to the floor. He just barely caught Zacharias smirk as he bent over stiffly to pick it up. His father didn’t say anything about the bruises and bandaids on his son’s face.
He felt guilty for feeling so relieved his dad didn’t know. It felt weird, feeling guilty about something connected to Castiel. Mostly things connected to Castiel just made him feel angry. He didn’t like feeling guilty. Not that he wasn’t a little guilty. As much as he hated Castiel, he knew that mocking and hurting someone every day was a bit wrong. Well, a lot wrong. But it didn’t feel wrong. It was Castiel, the kid who everything and wanted for nothing.
This chapter was sitting in my Google Docs, so I decided to just copy and paste it. It's from 3 years ago, I'm not continuing the story, but I am very sorry to everyone I've just suddenly let down. It's tough to realize the fic has no end. Thank you for all the support! Stay cool, fandomland.
“S-top.” He ground out, trying not to tear up from the pain of it. “St-stop.”
Apparently the gasp had been involuntarily for Novak didn’t stir more than sagging farther down Dean’s chest. Handling him like a fragile eggshell, Dean hefted Castiel farther up before slipping his hand under his knees and holding him bridal style. Another whisper of agony passed Castiel’s lips, and Dean glanced at his face. Instead of the relaxed if unlively expression on his face beforehand,  his nose was screwed up slightly, and his mouth was twisted in pain. As Dean started walking to the car, he could hear Novak’s breath bobbing in time with his footsteps.
He was about a block from his house, when he heard footsteps coming from behind him. He ignored them for a moment, but when they got louder he turned his head to see. It was Alastair, Azazel and Dean. They were closing in quickly behind him, with mean cold looks on their faces. Castiel saw the Winchester’s impala sitting behind the group, a getaway car waiting. Castiel turned back around and started to run back to his house. He was not a fast runner though, and his shoes were not made for quick getaways. He heard someone start running behind him, and a weight slam on top of him, making him fall flat on his stomach. The person on top of him laughed, and he recognized Winchester’s voice saying “That was too easy Novak!”
Close to the skin.
He sat on the cold linoleum floor for some time before a boy walked in and looked at him in surprise before walking nervously a bit closer and prodding Castiel’s motionless body with his foot. The boy on the floor was watching the kid through his fingers warily. “Hey, dude you okay? Do I need to get someone?” He prodded Castiel harder and he let his hands slip from his face and slap down to his lap, glaring up at the kid, who looked asian with a floppy haircut that almost covered his eyes. His polo shirt was rumpled, and he took a step back when he saw who he was talking to.
Cas microwaved his spaghetti, leaning against the kitchen counter as he waited. It sounded like world war two was happening in the microwave, but he bet his pasta would be cold in the middle. He pulled it out when the timer was done, and found this was just the case.
Castiel jerked his whole body into a flinch when his father lunged forward and flung his backpack off his shoulder, probably bruising his arm some more with the force of the pull. It landed with a thump to the floor on the opposite side of the room. “See, if you’d been on time then I would’ve let you keep that!” Hissed Zacharia.
He walked into the wooden, brown and chipped doorway to the immediate smell of coffee, cigarettes and spray paint. On the patchy faux-leather couches near the door lounged a few low lifes, sipping liquids of their choices out of styrofoam cups and reading magazines. Dean nodded to one who lifted his head long enough to stare at him. To his relief the dude nodded back and went back to the intense highlighting he was doing to what looked like a textbook. Nodding back is a sign that you’re not crazy, or on drugs, or likely to kill you. All three types of peope lived in this side of town. And on the better side too, but they were just more descreet about it.
He waited for only a few seconds before the door opened, pulled wide by a bald man wearing a blazer and work trousers. Obviously, Zacharia Novak was home. The man looked Dean up and down before raising an eyebrow at his bloody clothes and asking “Can I help you, young man?”
“That’s the only chance you’re getting. If you can sit with me today without bringing me bodily harm, or doing stupid shit, I might give you a chance. But you can’t sit with me tomorrow.” Castiel growled, trying to bring something intimidating into his features. It might have worked on Jo, as she looked a little taken aback but nodded once, rolling her eyes like Castiel was being unreasonable. He sat at the nearest table. Grabbing his PBJ again and trying to eat quickly.
He got into his room, and locked the door behind him. Then he started carefully rolling the sleeve up on his broken arm, wincing every time he touched his skin. When he got the cloth all the way to his elbow, he looked at the arm. It was swollen a little, and bruised a bit on the underside. It was also bent just a little off, so little that if you didn’t look closely you wouldn’t notice it. His stomach dropped at the sight, even though there was no blood. The thought of going to the emergency room or hospital was bad enough. He left the sleeve, and stared around his room, thinking about nothing in particular.
He cleared the dumpster and caught site of the guy fully. His stomach flopped around, partly in response to the smell of the air around the person, and partly because there was so much blood. The ground was red and brown, rusty and wet in some places.
Stomach leaping, Castiel felt his face shift into a confused tilt. Alistair was subtly closer than before. “You see, there’s a couple of ways you could get out of this shit heap and back to another, more comfortable life.” He was getting somewhere, cutting the bullshit and getting to the meat of the subject. “And all you have to do, is a few little things.” Closer. Castiel’s back was pushed into the wall painfully hard, to get away from the scratchy chin nearing his face. Through his eyelashes, Alistair looked at Castiel, predatorily. “I’ve been real lonesome lately, Cas. Real lonesome.”
“Hey Al, did your dad or mom say anything about Novak to you?”  He hit send.
But he didn’t get to rest long. He sprang upright when he saw Dean round the corner and walk to him. Damn. You’re screwed. Should have beat it when you had a chance. His mind told him Helpfully, before Dean’s face donned it’s signature smirk, (and it looked a little forced, but Cas knew that was just his imagination) and his fist slammed into Cas’s face.
He walked to the thermostat and turned it down, wondering why someone would want it up that high anyways.
“Just hanging out.”
He rubbed his eyes, yawning at the same time. He was wearing a pair of ratty threadbare pajama pants he had had since his freshmen year of highschool, and they rested just above the tops of his ankles when he stood up. A grey t shirt went on top of those, and both those articles of clothing were hidden out of sight beneath the old comforter curled around Castiel.
Castiel slept for so much much longer than he had intended to.
Castiel stood abruptly, PBJ half eaten in his hand. Zipping his backpack up he slung it around his shoulder. “Nice meeting you, but it won’t work.” He tossed over his shoulder, gathering his books from the floor. “Tell them it’s getting old.” He barely kept from crying out while he stooped to get his stuff.
He opened the side door and levered Castiel out, this time getting him into his arms more easily. Novak was completely silent. Dean almost gagged when the wave of toilet-smell hit him. Clearly, Castiel had not had the strength to find a bathroom in that Alleyway.
When he slipped out the back door, his mother was still watching TV. He barely looked at her to make sure she wasn’t going to stop him. She was just sitting with her eyes glazed, staring at the TV like she was blind. She wasn’t going to get up for a while, if she didn’t fall asleep. He closed the door and locked it with a key behind him.
“It’s probably only going to take about an hour, you will maybe have to sign some paperwork but-but that’s it I think, and then you only have to be there, I think while I-”
His father growled, a disgusting rumble at the back of his throat like it was full of phlegm. Castiel shuddered, then groaned as his father’s foot sank deep into his stomach, scooting him along the floor a few inches. He gagged as he was hit again, in the same spot, tears springing to his eyes involuntarily. He had barely curled up his legs to protect himself when fingers were scraping his still-smarting scalp, and suddenly he was yanked up again. Mercilessly pulled up to his knees, He didn’t know how the grip in his hair was being maintained so long, it was so short. But his father usually found ways to get around those things.
Carefully Castiel walked back up the stairs and brought his backpack and a pair of shoes with him, tying them tightly without looking down and hefting the backpack on one sore shoulder for the walk ahead of him. Before he had come downstairs he had slipped his journal into his backpack, meaning to take care of it on his walk home today, if he didn’t get semi-kidnapped again. He readjusted his backpack to that it didn’t hurt so much on his skin. He would have carried it if he didn’t doubt the upper arm strength he currently (didn’t) possess.
Alistair snorted. Then he released Castiel’s shoulder for a moment to dig around in his back pocket. The students around then were trickling slowly now, most disappearing into classrooms and bathrooms. While Alistar’s hand was off Castiel’s shoulder, the boy decided to bolt, shoving himself away from the locker and starting to run, but his arm was swiftly grabbed by Alistair. The bully yanked Cas back and at the same time Dean leapt forward and pushed him, and he crashed into the wall of lockers hard before crumbling down it, face screwed up. Dean watched Castiel’s hands ball into fists, and tried to feel happy as he imagined how much that had to hurt. It didn’t seem to be cheering him up as much as usual. Stupid.
Once he grabbed socks and somehow dragged them onto his feet, Castiel walked carefully down the hallway and into the kitchen, the only comfort he had about his situation was that his father worked 7 days a week most of the time and he had left for his job hours before daylight. After taking a glance at the mostly empty fridge, he decided to forgo lunch because making anything would mean rooting through shelve to cobble together some sort of finger food. He did grab a banana for breakfast. Then he filled a glass with water and drank it steadily down in one go, chugging until there was no sound but his teeth clicking on the glass. It didn’t feel much better, but at least he was hydrated.
“Dammit” He hissed, jerking the covers off half angrily half sleepily, and stumbling to his dresser.
His mother answered questions and filled out a couple forms, then he was whisked away to get his arm fixed.
“I’m good. How are you Castiel?” She asked, still with a bright tone that just projected friendship into the air. It seemed very very wrong.
Cas lived about two miles from the hospital, a short walk compared to some he had to take. He really should start driving soon, but he can’t seem to find the time to get a license. He nearly crashed into a lamp pole because he wasn’t looking, and snapped himself out of his thoughts.
Novak’s face was a mess. Well, it always was, something Dean prided himself on, but it was more of a mess than usual, scraped in patterns of concrete on his forehead and cheek. His neck was painted purple, crescent moons were visible on the sides on his throat in the shape of fingernails, but Dean tried not look at it too hard. He felt sick. Novak tried to keep his head down, Dean watched as his chin nearly bumped his chest in the effort to make the livid bruises less obvious. Dean couldn’t help trying to imagine exactly what had happened after he left the swimming pool. The scene in his head wasn’t quite as pleasant as he wanted it to be, and he found himself trying quickly to banish the thoughts as they came because it wasn’t making anything better. Dammit.
He picked up his pillows on his bed, checked his closet twice and looked through his shelf once before he finally found the ancient machine. He blew the dust of the front of it, like an archeologist in an Indiana Jones movie blowing the dust off some ancient artifact.
He finished up in the journal and put it aside after locking it. Then he turned out the light and went to bed.
Hey Y'all! I'm so sorry to have so heartlessly abandoned this story. As some readers may have guessed from previous comments, my personal issues got a lot better, and then A LOT worse. I've had the worst couple years of my life, and while my drive to write has diminished, going back and reading your comments every so often gives me warm, happy feelings of worth in this world. That's very dramatic but accurate.
Castiel looks terrified. “Just - just getting off the bridge. Let me go to class, please.”
“Or, if you don’t prefer the more oral aspect of the pleasure range, you know I could just help you get that stick out of your ass.” He leaned closer, much much more than before, next to Castiel’s ear. “And I could help another in.” He whispered.
“Castiel.” She started.
“Hey, dude.” He called, softly. No response. “Dude, you okay? Are you hurt?” Could just be a stoner passed out, or someone who’s had just a little too much to drink…. Or some evil sneaker-wearing witch that lures boys into her ally to eat them slowly tendon by tendon.
______________________________________
“How are your grades?” Zacheria asked. “Your friends?”
He called to his mother “I’m going to the library! I’ll see you in a bit.” He waited and heard her responding grunt before bounding out the door.
He walked to the bathroom and wrapped a waiting ziplock baggie around his cast before turning on the shower and stepping inside. He kept a few of them on the counter. He went through the usual motions, shampooing his hair, conditioning his hair and rinsing. He washed his body and turned off the water, not lingering for a second longer than he had to. Excitement sparked in his stomach as he thought about getting his cast off, and as he dried off his mop of almost black hair he smiled a bit. It stretched across his lips strangely, the expression foreign on his mostly stoic face.
“Clean. I’ll start dinner. You’re making garlic bread.” His mother walked into the kitchen, talking over her shoulder.
He padded to the door and opened it almost soundlessly, the bottom of it brushing the floor lightly. He stepped out into the hall, not closing the door but turning off the light because he wasn’t sure if his mother was in bed or not, but if she walked by the door she wouldn’t look in unless the light was on. Then she would usually yell at him to go to bed, and not leave until he had turned out the lights and was under covers.
“Get out.” He growled. “Sam, if you value anything you love, get out right now.”
Castiel placed the computer on his bed carefully, and attached it to it’s charger so it wouldn’t poop out on him. Then he walked to his shelf and browsed the seasons of Buffy The Vampire SLayer, before settling on season 7. He held the cardboard box in his hands, reading the list of episodes it had and frowning a little. He finally decided on the last episode of the series, because he felt like he needed to be sadder for some reason.
“No. Thank you.” He went to step past her, hoping she wouldn’t prolong the conversation.
Castiel paused the TV reluctantly, before turning it off because his mother got up in 10 minutes and there was no way he would be able to watch TV with her in the room. She would either turn it to something she liked, (like Dance moms or Hell’s kitchen) or she would turn off the TV and hide the remote so that he couldn’t watch anything.
Tell me how you like this one, cuz I'm not so sure about it. Ugh.
Cas stared at his notebook, but not for as long as he had previously. Then he shut it, dropped his pen over the side of his bed that he was nested on, and dragged himself from a slumped half-sit to a full sitting position. Then he crawled off his bed and over to his shelf, where he kept a roll of duct tape for emergencies. He was going to cover up his name on the front, because now that he thought about it he really liked the idea of throwing it finally into the same creek he had broken his arm in. The water wouldn’t destroy it completely, but the ink would run and the pages would tear. Someone would have to be awfully determined to read it, and he couldn’t imagine that anyone would want to read about his sorry life if they weren't interested in getting dirt on him.
He got up and walked around the house quickly, fairly sure that his mother was not there. She did that, just leaving without telling him anything. She once was gone for 4 days in a row, without leaving so much as a note to tell him where she went.
Dean Winchester walked in, and Castiel’s eyes widened a fraction in surprise. Shouldn’t he be in school? I doesn’t let out until 3. And then Dean looked up and Cas ducked down before he could see him, crouching behind the pinball he was playing. He heard the ball fall past the little plastic guards and the losing music play. He gulped as fear curled in his chest like a chemical reaction to seeing Dean.
And then it hit him. He had told Jo! He had completely and totally forgotten that he had told someone else about the swimming pool, that he had stopped Jo in the parking lot and sent her back to check up on the situation. Suddenly his stomach started to roil, wondering what she had found. Also, friend? She was friends with Novak?
Get a fucking hold on yourself Winchester, He thought shakily, and wondered what was wrong with him. He gave a last, slightly forced glare at Castiel and stood up, watching Castiel rub at the initials A. A. and D. W. Carved into his arm with ink of Alistar’s ballpoint pen. Then he and Alistair walked away, with the sea of students parting in front of them.
“Great. Great!” Dean groused, when Novak looked hopeful at this. “Let’s put another thing off. That sounds just great. Sam, get dinner for yourself and him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After puzzling a moment about where he should put the glass shards, The trash can inside, or the bigger one outside? He dumped it into the bigger one around the shadowy side of the house. The clattering of the contents might have woken his mother inside, and he didn’t want to risk her bad mood.
He spent the evening feeling horribly guilty, while at the same time mentally yelling insults at himself, and also trying to figure out what the hell he and Sam where going to eat because his dad hadn’t given him any money for groceries when he had left for a job interview a few states away yesterday. It didn’t help that Jo’s words were ringing in his ears like fire engine sirens either. As he opened the same cupboard doors over and over again, and perused the fridge’s contents for the thousandth time, Dean wondered Novak would be okay after that afternoon.
Dean turned back to the pasta and stirred it. “Sure…” His muttered, stretching the word out into 5 syllables. Sam huffed indignantly.
Ping. Ping. Ping. Cas’s fingers flew on the pinball machine, trying to make his rounds last because he only had three bucks and he had to make them worth it. The metal ball flew over pictures of boxing rings and Rocky and the lyrics to ‘Eye of the Tiger’ That were splashed across the inside of the game. The door across the arcade opened, letting in a burst of cool spring air, and he looked up momentarily over the pinball machines in front of him to see who it was on reflex.
Castiel didn’t answer. He continued walking.
“So, I’m just gonna sit on the floor and do my stuff. I can quote the movie backwards anyhow, no matter if I’m doing science while it’s playing. Do you need anything? A snack, or water? I was thinking we could change any bandages later. And Dean helped you, uh, to the bathroom?”
Apparently, the younger Winchester was about to show him the way of Harry Potter. He wondered how many movies there were in the series, 6? 7? He couldn’t remember.
Blood has been washed away. Sam did that part. Dean couldn’t touch the water. Burns.
“Did you bother him yesterday?” She asked, fiercely.
It was strange how seemingly energetic and loose his father might appear, the image of a family man. That facade was just a load of bullshit. But Zacharia was so good at faking and painting the image of the ‘perfect family’ that everyone bought it. It was probably the reason all the kids at school hated him, now that he thought of it.
“We thought me might change it up a little this time,” purred Azazel. “Give you different scenery.” Then they started dragging him to the car.
Sam is talking. Meaningless, time wasting.
“Why are you here?” He asked, thoroughly confused. She laughed slightly.
“Can’t blame ya for being cranky.” He said sympathetically. Castiel shrunk away again, because he could envision something akin to the scratches happening again. Unpredictability was Alistair’s most used weapon.
He snatched it off the shelve like it was going to disappear, greedily eyeing it up. It had come out a while before, but his library was always slow to get new books. While he was devouring the back of the book with his eyes, he heard loud laughter. He looked up and his heart plummeted from where it was hovering in his adam’s apple.
“Are you okay? Would you like some help?” A voice came from in front of him, startling him in it’s closeness. Looking dazedly at the woman in front of him, Castiel stepped backwards hastily. Warm brown eyes and dark brown hair, the woman looked maybe in her thirties.
He walked into the living room and flopped onto the couch, grabbing the remote with his good arm and flicking the TV on. He had two hours before his mother woke up, and he would have to abandon ship and make her breakfast. But he could watch Doctor Who until then.
His father laughed softly, bald head shining in the moonlight from the window. The sound made Castiel twitch a little. His whole body flinched when his father sighed and unhooked himself from the doorjamb. As Castiel watched him approach, he cursed himself fluently in his head for going downstairs, how stupid was he? After years of living in the same house as Zacharia, why hadn’t he learned the fucking rules? Was he really that brain dead, that he would sneak out of his room at night for a fucking roll of duct tape, what the hell?
Castiel raised his hand to block the first punch to the head, making it just a hint duller than it would’ve been. He gave up pretty much right as the second blow sucked the air out of his lungs, sinking deep into his stomach and making him wretch horribly. Zachariah's knee cracked into Castiel’s lowered face, and the burning waves of pain in his head made his cry out hoarsely, dropping to his knees. His father laughed cruelly, and said something Castiel couldn’t focus on before pushing him back off balance so that Castiel’s back crashed to the ground.
Dean remembered hearing Sam’s footsteps growing near as he rammed his foot into the lock on the door, not quite breaking it. He couldn’t hear anything coming from inside, no matter how hard he strained his ears. Sam grabbed his sleeve from behind and Dean stepped back when he saw the shotgun in his younger brother’s arms. The lock exploded off with a cracking sound and Dean kicked the door open without another panicked thought.
The thought barely made it into his mind before Dean crouched down and grabbed Cas’s face. “Sammy’s waiting for me, so I gotta run. Seeya tomorrow. Unless, of course mommy and daddy pull you out tomorrow too.” Anger flashed briefly across Dean’s freckled face.
“I- I don’t think it would be a very good idea.” He said faintly, looking anywhere but Alistair’s eyes.
He let his mother go in first, and closed the door behind him. He went to the big kitchen and got himself a glass of milk, the most calming thing he could think of to drink, besides hot chocolate. His mother was standing in the kitchen too when he turned.
_____
Dean watched Castiel leave, and that annoying bit of guilt pelted through his heart.
After changing, he debated. Take a nap, or go downstairs? Spend several hours in blissful sleep, or go face the thunderstorm he had left brewing behind his locked door? It was glaringly obvious which one he would choose. He laid carefully back on the bed, settling into the mattress that felt like a pillow stuffed with angel feathers. Within minutes he was fast asleep, not unlike a log, and oblivious to the world.
Dean woke up the next morning to his alarm, like always. He got up and turned it off, like always. He walked into the bathroom for a shower, as always.
“I thought dragging Novak always put you in a good mood, Dean-o!” Alistair said, faking concern. “But it looks like it’s doing the opposite now.”
They started moving, Alistar jerked him forward and he awkwardly hobbled along, still ensnared in the headlock. Winchester continued. “See, we heard from a certain person that you aren’t exactly a prodigy when it comes to the water world.” Castiel stiffened just a little in surprise; it was true, he wasn’t the best when it came to swimming. He would bet prepared to bet that the school PE teacher had given that particular piece of information. He had never exactly done well in her swimming lessons. “So we thought we’d just give you a little practice.”
‘He has a point,’ said a little voice in the back of Dean’s head. He glared at Sam, angry at him for making his guilt rear back up again.
He could hear every shake of his breath and his heart was beating faster with the exertion of carrying a 5’12 teenager (he may be rail thin, but he was no featherweight) and another person stared at him as they walked… His car was only a few feet away now, and no one had called him out yet. He couldn’t believe he was doing this….
It was several minutes before he got to his destination, cruising to a stop outside the house, looking up at it for a moment. There was no movement inside. A car that looked like it was worth more than Dean’s house was sitting in the driveway. His lip curled in envy when he saw it, though he did try to tear his mind away from that. He looked into the back, where Novak’s face was shining with sweat. Fresh blood was leaking from his shirt, dotting the fabric bright red. Dean grimaced and looked back at the house, dragging his feet slightly. He didn’t want to meet Novak’s parents, he didn’t want to go inside and he DIDN’T want credit for this, beyond what he may tell his darling little brother. This was going to destroy his reputation if it got out…..
“What?” Dean asked, already with the ‘don’t-talk-to-me-or-I’ll-hurt-you’ voice out, locked and loaded.
“Man, that’s messed up. And I thought you looked like such a well rounded guy…”
Shit. Shit.
Ears thumping with the sound of his heart beat, Castiel tried to crawl away soldier-style, to the mouth of the alley they were in. Alistair was making sounds behind him, recovering. Suddenly with a pain like fire, Alistair stomped on Castiel’s leg, pinning him down like a bug. Castiel screamed, tears leaking out of his eyes. “You’re not going anywhere you maggot!”
Sam didn’t say anything back, clearly still giving Dean the cold shoulder. ‘Not that you don’t deserve it,’ chimed a voice in Dean’s head.
“He doesn’t deserve it, you know.” She continued, like Dean hadn’t talked. “ to have jerks like you bother him. He’s got enough on his plate without it.” What did she know? It wasn’t her business.
When they had made it through an entire grocery-putting-away-session without mention of Novak’s broken arm, Dean started to wonder. Did his dad know? If his dad did know, he would have said something by now. He went upstairs when his dad was done with him and texted Alistar.
Heeeeey guys, so sorry for the late update. As it turns out, I totally forgot that Thanksgiving was on the same day as the time I was supposed to grant you wonderful people a new fix of angst! So I spent all day out of town thinking about how I had failed you!
Jo had a look on her face, probably relating to the comment Dean had made about her family ‘puking glitter and kindness’. anyone who had met Ellen and Ash knew that the statement was far from being even remotely true. While they weren’t exactly mean, Jo’s family weren’t the type to go easy on you either. Okay, maybe they were a little mean, but Dean comforted himself by thinking that was how they showed they liked you.
He was running fast, not caring if other people saw him. He almost made it around a bend to the library when a hand clamped down on the back of his shirt, making him emit an involuntary choking sound. He threw his hands up and tried to keep running and dislodge the grip on his clothes but the person tackled him and he felt his body slam into the cold linoleum.
Monday, May
He didn’t speak. For one thing, he felt that if he did it wouldn’t be anything remotely intelligent, and for another, his throat was still fairly swollen, though it appeared to be better than before at least. His nap hadn’t been restful, but it appeared it had given his body at least enough  time to half way heal one injury.
They had a medium sized boulder for the headstone, and used a hunting knife to carve letters into it as best they could. Sam had done the carving, and some of the letters were a little big, but it looked good. Dean sniffled a bit, but didn’t cry.
“Why should I?” He asked. He wanted to know what she thought.
“No, I’m not overly religious.” Castiel said quietly. Sam looked relieved, and went getting the movie started.
Sam was taking a big swig of orange juice, and his hazel eyes were fixed on Dean’s knuckles. It was far from the first time Dean had sported those types of bruises, and Sam always gave him shit about them. Before Sam could say anything (and he was already opening his mouth), Dean turned and put away the jamb and peanut butter,
Castiel slowly raised his fists as his father mercilessly beat him round the head, not pausing for anything.
He stepped forward and tried to open the door. It swung open easily, without a sound, and his eyes just managed to widen for a second before a hand slammed onto the back of his head and knocked it hard against a locker, making stars burts in front of his eyes. He cried out in surprise and pain, stumbling into the lockers when the hand moved down to his back and pushed him into the metal.
Dean skated through the school day, getting frustrated in math but not much else happened. Then just before last period, he, Alistar and Azazel hurried to the stairwell to freak out Novak. They couldn’t do anything else today.
He had been standing stock still throughout this little speech. Jo was fidgeting with the hem of her peach colored shirt nervously, and kept studying Castiel's, eyes roving up and down his frame. Castiel could barely hold back a groan as his shoulder twinged. He didn’t like this. He didn’t like this at all, Jo could be anyone! He had never seen her before, true, there wasn’t a way she could be lying about that. But that was almost definitely the only real thing she had said to him. He didn’t have time for this. Sighing, he started to walk away again.
He heard Alistair mutter a loud remark about ‘not seeming to have one until this point’ and ignored it. He also ignored the laughs of his other friends in favour of smiling politely at the librarian scanning his book.
As the day progressed, Castiel found that there was no end of tense moments and awkwardness to be had. He felt terribly out of place in this house; no matter how much his old home felt unsafe and empty. Here he was even more out of place, sitting and watching while the younger Winchester walked around, casting unsure glances back at him. He must have dozed a few times, waking up with a start. He still felt terrible. He still wanted to leave. He still had nowhere to go.
Castiel had nothing to say to this. He looked intensely at Alistair, almost a glare he knew. With the last bit of courage he possessed, he spit in Alistair’s face. The other boy jerked back, surprised, and Castiel closed his eyes in a flinch as Alistair swung back round-
Tuesday, April
Dean woke to the beeping of his alarm clock, loud and irritating. He mustered up the will to move, and turned it off. Then he dragged himself out of bed, barely opening his eyes as he moved to the bathroom across the hall.
“Oh, Oh duty?” Dean mocked, “Geez Sam, you wanna get a little more nerdy on me?”
_________________________________________________
He rubbed a spot on the back of his head, and it stung. He must have gotten some of the skin scraped off, but he couldn’t really feel what had happened beyond stings and a raw sensation. When one of the knights of hell had banged his head into the locker his must have hit the padlock pretty hard, because it hadn’t stopped hurting throughout the rest of the school day.
Getting dressed, Castiel put on his usual outfit of a t-shirt, his loose jeans and a belt. He slipped on a grey cardigan too and grabbed his backpack from the floor as he headed downstairs, head still aching.
Dean got closer and awkwardly shifted Castiel upwards from his position on the ground, so his head was shoulder height. It flopped in a way that Dean knew couldn’t be comfortable, How had he not woken up yet? He couldn’t believe he was doing this…
The tears fall. One. Two. Three. Fall on Cas. They make his skin shiny and alive again.
When the pasta and sauce were ready, Dean heated up some frozen green beans in the microwave and called his dad to come and eat. There was a responding “Be down in a minute!” From his dad’s room, and then silence.
Castiel took that to mean ‘If you’re not back by 5, you’re not getting food until lunch tomorrow’ and walked back to his room.
He looked up with terror in his eyes and saw the entire gang was there. Azazel, Alistar, Uriel and Dean. Or as he called them in his head, the knights of hell. His arms were being held back by Uriel, who never did much except for that menial task. Sometimes he laughed, if that counted as doing something.
Dean turned his book over in his hands nervously, having let the mean smile fall from his face. “Come on, I gotta get this book and then we can go.”
Azazel uncapped the marker and Alistair held Castiel’s cast up. Castiel watched in fear as Azazel started drawing on the cast. He stepped back after a few moments and viewed his work. He had written “Get better soon!” In blocky letters and put a smiley face next to it. The smiley face’s smile was too wide, stretching all the way across the face and not stopping. It was creepy.
“Get off of my fucking property.” Zacharia said, kicking the shit out of Castiel's leg for emphasis. Castiel groaned quietly and swiped a few stray tears off of his face before dragging himself to his knees, and then his feet, unlocking the gate fence and staggering away from the house. His father watching emotionlessly from Castiel’s back porch. Castiel’s old back porch. His father’s back porch.
Another movie? This was a little cushier than what Castiel was expecting, but he didn’t argue. Popcorn sounded...okay. He should probably accept the offer, or else wait longer for food and he could feel his stomach clenching already. “Some popcorn...sounds good.”
And before he could really think about what he was doing, Castiel broke into a sprint. He ducked past Alistar, and started sprinting across the parking lot as fast as he could. He almost cried, the pain was unbelievable. It ranged from his head to his calves and only stopped short of his fingers, which were gripping his jingling backpack so hard the knuckles were white.
He didn’t grab anything for breakfast and darted out the door and into a cool spring morning. But as he walked it turned colder, and he was rubbing his arms while his breath fogged out in front of him. The weather could turn sour in the blink of an eye, and it felt like it could snow currently. Cas pulled his cardigan tighter around himself, and cursed the fact that it didn’t have buttons to hold itself closed. A few blocks away from his house, he heard a rumble of an obnoxiously loud car engine behind him, and he turned when it slowed down slightly behind him. His heartbeat started a race when his eyes locked on the beaten up old pickup slowing down near him, with Alistair, Dean and Uriel inside. Dean was sitting shotgun, eyes fixed on Castiel’s and a strange look on his face. Cas looked quickly away from Dean and regretted it when he took in Alistar wearing creepy grin on his face like a disney villain.
Put the broken body back together.
First up on his list was the book “The Watchers” by Dean Koontz. He had read it several times, but enjoyed it just as much each time he did. Second on his list was “Wicked” , a book he had heard a lot about but didn’t know the author’s name. So he would have to look that one up.
Castiel had heard of Harry Potter, of course he had. It was rather popular, even if you were in absolutely no social circles and had little access to quick internet. But he had never really gotten the will to watch it, something that seemed to horrify the young Winchester in ways he couldn’t have anticipated. “No. I never have.” He answered gravely.
“I-nothing. Nothing. I didn’t-nothing.” He let the words stumble out of his mouth, and rushed an apology out after. His father didn't look very happy about it.
He decided to go with the middle option. And yes, he knew he had just stated he wasn’t going to leave the library but desperate times call for desperate measures.
“What?” He growled, swinging around.
Endless blue.
He walked up to the counter and got a ham sandwich with wilted lettuce and a drop of mayonnaise on both sides. He took it, payed what was due and hit the road. He nodded to the same guy on way out. Maybe it was getting a little weird, but he didn’t care.
He got upstairs and changed clunkily into a light blue-ish grey t-shirt, and jeans. The cast made it hard to move right. He put away all his clothes neatly, only finding it a little hard to hang a shirt with one hand. He had adapted since he had broken the other one.
Tears were freely coursing down his cheeks now, and Castiel could barely believe he was standing. Of course, he had been worse than this before. Definitely. He had had his arm broken, for fuck’s sake! But if there was one thing he’d learned from all his years of split lips, aching rib cages and black eyes, was that it always feels worse in the moment.
Castiel had been reading for a while, listening to his mother clang and bang around downstairs. She had gotten after him for doing a bad job sweeping, and found a couple other things to be mad about too. He had walked away from her with a slap and several yelled words.
Dinner was either going to be whatever popcorn was left in Sam and Novak’s stomachs, or a sad ritz crackers- peanut butter concoction. It was probably going to be the latter, unless Sam remembered about their food situation and held the puberty-fueled hunger back for the rest of the night.
“I dunno what you’re talking about.” He lied arily, turning to leave. Jo walked quickly next him, heels of her boots clacking on the dirty linoleum.
He was trailing his hands all over Cas’s face, and pulled his head back to stare back into the dying man’s dull unwavering eyes, which were growing fainter by the moment. Dean felt movement by his side, and looked wretchedly over to find Castiel trying to move his hand, though it still had a metal bolt through the wrist. Dean saw Cas’ face spasm in more pain as the hand fell back again, and Dean snatched it up, being very careful of the bolt. Castiel seemed to relax a smidge, and blinked lazily, and when he opened his eyes he looked seconds from death.
Cas felt his heart beat out of his chest as his mother’s footsteps suddenly clacked up the stairs, and she threw open the door to his room wearing a scowl big on her face. Castiel’s expression was close to fear, more surprised because she had thrown his door open so hard it had hit the wall with a sharp thud. She did that a lot but it never seemed to fail at surprising Castiel.
She fixed her foggy gaze on Cas, scowling on instinct. He swallowed and looked at the microwave. She slammed her purse down in the table, and looked around the kitchen. She glared at Castiel as he grabbed his food out of the microwave.
His mother stared straight at the road, her music playing loudly through the car. Something Castiel didn’t recognize, but he strongly suspected was a Miley Cyrus song was currently oozing through the speakers. Castiel watched as they passed the high school, and winced when he caught a glimpse of the athletic boys playing out on the field. Dean and Azazel were probably there, inflicting their presence on the other less popular boys who crowded around them like pigeons to a piece of bread.
Castiel swallowed a lump of carrot horribly fast, and hurried to answer. “it’s…..good.” He answered painfully awkwardly.
“Yes, it is. Now please, I’m just trying to get through my day, and I don’t need another bruise.” He turned as if proving his point, showing Jo his purple black face in all its glory. She winced a little.
Before he could get a word in, Jo continued, in a soft dangerous tone. “I found your friend, your buddy Alistair, holding Castiel under the water. When I got there, Castiel wasn’t moving. The person you left to fate was passed out under the water, and your fucking friend was just holding him under, and you know what? He was laughing while he did it. So I did what a decent human and friend would always do, I went and I got that fucking demented creature away from him, and I had to pull his body out of the fucking water, and I had to get him to breathe again. I was this close-” she pinched her fingers together and jerked them in his face- “to calling an ambulance when he woke up. But my friend Castiel, even though he had just been attacked, even though some fucking dickbag idiots had jumped him and almost FUCKING killed him, didn’t want to cause any trouble. Didn’t let me call the ambulance, didn’t let you morons get into trouble you deserve, and went home with a swollen neck, fucking gashes on his head. And believe me Dean Winchester, even though you are my relative, even though we sometimes share a house, even though every birthday party I’ve ever had you sing me a Beatles song, I would’ve sold you out to the cops like that.” Jo snapped her fingers, it sounded like a gunshot in the silence. “Because no one, absolutely fucking no one who does such horrible things, is my family.”  Jo said savagely. The room was silent. Sam watched from his doorway, shocked and angry.
Castiel was leaning against the lockers, trying to be as far away from them as he could, but it was a small comfort. He saw Uriel looking at the clock and took a chance.
After being turned away from several churches, once because he looked too rough, once because there was no homeless shelter or anything like it, he was on his way up to a big catholic building with a red brick spire rising out the roof. A promising sign around the side talked about free soup on certain days, and he hoped someone in the building could find it in their hearts to lend him a first aid kit and a bathroom.
And right on queue, Castiel’s mother’s footsteps sounded on the stairs, and she descended with a case of bedhead in a big bad way, and a robe wrapped around her that she was still tying. She glared at him, then fixed her gaze on the food on the table and loitered to it, not looking at Castiel again. Castiel fixed his gaze to the floor, furrowing his eyebrows in vexation. She never thanked him, and no matter how many times he had made her breakfast it always stung a bit that he had done all of it for her time and time again and he never even got a “Thanks” muttered out the side of her mouth. Not anything new.
He was at the arcade. Due to the high stress-nature of his life recently he thought that sacrificing a few dollars in the name of relaxation was justified. Besides, he could take out all his pent-up anger on the pin ball machines. No one said there was a limit to how hard you could hit the buttons on the sides, right? He hoped Sam was smart enough to get food for him and the invalid, because otherwise they were just sitting at home, hungry and being awkward. He hadn’t gotten to the store yet, but he was going to right after his quarters ran out. The longer he was out of the house-- well, he would say ‘the better’, but then again he wasn’t sure if Sam and Novak were okay alone, was he? Oh, he didn’t think Sam would have any trouble entertaining, he’d sort somethin’ out in no time. But suppose Novak tried to make some misguided violent break for it? Suppose he thought he was being held hostage, and knocked Sam over the head with a lamp, quickly clambering out the door with all the money he somehow found around the house and the last of the food; desperate to make a living by himself, thus preserving his pride?
“Nah.” Azazel answered, and didn’t say anything else. The guy could end a conversation with one syllable.
“Sorry about going on and on like this, but I think it’s kind of a crime. I mean, what were your parents thinking?” Then Sam seemed to backtrack- “Wait- you’re not like- you can watch it right? You’re not one of those religious people who don’t like magic and shit?” He asked anxiously, “Because- I don’t- if you are, then we can-”
He finally murmured “Screw you.” In a detached voice, not listening to the other’s responses. He waited until the bell rang to get stand gracefully from his seat and straide to the door, watching the smaller teenagers cleave a pat through the crowd to let him by.
Castiel’s pen started to move under his fingers.
He stepped into the living room, trying to be quiet. If she was in the house, then she wouldn’t want him bothering her. So he walked around on his toes. He was moving around the couch when he lost his balance momentarily, and since he didn’t have both arms to brace himself on furniture, landed noisily on his knees. He sat there stalk-still, waiting to hear his mother yell from the other room.
He turned around the car in a highly illegal U-turn, speeding down the pavement to the fancy-neighborhood Novak lived in. He hoped to the heavens this could be over quickly.
Castiel coughed, his throat sore. “Tomorrow.” He said scratchily, hoping dean didn’t punch him again. Dean fingers were digging into his cheeks and chin. He just wanted to be let go.
He could still hear them talking through the open window, and flinched hard as he heard a glass bottle shatter against the porch, and liquid, (probably beer) splashed against the side of the house. There were several more crashes, and he jumped at all of them. Outside, they were very amused by the vandalization, with raucous laughter blasting through the night air. Castiel headed upstairs when he heard the group responding to a neighbor who had started telling them off.
“Honey, you look like you’re hurt pretty bad. Are you sure you just want to walk around like that?” She persisted.
Soon his shower was over, and he got dressed and headed out.
They had gotten back to the bunker hours later, when dawn was breaking and the air was crisp and clean. Both of them were silent, with the body of a loved one in the back seat and grief still fresh in the air. Dean was still crying a bit.
After he was done doing random things in his room, like fixing the belt buckle that he’d been procrastinating on for months, he walked out and joined them.
He had just walked out of Bobby’s old front door, and was cruising in the impala away from his first employer. He had asked, politely, nicely, like a good boy would, for a job. Something to do with cars, preferably. Bobby had a little auto shop in a small town next to theirs; where Dean and Sam had spent large chunks of their childhood being bored in his smokey office and annoying the part-time college students working there. Since their luck with money had officially run out, Dean had finally muscled up and threw away his pride. Bobby had surprised him this time though. He was fairly gracious, even giving Dean $25 for groceries this week, telling him to stop by Thursday for his first day. So. Now Dean had a job. He didn’t know how much he was going to be paid, where he would be put, how long his hours were or what time on Thursday to show up.
He spent the rest of his time in the kitchen fuming less and less until only pathetic emotions like worry and guilt were left behind. Finishing up dinner, he served the cheesy-noodle-macaroni-and-cheese-and-marshmallow-hybrid into two bowls and left one on the table for Sam. He wasn’t taking it his room, so if the kid wanted dinner he was going to have to come out of his cave and get some. Dean himself walked into the bare living room and turned on the big tube television, and sliding Star Wars: A New Hope into the VHS player. Yes, yes, old and clunky as it was, he and Sam had no cable or DVD player to speak of, so they just worked with the cards they were dealt. Equipped with the VHS player and a library of tapes to go with it, he and Sam could quote every Star Wars movie while they played, they had memorized The Princess Bride, and could play every scene of Harry Potter in their minds. Mainly they grabbed tapes from fifty-cent piles at resale, or if someone was throwing them out they would speak up and claim what they didn’t already have. Two bookshelves full of the large plastic cases were propped against the bare walls of their living room. They each had their favorites, and took turns choosing movies on different nights of the week, which often ended in arguments because Sam wanted to watch ‘Good-fucking-Will Hunting again’.
He watched disinterestedly as an attractive lady talked about a donut factory in New York City getting robbed. It was amazingly boring, but in case anything big had happened, he watched it anyways.
“Ok, ok.” She conceded, throwing her hands up in what seemed like defeat. “But can I have help before lunch is over?”
He felt sick as he tried to justify himself to Jo, the lie bitter in his mouth,“No one was supposed to get hurt-” She cut him off with a slap to the face, her fingernails scratched his cheek as the sound bit through the house.
Focus. Organize your thoughts. He tried to think of any spots or people that he could sleep at, or would take him in. Unfortunately, as much as he’d thought of running away, he hadn’t thought as much about shelter when he needed to rest. Jo would probably take him in for a few hours, before she would inevitably tire of him. He couldn’t think of anyone else in the town who would even think of housing him. He knew he had some relatives in Northern Indiana who were not on the best of terms with his father. Relatively close, only one or two states to the left. He could try and hitchhike over there, after a time. He should try to build up some money for food before he tried to leave the state, though how he would he had no idea. It wasn’t like he had friends. He unofficially had no address. He would probably have to find a homeless shelter somewhere and plead for funds over a bowl of free soup. Going back to his house and begging for his father’s mercy was an option, though barely. He had no doubt that he would be turned away, though with a lot of groveling he would be allowed meager shelter, back in the basement. A horrible thought. Castiel didn’t think he could survive a night in the basement again.
Shaking off memories, Castiel started paying attention to where his experienced feet were leading him. Somewhere near downtown, he was walking past neighborhoods and dead end house-lined streets, some full of lace curtains and flower pots, some full of kid’s bikes and sidewalk drawings drying in the lukewarm spring sun. He remembered when he was younger, and his mother had friends, and while their mothers talked he and another rich child would swap stories and fantasies while tracing scribbles on the pavement. So long ago was this, he could barely picture it. It must've been nice. It was before the drink got his mother, before his father used the basement as often as his fist.
Soon, the black head flew into view. He seemed to be running, trying to get past them without incident. No matter how many times he tried that, it never worked and he never learned. There was a bright blue blur on his arm. He must be carrying books. Alistair grabs him, jumping out from behind the wall and Castiel yells a little in surprise and pain. He almost shrieks as Alistar goes to pull his arm back, and Dean sees that he’s not carrying books. He has a big blue cast on his left arm. Alistar lets go of his arm at the sound, and looks in surprise. Dean is surprised too, and wonders if Cas broke his arm at the bridge yesterday. Well, of course he did. How else would he have? Their parents were getting sued for sure.
“‘What do you mean mother’s dead?’” Zacharia mocked in a high pitched imitation. “What the fuck do you think I mean? I sent the lazy bitch out to do some shopping, and she shish kabobed herself on a lamp pole! Finally got rid of the cunt, and so now it’s time I got rid of you. By the way, that little stunt you pulled yesterday, with the ignoring me? Not making you any friends.”
Cut the thread. Carefully, slowly.
_____________________
He had gotten away before they had time to graffiti his cast again, which was good because his marker was running out of ink and he would have to find a better way to cover up the pictures, and soon. They probably had a different colour sharpie for when they black covered the entire surface and they had nowhere else to draw. Thank goodness he was getting his cast off tomorrow.
_______________
“After you.”
“Skipping school? Tsk, tsk. I thought you were better than that Castiel!” Alistair turned back to Cas, who was still struggling to get away but not as hard as before. He looked resigned. Alistair still hadn’t noticed Castiel’s cast was off, the lack of black plaster was glaringly obvious to Dean, but maybe not so much to Alistair.
Castiel was almost to the library door, and he was sick of this shit. If what she was saying was true, he was going to have a lunch buddy if he didn’t deal with her now. Some people could be persistent if they wanted too, that he knew. He turned around and glared at he the hardest he could, through his slightly swollen eyelid. “Go away tomorrow if I sit with you today.”
Castiel looked at Dean again, and jumped when he met Dean’s green eyes. Staring at him, Dean had his hands in his pockets and was walking to cas slowly, like he knew Cas could either fight his way through the crowd, or run past Dean before he could catch him.
Eyelashes. Nose. Stitches.
Inside, Zacharia was standing near the dining room table, hunched over his phone and stationary. Castiel didn’t linger before he turned back to the task of dragging the suitcase up the wooden stairs.
Castiel woke a short while later, and seemed a little disgruntled that Dean was still there, which made him happy. At least Novak wasn’t losing sense of who was in charge here, no matter how many squishy remorseful feelings Dean was being forced to have.
And then, when he lay down to sleep at night, it all came out. His heart explodes with the emotion he suppressed all day. The first time, he just lay there and thought about how awful his life was, and how he could prevent a repeat of today. Another time, after a particularly crappy day at school where he had gotten shoved into the same stair rail 3 times, and pushed into a locker, he had lain in bed and cried.
“And even if you had said anything like that, you would be lying anyways. Because I’m a thousand percent sure that you are too much of a helpless loser to attract anything other than pity for your worthless life.” Finality in his father’s tone made the point of halting the conversation. Castiel simply looked down at his food.
___________________________
“Can I sit here?” She asked, pointing to the chair she had parked her black backpack in front of. Castiel gave a hesitant nod. She skooted the chair back and sat right in front of him, with her hands folded leisurely on the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel was almost annoyed by the persistence of the boy. It was strange….was it normal to be annoyed when people wanted to show you something so much they paused it for you when you passed out? It was especially strange to be feeling this way about Winchester’s little brother. It appeared that the family was a little more diverse in their ideas of having fun.
He was dragged upwards through the water, the hand still vice-like on his throat. He gasped in a great lungful of air, his lungs burning and his body feeling weak, coughing and limp. He could hear the laughs echoing through the room as he shuddered, and glared at the closest blurry thing he could see.
Time sped up until Alistair was suddenly on top of him, and Castiel couldn’t breath, his side was creaking and his face was bleeding, and Alistair was hissing words into the air like poison darts. “Just because I can’t fuck you know doesn’t mean you’re getting away that easy. I;m gonna find you again, Cassy, and next time you’re gonna take it up the ass so hard my dick’ll stick out of your mouth.” Alistair groped Cas’s ass roughly. He was so tired, he could barely thrash. The fingers dug painfully into him like knives. Alistair’s boner was prominent, pressing on Castiel’s chest like an anvil. “I know you want me to, you dirty little whore. Has daddy been getting you ready when he’s at home? Or are you still virgin tight-” Castiel could barely hear the words through his disgust, but what he did catch rang around his skull, sharp and stabbing. He felt like gagging at the thought of everything Alistair was implying, that his father would rape him, that Castiel would let Alistair have him-
Trenchcoat. Tie. White. Black. Blue.
Castiel was dying.
In math, he carefully avoided looking at Azazel. He didn’t look anywhere except his paper, carefully training his gaze. He left in a hurry, and fast-walked to his locker. He didn’t walk past any stair wells until last period, and that was where they normally harassed him. There were no classrooms opposite the stairwell, so no teachers to witness the knights of hell pushing Cas over, or kicking him in the back and making him drop his books.
When he stepped into the steaming hot water, he felt his head getting clearer. He always had to take a shower in the morning to make himself feel human, not like a living fungus ripped out of bed and shoved into school. At least it was friday.
“--we’ve got a duty!” Sam continued, “And it’s not really mine, but it’s sure as hell yours Dean! Letting him stay is the right freaking thing to do and I’m not just gonna kick him out because you don’t feel like playing host to someone you don’t like!”
His father’s visit had been pushed back, and he hadn’t been home in over a month. Castiel wasn’t even sure if he knew about his broken arm, or if he cared. Probably not. In any case, his father was going to arrive at their house the day after he gets his cast off.
“Thanks Naomi! You were great!” Alistar.
Castiel was halfway to the stairs when his father walked out of the kitchen. “Hold it!” the balding man ordered.
I love all of you, thank you for reading my story for so long!
But he gave up thought of his condition for getting to the shower. He grabbed a dry towel from his floor and made his slow way to the bathroom.
“Nice. I like it.”
He walked out to his room, looking at his mother’s door, which would be closed until she woke up at 10:30. At least Cas hoped she would wake at 10:30, he dreaded the thought of waking her himself to do something for him. But if he had to do it to get to the hospital in time, he would.
The blue eyed boy made it to his feet, staggering away from Dean and the pool. The Knights watched in apparent amusement as Castiel struggled to catch his breath. His ribs were still groaning under his skin, irritated and angry at him. ‘“You’re not getting out of this one, you can’t pull another stunt like the one you did yesterday.” Dean said conversationally. “Which, by the way, was quite stupid of you.”

When his dad finds about the whole Novak thing, he was going to flip his shit. He had a bad temper when he wasn’t drinking, the alcohol only amplified it. Dean had been on the receiving end of the temper too many times, though it was his fault for pushing. Dean called for Sam before he remembered he was at a friend’s house helping him study. Dean was glad he would probably be out of the house when Dad came home, he didn’t like it when Sam had to see him that angry.
Sam’s face fell for a second, but it was back up again after a disappointed sigh and a disconsolate look at the table top. Dean’s heart panged, but in  a few moments Sam was back to his story about sciency mumbo-jumbo that Dean didn’t really understand, but he nodded along like he did. Science was never his forte. But he could still manage to look interested as Sam jabbered on, flipping his hair out of his face while he did. Someday, Dean was going to force him down, tie him to his chair and give him a proper haircut. His heart panged, longing for that time to come quickly.
Dean didn’t see what Alistair wrote because the moment he was done Castiel wriggled around him and fled to his next class. When he left Dean and his friends quickly exchanged a few words about how much of a pussy Castiel was, and then dashed off to their respective classes.
“Sorry.” He said, in a slightly defensive tone he tried to hide, but not very successfully.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Dean said firmly, hoping she would just drop the subject and give him his book, but she was taking her sweet time with the computer.
“Would your pops have the number?” Dean wondered aloud.
When the impala’s wheels ground to a halt, Dean slammed the door open hard enough to break it and wrenched it shut just as hard. He pounded off to the cabin hidden behind thick foliage and trees and whatever else roamed the forest at that time of night. Sam hurriedly ran to the trunk and snatched two shotguns and a flask of holy water to arm themselves. He didn’t bother yelling for Dean to wait, he knew that the man wouldn’t listen.
Sam was there, and he said “Morning! Came to see if you were awake yet. Bus comes in 5 minutes.”
“Yes. They are good. Most likely you will not see them...as they live far from here. I don’t see them very often. So….” He felt like he was getting better at this whole ‘make it up as you go along thing’.
enjoy some of Dean's POV at the end of the chapter!
“Nothing's happening. Nothing I haven’t told you before. I just fell. That is the truth. Some assholes tied me up and I fell.” He clenched his jaw.
“Oh I’m not! I would never do that to you! I just want some help with my locker, Cas, I swear.” Her eyes were wide with what seemed like honesty.
Castiel stood awkwardly, not really knowing what to say. “Sorry…” He ventured, and she sighed dramatically.
He stripped out of his clothes until he was only wearing his boxers, and then sat on the bed feeling exhausted. The covers wrinkled under his legs were cold, and they felt good against his bruises. Cas kneaded at his arm, rubbing at the red sore spot where the ink had been. He was beginning to develop a habit of doing that. He sat there rubbing his arm for a few minutes in silence, mind blank and tired and sad. He didn’t know why he was sad particularly. He just was.
On Sunday mornings, you could always count on his mother to sleep in to one in the afternoon.
“Yeah. Really.” He matched her scepticism with annoyance that could make your hair fall out. “I haven’t seen him since yesterday.”
They didn’t give Castiel a hunter’s burial, consequences be damned. It seemed too wrong to burn the body after how the life had been taken, and they buried it in a nice spot in the woods near the bunker. It was Dean’s favourite place to come, where the trees were just thin enough that light would shine through, but you couldn’t see the sky through the leafs. You could always hear the stream babbling, and plants rustling or animals moving through the foliage. They lied  him to rest near a patch of wildflowers, hopefully those would cover the grave in time. Dean had looked them up later to find they were called ‘Delphinium’, bright blue tiny flowers growing in bunches.
Castiel carefully crept to the door, turning the cold handle and opening it as slowly as he could. Only a tiny creak sounded as he slipped out, into the dark hallway. As quickly and as quietly as he could manage, he crept down the stairs, pausing every so often to listen for Zachariah. His ears buzzed in the silence as he stepped through the dark house, past the doorframe and into the kitchen. The cabinet was there. And hopefully the duct tape was too. What if it wasn’t there, and he got caught downstairs for no reason? His father really did have hearing like a hawk’s. Suddenly Castiel was beginning to regret this little journey.
He had to get to the library sometime. Castiel only had one book to read, and it was for school. Uninteresting and about the cold war. Castiel needed to read something Stephen King or Dean Koontz. Something non educational and mostly mindless, to take his mind off the real world and into a fantasy one.
“Yeah well, maybe I’m just doin’ this to ease my conscious.” Dean shot back, starting to walk away.
He wished he had a book. He wished he had his library card. He wished that he had a jacket to fend off the soon to come cold weather, and the stares of strangers on the streets. He wished he had a house, where the people who occupied it with him liked him and treated him fairly. He wished he had a friend.
At home they went to their own things. It looked like Dean going to have to go out and buy some more shaving cream if he wanted to continue having a chin that didn’t look mouldy. Maybe he could pick up some beer too, if he went to that one drugstore on the corner of Richter and 2nd. He could either go now, and get it done with, or spend the rest of the evening trying to simultaneously avoid and annoy Sam. He made up his decision.
Apart from the fact that he had been embarrassed at his place of sanctuary, his father was coming home in three days. It may not sound so bad scrawled on a day in a calendar, but when the prospect of having him in the house was looming, it cast a shadow on any emotions. Castiel could feel nervousness roiling in his stomach.
When they finally stopped in front of a locker, she smiled at him and said, “Well this is it. It won’t open.”
As she clicked at a computer on the desk, the young woman asked, “So what were you laughing at Castiel for?” in a neutral voice.
Castiel puzzled over her words for a moment, before he walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. He realized in surprise that one of the larger cuts on his face was bleeding, steadily sending a little ribbon of blood across his cheek. Any farther and it would have been bleeding all over his house, and he would have had a tough time cleaning it up before his father came home. He sighed softly in relief at the close call, mopped up his face with a bit of toilet paper, then stuck a bandaid on the cut. He scrubbed at the letters on his arm, rubbing the ink off with soap before he would forget. Then he walked out of the bathroom, and grabbed a broom from the closet to start cleaning.
Finally, he was dragged/lifted through the door to the pool. The greenish water lapped lazily around in it’s tiny concrete cage, full of chlorine and pee and whatever else was in a High School pool. The Knight’s laughs echoed around the damp room, hitting the walls and reverberating in the way only found in rooms like this. Winchester dragged Castiel to the edge and shoved him to his knees at the very ledge, keeping his hand on his head to restrain any escape attempts. If Castiel leaned forward at all he would fall into the deep end of the pool, which was only seven feet, but Castiel didn’t much like the idea of getting soaked before his trek home. He didn’t like the way this was going, not one bit.
But hold on, who said she figured it out? Castiel’s brain asked itself. There was no proof she knew anything. She was looking at an old bruise, one the Knights could have easily given him. He was probably just freaking out over nothing. Probably.
Castiel flinched when his father took a big step forward, towering over him. Zachariah had to be at least over six feet. His thick fingers started playing with a lock of Castiel’s hair, petting it softly. “I just was looking for something. I’m sorry, it won’t happen again.” He whispered. He knew it was pointless. Revulsion made him shudder as his father continued fingering his hair.
He just noticed as he walked down the bustling hallway that Winchester was talking to a freshmen on his right, not looking altogether friendly. As Castiel hurriedly passed, Winchester looked right at him until Castiel was out of his line of sight. The look was cold, reminiscent of a glare, and it didn’t exactly warm Castiel’s heart as he watched the fist bunched in the freshmen’s collar tighten until the knuckles turned white. There was a bruise on Winchester’s cheek, the size of an apple. Castiel wondered if Alistair had given his buddy that for interfering yesterday.
______________________
Two days after Jo talked to him, Dean and Sam were driving home from school. Sam hadn’t stopped ignoring him, except to write down little messages on the legal pad he now kept handy if it was absolutely necessary. Dean had suffered the complete loss of conversation from his little brother for a whole of three and a half days, and he was getting damn tired of it. While the pit of seemingly endless stress in his stomach hadn’t eased up either, he found the determined and silent set of Sam’s jaw to be just a smidge more annoying. The legal pad was the only response he got- apart from the heated glares dished out when Dean chose to be particularly annoying at times. The only perk to Sam being mute was that he could sing anything, anytime, anyvolume, and Sam couldn’t verbally complain.
He woke up suddenly, with a sharp intake of breath that made him cough weakly. Fear washed through his hair to his toes, probably making him sweaty. But he couldn’t feel anything outside the general cocoon of nastiness he always felt when he woke up covered in his own blood and drool on the kitchen floor.
He thrashed and thrashed, but he was getting weaker and weaker. His head was starting to hurt. He opened his eyes into slits and the over-chlorinated water burned them. His lungs felt like balloons, they were full to the bursting point for his need for oxygen and soon they were going to pop.
Dean was still kind of impressed by how much Castiel fought. He had almost  almost slipped out of their fingers a few times, but never quite got as far away as he needed to to  escape properly. It had been fun, getting him there. The first couple of dunks had been exhilarating. Every punch Dean landed was like a boost to his confidence. But then those feelings started fading as he watched Alistair hold Novak under the water for increasingly long amounts of time, barely letting the RichDick breath before shoving him under. And as much as Dean enjoyed a good hazing, this was edging a little too close to manslaughter for him to stand. What if they got caught? What if Novak passed out while he was still under? What if he died, and his loaded parents sued the school and the people responsible? His dad would fucking kill Dean. Guilt might have also had a part in his mutiny, but he tried not to acknowledge it.
Getting his shirt off was like stabbing himself again and again. He actually let a few tears slip away, the heat in his chest was so intense. But soon the worst was over and he hastily wiped away the shimmer on his cheeks. Getting off his jeans and boxers was easy, just unbutton the jeans and sort of shrug them off. Basically the same for the boxers.
When the title appeared on screen and the music started playing, he sat back against his headboard and watched raptly as the dramatic episode unfolded. No matter how many times he watched it, he never got tired. Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles were always there with witty things to say and bad guys to dismember. Dependable. Right now, far too little good things aren't dependable in Castiel’s life, and far too many bad ones were. Like the knights of hell torturing him, or his mother ignoring him, or his father being abusive. Castiel snapped himself out of his thoughts quickly before he ruined his time to watch TV.
In the kitchen, Dean half listened to Sam talk about his science fair project while making them both lunch. PB and J’s all around, with roughly peeled carrots sticks as a side. Sam paused his story long enough to ask for a capri sun, but Dean had to disappoint him on that one.
Hesitation. Novak looked torn, and Sam, who seemed to be watching the conversation from across the room answered for him; “I think we’re all a bit tired Dean. Let’s just have dinner and do the thing tomorrow?”
He kneeled and started picking up glass with one hand, dropping it into the bucket beside him with a loud clink. He did this until most of the bigger shards were picked up, and then grabbed his rag and started wiping down the side of the house. He wiped until the porch nearest the front door was clear, then he moved off the porch and wiped wherever he spied glass below.
Castiel shook his head. “I’ll tell...my parents.” He lied, wry amusement flashing through him. Like his parents would do anything. But he couldn’t have Jo telling anyone, it would get out to the whole school and things would just get worse.
When he had walked around in circles for roughly three minutes, and he felt like throwing up, he put cream and sugar in his tea and took it to the living room.
“Wanna do it tonight?”
Angel of the Lord
YOOOOO I'm on TIME! Bathe in this glorious moment.  I feel like this one is a little bit shorter than the others, but oh well. What can ya do? Also, I am TWO PAGES away from this being a 200 page novel. Drink that in guys.
He stopped walking when he got to a rougher part of the area, looking around regretfully when he noticed the spray paint on the walls and carpet of cigarette butts. He hadn’t meant to come this far, and luckily he wasn’t too far from somewhere safer. He walked into an empty alleyway shielded from the cold wind, and rested. Leaning against the wall hurt too much, so Castiel settled for sort of sagging where he stood. It was really too cold for June, but he comforted himself with the idea that it couldn’t get much chillier. Gooseflesh prickled on his arms, prickly.
As he walked past an alleyway between the cafe and the diner next door, Dean looked by chance into it and his eyes caught on a pair of feet. Feet with shoes on them. Lying, unmoving in the ally, blocked partially by the large dumpster next to Dean. He bit into his sandwich wearily. Did he want to get mixed up in this? Fuck it. He walked forward cautiously, tossing the piece of crap bread-and-lettuce concoction into the garbage on his way.
Later, at the store, Dean walked up and down the isles. He grabbed a bottle of popcorn kernels. Canned green beans. Pasta, half off. White bread. Frozen corn, half off. Milk. Cereal. Butter. Frozen dinners, four of them. A four-pack of toilet paper. Three Frozen Pizzas, and then the money ran out. He had to put aside a bottle of coke he got at the register because it was too much, but he’d done that so many times his face hardly tinged red. He just packed up and left.

Castiel waded along until he was pulled into a headlock from behind. He sighed out loud as his bag was ripped from his shoulders and tossed into the sea of students, many of which glared at him as if it was his fault they were being bombarded with school books. Alistar’s arm tightened constricting around his neck and he chuckled. Castiel just hung limp, fighting was useless in this stage. Maybe if he got out of the headlock?
He internally smacked himself across the face as he clutched around in the cabinet for the tape, but he knew that he wouldn’t find it. He had no idea where it could be, unless his father had found it and taken it to his tool box in the garage, in which case Castiel was NOT going to to sneak in there and take it back. He could not believe he went downstairs for this! It was just his luck. He shouldn’t have expected to find the tape so easily, living his life.
Some of his best work.
“Hey son?” Castiel was slapped hard across the face. “Get up, you fucker.”
He was waiting for it to finish again, when his mother banged through the back door. She smelt of alcohol and urine, and he knew she had been out all night clubbing and going to bars. He just hoped she hadn’t been with any other men, as that would have ended badly for both of them.
On the bus ride home Dean thought about Castiel’s cast, and how much trouble he was going to be in when he got home. They hadn’t done it on school property, so there was not much the principal could do besides call his dad and have him and Mrs. Novak duke it out. Which meant it could get pretty scary.
The smell of nearly-burning garlic bread greeted him when he stepped out into the hall, and he hurried down the stairs to the oven before it had a chance to burn completely on him.
________________
“Some water would be good.” Castiel ignored the other questions, hoping the younger Winchester would just shut up and sit down. Thankfully, the floppy haired boy went off to the kitchen shortly.
“It’s not my fault you’re a grouchy pants.” Jo responded with a bright smile. “I’m gonna sit here anyways.” She gave him a once over, eyes roving over everything she could see over the table.
“So, you and sleeping beauty have been doing what, exactly, while I was gone?” Dean asked, eyeing the still sleeping Novak.
Castiel clamped everything shut, determined not to give into the water again. He scratched at Alistar’s hands with his nails, digging as hard as he could to no avail. He tried to dive into the water, at which Alistar removed one hand and clamped it around Castiel’s throat, squeezing harder and harder until Castiel stopped struggling for a moment. Then he resumed, simply trying to throw himself as far as he could in any direction, before Alistar squeezed his throat hard enough to dent it, and he knew he’d have bruising in the morning. If he survived to the morning. His heart beat faster and faster as though some tiny racer with a riding crop were beating it and telling it to speed up. His lungs were bursting again.
In his room he resumed his book again, but instead of sitting on the bed he walked around and around the room. Like pacing, but without the thought. He read about 4 chapters, before he started thinking things while he was reading. When was his father coming home again? He had better find out, so as not to be taken surprise by the sudden appearance. His father came into the house like a thunderstorm, making the air stuffy and casting a shadow around the rooms. He should probably go look at the calendar sometime, and see when he was due home next. But later, because he didn’t feel like leaving his room. His mother always wrote “Zacharia home” On the days when his father was coming. Castiel suspected she did it for the same purpose; so she wouldn’t be caught by surprise with two bottles of beer and a hangover.
“Dean, just because I’m younger than you, and I haven’t smoked or kicked puppies yet doesn’t mean I’m stupid, or unable to see obvious things. I can’t believe you would just hurt and go after someone who’s done nothing to you! I mean, what did he do. Steal something from you in fifth grade? Or did he insult Alistair or Azazel?” Sam asked, eyes hard. “I want a reason Dean. That’s all.
He grabbed a black t shirt and pulled it on, almost jumping into bed because he only had boxers and a t shirt on and it was cold in his room.
"Well, in any event, you need to learn a lesson. Remember Novak, it does no good to gloat."
“Okay. My little brother Ash, he’s like, a prodigy. The next Van Gogh. We keep trying to get him to take classes but he just wants to learn on his own. I think he could really improve a lot, if he would take some. Maybe get a job at some big comic book place, like Marvel or something. Maybe pay for my college. That would be helpful.” She finished with humour and just a hint of bitterness in her voice.
He entered the living room, doing his best be quiet, to find a short, white middle-aged woman vacuuming his living room rug. She wore a light blue plain dress, and her hair was done up in a graying perm. There was a bucket of cleaning supplies sitting near the couch, and she was listening to earbuds while dragging their hulking car of a vacuum across black shag.
Pale dead skin covers equally dead flesh. One black string stitch at a time, until Dean cannot see the pretty red pink anymore.
The sound coming from Castiel’s mouth started to fade, and he was thrashing his head back and forth, trying to get away from the hurt consuming his body, and Dean had tears streaming down his face as he watched pieces of Castiel’s shirt fall burning to the floor. Most of his body was black, but his face was being mainly spared, so Dean could see every tear tracking down Cas’ face, every twist in his expression.
Not too close.
“Woah there skeletor!”
He woke abruptly, foggy and with his heart racing like a NASCAR driver, with memory of a fantastically horrifying nightmare on the front of his mind. Sweat was soaking the back of his shirt, colder than it should be. He looked up into maliciously happy eyes, and with a lurch his stomach threatened to upend itself again. Was he still in the nightmare? He could be. It felt so real… If he was truly asleep, his subconscious had rendered the exact shade of pale, icy blue that Alistair’s eyes were. It had also shaped them exactly right, in just the mix of malice and amusement, like a boy kicking a puppy. Or tearing the wings off a butterfly.
In the end, Castiel had given up trying to watch Buffy because 1) The vacuuming downstairs was drowning out the sound from his computer’s weak speakers, and 2) His computer quit halfway through the episode and he didn’t feel like restarting it.
“Sure.” He answered.
It seemed longer than the other times, maybe it was just because it was all he could do to not breath any more water. The burn for air was like an itch that needed to be scratched, it was an involuntary impulse to pull in through his nose. He had about as much control over it as the beating of his heart.
Cas had fallen gracelessly to the floor, where he sat glaring up at whoever he could make eye contact with.
He settled into his blankets and fell asleep thinking about getting his cast off, and trying not to think about his father coming home.
Sam wants to burn Cas. Barbaric. Terrible.
“Hey? Hello? Earth to Castiel?” Jo was waving her hand in front of his face. He leaned away from it quickly and she put it down, looking vaguely annoyed. “You drifted off there a moment. Are you alright?”
“I’m ok. Is there anything you wanted?” She wasn’t part of the knights of hell as far as he knew, but they were always picking up new toadies and recruits, thought they never lasted long.
Easier said than done.
He sat back to watch the movie, trying to immerse himself in the iconic opening music before his crappy dinner could get cold.
She glanced at him disinterestedly while making her way slowly to the kitchen, barely tipping her head to acknowledge him. He waved a little, regretting it instantly because of how stupid it probably looked, but what was done was done.
“So.” started Alistair quickly. “Here’s the deal. You can stay here, in the cold,” He mimed shivering, pouching out his cheeks and clattering his teeth together loudly. “- rotting, pissing in allies and stealing food from old ladies. Or-” He held up one finger. “You could help me out with a little problem.”
Happy Holidays! Thanks to every one of you that read my story, I am so happy that you do. This chapter's pretty long, it's like an unintentional Christmas Gift!
His dad watched him pick apart the limp green vegetables before asking him, “Dean, is anything wrong?” Dean looked up, heart beating fast.
“Yes?” He asked, hoping she wasn’t about to chew him out for breaking his arm.
He locked the journal up again and put it under his mattress. Then he turned off his light, and went to bed fully clothed. He didn’t really care, he would just throw them in the dirty laundry tomorrow.
He was engrossed in it from the moment the theme song wheezed out, and he watched the TARDIS whorle through the time vortex on screen. He rubbed his eyes, thinking about what would happen if Winchester and the other knights found out he was watching such a “Nerdy” show. They could make him eat a calculator and he wouldn’t be able to fight back, he was that weak. His mood shifted lower as he realized exactly how much power they had over him.
“They tied you up? And you let them?” She asked incredulously, like it was his fault.
“Oh, you sound like you’re a little hurt. Who did that to you, Cassy?” Alistair asked, whining with fake sympathy. “Was it me?” Castiel kept his eyes exactly where they were, determined not to let the bully see too much of his fear. “No, it wasn’t.” Alistair sighed. “I know it wasn’t Dean, he’s been home. He woulda told me if he’d got you again.” He sounded thoughtful, and Castiel wondered why he noticed. Surely he always looked on the verge of death? With how much he was treated like a punching bag, surely these bruises weren’t anything new to Alistar?
After he laid out the silverware, he brought the food from the kitchen to the table. Then he went to find his parents.
Suddenly it seemed rather unimportant that the cast was taken off before his father came home. It wasn’t like Castiel could defend himself any better without it than when it was on! And it wasn’t like he was going to hit his father, but it was generally nice to have two hands to block his angry fists and feet. But His father did not take punishments lightly, and it took more than a few blocked punches and kicks to save Castiel from his wrath.
“What, didn’t think to get food out for me?” She muttered angrily. He felt a rush of anger, it wasn’t like he knew what time she would be home.
Dean felt Sam’s elbow whack into his eye, and he tumbled back, clutching his face a little. In a manly fashion, he rocked lightly. “Motherfucker.” He cursed, glaring at Sam.
Alistar on his left grabbed Castiel, and slammed him up against a random locker with a bang. Students scurried out of their way in the halls, and none of them stopped to help Castiel. As per usual. The moan was almost lost in the chaos of the hallway, but the look of pain on Castiel’s face spoke for itself. He definitely had some sore spots under those clothes. Satisfaction wormed it’s way through Dean, he’d done a good job on him.
The cafe he was walking to was truly terrible. He only knew it because it was also dirt cheap, and if you asked real nice the cashier/bartender would give you a shot of whiskey in your instant coffee. But the sandwiches weren't half bad, so that was also a plus. Sometimes he and the gang come here for lunch.
“You’re damn right it won’t.” His father whispered nastily, and with a great whoosh, he grabbed Castiel by a fist of hair and jerked him onto the floor. Castiel let out a grunt as he hit the cold ground his his bruised body, his scalp white hot with pain. He could tell his father had yanked out a tuft of his hair, though the calloused fingers were still holding onto him. He watched as a few black-brown strands fell to the floor in front of his eyes. He barely started to try to get up, but the hand on his head was a vice, pushing him down.
“Alright, alright, just askin’” Azazel said defensively, throwing his hands up in a gesture of peace. Dean scowled.
“Ah, Nostalgia.” Alistair sighed, his breath blowing with uncomfortable heat onto Castiel’s face. He desperately wished he were anywhere but here, underneath Alistair’s crouched legs, even if it meant he was back with his father. Castiel would be away from the horrible mad glint in Alistair’s eyes.
In the shower, he held his arm out of the water for as long as he could before the pain of holding it was too much. Then he carefully pulled it into the water, hissing when the drops hammered across his arm, making little spikes of pain burst across it. He held it across his chest, using his other hand to wash himself.
Castiel wanted to tell him that he just had to get his cast off, but he somehow doubted that would make Dean stop. And besides, Dean was being such a fucking hypocrite. He was out of school too.
When he was inside the library, he pulled out a list of books he wanted to get. When he passed the front desk, Mrs. Robbins waved at him, and he smiled back quickly. This was meant to be a short visit, he couldn’t stand around and talk.
“I’m fine.” He answered shortly. She looked at him surreptitiously.
A less-than-pleasant sensation settled low in his stomach when he thought about it, effectively dousing out any happiness when he remembered that his father was coming the following day. Sometime while he was in school, his father was going to fly here and stay for a while. Castiel wondered how long.
“You know what Sammy, I’ve been hearing alot about Jess nowadays. Is there a little somethin’ going on that I don’t know about?” He teased, waggling his eyebrows.
Why should he care so motherfucking much? So something terrible happened to Novak. BIG DEAL. Terrible things happen all the time, every day and to everyone. It just wasn’t every day that one of your closest friends was the actual inflictor of this terrible thing…. And it wasn’t even like Alistair got that far! And aside from the one bad thing, Dean felt Novak had cushy enough of a homelife to give the rest of them a break from the whining. Does he? Does he really, though? Dean’s inner Jiminy Cricket murmured, and he thought as hard as he could; Shut the fuck up motherfucker I’m going to fucking thing what I want and I’m not going to be judged and yelled at by a fucking imaginary voice in my FUCKING head!
“Lunch money? What are we, in fifth grade?” Dean snarked at his friend. Castiel remained stoically silent. Alistair chuckled.
Movie back on. They watched like zombies, with Castiel’s faint and slightly laboured breathing providing an extra background noise. In wasn’t long before this movie too was done, and it was 8 in the evening.
Cas swallowed, and felt the tight dryness in his throat left behind after thinking of those horrible times with his father. He filled a pristine glass with water and chugged it down before the dry feeling could get any worse, and refilled the glass again. Carrying it in his hand, he walked over to the calendar magnetized to the fridge, and stared at Wednesday of that week, a dark anticipation blooming in his chest. The words Zacharia home printed in his mother’s messy scrawl on the white block made him uneasy, no matter if he was getting his cast off before. Though he was very grateful he was disposing of the handicap, for he had a feeling he would feel weaker in his father’s presence with it on.
“What the hell are you doing, tracking mud all over my floor?” She accused in a steely voice. She was stone cold sober, then.
As he packed the lunches in their seldom-washed containers, Dean looked absently at the  cuts on his knuckles too. They had stung like a mother in the shower, but he was no pansy and didn’t mind them. Well, not much anyways.
Cas looked at a clock on the wall, and mentally kicked himself when he saw it was already 10:20, and he hadn’t made his mother breakfast yet. He always made her eggs and sometimes bacon, topped off with a mug of coffee. He had gotten several rebuttals before for not putting the correct amount of sugar in the coffee for her, so he usually made a point to dump two heaping spoonfuls of sugar into her mug. It had to taste like cavities in a cup, but she didn’t scold him for it.
“Fine! You have fun. Azazel, you with me? Or-” cough cough “-him?” Dean asked Azazel, and Castiel couldn’t make out the answer. Were they leaving? Were they leaving him with Alistar?
“I was not skipping school,” He deadpanned, “I was going to get my cast off. I couldn’t explain yesterday, you wouldn’t listen.” He looked straight at Dean, with just a hint of rare accusation in his eyes and voice. Dean sneered at him. The blue eyed boy looked down.
By then the coffee was done, and he could hear the movement upstairs that announced his mother’s consciousness. He hurriedly poured cream into the dark brown liquid, and turned it tan like she liked. He quickly dumped sugar into it from the black glass sugar bowl they had, and carried the mug of energy out to the table and set it beside her breakfast.
Please excuse misspellings of a certain someone's name! More about this at the end.
When he walked in, his mother pushed past him with his father’s luggage in her arms, carrying it upstairs for him. Zakaria himself was standing in the living room, looking at Castiel in the doorway, with his arms crossed and his half-bald head shining in the light.
He lay there for another minute before he finally hauled himself to his feet and walked slowly out of the alleyway. He noticed unused quarters still jingling in his pocket.
Alistar was telling them about the new computer his dad had gotten, and how he would be able to use it every once in awhile. Dean was jealous, but anger soon burned that emotion down when he thought about how Castiel must have his own laptop, and his parents could certainly afford it. He hated Castiel Novak.
When Castiel’s alarm clock rang out the next morning, he didn’t turn it off and it rang and rang until it stopped on it’s own, maybe 20 minutes later. The only thing that got Castiel to open his eyes was the sudden realization to his sleepy pained mind that he was going to be late for school, on the day that his father was coming home.
He took in a deep breath and ducked out from Dean’s rough hand, which scrabbled in mid air aimlessly for a moment, not quite as efficient as it should’ve been in keeping Castiel still.
Everything went silent and wavy as his ears cleared the liquid barrier, he struggled to break the hold and not fall in at the same time. Panic was making his lungs seize for air, he could tell he wasn’t going to last long. He wasn’t any hero from a movie, he couldn’t hold his breath longer than ten seconds, he was screwed. He swung wildly with his arms, though he could barely move them in the hunched over position he was occupying. He jerked his head fruitlessly, the water billowing around his ear as the non-existent air burned in his lungs. The hand on his neck was so tight it was incredibly painful, he screwed up his eyes in the effort not to breath in water as he finally reached his limit, his heart beating a thousand miles an hour….
He remembered times before now, when he had been having trouble at school, or was being bullied, or had a parent teacher conference, or needed help for a project. And his mother had agreed to help him. And she had let him down, every single time. Not showing up, saying she was busy, going out with friends the day of. He had learned not to trust her.
He did feel a little bad, how desperate Castiel had gotten when he saw the bridge. His bright blue eyes had widened to the size of dinner plates. It made him wonder what the rich nerd thought they were going to do. Toss him over? Leave it to the spoiled brat to think the worst of them. Dean wondered if Castiel had gone home and tattled to his perfect parents. Maybe they would march down to the school and tell the principal. Dean’s heart boiled in anger at the thought of Castiel, with his big wig rich daddy and perfect mother and wife, in their huge house. And Dean got stuck with a drunk angry dad and memories of a sweet blond dead mother. It all was just not fair, the fact he and Sammy got stuck with a drunken asshole who didn’t even buy them new clothes, and Castiel went home to a loving mother and father and got whatever he wanted. He could feel his mood dipping lower and lower, and struggled to think of other things. They couldn’t get Novak again today, because that would be too risky if he had tattled on them for yesterday. No matter how much he wanted to.
At the pace he was going he probably was going to have a long walk ahead of him. He gritted his teeth and put one foot in front of the other, making his way back.
He arrived at his house and walked inside, to his room to deposit his bag. When he got back downstairs, he found a note saying his dad had gone food shopping and would be back in a few hours. He raised his eyebrows in surprise that his dad was out and about. But their fridge had been looking empty, so he was grateful. He went upstairs.
When he next looked up, dark hard fully fallen. Judging from the gumminess of his eyes, Castiel thought he might have actually fallen asleep for an hour or two. It was a miracle no one had bothered him. Shivering in what must have been forty degree weather, Castiel rubbed his arms for a while. He should stand, look for some place to sleep that was sheltered from the harsh wind. But he didn’t want to. Couldn’t he just sleep here, on the ground, for one night? Until he gathered back strength?
Sam can’t. He doesn’t know how it feels. Terrible, painful, sad.
Other than that, the whole Harry-Potter-til-your-eyes-drop-out situation sounded pretty good to Dean. It’d been a while since he’d visited potterland, and maybe it’d do some good to mouth along to the words for a while.
Sam grunted disapprovingly at Dean from the other side of the room, where he was reading.
Out of the spring sounds wafting in through his open window, he started hearing voices. They varied in pitch, yells and and laughs that sounded male. There was also a playful shriek that was definitely made by a girl, and though the voice were laughing Cas couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy. He put his book cover up on the bed next to him, and slowly sat up, careful not to make his old bed creak. He swung his legs over and gently rested his feet on the floor, then put his weight behind them and stood slowly. He walked over to the window and peered out, but the house was facing the wrong way and he couldn't see the people making the noise. He had a strange suspicion that it was people from his school, but he couldn’t be sure. He didn’t even know why he cared, but he had to see the people to make sure they weren’t causing trouble. The yells and shouts were getting closer and louder, Cas was pretty sure someone on his block was going to call the police to complain. Something was thrown with a clang, and he jumped. It sounded metal, maybe a beer can.
_____________________
“You better watch who you tell to shut up.” He growled, and Azazel looked cowed for a moment.
Sam had stopped trying to put it out with his jacket at some point because he had spied a hose in the corner. He turned it on full blast, ignoring the fact that it squirted all over his jeans, and turned it on to Castiel. Dean had thrown his jacket away and was trying to pull Castiel down, despite the fact that the bolts screwed into the angel’s hands and feet were in the way. But the burnt and frail wood behind them gave way, and Dean pulled a now whimpering Castiel crashing into his arms, sobbing apologies into his hair as he cradled his burnt body as best he could. Sam stayed put, watching sorrowfully a few feet away.
At lunch he scanned the crowd for Castiel, even though he knew he was in the library.
He could barely feel his stomach rumbling over the pain, it was but a gentle reverberation in his empty gut. He wished he could go back to sleep, or that some kind stranger with a gun would come along and shoot him. His mouth tasted terrible. Probably from not eating for at least a day and half, Castiel couldn’t remember how long exactly.
He looked up the second book, and headed off to the young adult section, on the other side of the library. It really made no sense how the things were placed in this building, like they wanted you to exercise as much as possible. Against your will.
It was weird how angry Joe was on Castiel’s behalf. It felt strange and foreign. “Well, I think we should call an ambulance or something, make sure you’re okay?” Castiel snapped to attention, shaking his head very hard. Well, as hard as it would let him without bursting.
Castiel wasn’t listening. Pinned against the wall by his arms, Castiel’s only thoughts were those of getting away to freedom, away from this abusive psychopath. The hard wall was pressing painfully into his back, and it didn't help that the only thing he could really do was try and shove himself forward, because then Alistair would simply shove him back. He didn’t want to be this close to Alistair.
The VHS player was also a constant reminder of how little money they had.
He faded in and out of the conversation, trying to act normal. He couldn’t help but let some ice leech into his voice though whenever Novak was brought up, which was a surprising number of times. He sat there uncomfortably while Alistair pinned with with a look like an x-ray machine. The cold eyes drilled through him, making his arms prickle. But he didn’t let it show how close he was to abandoning the lunch table and going to look for Novak.
Castiel cut off suddenly as Alistair stood, still clutching his leg with both hands, pulling Castiel upwards like a sack of potatoes. His leg was painfully curled halfway over Alistar’s shoulder, the rest of him hanging until his shoulders, which touched the ground. His chin scrunched awkwardly into his chest, but he was more concerned about his leg which felt like it was going to snap over Alistar’s back like a twig. “Help! Please stop him! In the pool! Help HELP Please!” He sobbed as he scrabbled at the ground. Alistair stopped at the pools edge and dropped Castiel’s legs, and when he tried to crawl away Castiel’s hand was stomped on so hard he screamed. Alistair grabbed his head with both hands, framing his face with his fingers, and shoved it under water.
Maybe Winchester would be more inclined to be disapproving than joyful. He had a brother after all, maybe that instilled some sort of moral sense in his heart, however shaky and off course it may be. Winchester was the one who walked out on Alistair originally, so he must have some misgivings about what was basically water torture. Though Castiel didn’t fool himself into thinking that Winchester had walked out because of him. It had nothing to do with the person being dunked. But Castiel did have the feeling that if it was anyone other than him, Dean probably would’ve ended the little session right there. He just wasn’t worth the strain it would put on Dean’s friendship with Alistair. This last thought was accompanied by a bitter aftertaste in Castiel’s mouth. Anger bubbled in his stomach.
When Castiel got inside the small brick church, he grabbed a hymnal and sat down in his usual seat at the very back. The place was already half full.
“But he’s probably fine!” Dean tried, rubbing his cheek. “His parents are rich! He’s probably having a fucking sponge bath in a jacuzzi right now-” He wasn’t just trying to convince Jo.
“I can’t drive.” Novak whispered (His voice was very very quiet. Dean was annoyed by it.) “I don’t know if they would take me. I need their number.”
He was relieved when he heard her sit down on the couch. It could’ve been worse than just a telling off and an order to clean up after himself.
Castiel turned and walked as fast as he could, thoughts of being cold partially discarded while he thought of all the ways he could defend himself while his whole body ached and he had no weapons. The car behind him sped up, and for a heartstopping moment Castiel thought they were going to run him over. But instead, as they passed, out of the window came about a dozen hard objects, along with some litter, pelting Castiel. Rocks, Mcdonald’s wrappers, Half empty Mcdonald’s drinks. Among those was a baseball bat, which clattered to the curb after hitting it’s target.
With nothing better to do, Castiel watched the dated trailers on the tape for The Fox and The Hound (the remastered version), Scooby Doo the movie, and Spider Man. And then it began, and he struggled to stay awake as a cat appeared onscreen, followed by an old man carrying a swaddled bundle.
Every breath Cas took hurt his lungs, but it wasn’t the worst beating he had gotten from any of the Knights Of Hell. It wasn’t the worst beating he had gotten ever. That one had been from his father.
“Yeah, it’s me.” She sounded relieved. “Thank god you’re alive, I thought I was too late. I thought you were dying. I was about to call nine-one-one.”
Zacharia smirked, sensing Castiel’s prominent discomfort. “Just good?” He asked.
Sliding his hands off the metal again he walked back to the house, which smelled pleasantly of dinner.
“Oh, we’ll let you go. Gotta get to class ourselves but first-” He pulled a marker out of his backpack next to his legs, “Can we sign your cast?” He sounded so innocent, Dean applauded his acting.
After dinner, Dean did the dishes while listening to Metallica. Then he went up to his room and read his Deadpool until he was drowsy. He brushed his teeth and went to bed, laying in the dark for a while before he got sleepy again.
_______________
There were students already there when he got inside. He hurried to his locker and then to his first class.
He punched the buttons on a ‘Rocky’ themed pinball machine, listening to the pings the little ball made inside as it bounced against all the points hot-spots. Since he went here often, he had grown to be quite good at pinball. He was top of the the leaderboard on some of the machines, and a close second on all of the rest.
Don’t let his head roll off and through the door. Thudding, splatting.
They got him over the edge, and he dangled a moment, yelling at the top of his voice. “Stop! Stop! Please, please please stop!” He was almost sobbing, but it was hard because Alistair had his hand wrapped around his throat, and it was compressing slowly, cutting off his air supply. He made choking sounds involuntarily, mostly in fear and anger but partly in relief because his feet had balanced on the narrow ledge of the bridge. “Hey All, let him breathe will you?” Said Dean.
“Really.” The scepticism nearly peeled the paint off the walls.
“And I got you out of the pool, and got you to start breathing again. And here we are.” She finished, touching Castiel’s throat lightly, tracing it as if checking for broken things or lumps. He flinched back.
He walked on for sometime, reaching the downtown area with more people to stare at him as he walked past. He was rapidly regretting his decision to come here by the time he had walked half a block into the patchy crowds of people. Eyes, followed him, a few people even gasped loudly when he walked into their line of sight, many of them were older women. He gasped a little himself when he caught sight of his reflection in a reflection store front. Bloody clothes, bloody face, old bruises and forming bruises and bandaids on his arms. He didn’t look like the son of a rich businessman, he looked like a poor boy who’d just been in a gang fight.
His heart was thumping, though not out of fear. He could not believe he let Jo get so close to him. Grateful though he was that Jo found him yesterday, it hurt him to hear that she was getting the repercussions. If she got even a fraction of the misery Castiel had to suffer through here, it would ruin her high school experience. Though she was tougher than he, and had connections within the Knights Of Hell, Jo was not going to be all sunshines and rainbows if Alistair was harassing her every time he could. Guilt settled itself into a comfortable crevice of Castiel’s stomach. He had to talk to her (no matter how much he didn’t want to) in the library. Even though he had packed no lunch, The Knights rarely ever went in there. He had to tell Jo that for her own sake, she should stay away. Though really, did she expect that being around him wouldn’t bring repercussions? Castiel also didn’t find it very likely that she would leave him alone without a fight, stubborn as she had proven herself to be.
Finally, it stopped. Or rather, his father grew tired enough to let Castiel go. “Get out of my sight you little fucker.” He said lightheartedly. “You’ve plagued this house for too long. Get up no or I’ll rip your tits off.” He leaned closer. “You could stay, but I think I’m right in assuming the basement isn’t the most comfortable place to be.”
______________
“You took too long to answer.” Alistair said, as if answering a question. “Next time you’re gonna be less happy.”
The angel lays on his bed of white and red. Dean stitches his throat.
Castiel was staring at Dean’s green  eyes with his own unfocused blue ones, but he didn’t move. He didn’t try, like he knew it was pointless. He was dying, the cut in his stomach must have been made with an angel blade, and even he could never survive what had just happened. Dean flicked his eyes in horror as he watched a burnt piece of Castiel's leg skin slide off, like the back off of a sticker.
There had been days when Castiel’s father was home, where he hadn’t eaten a crumb, or was locked in his room for hours because he was being too loud, or he wasn’t aloud to go outside on the weekend because he hadn’t gotten a perfect score on a test. His father didn't care about Castiel beyond his wrongdoings, or how much money it took to maintain him (an interest both his father and his mother shared) And even then he didn’t get the stuff he needed. Once he had been sick with the flu, in bed all day with a fever and they hadn’t done anything besides yell at him to clean up when he accidentally vomited in the living room. He had been so ill that time, he thought he was going to die and his father would cover it up like he was a pesky family pet he had been waiting to be rid of.
He walked to the library for lunch, like he normally did every day for obvious reasons. The lunch room was a battle ground, and while a lot of the school didn’t care whether he lived or died, the ones who did made it impossible for him to eat his lunch amid all the yelled insults and thrown food. He had learned not to sit there the first week of highschool. But it was nice being surrounded by nothing but books who won't judge you.
When he was all ready for mass, with nice clothes on and combed hair, he headed out.
“Yeah, well….” He had never been good at cover stories.
“You fell….into a swimming pool?” She asked, sarcasm lining every syllable. He shrugged, and winced when it irritated his arm.
Dean, Azazel, Alistar and Uriel were standing in the young adults section, laughing their asses off at Castiel. He must have made a psychotic face when he saw that book, because they were making wild reenactments, holding an imaginary book out and pulling strange twisted faces of surprise at it. Winchester was the only one there actually holding a book, so he used that as a prop.
“Dean, if you’re just going to be an asshole about this, should I just let dad handle this instead?” Sam threatened, and Dean sent him a dark look, “I’m sure he’d love to know what his oldest son is doing in his free time. He’d be so proud.” Sam spat the last word savagely, like it was a bomb.
“No one can look at your face for this long without there being side effects.” He grumbled, giving up on the mac and cheese and putting the lid on the container. He shoved it into his backpack by his feet, hearing Azazel scoff and Alistair snort. Uriel let out a braying laugh that grated worse against Dean’s nerves.
Castiel just looked at Sam and shrugged again. He really didn’t have much of a preference. Put on a movie, he would be sick. Leave him to eat his food in peace, he would still be sick.
“Oh he’s gonna be out by Monday Sam, that’s for damn sure.” Dean cut him off. “And if he’s not good enough, I’m pretty sure his dad would take him, I mean he’s so pitiful who could say no to that?” Dean answered snappily, talking fast.
Sorry these chapters are so crappy guys! I'm trying to make things happen but it's slow hard work trying to write a fanfic. Thanks for all your comments!
Castiel was exhausted. He could feel his eyes drooping, and his head and neck throbbing and his nostrils burning (though fainter than before), and he wanted nothing more than to get out of this building and collapse somewhere and just sleep forever. His hands were shaking so hard he doubted he could have held anything, and his coughing was making everything else shudder too. He kind of wished he hadn’t regained consciousness.
Castiel’s face burned as he tucked the book into the crook of his usable arm. He was half tempted to put it back on the shelve, but knowing those idiots they would probably check it out themselves and burn it in their backyards.
After a car ride that stretched on and on with only himself and the sound of some spare change jingling to fill the dusty leather interior, Dean arrived at the desired store. He got out, counted his cash, stowed it securely in his back pocket to discourage pickpockets (was it the back or the front that was easier to get to? Whatever) and stepped inside the rundown shop.
Castiel was still half crouched at one of the counters in the kitchen, his knees halfway buckled and wobbling. He slowly started to rise, and then went rigid as he heard a voice speak behind him. “Out for a walk?” Fuck.
When they pulled up to the hospital, Castiel waited an uncertain amount of time for his mother to start getting out of the car. She sat there staring out of the window for what seemed like ages, before she finally unbuckled her seatbelt and slung her legs out of her door. They walked inside and checked in at the desk, and Castiel could feel a nervous excitement brewing in his chest. He couldn’t wait to get the damn cast off.
“Fucking call me a coward one more time, I dare you.” Dean growled, and Sam looked steadily into his eyes.
“I can take you somewhere if you’d like. The emergency room? Sweetie, your shirt is soaked in blood. I can call someone for you, to come and get you.” Castiel looked down at his shirt and thought that she was making a vast overstatement. It wasn’t soaked-just kind of splotched.
“All bark and no bite.” Alistair said, and Castiel shifted uneasily. It sounded like the conversation was drawing to a close, and while he should be getting out of there he couldn’t help but stay and hear what would happen next. “I’d say you’re like Dean in that way, but, well, after seeing his magnificent job on RichDick the other day, I’d say he’s got a fair amount of bite in him after all.” Castiel twitched at the mention of him.
“I didn’t know you would be home so soon.” Castiel said quietly.
Sam laboriously got up and pressed a button on the VHS, and the background score blared from the old speakers. It was very different from the sleek television set Castiel had had access to in his previous house, but better than the tinny sounds emitted from his dying laptop when he neglected to put earbuds in.
He looked both ways before making every turn, almost running through the hallways. He walked outside without being attacked, but still held his breath. He had yet to clear the parking lot. He had just taken a few steps outside when he was grabbed roughly by the arms and shoved to the side. He hadn't seen them coming!
He stood there a moment, feeling his heart rate slow down, and thinking over what just happened. It wasn’t so bad, just words. She wasn’t drunk, she would remember this in the morning. But right now he was too tired to think about that, and he had to get to bed before 2 AM. Couldn’t be late for school in the morning.
Castiel rubbed at his arm all throughout the rest of the day, and whenever he saw a flash of sandy blond hair or Alistar’s trademark Nightmare on Elm Street backpack he would turn the other direction. Even though it made him late for Algebra. His legs burned and felt like sandbags, his arms ached, his chest ached and his back ached worst of all. His butt was bruised to from being slammed to the floor, and he could feel every cut and bruise on his face as well. You would think he wouldn’t be very fazed by these things, being beaten up all the time as he was, but swollen bruises on his face felt like a very thick layer of face paint, and he could always sense it under his eyes and nose, making him want to rub his face. And the initials scrawled on his arm didn’t help, they hurt because the two boys had pressed down viciously with the pen. It didn’t matter that it was only ink, it made him angry to look at the marks, angry at Alistar and furious at Dean Winchester.
“What? What did you say?” Zacharia turned back to him, disbelief etched on his face. Castiel mentally kicked himself, mentally rolled himself over with a tractor.
“We taking him homework after school?” Dean asked.
“Yes, Dean, I have a lot of homework, so I’m going to make this pretty damn quick.” Jo spat, and Dean’s fragile pretense of ‘nothing is wrong and she’s just here for a social call’ disappeared as he watched the fire lick at Jo’s eyes.
Castiel walked in and told someone at the desk what was wrong, that he thought his arm was broken. A nurse came and took him to a room, looked at his arm and grimaced. She said that it was definitely broken, but they were going to have to take an x-ray to see in what way it was broken before they put a cast on it. She then left to get a doctor.
Heyyyy so I'm so sorry it's been a little over a month, right? Life's been super busy, I can't really find time to write unless it's three in the morning and I make so many spelling mistakes that spell check can't keep up. Thank you for reading! It'll get more interesting soon, I promise. Just filler chapters are mainly what you're getting until Chapter 11. -J
Down the stairs, into the living room he walked grabbed his mother’s dishes absent mindedly as he went to the kitchen, and placed them carefully into the sink so that they wouldn’t break, as they had done before when he hadn’t been careful enough. That accident took place when his father was in kitchen, and he made sure Castiel never forgot to be careful. His father was on a whole nother level than his mother when it came to punishments, and Castiel lived in fear of screwing up in front of him.
Feeling: Peaceful
He didn’t know that Sam watched him carefully while he did.
He didn’t say anything. Just averted his gaze and looked at the wall like it was his way into heaven. Dean didn’t give a shit if their little brawl had offended Novak’s sensibilities.
Castiel continued throwing himself back and forth, trying desperately to shake Dean’s strong body off him. He didn’t speak, but grunted once in awhile from the effort of trying to throw his weak frame out of their arms. Alistair walked in front of him and whacked him in the nose with his fist, stunning Castiel for just enough time for them to get moving again.
“Shut up.”
Hours later, he was out of the church. The kindly priest had told him that they didn’t have a place to keep him for the night, and asked him to return tomorrow to receive further assistance. Castiel thanked him and left, knowing that they just didn’t want a filthy beaten up homeless teenager camping out in the building, but the priest was too nice to say so. Either way, he had to figure out what he was going to do.
“I’m not blind, Castiel. You’re not ‘fine’. I know what happens every day. I know where you get those bruises from.”
“So dad, Gordon was wondering if I could go over to his house on thursday for the night. It’s his birthday and Garth and Peter’ll be there too.” His dad turned to Sam after another look at Dean.
At that, they started to move in on Castiel. After ducking a blow from Azazel, Castiel kicked Dean in the shin as the other two closed in on him fast. He moved out of the way of another hit, but soon one, and then two and three punches slipped past his defences and he was restrained back in his old buddy Winchester’s arms before long. But just as he was getting ‘comfortable’, Dean threw him down onto the concrete in front of the pool and then Alistar pushed him out of the way and crouched next to Castiel. “Enjoy your swim.” He crooned with a sickening smile, and Castiel barely had time to draw in a breath before Alistar’s hand clamped on his neck and forced his head underwater.
Rule number one, don’t contradict.
____________________________
He walked outside, got into the car and slammed the door shut behind him. He started her up and drove down town almost above the speed limit, but not quite. He didn’t want a ticket, and the cops in this town were out to get him. Seriously. He sighed loudly as he skipped around on the radio while he drove, catching flickers of the soul-crunching ear shrapnel people called music these days. He was on his second round of the different stations when he gave up all hope of finding a decent song, and completed a dangerous feat that could’ve ended up with his crashing headlong into an approaching semi. He leaned far, far over to the passenger side and popped open the glove compartment, rooting around inside for a cassette, any cassette. His head was level with the dashboard, so he couldn’t see jack, but he firgured it was worth it. Good music equaled a good mood, and he could use a good mood right now, Anything would be better than catching Ariana Grande’s dulcet tones one more time. When he had located a cassette and popped it in, he settled back and let the drums take over, tapping his thumbs on the steering wheel in time, thinking randomly.
When he finished doing that, he walked back into the living room and turned on the vacuum from where it was sitting on the hardwood floor, and vacuumed the rug. He did all this with a blank look on his face, not really watching as he dragged the vacuum back and forth and back and forth. He wasn’t mad about being made to clean, because if he wasn’t going to do it, who was? He didn’t want his father to come home to a dirty house, because that could end terribly for everyone. It had been a while since the last big punishment, but it had stuck in Castiel’s mind well enough. He shuddered a little as he remembered the hunger, gnawing and clawing at his stomach and torso. It wasn’t an experience he wanted to repeat.
Needless to say, he didn’t believe in that monster now. But the habit stuck.
Anyways, I have some news. I am going to stop writing in this journal. I feel that my updates are getting sluggish. I am skipping nights, sometimes twice in a row. I haven’t really acknowledged it until now, but life is just getting too tiring to write about. So this is my goodbye, though no one will ever read it, as I am going to rid myself of this journal tomorrow. If my father got his hands on it, it would be like a nightmare come to life. Maybe I’ll throw this in the creek the Knights of Hell introduced me to. But first I’ll have to erase my name from it.
“Castiel. What were you and your...friends laughing at him for? It seemed quite funny, but he didn’t seem to think of it that way.” She continued in what seemed to be a neutral tone, but was slipping down a few notches to accusing.
“Must’ve been a big-ass hill, to break your arm falling down it.”
Castiel’s eyes were not fixed on anything in the room, staring at Dean’s shoulder with a greyer blue than he used to have. With each limb pinned to the ceiling with metal bolts, there were drops of blood steadily dripping into large puddles the Winchester’s had not noticed when they came in. more blood was being drained from Castiel's body by way of a slash on his stomach, exposed because his button up shirt had been cut in half to parade his injuries. Like some sort of bizarre Jesus, Castiel was strung up on the ceiling, and that was when Dean noticed a flame at the heel of Castiel’s foot. He barely had time to shout a warning at Sam and whimper out Cas’ name before it caught onto the angel’s skin and traveled up his body like he had been soaked in lighting fluid. Dean and Sam fell to the floor as there was a woosh and flame engulfed Castiel’s body. Dean screamed, staring at the fire even though it hurt his eyes in the absence of the previous darkness.

Dean opened his mouth, thinking hard. “Of course I have a damn reason. He’s just- he thinks he’s better than everyone else.” Man, this was harder to justify out loud. “Just ‘cuz he’s got a better house and rich parents, and he can afford to be picky or not like something.” Sam’s eyebrow raised skeptically, and Dean bristled.
His face only had a few precious places that weren't bruised. Last night Zacharia seemed more determined to hit the same place over and over again, so it was mainly one enormous bruise on his right cheek, and a slightly less pronounced one on his left jaw line. There were other more faded bruises on his face of course, but they were a lot less noticeable that the newer black-bruises on him. And no one would think anything of it. It was perfect, the way his father operated. The children and teachers at school wouldn’t give a shit, thinking the Knights had simply gotten hold of him again. Well, they were right. The Knights had gotten hold of him, but they were only part of the reason he looked like a house had been dropped on him.
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Dean said conversationally, “Didn’t think rich kids like you hung out at the shabby old arcade. Or skipped school, for that matter. What happened, you just decide you want a day off and get daddy to let you ditch and hang around all day?”
He Picked up the watchers with his good hand and braced it on his cast as he tried to resume his reading. He found it increasingly difficult, as his eyes were foggy and unfocused at random intervals. He hated feeling drowsy, the only remedy was sleep, and succumbing to it felt like a weakness.
Castiel heard them before he saw them. Creeping toward a the kitchen, the voices were faintly there, hushed. His mother sounded worried, his father was louder and it sounded like he was threatening her. Taking a deep breath, Castiel shoved rising concern away. Normal. This was normal. He knocked semi-loudly on the doorframe to the kitchen before entering.
That night Castiel curled up in bed over his books, eyes faintly scratchy from reading for hours. It was around 12:30, and he had gotten into bed and started reading at 10.
“He obviously didn’t find it very fun.”
The dust was thick around the door when he crept inside, suddenly cautious now that he was closer. It was dark, and the air smelled like dirt, blood and rotting meat, mixed with the forest and rust. Through the dark was glints of metal cast from various hooks and saws and horrible looking torture devices placed carefully around the room. There was a dripping steadily echoing around the small room. Sam slapped a flashlight into Dean’s hand, and they had only needed to shine them up to find Castiel.
He looked at her dully, wishing very much she would go away.
He threw the covers off himself and tried to stand up in one go, like some superhero in a comic book that could bounce back the day after a dramatic rooftop-jumping fight. Buffy got stabbed in the sixth season and Castiel was pretty sure that if she could run around and kill monsters after that, he could make his way downstairs and eat a banana before school.
“I can’t. Ask him.”
“Castiel. You’ve grown since I last saw you.” He said pleasantly, with just a little hint of distaste in his voice.
In the car, Castiel sat with his hands in his lap, staring out at the rapidly passing scenery as his mother drove too far past the speed limit. His father didn't like it when she got tickets, (Scratch that, he hated it. The last time she got a ticket Castiel had to cover his ears to dull the sound of his father’s yelling blasting through the house) but she still sped across roads like she owned them. Castiel had warned her to slow down a few times, but he decided not to risk dying in a fiery crash because she had to turn so far to slap him to tell her off for going a few miles over the limit.
Dean wants to burn Sam. Maybe he will.
Castiel’s eyes had picked up a spark of awareness as the flame rushed up his body, and his mouth stretched open and screamed, a wail of agony as his skin blistered and burnt like marshmallows. Dean stripped of his jacket and started desperately trying to snuff out the fire on the low ceiling, yelling at Sam to help him. Sam was doing the same thing in the blink of an eye, though he knew it was too late for Castiel.
“Castiel.” He answered quietly, and she smiled at him. He felt annoyed at himself for telling her, but then again if she was with the Knights it wasn’t new information. He wolfed down his sandwich as fast as he could.
Castiel got out of his pajama pants, and after a few minutes of taming his hair walked down stairs.
“T-that she-Mrs. Novak- is dead?” He asked, though he really called out to find out if Novak sr. actually didn’t want his son back. But somehow Dean’s bravery seemed to evaporate when Zacharaia’s attention turned on him.
He struggled to his knees in the water, sputtering at the cold. His hands were still behind his arms, but he felt that the tie was looser. Maybe that was what had broken his arm, pulling it so hard against the tie. In any case, it felt like he could pull free now. He tried to get loose and cried out as he made the mistake of trying to use his broken appendage. He pulled the good one out, and the bad one swung to his chest to be cradled by the other one. He grunted in pain, having it lance up his arm like a swarm of bees. Tears were springing to his eyes, and he couldn’t help it when they leaked down his cheeks. His whole body ached from the fall for a minute as he stumbled out of the creeke.
