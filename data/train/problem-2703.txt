Dean sighed when he struck out, but then thought maybe he should try asking someone else. So he tried Tony, but the doctor only said he hasn't seen him all week, too busy at the hospital with some new department opening up. Dean next texted Benny and without waiting for a reply, he texted Balthazar too, knowing how the man had the scoop on anyone and loved to gossip.
"Where. is. HE?!" Castiel's deep voice echoed thought the streets and the man before him started to tremble, scared out of his mind.
Azazel thought he was so smart, making this perfect pitch and selling it to Dean. But he didn't know what exactly went on between him and Castiel, and he didn't know why Castiel was paying, and he didn't know that this was the kind of a thing he would do just to make sure Azazel was all settled with his money while Castiel got to just spend time with Dean. He was too happy, if the grin on his face wasn't indication enough, the guilt drowned and washed up dead on the shore and Dean nodded vigorously.
And as the song played Dean slowly moved to the center of the room, swaying his hips just a bit. He came to a stop by the bed, lifting his arms and crossing them over his abdomen, his hands slowly reaching under his shirt. His hips started swaying a bit more as his hands slowly moved around his waist, his fingers tracing on his skin.
He took his plate and went back to his seat, a thought nagging at him from the back of his mind. He really should try and talk to Dean, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it, not just because he felt it might ruin the moment, but also because he feared Dean's reaction.
He followed his own breath leaning in and pressing his lips against the part of Cas’ neck he could get to, considering the angel had his arms lifted up, making it somewhat hard to reach. Cas gasped, and shivered again, his cock giving an interested twitch where it was still pressed against Dean’s thigh, coated with his previous release. Dean felt his cheeks flush, but he couldn’t stop and a part of him didn’t even want to. His heart wanted nothing more than to comfort Cas, to show him it’s alright, and to… To… To feel. To let himself feel. Let himself taste. Dean dragged his lips over Cas’ skin, darting his tongue out, licking, sucking, lightly biting. Fuck, he tasted good.
Tommorow came around too quickly, but at least Castiel had an idea about what he was going to do, having spent the entire night thinking it through between the nightmares. First, he would go down to Crossroads Publication Inc. and ask Mr. Crowley for his manuscript or at least the digital copy. The man was a sleazeball, but he wasn't a thief. Then he would go to see Balthazar.
Things have changed. Times have changed. The ladies don't frequent these clubs anymore, especially one so run down like ZaZ. But the men do. And they like to pay extra for a lap dance or more.
He did manage to balance on that ledge when the alpha swallowed him to the base, he lasted when the alpha bobbed his head, gliding his tongue on his way down to add friction, and licked and teased the head on his way up. But he completely lost it, when, unnoticed, Castiel's hand sneaked its way to Dean's ass, to his little pucker and his finger breached it, immediately curling to reach that sweet spot. Dean writhed and shook as his orgasm tore out of him and wailed as Castiel kept stimulating his prostate, two, then three fingers deep.
Just as he finished putting the last plate down, this time not aiming for perfection so much as the night before, Dean walked into the dining room. Since he was a bit skinnier then Castiel, the clothes hung loosely on him, but to Castiel, he still looked amazing, so much so that he couldn't hold back his smile.
"They are letting Kincaid Foster out? How?" Dean asked frowning. Castiel knew Meg had been with a criminal and was working at the shelter as part of her punishment for helping him, but that was where his knowledge of the matter ended. Obviously Dean knew more.
“Nonsense. I am always delighted to see a new face. I do hope Your father is in good health, last I heard he was having some heartburn issues.” Castiel said with a straight expression. He was taught about all of the estates and the small communities their country of Franks* overtook over the years, expanding almost as fast as the Roman Empire once did. He knew about lord Samuel Campbell, senior, about his runaway daughter and his stoic wife, but he did not know they had a son, and such a young one too.
Dean's breath caught when his fingers neared Castiel's mouth and when he felt he man's warm breath. He dropped the gummy bear on Castiel's tongue and retracted his hand without Castiel realizing what effect that little simple act had on Dean. He shoved his hand back in the bag and fished out another gummy bear, bowed his head and stared at it for a moment. When he first started seeing Castiel, he thought the man had some sort of a food kink, wanting to have dinner with him and make it all feel like a date.
The alpha growled, and he must have misinterpreted Dean’s sounds as whining, as the omega wishing for more; and he started moving more, rolling his hips into Dean, slightly pulling back and pushing back inside. Dean’s lips parted open as he brought his head back down to look at his alpha and found that Cas was just staring at him, his gaze unwavering, firm and soulseeing. His hands were still roaming all over Dean’s body, caressing each patch of skin, but then the alpha’s right hand came to his knee and pushed lightly, making Dean bend it to his chest. The motion opened his body even more to his alpha who started thrusting at a more rapid pace, his hips giving a little roll each time he would bottom out.
His curvy pink lips that always seemed to want to stretch into a smile and reveal those pearly whites, but were holding back for some reason.
Dean lifted his grateful eyes and looked at Castiel with a smile, his expression morphing from thankful to surprised and embarrassed as Castiel removed his drenched dress shirt. “Alright, perhaps you can avert your eyes on occasion.” Castiel said with a slight chuckle as he picked up a fresh one and put it on. Turning towards Dean again, he found the omega with the most adorable pink color to his high cheeks.
Ok, maybe this was too much? The plates, the candles, the swans? Maybe he was trying to hard, maybe it would make Dean feel uncomfortable? He didn't want to make him feel like that ever again, not after what... God, he was such a mess. He felt so ashamed and still does, but he doesn't know how else to do this. If he asked Dean out on a date, there was a chance he would say no, maybe not because he doesn't want to, but because he can't, because if he isn't buying his time, someone else is. And Castiel could not handle that. He will not allow that. And it still shamed him that he paid for Dean's company once more, and will continue to do that, but it is better then any alternative.
"I...I' m sorry, I..." Castiel tried, but his inner alpha only roared at him, the internal debate making him sweat. He was aroused, and the more seconds went by, the more his breathing picked up, waves if heat crashing over him.
"No, no..." He uttered and stumbled again when Dean reached out to touch him, then turned around a fled. He could hear Dean calling out to him and he could hear his footsteps as the man chased after him, but he couldn't stop, he couldn't face it, he couldn't admit it was real. That the man he met four days ago was a lie and that this is Dean, the real Dean, the Dean in brand new designer jeans and a button up shirt and shaved and with a new haircut and his damn green eyes.
A hand on his shoulder startled Dean so much, he yelped, and Uncle Bobby’s brows rose up in surprise at his reaction. “What’s gotten into you, boy?”
Speaking of the offer, why was Cas so reluctant to take it? He might be a bit shy when it came to meeting new people, but he jumped at the opportunity when Charlie needed help, and not only did he do an amazing work, he also enjoyed doing it, it was so obviously in his element as his fingers kept hitting the keyboard. Did it have something to do with Crowley? Dean decided he really should find out, but he didn't want to push Cas into it, it was easier and better to let the man open up on his own. Sometimes, it even seemed like, Cas expected him to push, and when he didn't, Cas was pleasantly surprised and eager to talk and act, instead of closing off.
"Why the fuck not?! You are already paying for this body, paying for this ass, why not own it? Why not take what is yours? That's what you're supposed to do! You pay for it, you own it! SO FUCKING OWN IT!"
Almost six months later, it was all set. They arranged for a few thugs to attack Prince James in the royal garden and in all that comotion they would replace him with Castiel, then make it seem as if the musketeers saved him, and in return prince ‘James’ would honor them with a chance to serve him and be his personal guards. And aside from being accidentally hit in the face by  Balthazar, Castiel thought it all went smoothly. He was brought before his father, in his room and knelt by his bed and his father did not recognize him. Castiel played his part all too well, pouting and seemed annoyed by King Charles’ proclamation that the musketeers would guard him now, as if it was his idea in the first place.
A rush of adrenaline overwhelmed him as his panic spiked, because not only was he an idiot who misplaced the information that he had a very attractive, blueyed house guest, but also ‘cause said houseguest was missing. “Cas?” He asked the empty room. Yeah, he obviously wasn’t there, Dean would have noticed him by now. Slowly, as if he wanted to delay finding out, Dean rose to his feet and patted to Cas’ room. Gently rapping on the door, he called out the man’s name, and listened to the silence on the other end. The panic that he tried to contain blasted through when Dean glanced inside and found an empty room, making his breathing pick up along with the multitude of alaming thoughts. Where could he have wandered off to? Did he just go out, will he be back? Or would he stay away? Did he run off? Immediately, Dean felt guilty and started picking apart his actions from the day before, considering all the things he did wrong, things he could have done differently.
"If you would excuse us now, gentleman, me and my friend have to go powered our noses." Nick announced and Dean watched him with a shocked expression, blushing like crazy. Castiel and Anthony laughed, but nodded and Nick pulled Dean by the arm and lead him to the bar.
And then a week past without a single woman and Azazel told him if he wants the money for Sammy, he will have to bend over and take it like a man. Dean knew it was coming. And he knew he would end up swallowing his pride, for Sammy's sake.
"I don't know what you possibly see in me, but I can tell you care about me, sincerely. I have been fooled before, but I do think you are honest with your intentions." Cas said, and it struck a cord with Dean. He had been fooled before? What did that mean? Had someone hurt him? That would explain his trust issues, but as much as Dean wanted to know, he couldn't ask. He had to wait until Cas wanted to tell him.
"Not important?! He's not important?!" Dean yelled, because that wasn't right, that couldn't be right. Not because he might have eventually end up maybe important to Dean, no. It was because these weren't the kind of papers that stomped all over the little guy to get to the big picture, no. That wasn't what any of this was all about and if Naomi's predecessor, Robert Singer still sat in that chair, he would not have said that. He wouldn't have even rewritten Dean's article, he would have called him in, smacked him on the head and sent him back to redo it himself.
The only thing that seemed to calm him down was chocolate, for whatever reason, Gabriel couldn't fathom, but if it kept his brother pleased and calm, then he could have all the chocolate he wanted. Still, Gabriel knew he would have to talk to him eventually, and he really dreaded it, because he didn't know what to say. Or better yet, how to say it.
Dean skipped the next two days of work, excusing himself with research for a new project and just spent these days wallowing in misery and sorrow, as his mind kept wandering back to that damn look on Castiel's face. A few times, his mind let him to remember a funny detail and he would smile, and then instantly felt guilty over allowing himself a nice emotion. He would order food, too depressed to cook for himself and then leave it to turn into icicles before finally cracking and eating it cold when his stomach started hurting. He hadn't showered in three, or was it four days now? Who cared? He hadn't showered properly in months while he was out there, what was four days? Not like he had a reason to freshen up and smell nice. He slept on that damn couch because, why not? The TV was there, sometimes loud enough to chase his sad thoughts away.
He allowed Dean to pull away and remove his shirt, looking back at him with some strange adoration, and after the shirt hit the floor with a quiet scuffle, the only sound remaining was the sound of their breaths. In fact, Dean was breathing just like him, just on the border of panting and it was probably from the long kissing. As Casteil's eyes started to drift, to take in the site of Dean and not just focusing on his eyes and lips, Dean suddenly quickly moved towards him and pecked his lips once more, pulling away immediately to look in his eyes and await for any reaction as his fingers caught on the band of Castiel's sweats.
He couldn't stand for it, he couldn't let them take the alpha when he had done nothing wrong, when he was the most kind and gentle and shy as they got. He didn't deserve to be cornered and threatened. He didn't deserve to be treated like this just because he presented as an alpha in this upside-down world.
“I don’t want to hurt you…” The alpha let it slip, and Dean finally paused just as he was about to take off his undergarments. He locked his eyes with his alpha and smiled, cupping his cheek.
noticed, and the most mortifying one at that, was his raging erection that was pressing against Dean's thigh. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit! What was he going to do?
"Well, since it's this late, there will probably be only Charlie and a few other night owls, but that's it. Everyone else probably went home already." Dean said it, and could see some of the weight lifted off Cas' chest as he took a deep breath and smiled more sincerely.
Well, not naked, naked, but his pants and socks were gone, he was in a T-shirt he had never seen before and - thankGod!- he still had his own underwear. What the hell happened? Where was he? Whose bed was this, whose clothes was he wearing? Where was his stuff, his bag, his clothes? His cash? Shit, shit, shit! Someone was at the door, someone was there, turning the knob silently and opening the door, and Castiel - no, he was about to be attacked and have his brain eaten by a mindless zombie, or some other creature from another horror movie and fuck, fuck, fuck!
"Hey, you okay... Buddy?" Dean tripped over his own words, cringing how he sounded, but he almost called him sweetheart, and he didn't know how Cas might react to it. Why the fuck didn't he just use his name? It was obvious, Cas' reaction to the whole 'buddy' thing, and Dean felt like an idiot. He came back and crouched next to the bed, and hoped Cas would answer his question. "Cas? What's wrong?" He prayed the man wasn't regretting what happened last night. But he was so sad and Dean just couldn't help but reach out to touch him, needing to show Cas he was there, for whatever he might need, needing to comfort him in any way possible.
"I really enjoyed the gummy bears." He commented, still smiling and Dean thought this was the perfect moment for a perfect comeback. But he couldn't think of one, not of the top of his head, so he just ended up staring for a moment, one moment too long, but fortunately, before Castiel could begin to worry, a lightbulb switched on.
"Explain what? That you used me for your story? That you advertised to the whole world what I did? They... Meg, she... Why did you lie to me, Dean? Why didn't you tell me who you were?!" Castiel demanded, yelling, but feeling his voice crack after every spoken word. He could feel the tears bubbling up, and he could only hope Dean wouldn't see it and that he would be strong enough not to let them spill.
"Good. Very good, Sam. Now, I feel another wave coming, and I need you to get hard for me. Can you do that, or do I need to spank your monkey to get him stiff?" That was hardly necessary, considering Sam's cock already started filling out as soon as he saw the omega in this position, and only gotten harder as he came close, scenting that sweet cinnamon apple candy mix. "Are you hard, Sam?"
"But, I... I did this to you, I... Oh, God..." Castiel choked trying to get the words out. "... I forced myself on you..." He managed, barely above a whisper. Dean immediately shook his head.
Their current predicament prevented Sam from making a nutritious meal for Gabriel, but the omega still needed his energy, so until the knot swelled down, Gabriel just had to replenish his energy with some fruit. And of course, he would choose a banana. Sam watched his lips with his eyes wide and his mouth gaping open as Gabriel took the banana in his mouth and slid down it, humming in delight. The alpha's cock flinched with interest inside Gabriel and the omega laughed at the tickling sensation.
Balthazar, the head of the national kitchen, was walking by, eye rolling Meg, then throwing Castiel a concerned look before he saw Dean, then shook his head with a deep sigh. Meg... She was showing Castiel something, the newspapers? That bitch must have said something, Dean knew her well by now.
"Oh... Well, that's not you, so... You met someone. Tell me, tell me..." Charlie spoke with a giddy expression and no, that's not what... Well yeah, he met someone, but not...
It was okay for a while, and then Gabriel got sick. After weeks of tests and hospitals and getting checked out by different doctors, Gabriel was finally diagnosed with EHOS. Extreme Heats Omega Syndrome. It kind of speaks for itself.
"Helping. Hopefully." Dean said as he took a deep breath and dipped the bed with his knee. Gabriel frowned at him then grunted as Dean actually sat on his ass.
"No, no, that's... It's okay." Castiel said snapping out of it and finally turning to face Balthazar.
"Railing? You..." That's when he noticed the U-shaped metal that was mounted on the wall, extending from the bottom of the stairs all the way to the top. "How did... Was..." Dean tried, not sure how to ask. It was ludacris to think Azazel would have this for any reason. One thing Dean knew, these things cost a fortune. And Dean should be up on his feet in a few days, so that meant that this was for Sammy.
Gabriel finally reached the big gate and pushed the gate doorbell, then waited for someone to answer.
Next week was the same, they spent six evenings together, just sitting on the bench and watching the beautiful colors change from light, to yellow to orange and red until the night took over as the sun slowly set. Dean managed to get a few more words out of the alpha, and each made goosebumps crawl all over his skin as arousal washed over him. Generally, the alpha was responding well to him, to his smiles and stolen touches, but Dean still yearned to set his lips on him.
Empty table with a white note meant a reservation, not that this place needed it anymore. And a reservation usually meant a bachelorette party. And that would mean that Dean might have a date with a bunch of girls tonight instead of ending up with Alistair yet again.
Because that is what he always was - a screw-up. Since he was sixteen he has done nothing but make one mistake after another, starting with his father and brother, then with Azazel and the jobs he was asked to do.
"Oh. Please don't tell me this was the only copy you had?" He asked and Castiel hated that look in his eyes.
Dean did get him that toothbrush and a razor so that he could shave and he also bought a whole lot of other stuff too. Castiel insisted he helped, if not by putting things away, then by sorting them into groups so that Dean could put them away more efficiently, separating things that would go into a pantry, perishables and toiletries, just like he would do in the shelter. Made him feel useful, to an extent.
"Yeah, I um... We tend to fall asleep watching TV, so I thought that... This was we could be a bit more... Comfy." Castiel replied sheepishly and Dean barely contained the girly squeak that wanted to escape his throat and he barely contained himself from coming up to Castiel and giving him a small peck on the lips as a thank you. He picked up the remote and went to sit on the wide bed and then paused when a thought occurred to him. The point was not to hold back, right? So Dean turned back, walked over to Castiel and kissed his lips in one small short brush, his entire face burning up red, and then ran back to the bed, sitting and turning the TV on like nothing happened.
Dean expected a spirit, or maybe a witch, heck, he even thought it might be some mythical forest creature, but he was wrong, to an extent. The forest, or the jungle slowly grew silent, and that was always a bad sign. Here and there a small sound came, a branch broken, a ruffle of leaves, a crunch of dirt. The air around them grew thick as strange darkness settled around them and Dean could see Cas’ eyes darting everywhere, but he was just as lost as Dean was, his angelic mojo probably way too low to detect anything.
"And lemme guess, he underpays you. No, don't answer that, I know he does. He thinks that since his workers don't have strict deadlines and can work from home that it gives him the right to cut their pay. A friend used to work for him, so I know." Dean said and paused, contemplating something for a moment before he started talking again. "Listen, if you ever decide you had enough of that asshole and want to find something..."
And then he was twirling on that pole and when he bent on it, showing off his flexibility, Castiel felt so aroused, he had to get away, he had to get out before he embarrassed himself. He almost made it to his car and felt such relief when he managed to reach it without anyone noticing his hard-on.
"May I kiss you?" There was an urgency in his voice, as if he would spontaneously combust if he wasn't allowed a kiss and Castiel didn't even get a chance to finish his nod before Dean's hands were cupping his face and his soft lips were pressed against his.
Castiel could not comprehend how he was able to simply disregard everything that happened to him, how he was able to even joke about it. Except,  perhaps it was not a joke. And there was nothing simple about it. Perhaps this was how Dean dealt with what happened.
His craving for chocolate intensified, but no matter how much he ate and in what form, none felt quite right. It angered him, each wrong flavor making his skin crawl, his head and stomach started to ache and his body felt like it was on fire.
He could sell a kidney, but that would only get him covered for a month or two, and the recovery period would cost him a month or two, so, that's out of the question. Not to mention leaving him with a nasty scar that would render him even less desirable.
But he was so attentive, like Zach was, only it felt different. It felt as if he was doing it both to help Castiel and to sooth his own worry, not just to placate him. He seemed to genuinely care about his well-being. So it was understandable that seeing that plastic wrap almost made Castiel's heart stop. Zach would get these 'ideas', he was... Creative and would transform any household item into... a tool in a sexual act. Castiel found it interesting at first, but not later when he had his hands tided with the thin office tape, cutting into his wrists, his mouth stuffed with crumpled paper, tasting the ink, his ass stamped with big red letters that say DENIED, his hole filled with five different-colored markers.
If not, that would be a major safety violation, and if Dean had to go outside and use a window washers scaffolding, he would, fuck his fear of heights.
"Hey, Gabe. How you've been?" Dean asked and didn't wait for a response before he turned towards his brother, drawing Gabriel's attention to the big alpha. "This is my brother, Sam."
"I'm not a coward!" Castiel shouted, still sounding pissed off, but with tears brimming in his eyes. Good, he was upset. Maybe that would get him out of his shell and make him do something, anything. Castiel's chest were heaving, his ears burning a hot shade of red and he was gritting his teeth at his step brother who just threw him a
Castiel was indeed surprised by Dean's insinuation, but didn't want to question it for now. The fact was that Dean wanted him to put an arm around him and it felt so good to be able, to be allowed to do it. Why question a good thing, right? When his arm went around Dean, it felt good, but then a few minutes later Dean almost snuggled to his chest and that - felt amazing.
The alpha started rocking them, the fluent motions making Dean see stars and quickly reaching those incredible heights. Every once in a while, he would snap his hips, making the omega cry out, while his dick would slap against his stomach. The alpha did not touch it.
Castiel just needed to sit and take a deep breath. He should fire Zachariah, he really should, but he hoped that the man would see the error of his ways. After this... He wasn't so sure.
And the more time he spent with Castiel, the better he felt, smiling and laughing and simply enjoying their walk through the park and next to the small pond filled with ducks and swans. Castiel told him he talked to Nick, and that he knew about his past even before, that they were friends now, through Tony. He told Dean he shared with Nick what sort of an arrangement they had, and that Nick was ok with that, but that he didn't comment much.
Dean bit on his lower lip as he sat at his desk and contemplated why the brothers would even have such a conversation. Why would Cas' brother think Cas needed to socialize? Why would he think Cas was closed off? Did something happen to make him feel that way, or was he always like that?
So when he got back to his apartment and Castiel gave him a questioning gaze, one that said he would like to know what happened, and how Dean is doing, Gabriel knew he couldn't tell him. Not because he didn't want his brother to mate, or be happy with an omega, nor did he think ill of Dean. What worried Gabriel was that his brother was too soft and too lenient to make such a decision right now, especially considering what he went through, and that he might decide to take the easy way like he always did.
"Don't... don't want to get all wet while cleaning the mess..." Dean said, his breathing on the border of panic, but he was managing and pushing forward and keeping his eyes locked with Castiel's and that was helping too. Castiel froze and just watched him take the rest of his clothes off, his breath hitching a bit when he saw Dean's erection.
"It is Dean. Just like the first night we met. I... I could see the fear in your eyes... That's why I stopped. I just... I was too angry and tired last night to see it, this time. And I am sorry. I am so sorry."
Lilly was a playful blond, almost childish sometimes, but apparently her mouth knew no length. Abby was a redhead, a mix of a housewife and a dominatrix. Ruby... Dean liked Ruby the least. She was a brunette with a stick up her ass, if that particular hole wasn't filled with someone's dick. And while Lilly always liked to tease him, she saw him for a sixteen years old kid that he was, and decided not to venture into those waters. Abby tried to 'show him around'. But she was just too damn scary sometimes and Dean stayed clear of her.
Still he didn't want to disappoint Dean, so he pressed a button on the roof of the limo, and spoke up. "Take us downtown, Benny."
"Yes." Castiel breathed out. It was not a question, it was a confirmation. He reached for Dean, his hand grabbing the hunter's wrist and only slightly pulling. The barest smile tugged Dean's lips and he inched closer, allowing himself to be pulled in. One of his knees dipped the bed and soon enough, Dean was crawling on the bed, on top of him.
The closer Cas got, the more uncoordinated his movements got, and the more Dean whined to feel him inside, to feel his knot. And then the alpha let out a loud growl, so powerful it vibrated from his chest and through Dean's entire body, pushing Dean towards his own orgasm, but not fast enough. A moment later, the alpha was spilling all over his thighs and coating his balls with his spunk, the idea so thrilling for the omega. And then another thing happened.
"I am happy too. Over the moon, actually. But I meant how's your rut?" Dean asked and watched Cas consider the answer. The alpha looked back up at him and smiled after a moment.
Balthazar did not know where Castiel was. And Dean got a feeling like he was being dismissed, though Balthazar was technically his subordinate or whatever. He was hiding something, but Dean didn’t know what it was. There was no sign of Michael either, but when Dean came across his father, King John told him that he conversed with Castiel about an hour ago in the dining hall. Going there, Dean ran into Sam who confirmed Castiel was in the dining hall, but left a few minutes ago. When Dean came across Benny again, the guard said he hadn’t seen him since he took Gadeel’s place as the guard, so that the man could attend to his bodily needs. It was when Castiel first left his room, and also explained why Garth thought he took over from Elias, the two men looked so much alike. Eventually, Dean ran into Meg who told him she saw Castiel leave towards the gardens.
By the time he reached the doors that lead out into the gardens, Lady Charlotte and Lord Samuel were entering, headed for the diner hall in time for lunch, both whispering and snickering about things Castiel could not hear.
“Ready to go? Or have you more work? Maybe I can help?” Cas said suddenly popping up just as Dean was whipping down the counter in the kitchen. Dean felt his face crack in two as he smiled widely, feeling happy that Cas came looking for him.
"Castiel. My name is Castiel. And before you ask, no, I am not a foreigner, I... I have absolutely no idea what my parents were thinking when they named me." The sound of Dean's laughter filled the room at the last comment just as the microwave sounded it finished reheating the food. Castiel brought two trays over to the couch and they sat, each on the farthest end and ate in relative silence. Dean complimented him on the food choice once, and another time he told him he had a nice place, and Castiel just muttered a few
"So, Baron, I heard you came from a large family, that you have many brothers and sisters, is that true?" The Baron's eyes lifted up, glassy and with a few unshed tears in them. He tried to hide his anxiety by putting on a smile, yet everyone could see it was forced.
"Oh, he's just picking up the suitcases out in the curve." Gabriel said, and right on cue, Castiel rounded around the gate, four big cases in hands. Two under his pits, and two in his hand. Dean sucked in a breath, thinking those couldn't be light and the mere thought of a strong alpha send all sorts of nice tingles through Dean's body.
Castiel smiled back, awkwardly, but certainly feeling a bit more relaxed. "Ok, ok. How about we start again?"
Making sure not to react at all, Castiel just kept his look unwavering as Dean's hands lowered his sweats and his briefs at the same time, exposing his... flaccid cock. No matter how hot it felt to have Dean hands back on him, no matter the small jolts of arousal this sent through his system, it still wasn't enough to make him hard so soon. Not that he wasn't headed in that direction.
He looked up just as Castiel came to a stop, his vibrant green eyes widening by only a fraction, his smile faltering for just a second before it was back up full force.
Hated that he was so confused about what he wanted, hated that he was so scared of being hurt and tricked again, hated not being able to act like a normal person just once. His chest clenched hard, so hard it made it very hard to breathe, but Castiel didn't care.
Or maybe not? Maybe he could still take Crowley up on his offer and compromise himself and his principles in the name of survival? But what kind of life would it be, knowing he had sold himself out?
Castiel spent three more hours in the shelter, talking to people, cleaning, handing out fresh cleaned blankets and toiletries. It was about that time that he felt his stomach grumble. He stopped and frowned, and considered the time. It was close to 4 PM and he realized he hadn't eaten anything today. He was just about to reach and check his wallet, to see how much cash he had and what he could buy when Balthazar called him over. It seemed as though Meg was being more difficult then usual so the man asked if Castiel would help him out in the kitchen.
This morning he woke up with a wide smile on his face as he was welcomed by the sight of the cutest, funniest facial expression of one Castiel Novak. The man had his mouth slightly ajar, drooling all over the pillow, but it was the most relaxed he has ever seen him. That was another reason why Dean pushed himself to be a bit more normal, and a bit more open about what he wanted, just for a chance to see Cas not worry about him so much.
A small smile flashed upon her face, gone faster then it came. She reached into her pocket and Castiel stiffened, following her movement, but all she did was take out a small iPod and walked over to the window. She set it up, plugging it in, so that it wouldn't loose power, then turned towards the statue of a man.
Things that would normally take two hours, he completed in half an hour and rushed back to the apartment, only to find Cas exactly as he left him, sitting outside and reading. The man smiled when he saw Dean return, and gave him a small wave, then went back to his book.
Half of the pie finished, and both of them stuffed, the two of them settled to watch the stars as they slowly started to light up in the evening sky. The omega was pressed against him as the alpha had his arm around Dean, breathing in his amazing scent. He could feel another wave slowly creeping up on him, so he knew he didn't have enough time.
“Yeah, no, I am done, and ready to head back.” He replied and motioned for Cas to lead the way. His apartment was about seven blocks away, so he felt jittery walking all that way with Cas by his side. Should he try and talk, or remain quiet?
Dean walked almost on autopilot to the big bathroom and even if he saw it before, he was still mesmerised by how huge it was. He glanced at the hot tub, wondering how it felt to lie in the warm water, massagers making your body relax, bubbles around you smelling of something flowery...
Confused by the sudden motions, Castiel had no time to figure out what Dean was doing when he found himself slammed against Dean's body, his erection fitting perfectly between Dean's ass cheeks making him gasp.
That grotesque grin and that predatory spark in his eyes, Dean knew those, but how? He wasn't a client, not even a one time deal. Maybe he visited the club, watched him dance? The man's hand brushed over Dean's shoulder and he shuddered, but remained still.
would probably make the hunter smile and ease this entire situation, but that wasn’t something Castiel would say, that wasn’t something he would do. So instead, he turned around in Dean’s arms and looked deep into his eyes. His hand rose to cup his cheek and he let his eyes slip closed as he leaned in, pressing his lips to Dean’s. The kiss was warm, and nice, not charged like those of last night, but still filled with heavy emotions.
The sun was peering over the horizon as Gabriel unlocked the gate and entered the yard. It has been a long, tiring Saturday night at the Roadhouse, and he was glad it was Sunday, his day off. As soon as he stepped into the estate, some sort of ease washed over him. This place had this effect on him, ever since he entered it and walked it's hallways. But lately, he felt it when he was outside in the yard too.
“I… Am.” Castiel replied, his focus drawn to the gorgeous curve of Dean’s member, and the angel could feel his own vessel responding positively.
People always feared Castiel and felt repulsed, offended even by his subgender. There were two omega girls that visited Missouri's bakery, complete wackos that were interested in him as a possible mate, but Castiel was clearly uncomfortable around them and would hide or try to stay away from them. Two things Gabriel never found out, and that was because Castiel again didn't think it was something wrong - first one was that Meg cornered him once and kissed him, the awful taste of menthol cigarettes lingered long in his mouth. Second one was April catching him when he was throwing away the trash, in the back alley, occupied his personal space and kissed his neck, then shoved her hand in his pants. He did not like the touch and was able to get away thanks to some homeless guy.
"... I mean only if you want. You... You don't have to answer now, I'll just send a limo and... See what you decided then."
Sure, he had people give him food before, but it was mostly some leftovers and it was because they felt sorry for him, pitied him. This... This felt different. If this was a movie, he would have thought that a romantic setting of a dinner like this would serve one purpose - for the man to get into his pants. But that didn't make sense, not with the situation they were already in. So what is it?
"Alright, listen up!" The driver shout out. "I got a bad back, and my contracts says I am a driver, not an unloader, so you want this stuff, you gotta carry it out yourselves, capiche? Now, get a move on, come on..." He shouted as he opened the back door to a truck filled with boxes. "I got a nearly four dozen boxes, and I gotta be outta here in thirty, so chop, chop."
But then Castiel wouldn't wake him again and the would cramp up on the two-seater and then Dean would feel guilty... No, they should sleep in a proper bed. Fall asleep like last night. That was nice. That memory would always put a Dean's face. Waking up, knowing that even if he left for work, Castiel still left a small kiss on his cheek.
"I don't care. They could survive one day without me. I just want to lay here and hold you in my arms the whole day, and just... Enjoy the life." Castiel commented. Dean's face still had that smile plastered on as he shook his head. He leaned and stole one more kiss before he whispered one word - "Tonight".
"I know people usually forget to eat in these situations, so..." she said shyly, her voice almost a whisper. Castiel looked back up at her eyes for a moment, then nodded and took the offering.
Lucky for him, his first private lap dance went without an incident. The black man, and even Dean had to admit he was handsome in a way, just watched him with hungry eyes as Dean stripped for him and whigled his ass in his face. He stuffed a hundred dollar bill down the front of his black underwear, turned away and left. Dean later learned his name was Michael.
Sam once more obligated, picking up the rhythm with every new thrust and slowly getting lost in the delightful feeling of the omega's nice, warm hole. Gabriel moaned and rocked forward with each thrust, trying to push back to meet Sam's movement, but pretty soon failing, as the alpha pounded harder and faster. His breath started to hitch, his orgasm bubbling just out of reach. His shaky hands couldn't hold him, and he slumped forward, hissing at the pain that shot through his back.
"Yes, right. I apologize. It's just that... When Mr. Kipling came and took my laptop, I had personal information on it and I would like an opportunity to retrieve it..." Castiel started, but Mr. Crowley quickly cut him off.
He reached and ran his fingers down Cas' forearm, guiding the palm of his hand around Cas' wrist to the pulse point, slowly reaching lower until he had the man's hand in his, their fingers intertwined. Cas glanced at their joint hands and there was the smallest smile on his face, but he didn't look up.
Slowly they walked up to the door and Gabriel was about to knock when he heard someone's footsteps echoing and the door swing open, revealing a good looking man in his thirties, with green eyes and a curious look in his eyes.
"You... Oh my God..." Cas said, looking overwhelmed, his eyes tearing up as he kept looking at the screen. "Th... Thank you..." He barely managed, glancing at her, before bringing his eyes back to the screen.
He went through the motions on the other two dance routines, not even listening to what song he was dancing to anymore, his eyes always fearfully slipping on the disgusting man before him, and Dean wished he could just black out and wake up tomorrow in pain and not have to live through the humiliation of being used worse then a blow-up doll. Just on the last part of the act, he saw Alistair grin at him, and the cabbage really wanted to make a reappearance.
Dean gave him a sympathetic look that lacked the usual pity he would get from Balthazar on occasion, then smiled kindly and lovingly, not saying anything about it more. Instead, he opted to change the subject, yet even the new topic left a sour taste in Castiel's mouth. "So I see you moved to the King's chambers. I went looking for you in your old room."
Suddenly, Castiel stopped and quickly pulled away just a bit, enough to make eye contact with Dean. Confusion flashed in Dean's eyes for a moment as Castiel kept his fixed gaze upon them, searching and Dean instantly remembered that same look in Castiel's eyes back then, on their first night. He hadn't known what that meant then, but he did now, he knew Castiel was still fearful of making a wrong move, of Dean's reaction and of hurting him in anyway. Dean wished so hard he could just come out and say it, say he was alright and that he wanted this, that he wanted Castiel, he wanted the intimacy between them to grow. But voice out what he wanted was still very hard for him, so...
Castiel sighed in annoyance. He wasn't that fragile. His need to romanticize things would sometimes get out of hand, and then everything seemed blown out of proportion. I mean it isn't like Dean meant to break his heart, right?
It wasn't so strange to find that the place had the same layout as his apartment downstairs, but it did seemed... Darker? Gloomier? Scarier?
"I... Iwn t c you strp." Dean whispered, and screwed his eyes shut for a moment, taking a deep breath. Before Cas could even ask what was it that he said, Dean repeated his words loud and clear. "I want to see you strip. For me. I want to lay here and watch you dance for me. And then I want you to lay beside me..." Dean said in one breath and it seemed like he wanted to say more, but he ran out of breath and was probably discouraged by the setback to have the bravery to say more right now.
"Of course. I love milk." As soon as the words left his mouth, he closed his eyes and shook his head, feeling a bit dumb for blurting that out like that. "What I meant was, that is great. I am kinda hungry. Thank you, Dean."
His freckles-dusted nose and cheeks under those beautiful eyes that held the world in them, sparkling with wonder and excitement, but always with a hint of sadness.
"We... we got a delivery. I, um..." Balth started but trailed off just as the driver of the truck came around. He was an older guy, short, with grey hair, glasses and a nametag that said 'Frank'.
"He deserved it, and more." Dean replied, his eyes a bit distant and Castiel couldn't help but wonder if that had anything to do with Dean's own family, with his brother. Sammy, did he call him? Castiel hummed his agreement, watching Hannah talk about her kids and showing everyone their pictures. "You do too, you know..." Dean said, and when Castiel turned to him, he found the man looking at him with a scared hint of hope. Castiel wished so that he could believe that spark in those eyes, wished so hard it meant something more, but he was burnt too many times.
"Fine! I'll prove it to you! I will prove that I am not wasting my life living in a bubble, that I am not a chicken! I am not afraid to go out and do something adventurous!"
That was odd. Mr. Crowley never called, Castiel always dealt with his secretary Ruby. She was obnoxious and condescending, and Castiel suspected she never handed his manuscript to Mr. Crowley, but dared not ask. He did his work well and was paid accordingly, or at least he thought so. The phone rang again, Mr. Crowley's name flashing on the screen once more, and the odd just transformed into extremely strange. A tingle of fear crept in his mind, it must be something really important for him to be calling twice in a row.
While his chapter is in a chronological order, it covers sixteen years of Dean's life - the most... memorable moments.
"So does this mean I will get to see you tomorrow too?" Castiel said softly, and maybe a bit teasingly and it did just what it was meant to. Dean relaxed and his lips twitched to form a smile, but he shied away from those piercing blue eyes and just nodded. Castiel's smile widened, some warm feeling filling his chest, either from Dean's agreement to see him again or from the blush on his cheeks, or maybe even both. "Ok, then. Go and rest a bit, and Benny will pick you up tomorrow. Whenever you're ready." Dean nodded once more and turned to open the car door.
He was however lucky today and Castiel showed up just after breakfast. Dean felt so happy and overwhelmed that he almost ran to the man and hugged him, but the expression on Castiel's face stopped him. There were no bad emotions in his eyes, just surprise. Balth walked in their line of sight, breaking it, and Dean just... Ran.
"I mean..." Dean continued "I know you don't like what it represents, but... The position... It is sooooo good."
"Lucky for you, I happen to have some sweet cheese. I could use your help with the eggs, pieces of the shells always somehow sneak past me." Sam replied, that smile still lingering and those mossy eyes sparkling up as they met Gabriel's hazel ones. In an instant, something clicked and Gabriel felt a wave of... Something nice wash over him.
"He didn't own you Dean, when he was paying for your company, just like I... Just like I don't. I... God! Last night, when I.. – he drew a shaky breath, heeling shame wash over him – When I yelled back and ordered you to... God, Dean, I am so sorry."
Ok, so he hasn't really felt like that before, and he wanted to be held, not the one doing the holding, but still. The song kind of hit the right spot, asking the same question he was scared to ask himself out loud, to even admit he thought about it in such a way.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake!" Gabriel threw his hands up in the air. "You suck at this!" He added, then pulled a chair and sat opposite Castiel. "
Dean cared about him, he said so himself. Zach was never like that. Looking back now, he was more manipulative, saying too many sweet things and spewing compliments when he wanted something, but never asking Castiel what he wanted, what he needed or taking anything he said into consideration. Dean on the other hand... He seemed too good to be true.
"Don't get me wrong, I care about you. I care a lot. I just want to make sure this is something you want. That it's not something you're doing as a thank you, that you don't think you...
"Excellent. The old man died, apparently he had a heart disease he didn't even know about. Since there was no will and testament in case of his death, his assets all go to his adoptive sons. Now this is were things get interesting - apparently, sixteen years ago Mr. Gold adopted two boys, age sixteen and twelve, after a car crash took their father's life. Mother was already deceased. He took upon himself to take care of the older boy, and made arrangements for the state to pay hospital bills for the other since he was badly injured in the crash. And here is the bonus, since I knew where to look now, I was able to follow the cash that Azazel took out of the club to a doctor there, one Raphael Helbreder. My guess, he wasn't paying him to help the boy, you know... But I have no clue yet as to what it might be... Want me to find out?"
The angel outright moaned as Dean's firm body pressed against Castiel's, pressed him deeper into the soft mattress, pressed his glorious cock against Castiel's own. The hunter leaned in, his hot breath on Castiel's neck made him shiver and he let out a small embarrassing sound when those warm lips touched his skin. "Oh…" He let out as Dean's hands started caressing, lowering to his hips and keeping them steady because apparently, Castiel could not stop thrusting up, seeking friction.
Not be seen, not be heard. An old alpha told him that when he first came to the training centre and Castiel followed that moto from the start. And sure, he got a lot of beatings, but becoming so lenient yet still a strong alpha, it made him a perfect specimen for the experiments. His worst were milking for samples and genetic injections where they actually tried to alter his body chemistry. The first was highly embarrassing and it hurt when he was overstimulated, the second would leave him in such gut-wrenching pain he would be curled up on his bed for days.
Still, it would have been nice if the alpha would respond with something like 'I already fell for you.'... You  know, considering he pretty much fell on his knees before Gabriel. Twice. But Gabriel knew better then to expect something like that, even if some of Sam's actions spoke favorably. The alpha was young and had his whole life ahead of him, he didn't need to be bound to an old fart with a serious medical condition.
“Would you… Do it? If you were me?” Castiel asked, making Michael’s eyes snap back to meet his gaze, pausing his actions. He seemed just as uncertain as a moment ago, though a lot more defeated.
"Oh, I am going to fuck you soooo good, ruin that perfect tight ass of yours completely for that pompous fuck, that Azazel won't have a choice but to give you to me." Alistair whispered into his ear and Dean let out a whimper, knowing Alistair always kept true to his word. The ramming continued, more and more forceful with each thrust and Dean couldn't hold back the tears anymore.
Okaaaaay, really getting late now. Castiel got up so abruptly that Dean almost fell over, but then he rushed to catch him, extending his hands and setting them against the omega's shoulders. Their eyes met, so incredibly close and wide and beautiful, coming together like the land and the sea. Castiel sucked in a breath, but didn't run, no matter how much he wanted to, instead, he helped Dean get his balance.
They kissed, long and tender, just enjoying  the simplest brush of lips and the closeness of one another. At the same time, they pulled apart, and Dean looked at the man before him knowing in this exact moment, he would give everything he had for him.
"Well, Dean. You're in luck. I just happen to have some Chinese leftovers at home that I would mind sharing with you." Castiel said, keeping his eyes on the man, purposely not looking at his step brother who was clearly listening in and was about to protest. There was a difference between helping people and doing something potentially dangerous, this was not what Gabriel hope to accomplish. But before he could say anything, Castiel spoke up again. "In fact, I have a working shower and a free couch, I bet you could use one good nights sleep?" Castiel said and watched as Dean's eyes widened at the offer and glanced at Gabriel before nodding uncertain.
"You... You want to keep me?" The alpha asked, so shyly and with such hope, Dean felt his heart split in half.
He swayed his hips to the music, dropping the heavy jacket of his shoulders. His eyes roamed the crowd as his hands came up his stomach all the way to his oiled up chest. His expression remained blank, mysterious even when he spotted him - the most vile man Dean has ever met.
Something was definitely off when his own brain was being helpful and polite. But Dean still shifted his eyes away from Castiel's hot body to the redhead behind him. Wait, she was familiar, Dean knew her. She was... Meg? Yeah, that was Meg, Sam's nurse. But what was she doing... Oh, shit. Sam!
Castiel's hand slowly crept up his thigh and just as he started pumping those two fingers , his hand clasped over Dean's cock and started stroking lazily. His fingers twirled up inside, and Dean let out such a loud dirty moan that he immediately blushed and closed his eyes ashamed, his hands coming up to cover his face. It was so strange how even this part felt that good, with Cas going so slow, dragging it all out making Dean more and more lost in that subspace between awake and total bliss.
Dean surged forward and captured Castiel's lips with his, pouring all those things he wanted to say and the things he couldn't into the most passionate and loving and breathtaking kiss he ever delivered. And damn, when the alpha started kissing back, his movements growing more bolder and dominating and oh how Dean loved it.
He spoke to Tony earlier and the doctor assured him there was very little, next to none chance that what they were doing would cause Sammy harm in any way, much less kill him like Dean feared. Still, he was poisonous to everyone around him, he knew that. That was why he didn't have friends, that was why he didn't get attached. Until he met Castiel and... Forgot about it.
"Hello, Dean." The alpha somehow managed, his voice so deep and strong and it shouldn't fit his current pinkish cheeks and his bashful acting, but somehow it made him even more attractive and interesting. Dean's smile grew wider and he leaned in and brushed his lips against the alpha's. Castiel's eyes immediately fell closed as if he was relishing the moment and when Dean backed away, a small breath escaped him, something between a sigh and a whine. The sound made Dean chuckle.
. Many alphas were killed, omegas too, a lot of them lost their lives, the bloody massacres and the tortures each side endured, it was so bad. The grandparents, the ones that managed to survive told the stories that gave their grandchildren nightmares, but it made them understand why the world was like this now.
"You... You have... Here..." A combination of some huffed words and pointing to his own mouth did the trick and Dean Oh-ed, quickly picking up a napkin and wiping most of it off.
Because if he resigned again from Crossroads Publications Inc., Mr. Crowley would definitely keep his manuscript, one he spent years perfecting. A long tale of dungeons and dragons set in modern time with a heavy plot of suffering and fighting to break through, of healing and love. And a little dragon afraid of heights.
The moment he caught it in his mouth, his tongue swiped over it, and Castiel's hums weren't hums anymore, but rather low, silent moans, and yet, he did not wake. Dean continued to swirl his tongue around the hardened bud for a moment longer, feeling the rumble that originated deep within Castiel's chest, the sound so elating, it made Dean's arousal blossom and he couldn't wait to see what other sounds he could drag out of the strong man next to him.
The next few hours seemed like a total waist of time as Tony made him take a shower, redress in his, slightly tighter outfit and forced him to sit and have breakfast. He tried to persuade Castiel that he should take it easy, and that Dean will turn up, but the last straw was when he said he should trust the police to find him. Deep down, Castiel knew his friend meant well and that he was worried about him, but he didn't have time to sit and relax and hope that thing will turn out alright.
Castiel settled back down to the sitting position, taking in one deep breath and letting it out, his eyes never leaving his omega. His skin wasn’t as ashen as it was before, some color coming back to his cheeks and Castiel relaxed only a tiny bit knowing that Dean’s state was improving. No matter how much time it took, Castiel would remain by his side to make sure it remained that way.
No, Dean couldn't believe that. The man was obviously great looking, and maybe a little shy... No, shy wasn't really the word to describe him.
"Sss. Stop. Stop. I... I'm ticklish." Castiel lied. Dean was obviously doing all this because he wanted to, cleaning him and... servicing him and it all just struck a bit, and Castiel just had to draw the line at Dean washing his feet. Maybe he wanted to, maybe he had a foot fetish or something, and if so, Castiel will allow him access to his feet, but not... not like this.
What will he do? The money Alistair has been offering and the paycheck he got for dancing, and for the occasional private dance... All of it combined just isn't enough, his last chance was to find a sponsor. He could only hope someone else might come along, but deep down he knew that won't happen. He was getting too old for this game. So what else could he do?
So he leaned and took the bite, for some strange reason keeping his eyes trained on the omega, yet Dean's own slipped to watch his mouth part and accept the small offering, wrapping his lips around the fork and letting Dean slide it out, empty. Dean's own mouth was parted as he fed him some mashed potatoes and a piece of the salad, eyes widening and breathing heavier by the second.
But what Castiel ended up saying, and for the love of everything that is holy, he did not know why he would choose to say that, was "Do I... Do I still have syrup on my face?"
The small smile Cas offered as a thank you damned Dean's heart all over again, shattering it to pieces once more.
"I am... enjoying pretty much." He heard Dean reply to his previous statement, tripping over his words a bit, but smiling nonetheless. "It... it is really good." Well, Dean definitely liked it, so that's good. And then Castiel started to wonder...
"You are the hottest alpha I have ever met. My Alpha." The omega said as he moved closer, his knees dipping into the couch around Castiel's hips, straddling him. He positioned himself above the alpha and then slowly sank down on his cock. "God, you feel so good, so... Perfect. It feels..."
He gasped and his erection bobbed up with interest as Dean's hands snuck down to his shirt, nice and slow, then ripped it open and letting it fall to he side, leaving him in nothing but his blue tie. Dean grinned and wrapped it around his hand, pulling Castiel up, and the man went willingly, figuring that Dean wanted to remove what remained of his shirt.
"I..." Dean started, but must have seen Castiel's shoulders tense up, because he changed course. "I hope you don't mind that I decided to work here? If it bothers you, I can always go find another shelter to help out."
"I... I hope this is ok. I wanted to..." He seemed to struggle with his words and Dean had no idea why. This whole thing looked like a set up for the talk, one that usually happened between two people who were breaking up. And that made no sense, not in this current situation and Dean thought that maybe he should stop comparing any of this to movie scenes and try to find out what is happening.
The rose travelled back down his arm, making him shiver and making his breathing pick up when it reached his chest.
"It's okay, not the first time I walked into a door. I'll be fine, just gotta stop this bleeding. You'll be okay by yourself?' Dean asked, despite his hopefully not broken nose, he wanted to make sure Castiel would be alright.
"Oh, fuck, Cas... Cas... Caaaa..." Dean tried, not even sure what, too delirious from the sensations when the alpha's tongue swept over the head of his cock just in time to gather another bead of precome, and clearly liking what he tasted because he suddenly started sucking so hard, he sucked the orgasm right out of Dean.
"Surprise lunch, huh? That wouldn't be one of those flavors that don't mix well together, would it?"
Why was Meg showing Cas the newspaper? Yeah, sure, he wrote the article, but what did that have to do with Cas? Something didn't add up.
"Nah... I'm good. In need of a shower, but... - another loving look, another kind smile - I am good. So good." Castiel managed to lift himself up and get out of the bed, and Dean moved with a small groan and huffed another smile. "I'm not racing you to the shower this time, you'll definitely win, you got the advantage here..."
Charlie stated and Dean's eyes widened in surprise. He glanced at Cas, seeing a similar look on his face then back down on his phone, at Charlie's super excited face. It was weird, how every fiber if his being wanted to shout out 'You can't have him!', but this wasn't some love quarrel, not just because Charlie didn't swing that way.
The plane started it's descend just when Castiel removed his jeans and briefs, then knelt before him, his warm palms spreading over Dean's thighs as he drew closer. Dean's wide eyes were trained on him as Castiel changes his ways, opting now for tender kisses up his leg and hard hand squeezing of anything the man could reach. Anything but Dean's throbbing, pre-cum leaking cock.
"Don't you dare come near!" Gabriel growled before Dean could even get a word out. Ketch raised his brows at the new guy who just stood there, expressionless and stone cold. Silence stretched as they all stood around the yard, expecting someone else to make a move. It was the new guy that broke the silence in the end.
"Feel better?" The deep but still somehow soft voice came from next to him and Gabriel's eyes widened. He forgot for a moment that there was a freaking alpha there with him. Even if he helped him, there was still a very good chance he would be affected by Gabriel's heat and would want to... Would Gabriel want him to? Maybe he should turn and take a look at the alpha before he made any decisions or jump to any consolation, huh?!
It was around the 12th box that things started to get strange. Not because of Dean, but because if the things they started finding in the boxes. A few random items here and there, like spoons, scrunchies, pens, children's drawings, those were regular. But then they got to their first weird item.
So they started walking, Dean throwing glances at Castiel, and he noticed, but chose not to say anything or even look back until they reached Castiel's apartment building. "So I um... I guess I'll see you tomorrow, huh?" Dean asked, and Castiel felt a bit playful, so he decided to answer with a hint of tease in his voice.
"Of course he can, you know that. He can go anywhere around the property." He said, astounded that Gabriel thought Dean or anyone else would mind. Dean honestly thought it was implied.
“Hey, hey…” He said, reaching down to grab his hands, to stop him from getting unnecessary cuts and to help him up. “... It’s okay, Cas. It’s okay. It was an accident.” He said, trying to sooth him, to chase away the fear and the shock written in his eyes.Cas apologized over and over and Dean told him it would be okay, the burn would heal, he didn’t cut his foot and the mug can be replaced, then hugged him tight. Cas seemed alright after a few minutes, but it was only a start.
And because of that he could just let himself... Feel. And fucking hell, did it feel good. The omega worked him so good, using his tongue and lips to drive him insane, then launching down for more, taking him deeper and down his throat.
"I'm sorry I woke you." Cas said blushing a bit, ducking his head and shifting where he sat on Dean's bed. Dean reached and lifted his chin, wanting to look into those ocean blue eyes and make them see the truth he carried in his.
Dean swiped a hand over his face, feeling a bit tired and lifted his gaze up just to see Meg smiling back at him.
Dean's brows creased for a second, confused as to why the alpha would stop him and was currently lifting him up a bit, but all thoughts went out of the window when the alpha practically slammed him down. Dean shouted, mind going blank, heat engulfing his entire body. Castiel started fucking up into him as he simultaneously impaled Dean on his thick cock, hitting Dean's prostate each and every time, and only a minute later Dean was cumming, his dick like a goddamn fountain shooting upright between them. Few more hard thrusts helped Dean ride through his orgasm and just as he calmed another one crept up on him, his watery cum squirting, all because Castiel spilled a fucking tsunami inside of him, then sealed it tight and secure.
It was just like this morning when he woke up and laughed and felt something warm around his heart only to be drenched in guilt for being happy. For allowing himself to to laugh and to have fun. For allowing himself anything.
"Pie's a pie. I love them all." Dean said, and even if it seemed true, Castiel still didn't believe it.
"You know, we just woke up." Dean said, looking over at Castiel kindly, clearly picking up on his nervousness. "We were gonna go have a bite to eat first, so how about we call you when we finish with that?" Those were the last words Castiel registered as his mind began to drift towards insecurity and low self esteem. His eyes fell closed and he tried to breathe through the fog, hating how easily he could go from happy to distressed in a blink of an eye, especially about something so trivial as meeting new people and having to talk about himself and his work.
Testing the water, Gabriel slowly moved Sam's head forward, then made it slip back, allowing it to slide over his length and, wow!, did that feel good. Speeding up his rhythm, Gabriel started to chase that high, impaling the alpha's willing mouth and throat on his spearing erection. He threw his head back again and let his eyes fall closed, intensifying ever sensation that washed over him.
Been writing a lot of fluff in the previous chapters, think it is time to get back to the angst a bit, don't you? The real angst...
"... my heavy ass to lean on you?" Dean finished for him, feeling so annoyed with himself, and maybe a little grumpy. Cas seemed about to pretest, but Dean deflected. "What time is it, anyway?"
"When was I ever nice?" Crowley asked looking appalled. He put aside another spotless glass and changed the subject. "So, you going off to see your brother?" Dean nodded and Crowley nodded back. That there was actually quite a nice conversation, one of the better ones he had with the man. Maybe it is just something about this day that is making everyone act nicer.
Castiel learnt a lot about Dean then. Like the fact that he had a younger brother that was a junior partner at a law firm in California. That he loved food, but pie was something sacred. That he liked the tomato rice soup because his mom used to make it. That he knew all the John Wayne movies by heart and loved cowboys, wanted to be one when he was a kid. That he was good with cars, and if he wasn't an investigative reporter, he would have been a mechanic.
Throughout dinner, Castiel remained silent and contemplative, ignoring the courtesans as they conversed with Lord Samuel and Baron Bartholomew and not noticing the Cardinal’s absence. Tired of all the thoughts that weighed him down and  of having to hide what he was doing, he took a plate and loaded it with a few fried chicken legs and mashed potatoes, with some lettuce salad aside and headed towards his room. If anyone saw him, they could just think of the prince taking more food into his room as an act of a spoiled child and nothing more. It wasn't as if any of them were important.
and that was it. There was never a moment when Castiel hated being socially awkward so much as this one. He feared he might say something wrong, ask a wrong question, and this was a stranger he was sharing his meal and couch with. This was a man he knew nothing about. Images of Dean running after him with a knife came to mind before Castiel shook them away. Luckily he remembered to turn on the TV, so that provided enough of a distraction, even if it was a cheesy soap opera.
"I don't know." Castiel replied honestly. He didn't know. Maybe he didn't want Dean to view him differently, or maybe he just wanted to play pretend everything was fine. It seemed like Dean wanted to a bit longer, but he still let Castiel pull away.
It was around 7 in the evening when they were all done and ready to head home. Balthazar complimented them all on good work they did and bid them a good night. Meg took off as soon as she could, and the people were slowly gathering in the big hall that had those camping stretch beds scatted all around. They were staring to settle in for the night and Castiel lingered a bit longer to make sure everyone got what they needed, even thought they all knew where they could find extra blankets or anything else. When he finally exited the shelter, he saw Dean awkwardly standing around, but seemed to collect himself when he spotted Castiel.
“Pff… Miss Rubette should show some wits, it is the officers who catch the criminals and not lords! Really, have you half a brain?” She said and Lady Rubette gasped in shock at being addressed in such a manner. Castiel along with Lord Samuel and Lady Charlotte tried to contain their amused smiles while Baron Bartholomew was completely clueless of what was being said, too distracted by the pretty silverware. In the corner, Cardinal Zachariah was unusually silent, seemingly contemplative, borderline brooding.
His lips were still prickling from the kiss when he let out a hum, slowly opening his eyes. The light, not too bright still managed to blind him slightly, enough for him to take a moment. The first thing that came to focus was his own arm draped over something warm. The next thing that came into focus was something light brown over the lower part of his body and he had to blink twice, moving his head downward to see that it was a blanket.
This was Cas, Dean knew this. This was the same shy alpha that blushed upon eye contact. And even though his inner Alpha had awoken, this was still Cas, and Dean knew, logically he knew he wouldn't hurt him. Still he couldn't help the silent gasp of fear when the footsteps came closer.
“I know.” Castiel said, lifting his hand and placing it on Michael’s upper arm. It was both to inform him that he sensed it too, but also to comfort the elder alpha.  “There was more to their plan, but as far as I can tell, only the king knows exactly what it is. I am not sure if the Cardinal or the prince knew.”
And then he felt it. He felt the head of Alistair's dick press between his ass cheeks, press against the rim of his hole and he screamed and started to trash violently, earning himself another elbow to the head. The pressure on his hole disappeared for a second, returning promptly, but Dean was fighting to stay awake to focus and not let the darkness take him over because God only knows what might happen to him then.
Dean shook his head as a small sting of No-s escaped his lips in a scared whisper, and his eyes filled with tears at the face before him, but when he turned and tried to open the car door, he felt someone grab the back of his head and slam it into the car's center pole. The nasal voice laughing in his ear was the last thing he heard before the darkness enveloped him.
Castiel was still concerned about Dean freezing up on him like that, but the more he thought about it and the words Dean managed to utter after his... moment, the more it became clear that it might be that Dean never actually tried the steak. In fact, the more he thought about all the possibilities of what Dean's life must have been like to make him end up doing this for a living... He wasn't just selling his body for the money. There was so much more to it than that, Castiel could see it in his beautiful green eyes.
Castiel was his shining star that led the way. That told him to fight against them and not let them break him. And he fought, tooth and nail and he bit and spit, kicked and punched until Castiel saved him. He didn't come storming in, this isn't a fairytale, but somehow, he managed to find him, to learn who had him and to threaten them into letting Dean go. Despite one of his eyes being swollen shut at that moment and the other filled with his own blood, he could still see the fear in Abraxas' face when he came back and told Alistair that Castiel Novak was on their tail and that he pulled him out of a running car. Dean was wowed by the mental image the bastard's fearful words depicted.
"Yes, yes, of course... I invited you and... well..." He paused, biting his lower lip, not sure how to convey the idea he came up with. "I was thinking... I... I want to show you something." He finally settled and beckoned Dean to follow him back to his bedroom. Dean patted along behind him, drawing Castiel's thoughts to the man's bare feet. When did he take of his shoes? Castiel always took them off when he he entered his apartment, did Dean do the same? He was startled out of his thoughts when he abruptly stopped and Dean bumped into him, but the man immediately took a step back and apologized even if it wasn't really his fault.
Cas seemed to be having a really bad day that consisted of physically hurting Dean, all by accident. He hit him in the hip with a drawer, hit him in the head with the cupboard door, tripped and pushed Dean backwards into the front door, the knob embedding itself in his lower back. Accidental bumps happened three times during lunch and one when they got off work, and each time, Dean waved it off, smiling and telling Cas it wasn’t a big deal. He wouldn’t even notice it was happening so often if Cas hadn’t started overreacting so much. Cas started pulling back, not seeking Dean’s touch in fear of hurting him and it was absurd, really.
“Dean…” The angel whined, some uncertainty in his voice and Dean whiggled, turning to completely face him. His rock hard cock brushed against Cas’ semi erect one, nesting next to it and both of them moaned, the sound coming from Cas’ throat, vibrating through his neck and over Dean’s lips, mixing with his own sounds, it was intoxicating.
Castiel's hand flew to Dean's head, his fingers in Dean's hair, but he didn't force anything, in fact, it seemed more like he was holding on for dear life, if his breathing and moaning was any indication. It was only a few minutes later that Castiel was clearly reaching that edge and he gently tried to pull Dean away, "De... Dean, I'm gonna... I can't... Oh, God I can't hold... Dean..." It was cute to see him struggle, wanting to warn Dean that he is about to come, uncertain if he should let it happen while his member was still in Dean's mouth. At his words, and in order to wipe any doubt, Dean started bobbing his head faster, one hand wrapping itself around Castiel's cock to hold him steady, the other shooting up to squeeze his ass to hold him close, and it was all it took for Castiel to loose it. His entire body convulsed as he came, hard, and shook as he actually felt Dean swallow around his cock. He stiffened, and just breathed in and out for a few moments, slowly coming to, and Dean let his member fall from his mouth, smiling to himself proudly.
But there was nothing he could do. Castiel grabbed his hand and pulled him through the crowd. Dean heard passengers being called out to gate 7 and he gulped when they neared that exit. But then they were brushing right past it, right past the crowd and past gates 8 and 9 and 10 and (yeah, we get it, you can count) all the way to gate 14, where a cute little brunette nodded at them and opened the doors for them.
Dean followed Castiel's actions and crawled over to his side of the bed, seeming as if he will get out too. He sat in the edge and remained there for a moment before he took a deep breath, looked up at Castiel's curious eyes and reached out with his hand. His palm landed on the back of Castiel's thigh, right under his ass and he pulled him closer. Castiel sucked in a sharp breath, but allowed Dean to run his hands up and down the back of his thighs just up to the his ass as he faced him, his trapped cock right in front of Dean's face.
"Oh, fuck!" Cas screamed, his body locking up and preventing him from reeling his orgasm back. He exploded, coming all over himself as Dean stood right the fuck there, at his door, staring at Cas...tiel with eyes wide and mouth drooped open into a surprised expression.
“Nobody even knew I existed. Nobody in his company, none of his friends, not even the police. I packed what I had, took some cash he had lying around and I just… Took off.” Cas let out a heavy breath, a few more tears rolling down his cheek, but there was a smile on his face, a sort of relief and calm showing on his face.
"Watermelon comes from the cucumber family, making it a vegetable, so there. That is one vegetable you eat." Cas said, and wow. The smile that spread across Dean's face was wide and genuine, a happy feeling spreading inside his chest. And over something as silly as this. Cas blushed again, but there was a smile on his face too, and by God, Dean was calling this day one of the best he's had in a long time, and it wasn't even 8AM yet.
"I did. Still do." Castiel said and approached, slowly wrapping the pouting omega in his arms. He nuzzled in his neck and took a deep breath, then pressed a tender kiss on Dean's skin, causing goosebumps to rise. "I loved everything about you. I still do."
"Yes?" Castiel tried, and it seemed to snap Dean out of his thoughts and he just shook his head and looked away.
"Mine?" The alpha said it, sounding a bit insecure, the tone making Dean's breath hitch, and his inner omega lurching to comfort and assure him.
"It's just a few drops, it's fine." Dean said smiling as Castiel inspected his hand. There were a few red spots on the skin, clearly nothing life threatening, and as Castiel looked up at Dean and saw the smile, he froze, letting Dean's hand drop from his. Shame washed over him, not just because of the fact that Dean got burnt cause of him, but also because of the way he was acting. He had no business taking and holding Dean's hand like this.
As if he could feel Dean's worried thoughts, Castiel chose that moment to reach and cup his cheek, surprising Dean who instantly melted to the touch. The hand, so soft, gentle and warm offered more than then Dean could ever dream to ask for and then the thumb brushed over his cheek bone and Dean... He allowed himself to get lost in the sensation, his heart swelling so much,it started to ache.
One thing is for sure. ZaZ, the strip club - it's finished. No more strip-dancing, no more escort service, no more prostitution. Maybe... Maybe he could turn it into a restaurant? Another smile crept up on his face at that thought. It was true, not much has changed for him. Except now he has a chance to change something for the people around him. Like Castiel did for him.
"Shhh. Don't talk. Wait - here. Use this." Castiel said as he turned and picked up a notepad and a pen and handing it to Dean. But he didn't give him a chance to write anything down, instead opting to explain. He took a deep breath and let it out with a heavy sigh, not sure how Dean would take it all.
As Gabriel watched thought the cab's window at the house, he couldn't help by think how bizarre this whole evening was. He guessed only time would yell if he made the right call or not.
"No, not a suit. I'm just... Just wanted to talk to Balth, see if he needs some help. Is he around?" Dean asked and Alfie perked up, smiling widely before saying he would go get him. It wasn't a surprise to see a frown form on Balth's face as he laid his eyes on Dean, and Dean had a gut-wrenching feeling he might not be able to overcome not even the first obstacle in his long road. Balth looked around then told Dean to follow him inside so that they could talk. They entered the kitchen and Balth went right back to work on his dough, telling Dean he was listening.
As if Benny heard his prayer, he stepped in the elevator with him and rode all the way to the top. It wasn't until that familiar ding! sounded, strangely calming Dean's beating heart even more, that Benny spoke up. " Seems like Mr. Novak isn't here yet, I didn't see his car at the parking lot."
Times were changing through his years in the club. When he turned 19, he watched Nick run off with another guy and resented him for being gay, while Azazel spat out words like "fucking queer" and "damn faggot", but he never found out if Azazel was just pissed at him for leaving. Dean wished he could leave.
"I need to... I wish to help. I need to... Would you let me help? I need to feel useful. Please." Castiel said and Balthazar just stared at him for a moment before sighing.
"Can you not contain those amazing sounds? With your eyes closed they are the only clue I have that you're enjoying this."
Castiel gasped, nearly choking on air, but his hand slipped down just a bit, right down to Dean's hole and it was all he needed, the distraction he lacked. He tried really hard to focus on extending his right arm to the drawer he had next to the bed and just when he thought he had that lube in his hands, Dean started bobbing his head, making him loose it for a split second, moaning and stuttering. Quick to regain his composure, Castiel grabbed the lube tightly, flipping it open with his thumb and pouring it onto his left hand's fingers.
"No, no... Dean..." Castiel started, his face screwing up with the pain that wrecked inside his chest, but Dean shook his head, still unable to make eye contact, and oddly enough, there was a smile on his face. Why... Why would he be smiling? Why...
Tea. That's what Castiel needed. Some good, warm tea with honey. Maybe a few cookies too. He earned them. The whole damn jar. Yes.
He stopped trying to make meaningful connections after that. Gabriel was the one constant in his life and he was happy to have him, no matter how little that was. The man was, after all, a government agent who saved the world on more then one occasion, so Castiel couldn't really be so selfish to want him around more. But he did let himself be persuaded to help out at a local shelter and that's as how he met Balthazar and later Alfie. They never socialized, never talked much and never spent time together outside of the shelter. It surprised Castiel that Balthazar would just open his home to him like that, but it shouldn't have. The man was a kind soul who fought to make the world a better place. Castiel should really thank him for everything.
Luckily, everyone else was chatting quietly, so nobody noticed his intense stare. His throat closed up for a moment as he was reminded of his home, they way things used to be when they were kids. Vivid images of his father drinking orange juice of of the carton, her mother scolding him, but still smiling and his little brother trying to sneak his broccoli into Gabriel's plate.
His hips trying to remain steady and not thrust into Dean's hand, sweat breaking all over his body, his mouth open, his breathing rugged and... his eyes... closed. Would it be to much to ask of him to open them? Dean was already allowed beyond any limit, taking what he wanted, doing to Castiel what he wanted. Dared he ask for more?
Suddenly there was a hand over his, another one on his knee, spreading warmth through him, making all those suffocating thoughts melt away.
Charlie, the tech wizard of the papers and also the editor of their online edition, crossed her arms and huffed at him. "You are too young to have a heart attack. And don't call me that."
"I take it you know who I am?" Dean offered first, but Balth said nothing, only nodded. "I wanted... I wanted to ask if you would, um... consider... letting me help around?" Dean tried. He wasn't really much of a formal talker, he liked to keep things simple, but he could do it when the opportunity required it. He wouldn't be a good writer otherwise. Balth eyed him for a few moments, frowning.
Dean, the little devil actually squeezed the bottle and let a generous amount fall all over Castiel's chest, coating his nipples and running down towards his belly button.
“It is too early for sarcasm.” He replied and Dean huffed a laugh, taking a mug and pouring coffee in it.
"Gabriel?" Dean asked and Sam's pupils widened just a bit, his nostrils flaring, because that was actually the first time Dean said his name. Naturally, Dean did not notice. "He was pissed, but I think he understood why I did it. At least he didn't tell me to stay away."
"Yes. I... I was just... Thinking about stuff." He lied and watched those worry filled eyes search his as if they could see all the way down to his soul.
"All this food talk is making me hungry. What do you say we go steal some apples from that delivery?" Dean wouldn't normally be caught dead eating something so healthy, but he was in fact hungry and... Well, he wanted to spend time with Cas, so...
Dean's eyes caught a glimpse of a white piece of paper with his name written in large letters, sitting on the nightstand. Reluctantly he reached and picked it, and held his breath as he unfolded it.
As Dean turned to get up, Castiel figured it was the perfect opportunity to get up and duck away, pretending he needed to use the bathroom. Which, as it turned out, was a bad idea. He quickly figured this wasn't going away, not without dealing with it head on. Literally. Even in the bathroom as he sneaked his hand into his sweatpants (Dean's! - thank you stupid brain), he tried to squeeze his dick, or strangle it, and it only made it worse. Only one way to deal with this.
Sam ducked his head for a moment and licked his lips, feeling a bit uncomfortable by the question, but before he could say anything, Gabriel apologized.
Truth is, ever since he laid eyes on the alpha, Dean couldn't stop thinking about him, about his scared, but so filled with life - blue eyes, and that hint of something so familiar and strong he felt in his scent. When they left, his head was spinning and he was so out of it, he nearly burnt dinner.
Dean flinched at the mention of the name. It was in fact over a month since Castiel saved both him and his brother and Dean realized he hasn't spoken or seen him in almost a week.
"Absolutely." Castiel confirmed and Dean looked down on him, those gorgeous blue eyes watching him with so much emotion and so much love, Dean felt like he could melt at the sight. He swallowed hard and still keeping his focus on Castiel's vibrant blue eyes, Dean slowly trailed his already lubed fingers around the base of the man's cock, passing down under his balls and to his hole.
There was definitely a small smile hiding under all that unruly beard, and Castiel couldn't help but wonder what the man might look like without it? Maybe he would look good, handsome even? Or maybe, he has a nasty scar that the beard is hiding? Maybe something even gruesome, like maybe someone tried to cut out his tongue and he struggled and got cut all over the... Castiel really should reel in his overactive imagination and save it for his book.
"It's ok, Cas. I actually know what you're referring to, I read that book. And it was a good one." Dean said, still trying to contain his laughter. Cas kept his blush and bowed his head, a small smile tugged at his lips, thrilled he managed to make his ome... Dean smile.
"I... I'm not... I don't know..." Cas said looking a bit uncertain, his eyes averted, but not pulling away, still staying in Dean's arms.
Suddenly Castiel thrusted up, Dean bouncing on top of him, but before he had a chance to land back down, the alpha thrusted up again. And again and again and Dean wailed, his orgasm ripping out of him as his dick exploded, thick white ropes shooting everywhere.
"Hey, there... On that coffee table." Dean said pointing to said piece of furniture to Mr. Novak's left and ended up with his mouth ajar (no, definitely not drooling) for the second time in just a matter of minutes when Mr. Novak bent over to retrieve the remote, his pants tightening making his perfectly round ass really pop up. Jesus! he thought to himself before he looked away.
Still, maybe he should have, for nothing else, then at least to catch a breath. Maybe he would have seen the text Charlie sent asking him to tell her when he gets there, so that she could call ahead and tell the staff he was coming. Or he wouldn't be so oxygen deprived that he would have thought of calling her either way, to ask for help.
There was still some lingering concern in those bright blue eyes and considering how he has been acting, Mr. Novak would think he was mentally damaged or something.
His eyes went wide as the realisation hit and he jerked his head upward, his mind still not quite believing the assumption he made, not until it saw it for itself. And there they were, watching him, those bright blue eyes filled with some strange warmth and joy that had Dean's mind working a million miles a minute trying to come up with something to say, anything. Seeing Mr. Novak smile so brightly put a wrench in the cog of the not-so-well-oiled machine inside Dean's mind, throwing him off his train of thought for a moment.
"So it's not that you want your sheets to smell like me?" The words weren't even out of his mouth when Dean snapped both hands over it, his eyes wide and horrified, filled with panic. As much as Castiel wanted to tell him that he didn't mind the tease, he could barely hold a breath as laughter tore through his lungs. It took him a moment to get his bearings, but the omega seemed to relax regardless.
Castiel snatched the papers out of her hands and skimmed over the article that was basically an exposé on the homeless in Kansas City, trying to piece together everything he had learned in the past few minutes. It wasn't until he reached the end where the author spoke of finding a kind soul on the last day of his journey and being provided a warm meal, a hot shower and a soft bed. And right there, next to it all was Castiel's name, portraying him as the angel after whom he was named.
Castiel's inner alpha roared, pressing Dean closer as he flipped them and then in one smooth motion, sunk into that sweet omega heat. Both of them moaned loudly, Dean wrapping his legs around the alpha to keep him there, and Castiel leaned his head on his shoulder, catching his breath.
They locked eyes with each other and both kind of squinted, and Castiel was just about to ask about Dean when the grumpy bartender spoke in a British accent "Isn't Dean supposed to be with you?"
Thankfully, Balthazar chose that moment to exit the shelter and draw both of their intentions, stepping in their line of sight. The man paused, looked at Castiel first, then at Dean. "I'll go take these... Wash..." Dean muttered, picked up the plastic container with the dishes and headed inside. Castiel watched him go, finally taking a breath after those green eyes were out of sight, but also wishing they never left. He startled badly when he turned and found Balthazar materialized in front of him. Wasn't he like ten feet away?
He clenched his fists into the sheets and groaned and moaned into the pillow as he thrusted into the mattress, but it only made it hurt. He knew there was no way he could come like that. He needed to loose the confining boxers and get a tight hold of the situation, literally. Finally deciding Dean was probably asleep, he stripped completely, unable to stand the feel of fabric on his skin, then sat back on the bed, scooting over to the headboard and leaning on his pillow, setting his (Dean's! Oh, my fucking God!) boxers close, so he could catch his release.
"I... I don't... I..." He tried, tears streaming down his face and Castiel lifted his hand and was ready to strike the man down, when Benny caught his hand.
"I got... I got a few more dishes and these two pots, you want me to..." Castiel said, but not after his hands began to cramp up under all the weight.
"Dean…" Castiel's  back arched, the motion pushing Dean's  cock even more deeper. It  was more intense than anything he ever felt before, and not just the physical feeling of being full, of having a part of Dean inside him, but the emotional connection. The intimacy of the act, the fact that he was feeling at all because his grace allowed him to, and most importantly, the way Dean touched him, kissed him, looked at him. Like he was the most precious thing in the world.
He ran and jumped on the pole that was in the middle of the extended part of the stage, using his arms and legs to quickly, but gracefully climb all the way to the top. He saw movement by the table, but forced himself to continue with the act.
“Anything.” Dean reminded and Cas was on him faster than a thirsty man to a well in the middle of the desert. The kiss was so heated, making Dean’s body flare up with the kind of excitement that had his cock filling up embarrassingly fast. He barely managed to place his mug on the counter before he felt Cas’ hands on his ass, drawing him closer. The rough material of his jeans made it impossible for him to determine if Cas was as turned on as he was, despite the fact that he was pressing against him and he really, really wanted to find out.
Castiel fell backwards on it and Dean crawled on top of him, letting their already hard cocks slot together and instantly creating some friction. His mouth was still on Castiel's neck, making yet another hickey as his hand reached blindly and rummaged through his nightstand drawer. Castiel gasped loudly as Dean snuck a lubed hand between them and made that friction a bit more smoother and a lot more hotter.
He couldn't deny that a part of him actually wanted to do this, but the guilt would consume him if he didn't justify his agreement, even if it was the truth. He was doing this for Sammy. Mostly.
