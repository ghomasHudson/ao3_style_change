Perhaps that was the answer after all. It would be what he had promised, to inform Mycroft of any changes. Maybe then the boy could get some help, hell, maybe
Sherlock's eyes lock on the tower of Big Ben. He frowns, weighing the possibilities.
“It’s interesting that your first instinct is to lash out rather than defend yourself,” Mycroft replied. He watched John with the cool disinterest of an exterminator watching a rodent futilely squirm with its neck snapped in a trap.
“I’m afraid some shadows still remain unduly dark to me,” John confessed, for allowing some truth to slip was the best chance he had at prevaricating. “But remembering the prospects of my future brought a very welcome light that chased away most uncertain flickers.”
He sits back onto the sofa, and stops the movie before it's finished. He gets up to leave, not looking behind him. He stops dead when he hears a small "Bye" from the couch.
“John, this way,” Sherlock kept his voice low to avoid attention. He grabbed John’s wrist to guide him around the corner, where they quickly ducked into a little booth that was sequestered by canvas screens, which kept away all curious eyes. A flickering tealight and two daisies in a small vase made up the centerpiece.
For several breathless moments, John only heard the wind rattling the panes and his heart beating in his throat. He let out a steady breath, and picked the keys up into his hand.
He finally heard Sherlock’s tenuous hold on control slip. The man groaned and thrust more vigorously than before. John wasn’t sure if the catalyst was simply a factor of stimulation over time, John’s involuntarily trembling body, or Jim molding his fingers around the shape of John’s face simply because he could. He was certain that he didn’t want to know the answer.
“Earlier,” John explains, “you said that these sorts of evenings include dancing. Where did you get that idea?”
John came around with him, and found a thick blanket along with a few pillows. “I don’t remember putting this in here,” John pointedly said as he looked right at Sherlock.
“He…found the address I dropped.”
Sherlock’s hand gently rubs the crown of John’s dick, which Sherlock has learned is the easiest way to get John as close to orgasm as quickly as possible. John feels his balls draw up against his body. He thrusts mindlessly into Sherlock’s grip, which shifts Sherlock’s weight until he’s pressing down in a way that makes John’s breath stutter more from arousal than compressed lungs.
“Wasn’t the entire point of me pouring over those journals was to attend school? You said so yourself, if I recall correctly,” John said with some frustration, “I have no doubt about the qualifications of anyone you’d employ, but I need stimulation given by more than one individual, Sherlock. I cannot be a classroom unto myself. It would be a poor discourse indeed if it resembled that of an echo chamber.”
John ran his hands down his face, and jerked in surprise when they encountered something wet. Which was strange, he didn’t remember crying, but there was a rawness in his throat that made it difficult to swallow.
As soon as Harry is sitting on the filthy pavement, John rears up with his left hand and breaks the man's nose with the heel of his hand. The man screams and staggers back, clutching his face with his free hand. John grips the wrist with the knife and twists and the weapon falls harmlessly to the ground. The man's companions finally realize what's going on, and rush in to help.
, I’ve been an incredible arsehole to you. And if you never wanted to see me again because of that, that’s fine, but I can’t stand this—this not knowing. I can’t take this bloody hesitancy anymore. And I’m pretty sure this is the most honest I’ve ever been and the most soul-bearing I’ve ever done so if you could say something before I lose my goddamned mind I would really--”
It's still not enough to stop the scream when Sherlock finally touches down.
John hated himself for how easily he was falling for these ploys. He could just walk away. He could go find Sherlock, who was undoubtedly waiting by his car, and make sure these two didn’t meet. But he had been offered a chance to prove this smug bastard wrong, and find out more about Sherlock in the process.
Sherlock chuckles at the sight of John’s restrained tears. He lets go, watching John rock back down. There’s a spastic twitching in John’s abdominal muscles that tells him John badly wants to curl inwards in an instinct of feeble protection.
John pretended to think on the cause and said, “You know, I think it began with your little hobby experiment involving the tea. Do you think that might be the source for these ailments?”
Angelo nudged John with his arm, and since John was watching for it, he didn’t flinch. “Kids, eh? Four of my own, all lovely daughters. Can’t seem to talk around them for more than five minutes before I’ve said something that has the missus smacking me on the arm.” John wasn’t quite sure what to say to that, so he tried to smile. The mention of Angelo’s marriage made John’s phone turn into a hefty weight in his pocket.
He presses the delete button a little harder than necessary and finds John staring at him. "Business partner." Sherlock answers. "Rather annoying but he gets the job done."
“Because, like me, you don’t wish to see Sherlock hindered in any way. When he knows that strangers are watching his every move, he’s distracted, listless. With your cooperation, he won’t need to obfuscate his personality for the sake of privacy.”
Carefully, he releases the fingers one at a time, and has John cross his arms over his chest. The rush of blood hurts, but it is a dull ache compared to the stinging numbness of his right side. He pushes the stick out of his mouth with his tongue, and takes a shuddering breath. Sherlock brushes his hands reassuringly across John's wrists, and leaves. John is too tired and hurting to protest the abandonment. But Sherlock does come back, with a small tub of water. Slowly, he pours the liquid over John's hip, and he can't help the yell that is forced from him.
It's John's turn to stare blankly back at the man. "Listen, I don't know you. We probably wouldn't even get along much, if we were left to our own lives, but, you're a fighter. A soldier. And we may have been from different divisions," John doesn't even bother to ask how he knows that, "but that still makes you a brother to me. So, from one poor bastard to another, here's a tip; Stop fighting. Give up. Surrender. Wave the white fucking flag. However you wanna phrase it, just let the sick fuck have his way with you and be done with it."
That divine force comes in the form of his Maths professor drawling, "My, my, what a scandalous sight."
What was the point of trying to do any of those things anyway? It wasn’t what John wanted in the first place. He jolted when the truest and most naked thought of all bared itself.
“He also conversed with me, though I’m sure he was much politer in his speech when addressing you,” Sherlock wryly said. “Though I’ll admit, a lot of the remarks he made were accurate and logical. Even in regards to my character.”
Tomorrow, John decided. He’d get some answers out of the boy tomorrow or he was going to the police.
"I've already told you John, I do own you. And you are going to learn that lesson by tonight, or this punishment will continue until you do." John almost can't process the words, but the hand pulls away as soon as Sherlock's done with his declaration.
“Keep it discreet,” Mycroft murmured, “If I’m going to supposedly use this situation to my advantage, it would be better to keep certain people guessing. And I would so hate for the family reputation to be tarnished due to your inability to remain restrained in your…behaviors, brother.”
There's a small pause from the driver's seat that makes John look over. The man coughs a laugh and jokes, "Should've stuck with Bourne." It's an innocent enough joke, but the way the man tenses his hands on the wheel set off alarm bells in John's head.
in danger.”
John wills his body to stop shuddering, and the tremors travel and concentrate on his hands. Sherlock gives his bum a soft pat, then goes back to lubing his urethra. At least he's doing this with plenty of lighting. And John knows that Sherlock's probably not a doctor by any stretch of the word, but, well. John doesn't
Sherlock nodded, but it seemed aloof. John was sure that Sherlock was busy compartmentalizing things that had been locked away inside of his head ever since he moved here. His brother, the only family he had left, had dumped him here and then showed up out of nowhere to try and interrogate his only friend. All while revealing a past that he hadn’t had the chance, or desire, to tell John about.
He seized on that point, “I don’t feel that way about him Mycroft. Whatever you and Sherlock assume of me, I’m not looking to have a…to start a…I don’t want a relationship with him.”
The car speeds towards him, and John thinks that maybe the guy is going to kill him. But he slows down as he gets close, obviously not wanting to hurt him further as he pulls him into the car. The slowing vehicle and the indecision of how to proceed on the stranger's part gives John plenty of time to limp to the other end of the street. Even with a ringing head and a limp, John manages to get away when he runs down an alley too small for the car.
Sherlock moved with a quicker grace that John would have ever guessed.
“I’m afraid movie night has been cut short due to some unexpected auditory malfunctions.”
John's eyes widened, and he twisted his head to try and get in air. Sherlock talked calmly above him. "Talking really isn't necessary for this John. I don't need to hear you degrade me right now and useless chatter really puts me off." Sherlock gasped at the end, finally able to touch his throbbing cock. John yelled against Sherlock's hand, attempting to bring to attention that he was cutting off air supply.
The discovery had been a happy accident. Digging through John’s school history had provided more than just enlightening reading. When he’d seen the name of his first body, that ghastly man that he’d only briefly met when he was brought in on his first and last drug charge, Sherlock’s fingers had begun to tremble on the page. He’d barely believed it, and a quick check of the records had confirmed it.
It’s as if he’s found a way to turn John into an instrument, without literally sliding a bow over his heart strings and vocal chords. Each shift and glide of the rod is a new tone to be struck, a new note ready to ring into existence.
John cleared his throat, “Yes, well. It’s very -uh- nice.”
“This
John felt the rush of the fight linger in his system, so he paced a few times to soothe his heightened nerves. It was lucky that his husband shouted his name before approaching, for if he’d been any closer John would have struck him in surprise.
He has no urge to flip the man onto the ground and shatter his larynx. To take him hostage and bargain him for his freedom. Instead, he just feels another crest of lethargy, and John falls back to sleep.
“No, not just
Sherlock noticed John was trying to present himself, and smirked at the futile effort. He added another finger, grinning at John’s soft gasps. The wetness was beginning to drip onto the bed in fat globs, making a damp puddle. Sherlock slowly scissored the muscle, knowing that youth and inexperience would make John tighter than usual.
If the measure of time had seemed indecipherable up the craggy cave, it was positively nonexistent on his way down. He was too concerned with his numb limbs and chattering teeth to notice how long he’d been climbing. He was caught between the need to stop for rest and knowing that respite meant risking falling into a slumber he’d never awake from.
He thinks about his mother again. How nearly every lesson was one of caution, control, and boundaries. She used to tell him that they were not gods, that they couldn’t control the natural forces, and that everyone’s will was their own.
“I, wait, hang on,” John stepped back to fully look at him, “how did you know there would be gunshots?”
It became unnervingly predictable, that when people begin to think such portrayals belong firmly in old fairytales or cheesy television programs, that they find their way onto a major segment of the evening news.
“I’m uh,” John motioned towards the bedroom, “pretty tired. I’ll see you in the morning, probably.”
The woman cowers further onto the filthy ground, but doesn't say anything. Appeased that she's going to cooperate, the man turns around and calls out, "All right, whose turn is it to go first?"
“Then it shall not be for a while,” John coyly said as he moved on top of him. He swung his leg over Sherlock’s hip, and cried out when he felt a sharp pull on his insides.
Sneaking in to the tower is more difficult than he had originally anticipated. There's a guard blocking the only entrance up. Really, are people so blind that they're not going to question a guard stationed to an inconspicuous area? It would be a simple enough thing to dismiss the guard on important government business, but he absolutely
Jim had the decency to look surprised, “Really? It’s just that this project means so much on an individual level, surely only one person should have the privilege of…reaping the benefits?”
“It’ll be good,” Mary had said as they did everything but wave goodbye to that beautiful and disgusting city, “fresh air and new people. It’ll be good for us.”
“And why is that?”
“How long, in our care, do you think you can believe in your reality, before you start to accept ours?”
When Sherlock twists the metal, John can feel his testicles draw up tight against his body. His hips don’t thrust, but twitch spasmodically. His toes curl when he feels it press down again, and John could swear to whatever God he’s given up on that he can feel the bottom of it
John turned his phone to video, and hit record. He hated how having the phone in his one hand meant he’d be slower if called upon to use the gun with the other. Even shoving the mobile away into his pocket would mean precious time lost.
"Release your...friend, and I'll give you untempered access. In addition, I will cut off all of my contacts. Of course, I will be starting afresh, but you should have no interference from my new people for approximately a month."
John didn’t hear the two men answer. His mind was caught on the thought of Mr. Hope. The driver who’d left him alone in a tavern, in a town he barely knew, and to later become accosted by two random strangers. Two strangers who had said it ‘wasn’t worth it’ and that they’d needed the money. He remembered Sherlock’s insistence that he not go into town alone, the urgency when he’d found him, and Jim’s surprise when he’d walked out of the carriage door the following day. And then the driver, that had meant to be his ride back to ‘protection’, had been found frozen and alone days later.
John wanted to be irritated. He pettily wanted to cling to anger against his husband and his perfectly sound logic. If for no other reason than anger felt far more substantial than anything he’d experienced these last few weeks. But John was aware of how childish he would be if he clung to such flimsy justifications.
He hears Sherlock exit out of his side of the car door, and feels cool air when his opens up. He shifts, groping for the top of the car door to judge the distance from banging his head. He gets a foot out before he feels someone, Sherlock, (of course, it’s always Sherlock) take him by the arm and pull him gently the rest of the way out.
“I am a student, yes, but I’m not
When the soldiers didn't have hammers, they waited until the stone began to chip away to reveal flesh, and struck them through the heart. The agony of so many savagely lost intensifies the pain in his shoulder. He scours the rooftop of the palace, praying for survivors.
Waiting for school to end was an exercise in patience, but John managed. The thought that he and Mr. Holmes will be alone in his office hasn't escaped him. But focusing on it may send John into an anxious and aroused frenzy. His friends try and get him to come along to a movie, but John declines, saying he promised Harry he'd make dinner that night.
He's grateful the creature doesn't know his daily patterns. Otherwise he'd know how obvious of a lie that was.
Sherlock nodded. It didn’t seem like he was able to do anything else. “I will. Goodnight, John.” With that, he walked into his house.
John had just started to unbutton his shirt, his mind in turmoil, when he turned around and saw that Sherlock was already naked. John’s fingers stopped moving. It wasn’t that John was new to coitus with his husband. They’d engaged in illicit activities before their wedding day, though they were discreet and brief.
"Jim is your boyfriend's 'business partner', and my 'Sherlock'." John's too busy bristling at 'boyfriend' to acerbically comment that he could've guessed as much from the scars, thanks.
Sherlock's heart is pounding with excitement. He's like a hound on a new scent, and he whips around to face which direction the creature could have gone.
Sherlock has to press harder against John’s hip to keep him still. When he still feels him buck under his hand like an unbroken stallion, he pulls back and releases the sound.
“Sherlock’s here,” John interrupted. Which didn’t seem fair. He hadn’t even gone through the trouble of coming up with a good excuse. At least Mary was trying.
“God bless your scientific mind,” Jim praised with a manic grin. “Now where are your spare cloths? We need to clean up before our dear boy here becomes glued to the sheets.”
John suddenly thought of rabbits, and wondered if this was what they felt like when they had their paw caught in a steel trap. He could only dumbly stare at his husband while he moved to get the meal placed by their bedside.
The stars had been so beautiful, but now they were like a thousand accusatory eyes. They waited in cold judgement for John to fail at explaining morality and common decency to a teenager.
“I guess that depends on where we’re going,” John said. “Knowing you, I wouldn’t put it past you to suddenly have us eating dinner atop Mount Everest somehow.”
John is good, and human. He is a short temper, mixed with strong principles, steady hands in the face of fear, and strong black tea with a splash of milk.
Now John was lying on his back, half off of their shared blanket, as a confused teenager looked down with his hands on either side of John’s torso.
“No, of course not Johnny,” Jim soothed, “I’ll have a search sent out for Mr. Hope right away. Along with those dastardly devils that tried to accost you last night. We’ll set everything to rights soon, don’t worry.”
John tossed them to the side and saw Molly startle. He pulled out files until he reached the one that he remembered contained all of the marriage certificates. Only his slipped out.
Even though John is too overwrought to scream, he can still feel the force of it vibrate through every sinew and bone. He does eventually hear his own sobs and Sherlock crooning softly in his ear. These are sounds that often accompany each other, and John grapples for the comfort in their familiarity.
Sherlock’s been rubbing small patterns with his thumb into John’s skin. He keeps passing over one particular scar between John’s thumb and pointer finger, when Sherlock had wanted to test whether or not a long incision would irreparably affect muscle movement. John’s non-dominant hand was the best specimen for experimentation. The laceration had been made with a No. 26 scalpel. John had been told not to close his eyes for the duration. He’d been allowed to flinch, but for the most part John had stared unfalteringly as his captor and his lover sliced into him.
He thinks about what it had been like to taste several glorious hours of freedom. To think that he could've run away from all of this. It hurts more than he expected. John chokes on his stuffy air. John obviously has no sense of time, but he has assured himself that he would've suffocated by now if he didn't have some source of air. Probably a hole poked at the top. Like the bugs he and Harry used to collect as muddy kids.
“Please,” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Later, as he examined each and every plant in the greenhouse for some strange strain he had never seen before, he began to wonder if he was truly going mad. It certainly could not be normal, to search for the infamous tea plant just so he could put an end to this.
John frowned and looked down at himself. His raw skin had become smoothed, his blistered hands and feet were fully mended. He unwrapped his crude bandage to find barely any evidence of his gouge. Only a small scar that looked years old rather than a day’s.
He's holding open the door, because it gives him something to do besides try and coax the gargoyle inside. He's certain that any pushing on his part will only cause him to become increasingly stubborn.
But there was an uncommon pride in those blue eyes that caught Sherlock’s attention.
Sherlock watched the boy’s face flush, and found it to be a pleasing sight. He looked at John’s clenched hands, and noticed the hard work that had gone into caring for his scrap of land, and noted the bravery it must have taken to make this journey. Sherlock considered the amount of pride he must have swallowed in order to beg for scraps from his monarch.
He uncrosses his arms and goes to open the car door, but halts when Sherlock says, “Not just yet.” John’s hand remains in the air, but he doesn’t move it towards the door. Sherlock reaches into a little pocket in the car door beside him, and pulls out a black blindfold.
“I just meant,” John’s tone was irrefutably sharp. He reigned in his temper, understanding that anyone would feel raw and vulnerable revealing what Sherlock just did, “I just meant, that you didn’t have to reveal everything about yourself to try and justify my doing a good deed. You needed help, Sherlock, and I was willing to give it. But,” and here John struggled to find the right words that wouldn’t sound condescending, “thank you, for telling me what you did. If you need someone to talk to, or to punch your brother in the face if it comes to that, I’m more than up for it.”
John gritted his teeth and yanked hard on his chain. It jangled, then went still. He stood up, gripped harder, and pulled again. It refused to move. Over and over again, John pulled at his restraints. Until his neck felt raw from chafing, his forehead dripped with sweat, and his hands were blistered from his grip on the metal.
“Well, no,” Sherlock concedes, still visibly stunned from the compliment, “that was from your dwellings. And your actions from dealing with criminals.”
“So you can see why I’m upset with him,” John concluded. He watched the reflection of the fire in the garnet colored liquid. He drank, and imagined that he could swallow the flames to burn his troubles to cinders. “I just can’t understand why he’d be so obstinate on the subject. He was perfectly supportive of my dreams in becoming a student of medicine when we first met. Now, when I finally have the opportunity within reach, he won’t allow it. It’s incomprehensible.”
That was fine, John told himself. He didn’t need to read the book right this second. He had plenty of time. He had an abundance of it, all by himself.
John turns, and his breath catches. Sherlock looks stunning. His suit is of a slimmer fit, and a deep wine red with a white shirt underneath. The buttons are black, and he's forgone the tie. Out of the both of them, John is the one with more accessories. Though maybe it's because Sherlock doesn't need that much to attract attention when he walks into a room. When they first met, there had been a magnetism even before all of the mystery that had trapped John like a fly in honey. Sherlock fills the space he's in, leaving no room for anyone else. He sneers and eviscerates with words and action anything that challenges the supreme mastery he has over everyone he's come in contact with.
"You were an outstanding British citizen tonight, it only seems fair that I do the same." Sherlock shrugs, but he really just wants to do something at least passably nice for him. He's not delusional. He knows he's not a good man and what he has planned for John Watson is deplorable but he just doesn't care. He wants this man. In every way he can have him and he doesn't even blink at what that means. John smiles again (Sherlock loves stars but if that smile was his sky he would be happy) and says "I'll only take it for your name and number." Oh, he's flirting. Good, sexual attraction will definitely help things along.
She looked at the ground, refusing to meet his eyes as she explained herself, “All of the staff knows that you were in the military. And this probably isn’t a step up, you know, from that kind of life. Not that-“ her head jerked up to him then, her big brown eyes earnest, “war is preferable! Or anything! I just, you know, kind of see you shambling about a lot,” her eyes went back down to a spot on the floor.
So because he can’t think of anything else to say John states rather numbly, “You’re cleaning the sheets then. Since this is technically your mess.”
“John? You’re home rather late,” she came around the corner, wiping her hands on a towel. “Where were you? I had to make dinner without-”
John’s hand clenched involuntarily at the realization, which crushed the stem he’d been examining.
“If that is what would make my husband more comfortable, I would purchase all of the Queen’s horses,” Sherlock tightly said with transparent sincerity.
“Are you alright?”
“Officer, I can assure you that this is a waste of time and resources,” Jim said.
John couldn’t hear himself anymore, and he didn’t have the ability to be self-conscious about the noises if he could. All he could feel was hot and tingling jolts, which slowly transformed to feeling slick and wet.
Growling at the thought, Sherlock began to move himself in small thrusts. He was barely moving in and out of John’s body, when the boy suddenly clenched even tighter around him. Sherlock felt small nails digging frenzied scratches into his shoulders. The boy went slightly lax in the next second, and Sherlock realized that the Omega had come again.
Shoes and coat close to soaking. The light drizzle of the day having its affects from anyone standing outside for too long without shelter or umbrella. Outdoors crime then. And something recurring if Lestrade mentioned another 'time'. So, repeated crimes that happened outdoors, most likely violent muggings then, but why consult him about-
"Mrs. Hudson's been complaining about the rot for months," Sherlock lies. "You've just hastened renovations. Come inside."
"Why not? Could be fun. Forcing you down. Immobilizing you, fucking you when you beg me to stop. It would be like reminiscing." Sherlock doesn't even lean closer for emphasis. He lets the seriousness of his tone and the sudden glaze to his eyes speak for him. John feels all of the air leave his body.
John had been immensely saddened by the news, on both accounts. He hadn’t thought that the vagrants were innocent saints, but they had mentioned being desperate for money. John understood those struggles, and knew there was little a man would do to raise himself from such hardship.
“John, whatever it is, you can say it here,” Sherlock encouraged.
Sherlock sighs in deep annoyance, “Honestly John, you’re almost being classist at this point. It’s completely normal dim sum. It’s just
But that’s not entirely true is it? He knows the way prophecies work. Interpretation allows for a plethora of possibilities, none of which are favorable.
The glob sticks to Sherlock's cheekbone, right underneath his widened eyes. Carefully, Sherlock dabs his finger to the spot, pulling back to stare at it. The men on either side of John tense, not looking forward to being caught in the crossfire. Sherlock looks back at John, watches those sharp eyes burn with untempered hatred. There's not a single trace of fear. "Remarkable," Sherlock murmurs.
‘By his side’ does not mean ‘his exclusively’.
Sherlock made another dismissive noise, and hopped up onto the paper lined bed for a comfortable seat. It occurred to John that he hadn’t asked Sherlock for his parent’s phone number, or even told him to head home for the day.
Sherlock leans down to nibble on John's shoulder. When he's distracted, he slips one finger in, and groans at the tight heat. John clenches at the intrusion. His brain is on the continual loop of "Oh God he's
“Very well then. To put it plainly, Sherlock, you need to tell him.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, "Don't fret," John stops tugging, his face apprehensive, "I wouldn't be able to aptly perceive your expressions if you didn't have eyes."
"I didn't know this had left a scar," he says, continuing to stare at it. It takes a few seconds for John to put together what Sherlock is talking about, and he swallows.
“Oh come off it,” John points his fork at the man in powerful skepticism, “you can’t honestly tell me that this tastes the same as the Chinese takeaway sitting in our fridge.”
"You pick out somebody else, I'll order you something a little nicer." Sherlock leans over, and plants a quick peck on his lips. John blinks in surprise. This is turning out way better than he expected. John grins and nods, falling back into his seat. The alcohol is buzzing pleasantly in his veins, which is why he doesn't immediately shoo away the beautiful woman that slides into the seat opposite of him.
"It's driving me mad with nothing to do here, and it's the same for you too. I'm just asking to be let out for air every once in a while. You can, I don't know, have somebody follow me. Give me a prison guard or something, but I'm scratching at the walls here Sherlock."
John’s fingers curled in the grass. No, he told himself, he hadn’t made a mistake. This was the responsible thing to do, the decent thing to do.
John smiled at him. He felt as though he should reassure his patient husband that the wait would likely be a short one, when his attention was caught by another part of the greenhouse.
Sherlock’s eyebrows did a thing that John took to mean he was conceding the point. “Seriously, it’s all fine.” John nearly leaned forward to clasp Sherlock’s arm in a reassuring manner. But suddenly the distance seemed too large, like it would take too long for John’s hand to get there. Which would mean the intent would be lost and the results would be awkward.
He’d been torn from his morose thoughts when a sound greater than a thunderclap rang out. John had crouched low without realization. He looked for the source of the noise. It resounded again, closer, and overhead.
Mycroft tapped his umbrella twice on the floor. “That remains to be seen, Doctor Watson. As it stands, this is more of a social call than I’m used to making. I wanted to see what kind of person my brother would want as his, how to put this, ‘partner in crime’?”
"Does my word even mean anything to you, John? She could be dead in an alley right now." Sherlock folds his arms in expectation of John's answer.
“Would you rather I was rougher with you John?” he asked the man’s skin, “Would you prefer it if I was more demanding?” Sherlock’s hands came up to rest on either side of John’s chest, slowly moving John’s nipples in tiny circles with his thumbs. He enjoyed the way John’s eyelashes fluttered with the sensation, and how he arched for more.
Well, piss.
"Please," John garbles, voice hoarse from shouting, "please, Sherlock, let me come. Please." It won't be until much later that John realizes this is the first time he has said his name since being imprisoned.
She rubbed her hands together, “Not precisely? It’s a man, he says he’s related to Sherlock and that he would like to talk with you.”
Eventually John joins him at his side, his mug steaming with tea that isn’t done steeping. Sherlock pretends not to notice John’s presence, his eyes never flickering from the rain he’s been so diligently watching.
Before John could curse at him, Sherlock popped John’s length into his mouth. He continued to stroke the flesh that he couldn’t reach with his lips, and sucked at what he could. Sherlock’s tongue continued to lap over the slit, licking up every drop of precome as it appeared.
His claws traced looping patterns on the path left behind by his tongue. He said nothing, just watched the black talons circle around John’s nipples or trail along his throat. John shifted, disconcerted by the mercurial moods, before Sherlock finally spoke.
He limped back to the bed, grabbed his cane, and strode towards the door that was once again knocked upon.
John stared up into large stormy eyes and said with complete honesty, “I would have been free.”
“No, no that isn’t it at all!”
John shouts from the combined shock and helplessness of his situation. Sherlock smirks, whispers a completely insincere, "Oops," and leans down to follow the trails with his tongue. The heat of John's skin quickly warms the water, and his tongue laves away any remaining cool water. He lips and nips his way across John's collarbone, and he arches into the touch.
The ache of that knowledge startled him. When had he started relying on Sherlock to provide him so much happiness?
He moves to the other side of the bed, and curls around John's shivering frame. He remembers that shock might be prevalent in some burn victims, so he wraps his arms underneath and around John's shoulders. The shivering doesn't stop, but he does bury his face into Sherlock's neck. A few more sobs wrack his body, and he grows still. Sherlock knows he is not asleep, but he doesn't attempt to make conversation.
“Sod the police, I will damn well throw you tossers out into the middle of the street, and you can put that picture on your front page for all I--”
John honestly doesn’t know why he did it. And that scares him. That scares him more than the panic attack he’d had on the way into the hospital. It scares him more than any torture Sherlock could come up with.
“Now I want to make something absolutely clear,” his professor had firmly addressed the remaining and slightly swaying students, “we are not forensic doctors. If you decide to go into mortuary work, this sort of body is a rarity. Not as rare as we would like, but it’s not common. Your job is
John's lips pull back from his fangs, but he stays quiet. The man is still too close to her to act.
Everyone had looked a little green of course. But when it became clear that the victim hadn’t been sedated or given anesthetic, the second student couldn’t even make it to the bin.
“Of course,” the teenager assured, grinning unashamedly. John matched it with his own smile.
He felt his climax approach him with dizzying speed, but when he was just about to crest, his mind slipped from him. What was once heated flesh became a burning and indistinguishable mass. The fingers turned to unyielding bands that circled and wove over his cock.
Sherlock shakily stood up, and followed Snow into the office. The two goons were told to wait outside, which clearly infuriated Gary. He kept his mouth shut.
. The sound makes every bone in Sherlock's body shake in fear and awe. The wings fully extend, the width only slightly bigger than the creature's height (but it's crouching, so that should be taken into account), and Sherlock covers his face with his sleeve to avoid the pelting debris.
He stands, moving towards their closet. A collection of his toys are stored neatly away. Sherlock pulls the riding crop off of its hook. He tests the give by bending it slightly, but he already knows the tensile strength down to every leather wrapping.  He swishes it through the air, where the slight whistle makes John flinch.
When they reached the cashier John handed his card over without hesitation. Sherlock watched with open interest. It wasn’t until they were loading the bags in John’s car that he asked, “Why are you helping me?”
John led the way up to the greenhouse. He felt their stares burn into his back the whole way. He refused to think about how he appeared, having flung insults after trying to dive into a fire for evidence that was long destroyed. He refused to examine himself objectively, for he knew what he’d find. He would see nothing but a paranoid husband gone mad with grief.
“Fuck,” Sherlock whispered in strangled adoration, “fuck.”
John’s skin bulged and rippled with their multitudes. They became his muscles, his organs, his blood, until he was a constantly shifting mass of pink and ropey flesh. He couldn’t withstand their presence anymore, so he opened his eyes.
The man shuddered up above him. His hips rested against the curve of John’s arse, and he went abruptly still. The rush of wet heat inside of him gave John the final push into oblivion.
, his mind whispers,
Sherlock passes a hand over John's sweaty back and gently says, "It's okay John. Take all of the time you need."
“That’s what people do John,” Sherlock carefully said, “it’s what’s intended for all of us as mortal creatures. We only hastened the process.”
Sherlock brought back plenty of game and root vegetables from the forest. Once or twice he came back with crates full of more luxurious produce. Things which could only be bought from lavish markets with large amounts of coin, or taken by force. John became quiet every time Sherlock brought back such boxes.
Sherlock shrugs, rolling his eyes. "Hardly my fault the police were incompetent enough to pin you for the murder. Though apparently they did work it out. Just five years too late."
John’s concern overflowed when Sherlock walked into his medical room, and the dark bags under his eyes had become so prominent that he nearly looked like he did when John had first met him.
The slow glide down isn’t just starting at his cock, but it’s also burning down his spine and up through his veins. Sherlock pulls his hand away from John’s dick and pushes down on John’s hip to ensure his stillness. The digits feel as hot as brands against John’s feverish skin.
Sherlock’s trousers are still uncomfortably pinched around his crotch, but he continues to ignore it. He’s enjoying replaying John’s screams and the sight of his quaking body enough for it to occupy his baser urges. Compared to that music, an orgasm would be a paltry conclusion to this spectacular concerto.
The touch along his cock is teasing, never fully stroking him, just ghosting up and down his shaft. It's still more than enough for John, who was unable to touch himself in that box. How could he, when touching more of his own clammy skin made him want to vomit?
Lestrade’s face wrinkled, as though it pained him to grant Sherlock what he wanted. But he nodded his assent.
Sherlock’s response was to lift John’s legs so they rested on his shoulders. He nipped at the inside of John’s thigh, and then traveled straight over to John’s hole. Without warning, he licked and kissed at the sensitive skin. John dug his heels into Sherlock’s back, forgetting that he was wanted to be careful.
John stepped into his space before he could regain his footing. With his shorter stature he landed a swift and hard blow to the man’s stomach. He felt the wind leave the man’s body, and the way his arms went slack told John he’d either dropped the weapon again or he’d been compelled into unconsciousness.
“Well, until this storm passes, we could fill it with some other noises,” John suggests as he swings a leg over Sherlock’s thighs.
The man shrugs and eats some of his food, "Basically come here whenever I can't sleep. Helps me calm down. Had an inkling I was meant to be here tonight. Call it a sixth sense." John raises a dubious eyebrow, but doesn't comment.
"Yeah, I know that your definition of 'people watching' probably isn't the usual. I still remember the night you deduced that I'd been to Afghanistan." God, does he ever. He still remembers how naive he'd been. How he'd felt the thrum of wonder at this complete stranger who knew his whole life's story because he had a limp and a tan. "So, we can both win. I'll technically be acceptably observing strangers from a place that's not our flat window, and you won't be bored."
Did his sister’s wailing spirit hint at a death that was more sickening than the one she met with? Was the reason she haunted these halls because she was following where her brother was treading, hoping to give him some important message?
“Policeman,” he managed to say, “I need…a constable…”
This was right.
“With you here, it is hardly a dreary home.”
He could've killed him. Could've ended it all in about two minutes if he'd continued to keep pressure on Sherlock's trachea. Done it without any guards pulling him off before he finished. But he didn't. He sprang off. He fucking
Suddenly, air.
“I’m only
John is more than a little disturbed that he didn't hear the door open. When had that happened? When he'd been a defenseless little ball on the floor? When he'd been having a mental breakdown? John pushes those thoughts away. It doesn't matter now. He marches to the clothes and inspects the little pile. The clothes are bleached white and uniform. Something you'd find in a mental ward. There's a bar of soap on top, and a bowl of lukewarm oatmeal beside the laundry that he hadn't noticed.
John said nothing, because he didn’t have anything to say.
John squashed down the urge to ask him what he meant by that. Part of it was morbid curiosity of what everyone gossips about when the army doctor isn’t around, another was that he wanted to hear Sherlock display that amazing ability again. The way he could connect such tiny things into one cohesive but complex picture, and then talk about it like it was as simple as dressing yourself, was still boggling John’s mind.
“Sherlock, my God. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I don’t know why I--”
"I think..." God, this is simultaneously the most ridiculous and terrifying thing he's ever done, "I think we need to talk." John looks at Sherlock from the mirror, then turns around to face him fully. He supports himself with his hands on the sink, his knees still feeling like water. The lights had been turned on in the bathroom when Sherlock had followed after John, and the fluorescent glow throws sharp shadows on the man's cheek bones. The comparison to a skull is not helpful to John right now.
“Fantastic, I’ll see you tonight then.” Sherlock was almost out the door as he said it.
Several minutes of silence permeated the room. Sherlock hoped the tension would make John uncomfortable, but instead it only seemed to make him bored. John clearly saw that his glare would get him as far as his words would, so he turned his head to the side. The least he could do was pretend his captor wasn't even in the room with him. As soon as John looked away from him, Sherlock spoke to grab his attention again.
John looked up from smearing gel onto the kid’s knuckles, to meet the palest eyes he’d ever seen. Their unexpected intensity jolted through him, but all he did was calmly grab the bandages.
He's not disguised, his Belstaff coat is undeniably distinguishable, but he can never resist the flair for the dramatic. Not to mention that the CCTV cameras along the street are all on a continual loop for the next twenty minutes. Sherlock's about to buzz John, when he notices the too polished and posh car in the reflection of the glass. Ah, he should have suspected his brother would continue to pursue him. Should have even known that he would have someone watching John's apartment.
“It is actually,” Jim said with chilling surety, “does this news surprise you?”
“But if things were different,” Sherlock pushed, “what would you have said instead?”
“Sherlock,” John said as he reached up to grip Sherlock’s arm. He could feel Sherlock vibrating with coiled tension. “I’m not going anywhere.” John stared into Sherlock’s eyes to get the point across.
"It's certainly hard to tell if you've figured out the solution to your little dilemma, so allow me to guide you,: Sherlock leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, and John stares with barely any comprehension evident in his face, “pleasure is the only way to ease the more unpleasant side effects, John. Actually, any physical touch will do, let's not sugarcoat it. I can literally do anything I like to you in this state, and you will
John growled at Sherlock’s smug look and bucked underneath him. “Why in the hell did you bite me? Get off!”
The words still linger at the back of his mind, but here was the closest thing he had to a home. Sherlock follows him up the stairs and into their bedroom, still not saying a word.
For a confusing moment, John thought he saw Sherlock’s eyes narrow. Then the anger was gone, and John mistook it for the ever shifting shadows of the cloudy winter day.
Gently, he grasps it in his hand, feeling the velvety skin pulse in his grip. Sherlock's breath stutters out of him, but he doesn't move. This needs to be John's time to explore, to get comfortable. What comes next is crucial.
Remember your place.
The dragon breathed in. John smelled a rising acrid scent of sulfur. In blind panic he asked, “How did you know I was a swordsman?”
Sherlock’s strangely pointed question from yesterday was simply him gauging John’s reactions to those suggestions. Teasing about something like that was something John really needed to warn him against, especially since Mycroft had already assumed they were engaged in something illicit.
John thought the sound was coming closer. He was afraid to turn and look. He licked his lips and felt the spit worsen the splitting skin. There was nothing he could do. Sherlock would find him, and he’d be taken back, or he’d go unnoticed and suffer a slow death of exposure. Or he could fall.
“What the hell!” John’s words escaped before he remembered to use appropriate language. He dropped the supplies he’d been sorting to quickly dart to the small freezer where he kept a rarely used ice compress for rugby sprains.
He crept in and shut the door behind him. The thick curtains blocked all moonlight and the fire was dulled to embers. With no illumination John could only make out the shadowy outlines of the books and furniture. It was no matter; he knew his goal. He did not intend to dawdle and be caught.
Sherlock said something a bit more distinct, although John couldn’t make it out. Then Sherlock reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper. Gary’s response was instantaneous.
‘Will do this’
The door to the study was unlocked, and the lack of gas lights and flickering fireplace flames indicated no one was inside. He pushed open the door, and winced at the small creak it produced. He waited, crouched and anxious in the doorway, but there was no confused inquiry or raising of an alarm.
Why else would he be in this situation?
He stores it as an activity for later. He wants to see if John can come from the sensation of being stretched and filled in such an intimate place first. It swells Sherlock’s heart to think that he has now accessed a part of John Watson that absolutely no one else was privy to.
It's the silence that has him looking back at John. And this time he is angry, but he's mostly confused. Shit. He forgot he wasn't supposed to know that. But he already knows John so well, just not intimately, not yet anyway, that he forgot that John doesn't know anything at all. "Afghanistan." John replies slowly "But how did you know...?"
"No matter how improbable," Sherlock murmured. He needed more data.
John didn’t drop his head. His arms trembled, and John’s whine was almost pitiful, but he didn’t look away.
He woke up thrashing. The sheets were wrapped tight around his clammy skin. For a few panicked moments John thought he was still being suffocated by—by the--.
go back. There will be nothing left if he does.
The burn of his body lingered like a smoldering coal behind his navel. At the thickest juncture, he was certain his body couldn’t accommodate any more. The other two men stopped and waited with the patience of hunters before continuing.
Sherlock was doubled over before John even saw the fist land in his stomach. In one smooth motion, he had the phone down on the grating and the gun raised up. To fire on what, he would never be sure.
Sherlock wasn’t just embarrassed, he looked ashamed.
Sherlock licks at John's dick, savoring it. He curls his lips around the head and makes a small suction. John's head hits the back of the couch. As Sherlock continues this torment, John writhes in his restraints. He can feel the blood being cut off from his wrists every time he clenches into fists. This is nothing like the first time.
John couldn’t question her about it now, not when his head felt like it was stuffed inside of a hornet’s nest, simultaneously muffled and ungodly noisy.
He jerked a thumb back at the man who had slowly begun to sit up. From this distance, it was hard to tell expressions, but John could sense a coiled tension that only came from unpredictable people.
He unfolds the sheet, and wraps it around himself. The edges graze the dirty pavement, mostly covering his feet if he stands still. He pulls enough of the fabric over his head to throw his features into obscurity. When he's done, he looks like a crazy person wrapped in someone's sheets.
Molly saw that he was teasing her in a gentle way that wasn’t meant to emphasize her shame, and giggled softly.
“This whole night, you’ve been fighting me. Preparing for the worst that I can offer you. Or you’ve been walking around words as if my temper is a desert landscape laced with touch sensitive explosives.”
John admitted that he had a point there. The reason for a secluded spot was negated if other people knew they were there, and interrupted them well-meaningly.
“Don’t mind me, I surmise that you won’t want to treat someone who can so disconcertingly unravel another person like that, so I’ll just be taking these for a future date and-“
Sherlock didn't wake up until late the next morning, the sound of his phone breaking him from the spell of sleep. Blearily, Sherlock looked at the text message. "I wish to talk to you about your doctor friend. -MH"
They stood there, and shifted their weight. Sherlock took a deep breath, “Well, I should go inside--”, right as John said, “I need to go back--”
As Sherlock spreads the intestines of the first killer across the autopsy table, he doesn’t understand why this is any more horrendous than making a dead loved one parrot back sentimental statements. Yet Anderson is looking a little green, and Donovan is clearly watching him for patterns. Most likely so she can compare the configurations for similarities to future gruesome murders.
He encircles John’s half erect cock, looking into blearily unfocused blue eyes as he asks, “Would you like to come now? Or would you prefer if I untie you, and fuck you into oblivion on the bed?”
to know how well you perform with manipulation."
“Look, I only thought, maybe it’s better if we stayed home instead of--”
At a loss of what to make of that expression, and maybe the look is meant to foretell a vicious attack, Sherlock simply sets the tea on the coffee table. He flings himself across the couch, waiting for the gargoyle to say something biting or make his way out the door. Instead, a clawed hand reaches for its separate mug and says,
That just made John laugh harder.
Sherlock had just finished recounting the time he’d put dissected frogs in Mycroft’s pillowcase, and John was busy getting his breath back from guffawing, when he realized how late it had become.
He still wants his loyalty, his devotion, his love. And they have many years together for Sherlock to craft the right emotional responses for it to become genuine.
They made a game of it. Sherlock would point out an acquisition in the glass garden, and John would try and list off all of its properties before Sherlock could. By the end of it John was lamenting his lack of knowledge while Sherlock promised to compile every book on the subject he possibly could, and add a few more species to the greenhouse that would prove useful.
When he got home, once again without Sherlock in the passenger side, he felt wretched. Sherlock had said he couldn’t help in any way, but John thought that was a load of bullshit. He marched up to Sherlock’s door, resolutely left his cane in the car, and knocked.
“Come on,” John encouraged as he soothed his hands over the marks on Sherlock’s back. “Horizontal surfaces are much more helpful.” He kissed at Sherlock’s neck, and smiled to himself when he felt a shudder run through the young man’s body.
“He certainly seemed like a genius to me.”
The weekend passed in a blur. While John definitely caught up on all of the sleep he missed, he certainly missed out on his intended plans to stay cooped up inside of his house until the inevitable flurry of questions of Monday.
(See the end of the chapter for
And there's...barely anything. In the square well lit room are a few meager possessions of a possible resident. In one well shaded corner is an old-fashioned ice box. When Sherlock opens the lid he is greeted with an array of animal carcasses. Mostly pig, though a lamb flank is thrown in their somewhere.
"Been there before mate. Come on, you look thin as a rail." John follows him out of the tiny room back into the well lit kitchens. Apparently, while he had been on the phone, the stranger had set up a plate for him. Both plates are heaped with noodles and red sauce, and there's a small basket of rolls lying beside it. The stranger pulls out two metal chairs, and both takes their places. John digs in, and the first bite is just as divine as he expected. He plows it all down, and then stops himself. He looks up at the bemused expression on the man's face.
But there's no bed, no nook for personal artifacts. He spots a strangely shaped pile from the darkest corner, and goes to inspect. And it's a heap of...rocks.
"You're kidding." John states.
Sherlock hid his smile by quickly dropping it against John’s shoulder. He shifted a bit, delighted by the little noises John made, until he was kneeling again, still seated inside of John. While a part of him wished to tease John with tiny thrusts until the man cursed him with every vulgar word under the sun, the tight coil of heat in Sherlock’s belly told him that he wouldn’t last much longer.
“Yes, obviously by myself, since you are clearly a figment of my desperate imagination.”
He feverishly thanks whatever luck that hasn’t abandoned him yet that he’s ambidextrous.
Sherlock’s eyes shimmered with a hurt he didn’t understand. John felt a pang of sympathy that he tried to mold into something more constructive. It wouldn’t do for Sherlock to think John really
John blinked, and moved quicker than he thought he was currently capable of. “Why didn’t you get it?” John belatedly asked, as he had already yanked open the drawer.
The vibrator clicks off, and it's such a shock that John gasps out loud. With quick, but careful, ease the toy is slid out of his abused hole. John groans when he feels the last of the dreaded thing slip from his entrance. Then something else is filling him, something familiar. It's Sherlock breaching him, and he still hasn't taken off the cock ring.
Any further conversation is cut short when sirens are suddenly blaring and several policeman rush into the alley. There's a brief rush of angry confusion since John's the one with the gun, but a brief explanation from John and Sherlock has Pickner being led away in an ambulance with a sergeant in the back. Sherlock and John are waiting in the alley, ready to give statements to the police. A chime comes from Sherlock's pocket, it's a text from Jim.
“What’s curious to me is how you discovered the code to my safe at all Johnny,” Jim offhandedly said.
John smiled as the school nurse closed the door behind her, but it left his face as soon as the silence of the room pressed against him.
It takes ground forget-me-nots and a bit of John’s hair, pulverized with an obsidian stone in strict widdershins formation, all thrown into the blazing fireplace, for Sherlock to remember why he hates doing the mundane work of spells.
“We have four hands between us,” Sherlock said, “and a very dogged motivation to see you broken.”
. About their relative involvement in each other’s lives. They belong together. And they always have.
As if he has anything to be tense about. As if Sherlock has a thousand different thoughts buzzing like kicked wasps in his head. As if he’s the one standing on the edge of a precipice, being slowly pushed forward every passing day.
Sherlock snorted, “What? Being an undercover teenaged drug addict? I think you’ll find there’s not much use for it outside the one application.”
“I seriously don’t know how you manage to inspire deference in anyone when you’re so—“
John blinked up at him. Since Sherlock didn’t disappear after his eyes closed, he stared at the boy’s face. The deep line of indigo underneath his lid could almost be mistaken for ink if not for the slightly puffy look about it.
He walked back into the living room, where he fully expected Sherlock to be talking Mary’s ear off about their escapade. Instead, both of them were sitting apart from one another. Mary looked awkward while Sherlock appeared bored.
He wasn’t even sure what he was meant to be looking for. It wasn’t as if he was an expert botanist. He’d have no way of knowing if the plant was even harmful to him. And he couldn’t just destroy the project of his companion out of paranoia.
John smirks a bit, at least his hitchhiker appreciates good movies. John stops himself from realizing that he just made a comparison between a normal human being and the monster that kept him prisoner for several days. He still hasn't answered. "My name's John. John Watson."
Sherlock's eyes danced over Jim's features, searching for an answer. The madman wasn't displaying his casual smile anymore. His beady brown eyes were dead, his face set into grim seriousness.
“Your brother did try and blackmail me. It was something stupid, and had no real weight if he did try and make it into a scandal, but I thought you should know.” The torn picture in his pocket suddenly felt like a stolen government document. “He tried to imply…that you and I were…”
Sherlock's fingers are always gentle and soothing. John still hasn't masturbated, and it's starting to take its toll. Every time Sherlock move to his arse, John can feel his prick stirring. And when he pulls down his pants, Sherlock thankfully doesn't comment. Now it's the third time that Sherlock has come in, and John feels like he's ready to burst. The tall bastard has left already, and John could've sworn that the man had been smirking when he'd left.
“Fuck,” John cursed as he pulled at his own hair to avoid pulling at Sherlock’s. Sherlock licked a wet stripe from the tip of his prick to his balls.
“I told you not to overexert yourself,” Sherlock reprimanded, worry tightening the corners of his eyes. He helped John into bed.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Lestrade said to them, inside of the same room, over two days later. His face seemed to have aged five years from what he had seen. “Either these poor bastards tried to grab the wrong fucking magic user, or someone was a bit pissed about their stances on witch existence.”
He left with a little wave behind him as he walked next door. John smiled and felt something warm drip into his heart.
“I’m Officer Lestrade. My wife is the daughter of Jefferson Hope, and we were visiting for the funeral before I heard Mr. Watson-Holmes required a constable. Now who are you both, and what is happening here?”
Molly yelped in surprise, “Who?”
“I could say the same,” John said, “I hope it wasn’t urgent business that called you out of slumber so early?”
.” John shouted as he reluctantly pulled away and snatched one of the sheets off of their bed.
He doesn't need to give his brother anything else to hold over his head.
John walked through the door without so much as a sentence formed, only to find Mary close to completely clothed.
John actually does get a decent night's sleep on the buckles-free bed. He had forgotten how energetic that makes him, how relaxing it feels. John hates where it came from.
John's eyes widen, and the words are so similar to bad porn dialogue that he can't stop the laugh. His hand flies to his mouth, and he grins behind it as he tries to stop giggling. "Sorry, sorry," John complies with Sherlock's words, bending at his hips until his head is nearly touching Jim's shoulder, but Sherlock is fairly put out from the mockery from what Jim can see. John's body is still vibrating with giggles, and Jim is grinning at Sherlock like he's won a coveted prize.
John stood there in the hallway, feeling increasingly awkward. He heard banging about upstairs, and thought Mary was tossing around something breakable and therapeutic. Then the banging traveled down the stairs, became a rolling sound, and moved into the bedroom.
A handheld gaming device played some tinny music in the abruptly silent warehouse. Snow’s mouth opened and closed. John kept his phone steady while he watched Sherlock systematically and spectacularly endanger both of their lives.
“Answers,” she responded, “proof. Such things that will surely bring a swift conclusion if you proceed accordingly, though I will not be able to witness it.” She swept forward and brought her arms around his chest to pull him close.
John blinks, and mutters a "Huh." He thought he would have to fake his amazement, but it's there. No matter how much he wishes it wasn't. He looks at Sherlock, and apparently his silent praise was heard all the same. The man's staring at him, searching his face for false wonder. When he sees that John is being sincere, he manages a small smile. John swallows, and searches the pub for someone else.
‘Or I’
He nearly smacks himself. Right. Of course. A flying beast that can climb up stone would certainly have no need for stairs.
John rolled over, despite Sherlock’s semi-desperate clinging and drawn out whine of protest. “Stuff it,” John warned, “you may have lost motor function, but I was lying in my own spunk and losing the ability to breathe. You can slowly suffocate me some other time.”
"Ah, you're coherent again. That's a surprise. I thought you would continue to be insensible this far in." So, Sherlock really was talking to himself. If John had brain functions, he would probably say something smarmy to that. Sherlock almost completely pulls out his fingers, and John whines in protest.
And the stillness makes John realize what he just did. And it drenches him like being submerged in icy water.
The man stops in his tracks, his hand on the door. Hope surges through John, that maybe he won't have to deal with this alone for God knows how long. That same hope crashes (as it has done so many, many times) when Sherlock minutely shakes his head. The click of the door latch is very loud, and the darkness seems thicker than before.
“I found out about Hope and the two men who accosted me. I’ve been profoundly affected by their fates.”
“And you’ve been to Afghanistan.”
John stiffened at every lengthy shadow that might conceal some hidden enemy. John wasn’t a stranger to peril. His father had taken up with a few unsavory types who had tried to knock Harry about for the sport of it. They soon found that not all Watson men were without integrity or bravery. His sister had often said that John reveled in a chance to unleash the temper he kept smothered under a gentle disposition and dry wit.
Separation was key. Pick off the supposed weaker one while the notorious magic user choked on precious metal.
John comes down from his crest of painful ecstasy to realize Sherlock has continued talking, "This is not about you. Do you think I drugged you because you needed a night of absent inhibitions? Did you think this was about giving you an unparalleled night of exhilarating pleasure and torment? No. This is about me, John. About reminding you that, in the end, it will always be about me." The breath ghosts over John's nipples, and he whimpers. Savagely, Sherlock bites into the tissue of the areola. He sucks, hard enough to leave a large bruise. Sherlock speaks, aware that John can barely hear him now, "Your pleasure is mine John. It is always mine, and if you ever try to deny me what is mine again, I will up the dosage. Perhaps even add a hallucinogenic." He sounds musing, like he's willing to try it anyway, but moves on to the second nipple before he has time for the thought to cement.
John rubbed the back of his neck to get the prickle out from underneath his skin.
“No, no. Let me finish,” she asked him. He sighed a bit, but nodded for her to continue.
“You were right,” Sherlock admitted. John’s wakefulness almost fully returned at those words, considering their rarity.
“Angelo’s? Really?” John asked as they stepped out of the car.
John runs a shaking hand through his hair with his forehead still pressed against the glass. In this moment, he's not sure if he's proud or disgusted with himself. John keens in his throat past the knot that's lodged there, and squeezes his eyes shut.
It was a great surprise when he refused the idea.
Sherlock’s head rolled down from where it had been resting against the back of his seat. Even with their warm surroundings, Sherlock’s eyes were crystalline lenses that trapped John under their intense scrutiny. John was startled enough by the sight that he nearly lowered his utensil.
John tries to pull down, to shift the abrasive material against his skin, but he stays damnably put. He leans up into Sherlock's brief caress on top of his head, and whimpers when it's suddenly pulled away. The footsteps leave his side, and John speaks without meaning to, "Sherlock. Sherlock, please. Don't leave. I'm sorry."
For Sherlock, his favorite thing about the box is control over John's time. Perhaps it should be watching John slowly break apart in his prison. Or being able to feed, water, and take care of John however much or little he wishes. But Sherlock has never had the power over someone's measure of minutes. So far, his John has been locked up for a total of thirty hours, just under Sebastian's warned maximum. But Sherlock can't help but edge just a little. He doesn't quite want to let go of this power over John just yet.
John looked over at him, “What do you mean?”
Still, there was no response.
He shifted underneath Sherlock who eventually moved off of him with much grumbling. Ever thankful for their private washroom, John collected a warm and damp towel to bring back to their bed. Judging by the way his legs were already stiff and the deep ache of his bottom, tomorrow would be an endurance. He couldn’t find it within himself to care.
the base of his dick.
John remembered that he lived with someone else. He sent a text to Mary, letting her know that Sherlock had wanted to go out that night, so he probably wouldn’t be home until later. He failed to mention that it was going to be a dinner. He didn’t know why he left that detail out. Friends had dinner together all the time.
The door to the greenhouse was unlocked as always, and the constant warmth was a blessed relief on his extremities. His face felt damp from sweat and steam, and he hoped it wouldn’t freeze when he was forced to step outside again.
“Mary, go ahead and call for delivery. Anything you’re allergic to?” He asked Sherlock. No sense in killing his guest, even if he was about to get a stern lecture.
Sherlock stood up. John finally looked up at him. If the teenager was going to strike him, John might as well make himself an easy target.
Sherlock's response was a menacing glare. It certainly helped him understand why John had been a captain. A mere glance at that look would have an entire platoon falling in line. Sherlock's smile was slightly more genuine this time. To think he'd be cowed by a facial expression was amusing. He went across the room and dragged the only chair to the left side of John's bed. He sat down, crossing his legs at the ankles. John's expression hadn't changed the entire time. The look created interesting folds in his forehead that Sherlock longed to touch. Sherlock would work on the distance issue later, for now he just wanted to observe.
John shudders with the violent memory. Anger, despair, desperation, a good man dead because he wanted to help. A crimson trail as a heavy body was dumped in an alley for the crows. John swallows down the vomit.
John shifts in his bindings, his control slipping a little bit to get away from the sensation. The drugs are still present in his body, making his thoughts sluggish, mistaking his forced arousal for actual pleasure. John shakes his head, and concentrates on a spot on the wall in front of him. He tries to distance himself from his body, thinking of something, anything, else. Once again, his mind is forced back into his body when Sherlock digs two of his nails into the round cheek of his arse. John's almost proud of how quickly he stamped down any vocal disagreements.
John laughs again. Sherlock wonders if it’s possible to bottle that sound like lightning. To keep it away from every undeserving person beyond these walls for the rest of their days.
The sharp sound of ceramic shattering startled John. He looked over to find Jim staring at his broken cup. “Jim, are you alright?” John began to rise to aid the man before he was stopped.
He had a brief moment to wonder why Sherlock was wearing shoes indoors in his own house. John lost the thought when he laughed at the sight of a fumbling boy too impatient with his own emotions to bother with the finesse of removing his footwear. When Sherlock was done, he looked up, and John’s snickers cut off.
That his sister would manifest as such a horrific entity unsettled him as well. For more than the obvious reasons. While she certainly hadn’t passed peacefully from old age, falling into a drunken stupor and unknowingly drowning in her own sick wasn’t the most violent of ends.
"Ah, ah," Sherlock admonishes, and his hand goes to his zip, "Not to worry, John, this will be far more satisfying." He pulls down his fly, and unbuttons his trousers with a small twist of his fingers. He doesn't push down the fabric, just guides John closer to his crotch.
“Something I cultivated,” Jim answered, “Sherlock and I often like to partake in little pet projects, as you know. I’m trying my hand at breeding new strains of tea plants.”
“Ms. Hooper drove me home,” Sherlock explained. “She knew you normally do that, but since you were out ‘sick’,” he looked John over pointedly, “she did me the favor.”
“I didn’t have much of a fortune when I was alive John, why in God’s name would I want it spent when they’re putting me in the ground?” she would probably say. As John watched them throw dirt over her pine box, he had to hold back the laughter at her imagined voice as she complained, “Just wrap me in burlap and toss me in the hole. What the hell is the box supposed to be for anyway? Am I meant to be a present for God?”
“Help him up and bring him over here, I want to talk to him,” the leader slouched back into his seat. Clearly, insulting idiots was exhausting. He and Sherlock had a lot in common, John wryly thought.
Sherlock blinks at him, “Studies have shown that an air of mystery heightens the experience and positively draws out the surprise.”
“Seriously, Sherlock, what the actual hell? A minute ago you had all the signs of severe drug abuse, and now you’re…you’re…”
"Hardly a difficult deduction. The keypad to the door lock has been used during my absence. Only two other people in this whole facility know the code. You want to 'talk' and not try to immediately please me. Meeting Jim would have made you try to appeal to my 'good side'." Sherlock smirks, "While meeting Sebastian would prompt you to negotiate our current dynamics." Sherlock shrugs at the end of his speech, hardly impressed.
Their slightly off center table is the only furniture, the rest is all open space. In order to cover up what he presumes is concrete; dark bronze drapes have been artfully folded and hung along the wall. The fabric reflects the candlelight in shimmering flickers of gold. A hand on his shoulder nearly makes John jump out of his skin.
After John had stretched himself on four fingers, Sherlock gently pulled his hand away. He easily pulled John’s legs up, wrapping them around his scaled hips. With one hand braced beside John’s head, he used the other to guide himself in.
John was on the floor, arms wrapped around his head and neck to prevent any cranial injury. He was curled up in the fetal position, but his legs were doing a poor job of protecting his ribcage. Kicks and stomps pummeled his body like heavy hail. Sherlock couldn’t hear if John was yelling or grunting in pain.
“Doctor Watson,” Sherlock said with exaggerated contriteness, “would you please accompany me to the store to acquire groceries? As I seem to have spent my allotted allowance on chemistry equipment.”
“Could you come like this John?” Sherlock panted, “Could you come with just me thrusting inside of you,” he jerked his hips harshly with every other word, “Could you come with nothing but my cock, with the camera capturing every twitch of your face?”
His impending demise feels...rather nice actually. A pleasant weightlessness, like the hits before they turned just as sour and monotonous as everything else.
Sherlock hated being present for his brother’s performances. Oh, the common folk might have thought they were the ones who held their king’s attention, but they were all fools. Mycroft did this to establish his place at the throne. To show how well he could hold power over this land and the commoners would relay their lord’s wisdom at the dinner table, unable to discuss anything but the flitting distractions to their dull lives.
He didn’t wait for the carriage to halt before he jumped out. Lestrade called out to him as he started to make his way inside, and he slowed down to wait for the man to catch up. Sherlock and Jim approached him first, though they kept their distance.
“No, of course not,” Sherlock dismissed, waving a hand through the air, “your refractory period isn’t even close to being finished. Once you’ve recovered, we can try out a few new angles that would possibly work better in the limited lighting.”
Mycroft's done this on purpose, he knows it. It is only confirmed when the driver makes Sherlock promise to give his brother a call as soon as possible before unlocking the doors. And because the ride was ungodly and the wait for the most glorious thing he's ever discovered was agonizing, he departs with, "Your ex-wife was clearly the more intelligent out of the two of you. Her assumptions were correct and she was right to leave before she caught you tangled in the sheets with another middle-aged man embarking on a sexual awakening."
Jim sighed, like he was dealing with an extremely dull child. "Yes, but at least tell me you, I don't know, cuddle or pet him or something afterwards."
“Actually,” Sherlock said, “I was hoping you would join Jim and I for an evening drink. Since the matter is settled, as you put it, I believe it’s cause for celebration to the end of our dispute.”
John was having a very hard time keeping a neutral expression. The whole situation was so peculiar that it bordered on hilarity. Of course John knew what they were talking about. Why they were bothering to speak in metaphors was beyond him. A few of Jim’s ‘points’ escaped him in meaning, but he understood what they were aiming at all the same.
He snarls, adding to the wheezes of pain coming from their leader. For a moment, no one moves, then it's mass confusion.
“Fine, yes, blast it all, I am yours. I have been and always will be yours now will you please just bloody-” his words turned to a gasp of surprise. Sherlock wasted no time in finally fulfilling John’s pleading.
“I don’t--” Sherlock admitted haltingly, “I never saw the need to have--”
It seemed as though every word was causing Sherlock pain. John would have gladly dealt more, just to feel some semblance of justice for the agony of betrayal and uncertainty he’d suffered, but Moriarty joined them at that moment.
It's a bit like watching a self-conscious elephant in a china shop. Sherlock quickly suppresses the resulting smirk when the creature darts a look back up at him.
“Although, Sherlock did have the rather inspired idea to place you in a coffin, and make you think you were being buried alive. I think he was still a little miffed at having a brick thrown at him.”
John’s distantly appreciative that Sherlock even bothered to warn him of what he’d planned for today. He’d even been given the option of having his hands tied or unbound.
Immediately, John’s muscles lost all of their tension as if a string had been cut. A high whine left John’s throat that he didn’t even try to stop.
“Jesus!” John couldn’t stop the shout.
John felt a little insulted. He considered himself at least threatening enough for a gun. His bemused expression didn't amuse the guard, who ordered him to face the wall. John turned slowly. A taser might not be as serious a weapon as he was due, but getting electrified was not on his to-do list. As John focused on the hated walls, he concentrated on hearing what was happening. It sounded like several other people were in his cell, carrying something large by the grunts of effort.
to stay, and that was largely the problem. They had run out of reasons.
Even the words next to him eventually became distant and muffled. He drifted in and out of awareness. He was stripped of his soaked garment and given a dry wool one. Layer after layer of blankets were piled on top of him as someone rubbed a warmed cloth over his red limbs. The fire crackled beside him. A few voices murmured to him in concern or spoke to each other in direction. It was all indistinct past the feeling of his blood slowly circulating once again.
“Look who’s eager,” Jim’s voice crooned behind him. So it was Sherlock who was moving John’s legs wider by spreading them with his own. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think he was beginning to enjoy this,” Jim continued as he pulled John’s hips further down.
John blinked in shock, before a helpless chuckle escaped him, “I don’t think I’ve ever heard a kid call a couple of bullies ‘inconvenient’ before.”
Both would glide away, heartbroken, but at least they could blame each other for while they felt so low for a little while. Instead of returning to self-deprecation. Now, all John has is his own thoughts. After Harry had nearly revealed and gotten themselves killed when she'd stolen a tankard of ale, John had put his foot down. She could either keep stealing and losing herself in spirits, or fucking own up as an adult gargoyle for once.
Sherlock acknowledged that with a hum and a small smirk. Then his face turned serious. “Once we’re inside, there should be plenty of hiding spaces for you. I’ll need you to film the transaction from a sequestered location that can still capture audio and have a clear visual. There will be more than one person in here, so you’ll need to be cautious of your surroundings.”
Her finger bones came up to his eyes and began to press hard.
John was going to throttle Mycroft the next time he saw him, arrangement or no.
“No need,” Jim trilled, “I know how busy you are Sherlock. What with the whole shipment thing in the Andes you’re so keen about.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock asks in a voice barely above a whisper, "And what if you're right? What exactly can you accomplish with this information?" It's a dare. The most dangerous challenge John has ever faced. He answers without hesitation.
"You would never do it though," John had dared, heart beating in his throat.
"Sherlock!" Lestrade barked, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, but didn't say anything else. The Inspector sighed, pinching his brow and waving in the direction of the alley.
"Next round then, shall we?" Sherlock says, and John thinks that maybe he's in hell.
All of it blends together. None of it is distinguishable.
Sherlock tries to hold back his smile, and fails a little bit. Instead of answering John’s original inquiry, Sherlock takes the time to admire the smoothness of the fabric under his hand, and the way he can feel John’s muscles shift with each step.
They’d briefly brought up the prospect of swinging, but that had been quickly shot down by both of them. John couldn’t picture himself with another woman any more than he could stomach the thought of Mary with a strange man, and she had felt the same.
John settled whatever anxieties plagued his mind, and he relaxed again in Sherlock’s hold.
Angelo is not as quick. He get hit in the shoulder from some shrapnel. The speed makes the large splinter stick into his shoulder, and the man yells.
Sherlock stops, and looks him in the eye. His lips turn cruelly mocking. "I think we're well past that particular argument, aren't we John?"
Slowly, the arm he was holding felt less like a power line. John kept it there for a few seconds longer to be sure, and then a bit more to act as a source of comfort. When he let his hand drop to his side, it felt distinctly colder.
The Voice was starting to sound a lot like Sherlock.
God alive, but John was beginning to feel like the biggest fool in history. However, cryptic messages that contained only the barest wisps of suspicion couldn’t help his situation. Besides, no direct names had been given, so even if he could decipher whatever this alleged to, he’d never be able to prove it.
"Please,
“You mean you want to tell your wife? That’s surprising, I didn’t think you would bring that up until well after your divorce.”
John's been conscious for two hours now. His eyes flicker over nothing, and he jerks at the slightest hint of noise. Though it's all in his head. The box is soundproofed enough that a bomb squad could crash through his door and John would be none the wiser. Sherlock's copying the results of his 'Blood Patterns Under Duress' experiment between watching John on his computer. Unannounced as usual, Jim comes striding in with his tamed tiger close behind.
“Tell me John,” he said after a small and humiliating silence had filled the halls, “do you know how to read?”
It’s maddening that John can feel the leather across his prick while he’s unable to see it. With his head forced back he’s as good as blindfolded. He can’t focus in horrid fascination, nor can he anticipate what’s coming. He can only stare at the patterns on the ceiling while his body shakes with strain.
On any other day, John would have swelled up and flushed with pride from the praise. Instead, it just hurts that much worse. Holmes had such high expectations from him, and he let him down. All because he couldn't control his stupid hormones.
“Your needs for an education can be met here. We have the finest library, and I can hire you an esteemed professor as a private tutor. There’s no need for you to attend a college.”
“Fuck, fuck,
“So, why aren’t they here with you then? Your knuckles are broken enough that they’re probably as bad off as you are, if not worse,” John feigned calm admirably. He wasn’t sure what he would do with the kid’s response. John didn’t like bullies, but he can’t pretend he doesn’t know that there are other wounded kids somewhere out there.
John frowns in confusion, “What? No I’m not. You may have the appetite of a cactus, but I know I’ve seen you eat from-“
John idly drums his fingers, wondering if he’s supposed to be doing something else. Most of the time, when these ‘games’ occur, John knows what’s about to happen. Either it’s because he’s bargained himself in accordance with their mad relationship rules, or because Sherlock likes to see the trepidation in John’s eyes before they begin.
lead. Well then, far be it from me, your wife, to drag you away from stardom.”
John can barely breathe. He feels like his head is submerged underwater while the rest of him is held aloft with needles of torment. He knows that he’s babbling something, but he’s not certain how to stop.
But it also made him delightfully oversensitive, judging by the way John moaned as he rocked back onto Sherlock’s fingers. John’s belly fluttered pleasantly when the prince’s fingertips brushed a certain spot, and John groaned when Sherlock pressed against it a little more deliberately.
He knows he's failed somehow when Sherlock laughs at him and pulls him to his feet. Sherlock is leading John, almost entirely supporting his weight, though he doesn't seem to mind. Distantly, John thinks Sherlock must be wearing really really expensive cologne to smell this good. That thought dies a violent and fiery death. To make up for it, John attempts to move out of Sherlock's hold again, but is easily stopped.
Sherlock’s fur rugs and feather bed were infinitely preferable. And there would be far more space for them to…work with. He was sure John would agree.
“I told you, this place is dreadfully dull. When you weren’t back after several hours to bemoan about the boredom I became worried.” Sherlock’s eyes took in his husband’s appearance with what little bit the moonlight allowed him to see, and even in the pitch night John could make out his darkening expression.
“Don’t drop your head,” Sherlock said in warning, “even if you don’t want to see what you look like while you’re being mercilessly fucked, I certainly do.”
He blinks, for all the good it does, and comes back from his small crest. He can hear Sherlock rummaging through something, and dread starts to creep into his heart. That was way too easy. And John starts figuring out why he was allowed that moment of bliss when he hears a switch being turned on. The buzz of the vibrator is never changing and far too loud in the room.
It wasn’t a complete lie. John felt the camera’s sight was as tangible as a touch, but he could ignore it if Sherlock was the one distracting him.
John bucks up, gripping Sherlock's head closer to him. They pant into each other, barely parting to breathe. Sherlock smears their combined precome over themselves, and begins thrusting. It edges on painful, they barely have enough lubricant to be comfortable. Sherlock impatiently lifts up his hand and spits into it, then he's back to moving it over their joined erections.
When Jim's done cleaning, turning away to toss away the ruined clothing, quite a bit of nervousness creeps back into John. Was this a one time thing? Just a hasty (well, okay, drawn out as all sweet hell but still) fuck in an office? Because God, how awkward is class going to be? Did they do this just because they could? Because they knew the likelihood of John refusing a romp with his long pined over teacher?
He pulls away from John’s mouth, and presses as close to him as possible as his orgasm crests over him. He moans into John’s neck, shaking from the power of it.
Though how he would stop a being that can tear through human organs like tissue paper is something he's still working on.
Jim rolled his hips, and John felt his mind slip away. He clenched at the sheets, a paltry mimicry of his desperate need to stay cognizant in this dream, appalling though it was. Yet each pulse of pleasure had an increasingly soporific effect.
“Don’t worry, it’s not like he has full control of the British government.” Sherlock paused, “Yet.”
. The cab ride drains him of the last of his funds (he's going to have to advertise again, something he dreads almost as much as boredom).
Just as Sherlock feels the pulse of John’s dick flutter in a familiar way, he bites down on the ragged remains of scar tissue.
Sherlock didn't exactly smile, but the pain of betrayal was gone from his eyes. "Thank you Jim," Sherlock said, meaning every word.
She slid her way back up to his elbow. With delicate precision, she pinched at a bit of skin that John could see like the rings on a stump, and slowly pulled down. All the way down she went, taking the top layer of his skin. She reached his wrist and let it dangle there like a sheet hung to dry. She came back up and began the process all over again.
His hands tilt John's head up to watch the desperate expressions of arousal. John doesn't notice, if he could see the depths of possessiveness in that gaze, he would probably come in his trousers right then.
Thank you all so much for your continued support and patience. Once again a story from this AU is finished, but it's not yet completed. I hope you continue to enjoy my works no matter the fandom or story line. You all stay wonderful!
John's just gotten done with his wash-up after workouts when Sherlock visits again. There's no greeting or leering, Sherlock just inserts another disk like always. John stands, unsure of how to respond.
John stopped from shrugging his coat back on to give Jim an inquisitive look.
“The first student lunch isn’t for another ten minutes.”
His mind does something it has rarely ever done before. It stops.
When he sets it back down on the table, John can feel the water sloshing around in his stomach. His belly is slightly distended from their dinner and the fluid, but he’s far from uncomfortable. John waits for Sherlock to refill the glass again, for whatever mad purpose he’s come up with it. But Sherlock doesn’t move from leaning against the table.
John knew what his answer was. He hated it. He hated himself more than words could say. He felt like his insides had become rotted cabbage. Rubbery, twisted, and acidic. He still said, “No.”
The words are out of his mouth before John has time to process them, "What's your name?"
As they came back to themselves, John noted the tackiness to his skin from the dried sweat and come with some distaste. Before he could even think about how he was going to discreetly request some washing water of the maid, Sherlock said, “On the bedside table. There’s a small bowl and a rag. You didn’t notice because you became...distracted.”
John watched him leave and numbly said, “Sure, yeah.” He was certain Sherlock hadn’t heard him.
He’s brought out of his reverie when Sherlock gently places a hand against his cheek. His head is slowly tilted back up, and Sherlock places a chaste kiss upon his forehead.
“That’s because there’s nothing to defend. I’m fucking married,” John spat, and held up his left hand for emphasis.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “You know that isn’t what I mean. I don’t need a complex array of flavor in order to feel satisfied with a meal. And why waste time cooking, which takes hours of preparation, when that same dish that can be ordered and made for you?”
But that didn't make much sense either. If this was a terrorist cell, they had way too many resources to be wasted on one broken army doctor. John hadn't even been assigned particularly confidential cases, and any information about his division would be either old news or changed by now. So John had no idea where he was or even why he was here. And his nose itched. Wonderful. John cursed his luck while valiantly avoiding the dark thoughts of what could possibly come next if he didn't have a discernible use. As if on cue, his door slid open to reveal Sherlock in all of his long trench-coat and dark curls glory.
The man releases a breathy, "Ha, I was right. Bipedal, with sharpened claws on the feet and hands. The tail is a...surprise but, ah, that accounts for the ability to disable several opponents at once."
"Moon above I'm so sorry," John apologizes. "I knew this would happen. I should've stayed outside."
a large door. There’s a sort of hollow emptiness that echoes around them when the door shuts. For a second, he thinks he’s in some sort of warehouse, but everything just…
“I’ll pay you back,” Sherlock promised as he swayed towards the sidewalk.
“That was when I thought you were taking advantage of an adolescent with self-purpose and esteem issues. Now I know better. And I know that you weren’t entirely dismissive of the idea, as much as you wanted to be.”
. He was only trying to ascertain the cause of his nightmares and dizzy spells. And why his husband’s touch and Jim’s smile would be in one instance comforting but in a sudden moment turn repulsive.
When John wakes up again, he's a little more in control of himself. It's still dark in the room, but it's far from the oppressive black of his cage. He wonders if there are any windows in here, there's no escaping cracks of sunlight. Or maybe it's just night outside.
He looked at John expectantly. He apparently assumed John would pick up the story without any acknowledgement of what had just occurred.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide. He sat back on his haunches, like he wasn’t able to find equilibrium under that declaration. John thought for a precious second that he had punctured a hole in that inflated arrogance.
John watches the bloodied corpse slump for a stunned second, then he's spitting words at Sherlock. He's straining against the two men keeping him from clawing the bastard's eyes out. "You fucking son of a bitch!"
At first, John didn’t understand what he was reading. It seemed to be primarily correspondence between Jim, Sherlock, and countless strangers John had never heard of. Most used pseudonyms, unless it was for droll information like banking statements.
“I am packing,” Mary pointed out as she threw in a few shirts, “for a lovely weekend away with my coworker and friend Janine. Both of our dates cancelled at the last second, so I’m sure she won’t mind a chance to get away from delusional people that would rather loiter about in some microscopic town that’s a few pens away from becoming a sheep village.”
The silver eyes wordlessly take him apart for a little longer, before Sherlock abruptly orders, "I don't blame you for not remembering a date you hadn't even considered. But a repeat transgression won't be so easily ignored, am I clear?"
John’s eyes widened and his body shook from his shaky inhalation. He went rigid, as if escape were something he was now truly considering. Sherlock wondered if John had thought he could deal with this better if it was over quickly.
“No,” Sherlock said with a touch of confusion, “why would I?”
John huffed, his annoyance creeping along his shoulders, “The press tends to make a living off of turning on the people they build up to stardom. Even for a local paper, a hero story may get papers off of the shelves, but a scandal of the same person sells way more.”
It was hard for John to follow the words. His mind felt as thick as a winter stew. He certainly remembered the wretched fight in the hall with Moriarty. He remembered…being determined. Assured in a pursuit of truth. After that his thoughts became twisted in cobwebs.
When they're close enough, the appendage sweeps out, and brings most of them crashing onto their backs. John lashes out at the ones that got close enough to avoid the sweep. He keeps his claws tucked in, to avoid any serious damage. The punches he lands instantly crack bone, and they reel away, screaming in agony.
Sherlock looked at John like he’d just recited the most confounding riddle, “Why would you want to leave?”
Sherlock can subtly feel John’s swollen bladder press against him, and the sensation is dizzying. John feels tighter and warmer somehow, and Sherlock places it on the degradation evident in John’s flushed face and twisting body.
Sherlock's smile could be mistaken for gentle if no one was privy to the thoughts running through his head. Glancing at the time, he scowled, hating his brother for cutting into his time watching John. Oh, but ribbing Mycroft for the absolute failure that was his rescue attempt would be entertaining.
So he garbles out a few words that sound like an affirmative, hoping that Sherlock doesn’t pretend to misunderstand.
He grips underneath John’s shoulders, hauling him upward. John manages at the last second to get his feet to work underneath him to support himself. Walking seems a bit out of the question.
“Oh,” John said. He stared at the pavement.
John sighed and headed back to his own home. While he felt like that had been the best way to end the night after their little escapade, he still felt bereft. It was like the universe had handed him a golden opportunity for something, and he’d let it slip through his fingers.
A panicked part of him begged to spring forward. To confess to the whole thing and be done with it. He would admit his wild follies, Jim would be appalled at his actions but laugh them away amicably, and they’d tell the story to Sherlock over breakfast as everything set itself to rights again.
What ends up coming out is a rather undignified gurgling noise. He can hear Sherlock chuckle above him, and he thrashes again. Sherlock pushes down on his chest, and that brings about a yell of pain when it pulls on his abused shoulder.
John nearly dropped his spoon from being startled. He looked at the man and nonchalantly questioned, “Oh?”
For a long minute, John breathes in the heady scent of Jim's arousal, while Sherlock moves two fingers in and out of his body. Sherlock's impatience bleeds into the pace of the strokes. They're more hurried, slightly stuttering, but still able to manipulate John's body like a fine instrument.
“I’ve been ghastly. I’m not used to Jim taking an interest in anyone, and it surprised me. Especially considering that his attentions are on you.” John’s irritation returned full force, and he was about to kick Sherlock out of their bed before he continued, “I should have predicted it though. Lord knows you are the most luminous creature I’ve ever met. You draw in souls like moths to candlelight.”
“After that is where the drugs came in. The rest you already know, or I assume that Mycroft told you.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything at first. When he was done entering the number, he slipped the phone into his pocket and said, “I heard you. I didn’t know if I could answer the door. I wasn’t sure if someone had been following me, so I had to pretend to be spiraling at my home as well.”
He lets go of Sherlock, who has forgotten that he has legs, and he crumbles onto the ground. John glides a little further ahead before landing. He turns back around, an angry expression still on his face.
He was Sherlock’s treasure, to be molded and shaped as he saw fit. The fact that he had listened to John’s suggestions indicated a miracle. All of this swirled in his head like a maelstrom that John shuttered himself against. He couldn’t let himself fall to panic and speculation now, lest it consume him entirely.
Sherlock’s face softened, “John,” his hands hesitantly reached out to John’s, but pulled back at the last second when John flinched. “Something doesn’t always have to be morally pure for it to be something you want,” he continued.
To clear his head, John went to the greenhouse. The sound of the snow on the glass and the smell of green life usually gave him much respite. Now, the sight of vivid flowers in the middle of such barren cold only seemed to serve as a metaphor for his pleasant circumstances, while the rest of the world suffered.
Sherlock hits play and leans back to watch. Though John very much doubts Sherlock is going to pay a lick of attention to the screen. Somehow, Sherlock doesn't strike him as an Bond fan. Or an anything fan.
"Hang on a minute!" John protested as Sherlock was descending. He stopped, and looked up from his lowered position on the ladder.
He ran a hand over his head, as if he could brush away all of his confusing thoughts to find the words that he needed to make this right. Three small words immediately sprang to mind, but John shoved those out of the way. Now was not the time for declarations, it was for apologies.
When Sherlock comes back, John is asleep on the bed. He jerks awake, instincts firing away when he feels someone leaning over him. Before he even knows what he's doing, he's got Sherlock pinned underneath him on the bed. One hand hovers over the man's throat, while the other has Sherlock's hands over his head on the mattress. When his mind finally catches up to his body, he leaps off like the man is on fire.
Molly considered this. “I don’t know; I feel like it’s more than that. He certainly had a lot to say for just meeting me once.”
Sherlock's probably only being a good sport about it now because he got his way easily enough in the end. But if he's sure not to overdo it, he might not have to give up pieces of himself anymore. No more agreeing to hazardous experiments. No more turning a blind eye whenever John discovers a blood-soaked shirt in the hamper. No more days spent in isolation because John moved a bloody petri dish. John reigns himself in. It's dangerous to get ahead of himself. He's still not a hundred percent sure that this will work. But John, despite his best efforts, still feels something suspiciously like hope in his cracked soul.
Sherlock is regrettably reminded how much a third party is needed when he has to lug John's prone body out of the car. The man helps by bringing around a wheelchair that Sherlock had left in the garage for this purpose. When they have John positioned, the man attempts to follow Sherlock to be of further help, but Sherlock waves him away impatiently. Let him go bother someone else for something to do. He has much more important things to attend to.
After he’s set the restraints off to the side, he slides an arm under John’s shoulders, prompting him to sit up. With some help, they both stand, although John feels considerably less stable. John lies down on the bed without direction from Sherlock, letting his hands lay gently at his sides to reestablish proper circulation.
The entire time, Sherlock maintained eye contact. It was as if their gazes were linked together with tiny but unbreakable chains.
He was rambling. John knew he was just talking nonsense, but he couldn’t seem to stop. That strained silence that had been present after Sherlock revealed he was gay seemed to be hovering at the edges, waiting to swoop in if John were to stop speaking.
His arm involuntarily twitches, and John winces at the taut skin being pulled ever tighter. He tries to move it to lay at his side, but his whole shoulder flares up in harsh reprimand. John wonders in a daze of sweat soaked skin and delirious pain summa pleasure, if he will ever have use of this arm again.
