Tony couldn’t have rolled his eyes any harder had he actually tried, and he knew Rogers caught it just before he turned and jogged up the stairs.
Not Rogers missing him, like he claimed in Bordeaux. Not Rogers wanting to speak to him. Reconciliation was an afterthought, just something of convenience for Rogers since he assumed that Tony would bend to his will regardless. Tony’s chest tightens with anger? Heartache? God, he doesn’t know.
“Uh, yeahhhhh,” Sam continued, drawing the last word out while rubbing his hands together, as if forming a plan. The will reading was tomorrow afternoon, meaning they had a day to properly question everyone. All ten of them.
Eyeing the way Stark was thumbing over the keys to the R8 doorway, Steve began walking toward him, trying to contain the amusement on his face.
It took three whole days for Rogers to show up at his door. Afterhours of course because Rogers was such a
A strong arm placed itself on Stark’s freckled back, lifting the both of them up and turning Tony to face away from Steve. As he pulled back to change positions, between dark lashes and the blonde locks of hair falling into his face, Steve could see Tony: hair spiked and messy from fingers being run through it, bruises slowly starting to form along his neckline, lips bitten and swollen, chest heaving as he panted for air, and eyes so dark they were basically black.
He’s clearly joking. That’s all this was. Steve liked to poke Tony just as much as Tony like to poke Steve. That could be the only explanation. He hadn’t ever really showed anything but contempt for him so… why in hell would he change his mind now? Tony laughs, like the idiot he is. Because he
Steve’s rolling up his own left sleeve, and right where pale, unblemished, Irish skin used to be, were neat, swooping letters in the name
Rogers, for his credit, looks unamused and simply shrugs in answer. “You want an answer right? Come get it yourself.”
The brunette soldier frowned. Why was he asking that? Had something happened? Shuri had cleared him just to be sure. Bucky scrounged through his memory for anything that particularly stood out. Zemo had forced Winter out. Then meeting Stark happened and then… the airport and finally, he and Steve had gone to Siberia to catch Zemo. And Iron Man had shown up, in rather decent spirits.
Of course, aiding Interpol’s most wanted was a serious crime and Tony was no snitch. He’d keep his theories and thoughts all to himself.
Before Tony knows what’s happening, Barnes is holstering his weapon and looking a bit grim. The moment that the Winter Soldier goes for the sleeve of his flesh arm, Tony’s body immediately seizes up.
His memory is sharp and clear. He wasn’t getting those splitting migraines anymore and best of all? Those verbal trigger words were yesterday’s news.
“Try to not lose your voice, huh? I’ve got to question you in a few hours,” Steve deadpanned. Tony nearly chokes on his spit at the insinuation, wide, whiskey colored eyes briefly cutting to the blonde.
The genius’ gorgeous eyes examine him for a few silent seconds. It’s honestly a little unsettling having the man’s focused attention. And then Tony goes and surprises Bucky by asking why he wanted the memories back, especially considering they were not pleasant ones.
The sun is low on the horizon by the time he reaches the weathering, yet elegant, façade of Le Palais, allowing him to use the cover of darkness as he surveys the area. Everything seemed calm so far. Only thing was, there definitely wasn’t much in the ways of areas for him to watch the door. Across the street was what seemed like a vacant building, around that, other places of residence. He would most likely have to go inside to have a decent place to—
Tony knows a dismissal when he sees one and god, he’s just happy to get the fuck out of there. Stark stands and slowly buttons his suit jacket, eyes hard where they meet the General’s. Tony hates him, genuinely so. Ross has always had it out for him since the day Tony told the world he was the one beneath the red and gold faceplate. The billionaire stops at the door, his mouth shooting off before he could think better of it.
Tony huffed petulantly as he (carefully) stuffed another bunch of Rue into the arrangement in front of him. A noise complaint.
Tony Stark believed that he was just one of those unlucky few who would never have a soulmate. And well, that was fine and all, he’d come to terms with it on his 30
Tony went to bat Steve’s hands away: it was his time to shine right now and he growled out a short “as if,” before continuing to try to undress and tease the other as he went. “Technically, since I unbuttoned your pants first, you were naked first.” Tony snarked at him, a punched out sigh of pleasure coming from him as his jeans finally popped open and his dick got a little relief.
Stark’s eyes never left the blonde’s ridiculous baby blues as Detective Wilson made introductions again, aware that the dark skinned man was glaring daggers at him. Yay. This was definitely going to be fun. All Tony had to do was show up and stir the pot just a tiny bit. He hadn’t even truly gotten started.
As they break away and Steve opens his door to let Tony leave, the blonde levels him with a sultry look Tony didn’t even know Steve was capable of. “Don’t keep me waiting too long.”
) had given the genius an appraising glance and said something about hoping to see more of Tony now that they were neighbors. Tony had
Before Tony could ask, he heard his name being called over the PA system and he sighed heavily as the table (even Rogers) raucously cheered him on as he tried not to stumble towards the stage. He gave a speech. People cheered. They handed him some kind of award (Tony had lost count of them by now, he didn’t really care) and he headed back over to hand it to Pepper before informing the others he was going for another round of celebratory drinks.
. A truly interesting turn of events, considering when he’d discovered his soulmate, Winter had been trying to put new holes in’em.
“Careful, I’d hate to see you wind up in Sam’s cuffs instead of mine. Best do as you’re told,” Steve replied without missing a beat. Guess he recovered from the earlier shock quick enough.
“Internet. Come on, it’s just a harmless little prank. Or did you already forget about the flour incident?”
Then another day, Tony and Rhodey had come back to a grouchy sounding Barnes on their voicemail, muttering something about ‘
“So how about it, Brooklyn?” Tony was taunting, walking his fingers around his stomach and practically pressing against him. Not that he particularly minded, but Jesus, had he ever met anyone this ballsy? The detective’s gaze followed the pretty sight of teeth pulling against Stark’s lower lip, throat tightening in curiosity—focus, Rogers.
Bucky and Sam both looked exasperated but amused. Pepper… well, it was a little harder to read her but it was somewhere between embarrassed and annoyed. Natasha was absolutely neutral, and it threw Tony off for sure. Still, the blonde beside him finally sat up properly and Tony hated that he noted the lack of warmth nearly immediately.
Rogers, to his credit, looked like a deer caught in the headlights as he and Tony stared each other down. Pepper’s girlfriend was friends with
“And this is a flower shop. I’m pretty sure when they moved in the space above, they weren’t expecting AC/DC and Black Sabbath blaring through the vents, Tones.”
when he was near his soulmate. Tony had felt like it had nearly withered completely in the time of their separation. Was that a normal thing? Did… Did Barnes feel the same way about him?
want to talk to me. The mission is over, we failed. Batroc got away, so there’s no reason we need to see each other anymore. So, scram, before I have to arrest you.”
“Clearly you can’t be trusted to bring them in. We’ll be defaulting those special missions to another, more capable team.”
from the bond seemed to dim. It left Tony feeling empty in ways he didn’t know were possible. Rogers had chosen Barnes. Of course, he would; Barnes was his soulmate and his best friend. And Tony? Tony was just… Tony. Rogers had never been his from the beginning. Tony had been a convenient lay, a benefactor. It didn’t matter to the Captain one bit that his mark was branded into olive skin forever.
Tony and Steve shared lingering kisses in the stairwell whenever they could and occasionally defiled the flower shop’s back room late at night.
The glass of bourbon clinked against the desk in surprise, the large fingers wrapped around it going slack in shock. Nicholas J. Fury, probably the most famous spy-thriller novelist to ever exist, dead by suicide? And—wow. That was a lot of money. Huh. Detective Steve Rogers glared at the envelope in front of him as he raised his drink to his lips again, mentally demanding the newspaper clip to hand over its secrets. Strange, that he was given all this to investigate after Fury’s death was ruled a suicide. It was also strange that this whole thing was anonymous. Who the hell hired him?
“A guy done me wrong.” Tony lamented sarcastically, letting his amber eyes look up through a fan of lashes. “What’s your story,
up to you, Thaddeus. It’s up to the Council. Rogers wasn’t my assigned mission that day. Hell, you think that I was expecting to see him there?”
At the mention of Stark leaving the house, the detective raised a brow, absentmindedly pushing his finger against the middle C-sharp of the piano. The musical note sounded through the library, and in response, Pepper huffed.
Bucky looked towards Tony’s expensive shoes with a sigh. “It’s not— it’s not about the event itself, though, I got a very glanced over play back from Steve. I- after having basically no autonomy for decades, I want to make sure everything up here,” Bucky gently raps on his temple with vibranium knuckles, “is mine. Even all the bad shit I’ve done. I… hurt you—”
The thing with soul marks was… no one knew exactly how they worked. Some people claimed it was by touch (which Tony had
“I need to talk to him.” Bucky decided. He might as well have told Rogers that the sky was filled with pink fucking elephants with the way the other’s eyes go wide.
Well, Rogers hadn’t been kidding when he said that it everything had been taken care of. In two hours flat, Tony was being summoned to Stark Tower by a mildly confused Pepper. As soon as he stepped through the door, two sharp dressed women addressed him, instantly confirming his theories. The Rogues were in Wakanda. Tony put on his best bullshit smile and waved Pepper off, going along with whatever the women said he was needed for.
Thanks to the lovely and talented himboplantdad for being my ever loyal and patient beta. I’ll love you forever.
He was finally (essentially) free of Hydra’s grasp. He’d woken up with Stevie and Shuri by his bedside, Rogers’ cheeks all bunched up in that goofy grin that turned his brains to mush. The rest of the team had been waiting for him in the common room when he was finally given the all clear to be amongst the living again and things had been going great. Right up until he’d taken a peep at his soul mark.
Tony had done this song and dance so many times, he was sure he could sleepwalk down the red carpet and no one would even notice. Exit the car, smile, walk a few feet, stop, wave, let the cameras get a few good shots, continue on. Simple. Nothing out of the ordinary at this event, save for perhaps the usual tuxedos have been replaced with lots of dress uniforms.
The following week, Tony was in a rut and he didn’t know why he couldn’t stop thinking about Rogers thanking him at the gala.
Of course not. Not really. Tony’s biggest takeaway was the fact that this was an answer to his prodding. This—
“I mean, May and Happy are fairly obvious don’t you think?” The genius huffs, placing his sunglasses back on his face.
Or some bullshit like that. Tony had stormed out on the call with the Council and Ross’ office before they could feed him anymore crap.
. Better, actually than anything that Steve had ever pictured in his head when he fantasied about Tony. And Stark, much to Steve’s surprise, is pliant and soft under him, letting the taller of the two take control of the kiss. Eventually they break apart for air and Steve’s transfixed by Tony’s puffy bottom lip. He really hopes next time comes sooner than later.
Ugh! How could Tony have been so stupid and distracted? Dark brows furrowed and he stalked toward the taller man, who had at least four inches on him.
apparent soulmates as they move further into the bunker. It isn’t long before they arrive at a large chamber, the whole area eerily silent.
“Well hello, Detective. Definitely not the dad I was expecting but— I suppose you’ll do.” Tony laughs at the other’s expression, eyes sparkling with amusement from beneath his dark lashes. Tony can’t exactly say he’s surprised that Detective Rogers came out to find him.
God, Tony was so infuriating sometimes. “Will you just listen to me? This is the first time I hear from you in nearly a year and I just—”
Tony took the flowers gingerly, amber eyes appraising the arrangement. It was no prize-winning thing but the flowers were clearly chosen with purpose. Jonquils and orange roses; wait, what?
Soul Marks were rare enough as it were, but this? Tony had two soulmates and not a single one of them shared a bond mark. Thinking about it was giving the genius a migraine.
Part of Steve couldn’t get enough of that snark. The other part of him just wanted the kid to shut the hell up so they could fuck. Not that he’d ever fucking bring it up, but between the way the brunette was running his tongue and teeth over him and the way their skin was already sticking together from the heat, Steve was ready.
“He’s not a doorbell, he’s my AI, as in Artificial Intelligence. Jeez, give him more credit than that,” Tony smirked. “So, Captain Rogers, can I get you anything to drink? Make yourself comfortable. I can give you a tour if you like,” Tony murmured, brushing past the blonde to pour himself two fingers of bourbon.
“Mm, you haven’t exactly done anything that merits me calling your name, darling.” Tony was panting softly as his hands finally got Steve’s shirt open and off his shoulders, his voice rough.
“Steve, how do you know that it will even work, huh? What happens if he gets worse? Or it drags up the wrong memories? And don’t— don’t do that. You can’t gang up on me like that.”
. The mysterious woman that managed to catch Pepper’s attention and apparently keep it for quite some time. Pep was counting on Tony’s curiosity to outweigh his will to stay home (not that Pepper would allow it). Damn she was good. The genius threw his arms up in a petulant groan.
There was another item rattling around in the small package. A little black flip phone, a burner. Tony flipped the ancient device open and sure enough, there was only one contact in there. Tony pockets the phone before he makes any stupid decisions. Like calling Rogers and really giving him a piece of his mind.
From the moment the walking Smithsonian exhibit was up and about, they’d done nothing but fight and butt beads about every. Single. Thing. Literally anything. All it took was for the pair to walk into the same room together and bam! An argument of epic proportions was sure to break out.
“And here I was gonna treat you nice.” Tony groused. His voice was surprisingly steady, patient, but it was wearing thin. “Guess you could find out just what my mouth does later. You seem a little desperate to get to me. It happens.”
They make their way up to the third floor. Batroc’s room is the last on the left, right next to the fire escape. The hall is empty, save for the cart of cleaning supplies at the other end. Tony motions them forward as Rogers pulls a gun from inside his coat. The look Stark gives him has the blonde rolling his eyes; what? Did Tony really think he would come unarmed? It was simple enough: Tony would get Batroc to come to the door and Steve would take him out. It almost seemed too simple, if he were being honest, but as far as Rogers and Stark knew, Batroc wasn’t aware that they had tracked him to the city.
interrogation?” Tony laughs at the poorly hidden look from who he assumed was a detective, though the smile faded as he watched the man sidle his way.
Strawberry pink lips curled upward in a grin, snickering as the genius stalked toward him. Steve made a show of looking down on Tony, tilting his chin upward.
As I said before, this was an RP prompt that really just got away from me and I wasn't really expecting to write anymore of it. But inspiration strikes once again! Sorry its so short!
Tony glares at the little flip phone like he expected it to go off at any second, but with its previous track record of almost two years silence, he seriously doubts it. He tilts his head back, praying to Tesla and Einstein to keep these frequent migraines away so he could focus on updating his suits without his head feeling like a beating heart. Just a few more things an—
What exactly had he done last night? Somebody please tell him he didn’t have sex with Cap, and he wasn’t able to remember it! Tony’s mouth is too fucking dry, so he tries to slip away as quiet and carefully from the bed, but a large, warm hand comes around his thigh and Steve’s sleepy voice is just too adorable to ignore.
“It is when I have my new upstairs neighbors griping about my music like they’re some kind of hundred-year-old assholes. It’s a tattoo parlor.”
Rogers slings his arm through the leather straps of his shield once more as he follows in second. “How many?”
The Avenger acknowledges T’Challa first, then thanked Okoye and Ayo and turned to Natasha next. There was tension of some kind, and it only mounted when he turned towards Steve and Sam, who he barely acknowledged.
Tony slapped on his winning press smile and just as he went to shake her hand, he spotted the two shadows flanking her.
” he growled back, tilting his neck upward to expose his throat for the other. The blonde could feel his pants being fumbled with, and his eyes fluttered shut as rough fingers dipped below his waistline.
Tony wasn’t sure, but he was almost certain that Rhodes was snickering somewhere behind him. Asshole. Why was Tony friends with him again?
Tony resolutely looks away when the two soldiers turn to each other, some form of silent communication that Tony would have no chance at understanding.
He watched as yet another decorated soldier stepped up to Barnes and elbowed him harshly just as the man began to open his mouth. Tony had absolutely no doubt it was to say something completely horrible.
The last place FRIDAY had tracked information on the Rogues was somewhere southeast of Sudan and then he’d completely lost the trail. That only raised more questions for the mechanic, some he thinks he may have answers to. Clearly the team was receiving help from somewhere, Rogers had looked much too cleaned up and well put-together for them to be squatting in whichever place they deemed a good hide out. Not to mention, from reports of failed missions to trap the team, they had a bird that STRIKE couldn’t identify as anything made by Stark or any other name here stateside.
Tony’s eyes roam the room for a moment, as if he’s searching for something or someone that should be there. “
The mechanic’s fingers give a neat imperceptible twitch. Bucky definitely cataloged that for future dissection. The larger brunette sighs heavily and runs a hand through his artfully messy strands.
Grant? How did the little cretin have enough time in between the introduction and the car to do his research? Maybe there was a bit of brain in between all the thoughts prompted by his dick.
Somewhere along the walls, speakers crackle to life. “If it’s any comfort, they died in their sleep.” An accented voice murmurs.
“A fight, or some kind of argument, I believe it was.” Pepper murmured, perfect brows scrunching at the sound of the piano going off behind them. “I’m not sure what happened, I think Peter was the only one who heard him. Tony just stormed out. He isn’t a bad kid, he’s just— he’s been taken care of all his life.”
Rhodes dropped a folded, floury piece of paper on the table by Tony’s latest project. The words were written in black ink, a fountain pen maybe.
The council had Tony strung up six different ways, tied up in several different missions all at once. Nearly all of them were jobs that the normal team would have never touched. Pure bureaucracy. This isn’t what the Avengers were intended for. They weren’t politicians or had any particular interests in one party or another, and they certainly weren’t supposed to be used to put out whatever small fires the council deemed necessary.
Tony doesn’t wait for Rogers to respond, instead he shuts the lid on the phone. What the actual hell had he just agreed to?
Bucky planted a sweet kiss on the blonde, smoothing his thumb over the smattering of freckles on Steve’s cheek. “Yeah, but when are we ever filled with great ones?”
But before he can get anything else out, Tony’s leaning over towards the phone and calling out, “Ah, please hold!” While Ross is shouting at him. What? Tony had told him he liked the red, blinky light.
more interesting. He pulled off his sunglasses, stuffing them into his coat pocket as he deliberately ignored “Officer Not-Hottie” and bumped right past the tall drink of water on his way inside.
The brunette saw the way Steve was schooling his expression into something nicer, could practically hear him counting back from ten. Well, well, well. Maybe he wasn’t such a cool cucumber after all.
Of-fucking-course they knew. All of them. Ross and the Fucking Council. They’d sent Tony into the lion’s  den and were probably laughing about it the entire time. The General scoffs and rolls his eyes. “We had a hunch, and it was on a need-to-know basis. You would have been distracted if we’d informed you. And yet, you still managed to fuck things up, Stark.”
Right then was probably not a good time to dwell on his love for uniformed men and women. Nope. Definitely not.
The engineer practically stomped out of the room, Rogers following loosely behind him. He followed his former teammate up another flight of stairs where they stopped in front of what Steve assumed was Tony’s room. Steve wasn’t prepared for the other to round on him.
The proper arrangement had been made and delivered. It had been easy enough, and Tony was in at early hours of the morning to prepare the shop for sale hours. It had been hours before Rogers and Barnes arrived to find their unusual gifts.
Today’s little slice of life included being chewed out by Thaddeus Ross, joy. Tony’s barely pays him any attention normally, but Stark hasn’t had a decent night’s rest in over 56 hours and it’s beginning to catch up with him. Ross’ voice seems to drift in and out, too loud, and too soft all at the same time. Never mind what actual words he was saying.
“Sam! It’s good to see you again, I’m glad everything got sorted out.”  Pepper greeted the man (Sam, Tony catalogues) warmly.
and they’d never noticed. How had they let that slip? Whiskey eyes briefly turned towards Barnes; well, maybe it wasn’t so improbable after all.
Jesus Christ on a cracker. Steve had swooped in and laid it on him like he fucking owned the place, but like hell was Tony going to complain about it. Despite the other moving in on him, it had caught him quite off guard. He’d been expecting something sweet and chaste, very old fashioned like the ‘man out of time’ himself, but it had been anything but. Tony wasn’t even upset about the fact that his body had basically betrayed him and gone slack under Steve’s onslaught. By the time Cap pulls away, they’re both panting slightly and that pretty blue is nearly consumed by black. Oh yeah, he needs to go now before he just says, ‘fuck it’ and drops to his knees right here.
“And what? Have Ross, Interpol, and the Council up my ass? No thank you, I’ve been thoroughly fucked enough as it is…” Tony pauses and rolls the glass in his hands for a moment, “So just you? No…”
As if Tony needed any other reason to hate Ross. The World Security Council. The god damned Accords. This was Nick Fury levels of secret bullshit all over again. Everyone had their own agenda, and Tony was just the stupid pawn they used to achieve them. He doesn’t know why he feels so betrayed; there was never any loyalty to be had between them. But they used him, much like a lot of people in Tony’s life and that— he was so over being used.
They were barely inches from one another, his head tilted downward to study the way the cold light from the window caught the gold flecks in Tony’s eyes.
. This is worse than bad. This is the very last thing that Rogers ever wanted to happen. Fuck. Was this what Nat was trying to warn him about? He should leave.
Steve thought, absentmindedly loosening his tie as he decided to play the brunette’s game. Sidling over to Tony, Rogers tilted his head. “Do you usually invite all good looking detectives investigating death around the area for a nice glass of bourbon and a heavy side of bratty bottom energy?”
Rogers found his gaze and with a secretive, little shit-eating grin, he replied, “No.”  Immediately taking Tony back to the night the artist had shown up at his door. They stared at each other for longer than was probably considered appropriate before Tony rolled his eyes and forced his way into Steve’s space.
It seemed like Detective Rogers was playing his game though, which, okay, Stark could definitely get behind that— or in front of it, whatever.
The brunette is a little surprised by the touch, jolting only slightly as he’s pulled from his thoughts. Steve’s hand is large and fucking warm on his face and it’s making it a little difficult to think of reasons why he should leave. “Don’t be gross.” Tony grouses and the corner of his mouth quirks. Was this even a good idea? They were teammates; work colleagues or whatever. And Steve was old fashioned. He didn’t really strike Tony as the ‘hit it and quit it’ type and Tony was very much that. He was most likely just curious. Once they fucked and all was set and done, Tony would go back to minding his own business. He wasn’t looking for anything serious, not that this job really allotted the time or right environment, but Tony loved his freedom, and no one would be taking that away from him. Still… he couldn’t just ignore the opportunity. “Gimme a sec.”
“What? Why would I—” Steve begins, already on the defensive. God damn it. “I don’t have anything to apologize for, Buck. We both made our decisions when it came to what was most important to us.”
You knew there was a possibility I would run into my old team and you didn’t say anything at all? That’s why you were so hellbent on sending
can’t help him, then I what do you think I’m going to be able to do? I’ve got multiple PhDs, Rogers, but I’m not that kind of —
Rogers had shoved that oversized dinner plate right into the arc, leaving Stark beaten, bloody and shivering from more than just the cold. The usual steady feeling of
Wilson ran a hand over his face, the notebook in his hands dangling loosely between his fingers. It was clear he was resisting the urge to comment something snarky, but he managed to reel himself in.
Rogers snorts, and Tony used the distraction to dip his fingers beneath the waistline of Steve’s bottoms, pulling them down and over his ass. Even still, he had Tony practically pinned. Tony being, well,
Tony stands (much too quickly for someone who’s as hungover as he is) and Rogers moves towards him, nearly stopping chest to chest with the inventor. And for a long moment they simply stare. Stark searching for… something, and Steve searching for any resistance. Of course, Tony is the first one to speak.
and sure that you want this. Why don’t you stay the night? Its not your penthouse by any means but… if you’re still up for it, we can definitely work up an appetite in the morning.”
It was clear Steve had his work cut out for him, a disbelieving huff of laughter slipping off his tongue at that unmistakable challenge.
The brunette looks up at his surrogate father and gives him his best puppy eyes. “I’m just getting up to get a drink and a smoke, dad. I’m not going anywhere.”
to look away. But he can’t. Not even as Howard’s voice says Barnes’ name. Not even as Barnes rears back and makes a bloody mess of his father’s face. It’s only when Maria’s voice cuts over the wet, thumping noises of impact, that Tony shuts his eyes.
Tony cried out, his fingers digging into the other’s thick shoulders as he fought not to arch his back, despite practically being shoved into the mattress.
God. He’d never heard her sound so desperate… so weak. She’s calling out Howard’s name and Tony opens shining eyes just in time to watch Barnes unceremoniously dump Howard’s lifeless body back into the driver’s side seat. The Soldier rounds the car robotically. Tony looks on in horror as Maria’s bloodied face can be seen in the passenger seat. Barnes is completely blank as he squeezes the life from her body and Tony feels his heart shatter all over again.
He watches Rogers get a nervous look about him; Steve was obviously hiding something. Something that had to do with Tony, no doubt. What exactly was he missing from his memories? Had something happened?
was a look that Tony never minded seeing on Ross’ face. The Secretary of State practically hits him with the debrief file before he stomps out of the room. Finally, some peace.
Oh, Steve was so in over his head. As a 33-year-old, it wasn’t exactly like he was real spry anymore. And Tony—Jesus, the guy was a tan Adonis, witty and smart as hell and chomping at the bits to wrestle him into bed. It didn’t really make sense, but if large ex-soldier-turned-detectives were what did it for Stark, he was by no means going to complain.
Steve’s face flashes with something too close to regret for Tony to handle before going back to its usual stubborn stoicism.
“Alright, everybody. I’ll do this again one more time,” Wilson started, pointedly glaring at Tony. “My name is Detective Sam Wilson. I’m with NYPD. I know it’s a bit of a drive from here, but it is what it is. This—“ here, he gestured to a politely smiling Steve, “—is Detective Steven Rogers. He’s offered to help consult on this case and I’m, uh, gladly taking the help. So we’re gonna ask you a few questions, one by one.”
Steve snorts and contemplates ignoring him but something about Tony thinking to reach out to him is enough to spur the blonde into action.
He can tell that Rogers is definitely losing his patience on the other side and good, let him get upset. Tony wants him to feel the same soul-crushing feeling he’s experiencing. Rogers had the ability to contact him this entire time and the only time he decides to reach out is when it involves Tony fixing his soulmate.
Apparently the same alibi had been provided to Ross and been approved by the WSC so, Tony was cleared for travel. Jesus, no wonder the Rogues were practically invisible, T’Challa clearly had all his ducks in a row. Now that was left was the trip there in the spacious, sleek aircraft that made Tony’s fingers twitch with desire to tinker and then he’d be— well, best not to think about that now.
“What? Did you really think I wanted more of you?” There’s a slight pause as another light flickers on and a man is cast from the shadows. “I am grateful to them, though. They brought you here.”
Tony laughed easily and shook his head, handing the Captain his drink. “It is to me. I like a man in uniform.”
Three nights after receiving the package curiosity high and everything else, especially low, the Iron Avenger finally gives in.
Somewhere behind Rogers, a small, old monitor clicks on. The image appears to be some sort of security footage. Steve wanders over to it, Tony following closely behind. Wait a minute…
Right now, Tony was just questioning his own sanity. Stark had flown to Siberia. Stark had found the bunker, the vehicle parked out front. He’d made his way inside only to come face to face with the two Super Soldiers.
Stark orders another bottle and motions for the tables in the corner of the room, private and conveniently facing the door. So… he was here on Batroc’s trail too. Tony’s uncharacteristically quiet as they take their respective seats, the brunette moving in much closer than Rogers would have expected, but he had called Rogers his date. The billionaire flashes another kilowatt smile at their server, thanking them for the bottle and handing off a tip before he focuses his attention on pouring them both a glass.
“Hey, it’s all good. I’m just thankful for all the help from SI, y’all are really doing wonders for the program. Though I’m sure Tasha has already given you the scoop.” The soldier turned to Tony then, giving him a knowing look, and stuck out his hand. “Sam Wilson, Bucky’s told me
“Well, I dunno so much about kumbaya but I do know Tony’s quite the singer.” The glare Bucky throws his way is definitely worth it.
Was Tony being absolutely ridiculous? Yes. Even he could admit to that. But Rhodey wasn’t there to talk him off this metaphorical ledge, and Rogers just—something about him made Tony’s skin itch.
Those whiskey-colored eyes go hard and just over his shoulder, and Barnes knows that whatever little moment they’d been sharing was over.
“I am not getting naked before you,” he shot, sliding his hands out from under Tony and into a position where he could unbutton those jeans of his. That’d be a goddamn crime. Fingers lined with white, tiny scars slipped the button through its opening, impatiently grabbing the waistline and sliding it down as far as he could. Which, to be fair, wasn’t too much considering Stark was on top of him. But it was enough to make Steve’s chest tighten as he grinned in anticipation. “Pants. Off. All the way,” he ordered, voice rough with want.
He took his time pushing past Tony, not bothering to suck in his broad chest to avoid pressing the other against the frame. The genius couldn’t even be offended as the other practically smooshed him into the door.
“So then what’s the problem? Why isn’t our other soulmate here? It’s rare enough to have one, Steve, but two?” Bucky’s arms cross over his broad chest.
Things kind of, maybe sort of, escalated just a teensy bit from then on. Tony was definitely not all consumed with creating overtly passive-aggressive bouquets and arrangements and leaving them at the tattoo shops front door for the two boneheads to discover. Definitely not. He had a business to run after all, he definitely didn’t have time to be petty.
“Where is Anthony Stark?” Steve questioned, brow crinkling as he wandered over to the large piano in the corner of the room. When no one answered, his gaze met Pepper’s. “You, do you know?”
“I was—I was at a gala with Pepper. Oh fuck, she’s gonna kill me.” Tony rubs a hand over his face. “Did we uh-“Tony lets his gaze wander over Steve’s shirtless form and god, if they finally went at it and he can’t remember he’s going to kick his own ass, Pepper be damned.
What would people say if they saw you in this place if ill repute?” Tony absently pointed at different open doors: guest room, game room, lab. At the end of the hall was his bedroom, and he was slowly making his way there.
“W-well. Mazel Tov.” Stark huffs intelligently. This was the absolute last thing he’d ever expected. The Iron Man’s faceplate slams shut with finality; he was definitely
“Hop to it, soldier. I’m sure you’re being expected back," Stark’s voice was low and smokey with desire. “Though I’m not entirely inclined to let you leave tonight.”
They shared a heated look, Tony absolutely giddy with the way Rogers eyes briefly glinted with poorly-concealed desire. Oh yeah, he was definitely going for it. After months on end of uselessly pining and passive-aggressively gifting, Tony finally got the confirmation he needed. Tony hugged the bouquet to his chest, hip perching on the frame of the door.
’ all week long while the two set up shop. Tony had figured things would go on as they did, maybe even better now with all the new man-candy around.
Did-Did Tony just compliment him? No. Of course not. He’s an engineer, a mechanic. He was complimenting Shuri’s work. That was all.
He needs to focus. Finding this hotel just by memorizing what the front looks like is going to be a little tricky but, was it really any fun if there wasn’t a challenge? It’s late in the afternoon, around four or so, and the streets are bustling with people. It will be easy to blend into the crowd. Rogers adjusts his dark denim jacket and sets in the general direction Natasha had pointed him to. This shouldn’t be all that difficult. The hotel looked big and fancy, probably a hot spot for tourists. An older building near the center of the city. Location alone narrowed the list down to just two possible candidates, at least according to Nat.
What the fuck was he even here for again? Ugh. Too early. “Don’t worry, I haven’t died just yet.” Tony snarks and plops into the nearest unoccupied seat. He can feel all his teammates eyes on him but what else is new? He’s also pretty sure he’s still drunk from last night. God, what had he and platypus gotten up to? Tony thinks he hears someone who suspiciously sounds very much like Steve scoff but, he’s too far gone right now to actually give a crap. Ever since Sokovia and all that bad business with the team, Fury’s been holding these “team meetings” to try and hold them all together. They were a mess of crazy glue, Popsicle sticks and wet paper, as far as Tony was concerned but… they could have been a lot worse. For a minute there, Tony really thought that all of this, their hard work and the long hours he’d been putting into the team, to the Initiative, were for naught. After he’d learned what Barnes had done and the way that the team had literally come to blows—he really thought it was the end of the Avengers as a whole. Well… Bruce was still missing, and Thor was off on intergalactic adventures, or something, but the rest of them seemed to be holding on alright.
Oh boy, this guy was going to be trouble. In more ways than one. Tony’s almost to the Audi. If he can just get inside, then no one could stop him from leaving.
“I don’t know, you seemed to be pretty pleased with it earlier,” Steve retorted, rolling his eyes and scanning the area for—yep, there it was. Grabbing the bottle of lube off the bedside table and shaking out the liquid onto his hand, Steve exhaled slowly while slicking himself up.
Curious blue eyes trailed to the bottle of bourbon in between scarred fingers and the detective nodded. “Won’t say no to a drink or a tour,” he replied, lips quirking upward at the way Tony’s voice dropped.
Rogers frowns, wetting his lips and not missing the way that amber eyes track the movement. “Tony, I think we should talk.”
It was a stretch. Tony was probably at some expensive high-end club with Pepper or Rhodes. He wouldn’t just abandon them to quell his interest. Maybe. Rogers was counting on the fact Tony wouldn’t let Steve one up him. Steve didn’t receive any replies after that and after half an hour, he gave up on waiting. Oh well… so much for that. Maybe Tony had found someone else to keep him entertained for the night. Rogers wrinkles his nose at the mere idea of it but realistically, Tony didn’t belong to him in any way, shape or form. He couldn’t let himself get any ideas. The super-soldier begins tidying up his den and is just putting away his materials when suddenly there is a loud pounding on his front door. Steve is immediately on high alert… that is until he hears Stark’s voice waking up everyone on his floor.
As if responding to the musical question, Sam pursed his lips and sighed. Looking over at Pepper, he raised a brow and ignored the question shot Steve’s way. “And why, exactly, did Tony storm out of the house?” If there was a fight, they were all going to need to know about it—and somehow, manage to wrangle the kid into the house while they were at it.
“It’s a movie reference— never mind that. Point is, I’m here to try and help you unlock those memories, Red October. Though, with who you’ve already got as your doctor, I don’t see how I’ll be much help.”
Steve moves forward silently, checking behind the door, in the bathroom where the door had been left wide open, and the shower running. Stark checks the kitchen area, the closets, hell, beneath the bed.
“Adam,” Tony’s eyes are commanding him to go along with it as if he thought Rogers was stupid enough to use his real identity. “Je suis désolé, chéris, on dirait que ma date est arrivée.” Stark hums without missing a beat.
Both Iron Man and the Captain react. Tony powers up his repulsor, while Steve flings his shield towards the window of what must be the control panel to no avail.
They’d stripped him of his right to fight. They’d kept any news that might have even hinted at the Rogues pretty much at completely under wraps. Too bad Tony was good at snooping on his own. Besides, what else was he supposed to do with all the newly found free time he had between schmoozing with whomever the Council currently had their claws in? They certainly shouldn’t have made them mistake in thinking that Ross could keep Tony out of trouble. Hacking into the WSC’s files was a walk in the park and thanks to FRIDAY and his own sleuthing, Tony had been keeping his own tabs on the old team.
A single chestnut eyebrow shot up. “Does this have something to do with that unintelligible, half-growled voicemail your boyfriend left us yesterday?”
Steve’s eyes cut to the other, slightly taken aback at the mention of robotics. Robotic patterns? He wasn’t even sure what the hell that meant. Okay, so maybe there was more that met the eye to the rich fuckboy. Instead of saying anything about it, he simply nodded, gaze turning to the window as the car peeled out of the driveway, quickly turning individual trees into a blur of brown and white and shades of gray.
Cap scoffs; typical. Stark was mostly bark and no bite. He stares down his nose at the shorter man and damn it if Steve doesn’t enjoy the fact that Tony has to look up at him.  He can’t even begin to imagine what those gorgeous brown eyes would like, wide and dark as they stare up at him from a much lower position. Steve leans in just a fraction before he’s pulling away with a smug smile. Guess neither Rhodes nor Stark will be getting their money today. “Oh, and next time Tony, I expect you to be here on time and functioning. If you want this team to work, you have to put in the effort too.” Steve lets his gaze wander the brunette’s body in very obvious observation one last time before leaving him. Tony’s just bewildered and he wants to pull at his hair because seriously? What the actual fuck? A bout of nausea reminds him that this problem is definitely not one to handle today. Today, he was just going to ignore all of that. Compartmentalization was Tony’s specialty after all.
“Officer hot—what?” Steve scoffed, totally caught off guard. The six-foot-something man in front of him visibly tried to make himself smaller, probably out of instinct, leaning against the doorframe and fiddling with his midnight blue suspenders. So it was going to be
Tony’s delivery door had been super-glued shut after that one. A little sticky note written in the same script as their first note was left just adjacent to the handle.
Pepper just gave him a look and Tony ignored it. He did not have it bad. It was just—lust at first sight. So what if Tony had wandered into the tattoo shop one night that Rogers wasn’t in and immediately fallen in love with the man’s art. What? The blonde was a great artist, Tony could admit that. The fact that all the flowers Tony had sent in his passive-aggressive gifting spree were dried and hung in the man’s workstation, didn’t matter at all.
Right now, it was easier to just focus on the problem at hand: Bucky was missing memories of Siberia and Tony could be the one to help him get them back.
The next time Tony saw Rogers and Barnes, the darker haired man absolutely split a side laughing, while the other glared. If looks could kill, Tony would have been a dead man.
Tony swallows thickly and shakes his head, hand outstretched for the device. Oh boy, he’s gonna get it now.
he thought, fingers deftly plucking the cigarette from those cherry red lips of his to steal a drag of his own.
Steve approaches his second in command, hands in his pockets. Tony looks like shit and Steve feels stupid for thinking its attractive. What was wrong with him? Last night had brought up things that the blonde had really been trying to simply push away.
“I didn’t think it was that obvious,” Steve scoffed, fingers pressing against the bridge of his nose to hide his surprise. How was this guy doing that? Had to be the AI, right?
Rhodes was eloquent and polite as always, taking Natasha’s hand in a gentle squeeze as he greeted her.
God, Tony hated his status sometimes. He leans back in his seat, Ross’ breath an assault to his senses, and says nothing. What the fuck was he supposed to say to that?
If Tony “accidentally” elbowed Rogers as he squeezed into the space between the two vets, well, the blonde didn’t make a peep about it.
“What’s your story then, Einstein? Wait, let me guess.” A large hand pressed itself against his forehead in the same way Tony had joked earlier to avoid questioning. “You’re too distraught for that, too?”
Okay okay so, Bucky and the Winter Soldier have always been separate entities for me so, that’s the way I’ll be writing them. I realize it’s different for everyone but I hope y’all don’t mind it too much.
“Depends on how vocal you think you can make me. If you’re good enough, I might be inclined to indulge you.”
“You really missed his funeral after a stupid fight? Jerk,” the sixteen-year-old spat, only to be practically laughed at. Even the rest of their family seemed just as angry with him. Usually, he was just tolerated, given the slip because he had dirt on everyone.
Clearing his throat, the accented voice of the detective took on an apologetic tone while speaking around the cigarette. “I can assure you, we wouldn’t be doing this if it weren’t a necessity. I’d just like to weigh all the considerations before handing the case back over. I appreciate your cooperation.”
Tony wasn’t sure if it was all the bourbon he’d put down or if he’d been reading it wrong but… he was pretty sure that Bucky and Sam had been making goo-goo eyes at each other whenever they thought no one was looking.
Rogers hummed thoughtfully, not looking at him directly. “Tony, then. Figured you could use help with the round.”
“You uh, wanna tell me what last night was about?” Steve questions, perfect brow arching speculatively. He knew Tony had been drunk, there was no surprise there, but Tony had never reached out to him. What had even prompted the topic of Steve’s sexual life?
Tony went on the defensive before he could stop himself. “I most certainly do not.” He tightened the bow on the final arrangement with a little too much force. “And even if I did… I mean, you’ve seen what he looks like, who wouldn’t wanna climb that like a tree.”
Despite the relatively large crowd, they were still missing a key character. This wasn’t everyone. A quiet, Brooklyn-accented voice murmured the observation to Sam, nodding when the police detective confirmed his suspicion.
Tony had been blinded by grief and rage and a fury he didn’t know he could possess as he went after Barnes. The hurt was only fueled by his very own soul mate protecting the other, fighting life and limb to allow his escape. Tony had hurt them both, but it wasn’t as if he’d been the only one to deal damage.
Which meant he’d be fooling around with a possible murderer, but then again, that wasn’t exactly a first. So the detective weighed his options, icy blue eyes wandering the outline of Tony before scoffing.
“We were out having a few drinks and I asked you a question.” Tony waves one hand in dismissive motion.  “Which by the way, you still haven’t answered.” Not that he actually expected Cap to, but he still liked to poke fun at him.
Tony thought, hands going to his pockets for his cigarette case. Still, Tony had drinks to drink and places that were not here to be. He’d be back, definitely to poke more fun at Detective Brooklyn over there. But that would be only when he actually wanted to.
And then of course, Afghanistan happened, followed by Obie and then the fact that he revealed to the world that he was in fact, the Iron Man. Directly after that the whole deal with Justin Hammer happened and god, Tony’s life had been an utter shit storm since Rhodey had found his lily-white ass out in the Afghani desert. One thing after another, after another. There was just no end.
Stark makes a soft sound of acknowledgement, eyes glancing past Steve’s face and focusing just beyond. Steve just wants him to
do with it. Tony hadn’t quite hit that level of fuck it just yet but… he was seriously getting there.
The blonde takes a deep breath, pausing to take a pull from his glass. “The team isn’t here, Tony. It’s just me. This is supposed to be recon only. We both want to take Batroc down, so why can’t we just do it together?”
’ in that growly timbre of his. He and Rhodey had just laughed it off and continued about their day.
Zemo is Sokovian. Gosh, that was a hot subject for Tony these days wasn’t it? Tony watches Rogers face as he studied the other Zemo.
There was a pregnant pause on the other side of the line before the colonel sighed again. Jeez, Rhodey did that a lot these days. “
Huffing out a breath of laughter at that ridiculously obvious glance over from Tony, Rogers continued. “And ‘the prick’ is the one asking questions here, Anthony.” A surprised laugh slipped out of one of the younger kids — Peter — at the retort, crossing his arms in glee.
The other brunette warily nods in his direction, those dark eyes flicking to meet Steve’s deep blue. A silent question. Tony watches Steve’s jaw work for a moment before those piercing eyes are locking back onto him. Oh joy, Tony had a feeling whatever this was, he wasn’t going to like it.
Feeling Tony’s eyes on him, Steve made a point of not answering the question. He guessed it took, because the genius gave up, taking another drag, this time letting the smoke slowly pour out of his mouth as he talked.
Stark barks out a laugh. “Are you serious right now?” He invades Steve space again, “You have me ready and willing- “
Why the hell was it so damn bright in here? “FRIDAY, draw the damn shades will you?” Tony’s voice sounds like shit and he rolls over, right into something warm and rigid. What the— Steve’s broad from is sleeping soundly next to him in a bed that definitely wasn’t his.
War torn hands planted themselves square on Tony’s chest, shoving him backward and onto his bed. Steve was pretty sure he’d never even seen that nice of a bed before, let alone fuck around on one. First time for everything, he guessed. Glancing down at Stark as he loosened his tie and stripped if off, he grinned crookedly.
wanted to see more of Steve. Sweet Tesla, was this lust-at-first sight? Wait a minute, had Rogers been openly coming on to him right in front of his possible boyfriend?
Whiskey eyes towards the other man in the room, watching as Rogers gives him the order to stand down. “Barnes.”
“Batroc was my assignment, originally. You really think we were just going to wait around for Ross to send you or Viz out?”
It had been a particularly busy week for the shop and true to his workaholic nature, Tony had decided to stay and finish up their orders for the next couple of days.
Steve’s brows pinch in amused concern as he comes over and pressed a kiss to the brunette’s forehead. The echoed words weren’t lost on him at all.
Oh, come on. Listen, I know you’re like… what? 100-something? man I’ve lost count. But jesus, Rogers, have some fun once in a while.
“We’re still the leading name on clean energy, Pep and King Kitty, sorry ladies,” Tony grins sheepishly at them when they glare, “King T’Challa asked for me, so I’m kind of obligated to go.”
“So, is that enough information for you, Captain? Because you sure were talking big for someone who hasn’t made a move yet.”
However, after New York, things seemed to settle down just a little bit. Stark had apparently shown he was capable, and Rogers’ charm had grown on Tony, no matter how hard he’d deny it. They’d become something close to friends, maybe toeing the edge of something a little more after one gala where Tony had one too many and had made an absolute fool out of himself in the backseat of Happy’s car while on the ride back to the tower. God. That had been… well.
Broad shoulders raised in a shrug as war-torn fingers began rolling up his sleeves again, not ready to admit to himself where he knew this was headed.
A gala. There was always a fucking gala. Tony thought that he had left these stupid things behind when he decided to separate from Stark Industries and leave Pepper in charge. Unfortunately for him, it was still his name on the building and everything that came out of it and he was the poster child for all the charitable donations, it was his money after all. He’d just really been hoping that Pep would let him be and take the heat for him.
As much as I’d rather not have to deal with you, this looks like our only shot. I can have FRIDAY give us the room number where he’s staying but it looks like your recon mission just became an acquisition one.”
Tony’s hands itch to quiet the damn thing, to simply open and shut it and ignore the fact that it was ringing in the first place. There was only one possible person who could be calling anyway… or was there? What if something had happened? Tony hadn’t reached down the Bond since before Leipzig.. what if- what if something was wrong?
He didn’t understand. Why was Steve being so dodgy about it? Something had clearly happened to the effect that his best friend and soulmate wasn’t speaking about it. But Barnes was a big boy, he’d been doing horrible shit for years, decades. Whatever this was… if Stark wasn’t dead, then he could take it.
Tony suddenly looks exhausted. Much more exhausted than he had looked after the whole debacle with Ultron and after Sokovia. Even after the whole deal with the Accords. Batroc was gone. The room seemed untouched, save for the television and the shower. He’d known they were coming somehow. Stark scrubbed a lightly scarred hand across his face.
“After Stark arrived and you— we, told him about the mark, he joined us on our mission to find Zemo and the rest of the super soldiers. Except, there weren’t anymore soldiers. Not any alive anymore, anyway. Zemo had us trapped. He… he showed Stark the surveillance footage of uh, December 16
Tony obviously can’t help the way that his lips twisted in a lopsided grin. “No, not usually. I dish out surprise top energy every once in a while. And it’s not always murder” He quipped, making his way toward the hall.
The mission wasn’t his usual gig. Tony wasn’t a spy or a special ops soldier or any of that. He was just a genius in a multimillion-dollar tin-can with a plucky attitude. This dude, Batroc or whatever the file said, was going to be difficult to track down. STRIKE (and Steve) had already tangoed with him once. Batroc was going to be smarter, sneakier, meaner, this go around. Not to mention, the man had escaped custody from a SHIELD (well, Hydra, he guesses) compound. Batroc was in the top few of Interpol’s most wanted, right after his old teammates. Tony yawns, swiping at tired eyes and tries to focus on the paper in front of him. Ugh, whatever, he could just have FRIDAY read him the debrief on the fly to Bordeaux. Now the real question was, did he want to arrive as Tony Stark, or try to sneak in as Iron Man? Fat chance Batroc wouldn’t catch his scent either way. Maybe he could even catch a little sleep on the flight there. No promises, though. No, no. It would just be easier if he dressed up and left in his suit, quicker too. Not that fighting in a multi-thousand-dollar Armani suit was his preference but, Government contracts and all. He should at the very least, update Rhodey to his surprise trip.
Steve reaches for Tony’s shoulder but the older man swats it away. “Don’t. Just—this was a mistake.”
“Do I actually need to borrow Wilson’s cuffs? If you really think you’re gonna try going anywhere, I can’t legally stop you. Not a cop and all,” Rogers shrugged.
“Bucky, it’s going to be okay. Tony came all the way here, didn’t he? He’s going to be willing to at least listen to you.” Steve reassured him for the billionth time.
After Tony filed into the main living room, he watched Steve take another count. It seemed like almost everyone else was here: Pepper Potts and her husband, Happy. Their 20-year-old daughter Natasha. Bruce Banner, his wife May, their younger kid Peter. Steven Strange, who practically raised Stark after his parents died. Obie was nowhere to be found, probably off somewhere on business. And then there was Clint Barton, the nurse, and Maria Hill, the housekeeper.
Barnes couldn’t help but flex his left arm, watching the way the vibranium platelets moved almost seamlessly. Okay, so, maybe he was preening a teensy bit.
Somewhere along the line, the two had stepped back. Tony was practically pushed up onto the small table, and he took advantage of it by wrapping his legs around Steve’s tapered waist.
In comes Director Fury and his shady ass secret boy band (which he wasn’t even approved for) and then— fuck. The Battle in New York happened. And just two weeks before that, his entire world was flipped upside down when a certain spangle clad soldier was found quite literally frozen solid in the Atlantic. Captain Steven Grant Rogers, literal man out of time, had been near immediately added to the roster and suddenly he’d become Stark’s problem.
“And I just wanted to say thank you. For, you know, all of this.” Rogers interrupted him, leaving Tony speechless.
God, if Stark rolled his eyes any harder, they might finally get stuck that way. Right, Rogers, that’s why it was only him and Vision in the compound. Rhodey had his own home and life to attend to.
Rogers immediately put his palms up in a placating manner. “Uh, wait that, well, I was going to say that came out wrong but yeah, bad. I can’t hear myself think in my own office. It’s just disruptive. To myself and my clients. I was just wonderin’ if you could turn it down is all. The walls are kinda thin and I’m right on top of you.”
The driver shambles out of the car, clearly injured an struggling. It’s— it’s Howard. The Winter Soldier is there, an imposing figure towering above the older Stark briefly before, much to Tony’s growing horror, that deadly, metal arm shoots out to hoist Howard up by his hair. Tony should look away. He
Stark bit his lip, unsuccessfully hiding the way they tried to twist into a grin. “Then I won’t tell you anything, sour-patch.”
“Tony,” Rogers croons softly, sitting up, “whatever you’re thinking, just stop.” Those deep amber eyes fall on him and he can’t help himself as he reaches out to cup the engineer’s jaw. “There’s an extra toothbrush and mouthwash in the medicine cupboard if you want it. Of course, I don’t mind it all that much either.” Steve looks pointedly at Tony’s pout and he’s just waiting for Stark to give him the word, or a sign, fucking
Oh well. Tony wasn’t a snot-nosed little kid anymore, he was a consenting adult and he could intimi-flirt with whoever he wanted to. And Steve Rogers was definitely on his list now. The genius was definitely going to look him up the moment those two bozos took the next person in for whatever lame interrogation they had planned.
They’re giving you an award and I’m not going to suffer being your stand in again. Plus… I think it’s about time you two meet her.” Pepper hummed as she smoothed down his collar.
Tony of course has his own quip ready and he doesn’t miss the way that Zemo seems so unimpressed. What exactly was this about? Zemo goes on speaking, exchanging words with Rogers about Vienna and how the man had spent the last year. He’d been following and studying them for an entire
“Hey sugar-bear, miss me yet? How are the braces holding up?” Tony hums in-lieu of a proper greeting.
Those cornflower blues swam with worry and reluctance before the big blonde finally came and all but threw himself on the bed with a heavy sigh. God, serum or not, he would never change.
“I dunno Petey, I think Sherlock Holmes would be a little better at pronouncing his R’s. Not quite so—“ Tony mocked the blonde’s thick Brooklyn accent. Oh, the look that got him was absolutely priceless.
It takes Tony two days to finish up his reports and get around to being debriefed. He just— he couldn’t get over seeing Rogers. Sure, he was also pissed off about losing Batroc, but Rhodey informed him that STRIKE had been handed the case. It wasn’t his problem anymore. What
of all people. But the universe always had a funny way of pulling one on him and there was definitely evidence on his phone. Hadn’t he made an override to this already? He would definitely be having a conversation with Friday about this later when his head didn’t feel like it was going to explode.
Through the gaggle of onlookers and admirers, blue eyes catch a glimpse of perfect chestnut curls, a slip of olive skin. He’s in a finely pressed, charcoal Armani suit that hugs every dip and curve of his back like a second skin. Over the chatter of everyone else, over the sound of the soft jazz filling the small space, Rogers hears his voice, low, warm, and smooth. God, it’s been so long since he’d heard that voice in person, and it sends a shiver down his spine as his brain assaults him with other instances of just how
Steve didn’t wait for him to finish the sentence: Large hands were already curling into fistfuls of brown waves, lips smashing against the other’s with the force of a 6-foot-something man who often forgot he was stronger than most. The little needy sound that left Stark didn’t even register.
Here we finally are. I’m so so so so so sorry that it took so long for this update to come out but life has been tough recently and most recently, Texas has been frozen over 🙃
Tony finally finished for the day sometime around nine or ten at night. He was doing his usual rounds, tidying up the front of the shop before making his way over to set the alarm near the front door.
Rogers watches the way the glass presses against shapely, wine-tinged lips. It’s so distracting that the super soldier nearly misses the way that Tony won’t look him in the eye. Had Stark received his package? Did he ever read the letter? God, Rogers had felt like such an idiot after sending it off but what else could he have done? They were newly on the run, hiding from Ross and his goons in whatever ramshackle building they could squat in for the night. Now with T’Challa’s help, they were much more established, much more organized.
That— Bucky definitely didn’t expect that. Actually, he hadn’t expected Tony to be here at all. Bucky had planned on being snubbed and ignored, maybe even insulted by his soulmate. This was infinitely worse. Bucky wasn’t prepared at all for Tony to actually give him the time of day.
The captain wets his lips and nods, thumb tracing Tony’s bottom lip for a brief second before the other pulls away. Blue eyes track the back of Stark as he disappears into the adjacent bathroom and Steve’s practically thrumming with excitement. That was definitely a yes right? The fact that Tony hadn’t just outright laughed or scoffed at him and pulled away? He doesn’t want to jump the gun, but he’s really hoping he’s right. His eyes find the other male’s form in the doorway, Tony’s eyes trained right back on him.
“Oh my god! It was one time! Once! And I was still young and stupid. Jeez, you accidentally blow your best friend’s shitty girlfriend’s mailbox up one time—”
Tony just cooed softly at officer Wilson when he was asked to head in for questioning, plucking a snack package off the table in the foyer. He pressed the back of his hand to his forehead dramatically.
Tony hates that his heart melts a little at the sincerity in Steve’s voice. God, Stark was an absolute sucker.
“Oh, I’m just thinking ahead here,” Steve deadpanned, shrugging as if asking another how much it would take to yell his name was something he did every other Tuesday. The words left his mouth as Tony got his shirt over his shoulders and holy shit, what an expression. The guy was practically drooling, eyes wandering over his torso and making Rogers shudder.
The sound of Steve stroking his cock had Tony’s body practically vibrating with want and some growled, snarky snap at the blonde to get on with it left his lips. Jesus Christ, could he be any more of an asshole? Steve made sure to take his time sliding home after a quick prep, pressing his blunt head into Tony and reveling at the sight of those brown eyes practically crossing.
“Depends on which—jeez, kid, you’re really somethin’, you know that?” Steve snorted, shaking his head as they made their way toward the entrance of the sleek home. Well, it looked more like a museum than a home, at least from the outside. Padding up the steps behind Tony, the blonde was solidly caught off guard by the cool, clean voice over the intercom in the house.
Why was his vision suddenly growing cloudy? Why were his eyes hot? Oh. Tony watched a droplet hit the paper below. God damn it. No. He didn’t have time to wallow. The rest goes on to speak about the Accords, how Steve wished they could see eye to eye but that he understands that Tony was doing what he believed was right, just like he was. Stark swipes at his face and nearly jumps out of his skin when FRIDAY’s voice announces a call from Secretary Ross.
“Think it’s the other way around here, Stark,” he roughed out, biting and kissing on the brunette’s throat, jawline, ears, lips. Anything he could, barely realizing the cigarette was still dangling in between his index and middle finger. “You’re the one who’s not going anywhere.”
It wasn’t fair at all that Rogers could just drop in, looking like the best fucking iteration of himself and ruin practically everything for Tony the way that he did. It wasn’t fucking fair that Rogers could just drop in and tell Tony that he
“You sure about that? Because I will take you home with me. And we won’t be back anytime soon.” Stark rolled his bottom lip between his teeth, watching the other as his baby blues tracked the movement.
Rogers sighs heavily, suddenly looking much more exhausted than he had a few moments ago, before he straightens and steels himself as if he were stepping into enemy lines. “There was a— fight. After the airport.”
As risky as this could turn out to be, it could be their only chance at getting anywhere with finding Batroc. Ever since Steve had learned of his escape and all the shady dealings the man had been doing with his newly found freedom, Rogers had steered the team on his trail. It was a wonder that Hydra captured him at all the last time; each lead turned up dead and then there was radio silence for a long while. That was until a couple days ago, when a street corner security camera caught Batroc slipping into a hotel in Bordeaux, France.
Steve cursed, the words beginning to repeat as he pumped into the other. Once the initial shock was over, he reached around Tony’s waist, hand wrapping around his heavy cock and stroking in time.
hadn’t bothered to let him in on the whole thing. He’s the main reason for the upgrade, other than Shuri just really wanted to show off once she knew you were gonna be okay.” Steve nodded towards Bucky’s new arm. Rogers went a little sheepish then, “I uh, may have severely screwed up. I wasn’t thinking straight. You were in so much pain and I… well, it doesn’t matter. It happened and it’s been a good while since.”
“So, going with the Basil wreath this time huh? Definitely subtle.” Rhodey said from over Tony’s shoulder.
“An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That’s dead… forever.”
“A second opinion on the proposed clean energy project on how to make it further accessible to the rest of the country.” One accented voice told Pepper, handing over a glossy dossier to the redhead.
was this happening? It was weird enough when Steve’s name appeared on Tony, but this? Tony hadn’t even ever met Barnes before trying to apprehend him. What the fuck did he do to deserve this cosmic joke?
Tony rolled his bottom lip between his teeth, laughing softly at the older man’s words. “Oh, I’m the one who had to ask, huh? Figures you would be too chicken
He felt a grin tug at his lips. This guy was so gorgeous it was really just unfair, all tanned skin and toned muscle. Part of him realized he’d been so impatient to get on with this, not taking their time because he wanted this to happen again. Something about that ridiculous snark and sharp-as-a-knife mind. Then again, with Tony Stark, who wouldn’t feel that way?
The genius shot his younger cousin a sharp glare and gave Natasha the bird when her cold eyes turned on him. Jeez, what the hell had he ever done to her? The old geezers he could understand but Tasha and Peter?
Under normal circumstances, Tony would have been only mildly inconvenienced by the new development but nothing about this was normal. For one, Tony had quite frankly idolized Captain America as a child and young teen. As he grew older and more aware of the language that Howard chose to use, he grew to loath the star-spangled-man-with-the-plan. Howard had nearly driven himself mad with looking for the Captain, especially after fishing out the Tesseract. God, Tony hated him.
The Iron Man’s eyes trail from one super-soldier to the next. At least Rogers’ mark made sense, anyone who took one look at the blonde could tell how head-over-heels he was when it came to Barnes. Tony had never stood a chance, no matter what the Universe thought. Tony’s just— completely at a loss. The engineer gives a small, somewhat panicked chuckle, unsure of what else to do at this point. This was
Tony split off from the group to get his drink, tossing back a shot at the bar counter just for good measure. As he made his way back, he realized that his decision had been a mistake. The only seat left at the table was right between Rhodey and Rogers. Fuck.
Steve is clearly holding something back, and Bucky’s got a hunch. “You’ve seen him. After Siberia. You’ve seen Sta—Tony. What happened? Did you at least apologize or somethin’?”
Tony watched those pretty pink lips wrap around the cigarette, schooling his face into a mask of disinterest at the quick comeback.
“Look Tony, I know that right about now, I’m probably the last person on Earth that you want to see, maybe only second to that big, blonde, dumbass over there. I really appreciate you comin’ out and doin’ this.”
“Tones, don’t. We can toss that crap into the incinerator and keep mindin’ our own business. You don’t have to deal with him anymore.” Rhodey’s chocolate eyes were a mix of contempt and concern.
It didn’t take long for him to get a read on the entire family. All rich, all famous, all varying levels of prickish behavior. Well, except for the nurse—what was his name, Clint? He seemed to be a decent person, eyes red and puffy from crying but still trying to be as helpful as possible while the rest of the family ran around with whatever drama was going on that moment. Rogers immediately noticed something was off.
-Rogers, looking like every iteration of Tony’s uniform kink-filled dreams. The blonde was dressed to the nines in Army Blues, medals and insignias glittering in the low lights of the hall. Just—No. This was absolutely not fair at all.
Rogers couldn’t help himself: he threw himself into it head on, a force of thrusts and bites and kisses, while Tony scrabbled for purchase on the blonde in an attempt to simply hold on to him. Amber eyes were rolling back, moans tumbling off his lips in punched-out sounds he couldn’t stop, even if he wanted to. Somehow, through all the haze in his mind, the soldier reminded himself how badly he wanted to beat Tony at his own game.
A bark of laughter pops from Tony and he shrugs, sliding into the car with a coy look. “It all depends,
Tony was definitely praying to all the late great scientists that Pepper wouldn’t see through his bullshit.
Pepper came over and settled a hand on his shoulder. “You know, despite the fact that you two seem to get along as well as cats and dogs, both Nat and Sam are sure that Rogers has it just as bad. Just… something to think about.” She gave his shoulder a tight squeeze before packing up, definitely leaving Tony with lots to think about.
Tony’s eyes whipped down towards his wrist for a split second before they carefully found Bucky’s gaze again.
“Probably a little different from yours. Grew up in Brooklyn—“ here, Steve over pronounced his accent, taking note of the red in Tony’s cheeks, “—and did the whole army thing right outta school. Did a few tours. Came back. Couldn’t sit still long enough to get a degree, so I did some freelance investigator stuff. Guess I did alright, considering I’m here now…”
“Oh I like him,” Peter offered, playfully sneering at Tony as he spoke. Natasha nudged him to be quiet, mumbling something about this not being the time to get competitive.
The engineer cringes at the sound of his first name coming from Ol’ Thaddeus’ lips. At least that word he did understand. “Toddy,” Stark hides the little grin on his lips by swiping down his face. Ross hates that name. “I’ve already told you. This… thing in France, with the pirates? It should be a military thing. Despite the fact that the entirety of your last force was Hydra, minus one, whom may I remind you, you made a wanted fugitive, you still have STRIKE force at your command.”
“I’m in no state for questioning. I’m grieving. Absolutely distraught.” The younger man winked at Steve, who, annoyingly, had yet to speak to him at all. “Unless big, blonde and broody here wants to give me a uh,
Tony noticed small things at first. Sounds like knocking on the ceiling, sometimes louder than others. He’d just figured it was usual shop business, walking around or whatever the hell went on up there. Nothing out of the ordinary.
Steve’s hands ball at his sides. Why won’t Tony just listen for once in his life? He wants to apologize, to—clear the air at the very least. “I can’t take back what I did, I know that. But, Tones, I miss you.”
Large feet froze in place, eyes going wide in alarm at the mention of the name. Steve knew that name. Where did he know that name from? And why did his chest feel so tight?
touched Rogers). Others claimed it was instant, like seeing someone for the first time and something just clicked. You knew they were the one. Some people were born with their marks. There was still so much speculation and so much more that they needed to learn about them.
’ he’d said. Yeah, sure. More like he liked them out of uniform. Steve huffed out a disbelieving laugh. This fucking guy. Then again, there was no mistaking that challenge.
Holy shit, Steve had done it. He’d manage to convince Tony to fly out here. Bucky was shocked but at the same time, he had a hunch that the Iron Man would eventually agree if Steve asked. T’Challa sent Ayo and Okoye to make their plan seem legitimate. Truthfully though, Bucky’s sure no one would question the Dora anyway.
The soldier just wanted Stark to hear him out; to give him a chance to say his piece and decide from there. He wasn’t asking for anything beyond a chance to heard. Bucky knew he didn’t deserve it; Tony had every right to be angry and upset with him. He wouldn’t ask for forgiveness, though he truly craved it from one of the two people who should matter most to him. Bucky would give Tony all the time and space he needed. There was a metric-fuck ton of shit to unpack between the three of them, but Bucky hoped that clearing the air could bring them closer together; they are soulmates after all.
As if the damn thing had heard his thoughts, it springs to life loudly, clattering and chiming out an 8-bit version of that stupid 1966 Captain America cartoon theme-song that Tony liked so much.
He missed the entire team, there was never any doubt about that. Its just… there was a special, fluttery little feeling that blossomed into something
Tony watched as Pepper is approached by an absolutely stunning redhead, curves perfectly accentuated by a sleek, elegant black dress. Both their faces went soft, and Tony knew this was the one. Pepper turned toward him and Rhodes, silently beckoning them forward.
Rhodey, had gotten hurt, seriously so, because Rogers was too busy chasing after his old war buddy. His old— Tony didn’t need to name it, he already knew.
“Or more places to hide in plain sight, Nat. This is the first lead we’ve had in months. I think it’s at least worth checking out.”
This time, Tony had hidden a little special something in the bouquet. Nothing harmful, probably annoying as hell, but after the flour incident, like hell was he going to sit around and do nothing. Unfortunately for him, Rhodey found him just as he was trying to slink back through the front door, a suspicious little package right in Tony’s clutches. The genius grinned guiltily and shoved his hand in his pocket.
Tony snorted. “You’ve got me alone in my bedroom and you’re more interested in my tragic backstory than all the other, much funner uses for my mouth? What a boy scout.” He pulled a cigarette from the case in his pocket, leaning against a small work table in the corner of his room. He lit it and took a drag, waving his hand flippantly.
Barnes looks weary, a bit jumpy, like at any point, he was ready to tuck tail and run. Steve doesn’t look any better. The freeze frame jumps to life, a snowy, secluded road, shadows contrasting harshly against the white blanket that covers everything. Suddenly, a car speeds into view and careens off the road crashing directly into a tree. Stark watches intently as someone who suspiciously looks a whole lot like the Winter Soldier rides up.
The blonde was never any good at keeping his emotions off his face. Did he ask something wrong? Well, sure, they didn’t know each other all that well and the last time he remembered see Tony, the pretty brunette had been trying to arrest him, but, they were soulmates. That had to count for somethin’ right? Not every person found not one, but
Barnes asking to speak to Tony, to send him some kind of message and Rogers adamant that it would be fruitless. Unfortunately for Steve, Bucky was just as stubborn and stupid as he is. Any chance he got, he pestered. Any opportunity to ask and bother the other super soldier, he would absolutely take. Even Shuri and Sam were over his constant badgering. Well? It’s not like Bucky had anything better to do when he wasn’t wasting time amongst the little goat herd around his hut. And as nice as it was to finally have some quiet, this whole, down-time thing wasn’t going to work forever.
The family all looked at each other in confusion. Sure, Tony was a little bastard, but he was right. Why was the other detective consulting? And why did they think there was something more going on?
Tony didn’t even know Rogers could grow a beard; let alone would it ever be that nice. He’d been dressed well and modern enough to fit in with the tourist crowd in France. And his
“Hm,” Steve resigned, the only one in the room to hear his words. He needed the money. And this was someone Sarah knew. The two had been friends all those years ago. Rubbing his thumb against the sweating glass, the detective pressed his lips together. His gut told him this was something important, even though he didn’t have much to go on.
Tony was practically panting by the time Steve pulled away, and they both pretended to ignore the shudder of want that coursed through him. The brunette’s head tipped back a little, relishing in the not-quite-tight hold of the hand around his throat. His eyes fluttered.
It happens again. A little more than a month since the night before the meeting and the day of. Stark must be going for a record because it’s a lot earlier than last time. Steve’s comfortable on his couch, feet up on the coffee table and his sketching materials strewn about him when his phone goes off.
me, Rhodey. I’m fine. It’s going to be fine. I just wanted to update you so you wouldn’t be up waiting for me, platypus.”
“And you’re right. That is the only place I work. Well, sort of anyway. I sold a few pattens for some robotics work to buy myself this. The Beamer was my MIT graduation gift.” Stark chuckles and takes his turns sharply, loving the feel of the car sliding beneath his palms, the slight look of surprise from the older blonde.
They were here, though, the sleek white car pulling into the driveway of an equally sleek White House. “Robotics money too, or was this daddy’s money?” The detective slinked out of the car, shivering against the snow that had begun to fall. They couldn’t get inside quick enough — for more than one reason.
Rogers is holding up his shield, a position Tony’s seen him make plenty of times. The Winter Soldier is by his side, gun trained on Tony’s hot rod red armor.
“What the fuck am I supposed to say to’em, huh? Sorry I stole your soulmate and killed your parents, but I’ve got your mark so let’s hold hands and sing fucking kumbaya?”
Steve laughs and shakes his head, much to Tony’s slight mortification. “Uh, no. You showed up here smellin’ like you’d just drank the entire bar and I convinced you to come to bed. Nothing funny happened.” Rogers really hopes Tony doesn’t think he’s that much of a jerk. He’d never take advantage of anyone like that.
Adjusting his tie as he stepped out of the car, Steve shivered in his tweed suit. God, it was the middle of January. Mind flashing to his cozy white sweater, he wondered if these were the kind of folks who expected him to be dressed to the T the whole time he was here. Blue eyes glanced over to the police detective assigned to the case — a good pal of his, Sam Wilson — while they walked to the entrance of what looked like a damn castle. A strawberry blonde opened the door (Pepper Potts, if he could remember from the short bios he was given on everyone) and they were ushered in.
, wait a minute,” Peter gasped, standing up from his place leaning against the window. He nudged Clint, who was standing beside him, and shoved his phone in his pocket.
Just— avoid being noticed. His look was new and with his beard, he wasn’t as easy to identify but if people saw them together, they might be able to recognize him. But that gorgeous man has such a gravitational force that before he knows what he’s doing, Rogers finds himself crowding in.
The hall was spectacular, as always, filled with all kinds of high-ranking brass and their spouses and dates. Tony was already eyeing the bar at the far side of the dance floor when the sharp pain of Pepper’s fingers twisting his side immediately derailed him.
“Je suis désolé, chéris, on dirait que ma date est arrivée."   "I'm sorry, darlings/honey, looks like my date has arrived.
That was the new title the Council had assigned him. Back to square one. A probationary period, so that he could, in their words,  ‘
Rogers ran a hand through his beard. “Yes, okay. Yeah. I uh, listen Tony, not that I’m not all for expressing yourself and stuff but uh, your music is just--- kinda loud. And… bad.”
Tony’s rubbing his temples with his elbows against the table. Ugh, when was this stupid medicine going to kick in? He vaguely hears Rogers speaking to him, but he really would rather avoid that conversation. Although—Tony and Rhodey still had money on the table since Steve refused to answer him.
They were doing the thing again, those cornflower blues that have no business being as pretty as they are. To Rogers’ left, Barnes cleared his throat loudly.
Only issue here was, if they managed to get that footage from T’Challa, he’s almost certain that it would be found by the Council or at the very least Interpol and that meant— God. That would be a disaster.
Glancing around the house, the blonde didn’t mind all too much that he was making it clear he was prying. Books lined the shelves on the wall, mostly on technology and physics. There was a safe by the fireplace, locked and recently used, judging from the way it was slightly askance from the dust line. His line of sight was distracted at the sight of the bedroom and Steve cleared his throat as Tony wandered that way. Of course he was gonna follow.
The Accords is really where they hit the breaking point. From the moment Tony lay eyes on the paperwork, he knew he and Steve were done for. There was no fucking way in hell that Rogers would go for these, not ever. The fact that James Barnes was the supposed bomber also didn’t help. The blonde was practically foaming at the mouth to get to him before the authorities could and when he’d had a fight with Tony
Steve grunted as he slid in again, rolling his hips until he found the right angle for Tony’s prostate. The resulting cry felt like a jolt of electricity through him, a low groan slipping out as a hand anchored itself on the brunette’s shoulder.
“What was it that you said about finally calling me by my name, huh? Or doing work in the bedroom? Wanna remind me of that?” Exhaling deeply, the detective ran a hand through his hair. He couldn’t help being a bastard. Leaning backward to snub the cigarette on the ashtray, Steve rolled his shoulders and slipped off his suspenders. He promptly moved over to Tony and slid his hands underneath the dark sweater, raising it above his shoulders and over his head.
Imagine that? Tony’d been trying to wrestle the gun out of Winter’s hand, that (awesome) gauntlet the only reason the Iron Avenger hadn’t gotten his hand (and face) blown off. There’d been a slip of both their hands, skin contact that neither of them had seen coming and then that—
He ran a hand through his hair to shake out the rest of the snowflakes. Maybe it was the low thrum of 80’s rock music coming from the radio, guitar shredding and drums beating to a ridiculous pace, or maybe it was the way he felt those dark eyes on him that quickened his heartbeat. Either way, Steve was on edge, fingers fidgeting with his suspenders or matching tie or really anything to keep himself busy.
Tony’s slipping into his shoes, fighting the lure of the bed to his right. Just a few more hours to check out the lead and he could get to bed. “I promise I’ll get some sleep after the mission, scout’s honor, alright? Anyway, I’ve got to jet, kisses.”
The brunette had even signed it with a little heart and everything. Turns out the car had actually belonged to Barnes and not Rogers.
birthday when no name had appeared. It was totally fine. Not a problem at all. He was much too busy to entertain anything longer than a one-night stand anyway.  A soulmate would mean commitment and time, and everyone knew that Tony Stark, Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philanthropist,
Rogers had said, casual as can be, as if Tony had already agreed. As if Tony even knew where the fuck ‘
Ah, the family was all here after all. This was going to be great. Tony cut the engine, lips curling into an annoyed snarl as the dogs absolutely lost their shit when he exited the car. He practically growled at them himself, all too aware of someone headed for him.
“Tony. I’ve known you for almost fifteen years. You really think you can keep anything secret from me? Give me the bag. Please tell me this has nothing to do with our neighbors upstairs.”
The two glared at one another. Fine. Tony wanted to be a brat? Sure. But Steve could play ball, too. “I will use my tie to shut you up,” he warned, running a thumb over Tony’s lower lip.
“Anthon— Tony? No. No one has been able to get a hold of him. He...” Pepper ran a hand through her locks and sighed, exasperated. She looked at Officer Wilson and tried to word it the best she could. “Tony is— eccentric, I suppose. But he’s practically just a kid. Turned twenty-two last year. No one is surprised he’s not here. He’s usually absent from family gatherings. Oh, well except for the gathering for Nick’s birthday a few nights ago. He was there. Everyone saw him storm out of the house.”
Friday’s voice rang out and god, why was she so fucking loud? Tony groaned and rolled back over, not ready to face the day and certainly not ready to be reprimanded for being late. Friday reminded him again, and then his phone went off and fine, fine; he was getting up. Once his mouth didn’t feel like it was stuffed with an unpleasant mix of cotton and dirt and he’d swallowed about three doses worth of Tylenol, Tony dressed and dragged himself to the board room. God, he needed coffee. Shades on and only just barely not falling apart, the billionaire attempts to slip into the room unnoticed but in a room full of supers and spies… yeah, no dice.
“Listen Tony,” the name still felt strange on his tongue, “I just wanted to apologize about— I know it doesn’t really mean anything but…”
The collective sigh of annoyance from the family was relatively expected. “If you don’t mind, I’m gonna excuse myself for some dinner before the show,” he chuckled to Steve, who gave a nod.
Tony hates him. The Avenger rolls his eyes and sighs heavily. Fucking World Security Council. Fucking bullshit. “Well, what are you waiting for then? Give me the debrief, you’re wasting my time, I’ve got to get going, Toddy. This mission isn’t going to finish itself.” Oh yeah, there it was. Now
“So, you got assigned to the case, but he—“ Tony made a point of raking his eyes slowly over the other detective’s body, “he’s here on... consultation? And for what? A suicide case? Who even hired the prick anyway?”
“Of course it’s subtle. Do you honestly believe that it hasn’t crossed my mind that Rogers is probably finding these and has absolutely no idea of my ill-will and intent behind them. Come on, honey-bear, how many people do you actually know that are fluent in Victorian floriography? It’s all in the symbolism.”
“Fuck,” Rogers breathed, dark eyes immediately drawn to the toned, tanned muscle. Tony couldn’t help the laugh that leaves him as he pulled at the buttons of Steve’s shirt, tempted to simply rip them clean off. He untucks Steve’s shirt from his bottoms, running a hand along the seam of his pants.
Tony looks away for a moment. “Could be your story’s not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea that I’m here, I’d like to keep it that way.” Tony huffs in amusement as he leans against the concrete wall. “Otherwise, I have to arrest myself.”
!” being called as he moves away from the door. They wait. Steve can hear the sound of a television playing somewhere just beyond the door. The shower was also on. Blue eyes meet amber for the first time as Rogers silently questions on what to do next. Stark huffs quietly and knocks again and when they again, receive no answer, the genius holds up his wrist to the lock, tapping some kind of sequence into his watch. The tumbler on the lock retracks with a muffled
This is it. He’d mulled it over and well, he didn’t really see the harm in indulging a little. Never did. Tony’s eyes are trained on Steve as he exits the bathroom. Is he nervous? No. Excited maybe… he doesn’t quite feel like delving into it too much. Before he knows it, he’s stalking his way back to bed, intent hopefully clear in his eyes.
him. Did Steve really believe that a piece of paper with a few pretty words and this dinosaur technology would be enough? That this is what Tony deserves from him? Tony slumps heavily against the desk, red light still blinking in his peripherals. God. He wanted to be angry. He wanted to… be spiteful, enraged, indifferent. But he just— couldn’t. No matter what Rogers had done to him, he was still Tony’s soul mate and damn it, Stark had a fucking soft heart beneath that iron shell.
Since Siberia? But that was almost two years ago according to Steve and Shuri. That couldn’t be right. Why would he be away from Tony for so long? Well, cryo aside. “Since Siberia…? Tony’s my—
Bucky’s not so sure about all that, considering Tony basically answered to the Government now but… he sure hoped it was true.
“I don’t know if the man is genius or an asshole. You definitely deserve it though. You better hope Pep decides to use the front door when she drops by today.”
Tony’s smaller form slowly crowded the other against the door of the car. After all, he wasn’t going to pass up a romp with Detective Hottie, not if he could help it. His home was only half an hour down the road and well, he’d taken care of everything that needed it. All files and important personal items were locked in the safe.
his problem, was the fact that he couldn’t keep his mind from drifting back to seeing Steve. Steve, who looked too fucking good for someone on the run.
Strange must’ve sensed Tony’s imminent departure, because there was a strong hand being placed over his shoulder as soon as he tried to rise from the chair. No fucking way they were going to make him stay if he didn’t want to. Wilson got to leave to get food, so why shouldn’t he be able to go out and get a drink? Heaven knows his family probably drained this place dry by now.
, he’s mine. We’re all—” both vibranium and flesh hand gesticulated wildly, “each other’s something! And you just shoved him and everything else aside to come after me. Who wouldn’t be upset after something like that?  I need to talk to him. We need to set things right.”
The blonde took the tray of drinks on his own, Tony too stunned to protest. What—what just happened? Where had that come from?
Stark is reaching for the bottle to refill Steve’s glass (he couldn’t get drunk, so it made sense to him) when suddenly his eyes go wide, and he pulls Rogers closer instead. “Don’t look. Batroc at four o’clock. FRIDAY has been scanning through their guest systems. Jules Benoit is the alias he’s going by. Eloise said he rented a room for a couple days, but he hasn’t been in since then.” Tony informs, referring to the concierge Rogers had met earlier. Steve’s so close their noses are nearly touching, his heart pounding a staccato rhythm against his sternum. Tony’s breath smells like the rich, red wine they’ve been sharing, and like cigarettes.
“And for good reason too, we all know how you get,” Rhodes (the traitor) added in, sharing a knowing grin with Pepper.
It arrived one day while he and the platypus were adjusting the leg braces. The engineer had accepted the package (much to Rhodey’s amusement) and immediately known it was
Rogers, on the other hand, was losing that battle. He’d already taken his coat off, thankful for the glowing coals and the heat of the fireplace nearby, rolling up his sleeves to get more comfortable. He couldn’t think otherwise. But from what Pepper and Bruce gave them — a party full of arguments, alibis for everyone, and contradicting beliefs of relationships — something was up.
It was a tight fit, even with Tony being smaller than both of them and it was absolutely annoying. Tony learned quickly that the Captain was an expressive talker. The man’s large, tattooed hands gesticulated exaggeratedly as he spoke, coming close to knocking Tony’s glass over more than a few times. Rogers knocked knees with him below the table, which of course, caused Tony to retaliate in the same manner. They were all but pushing and shoving childishly until Natasha cleared her throat loudly, their other tablemates staring at them with mixed reactions.
Rogers wasn’t even supposed to be alive anymore, but the Universe had decided that it would shove them together no matter what. Things had gone surprisingly well after that, and even if they didn’t behave like your typical soulmates or if they didn’t do a whole big celebration, it was still pretty nice.
Tony Stark that y’all have been griping about? Like, the actual Tony Stark? Jesus Christ you two.” Natasha tacked on.
“There was nothing accidental about it and you know it.” Rhodey pinched Tony’s cheek as he walked by. “But in all seriousness, it’s about damn time we get to meet your mystery woman.”
Thank you again, for reading if you're still here! Kudos and comments are always appreciated. You can also follow me on Twitter, same username, for updates and random SteveTony, BuckyTony and Stuckony and other nonsense.
Steve’s baby blue eyes rolled harshly, giving Tony a knowing look as he swept past. The billionaire settled against the front door frame to catch a minute for himself.
Steve could hear the panting beside him eventually slow. Tony looked dazed, to say the least, and glancing over at him, Steve smirked viciously. “Hey, you didn’t lose your voice. Well, at least not all the way.” He couldn’t help but laugh at the response, making the faint crinkles by his eyes deepen as he tossed his head back into the pillow.
Wilson’s smile quickly faded as Stark blew right past him. “Anthony Stark, my name is Detective Sam Wilson and if you don’t mind, I’d like to have a word—“ nope?
The shorter brunette hummed in acknowledgment. Bucky watched as Tony smoothed a hand down his tie, nearly able to see the cogs in his head turning.
Pepper was loudly clearing her throat and Tony snapped his attention back to her and her date, oh right. He was supposed to be behaving. To be fair, that was before he knew that Pep’s hot date was going to be bringing this douche-nozzle along. Tony still hadn’t gotten them back for their last prank they pulled on the shop. Seriously, who super-glues a back door?
“You just what? Thought shit would be all, hunky dory and we could hold hands, and sing Kumbaya? Get a grip, Rogers. You made it perfectly clear where you wanted your place to be.”
Tony’s whiskey eyes grazed over the many insignias and patches on the uniform coat. Jesus, the guy was more blinged out than a southern woman’s flip-flops.
And if Tony was sporting a colorful sleeve of tattooed flowers a few years later, some of which matched a certain blue-eyed soldier, well, that was his business.
And well, that had been that. He and Bucky (seriously, what kind of name was that?) had said their goodbyes and Tony had gotten a front row seat to the ‘
Today’s meeting consisted of Fury rambling on about PR (which unfortunately was his fucking department which also meant that Tony would have to participate) but Steve already seemed irritated and Fury for once, seemed to be taking mercy on him, even though he really didn’t deserve it. Rhodes looked a little smug and Tony had half a mind to punch his best friend for letting him get as toasted as he did last night but that was for another, much less hungover time. The meeting ended after what felt like much too long and before Tony could take solace in Rhodey, the man was waving to Tony and exiting with the rest of the team. Stark watches as Steve and Fury exchange a look and then its just he and Rogers alone. Fantastic.
“I’m sure you’d like that. Hell, I’d like it. Guess it’s an easy out to take if you think you can’t make me say your name. Don’t worry, honey,  I understand.” Tony was grinning up at him, tongue lapping at the thumb on his lip
Rhodey and Tony showed up early in the morning, sometimes stumbling on little doodles on sticky notes stuck onto the front door of the shop. Sometimes it was full-on paintings or sketches that they hung on the walls.
Yeah right. That was easy for Steve to say. Bucky doesn’t even really know who that is. He hasn’t had an authentic self in decades. But he smiled anyway and pressed a kiss to Steve’s pink lips in agreement. Best not to add anymore worries.
But Stark is jerking away from him, putting even more distance between them than before. His eyes look slightly glassy. Steve goes to move in, but Tony’s raised palm stops him.
“So, not only did you let Batroc escape after we’d been tracking him for months, but you also,” Ross slams a glossy magazine down on the desk with a loud
“Buck is uh, back in cryo while our… friend, figures out how to help wipe all the mind control stuff out. Tony, would you just—look at me? I’ve avoided them all up until now, this wouldn’t be any different.”
“I’m just keeping my eye on you,” Steve persisted, reminding the young brunette he wasn’t exactly allowed to leave the premise while shoving down the spikes of hope that were begging Tony to do exactly that. On a professional level, at least he’d get the chance to snoop around a bit and find out more about the character. If Stark was the one who had a fight with Fury the night of his death, then this was his lead suspect for the moment.
