“Look, I’m going to drive the first three hours, then we’ll have a break and some lunch and Cas will drive the rest of the way.”
Castiel nodded. “I’m sure you see it that way, but Dean doesn’t see you as family. You are just an obligation he doesn’t want to fulfil, and coming to see you makes him miserable for weeks afterwards. Thankfully Claire, Jack and myself will be around to repair the damage you cause and remind him what family really is. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll take my son to the ‘guest’ house for the remainder of the afternoon. Sam, apologies, I am genuinely happy for you.”
“Don’t worry, you can do plenty of hard work when the baby is born,” she assured him, to everyone’s delight.
“Appy Kissmuss!” Jack shouted in both of their ears, throwing his arms out to encompass Cas as well as Dean.
Cas rose up with a sudden alertness, glaring suspiciously down at his partner. He sniffed the air noisily and winced. “You’re drunk.”
“I do. Maybe it’s not what I imagined for him, and it’s not the easy choice but I love my son and watching Castiel stand by Dean for better and worse for ten years has shown me that the gender of your partner is immaterial, it’s the soul that’s important. Hell, look at Sam’s previous relationships!”
“Hell no, she’s sixteen. But that’s why we have the tracker app on her phone. I just think it’s a bit extreme to use that when a text will do.”
“You mean Kaia’s foster mom?” His dad butted in unhelpfully, raised eye brow and his own glass of amber liquor in his hands. Claire kept in touch with Mary and John far more than Dean did with either sets of grandparents. Her mom’s mom was in a home with dementia and called Claire ‘Amelia’ the few times they had been to see her, but it upset Claire too much to visit so they hadn’t been for over a year, and her mom’s dad was long dead. Castiel and James’ parents were alive, but they had disowned Cas a long time ago and written Claire off as a lost cause when the courts awarded Dean and Cas custody over them, mostly due to her ailing health and his alcohol addiction that didn’t stop him from going to church every Sunday.
Inside it felt a bit more like Christmas. The tree was the same, the tinsel, candles, baubles, lights and music all the same as last night but Sam’s arrival made all the difference. The smell of bacon helped, and Dean eagerly sat down with his extended family for his dad’s famous Christmas morning breakfast complete with eggnog.
“I think we should revisit your stance on smoking,” Castiel said flatly while he chopped up a carrot and some cheese for Jack to snack on while he played on his iPad in front of the tv. It was unlikley he would nap after eating candy but they could hope he drifted off or else he would be a nightmare come four pm.
Samuel looked attacked, he genuinely didn’t understand why everyone was getting at him. “What? I’m just asking.”
“Ever.” Dean smiled big and wide. Claire glared and muttered something unintelligible under her breath before ducking into the car next to her brother.
“Hey, that only happened once!” Dean protested as they all made their way back inside the farm house.
Once he was calmer he rejoined his family, and luckily no one mentioned Claire or being gay again, so he was able to drink in peace and watch Castiel laugh at a story that Mary was telling him, something about Dean trying to change Sammy’s nappy and Sam was crawling away from him. Dean couldn’t have been more than five in the story, another remnant of a fucked up childhood but not something he wanted to forget or could resent. Mary had been ill, in and out of treatment centres for cancer. She’d been diagnosed when Sammy was still in her womb but refused early treatment because they would have had to abort. Sammy had been born, costing them both a healthy mother, but Dean hadn’t let him go without love and care even if their dad had been too busy destroying himself over their mom to do his job. Sometimes when Dean remembered that he felt less guilty for disappointing his dad by falling in love with a man, but that was rare.
“I guess make up sex it is. Although we haven’t really got any making up to do, so the name is incorrect.”
Cas collapsed back down on the bed, his nose shoved into the crook of Dean’s neck and his arm pulling Dean close against his body. Snoring filled the room seconds later and Dean rolled his eyes. Yeah, he was totally going to be able to sleep through that.
Lunch time rolled around and no Cas only a voice-mail to say he’s been spotted by a neighbour and gone to help them with some garden work while their kids played. Dean went out and opened up Baby, knowing that the only thing that would stop him spiralling was working on his Impala. Hours went by and finally Castiel walked up the drive with Jack in his little push-along-trike.
“We’ll lock the doors and put the baby monitor on. C’mon, Cas, when do we get a change to fuck in daylight?”
Dean stopped what he was doing and turned to look at his brother’s furrowed brow. “Why? Did she say something to you?”
They hugged it out with Jodie, Alex and Kaia before getting on the road again, Dean safely in the driver seat as Castiel’s hand stayed calm and steady on his thigh.
Sharp painful beeping woke Dean hours later to en empty bed and a cold cup of coffee. He found a crumpled note on his husband’s pillow that read ‘took Jack to park, Claire is ‘out’ doing something ‘with friends’, be back for lunch’. The alarm clock told him he had two hours to drown himself in the shower or pluck up the courage to call his mom and tell her that he would rather be torn to shreds by a Hell Hound than go to his grandparent’s house for Christmas. Motivated despite the pounding headache, Dean levered himself out of bed and ducked his head under a freezing cold spray before gulping down the stale coffee and heading for the kitchen.
“My baby would be loved even if she or he was deaf, blind, gay or transgender. My love is not conditional. But no, my deafness is because of an accident that happened when I was born and not a birth defect. Asshole,” Eileen reamed Samuel out in a way that Dean truly admired, but he could see the tears in her eyes as she flew past him and out of the lounge.
Dean swept the items off the table top in a fit of rage, bottles smashing and papers flying around him. Fucking guests? Fuck them and their ‘and guests’. Dean chugged the rest of the bottle and stuck his headphones on blasting out Led Zeppelin’s finest tunes as he struggled to calm down. He switched his iPod off after When the Levee Breaks finished and started the clean up process. He wasn’t a young man any more who could let himself be controlled by his anger, he had a home, a family and responsibilities and that included not leaving broken glass and shredded paper all over the kitchen floor.
“It’s probably for the best,” Castiel agreed, and pressed a dry kiss to his husband’s lips. Dean raised his left hand to cup the back of Castiel’s neck and deepened the kiss with his tongue. A loud groan echoed in the car. “You know what Claire being gone does mean?” Cas said breathlessly when he finally broke the kiss.
Both Dean and Sam beamed and grabbed her in a hug, Sam saying, “We've got so much to tell you, so much crazy shit has happened to us, I don't even know where to start.”
The king fell ill soon after the eldest prince turned twenty-one, and passed not long after. The loss of a king who the people had feared for so long and now, were terrified of what their futures would hold in the hands of the prince.
Slowly, he reached his hand out and turned the handle. He was holding his breath, his whole body felt numb, and when he peeked his head in his heart went into overdrive. Cas was in fact there, asleep in his bed, the blankets resting low on his hips showing off his toned back.
“Earth to Sera,” Dean got up and started walking over to her, “do you have any thoughts on what we’re dealing with here?”
Cas smiled and accepted the ring, slipping it onto Dean’s left hand, copying Dean's action and placing a sweet kiss on it. “There, now everyone will know that you and I belong to each other.”
Dean felt the rage build up inside him, bubbling over, encompassing him. "You mean to tell me that you've been alive all this time, and when the world went to hell you just sat back and watched?!" Chuck just stood in place, smirking at Dean as he went on, "You're supposed to be our saviour. Almighty and merciful God, tucked tail and ran when things got a little too hard."
She took a breath, gathering her thoughts before she spoke, "I didn't really know what to say. I wanted to find you, I… even though I was mad at you both for leaving without a word, I did miss you. You two were the only friends I had, my only family outside of my parents. And when I was staring at you on the street, I just couldn't do it. I was afraid you wouldn't have wanted to talk to me, afraid that six years of distance was too much, so I just turned around and left. It was an accident that I found you tonight."
“I’ll be honest, you guys were pretty good at keeping that secret. I knew there was chemistry there, but I didn’t know that you were acting on it. I probably should have paid more attention.”
“I won’t. We’ll come back by then and go over what we found. Hopefully we can at least get a few leads.”
“You’re my life partner. Forever. I’ll follow you to heaven when your life on this earth ends, and we’ll spend eternity together.”
Castiel shudders and feels his body growing weaker. When Michael steps back, Castiel nearly falls to the ground. He’s caught by Dean.
Castiel had lived in Georgia his whole life. His parents were from Pontiac, Illinois, so Castiel didn’t end up with a southern accent. He still heard it all around him, so every once in a while, he’d say a word differently than how someone from another part of the country would.
Dean felt a little strange by himself in Castiel’s house, but it wasn’t too hard to adapt. Dean brought in more from the car, including the boxes of toys and more sentimental items. The u-haul was probably overkill for the amount Dean packed, but it did make things much easier. All of this probably wouldn’t have fit in Castiel’s trunk.
“Oh, getting cocky, are we?” Castiel put a soft hand on Dean’s shoulder, looking almost innocent. Suddenly, he pushed Dean onto his back and swung a leg over him, straddling his hips. “What made you think I wouldn’t still want to be on top?”
“Of course I was still going to buy you a present, dumbass. Open it.” Meg crosses her arms over her chest and leans her weight onto one leg.
Dean flushed red, all of his blood rushing south once he was pinned. He groaned and bucked his hips up. “C’mon, Cas, don’t tease.”
Dean nodded and kissed Castiel’s cheek. “I’m ready if you are.” He gasped softly as Cas lowered himself, tight heat surrounding his cock. “Shit, you feel good.”
Castiel nodded. “It’s definitely good for confidence to see everyone here. I didn’t expect a crowd this big.”
The doctor spoke with Dean shortly after he woke up. She explained everything about the suppressants and how they would work, which was just a longer version of what Michael told him. They felt okay about releasing him that night under Michael’s supervision, since he wouldn’t be starting his heat again soon.
Castiel joined Dean at the fridge. “You know I can’t cook, but if you need help, let me know what I can do.” He gave Dean a knowing smile, which definitely didn’t make Dean’s heart melt into a puddle in his chest.
Dean sat down on one end of the couch. “Thanks. You seem pretty cool too. I thought you and Cas would be way more similar, but you’re really different personality-wise.”
Castiel took a deep breath and slowly leaned against Dean. “Screw the no touching, I need something.”
Dean nods. “Yeah, let’s do it.” He kisses Castiel’s nose, holding him close, as if he never wants to let go. It makes Castiel feel safe and gives him hope that this will work out.
Castiel flinches, much to Dean’s surprise. He opens and closes his mouth, trying to find the words he needs. “I don’t think you should. My wings are very sensitive.”
Castiel doesn’t mind the nickname, it’s actually kind of nice. He pulls out his phone to let Meg know that she can come over.
“Well, there’s a lot you don’t know about me either. You never questioned why I know how to stalk people.”
Dean curled up to Castiel and sighed. “I hate to say it, but I’m really tired. Sex all day isn’t that hard when I’m in heat, but today was exhausting. It was perfect, but I’m tired. I don’t want to sleep, though.”
Castiel nods a bit, suddenly a little more on edge. Dean’s flirtatious nature was very much welcomed, but that didn’t stop Castiel from getting extremely nervous about it.
Castiel smiles and steps in front of Dean. He pays his bill and moves to the side to let Dean do the same.
Meg pats Castiel on the shoulder. “You’ve got this. I believe in you. Good luck.” She steps out of the car, leaving Castiel alone with his music.
Dean checked his phone and slipped it back into his pocket. “Have you been doing alright? How’s life?”
Gabriel touches two fingers to Castiel’s forehead, and Castiel closes his eyes. When he opens them, he doesn’t remember anything about his angel life. All those wars, all the years of human history, gone.
Castiel follows closely behind Meg and spots Ruby. They make eye contact and it makes Castiel freeze for a few seconds. Ruby has long brunette hair that has a mild wave to it. Her eyes are dark and piercing. Her gaze cuts straight into Castiel’s soul. She stares him down until he finally breaks the eye contact and practically runs out of the apartment after Meg.
“I’ll be home early tonight, around 6:30. We’ll leave for the dinner at 7, and we won’t eat until about 8:30, so you might want a snack around 4.”
Dean shrugs. “We can do it. Worst case scenario, we hide some boxes in the closet.” Dean had met Castiel’s parents shortly after the angel incident. He was terrified at first, but Castiel’s parents adored him, so there was nothing to be afraid of.
Castiel holds Dean practically in his lap while they watch Game of Thrones. The volume is on low and they have closed captions on for easy watching. The show could get loud at times and that felt like too much right now. Castiel buries his nose in Dean’s hair and breathes in the smell of his shampoo.
Castiel took the envelope and slipped it into his jacket pocket. “Have fun explaining what happened to Dean. You know he’s not going to believe you if you say I just left. He knows I wouldn’t.”
It was the sixth day of their plan, and Dean was in a sour mood. He couldn’t pinpoint why, but nevertheless, he wanted to be left alone. He didn’t speak much that morning, and over breakfast, he was stabbing his omelette a little more aggressively than usual.
Sam talked endlessly to Dean about his classes this semester and his upcoming finals in a few weeks. Sam was so passionate about school and it made Dean’s chest swell with pride. Hearing Sam talk about school reminded him of why he did this, and made him feel better about everything.
Castiel returns outside with another glass of ice water, passing it to Dean. “How did your orientation go?”
Dean shakes his head. “I came out to my brother...three months ago now. I didn’t have a lot of close friends at KU, so I didn’t ever tell them. You’re the second person who knows.”
Dean shrugs, swallowing his mouthful of food. “We’re good friends. If someone spots us at a restaurant, we can just say that I’ve never been to that one and you took me.”
The next morning, Dean didn’t feel much, so he started to wonder how long it would take for the suppressants to wear off. He skipped his morning dose that he usually took with breakfast and went about his day. He did some prep work by stocking his room with towels, water, and protein bars. By dinnertime, he was starting to feel a little sick and the cramps were starting. He took some over-the-counter painkillers and went to lay down and rest up. He was nervous about this heat before, but now he could be at least a little bit excited.
And thus, the back and forth begins. Gabriel proves himself to be a well-versed player, sinking a cup on his first two turns. Castiel takes a few turns to warm up, then starts sinking cups like a pro. Dean turns out to be a pretty good player, sinking cup after cup. Ash isn’t the best at cup pong, but he damn sure tries. Jo yells at him to play like she taught him while Meg cheers on Castiel. Charlie stands beside Meg and teases Dean whenever he misses.
Castiel smiles fondly at Dean. “I could say the same for myself.” He slowly moves off of Dean and lays down beside him. One wing stays straight out behind him, and the other gently covers him and Dean.
About thirty minutes into the movie, Dean’s laptop pinged. He saw an email from an unknown address and clicked on it.
The door opens and Castiel’s eyes shoot open when Dean’s feet collide with his outstretched legs. There’s a thud and Castiel sees Dean on the floor.
Humiliation set in quickly, and Castiel had to spend another ten minutes composing himself. He already heard Luke leaving the house, so at least he was gone and Castiel wouldn’t have to face him.
Cas frowns and tilts his head. “I texted you and told you what time I would be here. Did it not go through?” He pulls his phone out of his back pocket and looks at it. “Oh. It would seem that I did not hit send. My apologies.”
Castiel walks straight to Dean’s room and kisses him hard. There’s something more behind it this time around. Castiel has known for a few weeks that he loves Dean, but now it felt even more powerful when he knew Dean loved him back. It was potent and it devoured his very being.
Dean woke up and he could feel the fluorescent lights behind his eyelids. He scrunched his eyes closed tighter before slowly opening them. He wanted to groan in displeasure at the sight of a hospital room. He felt a hand on his arm and looked to his left to see Michael right there beside him.
“It’s not going to happen. I promise.” Castiel kisses Dean one more time. “I’ll see you in a few weeks for New Years. Drive safe.”
“I could see it. He lived here, with a woman, human. She was killed, and Jack was taken by someone. I couldn’t tell who or what took him. The presence of Jack doesn’t go back very far, only a few weeks. Nephilims don’t age normally. Jack could very well be only a few weeks old.”
Dean turned his attention to the bathroom to attempt to work the shower. It took him a few minutes to figure out all of the fancy knobs, but once he had it down, the shower was heavenly. The water beat down on his back and neck, forcing his body into a state of relaxation. It was only now that he realized how exhausted he was. Collapsing on the bed was the best feeling in the world after that amazing shower. Dean fell asleep within the span of three minutes, curled around one of the fluffy, downy pillows.
Juggling class and a baby was hard. Castiel quit his job, easily able to survive on his savings. He had barely made a dent in his divorce settlement in three years, so living off of it for a while wasn’t out of the question. Castiel took Jack to class most days and got a sitter when he had exams. He took Jack to visit Jimmy frequently. It was nice to reconnect with his twin and rebuild their relationship.
"Around somewhere," he answered, as he turned and placed a cup of coffee in front of Dean, "she was up before I was today."
"Dude!" Dean just grinned back at him, which made Sam even more mad. "If you two don't wanna watch the movie, then why don't you go to bed?"
Cas very quickly burst into tears again and Dean instantly pulled him into his chest, gently rocking them back and forth as Cas cried it all out.
“I…” Dean looked down at his feet and sighed, “will you please just come and talk to us? We were kids back then, our dad was pissed that Sam left for college, breathing down my neck about hunting, and I… I didn't want to drag you down in my dad's reign of terror. It was bad enough that all three of us were raised in the life, but we didn't all have to go down with that ship. I figured if I left you I was saving you.”
"Thanks, Sammy," Dean said as he took it, then settled himself against Cas's side again, "it means a lot that you guys liked the show."
"I, you… did you just make a Harry Potter reference?" He was still stuck on the first part of the conversation.
“Yeah, of course!” Dean smiled up at Cas, “It will give me a chance to get to know the little guy, and who doesn't love ice cream right?!” He then turned his attention back to Jack who was slowly but surely stepping out from behind Cas’s legs, enough so that Cas was actually able to get one leg free from his hold, “So, do you wanna come, Jack? There's also a super cool playground there!”
He gently laid Sam down and slowly pulled himself towards the two small objects now a few feet away from him. He lifted the covers and in the two small car seats in front of him he found exactly what he was afraid he would find. Two babies, two new born babies, a little boy and a little girl both staring back at him. And inside the baby boy’s car seat there was a brown envelope with the words 'Attention Dean Winchester' on the front. He took the envelope and reached a hesitant hand inside to pull out the documents. And after he slowly and carefully read the first paper all he could do was just stare at these two little babies in front of him, Sam behind him, and try not to throw up as the hole in his stomach got infinitely bigger with every second. What was he supposed to do now?
“There are none,” all three shot him a confused look, “Mr. Edlund booked our venue long in advance so that he could book the entire venue, including every room so as to make sure that the after hours hunt would not be disturbing any outside guests. All the rooms upstairs are empty.”
As soon as the Impala pulled up beside Cas’s house, the all too familiar hum of the engine hit Jack’s ears and he was running for the front door, Balthazar and the rest of Castiel's brothers right behind him.
“Dean,” Cas breathed, stepping closer and placing a hand on his cheek which Dean turned into, closing his eyes, “just let go, fall with me.”
Sam nodded against his head then they parted. He stood and watched as Dean began walking towards the cliff that hung over the sea below, and the small shack that made its home atop it. His brother had always been a wise man, he only hoped he would do what he knew he had to and make the right decision for their people.
Dean gave his brother a look, “Sammy, I would give anything to have someone want for my attention as much as he does for yours. Give him a chance.”
“Cas…” Dean took a few steps toward the front of the stage, speaking his warning a little louder this time but still getting no reaction out of Cas.
“Your father is gone now, Honey, has been for four years," she gave his hand a squeeze again, and this time she managed to catch his eye, "you have to stop looking over your shoulder and expecting him to be there. It's only holding you back. He would have been proud of you no matter what, he loved you."
When Dean got home from rehearsals that night it was still pretty early. His mom and brother were still asleep, which he decided was for the better, seeing as his stomach was still turning pretty bad. The tickets were weighing heavily in his duffle that was slung over his shoulder, he could practically feel them burning a hole through the bag. But he pushed the thought aside for now since they were still passed out in bed, and decided to occupy his mind with doing some laundry instead. His tights were a complete mess from rehearsals this week and he would rather just get it done now before his mom and Sam woke up.
“Ye-” He stopped short, realizing what Dean had said and what he had done, almost getting caught in the trap. “I…”
He filled it and handed it back to Jack who took it slowly, and a still stunned Cas managed to stutter out, “J-Jack, manners.”
The man’s eyes, and Dean’s for that matter, both went wide at his words as the man stuttered, “Did… did you just ask me out?”
Sera nodded in confirmation then walked over to kneel beside the girl. “Hi, you're Natasha right?” The girl nodded, still not looking away from the computer. “My name’s, Sera. Are you working on some homework?”
“Why don't you just call him, Dean,” they walked out the doors together and were now standing out front of the diner, “you obviously want to, so just call him. You and I both know that no matter how busy Cas is, he will always make time for you.”
She turned a few more pages, making her way to the back of the book when the writing changed, Dean’s handwriting now covered the pages. “Okay, so you hunted a werewolf, killed a vamp nest, killed the yellow eyed demon, and-” she stopped and took a breath as she read the page, then another, and another. As she flipped through the pages at the back of the book, she came across not only new monsters that Sam and Dean had encountered, but also notes on her. Dean’s thoughts on where she was, places he had travelled to find her, leads that eventually turned into dead ends, and all with dates leading up until his last entry three day ago.
He made his way through the first floor, stopping by the bar to check in, then wandered up to the second floor to circle the halls. All seemed quiet so far.
“It's alright,” Dean slapped a hand on the desk then turned and pointed to the elevators, “any way you could get us up there to have a look at the scene?”
“The saviour of Earth shouldn’t have to walk the halls of Heaven so heavy, Dean.” Dean clenched his eyes shut and took yet another calming breath, then turned to face Jack, “You have sacrificed yourself over and over for the world below, and even some of the people here. You should be happy, Heaven is a place where you should be happy.”
Sam let Dean's arm go and turned back to the movie, hoping that his little blow up would have put Dean in his place… of course not.
He shuffled his way down the hall and found two of his brothers in the kitchen, one making tarts and the other sitting at the counter eating them equally as fast. He took a seat at the barstool and grabbed one for himself.
Chuck's fingers finally touched Dean's forehead, the room was filled in a blast of bright white light, and that was the last thing he saw before everything went dark.
After about an hour the two met back up in the map room, shoving their findings into the few duffels Dean grabbed from his old room, when a pounding at the door had them both frozen and silent. Eyes wide, Dean looked to Jody for an answer who just shook her head, as lost as he was.
Sera and Sam sat in the room and laughed together for a few more minutes before she reached into her bag and grabbed her laptop, “I'll bet this shit's online, and Dean can't burn down the internet,” she cackled.
“My father thinks it would be best to go see what it is that she wants and get it over with as quickly as we can,” Cas then started to panic again as he continued, “and there lies the other problem. I do not, under any circumstances, want Jack anywhere near this situation, or her, regardless of the fact that despite all she has done she is my mother. I do not want Jack to know her. But I have no one to watch Jack! It's far too late to get a sitter for tomorrow, I do not know how long we will be gone for, and then there is also the fact that there is a very high probability that Jack will outright refuse a sitter. So I don't know what to do!”
“I will be back as soon as I can,” he placed a hand on Gabriels shoulder with a squeeze, “hopefully the Gods answer me quickly so I may return and we can decide on our next move.”
Not too soon after that, Sam suddenly found himself fighting off both Dean and Cas's legs. The two of them had started trying to play footsie over top of his legs and now the three of them were a tangled mess no matter how he tried to move his legs to escape. Sam knew what he was doing, he knew exactly what Dean was up to and he was going to be damned if he let Dean win. This was his night, damnit, his one night to sit back and relax and that's exactly what he was going to do!
“First off, you guys are all so successful!” Cas smiled triumphantly, “And second, any time Gabriel needs a taste tester, and I do mean any time, sign me up!”
“Alright,” she handed the laptop to Sera, “but you have to bring it back, I have school work on there, and my book!”
"Assuming this has something to do with the world being frozen. Glad you're back by the way. The world was boring while Chucky had it frozen. No deals to be made, no fun to be had."
“You've really thought this out,” Sera nodded, impressed, “this is definitely something I would read.”
Everyone in the group let out a few fist pumps and cheers, and Cas turned to lean into Dean and whispered, “Thank you,” and Dean smiled and kissed Cas when he leaned in for one.
Sera ignored her question once again and knelt back down beside Natasha, “You said that the spirit in your story kills every three days right?” Natasha nodded, and Sera started mumbling to herself. “You wrote this first part six days ago, the first incident happened three days ago, that means tonight’s the sixth night… what was the last thing you wrote?”
“The man running the convention insisted we continue with the event, he then donated a generous sum of money and said that the murder would ‘add to the ombiance of the convention’,” the man shrugged then continued, “My name is Vincent Holwell, is there anything I can help you with?”
“Your mom?” Dean asked confused, “I thought your mom left when you were young? What's wrong with her?”
The girl looked her over once more, then decided to turn the screen towards her, “It's about a haunted inn. It's called the Michigan Maiden.”
The kid walked them over to the elevator and used his key card to open the doors, “You can get back down whenever you're finished without the key card. Sorry I couldn't be of much more help.”
The phone rang for what felt like a lifetime before someone picked up, and Dean sighed as the familiar voice hit his ears, “Hello, Dean.”
Dean didn't answer and instead just smirked at Sam with a wiggle of his brows, then turned back inside the room and closed the door. Leaving Sam to have his own silent victory party out in the hall. It was about damn time.
She took a deep breath, wringing her hands in her lap as if itching for the item she sought. "I want to see it."
“Whatever helps you sleep at night.” She winked at Dean with a smile, the first time he'd seen her smile in six years and he smiled back.
The door opened a crack and Amanda peeked out. Upon seeing it was Sera and the boys, she opened the door and let them in. “Agents, what's going on? Who was that woman?”
Cas exchanged a worried glance with Dean before turning back to Jack and answering, “Yes, I am, but only for a few days. And this means that you get to spend some time with Dean at his house while I’m gone.”
Pamela went silent again, tilting her head back and closing her eyes. “The Gods do not tell me everything I wish to know, Dean, and there are some things they wish for you to discover on your own.”
Dean wasn’t one to cry at these kinds of things, not usually, but he would be lying if he said he wasn't a little choked up at Cas’s words. He knew that the Angel over the years had caused a monumental change in himself, but he never realized how much he had done the same for Cas.
He walked over to it and grabbed it from the wall and all this one said was, “Cas,” with an arrow pointing to the right. He followed it, finding yet another note with the same message, and another, and another, until he found himself in front of Dean’s hidden little man cave at the back of the bunker. The note on the door this time said, “Come on in, Cas, and look on the tv.”
Sam chuckled again, caught his breath then said, “But getting back to the case, we should probably head back to the bed and breakfast and see if we missed something. I’m having no luck anywhere else.”
“Wait!'' Dean looked up to Cas with a start, and everyone else in the theater followed suit. “I may have someone who could help.”
Gabriel got up from his seat to stand next to Cas and leaned in to say, “I have said it before and I will say it again, marry him!”
Jack started to shake his head again and Cas stepped up beside Dean and pleaded, “Can Dean please push you on the swing, Jack, please?”
She took a moment before she just nodded, but that was more than enough for Sam and Dean at the moment. They both gave her hand one last squeeze before letting go and Dean said, “Come on, let's get out of here.”
Cas watched the baby deer try again and again to stand helplessly, listening to it's cries of pain every time it tried. He looked down at his hands, closing them into fists and trying to hold back the tears that were now welling in his eyes. He couldn't heal the baby. With his grace gone he was all but useless, first to the Winchester's who were both in as bad condition as he was, and now to this helpless baby deer.
"If you say so, Dean,“ and he walked in. There was another note on the tv right where the last note had said it would be, so he read that one, "I knew you would end up wandering around, bored with nothing to do. So I cued up a new Netflix series for you to watch, there’s also beer in the mini fridge, and snacks for you in the cupboard above it. When I get back, maybe we could have a movie night? Haven’t had one in a while. Dean.”
They stayed in the church for a while, standing under the archway, kissing, holding each other, calling each other husband. Dean wasn't sure how long they had been standing there when things started to get a little intense. Their kisses turned heated and hands were starting to wander, so Dean pulled back from Cas who chased him with his lips, and was disappointed when Dean pulled back even further. “Cas, wait a second,” Dean laughed at the whine he let out while still trying desperately to get to his lips, “Cas, let's go back to the motel, we can lock Sam out and have a mini honeymoon.”
Cas stared at the note for a second before he added it to his pocket. He then grabbed the bag of mini Twix bars and tossed one into his mouth. The man on the tv who had been shot in the beginning of the episode, Officer Rick if he remembered correctly, was just waking up from his coma, so he decided he’d watch another episode or two after this then he would shower as Dean had reminded him.
He spent a little bit extra time eating the sandwich, savouring it as much as he could, before he was finally finished and now found himself with nothing to do. He tossed his wrapper in the garbage, stood there for a minute, then sighed and slowly wandered through the bunker.
"Well," Cas started smugly, "you always have to be the one to feed him, you always want to hold him, you hate being away from him for any length of time, you buy him gifts all the time. Therefore you are his mommy, I am his father."
Sam turned to answer her question, “At every convention there's a game, a hunt. The hotel or venue puts out clues and gets their staff to play along, and the people who register for the game have to figure out what kind of monster is ‘killing’ the guests, and how to kill it. The winners usually get a gift card or something.”
Jack hesitated for a moment, looking between Cas and Dean, the entire family watching with bated breath and waiting for his answer. “Okay…” He nodded slowly to Dean, who smiled wide, “But you have to promise that I can call Daddy.”
The sea below crashed against the cliffside, forcing droplets of water up and over the top, splashing Dean as he reached the entrance to the small, scraggly shack and walked in. He pulled back the furs that covered the entrance and slowly made his way inside. It was dark, damp, and smelled of the sea water that seeped through the cracks of the shack with every crashing wave coming from below.
"Well, look at us, gushing over our stars," Metatron laughed, "we should just let you see for yourselves the pure, raw chemistry and talent that we have discovered here. Allow us to let Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak steal your hearts as they have ours."
“If you don't dance at this studio then why are you here and how did you get in?” He asked with a little more force this time.
“Um… can I help you?” he asked, unsure of exactly who he was talking to behind the bouquet of lilies.
They were about halfway back to the bunker, no one had said a word since they left the forest. Sam was in the back staring out the window as the darkness of the night blurred past him, and Cas was sitting quietly in the front seat, staring down at the baby deer who had finally settled into his lap.
Dean stared at him for a moment before giving him a nod, and watched Cas turn and kneel beside the baby deer.
She nodded, pursing her lips before adding, “He should. It might be good for you to see him for a while.”
The hunter grabbed Sam by the shirt, pulling him to the side and into the light by the window. The light shone down on Sam’s face as the hunter stared at him. “Sam… oh my god, Sam.”
Sam had managed to remain quiet and unseen for the entire little ceremony. It was perfectly Dean and Cas, a secret wedding, just the two of them. And even though Sam wasn't supposed to be there, he was honoured that he was able to bear witness to the most perfect wedding he had ever seen.
“She was, and I miss her every day, but I know she watches over Jack,” he smiled, then asked, “does Adam know about his parents?”
“I… I can’t dance in front of people, Cas! Are you insane?!” He shook his head, breathless with nerves. “I’m a closeted dancer, not even my own mother or brother know that I dance! And now you not only want me to dance in front of the people in my own town, but then also travel around with you and dance in front of people nationwide?!”
“No,” he pulled back from Chuck's outstretched hand again as much as he could, “no, you selfish son of a bitch, I don't wanna go back! I want to stay here so Sam can be happy and alive down there. Switch us!”
The ballet had everything, Sam thought as his eyes opened impossibly wider with each passing act. Crazy fights, ups, downs, emotions, romance, devastation, and love. And all too soon for him, and everyone else watching, it was too quickly coming to an end.
John smiled down at Dean then gave his shoulder a pat, “Now, you two get up into bed. He's got a hard few days ahead.”
Dean woke with a shattering start on the temple floor. His body was covered in a cold sweat, his breathing ragged as he pushed himself up on his elbows. He sucked in shattered breaths and rolled to lean to one side as he tried to catch his breath and thought of what he had seen. What a vision the Gods had shown him, it was definitely a brighter future for his people, but was he really willing to uproot everyone? To take everyone away from everything they've ever known in Nazareth and plant them in a new and uncertain land? But if the Gods had shown him, then how could it go wrong?
Sera sighed, then turned away and headed towards Natasha, placing a hand on her shoulder. “Sorry, Natasha, but I have to take your laptop for a few days.”
“They were working a case in the same town as another convention a few years back,” then he turned to Sam and Dean with a smile, “it's nice to see you again… agents.”
So he nodded to himself, trying in a way to convince himself it was okay, then scrubbed a hand down his face as he looked up to her, "It, uh… it happened right after he allowed himself to be truly happy."
He watched as the Nutcracker Prince and Charles came together for their final dance, and he had to admit that he was slightly jealous at the way Dean and the Nutcracker were looking at each other. But he was oh so happy for his brother, he was finally truly happy.
"No he wouldn't," she said softly and shook her head, "but that doesn't matter anymore, Dean, this is your time to be you, and I wish you would have told me sooner rather than suppressing this obvious passion. I want you to be happy, Dean, and if ballet is it for you then that is perfectly fine! Just be you, please, Honey.”
He looked Cas over once, noticed the claw marks on the arm Cas was holding against his chest where the wolf had nicked him, then sighed and said, “Alright, let's head back, get that looked after.”
"Your happiness?! What about Sam's happiness?!" He nearly screamed, "After everything he's done for you, you're just going to let him die?!"
He grabbed the fabric softener then took a moment to sit on his bed, rehearsals lately had been taking a lot out of him. As it got closer and closer to opening night, rehearsals got more and more intense. He placed the bottle on his nightstand and before he knew it, he was laying back on the bed. Just a minute, he thought, then he would get up and do his laundry. Then his eyes were closing and he decided he would let them, just rest them for a few seconds then he would get up. But before he could even stop himself he was passed out with his legs hanging over the edge of his bed, laundry completely forgotten.
Cas merely rolled his eyes and in his regularly calm voice answered, "I wasn't the one who confused the steps, Ruby. You should be at least a foot ahead of me, you're too close, which is why you keep stumbling."
When they walked in, there was another room just as big as the last, completely filled with vendors, and Sera ran right over to the first booth.
“It's not you,” Cas gurnted, still trying to move, “he's just… this is my fault. I coddled him too much and now he won’t even so much as look at anyone who isn't me, my father, or my brothers.”
Gabriel was the one to freak out this time, practically squealing, “Aren't you glad we told you to give him a chance!”
And the baby was making great progress too. With Amelia's advice and helpful tips, Gunner was doing well and his leg was healing quickly. Everything was going well, until they hit a small snag shortly after.
“It was a normal day,” he shrugged around a bite of his second tart, “but I did get asked out today at the park while I was getting lunch.”
“Yeah,” he stepped forwards with a shrug, “there's more than enough room, we have all these resources here to help with our hunts, we'd all be together, and it's much better than never knowing where you're gunna be sleeping next. It's also protected and warded, safe.”
“I am! I know this will bode well for us and our people, I have seen it in my dreams and I can feel it in my bones.”
"I would actually love to come and watch!" He nodded enthusiastically, "It's been so long since I've been to the theater to see a performance, and I would love to see you in action with actual professionals."
She turned away from him for a moment and then pushed off from where she was leaning against the wall. Without a word she made her way back up to the second floor with the boys on her heels, both curious but neither voicing it, and followed her up.
She turned away from Dean, looking around the bunker once more, “If… if I stay and you hurt me again, either of you,” she turned back to face them both, “I’ll kick your asses.”
"I will," he pulled the blankets up to his shoulders and rolled over towards where the phone rested beside him on the bed, "I love you, Cas."
Dean gave her a look then lifted the book in her hands to see the cover, “What are you reading? It doesn't look like a lore book-”
“Hey, buddy, it's okay. One step at a time,” Cas smiled down at Dean, “but maybe daddy can lift you up then.”
He grabbed one with the most icing he could find, and shoved nearly the entire thing in his mouth and asked between bites, “Was everything alright here today?”
With the water settled in the nest of his hands he sat back on his heels again, tilted his head, and held the water above his face. He whispered once more, hoping as hard as he could that the Gods would hear him, "Show me the way," and let the water trickle out between his hands and land on his face.
“That is actually very impressive, Dean! Ballet is not an easy thing to learn, and teaching yourself is quite a feat.”
He moved around Dean and lead her to the other booths as Sam and Dean followed, much to Dean’s disapproval.
Dean took a glance over at the two beside him and reached a hand over to give the baby a little scratch on the head with a smile. “Baby needs a name, Cas.”
After saying a quick good night to the rest of the guys, Dean grabbed his shoes and headed out the door with ash at his side. They stood beside the impala for a moment, chatting about the new food items Ash’s mom was planning on adding to the menu at the Roadhouse, when a noise to Dean’s left had him turning his head.
They both looked over to a gruff, brooding man helping to load the boats. More like ordering other people to do it while he watched from the docks. He looked back to Ellen who was watching the man with a fond smile. “I promise I will take very good care of him, and bring him back safely.” She turned to him to barely smile back, give his arm a pat, then leave. He then turned back to the man and shouted, “Bobby! Are we ready to set out?”
"This could be a sign," he looked up and took another step towards Dean, "a sign that it is time to move on, seek out other options.".
Dean just shook his head, thinking back. He wasn't sure if he should tell her, hell he wasn't even sure if he was ready to say it out loud himself. But he figured who better to bear it all to then Jody, a woman who had basically been his mom for years now.
Dean put the car in park and they sat there for what felt like an eternity, just staring into the forest in front of them, before Dean gave Cas's hand a squeeze.
They all turned to a room tucked in a hidden corner by the emergency exit, the door was slightly open, but none of them had seen it the last time. Dean and Sera shook their heads and the three of them slowly crept inside.
Cas stood and turned fully towards Dean. He was on one knee, a small box held up in his left hand, “Cas,” he started, soft and slow while Cas made shuffling steps towards him, “I've loved you for a long time, so long, and thanks to this guy right here we were finally able to be together. We've been through so much, pulling my sorry ass out of hell, your fall, purgatory, and everytime we always end up coming back to one another. And this past year and a half with you, with you and I finally being together, has been the best time of my life, I am finally happy.”
Cas walked over with a matching smile to Dean’s and took both his hands in his own. He didn't say anything, he didn't need to, neither of them did. So instead he just lifted Dean's hands to his mouth, placed a gentle kiss on the knuckles of each hand, and then moved back to get in his place. The whole time the two of them never took their eyes off one another, even as the orchestra started playing their final dance.
“You're real agents?” The man asked with raised brows, and the three nodded just as confused as he seemed to be. “My apologies agents, I just assumed you were attending tomorrow's convention.”
Dean took another step closer to Cas, laying his head gently on his as he asked, “So, do you want to marry me, Cas?”
“So what was this guys name?” Sera asked as they got out of the car, all dressed in their suits, fake badges in hand.
Gunner then walked around Cas and bumped his full body into Dean, nearly knocking him over with a laugh. “Gunner’s on board, now it's up to you, Cas. What'd ya say”
He slowly walked further into the living room to where Gunner's crate was beside the couch, and had to stifle a laugh at what he found. He stood there and just watched for a few moments, enjoying himself, then gave the foot that was sticking out of the crate a little tap with his own and asked, "Cas, what are you doing inside Gunner's crate?"
“Alright,” Dean placed his hands on his shoulders to calm him down, “he couldn’t have gone far, where did you last see him?”
The whole room went dead silent at the sound of not only Jack's voice, but Jack’s voice calling Dean’s name. He could have called anyone in the room, but he chose Dean. And everyone was now watching the two of them with wide eyes, including Castiel who had turned around in complete disbelief at the situation.
"Good. Take off your pants and boxers." He reached down and undid his pants, sliding them down so he could rub his cock through his boxers while he waited for Cas's reply.
From backstage Dean could hear everyone cheering, clapping louder than before, and the undeniable Sam Winchester whistle and hollar combo, which he had to admit eased his nerves just a bit. And Chuck and Metatron went on.
“Born and raised,” Dean smiled wide, “I can't imagine moving out of Lawrence. When did you guys move here? Before meeting you at the park that day, I had never seen you or your brothers around.”
He waved to the family as Chuck pulled out of the driveway and turned towards where the impala was parked on the road. They slowly drove past Dean's car with a honk and Dean ducked into the car to tell Jack, "Wave bye to daddy." They both waved them off till they were out of sight and then Dean closed Jack's door and got in the car.
“Actually, yes you did, that very night when Sam died.” Chuck scoffed, almost laughed at Dean's confusion. “When you saw Sam die that night, you prayed to ‘whatever being may still be out there’ to save your brother one last time. ‘Take me instead’, you said, and I figured I owed you one. So I did what you asked, I kept Sam alive and brought you here, to Heaven with Jack and all the people you've loved and lost in the past, but none of it's real Dean. Well, Heaven’s real, but Sam’s life on earth isn't, it's all in your head, Sam’s happiness is just a vision.”
“I see you're having fun,” he looked at the bags in her hands, the glasses and hat she was still wearing, and smiled.
A few moments of comfortable silence fell between them as they both focused on their current tasks. As Dean continued feeding the baby he kept an eye on Cas off to the side, quietly reading his book with a slight smile on his lips, so close…
And so, when I found out a buddy of mine was the night janitor here, I made a deal with him. He lets me in after hours when everyone has left for the night so I can use a room upstairs to practice, and I give him something in return. I only do it because if anyone found out that I was in love with ballet, I would be the laughing stock of the town and my family. My dad would have been furious, and I don't even know what my mom and brother would say. Not to mention the fact that I would never be able to afford to take lessons or rent a studio here, not as a mechanic anyways. But this, sneaking in, was the one way I could still dance and keep everyone around me happy, so I could do what I love in peace.”
“I'll ask you to be quiet as we pass through,” the Father whispered to them, “one of our young couples is getting married. We’ll keep to the side and sneak into the back.”
It was Castiel's turn to be confused now, not to mention slightly scared. He was, after all, in a studio in the middle of the night, alone, now faced with a random stranger who apparently had no reason for being there in the first place. “Then… how did you get in here?” He asked as he started taking slow steps back, trying to get to his phone, “And why are you in here?”
Dean got out of his car and walked over to the small building in the centre of the park and got in line. He only waited for a few minutes before it was his turn to order and he was called up to the counter. “Hi, can I have a large pulled pork poutine, cherry pie on the side, and a bottle of coke to go, please.”
They spent the rest of the evening together in the small clearing. Loving and petting Gunner long after the sun had set beyond the trees, and eventually Dean gave Cas's hand a light tug. He knew what it meant.
“But,” he frowned looking down at the ring on his finger, “this ring symbolizes that I am the other half of your bond, you have nothing to symbolize that you are the other half of mine.”
“And were here too, Cassie,” Gabriel motioned between himself and Balthazar, “and Dad, and Gadreel. You know we are always willing to help so that you can date someone, you deserve it.”
When Gunner turned his gaze from Cas and back to Dean, the two of them just shook their heads and admitted defeat.
He slowly turned back, brows furrowed, “I just assumed that you'd tell the owner about me. I mean, I am using the studio for free, which I know I shouldn't be, but-”
“Wait a second,” Sera pushed her way through, “this is Chuck? This is… this is God?” Sam, Dean, and Chuck all nodded to her and she looked him over with a wrinkled nose, “Seriously?”
“I know that's your name,” Carter rolled his eyes, “who are you supposed to be from the books? Are you trying to be Meg? Bella? Lisa?”
When Sam and Dean had finished talking to Amanda, Dean walked over and knelt in front of her to whisper, “Hey, Sam and I are gunna take another look around, just to be damn sure we didn't miss anything. You stay here with them in case anything goes down.”
Dean nodded, “When he got older my parents told him about them. My dad pulled some old pictures from their files at the precinct, and they took Adam to visit their graves. He still goes occasionally, but he was too young to even remember them when they died. We’re they only family Adam has ever known.”
"No catch, no tricks, no deals. I just want to help that's all." Dean didn't even say anything, just stared him down until he rolled his eyes and tossed his head back, "Alright, fine. I'll admit, you're not my favourite people on Earth, but it's painfully boring up here without the Winchesters around to stir up trouble. And I figure I scratch your back…"
Chuck looked over at Dean with a smile, “That's very nice of you, Dean, and much appreciated. It will be soothing to know that Jack is with someone we trust.”
“I know it's been weird without him. Without his goofy antics, his love after a hunt, the bunker is empty without him. I miss him too, babe,” he soothed his hands down Cas’s shoulders, leaning closer, “I was hoping that maybe if we sat here for a bit he’d-”
Amanda came running around the corner then with Natasha on her heels, and she also stopped dead when she saw the scene before her. Sera got up as fast as she could and ushered them back the way they came before Natasha could see anything. “Take Natasha back to the office and lock the door, only let me in, go!”
"Neither did I, honey, but we have to let him go and be in the wild where he belongs. But we do this knowing that we did an amazing job raising him."
“Yeah, but if it’s make up sex you get to call me naughty words and be extra rough,” Dean suggested.
They smiled at each other before Dean turned to his dad who gave him a manly handshake and an enthusiastic pat on the back. Behind them Mary hugged Castiel before gushing over Jack.
At about one pm he received a snapchat from Claire and Kaia wishing them a happy Christmas, with a blushing Claire and an adoring Kaia. It was the cutest thing Dean had ever seen. He immediately text Claire back to remind her to use the dental dams. She didn’t reply.
Dean and Cas got some rest in while Mary kidnapped Jack to play with. And by rest Dean meant sleep, he was shattered after driving to Sioux Falls and back again and just wanted to forget what being behind the wheel felt like. Cas woke him with a dry lipped kiss an hour before dinner so he could shower and turn up fashionably early for quality time with the grandparents. He could hardly contain his excitement.
Claire wouldn’t grow up the way Dean did. Her attraction to Kaia was treated the same way her fleeting interest in boys had been, with plenty of ribbing, support, and STD protection. Dean hadn’t been kidding about the dental dam, even if Claire insisted that they weren’t having sex yet.
“Ha ha, funny,” Dean said, with enough wariness in his voice that Claire thought she made her point, and put her new airpods in, the ones that Dean had gifted her for Christmas because he didn’t-want to-hear-any-more-of-what-Claire-called-‘music’.
Dean didn’t say anything and instead lent forward to play the CD that Jodie had brought him, all the way to Kansas.
“No, it isn’t,” Samuel interrupted. “They aren’t blood. They aren’t family by marriage in most states.”
“Sammy, glad you could make it!” Dean embraced his brother with a chest smacking hug before kissing Eilene on the cheek and signing hello to her.
Dean ached at that. He couldn’t stand Castiel in pain, yet it baffled him when Cas felt the same way. The concept of someone loving him the exact same way he loved them was a lot for Dean to handle and even ten years down the line could shock Dean. So he deflected.
“More than you,” she said with a smile. Dean pulled her into a hug and then pushed her away. “See you in a week.”
“It’s not, Dean. Neither was it your job to look after Sammy growing up while your dad lost his mind over your mom’s health. You grew up too fast, and that burden weighs on you even now.”
Dean wasn’t a fan of the plan, however he knew Jodie would keep an eye on the girls and it wasn’t like Claire would make going to his grandparent’s easier. She was too much like him, wouldn’t shut up about her life to please others, and in that way Dean guessed he and Cas had done a good job in raising her especially considering the uber-conservative Christian background that her mom and dad had come from. Still, having a strong willed daughter was sometimes a blessing and a curse.
“Yeah, can’t imagine why Claire would choose to spend time with people who love and accept her rather than family,” he said with heavy sarcasm on the last word. He shook Cas’s hand off and left the room, taking the bottle with him.
“Yes, I’m sure,” Cas said dryly, his expression carefully blank to prevent Jack from picking up on his barely bottled rage. “Perhaps you shouldn’t say anything else, unless you want to upset everyone this Christmas.”
Dean sent a quick ‘where the hell are you, you better not be smoking’ text to Claire before leaning against the counter and scrubbing a hand over his face. “She mommed me good and proper.”
“Mum, dad… I am of course happy that I’m getting a first grandchild from Sam, but I already have two grandchildren in Jack and Claire.”
“She’s fine,” he shook his head, denial lodging stubbornly in his head. She had to be fine, she was his mom. “She just wanted a change.”
“I love you,” she said, and then accepted a hug from Cas. Dean pretended he couldn’t overhear her making him promise to look after Dean while he was at his grandparents house. He liked to think she didn’t know about the stuff that had been said when she had been first adopted by Dean and Castiel following the death of her parents, but she was a clever kid and he hadn’t always been able to protect her. They were all determined to do better for Jack.
“Home.” Dean said softly into the silence. Castiel was half asleep next to him and Jack was sniffling his way through a cold clogged nose as he dreamed.
“Don’t start-” John did raise his voice, but Dean didn’t stick around to find out if he was going to defend his eldest son or argue just to spite the old man.
“Please, like I’m letting you get on a plane. Those things are death traps. The only thing that should fly are birds and dragons.”
“I’m so happy for you, baby!” Mary hugged Sam, emotion swimming in her eyes. “How far along is she?”
They left most of the stuff in the car, secure in the garage, putting Jack into bed and setting up the baby monitor. Cas dialled up the heating and Dean checked the locks before falling into his husband’s embrace.
“Thought you were still asleep. Was going to wake you with something better than coffee, but here,” Dean accepted the warm mug.
“I know. I just mean… I expected dad to disown me, you know, and when he didn’t I felt like I had to do everything I could to make them love me, including putting up with Samuel.”
“Dean,” Cas growled in his gravelly ‘I’m serious now’ tone, “It’s five am, and in two hours I have to get up and shower so we are going to sleep, and you are going to call your mother tomorrow. We can argue after dinner.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean asked angrily, standing up. Cas put a gentling hand on his partner’s arm but sent Samuel a foul look of his own.
“Cas, we gotta get on the road!” They were taking a road trip, six hours to Sioux Falls, staying the night at Jodie’s, then just less than that to get to their grandparents farmhouse. Dean couldn’t have planned it better, he’ll be exhausted when he gets there, the perfect excuse to not be polite and graceful. Hopefully he can get away with sleeping through the most agonising parts of the day and drinking the rest. Best plan ever.
“Well you can’t stay alone for Christmas. I’ve seen that movie and no way is that happening on my watch!” Dean said.
This was what Christmas should be, Dean thought, as he sat next to Castiel inhaling turkey, mac n cheese, gravy, and potatoes while he pushed anything green or orange to the side. Jodie, Alex, Claire, Kaia… they all laughed openly, loved just the same and fought as well. Nothing was hidden for the sake of family, as if blood was more important than love and acceptance. Dean had grown up under his dad’s imposing thumb, believing there was something wrong with him because he wanted to sleep with men just as much as women. Nothing explicit was ever said, but when John caught Dean flirting with a bag packing boy at the Piggy Wiggly his dad started asking more and more about girls and how Dean should find himself a ‘nice girlfriend’ to keep his wondering eyes busy. When Dean had fallen in love with Castiel and finally come out to his parents they’d both been shocked. Dean had felt a little betrayed; it wasn’t like on television where the mom said ‘I know, I’ve always known’ and hugged him, she looked genuinely surprised as if it had never crossed her mind. John had obviously decided that if he discouraged Dean enough then he’d tow the heterosexual line, and it worked for a while with Dean too scared of his dad’s disapproval to even smile at a guy, but when he’d moved out and met Castiel… some things were more important than fear and Cas was one of them. Besides, John and Mary had mostly accepted Castiel even if sometimes he sensed some discomfort. It was one of the reasons Dean kept his distance and rarely traversed the four hours between their towns to visit his parents, and usually only when Sammy was home.
“I’m saying Claire is with people who love and accept her this holiday season,” he said with an ugly smile and a tip of his glass before he swallowed the rest of the amber liquid down.
“Well, that’s why I don’t let Cas drive,” Dean winked at her, having managed to sign ‘no’, ‘drive’ and point as Castiel who was now frowning at his husband.
Dean signed, “my dad. If it wasn’t for him me and Sam would have starved growing up. Well, him and the Piggly Wiggly. I inherited my skills from my mom.”
“Oh please, Jonathan, it’s not like you support Dean’s life choices any more than we do,” Samuel said.
“Uh huh. You mean Jodie, Alex and Kaia your girlfriend? Is that where you were hoping to go?” Dean asked, eyebrows raised.
“Okay, well text her. She’s sixteen, Cas, not a baby. Don’t breathe down her neck or she’ll bite your head off.”
“Well, what you are calling love isn’t exactly what the Lord would call love, is it?” Samuel responded.
The vibration of an incoming text cut the tension in the air. Dean glanced down and saw a reply from Claire;
“And I love you. They are my parents and it would mean the world to me if you and Castiel were here with us for Christmas.”
Claire put her food down, a sure sign that something serious was going on with her, and bit at her lip before confessing, “I was hoping to go stay with Jodie and… and Alex, you know. Girl time.”
“Mary, Dean really would be better off getting some fresh air. I’m sure he’ll join us later,” Castiel, his beloved peacekeeping husband, reassured his mom and Dean slipped out on to the porch, breathing deep like a therapist he’d seen only once had told him to do. Dean had had a panic attack after kissing Castiel in front of an elderly couple who then condemned him and told them they were headed for Hell. It hadn’t been so much that people had seen them be openly affectionate that had freaked him out, more that Castiel believed in God, and been raised a good Christian boy, and Dean hated to think that by choosing Dean Castiel was sacrificing something pure like heaven or even the possibility of it. Dean had convinced himself he was unworthy. The therapist tried to help, but Dean hadn’t felt comfortable opening up to a stranger and talking about his feelings. The only thing that he had taken away from the session was the breathing exercises that he had a feeling he would be using excessively during the next forty eight hours.
“Let’s get this day started. I’m taking a shower, you want to join and wake me up like you planned to?” Dean said with a lascivious once over of Cas stood in the kitchen bare footed in a navy blue dressing gown and blue and white pinstriped pyjamas that had been gifted to him by his mom last year despite the fact Cas slept naked as the day he was born.
The next morning was for goodbyes. Dean avoided Samuel by being busy with every other family member whenever Samuel was free. Sam gave him a dutiful hand shake but said very little and Eileen refused to look in his direction which made it impossible for him to even attempt to communicate with her. Eileen did give Dean a long, hard hug and promised to look after herself and the baby who was going to be Dean’s nephew, although don’t tell Sam because he wanted a surprise. Dean promised and kissed her on the cheek before moving on to his mom.
The journey was uneventful, and Dean stopped for gas and lunch at 2:30pm somewhere that had a park for Jack to run around in. When it came time for Castiel to drive them Dean suggested that Cas sit with Jack and try to keep him awake while Claire and Dean sat up front so he could talk to her about her upcoming driver’s ed. Castiel saw nothing of this and did so, with both Claire and Dean breathing a sigh of relief. They arrived at Jodie’s by six pm, with hugs and dinner waiting for them. Jack of course was asleep by this point, Cas had only had mild success with his mission, so they put him up in the travel cot Jodie had set up in Patience’s room since she was visiting her dad.
Dean was self-sufficient with food and could grill a steak or make a few classic favourites like burgers or meatballs but he wasn’t one for extended periods of time in the kitchen, often forgetting he’d left something on and burning it or half cooking the vegetables because he wasn’t going to eat them anyway so didn’t bother taste testing them before serving. Claire had taken after Dean in her choices of food and would push a piece of broccoli around for an hour rather than put it in her mouth. They were lucky that both of them had good genes and enjoyed activities like kick-boxing, swimming and the kind of obstacle courses with inflatable boulders and eight feet rope fences. Castiel cooked the way he drove, to the letter of the law or in this case to the gram of the recipe, and it either ended in tears or success and there was no way to anticipate either outcome. Cas still didn’t understand how he could go wrong while following a recipe, but his cousin Gabriel had assured him that cooking was an art and not a science and that made all the difference. Gabriel cooked with his heart and made a damned good living out of it, however the only thing Castiel did with his heart was love Dean and their family with every beat.
Dean was tucked up with Castiel, his mind chaos. He hadn’t drank enough to pass out and wasn’t sober enough to muddle through the day. He knew his husband was long away from sleep as well from the tension in his body and the uneven breaths that brushed against Dean’s hair.
“Well, to be fair Jodie fostered Claire while we sorted out legalities, so I guess Jodie is her foster mom too,” Dean defended their decision.
“Good drive?” Castiel signed and spoke out loud. Castiel had once taught bible studies to deaf children and was proficient at ASL whereas Dean only knew a few phrases. Eileen had been dating Sam for nearly two years, but they mostly communicated via text and video call due to the 25 hour drive between their homes.
“Sure,” he agreed, and kissed his grandson hello. “I’m your pumpa and don’t let anyone tell you different, kid.”
“Promise me next year we’ll go to Sammy’s to see the baby and we’ll stick to just people who love us unconditionally.”
“So you’re saying that Kaia is her foster sister? Claire is dating her foster sister?” Samuel asked incredulously, with derision dripping from his tongue. Dean sent him a hard look.
“Make-up sex is so good though,” Dean said, even while he glowed at the point Castiel was making. They had believed that a letter from his grandparents would put them at each other’s throats, but really it only reminded them that the true meaning of family was to be there for each other no matter what, even if you didn’t agree, even if all you wanted to do was protect the person you loved from bad choices that would inevitably hurt them.
“Sure, play the mom card,” Dean said but sighed. “Let me talk to Cas.” Dean hung up the phone with the knowledge that he had caved with almost no effort at all. Damn. He should have just RSVP’d ‘no way in Hell and I mean it’ and dealt with the fall out.
“No, but she’s sixteen. When Sammy was sixteen he was a nightmare, and the more Dad put on him the more he rebelled. I don’t want her to think we don’t trust her.”
Eileen thwacked him in the abs. “I’m pregnant,” she said, signing along with her words. “We are having a baby.”
“You’re so big now!” She said as she picked him up out of his booster seat and held him close. “Do you remember me?”
They exchanged gifts, Jodie got him a Metallica compilation, some expensive beers, and a pair of gloves. Cas got gloves as well, a book about recycling and a basket of organic foods. Jodie would drive Claire back in time for the New Year, not put her on a plane, drive, Dean made sure that distinction was clear.
Claire arrived back to find the house locked up and had to call on her cell to get them to open up as she had left her key at home. When she saw the rumpled state of her parents she rolled her eyes and told them they were too old for daylight quickies. Castiel and Claire got into an argument about ‘honesty’ and where she was, while Dean prepped homemade burgers for dinner, it was one of the only things he could cook and coincidentally his favourite thing to eat. Eventually the subject of Christmas came up.
Mary glanced at her son with amusement. “I brought you some pie from the store for afters. It’s in the kitchenette of the barn house so you don’t even have to share.”
“Yeah. Safe for you. You drive like a grandma, gives everyone else road rage. That’s who I’m worried about.”
“No, I did not. The children of the neighbour I was helping broke into their candy supply and ate a rather large amount of sugared treats before I discovered them.”
“They are my family,” Mary insisted. “By choice, if not legality and blood. And that’s more important, dad. Stop being so close minded before Dean chooses not to be your family any more, because I’m done playing mediator.” Mary said, shocking everyone.
Christmas night and almost everyone of them went to bed angry or bitter, perhaps apart from those too drunk to do anything other than pass out, and of course Jack who was too young to really understand the words and tension flying around the room.
“No, no, Dean. I’m fine. The cancer hasn’t come back. I genuinely wanted a change. I’m fifty six years old, Dean, and my hair is gray under all this blonde dye. I want to grow old gracefully, and I’m okay with that. I’m not ill, promise.”
Dean woke Christmas morning to the smell of coffee and an urge to hide under the bed like a scared five year old. Instead he checked his phone, messaged Claire a ‘Merry Christmas’ and got up to find his son. Jack was awake in the travel cot and from the amount of toys in with him it was obvious that Castiel had been up with Jack for a while.
“It means they get to insult me while you excuse them and dad take his aggression out on the car. They’ve never even met Jack and I’d rather not expose him to their hostility.”
That night Dean and Castiel settled into the converted barn house apartment a good two hundred feet away from the large farmhouse his grandparents lived in. Most of the year round this was where his cousins bunked down for early morning shifts on the farm, however they spent Christmas in their own homes with their wives and children. However, as such, the barn house was little more than a kitchenette with microwave, coffee machine and fridge, a shower cubicle, a toilet and three small bedrooms with single beds that were cheaply made and resembled cots more than actual beds. After this ‘holiday’ Dean was sure Castiel would have a bad back again. He assumed they had been given these rooms in order to prevent them from sleeping together, however Dean hadn’t slept without Castiel in nearly ten years and wasn’t about to let a narrow bed and an even more narrow minded man stop them from being close.
“This is the first Christmas in eight years that you’ve been away for,” Dean attempted to vocalised his feelings, something Castiel had encouraged him to do when they decided to adopt Claire.
Jody lifted her hand and squeezed his shoulder, urging him forwards. He nodded and walked closer to Sam with Jody by his side, and after making sure the babies were at a very safe distance from the pire, he pulled his lighter out of his pocket. He shifted it from hand to hand for a moment, staring at the dirt, trying to find the right words to say.
“Doesn't hurt to stop by. Wait…” She touched the mouse pad, scrolling before looking back up to Sam. “This is Henderson Castle, it's one of the most haunted places in America, supposedly. People who have stayed here before have reported the feeling of being touched, radios and phones going haywire, seeing things, but none of it's ever been proven before and no ones ever been killed. So why all of a sudden is this happening? Are you sure it's not just some crazy human?”
“Why should I,” she held her ground squaring her shoulders, “you didn't give me the same courtesy, so why shouldn't I just leave?”
Cas found himself smiling again when Dean held out his arm for Cas to take and led him down the porch steps and to his car.
Cas didn't know how to respond, feeling a sudden hole in his chest at the tears welling in Jack's eyes, so Dean stepped in, “It's okay, buddy, we’ll have so much fun! You and me get to spend a whole weekend together doing super fun things! Me, you, Mama Mary and Papa John have a great weekend planned! There's gonna be a barbeque with my whole family, you'll get to meet my little brothers, we're gunna go to some festivals, we can have movie nights, and I promise that whenever you want to you can call your dad. You just ask me and I'll dial him up, okay? How does that sound?”
The episode he was watching was almost over, so he decided to wait for it to finish before he turned the tv off, but his newly human body had other plans. He felt himself slowly tipping to the side, falling, his eyes closing, and he ended up landing his head on the throw pillow. But a little crinkle on the side of his face woke him up enough to sit up and grab the sticky note that was now stuck to his face.
Dean nodded in thanks and hiked his duffle back over his shoulder, and headed up the stairs. He made his way to studio nine and walked into the mirrored room, dropping his duffle and connected his phone to the bluetooth speakers. He put on some light music and did a few quick stretches before looking at the clock. It was just about midnight, which meant that he had around three hours to practice before he had to be home. So without wasting any more time he got into position, pointed his toes, pushed play, and began his practice of the first dance of the Nutcracker Ballet.
"Bye bye, daddy, I'll miss you," he leaned over towards Cas and gave him a tight hug before reluctantly leaning back into Dean.
They drove in silence, Dean holding Cas's hand the whole way, until they were pulling off the road to the familiar forest edge where they had been just a year before.
“She did it,” Sera muttered, “she killed her next victim, she didn't have to stick around to fight us. That's why she left. Bobby was right, this is our kind of job.”
"Yes, there are far too many questions left unanswered to wait any longer," Dean patted his cheek and touched their foreheads together, "I will have your answer before we dine tomorrow, then I shall tell everyone what decision has been made."
"Then what, Metatron, what do we do? Start auditioning again? Call back the people we rejected the first time? I’m sure they’ll love that!"
“You were sound asleep, and after everything that happened yesterday I thought you could use the rest.”
“His name is Jack, he’s three, as you know, but,” Cas leaned in on the table as well, “Jack is not my biological son.”
“Hey give that back!” She shouted from the bed as Dean left the room, “I still have two more chapters to read!”
He looked down the hallway towards Cas’s room, but the door was closed. All he could do was hope that his little hunches were right, and that when he opened this door he would find Cas on the other side.
Dean tried to pull himself together a little bit, to calm down so he didn’t wake Cas. He was still recovering from losing his grace and needed as much rest as he could get. So he quietly slipped inside and closed the door as softly as he could.
“Who's your favourite couple?” She moved her hands over the table as she explained, “We have the most popular ship being destiel, which is Dean and Cas.”
“It's been so damn long since we’ve had a kid in the house, and to be quite honest your mother and I were beginning to wonder if we would ever have grandchildren!” John’s eyes lit up like it was christmas. “This will be great! And we’ve both been dying to meet Jack.”
He pulled the blankets over him and snuggled into the pillow. Dean, it was all Dean, it all smelled like Dean, it was comfort and home. God, he missed Dean.
"And I love you, Dean," he said as he leaned in, pressing his lips to Dean's in an almost kiss, "I am so very glad that you snuck into that dance studio and watched me dancing like a creeper."
“Yes,” he smiled down at the baby in Dean's lap who was now starting to fall asleep, “Gunner Robert Winchester.”
“First of all, I do the conventions because they’re fun, and it's nice to have people worship me for reasons other than the obvious,” he pushed Dean and Sam off and gestured to himself, “and second, no, I did not kill anyone just to bring attention to the event. I'm not insane.”
It took him a few tries, but eventually he had both babies clipped in and he was pushing the stroller towards the back of the house. The pire he had already set up before going to Jody was still there, Sam wrapped in a white sheet in the center. He stopped for a moment, not really able to move or breathe as he just stared at Sam. This wasn't what he wanted, this was never what he wanted, he had what he wanted and it turned out to be a stupid fake reality. Everything was falling apart at the seams.
The hunt ended bloody, but successfully. Dean, Sam and Cas were now stood in the middle of the forest, all three covered in both their own blood and the blood of the werewolf they had just killed, trying to catch their breaths.
“Oh...wow, I…” He stuttered, not really knowing what to say. Not to mention that his heart was now down in his feet at the mere thought of even humouring telling his mom and brother about the show. Was it naive to think that he could just keep it a secret forever?
And just before the other dancers joined them on stage for a bow, Cas couldn't resist doing what he had been wanting to do for so long. Both of them panting, gazing deeply at each other, Dean's pure blissful smile that he knew was only there for him, and Cas knew what would make the perfect ending to this night. So he pulled lightly on Dean's hand in his and he bounced forwards into Castiel's arms. And right there, in front of everyone in the audience, Cas dipped Dean backwards and finally, finally kissed Dean.
"Oh, Cas…" Dean moaned, arching his back as he rubbed a little harder, lifting up to grind into his palm. He quickly freed himself from his last piece of clothing, tossing his boxers somewhere to the side of the room, then grabbed his phone again.
Dean just shook his head and closed his eyes, the sobs coming back a little harder now. Mary reached over the table and managed to get ahold of one of his to squeeze it comfortingly. "Tell Sam, it's okay."
Jody Mills tapped the wooden spoon in her hand on the side of the pot, splattering her famous spaghetti sauce all over the white of her stove top. The doorbell rang again, followed by a persistent knocking as she scowled into the pot of sauce, angrily dropping the spoon into the empty sauce can beside her. She swiped her half full wine glass off the counter as the knocking and ringing continued, and she stormed towards the door wondering who would have the gaul to be so arrogant on a Sunday afternoon.
“Destiny?” The hope died out once again and Dean was left with confusion, “What do they mean by that?”
“Yeah, Cas, I’ll call you if anything else comes up, maybe…” Dean scratched his head, “Maybe you can stop by the motel once we figure some things out?”
""Ok," Cas nodded and counted things off on his fingers as he continued, "you know his favourite foods, he won't sleep without the blue Scooby-Doo blanket at night so don't lose it, he gets fussy when he's hungry so-"
With a few small steps he turned the only corner in the shack and entered another small room, a figure sat perched on a pile of furs in the center.
“Yeah, she should be here in a minute. I met her this morning at the police station, she works reception there.”
Cas took a few more deep breaths, floored that everything he was worried about had already been taken care of, and the fact that Dean made sure Jack was okay and taken care of meant the world to him. “Thank you, Dean.”
He nodded, “Hopefully everything goes as I plan, but that’s all up in the air. It could go completely sideways.”
Dean cleared his throat, getting Cas's attention slightly as Gunner was still pressing into him. He turned slightly towards Dean and stilled his hands on the buck. “Since the family’s all together again, I thought this might be the best time.”
"Have you heard from him, Castiel?" Cas just shook his head at a worried Chuck from center stage, "Has anyone heard from Dean?!"
Dean just huffed out his annoyance at his brother, then decided that if Sam wasn't gunna move then he'd just have to go around him. So that's exactly what he did.
For the next week Dean showed up at Castiel’s house everyday like clockwork. Same time, four pm, with a fresh bouquet of flowers and the same proposition of getting to know one another. And everyday dean got the same answer, a firm no with the door shut in his face. Yet, he returned everyday without fail, until finally Cas decided that perhaps it was time to let the truth come out and maybe that would stop Dean from his persistent acts of desperation.
Dean's eyes finally focused back, staring Chuck down as he made his best attempt to lunge at him despite the spell, “You son of a bitch! What did you do to me?!”
But of course Sam didn't answer, didn't move, then Dean had a thought. "Jack! Jack, I need your help! Please!"
“I had gone up to the second floor earlier that morning to grab some files, but for the rest of the day I was using the office behind the desk downstairs, and there was nothing out of the ordinary. Just a regular day.” She then looked over to the girl. “Natasha’s father disappeared when she was two and so most afternoons she's here with me, doing her homework because I have no one else to watch her. She loves this place, but after what happened I don't know if I can continue running it, and I don't want her to know anything about it. I’m happy to help you agents, but I don't want her to know about Jerry’s death.”
