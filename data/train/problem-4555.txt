Cas moves in closer, “I think I can think of a way to make her jealous.” Cas glances down at Dean’s champagne soaked lips.
In all his beautiful blue-eyed glory is Cas hovering over him. Dean blinks sleepily, convinced he’s still dreaming. “Cas?”
Their date goes amazing and Dean does in fact get Cas’ number at the end of the night.  Along with a goodnight kiss.
Cas laughs, “Why is it up to me to be the sugar daddy?”
He and Cas talk until Sam kicks them both out two hours later for their actual date.
But he’s never been so tired that he’s topped off his coffee with an energy drink.
All of his senses are drowning in Cas.
“I would blur out our faces.”
“Cas, these apartments don’t allow pets.” They moved.
“Castiel Novak, I knew I loved you since before I met you. I’ve never believed in love until I began loving an angel. I love you with all that I am and I want to spend the rest of my life by your side as one.” Dean takes a steadying breath. “Will you marry me?”
He looks into Dean’s eyes, hoping his husband understands that he means every word.
“Cas?”
They trade kisses and declarations of love until exhaustion begins to set in. Dean drives them to the nearest hotel where they order room service and make promises of tomorrow. They fall asleep in each other's arms, while promises of tomorrow and the eventually of forever hang in the air.
Dean turns around and is greeted by Sam and Ruby’s beautiful and nerdy neighbor briskly making his way over.
They talk for hours. Talk through the small problems and the big ones. They agree to go to marriage counseling, something Dean was initially against. Cas promises to work less once he comes back from leave, but until then he’s going to use the time to do all he can to get them to a better place. He reveals that he got too caught up in the money and the status of it all and Dean promises to take more of an interest in his job and to keep him humble.
Dean rolls his eyes, his time is running out, Dean needs to take matters into his own hands.
“I swear to God, Cas.” Dean threatens.
“I couldn’t do it,” Cas whispers. “I couldn’t marry him.”
“I’m waiting for my skates! They’re out for delivery.” Dean explains.
Cas rolls his eyes, and holds out a hand for Dean to hold.
Dean rolls his eyes. If he didn’t wait up for him, Dean would probably never see his husband. Cas comes home late and leaves for work early.
Dean tries. “Cas,” he says softly.
The band is saying their last “thank-yous” of the night to the crowd at The Roadhouse when Dean interrupts, much to the surprise of everyone, and he announces that he has one more song he’d like to sing. The band stares at him confused but moves off to the side of the stage when Dean shoos them away.
Dean sighs frustrated, “That’s not the point Cas. I just want to know if my life was on the line you would go all John Wick on someone.”
Cas feels like home.
They both turn to Cas waiting for his answer. “You’re right and Dean is wrong,” he says monotone.
Cut to the interior of the 1967 Chevy Impala. Dean is driving, Castiel is riding shotgun. A faint sound of country music is heard in the distance.
The impala stops in front of an abandoned warehouse.
"Do you hear that?" Dean asks.
"Relax, Sammy." Dean started. "I already injected myself with some of the vaccine ahead of time. Cas analyzed the ingredients and made me another vial."
He freezes when he sees a man in a trenchcoat.
“That’s okay, Cas.” Dean repeats.
“If you want.”
“No you did. The bet was to get his number within 30 minutes. Which you didn’t do. So…”
They’re each other's soul mates. He took Cas at his word when he said he loved him but clearly that wasn’t the truth.
“Dean-” Cas begins.
“Yup.”
What if it’s all a dream and he’s going to wake up cold, alone, and incomplete?
Dean sings his part, going through the motions. Just a bridge of lyrics until Cas is center stage again entrancing the world with his guitar solo and finishing off the song with another run-through of the chorus.
Dean’s innocent work crush of the past two and a half years. He’s smart, gorgeous, caring, and has a wicked sense of humor.
Dean doubts there's anything missing. Not that it’s out of the realm of possibilities, but Cas is notoriously bad at putting things together.
“Thank you and your problems aren’t dumb.”
Looking back, he can’t really pinpoint the exact moment their relationship shifted into something more. It’s something that happened gradually. In between the hellos and goodbyes, the random road trips, the late night confessions, and the early morning whispers. Over the years of friendships that eventually twisted and turned into something deeper.
The last three hours they have spent together have been some of the best three horse Cas has ever experienced.
“I do.” Cas answers before their lips meet.
“Oh, so you didn’t always…” she lets herself trail off.
I know it’s not in the coupon book, but any time you wanna use those bad boys just lemme know. I’ll do it, free of charge.”
Even though Cas and him aren’t a thing, he still likes to dress to impress.
“Well for what it’s worth, you look very happy with him Dean,” Andrea says.
“As long as you whip me up your blueberry pie, I’ll buy you whatever you need, oh great chef.”
He smiles in Cas’ direction, remembering how he felt when he first met his blue-eyed love.
He made sure to do that this year before he flew across the country for work, but it’s still not the same. Without Cas there’s no Christmas magic. It’s another day, just with twinkling lights.
He’s drunk. He’s high. He’s miserable.
Cas is in a playful mood tonight. Dean usually loves it because moods like this are so few and far in between for his husband. His job as a corporate exec demands a lot out of him, so when he comes home he usually wants to eat, sleep, and maybe have sex.
“You know they can be delivered anytime between now and like 7pm. And it’s like barely,” Sam glances down at his watch, “1pm now.”
Dean throws his hands up in frustration, “so you’d just let me die? That’s great. That’s just fine. Fuck me I guess. I can really feel the love from my husband,” Dean grumbles as he stands to walk out of the room.
“Was she right?” Cas he moves into Dean’s space.
Closer to forever.
“Not really no.”
Dean quickly stops by the kitchen to make himself a sandwich, grab some chips and a beer before settling back into his spot on the couch. He’s half-way through his sandwich when he checks the tracking and realizes that his skates have been delivered.
“Of course. And I told you Tessa’s a beast in the courtroom.”
Cas fell in love with Milano the moment he met him. He knew he was taking him home. Damn what his boyfriend says, they were adopting a dog.
Dean reaches out for Cas at the same time Cas reaches out for him. Cas’ hand closes around Dean’s and then they’re running.
Cas smiles at Dean’s promise of forever. “I’ll remember.”
“So you really don’t like the ring?”
He searches the area around the mailbox before moving onto the rest of the front yard. He’s about to give up and call UPS when he hears someone from across the street trying to get his attention.
“You hid it in your sock drawer. I’m always stealing a pair of socks from you. Hell, you didn’t even try and hide it in a pair, you just tossed it in there. It’s like you wanted me to find it.”’
It’s a pattern he’s familiar with. He gets intoxicated enough to dull the pain of not being with Dean, then finds the closest looking consolation prize to go home with. It’s a tried and true method. If not sad and pathetic.
“I haven’t really decided. I’m debating on videos over just pics-”
Dean shrugs, “Just be safe. That’s all I ask.” Cas nods quickly. “Oh and to make all the money, I’m tired of going to work. I need you to be my sugar daddy already.”
Dean is so thankful for his friendship with Cas. So happy he knocked on his door two years ago.
He’s finished putting away the dishes and decides to lean against the counter and observing Dean in his element. He’s never seen him look more at peace than when he’s in the kitchen creating. It brings a smile to Cas’ face.
“What the hell was that?” Dean growls.
“I’m sorry but I don’t think I can assemble this...this...piece of crap.” Cas tosses the pieces on the floor in a huff.
Dean shrugs slightly.
“Just checking. See you guys later,” Dean turns to head back to Cas.
He’s waiting for Ben to be escorted out the main gate when he notices the guy sitting in the car behind him. He’s gorgeous.
“How did you get anything paid for and delivered for five dollars? What did you have some special hippie hair coupon?” Dean mocks.
Cas had never been to the drive-in.
It’s where they first admitted their feelings for one another and first said I love you.
Cas follows him out of the club and into the cool night air.
Every Tuesday and Thursday for the rest of the semester goes pretty much the same. Dean annoys Cas within an inch of his life and Cas makes smartass remarks and empty threats to Dean.
Dean’s in a trance.
“Yeah.”
“So is that a no on the dog or…”
“No. I’m actually taking him out for burgers and beer.” Dean turns to Charlie and holds out his hand for his keys, “You mind taking Jo home?”
Dean leans back onto Cas shoulder, “I’m sure we’ll be okay. I got a sugar daddy I can get the down payment from.” Dean cackles as Cas playful bites into his shoulder.
“You two are idiots.” Charle reminds them.
Dean’s caught in a trance of Cas’ bright blue eyes. They glow when he performs.
They kiss until the song ends.
“I love you,” he whispers.
“I’d love that.”
He’s had everything handed to him in life, his parents are stupid rich. The kind of rich that makes you think you don't actually have to parent the children you chose to have.
“Such a liar. You would have said yes. Especially after you see the ring I bought you.”
“Not like you’re ever home for me to ask you anything.” Dean whispers under his breath.
He doesn’t know how he wants to tell, he just knows it has to be tonight.
He’s never seen Cas look so lost, confused, and broken. He hates it. He wants to wrap Cas in his arms and take it all away.
“You’re not a complete asshole, you could have waited until after you married him to tell him you didn’t love him.” Dean defaults to humor in emotional situations such as these. He just about to apologise for being an ass when Cas speaks again.
“Hey. Just wanted to um,” His hand rubs nervously at the back of his neck, “introduce myself properly. My name's Dean.”
“I thought your stomach hurts?” Cas reminds him.
He beckons Cas from the shadows, and Cas slowly makes his way to Dean meeting him in the middle of the stage
Sam quickly nods, and gets up to wash his hands before Dean changes his mind. His brother hates sharing the kitchen and typically never lets anyone in the kitchen with him.
“Merry Christmas, Dean.”
“Whatever. Help me think of ideas.”
The big things wound you, but the small things kill you.
“That’s what arch nemesis do,” Dean explains.
He had a spare tambourine in his car.
“Noted. And you know you could always do this with me,” Cas suggests.
Dean thinks he found his soulmate.
Charlie is over the moon and everyone seems to be having a good time. Including Dean. He thought it was going to be awkward to meet his best friend’s other friends but they’re all surprisingly cool, even Cas.
Sam helps Dean make three dishes before he’s kicked out the kitchen for being ‘distracted by his phone.’ “Just go call her already,” Dean says a little bitterly. “You and Jess texting back and forth is distracting me.”
It feels like abandonment.
Cas shakes his head, damn he loves this man.
"Yeah, come in." Dean says. The door opens. Cas enters Dean's room.
Dean walks into the room from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of soup on a platter accompanied by a spoon and cloth napkin. "Eat up, Sammy." Dean says as he sets the tray on the table.
"Hello, Dean." Dean pauses immediately.
DEAN does all the usual tests to determine what the entity in his dungeon is. He splashes holy water, does the knife test, but the entity passed all the tests.
In the hallway, Dean asked Cas, "How long do you think the warding in there will hold that creep for?"
Dean laughs, looks over at Cas, and then back to Sam. "Eileen is hot! I hope you banged her!" Dean winks and Castiel absolutely loses it, laughing so hard.
"Yeah, well, it certainly won't hurt" Dean says as he sets the bowl of soup on Sam's bedside table. He hands Sam his phone. "Text me if you need anything. Don't exert yourself by talking. Just get some rest. I'm gonna call Cas and see if he can do anything."
"I take it you two already know each other by now." Dean says to Jo and Charlie.
"I remember when humans first discovered the psychoactive elements of the cannabis plant." Cas said. "It was mainly used as an herbal medicine. The hemp plant was used for textile and ropes; the seeds were used for food."
THE NEXT DAY, Dean strolls into the kitchen in his nightgown and cap, which had been gifted to him by Mrs. Butters, to make some coffee. He hears the bunker door open and close, and goes out to see what's going on.
"Sam?" Dean said. He smiled smugly. "Are you just now coming home?"
CAS pulls Dean close--
Dean continues, "I love the sweet leaf!" He gets out his weed grinder and grinds up a bud. "Cas you wanna learn how to roll a doobie?"
"That was fast, Cas." Dean remarked.
Dean glanced over at Cas briefly, then focusing his view back onto the redneck angel. "Who the hell are you?" Dean demanded.
Dean almost choked on his coffee. "Why are you..wearing... your c" Dean stops. "Shut up, Sam!"
Sam patted his brother's back while he was being embraced. They break the hug.
"Dean, time is of the essence. We can't wait-" Cas replies.
The water of A BONG bubbling can be heard as Dean takes a big hit. Dean looks up and releases the smoke from his lungs into the air above him. "Yeah, that's cool, Cas. Here," Dean passes the bong to Castiel, who is now human after having been saved from the empty.
"Drink this. You'll need to stay hydrated." Cas said.
"Well, bad plan, buddy. 'Cause it's about to get you ganked." Dean said as he got ready to stab the thing.
Sam and Eileen had two beautiful children and lived in the bunker with Dean, Cas, and Jack. They were the ones who kept business going as usual, helping the hunters that wandered through needing help.
Chuck stayed silent and shut his eyes tightly to brace himself for whatever fate he would receive.
It seemed too painful to be real. All he could think about was Cas. His vibrant, blue eyes. His scratchy stubble. His peach colored lips. Everything about Cas was intoxicating, and now he was gone.
“No no Cas it’s me-” Dean tried to reassure and set the lantern down to gently caress the angel’s cheek. “I came here to save you…”
“Thanks, Jerk. I love almost everything in here,” Sam says through a laugh.
“Yeah. We were together five years, married for two,” the other man easily shares. Dean still finds it hard to talk about it.
“Fuck no.”
Cas is forever.
Cas is used to his husband asking random of the wall questions but this one is a little out there. He also knows Dean is quick to anger so he can’t help but jokingly (but also completely seriously) asks, “Is this your way of putting a hit out on someone…?”
In the end, Dean whispers it between kisses right before they fall asleep.
“You would have been embarrassed that I told your ass no in front of all these nice people,” Dean says, remembering that they are in front of a small crowd of friends.
“Luther plays a mean tambourine.” Charlie shares.  Dean looks to Luther in the back of the group, looking a little embarrassed and slightly traumatized by Charlie’s submission.
Dean’s father always said, ‘wishes are for fools.’
“Fine!” Dean snatches the pills out of Cas’ hand.
“I don’t have any ‘arch nemesis’ so I think you’ll be okay.”
As if Cas that’s actually an option for Cas. He’s been pinning after Dean for what feels like forever, and they’ve been friends for longer than that. He can’t go out there and change the dynamic between them.
He drives east. Drives until the moon sets and the sun begins to rise. He’s made his way through a few states, only forcing himself to stop once his eyelids became too heavy to be propped up by caffeine.
“I’m surprised you were there, I heard you weren’t going.” Cas reveals.
“Perfect! You can kill two birds with one stone. Grab us those pastries and I’ll introduce you to Cas. You can ask him on a date and let your brother know who you were actually interested in. And if he turns out to be an asshole, I’m here to back you up, kid!” She pats him on the shoulder.
One of Cas’ favorite past times is irritating his husband so much that he walks out of the room in frustration.
“Hmm, well since I had you looking all over for me on Saturday, let me make it up to you. Let me take you to lunch today.”
Admittedly Dean is not the most cookie cutter person around. He tends to toe the line of legal and illegal fairly often. He’s a firm believer in something is only illegal if you get caught, sans the real obvious fucked up shit.
The alcohol probably didn’t help, either.
Dean rolls his eyes, “I want to go as your boyfriend.”
“Oh yeah?” Cas nods. “And what does that entail exactly?”
It’s the same night, underneath the stars, those three words fall from his lips. Dean swallows them in a kiss and tells him the same.
“Oh, then what?” Dean asks curiously.
Dean kisses the apology from his lips, “but you didn’t. You’re here.”
They make their way back over to everyone else, Dean on a little bit of a performance high.
“I love you too, Dean.”
“I look forward to it.”
“Good luck.”
Sam lifts his hand in agreement, “scouts honor.”
“I think some pieces are missing.” Cas says as scans over all the pieces.
“Didn’t know you were
“It’s nice to meet you Cas. How long have you lived in the complex?” Sam asks.
“Of course.”
“Okay,” Dean quickly agrees. “But this time, I get to pick him out.”
He begins singing softly with his eyes closed.
“Hello,” A random stranger says from outside Dean’s door. “I noticed you were moving in and just wanted to drop by and say hello.”
He wishes he could pick Ben up down the block like he used to do with Sam while he was in high school, but Ben’s still too little to walk all that way by himself.
“I’m hip.” Dean whispers into his spoon.
“Because I don’t want to.”
“I like the view.”
“Okay,” Cas says as he begins playing the first episode of the season.
“Lay off, he’s mine.” Dean pulls Cas in close and plants a loud kiss on his cheek. “Mwah.”
“Ya know, for a minute there I thought you were proposing,” Dean reveals.
He grabs his brand new arctic guitar and strums his strings as he introduces the song.
“Okay,” he says defeatedly.
They stay like this for a minute, holding onto one another, enjoying the moment. The song changes and Dean begins to sway.
“Wait, he’s interested in me?” Dean asks in a rush.
Dean looks at him expectantly. Sam looks down at his phone, “Uh, it’s not here yet.”
“Okay friends and then friends who fucked.” Dean revises.
“You look like a dumbass.” Dean interrupts.
For as tough as Dean is, he turns into a big baby when he’s any type of sick. Even the smallest sniffle will have him crying for attention.
Closer to I love you.
He’s able to dodge the two new besties until Charlie’s birthday rolls around. She’s everyone over for brunch, her favorite meal of the day.
Dean’s mood steadily declines the closer they get to Christmas. He’s crankier than usual, and spends his time mostly alone hiding in his room watching those chick-flick movies he always gives Sam a hard time for. He caught his brother sniffling a time or two while those movies were playing. It does perk up when they go to the grocery store to buy everything for dinner and even more so while Dean’s in the kitchen Christmas Day. Cooking has always put Dean in a better mood, ever since they were little, Sam notices how cooking seemed to always put Dean back in neutral.
He and his band of brothers, literally his band is full of his brothers, play the local clubs on the weekend.
“He’s cute.” Dean admits. “Are you happy?”
“I am Tamara,” she replied, keeping her eyes on Dean. “I’m the new Death.”
“If you let me, I can get every single being out of this place. It’ll be quiet again and you can go back to sleep. And someday you’ll have them back again.”
He walked for a good few minutes before seeing someone laying on the ground in the distance. Dean’s heart skipped a beat and he picked up his pace. As he got closer, he started to recognize the familiar colors of Cas’ soft trench coat and raven hair. With every step Dean took, the brighter the lantern glowed.
“Hey, Chuck!” Sam yelled up towards the sky. “Get out here and talk!”
And a few months later they did get married. It was a beautiful wedding, taking place in the barn where they had first met all those years ago. Strings of red and blue flowers were hung around the barn along with small white lights that glimmered like stars. Everyone was there with them too. Gabriel was Cas’ best man and Sam was Dean’s. Charlie was their flower girl, Bobby was their “pastor”, and Eileen was their ring bearer.
“Dean?” Sam asked worriedly and walked over, standing in front of his older brother. “Why haven’t you been answering my calls? What happened?”
The plan was simple enough. Sam and Jack would meet Chuck in the center of town and keep him distracted while Dean retrieved everyone from the Empty.
“That sounds fun!” Jack chirped, excited to have his first non-cursed milkshake. Sam winked at Dean and gave a small wave to Cas before quickly leading Jack out of the bunker.
Jack smiled up at Sam and looked at Chuck. “Sam is right. You won’t be able to control any of us anymore.”
Dean looked down at the object in his hand and hummed. “Lantern huh? Seems like you’re awful upset about something so unimportant.”
Cas grinned and nodded before looking at Chuck. “Ready.”
Cas blinked slowly, staring at the box in shock as Dean opened it to show him the pure sapphire ring inside. “You mean you want me to accept your hand in marriage?”
Donna was finally able to find a man that loved her for who she was.
As Dean made his way through the Empty, he noticed that it didn’t exactly live up to its name anymore. There were wayward angels and demons everywhere he looked, all talking and wondering what was happening and why Dean Winchester was there with them.
“I feel something. Well- someone. Someone powerful,” Jack replied.
Dean paused for a moment before looking up at her. “A key… to the Empty?” Dean glanced back down at the lantern and furrowed his brows, tightening his grip on it. “Sorry sweetheart but I need to borrow this for a while.”
“I love you.”
Why didn’t you say it back?
Cas tilted his head in confusion as he watched the door close. “Well, that was odd.”
The bunker door opened with a loud screech before Sam and Jack walked inside, grim looks on their faces as they made their way down the stairs. Dean was sitting at the head of the world map table with his back facing them, not bothering to look up from the whiskey bottle in his hands.
“You have no idea.” Dean muttered.
Dean ran up to Cas and dropped to his knees, pulling his angel close. “Cas? Cas! Cas, it’s me!”
An overwhelming guilt hung itself over Dean’s head, asking questions as he grabbed his phone that had started vibrating for the third time and stood up. One stuck out above all the others though.
Dean gulped anxiously and stepped inside. “Well that’s something.” He took a few steps before the portal closed behind him, making him turn slightly and sigh. “No going back now, Dean.”
Jack took a step back and looked down at the floor as Sam took a deep breath. “What happened Dean?”
Crowley mostly stayed in hell, ruling with Rowena, but occasionally visited the bunker to spill the new gossip going around.
Sam furrowed his brows slightly. “It wasn’t just that, was it?”
Tamara shot a cold glare at Dean and crossed her arms. “That isn’t a simple lantern, boy. It’s a key to the Empty and I need it to deliver beings there when they die.”
Dean walked to the center of the room and pushed the chair to the side before kneeling down and opening his duffel bag. Inside the lantern was waiting, almost calling Dean to it. He reached down and carefully picked it up by the cold, silver handle. The lantern emitted the same warm glow it had the night before as he held it up, giving Dean a sense of calm and safety in the terrifying room.
“All the reapers came together in Death’s library to decide who deserved to be in charge next. They decided I would be the best fit and killed me.” Tamara said plainly. “I would like my lantern back now.”
Sam gave Chuck a confident grin and crossed his arms. “Not for much longer. Any moment now, Dean will get here with all the help we need to take you down once and for all. It’s just a matter of time.”
Cas stared up at Dean, light and life slowly coming back to his eyes. Cas sat up slightly and took in the view of the face belonging to the man he loved more than anything, a soft smile spreading across his face. “You’re a little short to be a stormtrooper, hm…?”
Jack’s eyes lit up with their familiar gold glow, power beginning to surge from Chuck into his own body. Glowing cracks the color of Jack’s eyes appeared along Chuck’s face as he let out a blood curdling scream of agony. Jack continued until every last ounce of power was drained and pulled his hands back, letting Chuck fall over onto the pavement.
“Asking you the question I’ve wanted to ask you for a long ass time.” Dean replied with a soft smile, tears welling up in his eyes. “Will you make me the happiest man alive and officially be my angel forever?”
On the fifth day, Jack walked into the kitchen where Sam and Dean were silently eating breakfast. “Sam? Dean?”
Amara chuckled softly. “I’ll certainly do my best.” She looked at Dean over her shoulder who instantly straightened up and gave her an apologetic smile. “Don’t worry Dean. I forgive you.”
Cas kneeled down and cupped Dean’s cheek with his hand, a smile on his face. “Of course I’ll marry you Dean.”
Bobby would visit the boys from time to time, bringing them cakes and pastries that he baked himself.
“Shuddup, Sam.” Dean grumbled under his breath and put his pistol away.
Team Free Will 2.0 crowded around the head of the first library table. Cas had a pocket knife in hand, Dean helping him carve into the wood. Jack had one as well, Sam keeping a close eye on him to make sure he was doing it right. Soon enough, they both finished and stood up straight. The letters CW and JW were now carved into the table with the others.
They eventually arrived after their drive and stepped out of the car. They took their shoes off and stepped onto the beach, the sun setting on the horizon. Dean led Sam and Cas up to the water and grabbed both of their hands. A sense of content and relief washed over the three of them. After fifteen long years, their journey was finally over. They had lost a lot, but it was all worth it in the end. Because now they had their freedom. They had each other. They could dip their toes in the sand and take it all in.
Chuck growled angrily and stomped his foot on the asphalt road, managing to crack it. “No! This isn’t how the story goes! You’re supposed to be alone forever!”
The Empty took a second to think before letting Cas go, the angel quickly running over and latching onto Dean’s arm. “It’s okay, Cas. I’ve got you.” Dean whispered and pressed a soft kiss to the top of Cas’ head before looking back up at the dark entity.
“There’s my angel.” Dean smiled more and leaned in closer. “Cas, you can have me. You’ve always had me you stupid son of a bitch. Can I have you too?”
Dean visibly tensed and ran a hand down his face, making Sam’s face twist with confusion and worry. He kneeled down and looked up at Dean, tilting his head to the side slightly. “Dean..?”
Cas chuckled softly and nodded. “I’m yours Dean.” He replied before closing the space between them. When their lips touched, Dean felt truly free for the first time in his life. This was everything he’d ever wanted, and he finally had it.
Sam and Jack had already left for the center of town, leaving Dean alone outside the dungeon door. He must’ve stood there for at least five minutes, terrified to step inside and face the room the love of his life was killed in.
Cas furrowed his brows and gave Dean’s hand a gentle squeeze. “We’re making it up as we go.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile at that.
Sam and Eileen got married about a month later. Dean sobbed like a toddler during the reception.
“We need it so we can save someone we…” Dean shook his head and looked back up at her, a burning determination in his eyes. “Someone I love, and we just might be able to stop Chuck while we’re at it.”
Sam straightened his posture and lowered his gun slightly. “The new death? How is that possible?”
Dean ran a hand through his hair as a soft sob escaped his throat. “I-I didn’t get to s-say it back Sammy…”
Dean started crying halfway through saying his vows so Cas had to comfort him. And during their first dance to Can’t Help Falling In Love, Dean spun Cas one too many times and they almost fell on top of their wedding cake.
------------
Chuck took a small step back, deep down moved by Sam’s determination but refusing to acknowledge it. “No! Get down!” Chuck barked, raising his fist to hit Sam again, but stopping when he heard the familiar sound of a portal opening behind him.
The brothers both nodded and went with Jack to the impala that waited patiently in the cold garage. Dean started her up when everyone was settled inside and stepped on the gas pedal, practically launching out the garage door and speeding down the road.
Dean smiled and gave his friend and pat on the shoulder. “Hey Crowley. It’s good to see you again.”
Dean took a deep breath and clutched the duffle bag in his hand tighter. “You can do this Dean. Do it for Cas.” He muttered to himself before pushing the door open and stepping inside.
Dean chuckled softly and nodded. “Yes you dumbass. I want you to marry me.”
------------
Tamara growled lowly and started walking towards them. “What could you humans possibly want with something like this?”
Dean sighed heavily and looked up at Sam. “He’s dead.. Cas is dead..”
Tamara stopped walking and her gaze softened as the lantern’s glow grew. “You truly do care for this being, don’t you?”
Chuck stared at them for a moment before breaking down laughing. Sam’s smile faltered as he glanced from Jack back to Chuck. The laughing carried on for a good while before Chuck took a deep breath and wiped at one of his teary eyes. “Phew! That’s rich guys! Excellent joke really.”
Dean gulped down the emotions that threatened to erupt from his chest and just simply shook his head in response.
Dean took a breath of relief and looked at Jack. “Is it done?”
Sam sighed softly and leaned up, pulling his older brother into a tight hug, Jack following soon after. “It’s okay Dean. You’ll get to say it to him someday, I promise.”
Sam gave her his own nod. “Yeah, thanks. We’ll see you around.”
"Cas," Dean grabbed Cas' hand in his. He looked down at their hands and then back up into Castiel's eyes.
"Cas!" He looks up. Dean and Cas walk towards each other and embrace. It had been a while since they'd seen each other. "It's good to see you, man" Dean says and then breaks apart the hug.
Cas nods. "Of course." He looks over at Dean. His gaze lingering on the beauty of Dean's face before he began to speak in an empathetic tone. "Dean. We
"Sam!" Dean worries. "Cas, is this supposed to happen?"
Dean puts the spoon back in the soup and defensively puts his hands up. "Alright, alright, Sam, I just want you to be safe."
"Good luck!" Jo replied with a smile and then turned to hang out with Charlie.
Cas looked down at Dean's hand and then back up at Dean. "Dean.."
Cas rolled his eyes. "Dean, I think we should go somewhere more private." Dean agreed and grabbed Cas' hand. They went out to the Impala.
"That's enough, chucklehead. Stay where you are!" Dean commanded as he aimed his weapon.
"Ok, you need to rest. Go lay down Sam, I won't say it again." Dean commands at his baby brother.
, Sam thought.
Castiel walks in wearing just one of Dean's t-shirts and pants. No trenchcoat. Sam's mouth falls agape in shock as he looks over at Cas and then back at Dean. Dean didn't even notice Sam's expression because he was checking Cas out.
"First, you need to do something for me." the villain said.
Dean bobs his head along as he makes his way through the crowded bar. He knew this song, "Truckin'". He'd heard it lots of times on classic rock radio stations and on one of his dad's old mixed tapes on the road.
"Where you going?" Dean shouted as Sam walked away.
"Can you do this without waking him?" Dean asks quietly to Cas.
, Dean. And I'm the only one who can do anything about it."
Dean rolls his eyes. "That's just great. Well, how do we fix this?" "How do we heal my baby brother?"
He spots Charlie. "Charlie!" Dean called out with a huge grin. He missed her so much!
Eileen rolls her sleeve back down. "Sam," Eileen says.
"Dean, he's lying. That's not an angel." Cas said.
"What do you want?" Castiel asked before Dean could.
DEAN pulls Cas close--
Sam makes his way down the hallway, keeping a hand on the wall to help him keep his composure, and the other hand held out his gun. When he got to the main room of the bunker, he didn't see anything. "Huh." Sam pondered in his head. "Hello?" he asked.
Dean smiled at Sam. "I bet that vaccine isn't the only thing you're gonna administer to her," Dean said snarkily and laughed.
"And you just left him in there all night?" Sam asked.
"Easy, Cas. Start off slow." Dean says as he takes the bong from Cas and lights up another hit.
"What?" Dean is confused.
Dean looked suspiciously at Jo and Charlie, but didn't say anything.
"Tell me why I shouldn't gank you right now." Dean asked after the syringe was securely in his pocket.
Castiel smiles and almost cries.
"Why aren't you in bed, Sam?" Dean asks as he goes down the stairs into the main room of the bunker.
"Yeah." Dean replied. "Hey, what if that thing was telling the truth? About Sam?"
"Dean, since when do you know anything about vaccines and medical science? I'm good. In fact, I've been looking for a case." Sam replied.
"Dean, I put the villain we captured in the dungeon." Castiel said. "And I checked on Sam again. He says he's doing great. I told him to stay hydrated and to get some rest."
"Shut up." Sam said jokingly. He sat his bag down on the map table and went back into the kitchen with Dean.
"Unbelievable. Dean, I thought we were past making deals to save each other!" Sam yelled at Dean.
Sam rolled his eyes. "What, like what you're about to do with Cas?" Sam was feeling sassy today.
Dean and Castiel both crack up. Sam rolls his eyes.
Cas feels concerned about Dean, but trusts him.
Roadhouse originally. He smiled thinking about all the friends and family he'd be reunited with shortly.
"I definitely did not say that." Dean interrupted.
Sam video calls Eileen to tell her he's doing better and got the vaccine. Eileen signs that that's great news.  Sam asks Eileen if she'll let him vaccinate her, and she agrees to it. He says he'll be right over and they say their goodbyes & hang up. He packs a bag and grabs a vial of the vaccine and a clean syringe for Eileen.
Cas' expression turned into a sad one. "I'm sorry you're here so soon."
Sam arrives at Eileen's. He texts her to let her know he's there.  She lets him in the door. He sets down his bag and signs for her to sit down and roll up her sleeve. It's time to get vaccinated!
"I'm here to help. I'm an angel." redneck angel said. Castiel tilted his head and squinted. He didn't recognize this so-called angel.
"Yes, a 'DeLorean', as you say." Cas does finger quotes when he says "DeLorean". This was a rare occasion where he did, in fact, understand that reference. Dean made Cas watch all three
Sam furrowed his brow in confusion, but didn't have time to question it. "I'm heading out to vaccinate Eileen. I just wanted to let you know before I go."
He started typing. "Hey, Eileen. Thanks for that. Could you do me a favor? I need you to find out if there have been any reports of auditory hallucinations associated with the virus. Thanks!" Sam pondered a moment. Was the exclamation point after the
"Yeah, yeah. I get it, Einstein. Your angel mojo is like a DeLorean." Dean quipped.
Dean laughs. Cas is so confused.
"Dean, he'll be fine." Cas assured him.
"There's no way, Dean!" Cas replied and laughed. Dean went over and put on a Led Zeppelin vinyl record.
The villain eyes down at the blade and then back up at Cas. "Is that really necessary?" he looks over at Dean and then back at Cas. "I've got your vaccine, boys." The villain says in a sassy tone. Dean lets go of the guy and backs away cautiously.
"After Jack brought Cas back from the Empty, he told me what he told you before he died." Charlie started. "Dean, I'm so sorry that happened. But, I knew it. I always knew you two had a thing for each other!"
Dean's heart softens a little bit. "No, Cas. I want to say it."
he wondered in his head. He decides against telling Dean about the disturbance and waits for whatever is in the bunker to emerge into his presence.
"I'm good, Cas. Thank you." Sam replied.
"It's alright, Cas, I was ready to go." Dean replies and Cas looks heartbroken upon hearing that. "Anyway, man, how did you get out of there? I thought the empty had you forever!" Dean said.
Dean rolls his eyes, "Yeah, alright, Sammy, you're totally fine" he says exasperated through his face mask.
"Dean, CoronaVirus can affect anyone." Castiel replied.
Dean stops in front of Sam's door to put his mask on. "Can't be too careful" Dean says through his mask as he knocks on the door before opening it and letting Cas inside.
"You ready?" Dean asks and they both exit the Impala, fake badges in hand.
"No side effects or residual symptoms?" Cas asked.
Sam's phone vibrates. A text from Eileen!
Dean was silenced by that comeback. Sam chuckled and shook his head and walked away. "I'll see you later."
Dressed in a worn-out navy blue ballcap, denim, and sneakers, this was not your typical fanciful villain.
Dean smiled cheekily. "You been with Eileen all night?"
'Tractor angel' laughs. "I'm the last thing Chuck created. Before you killed him."
"Dean, don't trust him." Castiel warned.
Castiel's heart jumps a beat, metaphorically speaking. "What?" he asks as he turns around.
Dean accidentally locked eyes with Jerry Garcia from the crowd. Jerry winked at Dean from the stage. Dean was surprised and confused for a moment, but decided to keep looking for people he knows.
"Cas, I need to say something." Dean says seriously.
"We're driving, and that's final" Dean demands.
Bobby gave Dean a sad look but decided not to lecture him now. They had an eternity to discuss it. Of course, he wished Dean would've "kept on truckin'" and remembered the refrain "I will get by, I will survive", or even at least lived until he had a "touch of grey" in his hair, but Dean was about to hear some Grateful Dead anyway. Bobby was grateful to see Dean, but not grateful Dean was dead.
The villain reaches into his coat for something. Dean arms his gun. "Relax. I'm just getting the vaccine." The villain slowly pulls out a big fat syringe filled with a dark liquid.
Back in the Impala, Dean and Cas are traveling homeward to the bunker. Dean is focused on the road. It's dark out. Cas looks over at Dean.
Sam thought.
Dean just looked away.
"Anyway, I just thought that you two would've, you know, met up by now. Especially after..." Cas had told Charlie all about the love confession from 15x18.
"I'm gonna go find Bobby." Dean said.
Sam, the gentleman, opens his mouth in surprise. He stutters a bit. "I-I---"
The villain smiles. "Yes, but it comes with a price."
Dean stepped out of the Impala and paused with a furrowed brow. "....Grateful Dead?!" Dean asked himself aloud in bewilderment. He had used Jerry Garcia once as one of his famous "rock star aliases", but he was by no means a 'Deadhead'. Dean shrugged it off and decided to go inside the Roadhouse to look for Bobby. Heck, maybe even he'd spot Ellen or Jo, since it was
The Grateful Dead all assumed their positions on stage and played like nothing had changed over the years. Dean arrived back at the Roadhouse to see light emanating from the windows of the bar. Loud, somewhat muffled live music could be heard blasting from the Roadhouse.
Bobby answered, "Cas helped."
Dean looked wistfully over at Cas.
"Why don't you stay here a while?" Eileen asks.
"Oh...." Cas said and looked away.
Cas thanked Bobby and went back to assembling the Grateful Dead band in heaven.
Cas is smoking the joint they just rolled. "Cas, be careful, man. You don't wanna get weed sickness."
SAM is coughing and struggling to breathe. He has no sense of smell. He has bodily aches and pains associated with COVID-19. A crashing sound was heard in the distance and Sam jolted up. Weakly, he stepped out of his bed, slipping on plaid slippers and grabbing his gun. He continues coughing. A stealth attack would not be possible in his condition. Sam tries to continue down the hall, weapon armed, but has to stop to lean against the wall and catch his breath. Sam coughs dryly. He hears another crash and grimaces as he tries to gain his strength back.
Dean smiled. Then, he turned his view over to Sam. "Well, Sammy. Keep me updated on how you're feeling." Dean said and started to leave the room. "I'm gonna go take a shower."
-RECORD SCRATCH- "I bet you're wondering how we got here," said the entire Grateful Dead band whilst standing in the bright white light of heaven.
EILEEN pulls Sam close---
"Dean, I told you, I feel great. Like I had never been sick at all. The vaccine worked." Sam assured his brother.
Castiel replies, "I'm not sure."
"It's good to see you, son, but isn't it a bit soon?" Bobby said as they walked closer to the porch of the Roadhouse.
"Dean, I'm fine! You've got to stay six feet away" Sam
"Hey, Sam. I've got updates from the CDC about COVID-19. I'm forwarding you the info."
Dean looks over at Cas and then lets the guy go. "But I will be back for you." he says and points at him and walks away.
"I don't have time for this" Dean tackles the guy and cuffs him and stuffs him in his trunk. The redneck 'angel' simply allowed it to happen. Dean and Cas get back on the road.
"No way," Dean disagrees, "We're taking the Impala."
"You don't need to say it, Dean. I know." Cas says.
"Sam has COVID-19?" the camera dramatically zooms in on Dean's face. (Robert Singer directed this episode).
“I love you,” Dean breaths before capturing Cas’ mouth in a deep kiss.
“What the fuck?” He mutters to himself. He pulls his phone out of his pocket to double check but all that stairs back at him are the words, “delivered”.
“That’s not how the saying goes.” She explains.
“No, because I don’t want a shiny piece of metal distracting me.” Dean reaches up and caresses Cas’s face. “You...this-,” he uses his other hand to gesture between the two of them, “is too important to lose.” Dean declares.
Dean glances at the top of his phone for the time, 2:45 am.
“Whatever, I guess I’ll return it and get a new one,” Cas says a little defeated.
“You gonna remember all this in the morning or are we gonna have to reenact it all?”
“Only for you,” Dean says before capturing Cas’ mouth in a soft kiss.
Dean’s completely caught off guard by the pronoun. “She?!”
Even if he’s the biggest demon of them all.
“Hi,” is all Dean says.
His hands are stained with the blood of all his victims.
He watches as Dean sways and grinds on nameless bodies.
“Pass. I have enough friends,” he informs her.
Sam tells him he doesn’t need to make a decision now. That he should take some time to think about it.
“Dean.”
“I know. And yours isn’t here yet.”
“Yeah. I mean I had to come over here away from my studying to come let you down because puppy eyes over there,” she points at Sam, “wouldn’t stop talking unless I came to talk to you. Plus my friend is actually the one of  us that was interested in you and-”
“I don’t know. I assume. I gotta look into it.”
“But Dean…” Sam whines.
Dean panics for a moment, but Cas turns a soft intimate smile towards him and all his fears seem to fade away.
“Just stopping by for practice. Luther here mentioned that he wants to join a band and well you’re in one so here we are.”
Once Dean is back home, he has the time to overthink and overanalyze every word shared between them. He begins to wonder if he made a mistake telling Cas how he felt. Wonders if Cas is using studying as an excuse not to talk to him.
It’s driving him crazy but he can’t look away.
“Why are you laughing at my pain? Love me!”
“Yeah, so did I.” Dean says sadly. Thankfully the doorbell rings before he dives too deep into his feelings. Dean grabs his wallet on the counter top before opening the door for the pizza.
The smoke of his voice curls all around Dean.
Him and Cas together.
“Dean,” he says as he grasps Cas’ hand. He feels something pass between them.
“Hey babe. How was your-” Dean cuts himself when he sees Milano walking towards him. “Cas, why is there a dog in our house?”
He waits for Dean to put the last trey into the oven and set the timer before pulling him into the tight embrace.
“I’ll think about it.”
“No! I’m not a creep. Promise. We’re good.” Dean says quickly.
Dean’s heart picks up speed as Cas begins to say his vows. The words sound so pretty falling from his lips, too bad they’re being said to the wrong person. Inias shouldn’t be the one Cas promising his vows to, it should be Dean but he realized his feelings for Cas too late.
Dean and Sam are exhausted. It’s 107 degrees out and they have been moving all of Dean’s things into his new apartment all day.
And the best part of it all is that Dean actually has a chance with him. And not in the ‘oh were both into guys’ kinda chance but Cas and him have been flirting all brunch.
He’s woken up by the shrill ring of his phone, blindly answering.
“Why are you staring out the window like some freak?” Sam questions.
Dean just glares down at him annoyed, hands on his hips demanding Cas to ‘get the hell up!’
“Benny?” Dean calls out.
“Please. Please, please, please. I don’t want to do this alone.”
“114.”
“I want,” Dean confirms.
“I don’t know why I didn’t want to meet you.” Dean confesses.
“I still can’t believe he cheated. I really thought Benny was the one.”
“Don’t apologize for me. Blue eyes saw us out there struggling like a bunch of pack mules.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Would you make me the luckiest man alive-”
“The day I met you I knew I was supposed to be by your side, to be your husband. Dean you were so beautiful I had to remind myself to breathe. Then I got to know what a truly amazing, supportive, and understanding person you are. I remember during our wedding promising every God out there, that I would do all I could to keep you happy, to make sure you knew how much I love you, how much I adore you, and how much I can’t live without you. Somewhere, somehow I lost track of that,” Cas confesses. “I am ashamed that I broke all of my promises to you. I’m ashamed that it took you leaving for me to notice.”
“Why not?” Sam prods.
“You were never a scout.”
He’s looking around, about to settle for some blonde when dark hair and blue eyes walks through the door and takes a seat a couple of chairs down from Dean.
Dean leans forward and captures his lips in a kiss. “I love you too,” he breathed into Cas’ mouth. “I love you so much Cas. I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”
“She’ll settle your soul.”
They’re waiting in line to be checked in, security taking their job extra seriously because of some Russian royal family that’s throwing the party.
“All night?” Cas asks.
“I swear you two are so annoying,” Meg from accounting interrupts. If Dean had nemesis, he thinks she’d fit the role perfectly. And of course she’s here with her sidekick, Lilith and the reason why Dean will no longer date coworkers, Lisa Braden.
“Whatever. Cas, tell everyone that you and Dean have been together for twenty years.” Charlie begs.
“Since when do you listen to Drake?” She asks, confused.
Dean knows he doesn’t deserve him but he can’t let him go.
“Okay?”
He points over in Sam’s direction. Forever Dean’s biggest fans.
Dean kindly flips her the bird as he watches Cas make his way back towards the center of their makeshift stage and away from Dean.
“It really isn’t,” Charlie disagrees. “I’ve heard better.”
Cas is playing with Milano on the floor of their living room when Dean walks in.
The morning light is streaming through the kitchen window bathing the room in a magical golden hue. Cas’ music fills the air. They dance around each other effortlessly, neither getting in the way of the other. It’s like they know exactly where the other is at all times without having to think about it. A great accomplishment in the small apartment kitchen.
“All I’m saying is that I’ve never known us as a couple. I want to take some time to explore that more.”
Cas has never been to Ikea.
He throws a heated look towards Cas who strums his guitar passionately, lost in the music; in such a way that always drives Dean mad with desire.
How they made up until the wee hours of the morning.
“Where are you going?” Cas asks. Deans surprised he even noticed. For the short amount of time Dean was gone, Cas has already opened his laptop and started working again. Like their fight was just a small inconvenience to his day.
“No,” Cas answers as he leans down to whisper into Dean’s ear. “Pie.”
He’s the most precious thing in the entire universe. His big brown eyes are bright and espressive. He’s all black with white on his tummy and on his left paw, or his fancy paw as Cas likes to call it. He’s a furry little baby and Cas doesn’t know how he has gone this long in life without him.
“Hello.” Handsome neighbor answers. “Um, are these yours?” He hands the box to Dean.
Dean finds it absolutely adorable.
His boyfriend nods his head and begins playing the opening notes on his acoustic guitar.
Well not fully. Cas had been making fun of the amount of money and time Dean spent picking out the perfect television for their new home. Cas said if that much thought was going into a television, then it should at least be sitting on something pretty.
So Dean doesn’t take these playful carefree moods for granted. He just wishes that they didn’t involve him being pinned down and attacked by Cas nimble fingers.
“Didn’t he kill all those people because they killed his dog?”
Dean shakes his head no, “What about that ring would make you think I would like something like that? You know me Cas.”
“Why did you leave?” Cas asks softly.
“Am I too late?”
He reminds Cas of when three year olds try to explain why their imaginary friend is mad can’t play.
He doesn’t know what he was expecting from Dean but getting pulled into a hug and peppered with kisses was very low on the list. “Finally,” Dean breaths. “I know how much you hated there.”
“I’m the guest of a guest,” Dean clarifies. “But come find me on your break, I think we can work something out,” Dean requests.
“I feel like you’d just be punishing yourself,” Cas warns.
Cas leans forward and captures Dean lips in a kiss.
“You offering?”
“Not into the hipster beer?”
They take a lap around the venue while sipping their drinks and making small talk with coworkers they run into. Before they know it, the party is winding down and Dean hasn’t seen Cas anywhere. “Sorry, Champ. I know you were looking forward to seeing him tonight,” Charlie pats him on the shoulder.
with anyone.” Josie, the box-dyed redhead says to him over a hushed tone. The way she says “involved” rubs Dean the wrong way. Dean’s always known she had a bit of a crush on him but this feels like more than jealousy.
“Why is there a dog in the house?” Dean repeats.
And because they live in an apartment and Dean didn’t want to accidentally damage the walls by trying to mount it; he let him buy it.
Baby has always been good at both.
“No I didn’t! Stop being bitter and just accept the fact that I’m better than you already,” Dean teases.
Dean knew that Cas was forever.
“I was going home with her anyway, dufus, we live together.”
Cas rolls his eyes before replying, “I know Dean. How about you take some of these ginger pills we have. They always calm my stomach.”
“I told you we couldn’t have a dog.” Dean snaps. “You disobeyed me.”
See the difference between Charlie and Dean is that Charlie enjoys hanging out with their coworkers outside of work. Dean, not so much.
“I swear to God, Cas. If you don’t get off of me...” Dean wheezes through a burst of giggles.
Also because Cas had pissed him off the night before so Dean considers him struggling as payback.
Castiel Novak.
“Oh my gosh, Cas that’s amazing!” Dean says excitedly, “why didn’t you tell me sooner? You let me bitch about my dumb problems.”
“No but maybe they’ll accept one of yours,” Sam jokes back. “Just need a bit longer.”
“Only because he cheated!” Jo protested.
“Are you going to continue talking to me?”
“Are you still in love with me?”
He continues to steal glances but keeps catching the top of the other man’s head, he must be reading something.
“Perfect, it’s a date then.” Dean smiles.
“Aww,” Andrea coos. “On Valentine’s Day? How romantic.”
Dean swipes at the wetness on his face, “You promise?”
Their first kiss.
“Peach.” Cas answers as he moves off of Dean as he makes his way towards the kitchen.
“You’re a guest at this fancy party. Shouldn’t you be buying me one?”
Dean swears Cas is performing just for him.
“Follow me around, carry my shit, do what I want, how I want it.”
Dean didn’t realize he was in love with his best friend until Cas had already fallen in love with someone else. He didn't accept those feelings until Cas got engaged. By then, it was too late. He couldn’t steal Cas’ chance at happiness from him.
“I feel like I need a shower after watching you eye fuck the entire practice,” Sam says from off to the side where he and Jess were watching the band go through their line up for their upcoming gig at The Roadhouse.
“Just trying to be a good friend.”
“Yeah how’s that,” Dean steps closer into Cas’ space.
It’s easier this way. Safer.
Cas makes some very good points. Especially numbers three and five, those two are very important to Dean.
But he doesn’t.
He’d give Cas anything.
“How’d you find me anyways?” Dean asks through bites of noodles.
Cas does as he’s told, swallowing the pill down with is his almost empty glass of whiskey. “I’m gonna go get some more.”
He knows he forced them to take things slow but he wanted to cherish every moment with Cas.
He knows they’re bonding and everything but he doesn't want to bond with them like that.
“Finally,” he hears his brother whisper under his breath as he and Charlie make their way back to the counter.
He’s scared.
Because she isn’t who Dean’s interested in.
“I don’t know, babe…”
“That his dead wife gave him! Her last gift to him!”
“The gift that keeps on giving,” Sam says with an eye roll.
“Those are like all the places I want to visit.”
All three  spend the evening getting to know one another, with Dean and Cas doing the bulk of the talking. They end up sharing their divorce stories over pizza.
“Yeah. I’ll follow you to the ends of the universe and anywhere after that,” Cas promises. He places a kiss softly on Dean’s lips, “I love you.”
Dean has his options too; he can follow his pipe dream of using his art degree and opening his own art gallery where he would blend art and music together, or he can take the soul sucking route and do what his dad wants and be groomed to take over the family business.
“You down for food or you two got somewhere to be?” Dane asks Jess and his brother.
He takes longer than necessary on deciding what pastries to bring over, but in the end he decides on a honey bran muffin for the redhead and a slice of pecan pie for Cas. Because let's face it, there’s no future for them if the guy doesn’t like pie.
“I’ll do everything I can,” Cas promises as he closes the car door and drives off.
“Hey, guys!” Dean greets his and Charlie’s coworkers. “What are you all doing here?” He directs the question at Charlie.
Dean grew up shouldering the blame for so much, things beyond his control. Cas not only shoulders that weight with him, but removes some of it completely.
Dean blushes slightly.
“Cas we both work full time jobs, who’s going to take care of it?” Not anymore.
Dean knows when he’s defeated.
“You know he didn’t,” Gabe, Cas’ brother and bandmate interrupts.
“You have three; Sam, Benny, and me. And Sam doesn’t count because he’s your brother.”
With trembling hands, Dean lets Cas in after hearing his soft knock.
“Love isn’t the problem.” Cas’ shoulders fall in relief and it breaks Dean’s heart. How could this man ever think Dean could stop loving him?
“Wow, I have to go open the door for my own gift? Real classy, Sammy,” Dean grumbles on his way to the door. “I’m not tipping them!”
Dean stands in the doorway of his and Cas’ living room and watches as his boyfriend struggles to put together the entertainment stand they bought from their last Ikea trip. He’s got about 85% of the pieces scattered around him and the other 15% (incorrectly) assembled.
“Oh God,” Charlie rolls her eyes. “Can we go one day without you two turning everything into a bet? You still owe Dean money from last time.”
It’s soft, chaste, and everything Dean dreamt it would be.
The guy smirks. “Hands out to the side,” he commands.
“Oh stop pouting. If you actually gave him a chance instead of imitating a three year old, I think you two would get along.”
He’s basically Dean’s dream guy.
Cas loved them.
“Oh, nothing...just making an ass outta myself as usual.”
“But I was hungry,” Dean reasons.
“Thanks, brotha.” Benny says as he grabs the box out of Andy’s hand and carries it towards where he and Jo are sitting.
“Because how would I fund the rest? I can’t open an art gallery with no money, and I can’t really run away without at least a little bit of cash,” Dean explains.
, and Cas and Dean are making their way through
Dean turns to Cas, who at least has the decency to look sheepish, “Yeah he was just showing me around.”
“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” Dean expresses.
“You know you could just go out there, mate?” Balthazar offers.
“Haha, you’re so funny. Are you going to help me or not?”
“Scouts honor,” Cas promises.
“Yes, Cas, I would do the same for you.” Dean quickly answers.
He just wants them to take their time to enjoy one another, to get to really know the person in front of them.
They stare at each other for a moment, both with tear stained cheeks with fresh about to spill over.
“Stop tickling me before I rip your fingers off!” Dean threatens through gasps of air.
He’s about to graduate college, and according to his father, it’s time for him to ‘grow up and stop with all of this childish shit.’
“Cas, I’m allergic.” They have hypoallergenic dogs.
“It eventually gets easier. Alcohol helps.”
Dean nods against Cas’ cheek, “It was.”
“And you look exceptionally lovely, Ms. Bradbury,” Dean compliments.
“I am hilarious,” Cas says as he tucks himself behind Dean. “And financially responsible. We only have to celebrate our anniversary every four years.”
“Cas.”
He warned Cas of what he was, what he did, who his family is; damn Cas for staying through it all.
"Yes, it's some sort of music" Castiel replied and squinted.
The sound is getting closer to where Dean and Cas are standing.
Cas smiled. "I'd like that, Dean. Thank you." He sat down and Dean brought mugs of coffee over for Cas & Sam before sitting down with his own cup.
Dean takes his gaze off the road briefly to look at Castiel. He licks his lips and says "Yeah, me neither. But we're gonna find out when we get back to the bunker. For now, we need to get that vaccine."
Dean really didn't want to stop this moment he was sharing with his best friend. "Don't come in. Just say it."
"After what, Charlie?" Dean asked.
Dean and Cas just looked at each other and then Dean said, "We had more important things going on."
"Well, Dean. If Cas knows how to make the vaccine, we should be getting this out there! We could save millions of lives." Sam said.
"And I appreciate it, I do, I -" Sam starts coughing.
"You thinking shifter?" Dean asked.
"Dean." Cas starts.
Sam smiled and took a drink. "Thanks, Cas. I'm fine, though. I promise."
Cas does his angel thing and finds out what's wrong with Sam. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Dean is already in the hallway waiting to hear the result.
"Yer gat dang right, boy." Bobby said coming from behind Dean with arms outreached, ready to embrace the eldest Winchester.
The man walked over to Dean and hugged him.
Sam stumbles into the main room of the men of letters bunker and takes a seat at the table. He opens up his laptop and starts with "So get this" followed immediately by a coughing fit.
"Ah ah ah." the villain halts Dean. So, we have a deal, right?"
"I'm cured! The vaccine worked!" Sam said as he suddenly was in perfect health again. He stood up.
"I know how your brother's
Cas laughs. "Sure, Dean." Dean proceeds to show Cas how to roll a joint like a boss and even gets out a blunt wrap to show him how to do that, too.
Before Dean can react, Jo comes up from behind him and hands him a beer. "Hey!" Jo says with a smile and pulls Dean in for a hug.
Bobby peeked his head back into the Roadhouse and called out "Alright, Cas, the coast is clear. Dean's gone."
"Don't talk, Sammy, I've got you. Don't worry." Dean tries to  carry Sam over to his bedroom. Eventually, they make it to Sam's room, with Sam leaning on Dean & Dean holding Sam up with his arm/shoulder. Dean sets his weakened brother onto his bed and tucks him in.
"Sam, how are you feeling?" Castiel asked, concerned.
"What?" Dean asked and they stopped walking. Their eyes met.
Sam looks up at her. "Yeah?"
cure Sam." he said to comfort Dean.
"What about him?" Dean asked.
Sam rolls his eyes. "Dean, I'm fine." Sam tries to suppress it as he starts to cough. "Really, Dean, I-" Sam loses his breath and cannot finish his sentence.
"Open up, Sam!" Dean says as he spoons up some soup to feed to Sam.
Dean closed his room door and went back over towards Castiel.
Sam, hunting bag over his shoulder, says "Yeah, okay. I'm gonna be in my room, guys." Sam walks away and Dean looks back at Cas.
"Can you fix him?" asked Dean.
"I thought you were a Deadhead." Cas said.
"It's hard to say, Dean. I've never encountered anything like this. It seems to be working so far." Cas replied.
Dean moved through the crowd and wondered "Where the hell
"I don't understand. How did this happen? I mean we've been in the bunker and I sure as hell don't have it. Right?" Dean asked.
"We'll see about that." Dean said and left the dungeon with Cas.
He moves out of the way slightly to reveal a blood sigil.
"We're really good friends, actually." Jo says.
Sam didn't know whether to crack up laughing or to throw up hearing about his brother's intimate life. "I'm glad you two finally resolved whatever tension you had going on. It took you long enough!" Sam laughs. Dean is confused for a moment, but shrugs. He couldn't deny that he had a profound bond with his best friend Cas.
"What?" Dean asked.
Sam thought and chuckled slightly to himself. Mrs. Butters had been a Mary Poppins/Mrs Doubtfire-esque wood nymph that had once lived in the bunker. The episode she appears in is called "Last Holiday" (season 15 episode 14).
"We didn't have time for that. I can't lose you, Sam. Not now." Dean said.
Sam shook his head. "I feel great." Cas went to get Sam some water and handed it to him.
Dean had been standing in the hallway right outside Sam's door while texting him that. He knocked on Sam's door. Sam rolls his eyes and opens the door.
"Oh, Sammy. It's good to have you back." Dean stood up and hugged his brother.
Bob Weir is singing the first verse of "Truckin'" as Dean walks into the Roadhouse.
"A case? Sam you need to take it easy for a while. You've just had a serious illness and I don't know what the price-" Dean stops. Sam furrows his brow in confusion.
Cas' heart almost stops a beat. Was Dean finally gonna reciprocate the love confession?
Dean went back into his room and got dressed and ready to interrogate the villain.
"Now, shall we get down to business?" the redneck 'angel' said with a sinister grin.
Sam starts to relax as the pulsating from the vaccine wears off.
Sam looks down at the needle as he carefully injects it into Eileen's bloodstream. Eileen looks at Sam with love in her big, beautiful eyes. Sam looks up and meets her gaze and smiles. The syringe is empty, and he takes it out. Eileen feels no ill effects and the vaccine seems not to affect her at all. Sam is full of relief, but also wondering why the vaccine was so agonizing for him in particular. He puts the syringe back in his bag and gives Eileen a band-aid.
Cas turns to look at Dean and just squints. He's not sure if Dean is being serious, but decides to not answer.
"Your father?" Cas asked. "I'm afraid so."
Dean replies, "I'm coming in to check on you."
The villain chuckles. "If you do," he turns his gaze over to Cas. "Your angel here dies."
"Hey, Dean, why is he wearing your clothes?" Sam just came right out with it.
"They're ok. It's just a bit odd." Dean replied.
"What 'case'? Sam?" Dean starts but drops the matter as he sees his little brother struggling to get up from his seat.
"Yeah," Sam said. He didn't want to protest.
he thinks. Then he realizes Cas is probably busy rebuilding heaven, and that's probably just Jimmy Novak. Dean just stares at the man and doesn't move. Their eyes meet.
The scene suddenly cuts from night to day, just like in the fanfic gap from episode 9x06 "Heaven Can't Wait". What happened during this time gap is omitted and up for interpretation.
"Dean, I can feed myself!" Sam
"Oh, look. It's the Captain & Tennille." the villain said, referring to Dean & Castiel.
"Thank you." Eileen says and smiles.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Shut your mouth" Dean said and drank the last of his coffee. "Cas and I will go interrogate the villain. You, go rest, relax, text Eileen," Dean winked. "Just take it easy for a while, okay?"
Dean turned around while Cas kept watch on the redneck "angel".
Dean backs up. "And why should I believe that?"
"Hello, boy. And angel. Castiel, how are you?" Crowley replied sarcastically.
Cas started to explain but then Dean suddenly kissed him. He couldn't hold it in anymore. Cas immediately kissed back as passionately as he could and shoved Dean against the wall. Dean was extremely turned on by that. "I really am in heaven." Dean accidentally said out loud. Cas smiled and kissed Dean hard. Everybody in the bar is staring at them at this point. Suddenly Cas realized that and pulled away from Dean.
"You're high. I told you I was with Eileen." Sam replies.
"Listen here, you son of a bitch!" Dean launches towards the guy and holds him against a wall.
"Grateful Dead
Dean agreed.
DEAN texts Sam. "Hey, how you doing in there? Need anything? Feeling ok?"
"Wouldn't you like to know?" the thing in the tractor angel meat suit asked sarcastically. "It was an illusion. A projection. You weren't listening to me, so I needed to get your attention somehow."
Cas, totally blazed off one toke, mutters, "Dean, I'm fine." Dean chuckles. Cas also chuckles. "I think I can hear angel radio again, actually."
"Back when Billie was going to bust in the dungeon, when you summoned the empty," Dean continued, "You told me you loved me."
"Look, Sam, I had to. Cas said you were beyond  the point of being healed and he couldn't do anything." Dean said.
"Don't you like them?" Cas asked.
"Alright, Cas, we need to go in there and find Bobby, and mom, and..." Dean trails off a bit. "Would John be here?"
"I'm not sure" Cas replied.
"Wait. Don't you want to know about your brother?" the fake tractor angel said.
Cas, not knowing what to expect, says "What?"
Dean just rolls his eyes and reaches to grab the vaccine from the guy.
"What the hell is going on here?" Dean said and he rolled his eyes.
"C'mere, boy." Bobby grabbed Dean into a hug and they began walking towards the Roadhouse.
They get through the usual guardian demons and get inside the warehouse to the vaccine. A villain is waiting inside for them.
The 'tractor angel' chuckled. "I guess you don't. But you don't have to take my word for it. Just take a look at your poor little Sammy. His clock is
Sam sits down as he can't stand any longer. He coughs. He checks his cell phone.
Dean smiled. "Thanks, Cas". Cas smiles back and then turns to leave Dean's room.
?" Dean asks Cas as they head from the Impala towards the Roadhouse.
"Where's Sam?" Cas asks and squints. Getting right down to business, Dean thinks as he starts leading Cas to Sam's location.
"Well, I feel the same way, Cas. I couldn't say it then. I couldn't say goodbye. I couldn't lose you again." Dean said emotionally and on the brink of tears.
"Dean, that's not up to you!" Sam replied. He got his coat on and got ready to leave the bunker. He walked past Dean out of his room.
"Nice try, angel. But this price has to be paid by Dean." the villain stated.
"This is real music, Cas. This is what life is all about!" Dean put the needle on the record and "Good Times Bad Times" starts to play. He goes back over to Cas and sits back down.
"Time is relative. What are minutes to you, can be centuries for others." Castiel starts to explain quantum mechanics to Dean, but he cuts him off.
Dean started getting angry. "How do you know about that? You tell me who you are now, you son of a bitch!"
THE LAST THING Dean remembered was the feeling of being nailed against a wall in a barn. He woke up with no pain whatsoever, and felt great. Better than ever. "I guess this is Heaven. Hmm." Dean said to himself.
"Cas, you got your ears on?" Dean starts, eyes closed and hands clasped, "It's Sam. He's sick. I need you here, man. Please.." Dean looks up towards the ceiling as if that would help his prayer get through "I can't lose him. And-" Dean almost says that he misses Castiel, but decides not to say it. "It's bad. Get here asap!"
“I am. I’ve never seen you before.”
