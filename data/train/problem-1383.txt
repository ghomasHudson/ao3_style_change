"Yeah? So what are
John stared at him, a flawed desperation making its way through his veins and fuelling him. "Please, Sherlock, just sit down so that Greg and I -"
. John, I'm linking you to Sherlock. For those who have no idea what that means, Sherlock will now have to take a drink whenever John does. Same goes for John whenever Sherlock has to take a drink. In other words," a big, drunken grin plastered itself over his face, "they are both 100% FUCKED."
Yet here he was now, two months later and more than a few handfuls of missed seminars and lectures littering the ground beneath his dragging feet. His marks were dipping considerably, his attendance more so – he had not spoken to Mike in two weeks, dodging his calls, unable to force himself to even attempt to be sociable. He had gritted his teeth through phone calls from his parents, forcing himself to lie about how university was going, about how his essays were being written far in advance and that his personal tutor couldn't be more pleased with him; his mother had lapped it up eagerly, so proud of her son. She had sent him letters from his grandparents, gently pushing with loving words to encourage him to write back – and usually he would. Usually it would take little to no effort to write out a little letter to any member of his family with updates from his life at university. They were all impressed, especially considering how his sister Harry was spending her life at the moment. When he really thought about it – and thinking wasn't really in his repertoire these days – the way that he was currently spending his time would probably still be considered better than drowning in alcohol and women, which pretty much summed up Harry's life.
And speak he does. “Bit of a stupid question, really, mate.” He clears his throat. “
"I'm sorry, all right?" John wasn't sorry. He was tipsy enough that he actually found it all rather amusing. "It's Greg's fault, not mine, so stop glaring at me like that. It's only for another fifty minutes, then you can bugger off back upstairs and sulk some more."
John allowed himself one last grin as he begrudgingly began entering Jim's e-mail address, tapping down to the main body of the e-mail and forcing himself to focus on the task at hand despite knowing as he did that he had no idea what he was supposed to say. A gentle calm settled over the three of them, Wanda humming again and Tim occasionally murmuring to himself about whatever he was reading about Goring United; John closed his eyes momentarily to let the contentment of the moment settle over him, not for the first time wondering how he would ever be able to go back to his ordinary life after having experienced such quiet happiness in this wonderful family home. He hadn't had a single moment to himself to let his depression start to edge its way in, and he could quite easily say that he would allow himself to never have a single moment of privacy again if it meant he could stay here and be eternally distracted by Wanda's insistent care-giving and Tim's gentle-mannered humour.
She glared at him. "That was ten years ago, Tim!"
"And the piece of music? A change, I think, from what you were originally planning to play, brother dear, correct?"
"John's father is a relapsing alcoholic," Sherlock cut across him bluntly, "so I doubt he thinks much of anything about it."
"You left your phone in my room, John," Sherlock hissed, sounding oddly panicked, "and now she's asking
this was not simply an act between two men... it was an act of determination and desperation and desire between two people who had reached a point where it was essentially pointless to consider other options outside of each other; he did not need to think of anyone else, nor did he want to. He was wholly, absolutely, nonsensically fixated on Sherlock now, and it was beyond comprehension to even imagine that there could be anything
John's eyes slid to meet Sherlock's; there was a moment of unspoken conversation,a flashback to earlier. It was not difficult to say what he said next.
Sherlock had to admit that he rather liked the jumper.
The smell of cooking beef was pleasant. "What are you making?"
The man opposite nodded his acceptance, squeezing John's shoulder lightly; the smaller man fought the urge to knock it away. "You should get it fixed or something, it's been bloody weird without you around! Missed one hell of a party last week, Greg threw an absolute
The slightest narrowing of his gaze and a flicker of trepidation passed over Sherlock's face, eyes skating between John's mottled-blue stare and the lips he was supposed to be kissing before he gave a small nod, pushing himself up (John found he rather liked being the taller one) and hovering a few centimetres from John's lips as he allowed his gaze to flit one more time to meet John's – the effect hadn't changed. The intensity was so thick that John was almost certain that the oxygen in the room was depleting, so ridiculous though it was that a single stare could cause such ramifications; it was almost painful in its own way, the knowledge that he couldn't simply stare into those pools of verdigris for the rest of the evening – but oh, no, it wasn't so terrible when instead Sherlock was pressing forward and brushing his lips carefully, intently against John's and was letting those eyes flutter closed so as to truly allow himself to lose his way and fall into the moment. It was actually the very
John straightened his back, shoulders rolling back. "No? What exactly were you planning to do next?"
It was perfect, perfection, the large hands reaching up to drag his face back to Sherlock's now utterly unyielding kiss as his own fingers mercilessly prised the gaping belt from its prison and half-pulled it from its holdings; he let it clatter against the door, not caring even a little that the noises might find their way downstairs to Mrs. Hudson, pulling at Sherlock's lower lip with his teeth whilst his hands gave up trying to undo the zipper and instead shifted down to cup the overwhelming heat and hardness of Sherlock's arousal, grinding his own erection against the shape of it and letting a primal groan slip into the limited space between them as he did it again, again, his tongue winding its way into Sherlock's suddenly parted lips and tasting the scintillating combination of tea, knowledge and regret for not having done this sooner. He wrapped his fingers around Sherlock and brushed his thumb over a spot that left the man rolling out a low keen, the lips that were surely now bruised from their passion forming his name beneath their ruthless kisses and the tell-tale arch of a spine as Sherlock moved himself to meet John's unrelenting fingers touching, stroking, pulling them both into a spiral they'd been gravitating towards for far too long –
"Depression is generally unemotional."
Brought out of his little stupor by Wanda's gentle, hesitant voice, he turned towards her with a willing smile. "Yeah?"
"Not at all," Sherlock said smoothly, staying where he was. "It's not me you need to be worried about offending."
John blinked (his eyelids felt as if they were glued to his eyeballs, bloody hell) and locked his phone, groaning to himself as he pushed the heels of his palms into his eyes and wondered when his brain had been replaced by mush and mulch; today was not going to be pleasant, especially as the floorboards above him were creaking and Sherlock was almost
John did not hold back; his fist went into the wall, all of the nothingness he'd been feeling all day disappearing as the anger flooded through his veins, pain a welcome by-product of his emotion. His voice in comparison was disturbingly calm. "Now, I know I haven't known Sherlock as long as you have. I admit that. Okay? I admit that. But what I do know -" He breathed in and out heavily through his nose for a moment, far too close to losing his grip, " - what I do know is that Sherlock,
"No need to look so abashed, Mother, you're quite right." Mycroft seemed unperturbed by her words, looking as gracefully nonchalant as John wished
"I'm going to shower now and head downstairs to help Mum with dinner. I'll see you down there."
"I had one too."
John caught up quickly, letting go of Sherlock's arms and straightening his spine in his attempt to match up to Sherlock's height; he pulled his brows down into a frown, his eyes sharpening into a glare as he let himself fall into a character as easily as he had done as a child. "I don't
He took it with a nod of appreciation, holding it with the tips of his fingers so as not to burn himself. "Brilliant. Thanks, Mum. So -" he braced himself, " - how have you been?"
John's eyes narrowed further still. "No, but that doesn't
could have told you that."
"Soon."
Pushing himself up onto an elbow, Sherlock looked to John once more; his face was still deathly pale and John could see from the slight tremble in the arm supporting him that he was not at all feeling back to his ‘usual form’, yet the tiny smile that flickered on the man’s lips was 100% Sherlock and was clearly intended to make John fully aware that his ‘game’ was not yet over. “John’s very capable,
"Please don't touch me," Sherlock warned quietly, still not looking at him, avoiding his eyes with every intent to never look into them again. "It would be of great detriment to my respect for you."
"I want to learn," Sherlock insisted, suddenly sitting up straight – John found himself wondering at the strength of his stomach muscles – and moving his hands so that they were behind him, supporting himself on the bed; John was now pretty much kneeling up either side of one of Sherlock's long legs, arms at his sides. "I want to learn, John. So teach me."
"No, this is way out of my league," she cut across, sounding genuinely apologetic, "never even heard of something so... so...
The voice again.
the hell to do. Time quite literally slowed down, and that's not an exaggeration. I felt as if all of my muscles had locked into place, I pretty much used the kitchen counter as a way of forcing my body to twist around just so that I could face you."
of live here now," Greg said with a shrug, not appearing to mind in the slightest. "You've bought more food this last week than me and Sherlock have."
John did not miss the demonic bark of laughter from Greg – god, it was all planned. The man was insane. "You do realise there was alcohol in that glass?"
The first threads of a begrudging respect started to wind their way into Sherlock's opinion of her. Yes, it was an effective approach. How irritating. "There is nothing definitive about it. He just is."
"I don't like vod-"
"All right."
John’s voice mirrors the softness of his approach. “I went to see my therapist after you died.” He pauses, the silence pressing intimately against the fact that Sherlock had in fact
Was he just making a big deal out of absolutely nothing?
Shit, he was running late. He was running so late. By the time he got to the Wyatt Building he was practically sweating from his insane journey there, his shin definitely bruised from smacking it onto the bloody bench that had come out of nowhere and his head starting to hurt from having to get up, get dressed and get to his introductory appointment within ten minutes. All in all it wasn't an auspicious start, yet John had to admit that at least because he was running late he hadn't been panicking about what he was going to say in there to whatever man or woman he found himself opposite. As a wise (arrogant, arsehole of a) man had once said to him,
John hit 'End Call' and threw the phone across the room.
She leapt up to stand beside him, every bit as chaotic as he was regimented, and offered him a shit-eating grin so wide that it went head-to-head in competition with every similar smile he'd seen on Sherlock's mother's own face since he'd first stepped over the threshold of the Holmes family cottage.
John stopped in the middle of a path, hands still deep in his pockets. "Why are you so intent on my breaking into the observatory with you?"
John's feet were moving before he could stop himself. "Get it under a tap – do you have a first aid kit?" His words were unnecessary – he saw the little green box sitting underneath the shelf of keys by the front door, his hands grabbing for it and flicking the catch so that the lid popped open and he found himself facing a myriad of bandages, plasters and antiseptic wipes; he grabbed one of each of the latter two, striding over to where Sherlock was still standing with blood casually dripping into the cupped palm beneath the injury and reaching out without thinking to grasp the top of Sherlock's arm. He felt rather than saw the instant jerk of Sherlock's reaction to his insistent touch but, distracted by the circumstances of the situation, ignored it and instead dragged his friend/ex-friend/
Sherlock took the few steps back to the music stand and waited a few moments once more for the applause to die down, his eyes focused completely on the sheet music in front of him. Slowly he raised the beautiful wooden instrument to his throat, resting the side of his jaw very lightly against the chinrest, seemingly completely involved before he'd even started playing. Lucas Halloway, taking his lead from Sherlock's ready-and-waiting pose, began to let his undoubtedly talented fingers fly across the keys.
It didn't stop him. He squeezed her fingers as lightly as he could, so breakable she now seemed to him. Already so broken. He could not fix her, he had never been able to fix her regardless of all of his best efforts. Despite all he had realised over the past few days – her horrendous behaviour towards Harry, her unintentional but still undeniably damaging conditioning of his behaviour, the sheer narrow-mindedness that she simply could not change, no matter how much her children desperately needed her to – he could feel nothing but pity. It was an emotion he loathed, a useless waste of a feeling, but it clung to him like oil and would, he knew, be a stain that he would find near impossible to remove on his own.
The blankets shifted and a figure sat up; John was silhouetted against the dim light of the street lamp outside. "I was. I did. My hand -" Sherlock watched as Silhouette-John held it up, " - was prickling. Doesn't make for an easy sleep."
John was now right behind him, enough that he could hear his slight breathlessness in every inhale he took. "We can't fix this if you keep running away from the problem; if you'd just told me about it last night -"
"Well, he's on your mind. Maybe he
John grunted, moving his hand until it knocked against Sherlock's glass. "Shut up and drink more, then, 'cos if I'm a seven then you have to at least be a four and that's obviously not fair
With that, he pulled the door open and stepped out into the cooling night air without even taking a coat, reaching behind him to close the door quietly without turning to face the house again. His footsteps were quick, the sound of them fading out until John was staring at the closed door with nothing but the sound of his own breathing in his ears.
By the time Tim had finished his third cider and was looking a little flushed in the cheeks, it was 4:45pm. The sky was a little less clear with some clouds rolling in over the horizon as they rounded the corner to take a walk on the now deserted beach, the breeze much cooler almost to the point of being chilly and most certainly brisk enough to make John wish that he'd brought a jumper along with him. Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed completely nonplussed by the weather, his hands shoved into his jeans pockets and his usual long strides as graceful as ever as he walked a few paces ahead of John; from the back he could have been any young man at all, his thick curly hair and casual hands-in-pockets gait making him look every bit his age without being able to see his face, hear his voice. The fact that the man was wearing jeans and a polo-shirt made him look every bit as ordinary as any other nineteen year old and yet, as John watched him walk behind his parents, it didn't diminish anything about him. If anything, this odd, inconsequential view of Sherlock as a teenager-bordering-on-adult made John feel strangely charmed. Sherlock was not ordinary, but with the right clothes and the right lighting, he could fool anyone. And yet he had not chosen to fool John.
"I – why?"
it was just too bloody confusing and full of the sort of insinuation that made John feel more than a little uncomfortable.
me.” The tone was insistent, agitated. John raised his eyes and saw Sherlock frowning, lips slightly open. “I warn you, I have a very short fuse tonight. I won’t want to ask more than twice.”
Ah. Still defensive. “You've already considered this, I assume. Is that why you're being the way that you are?”
got something out of it, of course – he couldn't easily forget the rush, the exhilaration, and he owed that admittedly exciting, distracting night to Sherlock. So, yes. John was open-minded enough to break the law for his friend.
John could feel the disbelief twisting his face awkwardly. "No. No, he isn't."
at what you sent me."
"Sorry," John said, slightly abashed but knowing to take it in good humour, "but I promise it was meant in an entirely affectionate way."
He took two steps towards the door before it was flung open. Standing there, drink in hand, flushed in the face and grinning like she'd never experienced alcohol before was Molly, a girl from his course and another person he had once considered a friend... and jesus, did she looked absolutely
"What?"
There would be time for questions later. Not now.
"He was, until Sherlock."
"Why?"
"Prick," John muttered disbelievingly. "Yet again, an utter prick." He leaned away from the laptop but kept his eyes focused on the words in front of him, hardly believing what he had just read. Did people like this even exist? Was it possible that William Holmes was actually just a troll and that Joanne had never actually recommended anybody to him?
Greg's eyes glittered with something similar to sympathy, his lips opening for a moment before he actually uttered anything. "You're right, okay? You're right. Sherlock got carried away."
Sherlock turned back to his friend, irritated. "Well, yes. I would have thought it was obvious."
Subconsciously John's eyes drifted up to look at the ceiling above him, wondering if Sherlock could hear their conversation.
The reply came as the music ended.
Sherlock sighed impatiently, arms folding over his chest. “
"Yes, my best friend actually. I'd always thought of it as totally platonic, we never mucked around when we were kids or anything, we'd kissed once maybe but that was just to see what kissing was all about." John stomach knotted slightly at the notion of kissing; he hadn't forgotten. He'd thought of it more than he wanted to admit. "But then, eleven years later, he's telling me he's always been in love with me and he'd do anything for a chance with me. It was hard to tell him no."
Watson, J
"Maybe you don't."
Sherlock's eyebrow arched up, not even having to process the list John had thrown at him. "You haven't offended me. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not lying to you."
Sherlock flashed him the tiniest of smiles, gone as quickly as it had come. "Quite."
“Calm down,” Mycroft admonished, though not unkindly. “You’re losing control, you need to reign it back in.”
He tried not to think too hard about the fact that he was already missing the influence of the curly-haired genius.
supermarket Thai."
So that's where Sherlock got at least a hint of his observational skills from.
John opened his mouth to deliver yet another agreement but, remembering just in time, stopped himself. He slowly pushed himself back further onto the bed, crossing his legs as he leaned his back against the cold wall and rested the laptop properly in his lap.
"Oh god," John muttered, shaking his head. "You both know that only ends in... well, vomit."
on a date everybody else seemed to think that they were). It was difficult to think clearly with the heat and the tension and the warm food in his stomach. "I don't know, Sherlock." He looked down at his plate, fiddling with his cutlery. "It's not something I think about."
"I'm not being coy, I have absolutely
Depression is not something to be ashamed of.
"What makes you say that? You're a great guy!"
"No, no! Tell us about your lesbi-love!"
her youngest son. "I'm sure he's very talented."
The noise Sherlock made in the back of his throat was so full of derision that John had to replay Greg's words in his head just to make sure he hadn't suggested shooting a kitten; nope, totally legit. Sherlock did not pick up his glass. "That is probably one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard in my life, not owing just to the fact that Heaven is a construct-"
Sherlock can feel his own defenses rising, yet he doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want that at all. Not now. This is the wrong moment for defenses -
to smile, his lips half-committed to it but the rest of his face remained impassive to the idea. “Regardless, you’re awake now! We can get you home and you can resume your rest in your own bed.”
"Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much as far away from the truth as you could get."
The mixture of warm water and cool air was undeniably pleasant. The closest thing that John could compare it to was a hot water bottle, soothing and incredibly beneficial to his bouncing nerves. His breathing became long and deep, his entire body starting to relax into the lovely feeling as Sherlock carried on dragging the warm flannel over his chest, occasionally moving away to rinse it within the steaming water before bringing it back and beginning his careful ministrations once again. After three or so minutes of this there was an easily distinguishable moment where Sherlock took longer than usual to bring the flannel back to his skin and John could not even begin to know what was happening in his own mind as he let out a small groan of complaint, missing the warmth and pressure; he was instantly and painfully aware of what he had done and how it had sounded in the quiet of the room, his eyes instantly flying open and staring at the ceiling in mortification as Sherlock stopped wringing out the flannel and turned to stare, slowly, at the steadily horrified mask of John's face.
"I don't know," John admitted, rubbing his palm over his face, "I really don't. I mean, I guess it kind of helps me. Breaks me out of my... grey."
"Normal?"
“Course she did.” Greg leaned over across the conservatory table and picked up his can of Diet Coke. “Everything you could possibly think of. She doesn't quite understand why we need a third housemate or how he could possibly put up with you for long periods of time, but... yeah. She's pretty intrigued. Wants to meet him as soon as.”
A small jolt of surprise went through John: there were other topics up for discussion? He bypassed this for now, however, trying to keep on track.
The sound of Sherlock’s voice startled him out of his wonderings and brought him back to the moment at hand; John forced a smile, shaking his head. “I’m fine, sorry. I just want you to be prepared for what you’re walking into.”
“He left two hours ago, with his sister... listen, seriously, who -”
Thank goodness Sherlock
"Just... tell me. Quickly."
, John Watson, who is the extraordinary one."
Mycroft glared at him from across the table as he ladled two eggs onto his toast. "No need to be catty,
Sherlock's eyes flitted sharply to rest upon Greg's horrified face. "I think it would be better if he said nothing. Always nothing."
John was wishing he'd never even mentioned the idea of Sherlock being something other than himself. He hadn't meant it... or at least, he didn't
It was then that John felt it: the grin, the slight buzz in his head, the strange and mild leaping sensation in his stomach... the
Breathing out a sigh of frustration (and trying to ignore the small burst of adrenaline that had been sparked by Sherlock's warning), John made a small leap over a pool of something dark and sticky, glancing quickly behind him before returning his apprehensive gaze back to the pathway in front of him. Well, pathway was a bit of a stretch. Obstacle course was more accurate. "It might be helpful if you could tell me
Sherlock could only stare back at her.
Remembering the text message, he unlocked his screen:
Silence at the other end. A small sigh, Mycroft clearing his throat. "I'll get a car. Don't worry about phoning Gregory, I'll do so whilst on my way."
"What did you do?"
There was truth in that. For the first time since Greg had spoken of this insanity John was finally starting to realise that he hadn't considered Sherlock's actual feelings in any of this, just what
“Harry, shut up.”
Sherlock sighed again. "I wasn't aware that there was a universal standard. My hand is on his and our hands are therefore touching, you could in fact say that my hand, cupped as it is over John's, is
"No, not bad," John allowed, tilting his head to one side and trying to read the odd man, "just a bit... a bit weird. Do you really have nothing better to do with your time than break into famous landmarks?"
John nodded. "I know. And that's fine. It doesn't bother me."
"Sherlock," Mycroft warned, eyeing his brother over the edge of his wine glass, "enough."
So he slept a little more. He got up at around 1pm, forcing himself to go through the motions and shower, ate a handful of cornflakes from the box he kept in his room for when he really couldn't face going to the kitchen and got dressed – clean clothes today, though not what he would usually wear: a hoodie and a favourite pair of jeans that had been too small for him for years but were now fitting quite comfortably since he'd started to lose weight. He crawled back into bed for a little while longer, staring blearily at the laptop perched next to him on the desk chair, but no email from William ever appeared. Unsurprising. He turned himself away from the laptop, facing the wall as he stared at the soul-damagingly boring magnolia paint and slowly let his eyes close into yet another dull drift of sleep.
John shuffled against the now warm spot on the wall, waiting. "So? What aren't you saying?"
Eventually the curly-haired genius spoke. "Is it because... is it more uncomfortable for you now because -"
"Right you are," John agreed, leading the way through the hallway into the bright kitchen; a cold April had made way for a rather beautiful May, enough that the windows were open and cool, sun-kissed air was making its way inside as Sherlock walked over to the kettle and put it on, John reaching up into a cupboard to get down three mugs. "I was thinking maybe we could actually cook tonight rather than order takeaway."
"But I -"
And, like that, they were on the subject they had initially been meaning to discuss. John was hesitant, but he knew that if they were going to move on and figure out a way of getting on with this they’d have to talk about it. “I… have questions.”
"First time for everything."
John fell naturally into step beside him, legs still slightly weak from the insane run he'd done just minutes earlier. "What does?"
John stared at the screen in utter bewilderment.
Oh, the man was bloody ignorant to his own talent, so bloody ignorant. "Okay, remember what we talked about the last time we were at Alessandro's? About the whole... intensity thing?"
of John. He had not been lying when he had said he was not here to discuss his heroin addiction. He was here for his
The house looked no different to how it had just a few months ago. The white paint on the outside of the 1930's semi-detached home was still peeling, looking far better from across the road than up-close and personal; the window frame – supposedly painted to look mahogany – was chipped, though clearly Sharon Watson had attempted to cover this by lining the frame with a smattering of pansies of arraying colours. John supposed that, if you weren't already aware of the external flaws, they actually weren't so awful and were easily distracted from by the flowers. It was a speciality of his mother's, using distraction-tactics to avoid dealing with a bigger issue; it felt a little harsh to make such a conclusion but the fact was that for a very long time it had actually worked. John knew that his childhood had been a complicated one, what with his father being a full-time mechanic, a part-time alcoholic and generally a rare presence within their home, but Sharon had plundered on with filling her children's days with activities and distractions to the point of running herself to a state of exhaustion. By age ten he had seen his mother break down in private more than five times and already had a lingering sense that her ever-cheerful attitude with them was nothing more than a practised facade.
Sherlock snorted in derision, looking away. “Biological urges. You make me sound like a… a sex-obsessed ruffian.”
"You'd know
John felt his stomach clench in discomfort. He tried to laugh it off, unsure of where this was heading. "I
"Yes. Soon. Okay, but, until then I'm going to just kiss you one more time, just once more, and then we can -"
Greg stared at him from across the space between them. "Clearly there's something, mate. Otherwise we wouldn't even be having this conversation. And you should know that you sound like a girl right now."
Not thirty seconds later:
"Yes, that was the deal," John said firmly, jerking his head towards the kitchen and indicating that Sherlock should follow him. "And you have to drink
"We won't get lost," Sherlock remarked confidently, leaning over towards John in order to peer out of the window on his friend's side of the car, "I'll keep track of where we are. Anything to get out of this traffic."
Neil took one final step back, looking quite as much a chastised child as a 47-year-old alcohol could when faced with a son who was finally telling him exactly what he should have heard fifteen years ago. It would, perhaps, have been funny if it hadn't been for the damning reality of the situation.
Now that they were on flatter ground John was easily able to catch up on his smaller legs. "I'm not going anywhere, Sherlock, so just -"
,” John said flatly, folding his arms and shifting to block the view into his room. “He’s actually sleeping right now, so maybe you’d like to come back in the morning to pick him up. Or, y’know, I could just walk him home. The fresh air would probably do him a world of good.”
Sherlock did not follow John's movements; instead he seemed to simply accept John's words, accept his final rejection. His shoulders dropped, his fist grasped tighter at the towel and he walked towards his own bedroom without a single glance back.
This here is how I picture Sherlock and Greg's house, though you can see the front garden in my head and it's veeeeery pretty. ^_^
The amusement lingering in the back of Mycroft's tone was almost completely cancelled out by the genuine question, the serious undertones. "I intend to get him back from the brink of wherever he is and find a way of making this okay. Or are you asking me if I plan to shag him? Say what you mean, Mycroft, I've had pretty much all I can take of undercurrents and insinuations this side of 2013."
"You…
"No," the impatient genius interrupted, gaze still focused on his screen, "what are you going to do about your depression?"
"Mm, yes, very nice indeed. Pretty. Friendly. Normal. Just your cup of tea."
"No," John repeated. "It's not. You're fine."
It was a challenge and Sherlock had no intention of recalling it; he knew that John would latch onto it, would react to it, would in the very least feel that familiar rush of frustration at being called both stubborn and ignorant in the same sentence – two things that Sherlock knew very well to be traits that John associated with the genius currently holding a grip that fell beyond the physical and stretched into... well. Whatever this was. He had the control, he held with within his fingers and he was challenging John to take it back. It was the only way.
He pushed the door open and climbed out after her, shaking his head and turning to stare up at the towering mansion in front of him. "Of course not, you don't flap at all – blimey, how many bedrooms does this place have?!"
looking at your face." Surprised, John foolishly glanced up and saw that, indeed, Sherlock was not looking at his face; he was rather intently looking John up and down in probably much the same way that John had done just moments before: it made him feel utterly exposed and, in his mind, the stare was completely indecent. "Mm, my mother has exceptionally good taste. You scrub up rather well, don't you?"
"Well I'm
important."
John stopped on the fourth rock, turning to watch as Sherlock stepped his way carefully onto the first and then second mound of stone. "It's not me you should be worried about, actually - I should be looking out for
Needless to say, I was right.
John's eyes flew back to Sherlock's, shocked; the dark-haired teenager was staring right back, a momentary flash of surprise in his own silvery eyes as he realised he had not only referred to John at a time when he was clearly trying to feign knowledge of his presence but had done so in what could only be defined as passively fond tones. Sherlock quickly tore his gaze away, adding without missing a beat:
"Yeah, you're right,
"No, I -"
about him but I'm not in love with him."
He did not need for her to be specific to know which part of him and Sherlock she was referring to. "Which is why we're keeping it quiet for as long as possible."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Exactly, and you're not an alcoholic -"
Sherlock's eyes flickered slightly but did not meet his. He simply stood there, his hands playing with the damp towel.
don't want to hear what you get up to with Katie. Ever. EVER. You're my sister, for crying out loud...”
The beating of John's heart under the layers of fabric was so strong he wondered hazily if Sherlock would hear it from where he stood.
He really didn't want to be. John wished he hadn't said anything.
Katie's voice came from the background of the call. "Did he kiss him, though?"
. Your reaction – that is to say, your enjoyment – of our physical contact earlier is hardly going to be the same now as it would have been were you mentally sound."
So John did not think it was wrong of himself when he finally broke past the frozen stillness of his body’s weakness to the cacophony of sound which assaulted him to much, too often. He did not think it was rude, or inappropriate, or of any particular shock to either of them when it all became too much and something simply had to be done. Truly he did not think too much of anything when he found himself rising from his armchair with the vibrations flooding his mind and body and soul, eyes fixed on the hand which floated and danced, flickering only to rest on the sharp jaw of his flatmate and the refined dip and flow of his cheekbones. His body was a gentle hum of numbness and light, his legs steadily carrying him across the carpet to ultimately stand beside the connoisseur of of his deep, steadily unravelling emotions and simply stare, intent and unbound, at the man who had created this very masterpiece in order to call him from his sitting place and demand his presence at his side.
John's eyes narrowed. "What sort of digging?"
John sighed; god, this was a lot of effort. "Well I'm not exactly in charge of how I feel day by day right now, am I? You'll have to just... be patient with me, as I'm going to have to be with you."
"What? No, of course not."
"Thank you," Sherlock interrupted, his voice suddenly closer than before, close enough that John could smell a hint of wine, the feel of breath against his hair. Without prior warning Sherlock's hand came to rest lightly on his shoulder, the cold of his skin radiating through the material and making the shorter man shiver slightly as he put the tiniest hint of pressure on it. It was a direction, a hint. "I'll take it from here."
John didn't pretend to misunderstand; all the fight left his body as he, too, collapsed back onto his chair. "I've never had a friendship quite like it, I'll say that."
April 17th 2013 – 10:11pm
it! You're in love with him!"
And there it is: the blossoming of understanding, the light of recognition behind Sherlock's steady gaze and the temporary flicker of a gaze fleeing from his before returning with none of the arrogance and all of the fear. And John finds that he likes that. He likes that Sherlock is afraid. He likes that he is not the only one.
"I told you." His voice was steely. "He has no expectations. He is the first person I've ever observed who expects so little from people, particularly me. It takes a considerable amount to surprise me yet he did that from the very first moment we spoke."
"Yes, covered that just a few times."
A momentary pause.
“John.”
"And don't shout out my name like that again, if you don't mind," the ever-condescending genius spoke from above him, beginning his stride once more, "who knows who lurks in these parts? I wouldn't want any of my arch-enemies to know I'm here."
don't have to tell him you know what's going on – actually, no, that's a demand, not a suggestion," Greg warned, leaning forward again, "you can't tell him what I've told you."
God, this was embarrassing. Even without the image of Sherlock drifting about in the forefront of his mind it would have been hell. "Not really..." Another familiar image, blonde and oval-faced with big blue eyes, glances across heads and knowing smiles. "Well, there's this one girl." That knot of discomfort again, christ, would it not just dissipate? He had known that he would have to lie at some point, or at least avoid the truth. "Mary. She's doing Biology."
"That I… kissed him." He shook his head, the very idea of it making his head spin. "We were interrupted by a mutual acquaintance. My housemate."
John groaned again and forced the images out of his head of the faceless Katie and her busy hands, his mind racing as he attempted to remember what the possible motivation of calling his sister could have been -
John allowed himself a moment to roll his eyes. “Thanks.”
"Think about it. Who else could possibly understand how Sherlock's mind works?"
"Then it must be enjoyment." John wasn't wrong. It was a game of power and Sherlock had it. But he needed it. He needed to know. "Admit it."
Eventually Sherlock spoke, his tone slightly unsure. "Am I being intense now?"
"Why are you trying to get drunk?"
Sherlock's eyes flitted away. "I assume it's not the sort of question I'm supposed to ask, then."
It was John's turn to close his eyes. "Right. So I'm just like heroin, am I? That searing high and then... what, destruction?"
, John. What's wrong with how I'm looking at you?"
Suddenly the word felt rather evocative. Sherlock's fingers pressed hard into the wood as he fought his own desire to step further towards his best friend. "Are you?"
Yeah. He had to say something. “Sherlock, I wish you’d just let that go. It’s over, it’s fixed, everything is fine.”
Did Joanne pass them on to you? I wasn't aware that was something she could do
"So... yeah, there's that." And then John was leaning up –
"Absolutely," she agreed, nodding even more enthusiastically than before. "They're exactly my feelings too, John. No parent should judge their child for their choice in love, if only because it's not really a choice at all. Is it?"
"Greg didn't mean anything by telling me, he wasn't trying to piss you off or upset you... he just wanted to clear things up for me."
Wanda looked around at her family and bit her lower lip. "Well, I'm not sure there's anything
"Have you recovered from your shock?"
– whatever this was – had become steadily more and more obscene the longer he had thought on it. A month and a half, he worked it out to have been, and here they were in a midst of depression, emotional insecurity and the ever-present knowledge that things could have essentially already been torn to shreds in front of them without even having had a chance to breathe. He had heard of the sort of friendships that cemented within days and where two people became so dependant on one another that they couldn't function properly without being by each other's side, but he'd never been on the end of it before. He'd never come close. Even then, the idea of a 'dependant' friendship wasn't exactly right either. He didn't feel dependant on Sherlock, and regardless of Sherlock's developing feelings for him it didn't seem as if
He left the room as quietly as he could, not wanting to wake up John – god knows what he and Sherlock had been up to. He wasn't a complete idiot, he knew that Sherlock did some seriously stupid shit whenever he left the house but he and Mycroft had both agreed that it was at least better than indulging in his heroin habit, so mostly Greg didn't bother asking about it; he couldn't deny though that now his curiosity had been raised. John was hurt – the bandage had given that away – and he had no doubt whatsoever that it was Sherlock's fault. Mycroft had thought so too. He knew that when Sherlock found out that he had sent a text to Mycroft to keep him updated with the situation that he'd be pissed off but that was essentially what Greg was here for; he was a spy. A well-kept spy.
Bringing it back up to his eyeline he forced aside the gradually developing loss of emotion and began to type.
So here's the deal: I'm 31 years old now. A proper adult, apparently, though I'd beg to differ in many respects; either way, I'm living a life, in a house, with a partner and a cat, and sometimes shit can get too big to handle. I haven't written in an incredibly long time, most likely not since that last chapter in 2017, and I can't say that I've felt the motivation or inspiration to do so - probably didn't help (in regards to the fic) that season four was such a hot mess. Kinda takes the edge off of it.
“You should really share your thought-processes with me, John. You might find it helpful.”
Sherlock's fingers played idly with the edge of the duvet cover still somewhat covering his chin. "It's 3am, John."
John couldn't
Pale-blue eyes locked onto his.
Without thinking about what he was doing, John reached out and batted Sherlock's large hand out of his way; his warmth was a stark contrast to Sherlock's cold skin and the effect was instantaneous. Sherlock took a rapid step backwards, pulling his hand back as if it had been burned; John's sharp intake of breath ceased all laughter and brought to him an overwhelming sense of clarity, mind and vision clear as he took in the sight of Sherlock's blank, shocked expression. He had no idea if it was just the fact that the two hadn't touched until now, or perhaps because the temperature difference had been so surprising... but then, there
." The amusement quickly transformed into undisguised distaste. "This really is completely ridiculous, we're like bloody children..."
John looked up, staring right back. "A chat? You don't chat."
“ - embarks on his emotional journey back to his damaging past. How poetic of you.”
, yet was that really such a terrible thing? Did it make him an assumedly awful person if he couldn’t stand to be kept on the outside of whatever was taking John’s attention away from him? After all, John didn’t have him in his life because he was endlessly sweet and pleasant and easy – or if he did then he was surely disappointed on a minute-by-minute basis – and would surely be expecting him to interfere and be as blunt, apathetic and logical as ever… so, would that make it acceptable, were he to demand an explanation? Not here, not in front of Greg, but soon?
"Sorry guys, we were on our way into town and Lauren needed the loo…"
"Oh, right." John seemed completely oblivious to Sherlock's discomfort as he wandered into the room further, Sherlock noting as his eyes adjusted to the darkness that he was heading towards the direction of his desk. "Because you're much more emotionally mature than I am. Do you need me to remind you of Greenwich Park, or…?"
But John had more to look at. The wooden floors – he had been expecting marble – were a rustic, deep oak that looked as if they'd been there for hundreds of years, highly polished and yet worn from hours and hours of dancing from days long gone; travelling up from the floors to the walls – barely
I am well aware of the grading system, thank you. Yes, I have indeed been to university, in fact I am still in attendance at your current place of study, hence why I am your PAT. I had thought that much was obvious.
Chucking his phone back onto the bed and pulling open his wardrobe to see what clean clothes he had available to him (slim pickings, he’d really have to do some washing soon), he ended up reluctantly choosing a plain white shirt and a black and grey striped jumper to go over the top – not his usual style at all, but it would have to do when the rest of his options were t-shirts that would drown his small frame, and dirty, probably a bit smelly clothes he really, seriously needed to chuck in the wash.
Two hours later and John found, for the first time in five days, that he could not sleep.
His sharp, narrowed gaze falls on the hazy reflection in the window opposite him, and he waits.
He could hear the small smile in Sherlock's voice. "More than a bit."
John was quiet for a few moments. "I'm not trying to be a dick about it, Mycroft, it's just still a bit of a mess in my head. I haven't had a defining moment either way and I just... yeah. I don't want to make a decision only to regret it later."
you're assuming that my feelings aren't quite completely platonic."
John hid his grin behind his glass. "It will be if it carries on like this..."
Which obviously wasn't the case now. The words left John's lips without his permission. "But you know what you're doing
"No, I know, I mean…" What did he mean? "It was a tough day for you. A long day. Lectures."
Taking in a few measured breaths, John took a careful step backwards. “I'm sorry.”
"Lord." Sherlock's sigh was infinitely impatient, full of exasperation – it amazed John that he managed to keep up his winning personality even when intoxicated. "Focus for a moment, will you?"
She blinked too quickly as she perched on the edge of the three-seater along the wall. "Well, you know. Nothing really changes around here! Harriet called yesterday for the first time in about a month, says that she's thinking of coming to visit. That will be... nice."
Sherlock's eyebrow raised of its own accord as he pulled two glasses from the top shelf. "Wild? That's a bit of an exaggeration for just one glass of wine."
"...is there much of a difference?"
So he would have to take this slowly.
Tim chuckled good-naturedly behind his paper. "He's a good lad."
Unable to force himself to sit up for fear of making his head spin even more than it already was, John stared up at the ceiling above him and tried to form the right words to fall out of his mouth.
Please confirm that you are there and are able to read my messages.
"Almost definitely." Sherlock began refilling his own glass, sighing as he poured in the vodka. "This really is a complete waste of my time, you know."
"No, I'm entirely aware," Sherlock replied quietly, momentarily putting down his own knife and turning his head to look at John properly, eyes swimming with fire and ice in equal doses; it made John's head spin. "But then, you're not people. You're very much...
John; it was Sherlock. How was Sherlock spinning when he was standing so tall and so still?
"I've already embarrassed myself," the genius grumbled in response, "but, fine. I thought that my stomach was going to fly from my throat, it was quite unlike any feeling I'd experienced before. My eyes instantly flew to the back of your head and, yes, I'll admit that I saw your initial response – your fists clenching, the muscles in your shoulders tensing, I knew what effect I was having on you. And, before you ask, yes. I enjoyed it. And feared it. Perhaps not the last time either one of us experienced both of those at once." There was a moment of heat, a fluttering of intensity; John curled his fingers tight against his palm once more, willing himself to stay on his side of the room. "Naturally I was shaken even if I had known I would see you there that night, if only because I had expected – foolishly – to be in control as to when we would first come face to face. And then you turned around and I saw you and… well. It brings us back to our initial conversation."
“My landlady.”
A secret sort of smile twitched at the edges of Greg's lips. "Mate, you don't know the half of it. Mycroft doesn't need Sherlock to tell him where he is to find out. One answered phone call is all it takes."
"I'm not
He didn't have a chance to decide.
“I suppose we can’t expect Gregory to be able to watch you at all hours of the day – though if you could refrain from making it a necessity that would of course be preferable…?” There was an odd thread of genuine concern in Mycroft’s voice, the question an authentic request. “If you can’t bring yourself to tell me
“It’s all right,” Sherlock allowed generously, straightening his back and resting his hands on the armrests. “We both are. Which leads me to -”
He found himself choking again, this time on a pea. "Oh – oh, christ, no. No. I really can't sing, Mrs. Holm- Wanda, I couldn't sing a straight tune to save my life."
"There was that mimosa this morning, babe." Katie again.
John stared at him incredulously, not at all paying attention to the game anymore. "What's it all about? What's in it for you?"
He did not have words, for words were pointless; everything was a mess of colour and confusion and John was genuinely unsure as to whether he was coming or going – and what an odd sentence that was. He wasn't going. He couldn't possibly move. But going, going forward, where would they be going forward to? Surely at this point it would be to take a step back to accept Sherlock's proposition and carry on as if nothing had happened?
So you know my marks then, do you?
Sherlock's head did an odd little jerk. "It doesn't matter." He crossed the room and placed the bowl on the coffee table, stepping away instantly and back over to the doorway. "I'll give you some privacy to do what you need to do. You should probably try to get some more rest afterwards; Greg is out all evening so he won't disturb you."
Sherlock's body froze. A car pulled up beside them, a cabbie asking the question. John waited.
"John. John." Wanda was approaching him, her own hands outstretched as if to calm him when it was in fact
Sherlock nodded. “I think it’s best if we both try and get a few hours, even if it really is only a few. If you’re sure you have nothing else you want to ask me.”
"Please, Sherlock!" He was practically gasping now and no doubt completely red in the face. "No more about nappy rash, no more about Mycroft's bum, I will
John leaned away from the screen and rested his head against the wall, eyes half-closed but focused on the conversation window as he waited for William's response. He ignored the sensation of butterflies that had started tingling in his stomach, ignoring even harder the knowledge of why the sensation was even there in the first place – it was difficult, though. Especially as William wasn't typing.
Oh, that's right, there was a new sensation – material wrapping itself around his hand, a grip on his wrist again that was much firmer than before but not a bad thing; there was actually something about the solidity of it that was welcome, a comfort. He remembered now the dark alleyway and the stabbing pain of something sharp dragging over his skin – a sharp intake of breath as he recalled it all too vividly, and what was that? A thumb shifted and moved gently over his wrist,
Straightening his back slightly to work the ache he'd been fighting for the last two hours (the workload from his seminar on top of William's daily materials were doing nothing good for his posture), John quickly began to hammer out a reply.
John shot him a very pointed, very specific look that Sherlock had never seen upon his face before. “Well. I should bloody hope so.”
"John."
John shot up into a standing position like a rocket on fire, relief coursing through his body at the idea that it was really that simple, that he wouldn't have to say another word for another week. "Oh, well then... thanks. I didn't realise it would be so... short."
Great, just what John needed: high-intensity therapy sessions twice a week. "Sure. Whatever you think is best."
He shook his head, digging his knife into the apparently inedible bacon and pausing as he brought it to his lips. "No, never. It'll be nice to go somewhere different. Is there a lot to do there?"
"What do I have to do to get you to leave? Tell me, please, because I am
The shorter – and now apparently
Mike's glazed-over eyes shifted from John to William (Sherlock?), squinting. "Didn't interrupt anything, did I?"
“But I don’t want to ask if -”
I wish you could've seen yourself."
An eyebrow raised, a knowing look; Mycroft’s tone held no insinuation yet his words were meaningful. “I have a feeling that if you
that you ended up becoming friends with." He didn't know how else to put it. "I could have been anyone. But you… you're not just anyone."
You sound like you're having a fit, calm down!"
He did not know what it was about this woman, and he was relatively certain he would never be able to put his finger on it, but not for the first time he had a strong desire to go to her and hug her – perhaps it was his lack of appropriate words, the inability to put what he wanted to say across in a language that she would understand, but for whatever reason he felt that, if there were any time to do it, there was no time like the present. He took a few steps towards her as she turned to face him again, her eyes somewhat damp, and gently wrapped his arms around her.
"...not really," she said apologetically, sounding further away again. "Sorry, John, but it sounds like a really complicated situation. He's not at uni anymore?"
Sherlock’s eyebrow twitched. “A date?”
whilst he's so blatantly unable to defend himself."
Wanda's cheeks seemed to flush further still. "Oh, no. No. Sherlock's far too busy with his doctorate to have any loftier pursuits going on in the background."
"Right. And by something else..."
Harry's responding smile was almost sympathetic. “
"John? Can I come in?"
Sherlock span his chair around so that he was once again facing the laptop, not wanting John to see that he had indeed hit the nail directly on the head and how much it still unnerved Sherlock to be on the other end of someone’s observations. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, John. I’ve simply been looking at you, adoring you from afar and thinking to myself how gloriously lucky I am to be blessed with such a… a good-looking, debonair, charming -”
A flicker of a grin twitched at the edges of John's lips. "Entertain you? I don't know what you mean." He leaned down and brushed a kiss once more over Sherlock's flushed lips.
"I'm assuming from your silence that you weren't expecting me."
Sherlock batted this comment away with his hand. "I've already told you, age is meaningless. So. Do you like it?"
. Indulge me, won't you?"
romantic."
"What trap?" she'd said innocently, picking up a turnip and turning it over in her hands. "There's no trap, John, whatever do you mean?"
When the knock came to John's door as he began to climb into bed, he was half-expecting it.
, he's just as handsome as his father!" He saw her shoot him a glance and ignored it, trying to appear distracted by something out of the window. "Those boys and their dark, brooding good looks, they'd be heart-breakers if they knew how."
Finally Sherlock's resolve broke in two, his eyes skating over the page to come up and rest upon John's. The intensity was still there, though it was somewhat subdued. It was purely Sherlock's natural state. "I'm not people."
"Because you still look like you're suffering simply from talking about her." Sherlock stopped in his tracks again, his gaze suddenly so intense and focused on John that even if Sherlock
"Well." John nodded slowly. "Yeah, I guess that is what I'm saying. No matter what happens, we're friends. Friends above everything."
"Are they still having sex?"
"You use that terrible recycled paper, I wanted to know how quickly it disintegrated in comparison to -"
Greg looked at him in sheer disbelief. "Are you... right, yeah, you're actually serious. Bloody hell."
Sherlock stood too, glaring imperiously across the table at his short friend. "We aren't done here! You have work to do!"
"You think?" John bit his lip, so hard it almost broke the skin. "I think this conversation is over."
"I assure you, Mycroft is more than capable of diagnosing me; he's a better physician than any nearby, believe me."
Of course, the moment Sherlock had blasted him with a mass of confusing thoughts and drunken protests the bloody bugger had disappeared upstairs for the rest of the night, leaving John to deal with a big glass of sambuca/tequila/lemonade/something green to drink as a consequence.
"I'm still utterly in the dark about what you could possibly -"
"I'm fine," John said, though in truth the extra half an hour in the car was starting to wear at the contentment he'd been feeling before, "I've faced worse before."
Laughing more still, Molly turned and headed back into the house, her slightly shrill voice floating back out of the door as he walked towards it - "MIKE! It's JOHN!" - and giving him every reason to want to turn around and call a cab to take him home... but no, he was in the door now and had closed it behind him, he might as well give it a few more minutes before he gave up entirely.
"Sherlock and I -"
John stared at him. "Well, all right, I
Sherlock did not want to discuss it. He did not. That, however, did not stop him from speaking, almost as if he was not in control of his mouth. It was starting to become a problem. "From the moment we met he made it clear that he did not need me, did not require anything from me. His emotional state is not stable, he could easily ask the world and not think twice, yet he still has only ever asked this one small favour of me and I have followed it through out of respect for his wishes. His expectations of me are, if in existence, very limited."
together tonight."
"Okay. Great. So... you're just not talking to me?"
"Knowing my luck you'd be a cuddler."
"And what?"
to be a sociopath."
John grinned slightly. "Glad to see you're back to your normal self. I've missed that bastard."
John's eyes fluttered closed. "It was in his room. It wasn't on silent. It probably woke him up and scared the shit out of him."
"You just told your parents that I'm a bad influence!"
To John's complete and utter bewilderment, the presence of Mycroft was actually reassuring.
They stared at each other again. John waited a few beats before remembering he had been trying to get an explanation. "So what is it, Sherlock? This thing you want? Is it why you're feeling so... well..." He gestured towards his friend, frowning. "You know. This."
"Of course," John said with a responding grin, nodding. "I wouldn't expect any less."
The whole room felt as if it were breathing around John. William's voice had an almost disturbingly mellifluous quality, melodic in its depth as the man began to talk into the darkness.
I've been waiting a long time to write this chapter - no, it's not slash, don't get too excited! Anyhoo, hope you enjoy it and please do keep R&Ring. Your comments mean the world to me! =3
"We're not in a relationship," John intercepted shortly, keeping his voice as calm as possible as the man advanced upon him. "We're just friends."
John stayed quiet for a moment, absorbing what Sherlock had said and looking his friend over as he attempted to observe what had changed so suddenly between the hoarse, frozen man of just minutes before and the calm, clearly spoken, far more familiar version opposite him now… but he couldn't place it. He couldn't find it, couldn't place the trigger. Sherlock's long, pale face was perfectly set in its usual expression - one of mild indifference - and his eyes, usually the only part of the man to ever give him away, were utterly nondescript. There was nothing to read. Nothing to go on. He had no idea.
Groaning again, he unlocked the screen and opened his text messaging inbox.
The words that came were even quieter than those of before. "I was distracted."
"As wonderful as that sounds it can't be avoided," Mycroft almost apologised, cutting into his eggs-on-toast and shrugging lightly. "But I'm sure you'll all manage to enjoy a day without me."
His response was awkward – there was no other way to react to any show of fondness from the sister he tended to not think about. They'd never really got on. This was the closest they'd ever come to any actual real semblance of sibling-related affection. "Yeah. Okay."
“Do you want to rescind your friendship? Take it all back? Go back to your accommodation and pretend we never even met?”
Sherlock was staring at him, eyes utterly focused.
John rolled his eyes, leaning back on his chair and folding his arms. "Oh, what, you can interfere with my problems but I can't interfere in yours?"
"It's the truth." John's gaze was steady as ever, open, honest. "Because whether you or I like it or not, Sherlock, I
"Brandy?"
John felt his head shake, though in truth he was feeling a little numb. "My guess is as good as yours." He walked hazily towards the sofa and let himself fall back onto it, his eyes out of focus as he stared in the direction of the fireplace. "I have no bloody idea what the hell just happened and I was here the whole time."
John's teeth ground together. "What I get out of this has nothing to do with anything."
“Quite.”
So she
He drifted off and stopped; his gaze left John's and focused on the coffee table of avoidance. John joined him in this. He didn't know what Sherlock had been about to say and he wasn't altogether sure whether he should press him to continue or not. He wasn't sure if he
“Well you were wrong,” Sherlock hissed, jaw starting to ache from tension, “weren’t you? He’s stubborn, beyond manipulation. You should have seen that, you should have known, then you could have…” He broke off, not knowing how to finish that sentence and realising too late that he had just proved his brother irrevocably right as to the mass of confusion spreading like a cancer through his brain. He swallowed thickly, his eyes closing. “I am beyond comprehension.”
"That girl you were speaking to earlier... are you planning on dancing with her later as you promised?"
"Uh, yes."
John nodded as Sherlock left the room, head spinning. "Yeah. All right."
Wanda, however, looked delighted. "Oh, goodness, of course! Sherlock, you would have let me forget, wouldn't you? You
RE: Academic Tutor (Joanne Harvey recommendation)
Yet he watches as Sherlock takes five tentative steps in his direction, his name spilling once more from brandishing lips. "John."
Greg raised John's empty glass, eyes sparkling. "Brilliant! Awesome! Always wanted a third housemate, kind of like a buffer – just hoped it would be a woman, but..."
for adventure."
"I wasn't
"Says the man who didn't move out of his parents' house until he was twenty-six -"
John rubbed his hands down his face, realising too late that his palm felt as if it were on fire and that it was, in fact, bleeding – just as Sherlock had said. He sighed and untucked the material from its place, starting to unwind it. "I've just spent an evening musing over the words and actions of a man who is possibly
The way he phrased it spoke volumes to her well-versed ear. “Then what
"No -"
"My right hand man?" The words were practically a murmur, Sherlock's icy eyes glancing out to sea before returning to meet John's – Jonathan's – steady gaze. "Well. It's a truth that I've been needing a replacement for Redbeard the Hairy..."
"Yep, yes, you're looking at me like that and you have to stop it now."
April 17th 2013 – 10:06pm
Holmes, W
“It’s quite a space of time, I know, but... well, I’ve been thinking about it.” John is slipping the coat from his shoulders, not looking towards the man silhouetted against the window with a violin perched on his shoulder as he shakes the rain from the somewhat soaked material and throws it unceremoniously to the floor. Sherlock observes, but makes no deductions. Now isn’t the time. “Because it’s five years ago today - did you know that? I know it’s not exactly the sort of anniversary you celebrate, your first suicide, but...”
grateful that you consider me an ally rather than an enemy, which is
Sherlock's fingers closed over the base of the violin, a warmth in his fingertips simply from touching it. "Lauren would be the one to ask."
11:18am. 4 New Messages.
"Well, it's possible that the heat was set just a little too high -"
"I'm not stub-"
"So, what is Sherlock playing tonight?" Mycroft asked, sounding very much as if he did not care at all. "A song of his own composing?"
Neither of them voiced the fact that John could have easily done this part himself as Sherlock began to move the flannel firmly over John's bare skin.
"You must know... you must have an
"I'll be careful," John promised, stepping around a cup that seemed to be sitting in the middle of the floor for absolutely no reason whatsoever and casting his gaze quickly over the kitchen; it was small but airy, the same warm yellow as the hallway. A glass door led out to what looked to be a well-tended rear garden already full of about twelve people smoking in little groups, a pathway leading up to a small decking with what looked like a little water-feature poking out of some reeds at the end. It was such a nice house. What the hell was Greg doing living there? "Nice little place you -"
Mike grinned his genuine, 'always happy to see you' grin and clapped John once more on the shoulder. "Brilliant, mate, brilliant. Always a better party with you there. I can meet you at yours first, have a few pre-drinks?"
"I didn't
... tell me, what's it like to have never experienced growing up?"
"No bloody way."
He waited patiently.
How had it taken him so long to actually
“But John -” Sherlock broke off, a sharp intake of breath as he spoke the man’s name for the first time since he had arrived, “ – John destroyed that, he… he broke in, he interfered. Until tonight it hadn’t mattered so much, or not to the point that it matters now -”
Greg had taken Lauren upstairs half an hour before the last guests had started to leave. They'd been up there for two and a half hours. "Christ."
"I still don't know what I'm doing with Sherlock." There. He'd said it. "We've made up, we're friends again, it's all well and good and I'm very happy with how things are turning out. That doesn't mean I've decided on anything."
"Well..." Greg hesitated, looking briefly at Mycroft. "He doesn't really have friends, does he? I mean, you and he are..." He broke off, suddenly looking intensely uncomfortable. "Well, until now he never really had anyone he could call a friend, exactly."
" Tim's tone was a little less soft, a little more intent, "- it's none of our business, let it go."
John nodded, hesitating as his mind raced over what he could reasonably say and what he could omit without seeming as if he were hiding something. He decided to compromise. "Well, I was struggling with my workload and so my course leader passed on my name to him and... yeah. That's about it, really." He forced a laugh, not wanting to come across as unwilling but not sure how much more he should say. "He ended up being a godsend and we ended up being friends."
This is a walkway through Greenwich Park (for those that don't know, yes, it's TOTALLY a real, awesome place just outside of London).
It took a few moments – too long underneath a silence so full of tension – for John to find his voice, still reeling from Sherlock's tirade to be able to properly articulate himself. "I don't... that came out of nowhere, I wasn't pitying you -"
Without warning Sherlock turned his body to face John properly, legs moving to push roughly against his and face coming close enough that John could smell the lemonade, feel the heat of his breath and taste the vodka; Sherlock's wintry eyes did not move from his face as his knee slid between John's, shoulders bumping lightly against one another.
Sherlock gazed at him with all the intensity of… himself. Yes. He had set new standards of intensity. He was now the bar that nobody else could ever hope to reach. "I see."
A slight movement and the sudden added warmth of a hand on top of the covers, perilously close to Sherlock's leg; John's voice was very soft. "I'm sorry."
"Yes."
you said…” John stared at him, his mind creeping along ridiculously slow behind his voice. “You said
"Yes you do," John argued, though did not feel as irritated as he perhaps would have done a few days before. "What, you want to have 'that conversation' again? Because I still don't know. I'm still unsure."
"And murder."
John hesitated awkwardly, hands shoved into his pockets as he stepped away from the kitchen side. "Well..."
"SHE'S THE ONE WHO GAVE ME HER NUMBER AT THE FIRST PARTY!" Mike had leaned in closer as if to whisper a secret, yet his yelled just as loud as he had been yelling before... still, at least John could hear him now. "WE'VE BEEN TEXTING LOADS AND SHE PROMISED SHE'D COME TONIGHT!"
"You think this is the worst of you?"
Jim smiled slightly. "You seem defensive."
The memories flooded him, the warmth and texture of John's skin, the first hazy glance of mottled blue eyes and the confusion swimming on their surface at the realisation that it had been Sherlock's tender and willing touch to his wrist in order to comfort and soothe. "I took care of him. I cleaned and bandaged his hand. I… attempted to comfort him." He didn't want to explain. He hoped that she would not assume it was something more than a brush of a thumb against delicate skin. "Before he awoke he… murmured something. My name. Twice. I didn't realise what he said the first time, but the second time it was clear enough that it froze me, I couldn't move for seconds… perhaps a whole minute. I knelt there at his side, staring at him like he'd never said my name before. But then, he hadn't. Not like that. It was…" He swallowed, seeing it in front of him as if it were tangible. "It was so… warm. Like he was reaching out to me. I've never heard my name spoken like that by anybody and it just broke something within me, it was irreparable,
"Because I could have handled this before, I could have never said a word and let you live your life without the knowledge that your best friend is..." He broke off, shaking his head, finding John's gaze again and staring into it as if it were an abyss he knew he was falling into yet couldn't quite grasp a hold on the edges to pull himself up. "Do you know where I was tonight, John? Where I've been whilst you've been looking for me?"
"So this call -"
Sherlock rolled his eyes to the ceiling, hardly believing what he was surmising, unsure whether to be amused, condescending or angry. Or all three. Or none. "Why would I hit you?"
, and whether he likes it or not, he knows that everything is about to change and that he won’t do a thing to stop it.
time, so it might as well be now. “It’s not as if it’s going to be… they’re not like your parents, Sherlock, and my upbringing wasn’t like yours. It’s not going to be as easy as it was for me to come into your home with your parents and instantly slip in like I’d always been here. They’re not -”
"Please stop," John begged, letting his head fall forward until his chin touched his chest, "please, please stop. We're not having sex. We haven't had sex. He is in here, he is sitting on the bed but

"I get the point, Sherlock."
"Dark days," John guessed.
"You absolute fucking
"The man who'd had that photo taken was not the man I found myself faced with in that kitchen." Sherlock took in a breath through his teeth, clearly unsure as to how to continue. "You… looked… sunken. Thin. Too thin. Your eyes, they were swollen underneath from excessive sleep and you held yourself in such a way that invited the image of an animal knowing that it's facing its predator – not that I assume that I was the predator, not at all, more likely that it was the simply the pressure of a socialised environment. But… well. That's it. You looked entirely defeated yet at the same time you were fighting it all the way, and that is what I mean by wanting you to fight whilst you're still standing. You were on the floor at that moment, John, utterly beaten down, and though you were still fighting at that point you have an advantage now. A true advantage. So perhaps I am not the best person to encourage you now, seeing as I have failed many times before now to help myself when I, too, am standing, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't tell you…
The days were darker. There had been no trigger, no real warning signs; one day he had been fine, studying in the library as usual, calling up Mike from his student flat on campus to make arrangements for their bi-weekly piss-up, looking at girls with a distant, shy interest... and then he had woken up the next day. Nothing much had changed – he still got out of bed, brushed his teeth, combed his hair, but there was something slightly off about it, something he couldn't put his finger on. He'd got his things together for his seminar, notebooks and pens, but as he'd gone to pull his bedroom door open he'd found himself hesitating for no apparent reason; his mind still felt fuzzy, furred at the edges, and at first he simply considered the idea that perhaps he hadn't slept well enough or that he was coming down with something. Turning his head, he looked to his rumpled bed and felt the first strange dullness start to seep through his veins – he didn't want to go to class today. Perhaps he should have a bit of a nap instead, especially if his head wasn't
