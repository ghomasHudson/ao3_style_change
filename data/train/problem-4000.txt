Mary pauses, mouth open. She expected screaming, ranting. Not this. Not this silent judgment, this even-keeled declaration. She looks at Sam, who looks to the floor, silent. He’s deferring to his brother.
So Dean’s decided he’s not jealous of his brother’s divided attentions, or of the fact that he himself has no one who loves him like Eileen loves Sam. He’s not.
“Good, good,” Dean says, letting out a relieved breath. “Well, everything is good here, but Cas and I are gonna stay the night, keep an eye out on things. We saw a motel just down the highway a few minutes from here. You should get a room for the night, get some rest.”
“Baseball tryouts are starting next week,” he says in a rush. Mama blinks at him from across the table. Dean pushes on. “One of the coaches asked me if I’d be interested in joining. I think— I think I’d be good at it. I want to tryout.”
“Do what?” Dean has to keep his eyes on the road or they’ll be pushed off into the bar ditch by the wind. He has the radio on and tuned to a weather station, and he’s headed west because the storm’s moving east. He hopes it will pass them by soon. This car is not made for sticking to the road in weather like this.
Dean says, “Okay” and looks down at his lap. He skinned his knee the other day when he was trying to run across a fallen log and tripped and fell. It hurt a lot and he cried a little, and Papa told him to “toughen up.”
Sam shakes his head and looks out over the yard, or what he can see of it, backlit in brief bursts of lightning, like someone’s rapidly taking flash photos in a dark room. The rain pelts the windows steadily, and the house shakes with another clap of thunder.
Cas presses a fist to his mouth, overwhelmed. People journey to national parks to commit suicide all the time — his colleagues in busier areas find about one per year, usually hangings or gunshot victims. But in his ten years with the service, Cas has never been the one to find a body. He’s seen death before, yes, but always in expected places. War zones. Hospitals. Never like this, with the cold October air whistling through the trees and the birds chirping contentedly from their nests.
The trill of his phone ringing rouses him from a beer-induced sleep, and he groggily swipes to accept the call without checking the number. No one video calls him other than Sam and Eileen.
Cas is shocked when Dean surges up to kiss him desperately, with a harsher edge than ever before, pressing hard against his lips, one hand coming up to curl possessively around the back of Cas’s neck, holding him in place. The kiss seems to go on much longer than normal, Dean pressing insistently forward, and Cas trying to match his frantic pace but feeling desperately confused and off balance.
They reach the end of the tunnel after a good thirty minutes of walking in silence. It’s caved in, a wall of concrete and rock left by Hellfire and his goons in the bombing that injured Jack. Cas marks it on the map with a sigh, glancing at his watch.
Cas laughs faintly at the memory, thinking of Sam muttering to Ann Marie after a particularly contentious meeting, “Maybe you should start staying home, and I’ll tell them Cas and I are running away together. Come on, let’s just see what happens!”
“Cas, maybe you can try to get a little more out of him?” Jody asks. “I’m worried if this drags out much longer the FBI will pull Leahy, and I don’t have the manpower to run a full-fledged investigation without her.”
“No!” Dean screams again. He tries to bite the man, but his teeth don’t make it through the thick jacket sleeve. The man presses his arm harder into Dean’s chest, holding him back against the seat. “Stop! You’re hurting me!”
“Sheriff, these victims’ heads were nearly severed from their bodies. Most of their blood was drained. That doesn’t seem very ‘accidental’ to me.”
he orders himself as Cas counts change for gas, his lips moving silently in motions that definitely don’t bring to mind other, more erotic activities.
“I can’t walk away.” That’s the crux of it. His father handed him the burden of Halo, and even a decade later as he’s crushed by it, Cas can’t find the strength to shove it off. Dean sighs. Cas wishes he could find the courage to look at him. “It would almost be a relief,” he says, “to have you expose me. Then I wouldn’t have a choice.”
The light pulses faster, like a strobe at a club, distorting the highway around them, hurting Dean’s eyes. Cas doesn’t blink, and Dean tries to pull him back again. The light unfurls in front of them, wrapping around the concrete barricade and crossing over into the second lane of the road.
Cas only slows down enough to skid to a halt on the front lawn, tires spewing mud, dirt and flowers in a wide arc behind him. Ellen’s out there, hair and eyes wild, and she sprints toward him the second he throws the door open.
Dean sits in the car with his hands folded over the whiteboard in his lap, watching the town fly by through the windows. He’s holding his shoulders upright, tense; his eyes scanning the area. Cas wonders if Dean has a military background. Now Cas has seen Dean up and about, he’s noticed Dean holds himself like an Army man, and he’d be the perfect age for a 9/11 recruit. Cas is tempted to pry, but he manages to keep his mouth shut. He knows all too well the hidden baggage that comes with time spent in the service.
“No, but you are the one he responds to. He wouldn’t hardly look at that FBI agent when she came by earlier. I think he likes you.”
He pauses when a waitress comes to the table, but Mary waves her away with a strangled, “Not right now, Gina.” Sam watches the other woman go, then starts up again, not looking at his mother.
His next move is stupid, and he knows it. Cas digs in the toolbox until he finds one of his unused burner phones. He puts in the number for Redwood Memorial.
Ann Marie is reprogramming the house’s Smart System, repeating the command “Start coffee” over and over. Callie, the system, keeps hearing “Stop music.” Cas looks up from the news on his iPad, watching as Sandy throws her head back dramatically and says, “Mooooom!”
They were too late to beat the others here. Dick Roman stands in the bow of a luxury speedboat, arms crossed over his chest and surrounded by bodyguards. Dagon and two of her men are on the beach in front of Roman’s boat. She’s pacing in the sand. The MacLeods sent the largest contingent, a group of large men with burly beards and rough accents, and they’re gathered at the other end of the beach, shooting suspicious glances at Roman and the Demons. Their boat bobs in the waves behind them. Hellfire is nowhere to be seen.
When he was a kid, probably like twelve, John went on one particularly long hunt in Minnesota. A wraith, if Dean remembers correctly. While John hunted, Dean and Sam went to school. And for once Dean didn’t hate it, because he made a friend.
Dean focuses on the center line so hard it starts to blur as he says, “That’s what I was going for.”
He feels his the words getting stuck in his throat, so all he says is, “I need to… I need to go to bed. I can’t do this right now.”
So Cas picks the phone up off the floor and he calls Garth, leaning his head against the window as the ring of the phone matches the ringing in his ears.
Sometimes Dean forgets that he loves his kid brother so much he once sold his soul for him, and he just wants to strangle Sam. He can only be thankful that most innuendos fly right over Cas’s head.
Cas watches Sam’s face, carefully blank in the light of the screen. His friend swallows hard, the only tell that gives him away.
He laughs, sharp and bitter. “That’s rich coming from you. You spent almost fifteen years acting as prison guard to a psychopath just because Chuck asked you to.”
Alastair rolls his eyes and twists his neck from side to side. It pops loudly in the quiet room. “And that is?”
Leahy stands, pushing her chair back over to Bobby’s desk. She brushes her hair back, tightening her ponytail as she says, “I’ve got some ideas for creating leads to follow up on. Sheriff, if you wouldn’t mind walking me out. I’ve got another request for you.”
“We found a room full of these,” Dean says. He gestures with the blade to the yard. “And a bunch of burnt bodies. You’re saying you know what did this?”
“You must be the douchebag from the news.” Claire, as Cas well knows, is inoculated from all forms of male bullshit.
The next time they met, Deacon punched Dean in the face — presumably to help keep their covers as a snarky prisoner and jackass warden. Dean thought he maybe put a little too much
When he walks out into the hallway the others are waiting for him, all four of them leaning against the wall as if they hadn’t just been engaged in brutal hand-to-hand combat against each other. Anna rushes forward to grab his face, holding it between her hands.
“Mary,” she says, all forced politeness. “You have to act like you actually want to be here, at least in front of our customers, or I’ll have to let you go.”
He knows Cas spots the Impala because he whips across the road, pulling the Continental into the dirt next to Baby, not caring about the gravel he kicks up as he parks next to Dean.
Olivia laughs. “As if he doesn’t already hate me for not being ‘committed enough.’ Tara, you know I’m right. It’s wrong, taking those kids—”
Dean looks back toward the mouth of the cave. He holds himself so tensely, like he’s ready to bolt at any second. Cas wants to ask him not to leave, but he knows it would be pointless. Dean’s not his to keep. Not anymore. He rubs at his arm, and Cas almost asks if he needs healing before he goes, but he bites his tongue.
When Eileen comes, she signs “sorry” to Dean as they lead Mama away in handcuffs. Cas holds his hand. Mama sees it. She smiles sadly at him, and all Dean can say is, “I’ll testify for you. I’ll get you out. I’ll do whatever it takes.”
Perhaps it’s time for a new life, one that he chooses. After all, things are better down here on Earth with the people he loves.
She steps forward to hug him then, a motion that always moves Cas. He slowly puts his arms around her.
“I could be an auto mechanic,” he says, thinking of all the fancy sports cars in their old high school parking lot, shiny and new and out of his reach. He imagines fixing cars all day long, taking them apart and making them better. He’d work on way cooler cars than those bright red Mustangs or blue Chargers the rich kids drive. “Or maybe even a teacher.”
“She wouldn’t have had to break you out if she hadn’t put you there in the first place,” Dean says, and his knee starts to bounce, agitated. Cas continues to rub it soothingly, carefully feeling out the edges of the knobby bone with his pointer finger.
Cas lazily opens an eye just a slit, watching Dean as he carefully situates himself on the edge of the bed near Cas’s feet, trying hard not to disturb him too much — and also trying to go easy on his own side, where his rib still smarts. Once he’s seated, Dean balances the bowl in the middle of his lap then gingerly lifts Cas’s ankle, resting it on his leg.
Sam calls out for Dean to wait up, but for some reason he can’t seem to stop moving now that he knows where he’s headed, like there’s a gravitational pull dragging him up the stumpy step to the bunkhouse, in through the door, down the hall. Last room on the left. The door is closed, and Dean, though raised in a car, does have some manners. He knows he should knock, but he doesn’t for some reason, just swings the door wide open.
“Her name is Daphne. Daphne Allen.” Cas sets the mug down on the coffee table, not bothering to put down a coaster, which is unlike him. “We met in college in a freshman orientation class. Our families were from the same area, so on our first break we agreed to drive home together to save money.” Cas leans back, drawing his quilt tighter around his shoulders. “We were good friends all through school, but never anything more. We actually lost track of one another after we graduated for quite some time, although I’d hear her name mentioned on occasion — she became a professor of Biblical history at another Texas university, and academia is a small world, to say the least.”
Rufus may be gruff, and he may put on a hard face for anyone who happens to look his way, but Dean knows he cares about his men. He can see it in the way the old man’s eyes soften, hears it in the deep sigh he lets out. Dean hasn’t won the war, but he won this battle.
“Mr. Novak.” She brushes her red hair behind one ear. It’s a little bit lighter than Anna’s. He smiles at her. “No one mentioned you were coming. Are you here for a photo with the new plaque?”
“Sam! We have to go right now, I need you to...” Dean’s gasping, winded and frightened, and Sam whips the car off the highway, pulling onto a dirt road.
He does wish he could talk to someone, though. Explain that seeing Lisa immediately brought to mind two years of heavenly warfare, the worst mistake of his life, the look in Dean’s eyes when he said, “I wish this changed anything.”
The best news from Sam’s call, at least in Dean’s mind, is that Ben is safe, at least for now. The latest body was a local teenager. Sam got a call from the sheriff’s office about the victim, which also means that the real feds in town hadn’t, at that point, decided to tell the two-bit cops their suspicions that the agents they’d been handing over valuable evidence to might be con men.
“I’m sorry!” Anna peers out from behind Dean’s shoulder. “I wasn’t expecting anybody to be standing there.”
He turns on the lamp on the far table, illuminating the floating dust motes and a shoddy, bloodied trench coat tossed carelessly over the closest chair. His throat constricts.
Speaking of which, Dean’s incredibly tired. Fighting angels and then your brother will do that to you. He yawns, looking over at the alarm clock on the bedside table. They’ve been up all night.
“And you’re a hypocrite. You think because you only stole the grace of one brother that makes you better than me?” Lucifer steps forward, and Dean sees he’s holding a familiar blade, one with a nick on the hilt. Cas’s. Lucifer must have stolen it from him when he was torturing Cas at The Bend. It has blood and grace shining on it, and Dean thinks,
“I’d rather leave Claire out of my life,” he’d said, and Dean had to strongly resist the urge to punch him in the face.
Cas is more excited about this news than he should be, considering the dangers of Dean’s situation. He can’t quite keep down his grin as he says, “I don’t mind that at all. It’s almost nice to have a roommate — one who doesn’t cough up fur balls on my clothes, even if he does burn the toast.”
He’s lost track of the miles he’s run. He’s lost track of where he is, where he’s going, and what he’s looking for.
But Cas called Dean back during the first week of the semester to brag on Sam. He asked how Dean found his cell phone number, which led to a sheepish confession and an offer from Cas — he’d forgive Dean’s invasion of his privacy in exchange for a cup of coffee, so he could meet “the most dedicated sibling I’ve ever heard of.”
His phone is vibrating, rattling against the bedside table. He closes his eye again, trying to pick up that wisp of a dream where Cas came to him at the lake and quoted
Dean chokes out, “They know I’m alive. He’ll find out you were there, he’ll find me, he’ll find you—” Cas reaches out and holds Dean’s wrists, fingers loosely encircling them, and Dean lets him. His head slumps forward, lands on Cas’s shoulder. Cas can feel the wetness of his cheeks through his shirt, feel his chest hitch as he takes in breath after frantic breath.
Three nights passed since their last run-in with the light, but Dean gets chills on the back of his neck every time he leaves the Impala to walk another round up and down the abandoned stretch of the road. Nothing is out of place, and he can hear crickets chirping and cicadas screaming from the trees, but he’s sure someone or something is watching him.
Dean signs something haltingly, and Eileen sighs. “I’m glad you trust me now. But this is over my head.”
“Sam was right,” John admits. “I felt guilty about abandoning him, abandoning Adam — and not telling Sam about Adam in the first place. I’d spent over a decade trying to drink away my guilt for losing track of Dean, and all it did was make my life more of a disaster.”
“No!” Richie gasps as Dean yanks his arm back, his too-long fingernails leaving scratch marks just above Dean’s elbow as they drag down the soft skin there. “You have to help me!”
“This is good,” Dean says, leaning his head back against the headrest and closing his eyes. “Lisa will get Ben out of here today, and we’ll go hunt this fucker tonight. Get everything wrapped up all at once.”
“Ben’s good, yeah. He moved to third base his sophomore year. He won’t play in college, though. He’s going to Ohio State. Wants to be an engineer.”
“I’m getting there,” Sam sounds excited. “It wasn’t the ghost of Perkins that killed Lacey. It was just Perkins!”
“Cas,” he says, and Cas freezes where he stands, toothbrush in hand, clad only in sweatpants, hair still wet from the shower he just took. If he weren’t so angry Dean might laugh at that fact that Cas still considers good dental hygiene important, even in the face of almost certain death. “Cas, you can’t do this.”
“Dean, she’s a nice girl,” Sam says. “She met Cas first; she felt more comfortable with him. And dude, Lisa spent over half of dinner talking about Ben. She loves that kid. Maybe you’re reading too much into it?”
Cas clinks his cup against Dean’s. “To shit dads.” They both drink. Cas puts his mug down, and Dean reaches across the table to wipe the foam away from Cas’s upper lip. Cas’s heart does weird things in his chest.
“Relax,” the demon says, shaking to brush off clinging salt molecules. Sam and Eileen both groan, trying to untangle themselves from each other. “See, they’re fine.”
When the last riff of the song plays out and John Fogerty’s warbling ceases, Dean only feels relief for a moment before the opening notes of “Thank You” start to play.
Cas looks back over his shoulder and Dean notices for the first time the small pile of junk food laid out across the picnic table there. There’s a Snickers bar. It has to be for Dean. Cas got that for him and Dean loves him for it and apparently Lisa invited him to dinner before Sam and Dean interrupted whatever the fuck it was they were talking about and that’s a kick in the gut in so many ways.
He clenches his jaw and glances over at Sam and Cas, who’ve migrated to stand just a few feet away. They both look pathetic, sad, wide eyed with downturned mouths. He’s still angry, but Dean knows who his real family is, and it’s them, his stupid brother and his idiot angel, who always do the wrong things for the right reasons, piling up miscalculated deeds with good intentions until something breaks.
Dean is sitting in his room in the bunker, headphones on, staring blankly at the wall. There are tears in his eyes and a dozen beer bottles littering the nightstand and the floor. Cas moves into his line of sight, unsure of what to expect this time. Dean blinks, and then he smiles.
“No,” Sam says. “We’re not starting those jokes again. What are you calling about? Do you have a case?”
“I live just outside of town,” Cas says, mostly to break the silence. “I have to apologize for the age of the house; sometimes the pipes take a while to warm, and it’s always drafty. It’s peaceful, though. Good view of the mountains.”
Dean also theoretically knows better than to wait for Cas to stop by with donuts and a plan for getting rid of this matter-eating light, yet here he is, as always — waiting.
They hike up to the campground on Lovers’ Lane in companionable silence, which Cas appreciates. Bobby has never been the gabbing type, and neither is he. When Cas turns away from the big pine and fixes his eyes on the ground, Bobby doesn’t comment. He knows what it is to find someone like that on a trail. Bobby still avoids the spot where he found the gunshot victim, and Cas affords him the same respectful silence. They have a mutual understanding now of the pain carried by a bystander, though Cas’s story has thus far had a happier ending.
“Why do you feel that way, Dean?” he asks, and Dean almost laughs because Cas sounds like a fucking therapist sometimes.
Dean narrows his eyes at her, and Sam laughs, somewhat uncomfortably. Mary sighs. Thankfully a waiter comes by just in time to rescue them from the awkward silence, taking drink and food orders before running off again, leaving the Winchesters to sit and stare at one another.
Sam takes a deep breath, trying to fight back his own panic at the idea of Dean driving down the highway in his current state.
Cas just bites his lip and turns his attention back to the TV, allowing an uncomfortable silence to fall. He never lets these conversations get too far. Dean knows it’s a self-protection mechanism, looking away and changing the subject, because he pulls that shit on Sam all the time.
“Yes, you’re in Purgatory Hospital. Don’t give me that look, I dragged your unconscious ass out of a burning building.” She frowns at him. “Yours and Dean’s, so give me a little credit here. You wouldn’t be in the hospital unless we had no other choice. And we didn’t. Jack needed help healing you.”
“It’s payment for the wrongs you have done to the fey. And souls and blood both provide power so I can keep crossing over to this world after my portals are damaged or destroyed.”
Dean hears cows mooing as he reaches the edge of the wood, and he has yet to spot anything unusual or unnatural. He turns to walk the length of the trees, staying close to the border of the open land so he feels less trapped. He can’t shake the feeling he’s being watched, and the hairs along his arms and the back of his neck stand up. He pauses, sweeping his flashlight around the trees.
Dean bursts through the door, which was maybe not such a great plan because it startles Cas, who wakes up with a jump.
Dean stares at him, dumbstruck, and Cas starts to turn away, face red. Dean grabs him by the chin, gently tugging him back. Cas looks afraid, and Dean can’t think of a single thing to say to reassure him, to let him know that no, it’s not too much too soon because they’ve been falling for each other since Dean wrote his name on Cas’s hand in the hospital. He’s never been good with words, so Dean chooses action. He kisses Cas firmly, holding his chin in place, keeping the pressure on until Cas melts into it, relaxing enough to put his hands on Dean’s waist, feather light.
“Hi Mick, thanks for having me.” Cas blinks, sure he can’t be seeing right. But he is — those green eyes are a dead giveaway, and so is that voice. For a moment, he stares dumbfounded and caught up in the strangest sense of deja vu. Zorro is on his television screen, sitting in the Channel 8 news studio with anchor Mick Davies, smiling brilliantly for the camera. Just like that, Cas has a face, an occupation and a name to put to the voice — Dean Smith, reporter,
The fairy ring shines in the faint light filtering through the trees as the two men make their way toward the quiet highway, holding on to each other as they go.
When she turns her brown eyes back to him her gaze is piercing. Cas can see Lisa’s fear there, her love for her son, her hope that these random men will help her.
“I’m tired,” he admits, and he is. Too tired to hold the thought in anymore. Dean’s words from this morning are ringing in his head.
“Yes,” Cas admits. He shakes his head. “She’s had a lot on her mind lately. And she’s not thrilled you know I’m Halo.”
Cas is perched on the edge of the bed when Dean comes out of the bathroom, still in nothing but boxers, his feet held carefully off the floor. He’s so worn and lost, curled in on himself and looking at his hands, that Dean forgets his libido for a second.
Cas smiles, a small thing. “I didn’t notice.” His face falls then, and he says, “Dean, what are we going to do? About us, about... the light or the will-o’-the-wisp or... about everything?”
Mary watches Ellen Weatherby closely, arm wrapped tightly around the older woman. She found Ellen in a field after following a trail of bodies. Luckily she was able to exorcise the demon inside her without further bloodshed, but Ellen's clearly shell-shocked, shaking and breathing heavily. She saw and heard everything — the screams of the people murdered by her hands, the terror brought on by her black eyes, the hateful words the demon spit at her husband.
He tries to hold on to his anger at his own mother for the rest of the night, but he just can’t get the face of that crying woman out of his mind. In the morning, he goes downstairs and hugs his mother tight around her stomach. When she asks him what’s wrong, he can’t explain.
“Dean,” Cas starts, but Dean just shakes his head and brushes past him into the house, not even looking Cas in the eyes.
“Dean Winchester,” the man says, shaking his head. “Hold on, hold on. I have a message for you to deliver, then I’ll let you go.”
“I can’t imagine him grown-up,” she confesses. “We don’t do much on his birthday. Light a candle, say a prayer. But I think about him all day, try to imagine him looking like this.” She stares at the photo. “It’s hard to picture. I think he had more prominent freckles, but I can't remember for sure.”
“Fuck,” Cas whispers. He pushes himself off the glass-covered floor, wincing as a shard gets stuck in his palm, and starts to run.
Cas stops, closes his eyes. He was briefly so happy, just minutes ago. Dean looked happy too, bright in this place full of greenery to match his eyes. They were happy before they started talking about Lisa. Before Dean asked about his siblings.
The sense of utter rejection that washes over Dean surprises him. He balls up his napkin in one fist, trying not to squash the sandwich in the other. Stupid, to expect James to just say, “Yes, of course I’ll come with you, and then I’ll reunite with Claire!” That’s not how life works. Dads are shitty. Dean of all people knows that.
Chuck picks idly at a stray string on the comforter as he says, “I found what I was looking for, thanks to you two. And I took what I wanted.”
Hours have passed when she tries again. Her knock this time is louder, much more insistent, still their “code” (two short knocks, one long one) but somehow angry.
Ben pulls Lisa back in to his side with one arm, and she smiles faintly at Dean as Ben reaches his other hand out.
“No, actually.” Cas offers Benny a faint smile as the other man sets his drink on the table. “You were right. I’d stopped paying attention to the Foundation. I know this is going to sound entitled and insane, but I have more money than I know what to do with. I’m used to letting other people handle it and not thinking about it too much.”
Dean’s never been that great at following orders that come from someone other than John Winchester. He jogs to reach James, not bothering to hide his heavy footfalls. He doesn’t want to get stabbed, after all.
“That’s impossible,” he says, and Mills watches him carefully. “The Demons were rooted out, destroyed by the original Halo. She can’t be…”
“Dean!” he snaps, and Eileen must be watching, too, because she crawls into the back and cradles Dean’s face in her hands.
Ignoring the pit that forms in his stomach at the last part of that sentence, Cas says, “Sounds like you were close.”
And now they’re headed back there, with no plan, just a couple of weapons — the demon knife, the gun Dean always carries on him. And he knows that he can’t take Cas back to The Bend like this, still healing and his grace run out. That’s not a risk he’s willing to take.
But Samuel says, “I know she’s upset about the dissolution of her marriage. Anyone would be. But it might be a good thing that she’s withdrawn from you in her grief. Your dependence on each other was bordering on childish. It’s heartening for me to watch you outgrow it at last.”
“Don’t leave him,” she says, and her voice is far away, down a tunnel, shouting out at him from across a void. “He needs you. It has to be you, Castiel. It’s always going to be you.”
He swallows, hard. Cas doesn’t talk about this, ever, but today Dean’s laid it all out there for him. The least he can do is show some reciprocity. “My first job in the parks service, I worked in a much larger park than this one. There was a river running through it, and it would flood in the rainy season.” If he closes his eyes, he can still hear the roar of the water tumbling down the mountainside. “There were warning signs posted everywhere telling campers when to avoid the river, but we couldn’t really keep people from trying to fish or even kayak on it. The emergency calls when the waters were high were a daily occurrence.”
“Oh, just— Taking it all in, I guess.” Cas takes a swig from the cup when Bobby hands it to him, passing it right back with a cough. “God, who made that?”
The building across the street from his parked car is dead. No one’s walked in or out in the past six hours. If the vampire nest that’s supposed to reside in this warehouse is still active, then they all must be hibernating.
His eyes turn red again, sliding over to Cas, and Cas hates that there’s a small part of him that wants to put his head down, take a step back.
Alicia and Max don’t ask him questions about what they’re doing beyond the standard “Is this the right way to say this incantation in Enochian?” They don’t ask why he’s giving up his angelhood, why Dean doesn’t yet know. On days when he seems saddened by his loss, they’ll try to cheer him up. On the days when he’s more excited about becoming a human, they ask him questions about his plans for the future.
, really, because all he does is work — but she’s assisted the park service rangers on occasion, and vice versa. Anything big that happens in Cas’s jurisdiction is technically purview of the FBI, but most of the smaller stuff — like attempted suicide — they’re ready to pass off to the locals. The last suicide in the park, a gunshot victim found by Bobby not ten yards off the main trail three years ago, was worked jointly between their offices. There’s no bad blood between the park rangers and the county sheriff’s department, which is more than Cas can say for many of the other areas he’s worked in.
“Hey,” Dean says once he’s swallowed his bite. “Look, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot here. You’re right, I don’t know anything about you other than you’re Claire’s dad and you disappeared a while back. And hell, maybe you have your reasons, or you think you do, for not getting in touch with her. But she’s a good kid, and I care about her.” James closes his eyes and tilts his head back against the building, but Dean keeps talking. “So yeah, I think you should talk to her, but I can’t make you. But maybe you can help me understand what’s happening here.”
“I don’t know his real name.” Creaser looks and sounds as if he’s somewhere far away, his eyes unseeing as he stares across the room. “He introduced himself as Wayne Whittaker, ’s all I ever called him. I walked into his circle back in ‘71, and he told me he’d let me go — if I promised to protect the ring.”
, he always knew Cas hid a fine body under his too-big suits and his lumpy trench coat. He watches the water run down Cas’s tanned back and his perfect ass, and he swallows hard before opening the shower door and stepping right into the spray, wrapping his arms around Cas from behind.
“Your sign language is improving,” Cas says lightly. “Pretty soon you might not need to talk to her.”
“For a bit. I lost track of his trail quickly in the dark. And I didn’t want to follow him into some sort of trap, if that was his intention.”
Cas tilts his head in confusion, which Dean takes to mean the noise cancelling function works fine. He pulls the headphones off Cas’s head, leaving his hair a mess where they drag through it. Dean resists the urge to run his fingers over the unruly locks by curling them into a fist.
“Castiel Novak.” Cas reaches out a hand for the man to shake. He takes it. His grip is strong and his palms are calloused. Cas would bet he’s the only man in this room with callouses on his hands. “I don’t believe we’ve had the pleasure of meeting.”
“I can talk to him,” Dean says, pulling his arm away. “He doesn’t want me or he would’ve taken me by now. He’s had plenty of chances.”
“Because the ritual is somewhat unsteady and I didn’t want to worry you unnecessarily; because I knew it would be fine. The Banes are very capable witches.” Cas is entirely unsure why Dean still looks so upset — and not angry, just sad. Almost frightened. “Dean, this next meeting is likely to be the last time they’ll need to see me to pull the grace out, you can come with me and see it for yourself or...”
Dean gestures from Cas’s Italian leather loafers to his tailored suit jacket. “You look like you’ve just returned on private jet from fucking Rome, man. Of course you like cappuccino.”
“Samuel—” John starts in a warning tone that makes Dean’s hackles rise. Sam doesn’t seem concerned in the least.
“Yes,” Cas says sadly, “she did. So I stayed. I came to this epiphany three years after my accident, and it took her another two years to ask for a separation. I tried to love her. I tried to force it, but she could tell. She knew all my memories were back and our relationship had changed, and she knew I wasn’t in love with her. And it hurt her, and I hated myself for it. One day she’d had enough.”
“How do you know how long a surveillance mission should take?” Bobby throws his hands in the air. “Fine, keep panicking. I’m gonna raid your fridge. Consider it payback for all the food Dean’s taken from me at the office.”
When it’s over and they’re tangled together, limbs crossed and noses pressed against each other, Cas makes a mistake.
Dean knows he should be on board with that plan, but the thought of driving across the state in one go when he’s already so exhausted by this mess with Cas and Lisa makes him push back.
He doesn’t really expect a response, but he gets one a few minutes later, a “You’re most welcome ;)” that eases some of the tension he’d been feeling. When he’d pulled Lisa aside and told her why he felt like she should be with Dean, she’d looked so disappointed. When she’d said, “That’s not what I want. It’s not what he wants, and I don’t think that’s what you really want. What do you want, Cas?” Cas hadn’t known how to respond.
It’s a miracle Dean manages to park mostly within the lines. Sam is up and out quickly, shutting the door harder than necessary and walking over to Cas and Lisa.
“Okay, okay, Dean, listen to me. You need to calm down. Pull over somewhere safe, all right? Eileen and I are on 281 — we’re almost to the bunker. We’ll come find you, get you home.”
Dean cradles the amulet in his palms as if it’s something precious. Something familiar. The look on his face is unlike any Cas has seen him wear before — his mouth parted in shock, eyes slightly watery.
Cas ignores the ambiguity of “people” in favor of fixating on the horror of the rest of that sentence. “Did you?” he asks, hoping the answer is no.
“It makes sense,” she says, gesturing to the tense faces below. “They despise each other. Even those who think they’re working together.”
“Oh, just fine.” Donna leans against the doorframe, settling in to discuss her day. Cas stuffs his hands in his pockets, prepared for a long delay before he can get to Dean. “Jody’s been real vague about what exactly it is we’re guarding against. Can’t say as I blame her, seeing how Doug always gets a big mouth around the press, but I’d sure like to know why a John Doe gets a police escort.”
Sam has always been naturally patient at unwrapping gifts, willing to take his time to cleanly slide his nails under the tape, careful not to tear the paper too badly. For Dean, though, he put on a show, ripping off the wrapping as fast as he possible, because Sam learned from a young age that made Dean feel good. Like seeing Sam so excited he couldn’t wait to open his gifts was a gift right back to Dean. Sam feels like Cas might be the same way, so he ignores his base instincts and clears all of the newspaper away in one go.
“I need to get more food,” he says, watching the water in the coffee pot boil. “I usually eat out, but I thought we’d go shopping today anyway. We can get groceries while we’re out.”
“Dean.” He puts everything into the word, the name he loves above all names. His concern, his understanding, his love. Cas sets the spell book down and quickly crosses the room, kneeling in front of Dean and gently pulling his hands away from his face.
Leahy is unperturbed by Bobby’s overcompensating grumpiness. She leans forward, elbows on her knees, and says, “I’d like you all to be consultants on this case.”
“It was just Seth and a woman,” he says finally. “She was tall, and she had a scar here.” He points absently to his arm. “They took turns, but Seth did most of the work. He taunted me, usually just telling me I should ask my father to save me. Then he said that I was getting what I deserved for my crimes.” Cas takes a shuddering breath. “That if you knew what I was, I would already be dead at your hand.”
This is how it’s going to be for the rest of his life, after all — only getting a small taste of what could have been when he sleeps.
Their mother would stay, beg for forgiveness, promise that she loves them. Mary doesn’t feel like a mother. She doesn’t feel like anyone. She's only numb.
trip. Castiel asks, “Why did you say yes?” and Dean tells him. He tells him about Jack, Sam, Lucifer. Mary, Bobby, Charlie. He tells Castiel about the other version of himself, the man he loves. This Castiel listens, a sad smile on his face.
Dean thinks of Mandy the waitress calling Cas handsome and Cas not recognizing the flirtation. Cas almost died that day. Cas told them he loved them that day. Dean can’t remember what he said in response. He stabs into his pie with more force than necessary, eating half a slice so Sam will stop looking at him like a kicked puppy.
” He tilts his head again, unnervingly seeming to look at the camera from under those lifeless eyes. “Roman — all the money in the world can’t buy respect for a man who can’t handle his own business. The Demons — you’re nothing but a pack of dogs chasing after scraps. You come out of hiding thinking you’ll be back at the top of the food chain, planning to use Roman’s money to do it. But you have no real leader and no real plan. Halo would easily defeat you, if I weren’t planning on getting there first and doing it a lot more
“It’s broken,” Cas says, because he doesn’t have a lot of tact. Dean elbows him in the ribs, but he presses on. “What happened?”
Mama looks into his eyes, her own bright with tears. She takes his hands in hers again, squeezing them the way she did when he was a child and she was trying to teach him sign language. “I hope you will.”
Sam and Cas stand behind him, and even though he can’t see them Dean knows they’re waiting to see what he’ll do. He’s barely spoken to them in the past 24 hours, and if a part of him wondered if his earlier anger was unjustified, he doesn’t wonder anymore.
Dean drops to the floor to get underneath the smoke, but it’s useless. The fire in the former living room cracks and snaps and rages, and the heat creates an instant layer of sweat all over his body. The smoke burns his throat and lungs. He hacks and crawls and moves away from the flames toward the back of the house, where surely there must be a window or a door he can escape through. The edge of his pants leg catches fire somehow, and he feels it licking at his skin, peeling it away in strips that bubble up like packing plastic. It does not feel freeing. It reminds him of Hell.
Cas thinks of the way Dean’s spoken of his mother in the past, like a ghost haunting his memories, and reevaluates everything he knows about Dean once again. “She’s alive?”
Garth told the crowd about a case he worked with the Winchesters where they all got wasted to hunt down a Japanese monster that was only visible if you were drunk. Joe, a hunter friend of Cas and Sam’s, talked about the time Sam got caught salting and burning a cat’s body to kill its ghost on particularly weird case and told the police he was just a huge fan of Stephen King’s “Pet Sematary.” Krissy shared the story of the time Sam tried to teach her how to shoot a grenade launcher, only to be knocked back on his ass by the kickback.
Finding Dean wasn’t a second chance because Cas will never get back what he lost that day, but helping Dean still feels a bit like redemption.
Dean picks it up, a considering look on his face. “I can probably run the part about fixing the situation and the ‘I do care’ when I write about your changes to the board.”
“Jody and Jo were out there.” Well, that’s a relief. At least the Rangers didn’t ask the county judge to put Jody on administrative leave. “They re-routed us back down County Road 2562. But Dean, what if it was —”
And on the screen is a picture of Seth Harkins, a 20-something blond with a wide grin, wearing a University of Nebraska sweater at a football game. Healthy, happy — still incredibly familiar.
“We’re going to need a delayed cause warrant,” he hears Reidy says to Jody, and Jody says, “I’ve never asked for one before,” in a tone that says she doesn’t like his idea.
Sam clears his throat, loudly, awkwardly, and damn, he can sneak around a monster-infested warehouse like nobody’s business and still never be subtle when it really counts.
Cas’s hands tense on the wheel, knuckles whitening. He’s already apologized and he’s tired of rehashing the same old argument. “You wanted to be more involved. This is your chance.”
), but Gwen’s crafty. She pushes his back just as they get going, and Dean has to windmill his arms to avoid crashing face first into the brush. She darts around him, nimble as a fox, barking a loud “HA” over her shoulder as she goes.
Dean landed on top of Cas, covering him from head to toe, and it says a lot about what he just experienced that he’s in no hurry to move.
“And I’m sorry for implying you’d be fine with collateral damage. I watched you on the bus, rescuing people. I know you try, too.” Cas rubs at his temple. “We both do. So if my issue is hesitation, then yours is… recklessness.”
“Yeah, in England they used to call them ‘fairy fire.’ Travelers would say they saw people holding the lights, trying to lead them off the path into the woods. But the real evidence for this theory we should consider is the more well-known myth of the fairy ring.”
“Y’know, it wasn’t all about finding Chuck and Alastair.” Cas’s fingers still. “It was in the beginning, yeah, but— I don’t know, around the time you came to the library I realized that I couldn’t imagine you leaving me there on purpose. I don’t know why I ever thought you did.”
Then bright headlights flashing across the parking lot and right into their faces blind them. Cas and Lisa both blink, raising their hands to block the glare.
Cas thinks of a black feather, carried with him in mind. Of worried hands, gently holding his face, holding him up. Of thousands of prayers, earnest and longing. Of phone calls and confessions, truths just for him to hear. Of a coat, carefully carried and folded, to be handed back to him at just the right time. Of forgiveness, so often necessary and always given. He thinks of that small smile on Dean’s face, growing larger still as he sings “Higher Love” under his breath, off-key and content.
“Oh, Dean.” Cas’s heart breaks for him. He reaches one hand up to push his fingers gently through Dean’s hair. “She does love you.”
Cas just looks at him, so sad and small when he says, “I don’t know, Dean. I’ve wondered the same thing for years. When I saw you at The Bend I thought I might finally have the chance to get everything off my chest, to ask you
“Like it?” Lucifer gestures to his rotting vessel. “Took me several days to find a new one. That’s the problem with humans — shoddy construction. I kept burning through the others in seconds. Even poor Seth was really starting to fall apart there at the end. You know, I thought maybe I finally won the lotto with him — member of one of my secondary vessel lines and all that — but he just couldn’t hold all that new grace together.”
for almost a decade now, and he runs right into Cas. Dean sweeps him up in his arms wordlessly, grasping Cas to his chest and twining his fingers into the hair at the nape of his neck, mouth wet against Cas's throat as he says, “Fuck,
Castiel talks even more formally on the phone, like the method of communication changes his delivery. Or maybe he’s just uncomfortable speaking with Mary. That’s probably more likely.
Dean finds Cas standing outside of the cabin, watching the sun set over the lake. Mary and Sam and Kelly are inside, waiting for the baby to come, and all Dean cares about is figuring out what the fuck is going on with Cas.
“I tried to reach him, and I couldn’t. If Jody loses her license over this I’ll never forgive myself. He was my interview.”
After Lisa returned and the three of them shared a stilted, silent breakfast in the hatchback, Dean and Cas explained to her that they now knew what was likely killing the teenagers, and as long as Ben stayed away from the river at night he’d be fine. Lisa was obviously relieved — she planned to go get Ben before nightfall, just a day earlier than her original schedule. She told them she would stay in the parking lot of the campsite anyway and call them if she saw anything out of the ordinary.
“Okay, but you gotta get out of the dirt with your feet like that, man.” Dean looks pointedly at Cas’s muddy socks. “So either let me carry you or sit on the porch or something.”
“Yes, but I didn’t know that at the time. We cornered one of the angels, and he kept talking about how all humans are good for is providing energy.” Mary takes another drag off her cigarette. “Then he talked about Castiel. How he’d found his own permanent residence with two of the most powerful souls in the universe, how smart that made him.”
. “Look, Cas, I’m not giving him much. But the kid needs some walking around money for when he does get out on his own, and I’ve seen how he drags his feet about accepting anything from you. And he’s very attached to you.” Bobby raises his eyebrows, and Cas looks away,
And it is. It is significant. Cas has always been there, from that day he burst into that barn and turned Dean’s worldview upside down till now. Even when Dean was sure he was gone forever, even when Cas showed up late, he’s always come back. To Dean. And Dean has always waited for him.
Pushing himself up slowly, Cas lets the blanket fall from his shoulders to pool in his lap. He cringes as he leans against the headboard, then gestures to his bandaged chest.
“Oh, Castiel. I shoved him into every terrible moment in his life but this—” He laughs as he sets his hand almost tenderly on the neck of the unconscious Dean, the real Dean. “This future is what convinced him to give up and stop fighting.”
“I know who the Winchesters are.” Her dark eyes narrow even more, something Dean previously would have thought impossible. “Wait here.”
“Are you sure?” Cas manages to ask, staring at the photo of the child, the name ringing in his ears.
Dean’s head can’t take this many emotions. It’s starting to ache, right at the front, along his forehead. He rubs a temple, and he can see Cas looking at him from the corner of his eye.
Before the demon can reach the trap light floods the room, so blindingly bright Sam and Eileen have to close their eyes. It can’t be lightning because it lasts much longer, a continuous blaze that Sam can see through his closed eyelids. Over the howling wind he thinks he hears the demons scream.
“You’ll like Henriksen,” Reidy is saying. “Sharp man. Should’ve stuck with the Bureau, but there’s money to made in the private sector.” Dean stiffens, and Cas snaps, “Do you all need anything else from Dean, or can we expect a call from you tomorrow as promised?”
“Fine,” she echoes his own sentiment, “but I’m doing this to protect the family and to ensure the charity’s integrity, not because you’re pulling your crush’s pigtails.”
“What was it?” Cas asks, confused as to why Dean would try to punch an FBI agent over a letter from his mother.
They stare at each other. One crying, dying; the other impassive, immovable. Then the group surrounding the hanging tree filters into the woods, disappearing into the brush one by one. Leaving him to die alone.
“Is that true?” Steve asks Dean, and there’s a crack in his calm, a barely controlled rage. Dean can hardly nod.
Cas’s spine stiffens, and his eyes dart to the left, toward the back stairwell. Dean’s watching him carefully.
He remembers everything. Cas snaps to turn the bedside lamp on and rolls over. Dean groans, hiding his face in the crook of his elbow.
“Cas? Cas!” Dean scrambles to switch his gun to his non-dominant hand, reaching out for Cas’s trench coat sleeve and missing. Cas continues forward, unblinking, eyes fixed on the light.
Cas looks at Dean and blinks, once, twice, like he’s not sure how to process that and his emotional sensors are short-circuiting. Sam is giving Dean the Did You Really Just Say That face in the rearview mirror.
Dean’s discharge is set for 10 a.m., and Cas reaches the hospital at 9:30. He’s outside of visiting hours, but no one seems to care. There’s no deputy at the door to Room 204, but Cas spots the back of Leahy’s FBI-labeled jacket before he’s made it down the hall. She’s standing at the foot of Dean’s bed, in the middle of a one-sided argument.
“And you are?” Dean touches Cas’s elbow, trailing his hand down Cas’s forearm to tangle their fingers together, squeezing and letting go.
Sam recognized that look. It was the look of a Dean who wasn’t all there. He snapped his fingers in his brother’s face and Dean blinked, startled.
Dean keeps the pace slow and steady, covering Cas’s neck and cheeks and forehead with kisses, dipping down to kiss his mouth every time Cas angles his head for it. They’re both breathing heavily, not saying anything, but it strikes Dean that with other partners he never really gets this close, preferring to fuck at a certain distance, not share every breath.
“Sam!” Dean shouts, stumbling backwards and out of the room, scrambling toward his bag, which holds — well, a gun and the demon knife. Most of his gear is at the bunker or in the trunk of the Impala. “Sammy!”
“He told me once that he was human for a while,” Claire says, rolling the jar between her palms. “His favorite food was peanut butter and jelly, but he liked the peanut butter best. He said it tasted like molecules once he became an angel again.”
“Okay,” Dean says, moving toward the end of the bed. “You’ve got painkillers in your system already, I’m guessing?” He doesn’t want to be the one to make Cas hurt.
“Yes,” he says, “but the rest of the planning is up to you two, with Anna’s help. I’m going to be a bit preoccupied tonight.”
“Security is escorting everyone out,” she says briskly. “I ordered them to keep people out of the back stairwell. I assume that’s how you escaped the masses?”
“Claire,” Ellen and Anna say at the same time in warning tones, but she pays them no attention. “You need to tell us everything you know about the Demons.” Claire looks at Anna. “You too. Because I know you’re both hiding something from me and Jack. You know Dagon. You clearly knew their other leader, Azazel or whatever. And I want to know what Cas meant when he said he couldn’t let Dean die again.”
So Eileen explains how Mary contacted her under the pretense of needing help on a case. Turns out she’s still in Kansas, puttering around Topeka and taking on minor cases. She told Eileen she’s not working for the British Men of Letter anymore. “Never again,” Mary said. “They hurt my family.”
In the midst of a hunt, Dean had reluctantly turned her down, asking, “Tomorrow?” She’d slid him her number on a bar napkin.
“Well, don’t go off on your own again,” Dean says, and he grabs Cas’s hand. “Stay with me, and we face this shit together."
“He looks like he’s going to pass out,” Eileen says grimly, and Sam whips into a parking spot, not caring that the Impala’s crooked and Dean would bitch about it if he were fully lucid. He turns to see Eileen slapping lightly at Dean’s cheeks, but his brother’s eyes are unfocused, staring into the distance. “Dean,” she says, and Sam calls out his name, too. Dean blinks slowly, then looks at Sam, eyes watering like he’s about to cry.
“Thank you,” Cas breathes into the radio, though it’s unnecessary. Bobby’s probably already on the radio with the park service medics, and next he’ll be calling 911 to get an ambulance to the bottom of the trail.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been here, wherever here he is. There is no time here, in the blackness that envelops him. There’s nothing but Dean and the Darkness, here to bide all of eternity.
“I don’t know,” he says. He’s looking down. “I had some ideas — Enochian spells, mainly — written in my notebook but...” Cas trails off.
Dean thinks, sometime later when they’re all lounging around the room, drinking and shooting the breeze now that they’ve finished discussing the case.
“It will be okay,” he whispers to Dean under his breath as Reidy pulls out a thin notepad and starts taking notes furiously. “They’re just trying to figure out what they’re dealing with.” But it feels like a lie, even to him.
But he can’t. He’s spent nearly two decades of his life waiting for his revenge, and he’ll get it if it kills him. Again. Dean breathes in deeply, forcing his eyes to flick back to green.
Ann Marie opens her mouth as if she wants to protest, but before she can say anything Sandy sticks her head out of the passenger window and yells, “Uncle Cas!”
“I tried, I tried, but there’s nothing. No calls are going through. I can't get any service out here. I just want to go get him. I need to go get him.”
“Cas! Cas!” Dean’s voice almost sounds like it’s just another one of those thoughts, but no, that’s not quite right. Dean wasn’t holding onto his shoulders tightly, propping him up, gazing at him with that concern written across his face, not in any of those terrible memories.
Dean hangs up. Two years since they met and Cas’s voicemail is the same as it was the first time Dean called him.
Claire stretches, arms held high above her head and fingers interlocked. “I wanted to talk to you,” she says.
“What now?” Dean asks. Cas hugs him closer. He swears he can still feel Jack, warm and pleased and smiling. Bringing them back to each other one last time.
Dean is shaking now, and he’s on the verge of tears. Again, Cas’s chest swells with rage toward those who hurt him. He tries to wrangle it back, for Dean’s sake if nothing else. He says, injecting a calm he doesn’t feel into his voice, “He’s just a man. I understand your hesitation, but maybe she could help if you told her the situation.
“It’s okay, man,” Dean says. “Water under the bridge, right? Just... I didn’t know. I want to know.”
Cas missteps as Zorro finishes his rant, catching the edge of Zorro’s dress shoes — which, now that he looks down, he can see are scuffed at the edges. “You do realize,” he says, looking back up into Zorro’s inscrutable eyes, “that I am technically a Shurley?”
“He knows I’m gay,” Caleb says, “and he— He practically said that he’d seen us leave the mess together that night, man.” Caleb’s forehead is covered in a fine sheen of sweat, and Dean’s sure he’s sweating enough to match it. “He said, ‘I know you and Dean have been
“Why didn’t you tell me if it’s not a bad thing?” Dean asks haltingly, moving his chin out of Cas’s grasp.
“Steve,” Michael protests, and Cas tries not to think about how the name grates, even after all these years. It’s his name now and for the rest of his life.
“Yes,” Cas says, uneasy. “You were with me when we saw the interview he did with Mick Davies. I thought you knew.”
When Pa leaves the room, Dean’s knees give out and he falls all the way to the floor, collapsing with his face pressed into his mattress. He breathes sharply, in through the nose, out through the mouth, and tells himself
“But it kind of is,” Dean interrupts. He watches his hands, turning them over. They’re calloused, bruised. The bones seem more fragile than before, poking at translucent skin. Easily breakable, like they would have shattered had he hit Sam. “You think I gave up on Cas, then gave up on everything. But I didn’t. I prayed, Sam — I begged Chuck to bring them back. All of them — Cas, Mom, even Crowley. And I got nothing.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Bobby says. “Garth swore up and down he needed a new one. Glad to save the taxpayers that expense.”
“Why?” Leahy signs and speaks, and she gestures to the bed where a small blackboard rests on Dean’s lap, unused. “They tried to kill you. You don’t need to protect them.”
“It’s —” Cas swirls a hand in the air like that can encompass everything he can’t, or won’t, explain. “An appointment I can’t miss.”
“There aren’t any lights in here, sorry fellas. We did search the place after Brock Anderson’s body was found. Didn’t see much but a dead guy.”
Cas sits silent on the bed near the window, eyes glued to his hands like they hold the secret to life, or the secret as to how he and Dean can even stand to be in the same town as the woman whose memory they conspired to erase.
“But Christian did?” Cas notices she’s signing slowly as she talks, perhaps trying to teach Dean even as he’s struggling to speak.
This time he knows it’s a dream, so he’s spared the inevitable pain of the realization that no, everything he’s ever wanted is not lying next to him on his memory foam mattress, staring at him without guile.
He smiles when he catches sight of Eileen, curled in toward Sam. She’s pushed him back into the wall, and his too-long hair is a matted nest from rubbing up against the wall all night. Of course those two couldn’t be apart, even for a night. If they weren’t so happy together, Dean would be jealous.
He wonders when Dean calls him the next day whether he should answer. Demand a direct apology, demand an explanation. He worries if he does speak to Dean all his resolve will crumble, and he’ll go home to be a person-shaped punching bag once more.
Cas expected Dean to yell at him right away. He sits on their bed, very still, while Dean carefully closes the door, checks the locks and then slowly starts pulling off his clothes. Jacket, undershirt, boots, socks, pants. He folds them all carefully while standing in his underwear, his back to Cas as he stacks his clothes neatly into his duffle bag.
Now all three Winchesters, including Sam, are staring at him. Dean’s so tired of all the staring. He looks at Mary, because he’s not sure he could handle speaking to anyone else. “I think I’m going to go back with Cas,” he says quietly.
“What have you done?” she snaps, and Dean flinches, but there’s nowhere for him to hide. He can’t turn into the man’s jacket again, because the man is not safe, and this strange woman is angry at him and he’s done nothing wrong. He starts to cry.
There's one person who’s allowed to seek him out at these functions, and she’s making her way through the crowd now. Cas follows the flash of red hair as his sister Anna dodges a handshake from the mayor and a hug from Dick Roman, twisting in their grasp with a polite but edgy smile. Anna’s never liked being touched, and yet all the men in the room seem to want to put their hands on her. She’s beautiful in a fragile-looking way — pale skin, thick red hair, thin and fine-boned — but Cas would put his money on her in a fight any day, if it were to come to that. It won’t. This is a polite gathering, and she’s managed to avoid being entrapped by purposefully twisting through the crowd to get to him, her mask slipping down over one ear until it’s adorably lopsided.
Green Eyes leans back and closes his eyes, signaling the end of their odd, mostly one-sided conversation. Jody grabs Leahy’s elbow before she can say anything else, gently pulling her out of the room, murmuring something to her in the hall, too low for Cas to hear.
When Cas comes Dean feels it first, spilling over his own dick and both of their stomachs. Cas has a sort of delayed reaction to orgasms, silently riding the first wave before gasping through the rest. Dean can’t see him in the darkness of the room, but he hears him, and that pushes Dean rapidly toward his own release. There’s nothing mind-blowing about this particular orgasm, but Dean’s eyes start to water as Cas pulls him impossibly closer, holding him through it and whispering endearments to the top of his head.
Gwen stares up at him through her bangs, lips pursed judgmentally. “I thought you were supposed to be supervising them.”
“What are you doing to get him to talk?” Eileen asks, and it’s clear from her tone of voice that “torture” would very much be the wrong answer.
On the other hand, making a scene would send a clear message to Roman that Halo knows what he's been doing and put him on high alert for the future.
“Like he started yelling in my bar.” She cocks a single, blonde eyebrow in the most unimpressed gesture Cas has ever seen — which is saying something, considering the household he grew up in and the man he currently works for. “Saying he knew Dean was a regular here, someone must have seen him. I handled it like I handle all the troublemakers.”
“As much as I’d like to see our beloved Squirrel come down from space, you know she won’t help you unless you give her something in return — something being the Book of the Damned. And I know that it’s gone the way of the First Blade, lost forever, because you, Castiel, are an unimaginative, sanctimonious do-gooder, even when abandoned by the rest of the holy high-rollers. Too afraid of power to take it even when it’s right under your nose. So, to put it indelicately, it appears you’re shit out of luck, angel.”
He knows what’s going to happen once he steps out of this room. He saw the look on Cas’s face when he fell back into the wood, the relief and the...
Dean rearranges them a bit, pulling Cas up to rest on his shoulder, tucked under his chin so he can kiss the top of Cas’s head. Dean takes a deep, steadying breath.
“She didn’t ask me to contact you,” Eileen says. “I think she just wanted to make sure you were doing okay, or maybe she hoped I would mention her to you.”
Dean was in the midst of a major tailspin when they first met — a month removed from the disastrous break-up with Cassie, three months removed from his last real phone call with his father, two years removed from any contact with Sam. Even when John would send him a message, it was brief — “Hunt in Cheyenne,” “Look up how to kill a wraith,” “Meet me in three weeks in Tallahassee.” Dean would listen to those voicemails and wonder,
Donna takes pity on Cas and waves him off, saying “I’ll keep an eye on him, don’t you worry!” as he goes.
“Cas,” he whispers, as if keeping quiet might keep the light away, “Cas, wake the fuck up.” Without taking his eyes off the light, Dean reaches out with the hand nearest Cas and slaps him on the knee.
“My holding you back is the only thing keeping you alive.” The room falls silent. Anna stares at him, Balthazar downs the whiskey glass he must have brought from upstairs, and Claire fumes. Then she turns on her heel and stalks out, boots stomping across the glass floor. She doesn’t look back, and the door to the basement slams behind her.
Cas sighs and pulls up the park’s budget spreadsheet for the year. It’s extensive, but he made it so he knows where everything is. He moves to the line for equipment repairs and cringes. As he expected, they went over budget fixing the cracked cylinder on the truck’s engine. He’s got to move money around if they expect to fix the generator this year, and Cas doesn’t know where that money will come from. It seems like they get less and less federal funding every year. His hopes of hiring another Ranger seem pretty far-fetched the longer he looks at the spreadsheet. The numbers blur and meld together, taunting him —
It does bother him he’s four nights in with no sign of the saboteur. Four nights of drinking shitty coffee Sam stuffed in his hands on his way out the door. Four nights of trying not to fall asleep as he stares at the light, counting how many times it flickers from red to green and back. Four nights of endless Led Zeppelin and Queen and Bob Seger, singing off-key to keep himself awake as nothing happens around him.
“I’d like to go to the car,” Cas says quietly, as if he speaks softly enough the light won’t hear him.
“You have no idea the sacrifices I have made for this city,” Cas snarls. “The money and time and effort spent in the hopes of making Purgatory better. It takes everything I give it and it swallows it all up and spits it out in my face. I am doing my best, and I’m sorry if my best isn’t enough to impress you.”
Dean hesitates, then shakes it. He wants to tell Ben, “This is not the first time you’ve been in this kind of situation, and every time you’ve tried to protect others first.” Wants to tell Ben how smart and funny and brave he’s always been, how Dean has never forgotten him and will always have a soft spot in his heart for him. But he can’t.
“Nebraska FBI and local police say they’re not ready to call the recent string of deaths by fire the work of a serial killer,” Sam reads aloud. “Seven people in the state, from Lincoln to North Platte, have gone missing in the past week, only to be found burned alive. Yet the head of the NFBI, Greg Sanders, says, ‘At this time we have no evidence relating the victims to one another besides cause of death. Some of these victims appear to have been killed only minutes apart, which to me rules out a serial killer.’”
Left alone, Cas and Dean stare at each other, awkward. Dean fiddles with the whiteboard in his lap, and Cas watches his fingers play with marker scum left behind at the edges. With Leahy gone, Cas sees Dean’s boldness fall away, folded and tucked away in some corner, the uncertainty and apprehension brought back out for display. Cas doesn’t know whether he’s grateful Dean isn’t hiding his fear from him or disappointed Dean’s brashness is a mask and not a sign of genuine comfort.
“No, not of them.” Cas cuts his eyes at Dean, holding his gaze with an uncomfortable intensity. “I’m afraid of a lot of things. It doesn’t make any difference in front of a classroom what those things are, they see the fear and assume they can take advantage.”
Cas’s hand pauses. “Why?” He’s surprised by the vehemence in Cas’s voice. “Why should you have to go through more trauma at that man’s hands?”
“I’m not,” Dean says. “I mean, I’m sorry I hurt her, but I’m glad she’s happy. I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole with Lisa anyway. I wouldn’t have been a good husband.” He shoots Cas a devilish grin. “And if I’d run away with her, I never would’ve met you.”
Cas looks to Anna for help, but she’s caught up in her own world. He rubs his hands over his face, exasperated. “Well, you’re going to get your wish, Claire, because I have a mission for you both.”
It’s long and it’s lonely, and it somehow feels even worse this time around. When he drove out to California all he could think about was how much he needed to see Jess’s grave, to talk to her about this. He plotted what he would say, like she was actually going to hear. Then, once he got there and purged his grief over Dean, over his entire, broken life, he'd left, feeling empty and guilty. Jess didn’t need to hear any of that. He’d brought enough pain into her life without it spilling over into her death.
“Obviously we need to ask him for a DNA sample to compare to the ones his parents have submitted,” Leahy says, “but Deanna Campbell admitted to it in her letter. Reidy still has it, but I’ve asked him for a copy to give Dean. He’s going to be contacting the PI the parents hired, and we should hear from him by tomorrow at the latest. I’ve got to talk to Dean before then.”
“How are we supposed to do that?” someone else cries, and the crowd dissolves into at least twenty different conversations at once. Sam tries to sign out the ensuing argument to Eileen, but Dean’s not paying attention to them. He looks for James.
Silence falls. Cas wishes he were a different man, that he’d met Dean in a different way. He remembers wishing the same back in Corfu when it came to Dean Winchester. He’d finally looked at Dean not as a rival but as a friend and wondered,
Face twisted with disgust, Dean says, “Because he wanted to hide that he’s been in it, too. Haven’t you?”
Cas knows people are sometimes murdered in parks. It’s not as frequent as suicides, but it happens — lovers’ quarrels turn deadly, deranged individuals stalk campers through the woods, disgruntled business partners dump bodies. He thinks of his own experience, a mere two weeks ago.
Guilt churns in Cas’s stomach as he drives across town, following the winding road at the foot of the mountain until it splits off from the highway, turning into a one-lane dirt road that hugs the base. He should just ask Dean why he knows this part of the mountain so well, what it means to him. He shouldn’t be sneaking around behind his friend’s back. Yet Cas knows how reticent Dean is to offer up any information about himself — after they revealed the secrets of their broken families, the only conversations Dean has indulged in revolved around pop culture. Doing some digging on his own may be the only way to find out who Dean truly is.
She shakes her head. Ann Marie stops walking to the car and looks back at them, but Cas waves her on.
He doesn’t quite lose it. He definitely cries. There’s no point in trying to hide it, not with the growing wet spot staining Cas’s grey t-shirt. But Dean doesn’t sob or collapse. He just lets himself be held, lets himself think about how different this feels from Gwen’s or Ma’s hugs, lets himself imagine he can hug Cas anytime, that when he lets go it won’t be the end of this closeness.
“He wanted to save the girl, and he tried to keep me safe,” Dean says quietly, laying down his hand of cards on the ugly bed cover. “He’s a good guy.”
“This is not gonna help with the last part, but I’ve found some stuff I think might be related to our mystery light.”
Dean goes to work with Cas every day, and he fixes little things around the office — the loose hinge on the door to the storage closet, the corner of the ceiling tile in the back office where it always leaks, the jammed drawer in Cas’s desk. Cas keeps insisting he doesn’t need to work to earn his stay, telling Dean he should be relaxing while he recovers, and Dean just rolls his eyes. Dean’s right, though. Bobby does like him, and the old man seems to like him more and more with each completed project.
“I was angry,” Cas says, and he looks at his burger, not at Dean. “Because I want to explain myself to you, and you won’t let me. But I realized you owe me nothing, and I have nothing for you but poor excuses. So. Here I am, trying to earn my way back into your good graces.”
“You passed out,” Cas says, wiping at something under Dean’s nose. His hand comes back dripping with blood, and Dean has regained enough awareness to be embarrassed by that.
“Good.” Dean kisses him, and it’s too much. It’s not enough. Then he slaps Cas’s ass. “Now fuck me.”
Dean spent the day at Cas’s, ignoring Sam’s worried calls (“Dean, I heard about the homeless guy who shot himself in front of you and Jody. Jess heard he’s stabilizing... Dean, you guys helped save him, you don’t... Please talk to me.”) and watching mindless daytime television. Cas Novak, the man who’d never seen
Dean pulls his hand back. He remembers that searching gaze well. She would look at him like that sometimes in the year he lived with them, when he was at his lowest points and could barely speak or when he was faking being okay so poorly the cracks were starting to show. She looked at him like she was trying to see under his skin, see how he worked. That’s how Lisa is looking at him now.
It hits Dean that Cas has probably wanted to stay with him for almost as long as they’ve known each other. He just didn’t know Dean wanted the same thing.
“I feel them.” Dean placed a hand absently over his chest, still not looking at Sam. “I need to get them back.”
Eventually the man brings the truck to a stop, and Dean looks out the window to see a little white house, lopsided and faded with age. The man stops the car. “No more crying,” he orders in a stern voice that Dean hates more than Daddy’s. His eyes are hard as they rove over Dean’s face. “You need to act like a big boy when you meet your mama.”
! I’d love the chance to bathe in your blood again! I dream of ripping you apart limb from limb, my favorite pet! Then I put you back in the Pool, and we start all over again!”
“Yeah.” Cas swallows around the sudden lump in his throat. “He does, doesn’t he?” He turns toward the kitchen, where Dean’s leaning against the counter and talking to his brothers. He looks happy, too — face bright and open, laughing. Cas loves him so much it hurts.
They both drink, Dean’s confession still hanging over them, unanswered. It’s a weighted silence, heavy in the air around them. Dean leaves it to Cas to speak first, watching as his friend considers his words.
Later, when they’re packing their bags, retrieved from the Impala after their unintentionally public escapade, Dean pulls something out of his jacket pocket.
“He’s alive,” Victor repeats, and someone in the Winchester house sounds like they’ve collapsed into a chair. “He’s in West Virginia; he’s okay.” Victor smiles at him. Dean’s breathing quickens. “We’ve already matched the DNA. He’s a healthy, handsome young man. I’ll be happy to arrange a flight out first thing tomorrow so you can meet.”
It doesn’t seem possible, after all Dean’s done to Cas, dragging him down to the mud and the muck of humanity, pretty much talking him out of his home, out of Heaven. And yet Cas just said it.
Cas worries about Dean as they all take their seats around the crowded little table, Dean sitting wedged between Cas and Jody. He told Cas he managed to talk to Pam Barnes a little in their therapy sessions, and he knows she gave him some suggestions for how to work around the ever-present lump in his throat, but he still has his notepad in front of him turned to a clean page. The way Reidy is staring at him is probably not conducive to a comfortable
Immediately the crowd begins to murmur in collective disbelief. Angels just aren’t seen around anymore — anywhere. There’s a known portal to Heaven somewhere in Utah, but even there none of the creatures have been spotted in months.
They leave the room, so focused on problem-solving they forget he’s still there, trapped in a bed, tears leaking out of the corners of his eyes.
By the time they’ve finished with the rough patch and placed a tarp over the wounded area, Cas’s stomach is growling fiercely. They climb down from the roof and head to the kitchen, Sam still yapping, and Cas sets about making sandwiches. He glances over at the dining room table — he hasn’t quite managed to get the dark spot out of the stain at the head of the table, even after scrubbing all the blood off — but Sam takes a seat at the opposite end.
“Nah.” Dean seems to have regained some of his lost dignity and veered back into cocky territory. It’s a defense mechanism, Cas realizes. “Only the really hot ones.”
He also scares himself because sometimes he thinks he prefers it, staying in this void where he can’t quite grasp what he’s trying to think of, where he doesn’t have to worry about Sam or his loneliness or the fact that he’s getting a little too old to keep saving the world. He shouldn’t want to disappear into himself. Surely that’s not a healthy mindset to have.
Dean looks at Novak — James — now back to brushing his teeth, pointedly staring at the mirror directly in front of him. Dean cautiously sets the toothpaste down on James’ sink.
“We need to find them,” he says. “If they left to confront Seth or some other stupid, macho shit like that then they have no idea what they’re dealing with.”
Halo around to drive us back out.” She holds her arms out wide. “We’ve come to take our rightful place at the top of the food chain, and to remind Hellfire — and
He reaches the bedroom door and pushes it all the way open, expecting to find Dean sitting in the chair next to Cas’s bed, helping him change his bandages. But the chair is empty and so is the bed. The table of medical supplies looks like it’s been swept clean, and the little pile of Andrew’s old clothes that Eileen set aside for Cas to wear is gone.
Maybe he could say all that to Sam. But he can’t just tell Sam that seeing her also reminded him that Dean loved Lisa and he loved Ben, that Dean might have even grown to be truly happy with the Braedens eventually, and that reminder makes Cas’s heart ache and his blood boil with jealousy. Which he knows is both irrational and selfish, but he feels it nonetheless.
“I’ve noticed similar things.” Cas thinks of the first time he formally met Dean, how trapped he looked.
“So do you,” Cas says mildly, but he does reach into the donut box, and Dean doesn’t need to look to see he’s pulled out a glazed. Cas is predictable when it comes to taste in food.
“I have a mommy,” Dean whimpers, and the man grabs his arm and pulls him out of the car. Dean is limp in his hold, too tired to fight anymore. It’s done him no good anyway. The man is too big, too strong. Dean is too small. He’s not big, not like Mommy said he would be, not tough like Daddy is. He’s just scared.
Cas escapes the office at 5:12, and he’s home in ten minutes. He drops his keys twice in his struggle to unlock the front door, hands clammy with sweat and mind certain Dean will be gone.
Cas has felt truly, righteously furious a few times in his life — when he watched gunfire rip through cities, not discriminating between civilian and militia; when his brother, who he’d admired and adored, told him, “You’re not one of us,” because Cas dared to defy him. This, though — this is a rage like he’s never known, deeper and wilder because it’s not for people he will never meet or even for himself. He is enraged on Dean’s behalf, because he loves Dean, and someone who should have loved Dean hung him from a tree to die a terrible, violent death.
In the morning there’s another round, this time with no clothes and no open door. Cas enjoys it even more than he enjoyed the night before, but he’s not surprised at that. Everything with Dean just gets better as they go.
It’s thin, like a strand of glowing thread dropped into the nothingness surrounding him. He’s never seen anything like it before.
“I’m leaving,” Jack announces to the room at large as Cas walks over to Dean and pours him more wine. “You can go back to— whatever, now.”
look, and Cas insists, “No, no, listen. I used to work at park with a massive lake, and I was out doing boat patrol one afternoon when, for about ten to fifteen seconds, my boat got hit with these white, fleshy chunks falling from the sky.”
“Nice view,” he says. From Galaxy’s rooftop you can see straight down Purgatory Main and into the square with all of the downtown skyscrapers, piercing the night sky with their lights. “I gotta admit, I didn’t expect you to be a dive bar type of guy.”
This time Cas does look at Dean, but Dean stares straight ahead at the wall, tense in every line of his body.
“We should all go inside,” Bobby says from behind them, and Dean’s glad for the distraction. He looks at Cas, cheeks red from the cold, and feels instantly warmed and comforted by his slight smile. “I made our medic buy some cocoa this morning, and Dean’s the only one who knows how to get the coffee pot to boil…”
“Yeah dude, that’s why we’re here.” They drive in silence for a few moments, before Dean, without his brain fully giving his mouth permission, says “Hey, by the way, how are you doing with the whole, uh, seeing Lisa thing?”
He told Jack to watch over them, to wake Sam up if he appeared too distressed. He didn’t ask Jack to wake him. So Cas closes his eyes and lets the current carry him away from his friend, deciding that to fight it might be worse. Is this what Dean felt, the last time Michael took control? Underwater, struggling, unable to stop the fear of drowning even when he knew it wasn’t real? Cas doesn’t need to breathe. He reminds himself of this as the endless tide rushes on, sweeping him deeper into Dean’s mind, holding him under for far longer than any human would be capable of surviving.
Cas pulls back, kisses Dean’s lips. Slow, lingering. “I don’t know. Do you want to ‘hook up’ right now?”
Cas takes a step forward, ready to get between Dean and his father, but Chuck holds up a wrinkled hand.
“A Rottweiler,” Dean declares. “Something big and intimidating looking, but it’s actually a giant softie.”
“Maybe,” Dean concedes, “or maybe not. But I am a journalist, and I have to bring the shit I dig up to the public. That’s my responsibility.”
“I can take you,” Lucifer says, and he twists his hand up. Simultaneously, the grace surges up toward him, surrounding the burning head of his vessel, and Sam, Cas, and Eileen fall back on the ground, screaming in pain. “Say
“Well, how about this,” a familiar voice croons. “The greatest hunters in the world, finally here to pay me a visit!”
The hike here isn’t steep, and most of it is accessible via four-wheeler, but help is likely twenty minutes away at the earliest. Cas has taken care of the immediate issue, and there’s not much else he can do for the man until the medics arrive. He has first aid training, but it’s been a while since they covered suicides, and the common assumption is that all the ranger will be able to do is cut the body down and wait for law enforcement to arrive.
Cas leans forward in his seat, eyes on the light as it nears them. The hum grows louder. “Cas! Fucking —”
“You can’t let them take you,” Dean whispers, and Cas scoots closer to him. He kisses Dean’s eyelids, his cheek, his forehead.
A couple of campers straggle in at 4:52, wanting to fill out a permit for one of the sites at the bottom of the mountain. On a normal day, Cas would take time to explain the camping rules and regulations, maybe even walk them out to the site and give them a map with trails fitting their skill level highlighted. Today he stares them down as they giggle and chat instead of focusing on the form, barely suppressing a groan when one asks, “Are there, like, any rules about bonfires?”
“Don’t,” Dean repeats. ”You’re the best mom.” And he means it. She does what she can. It’s not her fault Pa is what he is, that she’s just as trapped as everyone else in this goddamn compound. “You don’t need to do anything.”
Dean takes a pull of his beer and thinks that he can just picture them doing this all of the time, the four of them, and it doesn’t make him antsy the way it would have a few years ago. Doesn’t make him want to take Sam and run, doesn’t make him crave the empty road in front of him with just his brother beside him, the two of them against the world. They’ve found a new family, him and Sam, first in Cas and now in Eileen, and Dean thinks he could get used to this. He could get used to watching his brother and Cas have pointless, all-in-good-fun arguments, could get used to Eileen’s laughter as he butchers another sign, could get used to crowded motel rooms and this feeling of contentment.
“So they already hated us for shit they made up in their own damn heads,” Ann Marie continues. “And then Sam says very loudly, like the lovely asshole he is, ‘We probably should teach them about contraception, ‘cause abstinence didn’t work for Mary.’ And that’s how we all got kicked out of the PTO at Diana’s first Catholic school." She pauses to take a gulp of wine. "They kicked a
He jerks back to attention and has to slightly correct the car to get them back on their side of the road.
Dean licks his lips, thoughtful, and Cas watches him with hungry eyes. “A real date, huh? You gonna show up at my studio apartment in your Ferrari?”
“I’ll put it on speaker, okay? If you change your mind and want to chime in, feel free. I know they’d love to hear your voice, Dean.” Henriksen glances over at Cas, who’s given up on moving the eggs around the pan and is blatantly eavesdropping. “Uh, Mr. Novak, this is kind of a private moment. Would you mind?”
He glares at Eileen, chest heaving. Cas wishes he could ease the tension, but he’s just as nervous as Dean.
Dr. Sexy (who is a bad doctor, Cas thinks) is ignoring his beeper in favor of making out (unethically) with his hot patient. Two floors down, his other patient (who is not hot but in need of actual medical assistance) is coding. Dr. Piccolo is wiping her tears away and going to save the day.
Cas follows him to the elevator and down to the discharge desk in silence. The discharge nurse takes Dean’s ID bracelet off, raising her eyebrows at the last name ‘Doe’ and lack of an insurance number, but she hands Dean his papers and his bill anyway. Cas takes it upon himself to explain the indigent situation to the nurse, whose name tag says Tessa, and she allows them to leave with only the barest information filled out on Dean’s discharge sheet: a name, Dean Smith, and a birthday, February 25, 1981. So he’s 27 — if that’s even his real birthday.
“We didn’t work. You knew, I knew. We just tried to pretend for a while. Not that I didn’t want us to work, for real. I did really care about you and Ben. But the life I lead doesn’t lend to happy endings.”
“This one might not be a villain,” she cautions as he starts to rev the engine. “If you’re both targeting Roman—”
The caller isn’t Cas, but Bobby. Dean groans, smashing his face into the pillow, then groans again because he hurt his bandaged nose.
“You thought Amara killed him,” Joshua says. “We believed the same until we saw his true form, uncontained, weak, hovering over Earth just after that last battle. He couldn’t do us any harm in that state, or so we thought. But now —”
Dean waits for Cas to look up, holding his eyes as he presses his thumb down once in the center of Cas’s palm.
he wonders. One chair is pulled out at the head of the table, crooked, and he pushes it back in. The leak from the nursery has distorted the ceiling in the living room, and the kitchen is covered in dust and dead insects. Of all the rooms in the house only the bathrooms seem to have been spared major issues, but Cas hasn’t tried to turn the water on yet so he can’t really be sure.
He parks the Impala off the road in the grass and makes his way through the trees to a small clearing where a wooden cross once stood. It’s gone now, beaten down by the elements or broken by reckless kids, but Cas remembers where it was — where Sam planted it in the fresh dirt of his brother’s grave. He walks to the center of the clearing and stands right on the spot, head up to survey the sky above him, outlined by trees.
It’s not a total lie, and she’ll forgive him after a cooling off period. They’re tied together, have been since childhood. Some strings you can’t cut, and Dean knows this all too well.
There’s someone in one of the other shower stalls, so Dean sets up camp on the opposite end, just in case the occupant is Seth. God forbid Dean have to try to make small talk with the guy.
“I don’t cook, and you know this,” Cas says, and he’s ignored as the Winchesters nod and murmur their thanks, exchanging contact info with Bobby.
Dean stands up with him. “Hang on, Cas. I have another question.” He’s still holding the tape recorder. Cas nods. “You know Dick Roman. Do you know why Hellfire attacked his shipment the other night?”
Cas strips out of his suit, leaving only his underwear on before he slips into Halo’s uniform — a tight, latex/spandex blend in luminescent white, designed to change to reflect surfaces around it for better camouflage when needed. Anna helps strap the wings on behind his back, nudging them into place. Balthazar watches with a tight frown on his face. Anna glances at him from over Cas’s shoulder and sighs.
“Oh, Turner didn’t know I was publishing it. That was all Charlie. And once something’s on the internet, you can’t take it back. Plus—” Dean raises his eyebrows pointedly, “—I know the source, and I happen to trust him with my life. Thank Anna for the info dump when you get the chance.”
As he turns to attend to his angry cat, Dean says, “It’s not your fault, man.” Cas looks back over his shoulder, and Dean shrugs. “You can’t rescue everyone.”
“What do you need healed?” Dean asks bluntly as James turns to hand him his sandwich, wrapped in a little blue napkin.
Dean barely has to get a hand on him and Cas is coming, gasping for air, eyes scrunched closed, nails digging into Dean’s back. Dean follows him after a few more thrusts, leaning his forehead against Cas’s and panting heavily as they both come down from the high.
“Not on my orders, Castiel. Heaven is still splintered into factions. And most of those factions still hate you for your loyalty to the Winchesters. Besides, we all thought you were dead after your —
Then there’s the whole matter of the asshole angel squad disowning him, which doesn’t surprise Dean all that much. They swing so far between worshiping Cas and detesting him that Dean’s shocked they haven’t all developed whiplash. This is a downswing, clearly. But to disavow Cas like that — to vote on it, to publicly declare he’s hated by all of Heaven, to torture him... That’s what kills Dean.
Cas leans back against the pillows, propped up against the headboard, running his fingers through Dean’s short hair. They sit in comfortable silence for a while before Dean says, “Hey, speaking of watching creation... You should tell me that story about the battle for Eve again.”
“Nah.” Dean watches Cas over the open bar as he rummages through his cabinets for his stupid teal blue teakettle. Cas has a Keurig, and yet he insists on making his tea the old fashioned way. “He would have snatched you up by now if he could. I think he’s drawn to that area— the highway and the woods.”
She’s sitting on his ratty apartment couch with her helmet in her hands, her short, red hair mussed and sticking up in sweaty clumps. Benny doesn’t look much better, sprawled on the floor and red-faced with indentation marks in his cheeks from where his helmet is too tight. He hates the helmet on good days, and tonight was a shit night. Plus, he got his ass easily handed to him by Cas. Dean’s sure his ego is bruised.
“And when he saw me,” Dean says, voice shaky, “he kept trying to tell me something, but he couldn’t talk.”
“No big deal,” Dean says, even though it is, to him, the Biggest Deal. “I have an old Walkman somewhere you can borrow.”
Now Dean can’t help but start to daydream the end of that particular scenario, and Cas is still right there, sitting next to him, eating sunflower seeds and talking about how tragic it is that most humans don’t know the difference between edible and inedible berries anymore. His rough, deep voice is distracting, and not in a good way, because while Cas is actually saying, “Dean, I cannot believe that you and Sam have never learned to identify moonseed,” Dean imagines him saying something more along the lines of “Dean, I cannot believe how fucking amazing this feels,” punctuated with some good, deep groans and filthy hip rolls while Dean sucks a line of hickeys down his neck.
This tune is more familiar to Cas, and soon they settle into an easy rhythm, swaying together too closely to be quite decent. Zorro doesn’t seem to mind.
Dean, not willing to explain to her that cupids are real and naked and also angels, just asks “What?”
“Sam,” Dean croaks, and Lucifer laughs with his brother’s vocal cords, making Sam’s chuckle come out distorted and harsh and completely wrong.
Jody sighs. “We picked up a man behaving erratically on Highway 9 this afternoon.” It’s not much, but it’s enough for Dean’s heart to thud in his chest, his palms sweating. “He has no identification whatsoever — no driver’s license, no credit cards. The only thing in his pocket was a 1968 dollar bill. He said his name is Martin Creaser, and he’ll only speak to Dean Winchester.”
They eat their sandwiches on the lake, lazily watching their lines bob on the water, unnoticed by the fish. When they’re done with lunch Cas reaches into the bottom of the cooler, digging out his carefully planned surprise.
Bobby hangs up, and Cas wants to vault out of his chair and across the room, take the phone from his hands and call Jody himself. “Well, what did she say?”
As if he would be anything but careful. Dean spots a package of plastic gloves sitting on the desk pulled up next to Cas’s bed, so he quickly pulls on a pair. Then, trying to remain as aloof and clinical as possible, he gently presses a finger to the skin along the stitches. It’s warm through the glove.
Claire stands on her tiptoes and pecks his cheek, and he can’t help but lean into her a little, enough so she wraps her arms tightly around him again.
He hands the phone over to Sam, who raises his eyebrows, impressed either by the discovery of the footprint or by Dean’s use of a five dollar word. Either way, Dean resents that look a little.
“You have to stop!” he shouts, and Cas pushes back against him again. The light pulses and Dean closes his eyes. “Cas! Listen to me! Don’t listen to it! Don’t do this! Cas, please!” Cas slams into him again, and Dean can feel the blood dripping down his face. “I need you!”
The rain, on the other hand, isn’t letting up. If anything, it’s falling harder now, and the roar as it pounds against the car seems to increase in time with the speed of Dean’s heart.
In the middle of the night, Dean wakes to Cas’s house phone ringing off the hook. It startles him so badly he nearly topples out of bed, just managing to catch himself on the empty nightstand on his (his? god, it’s been
Charlie covers her mouth with her hand, breathing out harshly. Then she drops her hand, looking at them.
Bobby glances over his shoulder to read Dean’s note. “Don’t get too far ahead of yourself! And pick me up some Chinese while you’re out. Least you could do after passing the buck to me on this field trip shit. Leading those kids around these trails at my age...”
“Yeah.” Dean breathes out again. Everything feels hot and tight, ready to be let loose. “It’s good.” He can feel Cas smile against his neck, and he runs a hand soothingly down his back. “It’s good.”
“Jack. My nephew. He’s my brother Luke’s son. I became his guardian three years before I became Claire’s.”
“Yes, I thought I had to be the bomb, too. But the grace I had, the grace he left behind to taunt me with — it wouldn’t have been enough.” He shrugs. “But the rest of it was. As he was taking my grace in, he was so preoccupied with you he didn’t notice me calling out to it, telling it to fight back, to… To protect you.” Cas is blushing now, like admitting that he asked his grace to protect Dean specifically is so embarrassing. “It’s been here watching over you this whole time, trying to reach out to you subconsciously, so it only makes sense it would give its all to save you from saying yes to him.”
“Of course.” Mary purses her lips, nodding to herself. “I know you’re not ready now to come home with us, but once the investigation is over—”
. But had he ever earned Dean’s trust? Cas was an asshole to him when they were children, and then he unknowingly left Dean behind. Left Dean to Alastair. His breathing quickens, and Balthazar and Anna each place a hand on his arms to stop him from shaking.
And there they are, jutting up drastically from the ground, writ large across the open sky in all their glory. He speeds through Missoula, not stopping to rest until he’s at their feet. Cas parks his truck at a pull-in next to a trail head, hiking the short distance to the edge of the foothills that cluster like ant mounds around the larger mountains’ bases. A few other hikers send him curious looks — who in their right mind would go hiking in a billowing trench coat? — but he ignores them.
“Tragic.” Cas didn’t really watch cartoons as a child. His parents were very strict when it came to television time, and when he and his siblings were allowed to watch TV, his older brothers most often picked the shows. “Will Gumby get him back?”
“Done.” Her toes dig into his clavicle as she tenses, then she’s vaulting over the fence in a graceful arc, rolling on the landing to mitigate the chances of a broken ankle.
Years later, Claire came to him as an angry, bitter child. An orphan who looked at the uncle she’d never known and said, “Why didn't your dad pick my dad, too?” She was convinced her father, the twin Cas had never met, wouldn’t have died if only Chuck Shurley chose to adopt both the boys instead of only the one with Grace. When he looked at her eyes, blue and fierce like his, some of those cracks in Cas’s heart began to heal.
It’s important to Cas to feel useful, Dean realizes. He’s afraid of being unneeded. Dean and Sam certainly didn’t help him any on that front.
”I can’t leave Sammy again.” Dean takes another step back toward his room. “Dad’ll kill me. He—” Dean abruptly stops talking, and he pulls his arms in closer to his side, as if to shelter his small body from his father’s wrath.
Cas has never in his life wanted to make this man bleed as much as he does right now. He can’t believe he never saw what his father really was after he came back from Greece. The mood swings and temper tantrums, burning down buildings and terrifying his own children before they locked him away for his safety and theirs — it wasn’t just that Chuck lost control of his Grace after he took out the Demons. No, he was corrupted through and through, and by his own hand.
Cas is off work the next day, and he spends the early morning cleaning the guest room (slash office) from top to bottom. He washes the sheets, vacuums the cat hair off the floor, and dusts his desk and blinds. He moves his laptop and his books into his own bedroom, leaving behind a few novels he hopes Dean might enjoy. Cas shoves the boxes stacked haphazardly in the closet to one corner so Dean will have room to hang up any clothes they buy him, and in the process he locates the dried bones of a mouse Gracie dragged back to the guest room and ate. He disinfects the entire room with Lysol.
Dean taps his pen against his teeth, his vision blurring as he tries to read yet another “First Encounter: FAIRIES” forum. Internet people are crazy. He’s seen a real fairy, and the guy wasn’t wearing a pink tutu or dancing around with a star-shaped wand.
“Well, I know by your standards this is an interview.” Cas fiddles with the watch on his wrist to have something to do with his hands. He’s never been much for small talk or any type of conversation, really, and he never gives interviews. He wishes he could go back to the easy banter he and Dean had the night they met, before Hellfire and the morning news. “What do you want to ask me?”
But Cas doesn’t say anything. He sits there on that ugly brown bed, chest heaving slightly like he’s about to face down a bunch of demons instead of Dean. That hurts. Dean hates that deep frown on Cas’s face, wants to walk over to him and put his thumb on the lines drawn between Cas’s brows, erase them.
“I wasn’t supposed to hang out in town, but I snuck away a few times to be with her. Met her kid and everything.” He smiles, fond and sad. “Ben. He’s a cool little guy.” The smile falls. “We’d been hooking up for a few months when she told me she got a job in Indiana. She’d accepted Ben’s dad was never coming back, and they were gonna move. She asked me to come with her, said we could get married, run away together. Make a family.”
Her smile cracks, and her lip wobbles. “Dad’s gone. Jack said Alastair killed him before starting the fire.”
This time when Dean surfaces, it’s slow. It's like coming up out of the water after nearly drowning, gasping for air, scrambling for something to hold him afloat. Michael brushes against him on his way up, slithering away deep into his mind, whispering
Seth receives three identical disbelieving stares at that. He sighs, throwing his hands up, jerking like a puppet on strings.
Dean absorbs the shock with his hands and tries to deflect it back at Cas, but he’s falling and aims wide, sending it crashing into a window. Glass shatters down around them as the chandeliers fall and the window breaks.
Billie raises her eyebrows at him, scythe in hand, cloak long and black and regal. She looks like Death. Dean can venture a guess on how she got the gig.
Sam puts on his brightest smile, the kind that convinces medical examiners to let him run around unsupervised in their labs and used to get beautiful co-eds to fall into bed with him.
They’re almost out the door when Jack trips over a box on the ground, crying out in pain. Cas turns back for him, and Jack waves him on. “I’m fine!” But it means Jack is a few steps behind them, still in the room when Hellfire’s bomb goes off.
“All by a river, Dean.” Sam moves away from the water wheel to scan over some of the old pumps and machinery attached to it. “That says water-based creature to me.”
“In the end, Daphne realized how her family pitted her against me, using her emotional turmoil to try to gain something for themselves. We reconciled, as much as two people who’ve been locked in a vicious divorce can reconcile, and I left to move back here as soon as a simple dissolution of marriage was filed. The call I received the other day was Daphne, letting me know about a snag in the paperwork — more things I needed to do concerning our house’s mortgage and the bank account before she could sign the divorce papers. So I drove back down south and wrapped everything up, but now...”
And for the first time in his life, Cas stands up to his father — by shooting a flaming blue ball of Grace directly at his head.
“Cas,” he says. “Maybe I should go to The Bend alone first — just to scope things out, find out how many people we’ll be dealing with.” Dean absently pulls at his fingers, popping his knuckles and avoiding Cas’s gaze. “This whole ‘no plan, no worries’ thing doesn’t usually work out for me, and I don’t want you getting caught in the crossfire and getting hurt.”
Dean doesn’t realize he said that last part out loud until Sam is shining his flashlight right in his face.
Cas blinks. He vaguely recalls telling Dean once that his plans were a surprise for him. He thought at the time that surely Dean would feel excited when he realized that all the dangers of the ritual had passed, when Cas stood before him human and home to stay forever. It seems he miscalculated, though he’s not sure how.
“Andrew’s clinic called today,” Sam finishes for her. “I guess he had the weekend off, but now they’re worried that he hasn’t shown up. They left a message on his phone asking for him to call in.”
“Fuck,” Cas mutters into his pillow with feeling. Dean watches his hand fumble for the phone, nearly knocking over a glass of water in the process. Cas rolls over, facing Dean, and says, “What” as he picks up.
His family stares at him and Cas swallows down his bitter disappointment and his fear and anger and says, “He was trying to draw the Demons out and he succeeded. He just didn’t get the one he wanted.”
The Grace hits him, slamming him into the wall at the far end of the hallway. It looks like Alastair sceams, blood pouring out of his nose and mouth. Cas can’t hear him over the ringing in his ears.
Now that he’s recognized it for what it is, Dean can see his love all over their history together. He sees it in a ring of fire and the sting of betrayal. He sees it in all the bottles of Jack he drank when Cas walked into a lake. He sees it in the offering of a trench coat back to a long-lost friend. He sees it in the red-hot anger he felt at that horrible reaper, in the relief when Cas chose him over an army, in the blade he shoved into a book instead of the angel’s heart. He sees it in the long hours spent alone at a table in the bunker, going through every lore book they own and trying desperately to think of a solution, praying with no response,
“Good?” Cas mouths at his neck and then his shoulder, not sucking hard enough to leave a bruise. They both hate marking each other up, leaving any black and blue spots to serve as reminders of their past, less-than-friendly encounters. It doesn’t get talked about, but it’s implicitly understood.
He’s not shirking his duties or anything, but the twins have a bad habit of wasting ammo in their rush to one-up one another, and they run out of bullets twenty minutes into what was supposed to be a hour of practice. Dean tells them to stay put while he goes back to camp for a few more boxes, rolling his eyes as Alicia jumps Max the moment he turns his back, Chrissy shouting to egg them on.
“What if they’re true,” Cas says quietly, more a statement than a question. “The myths. What if they’re true?”
It is a goddamn miracle Dean’s not having a heart attack, especially considering he’s getting up there in age and his diet consists mostly of artery-clogging diner burgers and pie.
“At least he was a chatty Cathy.” Dean stands in the middle of the room, looking up at something Cas can’t see. Maybe he’s just thinking again. “If that Perkins guy hadn’t died eight years after Lacey Parks, we might’ve been on to something there.”
So many years, so many actions and words that added up to this. Cas had no clue, either. Maybe he should have known. Maybe they both should have known. But now that he does know, he thinks one thing over and over as he looks at Dean.
Cas comes quietly, bending over to press his forehead into Dean’s chest, breath coming out in huffs Dean feels across his skin as Cas’s come hits his cock and balls.
“So you went behind my back to ask strangers at some bar about me.” It’s worse than accusation, Cas realizes. Dean is hurt. He hurt Dean.
“What if next time it sings to you instead?” Cas asks, and there’s the bitchy expression Dean used to know and love. “We should stick together.”
Dean thinks of the Impala turning itself off a few nights ago. He wrote it off as nothing, a temporary mechanical problem, but with the light and the roller and this feeling of eyes on the back of his neck he can’t shake... Dean shudders.
“Take him to the medics,” Cas tells Anna, spotting the emergency vehicles covering the far end of the lawn. The fire department has arrived, and they’re uncoiling their hoses. They won’t be fast enough to save the manor. “I’m going back in for Dean.”
They have him on speaker phone, chatting about their day. They're wrapping up a case somewhere in Kentucky, something about a ghoul. After Cas asks his question, Alicia and Max remain uncharacteristically silent for several seconds.
Justice or just revenge — does it even matter which? Cas accused Chuck of ruining their lives, but it was Alastair who truly took everything away from them both. How many sleepless nights and how many panic attacks has the mere thought of this man given him? How inadequate has he felt — as a hero, as a father, as a friend, as a
Of course, Sam can’t say that to most people. So he pretends not to hear their patronizing commiserations, and he says what he’s really thinking to those who would actually know what he’s talking about. His wife and Cas, really, are the only ones he’s still honest with. He’s trying too hard to be strong for everyone else.
“Hey Dr. Novak!” Two years removed from being Cas’s student, and Sam is still a teacher’s pet. “I wasn’t expecting to see you here.”
Cas chose to stay behind and look up lore, a decision the brothers accepted without argument. Really, though, he plans to do a bit of research and then maybe catch a quick episode of
Michael smiles. It’s nothing like Dean’s smile — too cold, too calculated. There is no love behind it, only smug superiority.
It all blends together in the end. He doesn’t remember the woman putting him in the backseat, doesn’t know if he’s really even there or if he’s alone, in the vast and empty. He feels like he’s watching his own body, and it’s pulling further and further away from him, all the taut strings that held him down breaking with a snap.
The Cas voice cuts out. Dean sighs in relief, moving his hands away from his ears. The Darkness grew bored fast this time. He sits up, listening for that phantom call, and hears nothing.
Claire and the woman are fighting with close-range blasts of Grace and Corruption behind him, and in front of him Anna and Balthazar are both challenging Hellfire. They’re outmatched. Anna does her signature spinning kick followed with a Grace blast; he simply ducks under it. Balthazar is waiting for him to spring up, hand extended palm up to chop him in the neck. Hellfire blocks the blow with an upraised arm in a move Cas has seen a hundred times because they practiced it together daily on the Shurley Manor lawn with Chuck watching from the balcony above. Every move his siblings make is telegraphed by a thousand mock fights on a thousand hot days and the muscle memory those fights left behind in the young man who used to be one of them.
“I was just asking Cas to come eat with me, maybe tell me more about the case... I mean, only what he’s allowed to tell,” Lisa says, talking mostly to Sam because she’s clearly pegged Dean as a crazy person. “I, um... I have a son out camping with friends nearby. I just want to be sure he’s safe.”
Dean ducks his head in a minuscule nod as Cas ducks out, closing the door to the break room behind him. Bobby simply raises an eyebrow at him as he hurries into the reception area, where he can already hear the excited chatter of the children perusing the little exhibits set up by the entrance — a 3-D model map of the park; a stuffed river otter that has, as far as Cas is aware of, always been called Otto; a cut-through of a tree trunk showing its age lines. They’re a small park with a small budget, so there’s not much to look at, but the class is predictably crowded around Otto. One little boy is poking at its nose.
“Keep going,” Steve says to Dean, voice low. He has Gabriel’s head cradled against his shoulder, and he slams his fist against the backseat. “You shut up!”
While he stares at the rain-damaged ceiling, he strains and strains with his grace, what little is left of it, searching for a sign of his son.
He’s alone in bed, but the sheets next to him are depressed in the vague shape of a body and the balcony door is cracked. The curtains are pushed back by the open door, allowing the too-bright sliver of morning light in. Cas tries to call for Dean, but his throat is parched. He swallows and his saliva tastes of alcohol. Cas grimaces. He badly needs to brush his teeth.
“I don’t know what there is to talk about.” Once again, his voice betrays him. He meant to sound hard and cold, like Clark Gable telling Vivien Leigh frankly he doesn’t give a damn, but it comes out anguished — like he’s the Scarlet O’Hara in this version, which sucks because he hates her. He hates the whole friggin’ movie, actually, but at least the “don’t give a damn” line is cool.
Instead Dean says, “Cas, I mean, yeah I would be worried about Sam, but I always worry about Sam.” Here Dean takes a chance and glances at his brother, but Sam holds his arms tightly across his chest, eyebrows still raised and clearly unwilling to help Dean dig himself out of this hole. “I just... you’ve been through a lot here recently, and I think you should, uh, take it easy. Not go straight into being somebody’s only backup. Besides, you were really tangled up in this Lisa mess, too, and it didn’t end so well for you last time, you know?”
“Don’t,” Anna warns Balthazar, seeing Cas’s face, but Balthazar says, “Did we confirm you and Chuck killed them all?”
Most adult versions of the holiday he spent with Dean, drinking spiked eggnog and not mentioning that that particular tradition started the Christmas right before Dean died and went to hell.
The good news, if it could be called that, is that while Dean’s energy was devoted to worrying about Cas, he could mostly keep from thinking,
“You did,” Seth says, voice low, calm like the sea in the eye of a hurricane. “In Hell. Don’t think I don’t know, Dean. It’s my business to know these things. And I know that right now, angel or not, you probably want to jump in that ridiculous car of yours and come rescue this ‘victim.’” He spits out the last word. “But he’s not even a person, Dean. He’s one of
Immediately Dean regrets saying anything. Every move he makes in this house, in this camp, is calculated to protect her above all else. Everything he does for Pa he’s really doing for Mama, because he’s seen what Pa’s temper can do. He never wants her to see it. Doesn’t even want her to know about it, and he’s just come so close to revealing the truth.
Sam huffs a sigh that moves his whole giant chest. “Well, you were so upset when you saw her that you threw up. That was kind of a big tip-off that obviously there are unresolved issues there. Then you freaked out on Cas, which you haven’t done in a while. Then all day today any time we were in town you were looking over your shoulder constantly...”
Claire bursts through the thick haze and for a moment, Cas is certain he’s died, too. It would be a relief at this point, he thinks, mind as hazy as the smoke. Then her hand latches around his arm, firm and insistent, and he wakes from his nightmare, jolted back to reality. He’s collapsed to the floor in the middle of a gunfight, and Claire is alive.
He thinks of her in a dimly lit bar, laughing and shoving playfully at his shoulder. Of her dancing around her old apartment barefoot that first weekend they spent together, holding a bottle of wine like a microphone and singing Britney Spears songs. He thinks of her holding Ben close to her heart, rubbing his head and promising everything would be all right. Of her holding Dean late at night in bed when he felt like his grief was crushing him and he couldn’t breath, couldn’t speak, whispering that she would be ready to listen when he was ready to talk.
Dean’s lips part and he looks at Jody, both of them watching him. He knows the answer to Creaser’s unspoken question. It’s a small town, and he remembers seeing the obituary in the local newspaper as a kid. Some of Carla Creaser’s grandkids went to school with him; they left class early one day for the funeral. Dean’s homeroom signed cards for them to read when they got back.
The other angel doesn’t move, watching James back away with a smirk on his face. Dean wonders if they even remember him, that guy they chunked into a tree thirty seconds ago.
“If you had listened to her, you would know the whole story, Dean. But you don’t listen! You never gave her a chance. From the second she decided to leave the bunker you thought the worst of her. You chose to believe that she didn’t care about us. You chose to believe she hurt Cas on purpose.”
“Like he wants to take your friend.” Creaser stares at Dean, an unerring sharpness in his gaze. Dean leans back in his chair to put some distance between them. “Castiel Novak. Like he took the girl. Sometimes he wants blood. Sometimes, when he's real angry, he wants the live ones. He sent me to tell you he gets what he wants.”
He doesn’t ask why Cas left as they climb into the car. He doesn’t ask why Cas freaked out at the gala as he turns the Impala on. He doesn’t ask why Cas came back as the soft sounds of the radio fill the car. And when Cas looks at him searchingly, Dean keeps his eyes on the road. He doesn’t ask Cas if he ever loved Dean the way Dean loves him. He’s pretty sure the answer is no.
idea — when they were still relatively safe at Andrew’s house. “So Cas, I gotta ask — how can we get it to come to you? And how far away can we be for this work?”
Dean leans back against the couch, and Cas tries not to be offended he’s choosing a nap over watching him work. He’s giving a lecture on forest preservation to a bunch of third graders; it’s not exactly everyone’s scene, and Dean is still worn out from his hospital stay.
“Something you need to know about Daphne is she’s incredibly kind and selfless, but her family is... not. They’re traditionalists, fundamentalists, and they were angry at us for separating. Daphne told one of her sisters the rumor, and it spread amongst the rest of them. They’d worked her into a frenzy, telling her I was an abomination, a gay man using her as a beard; telling her I cheated on her — although we were separated and I hadn’t pursued you at all yet. She talked about filing a lawsuit, taking everything from our joint funds for her ‘emotional trauma.’ She didn’t sound like herself.”
“When I asked Castiel to come to the headquarters, it was only supposed to be me who interrogated him. They wanted me to ask him questions about how his grace works and what his angel blade is made of, but I just wanted to talk to him about his relationship with you two in an environment I could control.”
The worst thing about this destructive little fantasy is that Cas thinks Dean actually might let him go.
Dean smiles again, glad no one is here to see him blushing at his texts like a middle school girl. He can’t deny how relieved he felt when he woke at 6 for his next night shift and saw Cas had called him, apologizing for Gabe and for leaving Dean hanging. He did have a stomach bug, but he offered to come out to Highway 9 regardless.
It’s not the best for dancing, but Cas tries to lead them in time with the bass beats from the cello as the violins swell to mark the chorus. Despite claiming he can’t do more than turn in circles, Zorro gamely keeps up. He’s quick on his feet, matching Cas step for step, cheeks heating with embarrassment and laughter whenever he steps on Cas’s toes. Cas could skip out on this party altogether, just to watch this man laugh.
“And you’ll swear on the record you enjoyed this?” Cas asks, hacking his spaghetti into tiny pieces with his fork.
“You haven’t been his professor in two years.” Dean looks between the two of them. Sam looks at the ground.
“Come on, Cas,” Jody says, pushing him out the door as he contemplates a day of walking trails in sockless feet. Imagining the odor alone makes him shudder. “We need to take a closer look at our crime scene.”
“No,” Cas admits, “but he didn’t need to. They’re not his true targets. He’s after bigger fish.” He thinks of the message the masked man played for the crowd tonight. It was not a crowd of low-level thugs or even middling enforcers. He meant for his message to be seen by the wealthiest of the wealthy — the people in charge.
“Okay, so then why are you here? Why do you need hunters’ help? And I mean, no offense, but why Seth? Guy’s a bag of dicks.”
He drops the radio before he gets a response, digging for the pocketknife he always carries. Cas pulls it out, pausing in front of the man, and as he looks up to judge where best to cut the rope, he catches a glimpse of the man’s face. It’s purplish and mottled, veins protruding along his neck and forehead. His mouth hangs partially open, swollen tongue poking out. His eyes are bloodshot, but clearly green. Cas’s hand shakes as reaches up for the rope.
“Hey, sorry. I was taking a phone order.” Cas is startled by the voice coming from behind his shoulder, jumping before he turns to face the man. “Oh, sorry again!”
“Feelings were blurred for me, though,” he says. “I had a hard time deciphering them because I couldn’t recall what emotion fit what action. She cared for me and I cared for her, and intellectually that told me we were in love with one another. But as more of my memories came back, I realized I’d never been in love with anyone. Including Daphne. What I felt for her was admiration and loyalty and affection without passion or longing. I’d put her in an untenable position, and that had never been my intention. I truly didn’t know what I was doing when I asked her to marry me, but it didn’t change how guilty I felt when I realized the love I had for her was nothing like what my other married friends felt for their spouses.”
Dean watches Steve’s eyes, wild and unfocused from the adrenaline of barging in on a fight, narrow with understanding. He knows my name, Dean thinks, absurdly.
Cas begins to think that perhaps Dean didn’t want Cas to confess his love while dying, to add another weight to Dean’s chest.
He just manages to catch her as they reach the bottom of the slope, and they both have to drag their feet to stop before they run into Olivia Lowry as she’s bringing out the wet laundry to dry. “Watch it!” she calls, but they ignore her as they stumble further into camp.
“I’m a divorced man, Dean.” Cas smiles, worn and faint. “Daphne signed the papers two days ago. She was very kind in the end. She apologized for her anger, which I told her was not entirely unwarranted. And we parted amicably.”
“It’s Thanksgiving.” Her voice is clearer now, but Dean hears a slight shake to it. “Is— Did you find something?”
“What?” Jason drops his spoon into his bowl with a splash. “Mom, I’m not even dressed! And I was supposed to meet the guys before class, we just got in the parts for that Cobra in auto tech —”
As if he could relax. He’s just learned he was kidnapped by his own grandparents as a child and now he’s in love with the man who is arguably his best, and currently his only, friend. He would sign to her that his life is a nightmare but he doesn’t know the sign for nightmare. Eileen’s refrained from teaching him the bleak stuff. He glares at her like she’s done it on purpose and she gives him a cringey sort of smile, misunderstanding.
Cas is uneasy as he makes his way up the trail, eyes and ears on high alert. He’s carrying the rifle again, but it’s not for a cougar or a bear. Cas hates killing on principal, but he’s shot someone who was trying to kill him before. He could do it again if he had to. He hopes it doesn’t come to that.
Eileen signs something, but her hands are too fast for him to catch. Henriksen’s smile is looking a little forced but he says, “I understand it’s a lot to take in. Now, I’ve been working on your case for about six years. I’d love to be the one to give John and Mary a call and let them know their son is alive. I’d love for you to be able to talk to them, too. But if you’re not ready yet, I get it. So, Dean — do you want to talk to them, or do you want me to handle it?”
“Some of it came back to me,” he says, “and it protected us all. When I woke up, I had enough strength to heal most of your injuries and to bring you all back here.”
Dean shifts on the bed. “I’m not gonna write about this, Cas. I don’t want you to worry about that.”
“They accepted you once before. And now you have not only a glowing recommendation letter, but also some of that ineffable life experience they’re always going on about.”
“I remembered waking up the next day. Next to you,” he says, not looking at Cas, his voice still a little hoarse. “And I was so fucking happy you were there.” He feels Cas shift on the bed next to him. “That’s all I got. A second of happiness, and now… Now we’re here.”
“No, we didn’t really do much talking.” She crosses her arms over her chest, almost protectively. “Look, about all I know is he kept strange company and he was good in bed. He told me he did odd jobs around town, but I’ve never seen him anywhere other than here. He was more interested in getting me to talk about myself, and when we —
“I tried,” she says, and he takes a step back, still holding on to her arms. Her hand comes away from her side, and it’s soaked with blood. “I promise I tried.” Claire starts sobbing, and Cas pulls her behind him, moving back toward the grand staircase. She follows right on his heels, her face pressed into his back.
He doesn’t have to look far. Cas is shoved at him almost instantly, falling over on top of Dean, who barely manages to catch him before his head hits the ground. Dean reaches for his face as soon as he manages to get them both steady, cupping Cas’s jaw in his hands. Cas is bloodied and bruised again, and he shakes his head and whispers, “I tried to hold him off; I’m so sorry.”
Cas just lolls his head back to the center of the pillow and closes his eyes. Dean bites his tongue to stop from saying anything else. Cas clearly isn’t up for a chat right now, and why would he be? He’s been tortured for a week straight, just woke up in a strange place delirious and raving, convinced that Seth sent Dean to hurt him.
Cas is lying in bed staring blankly at the ceiling again when Dean walks in. His hands are shaking, so Dean shoves them in his jacket pocket. Everything in him says
“She said when she was a kid, there was a circle in the woods. These woods.” Josephine waves a hand to encompass the trees surrounding the highway. “It was made of dead grass, and it was perfectly round. Everyone knew not to go in it.”
It hurts to admit, but it’s time to come clean. He’s been pushing the kid away and then pulling him back close since he was born, wavering between hating Jack and needing to protect him ‘cause that’s what Cas wanted, and Dean can do anything for Cas. Even befriend the devil’s son. But the truth of the matter is Dean’s projected a lot of his own grief and anger and inadequacy onto the kid, blaming a literal child for his own inability to save Cas. For his inability to tell Cas he loved him before they ran out of time.
He hadn’t realized his hands were still shaking until she grabs one and holds it. “Okay… Okay. Thanks.”
, together, he’s ostracizing his kids, and he couldn’t save the man in front of them. All his failures under one roof. Cas looks at Dean and Dean stares back, and he can’t move.
He looks up to see Cas’s eyes are fully open now, and for once he’s not looking at Dean warily, but almost... fondly? Dean feels a blush start to creep across his cheekbones, unbidden.
