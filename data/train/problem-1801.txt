“Let’s go,” Lestrade said, clapping Sherlock out of the back to steer him out of the room. When they’d got out of earshot he said, “We’re off to the pub. Quiet dinner my arse, I’ve got five quid off your brother and I’m buying the first round.”
overwhelmed him. He saw Lestrade over John’s shoulder muttering something that looked like “face of God”, but that didn’t make sense. Clearly he needed to work on his lipreading skills.
John went back downstairs. The taps were off, so he peered around the door. Sherlock was in the bath with the curtain pulled. “Sherlock? All right?”
I’m nearly finished!” He had only a handful of pages to go—why couldn’t the rest of the world just shut up?
“Ah, that’s good news, that is. You can teach me and John next summer, and we can impress the lassies. We’ll be the envy of all the others.”
Sherlock refused the pain pills next morning; they gave him horrible nightmares. The pain was lessening anyway. He even managed some tea and toast. By the time Mycroft turned up he was beginning to feel a little better about the whole thing, wondering if John would still be willing to chase around after the underground network like the old days.
A slow blush spread over Laura Benning’s face. She blinked rapidly several times. “How…” It came out high and breathy and she cleared her throat. “How did you know?”
The week before Christmas a great box came addressed in Sherlock’s distinctively elegant slash of a hand, and they all gathered around it in the kitchen to conjecture.
Once Lestrade finally sent the bank records, it took Sherlock less than an hour to identify the nightclub where he believed Daniel Pearson met his supplier. Now he and John had only to return there tonight and identify the dealer.
“No, likely not.” Lestrade looked unhappy. “A contract killer…didn’t they all work for Moriarty, back in the day? Thought you put them out of business.”
“Yeah.” Lestrade scratched his ear. “So he said okay, as long as your guard captain comes along and we keep it quiet.”
Sherlock chewed his lip a minute, thinking about his answer. “I think I can get him to talk,” he said finally. “But I’m going to need to do some research. Is there somewhere we can stop to get a laptop? Nothing fancy, a Chromebook will do.”
Sherlock did it again, and then again and again, varying the speed and pressure until John was squirming around and begging, “Okay stop, stop, it’s too much, back off. God, that’s—wow. You can put another finger in now.”
Tyler Austin didn’t die of Brugada syndrome, Sherlock thought with smug satisfaction. He rubbed a finger over his lips, considering his options. He’d never been given a way to contact DI MacDougall directly, which was probably a deliberate precaution on her part, but worked to his advantage here. He needed to stay a few steps ahead. In the end he sent an email to Sergeant Donovan, saying rather cryptically that the forensics didn’t add up and asking her to pass on his advice to have the pathologist do a date rape panel. If MacDougall was as good as Donovan seemed to think, she’d do it from a sense of thoroughness if nothing else. Of course, Donovan wouldn’t even get the email until she got out of court, so that left him a comfortable head start. Back to the lab report.
Sherlock was not meant to present Mrs. Hudson, of course—she was a beta and a servant—but Molly had never cared about that sort of thing. “You must be Mrs. Hudson,” she said, lifting her head to smile at Mrs. Hudson from under her headdress. “Sh—Brother Bathsheba’s told me so much about you, he’s quite happy you’ve come.”
Sherlock took a sip of coffee and immediately a waitress swooped in and poured more from a plastic carafe. “I want to look at the crime scenes. Well, as close as I can get, anyway. Are Dallas and Keithville too far?” Now his coffee was no longer sweet enough. He set it down to add more sugar, and someone refilled it again.
Cowardly grumbled something inaudible but Sherlock heard the ring of footsteps on the iron staircase; a few inches from his eyes he saw the ladder quiver with the vibration. They were climbing up. Soundlessly he rolled to his knees and edged around the opening in the floor, opposite the ladder, so that anyone climbing up would have their back to him.
Now that he was stronger, Sherlock was beginning to enjoy the experience of living in his body. He was sleeping better than he had in years, and the kayaking was turning out to be quite fun. A hot shower, a soft bed: these things were blissful in a way he had never been able to really appreciate before. And food! Food was
John climbed into the Range Rover and Collins threw it in gear immediately, swinging it around in a wide arc to skirt the edge of the field back around to the village. John wondered why he didn’t just drive over the poppies—they were about to burn them all up anyway—but part of him approved of the kid’s instinctive respect.
John pointed at him. “You go to Planet Baby. Ask for his records and then take Ellis off into a conference room or something. Say there’s a possible data breach, say you’re worried about their online security for personal information, say Homeland Security thinks a terrorist has signed up on the baby registry—anything you like. Keep him tied up. You could even pull in some other people from his department if you want a bigger smokescreen. Then as soon as you get the records—“
Arslan guffawed. “God, no, the police work for us. But this shit is valuable enough that there are plenty of people who’d love to get their hands on it. Abdulleyev is our biggest problem. That’s why we’ve got the firepower.”
They came to the third storey corridor and John stopped, still holding Sherlock’s arm. “Are you all right? Did he hurt you?”
“More police arrive, the detectives arrive, officers canvass the house and the street,” McGInty said. “To cut to the chase: the building was a four up-four down. Of the front downstairs units, one tenant was at work and the other side heard the gunshots as well as footsteps running up the staircase in the center of the building. Zoran and Marija Radojovic. They had actually called 911 a minute or so after Mr. Stegman, saying they were afraid there was a shooter in their building. The back downstairs units heard nothing. Upstairs, the front right unit—that would be Deana Clark—told the police she was watching TV and heard nothing. The left hand unit, Kelly Lewis, stated she heard gunshots, someone running up the stairs, and then a few minutes later someone running down the hallway toward the fire escape. The back units were asleep and did not hear the gunshots but one, Edith Chester, thought she heard the window being opened on the fire escape.”
“Yeah, you did.” John slid his hand over Sherlock’s chest and down to his trousers. “Now it’s my turn.”
“I’ve got to go round to the chemist and get some things for him, and then I’ve got to try to wake him up, which is going to be harder than it sounds—he was up for three days. I’ll ring you in—“ John checked his watch. “—three hours, or when I know something, whichever comes first.”
. He wondered if it had started as consensual—he had read about breathplay during his recent researches—but damage to the extent Lestrade had described could not have been accidental. No wonder he’d apparently sworn off both drugs and sex after that. John had a disquieting thought: was that was had attracted him to Moran? Was the danger, the risk, a lure that still pulled him, that finally proved too much to resist?
“But wouldn’t we be aware of it? You said the primary time stream had its own integrity. If we’ve been affected—if
Roz smiled at him without taking her eyes from the road. “Because I never trained as an investigator, but I was a good sergeant and I have a pretty good eye for when the coppers have been cutting corners. And because I’m going to write a brilliant book when you find this guy, so I want to know how you process.”
Sherlock flipped through the pages--it was a long book--and checked the inside back cover, but there was nothing else. Hmmm. He finally decided that it didn’t matter. Maybe they were all true, but if not, he could work with any of them.
Sherlock. Sherlock not in the flat where he belonged but instead apparently gone home with some unknown choirboy assassin who was not only twice John’s size but who fucking outranked him. Fuck. How had
“Hey,” John managed, opening his eyes and trying to catch his breath. “Do you want to…” He trailed off. Sherlock had pulled himself to his feet and was shucking off his own trousers with a quick grace that usually eluded him these days; he must be feeling the wine more that John had realized. John had no idea what Sherlock had in mind, but he was sure he was up for it—right until Sherlock knelt down on the floor again. Facing away. He leaned forward and pressed his elbows and forehead to the rug.
Jayla shook her head. The brightness had drained from her face now, leaving her looking worn and tired again, weighed down by a lifetime of disappointment and abandonment. “No. Just that I was scared of him.”
John saw the moment it hit him, really sank in for the first time, and he saw what it had cost Mycroft to carry that burden for so long and what it cost him now to give it up. “You’re right,” Mycroft said, eyes cast down. “Apologies.” He made to turn away.
Summer had ostensibly arrived and classes ended at the cathedral. Lady Smallwood treated her class to tea at the bakeshop, which Sherlock, prudently, skipped; he went shoe shopping with Molly instead. The weather remained bleak and dreary, which suited his mood when the tailor returned for fittings.
?” Dr. Woodcourt repeated in surprise. “Are there no other jobs that need doing at Bart’s that they must put someone with weak lungs in the laundry?”
The commandant. That was a bit higher up on the disciplinary food chain than John was expecting. And what were they going to even do to him? He was already doing hard labor at a prison camp and alphas weren’t subject to beatings. John squared his shoulders as he approached the low building and saluted to soldier on duty at the door: “Prisoner Watson to see the commandant.”
They were attracting a number of stares, ranging from the curious to the downright hostile. “Do you have any other clothing?”
Owen looked at John, who shrugged and said, “I don’t know--people just owe him favors. Ready, lads?”
John thought the likelihood of finding anyplace open where Sherlock would deign to eat was low, but he kept an optimistic eye out nonetheless, and so noticed when they turned the wrong way. “Aren’t we going back to the hotel?”
Just as he had predicted, Sherlock seemed to be back to baseline the next morning, although he was so peevish and snappish from his painkiller hangover that for once John was almost glad to escape to the bus. He worried over the situation all the way back home, and first thing Monday rang Ella for an appointment.
“No,” Sherlock said, and rang the bell. “It’s an old man living alone, though he didn’t always, but there’s no one else here now; we should be able to take care of ourselves if he’s no longer on our side.”
“Oh, that would have been simple. After he’d, er, done his duty we’d have bundled Captain Watson away and fetched Commander Pitts back, pretending of course that he’d been sent for straight away so that Pitts would think he himself was the first one on the scene.”
John blinked sluggishly. Morning light was streaming through the windows and Mike was shaking his shoulder, holding out a cup of tea.
What was he on about? Sherlock ignored him and fetched himself a cup. Trevor was reading the newspaper, so he sat down next to her.
Mycroft nodded. “I did not receive word of Sherlock’s survival for a few days, so in that time I believed myself bereft of both father and brother. My joy at the news can therefore scarcely be imagined, but it was tempered by the fact that you seemed to have vanished into thin air. I sent agents to Sherrinford at once, of course—“
“No, not the apples...everyone saw the footprints this morning, John. And that means probably everyone at the house saw them as well.”
John hesitated but Dr. Woodcourt was right, and he was very tired. “You’ll wake me if anything happens?”
--Mirzayev was running one of the biggest smuggling operations Sherlock had ever seen, moving drugs and guns through Uzbekistan with clockwork efficiency.
John filled the kettle and got down the mugs, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. He looked just the same as always. In the face of his utter self-possession, John felt a bit embarrassed over his earlier fears. “So,” he said in a would-be casual voice. “Going to see him again?”
“Sherlock.” John straightened. “I know how you feel right now. I really do. I’ve been there, remember? I swear to you, it will get better.”
anything,” Mycroft said calmly, his refusal to get ruffled only enraging Sherlock further. “We knew this was a strong possibility. Miss Agra warned us that she knew very little about Moriarty’s--“
“January 29. Give or take. And promise me you’ll beef up the CCTV coverage around their house and the surgery.”
John paused a moment to take in the unexpected pandemonium. Word was already spreading, apparently—there was a low murmur of excitement that was beginning to swell into an outright roar, and men were gathering in clusters or breaking for the stairs. John felt his face split into a huge grin. They had pulled it off!
They were quiet on the way home. John had no idea what Sherlock was thinking. When they got back to Baker Street John took Sherlock into the shower, stripping off his jeans-–he wanted to bin them, the knees were disgraceful, but the jeans were old and soft and clearly well-loved--and climbing in behind him to wash the smoke from their hair. They’d never showered together before, but Sherlock didn’t even blink as John lathered up the soap and washed him, gently urging Sherlock to put his hand on John’s shoulder and lift his feet one at a time. Then he wrapped one arm around Sherlock’s middle and got him to lean forward by stroking his back and washed between his legs, rubbing his soapy fingers up his cleft and just into his opening as Sherlock shivered, warm water running in rivulets off his hair.
“Do you ever give anything away?” John asked, quirking a smile, and Irene laughed her full-throated laugh again.
John, feeling better after his bit of a rest, toed off his own shoes and sat on the blanket to peer into the hamper. There were little insulated compartments in the corners, the first of which turned out to hold a bottle of cold rosé and the second two wine glasses. Fortunately, the other two held bottles of water. Excellent. He took out a bottle and gulped thirstily before handing it to Sherlock and pulling out the wine.
A long time ago, a lifetime it seemed now. The night Gregson had told Lestrade to go home and then proceeded to be tiresome:
The phone rang four times and Sherlock was just wondering whether or not to leave a voice mail when John picked up. “Sherlock! What’s happened, do you have news?”
John had to close his eyes against the overwhelming rush of feeling because it was really that simple, wasn’t it? Heaven was no paradise if Sherlock were not with him. Either Sherlock was right and their love was as sacred in the eyes of God as any other, or he wasn’t, but either way the only thing they could be sure of was their time on earth.
There. Cards on the table. His heart in his throat, John stood straight and waited for Sherlock’s response. For a long, agonizing moment Sherlock just stood there unmoving, his head still down.
“Not him,” Sherlock said, looking over her shoulder. “He bought me the best dinner of my life once.”
” Sherlock said with more conviction than he felt. “She’s not going to hurt me. But I’ll meet her in public if it makes you feel better.”
He dug in his own heels at the same time, praying Sherlock would do as he was told. For a minute he heard nothing but his own flying hoofbeats--thank God, Sherlock had done as he said, he had turned off, John would know otherwise, Circe was a fast horse and would be close enough to hear if she were racing him on the road. Then with a jolt of relief and terror he heard the sound of several horses closing in fast behind him. They had taken the bait, but they were going to catch him up too soon--Hermes was already tired, and the strangers’ horses were gaining faster than John had expected.
“John Watson. You are found guilty on the charge of stealing a horse from the current Earl of Sherrinford. In consideration of your tender years, the Crown is inclined to mercy in the hope that you may learn from your mistakes and live a godly life henceforth; therefore you are remanded to St. Bartholomew’s School for Wayward Boys where you shall reside until you reach the age of majority. Next case.”
“But it does,” Sherlock said. His hand was cold in John’s, but he didn’t draw it away. “You say that now, but it does. I want to be with you more than anything, but I’ll be
“Oh, I’ll make myself ill. Not seriously ill--don’t look so alarmed, I’ve done it before. Malingering is a very useful skill, you know. I’ll stop the fireplace flue and stand over it with a blanket over my head until I can’t stop coughing, then air out the room and ring asking for lemon and honey. I’ll be kept to bed for at least a few days and with any luck cough myself hoarse, so I can spend the rest of the time with a flannel round my throat pretending it hurts to talk. That way I won’t offend anyone.”
It was probably no later than three, then. There were still hours to go until dawn. They lapsed into silence again, both of them tired but too keyed up to rest, the damp air around them growing steadily cooler. Sherlock got up without a word and returned with a blanket from the saddlebags, which he wrapped around them both, and they sat with their shoulders pressed together, looking out into the dark rain.
Sherlock pulled on the jeans. He felt ridiculous, as though trying to pass as somewhat else, but when he came out to the three-way mirror a girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and Rowan said, “
John waited a full count of three hundred after the last breath before he reached for the cold wrist and felt for the pulse he knew he would not find. Then he crossed Robin’s hands gently on his chest, whispered words of heaven and peaceful rest that he desperately wished to be true, and pulled the blanket over his face.
In February Sherlock stopped taking commissions, although John didn’t know about this until the day they had been riding the train back from London and Sherlock had said abruptly, “In the spring, I think. When I finish the rest of the pieces for Brigid’s Cross.”
Sherlock fell to his knees just inside the room and vomited, supporting his weight with his good hand, and then collapsed over onto his side. He could see nothing; the room was completely dark. No windows, one flight of stairs: he was in a room in the cellar. Sherlock just lay on his side for a few minutes, his right arm lying slack over his body, hoping that the pain and nausea would eventually recede; they did, but not much.
“Your mother’s maiden name, I know.” John was light-headed with relief. “I didn’t know he’d used an alias, but it makes sense that he would.” And this at least had left John completely certain that Mycroft had nothing to do with the selection process—which was possibly part of Sherlock’s reason for doing so, now that John thought about it.
Lestrade grunted. “Think I’ve about got this now. All right, I’ve sent the email. If you can’t open it or I buggered it up some other way, text me back and I’ll have Mags do it tomorrow.”
“What?” Sherlock drew back, nose wrinkling. “I said I’d bond with you, not marry you. I’ve had enough of being given away in churches to last the rest of my life.”
“Of course--thank you,” John said, surprised. The corner where he had set up the screen for Irene had become their de facto private room, although it was rarely used. He felt a stab of anxiety that Irene had somehow been caught and returned, and he hurried to find Dr. Woodcourt.
On the next possible occasion Sherlock took the bus to a bookstore in a certain part of town—his past experience had taught him that almost everything could be found in books, but in this instance he rather doubted the library would have the relevant material, so this was the next best thing. He skulked around for a bit until he found the section he wanted and ducked down behind a shelf, settling cross legged on the floor and pulling one of the books into his lap.
“Buy some,” Sherlock said. “Obviously.” And with that he got to his feet and swept up to the bar, in full-on dark and mysterious mode, leaving John slouching down behind the table wondering why Sherlock couldn’t occasionally try for something a little less conspicuous.
Sherlock’s actual scent had been complex: poncy shaving soap and coffee and clean cotton, wool and tobacco if he had on his coat, but the smell of the shampoo alone still brought everything back to John: damp nights and danger and excitement. It also went straight to his groin. Well, that was a pleasant surprise. John honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d been genuinely turned on—not since the night Sherlock was shot, probably. It felt
“I know what it does,” Sherlock cut in. Vecuronum was a paralytic. Injecting it would leave him unable to move, fight, scream, or—most importantly—breathe, but he would be fully conscious for the long minutes it would take him to die.
Sherlock shoved the conversation immediately to his brain’s rubbish bin and returned to his laptop with alacrity. Tyler Austin had been in a relationship with a young American singer-actress but the terms of that were rather flexible, at least according to the tabloids; he had been linked with numerous other women in both London and at home. There were well-publicized accounts of quarrels about this and—ah, this was interesting: Austin had returned yesterday from a holiday trip home, going straight to the studio from the airport, and by at least one account had been unceremoniously dumped whilst in America. Sherlock doubted this had broken the young man’s heart, which seemed to be a singularly shallow organ, but supposed a limited imagination could see this as grounds for suicide.
It was like a kind of madness. But nothing like the simple madness of heat, which had been pure biological need; this was a highly specific obsession. He woke from every brief doze desperate for John, John’s touch, John’s weight pressing him down; he needed to know how he smelt and how he tasted and the converse as well, the taste of his own lips on John’s, the feel of his skin when John rubbed against him with his stubble. He needed John to take him deep and to hear the sound of his own cries in John’s ears.
Later, of course, John would wish that he had. Because the very next day was when it all began to go terribly wrong.
Sherlock was so relieved at not having to endure dinner that he found himself saying magnanimously. “Well, I owe you a favor, Detective Sergeant. I won’t forget.”
“You think I’m going to be upset,” Sherlock said dispassionately as John took the glass away. He painfully pushed himself upright. “Whatever it is you have to tell me, you don’t want to. You think I won’t like it.”
Chapter 19: From the St. Crispin’s Day speech in “Henry V” which is cited at the end of the chapter. The line “the game’s afoot” is arguably better known from Holmes shouting it to wake Watson up in ACD canon than it is from its original context, but it is frequently misinterpreted to mean a game that one plays. It actually refers to game that is hunted.
“But if the education reform Father wants had passed, and fifteen years ago, and your village had a school, and you won a spot. I know you would have done, you’re cleverer than any of the boys yesterday.”
“Listen,” Sally said. Sherlock tensed a little. “You went through some shit. Everyone knows it. Nobody…everybody’s amazed at you. You know that, right?”
John unfolded more of the tablecloth, getting his bearings and squinting at the tiny embroidered lettering. He checked his watch and considered. “I think we’re going to stop the night,” he said finally. “At the rate we’re going we’ll make the border around four in the morning and there’s sure to be checkpoints; we’ll be a sight more suspicious at that hour than we would in the day. Sholto gave me a couple of options and there’s one not far from here, near the Peaks. I don’t see the village on your map though.”
“Sherlock—“ but Sherlock was already gone, closing the door behind him as he slipped out. John sighed and picked up his own coat, and suddenly Sherlock was already back, grinning.
Sherlock laid his head against John’s leg when he had done and John stroked his hair, getting his breath back and murmuring nonsense like “Beautiful, sweetheart, you’re brilliant,” before he took Sherlock by the biceps and hauled him to his feet.  “On the bed like you were before,” he ordered, and then he replaced the blindfold, slicked his hand, and knelt behind Sherlock, tugging his back against John’s chest. It was a little awkward with Sherlock’s bound arms in the way, but John was able to reach around to take hold and stroke him, and Sherlock’s head immediately fell back against John’s shoulder and he groaned as he pushed up into John’s hand. John had slicked the fingers of his other hand too, but kept them out of the way until he could tell Sherlock was getting close, when he slid them down the cleft of Sherlock’s arse and right into his tight hole whilst he hissed into his ear, “Next time I’m going to tie you down and fuck you so hard…” The angle made it impossible to hit Sherlock’s prostate, but apparently that was unnecessary because Sherlock jerked in John’s arms and came like a freight train, spattering his own chest as he arched his back and shouted.
“No, I suppose not,” Ana said. She took a considering sip of her drink, then tipped her head back and drained the rest. She set the glass down on the table and stood. “Well. I’ll let you get on with it then. You’ll take care of this?”
“There we are,” Molly said, sounding relieved. She switched out the first tube. “Sorry about that. I know it’s a lot, I think John just…well, you know. People don’t always make the best decisions when they’re impaired.”
Hobbes finally thudded sulkily off down the stairs. As soon as she cleared the landing Sherlock picked up his phone and rang his brother.
Mike, bless him, said exactly the right thing. “We’d slow you down terribly, wouldn’t we,” he said sadly.
He soon found out. The patient who was moved into the last bit of empty space in John’s ward turned out to be very young indeed--only a few years older than John, he thought--and startlingly pretty, even with her face flushed and swollen from fever. She had an enormous mass of thick dark hair that the nurse hefted with disapproval. “We’ll want this off,” she said decisively, reaching for her scissors.
A week. He’d lost an entire week, lying in…what, a coma? A week in which John had aged ten years but which was only an empty void to Sherlock. Maybe he had suffered brain damage, because he didn’t seem to be able to absorb any of this. He sifted through the information he’d been given and finally arrived at the one thing that felt crucial to clarify now.
“Okay,” John said, after Sherlock showed no signs of moving. “You’ve practiced this before, right? Breathing strategies and that? Like before you went to the tea shop the first time.” John knew Sherlock saw his therapist every week and presumably got something out of it, although John still found it hard to imagine Sherlock doing anything there but making inappropriate deductions.
“Well, street kids aren’t really my area,” John said, “but fortunately I know a good social worker.”
“Sherlock.” John cut him off. “This isn’t only for you, all right? Just—you were there for me, when I was at my worst. Your methods were totally mental and almost got you killed, but, you know. I’ve been a shit friend to you, and I’ve been a shit dad to Rosie, and a shit husband to Mary, and from the way everyone reacted when I said I was taking leave I suspect I’ve been rather a shit doctor as well. So. You were there for me, when my life fell apart, every time, and now I’m here for you. Okay?”
His delivery was wooden and should have been annoying, but John knew Sherlock well enough to know that his regret was sincere. He felt a good deal of his anger drain away. “I appreciate that. I apologize for hurting you. We still need to talk about it.”
It took Lestrade several hours to sort the mess in Thamesmead. Counterfeiting, honestly—couldn’t Sherlock stumble into a crime in his division for once? He finally arrived at the hospital to find Sherlock looking worse than he had ever seen him, including John’s stag night and the time he’d been drugged by Irene Adler. Sherlock’s hair had dried into weird foul-smelling clumps, he was bandaged from hip to knee, and he was still shivering.
Kelly sighed, after a minute, and picked up her narrative again. “So yeah, you were right, he did think we had this bond because of that, I guess. And he did figure out I was smart. I got us out of a bad situation one time—long story, I’m not telling it now—and he realized I was good in a jam. I was already holding for him; all the girls do, that’s how most women in prison get there; but he started having me take the money too. Turned out I was good at math. And I was good at spotting why if someone was short, if they were skimming or dipping into the product or what.”
“You know that’s not what I mean. I mean,” John took a deep breath, “it used to make me furious, the way you lied to me. I was so angry for…well. For a long time. But I’ve come to realize, lately, that it’s all you know. That for you and Mycroft, anyway, lying is how you show you care.”
John reluctantly pulled the jar out from where he had been clutching it in his pocket. “A jar of salve, sir, I’m--”
“Oh, it’s warm!” Molly said, turning up her head in its stiff headdress to try to catch a bit of the sun on her face. They had just left the church after services. “Fancy going round the shops a bit? I hate to go back inside right away.”
“It’s all right. I don’t care if anyone knows I’m gay…and given the rubbish that’s been printed about me over the years probably no one would believe it anyway.”
Andrea Chisolm’s house was a small, one-story bungalow, depressing with its forlorn Christmas lights still drooping from the roof.  Rodriguez opened the door and they all wrinkled their noses at the smell. “We have got to get this place released,” Ryan muttered.
Sherlock made a rueful face, looking at his loose waistband. “Not in my middle. Where do we go for the barber?”
Sherlock stayed, unmoving, in the cave entrance whilst John readied the horse. “Stay right here,” John told him. “If anyone comes, hide. They’ll see Circe, but don’t let them see you. Understand?”
Sherlock looked back up the staircase, at the empty space where his room had been. Without realizing it he stepped closer, one riser, then two. His bedroom. The white room with the white bed, where he’d muffled his tears in the blue bedclothes whilst Eurus whispered,
“Of course he is.”  She sighed. “During the bloody holidays, no less. What the hell am I going to do once I sack her?”
Effie took the breakfast tray away with her, promising to bring back a pitcher of water, and Phillips shaved Sherlock with quick efficiency. He knew by now Sherlock would not bathe and instead he turned on the rarely-used shower taps, turning the water all the way to ice cold. Sherlock dropped his damp clothing to the ground and practically dove in, desperate for relief from the fire that seemed to rage beneath his skin. The cold soothed him for a few moments, but it was short lived. As soon as Sherlock tried to wash he found himself thrusting forward into his soapy hand, his other fingers shoving up into his wet and throbbing entrance entirely of their own volition. He was close, closer than he’d realized. Sherlock turned off the water and leaned against the cool tile. “Phillips!” he shouted.
“The Taliban had sent a backup team.” A muscle in Garrison’s jaw twitched. “We should have seen it coming—
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, and we were hoping you’d be godmother if it’s a girl. We’ve always wanted our daughter to grow up to sleep with married men.”
There was a low murmur too indistinct for John to hear and then Sir James, a bit louder: “--your little card games--”
“Quite,” Sherlock said distractedly. He didn’t move, so John took him by the arm and steered him to his bedroom and into bed. Trying to get him to wash seemed a bit of a lost cause at the moment. Sherlock was asleep before John even tucked up the duvet.
Sherlock set down his tea. He felt too hot, stifled by the warm room and the heaviness of the emotions, and he looked longingly at the French doors leading out to the bare garden. If only he could get some air!
Dr. Woodcourt stepped into the ward quietly and came over to Sherlock’s bed. He stooped to listen to his chest and check his pulse. When he straightened, he lay his hand gently over John’s where it clasped Sherlock’s. He did not say anything. There was no need.
There was a tremendous amount of shouting and hubbub on the street outside the pub. As John looked toward the door it burst open, and a man clutching a newspaper rushed in.
John looked as though he was still trying to seem annoyed, but the corners of his mouth twitched. “We’d better get straight on home,” he said. “You’re soaked to the skin.”
“Hmm.” Mycroft did not appear hurt by this information. “Obviously at that point I called in Mary Morstan and demanded a full accounting. At first she prevaricated, claiming that Magnussen was refusing to take the bait for her trap—she’d already postponed the wedding from May to August to buy more time--but eventually she admitted that she’d developed…
“Fair enough,” John said cheerfully. It was usual for someone to sleep in the barn, in case of fire or emergency. At Willoughby Chase he had spent his first two years bunking with the other stableboys in the hayloft.
When Sherlock woke he thought for moment he was alone in a white bedroom, but after blinking for a few minutes he realized that he was in a sort of hospital ward, with curtains on either side of his bed. It seemed to be evening, judging by the light on the wall he could see. The curtains were not pulled fully, and by turning his head he could see the beds on either side of him: both empty. He could hear a low murmur of conversation from somewhere nearby though, and a few moments later a woman appeared between the curtains. “Ah, you’re awake. Care for a cuppa? If you drink that down all right we can take that drip out.”
“You feel--you feel so good—tell me if this hurts you,” John pleaded, pushing into the warm wet slickness coating Sherlock’s abdomen. Sherlock, apparently unable to catch his breath yet, shook his head and buried his face in John’s hair, bracing himself as John’s tempo picked up until he came all over Sherlock in his turn.
Under the covers, the bed was still warm. John pulled Sherlock into his arms and Sherlock curled up gratefully, realizing that John was holding him as he did when Sherlock was deep in depression or obliterated from sex. He didn’t care. He felt warm and safe. He burrowed his cold nose into John’s shirt and thought of nesting things; soft-furred rabbits, cats curled together by a stove. Warmth.
“Additionally, Mr. Rhodes is 6 feet three inches and quite slender while the man Mr. Stegman saw was described by him as ‘big’, not tall; also he was 42 years old at this time and easily caught, so not ‘fast’,” Aronsen said crisply.
“What,” Sherlock said and tried to shake his head to clear the ringing from his ears, but that just knocked his temple against the floor so he sat up. “What—what did you—“
After a bit Sherlock sagged down and rested his cheek against the cool toilet seat. He felt utterly exhausted.
They both stood staring at the machine as though willing it to work faster. Sherlock sensed Molly carefully not looking at him.  He had the unpleasant feeling he sometimes got that she could see right through him: his presence there, undragged, unaccompanied, spoke of a vulnerability he didn’t want her to mention.  Sherlock picked up his tea, found it cold, and dipped a custard cream in anyway. “Biscuit?”
to. He willed it to happen, saw it in his mind’s eye: the door opening and Sherlock standing there, as indifferent to his undress as he had been at Buckingham Palace. “You took your time,” he’d drawl, sweeping his gaze over the soldier, and then, just to underscore that he hadn’t been worried at all, something like, “Well,
Sherlock touched his fingertips lightly to the scar. “Yes. I was trying to protect Movsar. He had lost an eye decades ago, fighting the Russians, and his vision in his good eye was fading…but he spoke the mountain dialects far better than I ever would. He said he was the ears and I was the eyes, and as long as we stuck together we would be fine.”
“It’s a shame you weren’t here when I arrived, you could have had some northern soil from my shoes. It’s all gone now.”
When they had got in the car John took both their wet coats and tossed them into the back, as Sherlock cranked up the heat so that the little car’s windows quickly clouded with steam. John noticed that Sherlock moved with difficulty, wincing when he had to apply pressure to the pedals, and that there were cushions tucked into his seat. “This is awful for you, isn’t it,” he said bluntly.
Molly’s Christmas cake was a great success, as was Lestrade’s contribution (drinks). By the time these had gone around a few times Sherlock was sprawled over the sofa with his head in John’s lap, apparently fast asleep. This at least spared them his acid commentary when Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson began singing a Christmas carol they insisted was “God Rest Ye Drunk Detectives,” although they never seemed able to get past the first line without falling over laughing.
The actual penetration was hard, almost too much, but John breathed him through it, Sherlock gripping his shoulders with desperate determination. John moved slowly, so slowly, stopping whenever the shivering threatened to overtake Sherlock, Sherlock focusing every particle of his being on matching John’s deep, even breaths.  “Sherlock,” he heard distantly. “Open your eyes.”
“I had a really nice time with you,” Michael said softly. “Really nice. I don’t usually say this, but if you’re ever in LA…”
“Tomorrow.” Sherlock blinked, clearly forcing his eyes to focus, and laid the violin tenderly in its case. “Tonight I want kissing.”
John pulled him into his arms again, laughing now, and began kissing him. “Irene says you did things I haven’t even done.”
“Yes,” Sherlock gasped and John pulled out and squeezed on more lube before tucking a third finger under the first two. He heard the
As time went on the past—both of their pasts--mattered less. Sherlock’s vulnerability drew from John a tenderness he had never been able to express with anyone else; it made him realize how guarded he had always been, how much of himself he had held back. He held nothing back from Sherlock. Sherlock needed his whole heart, all the love and affection John could give him; Sherlock
Mrs. Hudson had a sort of unofficial job as baker at Speedy’s, at least during the periods that her on-again, off-again relationship with the owner was in an “on” phase. John ducked inside and nodded at the handful of regulars he recognized: a couple of pensioners, the thin girl with a nose ring always scowling down at her laptop, the bloke in the green jacket who leisurely read the papers. Green Jacket and one of the pensioners nodded back. John collected his sandwich and coffee and Vijay behind the counter said, “Mrs. Hudson says for you to wait just a tick—you can go on back if you want.”
John glanced at Sherlock, but apparently the numbered account was off the record for now. “I know the autopsy results already,” Sherlock said when Lestrade reached for a folder.
They got him down the stairs, two of the guard-footmen practically carrying him, Sherlock gritting his teeth not to writhe. Down into the dim basement, past the wine cellars, through the heavy iron barred door and into the Red Room.
When the maid came to collect his tray—it was Effie this time, the stolid, boring one—she said, “Oh, are you ill?”
“He’s got nothing on you and he never will,” John said. “Now go to sleep--you’ve got to be ready early tomorrow.”
Sherlock did not answer directly, but his fingers wrapped around John’s hand. John was beginning to feel drowsy when Sherlock said suddenly, “As soon as I sell the first of the wine you must write your family.”
Sherlock had already read the papers, but if he sat on the sofa he could probably insinuate either his feet or his head into John’s lap and be petted. “Maybe in a bit. I’m just going to finish looking over a few things,” he said as indifferently as he could manage.
She took the stairs two at a time, hands shaking as she pulled the burner phone from its hiding place and punched in the number she knew so well. “Jezebel?”
He was not surprised when he came back after his first shift and found his things had been searched, although he was mildly impressed that they had found the secret compartment. He didn’t mind. There was nothing in there that would incriminate him; rather the opposite, since they would hardly expect a killer to go on the run without a gun. He wondered if Samiralliev had bothered to send Saidimir out, or had him assist. He looked over at his roommate. Saidimir was lying on his back listening to music through his earbuds, eyes closed, giving absolutely nothing away.
This second blow hit John like a fist in the gut. He bent double, trying to catch his breath. Finally, the nausea receded a little and he sat up, looking steadily at Tom. “Tell me.”
“We did,” Ned said, pulling some sugar from his own pocket. “And Terpsi too, she threw that tall one.” He affected a haughty drawl. “Oh dear me, I’ve
. Given my abysmal track record with relationships, it’s rather impressive you aren’t fretting about yourself.”
have laid a hand on you in anger and I never will again--we have to agree on that, Sherlock; if one of us is angry we have to cool off first. You know I have a temper; I’m not proud of it, and I try to control it, but I couldn’t live with myself if I really hurt you. Okay? Everything else is on the table, but not that.”
“Fine,” Sherlock replied and blithely ripped off his clothes. John pulled his shirt off, dragged Sherlock’s pillow under his head too, and lay back to let Sherlock poke and sniff and lick. It was weird, but not unpleasant. Sherlock’s interests seemed random—he spent ages on John’s ankles—and not particularly erotic. John’s initial erection, realizing it would not be needed any time soon, gave up and melted away.
“What’s wrong, lad?” John said kindly, but Sherlock was looking up, scanning the mountainside with quick flicks of his eyes.
Scrubbing the loo was nowhere near as much fun as chasing criminals around, but there was a certain satisfaction in it all the same. By nightfall the kitchen was stocked, the bathroom was gleaming, and John’s bed was made with clean sheets. A good day’s work, John thought with satisfaction. He’d bought plenty of worthy dinner ingredients, but now he felt he’d earned a night out. He came out into the lounge and peered down at Sherlock, who had done nothing more strenuous than nap all day. He was also wearing John’s socks again.
Garrison was still talking, apparently enjoying John’s shock. “I spent a lot of time hiding in the empty bedroom; she never went in there. I tapped your computer, I looked through your mail, everything. I got nowhere.”
“I’m afraid even to try. Right now I’m certain he doesn’t know he’s under suspicion—I’ve been extremely discreet. He probably doesn’t even realize we’ve connected these murders.”
“Thanks.” She squinted up at him, still half asleep. “You look done in. Big night out with the boys?”
“I met with Ian Braithewaite,” Lestrade said. “He was adamant that he had barely been to the aquatic centre all summer and that he had never met James Allen, and his mother backed him up. We took a picture of him back to James and he was a bit startled. He admitted that he had never seen Ian Braithewaite before, but he gave us a description of the boy he had known: slight, dark hair, very blue eyes.” They all looked at Sherlock, with his very blue eyes, and Sherlock looked at the floor. “I went to the music workshop, although honestly I thought that was likely to be a lie as well, and of course they wouldn’t just hand over a list of the attendees that summer. But when I asked the director if they’d had anyone who matched the description I saw that he knew who I meant, and he was willing to identify you to me based on that. I remembered your name right away from reading the old case file. They should have listened to you last spring, looks like.”
before the smell hit him. Gagging, he flung himself at the small bin by the desk—thank God he hadn’t gotten around to eating his toast—and clutched it to his chest as he staggered frantically to the window and flung it open. Passersby beneath scurried to the other side of the street as he hung out the window, gagging and clutching the bin. Behind him he could hear Sherlock retching into the kitchen sink.
“Please.” Sherlock felt he was no longer capable of coherent speech, was not even sure what he was asking for, but it didn’t matter. John would know. John would give him whatever he needed. “Please. Please.”
“Ever. I preferred to focus on my work. Also I’ve never really been the relationship type; most people can’t stand my company for that long. But when I was younger I was more, er…”
Sherlock felt a flush rise in his cheeks. He had absolutely no intention of getting pregnant in any case, so there was no reason he would endanger himself by some sort of convoluted scheme to get Captain Watson or any other alpha to mate him a minute before he had to. Ever. Under no circumstances.
That sort of trauma…has he the strength to live through it again? He wonders about the sort of life he’s led that makes him the recipient of so much love, and such vicious hatred. What exactly is he inheriting from this sad, battered man?
He was at the flat, soaking up the last of the adrenaline high from the Monroe case. He was bored, trying to stretch out his last few milligrams to make it ‘til Thursday. And that’s it, nothing else, nothing remotely interesting, dramatic, or at all helpful.
Uncomfortable in his clothes, his sheets, his skin, even his brand of toothpaste; it’s not just the world that changed, he just doesn’t know who he
. All gone. Memories are all we have in the end, they are what shape us, influence our decisions, our likes, our dislikes. They make us who we are, and without them?
"Then get the hell off of me!" It's less of a command than he'd have liked. In fact it's 67% shriek. But apparently full-blown hysterics aren't enough of a hint, and the arms he'd dropped come back to both of Sherlock’s shoulders.
He’s been clean for nearly six years. Two thousand, one hundred, and ninety days of his existence; and he doesn’t remember a second. Apparently Martha Hudson is his
He blinks, and he’s back in the flat, only to find that John has moved away from him, taken two large steps back. He looks frightened.
The problem with warzones and the human psyche, is not the conflict itself. Human instinct and self-preservation can carry people through even the worst of traumas. After the fact, matters are entirely different; the immediate threat is gone, and those automatic defences won’t shield you anymore. The most damaging impact, often comes in the form of safety.
“You didn’t have them when you left.” John’s voice is very quiet. He looks deeply troubled by this; “What sort of scars?”
It had taken years, but he’d learnt to control it, to keep his heart in check. He became logical, disciplined; pushing down all that sentiment and holding it there by brute force. He’s proud of that strength, he’d worked hard on it. Only now with a snap of a finger he finds it all to be undone, all that weakness so much closer to the surface.
With the luxury of time to reflect, the mind begins to process the trauma. When you have known nothing but war, being introduced to a life of peace shows you everything you did not have. Hindsight tells you just how bad it was, and just how good life
John is angry too. Some of it is grief. Most of it is frustration. Because if Sherlock would just fucking

He surprises himself; because until John got upset, he’d had every intention of ignoring him. Before he wouldn’t have even bothered to lie. But really, what would be the point? John is right, there’s nothing to be learnt from a potentially conflicting account.
When asked, Sherlock shrugs. John looks at him for a long time and stops searching. The next day, the book is back, with the handwritten message forged to perfection. The exact same condition of use, coffee stain placed perfectly. And yet, he still senses John knows it’s not the original.
Overnight he’s been thrust straight from his run down flat on Montague street, to some hospital bed seven years into the future, with absolutely no recollection of the journey taken to get there. Nothing feels real about this, and he finds himself still clinging to the desperate hope that none of it
Which isn’t very helpful. Frankly alarming actually; someone hurtling towards you in a moment of weakness. This man is agitated, and Sherlock’s own agitation only plays off that further. His anxiety hits the roof.
It gives him the room to think about other things, to try and sift through the chaos in his head, and just generally makes everything a hundred times easier.
feel. Suppressing it is proving to be much harder than he remembers. It’s like every point of reference has moved. His moorings are gone and without them he’s incredibly unstable.
John is at work and it pisses it down all day. He hates the rain, he hates John not being here, but he hates John even more.
He stares at John, but he won’t answer, god, why can’t he remember any of this? How could he possibly forget
As he becomes more aware of his surroundings he notes that the room is not quiet, it’s positively brimming with sound; a constant metronome of repetitive noises emanating from the small army of machines and equipment about his head.
He doesn’t want to care about these people, these strangers who keep staring, keep touching him. But the way their faces fall when they find only incomprehension staring back…it almost feels wrong to disappoint them.
It’s cruel to expect anything of Sherlock right now, and it’s not fair to blame him for forgetting. But even though he knows better, John feels it too. A tiny part of him can’t help but think that maybe it’s because he just wasn’t important enough to remember.
Sherlock is still funny. But he’s not doing it on purpose anymore; he doesn’t say it for John, he doesn’t
they’re real, that they belong to him. But John hopes to god that’s not true, because if they are, then they’re
The simple truth is; Sherlock could choose to leave tomorrow, and there wouldn’t be a damn thing he could do about it. Sherlock has every right to walk away, John’s not his keeper; he doesn’t even
Within a minute his heart rate has increased by 20bpm, and breathing is becoming increasingly difficult. He didn't know he was capable of panic like this.
When John is relaxed, Sherlock is suspicious, When John is concerned, Sherlock gets angry. He’s constantly shifting, and John just can’t keep up. It affects everything. That tension has become their life now, or rather;
The impact should have killed him instantly, shattering his skull, severing his spinal cord, causing massive internal trauma. His lungs should have collapsed as his chest cavity caved in. His face should be unrecognisable; mandible, maxilla, nasal cavity; all shattered. Joints should have been crushed, organs pulverised. It’s just not

. John held his breath for the first 72 hours, because statistically, they’re critical. After that it becomes less and less likely that the memories will return. John is crying because he’s giving up. And Sherlock doesn’t
It’s all just word associations, just fragments, but it’s proof that the memories are still in there. They’re smiling now, because after weeks, they’re finally getting somewhere. They run through a few, and Sherlock comes up with an answer to each, they don’t make any sense to Sherlock really, but John looks so happy it’s infectious.
At a local swimming pool, he stares at his shoes, and waits, with absolutely no idea who or what for. But the anticipation keeps him waiting, his right pocket suddenly so much heavier.
John times it perfectly, lunging forward just as Sherlock begins to fall, catching him under the armpits, each on different sides of the hand rail. Crushing Sherlock’s ribs, he hurls him back over the railing.
. It doesn’t begin to sink in; it yanks him back like a seatbelt, airbags smoking and smashing him in the face.
John’s knees give out, and he drags Sherlock down with him. They’re both in a heap on the metal walkway, cold seeping in through their clothes. John still hasn’t let go of Sherlock’s chest.
His mind is brilliant yes, but weak. Oh, he’ll deny it to his last breath, but he’s always known. He is reckless, and has little to no impulse-control to speak of. He has always been more…affected, than others. Sherlock Holmes is a lot more delicate than he would have the world believe.
He pushes him, shoves as hard as he can manage. Which as it turns out, is quite impressive. Sober literally
Being dragged vertically by your armpits over a metal bar is not fun. Neither is the jerk when something abruptly stops your fall, slamming your hip against a fire escape. How John even manages to catch him is a mystery.
he know? Surely of all people he would, they’re supposed to be best friends. John knows about his drug addiction, his mind palace, his danger nights; even that he wanted to be a pirate as a child. They’ve lived together for years, practically inseparable. Sherlock liked him, trusted him more than anyone in the world. Why has he never told him?
The music stand clatters down, papers flying around his head. The bookcase stops his momentum dead, and he cowers in the corner behind his chair. He doesn’t remember leaving it. Not this again.
The screaming descends into tears, and John is sobbing into his chest. Sherlock immediately cups the back of his head, face in his hair, rocking them gently.
He doesn’t want to go back to being nobody. To waiting around doing nothing, fingers twitching at the sound of sirens. Useless. He used to keep a loaded gun by his bedside, just in case; and there’s no reason for a civilian to be doing that. No good ones anyway.
John isn’t just interested in fixing the amnesia problem either, with that he’s hardly pushed at all. It’s other things that don’t even come across as deliberate. John makes dinner every night, regardless of whether or not he eats it. He makes Sherlock tea before he even thinks to want it; the perfect amounts of milk and sugar, every time. He takes care of the bills, does the shopping, makes sure the flat is nice and warm at night.
He stares at the plastic railing around the bed, tracking the minute aberrations and distortions; too close, and too blurred. His focus is scattered. Did he overdose? Get stabbed, hit by a bus? He scans his memory for some sort of explanation as to where he is and how he got here, but comes up disturbingly blank.
something. A tugging sensation in his forehead, like something is being literally pulled out of his brain. The metaphor is so ridiculous it’s annoying.
How long until he grows tired of playing nice for everyone else’s sake? Until he stops conforming to what he believes is expected of him? John suspects he’s biding his time until he can escape.
There’s no point in trying to go back to the life he knows; to forget about any of this, find the nearest drug den and get as wasted as physically possible. No. Sherlock is sick of drugs and resentment, and for once, the world is on his side. There’s an opportunity here, a real life he’s made for himself. But that life just won’t have him.
Finding the remote for the bed, he tilts himself up, closes his eyes, and waits. Hands clasped in his lap, he focusses on controlling each breath, time measured only in the sharp pings and tones of the monitors. He waits for a long time, projecting calm, willing it to come back to him. He consciously tenses and relaxes every muscle in his body, twice.
Changes in society are pronounced. He could get married now if he wanted. He doesn’t of course, he just never thought he’d have the option, and it gives him an odd sort of feeling. He wonders if Victor is married now.
depression, he knows what bad looks like. And he’d be lying if he said there hadn’t been times in his life where he’d been tempted. Staring at the needle, he’d think about how all he had to do, is push just a little more. The slightest bit of pressure, and everything would go away.
Sherlock doesn’t remember who he was, or how he had grown in the seven years he’s lost. The only tangible proof that any of this is real, is found in his reflection. The man staring back could only be him, and yet, time has made its changes. He finds himself adorned with new lines and wrinkles, aberrations that tell a story of expression; pain, laughter, frowning…joy?
It’s what he’d hoped for; one second and it all comes rushing back. He supposes it’s the moment they’ve all been waiting for. Sensationalised by Hollywood, these moments do happen. It’s the quick fix.
John doesn’t know if he could watch that, if he could let him leave. But it’s not like he could make him stay.
“Stamford,” Sherlock’s mouth finishes before his brain has a chance to catch up. He stops, eyes wide, and looks to John for answers.
He wants to break the mirror with both fists, to scream with rage, get the fuck out. But something stops him, and that’s new, because previously he wouldn’t have hesitated.
He is somewhat reassured to find that he is still in possession of both his faculties and his limbs, but something is off about this. Even his transport feels different, very unlike himself, he just cannot place how. It’s maddening.
The biggest concern, as Mycroft sees it; is Sherlock’s work regarding Moriarty. When it comes back is when things will get messy. There are already signs, but his brother does not remember the dreams. By his calculations, they have only days before the flashbacks kick in.
Sherlock has never in his life been classified as part of the majority, and as time goes on, the chances for spontaneous recall begin to diminish. If no memories have surfaced after two weeks, that can indicate a recovery time of months or even years. After that, a full recovery may never be possible. His age, and history of substance abuse are added variables.
It all changes so quickly. His head doesn’t spin, there’s no explosion, and he doesn’t black out. One blink, and when his eyes reopen; there’s so much more. The fall didn’t wake him up;
Sherlock’s right hand tingles, and he stares at it. He can actually feel the other man’s hand in his, holding it, shaking it? His hand is warm, and his grip is firm. Then blood. Blood everywhere, and panic like he’s never felt before.
. Sherlock feels their eyes on him, always watching with their big, sad eyes, begging him to remember them.
But John isn’t taking it in, he just keeps crying, and Sherlock realises he’s given up on this a long time ago; resigned to bits and pieces. For the second time, his best friend believes that he is dead.
John steps forward and roughly grabs his leg, whilst Sherlock does his best to kick him, swearing furiously under his breath. John Watson is the bigger person; he forces Sherlock’s leg into place and holds it there until the muscles relax.
He’s in more pain than he should be; not all of it real. History just can’t stop repeating itself. He wonders how it happened last time. He already knows the result; evidence of electrical burns fused into his skin. Sherlock just wants to know why.
They interrogate him about social media platforms he didn’t know existed, people he’s never heard of, events in history that haven’t happened. The verdict is bad. He can tell from their faces; these are things that everyone should know, background information you can’t help but pick up.
He laughs less when he tries to drag himself to bed. Typically, his calf takes example from his other leg, and it takes a good 5 minutes of moaning on the floor before it goes away. If he hadn’t chased him off, John could have fixed it in seconds; bastard.
people in. Not ever. He’s spent years building that fortress around his heart; he’d thought it to be impenetrable.
.  But mostly the fear of such terrible consequences. The scars on his back begin to ache, ‘Moriarty’ making his mind spin, such a visceral response. What is Moriarty?

white; cheap mass-produced plasterboard framed by a (too sharp, too small) skirting board. It connects to a simple utilitarian dry wall, equally as cheap; clearly designed for rapid construction rather than quality. Floating wall; blasphemy.
Thankfully, Sherlock shows no symptoms of sliding down that particular slope. It’s also encouraging to see that at least some things are coming back to him, even if only delivered by his subconscious.
you where you can fucking go, I was worried sick!” John is glaring like a jealous wife, and his audacity has Sherlock angry again.
Imagine meeting someone who already knows everything about you, all the parts you thought you’d locked away. Details they have no right to, an intimacy you can’t even imagine. That’s a horrifying thought for anyone. But Sherlock doesn’t

It’s very common in refugee victims forced to flee their home. It’s when the individual is settled that the issues really start to come out; sometimes it can take as long as two years for symptoms to present.
So much he’s missed, advances in technology, science, human achievement…These are important things, things that have shaped society and left their mark; influencing words, people, opinions, and actions. He lacks all context.
work with the police. He doesn’t want to believe a word of it, but his reflection…his reflection does not lie.
doctor, because he’s certainly not here in any official capacity, malpractice case perhaps, but he’s still arrogant enough to think he has the right...
He remembers what it’s like to be him, and he remembers what it’s like to have forgotten, to have done the things he’s done, acted the way he has. What John has been through.  Oh god.
Sherlock remembers what it was like to forget; he remembers when his closest friends were strangers, and doesn’t know if he can ever begin to forgive himself for that.
They tell him its retrograde amnesia. That he’s lost a bit of time is all. They won’t say at first, quite how
John has literally just walked in from work and he’s tired, but Sherlock has been going mad with boredom, and he’s asked the question at least six times today. For some reason he’d assumed that John was here the whole time, when in fact he has been gone for over seven hours, which is
Without his memory, Sherlock has no way of confirming what people are telling him. Everything is hearsay. It must be bizarre to be led into a room and be told it’s your home, or introduced to people who are supposedly your oldest friends; a space you do not recognise, filled with people you have never laid eyes on before.
Scans say the trauma was isolated to the right frontal lobe. It suggests that the amnesia is specific to autobiographical events, rather than the more fundamental aspects. He is still a chemist, and his fingers will remember every note on the strings.
Those hopeless hours in the night; everyone feels them at times. The powerlessness hurts more than any nightmare.
Sherlock is still Sherlock, but he hides it now; John’s not allowed to know he’s human anymore. And Sherlock is not allowed to be happy.
When John comes home, he’s not in a foul mood, but he’s definitely still upset. It’s total silence, and Sherlock can’t ignore it. He tells himself it was John in the wrong, but feels deeply unhappy all the same.
He’s tried only using the top sheet, shivering until he can get to sleep. But it’s nothing to do with how warm he is. Sleeping naked has the same result, only exacerbating the cold. Exhausted, and desperate, he gropes for a towel; one laid out underneath, and one covering his torso; too tired to change the sheets. John gets annoyed when he can’t find a towel.
And who is this man they thought they knew, the man they claim he was? Sherlock doesn’t know the first thing about him. And what if he doesn’t want to be that man anymore? Would he even
John gets up from his chair, snatches the laptop out of his hands without warning, slams the lid shut, marching back across the room. “Use your bloody own if you want, I know you know which one it is.”
“Where have you been?” John’s hands are actually on his hips. It would be funny if he had the strength to care.
“You, Lestrade, and Mrs Hudson. The three people I had to save. He killed himself to force my hand.”
He trashes the laptop, grabs it by the screen and smashes it into the coffee table until it snaps in two.
John crouches next to him, eyes calm and gentle. Both of them very aware that Sherlock is having a severe panic attack. That’s
The police come to the flat, and Sherlock is immediately suspicious. But they’re not here to arrest him; they’ve come to ask for
He doesn’t even complain. At all. That part John would never have expected. In his situation, John would be angry. He would get upset and frustrated. He would shout and break things, taking his pain out on the world around him.
Sometimes there are moments in life where logic leaves a person seemingly without cause. People break, it happens. Everyone likes to think themselves strong, but the human psyche is a fragile thing; one crack too many is all it takes.
Sherlock will come back to them, they can’t hide it. But what will happen if he doesn’t ever remember, if he is stuck this way; world without end?
At first it seemed too good to be true, but eventually, he realised that there were no special allowances; it was just something John
He never lets others get to know that side, the human parts. But John was allowed; he saw it every day. They solved murders, played games with Cluedo and with psychopaths, and god help him; it was
Then John’s voice will whisper low and calm into his ear, and just like that, Sherlock is back on his feet. John Watson is better than

him. John could stand right here in the living room, palms sweating, sick to his stomach as he watches Sherlock striding out the door like he couldn’t give a toss. And he probably wouldn’t.
He tries to be patient, to remember that it’s not Sherlock’s fault he doesn’t trust John; but it’s not easy.
They’re just flatmates, two vastly different people inexplicably sharing the same roof. That’s all. So why does everyone speak as if they are
Occasionally Sherlock will say something clever and John can’t help but laugh, because though people don’t seem to know it, Sherlock has a wicked sense of humour. He’s
Sherlock almost cries, because the human mind is so cruel. Memories are one thing, we can make plenty more of those, but we don’t think about the other things they take with them when they go. The chemicals released when we look at those we know.
Everyone knows that Sherlock Holmes is not a nice person; he can tear you down to nothing in a single sentence. John’s seen him do it. It’s mad, but there’s still no one else he’d rather talk to.
John is screaming in his face, shaking his shoulders violently, and standing with all his weight on Sherlock’s foot just in case he wriggles free.
It’s all building up in his head, the confusion. He’d describe it as a nightmare, but he already has quite enough of those. There is just so much
John didn’t know that Sherlock had nightmares. He’d never shown signs of it before. He’d try to write it off as part of the amnesia, but something feels wrong about that. Just like something has felt wrong about Sherlock ever since he came back. He couldn’t place it before, but this feels exactly the same, his intuition screaming there’s a connection.
Because these people; they don’t want him. They want the other one, the one he stole from them, the one he
It’s the type of thing that once you’ve noticed the discrepancy, it becomes impossible to ignore; like discovering a hidden panic room after measuring the walls. You can see something is there, but lack the means to access it.
impressive. Diagnosis; night sweats. Actual droplets of sweat roll down his limbs, drying on the surface of his skin. They make him feel so cold.
The same can be said for the opposite side of the spectrum. A child runs up to him on the street, sprinting after him along the pavement. He asks for his
for? He’d tried to wait for it to come on its own, avoiding the temptation of the internet in all its unreliable glory. But after the autograph incident, and the man who tried to throttle him in the biscuit isle…well, that’s enough to make anyone curious.
He remembers falling, flailing through the air, plummeting to his death. He remembers how it felt, the cold wind stinging his face, the pavement below getting closer and closer; god he was so scared.
Before the accident, the worst had only just begun to settle in, and though the amnesia acts as a reprieve, Sherlock’s past will not wait forever.
He slaps himself six times in front of the mirror until his eyes water and his skin smarts; and still sees thirty six year old Sherlock Holmes staring back at him, just with a slightly reddened cheek.
This whole predicament feels like a rush of blood to the head. Paranoia and fear dominate his thoughts, and he’s only too aware of it happening. He’s not sure he can do this, but where would he run?
He can be so furious at him, so done with all his shit in that moment that he could swear blind that he’s finished. But one fantastic insult, muttered under his breath at some poor unsuspecting sod; and it’s all worth it. Sherlock makes him laugh so hard he’s shaking.
It feels like he’s bacteria on a slide, with the whole of London staring down the microscope; waiting for him to move.
He’s childish; he whinges, sulks loudly, and is just generally incapable of looking after himself. He takes Cluedo ridiculously seriously and indexes his fucking sock drawer. But his good moods, they’re a whirlwind, and he is absolutely, undeniably, irrefutably
“I promise,” he blurts out. He’s never promised a damn thing in his life. But he’ll do his best to keep it if it will stop John Watson from crying.
But what he’s saying isn’t true. He remembers it vividly, the memory more intense than anything happening now.
He finds himself being dragged, half standing, as far away from the drop as is possible, and being held against the wall by force.
There’s only so much data you can get staring at a ceiling. Especially with a mind so alarmingly fuzzy.
Now Sherlock’s casual sarcasm catches John off guard, because he’d almost forgotten what it used to be like. It’s as much a comfort as it is a painful reminder.
John walks into a room, and no matter what the angle or intentions he brings, Sherlock is already bracing for a fist fight. He pretends not to see it, but he knows Sherlock doesn’t want this. John catches him staring, looking at him with something close to resentment in his eyes. Sherlock is hostile, and John is unwelcome. But Christ, he can’t let him go.
. He’s…successful? Sherlock tries to ask the sergeant, Donovan (?) if there are any more cases she needs help with, but she just mutters something nasty under her breath. He is startled, not quite knowing what he did wrong;
be; the man whose face he wears. They must hate him a little, looking at him day after day, knowing that he is not the man they knew and loved, but an imposter; unfinished.
John has answers to stupid things, like how to fix the hot water when it goes iffy (there’s a very specific order you have to jiggle the taps), or why his damn phone won’t do what he wants. People keep saying words on cases, at crime scenes; concepts Sherlock doesn’t understand, questions he doesn’t know how to answer. He’ll freeze, treading water on dry land; hopelessly out of his depth.
Sherlock likes John. And it’s surprising because he hadn’t intended to care about the stupid little soldier. He tried to hate him, to push him away. But despite his efforts, Sherlock has grown used to having him around. John is somehow always there to fill in the blanks, and it had never occurred to him just how
Of all the hundreds of ways John could lose him, one thug with a fist is all it took. Just some idiot in a moment of panic. Sherlock’s skull hit the ground hard. John can still hear the crack.
All the scans showed no change in brain structure, no real traumatic injury, there’s no reason for this to be so extensive.  What is
He waits until they leave the room before he loses it. It’s been only hours since he woke, and so much has happened. Literally
Walking past a hospital makes him wonder how many people died, just outside the walls; the ambulances just seconds too late to get the patient through the doors.
mean stronger, not that he can really appreciate that right now with his heart trying to pound its way out of his chest.
Seeing his brother walk through that door…he nearly wept with relief. He hasn’t gone insane. Whoever would have thought Mycroft could be a comfort?
The bed beneath him is too narrow for a hotel, boasts an uncomfortably thin mattress, scratchy, low thread count sheets, and the harsh aroma of industrial cleaning products.
is the one who has travelled back in time; back to when he was first invalidated home, before he met Sherlock. Because really, without Sherlock, John’s life isn’t anything much at all.
The man who comes through it, his face changes instantly upon registering Sherlock's distress, exaggeratedly so.
. It sounds so domestic to say it, but hearing him grumble about idiots, curse so imaginatively at the telly that it’s unbelievable; these were the highlights of John’s day.
Faked his suicide. This isn’t a film. There are only a handful of people in history who are known to have successfully faked their own deaths, most being caught and arrested after only a few days. Five minutes on Wikipedia will tell you that. He could probably make a pretty convincing job of it if he tried, but jumping from a rooftop in the middle of central London? Too many people, too many cameras, too many variables; it’s impossible.
John goes white as a sheet. Was that the right answer? Dumping his work bag unceremoniously, and shucking his coat, John sinks into His Chair. They stare at each other, and for the first time since the blog argument, John dares to look hopeful. Oh and Christ, how Sherlock doesn’t want to let him down.
even, more than he’s been in a decade, but that cannot be possible. His whole body feels…changed somehow, so he can’t be sure of anything.
He’s never known pain like that, nor the fear and humiliation that comes with it. He knows in his very core, that the story those scars tell is not one he could survive. Sometimes his dreams, they leave him skittish for days after, jumping at the slightest sound, sweating and desperate. And he doesn’t remember even them
Mycroft looks older as well, and (annoyingly) far slimmer than Sherlock has ever known him to be. He’s also strangely less…Mycrofty, in the sense that Sherlock can bear to be in his presence for extended periods of time. It comes as a disturbing shift in their relationship, but Sherlock will take it, because Mycroft Holmes is the first face he’s encountered that is familiar to him.
“Look, don’t answer if you don’t want to,” John licks his lips nervously, “but do you know what you meant when you said that everyone was going to die?”
Sherlock is surprised by things John wouldn’t have thought to question; like the contents of his wardrobe. It never even occurred to him that Sherlock hadn’t always worn suits.
John’s face does something really strange, and he’s worried he will cry again, but he doesn’t. He makes the tea, and Sherlock doesn’t read the blog again. He never got more than two lines into it anyway. He doesn’t even
? People rarely say what they actually mean, and what John is saying, screaming actually; is that he doesn’t want him to. But Sherlock doesn’t give a single shit what John wants. It’s his life; he has a right to know.
The experiment could not have better results. It’s perfect, and the last thing from satisfying. Because he knows in his bones; he’s done it before. Spite makes him hope he’s had more success this time around.
He watches the Detective Inspector’s heart break in front of him. They first met in 2008; he’s forgotten Gregory Lestrade by just a matter of months. They were close, you can see it in his face, and John Watson may have lost a friend, but at least in his eyes; this man lost a son.
He walks out into the rain and runs to exhaustion, then walks until he physically cannot take another step.
Oh, he’s going through with it; in order to recreate the fear, one must also recreate the intent. Cause and effect. The landing is calculated of course, and it’s only one story, but there’s still margin for error. Then again, if he hits his head hard enough, it might just do the trick.
His laptop hasn’t been opened in days, because what should he do with it? Reading is impossible. He reads the same paragraph three times, places the book neatly in the kitchen sink, and turns the faucet on so hard the pipes bang.
It shows in the most basic of ways; how Sherlock reacts to John, their body language, the misinterpretations. Their wires are somehow always crossed, and it’s just so
He ignores trivia for the most part, like the prime minister, or crap telly, which football team has won the league; pointless things that don’t matter. He doesn’t
a rehabilitation facility. It’s not even a local detox bed, though the private room reeks of Mycroft’s involvement.
Why would he do that?! It’s so deeply personal, so exposing. Sherlock does not trust him, he thinks he might even hate him, and wants to run. But he can’t, not yet. Because of the puzzle.
“I’m covered in them. I think I dream about them sometimes. But they’re not right for an impact. If it didn’t happen when I fell, then where did they come from?”
like something he’d do, but he cannot escape the facts. John Watson would not make this up; John Watson would not lie to him.
“Or, it will give you a summarised, second hand version of mine. ‘Sensationalised drivel’ I believe you called it.”
Sherlock has done his research. Retrograde amnesia is a difficult condition in terms of recall, in the sense that the so called ‘reminder effect,’ has been proven largely ineffective. For post-traumatic retrograde amnesia, the majority of cases resolve themselves.
There are some memories that he is even afraid to recover. Because it would be impossible to avoid the fact that he has suffered. That at some point, his life has gone horribly,
John shakes his head, subtly trying to wipe the snot on his sleeve. He won’t look at him, and Sherlock hasn’t felt guilt like this since childhood.
you! You think you have the right? Fuck you Sherlock Holmes. You’re a machine, you actually fucking are!”
John looks quite cross now. It’s been a long day at the surgery, and he thinks Sherlock is toying with him. But Sherlock is excited; he’s
This old Sherlock is sharper and raw. That, coupled with what he must be going through means the doors of communication are firmly shut. John knows that he gets angry when he sees these things he doesn’t understand, and at John
“I know. You bring this up why exactly?” Sherlock glances at their hands, fingers moving unconsciously.
John enters his room freshly bathed. He stops drying his hair, noticing that the detective is using his laptop on his bed.
A content sigh left John as he pulled Sherlock’s arms closer around him. The detective began to pull out, John clenching to keep all that is in him from spilling out. He felt Sherlock’s heaviness return on top of him, lips pecking at his sweaty back before moving up to the back of his neck.
“I’m the sick one and again you get off on doing less work,” John called over his shoulder. He spoke so casually, making it so easy from Sherlock to wrap his arms around the other and simply slide back in. A secret in this room, another between where their bodies met. Here Sherlock held John close, their pants slipping through the air as the most sensitive parts of them collided. It was equal and raw. John pushing back as much as Sherlock pushed in. There was no need to hold back anymore as they appeared as one shadow in John’s darkroom.
For the first time Sherlock stays silent. Only the breaths they nearly share can be heard. John’s skin vibrates as the seconds draw longer. The position they are in, how needed he felt. Sherlock’s eyes slip into slivers as his stubbornness and intent writes itself clearly on his face. He wasn’t letting it go either, it seems.
” Sherlock repeated like he couldn’t imagine that’s the first thing that came to his flatmate’s mind.
“I just got back, where are you heading off too?” Disbelief was written on John’s features at the concept of the other leaving so suddenly.
“I thought you accounted for all variables?” John trails his hand up Sherlock’s back. His muscles tense under his touch. He pulls his dressing robe down slowly, his ears catching the detective's shaky breath. His arms start to shift, becoming restestless in his hold.
“You’re getting angry when there is no need, John. I know your masculinity is fragile but I was merely stating observations.”
“Go on without them.” A completely different tone from his shyness prior, much more like the Sherlock John knew. It was said without hesitation, a completely serious expression on his face. The baritone in his voice made John’s drugged body shake but he just nodded. Where their hands intertwined became increasingly hot. He pressed his lips to Sherlock’s steadily wrinkling shirt, moving downwards. As he got lower their joined hands followed, making him feel less alone in his exploration. He then got to his fly,
“More, John…” Sherlock’s wrecked voice grumbles out, saliva glistening on his chin. John pulls out completely, getting a relieved sigh from the taller man. Still, the dark haired man shivered under him. John slips off Sherlock’s underwear. Sweat covered both of their bodies, the detective’s cock an angry shade of red.
“I used a random person for my exploration but then you willingly volunteered. My motives are clear, and if you don’t understand that... well, I’ll find someone else.” It was all too much. John is incapable of looking away as the other speaks. It was as if a spotlight followed the detective around, heating up the doctor’s skin.
“It doesn’t do that… I wouldn’t think…” He was pulled out for only a moment before two hands wrapped around him.
“You weren’t kidding.” Sherlock looked at him confused. Kneeling up a bit, still holding onto the brunette’s hands John brought his thigh between Sherlock’s legs making him jolt. The sight of his clad leg between his friend’s well-ironed pants made him want to ruin the other. Sherlock had always appeared put together since the first day they met. Never in John’s life did he think a day would come where he’d love nothing more than to burn every article of dashing clothing his friend owned.
“I don’t know.” At this he releases his grip, trailing that hand up the detective’s ribs. With a parting pat, John rolls off the other. Sherlock rises up, confusion in his face as he watches the other plug in his laptop. The sight was almost laughable if it didn’t turn John on so much. The robe barely covers his chest or shoulders. His messy curls perfectly frame his pouting, slightly rosey, face.
have done something, you were almost as good as candy.” Sherlock places a hand to his forehead, bewildered by how self-assured the other was about everything they were doing. It had to be the drugs. It
“And what are you thinking?” This was odd. John was never asked about what he thought unless it was prompted by Sherlock’s leading questions.
“You two are a part of the family.” Angelo reaches over and ruffles Sherlock’s hair. John shifts, noticing the detective’s concealed discomfort.
At the sound of bags being dropped on the ground, Sherlock opened one eye, glaring at the sniveling man.
, hair tousled in every direction already. He moved their hands to the detective’s bulge tenting painfully under his boxers.
He releases and rubs the remaining lube onto his entrance. John rakes his hands along Sherlock’s thighs, parting them more. The doctor’s stiff cock rubs against the other’s hole before pressing forward. Sherlock’s tight opening givesm John's tip making it in. Burying himself in further, his friend’s walls tighten. John leans down, careful not to go in any further. He guides the detective to his lips, running his tongue sensually against the other’s. John’s cock jumps inside of Sherlock, making the detective moan.
“This experiment is an official one, right? I reckon you have a hypothesis?” John doesn’t know what to expect. All he is trying to dig for is some clarification and to be on the same page as the other. Although the detective could be unbearably obnoxious at times, his mind still fascinates John.
John rose off of Sherlock entirely, making him groan. He laid beside his flatmate, turning to half lay on his stomach, perching his left leg on a pillow.
“You might be right. Probably just pressure then.” Sherlock sucks his teeth in disappointment but he does not sound entirely convinced that he was wrong.
“Hm, interesting” John spoke, as if they were discussing the newest homicide that came today. He leans lower bringing Sherlock’s balls into his mouth. The brunette’s legs jolt, his hands flying down to the other’s hair.
“You don’t have control of your experiment?” A cheeky smile slips onto the doctor’s face despite the other’s inability to see it.
With a scowl he tossed the useless experiment away, creating enough room to fit precisely one banana. After seeing this, Sherlock slammed the fridge shut, hands combing through his hair in annoyance.
” John’s body went rigid as Sherlock pounded again and again at that spot. He tightened enticingly around him, giving the detective a second wind. Right as he felt the first spasm of John’s walls he turned him fulling on his stomach, fucking into him just right. His arms never left from around the other his body moving faster as he began to spill deep into the other. John choked out a pretty moan, pushing back into the prodding he felt on the inside, releasing and dribbling all over his sheets.
At this, Sherlock’s eyes finally focus on who he’s talking to instead of trying to get past. Seems like that was exactly what he needed to hear.
After longer than necessary, all the groceries were in place. If John had done it this would have gone quicker but something important would have been thrown in the bin. Sherlock’s eyes drift to the last experiment he kept in the bottom of the fridge. He had been working on his favorite champagne. He had convinced Molly, with much persuasion, to give him an array of stimulants in powdered form.
“Lestrade called. It may be a sorry excuse for a case but I can’t stand not doing something right now.” John notices the tension in Sherlock’s face and the billions of thoughts that were running behind his eyes. This type of erratic deduction was dangerous, because it usually ended with Sherlock using after being clean for so long.
“As I scratched you, it quickened quite a bit.” The detective’s face held the smallest traces of humor, making John’s brows raise in surprise.
“Please…” Sherlock’s eyes screw shut, his hips moving to fuck himself on his flatmate’s finger. John slips out of him, leaning over to rummage in his drawer before pulling out lube. He coats two fingers.
John fucks his tongue into the other man’s mouth, pushing in further. The lube makes the slip easier, his cock filling the detective up. Sherlock’s walls clench and flutter around him, any movement sending him into a fit of shakes. To John’s surprise the other lifts his legs to wrap around his hips, angling him deeper. Experimenting, John slowly pulls out. Sherlock’s head slams back as he renters.
“I don’t see it fit to have a hypothesis, in this case. If I were to make an educated guess it would very likely be true. Not to be chuffed, but that’s usually the case. This experiment is just for my own up close examination. No more, no less. I’m not trying to cure you or pleasure you but if you do show signs of something troubling I will not hesitate to bring it up.”  John is frozen to his seat. Of course he expected most of what Sherlock said but his rashness was startling.
Sherlock considered the hallucinogenic drug for himself but couldn’t help but be drawn to the heightened impulsivity. Heightened impulses could affect him in numerous ways, like using his adrenaline to solve cases faster than he already can. But every experiment needs to be tested. He couldn’t possibly use John because he was sick.
“You’re going to keep going?” John asks in all seriousness, drowning out all unrelated thoughts. Sherlock’s mind falls into complete disorder, his mouth not knowing how to reply. He couldn’t think with the other so close to him. Does his tone insinuate that he doesn’t, in fact, want to? John sees the wheels turn behind his eyes. He admires the other greedily before it’s obvious he has to speak up.
Their flat is greeted with their smiling faces, the London sky having poured on them minutes before they made it inside.
“And it seems you have been quite busy lately.” John doesn’t comment, instead asking a question of his own.
The bed rocks at their force. Mewls threaten to spill from John’s lips so he clamps a hand over his own mouth. Another thrust against him comes in, his eyes rolling closed. His hand holding back his sounds is gripped and pulled to the side. Subdued moans are let out, John trying to bury his face against the bed. The only thing that gets John to open his eyes is a low moan coming from the other.
“Want you...everywhere.” The detective takes four of John’s fingers in his mouth. He groans in response, abruptly snapping his hips into Sherlock. The detective's moan was barely muffled. He swirls his tongue around and between the digits. John’s hips tilt back, fucking in. Sherlock’s teeth bite into the other’s fingers, tongue returning in apology. As punishment John begins thrusting into him properly.
“Trust me, I want more but I know when I need to stop.” He closes his eyes, enjoying the quiet hum of alcohol in his system. John sips at the bottle only for those sips to turn into chugs. Sherlock listened with his eyes closed, gauging how much he had drunk from sound alone. As the liquid came to a dwindling end, the detective’s eyes opened into small slits. John takes a deep breath, his need for oxygen completely forgotten.
“Honestly, I have been quite miffed lately and just wanted to come home and relax, you know? This is my home too.” John rakes a hand through his hair, nerves igniting at finally speaking his truth.
“Why not? Seems simple enough. I reckon two days at most to learn the basics?” Sherlock’s statement is mumbled more so to himself than the other man. John plops down next to his friend on the bed and snatches the laptop away.
“I put drugs in your drink.” John’s eyes were dark as he looked up at his flatmate. The sight was much more than what the brunette could handle, his confession truly was just to buy time for him to calm down.
As night approaches, John washes off a day’s work and makes his way to the telly. It’s just the best part of the night, watching colors flash on the screen with a dosing head. With his mind half asleep he hears Sherlock’s unhurried footsteps head towards the kitchen.
Deciding not to question it, the doctor ignores the other until he feels a cold finger trace his thumb, making most of his fingers twitch. Holding John’s hand in both of his own, Sherlock adds pressure upwards, the added water making the slide easier. John hums,
“Now answer my question.” He was so shocked. He wasn’t only shocked but a completely different feeling kept swallowing up every negative his brain tried to conjure up. Sherlock swallowed looking dead at his eyes. As if reading John’s mind, a small smile grew on his mouth. He tried to conceal it by licking his lips.
“Sherlock?” He is never one to be left speechless. But it seems like all the words he wants to use intend to fail him. So, he speaks with his actions.
“Drink this.” The detective states simply, holding out a glass of champagne. John’s face showed evident confusion.
“One of us really has to learn to cook.” John sighs dreamily as he shovels an eating iron full of food in his mouth.
God, it was just the most peculiar thing. Sherlock’s eyes rake along the moving hands in front of him.
“We can stop at any moment.” John nods in understanding, his eyes finding it difficult to look at the other without cumming. Sherlock’s deep moans make him impossibly harder.
Mary smiled, her face lightening. “Well, John fancied Isabelle, but I think I’ve got him talked round to Lily. So possibly Lily Isabelle, or maybe Lily Catherine after John’s mum…Lily Catherine Watson sounds a bit better, don’t you think?”
“Well done, that’s fantastic,” John said taking a drink and wiping his mouth. “So you’re on staff at the retreat centre? That’s how you know Sherlock?”
“No. See, Sherlock, I know you know crime, but I know about crimes of the heart.” It was perhaps a measure of Sherlock’s inebriation that this seemed to make complete sense. “If you let John keep using you like that, he’s not going to stop. You have to respect yourself before anyone else will.”
“Yes. That was the first and only time. My previous encounters were not exactly characterized by a desire for intimacy. After—well, after there was no one. Not until a few months ago. Until you I haven’t let anyone touch me except from behind. For anything.”
Still: Sherlock had been up for days and he’d already nodded off several times, catching himself just as he started to slump down the wall, when the sound of Molly’s footsteps came close enough to rouse him. The footsteps stopped.
John’s throat was dry despite the tea. “I need to apologize,” he said. He’d decided to lead with this mostly because it was true, but also because it seemed the most likely to meet with a favorable response. “I’ve no right to tell you what to do. I shouldn’t have tried to go all Mycroft on you like that. I’m sorry.”
“Just a minute,” Mary said. She relayed all this to John, who shook his head. She glared at him, but he just glared back, looking stubborn.
John was so outraged he could barely speak. “You were in my flat! All the times I thought something felt off or the window was open—“
John showered, dressed, packed up and went down the corridor to Sherlock’s room, but got no answer to his repeated knocking. Huh. John considered the closed door, thinking. Sherlock rarely ran off, unless he was distracted by a case; if he and John were in a row it was usually John who left. If he wanted to think about something, Sherlock just tuned John out. It didn’t surprise John much that Sherlock might have wanted to go off and have a little bit of a panic attack—he’d rather expected as much—but usually he didn’t
would help the time to pass; if he were clever enough to get something to write with he might be able to remove the blank pages as well. He added his name to the list as well:
Lestrade had, in fact, been calling about the banker, but Sherlock gave him detailed instructions so he could solve it himself. He’d prefer the police take credit for this one, and besides, for once in his life he wasn’t sure he wanted a case—he didn’t know if was ready to venture out of their little cocoon just yet.  “It’s that or the wife, but you’ll have looked into her.”
John was right, of course. The members of the Borealis Quartet turned out to be completely ordinary in person, not alarming at all: spectacles, ratty jumpers, hair pulled back any old way. The cellist, who had been the one to contact him, was a serious ancient music scholar who knew quite a lot about Lassus. They had a very enjoyable discussion. Finally the first violin cleared her throat and said a little shyly, “Shall we begin then? I’ve a score here if you’d like to make notes.”
They kissed and kissed. Sherlock would have been content to stay there forever, his mind astonishingly, blissfully empty of everything but the sensation of John’s arms around him and John’s mouth on his. He never wanted to do anything else.
John followed the mother? father? falcon with the binoculars as it took flight again, soaring in a graceful arc above the rocky hillside. Something about it reminded him of Sherlock, with his long graceful neck and proud carriage. He thought of Sherlock high in his tower. John’s miracle, remote and safe as the nestlings in their scrape.
Sherlock opened hi s mouth in outrage, caught the Queen’s eye, and shut it for a minute to consider. When he spoke, his voice was calm and almost gentle. “Actually Mycroft, do you know, it’s really not. I’ve got a serial killer who murders women and unborn children and destroys the lives of their families. You’ve got an assassin who
“You said you’d phone me, you said you loved me, you said you’d do anything for me, you said all this was for me, so we could start a new life together. So here I am.”
“No, it’s not your fault. I think it was over by the time you got there.” Owen had said Sherlock had his head down when he came out; he probably hadn’t noticed anything from across the street.
Hmmm. What kind of stressful work had Lady Smallwood done before she’d been exiled to the domestic sphere? She’d clearly been in a position of some authority. Sherlock watched her covertly, but if there were marks of her former profession to be found, she’d left it too long ago for him to find them. There was something about her almost deliberate blandness that made him think of high-stakes negotiators; a solicitor? A businesswoman? Something in which she was well-versed in giving nothing away. Lady Smallwood was now lifting various embroidered objects up for display: a christening gown, some sort of table runner…would anyone notice if he fell asleep?
When the concerto finished Sherlock released an enormous breath—was that that same one he had taken at the beginning? had he been holding his breath the entire time? he felt as though he had—and heard a great wave of applause. He suddenly realized he had no idea what to do next. Did he walk off, or go and sit down in his seat with the second violins? He blinked dizzily. Emily was making a gesture with her hand that looked like
“Polio when I was a child,” Mr. Brooke explained, following John’s gaze. “It’s why I don’t dance. Or ride,” he added, tipping his head at John.
. John could not forgive this, Sherlock knew it. He bit down harder, tasting fresh blood. He was broken and hurting and half blind and half deaf and John was going to leave him, and he would not cry.
“I had some of that plastic tarpaulin put up over the windows directly the fire was out, so there wouldn’t be any more damage if it rained,” Mrs. Hudson was saying as she set a plate in front of Sherlock. He was feeling better already just from the smell. “The electricity and water are turned off to the upstairs—there was a tap broken off in the kitchen, water spraying everywhere, and the glass! You won’t be cooking in there for a while.”
“Opioid withdrawal is nasty but not life-threatening,” another doctor explained. “Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, can cause serious problems if discontinued abruptly at high doses, and that’s what we’ve been dealing with here: seizures, psychosis, hallucinations.”
“It’s driving me mad,” Sherlock said through his teeth but he subsided, twisting his fingers in John’s. John could feel him surreptitiously rubbing his arm against the bed and pulled his hands up higher, so they were out of the blankets and out in the cool air. Sherlock settled a little and pressed his forehead against the top of John’s head. John smiled and, without really thinking about what he was doing, kissed Sherlock’s knuckles. Sherlock stilled and went quiet again, for so long this time that John wondered if he had drifted off into his own head, or fallen asleep. John was finally beginning to relax into sleepiness himself when Sherlock said softly, “I don’t believe it’s a sin.”
“I was…distressed…to see the extent of your injuries firsthand the other night,” Mycroft said carefully. “You are recovering, I trust?”
“Oh! It’s fine, Sherlock, really. I was rather badly dazed for the first day or so and thought I was back at the Hall, after those men attacked us, remember? And then I asked Mike to tell you I was all right, but…”
The choice was no choice at all, not really, but of course what really mattered was that if he chose the gilded cage there was no way that someone as clever as Sherlock Holmes would not have the means of suicide to hand within a day. The Empire would never have his children or his body.
John played around with Sherlock’s arse a bit as he stroked him to full hardness, paying close attention to make certain he still seemed to enjoy it. Which he definitely did: when John rubbed the tight curl of muscle he actually shivered, dropping his back and pushing back subtly into John’s finger. This seemed as good as an invitation to John. He started doing the thumb-over-the-slit thing with his other hand he knew would get Sherlock distracted and reached out blindly for the drawer, fumbling out a packet of lube and managing to open it with his teeth. He set the packet back on the table and pressed it with the heel of his hand, then scooped up a generous dollop of lube with two fingers. He held his hand up a few seconds to let the chill fade and then pressed his fingers back over Sherlock’s arse. A quick rub to loosen the muscle and then…in.
Dr. Woodcourt was pleased too. “A good night’s sleep would help most now, I think,” he said. “I will have you sent a mild draught. It can be difficult to sleep when one has been abed all day, and your rest has likely been very broken, has it not?”
Sherlock had picked up the cough almost immediately, a wet hacking thing that kept them up nights. They were sleeping together again--they would have been half on top of each other in any case, and their first night in prison Sherlock had nudged his way back under John’s arm as though they were still twelve and fourteen--and at night John could hear the wheezing where he pressed against Sherlock’s back. Angelo had even given them one of his rolled-up blanket pillows.
Sherlock took Circe and began unfastening her bridle. “Remember I told you about Daniel stealing the chickens and how I identified him by the mud from his shoes? Well, I started thinking after that, and I decided that if I could identify from the soil on a person’s shoes where he’d been, it could be an invaluable tool in solving crimes. So I saved until I could buy a microscope, and now I’m collecting specimens of anything I can think of that might be found on the sole of a shoe. There are quite a lot.”
John held his eyes a minute longer, then looked away. He picked up his drink and drained it. With the deliberate care of the intoxicated, he placed the glass precisely in the center of the small table and then stood, pulling his jacket together to button it.
“So you don’t have control over determining the amount of food you have to eat,” Simon said, “but you can control how you eat it.”
The next time Sherlock woke in darkness, with a shock of unease: something was off. He frowned, straining his eyes until he made out the shape of the chair by the window. It was empty. That was wrong; someone should have been with him at all times until he was fully recovered. Perhaps the maid had just stepped out to the toilet? Sherlock glanced at the door just in time to see a looming figure turn away from it, tucking the keys into his pocket. Nicholls.
“Are you sure?” John asked dubiously. “We’ve gone back and forth once already and you’ve still to walk back to the ward.”
Sure enough, a few days later Irene was sent back to the women’s ward--since she no longer seemed in any danger of seducing anyone in a feverish delirium--and Sherlock was declared well enough to return to school. John could not help feeling guilty as Dr. Woodcourt reassured him that his cousin would be just fine. He clearly thought John was simply overprotective, and John was grateful not to be scolded for keeping Sherlock so long at a time when the hospital was desperately overcrowded.
Sherlock kept his face blank, not wanting to reveal he had understood. He knew Russian was still widely spoken in Uzbekistan, although never at Mirzayev’s compound; probably some complicated backstory he didn’t know, but Mirzayev hated the Russians. Pretty women excepted, of course.
taste?” He struck out again, catching Sherlock hard in the jaw so that the coppery taste of blood exploded across his tongue.
“Can I touch you,” John said, sounding strangled, and Sherlock gasped “God yes, please, now,” unable to thrust satisfactorily against John without dislodging his fingers. John’s slick hand took hold of him and he began to stroke in a rhythm with his thrusting fingers, his own breathing going harsh and ragged as Sherlock clung to him, body stiffening, the rush of pleasure building until John growled into his neck, “God you feel amazing, I can feel you getting tight, I can’t wait to be inside you,” and then he was coming, blindingly hard, banging his broken nose against John’s head and crying out again and again from the ecstasy and the pain.
“No sir. The prisoners are nude. They appear traumatized and are slow to respond to requests for identification. We are hoping to expedite the process.”
They passed the rest of the meal in a peaceful silence, Sherlock reading the papers and John scratching desultorily at the crossword puzzle. Afterwards John did the washing up while Sherlock wandered off to shower, and then they settled down to their respective laptops.
The cab deposited them outside a bustling café near the BBC, and Sherlock craned his neck to see inside. He whipped out his phone. “Good morning, Lestrade. I’m about to talk to Simon Fuller.” An outraged squawk came from the phone. “I
“I’m sorry,” John said. He sat down on the stairs next to Sherlock and put his head in his hands, not wanting him to see the relief and shame in his face. “I’m so sorry. That damned Flea said things, and I just thought he was too stupid to lie. I never should have believed him. Please forgive me. I am so, so sorry.”
“You had the address,” Sherlock said flatly. “She called Daniel from your flat, didn’t she? She lived at home. She wouldn’t have called where her family could overhear. She wrote down the address. You still had it. You didn’t text first, because you never had his number, did you. When you arrived at his flat, he had no idea who you were.”
“I’ll forge it for you,” John interceded, swinging the camera around toward his face in a vertigo-inducing swoop. “I’ve gotten pretty good at your signature over the years.”
“It’s only because I’m a girl,” Janine said quickly. “If I’m standing out by myself late at night, people will stop to ask if I’m okay or say something stupid like, ‘Why don’t you come with me instead love, I’ll show you a better time’. No one’s going to bother with a man like you, because obviously you can take care of yourself; you’re bloody scary.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. He looked out as the plane banked, turning smoothly over Los Angeles. “You should bear in mind…we might learn things that were kept from you, in the past. Things you might not want to know.”
“I was an MP. My husband worked for Amnesty International. We thought about running, but this is our bloody country. My family’s been in Lincolnshire a thousand years, probably. If everyone who could, left, who’s going to speak for those who can’t? That’s what we thought, anyway.”
Molly searched the desk and found nothing but a pen and a few paperclips, which she handed over in case Sherlock found any more locks to pick; Sherlock, who had rather more experience of office furniture with something to hide, swiftly found the secret compartment in the back of the file drawer and the locked cash box inside. He used one of the paperclips and made quick work of the lock. Inside was a handful of silver.
“John was my partner, not my assistant. And he’s returned to his former profession. At any rate she’s short-term; I just have her going to the shops and running errands whilst I’m on house arrest.”
All through the rest of Mrs. Hudson’s tour he’d been distracted, thinking of that cool, assessing grey gaze. By the time they reached the second floor he could actually feel his heartbeat pick up.
“Rival faction,” Sherlock said. He dropped to a crouch and rummaged through the dead men’s clothing. “Hoping to advance by eliminating Anton and retrieving Lyudmila. No great loss. Sergei and Lyudmila will meet us at Baker Street tomorrow, along with Lord St. Simon, and once the histrionics are out of the way we’ll craft a version for the press that makes everyone involved look good: Lord St. Simon standing up to the Russian Mob, star crossed lovers and so on. There’s no salvaging Anton, he’ll have to be the villain, but he should be out of the country by then.” He stood holding two wallets, which he tucked into his jacket. “Might as well buy him a little extra time,” he said.
,” Sherlock hissed and John covered his mouth with his own. The first kisses were gentle and chaste, like the ones John had given Sherlock before, just a soft meeting of lips. But then Sherlock exhaled hard--John had not realized he was holding his breath--inhaled on an almost-whimper, and opened his mouth. John gripped his head, crushing their mouths together as his tongue found Sherlock’s. God, he had never known kissing could feel like this. All that fumbling under the mistletoe and at the pub, all those
“How rough do you need?” John asked, winding one of the scarves around Sherlock’s eyes to make a blindfold.
Mr. Brocklehurst had reached Sherlock and grabbed his arm, yanking him hard enough to make him stumble off balance. John, who had been frozen in fascinated horror like the rest of the room, jerked. He felt Pip shove him down with his body and fought silently to see.
The ground sloped away steeply, so no one but Bruce could see in the high window. “All full of crates, just as it was before,” he reported in a low voice, peering in. “But there’s a bit of a lane to the window. We left it that way for the light.”
“Well, that’s not what we want. I’ll prescribe a different draught—just honey, and a bit of something for the pain in your chest. But it won’t make you confused as the other did.” Dr. Woodcourt smiled kindly, and Sherlock actually smiled back—the first real smile John had seen on him since coming to the hospital. John, however, was still not completely reassured.
The uneasy feeling lingered, although he pushed it to the back of his mind until several hours later when he found himself kicked out.
“I cut his throat,” Sherlock said softly. “I didn’t want to, John. I cut his Achilles tendon to bring him down and then I thought I could get the gun but he was too strong, and he kept firing…”
Sebastian growled into his mouth. Sherlock’s struggle seemed to have made him fully hard and he pressed back into Sherlock, forcing Sherlock to turn his head to gasp for air. Sebastian let go of one arm and gripped Sherlock’s jaw, turning his head back to crush his mouth against his own. Sherlock tasted blood.
Right on cue, the waiter appeared with the truffled fonduta, accompanied by the sommelier bearing a bottle of champagne. “Ah, excellent,” Mycroft said, accepting his flute and raising it to John’s. “About time we had something to celebrate, don’t you think?”
Sherlock pushed him onto his back, determined and competitive. “All right. Tell me how to do it and let’s see how long
John glanced over at him and walked on in silence for a moment before he said, “Sherlock, that kid adores you. No one’s ever going to take your place with her; you saved her, and she’ll never forget that.”
“So I came back to London and got on as patroness to the Order of Ancillae. We organized a Christmas fete out at Sarah House, punch and cookies for the poor things, you can imagine. I brought a flask and tipped it in the Mother Superior’s punch. Oh come on, I said, two old dried-up omegas having a bit of a tipple, who’s going to care? Just a jot. I had some as well. And after a bit I brought up my old family friend Sherlock Holmes. It took her a moment, but then she remembered. ‘Brother Bathsheba! Quite the troublemaker when he was here, but he seems to have settled down nicely in London, haven’t heard a word against him.’ That was all I needed. I waited until the signups for the winter term classes went up, and then I had your name and your commander’s. Easiest thing in the world to go to the education committee meeting and convince Miranda that the reading class was too crowded and that it was her idea to start another class, and that she managed to wheedle me into taking it.”
