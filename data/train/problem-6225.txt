Me: Dammit. That’s the Avenger emergency line. Please tell me it’s not blue aliens come to enslave us via weird bracelets.
May: I mentioned Laura’s trying to bring someone else to help us plan and help with Simmons. And possibly for Thor. This is why we probably should wait until we have her to go to Norway.
HSBF: I thought you didn’t take a Quinjet because you needed this to look like work travel. Didn’t you also do a meeting before heading back to the states?
Director Snookums: I know that Friday was in our files, helping you and your assistant track down the guy who killed her cousin. I’m pretty sure the forensic team is going to identify him as the dead body. All I really want to know at this point is if Quake was there?
Anthony: I thought this was actually therapy art. There is a lot of snow and trains in here. Yet, nothing of you punching out Red Skull. I’m a little surprised.
Tony Potts: Yes. This will piss off Pepper because I don't think she wants to take care of both kids for an extended period by herself. Although the big sister is supposed to arrive Friday night, which will help.
Thank you for paying for the movers and the hotel offer. I’m going to have to decline the latter, because I don’t want to rip [Redacted] from home any sooner than I have to. This is going to be such a big transition for him.
“I think it’s better that I tell him directly then let him wonder. You didn’t make the best first impression. I need to do a little damage control.”
“You’re right, she was one of the victims of the decimation along with Leo Fitz. Tony might be one of the few that understands what’s going on, especially because Deke is missing.” Steve explained as he sighed again.
Anthony love: I’m not even sure where to start with what’s going on. Maybe I should let you know that our daughter is fine after experiencing some weird overload thing due to alternate dimension interference.
Melinda: I know. There were some really bad days back then. I don’t think I realized I loved him until New York.
“I just want you to be comfortable,” Steve responded instead. He’s pretty sure he was blushing, but hopefully, Tony couldn’t see in the bedroom’s low light.
Tony Potts: If operation keep away does work, then it would be better for the kids to be in Malta or at least away from anywhere with the stones.
This was the final chapter of the last group I had prewritten. The next two chapters are with my beta and the six after that are in various stages of rough drafting. I hope that I will be able to put up the next chapter no later than next Monday, but it could be a little bit longer. But let us just celebrate the fact that those two idiots have finally got it together.
Anthony: Therapy is going well. I’ve been approved to put Avengers 3.0 together as long as I follow their 300 draconian regulations.
Avengers Friday: The number you are trying to contact is no longer a member of the Avengers communication group. I can contact Mr. Stark directly if necessary if this is an emergency. Otherwise, I am not authorized to do so.
“You’re right. It would be a disaster regardless, due to the sticks, fire, and marshmallows being involved. However, one of those children can turn himself invisible.”
May: I heard your Simmons is pregnant. If we do manage to create a doorway between timelines, I think we should bring her here. It’s not safe for her to be there. I should have Friday send to you what happened to women who had snap-induced miscarriages. It was ugly.
“Again, even though text messages are a better way for us to communicate because it gives us time to think through what we say and the princess genius has upgraded my encryption by like 9000% there are somethings I just can’t text message to you, Sugar Lips.” He gave Steve a quick kiss to the lips.
Me: That may be connected to the Watchdogs which is why Agent America was called in. Which is fine because the BFF already said no.
“And that you’re able to look at the situation from the perspective of a father." Okay, maybe Steve knows him better than Tony initially thought. Because that was exactly what he was thinking.
Me: I would say I was busy doing my hair, but you wouldn’t believe me. At least that’s what I told Ross.
I heard you did well during the blackout/terrorist attack. I’m proud of the work you did. Maybe it’s good that you’re being a local spider person right now. You can make a difference. How are things working with you and the bulletproof pacifist? I’ve heard you guys make a really good team.
Tony: The board members are assholes and I had to still take a few of the Paris meetings which I was informed of when I got on the plane because my assistant is devious when she’s not feeding me chocolate. I was so planning to sleep until we got to California. But now I have to be on in 30 minutes. I really want to take a nap.
No prison riot yet but I did see that Senator Nadeer l and a couple of staffers have been charged with treason, in addition to the kidnapping and torture of her brother. I’m pretty sure I know which Senator was working with the Watchdogs to orchestrate last Tuesday’s attacks. Those treason charges are a dead giveaway.
Nomad: Did Red show you cell phone video of yesterday’s mission? I was able to get to Clint before things went really badly.
The anniversary of Uncle Ben’s murder probably should’ve been in October, but it wasn’t until I watched Spider-Verse that I realized the need to include this plot point and I need Tony to be there for his spider child.
Me: Well, I could put down inventing robotics that go bad and making lots of weapons that killed lots of people. That isn’t a positive accomplishment though.
Me: Rhodey said something about his agency using the same classification system that all the other agencies use because he is not dealing with learning an entirely new classification system. Although he is thinking about doing random polygraphs like normal agencies do drug testing..
Me: Although not enough brownie points to keep a leader that doesn’t want to enforce the registration provision of the Accords.
Red phone: I like my assistant and did not want to be responsible for him getting a divorce due to not being able to handle a long-distance relationship. So Pepper now has a husband and wife team to cater to her every need and I have Laura and Friday. I don't want to talk about it.
Anthony: Yes. She thinks that he’s inhuman, but he’s not. Although we are never going to tell the senator that.
Tony: Yes, because Thor only knows where he is right now. I hate being abandoned. Also Monkey Lover has an engineering doctorate. Bruce had seven PhDs and not one of them in engineering. Such a waste.
Tony: It was only a shoe. I think I’ve mentioned this before but never piss off an Italian Mom or put her baby in danger. That woman has a mean left hook. We agreed to mutually not press charges against each other.
Anthony: Also someone will need to tell you when it’s time for us to actively participate. We have flowers to toss.
HSBF: So I just saw my “ex-boyfriend” dragged out of his house in handcuffs by the FBI on six different news channels. The words collusion, Stark Industries, and attempted murder were also on screen. Is there something you need to tell me?
Me: This is probably revenge for nominating him for this job. He only took the job because he loves his country, but is afraid of the government.
Me: Bless my tailor and I’m just going to walk because you look absolutely edible in that. Blue is your color. I don’t even think alterations will be necessary. Your ass looks extra delicious. It pops.
But it’s fine. Thanks to the Melinda May school of how to be a bad ass, Tony can hold his own against barely trained bigoted assholes who hide behind their guns. Especially when he knows how to use those guns against them. As many guns as he’s designed, really, they should know that he would know the best way to disarm someone and use the gun against his attacker. That was two more on the ground and at least he had a weapon now.
Me: Welcome to parenthood. It’s like a constant state of panic and none of my kids have superpowers.
Continuity note for non-AOS viewers: Shortly before Tony was kidnapped in Afghanistan, Agents May and Coulson were on a mission in Bahrain that went south quickly and resulted in the death of a young inhuman girl. This is her biggest regret. (See AOS episode 2.17 for details.) Agent May develop severe PTSD, which resulted in her leaving her husband and fieldwork. But she came back eventually. So obviously children with powers like Peter, Kamala, and Miles are going to concern her or more accurately, young children not being able to control their powers concerns her. (Yes, Miles Morales is our five-year-old who has developed spider powers.)
The Shield phone of Leopold F. James a.k.a. Leopold J. Fitz a.k.a. Monkey Lover 2 a.k.a. Fitz of the future
“She’s totally a work colleague that you just occasionally have sex with. I can’t say anything because that was essentially the first 3 years post-divorce with Bobby until Dr. Leopold showed up in our time stream. Although maybe you moved on to Mr. Flaming Head or maybe there's a threesome going on." That was when Daisy sent a slight vibration to Hunter's bum.
Me: So Spidey Dad really was under cover because Patches wanted to him to keep an eye on the Watchdogs. Patches may have been a little mad at Agent for making a deal with the government to deal with the Hive fiasco. So Patches didn’t, you know, talk to him first and went to other operatives.
“Anyway, I met my first friend at MIT, who I love to pieces. I am forever grateful that he survived the snap. My parents died when I was 21, and I didn’t handle it well. This is how Tiberius talked me into doing a sex tape that he was conveniently not in but sure made a lot of money for his company. Then shortly after that, I also lost Jarvis. Things didn't get better.”
Me: Yes. Just finding out about it led to an extra two sessions last week, so I’m surprised mental health rehab wasn’t in the cards earlier.
Me: I would’ve told you about your parents. At least that I knew Hydra was involved. I didn’t know it was Bucky for sure until the video. Also, I would’ve punched the screen out before you saw it.
Anthony: I don't want to lead Ross or anyone else to you. One popular theory is that Ross paid someone to poison me to get you to come out of hiding. I won’t put you at risk.
The new consultant: Actually, don’t answer that question at all. I just hope my cousin is safe wherever she is.
Tony: So you’re not going to run for office? You have the blonde hair and blue eyes for it. You would definitely have a shot as a third party candidate because you, baby, are 100% independent.
Anthony love: I’m sure evil Ross’s new “think tank” is probably funded by Watchdog sympathizers doing lots of crazy shit. I can’t wait until he’s arrested for fraud.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed this micro story. Your response to this story was overwhelming. I’m glad you enjoyed it so much. My goal is to update every few days on this story, most likely every Tuesday when I can pull it off.
“Which was another reason why I should have got sober earlier. Your crush should never hear about all those times you got arrested for public intoxication/public indecency in various countries.”
So for this exercise, I’m supposed to write out how I feel about you murdering my parents. My Howard feelings are messy. I still feel guilty that I almost felt relieved that I wouldn’t have to keep living under his harsh gaze. I found evidence in the intervening years that my father did love me. He was just absolutely awful at showing that to me. Maybe if he lived a little bit longer, we would’ve had a better relationship, but you took that from me and I hate you for that.
Me: Love makes you make questionable decisions sometimes. Get me back there and in a position where Ross can’t use my kids or my wife against me.
Venom: Sorry, I kissed your not-a-boyfriend in front of you. I still don’t get why you gave me chocolate after that humiliation.
Melinda: Apparently, Friday took over a conversation with somebody Laura’s address book refers to as Boss Tony.
“Relocating to our own room because I don’t think Sam would be happy if we have sex on his bed or couch.” Steve told him.
“That have sex and I’m not that opposed to the concept of marriage. Someday eventually. But not like anytime soon.”
“I’m glad you trust Tony with your kids, but that doesn’t tell me about your relationship with him. You’re not really friends anymore, are you?” Laura asked.
Me: A little. He’s not happy about Yo-Yo relocating to LA but that’s mostly because everybody feels like I need a babysitter.
Anthony: Or you feared. BTW, I know you asked Friday to keep an eye on me, but there’s no point. I have not dived headfirst into the nearest bottle of Jack, Jim, or José. Nor have I gone to the nearest bar or club to pick up a Jack, Jim, or José for a post breakup rebound fuck.
Me: Don’t worry. I’ll tell Ross to fuck off for you, especially because you have trouble with cursing.
“I don’t even think they’re that upset about the Spidey situation since they’d rather spend time talking about who I’m dating then the pilots that were killed in the incident. Assholes. Where the Fuck do they get off…”Steve quickly silenced Tony with a kiss. The man needed it.
Me: She says I’m addicted to you. And she may be right. If we went any farther then Thursday, I would have started having serious withdrawal symptoms. I think Cocaine is less addictive than talking to you.
Nomad: Oh God! Really? Please tell me you took those down this morning before Pepper came to lunch. Also, what about the kids? They keep barging in on your floor and our dates.
Purple Arrow: I know that you were originally planning to sell all of your property in the tower. Linda told me during our meet up, because you told her that during your breakdown at the farm. Yet you kept the apartments at the tower just so the kids wouldn’t have to move again or be farther away from their new friends, especially Ms. Marvelous.
Nomad: Yes. I decided it would be good to lay low for a couple of days. Although, contrary to what you think, I did not almost died yesterday.
Red phone: Geniuses. It was a smart kid school not a rich kid school. I was one of the few people there not on scholarship. But before then, Jarvis, was like the only one who really had my back. Ana too before she died right before the boarding school relocation happened.
Red phone: I’m sending you pictures of their artwork. They have some new costume ideas for you since you’re now a man without a country.
Hunter has never said no to a little harmless fun, but whatever is going on between would be more than that. There is also him finally letting go of Bobbi for good and Leo doing the same with his Simmons. And let us not forget about dealing with the after effects of sexual assault by LMD. He’s still furious at his future self for the love floppy joke.
Jemma: However, my other timeline counterpart is pregnant with a little Fitzsimmons. Their first anniversary was this weekend.
“That’s sweet. Don’t worry, they are talking.” Natasha said as she walked into the room and shut the door behind her.
But six hours later, when Tony grabbed his hand in front of several dozen cameras, everything fell away.
Me: It still ended because we couldn’t trust each other. I thought it got better, but apparently it didn’t.
May: Because I need you and Stark at the compound for the mission tonight.  But I still want our kids safe.
Me: And we keep going forward. Right now, you just have to try to convince Benjamin’s aunt that you have her nephew’s best interest at heart. I know you adore Benjamin.
Me: We all do things we don't want to keep those we love safe. I'm taking care of something. When it's done I'll be back.
Tosha: Stark is here. We are having an all-hands meeting in the lounge in 15 minutes. He brought Steve’s shield and Hunter’s cookies. Hunter does the best chocolate chip cookies. Steve always brings some around after playdates.
Melinda: You refer to Tony in your address book as Morgan’s father. Your relationship is not fine. Nothing about your relationship with Tony is fine and you don’t want to do anything to change that. I think he’s moved past Siberia. Have you?
“Because I was an asshole. I thought we covered this? I’m willing to acknowledge that mistakes were made on all of our parts.” Tony made so many mistakes, several related to not getting sober fast enough.
“Is this your way of telling me that Hunter isn’t coming back? Because May already told me that earlier. Although she didn’t explain why.” And she would really like to know why.
Original A/N April 2020: Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are so Absolutely Fabulous.
Tony: I’ve yawned twice in the last 10 minutes, so as much as I love talking to you, Honey Bear, I just kind of want to crawl in my bed at the compound and sleep for a week. I mean, I love you and want to know more about your good qualities. But my pillow looks really good right now.
BFF Ned: Are you still hanging out with the princess? Or are you on some secret mission? Should I be sending these text messages to the other number?
As a reminder, they do not use the real names of any of the kids in the good timeline. The Bartons have a code system in place. Lila is well aware of the system and uses it as she is supposed to.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all absolutely wonderful. Tony and Steve are now together in Mumbai. Let the making out and serious conversations began.
Tony: But normal for these types of meetings. If you’re restless you could try writing that letter to your BFF. I also wouldn’t be opposed to more NC-17 artwork of our exploits together. It’s safer than a sex tape.
HSBF: I can ask but she usually calls me. I wish she would give me an update on James’s progress but even she doesn’t trust her encryption.
“Just because you moved on doesn’t mean the rest of us have. We need Fitz, and I had to take this chance to bring him back.”
StarkAE: We did talk about that and have acknowledged that we both made bad choices. Maybe we need to talk more about it now, but keeping us from having sex is not going to make that conversation happen any sooner. Actually, the sex may help take the edge off of those conversations. It is my favorite coping mechanism.
I love him for longer than I’ve realized. He’s smart and kind. He’s also mentoring around a dozen kids. He’s very into philanthropy and trying to protect the enhanced population, especially the kids. He tries to look at the situation from multiple perspectives.
Red phone: I don’t know why she gets to dictate that rule when she is the one who decided it was over because she couldn’t deal with me anymore.
“Yes, but we don't understand why the reports about what happened in Asgard are from someone named the Valkyrie and Bruce Banner of all people. What was he doing in Asgard? I don’t know because I’m not even allowed to look at the reports. Why isn’t there anything from Thor?” MJ asked. He knew MJ was most concerned with what happened in Asgard because her cousin was now involved.
Anthony: I took the jet. I’ve been here for a few hours. I even had a few of the meetings already. Although, I did bring a suit or two because, well, I almost got killed by sunflower seeds last month. The ‘bodyguards’ are also with me, armed with EpiPen’s and Icer’s.
But just to clarify, the italicized text was Tony sneakily typing on Laura’s Avenger report share document.
“It was so hard seeing her like that. Every time I came to visit her, it was… Peggy has been gone seven years, and it’s still hard to talk about. She was so strong, and then…" Steve couldn’t finish.
Anthony: I could tell. See, this is so much easier to use than that arcane flip phone and 2000% less likely to get picked up by the ATCU. Although, since they are mostly getting pornographic text messages from me, I think they are starting to back off.
Lily bear 2018: Yes, especially now that I can talk to you. This made me remember what happened with Ross. It was days before Uncle Phil and Aunt Melinda got you back. I’m scared this will be like that again.
Me: OK, I’m always busy, but I make time for you. I was worried that you couldn’t text. I know that Agent America told you to go dark. After you tipped her off to where Purple Arrow was.
Red phone: I probably need to change that. Do you think Laura would be a good custodian of the armor?
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all absolutely wonderful. Several of you guessed correctly that Clint is the package. You’ll get to hear more about the complicated history between Coulson and “the package” soon.
Venom: Oh, my ex parents apparently didn't give a fuck about me being gone. Liz reported my dusting instead of my parents.
HSBF: Well, none of us have traveled through time yet so, I would say being an Avenger is less stressful.
I have no idea how to start this letter. I can’t even decide if I should actually start with Dear Bucky or cross that out and switch it to Dear James. Are you more one or the other? I’m not sure. I really didn’t have time to get to know who you are now before you decided to go back into cryo-freeze. This is attempt number 35 at writing to you according to my boyfriend’s AI. I’d guess maybe I’ll start there.
“How did the call with Yo-Yo go? They don’t need you to come back to DC, do they?” Steve asked as he stepped out of the bathroom, freshly showered. He frowned when he realized that Tony was texting someone instead of resting like he should’ve been after their earlier activities. Although at least Tony wasn’t packing. He was worried that Shield was calling because the last time they called while Steve was with Tony in person, Tony had had to go back early.
Tony: I’m really trying to actually learn from my mistakes. I think my arrogance has gone down the whole 12% since the murder bot fiasco.
"I heard that you're in therapy." Sam said changing the subject. Maybe, Tony just accidentally set up that subject change for him.
The Mechanic: The joys of technicalities. Although, why did you decide to go that way? I mean after the Germany fiasco, we probably can use some good publicity. But our bad publicity was caused by villain manipulation, infighting, and miscommunication. Which was triggered by the murder bot fiasco, but that’s a Tony problem, not an Avenger problem.
Me: Nothing destroys a relationship faster than being stabbed in the back. I should know, that’s how my last marriage ended.
“I was someone who protects everyone and who keeps her promises, even to the dead.” She takes a small drink of the wine that she’s barely touched. “I knew that Phil was looking forward to helping you get acclimated. The original plan was for me to move out and you to get my old apartment for a few months, as Phil helped you get acclimated. Everyone knew you were drowning in the apartment that Fury put you in a New York. The Loki incident changed that plan and so I decided I would help you the best way I could."
No one did. But the front desk sent one right up because apparently this was a full-service hotel. They didn’t even blink when he asked for needles, bowls, and corks. Once the power was on and even more Watchdogs were turned over to the Mumbai authorities, he resolved to give the hotel the biggest tip ever. Besides, he owed them for Steve breaking the bed Sunday. Super strength plus sex Marathon equals broken bed. That, most hotels will overlook, but bullet holes are another story, so money will need to definitely change hands.
Me: No. Actually, they’re here because somebody has to make sure Happy doesn’t try to punch you. Not that it would hurt you.
Number one May: Don’t get me wrong, I like Flash now that he’s aware of the pulling pigtail syndrome, but he might be in a vulnerable place after what happened.
Anthony: Yes, and instead of posting my tweets, Friday emailed it to Pepper who told me she was flattered that I was defending her, but would prefer if I did it in a way that wouldn’t cause her to spend more time with PR than absolutely necessary. Then she said that she was really proud that I’ve managed to stay sober for 50 days and she’s really hoping that I make it to 60.
Friday: I hate to interrupt this conversation, but you are receiving a call from Teenage Mutant Ninja Spider.
Me: I am happy being here. Snookums is here too which was nice, and he only yelled at me a little. The gift baskets helped immensely. The new director is always easier to deal with after he’s had a good box of truffles.
“Who is the giant purple raisin that Thor is trying to stab?” As Tony asked the question, he realizes that this is more than just a drawing.
“Well, where it was supposed to happen anyway. Bonus, there is an ATCU/shield base/Wakanda outpost underneath in case villains attacked or aliens invaded during the middle of the ceremony. Although, if only ninjas crash, I would be happy. I can’t believe Simmons decided to come back here for their first-anniversary party.” Of course, that may have something to do with just moving to the neighborhood to be closer to mommy Fitz, but he’s not sure he’s told Steve yet about the relocation of his favorite science team to shield’s B site. They’ve been busy talking about wedding stuff and everything else.
“I have better taste than the ones that are currently in my age bracket. Thank you very much. I’m out to the people that matter.” Flash retorted.
“I think I might make it. Look, you call Pepper and I will get you coffee. Although maybe you should call Peter first." Steve says as he gets up from the bed, but not before kissing Tony again.
Tony: And she did so again in person after the fainting. And I forgave her and speaking of forgiveness, the president is willing to pardon you.
Anthony: Although the fact that they are currently debating the demise of my relationship instead of discussing the New Jersey incident may be a good thing since they're not building up the enhanced person panic. I guess the demise of my personal life is good for something.
Me: So how did you find out about the new fearless leader of an organization that does not yet to exist?
Tony: I’m fine, just a shock to the system. Although, I think Rio is probably going to be traveling with me a lot. I got yelled at in Spanish. I have to take better care of my health and my heart.
Anthony: I already grabbed go bag number three. See, I did listen to you. Now I have 22 more minutes to talk to you before I am forced to spend quality time with Agent Carter Jr.
Tony: Yes, it’s that important that I would have woken you up in the middle of the night if I realized it was the middle of the night. I still thought you were only about seven hours ahead.
“Good. Were you able to help them at all?” Steve asked as he grabbed a pair of boxers out of his duffel bag. He found about sleeping nude, but if the hotel got raided by various government officials or super villains while sleeping, he would like to be at least wearing something when they showed up. Of course he was wondering why he was putting shorts on now, because there was a good chance that Tony would take them off as soon as he crawled into bed for round four.
Tony Potts: I feel like there’s a story there that may be in the vein of accidentally posting a picture of your dick on Instagram.
Monkey lover 2: I’m 53% positive that’s what occurred. Of course, gravitonium could also be involved.
Francis: I’m not even surprised by the impending marriage. I guess this really is the darkest timeline. Who’s fighting?
Me: We’re having dinner tomorrow to talk about Benjamin and his extracurriculars. Coulson and Yo-Yo will be there with me. I’m almost happy that Clint did something stupid and now I won’t have to deal with two Mays in the same room.
Red phone: You might be able to trust your own judgment, but I can't trust mine because it's absolute shit.
“The Friday in the not completely fucked up timeline sent you my drunk text messages where the Friday here didn’t. I texted you all the time during those two years you were on the run. I just never sent them. I was afraid. Now I found out that somewhere in the multi-verse, there is a version where the messages were sent, and we did fix things. I think that’s the hardest thing to accept about our other selves.” Tony confessed.
Anthony: You are hotter, especially when you’re wearing a shirt two sizes too small. Although it might be a little while on the movie because Paramount is pissed at me. Disney now has the rights to do a Tony Stark and possibly, eventually, an Avengers movie.
“Good. Give Friday the information, and we will move all their stuff back into the house. See, I helped.”
Tony Potts: Which just a month ago would’ve completely shocked me, but Steve Rogers has never been a Boy Scout. Especially with all the homophobia.
Purple Arrow: Political assassination, not actual assassination. Also, that explains why the POTUS fired the   OIG in our timeline before the snap. Thankfully, he was snapped.
Tony: We are, but he hates sitting through these types of lunches. Also the restaurant is vegan and Happy is not a fan of vegan cuisine.
“Vision had a will. He didn’t want to be resurrected or get turned into a science experiment.” Tony explained. “I think he knew about what happened to Agent. Vision didn't want that to happen to him. This is why we're suing the hell out of Sword for the stunt they pulled in Wakanda. They were essentially grave robbing."  Tony sounded furious.
“Do we have time to stage an intervention?” He knew Laura was serious too. They tried to get Simmons to go with them to an AA meeting yesterday after the disastrous all-hands meeting where she threw up on Laura, but they were unsuccessful. Tony does not want to think about how much alcohol had to be consumed for that to happen. Maybe it was stress and not just alcohol. He was too afraid to ask Friday for her BAL. It had to be at least triple the legal limit.
Good news, none of the equipment was broken. Peter kept the workstation from crashing to the ground because they kind of knocked it loose. The bad news he's currently being yelled at by the Princess.
MayMQ: I really don’t care about those groups. They are probably the same circles that are mad about me having the shield.
Purple Princess: All of that money is in a trust right now since dad is slumming it in the private sector for the good of humanity. But it was unfair because I knew the truth, and I wasn’t actually sure when Flash would tell you. Although I’m just thankful he finally did.
Everything was true, just certain things were omitted and names were changed. No, he doesn’t know. It’s not the right time to tell him. His favorite agent, that he sees as a daughter, is missing. His last girlfriend was sniped by a member of Hydra less than nine months ago, a teammate who stabbed us in the back. This is not the time to tell him.
Friday: I hate to interrupt but Ms. Watson needs to speak with you right away. She apparently just received a request from the office of the King of Wakanda. His staff would like to arrange a meeting between you and various representatives from Wakanda during his state visit next week. Ms. Watson would like to discuss this with you before scheduling.
Tony: Apparently. Although I don’t think the lack of a translation for Hydra is why at least two of the representatives showed no shame at all. I wonder if any of these people are ex-Hydra members that nobody caught.
Red phone: If it wasn't for his afterschool job at SI, he would be climbing the walls outside of the building, literally.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. You are all wonderful. Now for some Tony/Steve time.
Steve: I couldn’t force him to sleep on the couch. I was sleeping in his bed; it was only polite to share.
“大愚弱智” means “that someone acts like he's very smart, but in fact is an idiot.” I would like to thank KayKIMO who helped me with the word and definition.
“Yep. Because he totally didn’t buy that I was dating your look-alike just to get over you. Probably because I never gave him that excuse, but I was planning to. It does not matter because he still had a hissy fit in the form of disregarding May's wonderful plan to get our Avengers toys out of the tower and upstate away from little fingers.”
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last chapter. You’re all absolutely lovely. Again, light Spider-Man: Homecoming stuff in this chapter. Sorry for the longer break this time, but vacation was lovely. I’m moving next Saturday so I won’t promise that we will be back on the normal Saturday schedule just yet. But soon things will be back to normal.
Me: I showed up late for her wedding and then got so drunk that I fell headfirst into the cake without a shirt on or pants.
Nomad: You know the disgruntled employees were not your fault. Also, not everything is about you. I can get a lot of those on my own. Also most are idle.
Friday: After analyzing their messages, I have determined that the secret to their success was open and honest communication. They played icebreaker games like 20 questions and also answered the 36 questions that lead to love. It was a PR project to appease Jane Barnett.
Yes, another shield IM section. Sorry, Tony and Steve are too busy kissing to have a conversation right now. So May and Coulson will just have to do this for them. Besides May and Coulson have their own issues. This conversation only takes place only a little bit after the last conversation.
The new consultant: You know you don’t have to be jealous of Thompson. He isn’t going to take your place as Benji’s friend. You’re still BFF [redacted] in his address book.
I guess you’re my family now along with the counselor. You’re a good part of my family and I know you love me so that’s good.
Me: Which is why Pepper can’t be in this part of my life. We were never going to come to a full understanding about my need to be a hero. She feels like maybe it’s another addiction. That there’s others that could step up. That I don’t need to put myself at risk. That I am just trying to absolve myself of all the bad things I’ve done in the past.
Agent L. Barton: Because he couldn’t handle me becoming an agent, especially after killing someone in the field. Not anything else.
"Well, you are also a scary-ass brunette who takes shit from no one. So I can understand you having a different type." That almost sounded like a joke.
“Yes. Now I have a boyfriend in another country to excuse my overseas trips that are not SI connected. Also, I have a wedding in Mumbai the last week of October as well. The son of a friend from MIT who I actually still speak to occasionally. I could use a +1 and I’m hoping the medical restrictions will be gone by then.”
"I wouldn’t say that’s what I’m thinking. Did you borrow my toothpaste?" Tony asked pulling away. He was extra minty fresh.
Anthony: Who are mad at me because we missed the Sangeet yesterday. Thankfully, you made a good first impression this morning, so we are invited to dinner Monday before they go back to the states.
“Well, I shouldn’t have tried to kill somebody in a roaring rampage of rage, but here we are. I hit you too,” Steve could hear the regret in Tony’s voice.
Nomad: I wouldn’t be that upset if you gave the codename away to someone else. I don’t want to be Captain America again. It’s too hard living up to everything that means.
“We are all still grieving. However, we’ve learned to move forward, but Simmons hasn’t. That’s not an excuse to be so obsessed about Fitz. You're being very selfish. You even risked your own grandson.” Laura mumbles the word grandson under her breath as she continues to look on extremely confused. What the hell is going on here?
Nomad: You made the right choice. He isn’t ready yet. You’re not a hero because you have powers. You are a hero because you keep trying.
If your children need to be excused for national security reasons, please call me yourself. Do not have your AI call me to give an obvious and laughable explanation for their absence. Please let me know at your earliest convenience why my counselor is unavailable for the unforeseen future.
Agent L. Barton: I’ve been talking to Friday about current shield medical/psych personnel from my timeline that might still be here. I think I have a few people we can bring in. At a minimum, we need an actual psychiatrist to help us plan this mission, not just to help with Simmons. I am still working on my degree.
Red phone: I have PhDs in mechanical engineering, mathematics, computer engineering, chemistry, and Computer science. I also have Masters Degrees in business, biology, and history. And for the one that will surprise everyone, I have a Bachelor’s of Art in music.
Counselor Laura: No. In my timeline, you and Steve started really talking to each other. During one of these conversations, you told him the story of what you thought happened to Ana. Steve recognized that it didn't quite make sense because of his personal experience with similar childhood lies.
T Stark: As I’ve discovered with my now boyfriend, things go better when I have a couple of seconds to think about what I’m going to say. It’s less likely to deteriorate into violence.
Anthony: Something is already brewing, it could even be connected to the Baltimore incident. However, I think it's below my pay grade. I hope it stays that way. I should let you go. It must be ridiculously late there.
“We did get engaged, but we didn’t make it down the aisle. I hope you do better,” Leo smirked at her. Why did she have a feeling that he knew something she did not? “Remember to always listen to each other, really listen.”
Tony: I can totally raise a teenage android. Although, Afia says she is a Synthetic Wakanda American. Also, people were terrified of Vision because he’s an android. Afia wants to be an Avenger, so maybe it’s better if she has a secret identity.
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last conversation. All of you are so wonderful. Welcome back to the “good” timeline.
Purple Princess: Good morning, fellow members of the Spider Venom Conspiracy group. It looks like Benji had an incredibly good morning. It seems like phase 1 of operation "get their heads out of their asses" is working.
: Lance Hunter, former Shield agent and former lieutenant in the British Special Air Service.  Was married to Shield agent Barbara “Bobbi” Morris a.k.a. Mockingbird. Disavowed shortly before negotiations on the Accords began due to incident with the Russian government. See classified notes for more details.
Pepper pot: It’s obvious where you stand on him considering that you have Steve listed currently as DILF, a.k.a. dad I like to fuck in your address book. Before that, it was America's ass. Let’s not even talk about how you acted when he got married. I’m not stupid, Tony.
BITC: How am I supposed to know what’s going on? Nobody tells me anything. MJ told you about her missing cousin before me.
That second question, I almost don’t want to touch mostly because I know the answer for you and it wasn’t pretty. The answer wasn’t pretty for me either. I was sick all the time. Sometimes I know we didn’t have money for food and mom would go hungry so I could eat. She worked two jobs and we still didn’t have enough because I was so sick. But I had my mom and my pseudo-brother and that’s all I really needed. I was doing better than a lot of other kids back then.
Me: Let’s see, Melinda wasn’t there with us because she’s still trying to find Laura’s wayward husband and Laura was with her. So basically, a lot of the dinner involved being yelled at. Especially when Benjamin’s aunt realized what really happened last Saturday with the collapsed building. Also, Agent got to try out his shield.
Me: You thought that was a joke? That explains so much about our interactions. Friday, don’t send that.
Chief Mechanic: In addition to obviously being alive, the other Hunter is apparently my nanny. I'm not even sure how that happened. That’s probably why his diary was on the Stark server.
According to Dr. Leopold, he is from early 2018, sort of. This is where it gets convoluted. In late spring 2017, six of his coworkers were kidnapped by a “sentient Chronicom” and sent through a portal to 2091, where the last remnants of humanity live in a settlement called the Lighthouse ran by blue aliens referred to as the Kree. Apparently in this timeline Earth was destroyed in mid to late 2018 by an earthquake that cause the world to break apart. The exact date and catalyst for the destruction of Earth is unknown. Yes, it seems far-fetched, but if an ancestral plane exists, then other dimensions must as well. Therefore, it must also be possible to travel between different points in time.
Director May Rogers: I agree. I’m tired of Steve using me to avoid his Tony feelings. They’re exhausting.
Finally, the next batch of 13 chapters are off at proofreading. I will post the next chapter as soon as I get it but it might be more than two weeks.
“I believe Peter would still date you even if Ned was against it, but I think he would appreciate not having to choose between his boyfriend and his best friend.”
Agent L. Barton: That makes sense because Bruce wasn’t actually part of your group. If she’s willing to help, let’s bring her in. In my timeline, she is the Avengers on-site nurse. Or at least she was before hurricane Maria. She’s actually in charge of the Jarvis foundation’s relief work on the island. Oh, we definitely need her. I’m sure she has the same skill set as her counterpart.
Thank you to everybody who read or commented on the last conversation. Happy snow day to those of you who got one. I had to make my own snow day (because I had 2 inches of ice outside my front door) but I have a ridiculous amount of leave so it's OK. I didn't want to say anything Saturday but Misaky0 was able to finalize the artwork for Steve's second sketch pad entry.
"Or other super villains." And kids who take on super villains. He’s hoping that Peter stays out of trouble, but he’s concerned. Note to self, email Laura in a few minutes.
Tony Potts: Pepper mostly stays in the house in Manhattan, and I prefer to be with Morgan by the lake. It makes sense because Pepper is the CEO of SI. Of course, we mostly do survival stuff now because of Deke. We took over his think tank and made him our chief creative officer about 3 1/2 years ago.
Counselor Laura: I’m aware of the tape and the dark times that led to it. It made a comeback when my Tony “came out.” Not that he’s actually ever been in the closet since that tape came out but apparently, “no bisexuals” is a thing. Whenever a reporter says something about my Tony waiting so long to come out, he tells them to Google the sex tape.
“I made sure that the ATCU servers could not be hacked by the Watchdogs and therefore President Ellis never withdrew from the election.” Ellis still beat the alternative.
HSBF: Were you and Pepper able to have lunch yesterday? Or is it already Friday where you are? It’s the 16
Blue phone: I thought you were already told you had to see a therapist, otherwise Colonel Rhodes was going to send you to the crazy spa. What is the crazy spa exactly? I assume rehab.
Hunter: You don’t want Leo to find out that Simmons fell apart without him? That’s why you’re hiding everything from him, including Deke’s notes, that might be extremely useful.
“I hate you less and will not try to convince Steve to date anybody else.” Natasha tells him with a smile.
OIG stands for the Office of Inspector General. In this case, we’re specifically talking about the Inspector General for the Department of State. I feel like the office was busy during the Ross administration in the MCU. At least they are busy in the timeline of my story.
Anthony: Of course they’re expecting me to hand over the shield first so they can pick a new paragon of virtue to masquerade as you. Well everybody but Agent Scary and Coulson as well as their team, that is. Apparently it’s not an Avenger team, if you don’t have a guy on there looking like the living interpretation of American nationalism. I feel like Coulson should count, but the acting dictator thinks differently.
“Which means we have to work through our mountain of bull shit. Yeah, we definitely need an Avenger therapist. Maybe we should do couples therapy?” Tony suggested.
Agent 13: Yes. I just don't think they were expecting the person in the chair next to him to have an EpiPen. Virginia saved his life.
Red phone: At least this way, I can keep an eye on him so he doesn't accidentally get himself killed before he's old enough to drive.
Me: Also speaking of standing up for what you believe in, congratulations on punching out that asshole. If he does press charges, you know the legal team has your back.
Genius Princess 2018: It is 7:23 AM Sunday morning, New York time. We are currently at the lighthouse facility after the Avenger compound was infiltrated.
Me: We’ve talked about this. Do not take responsibility for the stupidity of others. I’m stupid enough for both of us. This one’s on me.
If I’m doing the math right, the decimation happened about a month after Leo disappeared from this timeline. This means that we diverge from this timeline, or at least that’s what Bruce hypothesizes. This would be our future if he didn’t come. This could still be our future except Coulson is not terminal and Steve and Tony are practically married to each other. (I haven’t even met this timeline’s Tony yet and I kind of want to smack him upside the head for letting the situation get this bad.)
Cuddle fiancé: I understand how this can be difficult. I fought against actual aliens yesterday, and I’m not even sure I believe half of what was in the readout of yesterday’s meeting. You didn’t mention the thing about the hammer.
Chief Mechanic: No, she did not disappear during the Decimation. I didn’t know that there were accounts from Hunter prime in there.
Anthony: Pouring my heart out to you? Yes. But I'm still doing it because I'm a masochist. Also unlike anybody I would randomly meet at a bar you're probably not going to blackmail me. The only downside is you’re unwilling to try text message sex. I don’t know why because I can guarantee I can make you cum without actually being there.
HSBF: Mind. After what I saw Peggy go through during the last few years, I rather be able to remember everyone I love and care about than be able to run a mile in two minutes.
Welcome back to the "good" timeline. Remember, time is going slowly there. There is a reason, and it will be revealed soon.
I know that you're not really mad at Tony. You love Tony. You just want to protect him from the big bad boyfriend in Africa. I guess it was just easier to think that I didn't mean anything if you could just think that I was the rebound that he's only known for a couple months not a guy that he has known for several years and has feelings for a long time. Maybe the fact that we were so antagonistic to each other for those years probably makes you even more wary of my relationship with Tony.
Sorry I didn’t update Sunday. I got so busy writing chapters I forgot to upload the new chapter. Yesterday was, unfortunately, an in-person workday, and I didn’t get home until late. This is why I usually only post on the weekends. Thankfully telework allows for other options.
“There are a lot of things that I'm not ready to talk about, especially those involving the war. I've barely told May some of that stuff.” Steve explained.
Me: I wouldn't say god awful taste. I'm not that horrible, now that I’ve stopped making weapons of mass destruction. Okay there was that murder bot snafu, but we mostly dealt with it. Okay, maybe you’re right.
“That’s not true.” He was not sure if he was lying to Natasha or himself. Happy was more aware of the cracks in the relationship between Tony and Virginia than most people. Virginia was always a mess when Tony was on missions. That’s why she ended things when he started searching for Hydra.
Tony: In addition, you just have to appreciate a guy who literally went to the edges of the galaxy to get back the woman that he is in love with. As opposed to running away from the people you love.
SimmonsJA: We couldn’t just jump into bed after that. We had to rebuild and you have to do the same. Now we’re looking at houses or rather apartments. Everything in DC is so expensive. $1600 for a one bedroom in Alexandria and they don’t even have breakfast nooks.
HSBF: So it’s Thursday, your time anyway. It’s technically Friday morning for me. Are you up to date night?  Or are you busy? Did something come up?
I also love your body but that’s not all I love about you because you can buy a perfect body if you have enough money. But you can’t buy happiness or compassion, or any other really good quality. Actually, sometimes I think money takes those good things from you.
This conversation takes place just a few hours after the last one. Also, at least once during this, there is a gap of about 15 minutes between messages. See if you can guess where the gap is.
SimmonsJA: All relationships have lows. I fell in love with somebody else when stranded on a desolate alien planet for six months and gave up all hope of ever being rescued, when in reality Leo literally went across the universe for me. That was after the year before when I ran away by taking an undercover assignment because I couldn’t deal with my own guilt after watching him almost die for me.
Me: You know what, I am just going to ask you to keep drafting what you want to say to Happy. Maybe if you put down a few bullet points, things will go better.
Anthony: Laura is dealing with the teenager aspect of it and I get to deal with everything else. I think she’s forcing him to go to his DC field trip that he was avoiding because punching robbers and destroying bodegas is so much cooler.
This was why she was surprised to see Phil. She expected him to be part of the damage control since he would be in charge of the Shield part of the ATCU once Director Rhodes was gone.
"Anything spicy that doesn't contain sunflower seeds or yogurt. Apparently, I'm developing a yogurt allergy."
Me: Thank you. Yes, it would be easier for Honey Bear in Malta, but that’s not the only reason. I don't necessarily need to be in the tower when the happy couple is reunited. Besides, I’m the king of teleworking.
Red phone: More like I didn’t want to be surrounded by the sheets that Pepper picked out. I only crashed in the penthouse tonight because my last meeting didn’t end until almost 9 PM.
Really, Hunter should’ve expected everything to go pear shaped very quickly. That’s usually how it is with Shield. Although, he was hoping that Leo’s experience the first time around would keep things from going to shite. No such luck. Which totally explains why the Princess picked him and the special project up from the Lighthouse before making their way to the future home of the West Coast Avengers. Which happens to be a part of the Stark Industries Malibu campus that’s been laying mostly unused since they switched to electronics and clean energy and a good portion of the company moved back east.
Counselor Laura: He got his daughter to come clean about his Inhuman racism. In addition to the various extramarital affairs. From there, all the illegal spending came out, and he had no choice but to resign as Secretary of State. OIG is still dealing with all his dirty laundry from his tenure at State.
"Possibly yes. This is why I ended up giving him the original suit in the first place. Now I’m kind of regretting grounding him because this happened."
Me: I think I own a house in her district. Maybe I should consider running. I wouldn’t be any worse.
Me: Because the situation in LA went FUBAR and Karen may be with me for a while. You do remember that acronym?
This is the last chapter that will come out before the season four premiere of Agents of Shield in the US. I am planning for things to diverge from the MCU at this point. In my mind Tony and Steve talking to each other can make it better for the enhance person community as a whole (before purple alien show up). I already have my own director picked out. Feel free to guess.
Me: Also, I don’t even have to look at the rest of this chain to know that the friend thing is a polite lie. I don’t need polite lies.
I guess I should start by saying that I love Tony. I love every part of Tony, not just the version that is sitting in a meeting on how to get guns away from poachers and other terrorist organizations., I don’t just love the version of Tony that helps seven-year-old girls with their homework or does everything in his power to keep his new BFF safe from anti-gifted terrorist groups.
"It’s just that he always had my back during my bad judgment calls back then, mostly involving trusting Obadiah. Before there was Pepper saving my ass, there was Happy. Obviously not following May’s plan was a bad call because we were right and somebody was after the Avenger tech. Really I am glad May brought the shield with her and did not leave it behind with the other things to be transported to the Avenger compound."
Siberia was one long string of bad judgment calls. The first being that Steve thought it was better to not let me know that my parents’ death was actually a Hydra orchestrated hit. When I found out that the Winter Soldier was the weapon of choice, I flipped. I mean full homicidal, ‘I'm going to fucking kill him’ rage. And I would have if Steve wasn't there.
Red phone: It's the old index on steroids, but with less security. I cracked the encryption in like five minutes and I wasn't even trying that hard.
Even Red is gone and I don’t blame her for trying to start a normal life. She’s on call if something bad happens but I hope nothing does. I wish Lily’s aunt would send a letter or something to let me know where she is and how she’s doing. It would be better if she would just come back but you mentioned she was busy with Melinda‘s daughter which is understandable. That is also good because Melinda was really worried about Skye Quake when we were in Johannesburg.
Me: Exactly. Besides if I can keep Tony Stark from self-destructing post-Siberia, I think I can help anyone.
Me: Really, just keep Nomad away from the TV and Twitter. 90% of what they’re saying is entirely false. Friday has the kids on total TV blackout because really, they don’t need to hear stuff like that about their favorite uncle.
Thank you to everyone who read or review the last conversation. Your encouragement is always welcomed and appreciated.
Me: And now I don’t want details. Bonus for you. Although, shouldn’t an all-expenses paid trip to India be a bonus? I’m sure Stefan will say no because I’m high maintenance. I will ask when he gets out of the shower.
Ana Jr.: The three messages contain instructions. Instead of bringing back something tangible, your Nana would like you to bring back Fitz since she sent you directly to his location. She would get you when you had him.
Genius Princess 2018: We are grateful to establish contact with you after you were missing for 39 hours. We have unfortunately not been as successful with Agent Johnson. We have yet to receive any communications from her.
On April 28, 2018, half of all living life was wiped out by Thanos using the infinity stones. The Avengers were not able to keep him from getting all six stones. The last stand happened in Wakanda, which makes sense considering some of Robin's early drawings. I am starting to think that maybe the baby bird can see the future of multiple dimensions and timelines, not just our own. Perhaps she was showing us what would happen if Leo didn’t intervene. I don’t know for sure.
Red phone: Probably because you saw the news. Although, if you saw the news, you would know I was busy. It's just me and the purple wonder right now.
"You know that wasn’t a me choosing Bucky over you because I care about him more then you situation?”
CoulsonPJ: I think I still would have sent you to babysit Stark although hey, at least this way you are a card-carrying Avenger. I can’t wait for you to get your own action figure. I’m buying three.
Pepper pot: That part, I understand. Although how does that affect things here? You said time travel is closer to Star Trek than Back to the Future???
“I’ve adapted to our current circumstances, but that doesn’t mean I’ve given up hope. Robin says we can do this. I believe her. You could have Fitz back.” At the name of the six-year-old, Laura almost relaxed.
Me: Or why Nomad has gear that carries the hallmarks of SI design. Actually, Friday, we better not send that message just in case someone’s intercepting this. I don’t want them to accidentally find out Steve’s new identity. (message not sent).
Cuddle Bunny: Tony, just let me know that you’re safe. Or Friday, can you please tell me that he’s okay.
Me: The latter means that you're accepting the situation for what it is. It means you are no longer hoping for a super villain to make a time machine and send you back to 1945. The former means holding onto a dead dream that can no longer be fulfilled and not allowing yourself to find new things that will make you happy.
Morgan’s dad: I don’t know what I need. Remember when I said I needed you, but I didn't need you now. That was a lie. Why do you always have to be such a self-righteous dick? [Message not sent]
“We know who is responsible for funding the Watchdogs but because he is a highly successful Russian businessman, we can’t touch him.” The director explains.
Me: It's the beard and the new hair color. It looks sexy and totally worth the beard rash. But he does not look like Mr. Clean Cut All American Boy Scout anymore, thank Thor.
Me: I think he really bought this for SHIELD purposes especially in light of the bunker that I discovered underneath the property two years ago.
HSBF: Not long. I didn’t know about it until her brother caught her reading the messages and told me. Now that he’s back together with his ex-girlfriend, his sister likes to read our text messages to keep “entertained”.
Anthony: Yes, but you were more riveting and the security team was a little worried they couldn’t secure the venue ahead of time like here. Also, I was too emotionally exhausted to deal with other people after the plane ride with Happy and being ambushed by Sam. I am so glad Happy Bear doesn’t hate you anymore, I think.
Me: Depressing. So I'm a little pissed off about how much of my money was secretly funneled to xenophobic assholes and certain politicians that personally blamed me for their mother’s death.
Monkey lover 2: You were the one who named the operation. They’re called monoliths. Did anybody get eaten by the monoliths?
Me: The only people who are oblivious are those two. Honestly, I think Anthony is relieved that Colonel Rhodes is in charge so he doesn’t have to keep up the subterfuge. The fake porn text messages become boring after a while even for him.
Kitty brother: Not actually what he does according to the other timeline’s intelligence reports but an action that warrants attention nonetheless.
Anthony: I know you’re scared, but I am as OK as I can be after an assassination attempt. And it wasn't even a good assassination attempt. It was death by appetizer.
Thank you to everyone who read or left comments on the confidential annotations. You’re all absolutely wonderful. I had a really good vacation. Although I didn’t get any writing done. Thankfully for you guys, I sent a bunch of stuff off to proofreading before leaving. Now I have lots of chapters to update. The only story I’m not updating this weekend is Hydra Lullaby because that story is currently sharing a beta with this one (although if anybody would like to volunteer so that is no longer the case. I would appreciate it).
“Actually, no," Friday responded. "Mr. May-Rogers paraphrased it, but that's the sentiment of the question.”
Friday: Ana 2018 actually sent me the transcriptions of their text message conversations that led to their reconciliation and eventual engagement.
Nomad: Sorry. My therapist thought that I should try to make amends with other people that I’ve hurt. I thought Pepper should be on the list also.
"So it might actually be almost a decent time in California." Tony said as he reached over to get his cell phone. His normal one, not the Avenger burn phone.
Melinda: Then it would be better than what you have now. Friendship is never a consolation prize. You need to keep moving forward. Even if we can undo what happened, we still must live with the scars.
D FitzSimmons: I don’t want to hear what Bobo one is telling him. Yes, I gave Daisy over to the blues. Do I regret that now that I no longer live in a dystopic hellscape? Yes. In the dystopic hellscape, it was a necessary evil. Well, that dystopic hellscape. I lived through a few.
Me: I’m just doing so much to contribute to the delinquency of minors. I feel like I have a new most embarrassing moment. Oh great, she probably knows about the old embarrassing moment. I am a horrible role model.
Anthony: PTSD and depression and other things mixed in there along with the substance abuse issues. I’m not okay. I’m nowhere near okay. I tried to murder someone because he killed my mom, but I’m getting better.
Me: Are you planning to be the one to arrest him? That would be awkward since you’re kind of his ex-girlfriend. I really want to hear that story.
“That’s good. What did Happy say?” Steve asked as he perused the menu. He’s probably just going to let Tony take something.
I guess we can’t really do that one the way they intended us to do it in this format so let me just name five positive characteristics about you and then you can send me five back.
Nomad: Yes, we did. We will watch Star Trek Beyond together as soon as you get me a copy. In the meantime, you can keep telling me about your crush on my acting double.
Me: You’re going to change things. Maybe you already have, because Baby Bird is drawing new stuff. At the very least, I don’t think Director Rhodes will make the same mistakes that the other guy did. Score another point for you.
Anthony: I’m well aware I’m a little screwed up. I had to spend two hours with a therapist today before I was able to announce to the world that Pepper left my ass.
Me: It wasn’t really end of the world in the literal sense. It was more like the end of civilization as we know it due to most of Europe becoming mind controlled zombies under the influence of an ancient enhanced person that inspired the Devil mythology and the group that became Hydra.
“You too,” Steve said just says the screen went black but only for a few seconds. The signal was back with Pepper in front of the screen.
The POTUS meeting is on your schedule along with the rest of the day blocked out for meetings at the ATCU. Friday will be meetings with a few science NGOs. I thought you could use a light day. I will also meet you in DC. Although, I have this feeling that I won’t be allowed to come to any of your ATCU meetings. However, the board wants to meet Saturday. They want a read out on Mumbai. Just to warn you I think they’re going to try to freeze you out again.
: Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes a.k.a. the Winter Soldier a.k.a. Bucky Barnes a.k.a. White Wolf (as the children are referring to him). Murdered Stark’s parents in 1991 due to being brainwashed and tortured by Hydra. Before kidnapping and torture was best friend to Steve Rogers since childhood. He is currently doing well on his treatment regimen, including therapy. He is starting to share anecdotes about his childhood with the Captain. Contrary to what Steve believes, James always knew of Steve’s relationship with Artie.
They never wanted to keep their relationship a secret for the sake of no being proud of each other. There was nothing Steve was more proud of than having Tony as his boyfriend. Every day he woke up and wondered what made him deserving of the most perfect partner. They did it to avoid this — the things the reporters were saying on the news.
They never kissed outside of one of their apartments or in complete solitude, never even embraced in public. The one time they broke the rules, the one time. It hurt that staring at this sweet photo of him and Tony embracing was one of the worst nightmares of his life.
Steve slipped his hand over Tony’s cheek, his large palm covering the whole surface. The pad of his thumb rubbed Tony’s soft temple. “Are we not already official?” Steve whispered.
“Put me in contact with the paparazzi that leaked those photos or I’ll find him myself and trust me, you don’t want that,” Pepper threatened through gritted teeth. After angrily cursing, Pepper threw her phone onto the ground. She plopped herself down in exhaustion on the armrest of Steve’s chair.
Steve couldn’t hold back his smile. His cheeks blushed warm and bright pink as he held both sides of Tony’s face in his hands and leaned in to kiss him, hard and passionately.
“I’m here to tell you all that I am very much in love with Mr. Captain America over there...I mean, look at him!” Tony gestured towards Steve, who turned violently red at the attention. But God, did Steve love him back.
“Well...I don’t know if I’ll ever be ready,” Tony said honestly, staring into Steve’s eyes, “But I do know that I am hopelessly in love with you, and this seems like the perfect opportunity to show that off.”
“Next question!” Tony pointed into the crowd blindly again, landing on a dark-skinned man with a dapper, checkered olive tie.
“I’m sorry, I’m not sure I—” Suddenly, Tony was cut off by the heat of a body next to him, grabbing the mic out of his hands.
“It’s time boys,” Pepper raised her eyebrows at the couple, gesturing for the door. Steve laid one last kiss on the top of Tony’s head, letting his hands rub delicately down Tony’s arms. Tony smirked and walked toward the door, Steve following right behind him.
The way the media portrayed him always made him out to be nothing more than a smarmy bastard, and while it could be true, Tony was so much more than that. Seeing the news tarnish him everyday was like a constant stab in the gut, and now it was being dialed up to an 11. Every news channel was covering the pictures, and needless to say, Twitter was completely broken.
Tony commanded the room at once with a simple throat clear into the mic. Everyone instantly sat in silence only interrupted by slight mutters.
“Tony Stark is no womanizer or a “bad boy,” he is the epitome of generosity and goodness and…” Steve trailed off, staring into Tony’s large, honey eyes, “I am inexplicably in love with him.” Steve squeezed Tony’s hand tightly.
Happy held the large doors open with his back, allowing the 3 to walk through. Reporters and journalists alike burst up out of their seats, shoving mics and cameras toward Pepper and the supposed couple. Shouting questions ensued and Steve backed away into the corner with Happy as Tony and Pepper head to the podium. While Pepper grabbed the mic, Tony cocked his head to Steve’s view, shooting an enticing wink. Even after so long the man could still make Steve blush like a little kid.
Like a firework, every person in the room jumped up, bombarding Tony with microphones and cameras and questions.
“Now, I’ve been told that you are allowed three questions so…” Tony put his hand over his eyes and aimlessly pointed into the crowd, “You!” His eyes opened upon a slim brunette wearing a navy blue pantsuit.
Sounds of cameras and reporters outside of the tower sneaked its way into the living room. The television volume was low but the talks of reporters boomed in his eardrums, and the loudest thing of all was the picture plastered across Tony’s 65” screen. His arm around Tony’s waist, pressed up against the back alley of Stark Tower. Their lips intertwined. He remembered the exact moment too, it came to life in his head. It was just two days ago, a particularly warm and sunny day in New York, the birds were out chirping and the wind swept through them enough for Steve to catch a scent of his boyfriend’s entrancing cologne.
“I assume we are all here today to discuss the recent photographs that have come out regarding myself and Mr. Captain America, and I’m here to report to you all that…” Tony paused for a short moment. He looked over his shoulder, staring into Steve’s eyes. That was all he needed. “The pictures are entirely real, and the rumors are entirely true, Steve Rogers and I are in fact in a romantic relationship.”
Pepper shakes her head at the chaos that the press conference had become, but what else could she have expected. She bit the inside of her cheek, containing a smile at her two boys who stared at each other in love.
Steve finally checked his phone as Pepper prepares Tony and runs him through his generic, conveyor-belt lines. Natasha had called 3 times and texted asking a myriad of questions, most of them wondering if he and Tony were alright. Sam’s texts and voicemails were mostly the same, with the exception of untimely jokes about how it was a “good thing they didn’t catch you guys with your pants off.”
Tony grinned with a slight wink — the playboy smarminess in him making an appearance — and turned around to face his friends.
A squeaky plump blonde in the front bounced up and down with her mic in Tony’s space, obnoxiously repeating his name.
Steve’s phone buzzed in his pocket, the obnoxious swell of ringing and the vibration on his leg only increasing his unease. His heart continued to sink even further in his stomach along with the wave of nausea that spread across his body. His head was too heavy and the air in his lungs was slowly being pulled out as if through a tube. Rhodey rubbed Steve’s left shoulder, hanging his head.
Pepper put her hand on Steve’s knee, “Listen, I’ll contact all the media outlets I can, tell them to report that it’s photoshopped or we make them go bankrupt—”
The sound of reporters and journalists settling into the conference room uneased Steve. He shook anxiously, fiddling with his thumbs until Tony grabbed them. Tony lifted Steve’s hand up to his lips, lightly kissing the tips of each finger.
Pepper anxiously paced behind him, screaming wavering expletives into her phone. Steve sensed her scratching at her forehead like she does when she is in typical panic mode, yet this instance was different than any other media coverup she’d had to handle before.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Must I always have to explain to you people? Maybe I’m saying I’m ready for us to become...Facebook official as the kids would say.”
Tony rubbed Steve’s cheeks as the edges of his lips curved up. He leaned in and kissed him, hard yet gentle and full of adoration. Pepper cleared her throat.
The energy running through their arms propels them forward, locking their lips in front of the already boisterous crowd. As their lips collide, for a moment the sounds of questions and camera flashes disappears, and it’s just them in an empty hall.
Steve slanted his eyes at Tony in confusion, adjusting his body so they were standing face to face. His hands remained on Tony’s shoulders.
“And you,” Pepper pointed her finger at Steve’s chest, “Don’t say a word, Tony and I will take only 3 questions and answer them as vaguely and briefly as possible. Do you boys understand?”
“Tony…” Steve walked towards his boyfriend, wrapping his arm around his waist just as he had in the now infamous picture. Pepper turned off the television in the background. Tony looked up at Steve and smiled, and somehow through it all he had one millisecond of calm staring at the creases in Tony’s cheeks and his sparkling eyes that looked up at him with so much love.
Okay...I just loved this idea so much that I had to add a second chapter <3 Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoy!
Despite the massive difference in stature, Steve was still quite intimidated. He nodded, too afraid to do anything else. Happy looked over, raising his eyebrows and backing away from the angry Pepper. Tony however looked eerily casual, but then again he usually did. He floated through life with a comfortability that insinuated he built the room itself and therefore belonged. Some thought that behavior was arrogant, Steve loved that about Tony.
Steve smiled, he could relate to the kid, having grown up with his mom and Bucky and not much else. The Avengers were like family to all of them.
“It’s okay, Steve. Really. I want you to be happy,” Tony grabbed his shoulder. Steve frowned, suddenly he knew where Tony was going with this and he didn’t like it.
“Wow, that I did not see coming… Huh.” Tony crossed his arms and seemed to ponder this thoughtfully before moving on. Happy was definitely going to get a very unwelcome phone call later.
This chapter and the next chapter were actually supposed to be one, but it was getting too long so I decided to cut it into two :P
“Cap, all I’m saying is I wouldn’t blame you. We don’t all get second chances… so, make it count.” Tony stuck out his hand. Steve looked down at it before glancing up at the shorter man. “Steve, are you going to just leave me hanging here?” Tony joked stiffly.
“I’m sorry, are they like ‘boyfriend-girlfriend’ now?” Tony laughed and Steve thought it was sort of amusing, but also disrespectful, of course.
Steve stood on the platform in his quantum suit, the briefcase of stones in one hand. Banner - or Professor Hulk as he seemed to be going by now - had nodded at him and he was off.
“How did you… how did you figure that out?” He asked. He was really going to have to be more stealthy if a four-year-old could figure out his identity from spending five minutes with him. Even if that four-year-old was clearly a genius.
thanks for reading! here's to hoping that i can find this fucking outline so i can continue the story the way i was planning on it instead of having to come up with something elseeee lmao rip me
Steve shocked himself with how much he enjoyed the domesticity of it all. Yes, there were aspects of it that left some room to be desired, such as the fact that they were on strict instructions not to leave Tony alone at any time which Tony found horrendously annoying and Steve and Peter found uncomfortable at times. Other than that, it was fine though. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was interrupting something he didn’t deserve to witness, but Steve found himself cherishing every moment with Morgan. It was clear that the girl was becoming attached to him, as well. Steve just hoped he wouldn’t let her down somehow.
“Happy, can we talk?” Rhodey looked between him and Morgan. Happy picked up on the hint and put her down. Morgan pouted at them both and her lip began to wobble.
The Russian phrase Morgan says means “I will end you” lmaooo (it was just google translated so probably isn’t completely accurate, please forgive me, actual russian speakers)
“Hi, Morgan,” Steve smiled back at the girl. She looked entranced by the bruises on his chest and the different colors they all were.
When Tony emerged from his office and headed upstairs to the master bathroom, the three men in various places around the living room all froze and stared for a second before turning away and acting unphased. Peter came from the room a few seconds later.
Once they were inside, Professor Hulk instructed Steve to lay down on the cleared off dinner table and take off the suit so he could have a better look. He used Rhodey as his ‘hands’ because he claimed he could no longer do the detail work required to provide medical assistance.
“You need to flip the camera around, I’m guessing.” Peter lost it from his place on the couch, laughing uncontrollably.
“My god, you’re getting sassy. How’s this: I’m your Dad and I said so… and also I love your hair just the way it is,” Tony ran his fingers through her hair and she frowned at him.
“Jesus, kid, what?” Tony rolled over in his spinny chair to pick up the picture that fell. It was of him and Pepper in the hospital. They were both looking down at the squirming pink blob in Pepper’s arms in complete amazement. Tony only allowed himself to admire it for a moment, before placing it face-down on the desk.
When Morgan was two Tony decided it was his turn to pick. He had decided on “robot” and Pepper had agreed. She thought it was ridiculous that he built an actual robot suit, complete with a program to alter little Morgan’s voice to make it sound more robot-like, as well as a heater to prevent her from getting cold when they took her trick-or-treating. Pepper had told him that a cardboard box with tinfoil like all the other kids would have been fine, but when had Tony Stark done anything just “fine” when it could be great instead?
There, Tony saw Steve already reclining on the couch, hot chocolate in hand. There were two more mugs on the coffee table (on coasters, of course, Steve wasn’t a barbarian) along with a plate of waffles. Steve had some serious bedhead and Tony believed this was the first time he’d seen Steve in pajamas, considering usually he already was out of the house at ungodly hours for his morning run.
Steve had taken to cleaning up around the house a bit while Tony was otherwise incapacitated. Just the easy stuff, like doing the dishes and picking up Morgan’s toys and things. It made him feel rather like a housewife, but he surprisingly sort of liked it. He felt like someone needed him, depended on him. It was a nice feeling.
“So, are the Avengers like a cohort then?” Steve and Tony looked at each other for a moment, then shrugged.
“I’ll take it, just give me the phone,” Steve obliged and Tony switched positions with the blonde. “Your costumes are probably a better match anyway.”
Even Spider-man had taken a bit of a hiatus given Peter’s decision to take the fall semester off, instead doing online material from his Midtown teachers while staying at the lakehouse. After some negotiating with May and a letter Steve had written under Tony’s name, the arrangement was set that he would come back to school at the end of January, when spring semester started.
He had phoned her the night that everything happened, asking for permission to stay at the Stark’s for a couple of days. He was curled up on the couch with a blanket that didn’t cover his feet and it was late.
. Some sessions, the shrink went back to childhood wounds that Tony had nearly forgotten he even had. Other days it was Afghanistan. Some days it New York or the Snap.
RECAP: Steve goes back in time to return the stones and comes back the same age but a bit beaten up. He goes back to the house to get fixed up and takes a nap. The chapter ends with him and Peter going to grab Tony for dinner and finding him after having attempted suicide.
manners, please,” Steve sounded exasperated and Tony casually held a hand over his mouth to cover his smirk.
“Oh my god,” Peter whispered and followed Steve in. Steve waved smoke out of his face before his eyes set upon Tony, slumped over in his Audi with the engine running.
“Oh, ha, ha,” Steve rolled his eyes once again before grimacing, realizing that even pretending to laugh hurt. He better not have punctured his lung again.
It was Sam and Bucky who had suggested having the holidays at the Stark (and Rogers) residence for the team. They argued that after Thanksgiving, it just made sense. Considering there was nowhere else for the team to gather besides what, Missouri with the Bartons, no thanks, it was agreed that Christmas would be at the lakehouse.
“Mr. Stark?” Peter’s voice was distraught and before Tony could answer, the door busted open, lock cracking open and door flinging open with enough momentum to knock pictures off of the wall.
Tony stood up and walked to his office, shutting the door but not locking it. Steve followed him in, closing the door behind him and crossing his arms.
“Of course,” his voice was slightly shaky and Peter cringed a little, already predicting this would not end well.
He gave her a curious look to which she said, “I want to be able to see you get better,” as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
“Took you long enough,” Sam joked and Steve smirked, dropping the briefcase and clutching his ribs gingerly.
“That’s what she said,” Tony couldn’t help himself and Steve rolled his eyes. On one side of the chart was the rough guest list for Christmas, the other side had the available rooms and their current inhabitants listed.
“In the agreement. Yes, I’m aware, but I’m not going to go and do anything drastic, I just need to be alone for a minute,” Tony threw up his arms in frustration but Steve didn’t move from his position.
Standing at the front of the crowd was Tony, who Rhodey and Happy had been concerned about even attending the funeral. Every knock on his door as a reminder had been ignored and he still hadn’t emerged from the depths of his office. However, the morning of the funeral Tony stepped out in a black suit, hair tousled and eyes puffy, and closed the door behind him. He didn’t say anything to anyone, he didn’t even look at anyone. Except for when Morgan saw him.
“You’re gonna do a lot of great in this world, okay?” Tony squeezed him and then without another word, fled the room.
After the funeral, people began to head out, all with a sympathetic look at Tony. Even those who hadn’t always been Tony’s greatest fans were different.
This was not to say that Steve spent the entire night watching him or anything which he definitely didn’t because that would have been weird and there was no reason for him to do that.
“But I still had May to talk to when things got really bad. And she had me, too. I think the worst part was when something good would happen,” Peter said and Tony inhaled sharply through his nose. “It was worse because you felt bad that the person couldn’t be there, but you also felt bad because you’re enjoying something that that person will never get to again.”
“I think I’ll pass, thank you,” he put the scarf back and opted to just go without one. It couldn’t be too cold, right?
“I know, Pete. It’s okay. You can stay until the funeral, but after that we need to sit down and talk about it, preferably with Mr Stark,” May had told him. He wasn’t sure Mr Stark would want to talk to him, or talk to anyone for that matter, but Peter sighed out of sheer relief that he wouldn’t have to leave so soon. Sure, it didn’t appear that Happy, Rhodey, or Captain Rogers we’re leaving him alone anytime soon, but he didn’t want to be the one who did.
The CEO dilemma was another issue entirely and one that took a lot more ass-kissing than Tony would have liked.
Can we all agree that Pepper’s catchphrase is “no” lmao,, Oof this was supposed to help cure my endgame depression by not killing Tony, but it’s only made me more sad. Oh well. Lemme know what you guys think of this/if I should continue it! I have an idea of where this is going but not really so I’m open to suggestions :)
“Merry Christmas, Uncle Steve,” Morgan said. “Should we wake up Uncle Rhodey?” The girl looked over the side of the bed to where her uncle lay snoring.
Tony sat in the tiny chair by Morgan’s play tent and stared up at the clouded sky. It was fucking freezing, but he wasn’t going to let something as stupid as temperature ruin anything. It was odd, being in a forest not overly far from where his parents had died on the anniversary of their death. Before, Tony had always been in Malibu or later the city, but the last five years had forced him to reopen the wound of his parents in a way that ran almost deeper than finding out about Bucky had.
“Morgan?” The girl looked up at him and smiled. “Do you want to come chop down a Christmas tree?” Her eyes widened.
Steve was in his own mind, staring mindlessly out the window when Morgan jumped into his lap. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he stared down at her in shock. He instinctively wrapped his arms around the squirming girl to stabilize her as she shifted on him, turning so she could show him her sort-of engine.
Peter poked his head into the kitchen, where Steve and Tony were standing, almost immediately. Knowing the kid, he was probably already listening somewhere nearby. Damn his super-hearing.
Steve scratched at the beard he had started to grow again shortly after the last fight against Thanos. Morgan squirmed until Tony put her down and then catapulted herself onto the couch, climbing onto Steve’s lap who held her now like it was a natural reflex.
Steve grabbed his hand and pulled him into a tight hug. Tony’s eyes widened and he stayed still against him for a moment before wrapping his arms around Steve in response. “Goodnight, Tony,” he let go and stepped back.
Everyone had basically accepted that Steve was taking a short break from his Captain America responsibilities due to the other responsibilities he had taken on since Thanos. He promised that if a big threat were to occur he’d be there, but so far there was nothing that couldn’t be handled without him or Iron Man to the rescue.
“Yep… you can think of it as an invitation, if you really want,” Tony shrugged, sitting back down into his own chair.
Why did Steve always feel the need to make a scene at inconvenient times? Though, really, there wasn’t much about the time that was inconvenient, it was more so that having this discussion at all was
“Alright, so Peter and Morgan in her room… we could put Clint and Laura in your office? There’s a blow-up mattress,”
The two weeks following The Incident, as it was dubbed, were awkward to say the very least. Rhodey had managed to push back going to work for a few days but eventually had to get back to his job. He and the other Avengers were focused on rebuilding the upstate compound and assisting with damage control. Happy had also returned back to his position at Stark Industries shortly after Rhodey left.
“You know, you don’t have to pretend like this is normal,” Tony glanced at him, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Well, then I better keep him company here.” Tony stood up to admire his work: Morgan seemed to be completely head-to-toe covered and protected from the elements, to the point where her snowsuit was puffy enough that she couldn’t quite fully put her arms down.
“Tony’s always been such a mess, for as long as I’ve known him really. Pepper - Pepper managed to give him some stability in his life even when he didn’t recognize it. I think you might be able to do the same,” Rhodey leaned against the counter and crossed his arms.
“What gave you that idea?” Tony sneered, still refusing to look at him. Steve shrugged. He knew he wasn’t wanted here but he forced himself not to turn around and give up.
The idea of the therapist itself was part of the arrangement made after The Incident. Bruce had managed to provide oxygen therapy for Tony without a trip to the hospital, but once he regained consciousness he forced Tony to sit down and shut up. Bruce had provided an ultimatum in exchange for The Incident being kept off of Tony’s medical records, which would result in a media field day should the news ever break, as well as put him in hot water when it came to his company.
After a prolonged second, Tony swallowed. “My mom was Jewish, well, she was an Italian Jew.. her, uh, her parents managed to escape during the war and came to New York. Anyway,” he shrugged, “my dad raised me Catholic regardless, so…” Tony trailed off.
“We made a compromise. You know that word yet?” She shook her head and he grinned. “Good, I still have something to teach you then… a compromise is when two sides with different views on something each give a little in order to come to an agreement.” Morgan paused and Tony could see her brain work through it.
Tony had originally refused to wear any costume, joking that the only costume he’d need would be the sunglasses and baseball cap he would wear to avoid being spotted by the press. Unfortunately for Tony, this had given Steve a genius idea going off the idea of anonymity, causing Tony to be stuck wearing the most “anonymous” costume there was: the classic sheet ghost.
“Okay… well, then we could stick May and Happy in Peter’s room,” Steve started and Tony stuck out a hand.
“The Barton kids can stay on the couches in the living room,” Steve crossed out their names from the list and wrote ‘
“C’mon, Daddy, get up,” Morgan pulled on his arm and he slowly let himself be dragged upwards until he was sitting. Begrudgingly, he stood and picked her up off of his bed, carrying her to the living room.
“Mommy had strawberry blonde hair, actually.” Tony shocked himself by not crying as he said this; instead, giving his daughter a small smile.
Tony felt a gentle hand on his back directing him towards the dock. Tony was surprised to look over and see that it was Steve. He let himself be walked over to the edge, where he saw Rhodey gently lay a wreath of flowers into the water. On top of the wreath was the Rescue helmet. The anniversary present Tony had made to protect her that ended up being the indirect cause of her death.
As they approached the house, Steve turned his head to look at his friends. “I’m making spaghetti for dinner if you want to stay.”
Tony didn’t have to even hear the familiar footsteps to know that Steve would soon be joining him. It became almost normal for the two of them to sit out here and talk. Or just sit.
The next couple of days included more actual holiday preparation than Steve would ever like to admit. Turns out hosting ten guests at your house for nearly a week is harder than expected. Steve spent all of his time cleaning and cooking and planning and it took more out of him than fighting ever did. Steve’s (already massive) respect for his own mother tripled.
“You have to be very, very careful, Morgan,” Tony told her as they gathered around the table for dinner. “It’s all very hot and I really don’t want you to burn yourself, so I’m going to do it for you and you can tell me what you want me to put in.”
ALSO, I imagine the final battle with Thanos taking place in very early October, so it’s been almost a full month since Pepper’s died at this point. Anyway, enjoy this chapter...
Steve made a goofy face and Morgan threw a tiny punch. Tony took the photo and found himself looking at it for longer than was strictly necessary.
“Hi, Tony, Captain Rogers, Colonel Rhodes,” May nodded at each of him as she said their names. “Hi, Happy,” she gave him a small smile and Peter swore he saw the man blush. He frowned and cleared his throat.
“Pepper was more than my wife and Morgan’s mom,” Tony’s voice cracked but he continued on, “she was my best friend.”
He craved locking doors and not having to explain himself every time he was alone almost as much as he craved booze or his other substances of choice while he was getting clean over the years. It became something he needed; something that he got pissy over when he didn’t have it.
He hadn’t exactly heard the knocking over his tears and thoughts, so when the knocks escalated to insistent banging on the door, Tony jolted up.
“M-Mr. Stark, Aunt May was saying that maybe I could stay here for a bit longer, it’s just I need to let my school know about -”
“No, choose another costume,” Tony put his foot down. Even Peter was giving him an odd look at his refusal.
“C’mon, the man has to eat,” Steve walked down the hall. “Queens! I’m bringing the good luck charm with me.” There were quiet snickers and Peter followed Steve down to the garage.
“No! Not at all!” Peter was suspiciously enthusiastic and Tony and Steve each raised an eyebrow at him.
“Is it that you’re Spider-man? Because I already knew that,” Peter gaped. Mr. Stark really had told her about everything.
He followed her through to the dining room and was greeted by a slew of well-meaning insults from his friends.
Tony opened both eyes at that bold-faced lie. “Well, Uncle Steve is a liar because I forced him to watch
Morgan was fighting the way her eyes kept involuntarily fluttering shut as she listened to her dad. She saw him clear his throat as he sang the next lyrics and she knew he was thinking about her mother.
unfortunately i lost the story outline i'd written before so uhhhhh that may be a problem but um i'll figure it out.
It was probably the most Steve had ever heard Tony talk about his mother. He was silent, hoping that Tony could continue talking and he did, just not about what Steve wanted to hear.
Steve sat down next to him, the chair creaking under his weight. He looked to Tony with concern, but it seemed to be fine. Hopefully, it wouldn’t buckle out from underneath him. His breath came out in clouds as he exhaled and he smiled a bit to himself, just like how he used to as a kid whenever it got cold out. He was usually immediately ushered back inside by his mother to prevent him from catching a cold, but it was always fun for the few moments before.
Steve wasn’t the only one who noticed Tony’s odd (but expected) silence. Peter kept on shooting concerned glances over at his mentor when he thought no one was looking. It hurt to see Mr. Stark hurt, but there was nothing he could really do about it. Or at least, so he thought.
Last year, was perhaps the most bizarre of Morgan’s costumes. Morgan, at three, had become vocal enough to express her choice in costume. She only wanted to be one thing: a toothbrush. Pepper had tried to bargain with her to be virtually anything else but Morgan was Tony’s daughter, meaning she was overly stubborn and counterarguments only made her more determined. So, Pepper had bought foam as the body and straws to use as bristles and Morgan was a very happy toothbrush.
” Tony continued despite the tears, but stopped when they overtook him as he started the chorus again.
“What, you let yourself get tossed around while you were out? You wanna talk about it?” Bucky pointed to the hand on his side and Steve rolled his eyes.
The two and a half men stopped to look up as they heard little footsteps come down the steps. There, standing at the bottom of the stairs, was Morgan dressed as a Baby Black Widow. The costume was a black jumpsuit, complete with a widow belt and even a little red wig which was adorably at a funny angle on Morgan’s head.
AGAIN, this chapter has some talk of a past suicide attempt which may be triggering to some so please be careful :)
“No…” Steve didn’t appreciate the look he was getting from the teenager but put down the cloth he was holding and followed the noise upstairs. It turned out that yes, it was singing, and yes, it was coming from the mouth of Tony Stark.
Morgan, on the other hand, was not very pleased that her Daddy suddenly had a job again. She did seem to be interested in what he was doing, especially when he pulled up holographic specs of new tech he was working on. The way her eyes lit up and she beamed when he would take a few minutes to explain what he was doing to her made his chest tighten. He vowed then that he would always take five minutes to teach her something new whenever he spent hours designing tech. It would always be worth it to see that look.
Me: At some point you’re going to have to deal with what happened in the other timeline. Maybe with professional help. In the meantime, you can feel less guilty ensuring that your younger brother gets engaged without having to go into deep freeze for 70 some years to rescue her from scary blue aliens after what happened in the Framework/Hydra hell. That’s acceptable lying. It’s OK to lie to save the world. Neither you nor baby brother should feel guilty about that.

Red phone: That bridge is already burned to ashes. I can barely comply with the thing as is. I know you can't.
Monkey lover 2: Yes. I have an idea what’s going to happen in the next couple years, although the purple thing that she is drawing is new. I also have an idea of what we need to do to keep it from happening. Lots of destroying of old Hydra tech and investigating Talbot’s future replacement. Maybe I can’t keep the world from falling apart, but at least I can make small differences like making sure Baby Bird isn’t overwhelmed with visions of the past and future.
Red phone: Like making out with your recently deceased former girlfriend’s grandniece before the body is cold?
Red phone: You still think I made that up? That's so sweet cuddle bunny. You don’t want to know what the government is keeping secret.
Me: He's an asshole, so of course he threatened to hurt my children if I don't lead them straight to you. He is worried about us being vigilantes, when he is enough of a monster to threaten to put my toddler in foster care/state custody and do worst to the older kids. I've been in foster care. I'm not letting that happen. I'll talk to you when I'm done.
Me: Here’s the problem, I met this great guy who I am completely in love with. Unfortunately, we do not live in the same country right now. The reason why we don’t live in the same country is I do not want to sign a document putting myself under government control, because I don’t entirely trust my government right now.
“How could anybody have blackmail on you back then? Before the Instagram oops incident. It’s also hard to blackmail somebody with something that’s already out there.”
Counselor Laura from 2023: I know who you think I am. You always put me on this pedestal of normalcy. You didn’t want me to be a part of your world. But I can’t love you and not be part of this world. I can’t pretend that there aren’t special children that need me, that there are heroes that need me. Maybe it was an accident that I was brought here, but I am needed in this 2023.
Tony: The first 13 before I turned on the radio. Although when Friday decided to play Linkin Park’s invisible, I felt it was time to let Steve drive so I could send text messages and read through reports. Deke’s interview with Ana 2018 was illuminating. I think I know where I need to start now with fixing things on our side.
“Not tonight because they have a few interviews tonight. They will do the talk show circuit in the morning since they're already in DC. Selling the Avengers again is not an easy task, and it might be necessary with what's to come." Afia explained.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just you’ve been down a while. I thought you could use some coffee.” She was carrying one of the extra-large cups along with a granola bar. Bless her.
Me: I’ll get Mary right on that. Who apparently needs my undivided attention. I’ll write you in a couple of days probably Sunday. I’m hanging out with Peter on anniversary day.
“It’s the Watchdogs,” Tony added, always afraid this day would happen, once he learned about the Accords database.
