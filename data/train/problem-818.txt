I take my seventh cigarette break today. It keeps me awake. God dammit I am tired. I caught a couple of hours when we had John locked in the waiting room, and a few more in the break room when I got to work, but I think it is finally getting to me. It has been days since I saw my bed.
I wonder if emergency services are even on their way. I had been to three other sites before this one. If they were following my text to John, it could be hours. This building was slated to come down in the morning. The area was cleared. Someone must have questioned it, though.
Everyone is different, they only know what they know. I hope the situation being revealed in several different minds tells a bigger story.
At first, it looked like his records, his important documents. I spent an hour looking through the old cases, his health files, his financial statements, trying to find anything to let me know this combination was sent to me for some other reason than he wanted me to be up to date on his records if something were to happen.
They are trying to frame everything so positively but I can see through their optimism. It is uncertainty that they offer me, not news of any kind.
“He kept asking me about the dessert.  He said it was supposed to be the dessert that was drugged, not the soup,”  the maître d’ said, helping Lestrade carry Sherlock’s rag doll body down toward the hall.
She tells me she has packed some clothes for Sherlock and a lunch for John, she couldn’t get through to him or the Detective Inspector, so she reached out to me.  She is unaware of the seriousness of the situation as well.
I am just about to snap at them and demand to know what is going on, because something is definitely happening. A nurse comes in, Mycroft looks at me expectantly. Lestrade looks as if he is about to burst. The nurse looks to Mycroft, who nods once, and then she leads me in past the doctors into his room.
It is another lunchtime gone since this entire problem began. The hospital kindly provided me with a cold sandwich from the canteen. Amusing. I hardly call the white bread and processed meats and cheeses ‘lunch’. I will have one of my people bring me something more suitable and stick with coffee for now.
But he needed the rest so hopefully he gets some sleep. His people are still everywhere in the building, so he will have updates if he wants them from his staff.
I tried to say it in the debris. When we pulled the ceiling and walls and bricks from on top of him. When we noticed the state of him. I was begging for him to hold on. I probably cried, shouting as he went unconscious, holding his bloodied hand. I said I was sorry for leaving. Sorry for avoiding him. And when the rest of the rescue team pulled me away so they could stabilize him, I said I was sorry for being an idiot.
I know that is a small detail. Most people don’t even know their blood type. But that wouldn’t be like him. He would know every detail about himself to the decimal point. He knows what his type really is.
I hear the sirens. I don’t know how long it has been. The stars have moved. I try calling out again. It is pathetic, barely a whisper above the shifting of the debris.
Grandmère tried to be kind in explaining that they didn’t want me getting the baby sick when he finally arrived, and I am doing a good thing by being away.  I remember loathing this explanation, now feeling as if I was being replaced by the baby whom they loved more than me.
Another message from Molly.  She’s asking me how Sherlock is, she hasn’t been able to go to see him.
When John awoke that morning, he felt more than a little hungover.  He opened his eyes to see a bedroom he did not recognize.  He was wearing a shirt and jeans, his shoes were somewhere out of sight. He would have gotten up to investigate, but his arm was pinned.  It was playing pillow to a guest in the bed.  Curled up to his side was a mostly nude consulting detective.
His cock was throbbing heavily. He could feel it pulsing on his tongue. And Mycie’s finger was pressing just
Sherlock grimaced and twisted on the spot, kicking one foot against the back of his calf as he considered his terrible options.
Mycroft tried very hard indeed not to laugh. He really, truly did. But he couldn’t help it. He emitted a short sharp bark, which to Sherlock’s great satisfaction obviously caused his nose to hurt and Greg to look at him in warning.
“Aw, that won’t be necessary, sweetheart. Just show off about it less, yeah? And don’t bloody let go of someone with a bad back when you’re supposed to be holding them upright!”
Pleasure tingled through John from head to toe as he carried on sucking. When Mycroft slipped a long, tapered finger, wet with spit, into his arse, he nearly bit his own cock off.
“Don’t be daft, of course I will!” called John from the bed, unable to twist round to look at anyone. “But I’m definitely not going to be able to do any wanking. Or anything much else for a bit.”
Sherlock sighed, cursing himself for being drawn in, but utterly unable to resist the presentation of data. It was shooting fish in a barrel, really.
“Well…,” blustered Sherlock, flushing pink at his unintentional admission. It was rather a silly thing to be precious about. He shrugged and sat next to his flatmate, his shapely lips quirking up at the edges in wry amusement.
“Fuck!” was all John could manage at this precise moment, unable to properly articulate his distress.
“Why do you think I want to do it?” giggled John, putting a hand to his cock to plump it up. “Be awesome.”
“Oh, thanks for the vote of confidence, dickhead!” he said, glaring at his smug, shower-fresh lover.
Lock hummed softly and the pair of supine flatmates exhaled deeply in contentment, visibly relaxing under the loving touch. Greg petted them in the same way, soothing them until they began to drift off to sleep together.
“Ow, don’t move me, that’s fucking agony! Just let me lie here and die!” John demanded. "It is my right as a British citizen to refuse treatment!"
Shudders began in his lower abdomen, jolting his admittedly rather stiff hips. Blood raced in his ears and he heard his pounding heartbeat loud and clear. His head suffused with pressure from the effort and the strange angle.
John could feel rather than see Greg wanking furiously behind him, and he could hear the slick slap of flesh all around him. Mycie joined in, stripping his sticky member with his free hand while the other worked away at John’s prostate.
“Think of it as an act of solidarity," said Greg. "All for one, one for all. John’s back hurts, my head hurts, Mycie’s nose hurts, and now your bum is gonna hurt.”
“Right,” said Greg, looking fondly down at the pair of sexually adventurous miscreants. “Nap time all round while Rosie’s still asleep. Me and Myc can go in your bed, John. We’ve been up since five! I’ll grab you some painkillers and water. No more silly buggers for a while, eh?”
Sherlock could not help but gawp at the pink flesh of his partner’s underside as it was revealed once again. John, all naked and folded up…
John was licking at himself, tickling his slit with the tip of his tongue. Sherlock thrusted into the air, desperate for contact.
“Keep your head forward, Myc,” said John in a voice thick with pain, entirely unable to stop himself being a battlefield medic. "Don't choke on it. Apply pressure - pinch the soft bit..."
“Hello, darlings,” said Mycroft, with as much casualness as he could muster. “You really ought to know better, the pair of you.”
“You really are tiresome sometimes,” Lock huffed, moving slowly to the bed. He was not quite ready to give up the fight just yet. “Erotically sound, of course. But tiresome. It’s not enough that you have three cocks to suck on a regular basis, and three mouths available to suck you whenever you require it. But is this enough for you? No. You have to have a fourth. You complete tart.”
“No, no. The technique is quite wrong. For a beginner anyway," he sniffed. "Turn around to face the headboard, and put your feet up as high as you can get them. I’ll put a pillow under your bum to help.”
“You with your backside open to the skies? Prick so very, very close to your lips… It does rather ‘get me going’, yes.”
He unfolded himself with slinky, effortless grace, and lay flat again, looking inordinately, infuriatingly pleased with himself. John gave him a fond, exasperated look.
They entered the flat quietly so as not to disturb the young Miss Watson. But their ears were met with a highly suspicious sound. Silence.
John gawped at him, as he always did when he witnessed this lascivious amateur burlesque act. Sherlock's lissom form seemed almost evolutionarily adapted for the task. He was the absolute precise dimensions, with the exact flexibility suitable for the task. His biology was simply fitted for the purpose. Nature had been kind. Though nurture had played its vital role. Years of practice and filthy exercises had given Sherlock Holmes the edge when it came to self-pleasure.
“I think evidence suggests otherwise,” he said, truthfully. “You are frankly disproportionately well-endowed with a rather deliciously thick appendage of which I am an eternally grateful recipient. You’ve got a nice big cock, all right, Watson?” He rummaged in his wardrobe to select his clothes for the day. “Fishing for compliments…,” he muttered to himself.
The intensity of the pleasure in his cock zapped through him at the same time as the intense pain in his back, sending a very confused set of sensations raging down his nervous system. He was having perhaps the best orgasm of his life, and he was in absolute fucking agony.
It was an odd sensation. But, bloody hell, it was a good one. Like giving an upside down nosh to someone else, and being given one yourself, but kind of not. It was, for want of better description, like 69ing yourself. The taste was familiar and strange at the same time. It sort of felt like cheating. Except it brilliantly wasn’t cheating. It was Advanced Masturbation. It was Wanking 2.0. It was Fellatio For Antisocial Experts. It was naughty. So very naughty…
“You let go of his legs, Lock,” he admonished, eyeing up the unscathed and self-righteous lad before him.
Irritation made John tense and he collapsed in temporary admission of defeat, exhaling loudly. He must remember to try and breathe next time.
“Ow! Can I stop now?! It’s horrible…” he whimpered, pathetically. “I’m…sorry I goaded John into sucking his own – ow – cock. And I won’t do it myself anymore!”
John cried out, mostly in pleasure, as the head of his penis slipped between his lips. He gave a little grunt of victory.
John moaned and jerked, unable to stop. His cock grew impossibly harder and his mouth gaped open, trying so hard to reach it, though he almost dislocated his neck in the process.
Shit, Greg! Where was Greg? Greg should totally see this gymnastic miracle he was performing. Not bad for a compact stocky bloke in his (early) forties, with a fucked spine.
“Exactly the response calculated to make him try,” said Mycroft, with a glint of knowing triumph. “And John is being punished enough. I admit I was less than responsible in my encouragement of the, erm, really very intriguing proposition. And Gregory, you didn’t exactly foresee…” He balked as Greg put his hands on his hips and gave him a rather threatening stare. “Yes, well, perhaps we won’t go into that. We’ve all suffered for our misjudgement. You, baby brother, have not.”
Mycroft crawled onto the bed and ran his nose up and down John’s soft perineum, inhaling his familiar musky scent. He licked at the base of his balls as they descended with gravitational pull towards John’s eager face, pushing his head between his lover’s spread legs.
John scowled at him. Not an easy feat for a man in his rather baroque position – legs over his head, feet hovering above the pillow; bare arse wobbling at the ceiling, undercarriage fully exposed.
Unfortunately, Mycroft chose this moment to pull away, wondering what on earth was wrong. He barely had time to register that a clonking great right foot was coming at him before it had kicked him on the side of the face, knocking his cheekbone and catching his nose. Instant tears filled his vision and his breath caught at the sharp pain racing up into his brain.
“Cmmmng! Cmmmng!” he warned, as his pelvis stuttered uncontrollably. Deep groans of encouragement filled his ears. His head span, lightning raced up his spine… Painful lightning, accompanied by a disconcerting creaking noise and a horrid pop.
“Nosebleed! Nosebleed!” said Sherlock in alarm, pointing at his very pale, very grisly-looking brother. “Greg - nosebleed, bad back, spunk in the eye! Disaster!”
Sherlock grabbed some out of the box and began mopping up John’s plastered face, feeling somewhat…odd…that much of the splatter was his doing. What was that feeling in his stomach, he wondered?
“Off, you. Go and sit quietly next to Mycie. Keep passing the tissues. Mycie, keep your head forward,” he instructed, voice slightly lower now that his hearing was on the way back. He felt like he was at work.
“Not at all. It’s merely a consequence of an entire career spent carrying heavy military backpacks. What are they - around 80-100 pounds? And you were at it for years after basic training. That would account for it, even if you hadn’t been injured in battle. Running through deserts, mountains and minefields with medical equipment, let alone your years of study, hunched over text books and bodies. It all takes its toll on mobility in later life.”
John felt his legs being dropped. He tensed to take up the slack, almost planking upside down to keep his body in position. It was too good to fail now. He adjusted his hands on his lower back and forced himself forwards.
“Shut up! I’m nearly there,” said the red-faced doctor in a strained voice. The sinews in his neck stood out as he forced his head forwards, and propped his hips further up off the bed with his hands. It looked (and if the man could only admit it, also felt) rather painful. His hard cock bounced tantalisingly close to his open mouth. Close. Close-ish. But not nearly close enough.
Mycroft issued a deep, agonised groan of his own and sat on the edge of the bed with his hands clasped over his face. He looked up pitifully, unable for the moment to be of any use due to the intense throbbing of his nose and his blurred vision. He felt the site of his injury very gingerly, praying that it wasn’t broken. The last thing his nose needed was a break, in his opinion. He hissed in pained relief. Not broken. Just badly bruised, and likely to swell to unsightly proportions. Working from home this week, he decided. Then he pulled his hands away and blenched.
Sherlock dragged his heels with an air of profound sheepishness and Greg grabbed him into a cuddle. He was too embarrassed to look up just yet, and he went all floppy as he was kissed on his burning hot face. Mycroft joined them, and rubbed at his brother's sore bottom soothingly until they led him over to the bed.
“The things we do to ourselves for a little thrill,” whispered the elder Holmes, shaking his head in despair. “Autofellatio. I ask you. The trouble is, he is very talented at it...”
“It’s rather incredible how motion soothes these tiny people to sleep, isn’t it? Perhaps I ought to commission an adult-sized one, for Lock’s insomniac nights,” he mused. "I could wheel him round the block."
“Nope,” agreed John. “Not gonna be up to silliness or buggery for a few days at least. Is your ear all right, love? Haven’t perforated your eardrum, have I?” he said with some concern.
“Nope. Think it’s just a muscular thing," he said, grimacing. "Wouldn’t be the first time. I'd say it was a heroic war wound, but it's just wear and tear from heavy bloody packs. I’ll see how it is in a few hours. Are you OK?”
. His balls were tightening irresistibly. He was going to come. He was going to do it. He was going to come in his mouth and swallow it, just like Sherlock said he couldn't.
John wailed, and the vibration of his voice round his erection pushed the unbelievable self-pleasure even higher.
The detective let out a howl of outrage and bundled into him for an impromptu wrestling match. Honour was at stake. But sadly, he was never any match for a furious and randy Watson. He was grabbed into a headlock, and they fell into a writhing heap, jabbing and poking at each other as viciously as they could through giggles. Eventually, as it always did, fighting became tickling, which became rubbing, and frotting, and snogging.
The attempt at self-sucking while Sherlock showered was, of course, calculated to get his attention, and to prove that what Holmes could do, Watson could do. Though John would never admit it. He didn’t need to.
Greg shrugged. “We’ll wake the babygirl. Think we’ll have to have it here. Then we’ll leave you in peace.” He turned grimly back to Sherlock. “Once the spanking is over.”
“May I say, if it’s of any consolation, although I have doubts about the success of the endeavour, I do fully appreciate the aesthetics of it? You are quite a juicy sight, Johnny…”
Mycroft leaned down to stroke at the back of John’s thick hair, and then at his brother’s dark curls.
“Don’t be sour, John, it’s very unattractive,” admonished Sherlock, though John was pleased to note that he took a small step back, just in case he needed to run.
Greg cocked his head with a frown, with one hand clasped over his bad ear. He caught sight of the blood-stained Holmes and balked.
“Ah!” His tongue made contact with his weeping crown, and he tasted himself, the illicit tang sending a heady shiver right through him.
Sherlock mistook the cry for orgasmic ecstasy. Unable to hold out anymore, he followed suit and came with a loud moan.
Lock exclaimed loudly as he gave himself two very hard final whacks, almost as though his hand was working of its own volition or being somehow puppeteered by Lestrade's.
From behind Sherlock’s door he could make out signs of life. Or, more accurately, the intolerable sound of Little Brother imparting one of his Lessons.
!” he declared slowly, pulling himself up to his full height with deliberate and sincere resentment. “That is a ridiculous suggestion with which I shall never comply!”
Greg caught the left foot. Or rather, his ear did. The heel whacked him squarely at the side of the head and he fell off the bed with a loud 'oomph!'. He lay stunned for a moment, hearing only a distinct ringing sound which he knew was not coming from somewhere in the room. It was like someone had turned his ears from stereo to mono.
“Don’t give me ideas. That’s just what he wants, being pushed around in a buggy, every whim catered for. We baby him enough as it is. Be bottle feeding next, and I draw the line at nappies.”
On reflection, perhaps 5am had been a bit early to coax a seduction. But John had woken up by instinct, usually expecting Rosie to start making noise at this time. His unconscious alarm clock didn’t realise that she was at Greg’s, being babysat by their other two partners, who had stepped in to allow Holmes and Watson to get a bit of work done undisturbed. They were all due to reunite at the flat this morning. John had been hoping to sneak a bit of action beforehand.
There’s a knock at the door.  Detective Inspector Lestrade enters the room before I could put away the alcohol. He sees the look on my face and decides to ignore it.  How he knew I was here is a mystery, I didn’t make myself known when I was upstairs.  Perhaps he is a better detective than I give him credit for.
“Bet you’re glad I couldn’t see that,” he grinned, impishly. “Hope you didn’t weren’t too hard on yourself.”
Sherlock gestured to his nude body, presenting himself like a game show prize. He turned, just to make sure John could really take in the litheness and grace. He gave his bottom a little wiggle to punctuate the point.
“I’m all right,” said Sherlock vacantly, regarding the Brueghel-esque scene before him in utter confusion. That hadn’t gone as well as he hoped it would.
“Mind your manners, lad. Right. Bend over where you are, and give yourself a ruddy good hiding. If you stint on it you’ll get it off me anyway, and I won't go easy.”
“It was an accident! I was wanking. His stupid back gave out. I knew it would! He should do more yoga! Yoga helps with flexibility...”
“Do you see this man? He’s very dangerous. We know he’s going to do something to hurt a lot of people, but we don’t know what or when. He works for some terror… bad people. He’s not so dangerous by himself, but he’s very good at carrying out orders. I have to stop him. However, so far all attempts have… been unsuccessful.”
I hope you are still interested in the story and that you haven't forgotten what happened up until now!
“Breathe, little Brother,” says a Mycroft, who hasn’t aged in thirteen years. “Turn your head and find air. Breathe the Easterly wind, brother mine,” his smile distorts his face. “I taught you better, Sherlock. You should have guessed his plans the moment he walked in. It was obvious by the way he had the top button of his shirt undone.”
“I know. You’re such a good boy and you’ve never had a proper one before.” He runs his hand over his face before burying his nose in Jack’s hair. “But this might be the only present you get. Do you understand that, Jack? This cannot be a regular thing. They won’t do it for us very often. Okay?”
"Nothing, it's fine." His fingers betray him and jerk. He hopes the right leg won't go next. He doesn't have a cane anymore. "Come here, Jack. It wasn't your fault, everything's okay."
“You were incredibly difficult to find. Jack knew what to tell us. Your plan worked perfectly. I’m just sorry we didn’t get here earlier.”
“No.” Her voice is firm. “I don’t want anything to do with him. You give him a name. I don’t ever want to see my eyes in this place.”
Mycroft straightens, his entire posture screaming outrage at John’s low blow. “Careful where you tread, Doctor Watson. Like you said, any doctor could do your job.”
I’m in the grass having our picnic. Pa is there. We are laughing and smiling with John and Mrs. Hudson. Grass is green. Sky is blue. John is bright and warm. Then we all play in Room. Everyone’s happy. Then the door starts to beep.
Snatching it from his brother's hands, he rips it open and admires the contents inside. “Jack, look what uncle Mycroft got for you!”
He's still in his pyjamas; they all are. Grabbing the hem of his T-Shirt, he braces himself and pulls it off.
Sherlock presses his lips into a fine line, looking more upset than Jack had ever seen him. “It’s not me I’m worried about,” he rolls sideways and turns his back to his son, “Don’t ask me anymore, Jack.”
The call Anthea made in the morgue pays off 12 hours later. With more calls from Mycroft, bribing, threats, forged signatures and more calls, Mycroft, his assistant and his parents find themselves in a clearing nearly two hundred miles from where Sherlock is, eighteen hours later. It doesn't take long for a van to drive up across the bumpy dirt path. The driver and his passenger, more of Mycroft's men, jump out and open the back doors. A few yards away, another man is operating a digger, rapidly making a deep hole in the ground. The engine switches off when the van doors open.
John sighs, not looking much better than Sherlock. “I’m afraid that interview about William and Charlotte was the last thing he needed. He had been improving. Now he throws up if I even try to put food near his mouth.”
Gentle fingers ran across the lines in his face, brushed every inch as though reading him like braille, before humming as though satisfied with what he had learned.
I mean, it was a surprise, when he finally acted affectionately to me. He mostly just did it in response to things I did. Like when I handed him a mug of tea, I once clasped his hand around the mug. Just a casual but warm-hearted gesture. It wasn’t an hour later that he was trying the same on me. I genuinely felt like he was learning to show love at the time. I don't know. Was he copying me to manipulate me somehow? Was that what this was?
And then I can’t see  well any longer.  Not because of ailment.  My eyes are flooded with tears.  I want this to be over.  I feel a hand wrap around mine.  I blink a few times.  John is there.  He is smiling, half smiling, saying soothing things I can’t quite make out.  I cough, I choke on my tears.  John has tears, too.
But there is hope there. That’s good. That’s something to cling to. We always look for that, it helps us keep on fighting for the patient, so the patient can fight for himself. So I have hope, I will fight for him. I am cautiously optimistic. Really.
But that’s not what I text back. I let her know he is being taken care of and that his brother is with him. I tell her that we will let her know when he is awake so she can visit.
The truth is… I think I was falling in love. We are more than just flatmates, we are more than just friends. It took, what? A year? Maybe even less for us to start something unspoken. Just simple, I would touch his hand a second longer than expected. I’d ruffle his hair or brush the crumbs away from his lips. I don’t know if he liked it or not. We never spoke about it. When I kissed him the first time, he didn’t kiss me back. He might have been scared. I was. He kissed me the next time, so we just kissed every once in a while.
Mycroft probably has his people looking for me by now. And that’s fine, as I said, I didn’t intend to leave, not really, not for long, and if they wanted to bring me back, I will come right back. But I may have been avoiding CCTV cameras on my way through the city.
John isn’t talking anymore, but he’s sitting there. He’s still holding Sherlock’s hand. He looks like he’s where he wants to be. He looks up at me and gives me a small smile. I hand him the coffee.
“Mr. Holmes is checked into room 115, just along here,” the maître d’ explained.  There, the hotel’s concierge was waiting with a spare door key.   He let them in.  It was a comfy room with one extra large bed.
I got it from the little place on the corner, near Scotland Yard. It was where I first met Sherlock, actually. I’d go there for lunch and he would be there. Not to eat or whatever, but just doing his observation thing. He must have been there at lunchtime for days before I noticed. I thought he might be stalking me, when I finally went to confront him, he ran away. I chased him down, and since the curry place was so close to the Yard, I had about a dozen officers running behind me after him.  When he was cornered, I asked him what he was doing staring me down all those days. I had to get rid of the rest of the officers before he’d answer, claiming there were ‘too many idiots listening’. It turns out that he’d witnessed something on a case I was working on and he said he knew who the murderer was. I go to take his statement, and he told me what he’d witnessed was what the victim ordered for lunch at the curry house that day. He didn’t see the murder at all.
He’s saying something now, but I’m not able to understand. Listening to him talk is enough, I grin, my eyes stinging with tears. I blink heavily.
I walk to the bedside to finally be with him again, but as I get there, his eyes gently close again. I look to the nurse, who is already talking to one of the doctors. The doctor pushes past me and does a quick examination.
“If we find out which chef is responsible for putting drugs in the food, we can isolate who was the intended target.”  Sherlock was posting another sheet of paper on the wall with the dozens already affixed there.  “It means we are going to have to go to this hotel.”
The alarm has been silenced. Everything looks normal, the respirator and heart rate monitors are all functioning.
John glanced down again at Sherlock.  There was a blotch of reddishness on him.  “What did you do to your collarbone?”
John in the show always ends up walking away when he's angry.  Even if he hasn't fully explored why he's angry, or what the other side is coming from.
And then we talk.  I do my best, but we do get to say the things we have always been meaning to say, and it is good.
There are hands on my face. Fingers are taking my pulse. Light is shone into my eyes. I open them and smile.
It has been a difficult day. Not that all the rest of the days haven’t been difficult. I think the lack of sleep and food and the whole state of everything pushed me right to the edge of my sanity. I’m glad I slept, though. I needed the rest. I’m glad of everything else I found, as well.
Then there were notes about astronomy in there. I am not sure why, but he was learning about the stars.
I take the seat next to the bed.  I've seen him stabbed, poisoned, and overdosed in the past. But I never sat alongside his bed during those times. Those injuries were from his other life. The life before this business he invented for himself and giving him a raison d'être for his life.  It got him on the other side of crime, solving it instead of living amongst it.
They left me in the room with him alone so I could meet him, get used to him. I looked at him.  He looked useless and pathetic in his cot.  He made little noises and wiggled a bit.  He didn’t know anything.  Grandmère was right.  It was up to me to teach him what I knew, so he wouldn’t be useless any longer.
I do good work. In the end, it helps. I solve crimes, punish the guilty. I do more than most. But this man is dead. Have I done enough?
Then why am I walking the streets instead, trying to escape, needing to think, instead of waiting, and fighting for his no-doubt imminent return to health?
Molly messaged me about the body. She did postmortem on him, it was a stab wound to the upper GI tract that killed him, the debris from the collapsed building that penetrated the corpse did not contribute to his cause of death.
Lestrade is here. He’s handled it too. He took statements, coordinated the rescue efforts got the team in as soon as I figured out what happened. They found the body of the young guy, and they have a lead on the suspect. He has people too, he’s going to handle the rest of the case.
It looks like he really does want me around to keep an eye on things. I guess I’m one of the ones that he trusts. I wish he would have told me that he was going to do this. Especially the phone thing. I thought he wanted me solving the case, taking care of his brother that way. Maybe he didn’t want me dividing my time anymore. I can only guess that his biggest priority is Sherlock, and I am integral somehow to the roadmap he has planned out.
My body is sending me new signals.  Immobility is one of the primary ones.  What doesn’t hurt, I am uncertain if I can move at all.
It was nearly full of observations in his messy, spidery scrawl, many of them were in some kind of shorthand, but I was to able to decipher the general idea.
It isn’t until I am already driving that I realize I’ve been heading in the direction of the hospital.
“So we’re going to have to go to the restaurant in the hopes of there being an estate agent in the dining room so we can make sure we catch them being poisoned and prevent them from being murdered?”  John asked, perplexed.
Our parents are on their flight back to the UK. They arrive this evening. I will instruct them to get settled into the hotel and come in the morning. Delay them just a bit longer. I want Dr. Korhonen to come up with some answers for them.
It got more and more familiar as it went through, from just knowing each other as flatmates, to becoming friends, to becoming more than friends.
Sorry this one took so long.  I accidentally deleted it when I was working on it.  Everyone remember to always back up your work!
There were case notes in here, too. Little bits of details that were enough to remind me of a blog post I wrote up. Many of the notes were mostly about the specific things I did to help solve the cases. Even in shorthand scribbles, he made me sound indispensable to his work.
Because it goes back to the original problem. When things changed, and I had to leave. I messed up something that was turning into a big deal for him, and it was enough to change how he felt.
I’m not always an idiot. I could see the grooves on the next page from where he had written. I took a pencil and rubbed over the impression. It was just a few words.
He’s in a bad way. He isn’t conscious of anything but he moved his finger that one time, so doctors are hopeful he will wake up. I know he had some major surgery for internal injuries.
I go in to talk to John. Not sure what I can say, It has been two days and all we’ve gotten was a flutter of a finger. Then nothing.
“What did you mean, that wasn’t what happened last night?” John demanded, sitting upright.  Sherlock stretched, covering his eyes with his arm.  John frowned.  “What is this, some sort of game?”
I sent Mycroft home. He had put in a lot of hours, and he had to prepare for his parents showing up tomorrow. He looked pained to actually leave. I don’t know how many times he must have seen Sherlock in a bed like this, but this has to be the worst. The thing is, you never get used to it, seeing a loved one in this shape. Any shape except perfect, really. With how much Mycroft really is obsessed with Sherlock’s wellbeing, this must be torture.
I try to push past and get off the bus myself, making it out into the rain. Umbrellas were everywhere, I don’t see the woman with the orange scarf.
Never exactly knew how to tell her about Sherlock and John getting together. Not that I know about any details, I just don’t want her holding a torch for him like that if he can’t reciprocate.  She should move on. I feel bad for her and she doesn’t deserve it.
But he has a way of hurting me, even when unconscious and broken. He picks at the parts of me that are insecure and uncertain, then unravels them.
Of course he is an embarrassment and an annoyance. He is a man-child and throws temper tantrums,  He refused to be medicated for his possible bipolar disorder, nor his anxiety. He wants the world to be fascinating and wants to play the genius.
Mycroft’s assistant is at the car, waiting. Something must be happening. She doesn’t tell me anything though. I hand her the bundle from Mrs. Hudson, keeping the food for myself to eat on the way there.
“Sherlock, we will have you out as soon as we can. I am going to need you to stay with me, alright?”
I see Mycroft as the only one who could understand Sherlock growing up, so he was burdened with dealing with him in his adult life. This is partly a self-imposed burden.
I am always on the back foot. I’m the idiot. The bumbling fool that says the stupid thing so he can sound more brilliant.
And I see one little oversight, a little mistake and I overreact. I am tired. I am starving. I want everything to be back to normal.
I am being beckoned into Sherlock’s room. John still isn't back, but they want to deliver their news now, so we begin without him. There are three doctors and a nurse who have been on Sherlock's team since he was brought in, but all I care about are Dr. Korhonen’s findings.
I know I am probably overreacting. There are so many other things that are really going on in my mind. Things that I am trying to suppress, things I don’t want to even consider.
I am no stranger to blood. I have seen a considerable amount before. I have seen my own before. But this is different. They all stop clearing the debris and watch John. He looks so hollow, so shaken.
I’m an idiot. He always says I am, and most of the time it is true. I didn’t answer my phone. I wasn’t ready. This is my fault.
“I suppose you’re right,” he said, then cleared his throat.  He reached for his discarded clothes.  “I think I will have to leave for a bit.  Stay with my sister until we can sort things out.”  He sat up holding his trousers.
I think about John again. It is hard not to keep thinking about him. I expect I would have done things differently with him as well, if I had the opportunity to try again. I have a lot of remorse with the way things ended up. I am not good with things like this. I never had much in the way of friends growing up. It was easier not to. When it came to making friends in adulthood, I again chose the easier path and didn’t bother.
“He’ll pull through, you know,” came a voice next to me. I didn’t even know Lestrade was here. He probably brought the sugary coffee. He got my regular order mixed up with…
A lot is going on in my head. Lots to consider. Mostly trying to find out where all the guilt I feel really needs to be. This book had confused things a bit. Good to know that he was comfortable in the expanding of our friendship. But I feel terrible for assuming he was lying. For assuming he was trying to trick me and manipulate me when he was just trying to find his own way through his own feelings.
They let me read his chart. Apparently Mycroft put me on a list that gave me privileges like that. To be honest, it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Well, it is still entirely awful, still fully frightening, still unacceptable.
Next message was from Mycroft, (or more likely one of his staff), looks like they tracked John down a few hours ago and they are going to bring him back soon. That’s good. Glad he’s safe. Wonder what that was all about.
This makes me laugh for some reason. ’Spectacularly ignorant about own limbs’ is what comes to mind.
Sherlock was jerking wildly now and pulling at his cock with valiant if awkward effort. He was also trying to keep himself upright, though he wobbled dangerously on the mattress and seemed to be paying less attention than he had been earlier.
Sherlock pouted as he was handed the pack of frozen peas. Before he could attempt any other bit of ghastly first aid, they were grabbed off him by his brother, who held them tenderly to his thankfully no-longer-bleeding nose.
“Still in bed, lazy bastards,” said Greg. “Go and get ‘em. I’ll put madam in the cot while the going’s good.” He headed for the small utility room they’d decorated up as the baby bedroom, wheeling the buggy carefully to try and sneak the change of environment past the sleeping occupant.
century, Gregory,” intervened Mycroft. But he broke off, seeing that perhaps the explanation was not particularly interesting or welcome at this point. “Never mind.”
Mycroft was regarding Gregory with awe. “Oh, what a marvellous notion. I've never thought of that before. You are quite ingenious, my love.”
“For the following unarguable reasons,” he said as he paced, ticking facts off on his fingers. “You have a very stiff back, Captain Watson. Very poor flexibility in your spine, particularly around the thoracic vertebrae. T11 and T12 are, in medical terms, buggered. Your lumbar region is also distinctly dodgy. L1, for example. Practically fused.”
“Me?! I amb a bictim of this bebacle!” protested Mycroft, irritated that his pronunciation was so woefully compromised. It was all most undignified.
“I told you it wouldn’t work,” interrupted Sherlock, matter-of-factly. “What?! Don’t look at me like that. I advised against this whole thing, and I was correct do to so! T11 and T12!”
Sherlock had been uncooperative – far too tired to suck John back to sleep before sunrise. The current case was exhausting. He’d merely grumbled and rolled over. But he had sprung out of bed two hours later with a head full of ideas, dashing out to note them down while they were still fresh, leaving John in bed, horny and irritable.
“Hurry up, Watson! Please!” he whined with impatience. Time to move things on. Encouragement was needed, so took it upon himself to reach down and press the backs of his lover’s muscular thighs inwards.
There’s another silence. Jack coughs. Sherlock swallows, ignoring the goose bumps all over his body, the way the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He can’t breathe.
He cleans up the mess the best he can. When the baby cries, he turns on the TV to full volume and shoves the boy in the wardrobe.
Sherlock yawns as Mycroft helps him over to his bed, his body stiff from a lack of movement. He shuffles over and falls onto it awkwardly. “I never want to see Mummy and Father again.”
"Well, that explains why he refused to sit down throughout a three hour conference this morning." mutters a woman's voice.
John wonders how Sherlock can possibly be thinking about experiments at a time like this, but then he decides that, hey this is Sherlock, he’ll just have to learn to live with the quirks in and out of the bedroom.
Jack stands before his uncle, sword in hand, and pirate hat down to his nose. Mycroft stares, shock etched upon his face, eyes fixed on the small boy and his younger brother's hat. Sherlock wonders if he might break.
As he waits for their nightly visit, he mulls aver what Jack said that evening. Like him, Jack has no problem with death, but he doesn’t know how small Room truly is. If he grows to be as tall as Sherlock, then they’ll struggle. And Jack will only want to know more as he gets bigger. But one day They’ll consider him old enough to be a threat and the rules that apply to Sherlock will apply to Jack too. How long before they’re both chained up?
Sherlock can now see every flicker of John’s eyelids, the way his lips part as he pants loudly, the only sounds in the room are John’s breathing and the sucking sounds Sherlock is making as he brings him closer and closer to the edge. The smell of sex is heavy and strong in the air.
John takes a moment to recompose himself. He takes a few deep breaths to calm himself, so as not to scare Jack or Sherlock. Little did he or Mycroft know that the man in question had been standing in the corridor heading towards his bedroom, listening to every word they said.
He hands the driver the thirty quid he told them it will cost and hopes he might get some change back. The man counts it quickly. "That'll be an extra twenty please."
He reassures Jack that his dead siblings would never be jealous of him, nor that they would be angry at his chance of living. Telling Jack he wants it all to end, he hopes that somehow his small perceptive child might realise something is wrong. No such luck.
The last time he saw Greg was five days ago, right before the other man's week off. He doesn't look like he's shaved since. As if to prove the terrifying theory formulating in his mind, Lestrade, eyes now on Sherlock's quaking form, turns his head towards Mycroft and says
The man straightens. "Doctor Watson. In spite of the fact that you have incapacitated my brother and held my fiancé at gunpoint, I have complete faith in you."
“I’m afraid Jack isn’t available this evening. Or any other evening for that matter.” His heart pounds in his chest.
John shouts from the kitchen. “Don’t you even think about considering it! He’s your nephew, a child! A CHILD!”
I tell him what uncle Mycroft told me. He sighs. “Don’t worry, Lestrade is doing the right thing. Besides, if he doesn’t come back, he’ll have to eat seals with his ex-wife.”
As he speaks, the slur starts to fade, as if the thought of having something to do is giving him drive. John knows how important that is. These Holmes boys are his motivation to live. “He sits in the chair, doesn’t answer when spoken to. Seems sad, almost depressed… erm, said a criminal was giving him grief. Misses Greg.”
The mere mention of his military career had John standing and drawing himself to full height, mainly out of nervousness and self-defense.
He narrated as he performed the act he was most proud of having perfected as a teenager. He thrust his hips and bottom up into the air, letting his lanky legs drop easily over his head so that his feet landed neatly on the pillows behind. He exhaled in one smooth breath, and efficiently folded himself inwards, his swanlike neck extended and his sensual mouth agape. His long prick slipped effortlessly between his babydoll lips, and he suckled on it, moaning as he turned himself on.
It had been over a year, the two of us living together. I realized when I read that chart that I hardly know anything about him. I mean, fuck! I know so little. Not where he went to school, not his middle name or birthday, not if he preferred the Beatles or the Stones. Nothing.
I sigh and throw the rest of my naan in the foil container. I had better get to work, check on Donovan. Make sure everything is going well.
I used to ride horses as a boy. I am quite good with a horse. We used to ride at a nearby stables. Mycroft and me. I favoured a pony called Dutchman. Mycroft always took out Falstaff. I remember the time we went out and Falstaff was spooked by some birds. Mycroft, probably sixteen at the time, was thrown and landed on the trail unconscious. I had to ride ahead alone to find some help. I found some trail riders not far ahead and had them help me. Mycroft was taken to hospital and required some stitches and bed rest for a heavy concussion. But as a child, seeing my brother lay there unconscious like that, it was the first time I had imagined death. How easy it is. I had been scared at the time, crying and afraid in my mother’s arms, but when all was settled it was fascinating. So meaningless and cruel.
Uncle Mycroft packs his computer away. “Firstly, this man is a Monster, different from the Monsters you knew, but similar and I would never ask you to face such cruelty. Secondly, surprising him is good, but if I have a child speak for me, he will not respect me. Thirdly, even if that did work, he wouldn’t be convinced by you anyway, since he would wonder why I picked a girl for the job.”
Jack is wrapped up in Rug. Sherlock screams over what is supposedly his son’s dead body. The Witch steps forward. “You let my son die?” she hisses.
“Not to seem rude, but asides from the sergeants at the crime scene...” He noted Sherlock's raised eyebrows. “Well okay, only Lestrade seemed to accept that your facts were true.”
He grieves, or at least he tries to grieve, but he feels like he feels like he’s crying for a lot more than his children. He's grieving for his own joke of a life. John stands nearby, trying to be a supportive presence. Sherlock can feel reality collapse around him.
The grey haired man tips his head back whimpering and John stares at the lax and aroused face of one DI Lestrade.
Mycroft has been visiting on a daily basis, having taken some leave for the first time in his career. John was a little alarmed by the elder brother when they first met, but mostly pissed by his arrogance. He has taken to bickering with Sherlock, which seems to have been their norm before the kidnapping, and Sherlock seems less like an empty shell when with Mycroft. John is relieved. As worried as he is about Jack, he knows that at the age of five, the little boy will be able to adapt and one day will struggle to remember those stressful times of his childhood. It's a long way away, but Mike is sure it will come.
Three cuts later, he drops the blade and allows himself to float. His eyes start to droop. Good. Good.
Sherlock makes a strangled noise at the back of his throat. He crawls over to Jack’s body and rolls him back up, his hands shaking. The intruders watch on silently.
Next morning, Jack stares at the bruises on his neck and arms. “Clumsy Old Pa,” he says. They laugh.
Mycroft can't stop it. He moves to the bin and throws up, all his hatred and misery trying to leave with it. A small hand rubs his back as his mother tries to comfort him. He wonders why Anthea would have told them to come. Perhaps she knew that visual proof of the ordeal would snap his parents out of their denial.
“I told Jack to find a ‘Somebody’, someone he judged safe and to stick with them no matter what.” He looks John in the eyes. “Jack chose you.”
“Oh, I know you’ve never either,” laughs the man, “but from what I’ve heard, it’s like learning to ride a bicycle. You spend weeks with injuries from falling off and the rest of your life enjoying the ride. Now. Take. Off. Your. Clothes.”
Jack sobs into John’s jumper. John grips him tighter and presses a kiss into his newly cut hair. “Get out, Mycroft.”
Sherlock is sat in the kitchen burning… something. John walks in beaming and being sure to have a spring in his step.
John's hand spasms and he grits his teeth. Sherlock's accelerated breathing frightens him more. "Is Jack okay?" he gasps, looking at the small boy he had been tickling just moments ago. Jack stares at him from behind Sherlock's armchair. "It's alright, Jack, it was an accident. It's okay, little pirate, you've got a good aim, that's all." He turns to Sherlock. "Your son will be excellent at fencing. When he's ready to meet new people you should definitely get him some more lessons. Bloody brilliant your son is."
John collapses against Sherlock’s chair, unable to wipe the blood of his face. “I’m sorry. I attacked your brother. He attacked me. My nose won’t stop bleeding. I just… I didn’t think. I started it.”
His has his back turned to Sherlock, and doesn’t see how the other man trembles. “If I were to go outside, all by myself, do you think I would cope?”
Someone is shouting his name behind him; it must be Old Magnussen. He's going to stop him from catching up with her, but he can't let
“We can’t have a dog, there’s not enough room… I mean space, there’s not enough space in Room for a dog. And I can’t just ask for things, Jack, because They always want something in return.”
And that’s when John finally gets it. He loves Sherlock. And maybe, just maybe, Sherlock feels something for him too. They’ve touched each other a lot since they’ve first met, simply because John had become, as Sherlock said, his eyes. But all these touches, which most people would consider to be sensual, had finally affected them.
They’ve taken William. He waits on his knees in front of the door, waits for Them to bring him back. When They return, his son is not with Them.
Mrs. Hudson rushed in at that moment, demanding to know what Sherlock had done this time round to upset Scotland Yard once more. She was gently shoved aside by a detective, who resembled John with his keen eyes and graying hair. He took no notice of the smaller man as he requested Sherlock's attention. Not that the man hadn't been quivering in delight for the past minute.
Sniffing, Sherlock fights to keep his eyes open. “I don’t want to die anymore. But I don’t know how to live… it’s so hard.”
Mycroft surprises everyone, including Lestrade who'd just removed his coat, by straightening and glaring at Jack down his nose. "Doctor Watson," he pratically sniffed, "Would you care to explain why you are housing enemies of the state?"
Sherlock squeezes his hand to the point where it almost hurts. They head over to the serving area. Sherlock picks up a tray, queues, gets to his turn and suddenly flees. John follows them and waits until father and son have caught their breath before attempting to queue up again. People stare. One woman starts to laugh, and Sherlock bows his head in shame. John's heart clenches. He never wants to see that look on Sherlock's face again. Realizing that this is obviously too difficult, he guides Sherlock back to their table and makes sure to topple the woman's chair as they pass. He takes the tray from Sherlock's hands as the man is too busy blinking back tears.
“But you said you’d teach me stuff and we need books for that. Please, Pa, you promised.” Implores Jack, undeterred.
"I understand..." Mycroft glances at his brother, who tenses. "I see. I see. Thank you, Detective Inspector. You have been most helpful. Yes. Thank Philip Anderson for me too." He hangs up. "I have to go. Thank you for a very insightful conversation, Jack. I will be back for more."
eat your share or God help me. It's quarter past one in the afternoon, we're on soft grass and I'm just rambling to myself. But you are safe, Sherlock, and I will not hurt you.”
Sherlock ignores the first question. “No, Jack, my parents never lived in Room. I wasn’t born here. Old Magnussen and the Witch brought me here when I was sixteen years old.”
“Oh!” exclaims John as he glances around. “I must have left it at Scotland Yard. I hadn’t even realized. But how did Jack know?”
Jack picks that moment to run into the kitchen, wearing an old pirate hat from Sherlock's childhood. It slips down past his eyes and it takes Sherlock a moment to realize that this is the one Mycroft gave him when Redbeard died. His son must have uncovered it in one of the boxes Mycroft and his goons had brought round when they first moved in.
He begins to map out Sherlock’s chest with his mouth while the man runs his hands through John’s hair and sighs happily, squirming when John reaches his nipples. John loves his chest hair, so fine and smooth to the touch. Everything feels amazing. He can only hope it’s the same for Sherlock, although judging from the noises he’s making, he must be doing a pretty good job.
“What? Of course not, it was me, all me.” John discovered that Sherlock isn't a brilliant liar. Especially when it concerns his ego. So he smiled to himself, satisfied and glad no one could see it.
“I worry when I know something is wrong but I don’t know what.” I try not to cry. “I don’t know what’s happening to Pa, so I’m worried. If I have to worry about the unknown bad scaring you, it’s going to scare me too. Don’t make me worry even more, uncle Mycroft.”
And Sherlock stares at his freed leg. A paramedic starts to unravel what’s left around his leg. His skin is red and puckered and covered in blisters. Everyone in the room winces. Lestrade puts his arms under Sherlock’s shoulders and helps him up. He sways on his feet and he stands mostly on one leg, leaning heavily on Lestrade. Everyone watches silently as they hobble their way to the door. Sherlock’s breathing accelerates as they approach it, dreading this to all be a hallucination and the door would suddenly shut before he could cross the threshold. But nothing happens. He’s suddenly in a corridor and he’s not too sure what to do. He suddenly has a strange urge to turn back.
Three others glance up and John freezes, his heart pounding. The remaining three lead his men away. No, please no.
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Doctor Watson, you will be rewarded for helping my brother. And you will stay or I will do everything in my power to ruin your life. Are you understanding me?”
Time stops. Sherlock has stopped breathing and so has John. There’s nothing else except them. Sherlock swallows and turns his head slightly. “Angelo,” he calls, voice scratchy and startled, “bill please.”
Don't forget to subscribe, more will come this Week. (I SWEAR) Jack threatened me with his sword. How about a mini pirate scene with Jack and his sword fighting Mycroft with his umbrella…?
The man swallows, frightened. A surge of adrenaline courses through John at the sight. He's never been in control before. He's never been so close to winning this scenario...
A long, sleek black tank pulls up and it's the weirdest thing John has ever seen. However he lowers his gun.
John's ears are ringing. He stares at Sherlock, who eventually smirks and John can't believe he didn't see through him in the first place.
Sherlock pulls him into a hug. William had died nearly ten years ago. He had had time to think and reflect and he knew, acknowledged that even if he had taken his meds, something else would have set her off. In the end, weeks afterwards, She had stood over him, crying asking why he kept making her do bad things. She was crazy. Still is.
“You’re exceptionally slow today, Sherlock.” Says Old Magnussen, undoing his belt. “Now be a good boy and take off your clothes, there’s a good chap.”
“Let’s put it this way. What do people put in vaults? Secrets. And where do people hide their deepest, darkest vault full of secrets? In the recesses of their minds. That’s where we are. We’re in Old Magnussen’s Mind Palace. That’s what he calls this place, to taunt me. We need to prepare ourselves. We need to get out of here.”
She eyes him critically and he remembers that she had Sherlock get her husband executed. "Well, dear, it's not polite to wake up the neighbourhood like that. Now, what did you do to yourself?" She potters over and tuts. "Now sit down and I'll make tea. Just this once mind. Not your housekeeper."
“Have you tried talking to him? You could tell him he’s being bad and that if he doesn’t stop, you’ll obliterit… oblitera… destroy him with your umbrella.”
He can just make out his brother’s reflection in the window where he stands behind him. The older Holmes speaks quietly. “Jack cut his hair because he wants you to know he is doing well. Your son is fine and coping as well as possible. He wanted you to have this, so that you stop worrying about him and focus solely on getting better.”
“NEVER TOUCH THIS! DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU ARE HER CHILD! THOSE ARE HER EYES! You’re here because She wants leverage and for that reason alone, I will never want you!
Sherlock withdrew his hand, looking only slightly apologetic. “Bullet wound,” he stated rather than questioned. John felt unnerved. How could he tell?
That didn’t reassure John in the slightest. But all thoughts fly out the window as Sherlock’s mouth closes around him. Stars are the only thing he can see, yet he’s aware of Sherlock’s hand on his face, reading his reactions and most likely shelving them away for a later viewing.
Sherlock sighs. "Yes, John, please don't be an idiot, you know Mycroft is the British government." He reaches past a flabbergasted John and fumbles with the handle. "Pay the driver, John, and do hurry up. Don't make me climb over you."
Unable to resist, he opens the envelope, and pulls it out, certain he already knows what it will say.
Mycroft ajusts his grip on his umbrella and takes a fighting stance. "On guard, pirate scum! Perhaps you would like me to go easy on you?"
is how you beat the Monsters. They lose by you learning not just how to survive but to live a normal life. As normal as it can be when you’re a Holmes, of course. Sleep tight, brother. I’ll be back soon.”
Sherlock laughs through his nose, smiling as if he’s holding back tears, but happy ones. “I love you too, John.”
Once John is topless, they press their chests together, gasping at the contact, enjoying the warmth, the way the line of hair running into Sherlock’s trousers feels against John’s stomach and how they can feel each other’s hearts pounding in their ribcages. John has never been so turned on by such simple skin contact.
Jack frowns harder, frustrated. "Making circles with his thumbs and tapping fingers like for a dog." he blurts and sits back on his heels, daring him to argue with his 'deductions'
Jack stares in wonder at the cake; his first birthday cake! Then disappointment grips him. “Where are the candles and lights?” he asks.
Sherlock swallows a few times to compensate for his inability to speak. “John.” he whimpers eventually.
It takes all of his energy to lift his head so he can reach out and grab Sherlock’s erection, which is now hard and leaking pre-cum. Sherlock stutters his name and crawls back up John’s body, leaving him on the brink of what will be a mind-blowing orgasm. But John almost doesn’t care, because Sherlock is smiling.
John barely notices, feeling as if he hasn't explained himself propoerly. Something's... off. "I probably should have worn it that day. If I had their sniper wouldn't have blown my shoulder." He focuses back on the man he holds at gunpoint. "One bullet and it's all over. If I wear it I'll be captured to save your men but instead I don't and I get shot and I'm sent home with tremors and a limp."
This baby is terrified of him. He’s turning into a monster. Was this her plan? To turn him into a cruel being like Her? He starts to shake. He just wanted the mind games to stop, and he’s neglected a child. Hell, shouting at a baby probably qualifies as child abuse. A baby who is now screaming at him like he was the devil himself. Sherlock falls to his knees. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”
Mycroft stares at the autopsy table, where both children’s remains are covered with sheets. They may be reconstructed skeletons, but he's glad he doesn’t have to see. "Strangled?"
"John, mate? I need you to take a deep breath and put the gun, okay, Can you check Sherlock's vitals for me? John..."
“Well dear, a good father plays with you, takes care of you, teaches you, feeds you… and most importantly loves you. Your Pa ticks all the criteria.”
Sherlock feels like the rug has been pulled out from under his feet. Had he misunderstood Mycroft’s use of the expression “personal feelings”. Because he liked John. A lot. But if John didn’t really like him…
“You're wonderful to Jack and that's what people do isn't it? Have sex when they owe you something? You've been so kind, it's only logical… ”
That night, the door opens and They come in. Jack sits up in Wardrobe and peeks through crack-in-the-door. He can see Old Magnussen’s face and the Wicked Witch’s back. He tries to understand what they are saying.
But that doesn’t matter. What matters is his plan. Drug Jack and continue to keep Their focus on himself. If he was wrong in his deductions, which was desirable yet inconceivable, then They won’t even think of Jack this evening and life can continue as normal. But that would be too good to be true. And he couldn’t risk drugging jack again. He has to get Their attention back on himself. There was no other option.
“I’m not saying you said it directly, but by saying that he needs to earn respect, he may have believed that you meant that he doesn’t already. People hear unintended messages sometimes. Especially if they’re already feeling vulnerable.”
Two figures, blindfolded, gagged and handcuffed are pulled out. Detective Lestrade jumps out after them.
John always wakes up filled with self-hatred and tears running down his cheeks. Every time, he’s relieved to see Sherlock strut into the kitchen, oblivious to John’s haunting nightmares and fear of losing Sherlock. John detests those dreams. He almost wants to hate Sherlock for being the source of the fear.
Doctors swarm towards them as they enter and Sherlock feels overwhelmed. Lestrade notices his discomfort and steps between them, trying to explain the situation. There’s a warm hand on Sherlock’s elbow. He looks at John, who gives him a small, reassuring smile.
Sherlock woke feeling like he'd been punched in the stomach. Gasping for breath, he tenses as the footsteps approach. Someone kneels opposite him but makes no attempt to touch him.
The three people opposite him squirm uncomfortably. Sigar Holmes clears his throat. “Yes, well, who named him Jack?”
John's hand trembles. Prince Charles has chickened out and abandonned him. The world swirls; the man before him raises both hands as if to tame a ferociuos predator. He suddenly has grey hair and kind eyes. Then it disappears again.
Old Magnussen isn’t easy to fool, which is why Jack being actually sick helps. He’s no doctor, but if he can convince Them that Jack has food poisoning and is at risk of Salmonella, They might agree to take him to the hospital. Once there, Jack can yell for help and then he’ll be safe.
Mycroft smiles slightly, a genuinely happy look which somehow doesn’t look out of place on his normally stoic face. “Let’s just say, someone has taught me that emotions aren’t always a hindrance. That sometimes, it can be… good to express an emotion, to avoid unwanted fallouts.” He looks up at him, open and honest. “But you already know that. You raised Jack to be smart, but not emotionally stunted. You are the best of us, brother mine.”
“I love you. Don’t forget that.” He grabs the edge of Rug and rolls his son up, just like they practiced. But then Jack starts to wriggle and tries to fight his way out.
“Sherlock,” he announces, “We should probably have sex. For my own health and safety, if not for yours.”
“Nonsense, dear, after everything that's happened you deserve a treat, especially little Jack.” she rummages through her bag and pulls out a bright red package. “Here you are, Jack. And this,” she pulls out a smaller one. “This is for you, Sherlock.”
Lestrade sighs. "I think we should all be talking to someone. Mycroft read my file and found out about my bitch of an ex-wife. Now her phone number has gone and she doesn't exist on any data base. All he told me is that her new neighbours are penguins."
“I won’t say those words.” I tell him, because I know the Somebody sometimes says things that will get me into trouble. But now uncle Mycroft is having a hard think about what I said and looks at me like I’m super interesting.
His breath hitches, his heart picks up. He’s more scared than he’s been since he was shot. His voice wobbles. “I meant it. Every word. If ever and whenever you’re ready.”
Sherlock is immediately suspicious. “I don't want to talk to the police or the lawyer, I'm not in the mood and I don't want to think about that right now.”
The baby sits next to the bed, a soft ball between his legs. William’s ball. The only toy Sherlock had been able to keep after They had taken all his belongings away.
The room goes awfully quiet. A high-pitched ringing makes itself known in his ears. Anthea stops typing and makes a quick call. "She sat on him and buried him alive?"
At breakfast, watching Sherlock feel his way around the kitchen and make himself and John a cup of tea. John congratulates himself on his foresight of removing the eyeballs from the teacups that Sherlock is currently putting teabags in. The way his hands run along the counters, down the fridge, across the pages of the books he loves to read, almost as if he’s smoothing creases out of the different surfaces. His hands are those of an artist’s and John loves admiring his fingers as they pluck the cords on his violin and the way he knows what he’s touching thanks to the pads of his fingers. He wonders what Sherlock’s face would look like if he were to suck on those long digits. Would his mouth fall open? Would he mutter nonsense and babble about how much he loves John? Would he…?
John stares at him blankly. Sherlock turns his head in his direction and raises an eyebrow. Then they both collapse, snickering at the absurdity that is Mycroft Holmes.
John grips his shoulder, giving him a reassuring smile. “Nothing to worry about. Besides, what are best friends for?”
His suspicions were confirmed, when the man in question picked up a box containing syringes and brushed his fingers over the braille for confirmation.
Screaming. Gunshots. Yelling. John collapses to his knees and covers his ears, trying to protect his head by hunching over. Tears drip from his eyes without his permission. The screaming intensifies until it's just a white noise. He pants a couple of breaths and risks looking up.
John is leaning over a coffee, black, no sugar, hospital brand and quite frankly disgusting. His elbows are resting on the table and he can't make eye contact with anyone in the room. Lestrade is taking notes. Mycroft is gripping his umbrella so tightly his knuckles are white. Only Sherlock is talking. Mike is watching him for any signs, but Sherlock is talking as fast as he can, blurting out words as fast as his brain and mouth will let him. He tells them everything from the beginning, the moment he first woke up aged just sixteen, naked and chained up, unable to move, with a gag in his mouth, his ears covered and blindfolded, only able to feel the hand and body of a woman who molested and raped him over and over again. How he was beaten every time he tried to speak. How for the first three months of his captivity, he was not allowed to talk, scream or make any vocal sounds at all. How he had deduced that she had lost a child as she would try to breast feed him when he behaved well. How he was forced to pleasure her, and she would rape him up to twenty times a day…
“Let’s get you back to your room, then you can sleep. Tonight, we’ll have another meal and tomorrow we can leave the hospital. You’ll still have regular visits from the doctors. Jack is going to see a proper child's psychiatrist.”
Mrs. Hudson comes in carrying my hot chocolate. I show her my book and ask. She tuts loudly. “This book only shows what some families look like. Some have adopted family members, or step-siblings or half-siblings. And some children have only one parent or two dads or two mums. And, should there ever be a case like you grandparents, well you just have to learn to make your own family. When someone treats you like they did, it’s best to find your family elsewhere, since they clearly aren’t worth your time.” She can see I’m confused. “Like your Pa for instance. He’s still got Mycroft and you. But he’s moved here. John is his family now.”
