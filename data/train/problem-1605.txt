Mycroft rang off and held his breath, his eye still on his phone. Why had he made that call to Lestrade? He took a deep breath and released it. He knew why. Doc Watson's threat to make an example of Lestrade in particular had shaken him more deeply than he'd thought possible. Mycroft generally avoided tuning in to his innermost feelings, but when he did so now - right now, at this very moment - he discovered an interest in a certain Detective Inspector that went beyond his objective usefulness. That interest had been awakened way back at their first meeting, and now that they were more or less working together all the time, it had deepened in a way that Mycroft hadn't reckoned with.
Suddenly, a blow landed on his face, and Sherlock gasped for breath in shock. The black spots and the peculiar lightness disappeared as rapidly as they'd come. He returned to his senses and smelled sweat, saw John's face over him, felt the pain in his cheek and arse, and that wonderful pressure deep inside him.
Greg turned away, suppressing a sigh. He'd certainly come a long way. Now even waiters were wrinkling their noses at him.
and a warm, happy feeling spread through his chest. The cigar and his longing for its precious smoke faded into the background.
,” Sherlock stated. “Which either means that you’ve lost your touch and are worthless when it comes to protecting John, or... it means that John wasn’t in danger.”
Mike almost felt he'd received confirmation of his suspicions when all that light, all the gentleness, all the mellifluence dropped away with astonishing speed and ease the moment Jacques left the office and the three of them were alone once more.
"Sherlock?!" Mike blurted out in horror. "SHERLOCK?! Oh my God... what happened? No, don't say anything... doesn't matter. Are you all right?"
Mike reached greedily for the almond biscuit on his saucer and stuffed it into his mouth before taking the first sip of his coffee, sighing contentedly. It had been a while since they'd had coffee together. They hadn't worked such long hours recently that they'd needed coffee to stay awake, or else they'd been out of the house. Mike eyed the biscuit on John's saucer with a covetous eye (Jacques was remarkably stingy with those biscuits), and then he noticed: the cup that Jacques brought to Sherlock didn't have a biscuit with it.
Miss Morstan stood up from behind her desk and reached out a hand toward him, apparently in a half-hearted attempt to stop him.
Moriarty looked abashed. "I needed money. To finance everything... Sebastian... Mary..." He nodded at the blonde woman. "All of that didn't come cheap."
John clicked his tongue in disapproval. "Still able to form complete sentences, and far too feisty for my taste. I'm going to have to do something about that... but first... if you're not able to control that greedy body of yours, I'm going to have to do it for you. And as luck would have it, I've come prepared for just such an eventuality," John declared cheerfully.
“Come here. Leave the plug in... kneel down in front of me.” John couldn't do much more than pant the words, but he didn't care.
While he was considering the puzzle Sherlock presented him, his gaze wandered slowly over Sherlock's nude form. After a short while, he realised that Sherlock enjoyed the visual inspection, as his previously soft penis began to fill with blood and stiffen, slowly but surely.
A heart-breaking sob sounded. Sherlock's erection twitched, and his entire abdomen trembled and spasmed. John could hardly believe his eyes when he saw a milky fluid oozing out of the tiny slit in Sherlock's glans, despite the fact that the sperm stopper was still lodged in his urethra, which should actually make such a thing impossible. The fluid – was it precome or was it ejaculate already? - dripped thickly onto Sherlock's quivering abdomen. Without giving it much thought, John grabbed Sherlock's testicles and pulled down hard.
"Tell me everything!" Sherlock demanded emphatically, and John laughed. It was nice to be home again.
Sherlock was no exception, in spite of everything else. Bitter with a trace of musk and oysters. John hated oysters. But Sherlock's utter abandon, his reactiveness and his enraptured cries and whimpers overshadowed all the unpleasantness. He moved his head up and down, all the while sucking lightly, ran his tongue around the swollen head and relished Sherlock's sharp exclamations of pleasure.
In his world, it was a good idea to keep one's feelings strictly separate from one's business dealings. He had to forget that fleeting, forlorn look in those beautiful, pale eyes. He'd come to the brothel for an evening's entertainment, not to find a new lover. And even if so – he'd never consider some whore for a position that demanded so much trust.
With a swirl of his coat, he strode out of Scotland Yard's interrogation room, not giving so much as a second thought to the suspect, who had collapsed on the table behind him, the glowing cigarillo still wedged between his trembling fingers. The case was closed. The murderer apprehended. The mystery solved. Everything else was irrelevant.
“Your tax advisor is a duffer.” Sherlock greeted Irene with the devastating news one morning when she entered her office, only to find to her surprise that Sherlock was already sitting at her desk, which was full of binders, invoices, and account statements.
Once again, Sherlock swallowed with difficulty and lifted his eyes a bit higher until he reached John's face. John nodded tersely, satisfied.
When John sat down on the couch, Sherlock nestled up against his legs with a small, contented sound. It wasn't desire that surged through John this time - it was another emotion, and it threatened to overpower him.
Cooper ground his cigarette out under his heel. "And here I wanted to take my girl for a holiday in the Caribbean... can forget it now without the side lines. Moran was something else. He could've pulled the cart out of the ditch Doc drove it into."
Sherlock hadn't taken his eyes off John for a second. His forehead was slightly creased in a pensive expression.
"I love your cock, you know. It’s…it’s perfect. And...I love you, too. You’re perfect too. I just…hope you know that.”
Sherlock gave him a derisive look. "It astounds me every time that you are so deeply invested in returning me to the heart and hearth of the Holmes clan - you, who never wanted me to be a member of such an illustrious family in the first place."
Sherlock opened his eyes then and looked directly at John. John forgot to breathe. Utter peace, utter devotion spoke to him in those eyes. Although he'd never seen it before, John suspected what was going on... Sherlock wasn't ready to return to reality yet; he wanted to enjoy the echoes of that exceptional experience a little longer, wanted to spend a little more time in that other world he'd apparently drifted off to.
The client wasn't unknown around Irene's brothel, but Sherlock had never been requested by him before. But Romero – the boy who the client usually asked for – didn't work for Irene any more, so Sherlock had been offered, and the client agreed.
He collapsed on top of Sherlock and lay there over him, hot and heavy. His shirt, which he hadn't taken off, was wet with sweat and stuck to him, smearing Sherlock's semen across his stomach.
The statement became his mantra over the next two hours, but it didn't really help. Something terrible must have happened, or Mike wouldn't have sounded the way he had on the phone just now. Sherlock had hardly ever seen Mike be anything but sanguine, and if anything did ever shake him up, it was either something funny or else Mike reacted assertively. But during his call he'd sounded unsettled, as if he weren't able to completely judge the magnitude of whatever it was - and that was extremely alarming. A Mike who wasn't completely in control of the situation and didn't know everything that was going on? A highly unpleasant thought.
"There aren't many of them," Holmes continued. "They're only being partially deployed at first. According to my information they're currently the best the market has to offer."
"You're not just putting on a show, are you? You really like the riding crop, if I'm not entirely mistaken," John said with wonder laced with a trace of satisfaction. "This really turns you on."
"But how..." he began, before his expression lightened suddenly. "Oh, of course. Prostate massage! How stupid of me," he cried mildly, until a new – even more disturbing – thought occurred to him. "You did that on purpose," he remarked with quiet admiration.
“I lived on the street, John. I used drugs in order to be able to stand it, and I sucked anyone and anything that was put in my mouth to pay for my habit. I'd hit rock bottom.” He paused, bit his lower lip again, and then continued, a bit softer: “And I didn't care. I wouldn't have survived the next winter... I didn't care about that either. And then... then Irene found me and took me in. She... saved me. As clichéd as that might sound.” Sherlock crumpled John's handkerchief between his fingers, then smoothed it out on his thigh, only to crumple it up again.
Sherlock opened the bottle and took a whiff. He wasn't an aficionado like John, but the scents of pineapple, orange, vanilla and cinnamon stood out even to a lay nose like his. He took a small, careful sip directly from the bottle. The flavours of vanilla and orange were once again clearly defined. It wasn't exactly the kind of thing Sherlock liked, and the whisky was too strong for him - but the alcohol warmed him and went to his head just a bit. Sherlock lay back down on the bed and ended up being able to doze a little, putting aside for the moment all the problems that were still waiting for him.
Before Irene - her sceptical look speaking volumes - could say anything more, Jacques returned with a tray on which two coffee cups were perched. Sherlock's eyebrows were about to shoot up, but he clamped down on that reaction as well. He hadn't actually thought they were going to be getting any coffee by this point. He was therefore willing to overlook the fact that Jacques hadn't knocked this time either. Irene - who was clearly used to giving orders - instructed the butler as to her wishes (
The scent of tobacco hadn't completely dissipated, and the smell of cold smoke mixed with a hint of leather, soil, and spicy cocoa still hung suspended in the air. Following a spur-of-the-moment impulse, Sherlock went to one of the windows and flung it open wide. The cool, sweet night air gently caressed his bare skin. He stood there in front of the open window, breathing in the pure night air, filling his lungs and enjoying its freshness.
Irene had to surrender in the face of that statement. It was no longer possible to warn Sherlock what was coming. And for that reason, she really didn't want to get into an argument with the mob boss. She told him the way to Sherlock's apartment, and he thanked her.
touch. The mere thought of what he did to me... It's enough to arouse me. It's horrendous! I could climb the walls. It's driving me mad and there's absolutely nothing I can do." Sherlock ruffled his hair in exasperation.
"Three strokes," John said roughly. "Three times, Sherlock. Did you hear me? Then you can do whatever you want with your hands and your legs... but during those three strokes, you need to keep still. Completely still. Have you understood?"
"Sherlock... don't fall asleep," Jason murmured, punching him lightly in the shoulder. "The old windbag pays too well for me to give him up as a client."
Sherlock remained unimpressed by John's choice of coarse language, and not at all embarrassed. He was still trying to understand why John wanted to leave without taking his virginity – in direct opposition to every agreement that had been made.
With a fiendish grin that promised nothing good was about to happen, John set about satisfying Sherlock's curiosity.
John rolled his eyes but managed not to say anything. Having to get the last word in must have been another family trait. He sat down on the couch again, and the two men enjoyed the intense aroma of dried fruits and the flavour of the first mouthful in silence as the delicate notes of vanilla and chocolate slowly revealed themselves on their tongues.
The prospect of escaping the moist and foggy weather that hung over London in November, and changing it for a milder climate – if only for a day – was so tempting that John had followed Sherlock into the night without question. Just like he always did.
As soon as he closed the door to his house behind him, John took off his coat and laid it across the upholstered chair beside the door, just like he always did. Someone would take care of putting it in the closet where it belonged. What did he have house staff for, after all? Well schooled and expensive staff. Staff who didn't stand around and get in his way, and only came out when they were summoned.
"No," Sherlock contradicted him stubbornly. "You haven't answered that many times. Only twenty-seven."
Although John hadn't been here in months, he was greeted with exemplary courtesy and led into the grand lounge on the ground floor.
Mycroft had given him the most perfidious present possible. His accursed brother must have known he wouldn't be able to put an end to his suffering; that he would, instead, prolong his own agony day after day with an all but masochistic pleasure.
Mycroft shook his head with a thin, appreciative smile. "I'm not so stupid as to make another attempt at tempting you with money."
Sherlock gasped for breath. Although he'd already made his decision, it was difficult ... unspeakably difficult. But John was holding his legs for him, even though it must be painful, and Sherlock didn't know what else to offer in return for the gesture other than ... his pride.
John knew it was the truth. The simple, unvarnished truth. Still, his guilty conscience wouldn't let him go that easily, and he stuck to his position.
"Easy..." John said, enjoying himself. "I'm going to get that fire in your arse going again." When the only response was more breathing, John asked, "Where are you right now?"
Sherlock bit his lower lip briefly before meeting John's searching eyes, even if he did so a bit evasively.
Sherlock's ardent moans were muffled by the mattress even as his legs spread further apart as if of their own accord.
"How old are you?" John wanted to satisfy his curiosity regarding the prostitute's true age – as well as seeing how close he was with his own guess.
"Sherlock... I … can't hold on much longer... how soon...?" John panted, and a fresh wave of arousal rolled through his groin.
It was a game between them, one that an outsider would have found cruel and unnecessary, but it titillated and engaged both of them.
He savoured those words in his mind a little longer, wondering whether they had always been true and he'd never seen it, or whether it was his feelings for John that made him glow.
"You can come any time," John said softly before ghosting a kiss onto Sherlock's moist glans, opening his lips, and taking the tip of his stiff penis into his mouth. It was the second time he'd done this for Sherlock. But the situation was different today. The other time, it had been just one part of the torment, one part of the ecstasy.
"What're you yammering about all of a sudden?" Franco asked. "Sigerson's not the first floozy he had with him."
John tugged on the tie and adjusted it here and there. "There," he said after a while, sounding satisfied.
John closed his eyes and ran his tongue across his lips. When he opened his eyes again, he said with a dangerous smile: "You forgot the magic word. You need to learn how to say '
"But you have given it a good shot," John conceded. "Maybe you could do with a little positive reinforcement..." No sooner had John spoken the last word than Sherlock felt a hand wrap around his hard flesh. He sobbed with relief. "Shhh..." John said, stroking Sherlock's back with one hand in a calming gesture. "It's all right..." he murmured softly. "Everything's all right..." Then Sherlock heard the typical sound of a zipper being opened, and his mouth began to water.
I will write more about it once I'm back at home. Currently I'm still in London. Just this: it was an unforgettable evening. The stage design was beautiful. Hamlet's mother was very impressive and BC gave everything. Stage Door was a little bit disappointing - no autograph for me but I managed a few nice pictures of him. I've posted them already on my tumblr. (#london2015 #hamlet)
Sherlock got off his knees and tilted his head to the side, which made him look – despite his size – like an excited child standing before a Christmas tree. His eyes, however, still harboured a strange, sober expression.
She took the phone out of her pocket and opened the message she'd just received. She stared for several minutes at the photo of Charlie White that one of her occasional johns had sent her.
"Is there at least anything new about the number we found on that bastard Graves?" It was clear how difficult it was for John to control his temper.
- the piece that now stood on his music stand - did pose a neat little challenge for him, but it was a challenge he'd always excelled at mastering.
Two frantic breaths later, John began to fuck his cock with the sound. A slow, almost leisurely up and down, coupled with little twists that practically drove Sherlock mad. His heart thudded in his chest, his blood rushed through his veins, and something... was building up... becoming stronger with every thrust, with every pull... Sherlock groaned and John stopped.
"Hmmm yessss..." Sherlock sighed, bent his head back and stretched his entire body in a luxuriant, sensuous move.
“You want me to... continue?” John was uneasy. Sherlock was crying. It didn’t matter that his cock was hard, that he was aroused. He was still crying and that…that wasn’t right.
," Sherlock pointed out as a means of making it clear he was unwilling to answer Mycroft's question regarding his motivations.
"Don't you dare!" Mike exclaimed, but his mouth had pulled into a grin as well. "Sorry I questioned your masculinity for even a second."
Greg's words had now confirmed to him that he'd retain the upper hand - Greg had all but presented it to him on a silver tray by admitting he couldn't stand to be away from him one moment longer.
John mustered Moran with renewed interest. "Oh yeah - I know him. We used him in Southwark already. Albright took him under his wing. How's he doing?"
Mike was the first to speak. "Sherlock's right. It won't help the situation any for us to scream at each other."
John exhaled. "Good," he said, nodding. He seemed relieved yet not completely satisfied. But it appeared to be enough for the moment.
“For the same reason I was living on the streets, and the same reason I can't come with you,” Sherlock answered dully.
"Doesn't matter. Pee. Now. I have to see if there's any blood in your urine, and I can only do that if you pee into the sink here. Now do it."
"Of course... but he preferred to keep mum on that score," Mycroft replied. "Not only that - he lied to me when I inquired further."
Sherlock was in danger, and he had no way to get him back out... the net that had descended on them unseen was too tightly woven. There was no way... other than to do what had been demanded and go there all on his own.
Mike lifted his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Fine – have it your way. I'll just make the impossible possible once again, shall I? You'll see what happens. You're not going to listen to me. But … when things do go belly-up with this Sherlock … can I at least say
“Oh God yes...” Sherlock whispered hoarsely. John's semen. He was going to taste John's semen! His arms flung themselves automatically around John's neck, and he pressed a stormy kiss to John's narrow lips, which John returned tentatively until he was able to free his mouth and nudge Sherlock back a bit.
"Aw... now I'm a teensy bit disappointed... Jim! Jim Moriarty! Doesn't ring a bell at all? Admittedly, I did try hard to stay out of sight, but..."
First and foremost, I'd like to thank the cuddliest husband ever, who suggested that I look for a reservoir to use as the site of the final showdown, and who even found the pictures for me. Not only that, he put up with my moods when I wrote myself into yet another corner on the fourth draft of this chapter. He even commiserated with me once in a while. So a special thank-you to him - my very own personal 'conductor of light'.
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed. He sat up and rubbed his eyes then moved his head from side to side, wincing.
During the two calls, he'd spoken with icy, hard-nosed precision, but when he knelt down beside Sherlock now, his expression changed completely and his voice became gentle. "See you in a bit," he said in a low voice.
Sherlock swallowed hard. Why was his throat so dry while his eyes threatened to overflow? He raised his head slowly and hesitantly until he was looking at the collar of John's black polo neck.
John swatted him on the rear and got out of the shower. "Finish up in there and wash your hair while you're at it. The tobacco smell really gets trapped in there," he advised, wrapping a towel around his hips.
“You... don't you dare start crying!” John yelled, agitated. “Look at me when I talk to you. Look at me and tell me – to my face! - tell me you don't want to come with me.” John couldn't have handled tears right now … his self-control was hanging by a thread as it was. If he saw tears running down Sherlock's cheeks on top of everything else, he'd jump on him and rip every shred of clothing off his body. Why the hell did tears have to have such an arousing effect on him?
Maybe he should come clean and tell John the truth. It was almost physically painful for him to lie to John. He didn't feel good about it at all. Little half-truths were fine - and it was easy for him to omit something entirely too... but to flat out lie when posed a direct question? That was both difficult and extremely ungrateful on his part. After everything that John had done for him already, after all the compromises he'd made for him. Sherlock was deeply ashamed. But there was simply no reasonable alternative.
"Ah, yeah - all right. Fine, it's not much - but thanks for trying." Mike pushed a button to end the call.
Sherlock's fingers clutched the edge of the table so hard that his knuckles stood out, white, but he managed a weak nod and tried to hold still.
Twenty minutes later, John slid three fingers into Sherlock's relaxed yet still sufficiently narrow opening, only to immediately pull them back a bit again. The rhythm and depth of the thrusts with his fingers were paving the way for another part of his anatomy that John intended to implement that evening. Just like the last time, Sherlock showed himself to be highly receptive to John's stimulation. His entire body was trembling, and his erect penis dripped continual, clear drops of pre-come.
interest in you NOT taking an interest in him. I imagine you might find ways of convincing your colleagues in the organised crime command of the same thing."
"That's not what I mean!" Susan cried angrily. "I visited Sherlock at the hospital earlier today. I'd baked some bread and made the poor boy a few sandwiches with it. The food there is nothing short of catastrophic, you could really have put him somewhere where they have better cooks, but that's not the point. The point is that he cried his eyes out to me over how poorly you're treating him."
"I've no idea what he's doing here or how he got in here," John replied grimly. "But it's a bloody good thing he did, or we'd never have caught on to them. What am I paying that army of accountants for anyway? Can you tell me that?"
"For who else?" John retorted. "Of course for you, you idiot," he scolded affectionately, taking some longish papers out of the breast pocket of his jacket. He held them out to Sherlock, who eyed them eagerly.
And maybe... possibly... given the right circumstances... I might one day let myself be seduced into writing a one-shot or two for this story.
"So there'll be chilled cucumber soup tonight. He'll like that too," Mabel declared with cheery satisfaction.
"The real books are upstairs … you can read whatever you like from there," John told him. "But in here... there's nothing for you in here."
"John," Sherlock said stupidly. He'd completely forgotten that John wanted to come by. And now he was here. Of course right at the most inopportune moment. Disoriented and caught off-balance, Sherlock thrust the letter at John without so much as a word of explanation.
"Fine - you can keep him, as far as I'm concerned. Under two conditions." Mycroft stepped away from the window and took a seat on the couch, making sure to straighten the crease of his trousers over his knees with great care.
“My... my little... my little willy... makes... it makes... w-wee-wee,” Sherlock stuttered with difficulty, stumbling over the words even while his legs trembling, cock swelling a little bit more. Inexplicably, there were also tears in his eyes which hadn’t gone past John’s notice and he reached for Sherlock, tenderly wiping the moisture away.
"Oh God," Sherlock murmured hoarsely. "Ohgodohgodohgod..." Sensation returned to his body, but he wasn't ready for it yet. He wanted to spend a little while longer in that blissful, detached state, to rest in that quiet, sensual Nirvana, but the hands on his arse, his thigh, and his back called him irrevocably back to reality.
"Yes, please," Sherlock pleaded with feeling, and before John could think twice about what he was doing or why now, for the first time in his life, he felt the need to do anything like it, he sank down onto his knees behind Sherlock's spread legs and pressed his mouth against the pre-stretched ring of muscle.
was disgusting - especially in this state. Sweaty, sticky, his penis still obscenely swollen and red, his skin pasty... what was going on?
John frowned briefly, then said, "Then nothing." He shrugged. "Most of those blokes are married and would rather eat glass than get drawn into a scandal. And if anyone does recognise you, that just gives me the opportunity to show you off a bit. They'll be green with envy that I've got you all to myself. That's it."
"I think you've had enough," John declared, gave the buttocks in his lap one last pat, and placed one hand on Sherlock's shoulder. "Get up – you're getting too heavy. My legs are falling asleep."
"Shame," John said. "Would have saved me quite a bit of trouble if he'd bit it. But you can't have everything."
Right about at the same time as Sherlock followed John into the office, Jim Moriarty was asking himself why the mayor and the crimelord weren't tearing each other apart yet... and why Scotland Yard - under the aegis of that incompetent idiot Dimmock - was instead looking for him with dogged determination.
"I don't believe it!" John shouted, incensed. "I simply cannot believe it! That goddamned bastard! I'm going to kill him! He's fucked me over for the last time!"
"Then that makes me the idiot..." John said softly. "Sherlock... you don't need to have sex with me every day... you..." He reached for Sherlock's hands and held them firmly in his. "How often do I have to tell you I'd be lost without you? No matter what the situation... If you want sex, that's fine... but it's not your duty." John stroked the back of Sherlock's hand with his thumb. "Sometimes it's enough for you just to be here."
But no sooner had he returned to the kitchen than a loud moan shattered the heavenly silence, and Jacques' face contorted in a pained grimace.
"Yes - bring it in as soon as it's ready," John said, and Jacques retreated, leaving the two men alone once again.
Adrenaline raced through John's body, and everything around him slowed. As if he were viewing the scene on time lapse, John noted how astonished and dismayed Mary and Moriarty were at this turn of events. John aimed mercilessly at Sherlock's chest. When he pulled the trigger, his wrist jerked.
“You were... you wanted to...” John murmured in shock, staring at Sherlock for several seconds with his mouth hanging open. Then he barked out a short, indignant laugh. “You are really something else.” He shook his head before turning sombre again. “Why did you stay here? I mean, if she didn't have anything to hold over you, why are you still here? Why?”
John grinned. "That was quick," he remarked dryly. "And now you can..." He stopped short. "Are you wanking already?"
When John received the information, Mike and he decided to put some more pressure on Barbie and his men, but no sooner had John slipped on his jacket than he got word that Barbie and four of his confederates had been found in an empty warehouse on the Thames, each killed by a shot to the head.
Without so much as hesitating or even giving it a second thought, Sherlock opened his mouth, readily extended his tongue toward the proffered cigar, and waited. Was John really going to let him taste this delicacy, at least in this manner? Or would he be cruel enough to pull it away at the last second? Before Sherlock could worry too much about the scenario, John touched his tongue with the cigar, and the connection to Sherlock's brain was interrupted for the time being. Sherlock moved his tongue over the cap of the cigar with something bordering on reverence, licked his own, faintly musky precome from the wrapper, carefully moistening it with his own saliva, letting his tongue slide across it until it started to become a loving caress. His eyes closed of their own accord, the taste of tobacco began to blossom on his tongue. A hint of cedar, vanilla, leather, and a certain delectable bitterness...
For with that single innocent kiss from those normally so sinful lips, Sherlock had succeeded in stealing John's heart.
"He didn't mention it specifically..." When she saw the corners of Sherlock's mouth turn down and his brow cloud over, she went on hastily: "I'm sure he just forgot and must have assumed..."
"You don't know organised crime too well, do you?" John asked with wan amusement. "If I hadn't sold our deal to my people as evidence of my success, you wouldn't be able to do much more than plant primroses on my grave right now."
"What kind of shit is that?" John whispered, his voice dangerously quiet. "I never said a word to you - so stop spouting lies right now!"
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders. "I prefer classical concerts, especially strings..." Sherlock broke off abruptly, although John was sure he'd wanted to say more. John was going to ask, but then Sherlock said with a light-hearted smile, "But opera's nice too." John then forgot all about his question when Sherlock began tossing the cushions from the couch onto the floor at John's feet.
"Oh my God, John!" Mike cried out in horror. "You killed him! This time you actually killed him!" He reached for the door to steady himself. His eyes were inexorably drawn to Sherlock's face, its deathly pallor emphasised by the frame of dark curls and the surreal red lips.
"Yeah... looks like they've really developed a soft spot for you. You're just going to have to live with it," John said with fake sympathy.
A wave of dark, disturbing shame rolled through his body, inflaming his senses, ensnaring his mind, paving the way for a impervious cloud of desperate, wanton lust that left him restless and whimpering.
Sighing loudly, Sherlock placed his folded hands in front of him on the table. "What do you think I mean?" he retorted. "Are there any rules I should follow? Should I go around wearing a plug? Are there any rituals I should perform? Should I sneak under your covers every morning at seven and give you a blowjob, or should I wait for you naked in the bath when you come home to wash your back? What?!" Sherlock became more and more agitated as he spoke, and at the last question he threw his hands convulsively in the air.
Sherlock swallowed. Going by the expression on John's face, the thunder wasn't past; it was simply arriving a bit later than expected. An uneasy feeling came over Sherlock, and he wondered what in the world he'd been thinking to break into John's office like that. He'd probably hoped it wouldn't be so bad. After all, John had been rather indulgent with him lately. Perhaps too indulgent. He hadn't done anything more than tease him about smoking in secret, even though he'd made it clear it was strictly forbidden back when Sherlock had moved in. Had that made Sherlock careless? Probably.
Sherlock's eyes widened in surprise, but he stood up, unbuttoned his shirt and took off his shoes. He stepped out from behind the desk, undid his trousers, and pulled them down together with his underwear. He started to bend down to take off his socks.
John threw his arms in the air in aggravation. "You're insane," he cried. "Even if he were, don't you think I'd have you out of there in no time?"
- London's City Hall, including the design, architecture, layout, and nickname amongst London's inhabitants, along with the views from the Lord Mayor's office
"Looks good as far as I can see," John declared with satisfaction. "I'll give you another suppository - but I think the cream will be enough tomorrow. A couple more days and you'll be as good as new." He carefully introduced the suppository into Sherlock's hole, pushing it a bit deeper with his finger. "There. Done." He gave Sherlock a light slap on one buttock and took off the latex glove. "You can turn over again. Should I get your blue pyjamas..."
Late in the morning of the following day, Sherlock tried once again to find a position on the chair at John's desk that was halfway tolerable.
Sherlock arched upwards... his entire body throbbed, seemed poised to explode, and then he screamed as John had never heard him scream before.
Sherlock had no interest in such things and buried himself in invoices. Domestic problems... they couldn't possibly have mattered less to him. Fortunately, the numbers had a calming effect on him and distracted him from the nerve-wracking wait for Kitty's reply.
Sherlock was sitting in his bed. Yet it wasn't his bed. He looked frantically round at the darkness, his eyes open wide. Then a door opened and a narrow strip of light crept across the floor.
“John is...” Mike groped for words. “He’s not a bad bloke. It’s just that his temper gets the better of him sometimes, and then...” Mike sighed heavily and took another breath. “I’ve known him long enough. Believe me, Sherlock... he truly does regret what he did. Even if he didn’t say it to you.”
One evening, John sat alone in his living room and wondered what it would be like if Sherlock were beside him on the couch, nibbling on his earlobe... how it would be if he only needed to call for him in order to have him whenever he felt like it.
"Coward," Sherlock hissed at John before taking a stab at cutting into Mycroft's furious tirade. "Mycroft... you..."
Sherlock tipped his nose up with a soft sniff. The move was familiar to John and he knew he was forgiven, even if Sherlock continued to act indifferent for a while.
"Then quit looking at me like that and tell me where I can get an interior designer, the sooner the better."
Sherlock was glad for the respite. He was exhausted and he knew - should this not prove to be the end yet - that he wasn't going to have the strength or focus to avoid every single blow, or even to mitigate them. He was going to have to absorb even more. He heard John swallowing, and all of a sudden he remembered the door wasn't locked. It would have been a simple matter of getting up and leaving. Something told him John wouldn't stop him. Not now that the first storm had passed. Sherlock considered it briefly but decided against it. It wasn't over yet. John still needed him.
He nodded tightly, whereby he avoided looking at her directly, instead focusing on a spot next to her shoulder. "I'd prefer it."
John, who knew how to protect and defend his property... Although Sherlock had always enjoyed his freedom and living independently, he found the idea of defining himself as one of John's
"Oh, I don't know..." Mike waved off the suggestion with a laugh. "John's really not the marrying type."
But Lestrade didn't respond with anything more than a tired, long-suffering look at the mangling of his name. Sherlock frowned to himself. Ginger! Didn't that deserve at least an annoyed '
. Then a key prodded frantically - and inaccurately - around the keyhole until the door was unlocked with a redemptive click and swung open.
He felt vaguely that his bonds were removed. Limp and satiated, he sank down beside John. His pillar of strength. His fortress. His anchor.
Half an hour later, the light in the room reflected off a wet spot on Sherlock's stomach, every movement and every breath causing the muscles there to shiver with tension.
At some point, John would try to understand everything that had happened. At some point, he'd try to understand why Sherlock had been prepared to sacrifice himself for him... to give up his life in order to ensure that John's enemies didn't have anything to hold over him anymore. It was a goddamned miracle that the two of them were still alive. John gave Sherlock one last look, but Sherlock's eyes were closed and his face was distorted with pain. Time was running short. Sherlock needed to get to a hospital, and urgently. Why had he never completed his medical studies? If he had, he'd be better able to help Sherlock now. It was with the greatest reluctance that John left Sherlock in the somewhat dubious care of Mycroft and Greg and ran back down to the street as fast as possible to get his car.
"The former Hornsey Wood Reservoir is located underneath this section of the park. One of the decommissioned reservoirs providing drinking water to the City of London."
John decided to lay it all out there and admit to his feelings - even given the risk that he might be hurt so deeply this time that it was doubtful he would ever recover. He mustered all of his courage and said as calmly as possible: "I think... ever since you broke into my office and started sniffing around in my accounts. But maybe even before that. Maybe even on... that one night... when you kissed me on the mouth the first time. Yeah, I think that was it... you stole my heart with that kiss."
"More..." Sherlock moaned. No sooner had he spoken the word than a shudder ran through his body. Had he gone mad? Had he really just begged for
'. That seemed rather odd to Mike. But he was much too tired to think about it any further. Who knew what went on in Sherlock's head? He probably called the Queen '
Nothing doing there until tomorrow evening at least. He felt completely empty and dried out. On the one hand, the thought filled him with a deep satisfaction, but at the same time that satisfaction didn't stop him from pouting. At least a little.
"You're worse than Mike, you know that?" John said with a little laugh, in an attempt to lighten the mood. "He's also mother henning me... and Dave and Naresh are here too."
"They didn't ask me," John said with a sheepish shrug. "Mike gave them the money and Mrs Turner and Eleanor threw themselves into some kind of over-the-top decorating orgy. They even got Thomas and Jacques involved... every time I dared to ask what all this crap was about, they used you as an excuse."
John bit his lip. The mistakes he'd committed that fatal day when he'd been too angry to formulate a single clear thought and attacked Sherlock the moment his men removed Glendale from the room... His eyes sank to the floor and he shook his head, as if in doing so he could drive away the images and memories.
"I hope for your sake that you didn't lie to me about the enema. It might be that you find yourself enjoying the pleasure of licking my fingers clean ...
"This stuff is no better than dishwater," Sherlock declared. "Why are we drinking this nonpotable swill? And when will Jacques be back?"
Jacques cleared the plates from the appetiser course onto a tray and served the main course - lamb with green beans. John, meanwhile, sat at the table, his brow furrowed and his expression pinched, as he read (obvious from the monotonous movements of his index finger) the latest reports from various news sources on his smart phone.
"According to the radio, there's a car on fire near Hyde Park Corner, sir," Bridges promptly responded. "I'm afraid my old back-alley routes aren't going to do us any good here. Half of London's shut down."
John pursed his lips pensively. "No, I'm not angry with you anymore. I'm not even certain I was really angry with you in the first place. Don't get me wrong - I was pissed off that you just ignored my instructions. But angry …" He shrugged his shoulders. "Either way - your punishment took care of it for me. I promise."
John bit his lip and firmly pressed the final digit of the number. He’d never wanted to lie down on a shrink’s couch before - he’d never seen why it might be necessary, and thought Mike was being overcautious and even a little square. It wasn’t easy to admit to himself that his friend had been right with his misgivings all along.
Sherlock watched wide-eyed as John pulled his pyjamas down even further and stroked his testicles with one hand. A relieved sound, half groan and half sob, escaped his throat, and his hands scrabbled in vain for something to hold on to. John held his overwrought body firmly down by the hips with both hands.
John had absolutely no quarrel with either that compelling statement nor the even more compelling look in Sherlock's eyes. He swallowed, his throat dry, and nodded.
"Look in the mirror, Sherlock!" John rasped into his ear. "I want to see you... I want to see your face."
But John had to smile at the sight of the lower lip thrust forward in a pout, the forlorn and disappointed look, and the '
"Brass knuckles... eh... baseball bat … so-so... tyre iron? A little old-fashioned... but why not? Naresh, my jacket."
As he did so, John was able to catch a glimpse of Sherlock's pale upper body, which was hairless and as smooth as a marble sculpture. John's respiratory rate increased, and he licked his lips in anticipation. He loved lads who were as smooth and soft as a proverbial baby's bum.
Even as Sherlock still clung to the fleeting kiss, John inserted the hand with the plug between Sherlock's thighs.
John cleared his throat. “To mine, of course. My house. I've just bought you free,” he explained, waiting for the outburst of elation … which still didn't appear after several moments.
Jacques cried in horror as he finally seemed to receive the message. “You cannot do that! Monsieur Watson...”
"It's more than seven hours by car from London to Crieff... If you went by plane... you wouldn't be gone as long."
mind blowing,” He insisted, feeling as if he was grasping at straws. He was losing Sherlock and he really didn’t want to. “You know that, too. It was. In the beginning. I want to know what changed. Are you bored of it already? Bored of… me?” He asked haltingly, voicing his greatest fear.
“You're always serious,” Irene responded disparagingly. “Rome is always burning. The Titanic's always sinking. I don't like to say this, but – you're a drama queen. Although...” she added with a smile. “Strike the part about
A hand found its way to his hair and ruffled it gently. "You should get to bed. Wouldn't want you to fall asleep here," John mentioned, a trace of concern in his voice. "You'd end up with a hell of a backache tomorrow."
"Ever heard of a prince's wand?" John wanted to know. Sherlock shook his head as well as he could. "No? The term '
"Just tired," John said, brushing him off. Truth be told, his thoughts were still caught up in his talk with 'Call-Me-Ella'. "Where's Sherlock, by the way?" As if on cue, the sound of a violin floated in from the great hall.
Barely three hours later, however, John was once again standing outside the door to the room he'd left Sherlock in. Dissatisfied and highly irritated, as John recalled. The thought made him smile. Their interlude that morning hadn't been enough for him either, and the thought of Sherlock tossing back and forth in bed, frustrated, had done its part toward jacking up John's libido. He reached between his legs to adjust his growing erection and then walked into the room without knocking.
Lestrade entered the room and heard the door close behind him. His first thought was that it looked like a fairly normal, modern office.
There was no sound in the room other than the strains of the opera. It was a pleasant silence. John was happy to feel Sherlock's cheek against his thigh, and Sherlock was happy to have John gently stroke his hair.
John had drawn certain conclusions from his observations of Sherlock, and counted on his words eliciting a hefty shudder, or at least a long, drawn-out moan. Based on Sherlock's behaviour up to now, that or a similar reaction should have been the result of this type of provocation.
But now he really had to turn his attention to that extremely interesting text message and try to find out more. He'd best call Kitty right away.
John returned Sherlock's gaze steadily, but after a while he cleared his throat and said abruptly, "I'll draw us a bath."
"Mm-hm," Mycroft said vaguely, looking down at his naked legs. He should really get dressed rather than sit around the whole time on the floor in nothing more than his shirt and waistcoat. His eyes wandered over Greg, who sat beside him, utterly at ease. He was completely naked except for the socks on his feet. It should have looked ridiculous, or somehow perverse... but it just seemed... natural.
"I presume the elections didn't exactly go in your favour. Therefore … help yourself," Sherlock said with a peculiar kind of smile.
His muscles stiffened and quivered. His hips wanted to thrust forward - into that sweet, sweet pain... and at the same time he wanted to get away from John's hands, which were holding his erection in such a matter-of-fact - almost dispassionate - manner. Sherlock didn't know what to do with himself. He was glad, now, for the bonds, which he no longer regarded as a restriction, but an anchor. He'd truly believed that the sperm-stopper that John had used on him several times already would have prepared him sufficiently for this, but that had been a massive miscalculation. Nothing was sufficient to prepare a man for this kind of stimulation. Nothing. Nothing at all.
He was answered with a remarkably stern glare. "Gregory Lestrade... was that an attempt at sexual innuendo?"
Mike had to swallow a grin. "Slutty secretary? He would have liked that." Both men fell silent for a moment before Mike went on: "He said you should go to sleep. It'll probably be pretty late before he can get rid of the gang."
. Nothing at all! Sherlock hadn't done anything wrong. In fact, he'd been faithful to him – as faithful as he could be, given his circumstances and his job.
Mike took note of the slight hesitation in Sherlock's answer. The minimal pause that anyone else with a less temperamental wife than Susan would have missed completely. But Mike noticed the tiny hitch and suspected that Sherlock had wanted to say something other than what he'd actually said.
"And... your amnesia?" Mycroft asked, hesitating slightly as if he weren't sure the question was appropriate.
It mattered to him very much what Sherlock thought of him... and that notion didn’t even scare him now as much as it used to.
A short while later, John had Sherlock lying on his back on the table with John standing between the splayed legs hanging uselessly over the edge.
"Good choice," John affirmed. "I have a Courvoisier XO Imperial here. I think that's appropriate." He took two round-bellied cognac glasses off the shelf and poured the drinks.
"Oh. Well, he doesn't play too bad," was Mike's only reply, to John's surprise and relief. He'd expected Mike to be a bit more curious.
John gave him a mischievous grin. "Mycroft only wanted to give you one... but I didn't know whether you'd prefer Mr Holmes... or Mr Sigerson... so I …
Inside, he was writhing on the floor in mortification, but on the outside, he maintained his serene facade.
Sherlock's scream hurt his ears, but it was a spectacular sight: his bright red cheeks, his glistening eyes, his wild hair, the perspiration on his chest - rising and falling in a rapid rhythm; his back - arched almost like the string of a bow - and the expression of utter bliss with a trace of disbelief and a dash of timid reverence on his face.
With a quiet sense of anticipation and mild gratification, Mycroft put his phone away and signalled that he was ready to set out. Greg drove off, and Mycroft followed. Securing Anthea's services by offering her the free position as his secretary had turned out to be truly inspired. Her abilities had been sorely wasted as a maid in John Watson's household. That had been clear to him at their first meeting, when he'd attempted to win her over to his side and convince her to keep her eyes and ears open around Doc Watson in order to supply him with certain pieces of information.
"Not that!" Sherlock cried out, irritated and a little disparaging. "I couldn't care less about your business dealings."
John knew by now how much Sherlock hated it when someone showed consideration toward him, when John worried about him or even tried, just a little bit, to... not exactly to coddle him, but, well, to pamper him. It hadn't been like that before, but ever since the events in Finsbury Park...
"Oh, God..." Sherlock moaned softly. His erection twitched, and another drop of pre-ejaculate fluid formed in the narrow slit of his glans.
"No. That won't be necessary. And it's also not what I paid for," John answered in the same, faintly bored tone of voice.
He knew - without needing to check for himself - that Sherlock's penis was completely erect, and he wondered whether he was really going to be able to prevent Sherlock from reaching orgasm... but then Sherlock's knees began to tremble, and John rubbed a little more forcefully over that specific spot. He felt a gentle twitch, a slight pulsing around his fingers, and then he heard a tortured whimper.
Now it was John's turn to look dumbfounded. "Because I'm sometimes still hungry - or get hungry - late in the evening or in the middle of the night," he explained with a mischievous smile, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Sherlock moved along with the trajectory of the punch, taking much of the force out of it. He let John connect, albeit weakly, rather than avoiding him completely - which would have been a possibility as well.
so far. The police had him blacklisted, to be sure, but his bribes were still sufficient to calm any feathers that might be ruffled. However, you had to be a dyed in the wool idiot to try to buy your way free of murdering a police officer - there simply wasn't enough money in the world. And John might be many things … but he was certainly no idiot. He knew exactly how to keep out of any unnecessary trouble.
"Still... Mike's right," John went on emphatically. "You need to see a doctor. You need a hospital."
bodyguards betrayed you," Moriarty broke in with a sneer. "I had cameras in the flat! Do you really think I would have left something as valuable as Sebastian unmonitored?" Moriarty paused. An ugly grin curled his lips. "Oh... of course... you didn't pay very close attention to your little pet yourself, now did you? Otherwise Mary wouldn't have been able to catch it when it got out. At least it was wearing its master's tag... Ever thought about a chip in the ear instead? Or a tattoo?
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders. "I just wonder... how did someone with such moral principles end up in the mob?"
into the furthermost corner of his mind. He could wrack his brains over it some other day. But he fully intended to take advantage of the current situation. Maybe the relaxed, almost playful atmosphere between them would have a positive effect on Mycroft's close-mouthed, oyster-like attitude. Greg hadn't entirely given up the hope of getting some answers to his questions and shedding light on things. There was too much cop in him to just let things lie.
"I'm all right," Sherlock answered in a tight voice that told John quite clearly he was not all right.
– of belonging to just one other person – startlingly attractive. To finally belong somewhere ... to belong to
Mike leafed idly through some papers, licking his index finger in order to turn them over more easily.
He automatically started going through the names of the people in his mind who could reach him on this phone. Mike, his bodyguards, Mycroft Holmes... and before he could really think about what he was doing, he entered the number.
Perhaps half an hour had elapsed since then, and Sherlock longed to see the pattern the riding crop had left on his backside. Quite in contrast to his usual procedure, John hadn't done much more than warm up Sherlock's skin in a perfunctory manner by means of a few slaps with his bare hand, and for that reason, Sherlock was certain that there must now be red streaks showing on his skin.
"It is," John answered bluntly. "So... how can we get the largest amount of information out of Moran without him playing us or doing even more damage? I'm open for suggestions."
Once the aftershocks of his orgasm had let up a bit, he crouched over Sherlock. A bit dazed and uncoordinated, he rolled over beside the other man and gathered him close. Sherlock promptly snuggled up against him and buried his face in John's chest. Shudders continued to run through the slender form in his arms, and every time an incredibly lustful sigh fell from the full, red lips, making Sherlock's breath flow hot and moist over John's skin. The sighs were following by a seemingly never-ending stream of whispered utterances that sounded like "
Mike sucked on his lower lip and tilted his head deliberately from side to side. "I think that might be a tad much. Don't you?"
Sherlock's hands slid unanchored across the sheets, so he switched to supporting his weight on his forearms. He apparently couldn't muster the will to continue holding his head up, as he allowed his forehead to rest between his arms on the bed, which only caused his arse to stick up even higher.
Sherlock had absently reached for his cup as well and taken a sip. It was only due to his posh upbringing - which made itself known at the oddest moments - and John's presence that he didn't spit it all back into the cup. He looked up and took in the various expressions of disgust and resignation in the faces of the other two men.
Going by that description, Barbie should probably have found a job with the Salvation Army rather than work for the mob. But John had given Albright a pass on account of his grief and hoped that questioning Charlie would shed some light on the opaque situation.
"It's fine," John assured him, and even though he hadn't wanted to discuss his work with Sherlock, the next words spilled out of him without even passing through a filter. "Awkward business. Policeman." In answer to Sherlock's questioning look - delivered without a trace of horror or any other judgement, as John noted to his pleasant surprise - he added, "I had nothing to do with it. If it'd been one of my boys, they could have bought a double plot. To gun down a police officer - and the wrong one, to boot - is pretty much the stupidest thing you can do. No, it was the Russians. I have to show up, though. It's expected of someone in my position."
The nervous manner in which Sherlock moistened his lips was enough of an answer for John. "You're an idiot," he scolded him, smiling. "How in the world did you come up with such nonsense?"
"I'm afraid I'm going to have to thank your brother..." John mused, running his fingers through Sherlock's dark curls.
One fine evening – after a marvelous case involving an exhilarating chase through half of London, ending with a takedown of the criminal involving karate Sherlock had learned when he was nine and a well-timed punch from John – Sherlock and John left the Yard giggling like schoolboys. It had started to drizzle as soon as they stepped outside and they both looked up in annoyance and surprise before looking at each other. Sherlock smiled. There were those odd wrinkles around his eyes and his lips did the funny thing they were wont to do and there were glittering raindrops in his hair and he crunched up his nose in such an adorable way- everything was how it was every time between them.
John had always got a kick out of kissing someone who was shorter than him ... or who was underneath him. Sherlock must have guessed that. The warm, soft lips opened for him hungrily, and with their heat nearly erased the memory of that first, chaste kiss from a few days ago. But there was almost an innocent sweetness in the meeting of their lips, tongues, and teeth this time as well, and it touched John just as deeply as it had with their first kiss.
But then he became aware there was something he hadn't thought of... should he try to calm John down, or let him rage? Sherlock cursed himself silently - there was always something!
When John returned, he stood at the level of Sherlock's crotch. He slipped the loop of the riding crop over his left wrist, closing his fingers around the handle in a relaxed yet firm grip. He hefted the crop to get a feel for it, admiring its high-quality workmanship.
When the first news reports hit the airwaves, Moriarty's eyes lit up with delight. Dimmock had held his protective hand over John Watson long enough.
He hated not knowing what game was being played. He hated not being in charge of the game. He hated not even knowing the rules. He hated it with every fibre of his being. One false move... one wrong decision... one inadvertent remark... could have fatal consequences or set off a chain reaction with unforeseeable repercussions.
He didn't do any of that, though. He simply stood there, his eyes lowered, with a grin that was surely nothing short of idiotic, as he attempted to comprehend the new turn his life had taken.
"There's nothing like a satisfying doctor-patient relationship," she declared, with every indication of being pleased with the situation. Her gaze caught on the orchids that Mike was still holding in his left hand. "What beautiful flowers," she purred, stepping closer to Mike, who felt himself growing warm at her boldness. "I love orchids."
"I should have brought flowers," Sherlock murmured pensively. They were the first words he'd spoken since they'd left their house. He hadn't opened his mouth once during the drive, instead staring out the window, lost in his own thoughts in an anomalous bout of self-reflection.
How many were there? Four? He'd lost count. Something that virtually never happened. God – four identical beads, as big as ping-pong balls.
"John? I... don't think you heard ..." Instead of being relieved, Sherlock tried with typical pigheadedness to dissuade John of his opinion that Sherlock's inability to come without being touched was somehow irrelevant. John had to see that he was a failure! He'd always been a failure. His whole life long.
A few days later, Doris was sitting at the dinner table with Irene and Sherlock when she decided it was time to bring up the delicate topic she'd been avoiding for so long.
"Not really. The mafia being such good Catholics, crime takes a holiday for Christmas too," he answered with a shrug. "There were just a couple of hotheads down south in Roehampton who thought they could spit in our soup."
"I don't see it like that," Sherlock contradicted him with that unflappable calm that he occasionally displayed, the source of which would forever remain a mystery to John.
was he supposed to say to that? But before he could come up with anything, his counterpart continued speaking.
Sherlock hurried to comply with his wish, only to find that his fingers were unable to untie the knots in his laces. John had already fetched the Vaseline from the nightstand in the meantime, and turned back to him. Impatient, aggravated, and a little bit cowed by John's odd behaviour, Sherlock simply broke one shoelace off and tugged at the other shoe until he could get it off without undoing the laces. He stood up, pulled his trousers and pants down over his hips with one hand and let them both fall to the floor. His heart was pounding in a quick staccato, and he had to almost violently suppress the urge to cover his nakedness (or, more specifically: his half-hard erection) with his hands in shame.
Tonight's events probably wouldn't entirely put an end to Doc Watson, but they would take a heavy toll.... he might even be down for the count. Jim smiled. It wouldn't take much longer.
He lifted his eyes as best he could to look at John. Then his mouth opened just a bit more, and the cream ran down John's penis in tiny rivulets.
John exhaled slowly. The first traces of arousal flickered through his body. He'd always taken great enjoyment in breaking the feisty ones. And this young man was an extraordinary example of one such.
How had it gone? Oh right - now she remembered... It had been a bad day. Rainy and hardly any customers in Speedy's, the little café she'd been working in at the time. She'd smoked her last fag that morning and didn't have enough money for a new pack. One or two decent tips would have been enough, but the only real customers she'd had during her shift - leaving aside the ones who bought their coffee to take away and never left a tip anyway - were real penny-pinchers. They hadn't left her a penny even though they'd had money. Lots of it. Some of it had even changed hands in a fat envelope. She'd seen it clear as day! Oh, she'd pretended to be polishing the glasses, but she'd kept an eye on the men the whole time. She'd thought they were lovers at first, the way they were crowded up so close and secretive in the corner, but when all they did was talk, she'd quickly dismissed the idea.
And all of a sudden, John realised that although Sherlock might be far from perfect, it was those very flaws that made him so ideal.
There were still little piles of snow to be found in some of the shadier spots, although the first snowdrops were pushing their tender white blossoms through the dark earth and grey grass.
from you?" John replied with a thin smile and a slight shake of his head. "As rare as it is that you say it to me..."
John couldn't entirely suppress the superior smile this time. "Very simple. Sherlock's my accountant. My chief accountant, if you will. The final auditor for all my other accountants," he described the situation.
"I... what..." the man stammered, before gathering his wits. "My dick's made a helluva lot of boys happy. It's not my fault you can't get it up. Maybe Irene should be handing out Viagra..."
But Sherlock continued to stand there, unmoving, in front of the desk, blinking back and forth between the box and John.
"Don't think you can wrap me around your little finger whenever you want now," John chided him grumpily, but his eyes twinkled as he said it. "I know perfectly well that you know
But Sherlock didn't have any appreciation for the grandeur surrounding him. He was entirely preoccupied with resisting the temptation to pluck nervously at his clothes and hair. In order to distract himself, therefore, he went to stand at the window – hidden behind the curtain – so that he could keep an eye on the street in order to await John's arrival. He was fully aware of the fact that his behaviour bordered on being childish, but he couldn't help it.
What was John planning? Hadn't he told him in no uncertain terms back at the very beginning that he only wanted Sherlock in his bed when sex was in the offing?
"But you can give yourself a bit of relief," he allowed generously, gracing Sherlock with his broadest grin. "You have permission to rub two fingers over the head of your cock." He loosened his grip on Sherlock's hair in order to give him an encouraging pat on the cheek. "Go on - what are you waiting for?"
Didn't people generally go to therapists in order to learn how to talk more easily and openly about their emotions?
Sherlock sucked in his lower lip and shook his head tiredly. “I don't owe Irene any money,” he said, to John's great surprise. “You just assumed that and I... never corrected you.” He took a deep breath before giving John a soft yet aching look. “I owe her something that neither you nor I can ever repay. I owe her my life.”
Greg's lips parted as if in slow motion. "Okay... get dressed. I think this is going to be a long story after all."
Sherlock's lips parted, but he had no strength left to scream. His throat felt like it was closed off.
"Yes... yes, she was. And beautiful. So beautiful, and her laugh..." He broke off. "Then the child must be almost six years old?"
Mycroft stared at the closed door for quite some time. Perhaps it would have been better to tell Greg that the only reason he hadn't visited him was because he didn't want to make him any more of a target than he already was. There was no telling what could have happened if it became known in certain circles that... Mycroft shook his head firmly. It simply
That hurt. Not that he hadn’t been expecting it, but hearing it stated so matter-of-factly…it stung.
"It'll all work out," Mike declared optimistically. "You'll get the thing with Moran signed off on tomorrow and then you can all figure out how to get Donovan under control."
That evening, John really had learned something new about Sherlock. The man could not only suck cock like the devil himself, was not only an incredible fuck and made the most marvellous sounds while doing so ... no, he was also an unusually talented thief.
Sherlock's soft-eyed gaze promptly hardened and he glared at John. "You called my bloody brother!" he accused him harshly.
Just two days after his discussion with Detective Inspector Lestrade, Mycroft Holmes emerged from the car that had brought him home. The chauffeur drove off. Mycroft didn't need him anymore that evening. The steady rain had finally stopped, and the sun was struggling its way through the thin cloud cover. Mycroft was still standing on the pavement, about to enter the house, nod to the concierge and access the lift with his keycard when two large men in dark suits appeared on either side of him.
"Fuck's sake, Mike!" John barked at him, laying two fingers against Sherlock's neck. "Quit with the nonsense. Make yourself useful instead and bring me a glass of water."
His eyes were flat and filled with a murderous chill. "Your concerns are completely baseless, Miss Adler. Glendale's on my paylist, along with half of Scotland Yard. And now... get out of my way, or I'll be forced to ask Naresh to deal with you."
"John...no..." Sherlock protested weakly, but when John lifted him up in his arms, Sherlock wrapped his hands around John's neck as if seeking an anchor.
There must have been others who had cheated on John, who had been unfaithful to him. Sherlock's eyes flickered restlessly behind their closed lids like will-o'-the-wisps in an attempt to filter, combine, and reconcile the information which his brain had stored about John and which was now being presented to him as a fleeting stream of thoughts.
He hefted the iron bar briefly in his hand, lifted it over his shoulder, stood on one side of Charlie, gauged the distance, and swung.
In the last, fading light of the day, John was just able to make out that Sherlock wasn't wearing anything more than pyjama trousers - which hung scandalously low on his hips - and a dressing gown that he hadn't closed, and which had slid off his shoulder in a rather picturesque way. His chest was naked, his feet bare.
"Yes; after all, she's well known for her punctuality. I was quite worried when she didn't turn up at her usual time," Mycroft reported with his typical indifference.
Naresh and Dave murmured their thanks, both surprised and happy, and when Bridges stopped the car, they obediently got out.
"You are the most incredible, fascinating, wonderful man I've ever met." As soon as John heard himself say those last words, he had the urge to wish he'd never said them.
Sherlock took John's hand away from his throat and breathed a soft kiss onto the palm. He could feel John's shiver. Then he said quietly, "I'm fine." He held John's hand against his cheek, nuzzled into the touch, and exhaled a very contented sigh. His eyes fell shut.
A brief, amused laugh escaped John's lips, quite against his will. Then he shook his head, still chortling. "You are such a peacock."
"Mike..." John said, lifting one shoulder. "Go upstairs and have Mrs Turner bring you breakfast, all right?"
John went into the small parlour where Mycroft Holmes was waiting for him. When he entered, Holmes - who had been pacing in front of the windows - stopped where he was and fixed John with a hard stare.
you... to expose your body and your soul piece by piece. To take you apart and ... maybe ... to put you back together again. I alone hold your pain and your pleasure in my hands."
John stood at the window of his office, looking out at the bare tree limbs, his hands clasped behind his back. Sherlock was at John's desk, his elbows propped up and his hands folded beneath his chin in an attitude of prayer.
Jacques frowned and already had his mouth open to reply when the sound of a car driving up sounded over the delicate strains of the violin.
Next morning, when Mike was going through the schedule for the next few days with him, John asked, “What's on for the day after tomorrow?”
"Well, yes," John admitted readily. "But at least we can make it as difficult as possible for the bastards."
?" Sherlock asked slowly, still unable to comprehend what was happening. He wasn't being thrown out. Instead... what? What exactly was John offering him here?
Once he'd realised that his death was a done deal from the outset, Sherlock had stopped burdening his brain with the superfluous search for a way out; instead, he'd begun trying to find a way in which his death might be useful for John. It was the last thing he would be able to do for him. The only thing he could still do for him in that situation.
After that, John left him lying on the floor and went to pour himself another glass of whisky. Sherlock heard the muted clinking of glass against glass and the gentle burble of liquid being poured. It went on for quite a while. John wasn't going to be able to toss back that amount in a single draught; he'd need a bit more time.
- subterranean water reservoirs... no longer in use... and photographs of them, including exact layout
Sherlock leaned into the gentle touch. "Vatican cameos," he replied obediently, only rolling his eyes a bit.
It was another of John's attempts to get Sherlock to climax without either of them touching his erection. Sherlock had lost any semblance of self-control after half an hour and begged John to tie him up.
The doorman swallowed, his Adam's apple visibly bobbing. "Of course..." he replied, although he still didn't give any indication of actually moving out of the way. "It's just..." he began, cut himself off, and then spoke rapidly, as if he'd just had a brilliant idea: "What can we do for you today?"
And for the first time in his life, it seemed to Sherlock that everything would work out for the best. That all of the puzzle pieces would find their rightful place of their own accord to create a complete picture. A perfect picture... without any gaps... without any blemishes.
"Wait for me," his boss said once Bridges had brought the car to a complete standstill. "It won't take more than an hour." Then he got out and approached the building.
Oh, how much... how very, very much Sherlock wanted to give in to the temptation. How wonderful it would be...
Of course, John also climaxed every time – but before that, he usually concentrated all of his efforts on Sherlock, and Sherlock was often the first who was allowed to have an orgasm.
"That's it... You're actually... you're afraid of hitting me like this." He shook his head. "My God, John! Really! Let it go. I'm not tied up or gagged... If I don't want you to hit me there's no way you'd make contact. Believe me."
John pulled his arm back again - and once again, it was a perfect strike. Sherlock ran his tongue over his dry lips and tried to moisten his throat with convulsive swallows. In vain. Just like the desperate twitching of his erection, which hadn't flagged once the whole time but had remained jutting away from his body, red, fat, and dripping.
This second meeting had garnered a few inquisitive looks within his department, and might even have started the first rumours that he was the mayor's new protégé. Lestrade took a deep breath. For years - for decades, in fact - he'd keep strictly clear of any hint of favouritism. And now this! It wasn't even as if there were anything going on. He hadn't been offered anything, and he hoped it was going to stay that way.
At the end of the first day he was already in bed when John called. They only spoke briefly, but at least it helped Sherlock to sleep soundly.
A vague smile passed across the other man's face. "Call me Sergeij," he said, taking a seat across from Patrick.
With a narrow but self-satisfied grin, Sherlock let him go. “First: as soon as I set foot in your house, I'm not leaving it again. Not for anything, no matter what.”
John chewed the inside of his cheek and ground his teeth lightly. "I know perfectly well that the only reason you're still using that cane is to make me feel guilty even longer."
"Fuuuuck," Sherlock echoed, drawing the word out. "Yes, that was the general idea," he explained casually before getting up and taking off his clothes so that he stood naked in front of John. Then he took a strawberry out of the bowl and sat down straddling John's lap. He held the fruit carefully between his teeth and tilted his head toward John, who met him halfway and kissed him with everything he had. The sweetness of the strawberry combined with the ferocity of their kiss, reinforcing the flavour of their lust.
. Third: all of Mr Sigerson’s wishes, instructions, and orders will be fulfilled immediately. You will not double-check with Mr Watson or seek any other confirmation. If Mr Sigerson wants to have the entry hall painted pink, you will do nothing more than ask ‘
John stared at her angrily, not answering. She returned the look, simply waiting, not letting herself be provoked. John had to hand it to her - she certainly wasn't afraid of him, even though she knew more or less what his work involved. She wasn't stupid; he'd never given her any specifics, yet she'd been able to piece things together over time. It hadn't shocked her, and when he'd asked her about it once, she'd told him she used to provide psychological assessments for court cases, and after that there really wasn't anything that could shock her anymore. She'd explained it all in her friendly, calm way, without making a value judgement one way or the other. That had been the clincher for John... ever since then, he'd respected her and her advice. But now...
"Because they're afraid. Not because they trust me," John said dully. "Fear... it's a shitty motivator."
Books lying open on tables and chairs, overflowing ashtrays, stale air, piles of clothes on the floor, a dried-out plant on the windowsill. And smack in the middle of the chaos: Sherlock. Sherlock, wearing a pair of striped pyjama bottoms and a stretched-out t-shirt, sitting cross-legged on his bed with a laptop balanced on his knees. Sherlock, with two days' worth of stubble on his cheeks and his eyes widened in horror, looking ridiculously young – nothing at all like the worldly prostitute John had first met several months ago.
Fortunately, John didn't notice Sherlock's unusual silence, since he was already rattling on excitedly: "Sherlock, I've... I bought a bed today. And I know, I bought it without asking you... but it's perfect, Sherlock, it's absolutely perfect."
Sherlock truly did seem earmarked for death. Would Moriarty torture him before he killed him? Would he violate him? Or had he already?
"It must be around here somewhere," Sherlock said slowly, and stopped walking. His eyes scanned down a particular row of graves. "At least according to what Mycroft told me."
"Higgins..." John said slowly, skilfully mixing condescension with familiarity and seasoning it all with a jovial smile. "You realise someone's trying to dump this whole shitstorm in my lap. If that weren't the case... no one would have shot poor old Charlie right when he got to the most interesting part. Right?"
"If I feel like tying you down, hitting you and hurting you until you're so turned on you don't know up from down, then that's exactly what I'll do." The arm around Sherlock's waist tightened and held him more firmly. "Without all those bits and bobs. Just like I always have. A couple of hooks here and there... a rope... some leather cuffs... I don't need more than that," John growled in a low voice. "Or do you have a different opinion?"
I've prepared you thoroughly," John remarked in a neutral tone, all the while letting his hand move further and further up Sherlock's thigh until it reached its goal and the tips of his fingers brushed the clean-shaven scrotum.
Bridges thought his boss seemed more pensive than usual. He was also a little pale, and his mouth had a strange sort of decisive set to it. At least as far as Bridges was able to judge from the bits he could see in the rear view mirror. Wherever Mr Watson was headed... it wasn't an appointment he was looking forward to.
"Doubtless." Mycroft cleared his throat. "Shall we leave them to their own devices then? Down... there?"
One of the chairs was occupied – namely by his newest trophy, the young virgin. But John saw that he was going to have to re-think his initial assessment. This rent boy was no boy any longer. A grown man sat in the armchair. A man in an elegant black suit, his legs casually slung over each other. John was surprised, to say the least. This Sherlock was definitely older than he'd expected. He still seemed fairly young, though, which was probably partly due to his slender build, his pale, delicate skin, and his dark, boyish curls, which hung down over his forehead like a schoolboy's. Taken all together, it could fool another less observant client into thinking he was younger.
John looked at him and realised that Sherlock was watching him very closely, attuned and alert, like a hunting dog who wasn't sure whether he had caught the right scent or not.
After what seemed like an eternity, Irene caught up to John Watson and his two escorts. Just as John indicated with a nod of his head to one of his companions that he should open the door to room eleven (or break it down, God forbid), she caught her breath enough to call his name.
"I still think you should have made Irene give you back all the money," Sherlock remarked as John held the door to his house open for him.
"It is rather boring here... from time to time..." Sherlock answered sheepishly, drawing circles on the covers with his index finger.
," he finally said, his smile both patronising and somewhat forced. "Now would you please blackmail me with it rather than blundering about in vague insinuations?"
"Gladly." John could afford to be generous. He'd got what he wanted, and he'd maintained the upper hand throughout the conversation.
“Hmmm…” Sherlock fell silent and John was relieved to find that he was really thinking about what he’d said and not dismissing it as irrelevant. “Well,” Sherlock continued after a while, “perhaps you’re right. I don’t think that it would hurt me emotionally, because I’m not ashamed of my penis… but I can’t know for sure. You saying those sorts of things to me…it’s like you said. In my head, when I fantasize about it…I enjoy it.” Another deep blush covered his cheek and John restrained the urge to kiss it away. “But actually hearing you say those things…We should at least try it once. Please?”
Their lips met in a painfully sweet kiss. Sherlock all but melted under John's tongue and mouth, and the tension flowed out of his body. He pressed against John, becoming limp and compliant as the kiss intensified. He drank it greedily from John's lips like a man dying of thirst.
to be penetrated, then he didn't really have any other choice at the moment. He simply had to ignore that other stupid little stirring fluttering through his heart, and nip it in the bud.
The motorcycle pulled up beside the driver's side of the car. The motorcyclist took off his helmet and ran a hand through his short, grey hair. He didn't dismount, however, instead remaining astride the powerful BMW.
"John..." Sherlock began, somewhat at a loss, falling silent with relief when he felt John's hand on his back. He hadn't known what to say to that.
"Right down at the corner, why?" Greg answered in alarm, unable to make heads nor tails of Mycroft's monosyllabic replies and remarks during his call.
." He delivered the final words with so much scorn that Moriarty shrank back a bit, although still keeping the muzzle of his pistol pressed against Sherlock's temple.
At some point, John asked Sherlock to pick something he liked out of John's assortment of CDs and put it on. It was then that Sherlock discovered his collection of opera music, and slipped ‘
Standing in front of it again, his breaths came quicker. He stole a glance around, but couldn't see a soul other than himself. It was a good thing John had instructed his staff to come out only when they were summoned. Sherlock's lips curled into a gleeful grin as he set about picking the lock on the door to John's office. It wasn't as easy as the back doors of remote warehouses, but after a while there was a
"Shhhhh," John said right next to him, touching his hip with one hand. It was completely ridiculous how quickly Sherlock relaxed in the wake of that touch, that brief affirmation. "You're doing fantastic. Just a little more. I promise. Just a couple more blows... for me, Sherlock... can you do it?"
Sherlock didn't regret John's decisions. After all, they'd led to them meeting. He also didn't feel any pity for him. John lived on the edge of society, in a grey area, a criminal in the eyes of the police … but he'd chosen that life for himself, and - considering the scar on his shoulder - he'd worked hard for it and fought to defend his position. This was how he wanted it. Pity had no place here.
John felt the telltale twitching and tensing of muscles in the body he held in his arms and called out, "Stop!" When Sherlock didn't immediately respond, John grabbed his wrist and yanked his fingers away from his swollen penis.
"Ye lovers of the picturesque, if ye wish to drown your grief, Take my advice, and visit the ancient town of Crieff," Sherlock murmured sleepily into John's bare chest. He lay half on top of John in order to spare his sore behind, and John was only too happy to let him.
"Is that so?!" Sherlock yelled back angrily. "Nice of you to let me know – you never said a word about me belonging to you!"
John took a sip from his cup, shaking his head, before saying to Sherlock, "You're not going to stop until Jacques's including you in his evening devotions, are you?"
Sherlock's lips pressed together into a thin line. “Yes,” he said brusquely, appearing to be quite sure of himself. “I don't want
"Why now?" Sherlock virtually barked down the line. "Why are you rescinding the conservatorship now, of all times?!"
Sherlock gasped for breath and lost his balance, flailing out with one hand for John's leg in order to stabilise himself. John allowed it without berating him, as his attention was currently absorbed by something else altogether.
It wasn't until Sherlock was safely tucked up in bed - and snoring lightly - that John noticed how tired he was himself. He let himself drop onto the mattress beside Sherlock like a felled tree. He felt for Sherlock's hand, already halfway asleep, and once he found it, he sighed happily. One final thought popped into his head:
Mycroft Holmes didn't appear pleased by the turn the conversation was taking. "We've gone our separate ways," he said, cutting Lestrade off. "I didn't ask you here to philosophise over my brother."
A quick check of his watch told him that it was still early in the evening, although it seemed the first few guests had already arrived, judging by the laughter and snatches of chatter drifting up the stairs. Miss Adler would be in the lounge with her guests, entertaining them and greeting any new arrivals.
“Where’s Sherlock?” Mike asked sternly the next morning when he came into the office and found John sitting behind his desk.
Lestrade checked his watch, finished his coffee, tossed the empty cup into one of the conveniently placed rubbish bins, and set off for his appointment with the mayor. It was time.
He pressed together his lips and spat out, "Why not?" The anger and fury flashing in his eyes had almost found their way into his voice.
The path John walked along ended up taking him to a playground. Two swings, a see-saw, a sand pile and a slide. The usual, in other words. Several children of various ages were running around and playing. Their parents - most of them of the female variety - sat on the benches around the perimeter of the playground or stood near the path, waiting more or less patiently for their offspring to have their fill and come join them again.
"Good morning, Sherlock," Mycroft answered on the other end. His voice sounded as smarmy and arrogant as ever, and Sherlock made a face.
Tonight, Sherlock would ask John to let him take on the active role... just this once, he wanted to see what it was like to sink into John, to give John pleasure in that manner, to feel John that way, to experience his warmth, to... love John like that.
"The burning car, sir," Bridges whispered urgently. "It was a bomb. Dimmock's dead. They just reported it on the radio."
“No, not at all,” Sherlock stated confidently. “I may be a bit out of practise when it comes to the martial arts, but I’m perfectly capable of overpowering John any time I wish.”
After Mike left Sherlock in the living room, he decided there was no time like the present for ticking off the next item on the to-do list - which he’d come up with during the course of a sleepless night - and set off for the service wing.
Then he got an idea. Maybe there was still something he could do. He poked somewhat hectically at his phone to pull up the call log. But Sherlock was listed as the last caller.
"Only because I left first," Victor said resolutely, despite the fact that his hands were shaking and his forehead had broken out in a cold sweat. "It was just a matter of time."
The bed in the picture was made of dark wood - mahogany, according to the description - and decorated with various carvings. Just like John's current bedroom furniture, this one had four upright posts at the corners, but - unlike his bed at the moment - these were fixed at the top to a frame where curtains could be attached or a canopy draped across. The upper frame was stabilised with cross-bars that would be perfectly suited to wind ropes around...
John had to bite his lips in order not to burst out laughing. It would be difficult for anyone else to match Sherlock's unparalleled combination of arrogant overconfidence and perpetual insecurity. Without responding to the remark, John pointed at the coffee table.
The sudden realisation hit Sherlock like a ton of bricks, and he felt panic slowly but surely rising in him.
Then Sherlock heard a heavy object being shoved across the plastic. At the same time, he felt the tie go taut, pulling on his testicles and slowly and inexorably stretching them until they were in a position between his legs that nature never intended. His stiff member followed the motion until it pointed almost directly downward. Sherlock bit down on his lips but didn't change his position one iota, despite the fact that he could have shifted his hips back a bit to lessen the pressure... the continual, tight pain was too wonderful to put an end to it yet.
"And what would possibly have gone differently?" Mike asked in a bored tone of voice without looking up. They'd had the same conversation once too many times since yesterday.
John returned the look with all the composure he could muster. "No. He did that himself. He was already clean by the time our paths crossed."
"What if I have?" Sherlock retorted calmly but with firm emphasis. "What would be so bad about that? I don't hear YOU complaining about Lestrade having fallen head over heels for you." Sherlock paused with a sense of satisfaction when he heard his brother gasp. He must not have reckoned with that jab. "He's even gone so far as to engage in illegal acts for you..."
Watson, but John "007" Watson. John had changed his clothes, but he wasn't wearing the military costume Sherlock had expected; rather, he had on his best, most elegant suit, the one he'd bought specifically for the occasion when he and Sherlock had been invited to Downing Street.
"But..." John prompted gently. The word's presence had been too clear between the lines of Sherlock's statements. Too large to ignore.
"Sherlock, I saw the clothes you brought," John answered with a soft sigh. "They're a bit … well, shabby. And there's not enough. I didn't intend for you to walk around the house naked. And since you don't intend to ever leave the house, my tailor has to come here. He'll take your measurements and get to work. I've already told him what you need. He knows what to do." John's gaze slid over Sherlock's morning attire. "Although, now that I think about it - I should probably add pyjamas and dressing gowns to the list."
"I broke you in. Fairly thoroughly, I might add. Your virginity is over and done with. What else do you have to offer me that might entice me to favour you again? That might appeal to me enough to become your
"You vastly underestimate your charisma. You are seduction personified – pure sex on two legs. I've even been tempted a time or two. And we both know that I prefer women in general. But with you? I truly believe I'd make an exception for you."
Irene tossed her hands in the air. "Lord give me patience!" she cried. "Where was Doc even going? He doesn't know where..." Irene's eyes narrowed in fury. "You didn't give him the room number, did you?!"
John looked chagrined. Those were damned good questions, ones he didn't have an answer to. As exciting as all those ideas were, they weren't the reason he'd brought Sherlock here. Although he wasn't quite sure himself why he'd brought him here - which he only realised just now, with Sherlock staring at him with an inscrutable expression on his face. Questioning, with a trace of resolution around his mouth and something like uncertainty in his eyes. John couldn't make heads nor tails of it.
John couldn't hold back the smile that was tickling at the corners of his mouth any longer. This was the only trick that Sherlock ever used on him. He'd figured out how much John enjoyed tilting his head down when kissing... either because his partner was lying beneath him or was shorter than him. John had understood fairly quickly that Sherlock had seen right through him in that regard, and kept finding - or making - opportunities for himself to be shorter than John … all as if by accident. It was a gesture that John appreciated, and at the same time it both touched and aroused him.
"It's a good shot of our guy. Nice picture," Mike said, nodding. John rolled his eyes. "What?" Mike asked. "There's always going to be some uncertainty in these things. I can pay off the right people, but total control..." He shook his head apologetically. "That's beyond even me. That's why it can't hurt if our candidate gets a few honest votes."
I also should mention that I had to rely completely on my imagination. If something is wrong – please don't be too cross with me.
John squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, trying to push back and wrestle down the pain that had seized hold of his entire body. When he looked up again, Victor flinched away from him.
"Just how stupid do you think I am?" he asked with that utter calm and half-smile which, taken together, were much more dangerous than any screaming and ranting.
Hearing Mike's voice so close to his ear made him flinch. "Yeah... I... I'm still here," John answered, dispelling the last mists of the past with a brisk shake of his head.
“Ah,” Sherlock made an understanding sound and regarded him through half-lidded eyes. “And what about you?” A long, slender leg emerged from under the cover like an albino snake, and a foot – surprisingly narrow for its size - settled itself directly over the bulge in John's trousers. “Were you thinking of me this whole time too?” Sherlock wiggled his toes playfully.
Moving slowly, as if drugged, Sherlock turned over and knelt, supporting himself with his hands on the mattress. He spread his legs a little, lowered his head, and held perfectly still. Only the sound of his breathing could be heard. John paused for a moment, listening to the faintly stuttering inhalations. It didn't take long before Sherlock raised his head again to glare at John over his shoulder, almost reproachfully.
A hungry sigh brushed across John’s lips as his fingers touched the small metal ring with a tiny ball. Carefully, he felt for the channel and moved the ring slightly. He felt a shudder pass through Sherlock’s body and paused.
Sherlock's gaze fogged over as he looked first at the ring then at John through half-lidded eyes. Then he said in a voice that had slipped down an entire octave: "Left or right?"
“Here,” Mike echoed flatly. Then he shook his head and yelled, “You can't bring a hooker into this house!”
"Mmmhhh... yessss... oh, John... God, that's incredible... I... I think... I'm melting... so hot... so, so hot..." Sherlock groaned, and John put Sherlock's other leg over his shoulder too.
John increased the pressure of his fingers a bit, and Sherlock pulled away his sinfully willing lips, burying his face in the crook of John's neck with a long, drawn-out moan while still managing to maintain the clingy attitude of an overlarge cat. Sherlock's lips moved against John's skin, whispering something, but no sound reached John's ears. After a while, John thought he recognised a pattern, a certain rhythm, as if Sherlock were repeating the same sentence, the same words, over and over, without saying them out loud.
"John... just let me," he pleaded, going so far as to clasp his hands as if in prayer. "Please. I... just need a little more time. I've been hiding from him for so long."
"Yes, please. Bring two cups of coffee," John requested, then turned to Sherlock and said, "Jacques makes the best coffee outside of France. One of the reasons I lured him away from his previous employer."
"I wasn't planning on it," Lestrade replied. "First because no crime has been committed, and second because I'm in Homicide, as you well know, and not Organised and Economic Crime - but now you've made me curious."
An arrogant smile curled the mayor's lips. "I don't trust anyone, if it can be avoided. I prefer to concur with the philosopher, general, and strategist Sun Tzu:
"What did I say? The truth," John answered with a laconic shrug. "I told him it wouldn't be possible to keep you out of my business dealings since you're my chief accountant."
He wasn't able to fulfil all the criteria - but two out of three wasn't bad. He'd made worse decisions in the course of his life. Remaining under the same roof with John yet not being with him was strictly out of the question; it was simply not an option.
"Keep it together, Sherlock," he reminded himself quietly. "He's not coming to you because you're some kind of mewling, devoted lap dog, but rather..." He broke off somewhat helplessly. It was still a mystery to him what exactly John saw in him. "Keep it together," he murmured again, squared his shoulders and stepped back from the window.
"All right... everything looks fine," John said after a short while, when he'd given Sherlock as careful and as thorough an examination as he could in the circumstances. "Maybe you should use some ointment for the next few days. Something with witch hazel should be good... Do you have anything?"
"Oh, is that so?" John grinned. He was enjoying the exchange more now. The tension and gravity had disappeared. John found he was still hungry, and took another portion of mashed potatoes.
John took a deep breath and turned his attention away from his inner monologue, directing it once again to his immediate surroundings.
The diamond smuggling job had gone off without a hitch. The gemstones had already been distributed to trustworthy partners who would ensure that the hot goods were rendered untraceable and put on the market. The coffers would be full again soon. The coup had been worth it. His reputation within the mob would gleam with its former brilliance once more, and he would also be better off financially in no time.
"On the bookcase. Behind the commentary on the German narcotics code. I thought we'd probably need some in here eventually."
Sherlock caught himself nodding. John had been fed up with Albright because of his constant derogatory remarks about Sherlock. When the disagreement escalated and Moran apparently saved John from Albright's '
"Maybe. I wasn't paying attention," Sherlock said with blatant honesty. "You should know better by now than to tell me important things when you're just a kiss away from me and making me wait."
The soft cotton ropes on his wrists, bound to the bedposts on both sides, held his arms in an outstretched position and made it impossible for him to touch himself. Whether intentionally or not.
A tender smile passed over John's lips, and he lifted the feeble, leaden legs off his shoulders and lowered them carefully. He pulled out of Sherlock and took the used condom off his softening member with one hand, tucked himself away and pulled up the zip of his trousers. He used the other hand to keep Sherlock steady on the table, as a precaution. Once he was more or less presentable again, he slid his hands under Sherlock's shoulders and pulled him into a sitting position, where he then removed the wrinkled, damp shirt from his sweaty shoulders.
"Thanks," John said out of the blue, his voice raw. "Thank you for playing for me. I think I can sleep now..." He yawned as if in confirmation. "And that's what I need most. I'll go to Albright first thing tomorrow... and make him... see … reason..."
True, he wasn't anywhere near as breathtaking as he had been that evening when his approaching orgasm had ruddied his skin and made his eyes gleam as John's arms encircled him. But even now there was a light in his face, and he looked... happy.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, but then he went over to the couch directly across from John's armchair and sat down. He reached out for the box and pulled it across the coffee table so it was closer to himself.
But then, without any warning, he was suddenly hit by the desire for Sherlock to finally trust him. Completely. Wholeheartedly. To tell him everything... to confess everything... John mercilessly choked off the unbidden thought. He wasn't about to get Sherlock's complete trust today... but at least Sherlock was going to entrust his physical self to John completely. Because that was exactly what John had needed for days now... Sherlock's surrender... Sherlock's pain... Sherlock's pleasure.
I'm afraid of." He took an audible breath. "No matter who it is behind this entire fucking mess, he's doing a damn good job."
And there it was again – Sherlock's upfront, direct honesty that even included himself. And without intending to, John realised that he was once again running the danger of finding that particular characteristic of Sherlock's much more attractive than it actually was – or than it had a right to be.
John slipped out of his jacket. Underneath it, he was wearing only a black t-shirt on account of the summery conditions, along with the shoulder holster and his handgun. His eyes remained fixed on Charlie, who paled even further in his bonds. Without looking away, he handed his jacket to Naresh, who draped it over his arm and stepped back again. Then John held out his arm, and the one-metre long, rounded iron bar was promptly delivered into his waiting hand. His fingers closed around the cool metal.
"No, John!" Sherlock cried out as loudly and vehemently as was possible for him in his current position. John actually did fall silent, but Sherlock still had no idea what he should say until the perfect thing occurred to him.
Moriarty nodded, flattered. "Don't forget the bomb at the ball was concealed in a sculpture made of frozen water. And Dimmock... it was a crying shame his car didn't fall into the Thames or at least ram a fountain. That would have made it perfect."
"You haven't noticed before?" John retorted with a lopsided grin. "Come on..." he said. He carefully removed Sherlock's fingers from his trousers and held his hands. "Stand up."
The next time the office needed cleaning, things went pretty much as expected. Following a venomous sidelong glare that Anthea must have assumed - wrongly - Sherlock wouldn't notice, the two maids set to work on the furniture with cleaning rags and polish while Thomas hoovered the floor.
John closed his eyes and saw one door after another slamming shut in his mind's eye... one exit after another being blocked...
"Albright?" John asked. Hopefully he wasn't having a heart attack … Out of the corner of his eye, John noted that Moran was standing at an angle just behind him. What was that about? He also saw that Naresh wasn't letting Moran out of his sight, though, so he directed his full attention back to Albright, who was gasping for breath.
"You also didn't give me permission," Sherlock retorted, biting his lower lip. His hands clenched down around his own thighs, apparently in an attempt to keep them away from his twitching erection.
"But I..." He licked his lips nervously. "I'm still..." He broke off, blinking several times in confusion before continuing: "What should I tell Miss Adler?"
"Gone," Irene answered shortly, registering a split second too late how Sherlock's eyes widened in horror, and hurried to assuage his fears. "No reason to panic. I bring good tidings! Before he left, he came to see me and set up regular appointments with you," Irene crowed. "Starting immediately, you can look forward to seeing your Doc every Wednesday and Sunday from five to seven PM." Her eyes slid over Sherlock, who was still lying nude on the couch, displaying all the signs of sexual gratification. "Mmhhh... yummy," she said with a broad wink.
"You've done shit," Albright interrupted him rudely. "What other explanation is there for my nephew..."
"What are you up to, Sherlock?" Mycroft asked. Sherlock could virtually hear the creases in his brow. "Are you looking for your next...
"But this time... I'd rather have a real fuck with a real orgasm," Sherlock voiced his wish. Although he seemed slightly unsure, he raised one eyebrow in an arrogant manner, as if to say:
"How can you be sure I'll tell you the truth?" Moran sneered. "I could tell you God knows what. People do that sometimes. Especially under torture."
Sherlock's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, but he remained standing where he was, not budging a single millimetre. "If you'd like, you can start with the riding crop."
– was the main attraction; he was the one who deserved all the attention. John put him first. He, Sherlock – not John's sex organ and its gratification.
John unfolded his hands, showing his annoyance and disbelief with the gesture. “Why does everyone automatically think I'm talking about murder whenever I...” He took a deep breath. “I simply want to propose a business deal.”
"I'd say you're wet enough," John said in a dry, mocking tone. "But go ahead, it's up to you. And now get started before I change my mind."
"I lost face in front of my opponent. And it's all your fault. If anyone finds out about it... I'm finished." He took a deep breath before giving Sherlock a pained look. "Why didn't you say anything?"
Mike watched the two men exit with an expression of mild interest. Once the door had closed behind them and he heard their footsteps receding up the stairs, he clicked his tongue in disapproval. He had to admit, though - that Sherlock did have a head for numbers.
"Get your clothes off and get on the bed," he ordered, more curtly than he'd intended. But at least Sherlock obeyed without any more cheeky comments.
Sherlock lowered his head gratefully and let the compacted ash fall into John's open hand. He drew his tongue back in and closed his mouth.
John continued to watch him with a cold, impassive stare, but his mouth lost some of its hardness when he spoke again: "But since I … sympathise with the reasons for your incorrigible behaviour up to a certain point..."
John snorted softly. "No, he won't. If I know him, he's up there pacing like a tiger in a cage, flagellating himself because he thinks he put me in a compromising position in front of my guests or some such nonsense."
Where was the fun in forcing a yes-man, a bootlicker, or a brown-noser to his knees? But to wrestle someone like Sherlock to the floor … Sherlock, who was headstrong and presented a challenge, not just on a sexual level but on an intellectual one as well - that was much more interesting and exciting.
Sherlock, surprisingly, followed the instructions as meekly as a lamb, and John watched, holding his breath, as his finger slid practically without effort into the enticing body. Just as John was about to congratulate himself ... just as John thought the worst part was over and the rest would be child's play... Sherlock gasped for air, and every single muscle in his body seized up.
"If you only knew..." John panted softly, and Sherlock tapped his tongue against the tip of John's erection, enjoying every moment. "How incredible you look... your mouth..."
Sherlock lay there as peacefully as if he were already dozing. But he couldn't be. He'd just been calling out for '
"Blond. Tall. Close-set eyes. Square chin," he murmured absently to himself. He tapped some keys with nimble fingers and forwarded the message to his own phone. His pocket buzzed as the message arrived, and he clenched his teeth in order to curb the effect the vibration had on him.
Sherlock respiration increased and he automatically pressed himself even closer to his beloved, imagining what it would be like if he had not just one but both nipples pierced... and if John attached a couple of pretty little weights to them... how it would feel if...
“Im-pressive,” John stammered, slightly taken aback, but he gathered himself quickly. “Then I can change my diagnosis from
Sherlock's relief was all but tangible, and John realised that this impossible man had been worrying over nothing again.
John listened to the entire sermon in a state of speechlessness. When Sherlock was apparently finished, he burst out, “When exactly did they fill your brain with shit? What the hell is going on here?! I've bought you out, and you're giving me my marching papers?! Three days ago you were completely normal!”
"Must it be this house every time?" Mycroft asked with the demeanour of the long-suffering. "Couldn't we meet somewhere else? Anywhere else?"
"You'd do better with a chamomile tea at the moment," Mike advised him. "I think I have some valerian drops in my bag."
"What are you talking about?" Sherlock asked, feeling his cheek with a sense of foreboding. When he discovered the traces of lipstick on his fingers, he yelled at her in horror: "Have you gone completely insane?!"
He'd used this special technique several times, but it was still a strange sensation to feel something alongside his penis – even if it was just his own finger. There was still something filthy about it... and that thought still increased John's excitement every time. How must that fullness and pressure feel inside Sherlock's compliant yet still inexperienced arse?
real,” Sherlock interrupted. “You don’t think my cock is ugly or disgusting.” He suddenly looked vulnerable. “Do you?”
"John didn't throw me out and he never will," Sherlock declared hotly. "And even if he did... I'd live on the streets a thousand times over again before crawling back to you."
John turned around. "And all we can do is stand there and watch with our thumbs up our arses because we'd be taken down for so much as one small hit," he cried bitterly. "I can't run a business like this!"
John suddenly fell still beside him. Unnaturally still. Sherlock lifted his head to look at him, but John had already pushed him away and left the bed.
John gave him an indulgent smile. "I suppose you can get things set up in the new bathroom. I'd really prefer it if
Warm lips covered Mycroft's neck above his shirt collar, leaving a burning trail on his skin. Then all of a sudden everything was gone. The lips, the hands, the warmth, and the closeness. Mycroft blinked in confusion. But Greg had just bent over to retrieve a small cardboard box out of one of the pockets in his jacket, which he now handed to Mycroft.
John gave him a faint smile. "My chauffeur's giving me a lecture on etiquette? I really do only employ back-talkers. Spit it out, Bridges. What's your first name? I promise not to laugh."
"Don't be ridiculous," Mycroft retorted brusquely, noting to his own great annoyance that it now really did look as if he were jealous.
Mycroft getting nice and cosy in his office... more flashbacks... and a reunion with one Gregory Lestrade!
He'd hardly had time to lean back in the chair again before Sherlock sank down onto him, pushed into him with a soft whimper, tried to grind against him and finally pressed his soft lips onto John's mouth in a sinful kiss.
And no matter how their relationship might develop - or not develop - in future... Sherlock didn't intend to ever leave John. A life without John had become unimaginable - unthinkable - for him. If John ever wanted to get rid of him, he'd probably have to resort to drastic measures.
Sherlock knew right away that John was referring to that fatal day when he'd sent Glendale packing and maltreated Sherlock himself.
Greg now stood directly in front of the desk, where he leaned forward, his eyes glittering. He grabbed Mycroft's tie and used it to pull him closer.
"John?" Sherlock groaned. "John... I... you... oh my God... you... ohgodohgodohgod... John... John... John... I... I'm coming... I'm coming... I... JOHN!"
All of a sudden, John recalled with perfect clarity that day in Irene Adler's house when he'd pointed his gun at Sherlock. Sherlock had told him to shoot then too. And Sherlock hadn't shown any fear back then either. But John hadn't been able to pull the trigger.
' he thought to himself, not without a certain amount of irony. It was probably an act of defiance - or a way to prove something to himself - that caused him to spend an inordinately long time choosing his clothes today. A dark grey suit... with a light blue... no... a white shirt... socks, underwear... He took his time getting dressed quite deliberately, straightened everything carefully in front of the mirror, gave the box one last glance, waited until the stabbing sensation inside him receded, and then walked out of the room without looking back.
John hit the spot once again with implacable accuracy, and once again Sherlock screamed out his rapture and his agony to the world. There was a hand in his hair again... a mouth on his shoulder... kisses... and then the explosion of desire. Sherlock felt the ring of muscle around his hole open and close up again... and again... like a cramp... every contraction sending a fresh wave of lust through his body. The pain was nothing more than a side effect of his concupiscence. One last tremor shuddered through his body, and then the endorphins which virtually flooded his bloodstream effected a sensation of relaxation he'd never experienced before. Everything in him, every part of him, became loose and light and floaty.
The dark silk wrapped around his head like a gentle breeze, robbing him of his sight. His heart rate increased almost immediately, and a wave of panic rolled through his brain. Hadn't he just thought it couldn't possibly get any worse? How could he have been so wrong? He turned his head from one side to the other with frantic motions. Where was John? Why couldn't he hear him?
"You've sure landed yourself a pretty little whore with that one," he remarked, his tone so markedly casual that it was clear to everyone how disparaging it was really meant to be. "Must have cost you a pretty penny. But if he's as good with his mouth as he is with numbers..." Albright shrugged his shoulders with urbane candour.
Sherlock had known it. He'd known from the start what he was getting into. Still, he'd hoped. He'd hoped just a tiny bit that there would be something more. What that
Sherlock's attentive eyes slid over John, and rather than obeying without hesitation as he had up to now, he said, "In a moment." Then he went over to John and put his arms around him.
had faded. Mabel Turner acknowledged the fact with a wistful sigh. She was just picking over a bowl full of strawberries, visibly moved, when Jacques entered the kitchen. He had been in the cellar and was holding a bottle of wine in each hand, which he set down carefully on the kitchen table.
you..." A smirk crossed her lips. "Did you notice the word play? Excruciating?" But when she saw Sherlock's furious gaze, she turned more serious again. "Believe me, that's not the reason you're still here with him. The reason is that he loves you."
This story has kept both you and me in suspense for nearly a year, and it's really hard for me to let the boys go off on their own now. But after the epilogue, they're going to have to muddle through the rest without their author.
"What happened?" he asked calmly, and John told him everything. Even how unprepared he'd been for the shot that came through the window. How shocked he'd been inside. He was almost about to tell Sherlock about how helpless he'd felt in that situation, but a strong sense of shame held him back. He knew that Sherlock thought he was perfection personified, and he didn't want to shake that faith thoughtlessly. Not unless it were necessary. Fortunately, Sherlock's curiosity spared him that fate.
"I'll be back sometime this evening," John went on. "If you need anything, just ring and one of the staff will take care of it." He jerked his thumb in the direction of a discreetly placed button next to the desk. "There's a bell like that in every room. Also leftover from the previous owner. It's rather practical. So..." He bent down to Sherlock once more and gave him a quick kiss. "See you tonight." John stroked his hand over Sherlock's hair one last time, and then he was gone and Sherlock was alone - all alone in the big house, which seemed even emptier without John's presence.
Mike's eyes got round, only to narrow a moment later. "Being polite? Excuse me if I don't buy that. I know my wife! In order to give her that reaction, you'd need to do a bit more than invoke the usual level of courtesy."
Luckily, though, it was possible to banish it almost completely from his consciousness. Because he really didn't want to think about it.
He was going to vouch for his own safety... he was taking this step of his own accord and following considerable deliberation, so it was consensual... that just left
“All right,” Sherlock said hoarsely, licking his lips in a vain attempt to moisten them. Shortly thereafter, he found the ends of both ropes in his mouth, and he clenched his teeth down on them as if his life depended on it.
"Maybe," John conceded. "But I wanted to pay. After all, they invited me to have a glass of rum too. Happy?"
took place on the first and second floors, and the lounges on the ground floor where guests could become acquainted with the house's offerings, the building contained three studio flats on the third floor, each with their own cooking niche and bath.
"So it is a secret," Mycroft determined smugly. "I'm not quite certain, but the last time I cared to check, secrets weren't one of the guarantees for a stable relationship."
Then Sherlock heard clothing hitting the floor and a zip being opened. His buttocks were pulled roughly apart with cold hands. A fleeting swipe over his anus, and then...
Sherlock licked the fingers one last time before pulling back with an obscene slurp, moving as if in slow motion.
Sherlock poked at his beans disconsolately before finally pushing his plate away without so much as a single drop of the sauce touching his lips.
John sat up again, his gaze wandering over Sherlock's deferential posture, until it landed between his legs. A leer spread across his face.
"Hey... don't fall over..." he exclaimed when Sherlock swayed without making any effort to steady himself. Sherlock reached for the edge of the sink with a sullen grumble.
"Such a randy little slut you are," John growled, slamming into Sherlock's willing, unresisting body in a fast, hard rhythm.
John licked his upper lip nervously. Why wasn't Sherlock saying anything? Did he not like it? Of course, he didn't and was just too polite to say anything. No, stop... since when was Sherlock polite? But he'd probably expected a more... romantic present for the occasion. Okay, that was a little... weird. After all, they weren't in a romantic relationship and...
," he hurled at Mycroft, elegantly avoiding the fact that he actually had bought Sherlock from Irene Adler (or at least planned to). "To
John allowed the impetuous contact, yet didn't reciprocate in any manner. But Sherlock didn't mind. As the tension and mental anguish of the past few days fell away, a boundless relief flowed through him. John's mere presence and existence were entirely sufficient for him at the moment. He greedily inhaled John's scent, absorbed it, and analysed it without even thinking.
"You haven't said it to him either?!" she cried out, aghast. "I really don't know what to do with you anymore!"
"Hello, Mummy... it's me... Yes. I know. No, I... Of course, after the attack I do have more important things to do than call you. I simply thought it might interest you that I'm doing well... At the charity bazaar? I didn't know that... All right, I
The interplay of hot and cold, of shock and pleasure, caused John to cry out softly. The sight before him did the rest, releasing several erotic associations in John's brain. His hips jerked and Sherlock took in John's erection deeply, until John felt the tight, willing throat around the head of his penis. Then Sherlock swallowed, and John panted with bliss. He tossed his head back against the hard edge of the chair back and bit down on his lips.
"Judging by your charming mood, you must have finally informed your wife that you want a divorce," Mycroft said dryly and handed the cup back to Greg. "Alcohol isn't the answer."
White skin on blue sheets... a spring breeze wafting in through the open windows... warm and fragrant... airy, billowing bedcurtains of a gauzy material in the same shade of blue as the walls and sheets... their own blue cocoon... as endless as the sky... as the sea... as a dream... the smell of sweat and semen... Sherlock's sweet cries...
The last few bars of the opera faded away, and John looked up in surprise. Had so much time passed already? Had he really been sitting here that long? So lost to the world in this cocoon of dominance and surrender? And how long had Sherlock been sitting between his legs rather than next to them? He checked briefly whether Sherlock's fingers were still warm and well supplied with blood, then leaned back again in relief. John combed his fingers through Sherlock's unruly curls in a familiar gesture borne of affection, pulling lightly on them and forcing Sherlock to sit up a bit.
"Would you rather do it yourself?" John asked. "I'm really afraid I'll hurt you. I shouldn't have left the ring on so long..."
"No, that's true." John went to the door, but turned back to Mycroft before he got there. "There's one thing I'm dying to know, though - how the hell did you win that election? It shouldn't have happened. I paid off everyone who's anyone, greased palms, handed out bribes..."
However, the slight, involuntary twitches in his eyelids – which John couldn't fail to notice this time either – undid all of his attempts at appearing cool and impassive, betraying his nervousness to any observant viewer.
"I hope my little omission won't have any effect on our working together," Mycroft's cultivated, controlled voice piped up.
“Conditions? I don't think I heard you right. Who do you think you are, trying to set conditions with me?! You are without a doubt the most insolent, bald-faced, impertinent little cocksucker I've ever...” A deep kiss – one he hadn't seen coming – choked off the end of his outburst.
"Oh, no need to mope over it," John declared with a patronising air. "I have something else I think you're going to like. What would you say if I mopped up the Chinese and Russians a bit? Maybe a lot? Then you'd only have to deal with me."
