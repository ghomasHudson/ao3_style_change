Heading down to Sherlock’s room, John began to feel his nerves drift away and excitement took their place. This was an opportunity he was highly unlikely to get again, the opportunity to be close to Sherlock and show him how he honestly felt but in subtle ways. Some might call it taking advantage of a situation but the detective did that all the time. Now it was John’s turn. Of course it wasn’t something he was doing with malicious intent, far from it. Looking at it realistically, he just wanted to show Sherlock quite how much he is loved. When John saw Sherlock’s shock at him giving up his possessions in exchange for his life, he wanted nothing more than to tell the detective then and there that he meant the world to him. They were best friends, partners, flatmates… He had become quite taken with the brunette in recent years as well… How could Sherlock not see the obvious? Then again, it was hardly a surprise, Sherlock Holmes could read an entire life story from the condition of a jumper yet he could never tell when someone cared for him. Sighing, John headed into the room and was greeted by the rather appealing sight of a shirtless Sherlock half covered by what seemed to be a thin silk sheet, “I hope you are wearing pants under there” he teased, although there was a slight question to the comment. Sherlock was hardly known for being the most modest man on the planet and it would hardly surprise John if the other did turn out to be entirely naked although it might make sleeping beside him much more difficult than it was already going to be. He would have heard Sherlock’s eyeroll a mile away and couldn’t help but chuckle as he slid in beside.him. He almost went to cuddle up to him on instinct but managed to stop himself, unsure as to whether or not that would be welcomed. Last night seemed like a more intimate occasion, what with the near death experience and all, tonight seemed more casual.
In the eyes of most, listening in to other people’s conversations and activities would be considered as rude and unacceptable, to Sherlock this was not the case. He found that he was far more capable of understanding others by observing rather than getting to know them the traditional way. He listened to all of John’s manic clattering around the kitchen and heard Mrs.Hudson paying them her usual visit just to check in. Sometimes that woman seemed more of a mother figure than a landlady. It was odd, thinking back on it, Sherlock appreciated her far more than his own mother. Despite all of his indiscretions and the drugs and the cases, Mrs.Hudson was always there, the pillar of 221b. Smiling to himself, Sherlock found he had gotten distracted in his own thoughts before his heard a surprising sound, a knock on the door. Oddly enough, that sound made him panic, he even jumped slightly. Why was he suddenly nervous? That was odd. It was just John, not some maniacal killer or lunatic, yet he felt fear. What could it be? He hadn’t done anything wrong, nor was he hiding any secrets, he was dressed and laying in bed, yet a cold sweat broke out on his brow and his heart rate increased noticeably. Frustrated, he reached up and ruffled his hair vigorously, hoping to calm himself a little. Sitting up, he shuffled back to rest comfortably before calling out, “Come in”. The door swung open slowly and Sherlock calmed instantly at the sight of his blogger, shuffling in a little clumsily with a tray of breakfast. The nervous smile on his face made Sherlock’s chest tighten a little and the compulsion to comfort the man stirred in him. “You made breakfast” he pointed out matter-of-factly.
He never let anything take control of him again, outside of what he could step away from.(nicotine patches were not near as good as smoking, but he currently had a full, undamaged sense of smell. Drugs still helped him focus... before he found other means to direct his focus that did not leave him needing something that could be watered down or tampered with).
They had stopped looking outside and held onto their bag straps looking, then smiling at each other.
John was helping Sherlock wind down from a case that they were able to get solved, even with a short time limit of such. At the very last minute, a flight takeoff had been stopped,and the perpetrator arrested and taken out.
Wasn't sure what to do with this,then I thought of a song I heard long ago,Never Forget by Lena Katina, and thought that's sad, but maybe something poetic could be made?
John had been awake for some time now, and was back to thoughts of coffee. There was a heavy weight laying on top of his right arm that for once, was an entirely relaxed deadweight.
'He's stressed out and maybe needing clarity on several things. Just what I thought,he needs to be shown directly.'John thought, starting to pull on the belstaff.
Sherlock rolled his eyes,but that did help verify a few things for him. Fortunately,he pays very good attention to detail, and was taking notes in layers during his last feeding.
It still had 221B below it,but the building been blown up,torn down,rebuilt, redesigned and added to before another rebuild. That last one was only 200 years ago, but time flies when you stop staying dead.
"Ok,we have a bit of time, I'll help you into what you should be wearing, and I can check the progress of a few areas while I'm at it" John said as he moved Sherlock into his room.
John had long put the furniture back where it belonged, and had changed out of the right,skimpy costume and washed the oily,sweatproof make up off.
He then took off his shoe and tied the laces to the spots on the sides on and near the pin on the explosive.
"Just chasing after more family members,to see where they end up. Of course no one saw or recognized me, but it still hurts being a doctor and knowing I can't save or do a thing about saving some" John said,a bit too stoicly.
John had left earlier in a Doctors uniform and bags. He had work that could not be put off. The now toddler,was being kept elsewhere, and away from all that was in the living room.
"I would like that very much" Sherlock said, blushing slightly before rubbing his hands on his face and getting back to his normal,blanked look.
Sherlock sat in his chair with a cup of tea,while John sat with his already on the side table after putting Rosie in her playpen.
Of course Sherlock was using it,and seemed glad to see him, but jittery. He had no one with much maturity or understanding to talk to,and she would give calm, smiling looks and still show she wasn't listening to him at all. This, and no cases at all!
"So you choose NOW to not follow basic orders when I just made and brought us TEA!" John said,as he stepped in front of the table. He looked at Sherlock with a straighter back and a stern look, before it was followed with an almost grin and a gleam in his eyes .
The suspect had seemed to be only armed with a knife in one boot.Once Sherlock had run after him, caught up,and tackled him, he turned within his grip and knocked his fists hard on his ears.
All spouses with serious injuries. All soon spoke up in thier countries about the lack of solid support in seeking help with the abuse.
"I don't have anything to do with his work, and would like it if he would quit trying to get his fingers all over mine. What are you really here for?" Sherlock said, frustrated and standing up.
This turned out to have a lot of darkness,but neither of the boys is so much as scratched too much at the end
Sherlock rolled his eyes and parallel parked. All this over jewelry! Sentiment with some people! He unbuckled and leaned over as John undid his seat belt.
"Because he is human and an engineer, that's why he is in yellow. Your character works more medically,so you are in blue, and have Vulcan ears because who your going as is not" Greg explained, before giving them thier folded outfits.
What kind of objective science is not open to testing results and many possible reactants, even with your own blood?
"The new Ethiopian restaurant right by the Tybern, you heard of it?" Sherlock asked,still seemingly jittery in his seat as he buckled his seatbelt. He gave John a quick glare as he flattened his palms against his thighs, still unsettled.
Why John followed the freak around,and even had a blog about the cases (very cencered and kept unclear in parts for safety) she would never know.
"Really no need to......*purr*...." John said. He was already amazed and content to come back to such later before he lost the voice to speak.
"I would like to know when the repair people will get here,so at least we can get enough power to do more than flush toilets." He turned, looking at Sherlock."Would you like some coffee?I can get it set up to brew over the fire....and we do have plenty of eggs to work through"...
'Oh yes, he'll be feeling much the next few days, but it turned out to oddly help with nerves. He really DID need to be shown directly who loved him and where he belonged. I should start wiping and rinsing where there's bits of leftover oils and such congealing on both tables, the counter, the floor, by that plant...cleanup because I had to work up nerve to act on the obvious...'
A helicopter soon landed on the spot on the roof and the pilot waved them over without turning anything off.
He had told John where he kept the plastic, sealable test tubes and sterilized syringes by his microscope.
Memories of what he went through in his 'death' to keep those he cared for safe. Memories of John's short, disasterous marriage soon after he had returned. The anger. Many times feeling like he had to remind others that he was 'not gay'.
John tearfully ran his fingers through dark curls. They were definitely tangled,but he had missed this too.
Sherlock fed the ropes while John kept them untangled as he used rods sticking out the side of the crank to turn it like a steering wheel.
Sherlock gave a frustrated look back at John before raising his hands and adopting a similar stance, " You can call my brother Mycroft, but he is rather busy. And I just want to return this key to him," Sherlock said, holding up his 221B key. "I'll just leave it on his desk and walk out, you can talk to John here and he can fill you in with anything else you might want to know."  John's eyebrows quickly crawled up.
"Among other things John. I couldn't ask Lestrade or Anderson to help me with the sparring. I know you can fight, and we have done one dance when I showed you the waltz. This should come easier to you, and there will be too much costume for anyone to ever recognize you. Just keep in mind"
"John said this was about your daughter?" Sherlock looked from the woman to the man and back before the man smiled.
He was now beyond that as well. He even got back to using sex and favors for himself now, and not just a numb means towards anything else.
John eventually,as time and fighting,both physical and mental,kept going,shot the home made explosive. That was enough to blow up the room, and anything built on the ground above.
Early the next morning, both residents showed back up without Rosie. John talked about having today off, and cooked both of them a hearty breakfast. Sherlock seemed unsteady,but ate much more than he usually did,which John encouraged,but kept watch and patted his back when he swallowed too quickly.
John saw a bellows set near the what looked to be an empty stove. He opened the door, then rolled his eyes to get wood stacked in front of a partial wall by the kitchen as another boom and roll of thunder could be heard.
"The isolation has made some too lazy it seems. Many serial numbers match, one doesn't, and a few are for games only. Seems we're coming up to a house that may not be used often, but it looks good to tourists. Let's keep going. If it goes where I'm sure it does, we can take a quick look before finding a way down to a quick walk to Mycroft's holiday house on the coastline.”
It was soon seen chased by something larger and light, silvery grey. None of the ones below the scene thought it worth much looking at for more than a laugh before leaving themselves.
John smiled. He had long washed the emptied pot(as well as the plates of scrambled eggs he made,much of Sherlock's barely touched and stored in plastic back in the fridge),but it was true. Even trapped there,they had little luxuries here and there.
They were dropped off right by the building they were at earlier. Sherlock, carrying his own bag, pulled John with him in the alley.
"Your brother was very helpful in that" Greg said with a smile before turning to leave. "You can change in the bathroom, and there is an accountant and a secretary that offered to help if you have any costume issues and need small adjustments. The convention starts in the next two hours,but if you get there early and blend in with the other fans,you may be able to get an eye for Jessica or anything else troublesome that may occur. Several photographs are in the folder I gave you John, and maybe you could help this turn out smooth. The tickets are in the bag as well, you'll need them" he said before he quickly left out of hearing range for John and Sherlock.
He thought of past highs with cocaine. This was very different, but still a high. Much more visual,he thought as dark spirits danced in the rain around him as he climbed,but even when he used THAT for further focus, he had learned,over time how to keep control over his mind. Enhanced in some ways, but still his territory no one or nothing else should be allowed to alter without his own encouragement.
"*Yawn* Morning. Coffee with sugars?" Sherlock said, stumbling behind and wrapping his arms around John.
Sherlock gave a thumbs up. Setting the cup on the table, John took the samples out of the mug. He looked Sherlock in the eye again, and showed a tea bag in one hand, and the wrapped coffee sample in the other.
"By the time she was promoted to work under me,she was still too young and immature. I made her work harder before I could trust her. I joked that she was like having a little sister around, and though she did get around the barracks, I made it clear she and problematic soldiers like her were never allowed near mine. Now can I get a quick shower or do I have to make you move?"
Sherlock seemed busy in his mind palace again, which was understandable. This case turned out to be a disappointing let down after he was so excited the day before.
"I work late,come home, and you couldn't find someone who is actually a professional in this to help you fight 'safely' to expose a wrestler worldwide who has crippled his wife?" John had to ask, to try and make sense of any of it.
John quickly followed, but the idea crossed his mind. The area is heavily guarded with the government council going on next door, but of course Sherlock can just work around it at his convenience AGAIN and not cause any real upset. The impulse to giggle almost knocked him off balance, but John knew better than to draw attention towards them.
The open area revealed was not only dryer, but even branched off to rooms with carpet and computers that were safely not even on.
No! He would think it wasteful and foolish! John let his plastic spork fall and looked at what was left of his lunch. This was foolish. From what he had seen on cases, Sherlock was very aware of what sex could do, but used it as a means to an end. When he let his transport bother with it at all.
"No,you don't"John said, and pushed him back in a sitting position."I'll be working on your back, and I need you flat for that"
Lestrade dropped Sherlock and John back home,where they had talked about getting Rosie back from staying with Mrs. Hudson. What was collected will go to labs,which objectively show what there is to show, they will all see.
A few years later, a big fight had John, Sherlock,and Moriarty finding ways to fight 2 to 1 in an underground room to free hostages with bombs attached to them far away.
"Your still small enough we could get in trouble if you don't wear it" John grumbled, grabbing the car seat in the hand he was not holding hers with and headed towards the stairs.
"Don't get caught" Sherlock smiled before moving to a dumpster in an alley,three roads down from the taped scene.
"Run down? Not too much, I'm just not used to going after criminals that are that small and this limber. We should keep an eye on her in case she decides to become one,she could give them a run for thier money" Sherlock said with a smile.
John had taken his small knife, carefully put it through the seam work along the inside of the leg ankle, and let it slowly move upwards, cutting seams until the knife was close to Sherlock's groin. He then repeated the action with the other leg, leaving a narrow patch to cover between Sherlock's legs.
"Speaking of your brother sir,he knows we're here as ambassadors to some trades going on between different parts of a business we would like to expand further with" the man said.
John had not known if Sherlock would be up for a cup of tea or not after his shower, but he was so used to making two and Sherlock was not known for sleeping much while he was working. Keeping the habit worked out.
"I didn't like that snakes were chased away,that isn't always needed. That's why you had to be pinned to the table thoroughly. I didn't need any more of the worst dates around chasing you off and making you sad, Again" Sherlock then looked at John and took his own sip of coffee.
"You are here,with Watson upstairs and away from further danger because you can't and don't just forget. You learn from it and keep going where you are very needed." Sherlock mumbled and drew back to where he could look John in the face.
"After Rosie getting so upset, I got out and made another blanket on her bed. She should sleep pretty soundly now unless noise picks up again and the ice starts hitting hard. Tea?" John asked.
Soon the metal from the candles and trashcan radiated enough heat that they were able to cuddle in comfort, even with the rain,then ice, pounding outside.
John set the clothes down and made sure Sherlock's snoring, naked form was properly tucked in the bed right. Pillow under head, blanket over body and not rolled in a corner. Mostly in the center of the bed. He then got the clothes, found more socks under the bed, and set everything outside of the room before locking the door.
Being trapped in a house with a toddler had it's own up and down turns, but he let her sleep upstairs and kept the fire going.
"The Woman was nice to battle wits with,but she knew about you. Janine, like other cases which required reaching far, was too easy to work with, and was barely worth the challenge. You are not a means to an end,and if you ever feel like I am falling back to those tendencies,you can end this and still have my respect"
"Will you stir,and throw a leg in the fire John?" Sherlock said, pointing to the stack but not stirring or looking away.
"If I will what? Oh yes,my clothes" Sherlock quickly looked away and dug inside the bag, embarrassed. No telling what would get back to Mycroft if he let himself get distracted so easily by something so simple and basic.
From the door of the beach house, a shorter blonde man came out, holding a bowl of something. He smiled at the taller man and shoved the bowl in his hands, pointing at the bowl,then the puffins, swiping his hands to signal 'no', and walking back to sit on the only step at the front door to watch the man (not his brother, maybe his boyfriend?).
"We have a few q tips and a small bag in the corner here" he mentioned,as he handed Sherlock the q tips and dug further for the bag.
“Not really”, he said. “These National Socialists have destroyed all opposition so it is a dictatorship in all but name. Once there is no-one to hold a government to account, things can go very wrong very quickly. I have sold everything I had over there and I would advise others to do the same.”
“I have a replacement for you outside”, he said calmly. “You are no longer in my employment. The funds that you have sequestered from my business to fund the lifestyle you apparently think you deserve will be returned to me within the week – and you will be watched from the moment that you quit these premises so do not even think of trying to flee abroad. Otherwise you will have the 'joys' of spending a considerable length of time at His Majesty's Pleasure on top of your many other worries. Good day!”
The vehicle was stunning, done unlike my old car in sleek black all over. And engraved on the side of the car was what was my 'W' monogram, just like Sherlock had had done on my old car. I beamed.
“He has friends on the panel that decides such things, sir”, Ginger said ruefully. “We all knew that Fred Carter is stepping down as his wife inherited that house in Wales and they're moving there, but they are planning to delay the change in the rules so that that scum can apply.”
“Sir, yes sir!” he said, before throwing aside his newspaper. Right, he needed a long, hard lesson never to bring that sort of filth into our home ever again!
“Your brother is a grown man”, Mr. Holmes said quietly as the three of us sat together later. Father and Mother were, it turned out, away for the whole day so the whole sordid business could be broken to them gently when they returned, while the doctor had given poor Lion a sedative. I rarely drank (except after Sarah's parents had been round) but accepted a large whisky which I downed in one go. I was still shaking after that.
I do not think that I had ever seen a man look more condemned. Mr. Magnum looked piteously at me as if that would somehow get me to change my mind, then trudged slowly over to the table and signed his life away. It was probably wrong of the captain to draw his finger across his neck like that but... whatever.
The aftermath of the performance had been draining and had involved an overly-long interview with both the King-Emperor and the President that I would long remember. I had promised (in very bad French, corrected of course by my resident blue-eyed genius) to autograph a set of my complete works for him; by this time they were being published in at least a dozen languages including French. Both gentlemen had thanked us profusely, and I had spoken with and shaken hands with George the Fifth himself! The King-Emperor of a quarter of the known world!
Sherlock was trying his best pleading look on me. Normally I was putty in his hands over most (all right, almost all) things, but this was my professional reputation. I put my foot down.
“In my country”, the sheikh said, smiling that dangerous smile again, “we do not tolerate men who cannot treat the wives of the nation's ruler with an appropriate degree of respect. We therefore emasculate them by removing what I believe in this nation is commonly referred to as their 'two veg'.”
I finally got lucky just over a week later when Sherlock contracted a severe runny nose and had to rest on the couch all day. Although I had the correct medicines with which to treat it, I lied and said that I needed something from the chemist’s in the village as well as needing to order some of my favourite cologne from London of which I was running short (I was sure that I had had more than the single bottle that I had left but then I was never very good at keeping track of things like that as my mind was usually on far more important and mostly horizontal matters). He was obviously cross at not being able to go with me but I insisted he stay out of the driving rain. I was forced to give him a very thorough blow-job before he would let me go, but then as a doctor I had obligations to my patient which I felt obliged to fulfil. I always put my patients first.
1904. Sherlock helps out his former landlady Mrs. Malone and his friend Chem over a small matter when someone stops behaving badly. Meanwhile Lady Holmes hurts her hand.
1906. John's writings finally catch up with the stories fit to be published, and the dynamic duo take a trip that will take in another beach-hut and a room with a view (sex in both, as if you have to ask!). Plus there is more fun with costumes and a long-promised battleship.
My other message might, I suspected, take a little longer to elicit a reply so I decided to spend the rest of the day explaining to John why teasing the man that you love is generally a bad thing, especially when said love can flip the red card across the door and then spend hours reducing you to a happy pile of goo. There was something still wonderfully domestic about sitting there reading, while a gloriously naked city doctor lay there gasping on the couch trying to gather his wits.
“This is dashed awkward, John”, he said. “We have been friends since the year dot, but I have to ask you a really painful question.”
Though Sherlock and I had solved many murders in our time I was seriously considering adding one of my own to the list – the ending of whoever had written this
“I had a hunch what he was up to and I was right. He went to my sister's farm which is not far from the village of Clungunford, one of the ones that was supplying us food and drink for our time in the area. Derek came out to meet him –
“I know the fundamentals”, he said. “All that really needs clearing up is whether the actions involved were deliberate, accidental or a mixture of the two.”
“In this age of ever larger government, such philanthropy is seemingly becoming a thing of the past”. If that happens, then it will be as grave a loss to our Nation as the retirement of my father's friends, who I hope are enjoying the same peaceful and quiet retirement as my father is now set to. Thank you all.”
I paused as I passed the village pub and wondered. It was the day of my seventieth birthday, yet apart from some pretty mind-blowing sex as my morning wake-up call (which I suppose I had sort of enjoyed) I had had no present as yet. Sherlock had told me that he was having something delivered but it would not be here until later in the day. I silently cursed my increasingly slow limbs and set off up the High Street.
The sergeant nodded and moved to close the file. I saw that it actually had a photograph of Ivan attached to it and he caught me looking.
“I think”, he said, “it would be in your interests to concentrate on the money. Quite clearly five hundred pounds was paid into a bank account and then withdrawn so as to create a link with Derby. Most people do not have that sort of money lying around so someone must have obtained it somehow. The most likely way is a short-term loan; perhaps your colleagues in Derby can go round the local banks and loan sharks to see if anyone has borrowed that sum or something slightly in excess of it recently.”
1909. Sherlock meets The Next Generation – his own grandsons! There may just be the odd emotion or seven.
“Another Cornish name”, he said. “There is a village called St. Day up near Camborne. You see, the railway company did consider extending the main line but is instead starting an omnibus service between Marazion, which lies east of Penzance, and Newlyn which lies a few miles north of Mousehole.”
“Not at all”, he smiled. “You will need all the rest you can get. Tonight, I am digging out the Roman gladiator uniform.”
“My ever-watchful twin saw it coming, as per usual, and warned me to get out in time”, he said. “I passed the warning on to Carl, Luke, Guilford and Anna, but Mycroft…. he chose to ignore it.”
“I want what is best for all the boys under my care”, he said heavily. “For over ninety-nine per cent of them that is a life in the army; it is rare that the selection process lets anyone unsuitable through unless, like Scott, they get pushed in by family. He will never be a soldier, that I can guarantee, but he is still one of my boys and I care for the fellow. I am sure you can see that if the general catches up with him, it will not end well.”
It had been a nervy examination, with Miss Dallas and a fellow I had learned was one Mr. Alexander Heston, a runt of a fellow who was both the estate manager and a distant cousin of hers, waiting outside presumably in case I started issuing tickets or something! Their lack of faith had been irritating but I was a professional and I did my job. Once I had finished I went to find Sherlock.
He looked at us tearfully. Showing his usual great timeliness, Sherlock stepped in to prevent what was threatening to become a Moment.
“I think some of that legend about the stone granting increased fertility may have been true after all”, he growled his eyes dark with passion. “I am feeling the effects right now!”
All right, she had asked if he himself was coming and she had quite clearly been gearing up for a simper just in case. Some things never changed!
“I have several”, I said, perhaps stretching the truth just a little. “But I will get back to you before your session on Thursday with what I have by then, I promise. I wonder if you, sir, could show the doctor and I around your pitch? Just to get a flavour of the case, you understand.”
At the end of the previous year I had suggested to Sherlock that we might look through my and his notes on all the unpublished cases, for which we still received many requests, and see if some of them might now be able to be released to the general public. This task took rather longer than either of us had expected but in the end we were able to greatly increase the size of the Sherlock canon with a further forty cases in 'Elementary 100', from which a number of charities supporting orphans and wounded soldiers greatly benefited. Also Sherlock celebrated by greatly increasing his purchases from a certain shop in Baker Street, so I also benefited.
“It is our neighbour, Mrs. Start at 'Marseilles', Mrs. Malone said. “Her guests have been acting very strangely of late, ever since that awful Miss Wolferton arrived.”
1932. Sherlock is doing things with chocolate bars that make a certain retired medical personage wonder if he will live to see his next birthday. There is a comic interlude in London, and charismatic if questionable leaders are discussed.
The rugby-field was well-situated, with magnificent views up the coast to the huge castle on its rocky perch. John clearly knew that I had pulled the hooker aside for a reason, but kept silent. We were in the middle of the field before I spoke.
“Having had experience of such people myself”, Captain Higgins said frostily, “shot is what Mr. Magnum is likely to be when he pokes his nose outside the door of this place.”
“Plesiosaur”, the smirking know-all at the end of the table corrected. “I would have thought you of all people would believe in monsters.”
A private who discovered by chance that he was a cousin of the evil Moriarty. He went straight round to the professor to offer his services. Carlyon Holmes and Lucifer Garrick contrived a chance for him to shoot at Sherlock before the fellow was dispatched to Ireland, but when he entered Carlyon's room it ended with his commanding officer killing him.
Nick bent a little further over his cleaning at the table, clearly trying to hide a laugh. From the way that he was shaking, he was finding it difficult.
“They most definitely do not!” he said firmly. “Not just because there has always been a rivalry between the two villages, but because they think their part of the world would lose its unique character. No-one passes through Mousehole on the road to anywhere, but better transport links to the outside world would surely draw people away as we have see elsewhere. Then there is the history; Marazion and Mousehole used to be the chief ports before Penzance took over. Old enmities die hard in the country, as I am sure you have seen in your travels.”
I continued to just stare at him, speechless, although I was dimly aware that the dark clouds behind him were swiftly clearing.
“But how will she be able to follow them to London if they are only going to Marlborough?” John asked.
”, I agreed, “but she is sure to have people that she can communicate with by telegram. We need to get a move on.”
the Glasses. But I was sure that we were only away from the reception for an hour or so. Certainly not enough to have merited that eye-roll from my grandson when we returned, or for that matter Trelawney's first-pump as Harry handed him over several coins.
“At least he is over the moon now that Harry has had three sons and secured the dynasty”, our visitor grinned. “He says young Toby is the image of his father though how he can tell that from a baby..... well. I received good news about Herry too; he has been appointed chief engineer as we all hoped.”
“How did I end up with someone who uses the word 'progeny'?” I sighed, ruffling his untidy hair. It was unfair that he was still in his sixties while I was seventy-one, but when I had mentioned that fact last night he had dug out the purple panties and... well, it was going to be another order from the London shop again. And another smirking postman who did
“I doubt it”, I said. “Especially if he had had that woman and her watchdog breathing down his neck like I had until I told him to hop it because he was getting in the way and I might stop if he did not. Even if the local man had found it he might have felt compelled not to make an issue of it. Like the constable said, he too has to live with these people once we are gone.”
“Prince Pale also needed someone for the position of head of security at the embassy”, I said. “Someone with a good track record of giving orders and keeping control of, ahem, more wayward staff members.”
He picked up the Mars bar and put it in his mouth – but instead of biting off a chunk like any normal person would have done he began to suck on it almost obscenely. I suddenly found it hard to breathe.
“That is one of the less pleasant parts of a difficult case”, I sighed. “The coach of your rivals learned of your friend's preferences; I am afraid that Mr. Jukes’s predecessor as scrum-half discovered the truth and told the fellow about it, knowing him to be exceptionally narrow-minded. That was why his team broke your sport's code of honour and targeted your team-mate. When your own coach went to find out why, I am afraid that he lied to you when he said that he was thrown out of their dressing-room. His fellow coach related what he knew – greatly embellished, of course – so your coach set about ridding the team of Mr. Jukes.”
“I do not know how your fellow team-mates might take this news”, I said, suppressing a smile at his discomfort, “which is why I would counsel secrecy for the moment. Your new coach, the previous fellow's deputy, is much more open-minded but I will leave you my card if there are any difficulties. I have also had a message sent to your Mr. William Nye advising him not to come to the ground any more.”
His eyes shot open and a feral smile creased his features. In seconds he was between my legs fingering me open while I writhed above him, waiting for him to get on with it. Get on with it he very quickly did pushing in and bottoming out with a grunt then setting to work straight away by fingering my nipples with one hand and rubbing my cock with the other. There was no way I could resist such a combined assault nor did I wish to, and I was coming in minutes. I was surprised that he did not come inside of me, but when he stood on the end of the bed I realized why.
“I was hoping that you gentlemen might take an interest in a rather difficult matter that is occurring in my home parish”, he said.
I gently removed the plug and placed it on the seat before pushing quickly inside of him. It felt so good, especially as I had been deprived of this for ten long, cold days. Of course we did not couple every night but not being able to do so made this so much more fulfilling.
“I have received some grave news”, Mr. Holmes said. “We believe that Lion is so depressed that he may be considering taking his own life!”
I thought of what we still managed to do from time to time on the back seats and grinned. Until Jack, who had somehow managed to inherit his Uncle Sherlock's mind-reading abilities somehow or other, coughed pointedly.
“My friend is always very discreet about any case he undertakes”, John said reassuringly. “And we never allow anything to be published that would affect innocent people.”
This heartless villain claimed to be descended from nobility. He purchased 'Podsnappery', a house from which he planned to kill John when he visited an adjoining street, but Sherlock got there in time and Doctor Peter Greenwood took out Clay with five shots.
1929. Someone is made to see sense (even if it likely the last thing that they will see for a while) and John gets a surprise on Sherlock's birthday.
“A cab is waiting outside, sir”, she said, handing the bag to me. “Bacon sandwiches for the journey. You should make the first train North easily enough.”
The British sergeant-major is of course a legend in his own time, and Mr. Wolf's cousin Sergeant-Major Bryn Jones looked very much a typical example when we met him at the Wellington Barracks just outside the town of Hereford.  He was a tall spare fellow in his late thirties with light-brown hair and curious turquoise eyes. He seemed affable enough but that might well change, given the circumstances.
"Patients with allergies often have to rely on other things to use for lube, I'm almost out and know what to use. With you slouched over that way, I can start with the tea. It could use a quick warm up in the microwave"
John sighed,"I guess you're right. We do have cases and we do have Rosie. I don't have to lose anything while operating on anyone or showing the wrong people what could be stolen.... because we're doing a good enough job on our own." John sighed and leaned his head back "I was just hoping the meaning behind it wouldn't be so easy to lose. Especially because hardly anyone knows."
John looked at the sandwich with wide eyes, and stopped his jaw from dropping. He saw bits of the pink mix that still had some white swirls (did Sherlock mix ketchup and mayonnaise before putting it on the sandwich?), and several layers of pickles on both sides of the ham lunch meat between the bread slices.
The first pic by asleepatlast inspired all of the cuddling scenes written here, and the final pic is done by chained-to-the-mirror!
Sherlock asked if dry cleaning would be extra, but was told as a service to all of the government workers staying at the hotel for now,it would be done free of charge just this once.
"I DON'T FORGET! If I could save just save-" Sherlock sighed and put his head in his hands and sat on the steps.
"I think of you too often. Don't believe what many like to think. I know about human behavior and the hormonal surges that often guide it. We've solved murders over such. We've known those who keep blackmail checks and power control by knowing how to use it." Sherlock looked into John's eyes,with occasional jerks,but keeping his gaze steady, even as his own eyes were getting a wet sheen. "I should be long above THIS. I don't want you used against me, or staying away from your dates because your by me,but sentimental, frustrated and bored."
Sherlock was sitting on the couch before John had lowered himself to look, sitting right by him. It was easy to see that he was still busy in his mind palace,but he soon looked over.
With a bit of coffee in his system, Sherlock was acting more himself. He smiled and looked into John's eyes.
Sherlock had an easier time with his family, where he had kept distant enough and it was just accepted that he could take everything in stride and even Mycroft helped with the legality of getting much set up for very long term use.
The leader that Sherlock was able to chase after and tackle down while John was fighting, cuffing, and disarming several of the followers had fought back. The leader had pulled a knife on Sherlock.
Ok, that's long enough,so I'll end it here before I get back home and add another chapter to this set of adventures that isn't even properly started yet. Things will get fun and antsy soon.
Myconos! He put one hand over the other, and pushed with his fingers. Yes, he started out tense,but like lots of little hidden out of the way places,he was able to unwind knots that wouldn't be seen or noticed without further pressure work. They were not treasures themselves by any means,but so much felt more balanced once they were gone.
Mycroft stepped closer and quietly whispered to the guard who turned and left. Mycroft turned and walked towards Sherlock, who was going straight to Mycroft's office.
Sherlock had made a point to stay in his mind palace,or chase any unnecessary or unneeded feelings or visions with more sleep. By the time it got closer to noon, it was warmer and John blew the candles out before returning to a preferred source of steady heat.
It didn't take long before the massage had Sherlock relaxing. Well,his shoulders were smoother, and he was getting less and less tense. Of course some of the past turture scarring reminded John of the island of Santorini. He saw pictures and read about it from a magazine article one of his platoon mates had in his army days. Still beautiful in it's own right,but formed and reformed through volcanic lava.
"That will be done John," Sherlock said with a grin. "I was able to text a pilot to have us picked up from the roof on the office building next to Mycroft's. Used Mycroft's word coding and even kept outgoing address concealed so it still looks 'hidden.'" He curled the first two fingers of each hand sarcastically. "The way the government is known to. No reason anyone will look into it, we have 45 minutes to get there and get picked up on the roof. I've already called a cab here, so get the bags and head outside. Will not be long!"
Travel continues in the storm. Really,with the things I have written in multiple tales, something needs to be done to help with the weather there around the British area
When both were back at 221B, Sherlock sat at his chair and John got a cup, a packet of tea, and a sample of coffee he wrapped in a coffee filter.
In the reality outside of John Watson's head,he didn't actually make it to 3 months of keeping mostly hands off and distanced. He didn't like to leave Sherlock alone to meet clients they knew little about,but he couldn't ask him to stop consulting. He took work off earlier on several occasions afterwards so Sherlock would not be entirely unguarded, but it seemed the client base went back to being made up of the cluelessnessly upset, but harmless. /p>
Soon, John's hands were swatted away when he tried to lower his slacks. With a very renewed energy, Sherlock simply ripped them off like they were made of paper,where John was soon naked from the waist down except for socks.
The fact that Sherlock ended up dying in front of them with the bomb tied to him and laughing threats made by Moriarty made the unreasonable and unthinkable obvious fact.
The kettle started whistling and John went back towards it. He got the tea down, and put one bag in each cup before getting the heated water over them. He then got the milk to finish his.
Had to do some reaserch for this one as well,and it helped drive a plot I was clueless on what to do with
John soon had him push his sleeves up after help had finally arrived, and had checked him before closely as he could with a medical bag,an improvised lamp, and his flashlight.
Sherlock focused on his feet and a short  distance ahead as they kept walking up and along steps. He was carried up one,then more ladder steps,but his energy and something he couldn't put his mind on just wore him out and he nodded off again.
Sherlock put a hand over his shoulder, preventing John from getting up. "No need to go, drinking too much will hinder you as well,we both don't want that" he said. "You've had the rest of the wine,and I've just had a good sip of what YOU fixed me!" John shouted in frustration..
John looked at the darkness that had dripped down the back of the cabinet door. Oh yes, when Sherlock got the karo syrup...then he focused further back at the one in thought.
John closed his eyes and felt a calm type of sobriety go through him before getting out himself. He was reminded that Sherlock wasn't worried about losing anything and certainly not letting anything slip by with a kiss like that in front of a suspect's house on west main Street!
" There you have it!" Mycroft said,waving both men towards the stairs." Both of you come with us then,but YOU will be tested" he nudged a finger at Sherlock as he walked by.
That was a short, but many years later still felt like too long of an ordeal for John to put his family through. He got to the second door at the end of the stairs, and let himself in that as well.
"Have a seat! You must be Dr. Watson" she said, before sitting back at her seat " you should try the Blueberry O's, or the Unicorn Pop is pretty popular..."
John pulled Sherlock upstairs to his old room. Sherlock smiled,so John was planning on something loud? Something he wanted to start in a pristine area, with no plans on keeping it that way?
Irene was leaning down,and almost seemed snake like with the way she seemed,and the small shake of the yacht, and the way it was all oddly, suddenly connected...
Sherlock grabbed his hair, then stood straighter with his hands in front of his face, thumbs tucked under his chin.
"You have a ride here sent from a Mycroft Holmes to the local police station, he said to bring someone by the name of Sherlock with you"she said
" I don't even mind spelling things out for you, because you do learn, remember,and notice more than most. Now observe"
"Yes,if someone came by with breakfast, I stayed stark naked and you were so much as shirtless, I would not be the biggest distraction I'm afraid" John said,still smiling, pulling a shirt on over his head.
He stood in place, but then felt around him and felt where the wind had stopped nearby him. He walked closer to the stillness, and felt like he was getting closer to a warmth.
"I think this will work for you John" Greg waved and walked them over to a bag. "This didn't quite work to fit Anderson,but I think it will fit you oddly enough." He said, pulling out an orangeish yellow Star Trek uniform before turning to Sherlock. "When I told other staff that I was bringing you in on this case,they gathered a collection and went to a high end costume shop to get you this" he said, before pulling out a long,blue uniform with something oddly shaped in the other hand.
"I'm tired of this! Just record from other statements I've said on other phones! Go after the real problems! There's a girl in an abandoned cleaning closet in the hotel those two have a room at!"Sherlock yelled at Anderson who was holding his phone to record.
"Adjust yourself John! You're not making it easier for either of us! Although with your past experiences,and the fact that you can do anything at all right now...No!" Sherlock hissed, shaking his head.
" You know, historically in some parts of the world,eunics had the most affairs because they led to no pregnancies" Sherlock said calmly as he sipped his tea.
"John!" Sherlock shouted"catch her if she runs" he said before tackling this bulky, armored person to the ground.
He looked at the TV,then looked around for any headphones. He could not find a pair of those,or any place around the TV frame to plug them in at.
John walked, then started pacing beside Sherlock keeping a low, calm voice, "That is very much outside of London, he has his hands tied too. Not much is kept track of about Lundy, but there are enough tourists and visitors we can't really start an investigation without interfering. I have most of this part of the week off, but there's not even a hotel to stay in Lundy! We cannot chase anything this remotely."
John followed quick as he could. It felt safer to be away from all of the wind on a tiny high rise this far up, but it was mostly dark.
" Yes you git, I've had this set up for days,but then we've been locked inside after the last storm. I was sure you were dying for a case or a reason to get outside before the next storm hits in a few days."
Sherlock wasn't the best at such,but he understood how the heavy sounds of...now it was hail? Hitting the roof,thick windows and along the walls of the building could bring on bad thoughts and dreams from someone very unfamiliar with it all.
John smiled knowing when a good bit (but not all) is healed, Sherlock may be pacing tracks in the floor and dying to get out. He may try anything to get John to tell Lestrade to give him a case to work, but as his doctor...well,this is not the first patient he's had to enforce restraints on. Maybe the largest by far,but not the first.
"Later on, I'll have to use the bellows to keep the stove going" John said,"but for now? take your shirt off and....while your hands and arms are around me,go ahead and get mine. Direct heat can work best for now"
"Steel fists over velvet gloves. That strategy has been discussed in several bits of literature. Without you, I observed and acted. The wife I had knocked out and cuffed,and the husband I had tied with rope and zip ties before I texted Lestrade. This" Sherlock said, looking at all of the officers and investigators around " seems to be lasting too long. If they will not listen to me, I want to get some coffee, rest, and maybe the blankness of sleep. But not here"
"I'm going to spar with you and see what needs to be improved in your fighting. I don't expect you to carry a real blade on you, but in a real fight you use whatever you can get your hands on and use the same moves and balance as you do at these"
"As I stated earlier,we are safe here for the next few days. There was a mention that our client was found innocent of a robbery that at first,a competition company said he had set up himself. Fits my theory, and likely factored into creating it to begin with"
He should know she was a big girl, and not happy staying in a seat while Dada and Poplock were running around.
He curled up to a Sherlock in thought. His hospital work had its emergencies and routine, but he  could never leave this work either.
"Yes" Sherlock told the driver before looking downwards." Make it quick, we should have been there already" he said,as he gave the driver a folded cash bonus.
Sherlock listened closely, but when it got to the husband talking, John noticed the husband was watching every bit of Sherlock's seeming body language as the consultant was getting back into not keeping entirely still again.
With Sherlock rubbing along his arms,John took a few breaths and tried to keep quiet enough to not risk waking Rosie. Tears however, were still falling down his face.
"I need back up and eyes, and a bullet will travel through where you'll be. No one expects to be shot from the ceiling, so you'll be safe!" Sherlock said with an odd grin, and a distant look as his leg started tapping.
He could feel aches from his own fighting earlier now,that he knew would bruise. The chill helped keep any swelling down, but being able to cuff a follower in thier 20's to the side of a dumpster before getting someone in thier 30's knocked out in a fight and ziptied? That was not something most people his age could plan on having to deal with on a regular basis. He brushed a soapy hand carefully under his left ribcage. Oh yes,the one with the chain across his knuckles is already bruising there. That one wasn't expecting to hit someone already well trained to grab his wrist and hit back.
"I'm coming along, I'm his doctor and it's pretty clear to me what happened. Can you run the lights without the noise?" John told the ambulance crew as he stepped in.
John glared back at him, looked towards the door outside, looked back at Sherlock, and began to giggle before walking to the opened door with the torch.
John looked around. He was some place he had seen before, but was unfamiliar. There was no one else around but-
It was not long before clothes were by the stairs,in front of the fireplace...and it didn't take too long before Sherlock lost the ability to only focus with no physical distractions.
John's face turned serious, but bad habits and all, it was very fitting. At least they were staying in a place better built than the wet cave.
One that was too dedicated,or as he put it, married to his work to ever think well if his flatmate massaged his back,ran his hands along his hips...
They were there however, investigating royal scandals that had suddenly appeared and was hinted at in different news channels.
"We're home now" Sherlock took a long drink "it no longer matters. He's now for Lestrade to deal with".
As he took a few sticks and logs back, Sherlock held up the box of matches without looking away from what he was unpacking and organizing into whatever kind of manner.
"Are they someones we should know about? Should I have gotten off work earlier? What level are we dealing with here?" John whispered worringly to Sherlock.
At first, Moriarty was disappointed, because an empty box opened itself for him and stayed open. Nothing seemed to happen.
He didn't suck hard (John was too close,and it wouldn't take much for final closure IF he wanted), but moved his tounge over where John was leaking salty. Then moved his tastebuds along the base at the very bottom of John's cock while trying to breathe calmly through his nose.
In his mind,John figured he will start the clothes when the shower is over with, and maybe it's a good thing many have been staying home with the snow. He smiled,knowing there will be a fire going and Sherlock in a sheet for some time,(at least until his clothes got rewashed) and not many chances for anyone to be knocking on the door. At least until the weather started clearing up.
The tea kettle went off and John walked towards the kitchen, looking back. "I'm making the tea the way we like it. I'll be there soon and we can start by seeing if you can obey orders"
"She is quite busy with your captain in the small room on the very top,now you need to stay calm until you can be taken back to England. Also don't know when we'll get to eat again between these storms" She looked at Sherlock and gave him a slow grin." No need to worry too much,you have your captain and I have mine. I doubt yours will be interrogated too harshly.You two just need to be questioned separately,or so I was told to tell you. I'll fix myself a plate and eat here, so you wouldn't need to worry about a thing"
"We do have what we need, and there ARE tourists here at times. Can you give me what I need and I'll put it on myself? We ARE on a cliff and I don't want to upset you," Sherlock said, and John dug out the adjustable belt and carabineer and put it on.
Well,after reading more prompt tales for this month, I figured I might as well throw one in and not leave our boys entirely hanging
The violin could be heard at any time, reflecting the mood of the one playing it. Sometimes it made a calm, soothing melody. At least there were times of such when this started, almost a month ago.(far too long ago it seemed to the one who could not slip while stitching up anyone)
He washed his hair, (Mycroft also had shampoo that smelled like more than he would spend money on himself, but it was nothing like Sherlock's) before rinsing completely off.
John looked and visually traced the chaining over Sherlock to a carefully put together explosive at the back of his head.
I also know many reports of abuse are not taken seriously,do to how the abusing partner is seen as a hero or a nice,sweet type.
"Moriarty was over this it seems" Sherlock said quietly in a strained voice, looking past John's shoulder." he's done something to me. The perpetrator we were after last works under his orders. I don't know what they did, but they took steps to bring me back here to in his words,"be ugly to the eyes closest to me". Apparently my cell was put back in my coat. I was drugged for days it seems".
John felt oddly at a complete peace doing something completely outside of what he thought could ever make him happy. Not just something different. This wasn't a childish expirement or a dare, but finding beauty where he least expected it. Sherlock's mind was layered and beyond what most could....he grabbed Sherlock's hips tighter and his own body moved with barely his own mind there to actively guide it. It was something that he only found odd later and laughed about it, but his mind was only distantly there. Because all of him was there and focused on the present.
"Now that you are here John" Lestrade said, walking over " still cannot afford to have you two around to possibly disturb evidence just yet, but I called in and got you two a room at the hotel down the Marylebone. Just identify yourselves and show I.D. it's already been paid for. This should be cleared and you both will be able to return tommorow"
"That would be nice John. I can see the cycle too well, many parents live small lives, with small circles of friends just like them. Making sure thier children get good grades and everything else that can be shown off, but never really been allowed to learn. Kids rebel and try to branch away,but only tied to what they know and no realistic idea on how to learn without being punished. Everyone still goes on with small lives and narrow understanding, only to get into thier own children for trying what they were never allowed to really dare themselves when younger"
Both left for a large,but empty public bathroom nearby. They changed into what they were given,and folded the clothes they changed out of into the bag.
John could feel Sherlock's pulse throbbing through his hand, even as he gave John a steady look and his leg stopped tapping. Sherlock could mention the practicality that John's grey hair would stick him out among the long time employees, but he didn't care to worry John in any way further than the danger they were sneaking past different forms of guarding to get into. John was already giving Sherlock enough confidence to keep checked. Knowing he had someone who, over time, stayed by his side and made so much easier for him was something he would never forget. He might be confused as overlooking this blessing by those who only thought they could multitask.
"We are the heels. For the show,we will be the ever changing villains. By the end of it,we will come out as heroes in make up and costume. Now I will punch here,while you slide down and I will appear to get you with my knee"...
John sighed, how was he sure? Then looked to the kitchen. Looking through it, he soon found a kettle in the pantry, along with different canned goods and a few boxes of dried mixes.
Shaking his head, the man gestured towards John with his hand, pointing at his chest, “Those too” he snapped, “Hurry up”. At first John didn’t know what he was on about but then he looked down and realized that he was wearing his dog tags. Reaching up, John took hold of them and glanced at Sherlock. This was the first time he had seen the other’s expression and he had to admit, it confused him. The detective looked like he was about to cry… he was slowly shaking his head in a silent ‘no’. John smiled at him softly and pulled the tags from his neck, the ping of the metal was audible in the stone cold silence that seemed to hang in the air around them all. Dropping the tags on the pile, John swallowed the lump in his throat and stepped away. Before he could speak again, the man practically threw Sherlock at him and John automatically wrapped his arms around his friend, protecting him as they fell to the ground. Apparently, John had hit his head when they had reached the ground because the next thing he knew, he was opening his eyes and Sherlock was calling his name.
Two years into our time at the cottage and mercifully the public seemed to have accepted his retirement which had been announced at the end of our adventure in Oxfordshire (The Adventure of the Creeping Man) published that May. One magazine lamented the loss of 'that great Hercules' which bearing in mind that particular legendary character's somewhat chequered career I found an odd comparison. True, Sherlock had rid the world of pests like the Greek hero had done but without the acts of brutality and slaying of his own family (although having said that, with Sherlock's family.....). Then again even if my man did not look like the archetypal strongman that appearance had been the undoing of more than one criminal who had underestimated him as a result. And as I have said before, he was more than Herculean in, ahem, some areas.
On a happier note, at the end of August we had the first of two policeman visitors to our little haven in what would turn out to be a momentous year for many reasons. Superintendent Baldur had been set to retire from the Metropolitan Police Service, but the recent police strike and the resignation of the Chief Commissioner Sir Edward Henry in protest at the lack of government support had left the force in a mess. Well, a bigger mess than the usual one.
It was bitterly cold in the room from the way that I was suddenly trembling. The superintendent chuckled.
Together, we went into our home and onto whatever the future held for us both. Sherlock and John, together for always. It really was... elementary!
He leaped towards the stairs and I rushed after him. We both tried not to make too much noise and fortunately someone in one of the rooms was playing one of those new phonographs with the door open. We came within sight of the door to Room Five – and there was a large gentleman outside holding a gun!
On a happier note, that summer also saw Sherlock get his beloved bees. Only a small hive but it made him happy, and that was what was important. As I said, I would have put up with pet elephants in the backyard if he had wanted them; I could refuse my man nothing. And nothing was pretty much what I had left afterwards. We really should have named the place 'Bee-Gone, Manliness'!
“Several things”, Sherlock said. “Your half-brother is what is unfairly still referred to as 'a half-caste', and applying theatrical face powder completed the illusion of a white officer. Why did you misrepresent him like that, may I ask?”
Ginger was much the same as ever, with the sort of permanently confused look that had led so many of the criminal class to underestimate him always to their ruin. Today however there was also an air of concern, and I asked if it was Swordland's that had brought him here today.
“I must urge you to see my position, gentlemen”, he said. “I have had no trouble accepting Hector as my blood; indeed I intend to drag him to the next county ball for his sins to make it as official as possible. But your Miss Woodhouse has fallen in love with a fantasy, a handsome white soldier with foreign looks. Hector is not dark-skinned but I am sure that she would be shocked to see what he is really like.”
“The fellow waiting downstairs”, he frowned, waving the card that had just been sent up. “General Roland McCall of His Majesty's Loyal Shropshire Foot. He has a house in Craven Arms in that county and is often in the newspapers.”
“Mr. Troilus is as I have said not the wisest of men”, the lawyer said. “He made the error of telling his father that all this ‘psychic malarkey’ as he called it was utter tripe, and that his brother was as dead as a door-nail. His father did not take it well and retaliated by cutting off all communication with him.”
“He will be told to desist by Miss Terry, one of the capital's chief assassins”, Mr. Tudor said. “He will know who she is; she gave him the warning last time which he has subsequently tried to circumvent. She will make clear the consequences – the very terminal consequences – of ignoring her 'advice' this time. Should he persist in his inquiries, he will be viewing the Thames from a low and rather unfortunate angle.”
“I shall be a pilot some day”, he said, his voice suddenly taking on an almost dream-like quality. “To fly free, to serve my country, to do what is right – like you and the doctor sir, it is all I want. One day I shall have it.”
There was no visible reaction in the sergeant-major's appearance and yet I knew that he had tensed up.
“I am making inquiries about a soldier who recently left your regiment in an unauthorized manner”, I said. “One Private Scott McCall.”
Early that autumn we had another visitor at the cottage. Mr. Henry Templar was the younger brother of our Lancashire friend the then Inspector Josiah Templar, and the younger man (who was very much a carbon-copy of his illustrious brother) was a journalist at the 'Times' newspaper. He had learned that his sibling, who had been widely expected to be promoted to chief-inspector due to a recent retirement at that level, was to be passed over because two people on the selection panel did not like his 'background' (i.e. the colour of his skin). Sherlock was able to apply pressure in the right places and our friend duly won the promotion that he so richly deserved.
Relations between Sherlock and his eldest brother, always poor, had somehow contrived to get worse in the decade since their mother's death. Mycroft's poor behaviour over the years had as I have said ended in him being alone among the late knight's children in having to share his inheritance with most of his own offspring, which had left him with precious little. Spitefully he had even tried to contest the amount put by for Randall's widow Mrs. Smith (under the terms of Sherlock's late father's will she was entitled to half of his share albeit just the interest from the capital, with the latter going to charity once she had passed) but had only succeeded in losing what little money he had gained and more. He would doubtless have hated us both even more had he known that Mrs. Smith had only been able to fight off his efforts with Sherlock's financial backing, he having paid for her lawyer.
I shuddered. The raven-haired nurse had arrived here just after poor Herry, and had the sort of attitude that suggested she enjoyed making everyone's life as miserable as possible. Fortunately the men and women had separate wings and she was on the women's ward.
“This peace has had mixed blessings for us”, the monarch explained. “The United States seems to have been more affected by the horrors of the trenches than our own country despite its belated entrance into the conflict. There have already been rumblings that they are looking to consolidate their position in our own Pacific, especially with the Japanese so intent on building their own empire.”
The two young men held each other while looking hopefully at me. I smiled reassuringly at them both, they deserved some happiness.
A mental environmental campaigner hated by everyone who met her. She tried to kill the local Red Indian whom she blamed for her increasing unpopularity (because obviously there was nothing wrong with
With all the concerns over my niece Emma-Jane I was almost blind-sided when February brought an unwelcome development with her brother-in-law, Stevie’s second son Henry. Or as he now apparently wished to be called
He shifted slightly in his chair. From experience I could see the harness underneath his jacket and shirt. The policeman caught me looking and blushed.
I replaced his left hand and transferred the book to it before giving his right hand the same treatment and working my way up his right arm before nuzzling into his neck. I gently bit a love-bite into his glorious neck – not one that would last unlike the ones he loved to leave on me (and that I loved to have) – then ran my fingers through his hair making it even more of a mess.
The whole affair was resolved shortly before the end of the year and Sherlock accompanied me down to Plymouth to greet my son off the ship. He had clearly been shattered by the stress of warfare and I felt bitterly angry towards those who treated soldiers who broke under the duress of battle as cowards. Unluckily his and Anne's second son who bore my name was feeling poorly so she could not come with us, but we were able to accompany Ivan back to Sussex.
“Gad has always wanted to become a doctor”, he said. “In between, um, work, he studies in here of an evening. His own room at the back is poorly lit, you see.”
“He was able to stand but he was not himself”, she said. “His recovery was definitely slower than the month before.”
The three addresses where the dynamic duo lived, plus the one where only John Watson briefly resided before the Early Hiatus.
I was rapidly becoming of the impression that the saucy young fellow actually enjoyed making the larger man blush like that. I suppressed a smile and went over to the desk, got the will and returned. I read it through carefully then thought again.
We were as I said very much left to our own devices by the villagers among whom we had settled, my tending to their medical needs and their very much not noticing when I may have on the very odd occasion have arrived into the village in less than perfect order (and that had better damn well not be another smirk from 'someone'!). That spring however the little Blind Reach, the stream which ran through the village and forded the road going north, was swollen by late March rains and flooded several houses. Sherlock stepped in and ensured that the local council actually moved at a decent speed for once in sorting matters, and we paid jointly for the dredging of the stream so that any further flooding was much less likely. As Sherlock rightly said, what good is money if it does no good?
“Grandfather left the weirdest will, even for him”, Mr. Jukes said, shifting his position and pulling a still-blushing Mr. Bassett-Evans's other arm around him before kissing his lover's hand. “We met in this room and his solicitor told us that my cousins had a choice. He said that in the room to the left there were three items; an old prayer-book, an old chair and a painting. There was one each for Simon, Stuart and Solomon respectively; they could either inspect them themselves or they could have experts in to look at them before they made their final decision, which had to be within a week.”
I looked at the photograph that was at the centre of our case. It showed four Army lieutenants; one sat in the very centre, two more stood either side of him and a fourth lurking to the right looking almost apologetic at being there, much as Miss Radley-Barnham had said. That, presumably, had to be the object of Miss Elizabeth Woodhouse's affections. Frankly he was not much to look; about twenty-five years of age and possibly with some foreign ancestry judging from his face.
“It's far better than our house”, I said to Sarah who was placing little Johnnie in his cot. “And it's a good thing that we inherited the car as well, being so far from the town and the nearest railway-station.”
“Has someone tried to contact Mr. Creighton Dallas?” Sherlock asked, with what was dangerously close to a smirk. The constable shook his head.
1904. The first year in Sussex, and despite the world continuing to get itself into assorted messes, Sherlock and John enjoy their retirement in peace.
Sherlock was feeling particularly amorous that night, and cleared of the cloud that had hung over me in recent days I was more than happy to oblige. The blue ties came out and he bound my wrists and ankles to the four corners of the bed. I writhed ineffectually, my erection only increasing when he pulled out the black feather and began to run it down my chest.
“Gentlemen, I promised you two solutions to this crime”, Sherlock said, sitting before a roaring fire, “and two you shall have. Which one you choose to reveal to the public is up to you of course, but please hear me out fully before deciding.”
“Oh yes, that is why I remember it”, she said. “It was a young gentleman with his sister, buying things for their theatre group. He said that it would enable a small lady such as her to play the part of a much larger one. A very nice young couple as I remember.”
Chuffingden lay as I have said before on a minor road running from the main Lewes to Eastbourne road southwards across the beautiful Downs. Our road saw precious little traffic; it was winding with several blind corners and did not really go anywhere, there being a superior road to its eventual destination of Seaford that ran straight there from Lewes. There were also two fords, the Blind Reach in the village and a second one about a mile to the south. This latter place was one of Sherlock's favourite spots to do his new hobby of painting.
Unfortunately the law could not be passed before Europe's luck finally ran out. The war we had dodged twice thus far suddenly loomed large and would bring us our final case, three years after the last one – but not before the growing crisis over Sherlock's grandson Trelawney's crumbling marriage took a most unexpected turn after his wife gave birth to a daughter Joanna that, my love told me, was most certainly not that of its supposed father. Sherlock was I knew weighing up what to over this when on top of the growing political crisis we both had to head off to Wiltshire.
“The hair is from someone who is being constantly exposed to low levels of a mildly toxic chemical compound”, I said. “The sample is small but I do not think based on the amounts present that such a dose would be fatal, although it may be that the victim is particularly susceptible in some way. There may also be other chemicals involved but of too small an amount to be identified. With what I have I can only be certain of the one.”
“As with all poisons the body works to expel it, most usually through the hair”, Sherlock said. “When she called me in on this case I questioned Lady Ursula about her husband's so-called attacks, and quickly worked out what was happening. I asked her for his hair-brush with as much hair as she could get on it, and the doctor then tested it for me. Your youngest son has been exposed to constant low levels of Chemical A for at least the past three months, it having been dosed into the fudge that he has a weakness for.”
Surprisingly we did receive a visit from Randall the next day. The fact that Mrs. Rockland was stood outside her rooms with her pistol cocked and ready was, I hoped, enough of a hint even for the likes of him not to try anything.
“On Saturday her hired ruffians do their work and place Mr. Leeds drugged and asleep in the place that she asked. They then guard him to make sure that he does not wake too soon. It is imperative that he is out cold while Miss Ockham puts the next stage of her plan into action.”
But that victory had so nearly proven to be a terrible personal cost to me, and I had Sherlock to thank for avoiding a tragedy. My son Ivan had been court-martialed for desertion and would have been shot as was common practice at the time had not a colleague of his, a Lieutenant Christian Carton-Jones, had the kindness to send a warning telegram to Ivan's wife Anne and she had in turn had had the good sense to contact me (although to her I was only her son's godfather and husband's patron). The full weight of the Holmes machine was immediately thrown into action and Ivan was now being shipped back, having been honourably discharged.
“Fudge!” both ladies said simultaneously before they both laughed. Miss Kelley gestured for Lady Bradstock to go first.
Honestly, if I did not know it to have been beneath him, I would have suspected some blue-eyed bastard of doing this sort of thing deliberately just so I would fuck him all the way back to the cottage! Harrumph!
“Mrs. Zeuson and Harry”, Sherlock said, smiling slightly for some reason. “Sherrinford asked me to warn them both that there would be some flooding incident along the east coast and that their little bed and breakfast establishment might be vulnerable. They wisely took his advice and laid in extra sandbags, so were protected from the flooding in their village. Their house is fine.”
“Never mind”, I said consolingly. “I shall have you buried out in the back garden beneath a cross and the words, 'Here Lies John Hamish Watson, Sexed To His End And Happy Ever After'.”
I almost hoped that the unpleasant journalist would ignore such good advice. Almost as in completely and utterly.
England had welcomed the return of peace while mourning the non-return of so many of its young men. Our own little war memorial to four young lives that would never be fulfilled was by the pond just over the road; both Sherlock and I had kept a weather eye on the families of those who had made the final sacrifice. Like everyone I was glad that there was peace, but something about the public's reaction in the years after the war made me uneasy. Imperial Germany had been scotched, not killed, and I feared that the increasing reluctance that I sensed among many of my fellow Englishmen to pay such a heavy price for what was right would encourage our old enemy to try again once it had recovered. At least our own country was moving forward; electoral reform had now extended the franchise to all men and most women over thirty years of age (the latter provision was due to the shortage of men caused by the war and would be dropped at the end of the decade). All those violent acts by the suffragettes had indeed been for naught; it had been the essential part played by women in the War that had secured them the vote –  not, I was sure, that that would stop the loudmouths claiming the victory as theirs.
“Oh that”, he said. “They had got some of that new decaffeinated coffee in the village shop, so I thought that we might try some.”
“How did an American woman happen to get involved in an English dig?” I asked. “She could not have heard of it over there and crossed the Atlantic in so short a time, surely?”
“I do not think that he was”, she said quietly, “if only because Holly is usually right on these things. But I would admit that that may just be wishful thinking on my part. Thank you, Mr. Holmes.”
Being the mind-reader that he is, I was sure that Sherlock must have known my concerns about his grandsons and their medical histories. Fortunately the birth last year of his great-grandson Tobias had soothed some of our mutual fears, and this year young Lord Harry hit the jackpot when the Twin Tendency reasserted itself with two brothers, Harry and Alexander. To cap it all my nephew Stephen's wife gave birth to a daughter who was named Henrietta after her grandmother. Indeed, it was a year for new things.
The head of Malleus Maleficarum, a major London crime syndicate. She was short and physically similar to her husband Edred, and used that to masquerade as him as part of a bank-robbery. She attempted to murder Sherlock when she knew that the game was up but was shot dead by LeStrade.
In the year which would see the start of National Insurance to pay for those new pensions for the elderly (and 'someone' can stop smirking right this minute damn him!), our happy lives had seemed set to continue. Even if it took me nearly a full week to recover from the ‘celebrations’ that Sherlock had laid on for my sixtieth birthday at the start of that year and it was the twentieth of January before I went down to the village, only to find out that my ex-friends there had been running a book on how long it would be before I was seen again (the vicar won, but I think that was unfair as he must have had a 'tip' from upstairs).
“Just custard”, I said. “But I think that you have just solved this case for me, so I am going to send out to that bakery in Paddington for one of their boxes of forty-eight chocolate fudge squares.”
That year also saw the wettest August on record and still more suffragette attacks that continued to do nothing for their cause. In autumn there was the start of the Balkan Wars in Europe, and it would be from that particular theatre that the war we had avoided thus far would break out two years hence. All in all this was turning into a year to forget.
“He seemed the obvious candidate”, Sherlock said. “For one thing, whoever planned this had to have known about the visit of the French president as these things are planned months in advance. That meant someone most probably in the pay of either the Germans or the Austrians. When Mr. Cumberbatch happened across that theatre group in York, he realized what an opportunity it presented. Anyone who knows anything about the French president knows that he is fond of your writings, so if a play about us was on in London during his visit he would wish to see it. We know from the director's lack of reaction that the visit was kept secret.”
The carriage outside was indeed being driven by Mr. Bassett-Evans, who I thought looked tired but happy. As I mentioned back in our original case with him, he really did ‘shine’ with the same sort of inner goodness that I had once seen in our fellow half-brother, the ill-starred Lord Tobias. In these darkening times there was it seemed still hope for Mankind.
I looked at him in surprise. He usually had a frank and open manner when dealing with difficult subjects, which was why he was so popular with his patients. Yet now he looked decidedly unsure of himself.
We went out to the main hall, a cavernous place dominated by the huge split staircase ascending to the first floor. I crossed to a door on the right-hand side, opened it and peered inside.
All right, I was grateful for some of the suggestions, even the ones that turned out to be physically impossible (we had fun proving that!). An especial note of thanks must go at this point to the mysterious 'Mister Lyster', writing all the way from the United States of America whose set of works 'The Highly Elastic Adventures of Shylock Hulme and Johann Whitsun' were more than instructive. It took us weeks to work through them all, and Bob our postman chuckled darkly at the sudden rise in boxes and parcels delivered to the cottage as well as at my more than usually dishevelled state around those times. I would have glared at the bastard, but moving all those facial muscles took a lot of effort.
“I do wish that Holly had not called you in”, she said apologetically. “She is such a force of nature when she gets an idea into her head; I always find it easier just to go along with her. Though I shall miss her when she returns to the United States in the New Year.”
If you hear of him laying me to a well-earned rest any time soon, you will know exactly who was responsible!”
While we were in Stornoway, Sherlock managed to persuade a boatman there to take us out to St. Kilda, the most western outpost of civilization. I was a little nervous because of course there was a war on and the evil German U-boats had sunk many ships off Britain's western coasts, but we made it safely to the tiny island†. We were able to stand there knowing that there was nothing but several thousand miles of ocean between ourselves and the New World.
I was relieved at that for I was rather hungry, though I suspected that the crispy bacon that this place served may just have encouraged Sherlock to delay our departure. I devoured my own food quickly and we were waiting outside when a police carriage drew up. The man driving it was Sergeant Glenmarrick and he was visibly relieved to see us.
It was January the tenth when I (very gingerly) came down to breakfast at our hotel to find Sherlock looking grave.
“Elizabeth is over the moon”, he smiled, “and as she has been recognized as my chief lady, the line of succession is assured. Tantalus is certainly providing plenty of back-ups though; five of the ladies that he has 'darkly assisted' have had children, four of them sons, while six more are expecting.”
“You, doctor”, he said, to my surprise. “A gentleman called at Baker Street to talk to you on a matter of some urgency, and I needed to know if you wished to see them.”
“Sorry”, he said. “I get carried away with my history sometimes. The point is that the stone is almost exactly in the middle of the field that Mr. Fleet purchased recently, and the path across the field goes right up to it, then around it before continuing. It used to be the village common before it was enclosed so the people feel, rightly or wrongly, that it is theirs by right. Of course they can no longer access the lower parts of the river – at least not without a long walk round Mr. Fleet's lands.”
“My name is Lady Ursula Bradstock”, the finely-dressed lady said, “and this is Miss Katherine Kelley. We have a somewhat unusual case for you, gentlemen, and we hope that you would consider taking it.”
“The play was originally written by two brothers called Doyle, Mr. Arthur and Mr. Conan”, he said. “They run a small theatre group up in the city of York. Of course we had to adapt it somewhat for the London stage, and also because we were fortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. Cumberbatch.”
“I read about it last month”, he explained. “Someone found evidence that a large aerolite had struck just outside the town probably long before humans lived here, and they found it unusual because the metals in it were not what they expected.” He smiled when he saw our surprised faces. “I maintain an interest in all areas except the social pages, which is what I keep John around for.”
Poor Jack took some time to recover, and the most of the rest of 1912 passed quietly as he did so. There was of course an inquiry into the sinking but popular opinion (with which I concurred) was that the whole thing was a whitewash designed to shift blame away from the Board of Trade and their quarter of a century old safety regulations, and onto the crew of the 'Californian' which had followed procedures by turning off its wireless set that fateful night and whose crew had mistaken the flares sent up from the great liner as celebratory ones (it was only after the disaster that the use of flares was firmly restricted to calls for help). Captain Edward Smith, who had ignored several ice-warnings, posted insufficient lookouts and run his ship at full-speed into an ice-field, was not only exonerated but also honoured as a hero for going down with his ship, while little mention was made of the fact that the White Star line had reduced the original plan for thirty-two lifeboats‡ (which could have saved most of the people on board that fateful night had they all been filled) to a meagre sixteen. Hmm.
“But you should”, I pressed. “I know that he is unaware of the fact, but he is your son and you did help save him a few years back. And he knows you as one of his great supporters. He would think it odd if you were not there.”
I made it back to the house with impressive speed for someone in their seventh decade of life and burst into the front room to find my love sat on the couch.
He somehow contrived to look even more awkward. I wondered if he was going to hold out on me so I gave him what John called my 'bacon look'. He caved at once.
1911. A scheduling clash only adds to John's problems, as he has to put on a brave face and hide his inner turmoil.
“There has not been a problem with your father?” I asked. I had pursuant to the matter of the stolen gold bars made arrangements to prevent any retaliatory action being taken against Mr. Thomas Wolf; as I have said before, one could never fully trust large institutions.
“My father married my mother when they were both very young”, he said. “It was a happy marriage but there were no children, and once he passed forty years of age he became increasingly anxious to secure the dynasty. There have been Andersons at Biddleston since the thirteenth century, you see. Father also disliked Philip, his brother and potential heir, intensely; with good reason I might add. Finally when she was forty-three my mother became pregnant with me; I was born over a month early and she died of complications soon afterwards.
“You bad boy, doctor”, he said reprovingly. “I was looking forward to opening you up. Now I shall have to find that pleasure some other way.”
Mr. Macdonald telling his younger lover that he was taking him home so he could 'contribute his bit' though – really! Some men are complete sex maniacs these days. (Sherlock looked at me rather oddly when I said that to him; I have no idea why).
“As I understand it”, he said, “the contention of Mr. Major is that Mr. Leeds faked the attack, then took a train to Derby to hand over the plans. He then returned here and faked being drugged so as to deflect suspicion from himself?”
In early spring Elizabeth, Duchess of York (Prince Albert's wife) gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named in honour of her mother. The country's reaction seemed a little over the top, I felt, especially as there would likely be sons later on even if the increasingly wayward Prince of Wales failed to marry. My fears about him were proving increasingly well-grounded; Sherlock had told me that only the 'stealth-editing' of pictures of him doing his duties had prevented those shots of him looking totally bored from appearing in the newspapers.
I had been unusually bereft of ideas as to what to get the man I loved as a present for this particular milestone, but as usual he had forestalled me by telling me that his greatest wish was that, when we returned to the cottage I would grant his one request. Naturally that had me feeling highly-strung for the entirety of the picnic not helped by frequent touches and knowing looks (yes, I
“I wish you to understand the utter seriousness of this conversation, Mr. Watkin”, he said severely. “I am representing the British government in a most important and delicate matter and we may be dealing with the very
“I am not sure as to why even someone with your dislike of felines would wish to do that”, Sherlock said dryly. “So you are against such edifices?”
I awoke on Friday morning to find as had so often been the case in our many years at Baker Street, that I seemed to have acquired a human octopus during the night. I looked at the clock and saw that it said just after seven, which was early for me and impossible for Sherlock. I silently hoped that Mrs. Rockland had had the foresight to make coffee for him.
The Good Lord may have short-changed me with brains almost as much as he'd done with the looks, but when I'd seen Ned eyeing up the three of us I'd realized that a man who liked other men was looking at two happily married (and, I admit, good-looking) young men. So I'd put two and two together.
The Malones greeted us warmly and showed us to our room. I did not blush when our former landlady very pointedly remarked that while there was only one bed, she had other guests who might enjoy some peace and quiet.
“Very well”, Sherlock said. “My first solution is a little rough but it covers the facts. A certain fanatical Irish nationalist recently escaped from a London gaol, and sought a part of the country where he could lie low for a time while having a chance of crossing to his homeland. Having made sure that he was seen in the Liverpool area thus making the authorities think that he was looking to make the crossing there, he came north and worked his way towards Portpatrick, resting here until the hue and cry had died down somewhat. Unfortunately his hiding-place was disturbed, first by Mr. Alan Dallas and later by his daughter and Mr. Heston. All three paid for their mistakes with their lives, the terrorist then making his escape from the area.”
“I know that some transatlantic liners call in at Belfast, which is easily reached from Portpatrick not far from here”, Sherlock said. “Well, I shall wish you good luck if you do decide to make the great move.”
I admit that when Sherlock told me that we would be having a late holiday in my own Northumberland that November I was puzzled, and when he said that there would be a surprise my thoughts had immediately turned to frilly, lacy....
I wanted to say that the heir to the Imperial throne would not abandon his sacred duty for a woman. But I had my doubts – and I was to be proven all too right.
Some perverted blue-eyed detective insisted of course on 'testing' said equipment on me first. I mean, a stethoscope being used for.... really?
“I think that you both need to be away from here for a long time”, the earl said coldly. “My interests in South Africa need closer attention. You will go there. This week.”
“But?” I pressed. Any police officer who behaved like that, friends in high places or no friends in high places, would have been drubbed out of the force in short order unless there was something else. Ginger nodded.
“You mean, tell everyone that they could catch something horrible by coming into his shop?” he asked, quirking an eyebrow at me. “It would be the ruination of his business. No, he will not talk.”
Just a few days into the new year our friend LeStrade had passed just short of his ninetieth birthday. When John and I had attended his funeral in Cumberland we could see how deeply this had hit his friend Gregson who was just a few months his junior, and despite the efforts of both families to rally round, the inevitable happened just two months later. Although I would wager that John is right and that they are now running one of the best bakeries in Heaven!
“Which could mean a whole new village”, Sherlock said looking concerned. “There used to be a hamlet called Upper Chuffingden there in the Middle Ages before – the chapel still exists inside the farm grounds – and like Martinsthorpe back in Rutlandshire, it too was depopulated to make way for sheep. Because of that the council is much more likely to allow building on it. They might even replace the fords with bridges and widen the road across the Downs, which would mean a lot more traffic in our own village.”
We both watched as Joe guided our father out of the room. He was fifty-eight now and the man in whose arms he would soon be lying naked was seventy-three, but they loved each other as much as Dad had loved my poor mother now finally at peace, God rest her soul.
, he said at last. “Not just physically but in the light within. I may have only managed three decades in this world of ours but I have seen far too much evil in the world, often from those with a plausible shell of goodness. He just.... shone.”
I may have left out one small – well, medium-sized – detail in the story in that I spoke privately to Sergeant-Major Jones and he and his wife agreed to come to London with his camera and reproduce her famous 'Sir Come-Scribe' work for me. Except the figure draped stark naked over a pommel-horse was not a young soldier but a deeply blushing English country doctor. What with that, the Reigate photograph and Mrs. Callington's drawing, I could probably open an art exhibition devoted to my love.....
“You remember the Wall Street Crash late last year?” my love began, as I toyed with what may or may not have been my third bar.
“Nor those at Eleanor Biggs's place three doors down”, she said. “I wondered if it was something in the water even though we are all off the same pipe and I asked her about it, but she said no.”
“Next, Miss Ockham disguises herself as a man called Mr. Cheam and travels to Derby with a false identity to borrow some five hundred pounds from a bank there. It is vitally important that since they wish to tarnish Mr. Leeds, a link is established to the town where the rival works exists. Still in disguise she secures the services of three of Wellingborough's less reputable citizens to attack the man that she is now dating. She knows that the sense of smell, albeit often under-rated, is actually important in the way it makes people think and that it will make her seem more of a man. Unfortunately she rather overdoes things; you might wish to see if there is any of it in her house sergeant, as I think that she would find such a thing hard to explain.”
I was surprised that he was going abroad at this late stage in his career but of course I agreed. I would do anything for my man.
There still remained the unpleasant task of dealing with General McCall. I laid in some extra bath salts as I always felt, perhaps irrationally, that after dealing with a particularly unpleasant client I could 'wash them off' afterwards. Also a bath holding John's beautiful body in what was most definitely a manly embrace was always good, whatever the reason.
I had made sure to write to John's friend Sir Peter Greenwood thanking him for his help in this (John had implied that the baronet had felt awkward at having stumbled into the mess that was my family), and my only sad thought was that while I had offspring, my beloved was at least partly cut off from his own son by the treachery of That Dratted Woman who had claimed the title of the boy's mother but had signally failed to act as such. But John was clearly very happy for me so I put aside my concerns for now and enjoyed what I – what we had. For when young Trelawney Hawke told my beloved that he regarded him as a grandfather too, John barely held it together.
Benji's oldest son and namesake, a strapping fellow some forty-nine years old who was headmaster at an East London school and the image of his father, came to take his hand. I smiled at him and determined to help honour my cousin's last wishes for as long as the Lord allowed me so to do.
“Why do you say that?” I asked. It was wonderfully peaceful up here, the quiet barely disturbed by the faint sound of church bells and a train chuffing along one of the two lines that ran to London. It may have been November but it was still pleasantly warm, and I was feeling happy with life just now.
“The body was found by Miss Dallas herself out for her regular morning constitution”, the policeman said. “Most distressing for her, poor lass. Thankfully she had the good sense not to touch it and I only had a brief glimpse, but I think he had likely been out there all night. There is something else. His Lordship had a hunting party into yesterday evening and they were shooting down in the woods. He put up red flags on the fence around the edge as he was supposed to do, but someone tore them down.”
Vermin. He met a deserved end at Reichenbach, the house in Lincoln, Nebraska, owned by Sherrinford Holmes. The twins were beneath a reinforced concrete floor and had wired the house to blow up when their adversary approached with his men.
“That ties in with the case”, the lawyer said. “The government periodically funds the development side, but like all governments they expect something in return. Now that the rival office in Derby has produced a vehicle that performs reasonably well it is likely that there will be less money for my client's workplace.”
“We tried that”, Mr. Dayne admitted. “It seemed to somehow supercharge our heats; we had to spend a whole week taking turns inside the poor fellow, sometimes even.... uh, together. He had to take a full week off work to get over it.”
of the time!' Nor did I attend the first-ever Ideal Home Exhibition in the capital that same year. My home was ideal enough provided it had a Sherlock in it.
“How very dreadful for him”, I said flatly, wondering if I could slip away to The Majestic Duck and cele....
We both slipped back beneath the waters to sponge ourselves off, and once we were done Sherlock pulled me close. Despite its antique appearance the bath had a heating device fitted which kept the water warm for a considerable time so we could continue to soak there in comfort. It was designed so the taps were at the side, meaning that we could also sit facing each other. Which was good because Sherlock eased me round to face him then set himself to wash my hair. I sighed happily as he did so, and once he was done I did his as well.
I heard Kent bid us farewell (and me good luck, the bastard!) before driving off in the garage's vehicle, and Sherlock guided me to somewhere in front of the front door. I smiled as I remembered coming here just after we had arrived here the first time and the two of us rolling naked down the slope together. That field was a lot bumpier than it had looked!
I had been undertaking what had been an initially interesting case concerning a middle-ranking political figure on behalf of Randall that autumn, which had been dragging on since late September and was now some way past becoming tiresome. This was galling as John and I had been invited to York for the festive season as his brother Stephen had just moved there where he was responsible for running the new offices of his company (I may have helped with that move ever so slightly). John was I knew greatly looking forward to spending Christmas with his brother and his family as well as the further opportunity to explore that ancient city, but as our departure date approached this bothersome case dragged on and on.
If I had not thought that he would come in and drag me out anyway I would have locked the door and sulked there. But I picked up that huge and damnably heavy sword, then came out to find.....
Two days later the training session of the Bernician Royals Rugby Team was dominated by developments off the field rather than on it. Their coach had resigned after a scandal involving his having been caught seeing a mistress on his visits down to Newcastle, something that had been communicated to his wife and over which she had not been best pleased. He was fortunate that she had taken her scissors only to his wardrobe!
“I only met him the one time myself”, our guest admitted, “and that would have been not long after you yourselves. He was about sixteen then; so thin that he would have disappeared if he had turned sideways! I would as I said have made some inquiries myself but my new boss Superintendent Worton – he is all right as bosses go but like so many he has that thing about officers doing work of a private nature, and I do not want to get off on the wrong foot with him having just been promoted ahead of my time. Even if the worst is true, there would still have been no crime here.”
“Mr. Bassett-Evans has written to us”, I said. “My half-nephew who we helped out near your home town just before we left Baker Street.”
The fellow had barely been there a minute yet he was already grating on my nerves. Also he had the same sort of shiftiness that told me there was probably a lot more to whatever had happened that he would be 'forgetting to tell me'. I made a mental note to send to Swordland's as soon as he was safely out of the room, which event could not come soon enough.
She glared at me again but signed without even reading the papers. The lawyer looked as if he might object but a look from me stopped him, and he slunk out after his horrible client.
I wondered idly how the sergeant was doing just now, as I had most generously directed Mrs. Jones to That Shop where she had made several purchases. Hopefully the fellow was able to stand up by now......
“This is really most vexatious”, the lawyer said, taking off and polishing his wire-rimmed spectacles. “I had so hoped that John would help me enlist your aid, although I should have remembered that he does occasionally visit his brother. I suppose that I ought to have telegraphed ahead, but I considered the matter most urgent.”
I had not really expected that our path to that wonderful cottage on the Downs and the enjoyment of all that rural splendour (with those super-reinforced beds!) would be a smooth one. With our luck, such an expectation would have been totally unrealistic. But even with the fellow temporarily residing downstairs and currently sitting in our fireside chair with an innocent look that even John would not have believed, this was just downright
“The 'Times' newspaper would”, I said. “There are many scandal magazines who would pay a king's ransom for these, or for the testimony of the gentleman next to you holding that celery stick. Then there is Lady Soper, who might not be best pleased at the pictures of the female with her husband and those other 'ladies of negotiable affection'. Not of course forgetting your own clients who might be more than a little interested....”
“Sherlock”, he yawned as he scratched his head, “why are you up so early? And what are you doing out.....?”
There were no more articles about either myself or Bren during the rest of our stay in the capital. I may or may not have strutted when I had to help him out of the train at Belford – if he would wear those tight shorts of his, he should damn well be prepared to face the consequences! – but I kept a straight face when he looked suspiciously at me. Even when his eyes watered on the short walk back to our house, and in front of the smirking servants when I had to help him up the front steps. He would not be up to much for some time.
Chief secretary to the Bishop of St. Asaph, he could not work out why people were making fun of him just because he was a vile, unpleasant, detestable, loathsome, irritating, foul sub-human. Sherlock found that hassocks were the key to the communication network transmitting his misdeeds around the 'city' and used the same method to ensure that the rumour about his sleeping with the wife of the war-hero Colonel Trott reached that ex-soldier's ears. Then he provided said gentleman with directions about Mr. Anderson's attempted escape which, like his life, ended on the dockside at Liverpool.
A senior judge who 'went rogue'. Queen Molly alerted Sherlock to this and the judge was slipped the location of the safe house where Mr. Edmund Fitzroy, a key witness against Professor Moriarty, was hiding, along with the news that he was about to be moved. The judge went round there with his gun to try to silence Mr. Fitzroy but was shot dead.
“Introverts like him are good at concealing their true feelings”, Doctor Watson said. “I have treated some in my time, and like a volcano one never knows when the eruption is going to happen. Your parents are good people, but they cannot have known or they would certainly have done something.”
“Meanwhile Mr. Brown or one of his ruffian confederates has been keeping an eye on Mr. Leeds, dosing him with chloroform any time that he looked to be coming round. Once Miss Ockham arrived back she went as planned to call at Mr. Leeds's house, left the incriminating clipped ticket that she herself had just travelled on, and played her part of the concerned lady-friend while secretly rejoicing at the apparent destruction of her true love Mr. Brown's rival. Although she likely had a bad moment when Mr. Brown rejoined her and pointed out her mistake about the hair.”
“I sprained my shoulder last weekend”, I said. “Embarrassingly it was because I picked up Henry the wrong way; Sarah is still laughing at me for being so clumsy. I have the gun but it is useless.”
My namesake was like Bren another tall fellow though older, spindly rather than muscular, and ginger rather than dark-haired. He had taken over the running of Swordland's, the information agency that had assisted Mr. Holmes several times, and he listened patiently as I explained the problem. He read the article and frowned.
We were staying down in Eastbourne for a time as the cottage had needed some major repairs undertaken. That summer had been very dry and a crack had appeared in one of the side-walls, necessitating the sort of work that would have made living there very uncomfortable (I was for some reason not allowed to suggest playing 'Let's Traumatize The Construction Workers'). The recent passing of both the Malones had meant that instead of heading to Brighton as we had originally planned we had come here to help sort out their estate on behalf of the Rocklands. Incredibly the voters of the St. Marylebone constituency which lay close to Baker Street had, for reasons that only they would ever know, elected Mrs. Rockland to parliament which she was duly terrori.... setting to rights.
“How did you come to be performing it?” Sherlock asked. “It is not the usual thing one sees on a London stage.”
“Even better”, he said. “if we press a switch when we are inside, the lantern on the top will flash on and off so that everyone will know something is happening.....”
It was perhaps typical that a solitary case arose during that dark time when I did not have my love, my heart, my all with me. I would not have let myself get involved had not the fellow requesting my aid come to Baker Street expecting to see John. His name was Mr. Stuart Ireland and he was a lawyer hailing originally from North Shields in Northumberland. John had struck up a friendship with the fellow during his visit to Bargate, the long-vanished college where I had met him back in 1874. Mr. Ireland had also worked with John's brother Stephen on some cases so the reedy blond fellow had a double claim on my time.
house of course but we are sure that she came to this area and that she entered domestic service in an attempt to elude her pursuers. I would be grateful if you could tell me whether you have hired any new staff in the past twelve months?”
“That she does not return to being her normal and terrible self?” Sherlock suggested. We all laughed.
“Seventeen is Mr. Cowper's route, the semi-fast from London as far as Leicester, sir”, the station-master explained. “Each conductor has his own clippers, with a different letter on them; there's hell to pay if they lose them! Mr. Cowper's letter is 'A', so he had to have clipped that ticket.”
“As bad as ever”, Mr. Macdonald sighed. “I have never recovered from telling them that they did not have to try to act all respectable around me as I knew what they were really like. Probably the worst choice of words since some idiot called the 'Titanic' unsinkable! I shall still miss them if they do go though.”
“Given the influence that the current American ambassador has with his president, I very much doubt that Mr. Magnum would get much in the way of justice”, I said dryly. “No, I think that other methods are called for.”
“He is one of those loud generals who is always sounding off about the Dreadful Decline In Standards These Days”, he said in a mock military tone that made me smile. “He has five sons and three daughters; I know of them because one daughter, Iris, married my old colleague Owen Pardew's grandson, another Owen, and like him she has nearly finished training in our profession. All five boys are in the Army; the youngest Scott has I believe just joined his father's regiment.”
I made the mistake of mentioning this to Sherlock and realized a moment too late that he might take it as an invitation to stop. Perhaps that proved that I was finally beginning to go senile; he proceeded to walk me all around the cottage while holding me impaled on his cock! I broke yet another cock-ring (not the platinum one, thankfully); they really do not make things like they used to.
An unpleasant north London sergeant who struck a deal with some captured criminals to share their loot and also tried to implicate his constable Edward 'Ginger' Tudor whom he hated. Hogshaugh was killed trying to escape when Sherlock caught him; he tried to leap a canal to safety but fell back and hit his head.
“Extremists often fail to see things through the point of view of anyone of dissimilar opinions to themselves”, my love said dryly.
“You might consider the legal situation back then”, Sherlock said in a tone of mild reproof. “Legally John could have upset your young life by demanding access to you as his blood son, but that would have been wrong on so many levels. Also our lives have always been somewhat irregular, and back then we were facing one particularly vile opponent who would have thought nothing about murdering you to get at me.”
We could not then know either that we were less than seven years away from seeing the first domino fall, or the terrible consequences that would unfold as a result. For our Nation and, in some ways, for us personally.
“How did you come to choose him as the young doctor?” Sherlock asked. “He is not as renowned as Mr. Cumberbatch.”
I almost felt sorry for our cousins across the Pond, but then they had unleashed that harridan on us in the first place. And Texas was a large state – the largest, if I remembered correctly – so there were surely some parts out of the woman's screeching distance.
This has to rank as one of the cases that I most regret not being able to have included in the 'Sherlock canon', for it involved the overthrow of one of the worst excrescences of modern policing (and we in our time had seem some pretty bad ones, I can tell you!). The villain was the ghastly Sergeant Craig Whitefeather who, to his ultimate discomfort, came back into our lives at the worst possible time and was involved in a crime yet seemingly could not have been. And once again it was the man that so many wrongly call a mere scribe, my beloved John, who solved the riddle and helped me to secure justice.
I spent the rest of Saturday writing out the notes of the case and ruing that I had ever teased John about the amount of time he spent with a pen in his hand. My wrist seriously ached by the end of the day!
“The good doctor told me”, I smiled. “He reminded me that Americans operate on different time zones to we English, with New York being five hours behind and San Francisco on the Pacific coast a full eight hours.”
A lawyer he was prepared to try to drive his father Judge Methusaleh Abrahams insane by poisoning his tea until he agreed to sell his large property. Unfortunately a neighbour nearly got poisoned instead; Jeroboam rushed round to finish the job but his father swapped their teacups and the son met a painful end.
“People expect extremes in the theatre, doctor”, he said soothingly. “We have to exaggerate characteristics to make the audience laugh or cry. I take it that you have not see the performance yourselves as of yet?”
Although after our night at the hotel in London walking was something I could only do with difficulty. And I was sure that the capital's roads were even bumpier than I remembered!
“Maybe dry”, the constable said, “but I dare say he mayn’t look over poor Mr. Dallas. His daughter had a fit when I suggested even getting Doc Ross in town to come take a look.”
Halfway along the second side was where the path from the Hall crossed a gap in the hedge. Sherlock stopped and looked thoughtfully across at the stone in the distance.
“So that leaves one more person to tell”, he said heavily. “Would you like to break this to him alone, doctor?”
“That is enough for me”, he said grimly. “It is as I feared. We are fortunate that  we shall be able to close this case before we leave.”
1911. With the shadow of war growing ever longer, ruling the waves may no longer be enough to keep Britannia safe. Sherlock and John agree to leave Chuffingden and travel to the air-base at Northolt, Middlesex, to investigate strange goings-on around the experimental mail flights between there and Windsor – is flying more dangerous than even John supposes?
“The manager said that each student was allotted one of the counties in or near London and had to produce a piece of art representing it”, he said. “I thought that we might see what they made of our soon to be home, East Sussex. Ah, here it..... oh.”
“For two reasons”, Sherlock said. “Firstly I wanted to see if Lord Thomas’ elder brothers had any of Chemical B in their possession. I struck gold as the saying goes; my man found not only the chemical but also syringes in their possession, hardly the sort of thing that country gentlemen need in their day-to-day lives. It was relatively easy for Lord Daniel and Lord George to dose their younger brother's sharp-tasting lemon juice with Chemical B and they were careful to always do it on Full Moon nights, suggesting to you their father that perhaps all those stories about werewolves were not stories after all. The whole was aimed at making you come to doubt his suitability as an heir.”
I suddenly realized just why Nick had been splattered with blue paint yesterday, and quite probably why he had had that knowing look as well. Sherlock was giving me that terrible smile of his.
“They sprung it on me too”, his brother said defensively. “It is not just your showing up to shake hands. The heads of state of both France and Great Britain in an open royal box. It could be an assassin's dream!”
1917. Tragedy is only narrowly averted as John is alerted in time to rescue his son from being shot for desertion, but like so many Lieutenant Ivan Leeds returns to England a broken man.
“I have seen Mr. Freeman before somewhere or other, and I noted then that he has a slight accent”, Sherlock observed. “Which country does he hail from originally?”
When I reached the hospital (I had obviously had to eat the muffins to save carrying them around), I was surprised to find a second sample had been sent there for me to test which I assumed must have been Sherlock's other chemical. Naturally I shall not disclose the names of the substances in question save to say that Sherlock was (as ever) correct in his assumption. I would have wondered as to how he had obtained the second sample but I knew better. Ignorance was bliss with some of the things that my man got up to. Many of them come to that.
“Was the next attack on August the twenty-sixth by any chance?” he asked Lady Bradstock. She stared at him in shock.
He shuddered for some reason. I had no idea why; I was being very generous to him all things considered. But if he continued to annoy friends of mine, that would end very suddenly!
That year was also marked by two departures. Sanitary engineer Thomas Crapper, famed for his development of the toilet, died. And after one of the famous murder trials of the age, Doctor Hawley Crippin who had murdered his wife and later fled the country only to be arrested with the aid of the wireless telegraph, was hung.  A good riddance in the latter's case.
“You tease your poor friend, just as in his stories”, Miss Kelley said playfully. “To explain doctor, I am the mistress of Ursula’s husband who in turn is the youngest son of Nathaniel Earl of Bradstock. I had a son by Lord Thomas earlier this year, James, and he has promised to support him as he grows up.”
, which I believe translates loosely into English as 'temporary mercy'”, he said. “Please note the application of the adjective 'temporary'; it is rather important. You may return to your wretched lives – but the boys here will be watching you. Constantly. If one more person going into and out of that shop that my ladies use is inconvenienced in
“He is rather”, she said. “There is this family curse which dates back to the Middle Ages that states the current line will die out if there is more than one lord of Stalwarton with the same Christian name. A silly superstition one might think, but the only time a lord of the manor tried to break it he and his entire family were wiped out in the English Civil War. Upon the Restoration, the title passed to a cousin of his. No-one has dared to try since.”
“That is good”, our visitor smiled, mercifully unaware of my inner turmoil. “I was going to call on the young fellow while I was down here but I wondered if you gentlemen would be so good as to check something out for me first?”
“I feel a bit odd having to ask you this”, he said, folding his muscular bulk into the famous fireside chair. “I could make inquiries of my own but as you know the service frowns on such things. It may be something or nothing.”
“If it involves a peer of the realm being duped it becomes my business”, Sherlock said. “I would like to show you something but I warn you now, you will not be pleased with it.”
“Just because the Oxford English Dictionary is finally complete”, I said not at all frostily, “we do not have to mark the occasion.”
that a certain blue-eyed genius is muttering something about wiseacres as I write this!). Votes for women would come just as the last century had brought three great acts that had led to about sixty per cent of men (mainly those with property, including myself at last) having a vote, but this sort of direct action served only to antagonize people and press criticism was particularly fierce. The suffragette movement did however claim one early casualty; the disgraced Mr. Torver Holmes followed up a major speech at an anti-suffragette rally with a six-course meal and promptly dropped dead of a heart-attack!
“This is Constable McLean”, the vicar said, gesturing to a rotund middle-aged policeman. “Jacob, this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson. From London!”
“I asked Kent, the chap in charge of the rosters, and he told me that it was the captain who had changed them”, he said. “He has flown off to try to kill the king. Even when he fails, the publicity will be awful and the damage to the British flight programme serious.”
And thereafter I received regular letters from my new grandsons as to how they were doing in school, which may have made even me sniff. Though not as manfully as John, of course.
renowned that surely everyone knew that he was using American time when giving his statement. I doubt that that will save him in the court of public opinion, however.”
“I understand that when this railway company clips their passengers' tickets they do so with a code”, Sherlock said. “I have a ticket with '17A' on it. Can you tell me what those numbers mean, please?”
“Fellow at my club says that you can find things”, he said bluntly. “My boy Scott has gone missing.”
“I am sure that they have made sure to establish a separate line of communication that is secure”, I said, “so that when those in Washington D.C. read their messages they will come away with the impression that the whole royal family is a bunch of frankly insane Anglophiles. Indeed I would wager that they have also intercepted some preliminary discussions about tightening the treaty between our nations to allow British ships full rights in a greatly expanded port.”
Sherlock's influence was called into action again this year, when a nasty little gossip magazine called 'Cooking With Gas', the sort of rubbish that I would certainly never have even glanced at, published a scurrilous article attacking his grandson Lord Trelawney for his part in the war. Incredibly the normally trustworthy 'Times' picked up the article and was vaguely supportive of the claims made against the young man, at least until Sherlock had a letter from one of the top spymasters during the war published. In it he said that of course he could not go into detail but the young man had done sterling service for his Nation that had saved many lives (this was indeed true; as part of his work he had detected a major design flaw in a new type of tank that could have had disastrous consequences had the vehicle gone into production unchecked), and the result was that the horrible rag was forced to close with its few finances being used to help wounded soldiers and their families.
He trailed off but I knew that he was thinking not only of the horrific casualty rates in those terrible killing fields (mathematically I knew that Ivan would have been more likely to have been killed there even before he had journeyed out to Egypt earlier in the year), but that my disgraced former nephew 'Heinrich' was fighting in the Kaiser's army. The thought of my nephew wielding a gun against my son was unbearable. Sherlock pulled me even closer and whispered to me that it was all right to cry.
“I think it might have been Willy – Mr. Nye – our scrum-half before Ned came along”, he said reluctantly. “He’s friends with the Alnwick coach and he was around the changing-rooms at the time. Can’t be sure but I know he resented having to move position even though Ned’s miles better. Willy quit the team a few weeks back but is still around doing odd jobs.”
“I always admired that part of you, John”, he said softly. “In another age you would have been the knight-crusader, heading off to slay the dragon and rescue the fair damsel in distress.”
On our way back south we first visited Tobermory and the Isle of Skye before calling in on Mr. Bronn Blackwater and his lovers, who were then living somewhat ironically in Kyle of Lochalsh, where Mr. Lannister had famously 'disappeared' all those years ago, and whom we had last seen in person some five years back when our friend had been a complete wreck.
The tall fellow thought that one through. As I have said, despite his appearance he was really a clever man.
“The bookcase shows two distinct choices of literature in both business and pleasure reading”, Sherlock said, smiling in a way that was just annoying. “Also the table by the window has faint sun-marks on it which indicates that someone frequently spreads paperwork all over the place, something that certain writers do far too often these days.”
near to the theatre which he loves to visit”, Miss Kelley agreed. “It really is the devil’s work to keep him away from it!”
“Towards the village”, I began, then stopped. “But he cannot have been. His brother did not say anything about his visiting him
“At least you can remember our last moments here with fondness”, he grinned unabashedly. “Or at least remember the fondling. Besides I need to keep you on your toes,
“I do not see why you are so set against this idea of flying”, said someone who was not getting laid or doing any laying any time soon. “This Aviation Week seems an excellent idea, and they will doubtless offer flights for anyone who wishes to see the earth from on high.”
A year of revolutions in Russia had enabled the Kaiser's Germany to transfer many more units to the already stretched Western Front at the start of the year; the wretch who was the cause of all this suffering had clearly recognized that the longer he waited, the more American troops would be set against him. He had struck in early spring ('the Kaiser's Battle') and had come close to breaching the Allied lines but had then been pushed back. Now after a pause for breath the reports were that the Allied offensive was succeeding if slowly, the enemy increasingly demoralized by what was happening to both them and their excuse for a nation. It was surely only a matter of time, if far too much time costing far too many more young lives.
“I would like a quick look”, Sherlock said. “Do not disturb yourself sir; we shall only be a few minutes. Doctor, shall we go?”
“It is strange”, I said, ignoring the show-off in the vicinity, “that it took two really bad kings like John and his son Henry the Third to advance the English constitution. But then I suppose that poor Earl Simon would turn in his grave if he saw our modern system, especially when women do finally get the vote.”
John stared into his empty dessert-dish, still hoping after all these years that one day his chocolate cake would somehow reappear there to be enjoyed a second time. He really was even more cute and adorable at times like that, although I would never have uttered either of those words in his presence. The one time I had actually called him cute had resulted in a Pout whose Consequences had caused us to miss the Sunday morning service.
"I'm not suggesting you are, but you have been going after criminals that lead to too many close calls" Sherlock was about to protest when John held up a finger. "I know better than to try and get you to stop. I can only make sure do not get out of practice of going about fighting the right way." John looked down at his practice piece,but kept talking. "I was there to tackle and keep that child killer restrained until Donavon put cuffs on him and he was taken to the back of the police car. Before that,he was sitting on you with his hands around your neck!" By then,John had nearly hissed the last piece and looked up at Sherlock with a bit of sadness before he got under control.
He dug to the back of his closet, and got the practice swords out of his bag before running back downstairs.
He checked the magazine,then shot the stool in 3 places to separate,and carry the pieces back near the fireplace.
Delighted by the reaction he got, John pulled back to admire his work. On the side of Sherlock’s ivory pale neck, there was a light purple mark forming. Now as a medical professional, John knew the dangers of hickeys and should have been repulsed by his own negligence but there was just something so deep and primal about marking your partner. Smiling to himself, he leant back down and licked a stripe from Sherlock’s collar bone, up over the mark before teasing lightly at the detective’s ear, giving it a playful nip and whispering, “What is it love?” he asked.
“Whoa whoa slow down Sherlock” John said quickly, taking hold of the other’s hand once more.  “There’s no race ok?” he assured. Seeing the confusion dawn in those beautiful eyes, John decided words wouldn’t be good enough. Despite his desire to plow Sherlock’s fine arse on every surface of the flat, he didn’t want things to just be purely based on lust like that. Deciding that actions would be more appropriate than words, John moved his free hand to Sherlock’s shoulder and guided him backwards until the detective had his back against the wall. Raising himself to his tiptoes, John closed his eyes and pressed a kiss to those cupid-bow lips, humming a little at the contact. One thing was certain, if they were going to do anything, they were going to do it right.
These two are starting to get to the good stuff but pre-warning, NSFW content in this chapter and the following one. Enjoy!
Sherlock climbed into the cab in silence and looked out of the window for some time, deliberating whether or not it would be a good idea to stay beside John. He had slept far better and been much more comfortable despite the lumpy mattress. His mind had been calm and his body had been relaxed. He had felt like it was the right place for him to be. After most of the cab ride was over, Sherlock turned to John and felt his heart crunch up a little as he realized John was sitting there a bit curled in on himself, he looked embarrassed and even slightly humiliated. It was only then that he realized that he had not verbally confirmed an answer and John must have taken his silence as a rejection to his offer. Sherlock reached over and put a hand on John’s knee, “John, look at me please?” he asked softly, realizing that the other man had been clearly spiraling in his thoughts for the entire cab ride probably mentally cursing himself for asking such a thing. “John?”
You didn’t need to have the skills of deduction to deduce a man like John Watson, in the nicest of ways he was quite a simple person and he wasn’t very skilled at hiding his insecurities. Sherlock had spotted several on the very first day they met. One being the way John stood didn’t only indicate his participation in the war but a determination to not be looked down on for his injuries. He was hurt both physically and mentally, most people would accept that sort of thing but not John. He didn’t want to be pitied despite the fact he was utterly ashamed of himself. Sherlock hated it. He hated how John always looked down on himself, how he always saw himself as second best, how he always hid from the world even when he stood in plain sight. It had been obvious that John wore baggy t-shirts, oversized suits and large jumpers in order to cover up his body from prying eyes over the years. He even wore them on dates… Sherlock had always wanted to turn around and call him out, tell him he shouldn’t hide and that if anyone dared to judge him that he could do better, but he held his tongue. Now however, he couldn’t. John was hiding, he was hiding from him… That wouldn’t do. Reaching forward, Sherlock rested his hand lightly on the slightly raised mark on John’s shoulder and looked up so that he could meet the now trembling man’s eyes, “John… you don’t have to hide from me, you know that right?” he asked gently, trying his best to keep his usual baritone low and soft so as not to startle him. He felt the way John tensed under his touch but under that he felt the beat of his heart as it picked up under his skin. Fear? Discomfort? Then he noticed it, the way John’s eyes became unfocused and his breathing changed and caught a little in his throat. Using his free hand, Sherlock copied John’s gesture from earlier, cupping the man’s cheek and allowing their eyes to meet, “John… “ he breathed.
“No”, I said firmly. “No teasing your big brother just because one of his games with Danny ended a tad prematurely.”
“That is unsurprising”, he said. “I only wish that we had been able to contact Lieutenant Anderson directly, but for obvious reasons we cannot.”
The summer of that year was marked by the strange and tragic case of the suffragette Miss Emily Davison, who threw herself in front of the king's horse Anmer during the Derby. Quite why she sacrificed herself in this way remained a mystery; it only hardened attitudes against her cause which had also not been helped by the frankly inexplicable decision of her fellow idiots to start attacking pillar-boxes of all things!
Relief washed over John and he carefully pulled Sherlock into a hug, “I know it’s not your area but I’ll show you how things usually go alright? We can work on this together and whatever you want to do or give, I’ll be happy with so please just promise me right now, you won’t force yourself to do anything you don’t want to?”
“I was thinking and it was clear that both you and I require some form of stimulus. You’re chivalrous attempts to cover your own arousal didn’t go unnoticed John, but after thinking it through and hearing your attempts to cover your own activities, I thought it best to try something spontaneous.” he concluded, blushing ever so slightly at his own proposition.
Smiling, Sherlock nodded, leading the way but making sure to check the road this time before taking of in his usual sprint, John trailing behind him. The streets of London sailed past them yet again and soon enough, with enough deductive work along the way, Sherlock was able to find the base of operations which linked the killer to not only the homicides but a series of killing spanning over the last 2o years. Lestrade and the team were down within minutes and arrests were made. It didn’t take long to surround and clear out the building and before they could be dragged to the station, Sherlock managed to talk his way out of the paperwork as per usual. He always saw it as a waste of his valuable time to sit down and fill out a bunch of stupid forms. They had their killer and the evidence, what more did they really need to convict him? Before they could be stopped, Sherlock took John by the hand and lead him away, not caring about the whispers and sneers from Anderson and a few others who saw. They were in a cab before too long and on their way home, it was a tense ride however as Sherlock knew things would change from this point onwards, but he had no idea what exactly would be different. How would he cope with this? What if he did it all wrong and ended up hurting John? What if John wanted sex or something? How would he explain his lack of experience at his age? Would John be comfortable leading things or would he expect Sherlock to take control?
Taking advantage of Sherlock’s lack of witty remarks, John repositioned himself so that he was now kneeling between Sherlock’s legs. Looking down at him, John couldn’t help but gawk just a little bit. The detective was absolutely beautiful, laying there with his lips pink, his cheeks flushed and his eyes wide. Every bone in his body was screaming at him to just take Sherlock there and then but he knew that wasn't what he really wanted. Instead he leaned forward, claiming those lips yet again all the while reaching down and gently rubbing at Sherlock's clearly interested crotch. A gasp came from the brunette and John backed up for a moment to look at him, despite the sound Sherlock didn't look in any way afraid, quite the contrary, he looked more enthusiastic that before. With a smirk, John began to palm rhythmically at the solid bulge beneath the fabric, a small sense of pride coming to his chest as he watched the reactions he was causing. The sight of Sherlock biting his lip to hold back the moans that were clearly threatening to escape was amazing and it only drove John to lose his composure just a little bit and let loose.
It was strange, John looked different but for the life of him, Sherlock simply could not put his finger on how. It was something to do with the other’s expression and the way he had been looking at Sherlock lately. He had noticed it before but it seemed to be far more frequent as of late. Ignoring it for the moment, he smiled at John, “I’d like to stay with you, it was rather comfortable and I wouldn’t want to be alone again really… at least until that man is apprehended.” he admitted. It was true, Sherlock couldn’t bare the thought of sleeping alone before and that hadn’t really changed. He couldn’t believe how easy it had been for him to be tired and put in such a vulnerable position and frankly, he didn’t want to experience that again so soon. In a way, he knew at least if he slept beside John, he would be protected. John always protected him, no matter what the cost. Sometimes he wanted to tell the doctor to think of himself for a change but by now he knew that wouldn’t happen. Since they had met til now, John had put his own life on the line countless times in order to keep Sherlock safe and he knew that he would never quite be able to return the favour. At the end of the day, most of the time they are put in life or death situations is down to the cases they are on at the time and indirectly down to Sherlock getting involved in them. Guilt started to pool in his stomach and he tried to focus on John instead who was now staring at him with doe-like eyes.
Thanks for sticking with me as I write. Apologies for the inconsistency. Hope you all enjoyed the chapter.
While John worked away in the living room, Sherlock found that he couldn’t help but watch him from the corner of his eye. The doctor had always managed to intrigue him somehow from the day they met but after the incident in the early hours, John had absolutely astounded and confused him. While being bound and held at the mercy of the gunman, Sherlock had felt his mind and body freeze as he came to the realization that he had no chance to get out of it. Standing in the other man’s room, he had watched in amazement as John had calmly handled the situation, giving up his own possessions… John had always put his safety above anything else, it was part and parcel with regards to his personality and military background after all. The thing is, recently, Sherlock had been noticing more and more often how John had been taking care of him more around the house and even on cases. At first, he had found the behaviour slightly irritating and he almost scolded the other but by this point it had become something he almost liked. While watching John work, Sherlock soon found himself smiling a little but then John looked up and his heart stuttered in his chest as he spun away, pretending to be working on something elsewhere in the kitchen. A blush came up on his cheeks and he felt embarrassed at being caught just watching his friend but hoped John wouldn’t think anything of it. Why would he anyway?
It’s funny how much of a difference a change in scenery can make, the second that the pair had left the flat it felt as though they could both breathe freely again. Something about the events of that morning had been weighing heavily on them in there. Despite the chill of the evening air, it was fairly pleasant weather for London; no depressing rain, grey skies or harsh breezes. Sherlock looked around for a nearby cab, his keen eye spotting one in mere seconds before he managed to flag it down. Whenever John tried to do this he was typically ignored, at first he thought perhaps Sherlock had some form of presence that he simply did not possess himself but nowadays he puts it down to the fact he is a lot shorter and in turn harder to spot. They clambered into the cab and set off, sitting in a comfortable silence while the driver took them through the quiet streets. Rush hour had passed now, it was already almost 8pm and the trickle of cars that made their way through the London roads were all but in a rush by this point. Turning, John looked over to Sherlock and smiled a little, he always looked so different when they were out under the city lights. His cheekbones looked sharper, his face more solem, his eyes glinted as he analysed every little thing within his view. John’s glance only lasted a moment, he hardly needed longer than that because if he lingered, he knew he would be caught and neither of them would not want to have to deal with that sort of conversation. John could imagine it now:
A few minutes passed and John tried his best to restrain his need to message over and over again just like Sherlock had earlier. Desperation and panic wouldn’t help him though and he knew that.
“Easy, he was swearing like a sailor and lost his targets” he said with a smile. “Plus the police will have him right about…. Now” Sherlock smirked as the blue lights filled the alley and flickered at the entrance to their crevice.
Seeing John rush off to research, Sherlock smiled to himself but got up and went to the kitchen to try and busy himself with an experiment. He knew he had left a pile of tobacco lying around somewhere, granted he would need to find it quickly otherwise the blood on it would become too contaminated for him to work from. ‘I knew I should have put it in a bag… ‘ he thought grumpily as he scanned the room, soon spotting the scattered tobacco from their recent cold case. As per usual, while he was working, hours went by and soon enough the night was upon them. Funnily enough, the stress of today and all the revelations had actually managed to tire the detective to such a point that his focus was disrupted. Sighing, he put his tobacco in a bag and looked up to find John was no longer in the living room, as usual he had probably spoken to him and due to the work he hadn’t noticed. Usually this wasn’t a problem, so why now did Sherlock feel a guilt pool in his stomach at the thought of John addressing him and getting no response? He shook the feeling off and went to his room, feeling relieved as soon as his head hit the pillow. Normally, sleep was simply an inconvenience, but tonight it was more than appreciated as Sherlock found himself drifting off into slumber within seconds.
A smile broke across John’s face and he nodded, eyes flicking between their connected hands and Sherlock’s confused expression. “I’m so glad you are alright. I’m sorry I wasn’t quicker… I saw him but I didn’t notice until I was round the corner and… I’m sorry” he apologized, the smile fading from his lips. ‘If I had just been quicker I could have prevented this, I could have stopped Sherlock from being drugged by that arse…’ John was snapped out of his thoughts by Sherlock squeezing his hand. The detective looked like he wanted to say something but no words came out, instead he just  shook his head and closed his eyes. John sighed and did the same, resting his forehead on Sherlock’s bare shoulder, “If I was more observant I wouldn’t risk losing you so often” he muttered.
When the sun finally managed to pour in through the windows, John found himself waking up with a pounding in his head and he had to suppress a groan when he shifted his stiff shoulder. Feeling groggy he went to move, however it was then that reality dawned on him and he opened his eyes to see a still slumbering Sherlock resting calmly on his chest. Blinking once, twice, three times John was sure for a moment that he was hallucinating, until the events of the early hours came flooding back to him. At first he felt sick, memories of Sherlock being held at the precipice of death always made the doctor’s stomach turn. The feeling soon faded though as he watched his dear detective sleeping soundly, it was something he very rarely saw. Sherlock never really took care of himself properly so for him to sleep like this… it was a miracle of sorts. For a few moments he laid there, simply taking in the sight of Sherlock; face slack, body relaxed and breathing slowly. It was rather adorable as Sherlock let out a nasally snore occasionally, at the small sound John couldn’t help but smile a little. It was a small and quiet sound but after John noticed it, it was all he could focus on. At some point, Sherlock must have moved as a few of his dark curls had fallen forward, resting messily on his forehead. Assessing the situation briefly, John realized he had one arm was pinned under Sherlock’s torso but the other was freely resting at his side. Using the opportunity, John reached up carefully with his free hand and delicately brushed a few of Sherlock’s stray curls back. He knew it was ridiculous, looking at this situation as an opportunity… but he couldn’t seem to help himself. Years of looking at a man you want so badly and can’t get close to is enough to drive anyone mad, so John decided for once, he was going to be selfish and enjoy the little contact he could get. After all, Sherlock would brush this off like he did any life or death situation and go on as usual. Sighing, John closed his eyes and tried to just enjoy the moment, ‘I wish I could wake up like this every morning…’  he thought while wrapping his free arm around the other man, hugging him gently. It was then that the detective began to stir and John felt his heart drop a little, ‘This is it… he’ll back off and this won’t happen again… please just give me five more minutes’ Peeking at the brunette, John hoped he was just moving around in his sleep, but no such luck. For a brief moment, he thought about simply pretending he was still asleep but Sherlock would already know he was awake without question so there really was no point in trying that one. “Morning, did you sleep alright?” John asked, his voice a little rougher than usual.
The cab ride had been crushing for John, the silence hanging in the air and his heart feeling like it might beat right out of his chest. Sherlock had sat in sheer silence, staring out at the city streets as they passed them by. He knew deep down that sherlock was probably thinking to start with but… for the whole cab ride? No. Soon enough, when they were a few streets down from Baker Street, John realized Sherlock was talking to him and he looked up carefully, “Sorry what?” he asked, trying to refocus himself and not look like a rejected teenager who was sulking.
“Oi you berk! I was just doing something nice. I won’t bother in future if it bothers you so much” the blonde quipped, backing off a step or two and clasping his hands behind his back.
By the time morning came around, John was awake as always, greeting the sun with a soft smile on his lips. He had slept without an issue and awoke with the still warmth of a sleeping Sherlock at his side. Honestly, how could life be any better than it was at this moment? While the detective slept soundly, John took the time to contemplate on just how things had gone thus far. Considering he had never believed that this sort of thing could become a possibility, it was somewhat incredible to him that this is the way in which their life had come to be. So many people looked at Sherlock with lust, desire, longing and in the case of many, love and adoration but in all the years John had known him, he had never reciprocated the looks back with anything other than disdain, disgust or disinterest. So many people had come to love the man in so many ways and in a way, despite his own affections for Sherlock and the joy he had now being his romantic partner, John had always found himself feeling sorry for the many men and women Sherlock had thrown aside with no tact or care in the past. He had watched people get their hearts broken time and time again, it was quite a depressing sight. Molly Hooper was a fantastic example. Sighing, John’s smile fell as he remembered the various expressions of pain on her face when Sherlock turned her down on the regular, insulted her, forgot about her and the look that flickered in her eyes at the sound of the many unintentionally cruel things he said to her. The one memory that stood out most of all was that Christmas party they had in the flat. The way Sherlock had hurt Molly so badly it speared the hearts of everyone in the room, even his own. He had been sarcastic, spiteful and hypercritical of her appearance yet again and she had just snapped…. Molly Hooper was not a woman who snapped easily people considered her often to be weak, timid and a little ditzy to say the very least but that wasn’t the case really, she was patient, considerate, compassionate and empathetic. Considering the cold and unfeeling nature of the world these days, it was people like Molly Hooper who reminded those around them that it was alright to feel something from time to time. Looking down at the sleeping man in his arms, John shook his head slightly, ‘Even if they had been a couple, he would never treat her the way she wants… there’s only one woman on par with Sherlock Holmes and she’s long gone’ he thought, a pang of jealousy going off in his stomach at the mere memory of a certain Miss Irene Adler. That woman had swooped into their lives and nearly stolen Sherlock right out from under him. Granted John had never revealed his affections at the time and would have had absolutely no right to protest the union but by God he wanted to. Shaking the memory away, John pulled Sherlock in closer and pressed a small kiss to his forehead. The world’s only consulting detective was his now and if they made this work, that is how it would stay.
“I… he… I think he needs some space” Sherlock stammered, still staring dumbfounded at the place that John had been standing.
