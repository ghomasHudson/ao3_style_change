He watched them kiss hungrily, strip hastily, all in their naked glory, before Dean threw her onto the straw bed. He watched how Anna spread her legs apart toying with her hair covered sex, while Dean just growled, jerked himself and watching her with a hungered growl.
For the first time since they started this conversation, he saw Deans eyes light up, along with that genuine nice looking smile. Dean spoke with what he would like to term as fondness, replying, “Thank you, Cas. Your reassurance and forgiveness means the world to me.”
Dean’s unshed tears made his heart ache, no omega liked to see their alpha in tears. Still he held on strong to his words, he deserved something good and he had to voice how he felt, despite the consequences.
He definitely felt this deep seated heavy ache trying to resurface. One that he hid so well before others, but, seemed to engulf him when he was all alone. He felt light tears pool his eyes, but, not enough to spill out and roll down his cheeks.
She had had enough, her motherly nature kicking in, before she knew it, she was walking towards Chuck, then a loud sounding slap cracked through the air. She sneered at the alpha who was holding his stinging cheek, “HOW DARE YOU LAY A HAND ON ANY OMEGA, CHUCK! YOU ARE DESPICABLE AND ROTTEN TO THE VERY CORE! A WRETCHED ALPHA AND LEADER! HAVE YOU NO SHAME!” She could feel John and Sam lurking somewhere behind her, ready to prance if Chuck ever dared hurt her- a big IF that is, because Chuck Milton was nothing but a ninny!
So patiently, John explained, “its ok for both of you to have more than brotherly feelings for each other. Why? Because, the reality is, even though Castiel will always be our son and a sibling to you and Sammy, he still does not share the same Winchester bloodline nor breed of wolf.” John carried on calmly, “So, I’m saying, it’s ok and that Mary and I suspected that someday that invisible, yet, caring bond between your wolves would only manifest into a romantic one”
That’s what he called Jimmy’s messed up hair. He took a sip of his beer, feeling his heart squeeze lightly. Yeah. He missed Jimmy so much.
The way Jimmy and he behaved around one another, would have anyone convinced that they were in love. But, like he had stated, it was more like a connection. He felt tethered to Jimmy and sometimes he wrecked his head trying to figure out
The omega nodded and reached out to close a warm palm round his elbow, words spoken in a smoky voice of, “We shall, alpha.”
So, that must have been how Cas found himself here. Because there’s no way he would have come here intentionally. Of all the places to have wandered in the bunker, he found his feet numbly coming to a stop outside the archives.
But it matters. Dean takes another long drink from his bottle because it matters. It matters so much, and Dean doesn’t think he has much room in himself for anything else to matter at all.
Dean leaned back slightly at that, and Cas couldn’t help but watch the way his jaw clenched, muscles popping. Dean breathed out slowly and said, “You didn’t… you couldn’t have given me a sign, something, that you heard me?”
“Cas, you know that’s not true,” Sam’s voice was softer as she said, “Dean, she just. She feels responsible for everything. And sometimes she takes that out on people she cares about.”
“Dean, it’s… Just talk to him in the morning. Tell him you didn’t mean it. It’s Cas. He’d understand, he- “
Dean fell quiet at that, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. Cas picked up from there, “Do you have something to say now?” He asked softly.
He simply pressed harder on the gas and said, “Deserve’s got nothing to do with it. It’s not possible.”
Cas made an attempt to talk to Sam the next day. Offering to find his own place, to give Sam, Eileen, and Dean their space.
“So then nothing,” Dean says, “Look. This has been great, but I’ve got a job to do. So, fuck Cas, don’t fuck Cas. I don’t care.”
Cas shifts again and let’s go of Dean’s wrist. Dean almost reaches for him until he realizes Cas has seated himself beside Dean leaning against the log. Cas has pressed his shoulder up against Dean’s. Their thighs are so close, Cas’s is practically on top of Dean’s. And there’s so much warmth radiating from Cas, Dean leans into it. If he wasn’t already drunk, he’d be drunk on this, just touching Cas.
Cas falls silent again, and something about it feels dangerous. There’s something electric in the air, like an oncoming lightning storm trapped inside the Impala.
Dean reaches over to rest on a hand on the cool handle of the demon blade, as he sees Ruby’s abandoned house appear from the darkness.
Sam sighed slightly. He should have guessed this would complicate things. He shifts the phone to his other ear and says, “I know, Dean.”
Rolling over, Dean finds the bed empty. But the sounds from outside the bedroom door leads him to a kitchen.
Cas took a long look at Sam before saying, “I need to do more research into ways to defeat Chuck. I can do that here.”
“I wouldn’t normally but…” Dean could see Jack still scrutinizing him out of the corner of his eye, “Dean, what are you doing?”
Dean rises, figuring if he’s quick, he can get to the front door before she has a chance to lunge forward.
Cas drew closer and took a seat at the table. Dean couldn’t help but watch the crease between her eyebrows. She grabbed her own glass and took a long drink, mostly to give her hands something to do. Partly to numb that ache in her chest.
He thinks of the apocalypse, of the seals and demons and Ruby. He thinks of killing Ruby. He thinks of sex with Ruby. He thinks of demon blood and addiction. He thinks of Sam, the child he was, the creature he became, the brother he is and always will be. He thinks of his dad. He thinks of hell. He thinks.
Cas blinked. Carefully avoiding Dean’s suddenly pointed gaze, he asked, “What would happen if you restored it?”
Dean can’t handle the look on Cas’s face, so he closes his eyes. He knows that if he doesn’t say it now, he never will so he says, “I need you, Cas.” His breath leaves him in one gust, leaving him gasping faintly for air. He opens his eyes to a pair of beautiful blue eyes staring back at him.
Then there’s the after. For a moment, he’s able to forget about seals and demons, Sam and Cas, the end of the world. For a moment, it’s just him and the pain and pleasure, physically burning his body. It’s finally enough.
He only sat outside of Ruby’s latest abandoned building for a few moments before he drove away. The thought of her rough hands and violence, the blood, everything, it’s too much. He can only drive aimlessly for so long though.
“Yeah, yeah. Come here,” Dean pulled his brother into a quick hug, and let his smile fall for just a moment.
Dean returned to the bunker first. He returned alone,  since Sam had slipped off to find Eileen, and Cas… Well, Dean returned alone.
Ruby leans back on the couch, her arms tossed carelessly over the top of it. Her chin is tipped back slightly, showing off the slope of her neck and the pop of her collarbone. She eyes him lightly, slowly taking him from top to bottom. He recognizes it for the invitation it is. He can’t be here anymore.
For a short while, Sam simply watched. She felt words blooming in her chest but also knew that Cas might not want to hear them.
Despite the fact that Dean seemed thoroughly absorbed in his food, he seemed to pause for a just a second as Cas sat next to him. Cas sat slightly away from Dean, sitting on the further side of his chair, and pulled a cup of coffee closer.
“Dean..” Cas whispered. One of Cas’s hands was on Dean’s face, her thumb running across Dean’s cheekbone.
Emotion twisting again, Dean’s blood started to boil as he recognized Sam’s tone of voice. Though Sam had only just started speaking, Dean could tell Sam was ready to deliver some emotional speech he’d probably been practicing all morning.
“I’m just trying to figure out if it’s because you feel guilty for sleeping with your brother’s ex – “
Sam watched Dean closely for a moment, which Dean might have commented on if he weren’t so occupied watching Cas.
Cas was still unconscious, but that worked for Dean. He took a slow breath and started, haltingly, “I don’t… This is hard. For me. I’m not good at words and feeling and crap. But… I don’t want to risk losing you, Cas. I… When you said… Man, there are a lot of things I assumed I could never have in this life. To be happy? I thought that was never in the cards, not for me.
Instead of voicing any of those painful things, Dean looked down to where Cas’s hand still rested on his leg and felt Cas’s tenderness overflowing inside of himself.
“Might what?” Dean asks, feeling a painful clench in his chest as he watches his brother nervously shifting.
John isn’t here. And Steve rested a hand on Dean’s knee as he lent forward to laugh at Dean’s story. And Dean felt himself go warm at the touch. Steve’s hand is still there, lingering like he forgot about it. Though, when Dean glances down at it, he feels Steve’s hand inch slightly higher.
“I felt it. You needed me. Now, is this about the seals or have you finally come to your senses about Ruby?”
Cas didn’t know where he was going at first. Just knew he couldn’t stand there anymore. Not with Jack gone (not gone but gone all the same). Certainly not with Dean. Not with what was left between them.
“Alright,” Dean stands suddenly. He feels like his legs might be about to give out and yet he can’t sit anymore, “Thanks for the chick-flick moment, man. But I’m good. We’re good. It’s all – “
“Ok,” Sam says. Dean catches Sam holding his hands up in surrender and says, “I just wanted to check.”
This wouldn’t be the first time Cas had lost his grace. He’d been human or near human a few times before, and each had been an adjustment. Each had been uniquely painful in that way only trauma and hurt and humanity could be.
“He’s not here,” Cas realized he was walking as he said that. He opened his bedroom door and found the small duffle full of clothes Sam had given him.
And even though she certainly wasn’t thinking, she faintly became aware of something cool on her cheeks. She opened her eyes and found the light fractured, wavering. Her fingertip wiped at that cool something on her cheek and came away damp.
Steven orders them another round of beers, and Dean knows he should leave. But why bother, right? Where would he even go? To Ruby’s for a drunken fuck? Back to the motel where he’ll likely walk in on his brother and –
“You really believe this is worth it? We are losing seals faster than we can save them, Sam is finally starting to recover, and if Ruby-“
Putting the glass down, she held a hand tightly to her eyes for a moment, then pulled her hand down her face. She used the arm of her flannel to wipe away the rest of the tears, until she paused and finally realized she was crying.
“Yeah,” he says unsteadily, “How would you know?” Dean wanted that to sound aloof, distant. It just sounds desperate.
Cas’s other hand found it’s way to Dean’s face. Cupped in Cas’s hands, breathing her in, tasting her, and the warm, oaky, burn of the whiskey still on her lips. Her lips.
“What?” he practically growls. His skin is crawling now. He can’t stand being here for much longer, especially not when she typically uses this time to talk about –
To the motel? Where he fought with Sam? Where he kissed Cas? Where he can walk in on his brother and his… his…
– him to ditch Ruby. Their sibling relationship has been fractured ever since. There’s been something of a frost between them, a cold front that manages to linger even when it seems like things might be starting to thaw.
Cas didn’t have much to pack, just some clothes from Sam. He buried the mixtape Dean had given him at the bottom of his bag. Looking at it hurt and knowing it was there made is bag feel heavier than it actually was. But leaving it behind or getting rid of it hurt too.
“When Jack was dead, in heaven. The Empty tried to take him, so Cas. Stupid bastard offered himself instead. Made a fucking deal.”
Dean doesn’t care about Ruby, not actually. But, she had a few good points. She can help them. And she does. Over the next few days, she feeds Dean intel on the demon’s plans. Where they are, what they’re doing. He’s not dumb enough to trust her. In fact, he’s sure she’s trying to distract him with small scale demons, sacrificing seals that don’t matter, so the heavy hitters can continue raising Lucifer.
Sam put his sponge down and turned to fully face Cas, “Still? But I thought…” Sam didn’t finish. He didn’t have to.
“Cas…” Dean said, and her voice came out broken again and that ache in her chest was too much and Cas. Cas’s face looked cracked open. Dean couldn’t begin to try to categorize the heavy emotions written there, other than to say that, more than ever before, Cas looked like the ancient, otherworldly being she was. She looked broken. She looked beautiful.
Which is why Dean has to bite back a growl of annoyance when he feels the telltale shift in the air and hears the faint flourish of wings that indicates the arrival of an angel.
“That’s different,” Dean said again, softer this time. Sam glanced at her sister to see the way the lines in her face have eased.
The solution is something that evades Cas, though. Grasping for it now feels nearly as futile as grasping for his grace. Both have next to nothing to offer.
Turning, he sees a dark-haired man, laying his jacket across the stool beside Dean before taking a seat. He slides some cash across the bar as the bartender leaves them with their drinks.
this is something Sam’s been doing since they made that agreement. Telling Ruby where they’ll be so she can hide out nearby and Sam can… can what? Get his blood fix? Fuck her? Both?
Glancing at him from the corner of his eye, Dean can see Sam pensively stare out the window. God, he can practically hear the wheels turning in that oversized head of his.
The thing is, logically, Dean knows Sam and Cas haven’t even been that bad. In fact, an outsider might not even be able to tell that anything’s going on between them. Cas still watches over Dean, performing his heavenly duty, or whatever. He still comes when Dean calls, assists when he can. He’s still stilted and awkward (so, there goes Dean’s theory that Cas would loosen up if he got laid).
That old familiar hurt worked its way through his chest as Cas thought about those last few words he’d said to Dean. He realized he doesn’t know whether he believes it at all. He wants to, he needs to – the way a human body needs sunlight or touch – he needs to believe that Dean didn’t mean everything he said.
Since Sam and Cas. Maybe before. Maybe just since Cas. Maybe just since Cas started to become so essential to him.
So, maybe that’s all this is. Sam, making jabs, trying to annoy Dean like a little brother should. Sam, trying to thaw the frost, to bury the bad feelings and move forward. They certainly have enough on their plates without dealing with interpersonal conflicts, blood addictions, and drug-dealing demons.
Cas nodded slightly. Jack rose, stepping back from the table, and said, “If you want, you don’t have to decide right now. Just pray to me and let me know what you decide.”
“Right,” Sam seems to think on something for a moment. The lingering feeling of Steve, hell even Ruby and the hunt before that, washes over Dean.
“Why is this angel so important to you, Dean? You know what you’re risking here, right? For a guy who up and vanished. Why is he so important?”
“I can’t stay here, Sam,” Cas said again, “Not as a human. And I don’t believe Dean would want me to.”
She steps toward him, “You let me live,” another step and she’s dragging him in again, lips and breath and teeth against his neck. She pulls her mouth away but stays in his space. Right in his face, words and warmth ghosting across his face she whispers, “And we can do that again.”
Dean rises with a groan and grabs the phone just as the call goes to voicemail. Thinking it may be about the case, Dean opens the phone. Only to freeze.
“The deal, Sam,” his brother’s voice was deeper, suddenly calmer in a way that almost frightened Sam, “I can’t. If he knows, if he... Sam, if I apologize, tell him I didn’t mean it, tell him I…”
With each burst of thunder, he’d simply go still, letting Mary hold him tight and press warmth and comfort back into him with her hands.
Dean leaned into it. He kissed Cas back gently, like they had time. He kissed Cas knowing this was the first of many, a lifetime. He kissed Cas like he deserved it. They both did.
But she paused. But she held her breath, and took another step closer, her view into Cas’s room widening. Now she could see Cas’s legs, the ends of her trench coat. Another step closer and Dean could see Cas’s hands, tightly clenched together, rested near her stomach.
Dean swallowed another drink and said, “Yeah. Yeah, it fucking came. And Billie broken the door and I thought… Sammy, I knew he was going to die. Whether it was Billie or the Empty, I… I couldn’t watch it. Sammy, I… I…”
Cas shifts, he fingers flexing around Dean’s wrists. He’s hunched awkwardly over Dean, which can’t possibly be comfortable. But there’s something strange in his eyes that Dean can’t identify.
Aside from Dean’s anger, calmed slightly from her earlier rampage but still present nonetheless, Cas had her own quiet frustration brewing. Though, despite Cas’s glares and pointed attempts at ignoring Sam and Dean, they were all acutely aware that anyone could have left. And no one did.
“Do what you want, Cas.” Dean said. It could have sounded harsh. Maybe it should have sounded like a biting dismissal, like the old Dean who was overflowing with anger. Instead, it sounded gentle.
But still. He needs Cas. He needs Cas so much that he can’t breathe through it. So, he drinks through it. He raises the bottle toward his lips, a laugh bubbling through his chest at the way the world tilts and pitches from side to side, when the bottle stops.
So, why does anything else even matter. Why does it matter that Sam lied to him or that Dean is fucking Ruby or that Sam is fucking Cas or that Dean kissed Cas? How could any of that matter at all when the world is about to end because they aren’t good enough?
He knew why. It was Cas. It was always Cas. And more than anything, it was finally knowing that it was possible. Cas felt the same way. Cas loved him. Cas was happy with him.
Feeling like he’s about to crawl out of his skin, Dean looks away from her and marches toward the door.
And then everything that followed. Emotions changed like a sudden cold snap or the fickle shift of the breeze.
Dean settles himself on a bar stool near the door, far from any other strangers drinking alone. He orders a shot of whiskey and a beer, not relaxing into his seat until his finish both and starts sipping on his second round.
Dean gave himself a few moments, feeling nauseous. Not from a hangover but from the clear memory of his phone call with Sam.
Sam waited for Dean to continue. Heard him swallow another drink of whatever liquor he got his hands on and had the urge to tell him to slow down.
With a wave of hand, Jack healed all of Dean’s physical wounds. He found himself wanting to ask Jack to put them back.
Even the drive, even Baby wasn’t enough to help him stow this. Pulling off the road, Dean staggered out of Baby, leaving her running.
Dean had only ever kissed a boy once. He was sixteen, new to school and prepared to leave it within the next few months. Which simply meant that Dean spent the majority of his class schedule loitering behind the school building bumming hits off the pot heads.
Over the weeks they’d slogged through a monstrous warzone, Benny had argued every angle he could thing of. Though he never truly gave up that fight, there was one moment when he finally hit a breaking point. Benny asked the question Dean wouldn’t let himself touch with a 10-foot pole. Benny asked why.
Jack’s head titled in a way that reminded Dean of Cas as he said, “No. I told you, that’s not going to happen anymore. No, actually, I decided it was time we talked.”
Though that wasn’t entirely true. Inside, Cas was thinking of the job interview he was waiting the hear back from, about finding his own place, about leaving the bunker behind and trying, really, finally trying to move on.
Slowly, Dean eased his arms out from between their chests and wrapped them back around Cas, pulling him closer. He tucked his face against Cas’s neck, and felt as much as heard Cas’s pulse beating just as hard as his.
Sam jumps up from his spot in bed. His long hair is in a tangle around his face, but he sweeps it back with one hand, “Dean?”
The kitchen table was strewn with debris of another comfortable dinner, Dean had stepped out, leaving just Cas and Sam to clean the dishes.
“Dude,” Sam felt fatigue seeping into his voice anyway, “it’s barely been 24 hours.” He had a feeling Dean might react like this to the move but had expected him to hold out at least a week. Enough time that Sam could have shown him nothing was really going to change between them.
“I’m the child?” Dean stood up at that. She gestured toward the door as she said, “She’s the one who walked away and vanished.”
Carefully, he reached forward and took Cas’s hand where it was folded across his chest. Dean slid closer to Cas on the small bed and held Cas’s hand in both of his. From underneath, he wound their finger together, and found that he couldn’t take his eyes away from that sight.
Dean holds back an ugly reply. In fact, he holds back several. After a moment of white knuckling his steering wheel, he forces a breath out and simply says, “Just go, Cas.”
He doesn’t know why he says it, and the moment the words escape his mouth he wishes he could bring them back. Still, Dean says, “He might still be sleeping with her.”
It was only after several hours of walking, long after the sun had set, when a faint ache had worked its way into his knees and hips, that Cas thought to reach into his grace. It had been failing before but maybe…
“She wants to be here; you’re just treating her like shit. She would stay, things could be ok if you would just apologize.”
“Your brother is concerned around you,” Cas falls silent for a moment and Dean takes a chance to glance at him.
Dean shifted slightly, suddenly uncomfortable. But Sam continued as if she didn’t notice, “You do and have done, the same things you’re mad at Cas for.”
She didn’t. Instead, Cas took a deep drink from her glass, finishing the whiskey with a serene composure, and said, “Sam has been concerned I’m going to leave again. Which had crossed my mind,” in her periphery, Dean saw Cas look down to the empty glass in her hand, “But with Chuck clearly planning something, that doesn’t seem wise for now.”
He simply took in Cas’s face for a moment. For how often he found himself studying it, he couldn’t ever seem to get enough. The lines and planes and angles that came together to make up Cas’s handsome features were only a small part of what made Cas so important to him.
Dean’s fist was still holding tightly to Cas’s collar, though Cas was more aware of Dean’s other hand, which was wrapped around Cas’s wrist.
And Ruby kept her word, cut Sam off. Even though Sam didn’t open up to Dean about it, he saw the signs of withdraw. His clammy skin and roaming eyes, the twitch, the sleeplessness, the erratic mood swings. They may be starting to fade, but Dean’s not letting Sam anywhere near a demon again for a long time.
Despite Sam’s best efforts, the dinner felt awkward. Dean ate quickly and left the kitchen while everyone was still eating, mumbling something about walking Miracle.
Because that was something else to remember. This deal is extended far beyond his and Dean’s relationship. It was Cas’s entire future. To regain his grace, to return to heaven, would also be to condemn himself to eternity. Eternity without happiness, lest the Empty take him anyway.
He ran down the stairs, taking them two at a time, and paused in the war room, listening for a moment.
Dean glances quickly at his brother, looking for that telltale glint in his eye or quirk of the lip that gives his jokes away every time. Sam is still facing forward, gaze tipped downward toward his clasped hands.
He thought of how neither had been fully able to tell him the truth about what happened there. But the haunted, deadened look in their eyes when they met Sam and Jack shortly after was something Sam couldn’t seem to forget.
It’s only after a few moments of driving that Dean realizes he’s headed towards Ruby. He pulls over instead. In his rush to leave the motel, didn’t stop to put a new tape in the tape deck, so now he sits in silence. His mind races.
That vile thing makes itself known again. Like it needs to remind Dean that he can never really escape this feeling. It’s a part of him.
Something warm is wrapped solidly around his wrist. Dean squints at it for a moment before he recognizes that it’s a hand. His eyes shift upward as he realizes that hand is connected to arm, which is connected to a shoulder, which leads Dean to a blue necktie hanging askew.
Sam allowed herself one moment. She tucked her hair behind her ears, took a deep breath, and knocked on Dean’s door. The loud music – Pink Floyd, Dean’s mopping music – didn’t pause and Sam heard no sound of Dean getting up.
Somewhere between then and the current moment, Dead made his way back to that room, the archive. He tumbled through the hole Billie had left where the door once was, and made his way to the back wall.
After sometime, he managed to pulled back and say seriously, “You stink.” He then dragged himself to the bathroom, with Miracle following closely behind.
He ignored Dean’s sharp breath and watched Jack. Thinking carefully, Jack answered, “The Empty would still want to take you. I don’t think it would be safe for you here – on Earth.”
Head swimming, he leaned against the wall across from the door and glanced at the deep cut across his palm. A few drops of blood fell to the ground. He tried to focus his grace into his hand, tried to heal it. The dull glow stuttered in his palm, flaring bright for a second then unsteadily fading.
Maybe that was why Dean paused. She had been heading to the kitchen, hoping to stock up on beers while Sam was asleep. She’d planned to pass by Cas’s room on the way, solely to make sure Cas was there. To ensure there was no chance of awkwardly running into her when she’d rather simply grab her beers and get back
When his legs start to feel unsteady under him, he finds fallen log that serves as a great backrest. Dean practically collapses to the ground, leans against the log, and takes another swig from the bottle. It’s more than half empty now and Dean laughs faintly at the sight of it.
Just when he thought Dean might have given up on the story, Dean rushed through the next part as quickly as he could, “Empty started to appear ‘n Billie was coming ‘s I pushed Cas away ‘n grabbed Billie.” He huffs a humorless laugh, “Was just… was just dumb stupid luck. I shoved her right into the Empty. ‘N it took her.
Cas glances down and wraps his hand back around Dean’s wrist where Dean still holds the bottle. Dean looks at the spot where their skin meets as Cas says, “I can feel it. Prayers aren’t just words. They can be feelings, emotions, desires.”
Dean shook his head, focus stuck on the road. He didn’t want to talk, and yet he found he couldn’t stop himself from saying, “He doesn’t want to be human, Jack. He won’t- he can’t- “
“Jack,” Dean said gently, breaking Jack out of his excitement, “Did you…” Dean sighed and started again, “I’m happy for you, kid. Hell, I’m proud of you… I don’t know if I have a right to say that to you. I wasn’t… good to you. And I wish I could have done things –“
“No. Dean,” Sam said, despite his exhaustion, concern caught in his throat. He tried to sound more awake, “It’s fine. Not like talking on the phone will wake Eileen.”
“I don’t believe you meant everything you said.” Cas didn’t have to specify; they both knew he meant the archives.
Stepped out is maybe too kind a word. Stormed out is more like it. Dean could be like a storm when she was angry or upset. Her hands trembling like they’re caught in a gust of wind, her voice cracking like thunder, her hands lashing out like lightening.
Jack was silent. Dean spared a quick glance and saw the pensive expression on Jack’s face, something similar to the look he’d had when Dean had taught him to shoot. He felt a little more hollow at that.
This is when he should leave, right? Call a cab or simply crash in Baby’s back seat until he sobers up. This is when he would have left. This is when his dad, and later the ghost of his dad, would cast him a disapproving look. Dean would shrug it off as he’d leave the bar alone; he’s a charming guy just making friends. But his dad –
Out of the corner of his eye, Sam saw Dean’s shoulders relax slightly. While he was still hunched over the wheel racing toward the bunker with no real course of action in mind, at least he knew he’d had Sam. He’d always have Sam.
After the weeks they spent, trekking through the nothing, fighting for their lives for the sake of his Angel – Benny’s term not Dean’s – Dean had lost track of how many times he and Benny had had the same conversation. Arguing over whether it was worth it, whether Cas was worth it, to miss their chance at getting out.
Sex with Ruby is nearly the same as fighting her. It’s violent. They throw each other with more force than necessary. Biting, scratching, pulling at each other hard enough to bruise, to draw blood. Already bloody and wounded from his recent fight with another demon at another seal, Ruby tears open the fresh scabs lining his limbs.
“Hm, yeah. And that’s why he begged me to meet him in the middle of bumblefuck, right? I mean, come on, Dean, it definitely wasn’t for a screw. That’s what your angel’s for, right?”
“Dean,” Cas’s hand comes to rest on Dean’s upper arm, and he takes and immense amount of concentration to not veer them off the road.
“I can’t hear your prayers,” Cas’s piercing blue eyes caught Sam. She looked fierce, but underneath that, scared, “My grace is failing and Dean… She doesn’t want me here.”
The few trees lining the road were a blur that soon faded into open plains. The road stretched onward, further into the horizon than Dean could see, no building, towns, or other cars to interrupt the landscape.  Dean let his foot fall, cranked his music higher, and let the landscape continue to blur.
“No. I mean, of course she can’t be trusted, Cas. I’m not stupid, man. But if I can use her, and kill a few demons while I’m at it then-“
Jack was watching him again. Hands clenching tighter around the wheel, Dean refused to meet his gaze. Though he didn’t have to, cause Jack’s in everything now. So, Dean wasn’t all that surprised when Jack said, “You don’t think you both deserve to be happy?”
Even now, as he finds himself glancing around for the demon blade, he feels off kilter.  He can’t even remember that last place he had it. Did he lose it in the fight or drop it when they’d started kissing?
Dean blinks, holding his keys a little too tightly, he looks up toward Sam. His brother is hunched over his laptop again, looking worried. He has to remind himself that they had been fighting just yesterday.
And Sam is still Sam. In fact, that frost between them after the Ruby thing is finally truly melting. Sam’s smiling more again, making jokes in the car, and laughing with Dean without shutting himself down. They still haven’t attempted a demon hunt, it’s still too much of a risk, but killing monsters and hunting ghosts together finally feels like the old days.
“And if you choose heaven, know that Jack, Dean, and I won’t rest until we get you out of that deal.”
Sam didn’t know what to say to that. He wished slightly that he could reach out to his brother. Offer him some comfort the way Dean so often had for him. Instead, he said, “How far are we?”
The Empty and Billie gone, having vanished as Cas crashed to a low he’d never felt. Dean’s eyes were close and overly bright. He’d stopped yelling now, but it seemed as if his words continued to bounce off the broken walls around them, cutting through the crushing silence.
“I don’t expect you to forgive me. And I won’t beg you to. I have done – I have always done what I think is right. If I could go back, I know I’d do it all the same,” Cas finished the whiskey in one gulp, then rose. She paused for a moment, like she had something else to say. Instead, she tapped a hand against the table and turned away.
Dean kept his mind on the road. At some point, Sam put a random tape in the tape deck, but Dean could hardly even hear the music over his own heart pounding in his ears. His breath came out ragged but he tried to control his breathing solely for Sam’s sake.
“You said you didn’t care if I slept with Cas. And I’m giving you an out here man. If it bothers you – “
With just the tips of her fingers, Cas pulled the glass closer to her. She seemed to have no interest in drinking and, given the way the perched on the edge of the chair, she seemed ready to leave at a moment’s notice.
As a child, it had been tears over a broken toy or being denied a second piece of pie. Despite all the discipline and obedience John had trained and beaten into him, Dean sometimes could still feel that kid. Sure, he did better at burying the tears, and he eventually learned that it’s better to get away, to find somewhere quiet and isolated where he can thrash without John or Sam seeing, but he still sometimes hit that breaking point.
“That’s not what I mean. She takes things out on you yes. She gets angry at you, blames you, the same as me. But she forgives you. Even when she’s furious with you she can’t help but forgive you anyway. She forgives everyone.
“Hello,” said Jack, standing in the middle of Dean’s room like he hasn’t vanished for ages, like he wasn’t god.
Dean grabs Ruby by the waist, he feels her long nails dig into his shoulder again mercilessly. He reaches beneath her shirt, feels her warm skin, and helps her take the top off completely. Her hands go to his zipper as her lips find his again.
Sam ignored her, “And every time you lie and hide things, every time it falls apart and we fight, I forgive you. Because I love you.”
So, Dean had stormed out. Cas and Sam knew she would take a drive. Knew she would try to calm down. Knew she would come back, still angry, but maybe it’ll be buried slightly better.
What he said, what he did to Cas, goes beyond this deal with the Empty. Or maybe it simply started before then, only to be cemented by the things he said. He’d taking everything from Cas, has already taken everything from him. And somehow, he still asked for more.
Dean starts to shake his head, but Sam talks over him, “I was doing good, though, Dean. I’m willing to do it your way, I can try. But… it’s like… Ever since I found out about Yellow Eyes, about the” he takes a deep breath, “about the demon blood in me. I’ve felt dirty. Unclean. Because I am. Down to my blood, I am.
Overwhelmed by the sudden need to hit Cas, Dean turns to face him. Hands slightly raised, clenched into tight fists, he freezes. Cas is standing too close. He’s always standing too close. Why is he always standing so close?
Perhaps he felt a touch of wonder, too. That he was able to feel so much all at once. That one simple action, a few words, could be enough to draw so much out of him. He saw, then and now, why people compare emotions to storms. Because they are just as wild, as powerful, as unpredictable. They are just as natural and vital. They just are.
She knew, though, that sometimes, he needed slip out in the night to check on Dean or catch a glimpse of Cas, just to remind himself that his family is all here. Almost all here. He tires not to miss Jack.
Jack looked away from Cas and smiled, “Well, I rebuilt every universe Chuck destroyed, at least all the habitable, non-terrible ones. He made quiet a few hostile planets like Apocalypse World, but don’t worry, I fixed those up to. I made them a lot less terrible. You should check them out some time with the telescope thingy!
“That’s not true. Cas, please just stay and let me try to talk to Dean. I know I can get her to see-“
Dean didn’t make it back to her room. She didn’t trust her traitorous legs not to carry her back to Cas. So, instead, she’d retrieved the whiskey poured some into a glass and settled herself at one of the tables in the library.
Cas had seriously intended to leave. He didn’t want to be here when Dean got back, he wanted to be somewhere far away. Somehow it seemed to him like it would be easier to see the bigger picture, to find the solution, if he could just get away.
It almost looked like Cas was sleeping. Like Cas was having a bad dream. Dean saw her take a troubled breath in, and that crease between her eyes somehow grew deeper.
Dean quickly noticed when Sam and Eileen start to shift toward sleeping at her place more. First, they had spent every day at the bunker, but that soon became most days, then some days. Now it’s just down to once or twice a week.
“Anyway. Then, I started fixing heaven. I made enough angels that everything is running smoothly up there again. Oh! And I remade the humans’ heaven, too. But I won’t spoil that for you,” Jack said with a nod, “Otherwise, I’ve been learning and exploring. I’ve seen so many remarkable things. And you won’t believe what I’ve learn about aliens- “
The idea of even living beyond forty seemed like a pipedream, but to ask to be happy, too? That would have been too much. And it had never mattered. He’d always been content with his life, and wasn’t that the same? Wasn’t that enough?
He shifted so he was facing Cas more directly, “I won’t restore your grace. Within the next few days or so, you’ll be human.”
He tells Steve to keep the lights off, which doesn’t seem to be a problem. There’s a lot of stumbling, falling over, light swearing. Dean’s had more to drink than he realized, but he’s able to undo his pants with little issue.
Cas didn’t seem to have a response to that. Nonetheless, he continued staring at Sam for another moment before looking away. He seemed to take in the room for a second before he said, “I can’t stay here.”
He turns back, just for a moment. Hand on the door, he turns back and sees his brother sitting on the edge of the bed.
Was, though. He was. But now, Cas would likely choose to return to heaven and Dean would never have a chance to fix things.
Dean’s eyes instinctively sweep the house of the demon blade. Unfortunately, it’s still at home in his jacket pocket, resting on the floor just past Ruby.
When Steve pulls away, Dean opens his eyes. With nothing more than the streetlights through the window providing some back lighting, Steve’s features are lost. All Dean can see is his dark hair, now looking vaguely wild and windswept.
At first, it had simply been too many emotions to name, more perhaps that Cas had ever felt in his life and certainly more than he’d known in his previous existence in heaven.
It’s never been that easy before, but maybe getting laid did help remove that stick from his ass, at least a little bit. Cas vanishes with a faint
Dean eased Baby onto the shoulder of the road again. Aiming for levity, he said, “You’re not half bad at being god, kid.”
But then Ruby follows him, setting onto his lap, and her hands are rough, unnaturally strong. And with his eyes closed, with her shoving him back once again, forcefully tearing his flannel off, with his eyes closed he thinks of –
“Cas,” Sam said slightly more urgently. Cas stood and Sam did the same, taking a small step toward her, “Please don’t go again.”
He sits, he downs the rest of the second whiskey and sips on another beer. Something bad is inside him. Something vile is winding its way through his insides. Hunting, killing demons, saving seals, hell even sleeping with Ruby, it can distract him from it for a bit. But it’s always there. It’s poisoning him. He’s poison. And this vile thing, it’s been growing every day.
Cas’s hand was warm, and as he pressed his fingertips lightly into Dean’s jeans, Dean realized he’d been trembling. He forced his muscles to relax but found that Cas’s steady warmth made it easy. That hand, pressing comfort back into him, pouring in a kind of tenderness Dean didn’t know he craved, should have been magic. In fact, Dean wondered for a moment if Cas wasn’t wasting his grace trying to sooth Dean, even after everything.
With no reply, Dean took off again, running toward the room Cas had been sleeping in. Upon taking in the empty room, he took off again. Scouring the library, the shooting range, the kitchen, even his and Sam’s rooms. He even let himself glance inside the archives, fending of the memories lingering in shadows as he did so.
Cas spent the day laying on his bed staring at the ceiling listening to Dean slam every door he came across. Every now and then, Cas caught himself praying to Jack and forced himself to stop. Jack didn’t need to feel the anguish that was curling through his soul right now.
Gabe snorted, “Well, apparently, she says she was Dean’s mate to be, once….and that they attended the same preschool and kindergarten. She says that they were dating then.”
Now, here he was, sitting in his car, bright eyed and bushy tailed, smiling all the way to work. He didn’t want to keep his hopes up, but, he also didn’t want to squander it. He had woken up a changed man, for sure. He had promised himself that he would do as Charlie had said, when they first started on their beers.
No way could he deny his want any longer. He chucked his horn filled with wine aside so hastily and began undoing his clothes until he was standing their proud and leaking. He prowled towards the bed like a hungry lion stalking its prey, moaning as the smell of apple pie wafting from the omega got stronger.
Dean knew she was right. He couldn’t hurt her in any way, mostly because it wasn’t in his nature to harm any omega. Nevertheless, he wasn’t going to stay mum. He pointed out, “yes I can’t hurt you, physically, but, don’t you ever mistake me for someone who will just lay around idle. I will find a way to get you off Cas and I’s back! Mark my damn words! In the meantime, if you ever get handsy with me again, I will report you. That is still sexual harassment!”
Last night, he saw a completely different side to Dean. A more relaxed, charming and carefree one. The deep crinkles in the corner of Dean’s eyes as the man barked out in laughter, was damn near heart melting. And, he found himself slowly slipping into the teen who had total ‘
He watched how happy Mary and John were as they engulfed their eldest pup in their arms. Mary swooned over how gorgeous her alpha son had seemed to grow every year and John showed just how proud he was of his boy- with his words and hugs.
“Well you’re happy. Did Cas finally let ya kiss him or what?” Sam teased while helping him with fixing up baby.
John had a way of communicating with the pack wolves. All he had to do was introduce the happy couple with his eyes. Dean and Cas cozy actions- leaning into each other, rubbing heads affectionately- was enough to spell out mates. And the presence of Dean’s scent on Castiel sealed all .
Castiel tore his lips lightly from a whinging equally breathless Dean. They continued to grind gently, just enjoying the feeling of rubbing along each others cocks. Castiel uttered in a rough tone, “You know this is getting more dangerous, Dean”.
From his little, isolated cabin, built on a lonely hilltop, he could see everything. Just down the foot of the hill was a grand outdoor setup of lights, tables, chairs- all adorned in white décor.
Dean saw his parents smiling softly at him, but somehow he felt like the world was loud around them. He could hear the wind, feel the breeze and scent the excitement. Meanwhile, his heart was beating hard against his chest, feeling his words filled with unmistakeable wonder slip out his mouth, “Castiel’s pregnant?”
“It was AWESOME, Daddy!” Kaylen laid his now empty lemonade glass unto the tea table and ran over to him. He crouched down, so his baby could run into his arms, carrying him when he stood.
Momma stopped what she was doing, taking a deep breath, before turning to smile at him. She walked over to him and sat down on the stool next to his. She held a hand and said, “Baby, Dean is going through…something….all alphas go through....called a rut. He’s a teen now, which means his alpha body is changing and adapting to his shift in biology. It’s his first time experiencing this change, so, he is being guided by daddy on how to handle things the right way, to ease his…sufferings. Now, during that time, it is important that any omega keep away from him. We don’t want to confuse and make things harder on Dean. So, we must keep away.” She adds, “Is this clear, Castiel? You are not to go into Dean’s room, until all is cleared by daddy.”
As Sam and Jack’s backs were turned, suddenly Dean felt a warm hand slide down his back and then grab his ass. He just barely stifled an affronted gasp as he jumped away from Cas, who looked like the cat that ate the canary. The angel’s blue eyes bore into him hungrily, and Dean felt like a blushing maiden, suddenly wanting to hide himself from Cas’s penetrating gaze. He felt as if he was naked as a jaybird even though he was fully dressed. Then Sam hopped down and Cas molded his face into a neutral expression.
Dean stayed upstairs and sulked until dinner. Eileen came home from work and was delighted when she found that Castiel was fluent at sign language. This led to Castiel guilelessly revealing that he was fluent in nine different languages, including ASL, much to Sam and Eileen’s shock.
Charlie stared at him from the lecture podium with a bemused expression. “I guess class is dismissed.”
Dean looked at his flannel and realized it was, in fact, the shirt he was wearing the day before, when Cas had been hit with the potion. He’d taken it off to wipe Cas’s face clean. He’d grabbed it on his way out at random, not even thinking about it. “Oh. Crap.”
“Relax, I’m just messin’ with ya,” Dr. Bradbury said, plopping down at her desk and throwing her checkered Converse up on the desk. “People are always surprised by my age. Truth is I’m older than I look, I just look young because I have incredible skin and I buy all my clothes from Hot Topic.”
“Tell me exactly what happened, in excruciating detail. And definitely don’t forget about what the narrator said.
Castiel felt his intestines start tying themselves up in knots every time he saw his manager, Naomi, coming up the row toward him with her clipboard. He worked his arms even faster to get this Paw Patrol plushie stuffed for a little boy in Texas.
They heard clambering footsteps inside the house, and suddenly the red door with the faded, peeling paint was flung open by the same squirrely-looking man that had been on TV this morning, dressed in a ratty old robe and slippers.
It was like Castiel was watching everything happen in slow motion. Dean was getting up, brushing himself off, unaware of the danger right behind him.
“No, no, you don’t have to-” But Sam was already barreling, determined, through the front door with Castiel in tow.
“I...also have been tested since my last partner, and I’m clean as well.” Cas didn’t disclose the fact that he hadn’t been sexually active since college, so it had been literal
“More...up north,” Castiel fudged the truth. He didn’t like lying, since The Bible said lying was a sin, but Gabriel had advised him that telling people was raised by angels wasn’t likely to go over well.
You ever wondered why we put angels at the top of our Christmas trees? Well, because angels are real. I know, I didn’t believe it myself, but they are. They watch over us at Christmas time, making sure everyone has safe holiday travels and perfect white Christmas snowfalls, but mostly what they do is help out Santa. Yeah, I know, you thought it was elves, didn’t you. That’s the part everyone gets wrong.
” smirk on his own face and his (Cas’s) stomach flipped. Man, if he didn’t know that his fella was an angel, he’d swear the guy was an incubus or something. The guy was so inexplicably
Gabriel had never been the most...conventional angel in the garrison. But neither Santa nor the other angels could’ve ever predicted he would bring that little baby up North with him.
“Yep. I’m Dr. Mills, I’ve been overseeing your recovery. It was touch and go there for awhile, but you managed to pull through. We weren’t sure you were going to make it.”
“Good,” said Dean with a smile. “‘Cause if it’s alright by you, I’d like to bypass the condoms, at least this round.”
Castiel shook his head. “You were just trying to help. You’re worried your brother’s heart will be broken again. I promise you, I will treat Dean’s heart as if it were a snowglobe.”
“And you think that’s what you would have gotten,” Cas said. “You don’t think you’d have accidentally manifested something...self-indulgent?”
Sam cleared his throat, got out his phone, and pressed the screen. Suddenly, Cas’s voice came out of the tiny speaker:
They walked along the sidewalk to the bus stop and Cas was struck with how beautiful the day was. But the sky and the grass and trees paled in comparison to Dean in the sunlight, his green eyes alight and the honey blonde highlights in his hair gleaming and the faint spray of freckles on his nose and cheeks popping out. “First day back from vacation,” Dean commented, squeezing Cas’s hand. “Bummer.”
“Of course, dude. I’m your mentor, I’m not just gonna abandon you before a fight! Although, I am gonna use your little girl’s room before we go because I’m lowkey lactose intolerant and all this ice cream is not gonna be kind to my insides.”
Castiel blushed. No one had ever sweet-talked him this way. One of his past partners had liked to call him a cockslut and a good little bitch, and Cas hadn’t liked that very much, but his partner seemed to enjoy degrading him, so Cas grinned and bore it. He found he
“Thank you,” Cas said, ambling past her, weaving through the small, dark, cramped living room to where Chuck sat in front of his typewriter, head buried in his hands. “Hello, Chuck,” said Castiel softly.
Gabriel frowned. “Yes, well, Castiel, there’s something you should know about Dean...he’s on the naughty list.”
“Yes. That marking on your arm you’ve always wondered about? It’s a soulmate mark. Most humans have them. It’s meant to guide you to the human you’re destined to be with, whether they’re your best friend, your romantic partner, or both.”
Nevertheless, Dean was seething all the way home, muttering murderous threats under his breath. Sam looked at Cas, his eyes clearly saying,
that happens, you can offer your services to the workshop.” She stamped Castiel’s form with a big rubber stamp and tore it off, handing it to him. “Report to Michael. Dismissed.”
“It’s terrible,” Castiel said, taking a seat on Charlie’s small, ratty couch. “Dean hates me even more now. I need to face facts, I’m a dead man walking.” Castiel commended himself on at least having made out a will five years ago when he started working for the IRS.
“Lying in bed sick is not a vacation. You’ve got a lot of time saved up. I’m recommending you use some of it.”
and no consequences to boot. You could live out the rest of your pathetic existence perfectly content, and no one else would be none the wiser. Deanie Boy would never know you tricked him into loving you back. But if you try to weasel out of our deal on a technicality, Castiel, if you deny me the pleasure of destroying you...” The Empty took a step forward and snarled in his face. “Then the terms of our agreement are void, and the boy is forfeit. Good luck trying to save him from me like he saved you.”
“Hey, Novak,” said Balthazar, putting a friendly hand on his shoulder. “What’s 69 times 420?” He looked at Gabriel and the pair snickered. The two resident jokesters of the office were rarely seen apart at work, and Castiel wondered if they ever got any work done at all.
Claire helped him pick out a guitar strap, a travel case, a capo, and a guitar stand, and also gave him a business card for a YouTuber who gave free online tutorials for guitarists who were just starting out. “That’s my girlfriend Kaia,” Claire gushed as Castiel paid. “We have a band with our friends, The Wayward Sisters. Our cover of ‘Black Betty’ is lit. Check us out, we’re on Spotify.”
“But you came back to me,” Dean continued, cupping his face. “Just like you did when Jack saved you from the Empty. Our little miracle kid.”
“Huh. I think the blue looked better—goes with your eyes.” Picking up a tray of tools, Dean disappeared behind a 2004 Hyandai.
Sam shared a knowing smile with Castiel once the elder Winchester was out of earshot. “He likes you.”
Santa nodded slowly. “Alright then.” She turned away, her long red coat swirling around her ankles. “Oh by the way,” she asked, turning to look back over her shoulder. “What’s the little tyke’s name?”
“You lounged around your apartment like a sad sack all day yesterday and the narrator didn’t have anything to say, right? Keep that up! Tomorrow, you sit on your couch, you watch TV, and you do
Suddenly Dean seemed...apprehensive. “Uh, no, that’s alright. I, uh...I’d rather wait for the main event if you don’t mind.”
Dean was groaning in earnest at Cas’s words and his hand slowly stroking his cock, twitching with pleasure at his touch. “Cas, I’m n-not gonna last long,” he panted.
Cas had left just enough of his own grace in Jimmy Novak’s vessel to trick the Empty. Dean had none of the angel’s powers (although his eyes had glowed white-blue once during a hunt a few weeks ago), and Cas would never be able to leave Dean to go into another vessel; he was simply too weak.
snaked Dean’s hand into his pajama pants and wrapped it around his cock, squeezing gently. Dean bucked into the touch. “Oh, fuck, Cas,” he groaned.
”Hey, you totally could, with enough practice and...” Suddenly, Dean’s face fell. “...and time,” he finished quietly. “Jesus Christ, I’m sorry, Cas, me and my big dumb mouth...”
At 3:47 in the afternoon (according to Castiel’s wristwatch, left abandoned on his nightstand), the enormous metal jaws of a construction excavator burst through the living room wall of Castiel’s apartment. With a screech, Castiel flung himself behind the arm of his couch, taking cover from the bits of glass and shards of wood flying across the room. Castiel peeped out to see the excavator clamp around the detritus of his now wrecked wall and slowly retreat, and nestled within its industrial grasp on a bed of broken boards, crumbled drywall, and insulation fluff, was his TV.
The barn doors flew open and sparks rained from the ceiling lamps as a figure in a long coat slowly crossed the threshold.
“Oh god, I’m so sorry, did I break your tools?!” Castiel panicked, very aware of the fact that he was back in the arms of the sexy mechanic for the second time in ten minutes.
“Well, technically, it’s supposed to give you ‘what your heart desires.’” Sam looked significantly at Cas.
What Castiel had not understood on that Thursday six weeks ago, the Thursday he’d first met Dean Winchester, the Thursday that his watch had suddenly stopped working, the Thursday that had started it all...was that when he reset his watch...it had been off by three minutes.
“Yeah. Potion’s mojo wore off as soon as I took off the shirt. Don’t worry, I made sure to throw it in the washing machine, on the heavy cycle.”
Contrary to popular belief, Dean wasn’t a total idiot. He knew full well there was more to his and the angel’s bond than friendship. Granted, he’d believed up until this moment that those notions were solely on his end, but neither of them had ever had the courage to make the first move, so for years they’d played this melancholy little game of emotional chicken. Now Cas had thrown all his cards on the table, folded the game, called Dean’s bluff, whatever poker metaphor was fitting for this particular scenario. Stakes were high, aces were wild, and Dean was all in.
The people around Castiel moved forward as the “DON’T WALK” sign changed to “WALK”, but Castiel paid them no mind as he looked to the heavens, desperate for an answer.
Chuck had a girl working for him, a literary assistant named Becky who helped bring Chuck around. “He hasn’t eaten today,” Becky explained apologetically, patting his cheek softly.
Castiel eyed his torso and smirked approvingly. “Very nice. Though I suppose I must give the credit to myself, since I’m the one who rebuilt you, atom by atom. I know
“This was fun,” Dean said as he dried a plate Cas had just handed him. “Dunno why we don’t do more family dinners like that.”
Saturday morning came and Castiel absolutely refused to count brushstrokes. He did, however, decide to forgo the usual blue tie, just to shake things up. Instead, he wore a
For the next half they lay there on the couch, chatting and making out, till the timer on Dean’s phone went off. Then they had homemade lasagna and it was delicious. And after that, Dean dragged Cas upstairs to his cozy loft, pressing him up against the wall and kissing him breathless again.
”They don’t have to be,” Dean said. “I know I’m not exactly known for handling emotions well, but this is not going to ruin our friendship. We been through way too much together to let some sitcom shenanigans come between us.” Dean lightly punched Cas’s shoulder. “One day, I promise you, we’ll look back on this and laugh at ourselves.”
He’d been completely sincere when he said it, but Dean looked at him in surprise, laughed softly, and said, “Well, at least my soulmate’s funny.”
As Castiel rolled the mop bucket back toward the hot chocolate station, he heard Michael and Naomi’s voices and hid around the corner. If his bosses were going to talk about him, he’d like to know
. Already knowing that you’re going to die is torture. Waiting for that hammer to fall and having the knowledge to prevent it and not being able to do anything about it...it would kill
“Oh, don’t be nice to me, Hannah,” Castiel sighed, pulling his hand out of the Dalmatian. “Why don’t you all just say what you’re thinking about me? I’m an
a month or so ago. Actually...it was on the anniversary of their deaths,” the author said morosely. “I don’t know how you came to life but you were just a character that I thought up for my book. I did give you the name of my unborn son, to try and honor the person he would’ve grown up to be...but I’m
Dean cried out as Castiel’s fingers started massaging over his prostate mercilessly. “OhfuckohfuckohCassssss-”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Castiel sighed. “Something about my watch...‘little did Castiel know, that act of rebellion something, something-’”
“No one, oh, I need your cock in me, baby,” Dean whined, arousal quickly building and building inside him.
“Chuck, I...can’t speak for those other instances, but as for me, I...if I have to die...it’s how I’d want to go. It’s...a good ending. It’s okay. I’ve accepted it.” Cas gently pushed the papers toward Chuck. “You have to finish it.”
Castiel didn’t normally swear, but if construction equipment unexpectedly destroying your dwelling didn’t call for it, he didn’t know what did.
Castiel stood in front of the building for the College of Arts and Media on the campus of University of Kansas Lebanon. He took a deep breath and pushed inside.
“If you’ll excuse me for another sec, I gotta go see a man about a dog,” said Dean, getting up and poking his brother playfully as he left.
Gabriel nodded. “I always knew this day would come. You’ll need some things for the trip. Food, money, clothing to keep you warm. Here.” Gabriel pulled a bundle of beige clothing out of the closet and handed it to Castiel. “It’s called a trenchcoat. Humans wear them, apparently. It’s well insulated, I made it myself.”
Castiel slapped his flank without even blinking. “You’ll take what you’re given, Dean. You’re lucky I’m feeling so generous as to give you a second orgasm.”
“Oh. Okay.” Castiel clutched his briefcase, practically feeling the other man’s annoyance pushing at him. “I’ve...I’ve messed this up...haven’t I. You were just...trying to be nice to me and give me another chance and I...I messed it up, like I always do.”
“You are so fucking sexy when you’re fighting for me, babe,” Dean said, pulling Cas into another passionate kiss.
“And you, mister, should probably take a shower,” Dean said, pointing at Cas. “Unless you wanna grace all that crap in your hair away.”
“Yeah,” Dean murmured, drifting off to sleep in his angel’s arms. “Husbands. Love you so much, Cas.”
Castiel wanted to melt into the floor. He’d never understood that particular expression before, but at this very moment he felt it very apt indeed.
Sam sniffed Dean’s shoulder. “Hold on a sec...you smell...lemony. And spicy. Like...thyme! That’s what you said the potion smelled like, right?” Sam sniffed Dean again, harder.
After briefly tonguing the tip, Dean slowly, painstakingly, took Cas down into his mouth, inch by inch. The wet heat of his mouth was almost too much to handle. Castiel was reduced to a whimpering mess beneath Dean, the mechanic’s strong, sure hands holding Cas’s hips down when they tried to buck upward into that heavenly heat.
Castiel gazed into those greener than green eyes that he normally didn’t have permission to study so in depth. “You’re so open like this. So...at peace,” he said wonderingly.
Contacting the man who had abandoned him as a baby—he’d left for a reason, right? And what would he say if Chuck picked up? “Hello, I’m the son you gave up after your wife died in childbirth, and also I’m the main character of the novel you’re writing; could you please not kill me off?”
Cas took his hands and graciously kissed his knuckles. “Your body is beautiful,” he said, knowing Dean well enough to know what he was thinking even without angel mojo as a cheat sheet. “I am quite honored to wear it, if only for one day. You have a handsome face, strong arms, gorgeous muscular legs, and yes, even your stomach is admirable.”
“Dean,” Cas whined as the mechanic continued to palm the front of his jeans, just the pressure alone driving him crazy. “Oh...
“Yeah,” Cas whispered miserably under his breath as Dean left. He rubbed his hand, remembering that phantom feeling of wearing a wedding ring. “Me either.”
Dean cackled with laughter, the sound ringing in Cas’s ears sweeter than any music he’d ever heard. “You’re such a little dork. Come on, baby, we got about 35 minutes ‘fore that timer goes off. We can at least have a
But ever since then he’d been wondering, what it could be, what his “true happiness”, what his heart’s desire could even look like.
It took roughly 12 hours to finally reach the station in Lebanon, so it was early afternoon by the time he reached Dean’s address. Sure enough, parked on the street in front of the modest yet charming red brick house was a life size version of Castiel’s toy Chevy Impala. Castiel grinned, cheeks flushed with excitement. He was finally here!
Winchester had apparently ditched his soiled shirt in the other room and had come in clutching a clean tee shirt in hand. Castiel stared, flabbergasted, at the man’s sizable biceps. He was in fantastic shape, but not so much so that he looked like he tried hard at it. His strong-looking arms were covered in tattoos, which Castiel had never found particularly attractive before, but on Winchester they simply added to his appeal. Castiel imagined them wrapping around his waist as the perfect man before him smirked at him and whispered huskily in his ear-
“Maybe it’s an enchanted forest,” said Cas dreamily. “With talking deer and birds who help Nathan on his way through the woods.”
Cas frowned, dropping his shoulders in surrender. “You’ve come to make good on our deal, now that I have everything I want. Fair enough. But please, allow me to say goodbye to my family before you take me forever.”
“Of course you didn’t,” Dean chuckled tearfully. “How could you?...so tell me something, Cas.” And oh, there was
Suddenly there was a buzz from Dean’s pocket between them. “Oh Jesus, Sam! I totally forgot about everything else!” Dean gasped, grabbing his phone. He touched the screen and brought it to his ear. “Sam, Billie’s been taken care of. We-...
Dean pressed his lips against Cas’s desperately, cupping his jaw. Cas laughed faintly into the kiss, just so glad to be
“He made hot chocolate especially for you. He only makes me tea and stuff when I’m sick or stressed out from work. He just met you and he’s already taking care of you. I know he seems prickly but that’s just Dean. He’ll warm up to you.”
“That’s a damn lie!” Charlie declared. “You said you named your main character after your son on the morning show!”
After Dean had recovered, he reached into his nightstand and pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom. He pressed them into Castiel’s hand. “Want you in my ass,” Dean ordered. “Don’t worry, I cleaned myself up while you were out.”
She lead him over to the acoustic section. Castiel looked at the different colors and designs. “Which one should I go with?” he asked.
Once he came to, Castiel ran right home, close to tears. He burst right through the door of his and Gabriel’s igloo and exclaimed,
worthless. Look, I know I wanted to hate you, but I just couldn’t, because you were so sweet and awkward and adorable. I
Around three in the afternoon, Castiel was wrapping up with the paperwork. He was putting things in his briefcase when he heard a polite rap on the door. Dean was lingering in the doorway, looking in. “Everything five by five in here?” he asked.
Cas’s cock was hard enough to pound nails at this point and the gentle friction of Dean’s stomach muscles rubbing against him was nearly enough. “Dean, touch me, please,” Cas begged.
Dean whimpered slightly as Castiel removed his thumb. Suddenly the angel crawled onto the bed, hovering over his body. Dean’s breath hitched. He felt a hand slip underneath his back and slide down... “Hey!” he yelped. “Watch the merchandise!”
Dean’s shoulders untensed at the warm, rough, familiar voice in his head. “I’m okay, Cas. Just...wiggin’.”
”I looked up the garage and called the number when I was in the bathroom,” Charlie admitted, biting her lip in a cutesy way, as if she thought it would get her out of trouble.
“But...my wife’s health wasn’t very good. She’d always been sort of sickly, frail. The doctors warned us that bringing a baby to term could be deadly but we wanted to try...we should’ve listened.”
“I’m sor-I mean...I’ll just go in there then.” Blushing even more profusely now, Castiel awkwardly stepped into the bathroom.
Castiel blinked, tilting his head to the side slightly. “No, Gabriel, when I’m grown up, I’m going to be a guardian angel and watch over the human families.”
Castiel swallowed. “Number one: treat every day like Christmas. Number two: everyone deserves to be saved. And number three...” He faltered, trying to remember.
Castiel spun around in the desk chair and glared up at her. “When I was two years old, my father, Chuck Shurley, ran off on me. I never knew what happened to him. But I think I just found him.”
“You know, the Obi-Wan to your Luke Skywalker, the Morpheus to your Neo, the Princess Celestia to your Twilight Sparkle.”
“If you change your mind, you can tell me. Whatever it happened between you and Cas. Whatever Billie did. You can tell me, Dean.”
Dean glanced up and saw Cas standing beside her. She uncertainly pulled out the chair beside Dean and sat down. Dean carefully refilled their glasses and slid one into Cas’s waiting hand.
He tips his head back, relishing the burning warmth spreading from his stomach to the tips of his fingers and toes. His body is buzzing when he looks up at the sky. There aren’t as many stars here as he’d like. Most of the sky is obscured by the treetops, but he can catch a few small glimpses of the moon, a handful of stars, and the endlessly black night sky.
Dean forced his face to crack open into a smile and said, “That’s great, Sammy. Look at you, living that happily ever after like some damn fairy tale.”
Dean didn’t have an answer for that and settled for a scowl though that quickly faded leaving Dean feeling blank.
Because there it was. That cold truth Dean couldn’t let himself look at. The reason why that panic was crawling through him. The reason why he prayed to Jack, why he asked Jack if they could remove Cas’s grace.
Steve laughs, deeper than the situation calls for. But it’s a warm laugh, and Dean finds himself smiling faintly.
He gives himself a moment, breathing in the musty air of this house, to break. He feels a knife in his gut as he thinks about Sam and Cas, together. He feels it twist as he thinks of Sam and Ruby. Twist again as he thinks of what he did. It carves him out and leaves nothing behind. There is nothing left of him after this. And there is nothing he can do to fix things.
He could feel the calluses on Cas’s fingertips brushing against his knuckles. With one thumb, Dean found himself gently brushing against the side of Cas’s hand. He didn’t want to look at Cas’s face. Seeing the peace there, the ease that smoothed Cas’s sleeping features, made him look close happy.
Sam’s phone rang suddenly, jolting him out of his sleep. He pulled it close to his face as he felt Eileen wake slightly from her spot tucked against his side.
This should be nice, right? He should be able to relax and unwind. He should want to go hustle the pool-playing college kids. Maybe pick up a hot biker chick.
He wasn’t sure how long he might have sat like that if Miracle hadn’t found him. The shaggy dog simply bounded up to him. Dean didn’t see where he came from but knew this was Jack’s doing, too. His forced his heavy hand into Miracle’s fur, and before he knew it, his face was buried in Miracle’s neck. He didn’t cry, just forced himself to breath into Miracle's warmth.
Just wanted to give you guys an update and say – Surprise, this is gonna be a little longer than I planned! Also, thank to everyone reading, it makes me really happy to see people checking this out 😊
He follows Steve to the bed, losing layers as they go. Somehow, Dean finds himself laying flat on his back with Steve on his lap. Dean reaches up, pulls Steve in for a kiss and runs his fingers through Steve’s hair.
Sensing he might be pulling away, falling away from Sam and back to that moment, Sam prompted, “What do you mean?”
She didn’t speak again, and Dean had no words left in her. So, she simply returned to her whiskey. She finished her glass quickly and as she went to refill it, found Cas placing her own empty glass in front of her.
So now, Dean found himself standing on the side of the road, punching and kicking the shit out of an old tree.
Dean walks slowly over to the couch and picks up the demon blade. He sees Ruby carefully watching him in his periphery but keeps his attention on the blade.
She didn’t know how much time passed. Enough that the tears finally slowed, then stopped. Enough that the warm buzz in her veins had started to fade. Enough that she refilled her glass but didn’t drink much as she kept her head buried in her arms.
Dean sighed, and noticed the slight tremble working its way through his arms. He could see the way his hands shook around Cas’s, but he wouldn’t let go.
With a slight nod, Sam closes his laptop and turns fully toward Dean, “I know that you don’t, didn’t get it. I mean I know what it looked like, what I looked like with her. You think I’m a monster. I’m turning into the kind of thing we are supposed to hunt.”
Dean thinks he can hear Sam’s bitchface and accompanying shoulder roll, the one that means he’s truly annoyed but attempting to be the bigger person.
Eventually, Sam let herself peak at Cas above the top of her book. She noticed the way Cas’ eyes clung to the page, unmoving, and resisted the urge to restart the conversation from the kitchen.
“I think he is concerned for you,” Cas falls quiet for a moment and Dean almost forgets they were talking. That is, until Cas turns toward Dean, pinning him under his gaze and says, “As am I.”
“Yeah.” Dean said simply. He could feel Jack studying him out of the corner of his eye and wondered exactly how much Jack knew. How much could Jack feel right now?
The kiss tastes like blood, but that’s nothing new. When he leans back and opens his eyes, he sees where he smeared tacky blood across Ruby’s cheek. She takes notice, wipes a hand across her cheek, smearing more blood than she gets off.
He wishes it was different. He wishes Cas didn’t matter so much to him. He wishes he didn’t see blue eyes every time someone had their hands on him. He wishes he had the courage to tell Sam how much he needs Cas. And he wishes he didn’t need Cas at all so that Sam could have this. His brother needs this, needs Cas. So, how can Dean be so selfish to need him too. How can Dean take that away from Sam?
Second time around, Dean manages to actually get out of the car after he parks outside their motel room door. The hangover headache has mostly faded, replaced by a different kind of headache. Memories are pressing down on him, images of his first kiss, of Steve body, of wild black hair, of vibrant blue eyes.
“What? No. I mean, nothing happened. Jack appeared and then he sent me here. Dean, what’s going on?”
Dean feels his face shift into a scowl. He never should have spoken to her, that was his first mistake. When he entered the house last night, he should have simply quietly crept up behind her and slit her throat. Quick, efficient, and most importantly, quiet.
Cas’s hand presses firmly, forcing Dean to lower the bottle. He doesn’t remove his hand though, warmth soaking into Dean’s wrist. Dean realizes that he’s very cold at the moment. He also realizes he desperately doesn’t want Cas to let go.
Jack promised to do things differently, hands off, and left the three of them standing in the street. Cas was the first to walk away.
He wouldn’t let himself think about Cas’s choice or Cas’s confession or the words Dean had said after. Though still, as seemed to be his way anymore, Dean’s mind didn’t wander far from thoughts of Cas. Instead, as the tears blurred the red and purple of his bruised and bloody hands, Dean though about how he doesn’t remember the moment he started to love Cas.
“Huh?” Dean withdraws his hand, glancing back at his brother. For just a second, he catches Sam’s eye, and maybe there’s that hint of a mischievous glint. Though, it vanishes too fast to be sure.
They seemed to have a mind of their own. So, Dean leaned forward, folded her arms across the table, and buried her face in her elbow. Letting the soft flannel soak up the rest of her tears, Dean continued to not think.
Instead of looking at his face, Dean brought is attention back to their hands as he said, “Of course, I need you Cas. Of course, I do. I wouldn’t… I don’t…”
“Yes, it is. I’m just… adjusting. So, is Cas. Hell, if anything it’ll probably be easier for us to get back to normal without you and Eileen practically banging in the kitchen every morning.”
? Why would he… where would he even think of that? Dean and Cas. It’s crazy. And what’s the point in bringing it up now, as they’re trapped in a car together heading halfway across the country to tackle their next hunt. Why is he-
“Dean?” her voice sounded rougher than usual. Dean wondered if that was a symptom of Cas’s attempt at sleeping.
Also also, Dean and Cas are ultimately the end game here. They've just got some stuff to figure out while getting there.
Ruby rises, snatching her top from Dean’s hands and passing him his flannel. She dresses as she says, “Well, it’s pretty obvious you came here to kill me. At least at first,” she winks at him, there her expression turns somber as she says, “I don’t
Well, there may be one thing he can do. If it doesn’t fix things, it may at least make him feel better.
Dean stands in the lukewarm spray of water in their cheap motel room and tries to breath. He feels the potential for another fight with Sam brewing like a storm. He tries to breathe.
He did remember the moment he realized it, the moment it struck him to his core that Cas is important, integral to his being, and had been for a long time. Despite everything they had gone through together, he only started to understand it in Purgatory. And even then, it had only been because of Benny.
All at once, Dean pulled back, releasing Cas and taking a stumbling step backwards. Cas wanted to sit, to let himself slid down the wall Dean had thrown him up against and fall to the ground. He wanted to stay there until the echoes of Dean’s words stopped dealing such painful blows, until the bruises faded, until he could shed this hollow feeling.
, he signed to her. Still half asleep, she simply waved at him and rolled over, unconscious again before her head met the pillow.
Wordlessly, she slid it part of the way down the table toward Cas. It landed a few seats down from Dean. Cas glanced at the glass then back at Dean. Despite the fact that her hair was back in its usual ponytail, it looked slightly askew.
The floating is definitely a factor to keep him distracted, too. Now that they’re weightless, Dean and Cas swim around the cabin in more comfortable, casual attire, monitoring every aspect of their flight and keeping in constant communication with mission control.
Still, it’s only a little unfair to see Cas alert and already ready for the day at 06:10 when Dean almost crashes into a wall on his way through Tranquility for his morning piss.
” he ends up calling out, rushing to the door to get the attention of anyone who would know what to do and have what Cas will need. “Gabe?
Every second crawls by, dripping like molasses, and by the time Dean reaches the airlock, waiting for the airlock to pressurize, his arms are shaking and his vision is starting to get blurry.
Dean finds himself alone that night, sitting at Cas’s bedside with nothing better to do, so he retrieves the watch that had been lying heavy in his pocket all day.
Blushing, Dean stares down at the hand he’s holding and gives it another kiss. “In comparison, there’s not much of it left,” Dean murmurs, because damn him, he can’t accept the way things are for
“Of course I have,” Dean tries to make up an excuse. “There’s only six of us up here, and he was my copilot, on top of that.”
Back at the camp, he moves to remove Impala’s saddle immediately, taking pity on the stress she surely endured during the stampede. Scratching at her neck, behind her ears, and down her forehead, he lets her shove her face against his chest while he hums to her, soft and comforting. He feels her sigh before she shakes herself, nosing at the slick grasses at their feet. Dean takes that as his cue to leave.
Dean’s still far off from the camp when the first real crack of thunder cuts through the air, barely introduced by a sharp flash of light that illuminate the entire desert for merely a second. It takes him another few seconds to realize that what he’s hearing is not residual thunder but the thundering of hooves upon the ground.
look and he’s actually quite fit, but he’s such a socially awkward person — hell, I could hardly interact with him before the launch.”
When the stranger tore his gaze away, looking back toward Crowley, Castiel let himself stare into his drink again, studying how the golden liquid pulled up and rolled back down the glass like a tide as he swirled it ‘round and ‘round. Before the whiskey could reach too high and spill over his glass, Castiel brought the rim to his lips and downed the rest of his drink.
The bed was cool when Castiel awoke the next morning, the ceiling unfamiliar. When he sat up in bed and looked around, sunlight too bright and head dully throbbing, he found himself to be the only thing left in that room.
a storm in 1872 so bad that it destroyed part of the San Miguel chapel: if you look hard enough, you'll be able to find out what the chapel looked like before the storm, and then there are photographs of both the damage that had been done and how it was later rebuilt. I have also seen photographs of the St. Frances church being built down San Francisco street from the plaza as well as of the Exchange Hotel.
Dean finds out—later, when he bumps into him again—that Cas apparently has a history with Crowley. Meg, too, since Cas tells him that she’s always pushing his buttons out of mere amusement to rile him up.
Every once in a while, he’ll catch Cas doing the same, too. Usually it’s around the campfire, when Dean is telling some story and gesticulating wildly, his food half-forgotten on his lap. As he surveys his audience, sometimes he’ll glance to the side, just to see if Cas is listening, and find the person in question staring back intently, the interest in his expression aglow with the flickering light casting shadows across his face. Dean will sometimes be caught in his gaze, unable to tear himself away from the brilliant blue eyes that dedicate all of their attention to him.
The stranger seemed to know exactly where he was headed, not hesitating once in his step. When Castiel was sure he saw the stranger enter the saloon, he lingered back for a while, steadying his breath.
Within the next week, Dean will have to start Benny’s experiment and hatch the goldfish eggs. His stomach drops at the reminder that Benny isn’t with him, sleeping in the pod across from him and helping him unpack the ship, but… when he thinks of Cas,
What was Dean thinking, allowing himself to be so vulnerable and open with Castiel? There was no way he would propose such a thing if he knew Castiel was the town Sheriff…
you see my wings like that?” Cas asks with a raised eyebrow, and after realizing he had mentioned his wings, his jaw clenches.
dense, either: Castiel was aware of the acts involved with intimacy, even if he was unfamiliar with their routine.
It’s difficult to leave. This post was meant to be a temporary, throw-them-off-his-scent kind of job, but despite the group moving sluggishly down the in-progress Santa Fe railway, he grew familiar with the people here, he got attached. It’s difficult to keep his back turned as he tightens his saddle bags on Impala’s saddle, double-checking his coat pockets for his ballast, the pocket watch, and the Colt. It’s one thing leaving them, but it’s another knowing he’s leaving evil incarnate within their midst.
With an hour long break to eat, the entire crew generally hangs out in Unity. Sometimes they’ll bring in extra work or a book, but generally speaking, they chat and catch up on what has or hasn’t been done around the station.
Dean’s not really going to protest. “Thanks, Padre.” He turns away to continue watching the repairmen not doing a very diligent job at being productive.
with Crowley, he doesn’t see much of the Russian side, and since Cas is technically stationed over there during the day and is a bit of a workaholic (Dean admittedly has his moments, but not quite as extreme as his copilot), Dean finds him constantly hoping to see Cas wherever he goes. If he doesn’t seem busy, Dean will try to convince him to watch a movie with him and the other Americans, and if he’s already eating, then Dean will sit beside him and ask him about his meal. Dean’s entrance always seems to startle Cas out of thought, but he never shows any irritation — in fact, when he denies Dean’s request for a movie in favour of wrapping up some work, he sounds genuinely apologetic.
So, he walked. He gave himself hours to watch the people resuming their lives as if they hadn’t ceased existing for days. As if Chuck hadn’t almost destroyed everything. He wondered slightly what Jack had done with heaven. He didn't let himself try to check.
Instead, he forced himself to stand. He watched as Dean took a second uneasy step backwards and followed Dean’s gaze to the place on the wall where the Empty had been just a moment ago. When Dean looked back at Cas, his eyes looked dulled.
“You don’t know anything, Sam,” Cas said quietly. It should have hurt, it should have sounded like a stab, like an attack. Instead, it just sounded sad and true.
If he was honest with himself, there was fear too. A part of him that couldn’t help but wonder how this could change the way Dean saw him. Fondness fought that fear. Fondness for Dean, an affection that he felt confident Dean shared, on some level at least. And hope that despite the secrets Cas found himself finally admitting, Dean might be able to look back on his memories of Cas with that same fondness.
Though what he felt the most, the strongest of all from the moment he decided to speak, was, of course, happiness. Finally. A feeling purer and deeper than anything he’d ever felt, better than if he had his wings back. It was something he’d often tried to imagine and now, finally letting himself feel it, he knew he never could have pictured this. The freedom in loving, in saying it.
The problem was simple. Sam had asked the question Dean avoided asking for years. Because it’s a dangerous question, one that won’t lead to an answer. It’s a question that will open the door to more, it’ll open the floodgates. Everything Dean had been dealing with – by not dealing with it – would have to come to the surface before she’d be able to answer anything.
The previous shots and beers are making themselves known through the burn in his gut. Dean doesn’t know when his shoulders started to loosen, but he dimly notices that he’s turned in his chair to fully face Steve, now. Steve’s done the same, and when he glances down, their knees are nearly touching.
Cas didn’t know what to say to that, just felt himself drawn to look at Dean. He found Dean’s eyes had fallen to the table, moving rapidly as if he was searching for something. An old ache clawed at his chest as he took in that look. He’d seen it often, Dean searching for an answer, for a way to save someone.
Cas had planned to simply sit in his room and think once Sam left him alone. But the longer he sat the more his urge to move grew. He needed to get out and felt the old desire to simply vanish and reappear somewhere else burning inside. Something he couldn’t do anymore. Something he might never be able to do again.
Dean scrubbed a hand down his face. He noticed his hands shaking and forced himself to grip the wheel tighter to hide it.
She had followed Cas to the library, originally just to make sure she doesn’t leave again. Cas seemed to notice what Sam was doing and made a point of sitting at one of the long tables. She produced a small book from the pocket of her trench coat and ignored Sam’s lingering until Sam settled herself in one of the nearby armchairs and did the same.
Dean had fallen silent and, after hours of hiking through the grey woods in the quiet, Benny struck up a new conversation and never asked it again. Dean had spent those miles mulling over that simple question. And once he’d started looking at it, at what he was doing and what it had been doing for years, the realization struck.
Every time Benny brought it up, Dean shut it down with the simple fact that he wouldn’t leave Purgatory without Cas.
Dean took a shudder of a breath and continued, “I said- I had to say… Sammy. He- it. The Empty, it only wanted him when he was happy. So, I couldn’t… I said the worst things I could think of, Sam. Everything he’d… I knew he was afraid of,” Dean’s voice broke and in one horrifying moment Sam realized his brother was crying, “I told him I didn’t need him. That he only matters to me when he’s useful. I told him,” he let out a ragged breath, “I told him I didn’t love him.”
The problem of it is simple, either Dean meant what he said, or he didn’t. Either Dean’s initial non-reaction to Cas’s
They drank again in silence. But it was a loud silence, a pressing silence. Dean was acutely aware of Cas’s knee, the way it was so slightly brushing against Dean’s thigh. She couldn’t stop watching Cas’s hands, was mesmerized the way the careful way she lifted the glass. When Cas pursed her lips to take a sip, Dean looked away.
She wiped the tears away harshly. Part of her wanted to look at Cas. She finished off her whiskey, wincing faintly at the burn, and set the glass down hard.
As he waited for Cas to continue, he drank in Cas’s warmth greedily. Looking back into his eyes again after all this time, he suddenly felt like he had been starved.
But once he noticed his shaking hands, he quickly became away of his shaking body. From head to toe he felt like his muscles were out of his control. He’d meant to sit on his bed, but somehow found himself on the floor instead. His back was pressed against the bed frame, head resting on his knees, and he shook.
“Everything’s ok, Cas,” Jack said simply. He pulled out of Cas’s arms and sat back at the table looking at Cas, “I just got enough things in order that I felt like I could finally come and catch up with you guys.”
Dean could feel Cas’s gaze on her but suddenly couldn’t seem to look up from the warm amber of the whiskey. She nodded slightly, hoping Cas would take that as encouragement to go on.
The bar Dean ends up at is nothing remarkable. It’s a simple roadside staple in a one-horse town. Drunks, truck drivers, and a few bikers are scattered around sitting at wobbly tables in the dimly lit room. A few college-aged kids crowd the single pool table in the back.
Dean doesn’t even know where this is coming from (though honestly, he probably doesn’t want to know). He knows Sam’s been off lately, really since Dean forced –
“I’ve got it,” Jack said. In a blink three cups of coffee and three plates plied high with eggs, bacon, and toast were on the table in front of him.
He wanted to shake his head, to ask Cas not to say whatever horrible thing was sure to come. But instead, Dean felt Cas’s hand fall onto his knee.
When the message ends, he clicks through their text chain one final time. Sam gave Ruby the address of their next case, apparently before he decided to start hooking up with Cas and yet after they had
But with her hand tightly grasping her glass, she said, “Of course, I forgive you.” Cas has made her way back to the pillar. She didn’t turn around, but she did stop.
He thinks he wants to talk to someone. He thinks he needs a drink. He turns Baby’s engine back on and drives.
But left alone together, Cas had simply started cleaning. She began washing the dishes in the sink until Sam joined her, drying each one and placing them home in the cabinets. It didn’t take as long as usual. Without Mom and Jack, there were less dishes to clean now. Still, Cas found herself standing at the sink, scrubbing at the bits of dried pasta and red stains of sauce until those were gone too.
His fear of thunder had been irrational. After all, the thunder can’t cause damage, not like lightning. Being afraid of thunder is like being afraid of the sound of a gunshot when you should be afraid of the bullet.
Dean almost felt like it was the old days, at least, until a few days ago, when he came back from a coffee run to find his brother and his angel in a state of half undress in their shared motel room.
They never talked about it, but John never forgot about it either. When he went to bars with Dean, John watched him like a hawk. But he didn’t need to. Dean learned his lesson. Or rather, he repressed it. He repressed the memory of that kiss. He repressed any feelings he may have had.
“But he wouldn’t want you to leave. And even if he did, this is as much your home as it’s mine and his.”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said the words like an exhale, finally releasing a breath he’d been holding for weeks. Though he knew, as he looked at how vulnerable and peaceful Cas looked in that bed, as he looked at the perfect way Cas’s hand fit into his, he knew that he’d been holding that in for much much longer.
“I’m gonna hit the shower,” Dean says. He finishes off his coffee and shuts the bathroom door before Sam has a chance to speak.
Sam was resistant at first, as Cas expected. But this was easier than asking Dean, and Sam came around eventually anyway.
It’s dark, late into the night, when Dean pulls over for the last time. He finds himself in wooded park after hours. He takes a bottle of Jack that was hidden under Baby’s front bench with him into the woods. He doesn’t follow the trail for long. Instead, he takes a long drink from the bottle and wanders off the path.
Steve’s hair is damp from a recent shower and combed into a neat little coif. He turns to Dean, holding two cups of coffee, and Dean can’t help but notice that his eyes are dark brown.
Jack smiled again, “I am sorry it took me so long to tell you. I had to make sure the Empty understood. That it wouldn’t try to come for you again. But we agreed that only angels and demons belong to them, so as long as Cas isn’t one, he’ll be safe.”
He could feel Sam gathering his thoughts and suddenly had the urge to simply leave. To refuse to talk about this at all. Instead, he tried to listen.
“But this. When it comes to me and my mistakes. Sam, I still think she’s angry with me for purgatory, and for the leviathans before that. I don’t deny that I’ve done terrible things. I know now I should have told you both about my fears with Jack. But I also know that I did what I thought was right. I’ve always done what I think is right. But she only sees my mistakes as failures.”
“What do you mean ‘shouldn’t’?” Dean finally spoke. He dragged his gaze away to find Jack’s eyes. His similarity to Cas was so obvious it was painful to look at. But Dean refused to look away.
“I’ve never rented somewhere before. And I don’t exactly have a ‘credit history’,” he said with air quotes.
“It’s not Dean,” Cas said carefully. He noticed Sam look at him but kept his sight on the plate. Cas put it back on the shelf and took the next wet plate from Sam. He carefully shifted the issue and said, “My grace is failing.”
“Ok. I just. I can tell this thing with Cas and me is hard for you. And Dean… If you need it to stop, just say the word.”
Cas could hear the Impala peel out of the garage with a rumble that seemed the shake the whole bunker. It wouldn’t sound so loud once he completely lost his grace.
Sam offered a short smile and a nod. Cas gave her another long look before returning to staring at a page in her book.
“Whatever. Point is, Sam, I’m good. Cas is good. Miracle’s good. We’re all good and we’ll be good when you’re off living the dream with Eileen.”
Cas suddenly noticed that he’d shifted close enough to Dean that their thighs touched. Ignoring the tremble running through Dean’s leg, Cas simply watched Jack.
Cas was standing inside the archives now. He didn’t remember doing that, climbing inside, but it didn’t matter. The moment he realized where he was, he lurched backward, uneasily reaching for the sharp edges of the door. As he pulled himself through the opening, he felt pain shoot through his hand.
This fear, though, there’s nothing irrational about it. Cas could leave. He might leave, and never know or be able to know the truth.
“Dean,” Sam tried to start delicately, but Dean was already rolling her eyes, “Can you just try to-“
He can’t look into his eyes. So, Dean’s gaze skims over Cas’s face. In his mind, Dean pictures wild black hair lit up through a dim window. He thinks of rough hands and a deep voice. He’s drowning in blue eyes.
“Lately what, Sam? You lied to me about demon blood and Ruby and started fucking my,” Dean catches the word
“You talked to him, didn’t you? Jack,” Cas said as he looked slowly toward Sam, “Of course you did. That’s why you came.”
He washes off the filth while Ruby talks. He lets her push his buttons. He grinds his teeth when she asks, “So, how has Sammy been? Still fucking his angel?”
Cas smiled weakly at that. With a slightly nod, Sam clapped Cas on the shoulder, and finally left him alone.
“She won’t go near him. Besides, she knows something. She’s connected to the major players in this whole ‘end-of-the-world’ scheme.”
From this angle, she could only see a small sliver of Cas’s bed and Cas’s feet, crossed at the ankles. And that answered her question. And she’d meant to, really wanted to, turn back around, hit the kitchen, maybe even snag that bottle of whiskey she’d stashed in the library, and finally vanish into her room until these feelings were numb enough to ignore.
Sam could sense the weight behind the words. He pictured the shattered door, the books and papers scattered around the room. The drops of blood dotting the floor.
Jack didn’t touch him, didn’t wave a hand, didn’t even blink. Yet one moment Sam was standing in front of Jack in the library of the bunker, and the next he was sitting beside a frantic Dean flying down a highway in the Impala.
Cas is standing too close, and Dean kisses him. Hands around the back of Cas’s neck, Dean closes the distance, pulls them together, and kisses him.
They never speak. Like always, Dean walks into whatever hovel she’s currently holed up in. Heart still racing from the hunt, adrenaline coursing through him, Dean and Ruby find each other. She throws him against the wall, and he feels the weight of the demon blade in his pocket every second she touches his skin.
It was nice, having at least one reason to pull himself out of bed in the morning, when he’d rather hide and continue avoiding Sam. Avoiding Cas. He was grateful to have this one reason and tried to believe he deserved it.
And so what if somewhere inside he feels heartbroken that he was right, that Sam was lying, that Sam was so far gone he couldn’t see anything wrong with his addiction. So what if Dean feels like something between them is broken and can’t ever be repaired. So what if leaving Cas to watch over Sam, knowing that they’re together, makes him feel like something vile is curling through his lungs.
Sam knew Dean likely wanted to rush back to the bunker in silence. Hell, he was probably mentally praying to/cursing at Jack for trapping him with Sam. Sam was sure Dean was expecting him to prepare some kind of speech. But Sam didn’t have that in him. He just had something simple he needed his brother to know, something Jack probably wanted Dean to know, too. And at least now he’d be forced to hear it.
He stopped in his tracks, standing somewhere before a quiet corn filled. A crow called somewhere overhead. Cas clutched his chest for a moment.
Sam found Eileen as soon as he could, because of course he did. Their reunion was sweet, tearful even, as he filled her in on what she had missed.
“Vanished is a strong word, Dean. Especially considering you knew she left. You could have stopped her, and you didn’t.” And there it is, that anger, bubbling up again.
Dean sucks in a deep breath. He did not mean to say that. And he can tell that Sam knows he did not mean to say that.
“It’ll take him some time to heal. He should up soon, though. And as of now, the Empty shouldn’t come for him,” Jack was saying.
There’s that clench in his chest again. He takes a deep breath, trying to banish it, and furrows his brow to hopefully disguise his discomfort as annoyance.
Dean blinked. Cas’s hand untangled from Dean’s and settled against Dean’s cheek. His thumb stroked gently against Dean’s cheek bone, but he hardly noticed.
“I think, to Dean, I’m always going to be her little sister. Someone she has to protect. Even when we were kids and I would steal her brush or get nail polish on her bed, she’d never really stay mad at me for long. She’d stay pissed off, sure. But she was always able to forgive me. I just think… I think when it come to you, you’re different.”
“Cas, I love you,” he said softly. In answer, Cas pulled Dean in by the hand on his hip, his other hand moving from Dean’s shoulder to the back of his neck, and kissed him.
Dean shakes his head slightly. He doesn’t turn but looks up to meet Cas’s eyes in the slightly fogged over mirror, “No I didn’t.”
Sam took a deep breath and forced herself to take a seat on the corner of Dean’s bed. After a beat, Dean took a seat too.
Cas had no answer to that. They simply sat together in silence for some time, before Sam unfolded his long limbs and stood up. He placed his hand on Cas’s shoulder again as he said, “Whatever you decide, don’t do it for me, or Jack, or even Dean. If you choose to become human, do it so you can have a chance at happiness.
“Dean,” Cas’s voice sounded rough, and suddenly Dean didn’t want to be here at all. He wanted to be far far away. He wanted to grab Baby and drive until he didn’t recognize the roads anymore.
He should have kept walking. Maybe left the bunker entirely and tried to breath the fresh Kansas air. But against his better judgement, Cas let his mind wander back to the archives. Those emotions grabbed ahold of him, crushing his lungs, breaking his spine, pulling him apart the way they did the first time he experienced them.
“Dean, you always do what you think is best, even if that means lying to me, to Cas, to anyone you care about. As long as you think it’s the right thing, you’ll do it.”
She wouldn’t let her mind wander. Shoved Sam’s question down and buried it under each sip of the whiskey. Instead of thinking, Dean kicked her feet up on the table, stared at a random point in the distance, and savored each time the whiskey burned its way down her throat and into her stomach.
Without fully realizing he’d done it, Cas found himself opening his bedroom door and wandering the labyrinthine hallways of the bunker.
Uncomfortable. Dean is uncomfortable with his brother and his… his angel?... friend?... Cas banging in a motel room they share. That’s all this is. And why shouldn’t he be uncomfortable with this? This is an uncomfortable situation. It’s not his fault that they seem incapable of putting a sock on the door to give a guy a little warning.
Cas seemed ridged suddenly. She carefully placed the sponge down and dried her hands on a nearby towel.
He felt sick, felt that panic felt finally ready to choke him, and found that he couldn’t call Sam. He couldn’t listen to his brother’s calm and understanding, empathetic voice. What Dean told him last night, what Dean had so nearly confessed – may as well have since Sam clearly knows now – Dean couldn’t face it. He couldn’t face Sam’s kind words that Dean so clearly didn’t deserve.
Sorry it's been a little while, but I hope you're enjoy this so far! Next chapter will be the end and will be up eventually :)
Dean’s quiet again so Sam said, “Man, nothing’s going to be different between us. I’m barely twenty minutes from the bunker, and Cas’ll only be fifteen away. We’re still going to hunt together and we can-“
“But then it kept coming. ‘N Cas was just going to let it ‘n I remembered the deal so, I- I grabbed him and I… said the worst lie I could think of.” Dean fell silent again.
Jack sat back in his seat; eyebrows drawn together in a way that made he look young and vulnerable. Cas had the sudden urge to hold his son, to tell him to forget about all this, to protect him from the pain of his new power and position.
He’s to say, and he’s definitely not homophobic, though being raised by John certainly did him no favors in that regard.
There were only a few days between the day Sam moved and the day Cas planned to. Apparently, Eileen’s landlord had been struggling to find someone else to rent the place and was thrilled to have a new tenant ready to move in so soon.
After some time, Dean slowly started to come out of it. Leaning over his seat, he found where his phone had landed in the back. His hands still shook and ached, they were still covered in blood and the deep purple of growing bruises as he forced himself to check his messages.
It was only late into the night, when Dean had finally quieted down, having presumably disappeared into one of the many rooms in the bunker, that Cas left his room. He slipped into the kitchen, grabbed a box of cereal, and ate it dry as he sat on the floor of his room.
Cas sat in the kitchen, desperately clinging to his grace, faced with a terrible choice. A test of faith as twisted as the kind his father was often known for. To give up everything that he is for the possibility of happiness, or to return home and never have the chance.
He didn’t know where he was driving and didn’t know where he might have ended up has his ringing phone not forced him out of his thoughts. His breath hitched in his throat for a moment as he thought it might be Cas.
Cas would spend eternity thinking he was nothing to Dean. And Dean – Dean didn’t know what he would do.
It could have been moments or days since his conversation with Jack and Dean. Since Dean left. And he might have sat there for days more if his phone hadn’t rung, forcing him to pull away from his grace and circling thoughts, just a bit, just enough.
When Dean entered the crumbling house, he thought he’d kill her. His was itching for the fight, burning to feel his fists crash through something. His blood was humming with adrenaline, excited that he’d finally get to release this – all the pent up
to die, Dean. And I could be helpful. I mean, if you want to, ya know, stop Lucifer from rising, it might be nice to have someone on the inside.”
“Before we stopped Chuck. When you and Cas when to confront Billie, you never told me what happened.”
Looking him dead in the eye, she licks the blood off her hand. Dean thinks of the demon knife still tucked in the inner pocket of his jacket. But when Ruby reaches forward and drags him into another bloody kiss, he lets her.
Something about the hangover headache, sunlight, and memories of the previous night leave him feeling off balance.
Dean pushed roughly away from the table and stood. She didn’t know what carried her forward, just knew that suddenly Cas was in front of her.
He kills a demon, he fucks Ruby, he meets Sam and Cas at whatever shitty motel he left them in and pretends he doesn’t notice the distance growing between them. Just as he pretends he doesn’t notice Cas’s incorrectly buttoned shirt and Sam’s afternoon bedhead.
Sam sighed slightly, “Not exactly. I just. I figured he might be in a rough place. I knew you would be, too, though.”
Sam stayed awake long into the night. He held Eileen tight, breathed in her warmth, and prayed to Jack.
Of course, he’d quickly grown past that fear after she’d died. After he’d been trained to fire guns whose explosive shots could put thunder to shame. However, he still remembered that fear, the kind of fear he that stole his breath.
And that was it. Dean grabbed Cas by the hips, anchored herself to them, pressed her against the pillar, and kissed her.
There was an ache in her chest. It must have been there all along, but now it felt like it was devouring her whole. She took in a shudder of a breath, planted her feet back down on the floor, and tried to will the tears to stop, to go away.
Dean doesn’t look, though he notices Cas shift out of the corner of his eye. Cas leans closer and something primal in Dean urges him to fight or flee. Dean’s hands lock onto the steering wheel as Cas says, “You are a soldier in the war. Nothing more. Remember that.”
Dean lets go of his tight grip on the bathroom door handle and steps closer to Sam, “Fine, come on, man. What’s the strategy? You wanna go in there and go all Sith Lord on them?”
Charlie put him through answering a line of banal and confusing questions. “Do you own any old weapons or artifacts of great importance? Or been left a mysterious box by a deceased relative?” she asked.
Cas rested his head against Dean’s shoulder, eyes closed and smiling widely. This was perfect. Absolutely, totally perfect.
of your body, Dean Winchester. Every little secret, every weak point, every place to touch that will drive you
Cas and Dean abruptly pulled apart to see a familiar figure in a suit standing there several yards away staring at them impatiently.
Sam yelled at them from across the room, engaged in a tussle with another vamp. “We’re in the middle of something here!”
“Sure. I can get everything together by then, I’ll set you up in my office.” The mechanic put out his hand to shake. “Truce?”
James Novak was indeed the spitting image of Castiel, from his square jaw to his stubby fingers to his crystal blue eyes. The tax accountant tended to wear his hair a bit shorter and more neatly combed than the often disheveled Castiel, but other than that, you could never tell them apart just by looking at them.
you’re the hero. You’re ticking all the classic Hero Archetype boxes: you’re the one confronting the conflict, you’re the one the narrator is paying attention to, and you sought out me, which clearly makes me the Mentor of the story.”
John Wayne Gacy...yes. The name was familiar. He was the star of many of those pasta westerns Dean was always making him watch.
Castiel needed to hurry if he wanted to get to work on time. In a panic, Castiel checked his watch and saw that he was indeed one minute and 14 seconds behind schedule. Castiel quickly rinsed his mouth out and hurried to his closet, neglecting to comb down his hair as he usually did directly after brushing his teeth.
“But if this is a comedy, you’re totally safe. And you’ll probably end up with your love interest. You mentioned a hot guy earlier?”
Castiel slid into his bed and opened the book, taking in the story eagerly. About halfway through, though, his eyes fell shut and he nodded off with the book face down on his chest.
Without the sound of his diligent brushstrokes to distract him, it suddenly struck him just how hauntingly silent his Spartan little dwelling was.
Cas opened his eyes, and Dean could see him doing the mental calculations. He really was cute when he was thinking. Finally, Cas slowly turned his head back toward him. “Dean?” he whispered, as if unable to believe it was true.
“The only reason you got him back in the first place is because I let him go,” the Empty said flippantly. “And I doubt he’ll be able to wake up and annoy me again now that your little Antichrist has lost all his angelic powers.”
“Oh, I know. But I have to figure out how much you owe. It determines the size of the cell we put you in.”
Cas set it on the counter and picked up a heavy cast iron skillet. He tearfully raised it over his head, and-
“I’ll take the compliment regardless.” Cas suddenly kissed him on the cheek before opening the door to the communal bathroom. “My offer still stands on the shower,” he said with a sly grin before disappearing inside.
Jack made it sound like it was the most exciting thing to happen since...whatever kids got excited about these days. Fortnite, maybe? Dean didn’t know.
, my mistake,” Dean said, rolling his eyes, pretending to be annoyed. Suddenly, Castiel’s stomach rumbled loudly. “Damn, when’s the last time you ate something?” Dean asked.
“No potion,” Sam reported. “Guess we’re gonna have to figure this out through process of elimination.”
Maybe that was for the best. It was going to be hard to be around Cas, feeling how he felt about the angel, having heard those three little words he’d been dying to hear since forever, knowing exactly how Cas’s lips felt against his...
“Here.” Joshua pulled something from his desk and handed it to Castiel—a small plastic block with buttons and dials on all sides. “It’s a fidget cube. Keep it, I have several.” Joshua leaned toward Castiel and whispered conspiratorially, “My nephew’s on the spectrum, so...I understand.” He smiled patronizingly.
can’t look bad in front of Santa. Which is why I don’t need some wingless idiot dragging down our productivity!”
Castiel carefully picked up the guitar and sat beside him, and played around with the tuners for a few minutes, and eventually got it in playing condition. “There, good to go.”
“Wait a second, what am I doing? I’m hearing voices and I’m taking their advice on how to style my hair?” Castiel said to himself incredulously. He got dressed and tied his blue tie as fast as he could, then sped out of the house with his briefcase in hand and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich clutched between his teeth.
.” Chuck handed Charlie a manilla envelope. “However...I thought you might like to read the new ending. Show it to Cas and Dean, too.”
He pitifully turned to leave, but looked back over his shoulder. “Dean?...I think I’m in a tragedy.”
Another thing everyone gets wrong: Santa is an old fat guy with a white beard. Santa can come in any size, shape, color, age, or even gender. See, Santa’s kind of like a title. It gets passed down from person to person. At the time, this Santa was a beautiful lady with dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin, and a commanding voice that gets everyone’s attention when it’s raised. This Santa may not have been the holly jolly type, but she cared, deeply, that Christmas went exactly right, that every child got the toys they deserved on Christmas. And a rogue human baby at the North Pole was
“Because I’m dying and I can’t just die on him and leave him to mourn for me! I can’t stand the thought of hurting him.”
“It’s sort of a hobby I’ve recently picked up,” Castiel admitted. “I always wanted to learn to play, so I finally decided to just...do it.”
The Empty laughed. “Oh, you pitiful fool. You thought I came to take you with me? I said I would only do that when you felt a moment of real,
“Uriel just doesn’t want you to get trampled on by accident. The reindeer are very nice, but they are temperamental animals. Maybe someday when you’re old enough to get your assignment, they’ll assign you to work with the reindeer.”
“Come ‘ere.” Dean pulled Cas against him and wrapped his arms around him, Cas’s head on his chest. Dean kissed the top of his head. “Just relax.”
Dean Winchester was the most beautiful human being Castiel had ever laid eyes on. Before him stood a man with gorgeously chiseled features, shortly cropped dark blonde hair that was slightly mussed from being hard at work, and those green eyes. How was it even possible for a real life human being to
Being inside Dean was too good. He was so tight, so hot inside. “Give it to me, hard,” Dean grunted.
, Dean thought to himself with an inward chuckle. His questing fingers strayed along the angel’s jaw, into Cas’s dark hair...
But he still had to be sure. “Tell me you meant it,” Cas said softly, gazing into his eyes. “Tell me you love me.”
Cas couldn’t bring himself to be upset, however. If he had to die...it was a good death. It was the way he would choose to go, if he had had a say.
Dean crossed his arms over his chest in a self-hug, gently rubbing his own arm, trying to project the sensation of holding the angel in his arms to Cas. “Miss touchin’ you,” he murmured. “Wish I’d done it more when you had a body. Wish I’d pulled my head outta my ass an’ just kissed you like I wanted to, so many times. Now I’ll never get to.”
mania was big when Sandover commissioned that one. I, uh...I based the main character on Benny,” he admitted.
“Love making you come apart for me, sweetheart,” said Dean huskily, kissing and nibbling Cas’s neck. “Definitely gonna make you come again after dinner, maybe twice if you got it in you. So pretty when you’re beggin’ for it. So gorgeous, just for me.”
Suddenly, he felt warmth spread within him, starting in his stomach and growing outward till his toes and fingertips tingled with it.
“Sure,” Dean said, and Cas could’ve sworn he blushed. “I mean, you know, if you want to. You don’t have to. It’s just dumb kid stuff.”
“This could be something, Castiel,” said Charlie, again getting up to pace. “What was your first encounter with him like?”
Cas squeezed his hands together, settled on the table in front of him. “Sam? If the pearl...had worked. And you’d been the one to wish on it...what do you think you would have wished for?”
Dean watched hungrily as Castiel peeled away the shirt to reveal a fairly well toned chest. He then kicked off his shoes and socks, undid his belt, and let his pants and underwear drop to the floor.
Suddenly Dean found himself on his knees on the mattress, face down and hands still tied to the headboard. More angel mojo. Great. “Still haven’t learned your lesson, hmm?” tsked Castiel. “I told you you’d realize who was in charge here before we left this room. I tried positive reinforcement, but perhaps you’ll respond better to punishment.”
“Whatever,” Winchester grumbled, pulling the hem of his shirt down, hiding that beautiful abdomen from Castiel’s view. Castiel felt a longing whimper form a lump in his throat. “Did you want something or did you just come to gawk?”
Cas looked down to see it was untied. “Oh, thanks.” He propped his foot on the bench to tie his shoe. Dean stood on the edge of the curb, hands in his back pockets, idly whistling a Def Leppard song.
Castiel growled in frustration, throwing his toothbrush aside and rinsing the foam out of his mouth. In a fit of madness, he rushed into the bedroom and yanked open his closet. “Castiel began ripping his shirts and suits from their hangars and tossing them all over the room haphazardly for no reason! Castiel threw his shoes at the wall!” Backing away from his wardrobe, he stumbled back onto his bed and put his hands on his face. “Castiel screamed,” he groaned into his hands. “Or he would have, if he wasn’t worried about his neighbors calling the police.”
Dean climbed onto the bed and hovered over him. “Meant what I said. Wanna look into these eyes while I fuck you.”
“I know, I know!” Chuck said, turn to pace anxiously. “It’s just...” He bit his lip, then looked at his agent. “I already told Becky the ending. I’m afraid it might be too late.”
The mechanic gasped, jerking around to see who was there, then exhaled when he spied Castiel standing there. “Mr. Novak...you ditched the trenchcoat, I see.”
“I want you too...you have no idea how much,” Cas whispered, starting to push inside. “Oh...Dean...”
when you’ve experienced your happiest moment. And you’re pretty damn happy in Green Eyes’s arms over there.”
the perfect temperature. Hot enough to warm you up right down to your bones, but not so hot that you’ll burn your tongue off trying to drink it. Castiel had just poured himself a mug of this perfect hot chocolate and sprinkled a handful of multi-colored mini marshmallows on top. He was so focused on the marshmallows that he didn’t notice his boss, Michael, and Naomi coming around the corner.
Doing nothing was more complicated than it sounded. Castiel woke up on his couch after having slept there the night before, not wanting to risk endangering himself walking from the bedroom to the living room. He had food stockpiled next to him on the coffee table so he wouldn’t have to go to the kitchen and surround himself with hazards like knives or toasters. He turned on the television which was preset to the golfing channel (the most innocuous channel he could think of) and didn’t so much as touch the remote after that, even to change the volume. When his phone rang, he didn’t dare pick it up. The one caveat he allowed himself was going to the bathroom, because to Castiel, death was a better fate than resorting to relieving himself into empty peanut butter jars.
Dean realized how heavy his eyelids were, how worn out he felt after his fantastic orgasm. “I’m just about there, Cas,” he mumbled. “This is...good. Really...good.”
“That’s what I thought. I’m all for it when my taxes go to shit that will actually help the community, like better roads and schools, and hopefully someday universal healthcare. I did the math and figured that 73% of what the government was asking me for was more than fair, and that’s what I paid. Until shit changes, you and the rest of your government goons can take the rest of what I owe and shove it up your ass.”
“Aren’t you a little tall to be an elf?” Dean laughed, sitting down across from Castiel and propping his hands behind his head.
When Castiel finally arrived back at his cubicle, worn out and sullen, he found a Post-It note stuck to the screen of his computer monitor.
In the weeks that Cas had been living in Dean’s head, they hadn’t broached the topic of...could this even be called sex? Mutual masturbation? Voyeurism? Angelic phone sex?
He rang the doorbell and shifted nervously. After a few minutes, a man in grey robes opened the door. “Can I help you?” he asked brusquely.
“Through every scrape, every tussle, it was I who kept you from harm. You didn’t see me, but I was there, every step of the way. You would’ve died years ago had I not shielded you. You’ve always been mine, Dean. And deep down, you know it.”
Cas took a deep breath and tried to be patient as Dean massaged his hole with oily fingers, then pushed one inside him. Cas liked to finger himself, of course, but since it had been so long since he’d been penetrated by anyone, he knew he was going to be tight.
Cas set his jaw solemnly. “We’ll fix this too, Dean. The four of us can accomplish anything together.”
“Yes, my Righteous Man, come for me. I’m about to come too, can you feel it? Touch me, make me come with you.”
There was suddenly a tremendous clatter as Castiel tripped and fell backward over a large red toolbox. Winchester rushed over to help him up, wincing.
“Cas, the glass!” Dean yelped, whipping off his flannel so that he was in just his t-shirt and very carefully brushed the glass away. Strangely enough, the goo seemed to be seeping into Cas’s skin and disappearing. A little voice in the back of Dean’s head worried that would have consequences since they had no idea what was even in that bottle, but mostly Dean was concerned with keeping Cas from cutting himself. “You okay?” he said.
“No. I just wanted to see you. And apologize...again. For being a...well, for want of a better word, an assbutt.”
Cas averted his gaze again and closed his eyes. “Then I assume you’ve jumped to the obvious conclusion.”
The twenty or so bored looking students sitting in the house groaned in relief and gathered their belongings.
“I guess this means they won’t be having the sex then?” Jack asked, making Dean groan and bury his face in his hands.
Castiel felt his heart skip a beat and his entire body heated up—and it had nothing to do with his trenchcoat. He’d never known a sensation like this before. He’d never gazed into a face so beautiful as this man’s. Despite the hard, annoyed set of his jaw and eyebrows, his intense green eyes seemed to shine with a light that all that outward anger couldn’t dim. Looking into them was like getting hit in the face with a snowball; they left him out of breath.
But there’d been plenty of other instances of his anger over the years. Hitting things, breaking things, lashing out with words and fists. Sometimes Dean felt like it was the only thing he was actually good at.
“I think that’s why I couldn’t let Ruby or the power go, you know? Because if I’m already ruined, at least I can use it for some good. But then, this thing started between me and Cas. And don’t get me wrong. I’m not in love with him and I don’t think he’s in love with me. But being with him… It’s like, if an angel wants to be with me, in any sense of the word, then I can’t be that unclean, can I?
“Hm. It was wise of you not to bring, Sam. I fear he might not be up to task of killing demons just yet.”
If you made it this far, thank you so so much for reading! This was a lot of fun to write and I hope you enjoyed it too :)
“What’s your angle here?” Dean says gruffly, pulling his pants back on and scoping out his t-shirt and boots, carelessly tossed around the room.
Steve becomes enthusiastic once he starts talking about his nephew. He smiles through tales of babysitting the little terror and laughs through the story of their first and only solo zoo excursion. In the back of his mind, Dean is surprised to find himself laughing along. Nearly as surprised as he is when he starts cracking jokes, just to hear Steve’s laugh again.
“Why would I mind, Sam? I don’t care that you’re into guys, or angels who are guys, or anything else.”
She tipped her head back, shut her eyes, and let the oaky flavor settle across her tongue. Felt the warmth starting in her stomach and spreading outward in a soft buzz, down to her fingertips.
Cas hadn’t heard back by the time Sam was ready to move. On Sam’s last night living in the bunker, he and Eileen cooked a big dinner and even dragged Dean and Cas in for a meal all together. When Sam pointed out that this was their first meal together in ages, Dean and Cas stared pointedly at their plates.
That feeling lingers for the drive back to the motel. He sits in the parking lot for some time, before pulling away again to pick up some coffee.
By some miracle, Sam fell silent for the entire ride home. But that didn’t really matter because those few words he had said cut deep. How had happiness become such a central theme in his life? Ten years ago, happiness had never crossed his mind.
Cas’s hands are left dangling by his sides. Though in an instant, one hand is clutching Dean’s flannel in a tight fist at their hips.
“I could remove your grace, Cas, but it would likely be painful and uncomfortable.” Jack spared another glance a Dean, looking almost regretful as he said, “What do you want me to do, Cas?”
When Cas returned to the bunker late at night, he slipped through the door as quietly as he could, which wasn’t that quietly at all. The door groaned open and slammed shut. He thought of when Jack used to greet him when he returned. He thought of Sam and Dean.
Sam was in the library when Jack appeared to him. He feared he knew which way Cas was leaning, and figured it was best to get a head start on his research. He intended to keep his promise to Cas, to try and find a way to get him out of this deal with the empty if he chose to regain his angelic status. But if Jack was here, then it likely meant Cas had made a decision.
Dean nodded once, then pushed his plate away and continued, “Thing is, Jack, I’ve been praying to you nonstop.”
“Text me about the next seal,” he calls as the door bangs shut behind him. Through the clatter, he can still hear Ruby laugh.
When Dean was young, very young, he used to have a fear of thunder. He could always vaguely remember his mom’s hands holding him to her chest during a storm. He could also remember the way each clap of thunder made his heart leap to his throat. It was something he couldn’t swallow around, could hardly breath around. He couldn’t even cry past that lump, past his fear.
Feeling his own face redden, Dean simply turned on his heel and slammed the door shut again. Though for some reason, the sight of Cas’s tie laying abandoned on the bed was stuck in his mind for the next several days. Nearly as long as the sight of Cas’s shirtless-
Jack stepped around Dean and Sam, coming to a pause beside Cas’s bed, “I did what he asked. I removed his grace.”
Dean was choking on his fear when Cas finally, slowly turned to look at him. Scrubbing a hand over his face, Dean bought himself a moment to collect himself. Though when he looked back into Cas’s blue eyes, he could hear the thunderclap.
But thoughts of Sam leaving, thoughts of Cas and of Cas leaving, began to mingle with thoughts of his dad, and sometime after he finished tossing pots and pans back into their cabinets with more force than was required, his picked up a bottle.
On the ride back to the bunker, a ride that Dean tried very hard not to think of as their last, Sam finally asked it.
The gaping hole where the door once stood may have seemed like a black hole had Cas not had such close experiences with the Empty and it’s endless nothing. However, looking into the jagged opening and ruined room inside, Cas felt a something in his chest that reminded him of the Empty anyway.
“Just trying to figure out what your problem is,” she says is factually. Pulling her hair free of her bra straps, she steps closer to Dean.
“Cas,” Sam grabbed his arm and looked at him seriously, “Listen, man. I know things are weird between you and Dean right now- “
He’d tightened his grip on the demon blade, and he’d entered with a clear head, or as clear as Dean Winchester’s head could ever get. He entered with the clear
“Oh yeah. My bad. Yeah, sorry Cas. I’m totally in the wrong here. You only lied to us at every chance you’ve had over the last 12 years and got my mom killed-“
Cas falls into a thoughtful silence for a moment before he says, “You still haven’t told me what happened to Ruby.”
“No, no, no. ‘S not like that, Sam. I’m good. You’re happy ‘n that’s all I wanted for you. I’d die if I knew you’d be happy, you know that, right?”
Dean jerked the wheel when he noticed Sam in the passenger seat, though he didn’t slow from the breakneck speed at which they were travelling.
Making his way as silently as his could, avoiding the kitchen, where he could faintly hear someone cooking, he made his way to the room that was sometimes his. He laid down on the bed and slept.
Until they peel themselves apart, skin tacky with blood and sweat and cum. Ruby talks, and Dean tries to clean himself off. Though lately, there’s been something vile inside him, something that no amount of scrubbing, fucking, or fighting has been able to wash away.
Dean’s leg started to shake, forcing him to ease up on the gas. Dean didn’t say it, but he didn’t have to. They both knew that if Cas left, it would kill him. But not getting to say goodbye, that would hurt just as bad.
“Dean, come on,” Sam says, rising from his seat at the table, “I’ve been clean for months, now. I can handle a few demon hunts.”
Dean sat with her back against the headboard, arms crossed against her chest and a half-empty beer clutched tightly in one first. Her short hair was pulled back in a loose bun, strands of hair fell along her neck where they were too short to reach the bun. Her flannel lay somewhere near her feet leaving in her just a black t-shirt, jeans, and boots.
It was the kind of fear he felt as he sat alone in that kitchen with Cas and his fading grace. The fear welled up inside him as Cas watched the spot where Jack had vanished. He let himself watch Cas for just a moment, while the fear threatened to pull him under.
Recognizing the same fear, Cas sat up and drew Dean in. Arms wrapping around his back while Dean’s hands remained clenched against Cas’s chest, they were still, both just waiting and waiting.
the world ends. Because of him. Because he wasn’t strong enough in hell when he broke the first seal and he’s not strong enough now to save the others.
“So, what’s new Jack?” Dean asked, carefully. Cas recognized that forced causal tone of voice better than Jack possibly could.
Then he’s gone. Dean is alone in the bathroom. His hands drop from where they were twisted in Cas’s hair, and they shake. His whole body shakes.
“I can’t keep doing this with her, Sam. She’s… she’s my best friend, but when she hates me…” Cas didn’t finish. But she didn’t have to. Sam knew.
“When she looks at me, she only sees the ways I’ve failed. The ways we’ve lost. I don’t- Sam, I can’t be that anymore. She doesn’t want me here.”
With a deep breath, Cas let himself ask the question that had been building since Sam first called, “Did Dean tell you everything that happened?”
It was another long few moments before Dean haltingly started the story, stopping intermittently to take deeper and deeper drinks. The story starts the way Sam remembered, with Dean and Cas going to Billie’s library. With Billie, sick and dying, threatening to kill them. With Dean and Cas, running for their lives back to the bunker. Billie crushing Dean’s heart. Cas saving him, but trapping them in the archives.
Sam took a moment to watch Cas. The sleeves of her trench coat were still rolled up. The dark bags under her eyes were only exaggerated by the red and glassy look in her eyes. Strands of her dark hair slipped out of her ponytail and fell around her face. Sam realized slightly she’d never seen Cas’s hair look like that. Maybe something about her grace failing, something about becoming more human made her look more human as well.
Cas sat alone at the kitchen table, the cups of coffee and plates of food summoned by Jack cooling before him. His hand had found its way to his chest and as he reached and reached for his dwindling grace, his finger clutched into the fabric of his shirt. They twisted into it, pulled at the neckline as he made a tight fist pressed to his chest.
It took him some time to work up the courage to sit beside Cas. He started by standing, but as the events of the last several weeks started to weigh on him, Dean sunk down to sit on the edge of Cas’s bed.
Upon hearing Sam shuffling around the kitchen, Cas took a sharp turn. When he heard Sam heading toward the bathroom, Cas took another quick turn. He felt vaguely guilty about trying so hard to avoid his friend. But it was dulled by the fact that he had nothing left to say to him. And Sam would, of course, want him to talk.
The tight panic clenching his chest bled into his limbs. He hit the steering wheel once, but that panic, this pain that isn’t pain kept building anyway.
Dean felt hollow, and as he looked at that message, thinking of the conversation he would soon have to have with Sam, the only thing solid thought he could form was that he can’t fix this.
She catches his eye, and seeming to read his mind, smiles, “It’s cute how often you plan to kill me, Dean.”
“But that was weeks ago now, Dean. And we won. Hell, we won for real this time. There’s not another apocalypse waiting to spring. Rowena is keeping all the demons in hell, Jack has all the angels back in heaven. Even the ghosts and monsters seem to be calming down. It’s just us and our lives now but you- “
Dean thinks he should pull his hand away. He knows he should, and yet it’s so easy for him to release the bottle, slip his hand through Cas’s grasp, and wind their fingers together. He’s holding Cas’s hand and he can’t look away.
“There’s nothing, Sam. I’ve faced this issue before. My grace has been… it’s been through a lot. I knew it likely wouldn’t last me forever, not after everything,” He looked at Sam, “I’ll be ok. I just wanted you to know.”
But it feels good. It feels good killing demons again. It feels good to believe, even only on a surface level, that they are gaining ground again. It feels good sleeping with Ruby. It feels good getting time away from Sam, from Cas.
