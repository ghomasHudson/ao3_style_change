Lavender. Something about the
With a nod, they watched as Dan hauled himself, with assistance, to a standing position and walked the final few meters to where John sat. The wheelchair was quickly brought up behind him and he sat back down.
"You're not --"
For a brief moment, he looks around, lays eyes on the faces waiting, expectantly. Many are familiar.
(See the end of the chapter for
The words penetrate the haze he's been floating in, not exactly asleep. He snuffles, sit up, blinks a few times. "Yes, and it's John," he amends.
"Yes. It's like ... I can feel him. Feel them." Her eyes are wet, just a little, as she watches John’s mostly grown grandchildren amble along the rock wall that leads back from the cottage, the frog and the chipmunk scurry away to delighted laughter as the sunlight shifts in dappled patterns through the lower tree branches.
John felt the little bit of awkwardness, the catch hitting him mid-chest. "I think you can manage."
"That happens. It'll lighten up."
John answered, "Yes, I've got the leg."
"... I just don't know how you can possibly have known that, I don't even talk to my girlfriend about that time of my life ..."
I can't wait to put this season behind all of us. Thanks for following and reading what is actually a really tragic recitation of true and based-on-true events. Hugs. The support of everyone who read and commented (and virtually showed such amazing compassion) has been so uplifting.
John considers doing as requested, briefly, but chooses instead to perch lightly on the edge of the chair in the corner of the room. He sees and senses that Rob is back, another nurse, change of shift, and they do a bedside hand-off, the same neuro assessment that's been performed.
"Out of the question." John holds the plastic gadget and raises a brow. "Flat. With that IV catheter," and John touches lightly Sherlock's leg, "here at the top of your leg, it feeds that medicine directly into the blood clots in your lungs, you have to be absolutely as still as possible, give it time to work."
"No, that's all right." Sameer's words were kind as he smiled up at her, and even from her vantage point next to him, she could see that he was approaching excited about the idea. “Lamb is good.” There was still a worried look about him, and he added, "If you're sure that's all right. And tomorrow, I can ask papa to give you money?"
My facility is now "requesting" that each person eat lunch completely alone to minimise risk of virus transmission - sounds like AO3 browsing time to me. Although a meal break isn't happening too often anymore.
In the soft lighting, Sherlock's eyes were open, bright, watching his movements with a curiosity, an intensity.
The men exchanged a discreet eye-roll, knowing that none of them particularly needed the symbolism, but neither kid noticed. Sam finally turned back to John. "Gotcha day, I've never heard of it. Did you make this up?"
Sherlock is resting, sort of dozing, and John figures he is sort of paying attention but he doesn't ask any questions or otherwise draw attention to their newest concern. Of possible devastating new findings.
He wouldn't tolerate the turn, the activity. And it would actually be quite detrimental at this point. Sherlock has already depleted most of his oxygen reserve.
Congratulations on quitting.
idea."
John had actually gone to the front windows to check on a new ominous sound outside - groaning and low creaking - when forked lightning struck a giant tree visible just at the near bend of the driveway. The tree split clear in two, flaming and smoking where the singed wood had been electrified, and fell completely across the drive.
"I seem to recall almost nothing from that unit." Sherlock is frowning again. "But they sure remembered you."
"And coming back down later today."
Together they wrap Sherlock's left arm in the heated blanket and tuck it in. It is perfunctory and probably a token gesture, John knows, but it still feels like something. He considers this new development, arterial occlusion for some reason, and knows that this was indeed an ominous sign. Dr. Nguyen arrives, does her own basic assessment, and addresses Sherlock with all the questions John had wanted to ask but had held back, not to have asked Sherlock the same things twice.
Laila's mother opened the file. There were some type-written information pages, John's work, vocation, addresses, online presence, military service records. The photos have been deliberately arranged by the solicitor with the one sticking point at the very end. Included are a few zoom lens obtained candids of Sam walking, in the park, one taken at a restaurant seated between John and Rosie, laughing and happy.
Sighing just a little, John realised he was all right, and as he became cognisant of his own smile, his mobile buzzed again as a few more complaints trickled in.
seasoned enough to burn crisply. A snap of some of the residual green expressed its discontent and resistance to the heat but finally succumbed to heat and flame. A thin stream of smoke puffed out from the cut end of the logs, evaporation and heat and accelerated drying. Footsteps in the leaves galloped closer along with the sound of breathing, rapid and too quick for human approach, and before John could even react defensively, something green and slimy hit the open book he'd been reading, rolling down the spine into his lap. A path of viscous wet trailed down the page.
Checking a pulse, finding none.
Sherlock had whisked open the door and replaced the open doorway with a straight backed chair.
"Night."
Desperately.
"One of the admins is helping, soliciting and recruiting, scheduling the meal deliveries and such." Quickly, she explained that she'd considered a different role but that this seemed more suited to her, something she really wanted to tackle. Something that would lift their spirits, caring for caregivers. "So she's arranging much of it and we're making sure everything is divided up for all shifts, that it's as equitable and fair as we can manage." She cast a careful eye at the room, smiling. “There’s several weeks already taken, and more on the way.”
With great aplomb, Mrs. Hudson set the tin down, then raised her head with royal disdain - and a healthy teasing sparkle in her eyes and words. "Well, certainly not for you, directly, you insufferable tenant."
"Woo-hoo!" one of the nurses cat-called.
More ellipsis, blinking, blinking, blinking.
"It doesn't mean it's not either." Dean, the vascular surgeon, speaks quietly. "It might not, you're right. But if I were a wagering man ..."
"All right?" The low whisper barely carried in the room.
Not today.
His legs nearly buckle and would have failed to hold him upright if John hadn't a strong grip on him. Muscles, weak from underuse, tremble a bit as Sherlock finally does find his stance. His next words are quite whinging, "I'm so tired." There is less fight - which John finds a mixed blessing.
unnecessary, shrugged again and let her next breath be calming. Settling. "She called me, his wife did, a few hours later, to say thanks again. And how comforting it was, how much she appreciated ... that she knew I was his nurse, working that day." The smile on her face then would have been hard to qualify - sad, puzzled, incredulous - "I couldn't even barely answer, I was in tears ... myself ..."
As he approached the intake clerk at the triage desk, he scanned the room as a matter of habit and happened to notice a familiar face. He'd been part of a training class for his new position. The man - DI Greg Lestrade - smiled in acknowledgement and intercepted John before he got there.
"I know." John considered the rest of their schedule for the week, wondering about revoking privileges or adding chores as appropriate consequences for this rather slight offense. "So I think tomorrow, after your detention, you'll need to call your football coach and explain why you'll be missing practice on Thursday this week."
John works his way around some monitoring equipment in the hallway and passes a wheelchair before finding bay 8. It is empty but tells quite a story anyway.
Sherlock lifted his eyes quickly to John's.
"Good choice," he praised her, still very calmly and not overdoing it.
"It's a haematoma, bleeding on the inside from a puncture, the clot dislodges, a collection of blood. It happens often enough, I reckon." His back is already starting to ache, the bed too high for him to kneel and too low to be comfortable while bending down. "More common shortly after sheath removal, of course. But not unheard of afterward. Even this far out."
"No thanks."
Of course now I know that she is all right and that I'm breathing okay. Oxygen low nurse here have to stop for tonight.
"I did. I haven't been able to rest, not knowing where he was." She waited for the words to be translated. "I knew he goes by Sam. And that he plays football."
The hormone responsible for this process is auxin. Apparently Swiss scientists were able to either remove or deactivate it, causing the plants to simply grow straight up. There was no response to the location or strength of the light source for these desensitised plants. Without auxin, the plants have no affinity toward light.
Hands angrily crumpled up the paper and it was tossed in the garbage can outside the post office. Feet started pounding the pavement, and fake smiles were given to those walking by. All the while, murderous thoughts were building in the brain like a crescendo. Things were going to change around here, and it if had to result in people dying, so be it.
Sherlock's eyes and mouth parted in shock. "You're kidding! Why would
"Doctor, I'm Greg Lestrade, a DI for Scotland Yard and this is Sherlock Holmes. He consults for us on cases, and he always wears suits on the job. I tried to convince him to wear lighter weight clothing, but he refused."
"Well I can see why the girls think he's hot. But why is he so intrigued by short, gray-haired me?"
John was led to a large waiting room by an attractive brunette vampire named Anthea. The walls were painted blood red, a large comfortable gold chaise lounge cushioned in black sat against the wall. Two black oversized chairs were on the other side, a round table in between them with a brass lamp on top of the table. There was also a master bath, with a gold plated clawfoot tub underneath a bay window that gave off a view of the London skyline. There was a also a walk-in shower, a double vanity with basket of expensive lotions, soaps, and personal hygiene products sitting off to the side.
Janine frowned and pursed her lips. "I don't know, but for Molly and John's sake I hope not."
Sebastian pulled him so he was on his lap, and he wrapped his arms around him, planting soft kisses to his hair. "Damn him. Damn him for what he's done," Sebastian hissed.
Janine got off the bed and smoothed down her sundress. "I don't know about you, but I'm starving. Wanna go to The Big H and grab a burger? Mike's helping his dad mow lawns today so I won't be seeing him until tonight. We have a date at the movies. Why don't you and Greg join us?"
John raised the riding crop. "I'm going to start smacking you soldier. I don't want to hear a sound from you while I'm doing it, you understand?"
"You have to get off drugs Sherlock. It's not healthy. Being an addict can ruin a lot of lives, I should know."
"I'm sorry Victor, but I'm really not ready to move things in that direction so soon," John said.
"Sounds good to me. But for now, I just want to snuggle with you while you read me chapters from that book of yours."
His mother walked in, wearing a pink short-sleeved shirtdress. Her blond hair was up in a loose bun, and her blue eyes were tired. John knew she didn't get much sleep last night. Then again, neither did he.
Sherlock and John are about to retire after solving their last case. John blogs about it.
“Okay, now what were you saying about Zach Quinn?”
"I'll feel like a fox in the hen house, but yeah, why not. I want to see what Irene's parents look like," John replied with a grin.
Lucy shook her head. "No, but he's resting comfortably and I'm grateful for that. It's going to be difficult to tell him those two boys were murdered last night. I know they were bullies, and Harold had to suspend them, but they didn't deserve to die so brutally."
Henry just grinned coyly and took Sebastian's hand, leading him upstairs. Outside, a gentle rain began to fall.
John laughed and kissed Sherlock again. "How about you order us lunch, I'll finish up the fish, and then we relax with a nice warm bath in our soaking tub and then have a nap before dinner?"
"The things I do for family," John muttered as he headed to the bar.
"Better watch out Molls, Bruiser here will eat all of your burgers and fries if you keep your pretty little eyes off of 'im!" Phillip shouted.
Wanda Watson was both enraged and ashamed. She should have never let her son stay home alone, after hearing what happened earlier that night at The Big H. She felt so guilty. But she was also proud of John. For fighting Sherlock off and for being brave enough to tell Dave Morstan all that had happened since Saturday night.
Veronica saw the intense sincerity in her son's icy eyes. And she saw John was more than comfortable sitting next to him. "Okay dear. I'll be in the waiting room." She turned and opened up the door out into the hallway. John set his gaze on Sherlock. "How are you feeling?"
"Because a part of me is attracted to him. I can't help it. But I told him no, that I wouldn't go with him, because I knew everyone would be angry and upset with me. You and I are so close again, I didn't want us not talking again." He turned away and started to cry.
"Spare us the arrogant attitude," Molly barked. "The main conference room, now."
"Sherlock would have a field day in here with his deductions," John said, a big grin on his face.
The rain had stopped, but thunder and lightning still furiously tore through the heavens, promising more wet weather to come. Sherlock was sound asleep on the couch, wrapped up in John's blanket. The blond's scent on the soft material, combined with nature's stormy sounds, lulled him into a comfortable slumber. Wanda and John were sleeping peacefully in their beds. A few minutes later, the fire siren blared off in the distance, but it didn't wake them up.
"Yeah, yeah, it was funny only the first time," Marty huffed.
John put his fork down on his plate. “Sounds serious from the tone of your voice.”
"Do any of you know my daughter Irene? She's studying psychology. I know she's quite the handful."
Irene planted a smooch on Molly's lips. "No. Sherlock does what Sherlock wants---as well he does
"Mr. Wilkes, may I come in?" Dave asked.
"Hi Molly. I thought you were off today," Ella said, giving her a hug.
The home was a three bedroom cottage called The Boathouse, located in the coastal town of Spittal Creetown. It was an isolated property located on the Cree River Estuary, with plenty of outdoor space for raising bees. John loved the waterfront and was delighted to learn as homeowner he held the fishing rights on the estuary, so he could fish whenever he wanted. The town was close to the charming village of Newton Stewart which had all the amenities Sherlock and John needed. It took several months for them to fix it up how they liked but finally they could call it home.
Greg was also not in school. Molly explained he'd come down with a nasty stomach bug he caught from his dad, and was in bed resting. He was expected to return to class Wednesday.
"I'm sorry Sherlock. You don't have to tell me if it's going to be painful."
John shook his head. "I wanted to show how much I love and appreciate you, especially after solving the case last night. You risk your life to keep London safe, and you don't get enough credit for it. So I decided to surprise you with your favorite cake. And I also called in an order to Angelo for dinner to be delivered later. But right now, let's enjoy some of this delicious dessert."
John saw Sherlock's reaction, and sadness came across his face. He was going to be rejected again. "Yeah, I'm very rare. I have alpha DNA in my bloodstream. That's why my scent doesn't get a strong reaction to alphas. I'm not attractive enough. Alphas want an omega whose scent they like, and an omega who's more submissive. I guess that's what you want too."
"It wasn't the Wilkes boy," Chibnall said softly. The neighbor recognized the kid as Jeff Hope."
"Nothing like that, not yet anyway. But I'm working on a new project. It's about a day in the life of a heart surgeon and with you being a doctor, I'd thought you'd like to see my initial shots."
Sherlock nodded. "Well-rested. Thank you John."
Warren relaxed a little. "Yes. Please come in."
John blushed even harder. "You can't be serious."
"Well for your sake, I hope he is Discopath, or we've got a major lawsuit on our hands."
Sherlock shook his head. "I think it's time for me to head home. The suspect's been arrested, my job here is done." But he saw John's face fall. Was he really that disappointed that Sherlock wanted to leave? He had to find out.
Today's disappearance was different. Sherlock wasn't in London and as far as Mycroft knew, the only drug he was on now was nicotine. So where would he go? He had familiarized himself with Sherrinford while riding around town but deemed a lot of places boring like he always did. For once, Mycroft's brain was in a fog.
Greg slammed his book shut and glared at Irene. "Stop stirring shit up Irene. You're one to talk, after you cheated on me
Meanwhile, in Room 842, John, dressed in nothing but his camo pants, boots, dog tags, and an olive green baseball cap on his head, was doing his bullhorn trick on a the very hard penis of a very stimulated twenty-six year-old named Owen.  The short, sturdy brown-haired man was blindfolded, gagged, and trussed, all at his request.
"Okay, hold on. He looked at his mom. "It's Harry, and she wants to talk to you." He held the phone out towards her and she took it. "Hi sweetheart. How are you and Clarence?"
As you all know, Sherlock Holmes, The World's Only Consulting Detective, along with me, his trusty spouse, blogger, and conductor of light, are retiring after spending eleven years together solving crimes and digging deep in London's underbelly. Sherlock wanted our last case to be a good one to end on, and luckily for him, it was a dandy.
"Thanks so much Mrs. Doyle, I really appreciate it."
I know it's been a while! After a month of suffering a cough and respiratory infection, it's finally gone. And then I sold my house to a group of flippers that pay cash for homes! I have three weeks to pack up and relocate! So I'm looking for an apartment now. So it's been crazy. I'll update when I can. For now, enjoy this short chapter.
Sherlock's lips were on John's. It was a chaste kiss, but warm and tender. After they parted, Sherlock sighed happily and John beamed. "That was wonderful Sherlock."
Sherlock held his blogger tightly. "You're right. I never thought thinking about mundane routines would feel so good."
Sherlock smiled and pressed a kiss to John's silvery blond hair. "I love that you're home so much, and can come to crime scenes without worrying about being fired."
John nodded again. He didn't want to lose the sale. "Certainly. Would you like it gift wrapped?"
As another Friday night slowly came to an end, John and Molly went home, each wondering how their quiet little lives may not be so quiet anymore.
Doctor Watson hummed. "I see. And what happened to the cat burglar?"
"Was Gray in the military?" John wanted to know.
"Hey James. No, he's still at Gatiss General talking with Mr. Saxon. You got something?"
Sherlock blushed and kissed John. "And I wouldn't have my handsome, adrenaline seeking blogger beside me to keep me sane and safe."
The chemistry teacher's brain came back online. He took another drag of his cigarette before answering. "I don't know who that was but I'm going to find out."
"No I don't, it's just transport---"
A hint of sadness crossed John's face but then he smiled. "Well those days are over." He picked up Sherlock's hand and kissed it.
John just shakes his head and laughs. "Sherlock, you should be used to my expressions of exaggerations by now. And since it's London and storms like this are rare, everyone will think the snow
"Nine sound good?"
"We're sure. Please? It's our birthday tomorrow and having you talk to our brother would be one of the best presents ever," Eurus pleaded.
"That's Sherlock," Molly confirmed.
Sherlock snorted. "Did she tell you she made sexual advances to me even though she's sleeping with Billy Wiggins?"
Molly nodded. "I know, it's so unlike me, but what do you give a man for Christmas that pretty much has everything? Vic's parents are buying him a new laptop and tablet, and that's all he's asked for this year. So when Janine and Sarah and Sally told me they were going to do these photo shoots, I thought I'd do one too. But mine isn't going to be as risque as theirs."
Sherlock smirked. "I have no 'vampire power' as you put it. It's simple deduction."
“Mom, you know I will.” John smiled at her and reached for a hug. “I love you.”
John's dark eyes blew wide open. "Oh my God! What did you do?"
"So Warren, what would you like to start with?"
"John, you're supposed to be in bed resting," Sherlock gently admonished.
******
"Hey Johnny," Jim Moriarty greeted back with a sly grin. "So you got pics done yeah? I see Sherlock's in for a big surprise."
Sherlock looked at the clock on the wall above the fireplace. It was six twenty-eight. John would be home in two minutes. Warmth spread throughout his body at the anticipation of the night ahead with his gorgeous omega.
"I need to be honest with John Mummy. He has trust issues. He'll be hurt and angry that I didn't tell him about Sheridan." He looked sharply at Eurus, who for the first time in her short life, got scared. Her eyes widened.
Last Friday night, Greg called us and asked us to come to the home of Carter Beckwith and his wife Morgan. The couple, part of London's young elite, had hosted a party to celebrate her thirtieth birthday.
*****
He held Eurus tighter as he thought of the killer loose in town, hoping he'd be caught soon. His parents were terrified and he was tired of having to be in early, especially on weekend nights. He liked to have his fun just like everyone else.
Deep blue eyes widened in surprise, and then elation as he saw three very familiar people on the porch. "Molly! Greg! Victor! What are you doing here? Come in!" He moved so his friends could come inside.
Sherlock smiled and placed those perfect lips over John's right ear. He pressed a warm kiss to his lobe and whispered "then I'm going to make tonight last forever."
His insufferable older brother had gone on and on and on about a girl he met while walking in the neighborhood yesterday. The girl, Molly Hooper, sounded boring as watching paint dry, but because she played piano and didn’t look or act like a “harlot” (Mycroft’s word) he suddenly eschewed his motto of “caring is not an advantage” and advanced on her like a bee on honey. Naturally, she got scared off. Mycroft was not the most charming when it came to approaching girls in the rare times he actually talked to one.
John turned to him, startled. "You're not serious."
John finished his write-up. "Go ahead and take a look, I know you'll want to provide your constructive criticism." He grinned and handed Sherlock the laptop.
*****
Sherlock and John turn heads at the campus Halloween party.
"I have to. Otherwise, he'll get suspicious. Sebastian will really freak out. I'll be okay, I promise."
John finished his homework and put his books and papers into his bag. He walked into the office and set his bag down, and went into the parking lot. It was raining again, and there were no cars.
As John headed to the front door, a voice inside his head told him to call the police and not try and play hero.
"Goodnight mate," Greg told Sherlock.
Sherlock locked on him with icy hatred. “Does your wife know you seek male prostitutes on the weekends?” The man’s eyes bugged out and Sherlock smiled smugly. “If you don’t want her to find out, then leave me alone.” He slunk back to the bench, hands furiously rubbing his temple.
Mike whistled. "Wow. That sure went downhill fast. Less than three years."
was Sherlock’s reply.
A short, blond, man wearing a white lab coat with a nametag that read John Watson, PharmD, was behind the counter, holding a pill bottle and speaking to a customer. If anyone could help him, it would be this gentleman, who Sherlock silently thought was quite handsome. His hair was cut military style, and his stance screamed military too. He couldn't help but listen to him talk to the customer, and the pharmacist's friendly but firm tone all but solidified that he was former military, perhaps an Army Captain.
"I like you Mr. Watson, you're cool. Wanna hang out with my dad and me?," Brett asked.
suffer from that fake syndrome. I never did, not even when I became attracted to you.”
*****
Mycroft chuckled. "Just fine. I found some people to talk to who actually weren't that dreadful. The classes and teachers were extremely dull but I was expecting that."
"How was your first day among the commoners at Culverton?" Molly asked, trying to sound teasing.
we could have a nice warm bath and then I make love to you followed by a nap before dinner?"
John shook it. "Pleased to meet you."
"No, I want to know if it was Seb that got shot," Henry croaked, crying, holding desperately onto the cop.
John is 27, Sherlock is 24.
Five minutes after the KABC reporter and cameraman wrapped up their taping, they approached the front of the station, exchanging pleasantries with Billy and Kitty, the door to the building opened and the two cops appeared, walking to the waiting reporters. Billy turned on his portable tape machine, adjusted his microphone, ready to capture everything. Kitty had her pen and paper, and the other reporter and cameraman were also waiting.
He watched the three get into a sporty pale convertible. Harry was in the driver seat, this was her car. John sat in the passenger side, and Clarence hopped into the back, stretching out his long frame by putting both legs up on the seat. The car revved up and drove off, and Sherlock was sorely tempted to follow, but he didn't. He wanted to find John while he was alone and apologize.
By the time the two lovebirds retreated to the bedroom, the gentle shower had turned into crisp white snowflakes.
John looked in his direction and beamed when he saw the table set for dinner. "Wow, you already took care of things! Thanks love." He went to Sherlock and wrapped his arms around the lanky alpha, pressing a kiss to his nose. "You're such a thoughtful husband."
As she was hanging up the phone, the voice spoke again, cackling. "I'm far from a crank my dear. I'm what you oh so eloquently called in your little story today, The Sherrinford Slayer?"
John shook his head, chuckling. "That's your opinion and you know what they say about opinions, they're like arseholes, everyone has them."
"I'd love to," John answered.
"Honestly, I don't know how you can stand listening to that terrible music week after week," Sherlock complained.
"I heard you came down with that virus that's been going around. You feeling any better?"
"I'm going to spend most of our time here, well, when we're not having tons of sex," Sherlock replied matter-of-fact.
The last fic for the February Johnlock Prompt is here! It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be! After this, I'm going to take a break from prompts and finish my Love and Snow series so I can begin on a new anthology, Love and Spring. I'm enjoying writing these anthologies - I hope to do a Love and Summer and a Love and Autumn, to complete the whole package.
"Yes. There's an old man dead near the pond at Regent's Park. Lestrade suspects foul play."
Sherlock smirked. "Not psychic John. I simply observe." Then he frowned. "What do you mean I got most of that?"
Sherlock saw the text from John that he'd be pulling into the station in fifteen minutes. He was nervous, but he was sure things would turn out fine.
"Do you want to go back home Henry?" Dave asked, concern creeping into his face.
The old Belgrave mansion was a popular place for teens to hang out, party, and do other more adult activities. Today, it would have been more populated, but Sherlock and John were the only ones there. The killings more than likely had kept them away because it was a huge, isolated estate on the edge of town.
The phone rang. "I'll get that," John said. He picked it up from the wall. "Hello, Watson residence. Oh hi Mike. Yeah I work today at noon..." He realized he told Sherlock last night he could go to the beach with him. He forgot he had to work! Now he'd have to call him and tell him their day together was off. Well, there was tomorrow.
Greaser Sherlock and Jock John
It was a funny thing to think about, during a beautiful sunny day inside the Rose Garden at Regent's park, but Sherlock's brain wasn't like anyone else's brain, so funny thoughts would invade his head from time to time.
Greg chuckled. “Go on then, puff and drink away. But just this once. If Myc ever found out I allowed you to smoke, he’d have my hide, and not in the way I want.”
Soon John arrived at the nursery and he entered the warm building. Rosie's room was down the hall, the last room on the right. He opened the door that was decorated in blue construction paper, cutouts of penguins, snowflakes, and igloos happily taped onto the paper, and saw Michelle standing in the center of the room. "Hello," he greeted her warmly.
Sherlock smirked and leaned in close. "That later tonight I get to remove it from your body."
Warren had looked at John with intense ferocity. "I want you to make me forget Gray John. Just for a little while. I want roughness. I want everything you can give me."
Richard reached out and patted her hand. "It's not your fault dear. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but Carl Junior was not a nice boy. He bullied Henry for months until Sebastian put a stop to it, he bullied others..." Richard smiled sadly. "Forgive me, I shouldn't say such things---"
As if on cue, Mike and his wife were walking towards the foursome, with five happy kids in tow. The Lestrade children were all Doctor Who characters: Gordon, The Eleventh Doctor complete with fez, Amy was Amy Pond in brown jacket, scarf, white T-shirt, skirt and boots, Sadie was a Dalek. Brett was a mini version of John except his pants were blue and black striped and his T-shirt was white. Rosie was a mermaid.
"We'll talk to Sherlock. We'll talk to all of our children," Sidney promised.
"It doesn't make a difference to me," John replied, trying to stay nonchalant.
*****
Sherlock watched John put the pieces together. He grew tingly seeing John's eyebrows furrow, his pink tongue dart out and roll around on those gorgeous lips of his. Sherlock just wanted to push him down and kiss the life out of him. He didn't think John truly knew just how beautiful he was.
Still in shock from the murders of Phillip Anderson and Sally Donovan, the citizens of Sherrinford wake up to the news of Carl Powers' death. The killer makes another frightening call promising another murder, and one citizen finds themselves in great danger.
Marty's mouth dropped open, and Tim Carlton, who was sitting next to him, laughed. "Little Seb's got you there Marty."
Sherlock was naked sitting cross legged on his king-sized bed, laptop on his lean, muscular thighs. He was on the Leather and Lace website (after having deduced that John, a veteran with high morals and trust issues, would not dom outlaw, but working for a reputable business with an exclusive clientele,) gawking at John's pictures. Dear Lord, the man was HOT.
"Keep telling yourself that Mom."
Evie had signaled she was done with her drink, so John took the cup and washed it out, placing it aside with the other drying dishes. He scooped her up, which caused her to giggle and squeal. "Up Daddy up!" she told him.
Warren said nothing and fought hardly to keep still while John unleashed a barrage of smacks on his behind. "Excellent. You're doing wonderfully."
John's fingers freeze. "Do what?"
"God John, please stop."
John stopped reading as he slipped off his boots - that he'd been wearing all throughout - and set them by the door.
"I'm so sorry," John began.
"Music, theatre?"
"Nothing."
"I'll eat at home."
Sherlock's pale eyes are open, pleading, and John thinks perhaps actually sincere.
Smiling, he tucked the pink rabbit back into the box and sat back down. "Of course."
Hospital Resources Overwhelmed.
is owed for that foreknowledge, John thinks - and a pleasant smile. He is barely inside before they hear Rosie stir through the monitor, and John fetches, changes, and dresses her, carries her downstairs.
John cleared his throat just a little to get Sherlock's attention, and there was some quick questioning and reassurances going back and forth as they locked eyes. He looked over at Sameer. "Go on. I'm fine." John's sentence was quietly reassuring, although all of them in the room would have disputed the fact that John wasn't actually
"Leave that to me son," Dave replied reassuringly.
John had to laugh. "We're like some tragic couple in those cheesy soap operas Mom likes to watch."
Greg clapped John on the back. "It was a total gas today buddy. I can see why you love LA."
Regent's Park was practically deserted, which suited John just fine. He was sitting under a huge oak tree, reading comic books, his portable radio next to him playing "Summertime Blues" while the afternoon breeze gently caressed his golden tresses. An empty pint of chocolate milk along with an apple core sat next to him. His mother, who had come home as he was leaving, told him she was picking up pizza and salad for dinner, and John told her he would be home by five-thirty.
It's a stormy day in Sherrinford, and the killer strikes again...
In a matter of minutes the two were out the door and in John's car for their dinner date.
John did a double take, eyes wide and jaw dropped. "Sherlock? He's your brother? With the curly dark hair and cheekbones?"
"I won't. Now go, before someone catches us, and you'll be thrown in jail and I'll be grounded until I'm thirty."
"Bye Mom!" the siblings said in unison and they were out the door.
Until today the weather had been picture-perfect. The first week, Sherlock and John never left their hideaway, as it had been fully stocked with food and the two cooked their own meals, preferring to eat on their deck. They swam in the crystal blue sea, took exploring walks and found a giant sea turtle and its eggs, with Sherlock cataloging sea life and plants on his phone to study later. They loved being on their own private island and not having to answer to anyone, especially since Sherlock had developed a desire for outdoor sex. They did it on the beach, in a cave, and on their front porch. John didn't mind of course. He loved it when Sherlock got horny, and better to have a horny husband than a bored one.
Before John could speak, the other officer bolted from his position, sprinting towards the side of the small house. John and Dave looked up to see the cop dive to the ground. They heard shouts and a gruff “Don’t resist young man!”
John saw the two men. "Good morning gentlemen," he greeted with a smile as he strode past him, heading for the back employee entrance.
Ears could hear "I Fall to Pieces" playing from a car driving down the street. How appropriate, because it wouldn't be long before pieces would be falling---human pieces.
, Sherlock thought.
John opened the fridge and pulled out a bottle of orange juice. "You have any plans for today Mom?"
"This is not a game Eurus!" he hissed. "Spit it out now, or I'll make damn sure you'll never see Jim Moriarty again, and I'll confiscate that bloody beloved switchblade of yours."
Evie stared at Bryan, her blue eyes wide. Bryan smiled at her. "Hi Evie," he greeted her. Then the toddler smiled back. "Hi," she said shyly, and returned to eating her peas.
Sherlock and Jim watched John park his car. He got out, carrying his messenger bag. He was wearing a navy blue jumper over a pale blue shirt, gray dress slacks, and black loafers.
"I never thought you were stupid Molly. I can tell you're a very smart girl." He moved closer and placed a hand on her thigh. She brushed it away and this time he sighed. "I also think you're a very attractive girl."
The storm built in slowly, taking its sweet old time before unleashing a torrent of rain along with booming thunder and crackling lightning over London. Inside 221 B Baker Street, Sherlock and John paid it no mind as the two enjoyed a meal of shrimp fra diavolo from Angelo's that John had picked up after his surgery shift. A candle was on the table, along with a bottle of white wine, and classical music was playing from the kitchen radio.
"God Sherlock"--- John began, but was cut off by a pair of lips and tongue trying to seek access to John's mouth. John immediately parted his lips and after a passionate snogging session, Sherlock all but dragged John towards the bath. Yes, this Christmas rendezvous was most definitely the greatest Christmas gift they each could get, as the lyrics of the song played in their minds.
"You only think about yourself Eurus. I know some of that's my fault and your father's fault. But I never had thoughts about intentionally hurting anyone. I can't take the fault for that."
Mike's shop was housed in an old disco, so it was very large and could accommodate different events such as this meet and greet. His shop was known for its extensive collection of sci fi and horror titles from the 1960's to the present, as well as comic books. It was a literary geek's dream come true, and Mike was reaping the financial rewards.
He took a deep breath and smiled. "Well Vic, I never thought I'd find another happiness again after you died, but after meeting John and spending the day with him, I'm happy. And I know wherever you are, you're happy for me, and for our children."
It is not Rob the nurse, not Kathy the intensivist, and not Sherlock. He listens intently, disconnects quickly, calls the number Mycroft had left, and is dressed and on the kerb in approximately four minutes stomping his foot at the slowness of whatever branch of hell Mycroft has hired. In his mind, he replays the scant information.
And like this patient whom the nurse had shared, John would be glad to know they were out of the building, grateful for the recovery, such that it had been, and hopeful that long-term and lingering side effects would be minimal.
"Heroin being one." Sherlock waggled his mobile, with a tiny smirk. "It'd be a lucrative --"
Chapter is --- hmm.  Let's go with deliberately choppy (and so is life right now!)
Sherlock's response was immediate. "God, yes.
"I never really wanted to." For all the lies he'd spoke throughout the evening starting with 'I'm fine,' John did actually believe him. His manner and diction seemed real. "I wasn't going to."
"Going to release these," John said, working the clips on the canvas restraints. For variety, sometimes John wouldn't even tie them; this time, he had bound them together, secured to one of the bedposts. He lowered Sherlock's wrists, taking care to move slowly, stretching out gently those muscles that had been restrained. He placed his warm palm over the meat of Sherlock's bicep toward his shoulder, letting the warmth be soothing, the heat of his hand gentle as he guided the movement. Another clip released, and the canvas strap fell away from Sherlock's skin, right extremity first, then left. John brushed his thumbs over the grooves left behind, smoothing the tightness, his pressure over the faint marks soft and tender. "You pulled here, quite a bit." A few moments of massage and the ridges were just beginning to smooth out, to ease.
off of any structure seems a particularly personal, low blow - back at him. Instead, he reminds himself that medical professionals are just not as uncomfortable as basically everyone else in the entire universe when it comes to discussing bodily functions. He chooses the high road and waits for Sherlock to look at him, and their eyes meet. Despite Sherlock's protests and yes, embarrassment, John can see that he is actually uncomfortable and just perhaps, looking for help. But in a roundabout, indirect way. John knows he can oblige him in that, opts for a redirection again. Rolling his eyes, yet again, John chuckles. "Seriously? You do realise that --"
It would have been great to have been able to perform a brachial artery thrombectomy and have that be enough to fix the problem in the arm, but there was narrowing of that artery and the vascular surgeon apparently had some misgivings about rethrombosis in this acute phase and opted for thrombectomy plus balloon angioplasty followed by a stent. [Suck out the clot, dilate and open the vessel, and place a stent or scaffold there to hold it open]. There are many many many different ways to treat arterial occlusion, PE, DVT (and everything else in medicine) and is up to skill, preference, proficiency, and availability of provider, facility, and equipment.
Sherlock had been released from the hospital the previous morning and his parents immediately took him back to Sherrinford. They asked him what happened between he and John while he was in Los Angeles. Sherlock had actually been honest with them. He told his parents they had kissed, John admitted his attraction to him but would not act on it, and they agreed to just being classmates once school started.
Sherlock sighed happily and kissed John's forehead. "I'm so lucky I have a medical student for a boyfriend who doesn't care that I bring body parts into our dorm. I love you."
Mary had suffered massive internal injuries that were too severe for the surgeons to try and repair. John didn't remember anything after the announcement she'd died.
"That's exactly why I like it. You know me, sophistication is not my style."
"Yeah," he replied, licking his lips.
Sherlock bent down to kiss his blogger. "And I'm actually feeling a bit peckish. Want to order room service?"
"Cherry cola please."
“Well, good thing they’re in the rich section of town and not down here with us ol’ regular Joes,” John replied, taking all of what Molly said in.
John licked his lips and stared at what his husband held. They were both enticing. One was silver with a jeweled red heart at the top, the other clear with thin dark blue lines circling around the top.
The moon was disappearing as its daylight comrade the sun began to rise in the orange and pink tinted sky. In an abandoned warehouse on the docks of the Thames, a werewolf let out one last howl as it began to shift and transform back into its human form, a small, muscular man. Snow white fur was replaced by tanned skin and blond hair, glowing yellow eyes became blue orbs with a ring of brown around them.
John entered the lobby and made his way towards the elevator. Warren's flat was on the fifth floor, number 514.
Those were her last words before she fell to the ground in a faint, the glasses of lemonade crashing to the floor with her.
Sherlock leaned down and pressed a kiss to John's hair. "I love you," he whispered.
Sylvia broke away from her daughter and smiled at her reassuringly. "Lock up the house okay? I'll call you later this afternoon."
John nodded. “Yes please. That’s what I want.” He placed the hose on the porch step and was about to open the door when two arms wrapped strongly around his waist and a pair of warm lips peppered kisses up and down his neck. “Hey! Get off me! I told you I wanted you to go!” He grabbed Sherlock’s hands and pried them away. Whirling around to face the other boy, he saw that now familiar smirk, and anger boiled up inside him. He’d had enough. He lashed his hand out and backhanded Sherlock hard. The greaser gasped, grabbing his face and furiously rubbed it.
"Great, thanks Doctor."
"Me too Syl. We can't have our kids running scared."
The two made some circles while holding hands, exchanging happy smiles with each other. Eventually Sherlock broke away to do some solo skating. John watched him elegantly move around, thinking how beautiful and graceful he was, like a ballet dancer. He wondered if Sherlock ever took dancing lessons.
John was sitting in the cafeteria with Molly, Greg, Victor, Mary, Little Seb, Janine, and Mike. Sherlock had quickly grabbed an apple and a carton of milk and split to spend lunch outside, and John didn't blame him. He hadn't been exactly making friends his first day of school thanks to his observant mind and unfiltered mouth. John had suggested he dial back the deductions but Sherlock pretty much refused. John told him "it's your funeral," and walked away to eat lunch with his friends.
"Yes." Lucy looked away for a moment before facing her husband again. "There's no easy to say it, so I just will. Jeff said that Richard Wilkes shot him before he passed out, and the police strongly believe Richard is the Sherrinford Slayer."
"I will. See you soon," Oliver replied, leaving the two older men to sit it out in the waiting room.
John began to cry, his salty tears mixing in with the fresh taste of the rain falling on his body. He fought to stay strong, but the events of tonight, intertwined with what happened last Christmas, was too much for him to bear anymore. He crumpled to the ground in a fit of sobs. Mary’s dad crouched down and cradled him. “Tell me what happened John.”
Greg got up. “I’ve had enough. My love life is none of your business Ms. Holmes. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m getting the hell out of here. I need to be somewhere normal, with normal people.”
Friday night ended up being lovely and mild with a clear, black star-filled moonless sky. On the back lawn of Hiddleston High, a large group of Year 9's were congregating, some sitting on blankets and talking amongst each other, some still looking through telescopes, some enjoying tea and cider that was being served by Molly, Mike and a few parents.
"It was, wasn't it? See, astronomy isn't so worthless after all."
John slowly went to the window, bat in right hand, while he lifted the curtain with his left. He breathed a big sigh of relief when he saw Sherlock standing outside. John unlatched the window and Sherlock climbed in. "What are you doing here, and why did you come to my window instead of the front door?" he scolded.
Greg snorted. "Of course. Everyone at the Yard knows about their affair, except for Mrs. Anderson. So now the two of them are off to some ritzy marriage rehab, all expenses paid by the wife's in-laws. They love him. I'll never understand why, but hey, it's their money."
Molly nodded. "I went up to his class this morning for small talk before the kids come like I always do, and he told me he saw you coming into class this morning. I think you made quite an impression on him."
John gave Evie a small amount of diet gingerale to settle her stomach. Mrs. Doyle had given it to him. She bought the diet by mistake and John agreed to take it. He wasn’t a big soda drinker, but he did like the taste of gingerale from time to time, and he was glad he had it tonight.
His bedroom window was open, and every so often a night breeze would waft through, cooling the air down.
Forty-five minutes later, Oliver entered the waiting room with a huge grin on his face. "Your grandson has arrived! Eight pounds four ounces, a full head of blond hair, and dark blue eyes."
Sherlock chuckled. "You and food."
John picked up his daughter from his boss' wife, went back to his trailer, and while Evie was asleep, he spent most of the night setting up his new phone, eagerly anticipating the next phase of his new life and identity as The Captain.
"Those guys, as you put it, were just transport John. Nothing to be concerned about."
"You should have been here earlier when it was in the oven. I was about ready to pull it out and cut a slice," Molly joked.
As John turned to leave the cemetery his phone dinged. Pulling his mobile out of his pocket, he saw a text from Sherlock.
Molly shook her head. "Heard what?"
With the holidays coming up, I'm going to take a short hiatus and resume the story after Christmas. Happy Holidays!
Sherlock took note of Mrs. Watson's reaction and smirked. "You weren't expecting someone like me were you. You pictured someone broader with muscles."
John suppressed a shudder of desire and arousal. “I like that date even better,” John replied huskily, leaning down to kiss him again. “See you at six-thirty love.”
John saw the tall, gorgeous alpha with a head full of curls walking towards him and he was dumbstruck. The powerful scent that captivated him was coming from this man.
Sherlock's cheeks turned pink. John thought he looked even gorgeous with color on his face. "Sherlock, would you like to go to dinner after I get off work? My shift ends at four."
Her brother Jeremy entered the room, holding two cups in each hand. "The cafeteria is closed, they're getting ready for lunch, but they had free tea and coffee set out." He handed a cup to Lucy. "I got you tea, with honey and two sugars."
*****
"What?" Harold exclaimed.
Sherlock already had a pair of black leather trousers and a form-fitting long-sleeve black shirt for his costume. All he needed was some cat ears, a tail, and a mask. He completed his look with black combat boots and black lace fingerless gloves. He'd painted his nails black after turning down John's suggestion of wearing fake black nails, he said he couldn't pick anything up with them and was afraid they'd fall off.
Molly giggled again. "The movies."
Sherlock's expression was unmoved. "I met Carl. The day I ran off to Los Angeles to find you. He gave me a ride to Speedy's."
There was a few beats of silence, then the clapping started. John stood, wiping the sweat off his forehead, then bowed and smiled at the audience. He looked towards Sherlock, who wasn't clapping but gazed at him with a mixture of reverence and lust. He winked at him then turned to make his way towards Mycroft and Greg to thank them for inviting him into their domain.
Sherlock spent the rest of the evening examining the body parts over in his lab at 221C, while the rest of the boxes were carefully contained in the lab fridge. John, extremely glad Sherlock loved his gifts, was curled up on the sofa with a cup of hot chocolate, listening to Christmas carols, and reading his new Doctor Who novel, At Childhood's End, an early Christmas gift from Sherlock. The ice that had earlier glazed the streets of London turned back into a softly falling snow, making this a picture-perfect December night.
The radio was still on, and the music got interrupted by the DJ's voice. "Okay folks, we've got breaking news regarding the Carl Powers murder. Earlier this morning, Sherrinford Strand reporter Kitty Reilly received a phone call that is believed to be from the killer. With the permission of the police, we are playing it live, for the first time."
, he thought.
"You know the one lyric, "say, what's in this drink?" Well the men were going to use the excuse that the girls had gotten so drunk, they wouldn't be able to consent. Combine that with the big snowstorm the night of the party, they felt it would keep them from being exposed for their crime. They could say the weather was so bad nobody could have left," Sherlock explained.
“Yeah. Unlike some people, I have to work.” He grinned broadly at his friend. “But I’m off tomorrow, so maybe you can come over and listen to records with me and Victor. Unless you have other plans with your girl.” He gazed at Irene, who flashed him a dazzling smile.
"We're terrific Mom, that's why I'm calling. I've got wonderful news---I'm pregnant!"
The door opened to reveal the smiling face of biology teacher Molly Hooper. "Hey Molly."
A few minutes later, Valerie, the receptionist, stood up. "I just got off the phone with the power company. Thank god for mobiles. You're not going to believe this. Someone deliberately shut off the power to the grid to our office. They said the power should come back on in the next two hours or so."
"May I have at least another kiss?" Sherlock pleaded.
John sat down next to her on the blanket and glanced out at the ocean. “Hmm, I think I know what those daydreams were about.” He grinned and lightly punched her on the shoulder, causing Molly to blush bright red.
Gloria realized she was in a hospital bed. She was alive. They'd gotten to her and saved her. Somebody did care. Now maybe others would too.
John had been admitted after the suspect he and Sherlock were chasing somehow managed to slip down a hidden alley and snuck up on the two. John had for some reason felt something was wrong, and as he turned around, he saw the suspect raise a knife. John moved back, but unfortunately managed to sustain a nasty slice on his forearm. Despite the pain and the bleeding, he was able to tackle the suspect while Sherlock cuffed him. Lestrade and his crew got there two minutes later, and called for an ambulance after seeing John's injury.
Several students cried. Many of them were planning an after-Homecoming party there. John remembered his own times of going there, and the last time, which was with Sherlock. He couldn't believe it. A beautiful piece of history and workmanship, destroyed in hours thanks to a maniac with a gas can. He wouldn't be satisfied until he burned down the town. Maybe that's what he was trying to do. Erase Sherrinford off the map.
Dave entered the home, passing through the foyer into the huge living room. He saw the large stain of blood, still bright red, seeped into the plush carpet. A man was standing in front of it, he knew him to be the medical examiner, Fred Dryer.
Jim grinned deviously. "Sebby will be so flabbergasted. He keeps telling me I'm the best present he could ever get, so why not get him the gift that keeps on giving?"
"I'd rather have you safe with less money than dead with more," Wanda seriously replied.
Reluctantly, Sherlock broke away. John was right. He'd made a very risky move sneaking out of the house, and if his parents called the police, there'd be hell to pay. Again.
Just then, the doorbell rang. "I'll get that," Richard said. He went to answer the door, and saw Officer Dave Morstan. Dread and worry crossed his face. "Officer Morstan, is it about Gloria? Please tell me you have some good news."
John dived into the ocean, letting the water take him. He could hear Sherlock scream for him but he kept swimming farther and farther away, fighting the unforgiving tide. He’d rather drown than be subject to Sherlock’s twisted desire. Then he felt a pair of hands reach out, clasping his shoulders, and he screamed…
"Oh Harry, that's a lovely name..." Wanda had to stop talking as tears formed in her eyes. "Ham would have been thrilled. I wish he was here celebrating the good news."
Molly Hooper watched a handsome and muscular boy with light brown hair splash around in the ocean with a gorgeous, curvy redhead, wearing a white bikini that showed off her perfect California tan. Molly sighed and looked down at her boring pink one-piece and flat chest.
Two ambulances transported John and Wilkes to the hospital. A third took the two injured officers away for treatment. John was conscious and in a lot of pain. Wilkes was unconscious, but alive. Both men were rushed to surgery. Hal had been treated by a paramedic in front of the house and refused to be looked at by a doctor, but said he would see one if the wound became infected.
*****
John began to leap and twirl. His moves were intense, urgent. They had their own kind of grace and delicateness, but there was a brusqueness to them to Sherlock liked. He wondered what John's face looked like under the helmet and he hoped he would remove it.
Pete shifted in his seat towards her to answer. "If you knew John as good as Sylvia and I do Susan, you'd believe it. He's had to grow up fast since his father died, he's supporting his mom financially, he's pretty much had to be the man of the house. He feels he can handle things on his own. And with what happened last year with the Wilkes boy---he's embarrassed that he's attracting unwanted attention, especially from other teenage boys. However, with Sherlock actually stalking him, he'll probably change his mind and will press charges. But that's on him. So far, he's the only one Sherlock has gone after."
John drained the last of his drink. "I think I'll have one more, than I'll hit the road. The drizzle is supposed to turn into a downpour, with heavy rain off and on all night. I brought my umbrella, but I'd rather not be a drowned rat."
"How do you know John?"
"Everyone has a heart. And maybe if we listened to it more, we'd be better off," John affirmed.
John's face lit up.  "Really? That's great! I mean it. I wanted you to take over the clothing part. I know you'll find us something great."
The sky was darkening to a grayish-purple, so the two packed up the blanket and remnants of their lunch and headed back to their home. Thunder rumbled in the threatening skies, and they had just made it in the door when the rain began to fall down in a torrent. The two smiled at each other and laughed, relieved they had missed the downpour.
*****
"I want to make it clear to everyone in this room that if any of your children feel threatened or are harassed, not just by the Holmes siblings, but by anyone, call us. Please don't take it upon yourselves to play vigilante, or you'll be the one in jail. Unfortunately we have no laws against stalking. Convince your children to trust us and report the behavior," Dave insisted.
Bill locked the door and the two men were on their way to the club. It was about a ten minute walk and as they got closer they saw a small crowd of men congregating in front of the building. The club was housed in a former Waitrose. A blue neon sign that said Total Eclipse hung right in the middle of where the Waitrose sign used to be. The building was painted black and the windows had been blacked out too.
"Don't mind him, he gets in these moods," John appeased.
She nodded. "Thanks to Angelo and Mary, the kitchen is spotless---which will be great since the health inspector is coming on Monday, and you've done a great job putting the delivery away. The only thing to do is close up, and Angelo and I can handle that. We'll be done before seven."
"Hmm, I think that's going to be my favorite," John said, and gave Sherlock's pert cheek another squeeze.
The alpha cast John a puzzling glance. "He's not an alpha?"
"If you say so Mrs. H. I'll see you Monday after school," Mary said with a smile, beginning to unlace her skates.
"There's a taxi already out front. I'll be home soon. I love you, and I'm glad you're safe. Oh, and the tests on the poison they found on that wine bottle, it turned out to be thallium. Molly was able to find out, she's got a friend at the lab the bottle was sent to who provided her with the results."
“Nothing gets past you brother mine.” Mycroft pulled out of the jail parking lot and those were the last words spoken during the ride home.
Sherlock blushed yet again, and Brett snickered, knowing his dad was a looker and would often get people, mostly other men, flirting with him. Usually the men were gross, but Brett liked this one.
Sherlock and John said goodbye to their friends and wished a happy honeymoon for the newlyweds, who were traveling to Tuscany, Italy. The detective and the blogger dodged the raindrops as they headed for their car. Little Rosie was asleep in John's arms, not bothered by the falling water.
The words settle around them, oddly in conflict with the energy of their little corner of the restaurant. Life all around them, and John breathes a few times, making peace yet again - a daily occurrence - with such a profound loss.
"Don't hold your breath," Sherlock muttered. "Actually, on second thought," he let the obvious conclusion to the sentence remain unsaid. "I don't know why you thought I would be able to stomach a job like this. Filing? Carrying things, scheduling, keeping order? Being some sort of glorified personal assistant to the buffoons at the Met? It's ... awful." With a sour purse to his mouth, he spoke again. "Next thing, they'll have me answering the phones."
He sweetened the appeal, toned it down, spoke only one more word. "Please."
"I mean, if you're going to throw a little temper tantrum, you don't need me here for that."
That option is just not an option any longer, it is too late for that, no matter his deep, unuttered thoughts.
John had barely even looked at Sherlock after the door shut when Sherlock snarled, "I know." He then flounced on the couch, putting his back to John, and any further conversation was not returned.
Sherlock leaned close, pressed the back of his hand to John's forehead, then over his ear, then into the side of his not-quite-all-buttoned up shirt collar. John pulled away abruptly when Sherlock's hand touched his neck. "My mum used to at least kiss the side of my head, when she was checking for fever." They met eyes, holding. "I don't have a fever."
Maybe I'll make that phone call once I get back.
God he'd been hoping for more. And it had looked like, perhaps, things might have been getting ready to change.
missing out. So don't couch this as a gift for
"Hey," he says quietly to Sherlock.
John thinks briefly of the regular baby-chaos of his life and considers how that could possibly mesh with the Sherlock-chaos here. "You've no idea what you're suggesting."
Sheila returns with a large steaming styrofoam cup, hands it off to John, and they discuss the logistics of breakfast, which John orders for him although they both wait for Sherlock to nod his final approval. John divides the water, places the tea bags, sets them on the overbed table in front of Sherlock's chair. He sits across from him and tries to enjoy the camaraderie. If nothing else, they do both enjoy the tea. The similarity to what they usually prefer, though, there in Baker Street, dressing gowns instead of patient gown, real slippers instead of hospital socks, freedom instead of being somewhat confined, is limited. Eventually, Sherlock finishes about half of his cup, pushes it away, casts a disappointed look at it.
Rosie, at nearly eleven, was off at a programme through her school, an academic immersion camp experience where her efforts at science had won her the award, a spot on the trip with one of her teachers and a few other area students. The programme was three weeks duration, and so far she'd only been gone half that. They'd agreed on a regular evening text message exchange, and that too had been working. She was enjoying herself, making new friends, and 'not missing you at all papa.' This was followed by a winky emoticon.
The gaze Sherlock leveled at him was nearly murderous. "I'm not that bored." One brow raised in serious displeasure. "No one is ever
syncope
And confirmed with the way the sedation overpowered his respiratory drive. "Deep breath. Deep breath, that's better."
When Sherlock is still and quiet, probably overwhelmed on sensation and exhaustion, John decides for them both. "Chair." It only takes a moment to get him seated, comfortable, the oxygen tank in the sturdy canvas holder, slung off his shoulder to rest on the floor, and John consults his mobile for the time. "I'll toss you the pulse ox in about five minutes, let you recover, and we'll go from there." Sherlock's eye-roll is almost audible. "You will not fight me on this." It is the Captain Watson voice, and, retired or not, John's threat will not be taken lightly.
The battle was long and debilitating, arduous, with multiple set-backs, and the residual weakness left in Dan as the ventilator was finally successfully withdrawn was profound. He would have to learn to move, walk again, swallow again, cough, and it was going to be a very long haul. But the night following the discharge from the hospital, upon John's arrival at home, he felt an ease, a need to share, and a relief in the telling. "He went to a rehab centre today."
"I don't want to hear it." A brow raised in a vague threat. "They're fine."
Let me know if anything is particularly unclear.
Sherlock lets out a bark of disbelief. "If you have concerns, Mycroft, please do not feel the need to go out and consult in the hallway as if I have no clue what you're discussing."
"One of Mycroft's staff has supplied it with groceries, linens. We can keep what we want, change what we don't."
"Yes. Refractory." She hesitated at the doorway, laid a hand on it, stopped again to talk further. John appreciated that she wasn't rushing. "I don't want to cancel. I don't particularly want to give him too much more, either, for what should be a moderate sedation procedure. I don't especially want to go with general anaesthesia here, which has been suggested, so I have a request for you."
Despite his words, he didn't move. He watched Sherlock watch him back, an eye-contact showdown. "We'll just go then?"
." He sounds typically impatient. And relieved.
"Thanks for thinking the best of me." He said this with a smile, curling onto his side then, tucking his hand under the pillow as his back arched, the line of his form under the sheets strong and smooth. "No. I merely know you're shouldering a terrible burden at work. I know you're in the heat of the battle now, and ... I actually was just trying to ... do something
"No, I'm fine," John assured her. "Care package."
"Stop fussing. I'm fine. Just leave me alone."
"Of course not."
The nurse shakes her head, her chuckle full of mirth. "You have no idea how lucky you actually are."
His delivery was with enough attitude that John could do nothing else save chuckle, and at the noise, Sherlock's head pivoted to pin the glare on John. John leaned back in a little, not cowed in the least. "Yes, we humans do tend to feed our feelings." His proclamation was shortly followed by a quiet snicker from the woman in the doorway, and he wasn't done, "which is fine, by the way," and Mrs. Hudson smiled again, though Sherlock only huffed a few times before rolling his eyes and relaxing, glaring at the window as if it had done something personally affronting.
"He charmed you, tricked you, mustered up these false tells." His annoyance, his ire, is palpable. "Just go home."
"Sherlock."
"They'd last about thirty seconds with me like this."
. For the last month, John has mostly stayed in, feeling close to Sherlock in the memories, wearing his dressing gown, working around his toothbrush, still stepping over his slippers. Re-reading the published blog. Re-reading the blog post drafts unsuitable for outside, prying eyes. Those, held near and dear, were the best: too personal, too revealing, too private to be shared. John and Sherlock's. And now, John's.
"You don't yell
"Yes he is." John could hear noise inside the flat again, chattering, the sound of regular activities, music playing. Sam was speaking, and Rosie responded, then both of them could be heard laughing. "You've traveled a long way. What exactly do you want?"
Looking puzzled, Sam shook his head, and John pulled out his tablet, did a very small amount of online searching. "In Afghanistan, in Dari, Sameer means evening conversationalist, it says."
"And now we have eternity. Together."
A faint smile curved upward on Mycroft's face, lasted only a few seconds, and then he nodded. "I spent some time perusing your personnel records, your university transcript, and your employment history." John forced his breathing to remain steady and non-reactive. "With good reason, you'll find." Mycroft's head tipped up, something like approval in his carriage. "Mr. Watson, I have a consideration for you." They met and held eye contact again for a few seconds. "Which I will discuss with you in the hallway."
When he awakens, they have obviously adjusted in their sleep and their positions are reversed, and he finds himself as the smaller spoon. The hesitancy he'd displayed in pressing his erection against Sherlock's bum is one hundred percent absent from Sherlock, and the hardness poking him at the tops of the back of his thighs is insistent and rigid.
There are 5 P's of compartment syndrome: pain, pallor, paresthesia, pulselessness, and paralysis. Some lists include poikilothermia (alteration in temperature between limbs, the affected side being cooler). The biggest tip-off is severe pain out of proportion to the injury. There are four compartments in the lower leg and usually an emergency fasciotomy involves two vertical incisions that parallel the tibia, on the medial and lateral areas of the shin. I have left the specifics deliberately vague because there is very little credible research on field fasciotomy. Either way, compartment syndrome is a medical (surgical) emergency that can cause loss of limb or life. I re-state the tag:  Do Not Try This At Home!
From the desk of
"Yes, me too."
It was enough.
A little while later, John texted again.
The boy's eyes got really, hugely wide. "He was talking about you? He said that to
Helplessly, Sherlock glanced over at John, but before either could speak, she chortled with another thought.
Another milestone was that first morning, their first morning home, when Sherlock awakened somewhat surprised to find John only a pillow's length away, in the bed with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Visibly Greg balks, but John chuckles again, takes it from him, and places it rakishly on his head. He murmurs, away from the mic, "Wear the damn hat."
"Of course not. This was perfect."
John takes a settling breath. "Yes. From Mycroft."
"Holmes? Are you family?"
Turning abruptly, Sherlock glared, point blank range, at John.
"How successful is it, given his age and such?" John asked, knowing that Sherlock would wonder too.
A hand slides up against her bicep, warm, gentle, and then rests there. "They loved it here," her husband whispers from the well-used, rustic chair at her side.
