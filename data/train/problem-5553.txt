"Well, that does make more sense." Tony held out his hand for Bucky. "Pleased to meet you, James B. Barnes."
Natasha gave him a sly smile. "We placed a tracking and jamming chip of our own on you."
"He probably could've, if he'd really wanted to," Miss Potts said, in a long-suffering tone, suggesting that she had some opinions on her employer. "I'm not going to defend his actions to you. He'll have to do that himself."
"I'm not going to run!" Tony protested. "I'm getting my armor. Come on. I'll need a hand."
"What I take from all this is that we should probably accept Pierce's offer," Tony concluded, looking around the table to meet everyone's eyes.
When the conversation paused, Stark turned towards Bucky again. "I need to get there," he said, gesturing at the back wall, across the room, where he'd spent a lot of his time on the past few days.
Even if his shelter keeps the worst of the rain away, it's obvious that he can't stay here. He has to get up and start moving, rain or not, or he'll freeze to death.
A large truck whizzed past, honking at him angrily.
He was just so tired.
Oh, God.
He should've talked to Tony and told him these things. Now, he'll never get the chance.
Fury nodded. "That's up to you, of course. If you don't, you don't. If you ever change your mind, let us sort it out for you. As you may have heard, around here, it's private companies that do the matching. We'd rather not have you putting your genetic information out there, but we're on good terms with Stark Industries. I'm sure we can arrange something."
Tony shifted slightly, as if to move away. "Alternatively, I could just get you another beer," he offered. Just like last time, he'd quickly jumped to the conclusion that Steve's hesitation was leading up to rejection.
He couldn't tell Tony not to go, but he thought he should at least say something. "You didn't sound too happy about it," he noted.
"Oh, no, I have no idea. It's a complete mystery to me." Tony leaned closer to press a kiss on the inside of Steve's thigh, halfway towards his knee, and started working his way closer along it, licking and nibbling at the sensitive skin. Before he got all the way to Steve's cock, he curved upwards, continuing towards his hipbone instead, letting Steve's cock brush the side of his face.
"I didn't expect this to be easy. I know you're as tough as they come," Tony said conversationally, as if he wasn’t currently squeezing the life out of Steve's frame. "Oh, well. I'm a patient man. I'm sure we'll get there, eventually."
Steve was half wondering if he was still asleep. "What? It's already official?"
The room wasn't filled with treasure, although what he saw was as pretty as any jewelry: metal carved into intricate shapes that gleamed in tones of gold, silver and copper. Clearly, these were parts of machines, but they were unlike any technology Bucky had seen. The thing that resembled them the most was the construction of his metal arm, which he suspected must be inspired by these creations. None of the contraptions looked complete, but a few had enough parts left to see the general size and shape of them, which resembled dinosaurs of some kind. The countless smaller pieces also looked like parts of living beings, like fins or vertebrae, except that everything was made of metal.
It stings that Steve's team picked up intel that all of Tony's network of tech and skilled specialists failed to notice, but he has no reason to believe that's anything other than an isolated incident. Steve's probably just making a lot of noise about it to goad Tony. He probably shouldn't let it get to him.
He had been looking for something non-violent and constructive for his company to do. What could be less violent than bringing lovers together? As much as he still hated the whole soulmate concept, he couldn't deny that it was a brilliant idea. Besides, even if it didn't turn out the way they expected, they could just stick to biomedical research. Not a bad direction to go, either.
"Yes, I met him the following night at the Sleepy Eyes Inn," Steve said.
"Stand down, Rhodey. It's fine. He's telling the truth," Tony says, rushing forwards to place a placating hand on Rhodey's forearm.
That, he might do, Steve had to admit: like Tony's friends always said, he was a survivor, and if survival had required feigning obedience, he would have gone for it. "Well, whatever's going on, it won't matter anymore," Steve said. "We're going to get him out of there tonight. We should go tell the others and start preparing for the operation."
He didn't know what he wanted anymore. He hadn't wanted a soulmate. He
Steve made it as far as the bar-reception area on the street floor before the first wave of guilt struck him.
"Of course," Steve said.
Stark let go of Bucky and took a few stumbling steps backwards. "No, please don't. They can't help, and that would be very bad," he said hurriedly, his eyes wide, as if the very idea was something shocking that hadn't even crossed his mind.
In the past, their dynamic had tended to revolve around Steve's frames, not Tony's, but Steve didn't think the unfamiliarity was the issue. Not after so many years. They'd need to build something new, and that should start with things they were both comfortable with.
"There is this ancient thing called death by a thousand cuts," Tony said, the blade trailing over Steve's stomach with just enough pressure that he felt it, not breaking the skin yet. "Think we can make it to one thousand before you black out?"
He's so tired, though.
"So, have you solved the case yet, Sherlock?" Tony asked as Steve joined him on the landing platform at the appointed hour of departure.
Steve asked.
"That's all I need to know," Steve said, no less concerned, although it was a relief to have an idea of what the issue might be. If the sunstone was out of charge, that should be easy to fix. If it was more than that—Steve didn't know who could repair it. Maybe Jarvis, but probably not here, on the road, without tools and materials. He hoped that wasn't something they'd have to consider.
Natasha and Clint didn't take Steve to the high-level Manhattan police station he was familiar with, but a much smaller and shabbier one on the 25th floor, far from Midtown. He saw only a handful of officers in the rooms they passed. The windowless office at the end of their walk was recognizable as belonging to the commanding officer only because of the little holo plaque announcing it, and the imposingly large desk that filled most of the room.
Tony stepped closer to Steve and placed a hand on his shoulder, a single point of warmth amidst the chill. Steve shivered at the touch, though that was more than just the temperature.
"Probably nowhere close to us. I can stay up here and keep an eye on the situation. You go join the others," Natasha suggested, her hand on his bicep.
Tony's life after Afghanistan was, somehow, simultaneously better and worse than it had ever been.
"Thank you," Miss Potts said, getting up from her seat. The smile she gave Randall as he made his exit didn't look practiced, but genuinely friendly. Perhaps that was thanks to the freckles on her face, a detail one wouldn't expect on the overly perfect designer frames that business types preferred. Or rather, had preferred, back in Steve's day and age. Maybe the current trend was for more personable looks. He wouldn't know.
"Well, I've got you to thank for it," Tony says.
The first thing Steve did after he'd showered, dressed and breakfasted was to take one of the limos to pay a visit to the police station and see if they had any news. Of course, he could've just called, but that would've defeated the entire purpose of this trip. On the way, he asked Ultron about his access restrictions, and got the answer he expected.
She must be referring to the New York University campus, maybe fifteen minutes' walk away. That gave Steve a new direction to pursue with his investigation: contact the university and ask around to see if anyone there could tell him more about Maya.
He must've fallen asleep at some point, because the next time he was aware of his surroundings again, the voices were gone, and he felt slightly better, the aches and pains more distant, his lungs clearer.
One thing was for sure: Stark definitely hadn't been faking he was ill.
"Now!" Pepper called out, and started dragging Steve onwards.
Stark instructed Bucky where to set him down, seated in front of some specific collection of machinery. Bucky had no clue what any of it was for, and Stark didn't stop to explain, just went straight to work, no doubt moving as fast as his badly strained breathing and visibly shaking hands allowed.
"Yeah, it's something I cobbled together using CyberLife tech. Think of it as an improvised pacemaker," Tony tells her, trying to keep it as casual as he can. He decides to leave it at that. It's easier not to go into detail about how it's also an electromagnet and possibly the most compact power generator anyone's ever built. "You know androids don't scar like this, right?" he adds, waving a hand in front of the device.
It had to be past nine in the morning already. Usually, Steve would be up by this time, with a plan in mind for the rest of the day. Today was different. This encounter with Tony had left him unsure of what his next steps should be. Should he try to bring Tony in, and stop him from going to that meeting? By the sound of things, Tony didn't know everything, either. Only Maya did. If Steve prevented their meeting, he might never learn the full story.
The thing that finally broke through the trance was everyone else in the room freezing to stare at Bruce, who was holding Loki's scepter.
He'd heard enough descriptions and read enough papers that he knew what this had to be, although he didn't want to name it aloud even inside his head.
"Aren't you going to join me?" Steve asked. It occurred to him that this might be about the artifact—maybe Tony wanted to hide it. Maybe he'd want Steve not to see him strip.
He felt tired all the time, these days, but there were many explanations for that which had nothing to do with the sunstone and his heart. He probably hadn't fully recovered from the blood loss back in the Rainy Basin, not with dehydration and malnutrition piled on top of it. Besides, he wasn't getting very much sleep, when all he had for bedding were a stone floor and a few thin, moth-eaten blankets.
Tony was stuck in an inferno, the blistering hot air burning at his lungs as he struggled to draw breath. He thought someone was screaming, but he wasn't sure, maybe that was just his ears ringing. It was too bright, so bright, he couldn't see, and—
He was hallucinating. He had to be. Steve couldn't be there, because Steve was thousands of miles away, and Steve hated him. Besides, Steve couldn't be there, not really, because it looked like he was right in front of Tony's face, and yet, Tony couldn't feel him at all.
"Hi. Would you like to buy my coat?" Steve offered.
Steve gaped at her, trying to understand what was going on. "Are you Tony Stark's assistant? Or someone else in an identical frame?"
He didn't know what to do. Maybe he should just leave, like Tony had told him to. That would be the easiest and simplest solution. It would also be the most cowardly one. Walk away, forget about Tony, let him spend the rest of his days in hiding. Try to never think about any of this again.
"I'll be sure to keep that in mind in case I ever get really desperate," Kamski says condescendingly.
Obie seems to notice where Tony's looking, and his expression grows even more malicious. "I'm going to set him up, you know. Your precious plastic buddy. It'll look like he killed you, and CyberLife will be in too much trouble over it to resist our intrusion to their market."
At least this gets him off the hook from facing the difficult conversations, for now.
"I'm here to see Stane," Steve returned, keeping his tone as calm as he could. "Are you going to take me to him or not?"
Tony grimaced. "I might be. Didn't I say I didn't want to talk about it?"
"You saw what happened." Steve looks away. As he continues, his expression is distant, his voice subdued. "That's what happened with the other SR100's. They deviated from their programming. It's the reason why they stopped developing my model. The first time it happened, they thought it was some isolated glitch, so they moved on to the second unit, went through our code with a fine-tooth comb, decided it was good, and sent him to field tests. And then it happened again. They locked me up because they didn't want to risk a third incident."
"He's starting to, yeah," Joe replied.
"Miss Potts. I trust you've got Steve close by as well," Stane said, staring at them through the screen. "And whatever other sad misfits he's managed to talk into helping him in his doomed cause." Stane nodded at Tony, while obviously, purposefully, not using his name. "I just thought I'd let you know I've got him exactly where he belongs. Better hurry with those rescue plans, eh? That frame isn't going to last very long."
Even if talking turned out to be a mistake, it wasn't as if Steve had a lot left to lose. He might as well. "There was some kind of a conspiracy inside SHIELD, and from what I've heard since I woke up, I'm guessing they ended up in control," he said. "I wasn't part of it. I was set up."
"Huh. I haven't thought about that at all," Steve admitted. He'd been too preoccupied with concern over Tony to think of his own frame. He'd hated the organic fake they'd put him in at first, but he was actually starting to grow used to it.
Tony slept a little better that night, curled up in a wool blanket that was twice as thick as the ones he'd had before. It wasn't going to get him out of here, but it was a start.
"Sure, if you let me offer the next round," Steve said.
Steve gave Tony's thigh a slight squeeze, to keep him close. "Sorry, I was—I'm a little overwhelmed, I guess. I didn't think I'd even find you, and, well, here we are."
Steve did get distracted, his own hand on Tony's cock half forgotten as he thrust into Tony's fist. "Tony," he moaned breathlessly. He'd had to avoid using that name the last time they'd been together. It felt good to be finally able to say it aloud. No more lying and hiding.
Tony gives him a wry smile. "Make no mistake, I'm not going to make a habit of it."
Tony shook his head. "No. It'd only make things worse. It's better to keep it a secret. It's not so bad, anyway," he said unconvincingly.
"Tony. What did you do?" he demanded.
"No, I—" Stark began.
By the time Pepper showed up, there was less booze in the bottle than there was in him, but he was still feeling embarrassingly shaken considering this was all brought on by a paper he'd read. He'd been through months of torture and been betrayed by his mentor, for crying out loud. He was seriously overreacting here. Still, it was what it was. He poured the remaining contents of the bottle into his glass and swirled them around.
The resistance members who were better informed always said that Stark was devious and corrupt, valuing the lives of dinosaurs over his fellow humans. If that was true, Stark wouldn't show Bucky any mercy if their roles were reversed.
Unfortunately, Kamski's poker face is so good that his reaction reveals nothing. He looks mildly curious, if anything. "Hm. That's unusual. What kind of specs are we talking about? Can you tell me the serial number?"
Steve wasn't sure if he could trust a word this man was saying, but it did match what he had witnessed: Tony had gone without resisting. The unexpected part was the man's resentment of Tony.
Tony tilted his head against Steve, trying to shift and get a look at him. "H-how?" he gasped.
"And did he tell you how dangerous it would be for him to stay in the dark?" Steve asked.
Tony would cheer if he wasn't paralyzed and dying.
"You did, but maybe you didn't consider all the options," Steve said, running his hand soothingly down Tony's spine. "You don't have to deal with this on your own, not anymore. I know people who can help."
"I knew you went through a lot, but I had no idea," she says softly. "Does it hurt?"
They're both careful to keep their identities secret. Their immediate circle of friends knows the truth, and Tony supposes Obie can guess it, if he's following the news from his prison cell. Aside from them, there's one additional person who knows enough to be able to piece it together: Elijah Kamski.
Steve thought long and hard about moving to the Tower. It was a tempting offer. It would be nice to have people around him who had at least some idea of what he'd been through. Then again, considering how Tony was behaving towards him, he suspected Tony didn't really want him there, and had only included Steve in the blanket invitation because it would've been odd to exclude one person. He didn't know what it was that he'd done to offend Tony, but he didn't want to make Tony more uncomfortable. Living in the same building with him could get really awkward.
"They know you're a threat, too," Steve said. He reciprocated Tony's gesture by placing his hand on Tony's hip. "Whatever you do, you'll have to be careful. They'll be constantly looking for any opportunity to get rid of you."
Steve felt a slight pang of guilt—no doubt, Tony was referring to Cap. If only he knew those two were one and the same. He took a gulp of beer, just to have a moment to push back that guilt and go for a flirty look that wasn't quite genuine. "Should I worry about having competition?"
At the other end of the lounge, seated on one of several chaise longues, was a woman Steve hadn't met before. Her businesslike clothing and hairdo reminded him of the half remembered interrogation, though her hair was strawberry blonde instead of dark. Not that it had to mean anything. If that scene had taken place soon after his frame-death, his interrogator could've swapped frames a dozen times by now.
"Rhodey. I remember," Steve said, stunned. He'd seen the man in pictures more often than in person, but he knew Tony and Rhodey had studied together. It was no wonder Steve hadn't recognized him at first; he looked much older now, perhaps in his fifties. It couldn't be the same body he'd had back in the past, but it might be that he'd only switched clones once.
"Screw you," Steve snapped.
After a horrifying half-second of free fall, they smacked into something hard.
Talking about it brought up the memories once again, the heat of the flames, Tony's howl of pain when he'd been hit, the blood on his coveralls. Steve wondered if Pepper would've felt as optimistic as she did if she'd seen it herself.
"How is it possible that we're not seeing him? He's got to be
"All right. For you to understand the whole story, I need to give you some background into a trip to Venice. It wasn't an expedition as such, not like my usual fare. I was there to do research, because I had heard of these ancient manuscripts on a monastery island. It was there that I first met Natasha..."
He'd talked about this at length with Maya. She had insisted that they omit any mention of the Fountain, but Steve had pointed out that even if the people reading the account would believe it, which they probably wouldn't, no one would know the actual location of the temple except for the surviving members of the two expedition teams. The secret would remain safe as long as they kept the information to themselves. Tony's team certainly would, and Maya was convinced none of the thugs who'd been on her team would be able to retrace their steps, so they should be fine on that front, as well.
"I left him tied up in that tiny cleaning closet upstairs," Steve says, with a nod towards the stairs. "I was going to use his own device on him, but since I couldn't find out how dangerous that'd be, this was my plan B."
Stane dropped what he'd been holding and pulled away from Steve, eyes wide. "What? I'm under SHIELD protection! They can't be here!"
"Besides, let me tell you, at the risk of being an alarmist: once we leave this room and face everything that awaits us out there, things won't feel too perfect anymore," Steve added.
"Of course," Steve said.
Steve thought of the two pretty redheads. So far, he didn't know much about them, except that Pepper had seemed more sincere than Natalie, who'd given an impression of professional impersonality. "You don't trust your assistants?"
"As of one hour ago," Natasha confirmed. "I came as soon as I could. I tried to call you earlier, but you didn't pick up."
The order made, they picked up their scattered clothes, got dressed, and sat down in the living room to wait for the delivery drone, Steve on the couch, Tony in the armchair. There was a lingering feeling of tension hanging in the air between them, and Steve didn't think it was from debating dinner payment. It might've been just the unfamiliarity of the situation, but Steve didn't think it was that, either. Tony seemed nervous, in a way Steve hadn't seen before, shifting in place, staring at his toes, his fingers drumming the armrests.
The news feed disappears, and Steve blinks like surfacing from a dream, the light at his temple cycling to yellow, but not to blue. "What're you going to do?" he asks.
"Jarvis, we've talked about this. No need to rub it in," Tony said, scowling at the ceiling. "Anyway. I'd love to stay in bed all day, but I'm worried we're working against the clock, and we have an assassination to plan. If you're still in, that is." he turned his eyes towards Steve again.
Eventually, through a glowing haze of deep contentment, he surfaced in the real world again. The first thing he saw were Tony's concerned eyes locked with his, Tony's fingers patting his cheek. "Steve, hey? Steve? Talk to me," he was saying, a note of panic in his voice.
It makes no sense for Steve to be here watching out for him. Steve hates him. Steve probably never liked him very much. Tony let himself believe that they were friends, but that was just wishful thinking because he liked Steve too much.
Towards the top of the hill, the terrain grows more rocky, in places steep enough that he needs to use all his limbs to scramble upwards. He enjoys the challenge. It does cross his mind that if he happened to slip and injure himself out here, he could end up in serious trouble, but he's not overly worried. He's agile and he heals fast. He doesn't slow down.
Steve scoffed. "I used to do covert operations all the time, you know."
Steve had been convinced there couldn't possibly be anyone left alive after the fire, and yet, it seemed like there was. They must be horribly burned, in need of immediate medical attention.
"Nothing important. Just a work thing," Tony replied. It was probably because Steve actually knew that he was lying, and that it was in fact very important, that he could hear the tightness in Tony's voice, a nervous edge that he failed to hide.
"Steve, it's okay, it's just me," Tony said.
"Huh. Still the same song. I was actually wary of you, you know? Those SHIELD bigwigs thought so highly of you, I was worried thawing you would turn out to be a mistake. Instead, you're just another pathetic, emotional loser. A perfect match for him, I have to say," Stane taunted him. "I was going to kill you right away and be done with it, but maybe I'll keep you around a little longer. Let you watch him die, first."
Fury steepled his fingers, his stern expression relenting. "Well, that brings us right back to where we started."
Steve was happy to oblige. He let go of Tony's cock altogether, and settled to lie on his back. The fleecy rug was soft and comfortable under him, contrasting with the warm weight of Tony straddling his thighs. Looking up at him, Steve saw his wildly tousled hair haloed by the firelight, framing his ecstatic face.
"It's just me and a visiting celebrity here," Jarvis replied to her.
"There's got to be something we can do to narrow it down," Steve said.
Now that Tony put it like that, he understood Tony's reasoning. He'd only ever had the one face; he'd see things differently from Steve, who was used to wearing many. He simultaneously cared less about the particular frame he was in, but also held his birth body, his original face, in a special place in a different way. It wasn't so much the face that he needed to wear to feel like himself, it was the face that connected him to his past and to his family.
Tony settled down half sprawled on top of Steve, his head on Steve's shoulder, lacing his fingers with Steve's where the sticky mess of their come coated Steve's stomach. They stayed there in silence for several long minutes, content, letting their racing hearts settle. In the afterglow, all the warmth surrounding Steve was beginning to grow stifling, but the thought of moving didn't even cross his mind.
There was a dinosaurian hiss from somewhere across the room, and Tony got back to his feet and turned around just in time to see Rumlow aiming a kick between the bars of another cell. Tony didn't catch sight of the victim, just heard the thwack of Rumlow's boot connecting with something, a pained yelp, and the following thump of a body slumping to the ground.
The landscape offers no surprises; it's scenic, sure, but it stays exactly the same, hour after hour. At least the weather is equally stable. It's not as sunny as yesterday, with some clouds in the sky, but the temperature is mild enough that the cold stays at bay as long as Tony keeps moving. Unfortunately, he needs to take regular breaks to get off his feet. He can feel the inflamed skin of his soles with each step. He still has a constant background headache, too, which he thinks is mostly because he's so damn hungry.
And there it was, Steve thought: Tony had put two and two together, recognized Steve's voice and the lips and jawline he had gotten intimately familiar with, and it was all over.
"Afternoon, James," she greeted her.
Tony had tried his best to ignore his growing feelings towards Steve, because he knew those would complicate everything. He enjoyed working with Steve, and the last thing he wanted was to make things awkward. He certainly hadn't expected Steve to share those feelings. Meeting a man who shared Tony’s preferences happened once in a blue moon; for Steve to be one was inconceivable.
"We're here for Tony Stark," one of the group spoke up in a heavily accented form of the humans' lingua franca, maybe a Northern dialect Tony wasn't familiar with. Even with the hood shadowing his features, Tony could tell this particular Northerner was quite young, probably under twenty. One of his arms was bare from the shoulder down and seemed to be made of metal. "As long as he comes with us, no one else has to get hurt."
"At first I had no idea what had happened, but when we got out of the car to check the damage, we found ourselves surrounded by bandits. It was an ambush; they'd shot the tires to stop us, and now they wanted everything we had. But we were armed, and we weren't just going to surrender without a fight. We took shelter behind the Jeep, and soon found ourselves in a proper shootout. It might've continued for a long time if not for that one lucky shot. It happened during one of the times when I stood up to return fire, and it caught me right here." Tony rapped the protective metal plate close to Steve's fingers.
Bruce made an apologetic shrug. “At least, uhh, a few hours.”
Steve could ask Tapio for directions and leave, make his way to the town and then back to his team. He'd be done with all this. Tony didn't want his help, and Steve doesn't owe him a thing. And yet, even though he keeps telling himself that he shouldn't care about what Tony does, abandoning him in this cold and rainy hinterland would feel wrong.
He hadn't thought anyone could possibly hit him past all the leaves and trunks and bushes. Whoever had taken the shot must've been highly skilled.
Steve lets Tony's hand slip from his grasp. "Was that too much?" he asks timidly. "I didn't mean to overstep."
"He's just concerned," Tony said quickly.
This was the second uncanny fire within a week. The first one, which had gotten Steve assigned to this case, had been very different. It had taken place at a party in Janet van Dyne's townhouse, and had been limited to one room, although the soot and smoke had damaged property beyond that. What had marked that incident as unusual was that several witnesses had reported seeing a burning man at the heart of it. Not someone whose clothes had caught fire, but someone who was actually in flames, as if they came from within. No one knew where he'd come from or where he'd gone. The descriptions sounded all too much like a few people Steve knew; he'd worked alongside two men with such abilities in the war. That, and the fact that Captain America was well prepared to face people with special talents, were the reasons he was now playing at being a detective, trying to trace the mysterious arsonist.
They had to wait for a few minutes for Pepper to join them; she apologized profusely for it, but Tony waved it off magnanimously. "Never mind. We might as well be fashionably late. Justin can deal with it."
Tony had raised his glass to his lips to take a drink, and at Steve's words, he let out a sound that was half chuckle, half snort. For a few seconds, it seemed worryingly like he might end up choking on his beer, but then he recovered and shook his head at Steve. "You're really something, aren't you? I try not to, if I can avoid it. I'm sure you must've shattered a few in your time, though."
"Right now? Aren't you going to eat your sandwich?" Bucky raised the bag towards Steve with his free hand.
Steve, of course, announces that he wants to join the fight as soon as he learns of it. He's spent too many years witnessing his fellow androids being mistreated by humans. The only reason he's not taken the initiative himself to do anything about that is that he and Tony haven't been able to confirm if other models are capable of the same kind of awakening that Steve went through. Now, with the news stories of deviants breaking their programming, going on the run and organizing protests and marches, they have all the evidence they could ask for.
Vaguely self-conscious about the others' eyes on him, Steve followed Tony. He knew exactly the kinds of conclusions people would jump to after the two of them had emerged from the bedroom together. No one commented on it though; they simply greeted him with cheerful wishes of "good morning" and got up to join the procession.
Since Tony had the irresistible combination of persuasive skills and a fat wallet, he did manage to talk the receptionist into fetching them a bite to eat. They didn't revisit the serious conversation while they waited for it. Instead, they just went back to rolling in the hay, or more specifically, to leisurely mutual hand jobs. Luckily, the knock on the door didn't interrupt anything too intense, and it only took Tony a minute to make himself more or less presentable so he could accept the delivery. The bills he handed out in return must've been the most money ever paid for a thermos of coffee and some slightly squashed bagels.
"Then yes. Yes, please," Steve breathed. He very nearly added 'Tony' to the end of it, but just managed to bite his lip. He wasn't with Tony. Tony was still pretending to be Ed. If he blurted out Tony's name and Tony noticed, it'd be all over.
"The next thing I knew, I was on the floor, flat on my back, with Rhodey kneeling by my side. My heart was fluttering, skipping beats, and it felt as if there were a terrible crushing weight on my chest, though there was nothing on it."
"You're not Tony Stark," he said aloud.
On this particular trip, he found more excitement than he was looking for.
Tony finally turned his eyes towards her, to see that there was a smile playing on her lips. Tony scowled at her. How could she not see this for what it was?
The cliffs surrounding them blocked most of the sun. Steve looked around frantically until he spotted a gap in them where the precious rays of light painted a brighter spot on the ground. That was where he took Tony and set him down gently. Not wanting to waste any further time, he tore Tony's shirt apart with his bare hands. The sunstone had been a closely kept secret, but right now, whether anyone noticed it or not was the last thing on Steve's mind.
In a slowly building panic, it strikes him that if his memories are only partly true, perhaps he was kidnapped, but he never saw Steve or ended up in the wilderness. That thought is so disturbing that it finally compels him to force his heavy eyelids open.
Jarvis hadn't as much as implied that Tony had been away, but that didn't have to mean he was being secretive; it was equally likely he'd just thought it wasn't relevant.
Steve bashed his opponent with his shield and turned around. Everywhere around him, his teammates were surrounded, struggling against insurmountable odds. Dum Dum and Morita were down, and Steve couldn't tell how bad it was.
Steve tensed his cheek muscles to open the line and speak up to everyone. "Over to you then, Team Two."
The rest of the team take turns telling Tony he should rest. He refuses, even though the weariness makes him look ill, his face as pale as Steve's, the dark circles under his eyes almost like bruises. Once they realize there's no way they can get Tony to abandon Steve even for the shortests of naps, they take turns bringing him food and coffee instead.
Once he got back, Tony was on the floor, under the blanket, his back towards the door and the bed. He wasn't asleep, though, but propped up on one elbow, the glow of his cell phone screen giving his face a sickly bluish cast. He didn't turn to look when Steve entered. Even without any mysterious intuition, it was obvious he didn't want to talk.
Within a month, Stark Industries was the proud new owner of half a dozen small to medium biotech companies, and Tony was busy learning all he could about DNA sequencing. It was about as far as you could get from what he had expertise in, but in the end, the technology wasn't that complicated: what it came down to was a combination of chemistry, microfluidics and optics. Of course, there were also the computational challenges of what to do with the genome data once you had it, but that was basically a very large-scale string searching problem, which meant Tony understood it just fine. All in all, he could definitely come up with plenty of ways to improve the tech.
Around Tony, fires were erupting here and there, people's clothes spouting flames, a pile of timber turning into a bonfire. The heat felt overwhelming even from where Steve was standing, searing hot on the unprotected parts of his face. With it came the nauseating smell of burning building materials, fabric, and worst of all, human flesh.
"Tony! You can't just let them take you!" a firm female voice called out from behind him. It was Paola, one of the leaders of the convoy. Instead of retreating with most of the group, she had, like Tony, thought of others' security first. Her dark brown skin was smudged with dirt, no doubt from when she'd taken cover from the blast, but her expression was fierce.
They didn't have time for this. Trying to run out with drones firing from both sides would probably get them all killed. Steve considered turning over the table and using it for cover, but it was cumbersomely large, and could only offer protection from one side. It would be stupidly risky, when there was a much simpler way out of this situation.
Steve worked the entire top half of Tony's coveralls off, revealing his torso and arms in their entirety, and confirming his first impression. He ran his hands down Tony's bare front, over his chest, his ribs, his sides, and it was all entirely unblemished, as if he'd never done anything more dangerous than sit at home reading a book.
Tony finished the knot and stepped away from Steve, studying his face closely.
Steve nodded and gave the others a tight-lipped smile. "Let's do this, then. Rhodey, get that door open for us, and fast."
The dissidents had cut off all contact with the rest of the island and abandoned most of the traditions. They even had their own dialect of the language, based on the typical speech of the Northern towns. Overall, Natasha had said, most of them were ordinary people, not too different from the rest of Dinotopia. Only a small clique was pushing for active violence against dinosaurs, trying to incite the rest of their people into open conflict. Many of them were recent arrivals to the island, and whatever they had been up to in the outside world, it certainly hadn't been philanthropy.
Outside his room, the workshop was quiet, the lights low. He didn't know what time it was, but probably very early in the morning. He found the bathroom right next to his bedroom, only to realize as he was about to fill the bottle from the tap that the water might not be safe to drink down here. Adding the risk of some infection on top of all the things his frame had been through wouldn't be smart.
"Hello again," Steve says assertively, walking until he's right next to Tapio to catch his full attention. "Sorry to bother you, but I need your help. It's an emergency."
"All right, I see your point," Steve admitted.
Deputy Director Peggy Carter was the second-in-command of SHIELD, answering only to Director Phillips himself. Around ten years older than Steve, she was one of the most formidable people Steve knew, probably his equal when it came to tactical thinking, and far better than him at diplomacy. She was also dependable, just and determined. Really, she had all the qualities Steve admired. And she was beautiful. He couldn't deny that he'd fallen for her a long time ago, but he'd never done anything about it. Partly because it would be inappropriate—even though SHIELD had no strict rules against fraternization, dating his commanding officer was still bad form and could make working with her awkward—but mostly because he was afraid she'd turn him down and break his heart.
"It's neither of those," he said firmly. "I'm as real as you are, Tony. My frame is in a chair next to yours, out in the real world."
Steve really didn't feel like coffee. "Tony texted me," he went on, replying the question Sam had refrained from asking. "He thinks we're soulmates. Had it tested, too, and sent me the numbers to confirm it."
"If you think I picked that frame for you because it would be hot—" Tony began.
Ultron must have done this on purpose: let him come all the way down here just to find out that he couldn't get where he wanted to go. Steve had already gotten the impression that the AI was unpleasant, but this was downright malicious.
"Okay, sure. Yeah. Later. I'm going to go now." Tony gave him a miserable look, obviously convinced that the conversation would mean putting an end to their affair.
"Not for me, it wasn't," Steve said.
"He's barely alive as it is, I'm reading shock and severe arrhythmia," Natasha said, brow furrowing in concern. "We need a medical team, right, now, and someone with VR tech expertise!" she called out to the room around them.
Kamski casts him a dubious glance over his tea. "Surely a man of your intelligence doesn't need help for something as simple as that."
He's almost concluded that his effort was for nothing when he notices the shape at the nearer shore of a distant lake. It's so tiny that even his eyesight isn't enough to make out any details, but he thinks it could be a small cabin. Even though it's too far for him to be sure—there's still a chance it could be an oddly shaped solitary boulder—it's close enough that he thinks he should be able to reach it within a day, if he keeps up a good pace.
There were angry shouts and sounds of rustling branches and footfalls behind him as his captors came after him, but he'd gained at least a minute or two. He was fairly sure he'd move faster than them, even though having his hands tied behind his back made keeping his balance tricky.
Bucky knelt to shake Tony's hand, his expression dead serious. "I'm glad you're feeling better, and I'm sorry about everything."
"Yeah, you're off by just a few decades," Tony said. "This is the body you knew me in. The only one I've had."
"For his magazine, right," Steve said. "So, you've only seen him at the party and today, and today he seemed agitated. Was he his usual self at the party?"
"Have you heard anything from Nat yet?" Clint asked.
That was
He'd kept his enhanced frame stored away in a stasis box in case he ever needed it. In fact, he was sure he would, because some of the battles that awaited them couldn't be fought through messages, veiled threats and legalese.
"You know what it also means?" Pepper pushed on, because they didn't share a mystical connection, and obviously all she could see was Tony staring mournfully at his empty glass.
"Whoa, the amount of detail they went to is seriously impressive," Tony commented, running his fingers over the dusting of dark hair on Steve's chest. "Definitely getting to the point where you can't tell apart a synthetic fake from an organic one."
Tony slumps to his knees, hanging his head. "Fuck this. Fuck all of this. Especially you, Steve Rogers," he mutters once again.
Bucky bit his lip. There was one glaring problem with this. Five minutes would be plenty for a fit man, or dinosaur, to run to the exit, but Stark couldn't even stand. Bucky knew he couldn't realistically consider carrying Stark all the way out and who knew how much further, so that they could be sure they'd shaken off any pursuers. He glanced at the mysterious vehicle that Stark had been building. It bore a striking resemblance to the horned dinosaur currently standing next to it, and it looked quite ready.
He didn’t remember being sick or injured, although clearly something had happened, because every joint and muscle in his body was aching. It reminded him of the time before the serum, and he felt a brief flash of panic before he raised his arms off the mattress and saw that they were as muscular as he was used to. They were perfectly unblemished, too, with no bruises or bandages, and no IVs, either. Why was he here?
A part of him wanted to tell Iron Man to go away, because he didn't want the man to think less of him, but the need for friendly company and conversation won over.
Steve wasn't even sure what he hoped to find here. The FDNY and the NYPD would do a proper investigation of the site, to see if they could figure out what had started the fire, and Steve held no illusions of being better at that than the experts.
Steve wasn't going to push it, not now. "Then that's okay. You don't know everything about me, either," he pointed out. "Maybe I've got secrets, too."
Steve felt Pepper shift next to him, and her hand landed on his knee. It didn't matter that Steve knew who it belonged to, it was an instant tactile reminder of Tony and the virtual bedroom, and with it came a landslide of memories that'd up to now been kept at bay by constant action. Memories of not just violation, but of blood and pain and death. Steve flinched, trying to back away.
Coulson accompanied Steve to the landing platform and the awaiting limo. It sat there like some gold-plated, silk-lined cage. Steve had been so close to being free, and here he was, choosing to return to servitude. If not for the possibility of helping many more people than just himself and his team, he would never have done it. He still wasn't convinced that this was the right choice and that there was anything to be gained from spending more time with Tony, but he'd promised to try. At least he now had an out if he wanted it: he could contact the resistance through Coulson, and they'd be able to help him.
"That's one of the questions I wanted to ask you," Steve said. "So far, there have been three fires. He's the only person I know of who's definitely been present at two of them, and I have reason to suspect he's connected to the latest one as well. That's not solid evidence of anything, but it seems unlikely to be a coincidence."
Steve knew more than Tony believed, but it definitely wasn't enough. He would've liked to know more. "You can tell me, whatever it is. I'm not going to think the worse of you."
Beyond his window, the waking city bathed in soft morning light. Steve sighed, got up and dressed, heading for the communal kitchen. He kept the phone in his pocket, with the volume turned to the highest setting. He didn't expect Tony to reply, but if he did, he didn't want to miss it.
"So this talk about this mission—is it just some hunch? Where did that come from?" Bucky tried.
"He must've been seriously damaged to be that way. SR100 is one of the sturdiest models CyberLife has ever made," Steve declares, with a touch of pride in his voice.
"Never mind, I just thought you were worried about that," he said quickly. Tony seemed genuinely confused by the question, and if he had no clue something was going on, then Steve shouldn't have mentioned it.
The voice that called out from the hallway was unfamiliar to Steve, and female. "Tony? You awake yet?"
He backed away, then took a few running steps to gather momentum, launching himself at the wooden surface, smashing his shoulder into it with all his considerable strength.
"Steve Rogers, as I live and breathe," Tony exclaimed, and pulled Steve to a hug, patting him on the back.
"Let's go, then," Bucky said. He helped Stark to the awaiting dinosaur's back, spending a precious minute to make sure he was seated there securely and not about to pass out that instant. Then, Bucky jogged to the door to twist the heavy wheel that unlocked it.
"A flying man who was on fire!" came in the clear voice of a little girl.
Steve hadn't realized the situation was so dire. The Northerners were something most Dinotopians avoided talking about, and because of that, Sam hadn't been able to give him very much detail on the topic. Still, Steve had expected that here, close to the disputed area, the locals would know more.
That android might've been as smart as JARVIS before it was damaged and rendered inert. Tony doesn't know how it ended up in that cave. Maybe it used to be a part of some team. Maybe it had friends who cared for it like Tony does for JARVIS.
"Okay. Here's the thing," Tony said, hands clasped on his lap, palms up, twiddling his laced fingers nervously. "Everything that I said back then, that's still on the table. A relationship. A real one. Dinner dates and all. It wouldn't be easy. I may look pretty in this shiny young frame, but seriously, I'm still a mess, and I'm not sure there are enough shrinks in the world to fix that. There's a whole shitstorm waiting for me out there once I leave this room, and I know you've got your own quest to go on, your surviving teammates hiding away, and I—"
"I thought you didn't want to stay," Tony said.
Tony still looked unconvinced. "There are reasons why we've been avoiding the police like the plague. I don't even want to count how many laws our plan's going to break."
"They're breaking enough laws themselves. They put a tracker on me, off the record, for their own purposes. They also picked me up from the street just to have a chat, even though they knew who I was and that I was technically breaking my parole," Steve pointed out. "We need more people to pull this off. They could provide that, plus Natasha, a contact who's still working for Stane."
Tony had provided Steve with weaponry beforehand: he now wore a shoulder holster with a regular projectile-shooter and a top-of-the-line plasma blaster similar to the one Tony had shot himself with. Neither of them would be of much use in a battle against an army of drones.
Steve moved his arm aside to give Tony a thoughtful look, and for a beat, Tony thought that he had salvaged the moment, but that was premature. Steve let out a sigh and shook his head, refusing to meet his eyes.
As Steve might've guessed, it was Tony. He was sitting at a desk, chin resting against one hand, the other turning around a complicated holographic diagram in the air in front of him. At the sound of Steve's approach, he swiveled around in his chair to face him. "Steve. Trouble sleeping?"
"Rhodey? Please, try to keep us still," Pepper was saying.
"If that's the case, I wish he'd choose to cooperate with me instead of hiding," Steve said, unable to hide his exasperation.
He sat up. It sent the room spinning. He leaned against the couch back and closed his eyes again, focusing on his breathing. He really could've done without this right now. He had things to take care of. Of course, he had no one to blame but himself.
"I'm sure you do, Mr. Steve Working-odd-jobs, with army issue shorts," Tony said shrewdly. Steve couldn't believe Tony had even noticed that. He clearly didn't miss much.
Steve felt slightly envious of Bruce whenever he saw him and Tony together; they were usually chatting away about some advanced science or engineering topic that Steve couldn't hope to comprehend, and they seemed perfectly at ease with one another. He would've liked to have that, too.
The only people Tony tells the entire truth about what happened are Pepper, Happy and Rhodey. They welcome this new, independent, growing and changing Steve into their little circle of friends, just like they accepted him as an android addition to Tony's household. They don't even seem too surprised when they find out that Tony and Steve's relationship isn't exactly platonic.
He wasn't sure Tony would answer at all, so he was surprised when he did, almost right away.
"I'd like to be alone, now, if you don't mind," Steve said.
Tony pulled on his jacked and got out. Although they were not in a hurry today, that was no excuse to tarry. They'd better get started with the day. Whatever had or had not happened between the two of them, last night or this morning, that couldn't interfere with their work. That was the thing that Tony had always worried about the most: that if he allowed himself to become too involved with Steve emotionally, he'd struggle to keep doing missions that put both of them in harm's way.
Tony coughed again, and his next gulp of air sounded slightly cleaner.
"Eliana," Sam greeted her—the skybax riders being a small, close-knit community, all of them knew each other by name.
Tony instantly thought of a dozen protests to what everyone was saying—to Jarvis, because he was almost certain he could stand up and leap into action right now, if he needed to, and to Steve and Bucky, because he didn't like the idea of putting his friends in harm's way. Before he had time to actually give voice to his disapproval, Steve had grabbed him in a hug again, and Seren had sat down on top of his blanket-covered legs. Bucky grinned, his expression more relaxed than Tony had ever seen. Not too far behind him, Pearly-eye was giving them an amused look as well.
Steve is afraid to die.
Tony didn't react to anything that was happening, alarmingly quiet and still as Steve took him in his arms.
It turned out he was still too late.
Steve reappears, right by his side, his hands on Tony's chest, gentle and cautious. "No, no, I can't be too late," he's saying. "It's going to be okay. I'll fix this."
"They're very," Pepper started, fell silent as if looking for the right word, and finished with, "menacing, I'd say."
"Like what you see?" Tony asked.
Steve ran a hand down along Tony's arm, took hold of his fingers, and brought them to his lips to kiss his knuckles. "That's fine. I normally wouldn't even kiss on the first date."
He's so deep in thought that he almost misses the first gentle tug at the line. The next one is more insistent. Success! As carefully as he can, Tony reels in the line and pulls up his breakfast.
"He might, but if I can at least try to reduce Tony's stress levels, maybe that could buy him more time. I've got to try," Steve said, already moving around Tony's chair to sit down in the one next to its undamaged side.
"Sam," the pilot returned, giving him a tight-lipped smile. "I'm very sorry to interrupt your meal, but I was told to deliver my message to you as soon as I could." Eliana's gaze trailed over the other people around the table until it settled on Steve. "Are you Steve, the dolphinback?"
"I wouldn't," Tony repeated, his eyes wide, shaking his head.
Exactly one hour later, as requested, Steve took the private elevator back to Tony's floor, ready to start his first day of servitude. To Steve's surprise, Tony was there as well, looking sharp in a business suit. Back in the day, Tony had rarely showed up at HQ before ten, and usually he'd spent his first hour inhaling caffeine. It wasn't even nine o'clock yet. Things had definitely changed.
As if Tony hadn't read Steve's letter a hundred times, and kept staring at that flip phone, half hoping, half dreading to hear it ring—not that he'd ever admit any of that to Steve. "As it happens, I
It occurred to him that he hadn't considered all the angles when he'd sat down at a table. The waiter, a middle-aged Italian man who might well have been Lorenzo himself, dropped the menu in front of him and glared at him like he was something the cat dragged in.
"Not in my time zone," Tony said. "The thing is, it doesn't matter what I think or what anyone thinks. If there was a soulmate gene, they would've found it in that study. They didn't. I'm sure there will be a couple more papers repeating that result, eventually, but they'll just say the same thing. There isn't one. End of story."
"Sorry, Cap, no can do," Ultron singsonged.
"You can find the closest landing platform five floors down," the newly installed AI added helpfully.
"We're on our way," Rumlow answered. Nothing on their status, or how long they might take to reach the roof.
At a quarter to eleven, Steve stepped out of a cab at the clinic's public landing platform, his hair neatly combed and his clothes freshly washed, probably looking a thousand times more collected than he felt. He had only just sat down in the ridiculously opulent lobby, the chandeliers reflecting the fake sunlight filtering through vertical garden walls, when Pepper walked in from one of the corridors that led deeper into the complex.
Bucky hadn't seen Stark after they'd left him locked up in his cell. He didn't have free access to the dungeon, and making up an excuse just because he was worried didn't sound like the best of ideas. He'd rather not be seen as suspicious when he was still a newcomer.
Full of hope and excitement, Steve asked Tony to wait, and rushed out of the gym to call Dr. Foster.
"It's okay," Tony said, adjusting their emergency blanket so that it cocooned most of Steve's upper body, even his head. "There's nothing to do now but wait. You just rest. Take a nap, if you can."
He stepped away from the wall, revealing himself to her, and she waved a hand in greeting, walking until she was close enough to whisper into his ear. "I met one guard. You?"
He'd get back to Steve once he'd sorted this out. Until then, all he could do was wait.
********************
On a typical day, Tony would head home after they were done. This wasn't the kind of relationship where they spent time cuddling. Steve prefered it that way, too, because their nights together tended to coincide with missions, and he needed time alone to clear his head. If Tony left now, though, Steve would definitely not learn anything new regarding the mysterious conspiracy.
"I swear we'll fix this, Steve. It's going to be okay. I've got you, now. It's going to be okay," Tony repeats, like a mantra.
Kamski crosses his arms. "You've repurposed my technology and implanted it in your chest. I don't even want to think what Legal would say about that. I don't see how I owe you anything."
"Let me show you," Steve says. He holds out his hand, skin retracted, and slowly, almost reverently, brings it to cover the thirium reactor.
He should've told her a long time ago. He should tell her now. See how calm she'd be after that. But it was already too late.
Bucky looked at the camp around them, all the different dinosaurs and humans working together. He still thought many of the dinosaurs looked menacing, but they were quite beautiful, too, in their own way.
"I'm pretty sure I'm not all right," he told Pepper, "but it's not something that can be fixed."
"More of the long and less of the productive," Steve said, trying to keep it airy and casual.
"Not really. Only thing I can think of is the ancient culture?" Jan suggested, mirroring Jarvis's earlier words. "Tony's certainly visited plenty of Mayan ruins. Maybe even on this recent expedition. I'm sorry, I didn't catch the details of it, so I'm not sure."
"Where are we going?" Steve asked. Moving as slowly and cautiously as his battered frame allowed, Steve sat up again.
Falling asleep isn't any easier the night after Tony gets back from Detroit. On top of the usual regrets about all his past mistakes and the people he got killed and the android he murdered, Tony's also stuck second-guessing whether he made the right call, giving Kamski that promise. It was selfish, wasn't it? He's only looking into the android's identity because he's seeking to ease his conscience. Maybe he shouldn't have said anything and just kept the tech to himself for the rest of his life. Then again, he kind of owed it to Kamski to at least tell him about what happened, because it's the honest truth that CyberLife tech is the only reason Tony's still alive.
"INCS," Tony corrected, on reflex. "And just so we're clear on this, I wasn't trying to off myself." It was true. He hadn't been. Then again, Tony had to admit he'd been perfectly aware of the risks he was taking, and he hadn't really cared.
Damn, but the guy was getting under his skin. Tony felt like his blood was boiling, the anger bubbling up in his veins. It was just anger, pure and simple, wasn’t it? He definitely didn’t find Steve’s posturing a turn-on.
Tony smiled back at him, not seeming overly bothered at Steve's attention. No doubt he was as used to fame as Steve was, especially since he didn't have a secret identity. "No problem, I get that a lot," he said. "You're thinking about that Stark fellow, aren't you?"
Happy simply nodded to show his agreement.
Bucky narrowed his eyes, watching her go until she disappeared behind a corner. He then turned his attention to Tony again. "Come on. We should go before someone shows up." Aware of how weak Tony was, he crouched down next to him, offering his shoulder for support.
Steve gaped at her, taken completely at unawares.
XXXXX
Soulmates or not, all the bad blood between them wasn't going to magically vanish.
She must've taken Steve's surprised look for concern over a friend. "No, I don't, but she might be a friend of friends," Steve replied. "Is there anything else you can tell me about her? Do you know where she works?"
"Of course," Steve said, his stomach dropping at the mention of a casualty. Had Tony's pursuers finally gotten to him? Was Steve going to end up investigating a homicide instead of arson?
In comparison, Tony's grin looked easy and relaxed. "I like the sound of that. Your place, like we talked before?"
"How much do you remember about it all?" Steve asked. As soon as the words were out, he realized that it might make Tony uncomfortable, and maybe he shouldn't have gone straight for that the topic. "You don't need to talk about it if you don't feel like it, of course," he added quickly.
The worst of the conversations is the one with Obie, and not because he's dismayed by the device. It's the opposite. The moment he sees it, his eyes light up with the gleam that says he can smell profit.
"Just that I've got Captain America on the line for him."
Tony was there, across the multiverse, tugging at that precious connecting thread. Tony was still alive, and Tony loved him back—but he was still terribly far away, even if he now knew that Steve also loved him. It was relief mixed with sorrow, thinking that he couldn't hold Tony close and tell him how he felt.
"Yes," Steve replied. His mind instantly came up with the most likely reason for the gloomy looks and the fact that she was asking for him, specifically. With the realization came a cold emptiness in his chest. "Something's happened to Tony."
Tony turns his face away, trying to hide his unease. "It's complicated."
"I'm afraid you don't have access to that area," the cab replied. "Please provide an alternative destination."
"Keys?" Tony asked Bucky. He'd told him to take them from the guard.
"I thought he was under guard," Steve said.
"I would say that if he's not at Crabb Castle," Natasha pointed a finger at the name written near to the northeast corner of the island, at the foot of the cape marked as Crackshell Point, "we'll at least find someone there who knows where he is."
Less a minute since the scuffle had begun, he had both men pinned on the floor, and he was barely out of breath himself.
He'd called Toro the first thing after he'd heard of the fire at van Dyne's house, but the young man had assured Steve he knew nothing about that. Unfortunately, the Human Torch had gone missing soon after the war had ended, and Steve didn't know his whereabouts. Toro had sworn he didn't know, either, and Steve believed him. This didn't make the Torch's absence any less dubious, but Steve couldn't imagine why he'd be involved in this either. Steve knew both of them well, and would've trusted them with his life, like all the Invaders. Toro and the Torch were good men. They wouldn't go around setting random buildings on fire any more than Steve would.
By the time JARVIS has managed to extract him from the suit in the 'shop, he can barely stay on his feet. Everything aches. The floor looks inviting, but he knows how much he'd regret sleeping on it later. He staggers to the stairway and up, leaning heavily on the railing.
"A week ago," Eliana said.
"Which is why I've been keeping an eye on him," Natasha said. "Stark Interplanetary has more political influence than any other company out there. If there was any chance we could have him on our side, it could be the most important breakthrough we've had in decades."
"Any chance I could borrow your phone?" Steve tries.
"I guess you should," he says, as casually as he can, and turns to retreat to the living room, Steve in tow.
Peggy gave him a tight-lipped smile that didn't reach her eyes. "I'm glad to hear that. Still, I can't help but feel I've not done enough. I've been trying to get to the bottom of this, to understand what their goal is—whoever they are—so I could anticipate their next steps, but so far, I only have scattered pieces. I don't know what the puzzle looks like."
"So, soulmates are real, then," Steve said conversationally, the next time Director Fury showed up to check up on him.
When he gets home, he's going to spend a week in the Jacuzzi.
He closed his eyes and drifted away.
It was enough to make the fake neurons flare up properly, and to send Steve gasping. With the lingering weakness and lack of balance from the consciousness transfer, he had to grab hold of Tony's shoulder to keep his footing.
He picked it up, his hand shaking so badly he fumbled and just barely managed to keep hold of it instead of dropping it on the floor. Thankfully, there were no new messages.
Once again, he wonders how Steve is doing. Steve would probably be warm, even in this weather, with that super soldier metabolism.
He closed his eyes and maybe lost track of time for a bit, because the next thing he knew was Pepper's voice shouting "Boss," except that it wasn't Pepper, it was Friday. "Boss! Tony? Please let me call for help, your vitals are all over the place."
With the image of that smile lingering in his mind, Tony has to admit to himself that he just might actually look forward to seeing Steve again, after all.
Dented armor forgotten, he grabbed a bottle of bourbon and poured himself one, the article still open on the screens in front of him.
"He might well have been. I don't know. As I said, I'm not his chaperone. Is that all?" The glum look on Jarvis's face suggested that it had better be.
"I'm not here to arrest you." Steve kept his voice steady and non-threatening. Those words were true, as well. The time to think about repercussions would be later, when he actually understood what was going on. "Like I said, I just want answers. For starters, where's Tony Stark?"
"You don't know that," Steve says, LED cycling to red, then to yellow, where it stays, again. His processors must be burning hot enough to fry eggs on. "I've kept things from you."
"Yeah, although I don't know if I helped or made things worse," Steve said. "I asked a couple of medics about it afterwards and they didn't know either, since the whole situation was so unusual."
Peggy took a moment before going on, resting her chin on her hand, as if trying to decide how to begin. "I don't know if you've noticed, but things have been… tense, recently. There have been some changes in higher-level administration, as well as some personnel replacements in our own ranks ordered from above, and that's starting to affect our operations."
He finished toweling himself off and picked up his clothes from where he'd left them last night, partly on the floor, partly draped over the chair. Just the act of getting dressed almost felt like putting up a wall between himself and Tony, moving away from the intimacy and that feeling of honesty that had somehow been there, even if it had been layered with lies and omissions. Even though it was just a suit and not his costume, it almost felt as if he were transforming from Steve Rogers into Captain America.
As fast as he's been moving, daylight is turning to twilight when he makes it to the top. Most of the valleys are shrouded in shadows. Unsurprisingly, he can't spot any human settlements, just more hills and lakes. Then again, with these lighting conditions, he can't see very much detail. There could be a whole village hiding in plain sight, if they happened to have the lights turned off.
"I have it on good authority that it's actually a fairly popular hiking destination. Apparently, it's one of the largest wilderness reserves in Finland," Steve informs him. "And yeah, I'm serious. I think it could be a good trust-building exercise. Spend a couple of days out there and talk things through properly, for once and for all. If we get too fed up with each other and need to take a timeout, that's very easy out there."
"I've got good news and bad news," Bucky told Steve when he reached the temporary office. Although the room seemed peaceful, with the police radio currently quiet and an open book on the table in front of Bucky, he looked much more serious than yesterday.
Tony was sitting at a table in the far corner, still wearing his coveralls and flat cap. There were two glasses in front of him, one of them empty, the other with amber liquid—whiskey of some sort, probably—still left at the bottom. He clearly wasn't too drunk to stop paying attention to the room around him, since his eyes met Steve's right away, his eyebrows going up and his lips turning to one of those radiant smiles.
Looking around him as they walked ahead amidst the cliffs near the shore, Bucky found himself thinking about how different Steve's life on Dinotopia must have been to his own. The group Steve was traveling with, two men and two women, carried no weapons that Bucky could see, unlike the Northerners. All of them seemed perfectly at ease with the dinosaurs, talking with them, and occasionally helping them when the terrain got difficult, since some of them had injuries, either as a result of their captivity, or inflicted by the guards during their escape.
It takes effort, but Tony suppresses the exasperation that tries to bubble up, and doesn't groan or roll his eyes. "Pepper, take a deep breath and focus for two seconds. I'm me. I haven't been replaced by a robot."
"I'm here, now," Steve said, just as softly.
Steve straightened up again and crossed his arms. "I'd rather stand, thanks."
He couldn't take that risk.
Steve held out his hand with the chip he'd gotten from the street vendor on his palm.
"His name's Obadiah Stane," Tony said, spitting out the name like a curse.
"You won't regret it," Maya said. "See you in eleven hours."
“So I’m stuck in here with him. Terrific,” Tony complained, exaggerating his annoyance to cover how nervous the situation made him.
"He's there, in the city?" Steve checked, feeling more hopeful than he had in weeks. They hadn't come all this way for nothing. Tony was only a few miles away.
Deep down, he was still hoping that somehow, it would turn out Tony was innocent.
"Okay, then," Tony said, still looking dazed. "So, did we win?"
Eyes closed and head thrown back against the arm of the chaise longue, Tony came, the first release this clone had ever known spilling over his front.
"You said you were with him on the helicopter yesterday, didn’t you?" she asks.
He couldn't quite make himself say aloud that he was in love with Steve; that would be too much, too soon. He didn't think he even knew Steve well enough to claim that. He loved some idea of Steve. He'd had a desperate crush on Steve since the day they'd met. He wanted to learn more about Steve, wanted to get closer to him, closer than he'd ever been with anyone, because thanks to the match, it would be unlike anything else he'd ever experienced.
There was a whirring, whining noise, and a movement in one corner of the room. The source of it was half hidden behind ceiling-height shelving, but Steve could see light glinting from something silvery. He stopped in his tracks.
"So, if you had to guess where they've taken Tony—" Steve began, hoping Natasha could fill in that particularly crucial blank.
Eventually, he came up with a single clue, albeit one that was far too shaky for any conclusions. He spotted it while reviewing the security footage of the meeting, and it pointed at Pepper. It was a completely innocuous moment: Pepper patting one of Hammer's drones on the arm. Steve hadn't thought anything of it when it had happened, and Pepper had merely been following Hammer's example, but the drone she touched just happened to be the very same one that tried to shoot Tony. Steve knew that with the right delivery methods, such a brief touch might be used to sneak in a malicious piece of software. Then again, there was an equally good chance that it was just a coincidence.
For the first time, Stane had spoken Tony's name aloud. Perhaps Steve was getting under his skin, or perhaps he no longer cared. They were in a small, windowless room, its only door guarded by drones, leaving Steve seemingly at his mercy. Besides, he had said he'd already decided to kill Steve. He probably thought he might as well speak his mind.
The dingy little police station suddenly made more sense. It was a hideout, or rather, a way of hiding in plain sight. "You're the resistance?"
Oddly enough, when Steve meets the nurse at the ward, she raises her eyebrows at him. "So, you're the man he was asking about."
Tony runs his hand up and down Steve's back, beaming at him. "Good. I think that sounds good. Different, but then, so are you."
"Same here," Gabe replied.
A few stops on the subway and ten minutes of brisk walking brought him to his first target. It was easy to find: the name of the place, Lorenzo's, was written on the marquis in big red letters. It looked like a dozen other Italian restaurants Steve had visited, with nothing particularly dubious about it. Actually, the aroma of garlic that wafted to the street when someone exited was delicious, and reminded Steve of how hungry he was.
He focused on his breathing for a few seconds, on the noise of the car around them, the seat behind his back. He knew the memories weren't real, and this was. He was okay. He'd pulled through. Things would be better now.
Unsurprisingly, both Tony and Hammer protested.
Jarvis led Steve to a cozy parlor decorated with all kinds of exotic artifacts and trophies—just the sort of thing he might've expected based on Tony's background. It was all fascinating. If Tony were here, Steve imagined he'd happily tell stories about how he came across each one of them. Instead, there was only Jarvis, who took a seat in one of the armchairs, his expression disinterested. Steve followed his example.
“No need. We’re good,” Steve assured him.
So far, neither of them had felt anything out of the usual, so the odds were good the substance wasn’t dangerous, but Bruce was right: it was too early to be sure. As for deciding when that would be, they’d have to trust Bruce’s judgment. The regular quarantine protocols were categorized according to the class of hazardous substance in question, and this particular one didn’t fit any category. They weren’t even sure if it was from Earth or not. For all they knew, that B-movie monster might’ve fallen out of another dimension.
Really, deep down, Steve had already made up his mind and was just protesting for the sake of it.
"You still haven't actually told me what you did," Tony reminded him.
"I checked with Pepper, and she agreed," Steve says. His face stays emotionless, but his voice is resolute.
A third wave of Northerners had just appeared, more heavily armed than the earlier arrivals, when Pepper's voice cut through the clamor. "Something's happening! Stand away from the gates!"
Steve was starting to wonder if this case was exceptionally tricky, or if he was just very bad at this detective business.
Forty-eight hours, that was how long his genetics lab had insisted that it would take to put together his project, and only if they assigned a few people to work on it full-time. He'd told them to do that. He'd also implied that it was a confidential Avengers matter; that should make sure no one else found out what he was up to.
He could swear he heard Steve's voice saying things Steve would never, ever really say. That he missed Tony, and that he wanted to fix things between them. He can't remember seeing Steve's face when he said that, though. He must've imagined the whole thing.
Seren the
Tony poured himself a drink and held it for a moment, looking thoughtful. "There are limits to what I can do, you know," he finally said. "Knocking five years off your sentence, sure. Ten, fifteen, maybe. Half of it or more? Hardly possible. You did commit a serious crime, Steve, conspiring against SHIELD. It was this close," he held his thumb and forefinger a few millimeters apart, "that they didn't just wipe you."
"I guess it's good to know that some things don't change," he muttered to himself, watching the platform fall away behind them.
"Oh, you know. Some neural damage, a bit of organ failure. Needed spare parts, couldn't afford proper organic ones, so I had to get creative," Tony listed. He was clearly trying to keep his tone casual, but it wasn't enough to hide the hurt beneath. He turned around, making Steve pull back his hand. "Want to see?"
"Tell that to Ultron," Rhodey grumbled. "I'm doing what I can."
They'd left Jarvis behind to hold the fort at the camp, although they didn't expect any trouble there in the middle of the night. Steve and Natasha were the most skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and their part would be to climb the walls and take down any enemies patrolling the walkways on top. Rhodey, Pepper, and Sam would approach the gates to the tunnel directly and take down the guards there.
Tony took Steve to one of the chaise longues across the room, and nudged him to sit down. He didn't sit next to Steve, but on a wingback chair nearby. Steve realized it was a close approximation of their positions back in the past; he was amazed Tony would even remember that, considering how long ago it had been on his personal timeline. It was definitely sentimental, almost to the point of being too on the nose.
Although Steve had clearly overstayed his welcome, he didn't want to skip the last thing on his list. "One more thing, if that's okay: does the word 'Maya' mean anything to you?"
When he'd been younger, Tony had always been shameless, projecting the confidence that he looked good and knew it. Not unexpectedly, age and everything he'd been through had clearly made him self-conscious. He turned his back to Steve to change into a loose t-shirt for the night, and still seemed nervous when he sat down on the mattresses next to where Steve was stretched out on his back.
Tony followed close behind Steve, shut the door, and stepped right into Steve's personal space, pushing him against the wall with a solid hand on his chest. Although Tony was strong, maybe even stronger than his build would've suggested, Steve could've easily resisted him. He didn't. That would've been out of character for the situation.
"I have no idea what you're talking about! I'm Tony Stark! Whatever you've heard, that's all lies," Stane protested, spreading his arms. It might've more been convincing if he hadn't currently had an unconscious Tony and a drone-restrained Steve in VR chairs behind him.
Rhodey already knows about it, but Tony doesn't want to invite Rhodey over just to do this. Pepper's on the premises already, working upstairs, so Tony sucks it up and asks her.
He grabbed the bottle, took a big gulp, and leaned back on the couch. It'd take at least fifteen minutes to finish the matching. He'd need to be a lot more drunk than this to have the courage to check out the results.
Stark sat down on the floor in what looked like a half-controlled slump, leaning his back against the nearest wall. "You should rather be asking yourself what reasons your friends here have given you," he noted, his eyes still fixed on Bucky.
A voice from the room outside brought him out of his gloomy thoughts; a unique one with a metallic echo that he would recognize anywhere. "Cap? Are you there? Are you okay?"
Maybe if he climbed to the top of this hill, he could spot Steve, or figure out which way he needs to go.
Finally, finally he slumps into bed, still dressed in his undersuit. He can't be bothered to get in properly, but lays on top of the bedspread and pulls one edge of it over himself, mumbling "thanks and good night" at Steve.
They fell into silence again. With the tension between them dissipated, it was amicable, not awkward.
Steve didn't, but kept his eyes closed, listening intently, curious to find out what Tony would come up with this time.
"I'm not looking for a fight," Steve told the two. Strictly speaking, that was true, even if he would've welcomed more action. "I just want some answers. If I let go, are you going to behave yourselves?"
This is going to take some getting used to.
"It's—it's a lot," Tony breathed, biting his lip with an expression that seemed one part shocked, one part aroused. "Holy fuck. It's so intense. It's," he trailed off to run a hand through his hair. "It may have been a few decades, but I don't think it felt like this when I was young, either. It's like they accidentally gave me an extra layer of nerves."
Steve cupped Tony's face with both hands and bent closer to kiss him, closing his eyes and opening his mouth to offer a hint of tongue. Unlike their earlier, more chaste kiss, Tony returned it with enthusiasm, one hand grasping the hair at the back of Steve's head to pull him even closer, his tongue meeting Steve's. Steve thought he tasted different, somehow neutral, almost sterile, with a clone fresh out of a tank. Then again, he couldn't be entirely sure if the difference was in part to do with his own frame.
Steve opened the zipper all the way. That gave him a very nice view of Tony's front, the olive skin and sinewy muscles he'd only glimpsed before. There was no sign of anything like a pendant around his neck, so whatever shape the artifact was, it wasn't on a chain. Maybe it'd be in a pocket; the coveralls had several of those. Steve had felt there were things in them when he'd been pressed close against Tony, but not enough to tell what they might've been.
Steve's gut instinct was, just as Natasha had suggested, that they should all hurry ahead and try to find out as much as they could, as fast as possible, but she was probably right. The Northerners would recognize Steve as an outsider as soon as he opened his mouth, and even if he managed to question someone, he'd be lucky if he understood the answer he got.
Towards the end of their second day, the terrain began to grow more hilly, and on the third, they emerged into a proper pre-Alpine landscape. Tony knew where they were: these were the Backbone Mountains. They'd been heading northwest from where they'd met the caravan. They clearly weren't aiming for the commonly used pass further away, but were taking a more challenging route directly over the mountains. A group with large quadruped dinosaurs would struggle doing that, but a small team consisting only of humans could manage it without problems.
"Miss Potts? This is Mr. Rogers," Randall introduced. "I'll leave you two to it. If you need anything, just ask the AI. I can be here in half a minute."
If it turned out to be true, he might reconsider his plans not to move to the Tower.
That was the problem, wasn't it? He didn't like the idea at all. He didn't want his love life to be determined by some genetic anomaly. He'd hated the concept when he'd thought it was nonsense, and he hated it even more now that there were reasons to believe it might be science instead.
The chairperson, a lady from Cornucopia whose shimmering black hair contrasted her deeply lined face, frowned at Steve, but didn't scold him. "You must excuse Frederic, Steve. It's true that we don't know your friend, but I know the other people on the convoy have mentioned that he surrendered without resisting. Yes, Edwin?"
"Nothing mysterious about him, just boring," Tony said dismissively. "It's about a gig. Give you three guesses at what I do for a living," he joked, spreading his arms to show off his coveralls. On closer inspection, Steve noticed that the fabric looked like something other than the matte cotton you'd usually see; there was a faint shimmer to it. He didn't suppose Tony would expect him to pay attention to that, though.
Back in the living room, he opens the TV to see it for himself. His weapons, civilian casualties. People used as human shields. He feels sick.
"Will you help me, Steve?" Tony asked, still holding Steve's gaze, his voice soft but intense.
Steve couldn't contain himself for long enough to get a permission to speak from the lady chairing the meeting. He leaned over the table, glaring at the man. "Because there are people in this room who actually know him! He may have had his struggles, but he loves this place and its people, human and saurian alike. He'd never join some bunch of thugs who want to harm dinosaurs!"
A loud bang and a sudden lance of pain through his right shoulder cut short his hopes of an easy escape.
"Of course, there's no telling how this is going to pan out, but if it turns out this study isn't some kind of a freak coincidence, the biotech industry is going to get even hotter than it's been so far," Pepper spelled out what Tony had finally realized, too.
"I like the sound of that," Tony said, his smile returning. "So, lesson one, no hanky-panky in the costume, for now. I guess that means we have to get you undressed, huh?"
Steve reciprocated by putting his hand on Tony's shoulder. Feeling the sharp outlines of bones under the sleeve of his shirt, Steve couldn't help but think of what Tony had said earlier, that he didn't have much time left in this body. Steve had lost so many people already. Now that he'd finally found Tony, he couldn't lose him, too.
"Which is?" Steve had been wondering about that. Apparently, he could've found out if he'd just known to ask "Natalie."
"It's a little more than that, but I can't talk about it. Maybe later," Steve said apologetically.
The man held out his free hand, projecting a badge in the air above it. "Clint Barton, NYPD," he announced. "I don't care about your bar brawl. I'll forget I saw anything if you let Mr. Rogers here come with me."
He keeps pulling at the paracord until he's recovered his precious tech, and turns off the devices. The batteries should last several days if he only uses them for this, and really, there's not much else he can use them for. Well, except maybe for recording last messages, in case of the worst, but he won't need that.
Jarvis leaned back, crossing his arms. "Not really. He did sound unnerved, and that's saying something. After all the things Tony's seen, he doesn't scare easily."
"Not long enough, if you ask me. Less than an hour. You need time to recover." Jarvis's hand caught Tony's wrist, no doubt to take his pulse. "You're at our camp by the shore, not far from Crabb Castle. What do you remember?"
Bucky hadn't seen any of the big predators yet, but it'd been creepy enough camping the previous night, taking turns to defend their ground from the many smaller, nocturnal dinosaurs roaming the jungle. The sounds they'd heard and the flashes of teeth and claws that he'd seen had been enough to make his hair stand on end. He wasn't used to being around dangerous animals, and even less so when it came to prehistoric monsters.
"No one special, then?" she pressed on.
"Clearly," Tony repeated. He'd taken off his cap and grabbed a handful of his hair. "I—I guess I would've done that, but—if that's the truth, then why lie to them?" He waved the cap in the Kingpin's general direction. "Why make up this story about an artifact?"
Jan's townhouse was close enough to Tony's that one could've covered the distance on foot, but since it was currently undergoing cleanup and repairs after the fire, she'd taken refuge in a suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Not quite as near, but still, only a couple of miles, and the traffic wasn't bad. On his bike, it took Steve just under ten minutes.
Pepper and Happy didn't question his words, but got up and followed Steve as he headed towards the elevator that'd take them back to the floor where they'd parked the car.
She clambered up to the pier and stayed on the ground on all fours, water dripping from her soaked clothes. "I have no idea where you appeared from, but thank you, Captain," she said between chattering teeth.
Steve had asked, only half joking, if he could also learn to ride a skybax. Sam had told him, also in a light tone, that training usually began at a young age, but that exceptions had sometimes been made for exceptional individuals, which Steve certainly was.
Tony's expression grew steely again. "I've got a plan for it, yes. It involves Jarvis and a virus. I'm pretty sure we can do it. I kind of wanted to do one more recon run, which would've been the shootout at the 201, but, well, that went as it did."
“I do know what I’m doing, and it won’t take long. Come on.” Steve squeezed Tony’s shoulder and nodded to the side. “Unless you’d rather go back to lying on your back, midfloor?”
"Then you couldn't have known. Just like you couldn't know that the Northerners weren't telling you the truth," Steve said resolutely. "I don't blame you for anything."
He typed the one line he'd need to start the quick matching pipeline, making sure he'd set all the parameters correctly. It didn't look particularly impressive.
He didn't want to think of that other person at all, but he needed to know. "Who is he, then?"
"I know we can't just forget everything that's happened, but I really hope that we can still forgive each other, somehow. If we both want that, maybe we can start building something new. Learn to get along better, so that things never get this bad again. If we hadn't always kept each other at arm's length—I used to think we could've been great together. Complemented each other. Maybe we still could."
The tension lingers in the air between them for a moment longer, until Kamski seems to make up his mind. "Well, fine," he relents. "But only because I've always liked you, Tony." He motions at the armchairs. "Let's try this again from the top, shall we? Take a seat. Can I get you anything? Chai? Coffee? Caffeine still okay for you?"
"I haven't, but my brother was, before he died in a skirmish. Those monsters killed him," she said, her voice wavering. "They're exactly as evil as you've heard, and worse."
He couldn't yet wrap his mind around everything that had happened during the past few days, on his subjective timeline. He'd thought he'd lost everything when he'd died on that rooftop, and yet, somehow, even though he wasn't dead, things were even worse than he'd expected.
"Wasn't easy," Rhodes said. "For someone who supposedly doesn't give a damn about you, Tony sure keeps a close eye on that phone you sent him."
"Tony's more resourceful than most. He's coming back," Steve said. "One way or the other."
Of course, the one person Bucky wondered about the most was Tony Stark. Tony had described Steve to Bucky as "someone very dear to him", and after seeing Steve's despair when he'd feared Tony was dead, and the tender way he'd cared for him, it was obvious Steve felt the same way. Bucky hadn't seen Steve like this before. Steve could be gentle when dealing with civilians, but this was something else. Something deeper.
"Thanks," Steve said, wrapping his fingers around the cold glass, trying to draw some semblance of calm from it. This encounter was so completely unexpected that it was throwing him for a loop.
"Tell me, Tony. The things you said to me, the night before I died—did you really mean all of it?" Steve asked, on a whim.
No matter what Fury had said, Steve couldn't shake the concern that Hydra would try to make a move and attempt to murder Tony in his sleep to avoid dealing with the inconvenience of his return. It'd be all too easy—practically the flick of a switch. So Steve kept watch, scrutinizing every staff member that visited the room to be sure they weren't up to anything nefarious. Technically, there were supposed to be visiting hours, but the staff quickly accepted his combined role as bodyguard and next of kin, probably thanks to Fury. Steve turned away a few employees that he found suspicious, and some of them didn't end up coming back. He never found out whether he'd prevented murder attempts or just intimidated some poor nurses only trying to do their job.
Tony, oblivious to Steve's introspection, whooped with joy as they dove, making sharp turns to avoid less adventurous drivers. In spite of all their differences, there were some things the two of them shared, like loving the adrenaline rush of taking risks.
"So, you really haven't realized what I've got in my chest, yet?" Tony asks, pushing back his shoulders so that the halves of his sliced tank top fall to the sides, leaving the thirium reactor in full view. "Didn't spot the serial number when you picked up the device?"
By Bucky's reckoning, they were getting close to the first of the river crossings when Mona, at the head of the procession, stopped and raised a hand to signal that they should stop.
Steve met him in a spacious open living room with transparent walls that gave a direct view over the landing platform. Tony clearly hadn't wanted to look like he was twenty for the rest of his life: his current clone seemed closer to forty. He'd grown a beard and a mustache and cut his hair differently. Still, in spite of the changes, Steve would've recognized him anywhere. His eyes had not changed. They were just as huge and dark as he remembered.
There was a sudden loud crack, and the car rocked around them. They'd taken a hit. As if they'd needed a reminder of how urgent the situation was.
"Is it okay if I'm here?" Tony asked, sounding timid in a way that reminded Steve of their last night together at Steve's apartment, all those decades ago. He'd stayed in the background, behind Rhodey and Pepper, leaning on the doorframe.
"You don't think he'd try to—" The words 'kill himself' were on the tip of Steve's tongue, but he couldn't make himself say them.
Sam set his mug on the table and crossed his arms. "But you've known him since you woke up from the ice. This isn't something that just happens to people overnight. If you never suspected anything…"
He ate, although he had no appetite, and spent some time working out, just to distract himself. He was stuck between guilt and worry; as much as he regretted his failure of moral integrity, he also didn't want anything bad to happen to Tony.
He didn't like any of it. It was too extravagant, and much too roomy for one person. He couldn't imagine ever considering a place like this his home, but for now he was stuck living in it. At least it meant he had all the peace and quiet he could wish for, and no need to leave for groceries or necessities.
"I had many bad days when I just wanted it to end, but I never stopped thinking about ways to fix it. I'd already survived so many things. There had to be something I could try, I thought. I read what medical literature I got my hands on, and finally, came up with the idea that since my heart was failing to pump as it should, maybe I could build a device to do that job instead. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without Jarvis and Jim. At first, they were skeptical, and probably humored me only because it gave me something to do, but slowly, they came to see that it might actually be plausible. Together, we built a prototype.
********************
Tony wasn't wearing anything under his coveralls. No union suit, like Steve could've expected, not even an undershirt. It was just like in Steve's dream, which felt like ages ago, but had actually been last night.
He grabbed hold of the seat cushion and yanked. It came off without too much force, revealing a compartment with the pack beneath. Almost too easy. Grinning victoriously, he pried it out of its niche. It was about a quarter of the size that he was used to, but since it was an emergency device, its design would have to be foolproof. Sure enough, there was a bright orange pull cord marked "activate" on one shoulder strap.
Tony should be the one soothing Steve; Steve's the person trying to deal with newly discovered emotions he's not equipped to handle, thinking he's somehow broken when he really isn't. And Tony certainly doesn't deserve his sympathy.
After his years of sleeping around, Tony thought he'd experienced just about everything there was for a human being to do for pleasure. With Steve, he gets to go on a whole new journey of discovery. Steve is very quick to learn how to get Tony off, which makes it unfair that it takes Tony much longer to figure out what Steve likes. Of course, Steve doesn't know that himself, so the only solution is a lot of experimenting. It's a challenge Tony accepts gladly and dedicates plenty of time to. They decide against downloading any new software for Steve; instead, he ends up severing all his connections to CyberLife's servers, for fear of them noticing how he's changed. They do order some new hardware for him, though. Several times, because why settle for one set of privates, when you can swap them to suit your mood?
"We've successfully converted his mind into digital form, with minimal loss of memories. The next thing will be to find out what frame he'd like to be placed in," she told them.
"I have some ideas," Iron Man said. "If you're interested."
"Of course not! I'm not going to beat a confession out of you!" Steve exclaimed, appalled that Tony would think that of him. "Look, Mr. Stark. Tony. The only reason I'm here is that I've spent a lot of time investigating this case. All I want is to learn the truth. I think I've got most of it figured out already, from what Dr. Hansen told me, but I'd prefer hearing your own account about your part in the events."
"Rogers? What the hell are you doing here?" Tony growls, shrugging off the gauzy fabric he's cocooned in and pushing himself up to a seated position on the grass he's been resting on.
He wondered how long it'd take for him to stop thinking about Tony.
"Go, go, go!" he urged.
"What's so funny?" Seren asked him.
Steve stands up and puts his arm around Tony's back. "It's not like that. I'm here for you."
"But he's not a household model," Tony protests.
Rhodey shakes Steve's hand, then casts a glance at Tony. Tony shrugs back at him. Steve definitely seems to have more of an attitude than he would have expected from CyberLife's creations.
He had to stall. Just a little longer.
For a while, they sat there, holding on to one another in a silence disturbed only by the background hum of the simulated ventilation of their virtual space station. A huge cargo ship made its way across the view in front of them, lugging nonexistent cargo through an illusion of space.
Chloe, might not be the same one—walks in, holding a tray with two steaming cups. "Your usual, and a black coffee for Mr. Stark," she says politely, and sets the tray on the table between them.
Steve briefly considers CPR, but the irrefutable truth is, there would be no point. Even if Tony wasn't too far gone—which he clearly is—and Steve managed to keep up his breathing and circulation for a while, that wouldn't serve any purpose when there are no medics around to provide more advanced care. Most of all, Tony would need warmth, as soon as possible, which would mean moving him, and Steve can't resuscitate him and carry him at the same time.
The list of mob haunts Steve had gotten from the policeman included four different bars, clubs, or restaurants, all of them located in South Brooklyn, within walking distance of one another. Visiting them all in one night should be doable. More than that, they were close enough to Steve's Lower East Side apartment that he could do the whole excursion on foot.
"Fine. I didn't expect this to be easy," the Mayor said, returning his unyielding expression in kind. "Take him back to his cell. Perhaps a few days in there will help him reconsider his choices."
Overall, he hadn't felt like he usually did when he was around Tony. The more he focused on it, the more conspicuous it was that he'd only felt regret that he was saying no to Tony's offer and sadness about missing out on spending more time with his fellow Avengers. That inexplicable, anxious urge to get out of the situation hadn't been there at all.
Tony swallows, but that does nothing to the tightness at his throat.
Staring at Steve's retreating back, the full picture of the situation finally starts to sink in for Tony. Beyond Steve, the round shapes of hills stretch out all the way to the horizon, and Tony can't spot as much as a single radio mast. He has no idea where he is, and he's just pushed away the only person sharing this predicament. Probably not the smartest move.
In the momentary distraction of worry for his team, Steve had let his guard slip enough that the knife-wielding enemy managed to get through, slicing into his bicep. Steve barely felt it. He responded with a kick that made his attacker stumble back. The second fighter was right there, though, giving him no chance to catch his breath, launching into a rapid series of punches. It was fast, but predictable, and Steve blocked each one without trouble.
He took a shaky gasp and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand.
"You didn't actually mean to do any of those things," Steve insisted.
"There are advantages to you having that biocomponent," Steve replies, in place of a proper technical explanation. "If you were an android, I could link with your mind and share my experience in full detail, but this is the next best thing."
that followed was so tangible, Steve could've sworn Tony had spoken those exact words aloud, even though his lips hadn't moved.
"No, that's me being cautious," Maya said. "Will you be there, or not?"
“That was the slime. It had inhibition-lowering and libido-enhancing properties,” Steve quoted, offering the tablet with Bruce’s results to Tony.
"Do you mean the junction of 168th Street and Broadway?" the cab checked.
"No driving below the fiftieth, or the altitude of two hundred meters in cases of non-standard floor height. And don't bother trying to switch off autopilot. That won't change it," the AI informed him.
He scans the thirium that he obtained from the android. It should have identifying information. Instead, it comes up entirely blank aside from a generic batch identifier, similar to what's in the fresh stock Tony ordered. He can trace that ID, but all it tells him is that the specific batch of blue blood was manufactured around a year ago, in mid-2027.
Tony sighed, nuzzling his cheek against Steve's shoulder. "It's stupid."
"Stark!" Bucky exclaimed, abandoning the guard to crouch in front of Tony. "You gave me quite the scare! I wasn't sure you'd wake up again."
He hadn't actually lived on the streets; he'd been luckier than that. His mother's apartment had been a dozen floors up, a much better situation to be in. But with a high rent to pay, they hadn't been able to afford the indoor playgrounds and parks on the higher levels, let alone preschool, so down and out in the open had been where Steve, Bucky, and his other childhood friends had spent their time.
"Lina Crabb. You may call me the Mayor," she introduced herself.
"Wouldn't dream of it. You want to come in my mouth, too?" Steve asked. He felt a little self-conscious saying it, but managed not to sound timid.
"For the record, I don't think of you as expendable," Tony says. He means it, too, even if it makes him feel like a complete hypocrite.
"Oh well, never hurts to try. A hundred, because for a high-level guy, you've got very soulful eyes. If it's SHIELD that's after you, you won't have a lot of time to spend the money anyway," she said ominously.
"How about this Jan he's visiting, then? That wouldn't happen to be one Janet van Dyne, would it?" Steve pressed on.
Tony made a sound somewhere between a chuckle and a snort, shaking his head at Steve. He didn't actually look amused. "Eventually." He sat upright in his chair and pointed a thumb at himself. "How old do you think this frame is?"
"Yes, and still on the same project, though she's been promoted," Friday confirmed.
"Now, I don't really trust the local police these days, and I'd rather not involve SHIELD in this. Ultron's smart, but he's not the best with people, especially with that pesky law that forbids me from putting him in a fake," Tony went on.
Steve considered the inside of the cabin around him. It didn't look that different from what he was used to. Really, it was almost surprising how little things had changed in the best part of a century.
"No one would know it refers to you anyway, Mr. Super Secret Agent." Tony grabbed Steve's hand and started pulling him towards the door to the elevators.
"I got that impression." Tony made a tentative stroke, his fingers deliciously tight against Steve's sensitive skin, pulling another gasp out of him.
"Probably better than some cheap hired muscle off the streets, boss," Happy cut in. He'd spent most of the conversation standing quietly to the side, so that Steve had nearly forgotten he was there.
Cornucopia was a picturesque town of small, rustic houses, surrounded by the plentiful fields and orchards that gave it its name. Jarvis had reserved an entire floor of a guesthouse for the group, which they would pay for by helping in various tasks; Jarvis's skills as a mechanic were particularly sought-after. Rhodey was already there as well, but to Steve's surprise, none of Tony's dinosaur friends were anywhere to be seen.
He doesn't stay to listen to Steve's protests after that. He's got a job to do.
"Better?" Steve asked him, lazily caressing his belly.
"Huh?" Steve thought it'd been quite obvious. "Well, I came?" he said anyway. It sounded dumb, not to mention a poorly inadequate description for what he'd felt.
There were hands on his shoulders, small but as insistent as the voice, trying to pull him up.
Steve would have to be careful about how he returned to the Tower, to make it look like nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Natasha and Barton saw him to the lower levels of the other police station, where he met Detective Coulson again.
"I couldn't. He was inactive. He'd been damaged," Tony explains.
There were no words, at first. Steve sat down on the ground next to Tony and put his arms around him. Tony trailed his hand up Steve's back to his hair and pulled him into a kiss so intense, it left him woozy. He still didn't want to let go. Saying that he'd needed this more than he'd needed air would've been a romantic exaggeration, but it also wouldn't have been too far from the truth.
The warning gave Steve just enough time to knock down the man he'd been fighting and turn towards the gates before all hell broke loose.
The thought of standing in front of Steve and not sharing any of Steve's feelings did nothing to help with the tears. He felt like he wasn't breathing quite right, but he was pretty sure that was just emotions, not some kind of side effect. God. He was pathetic.
What he didn't like about this plan was that he wouldn't be able to take the dinosaur prisoners with him, but he intended to leave the castle in such a chaos that the others could use that to slip away. He still had many details left to figure out, though, including how he was going to get the saurian prisoners out of their cells and free of their shackles. It was something he spent a lot of time thinking about while he worked on his building project.
Something jabbed Steve in the back, and the world exploded into agony. He was falling too.
"Fine!" Tony said.
The only explanation he could think of for what had happened between them was that creature. That slime must’ve messed with Tony’s head, and Steve had taken advantage of it. It was as if he’d forced himself on Tony. God. Oh God. How could he?
Of course, Steve had never been a man who preferred the easiest way.
In the workshop, they ended up facing a welcoming committee gathered around Tony's desk. Just as Jarvis had told them, there were three people present: Rhodey, Pepper, and a man in a heavily built organic frame who must be Mr. Hogan. Steve realized he'd seen the face before, in Ultron's files, back when he'd started looking into who'd murdered Tony, or rather, Stane. This was Happy Hogan, the ex-chief of security who'd been on Stane's shortlist of potential suspects. Apparently, he had belonged there, too.
The echo of approaching footsteps drew their attention away from the dinosaur and back to the door, still partly open, to see the Mayor enter the Vault. She eyed Stark appraisingly. "Mr. Stark. You look just as handsome as the pictures we had of you," she said—not in English, but in the common tongue that was her first language. Clearly, the courtesy of speaking a foreign one was only reserved to those she held in high regard.
Steve wouldn't have admitted it to anyone, but he was unnerved by the very idea of VR after his last two experiences. He wondered if the technician noticed how his hands were shaking and how he was struggling to keep his breathing in check when he settled into one of the visitor VR suites.
The first combatant Steve reached looked identical to the rest: dressed in featureless fatigues, a mask covering most of the face. Steve caught a glimpse of dark eyes with long lashes and heavy eyebrows before the person in question pulled out two knives and slashed at him. The movement was so quick that Steve was barely able to dodge, even with his post-human reflexes. He struck back as fast as he could, his trademark shield aimed at his opponent's midriff, but he was too slow, missing by a good half a meter.
"Thank you," Steve said, hoping it sounded more steady than he felt. "Take care of yourself, Mr. Stark."
He'd tried everything he possibly could, except for talking. There was nothing else left. He'd tried not to think about Steve, he'd tried to hide from Steve, he'd tried to cut Steve out of his very cells. None of it had worked.
"Okay." Steve reaches out with his hand, holding out two fingers. His skin retracts to reveal the bare white surface of his chassis as he presses them against the identical material at the center of the reactor.
"It helps that you're here, so that whatever happens, I won't have to face it on my own," Tony said. He was truly sorry that she'd have to witness his last breaths, because he knew the memory wouldn't be an easy one to live with. He didn't mention it aloud. The reminder wouldn't make her any happier.
Steve had never been very good at doing nothing.
Steve tried to twist his head and to squirm away from Tony, but Tony moved over to straddle his thighs. Somehow, his weight was overpowering, pinning Steve down as effectively as a set of restraints. One of Tony's hands pushed him down by the shoulder, and the other went to his throat, closing around it, not quite tight enough to choke him. Not yet, though the promise was clearly there.
"I'll look forward to that," Steve said.
"Then who could've—" Tony fell silent, the look on his face turning to open shock, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open. "Steve?"
"So, on the plus side, the armor upgrade is awesome." Tony rubbed at the micro-repeater implant on one forearm. Unlike the arc reactor, which was a constant background ache even on a good day, he could barely feel the chips that allowed him to link with Mark 42. "On the downside," he went on, "a lot of good people paid a high price for me being an asshole. Overall? A spectacular clusterfuck, even by my standards."
He kept glancing at the front and back doors in turn, hoping against hope that Tony might step into the room. He didn't. Steve couldn't help but feel a little concerned. For all he knew, Tony could be in a world of trouble right now. Then again, he'd left willingly. He might've just as well gone to meet with accomplices. Steve couldn't keep thinking the best of Tony just because he was charming and seemed to enjoy Steve's company.
"You can't prove I've done anything wrong," the man said.
After he'd spent the morning fruitlessly combing through the ruins, he contacted Pepper, and asked if she could arrange a meeting, because he had bad news. A few hours later, they gathered at Tony's townhouse: Pepper, Jarvis and James Rhodes, a black man in a uniform with a colonel's insignia. Steve couldn't tell if Rhodes was serious and quiet by nature, or if it was the occasion. He didn't smile once, but neither did anyone else.
Tony held on to Steve’s hands, incredibly relieved. “You okay? I was starting to get worried.”
Tony raised his left hand to cover his mouth in a pensive gesture, the fingers of his right tapping against the table. "Huh," he said again. "Didn't see that coming. That's going to make things interesting."
"Thank you, ma'am," Steve said, stood up, and walked out of the room, his mind racing.
They got out of the car. Standing up felt like Steve's frame weighed a ton, and after a few wobbly steps, he had to accept Rhodey's offer of a shoulder to lean on.
He'd been through a similar experience before. He knew what a living hell virtual torture could be. In frame space, you could only kill someone once, and then you'd need to put them in a new body if you wanted another round. That was inconvenient, expensive, and required trained staff. In virtual reality, you wouldn't have to deal with any of the practical issues; you could just restart the scenario after your victim died. It felt exactly as real, every bit as painful, and it could go on and on and on for days in the victim's personal experience while mere hours passed in the outside world.
"It stood on a stone pedestal adorned with intricate carvings," Tony went on. "A shimmering dark red stone, like a giant ruby, polished to a perfect sphere. I should have known better, after all the traps, I really should've, but my success had made me complacent. I reached out for the stone. The second my fingers made contact, there was a bright flash of light, and a jolt of electric pain ran down my arm.
"Right, that makes sense," Steve said with a nod. He then got up from the couch. Time to move on; he had several other places to visit today. "Thank you very much for contacting me, Miss Potts. If you can think of anything else, don't hesitate to call me again."
"Stumbled and caught it on something. It's nothing," Steve lied quickly.
The medical monitors bleeped, and Bruce let out a snort of a chuckle. Of course they’d be setting off alarms for raised vitals when they were getting all hot and bothered. He turned to the display, finger going to the button to silence the alarm, then froze as he saw the numbers.
It would've been a good start, if they'd been in the early days. They weren't. "So, in the eighty-five years since the takeover…" Steve began.
Tony was right; as a flip side to his overly sensitive new frame, anything penetrative would be awkward at best, extremely uncomfortable for him at worst. Luckily, there were plenty of other things they could do. "You could suck me off, if you feel like it," Steve suggested, trying to make it sound casual.
He contemplated Tony’s shirt. Since this had been a planned mission, not some quick emergency takeoff, it was a long-sleeved t-shirt designed to be worn under the Iron Man armor. That also meant it was quite tight, and undressing it with Tony’s current injuries would be painful.
He'd definitely drunk too much. It still hadn't been enough. He still remembered the test result. The one he'd known he'd get since he'd met Steve.
Thinking rationally, the best explanation for everything is that he partied too hard in Oslo, and is currently sleeping it off in his hotel room, but as he grows more aware of his surroundings, he picks up details beyond the pleasant fuzziness that don't fit this hypothesis. Details like the unnerving tug of things clinging to his skin, even piercing it in a few places, that suggest he's either in a hospital, or deep in trouble.
"Oh, I'm much too busy for that, don't worry. Thank you for your time," Steve said, as politely as he could. "I can show myself out."
"Who's this?" he asked sharply.
"Thanks, but your pep talk is going to be totally wasted on me," Tony scoffed.
Steve is
His mind keeps wandering to Tony. Is he trying to sleep as well? Has he found shelter? Has he found food, or is he as hungry as Steve is?
The morning's meeting was long and tedious, particularly since the objective was to go through the results of the investigations concerning the earlier fires. Steve found it very difficult to pretend to be interested in the details of each fire's exact starting point or how the flames had spread, when he was about to go meet the person responsible for them—which of course he couldn't mention, because he'd chosen not to divulge Tony's identity.
The only thing he had his mind set on was that whether or not Tony believed him, he was going to stick to the truth.
"Don't even think about it," Ultron's sing-song voice echoed through the empty landing. "Try to force the door and I'll have my drones pick you up. You're not going below this floor, period, the end. Oh, and you might want to head back up soon. Curfew starts in fifteen minutes. If you're caught breaking the law while on parole, well, that wouldn't be good now would it?"
"We'll fix this, though," Sam says. He feels like maybe he should put a supporting hand on Tony's shoulder, but he's not sure if Tony would appreciate that, so he doesn't. "We'll put this right. We're Avengers, that's what we do."
"So, we both had secrets, we admitted it, and accepted it. No harm was done. It's all settled now, in my book." Steve stepped closer, prompting Tony spread his legs so he could stand between them.
“And how long is that going to take?” Steve asked Bruce gruffly.
Steve struggled to keep his expression under control, to hide how much this unnerved him. "They won't be any more successful."
"Mm-hmm," Steve hummed sleepily. "So what really happened?"
Steve shook his head. "Seven out of ten couples. Is that supposed to be convincing?"
"Of course you didn't. Now you do." Tony smoothed down his shirts, covering himself. "The point I'm making here is, this frame doesn't have a lot of mileage left. A few years, at most, if I'm very lucky. There's only so much damage and stress an aging organic body with a jury-rigged heart can handle. If I take Stane down soon, there's a chance I'll be able to do some good, fix some of my mistakes, and put up a fight against Hydra. If I fail, well, I'll die, and no one will ever know that the asshole running SI isn't me."
"That bad, eh? Can't you just tell me?" Tony asked, intrigued. If it was something really bad, involving death and destruction and the like, Rhodey would've told him right away instead of being all coy about it. Tony had no clue what this might be about.
"If you're sure we can move him," Steve said softly, running his fingers up and down Tony's arm where he rested on Steve's lap.
"Okay, if we don't want to share, you can take the bed," Steve offered.
"Yes. The tracker's offline for good, and Jarvis says your node is unharmed," Pepper told him. She was smiling, though aside from that, her face looked pinched with concern. "How do you feel?"
"Steve? Are you with me?" Pepper's hand returned, a featherlight touch on his forearm.
"All those years trapped with Obie, I kept thinking about you," Tony murmured. "Sometimes I imagined you there with me, telling me to keep going. And I thought, if I ever got out, I'd get you out, too."
"Keep heading directly to the north," Natasha instructed them. "You'll reach the shore in around an hour. There are plenty of good places to set up camp amidst the cliffs, just try to pick one that doesn't look too frequently used so you don't risk running into locals having a picnic."
Steve patted Bucky on the back, a fond look in his eyes. "I don't think he needed to learn that from anyone."
The sunstones were the single most powerful piece of technology Tony had found on the island. If the Northerners got their hands on this one and realized what it could do, they'd go on the hunt for more, and then they'd soon be building all kinds of things that the peaceful Dinotopians would be defenseless against: guns and tanks, maybe even planes or submarines. He couldn't let that happen, no matter what.
He wasn't ready to face Steve, to deal with all of his anger and disgust and disappointment. He didn't think he'd ever be. He'd have to, though, sooner or later; he couldn't avoid Steve for the rest of his life. Not unless it ended up being even shorter than he expected. What he needed was a permanent solution that was slightly less lethal.
Tony turned around to rest his cheek on Steve's shoulder. "I love you, Steve," he murmured into Steve's neck. He hadn't said it before, but this felt like the time to do it.
"You bet," Tony said. "I could name it after you. Call it a Cap-Cycle."
Dear heavens—how bad was it going to be? Steve forced himself to take a deep breath as he waited to hear it, trying to prepare for the worst.
"Good evening," Steve greeted her, offering her a smile. Purposeful manipulation wasn't something he liked doing, but if a few friendly words made it easier to get the information he needed, he wasn't past using that to his advantage.
Getting out of the Vault had taken them a while. They couldn't have many minutes left.
Pepper huffed, shaking her head. "I'm going to give him a call to remind him, and get to work anyway. I'll be in the study." She headed off in quick, sharp steps.
Steve unclenched his hands, leaving the fabric at Tony's shoulders bunched up, and cupped Tony's face with one hand, running his thumb over his beard. He couldn't spot a single stain in it. Tony had caught every last droplet in his mouth.
"I didn't think she would, but I didn't expect her to ally herself with the mob, either, nor to lie to them multiple times," Tony said. "But no, I don't think she did, not really. What she's saying makes more sense. I can imagine myself in that scenario, going for the last resort when there's nothing else left."
"Nothing to worry about. I'll see you again soon," Tony responded quickly, keeping the words as casual as he could.
That had to be it, Steve thought. "Do you know something about my mission tomorrow?"
Steve was all too familiar with those villains, but so far, he hadn't seen anything to suggest they might be playing a part here. "Do you have any particular reason to suspect Hydra involvement in the current events?"
He was absolutely not paid enough to deal with this shit.
He picked up the painkillers he'd been handed earlier, and realized he didn't even know how to take them. Yet another detail about the future he hadn't caught up on yet. They were some kind of thin strips, wrapped in paper.
Steve slid his hands up to the waistline of Tony's jeans. "Then let me take your mind off all of that."
That could be interpreted in a couple of different ways, but really, Steve was practically asking Tony if he'd looked for a match. He could've laughed. If he'd needed further proof Steve didn't suspect a thing about the two of them, it was right there.
"Huh. I seem to be popular today. You're the second person who's been looking for me," Tony noted. "And I think there might be a few more out there."
Steve woke up with a start to a telephone ringing.
"Let's all take a deep breath and back away from each other, nice and slow," the newcomer announced, his hand resting on the butt of a blaster at his belt. He was a short man with sandy-brown hair, dressed in black fatigues, and there was a slight smile on his lips, as if he found all this very funny.
The memory of Steve's smiling face above Tony's took over his thoughts again. The smile quickly shifted to a thoughtful look, like it had, and with that came the wave of regret which Tony had felt but which definitely hadn't been his own. The very idea, the joke that Steve might've kissed him, had filled Steve's mind with nothing but remorse.
He realized Steve must also be catching some of his feelings, but this wasn't like telepathy. Steve wouldn't know what he was thinking. He supposed what Steve could catch would be just as confusing as what Tony was getting from Steve.
Steve had sworn he wouldn't leave without Tony, and now Tony was getting further away from him by the second. The general mayhem made this the perfect moment to retreat.
"Of course not!" Alban exclaimed, clearly affronted. "This has nothing to do with judging people based on their appearances. Humans don't have horns and claws and jaws full of sharp teeth. Dinosaurs aren't ugly, they're monsters. They're creatures who evolved to kill."
Steve had thought he'd already suffered through every kind of pain imaginable today, but it turned out he hadn't. Not this sharp stab right where he knew his mind was stored, or the surge of agony that seemed to run straight through his spine, cold and electric.
Steve gasped, making Tony's breath catch, too, staring at Tony, his eyes huge.
"Just making the best of what I've got," Steve said, running his fingers along Tony's spine.
"We've done our best to protect your privacy," the nurse replies. "As far as I know, the news that you've been found isn't out yet."
“How’s this, then: back there, I felt like a horny teenager, and now I feel like an octogenarian who got run over by a truck,” Tony said, rubbing at one shoulder and wincing as if to demonstrate.
Steve joined the authorities in herding the crowd away and clearing a path for the firefighters carrying a gurney out of the front doors. They'd covered the victim with a blanket to shield them from view, but the glimpses Steve caught were enough to put his fears to rest. The outline of the figure under the cloth was unmistakably bigger than Tony; even though the person's height was hard to estimate, he was bulky and barrel-chested. Tony's build was much slimmer.
Before the Accords tore them apart, he'd often regretted that they hadn't become closer. Deep down, he'd carried feelings for Tony that he hadn't been brave enough to admit even to himself.
A few more turns and they were facing the imposing metal door of the Vault, befitting of its name. Bucky had never visited the place, but he'd heard rumors that it contained some of the most valuable possessions of the Resistance. Rumlow turned the large wheel set in the door to open it while Bucky kept a hand on the chain of Stark's shackles, just in case.
Steve's mouth falls shut. His LED is stuck on red, and the anger in his eyes is downright scary in its intensity. If looks could kill, Obie would be dead ten times over.
She turned the smile towards Steve, but he wasn't placated by it in the least. He was still seething at what had been done to him. "So, is it you I've got to thank for this, then?" he growled at her across the room.
Steve stood up, feeling desperately like he needed to do something, anything, to make things better, right there and then, even though there wasn't anything he could do.
He hit enter.
"Why?" Steve returned, taken aback.
Steve held Tony by the shoulders, admiring his bare upper body. It looked just as he remembered it: lean muscles and unblemished skin, with a soft golden shimmer that he thought was mostly reflected light from the fireplace. There was no sign of the bullet wounds. If Steve hadn't seen them with his own eyes, he would never have guessed Tony had been injured at all. He explored the silky smooth skin with his fingers, drawing a line down Tony's sternum, over his stomach, and back again, enjoying the quiver of muscles under his fingertips and the stutter in Tony's breathing. Finally, he brought his hand up again to rest his palm over the excited throb of Tony's heartbeat.
“Not just any monkey!” Tony exclaimed, affronted. “He’s a very rare type of ape: a Homo sapiens, also known as a human. They’re supposed to be quite smart, you can teach them all kinds of tricks. I’ve heard they can even learn to speak simple words and sentences!”
Bucky let out a sigh, his shoulders sagging. He didn't feel like he deserved this, but Steve's forgiveness was still a huge relief. "Thank you."
Steve almost chuckled aloud at that. "That's got to be a first, someone worrying that they'd hurt Captain America."
Tony finally glanced at him, a desolate look to match his voice. "Don't you think I've been trying? When I realized that maybe there was no one after me, and maybe I'd caused those fires myself, I spent hours sitting in the bathtub trying to bring up flames, and didn't get as much as a single spark. Made me wonder if I had it wrong, after all. That night when I first met the Kingpin, I tried to hold back. I fought really hard. I thought I'd even made some progress—I didn't black out that time, not entirely, I just felt detached and everything was hazy. I remembered more about it afterwards, too. But then there was that other night, at the waterside, and—well, you saw how that went. I've made a tiny bit of progress since then, I think, but it's too little, and far too late."
"Of course." Steve pressed the button to open the doors. "See you tomorrow, Tony," he added, casting a glance over his shoulder.
He'd never wanted a soulmate, but if he had to match with someone, Tony was as good as he could hope for: someone he genuinely appreciated and found intriguing. Easy on the eyes, too. Steve had never thought he might end up in a relationship with a man, and he knew that even if they were soulmates, that didn't mean they would. If they did, though—surprisingly enough, he wasn't entirely opposed to the idea. Sure, it also felt a little unnerving, but as much as he was a man of the past, Steve had never been afraid of the new and the unexplored.
Tony made an incredulous face at him and held up a hand, gesturing at him to stop. “Wait, what are you talking about? Are my memories false after all? From what I recall, we were both very much into it. I wasn’t opposed to any of what happened. Quite the opposite, in fact.”
"Sure, and that's fine. I was just thinking, if it's like that, is it safe for you to be sitting here like this, in plain view?" This was something Steve had been wondering about; he hadn't been expecting to find Tony in the first room he walked into.
They were very nearly done, with only the badly bent chest and back plates left to pry apart, when the mission channel came to life.
"And it looks an awful lot like the connecting factor might be him," Jan filled in. She sighed and shook her head. "Oh, Tony. What've you gotten yourself into this time?"
