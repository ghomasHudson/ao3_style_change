we'll have our sleepover?" Tony countered back and Scar thought about it for a moment before nodding "Fine, but study first and
"I'm going to sleep now, babe...take care of yourself..." and slowly Tony drifted off to a deep long slumber. Two, three deep breaths later, Tony stopped breathing and Steve let go, crying holding Tony's immobile body "Goodnight and goodbye, sweetheart...thanks for everything.." Steve whispered into Tony's temple and the boys hugged their father one last time. The funeral was held with only the close friends and families, buried beside Tony's best friend Scar, Steve hoped that they would be together in their afterlife, everyone saying their favorite memory of Tony. Steve then drove the boys back and then retreated to the bedroom where once there was two, now only one.
Everything happened in slow motion, one minute he was walking towards the elevator to get his armor and another a missile drops in his penthouse floor. Tony flew and hit his back against the the window pane and the glass shattered and Tony plunged into the sea “JARVIS! Deploy Mark 42!” and immediately Mark 42 came flying and encased him but since it was a test model, the thrusters wouldn’t work and Tony kept falling and dived into deep water. “JARVIS, power up the thrusters at maximum! Power up! Turn it back on! Water is flowing! Thrusters!” Tony was hyperventilating but JARVIS smoothly calmed him “
Bucky huffed a laughter and Tasha looked up from her studies with an amused smile and a quizzical look but Bucky shook his head but leaned forward and pecked her forehead. Tasha fondly smiled at him before returning to her file. Two soft padding sound was heard from the corridor and Steve and Tony emerged from the archway, whispering to each other and giggling quietly. Steve looked up and saw Bucky "Hey Buc-" Bucky cut him off with a shushing motion and pointed his thumb at Tasha, who was currently hunched over her notes. Steve nodded his head and herded Tony towards the coffee machine to make their breakfast. Two plates of eggs and bacon and two mugs of coffee for each of them, Steve and Tony settled themselves at the island counter, Steve beside Bucky and Tony beside Tasha. Tony devoured his food while also listening to Tasha's conversation. "Once the genes had been delivered, the team will be able to activate or inhibit neurons, depending on the type of DREADD being expressed in the cells, by injecting the mice with CNO. In a proof-of-concept assay, the researchers used the technique to selectively inhibit neurons in the hippocampus, temporarily blocking the animals’ ability to form memories of a painful stimulus." Tasha nodded a few times before continuing "This method is reversible, actually. You can administer a drug to turn off neural cells of interest, but, with time, those cells will turn back on." Tasha nodded a few more times before a smile started growing on her face before air pumping her fist in the air "And we have a deal! Thank you so much for your time, Mr.Scott. I'll arrange our next meeting in a week from now to sign our confirmation. Yes, thank you very much" Tasha finished and tapped her earpiece off and took it off before settling it on the counter. She looked up to face three quizzical looks from Tony, Steve and Bucky "Well, you can say hola to the newest technology to recover from personal trauma without needing any medication at our very own Stark Industries!" Tasha announced with open arms. Tony beamed and hugged her tight before Bucky and Steve followed suit. Returning to their seats Bucky was the first one to speak up "I'm really proud of you, doll. I told ya, you'll come up!" Steve continued "Congrats, babe! You deserve this!" the four of them finished their breakfast before the rest of the team filled up the kitchen, cheering for Tasha for her new achievement. Cleaning her bowl, she looked at the clock "Shit! Tones, we have around an hour before Pep comes here with her murder glare to herd us off to your presentation at M.I.T" Tasha said from the sink. Tony cursed under her breath before inhaling his coffee and shoving the last bits of the eggs before dropping them in the sink and gushing Tasha to go and get ready, him following suit, right after giving Steve a long passionate kiss.
and slides right to call him up. After a few rings, Bruce picks up the phone "ello?" he answers, his voice thick with sleep and it's followed by another rumble at the back. Ahana grimaces "Hey, Bruce" she greets "Hey! Ahana, what's up? You okay?" "Yeah, I'm fine, I just need your help, a teeny tiny help" she asks and hears a thump followed by another deep voice before Bruce speaks back "What? Are you okay? Need the Avenge-" "Woah! No! No need for the Avengers, I just need your help, it's...it's an injured animal" "I think I'm hearing it wrong, but, did you say there's an animal in your office?" "Yeah... it's a wolf..." she says, biting her lips and hears Bruce curse at the other end "Ahana!" "I know, I know, but Bruce it's injured and he really likes me, if he was really dangerous, it would have chewed me off-" "Not helping, Ahana" "-which it didn't, so don't worry. It's safe but not for long if the wound is not treated." she says and Bruce sighs heavily "Please, Bruce. Pretty please with a cherry on top?" she offers and Bruce chuckles quietly "Okay, okay, fine. I'll come but please be safe" "I will, thank you and bye!" she says and cuts the call.
Tony thought to himself but made his way to his room. Entering his room, he immediately locked it, had a nice, long hot shower, set up his private communication server and sat down on the bed to call Steve. "
" Natasha says gently and Ahana hums. "I already cried myself to sleep yesterday and then woke up this morning thinking...what use of me if I just keep crying and doing nothing, your brother is here, safe, maybe, but here, so think of finding him a cure" "For the wolf?" Natasha asks horrified but Ahana shakes her head.
Tony gasped for air, panting, sweating, he could hear voices but it all seemed to far away, he reached out to the voices and suddenly a hand, a large warm hand caught his hands and threaded his fingers with theirs. Tony snapped from his haze and looked up. Brown eyes met with clear azure eyes. "Steve...." and Tony slumped forward just enough for Steve to catch him and Tony cried. Tony cried his eyes out, from the betrayal, from his sister. After a few minutes, his cries reduced to quiet sobs and he finally looked up at Steve "Steve..you're still alive.." "Of course I'm still alive, sweetheart...Are you okay?" Tony shook his head and slumped back onto the bed with his arm covering his eyes "Wanna talk about it?" Tony shook his head and that's when the door to his room opened and Bucky and Sam entered. "Hey..you okay?" Sam asked. Tony sat up against the headboard and accepted the cup of coffee from Bucky with a slight nod. After finishing his coffee, he was very much awake "Wait. What are you guys doing here?" "There was a bombing-" "At Upstate New York. I know. Saw it on the news yesterday night..." Tony looked at Steve "Thought....you..." Steve didn't let him finish his word by kissing him quiet "I'm fine...nothing happened, the bomb went off upstate, not anywhere near the compound." Tony nodded and walked towards the garbage bin to throw the coffee cup. "Anyway, you didn't answer my question. Why are you guys here?" "Bucky said that he has something you might want to look at" Sam replied. Tony turned to look at Bucky and Bucky rummaged his bag and took out a yellow file. It was a generic profile case file, a little dusty. "What's this?" "After the attack at upstate, Bucky went to his room and brought this to Steve" "When it happened at the cemetery, I thought it was another play, a lady disguised as Tasha but after the other two bomb blast, the M.O fit to the profile case in this file." "Why do you have this file?" "When....back when I was still Winter Soldier, I was assigned to take out her-" "Who is her?" "Yelena. Yelena Belova. That was the name they assigned to Tasha back at the facility. When Baron Zemo took over the reign of HYDRA, Zola was casted aside, Zola got angry and assigned me to take her out, since she was Zemo's right hand. But then, the whole S.H.E.I.L.D fiasco happened and the file just...got forgotten" "Until now..." Bucky nodded grimly. Tony took the file and placed it at the scanner near his laptop. "J, scan this file and project it" "
Slowly, "T..T'ny..?" Tony stopped and stared at Tasha below him. "I...is that..yo..you?" she asked again. Tony's eyes filled with tears and he slowly got up from Tasha's lying body and sat back only to scramble towards her and embrace her tight. "Yes..yes..it's me..Tony..your Tony.." he rasped between hitched breaths. Tasha took a few minutes before she returned the embrace and cried. Tony took all her weight and rocked both of them back and forth, kissing every inch of skin available to him, Tasha returning every kiss. "God..Tasha..god, every day...missed you..so much.." Tony hiccuped and Tasha kissed his forehead lightly. After a few minutes, they pulled apart and stared at each other before Tasha beamed at him and placed a last kiss on top of his head. She caressed Tony's jaw, lips, ears,cheeks,hair as if to remember all those features that made Tony, well Tony. Tont huffed wetly "It's me sis, it's really me, I'm really here" "Oh, Tony....I'm so sorry-" "Hey, no apologizing, that wasn't you, that was your alter ego" Tasha looked away from Tony's eyes and looked at the ground but Tony took her chin and made her face him "It wasn't you." Tasha smiled but it didn't reach her eyes but nodded nonetheless. They hugged one more time, before Tasha's eyes traveled to the other person standing behind Tony. She looked up and gasped. Tony knew and let her go, helping her up before she fell into Bucky's arms like a broken ragdoll. Bucky automatically pulled he in and shoved his face into her hair breathing in her scent. "I'm here, doll. I'm here, I got ya, you're safe." Bucky kept repeating it as Tasha held onto him like a lifeline. Bucky kissed her head, her forehead and continued to pepper her face with light kisses, careful of the nasty bruises she was already sporting. "James..." and they kissed. Bucky kept the kiss light, memorizing her lips and the feeling of her weight against his. Reluctantly parting off, Bucky leaned his forehead against Tasha's and they stayed like that for a long while, just breathing each other's breath. "James, James...I..I love you..." Tasha rasped, her voice hitched. Bucky tightened his hold on her and pecked her lips on more time "I love you too, doll" Bucky breathed into her ears.
” “And that allows him to perfect the Extremis serum and now its stable. And now they inject it in…I’m clueless, J. Help me.” “
Dazhe posle togo, kak ya voshel v tvoyu mechtu, ty vse yeshche ne? - Even after I entered your dream, you still don't know?
The bell rang just after Tony hefted his red and gold backpack and his lunch, indicating the start of his new year in his new school. Hugging Jarvis and Mrs. Maximoff one last time, Tony and Scarlett raced off to their class. Standing at the entrance of the main door, a lady at her mid thirties was welcoming all the students, smiling and nodding at Tony and Scarlett before the duo approached her "Hello, kids, I'm Ms. May, how can I help you?" Ms. May asked them politely "Hi, Ms. May, my name is Scarlett and both of us are first graders, can we know where is our class?" Scarlett asked and Ms. May crouched down to their level "Go straight and after three doors on your left, the fourth one is the first grade class!" Ms. May answered back and her shifted to the brunette behind her "And who is this little guy?" Tony blushed and Scarlett gently tugged him to the front and nudged him to talk "I-I'm Anthony, call me Tony" Tony answered him back softly. Ms. May smiled softly and stood back and gestured towards their class "Well, Scarlett and Tony, welcome to SHIELD Elementary School"
After another round in the shower- definitely Steve's fault- Tony, Steve, Sam and Bucky went to the nearest diner just a few feet away from the motel to have their breakfast. Tony kept looking around him, scanning his surrounding as if something- or someones, in this case - will pounce and attack him. Steve noticed this and wrapped an arm around him tugging him close to his side. After a few minutes, the four of them reached the diner. It was a small diner, its decorations all wood and rustic, opening the door the aroma of freshly brewed coffee hit their nostrils. The interior was like a generic diner, only with no red or pink seats, the seats were mahogany brown with tables made from original teak wood, a brown rug was placed at the middle between the seating area and the breakfast bar. Tony and Steve took one side of the sitting are while Sam and Bucky sat on the other. Tony waved for a waitress and a middle aged woman came to take their orders. "Welcome to Lynette and Jerri's Diner, and I'm Lynn, what would you fine boys like this morning?" the waitress- Lynn -  asked. "I'll take a cup of black coffee, with two sugars and a Breakfast Taco" Tony replied "I'll take the Ceylon tea, less sugar with Homemade Egg Muffins" Steve replied "Piccolo Latte with Crescent Bacon Breakfast Ring" Bucky answered "A cup of Cafe Latte and a Baked Blueberry French Toast" Sam finished. Lynn wrote down their orders and promised them the food will be served in less than 30 minutes, bid her farewell and took off to attend other customers. "So, how far are you in this?" Sam asked Tony "Remember back at the cemetery after the whole fiasco happened, she left her bag infront of the tombstone and left, so I waited until everyone left and it was much calmer, and picked it up. Went back to the tower and asked JARVIS to scan the content and we found this" Tony took out the file that he was holding in his hands. Steve took the folder and skimmed through it "Tony, this is-" "Yeah, Extremis. The one that I fought back in 2013. That's not the case here, it seems that Killian took the serum to-" Bucky cut him off "Arnim Zola to perfect and stabilize the serum. Since the Super Soldier serum was a failure, Zola too the opportunity to work on something that is already available rather than recreating something from scratch." Tony nodded. Tony continued "And then they needed a test subject, like how Dr. Erskine chose you for Project Rebirth, Zola chose Tasha or in this case Yelena as their test subject. And it worked, the serum was stable and Yelena became a superhuman." Steve nodded while still skimming through the file. The conversation quieted down when Lynn came and delivered their orders at their table. Bucky continued "Then they needed trainers, so they assigned me to train her. She was the first one of their new line of soldiers so, they trained her hard. Like real hard, and then she was sent to her first mission, she failed and Red Skull tortured her. That was the routine. Train, Go for a mission, if you succeed then you get money but if you fail then starvation and isolation in the Dark Room." "What's a Dark Room?" Sam asked "It's the room where the mind washing happens, and...god I could hear her scream her lungs out even a few blocks away. The routine went on and on, Yelena gained more experience, she got more money and she lost all her emotions. She didn't even scream when they brought her to the Dark Room, nonetheless felt pity on other kids they tortured. Its like she became a mindless soldier. Then Yelena and I were sent on a mission together and we kinda bonded, friendship turned to love and she changed to a normal person. She talked normal and she smiled a lot more. She always complained that here mind was always fuzzy, like she was supposed to remember something but she couldn't even recognize it. Months went by and we wanted to get out of there. That's when Baron Zemo took over Hydra."
” “But the Extremis serum is to form a new body part if that said one is decapitated, but Tasha is still a full body.” “
"You okay?" Steve asks and Ahana nods "The day felt a little shitty but that guy" she gestures at the wolf and beckons him towards her, stroking his fur "made it better, so, I'm fine now" she says, a small smile in her face. Clint comes and sits beside her "So, how did you find this guy?" he asks and Ahana huffs before she recounts the whole day, her husband glowering when she says about the barista that flirted with her, Ahana laughing at it. It was late midnight, when the last of the, Steve and Rhodey, go back to their room and Bucky carries her to the room, the wolf following them. He drops her on the bed and climbs beside her and brings her into his arms when a furry furball comes in between, the wolf shoving his face and body on top of Ahana. Bucky stares at the wolf before Ahana's laughter breaks him out of his stupor and he grumps at the wolf, happily slumbering on top of her. Ahana laughs subsides "Come here, Grumpy pants, this side for you and Bucky cuddles up to her right side and dozes of instantly. Ahana rolls her eyes and kisses her forehead before kissing the wolf and closing her eyes. A faint kiss on her right and a nuzzle on her left is all she feels before she goes to deep sleep.
was in preschool." Tony explained with glassy eyes "What happened?" Harley asked "She..she died of cancer, when she was around 16 years old". The family reached the graveyard and stood in front of Scar's tombstone "Hey, Scar...it's been almost 4 decades since I lost you and now I have a family, two beautiful sons, adopted the obviously, and a high end condominium. If you were still alive we could have been a real extended family...you..James..your kids" Tony trailed and tears formed against his cheeks. Steve rubbed his back and they placed a garland of rose flowers against the tombstone. "Bye.." Tony whispered and left the graveyard
Warning! - Contains mild -very mild- smut between Steve and Tony and also contains blood, gunshot and violence.
Steve pleaded while riding to Stark Towers. Reaching there and seeing the damage, all of his hope crumbled into ashes. It looked like Stark Towers didn’t exist only its rubbles and metal frameworks were still visible. Stark Towers was gone…
"You need more, baby boy?" his human asks, a loving hand through his fur and Tony whines- bacon aside, he's huge! Some raw meat should do it -and his human chuckles before ordering it to the voice above. His human's hand is still in his fur as the other humans come to the kitchen for breakfast and the table is soon packed with humans and voices. Still hungry, Tony ignores all the voices and rests his head on his human's lap and closes his eyes, waiting for his raw meat cuisine.
Reaching the HYDRA base, the teams seperated to their given posts. Two guards were hit by Steve's shield and two more were shot by Bucky's gun. The duo advanced to the building simultaneously killing all the HYDRA guards and agent. They finally entered the building "The metahumans were held down here and he lead Steve towards a secret tunnel. Halfway through, a loud shriek echoed from inside and Steve and Bucky halted their steps, heart beating "Tasha.." Bucky whispered to himself. They were going to wipe her memories, no, that's not gonna happen this time and the duo ran following the sound. Their hearts stopped when they saw Tasha struggling on the chair while her mind was being wiped, Steve then threw his shield and threw off several doctors and the procedure completely stopped. Bucky raced towards her and unclasped the restrains and bridal carried Tasha in his arms, tears flowing from his eyes. The heavy jostling caused Tasha to crack one of her eye and look at Bucky then her other eyes followed suit and her eyes widened "James...?" Bucky slowed his steps entering the Avenjet and pressed his forehead to hers "Yes, doll...it's me...I told you I'll come back" and the jet flew away from the now destroyed HYDRA base. Tasha's eyes was still open when they laid her on the examination table in the MedBay in the jet and she gasped. Tony squeezed her ways through the crowd and halted his steps when Tasha's eyes met his. They continue looking at each other when she suddenly reached for Tony with a shaky hand and Tony immediately grabbed her hands and pressed his forehead against hers and whispered "You're back, you're back sis, I'm not going anywhere..." Tasha cracked a small smile before passing out on the table.
” “Son of a bitch. J, keep trying and keep me posted, I’ll be at the penthouse. Shower and a talk to a very special super soldier is on the line.” “
After welcoming the newest addition to their extended family, Steve and Tony returned back to their condo. Shutting the door, Steve slammed Tony against the wall and captured Tony's lips is a rough kiss, plunging his tongue into the hot cavern of Tony's inner walls, sliding through his straight teeth, twinning with his tongue. They lazily grinded against each other, Steve then shoved his thigh in between Tony's legs, prompting Tony to rub against his thigh. The duo broke off panting for air and Tony looked up smirking "What got you so turned on?" Steve who was up to a few minutes ago, rough housing against him, now standing shyly,
Bucky slowly fucks her with his finger as he kisses along her thighs, occasionally sucking a bruise. Ahana twists and turns, moans and whimpers, begs Bucky for more when Bucky inserts a second finger, his rhythm turning a little faster. Bucky comes up, fingers still moving in her clit, and kisses her roughly, his tongues prying her lips and tasting her mouth. Ahana's moans and whimpers are swallowed by Bucky as he adds a third finger and a fourth finger into her, his pace brutal against her clit. They lean apart and Ahana whimpers loudly "Bucky, need...you..in...me..fuck!...please" she begs and Bucky hums and pecks her lips one more time before he extracts his fingers. He pinches her panties and it comes ripping off into two, before Bucky takes his boxers off and plunges his cock into her. Burying himself to hilt, he waits until Ahana catches her breath then nods for him to move, hooking her legs to the small of his back. Bucky's pace is brutal as he fucks into her, covering her as he bends down and peppers kisses along her neck and collarbone. Bucky spreads her legs further and moves a little closer when Ahana flies off her bed, her back a perfect arch.
Tony barely had any time to call for his suit when he heard someone pulling a trigger right behind his head and a knife was shoved near his throat. Steve launched forward when Bucky pulled him back again "
Steve then ran towards the counter, flung the dish cloth, took a small book and a pen and shuffled his way to the new customer "Hi! My name is Steve! What would you like today?" he asked with a smile. Tony took a few moments to end his call and then looked up and his eyes widened, mouth agape "Ste-" that was the only word he uttered before his whole demeanor hardened and he straightened his back and flipped through the menu card "Uhh, I'll order a Long Black with two sugars and a" he gulped at a particular word "and a..blueberry pie" Steve nodded and wrote down the order "Anything else?" Steve asked but Tony only shook his head before opening a sleek laptop from his pouch and started working on it. Swallowing his disappointment, he took back the menu and made his way to the counter where Sam and Clint were looking at him "Is that Tony?" Sam asked and Steve nodded. He started making Tony's order, since it was still early hours, the coffee shop was still fairly empty so he finished the order quickly. He sat the tray on the counter and just looked at him. He was hunched over his laptop, furiously typing while muttering something to himself. Steve sighed before bringing the tray to him.
P.S - Since Vision exists at the Avengers compound, Tony installed JARVIS at the Stark Tower to take care of his company. And I really like Riri Williams, so she is the CEO of Stark Industries.
She keeps the steady stream of hot water when someone knocks on the bathroom door and Bucky enters, in his hand a box of dog shampoo and conditioners. "Hey, saw this outside and here" he gives the box and kisses her lips "How's our wolf doing?" "He's enjoying his little spa session" Ahana replies with a laugh and gives the shower head to Bucky as she opens the shampoo and lathers it on the wolf's fur, slowly cleaning the blood and dirt in the fur, humming a soothing tone as she does it. "So, they know" Bucky starts and Ahana stiffens "About?" "Both the wolf and your absence" "And?" "They are okay with the absence and excited about the wolf. Rhodey and Steve wants to talk toy you, tho" and Ahaa huffs "Of course they do" she says and continues bathing the wolf. After bathing and drying - hallelujah for hairdryers, his fur is thick! -Ahana and Bucky brings the wolf to the common room, the other Avengers already in their pyjamas, watching some kind of movies, and sits at the love seat at the far corner. "Hey," she greets and Rhodey pauses the movies and walks towards her, stopping when the wolf at her feet growls threateningly. Ahana shushes him and beckons Rhodey "Hey" she greets him and he hugs her, tight and burries his face into her neck, the other Avenger following, the wolf unknowingly walking away from the group hug.
Peter hears the noises from his parents room and turns up the television louder. He knew they were doing their adult thing and they would be in there a while so it was a perfect time to sneak cookies from the kitchen. He places his chocolate cookies carefully on a napkin in his lap. He munches away as he tries to not think about the previous night. It felt more like a dream to him than reality. He’s lost in his Disney movie when he hears the loud sound of a door creaking open. He jumps at the sound and his eyes are drawn towards the basement door. He puts his pile of cookies on the couch cushion next to him and walks over to the basement. He intended to shut the door and return to the living-room but something was drawing him down. One foot after the other, he takes the steps down into the basement. He flips the switch at the bottom of the stairs and looks around him.
Tony starts to drag the crying child towards the house, mumbling about tying him down to his bed. “I don’t want to hear it, Steve. Fucking middle of the night and he’s being Runaway Train over here.”
Tony is pulled out from the song by the brush of cool metal over his skin, Steve’s dog tags resting between the juts of his collarbones. He reaches up, fingertip rubbing over the raised metal of Steve’s name.
“I’m looking for an ice pack,” Tony snaps, moving away from him. He reminds Steve of an injured wild dog, his teeth barred, hackles rising. Don’t touch me, his body language screams – but Tony’s eyes focus on Steve’s lips for a moment, and Steve watches as Tony crosses his arms defensively over his chest. Touch me, his eyes had said.
Steve glances down at himself and grimaces, his hands moving to his pockets as he stands at the foot of Tony’s bed.
“Voila,” Tony says with a flourish, placing the bowl of pasta and seafood in front of Steve. “I tried to go light on the spice for the sauce, didn’t want your head to explode.”
“Stop.” Steve reaches out and grabs him by the upper arm, squeezing painfully. “Stop, Tony, there’s someone up there.”
He spends weeks in the med bay, receives skin graft after skin graft, and barely talks. Bucky comes to visit, sometimes, just to keep him company. If they have a funeral for Tony, they don’t tell him about it – but that’s fine, he’s going to be seeing Tony again very soon. Very soon.
“Yep,” Tony says, walking forward, hearing Steve inhale sharply. He walks all the way down the thin beaten path to the edge of the cliff, whistling as he stares down at the base. “No wonder it took us hours, Steve, this shit is tall. Where’s Nebula’s sister?”
“You cracked my sternum clean in two. I had a collapsed lung, too. Guess my ribs weren’t as strong as I thought they were. Nearly choked on my own blood, if you must know.” The glass is empty, and Tony wonders if Steve would try to stop him if he went to the kitchen to fill it again.
Weeks pass. Tony heals, and slowly starts to spend more time out of the bedroom. Steve had peered in it once when Tony was in the bathroom, expecting to see a new Iron Man suit already standing at attention. All he saw was a neatly made bed and a notebook on the nightstand beside it.
Tony’s hands drop away from Steve’s neck, the warmth of the other man’s body fades in an instant – cold air that whistles in his ears, and then immense, unspeakable pain as his body hits the rock below. And then nothing.
Steve takes one look at the piece of paper on the desk in front of him, and his jaw sets, Tony wonders if it would be sharp enough to cut his fingertips. He wants to touch him, all the same.
He looks into the red metal, sees how unfocused his eyes are, and closes them. Yes, he has a lot of memories with this shield.
“Can you forgive me?” Steve inwardly doesn’t want to know the answer to that question, but he has to ask.
“Captain Rogers.” A nurse stands at the foot of Tony’s bed, making notes in his chart. “Visiting hours are over.”
“Hang on, I’ve got something for that.” Steve slips off of the stool and pads into his bedroom, rooting around through his duffel bag. He had checked the weather, and assumed that he and Tony would spend some time out in the sun – though his suggestion for a trip down to the beach had died when Tony had told him more of his time in Afghanistan.
“Harley,” Tony corrects quickly, and then winces – he’s proving Steve’s point. “Anyways, it doesn’t matter. Pete’s okay, but he wants to stay a little low to the ground.” Tony frowns. “Bad phrase. I mean, he just wants to keep to his neighborhood. I told him that’s fine, of course it is. When I heard about what happened – I – You know, if the kid died…”
“Where’s that music coming from?” Steve asks as he turns Tony around in his arms, his hands resting on Tony’s hips. Tony’s eyebrows raise as Steve starts to sway them around the one bedroom apartment.
Tony leans forward more, the steering wheel pressing against his sore chest. Steve has a beard, much darker than the hair on his head, it makes him look different. More intimidating, older, more dangerous.
“I can take it, if you want,” Pepper senses the conflict within him, the anger and hope sparring desperately.
“I…” Steve swallows, this isn’t how this is supposed to go. Lisbon is experiencing a freak heat-wave for January, the temperatures outside are in the low 70s. This trip to Portugal is supposed to mirror their trip to Paris. They were supposed to set aside what happened in the past and enjoy each other’s company. Not even in bed, the entire time, no – Steve missed hearing Tony rant about his newest invention, and Steve had never heard Tony play the piano. There had been one in Stark Tower, a beautiful, shining grand piano. Pepper Potts had heard Tony play, and Steve knew it was ridiculous to feel jealous about that, but… When he had rented their house for their time here, he had searched high and low for a house that came with a piano – just in case Tony felt like playing for him. Now, Tony is more likely to throw the piano at him in a fit of rage.
“She’s – okay,” Steve says cautiously, suddenly feeling like he’s walking on a tightrope – a very thin tightrope that sways hundreds of feet over the ground. “She… Misses home. We talk about you, sometimes.”
Tony still has his arms crossed over his chest, looking at Steve uncertainly. In the bright fluorescent lights of the med-bay, Steve can make out the bruise he had left on Tony’s jaw, a deep purple that fades into the darkness of Tony’s goatee.
He rests his head against the edge of the shield, the metal cool – he should be cold, he realizes, droplets of his blood dripping out of the corner of his mouth and sliding down the curve of metal. He should be cold, because it is snowing, and he’s in a metal suit, and he’s dying.
“Tony? Are you there?” Steve’s voice is heard by no one, the flip phone half obscured by a sizeable chunk of rubble. “Tony?”
Steve thinks of the helmet he had slung over the handlebars for Tony and feels sick. This isn’t how this is supposed to go at all.
Tony snorts, his trembling hands shoved deep into his pockets. “I’ll tell you why I look like shit, bud, the cause has a name – Thaddeus Ross. What an asshole.”
He drags his suitcase up the driveway furiously, muffling a curse when he runs over his own foot in his haste.
Tony slowly pushes himself onto his feet, staggering into the ropes, his knees going weak. “I think I’m concussed.”
“Don’t go,” Tony’s voice is barely more than a whisper, and a flush of shame spreads over his cheeks. Steve’s fingers brush slowly over the warm flesh.
Tony gives him a look as he takes a bite of the stracciatella gelato, exhaling softly. Steve hasn’t been keeping up with his hair dye, he notices, his roots are practically golden in the sunlight. The beard is still there, unfortunately, Tony misses Steve’s smooth jaw – he had only been able to run his lips over it once.
“I’m sorry.” Steve’s eyes meet his, and his apology seems genuine, but it doesn’t make Tony feel much better.
Steve laughs, and Tony closes his eyes at the sound. “Hey, I was just asking for a suggestion, Tony. C’mon, give me something to go on.”
“No,” Tony groans as he struggles to his feet, wanting to come up with some razor-sharp retort to the fact that Bruce Banner is pushing a wheelchair into the med bay for him, but all he feels at the idea is gratitude. “No, I have stuff I need to say to our magnificent leader.”
ya ne idiot! ya izuchal tebya! ya vyuchil tvoi dvizheniya! ya trenirovalsya kak ty! postroy prototip svoyego kostyuma! - I am not idiot! I studied you! I learned your moves! I trained like you! Build a prototype of your costume!
The nurse then slowly tells Ahana the dosage of each capsule and leaves the couple alone. Ahana is lazily opening and closing her eyes, her hand in Bucky's arm when her eyes snap open. "Shit! Babe, my wolf!" she jerks awake but Bucky gently lay her back down, kissing her forehead. Bucky leans back and then gestures at the bed beside hers. Ahana squints and sees a human, a male beside and looks back at Bucky with a questioning gaze. Bucky huffs as he reaches the bed remote and slowly raisees the top part of the bed and gestures to his right again. Ahana looks again and this time her eyes widen. "It...it's...it's Tony" she whispers and her tears fall from her eyes.
" Clint says in the comms and Bucky smirks. As quick as he can he uses his metal arm and bats the gun away and grabs the back of Yelena's neck, slams her into the wall and points his gun into the small of her back, pressing himself against her. "Tell this to whoever sent you here, you wanna show who's the boss, you come after me. You touch my wife, and the next thing he's gonna get are crates full of HYDRA cadavers with a bow tied to it. Eto moye pervoye i posledneye preduprezhdeniye. Poydem snova za moyey zhenoy, i ya klyanus', chto razorvu kazhdogo iz vas na chasti i kuski, ya prigotovlyu ikh i zastavlyu ikh s"yest' ikh. YA delal eto ran'she i sdelayu eto snova." Bucky grits as he let's go of Yelena and shoots the wall beside her.
Ahana looks down at the wolf, which is slumbering on top of her and chuckles while soothingly running her fingers through his fur. "Shit!" she exclaims when she realises that it's time for her to go to the site meeting and immediately calls her PA. "Hey, Kat, minor changes, let Pepper go to the site visit" she says "But, she's on maternity leave" "Fuck! Uhh, who is on the team?" "Jackson, team leader, but he's on emergency leave" "Who else?" "Oh! Zeeta, RnD manager" "Then email her the details and ask her to go, I can't, a little busy, sorry and can we conference the shareholder's meeting here, in my office?" "Yeah, just zoom call from your place, but, are you okay?" "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine just a little tired but I'm good. Just conference those calls for me, thanks." she greets before ending her call when the door to her office knocks. The wolf which was previously slumbering on her lap, perks up and starts snarling but Ahana shushes him with a hand on his head "Relax, baby boy, just Bruce" she says "Come in, Bruce" she calls out and Bruce comes in, his doctor bag and stethoscope in hand. "Hey, sorry to call you early" Ahana apologizes but Bruce waves her off "Nah, it's okay. So, where's our wolf?" he asks and Ahana gestures at her lap and Bruce slowly pads forward until he kneels beside Ahana "Wow....he's beautiful, I mean blood aside, he's beautiful" Bruce says as he gently lowers his palm towards the wolf's muzzle and the wolf gently sniffs his hand and whines before laying his head on Ahana's lap.
, I came here for the dog but what a suprise when I saw your wife, and I was like, why not both?" she taunts and Bucky grits his teeth. "
Steve, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make but not a lot of time. So...First off, sorry for bringing up the past about Bucky and the Accords. That was stupid and reckless of me and it won't happen again. Also, you're right. About Tasha. You have the right to think that she could have killed me without a second thought. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance, cause I'm still going to find her and bring her back and I won't be home for our anniversary. I need to find her. You gotta stay safe, that's all I know. Don't worry about me, I'm fine, in a dingy motel with a second hand car. That's all. Stay safe and...I love you, baby. Always." Tony ended his call, switched off his lights and went to sleep.
A potom .... ty skazal Tashe na menya, ty skazal mne eto imya, kak budto ono moye, kotoroye zastalo menya vrasplokh. - And then .... you said Tasha at me, you told me that name, as if it was mine, which took me by surprise.
Bucky skirts his left hand to her bra hooks and deftly unhooks it and throws it, the garment landing on the floor with a muffled thud. Bucky then starts kissing down her neck ad swipes his tongue on her nipples, causing her breath to hitch and her grip to tighten against the satin sheets. Bucky expertly sucks on her tits as his other hand rolls the other nipple, Ahana's legs automatically spreading, positioning Bucky in between her legs. His right hand then slowly travels to the waistband of her panties and taps against her covered clit. "Fuck baby, you're so wet. You're drippin':" Bucky mutters as he finishes sucking her second breasts and licks his way down to her clit. Bucky rubs two fingers against her clit and Ahana whimpers "Bucky, baby....please" she begs and Bucky chuckles darkly "Please what baby?" he asks as he licks on long stripe at her covered clit and Ahana moans loudly "Please...please fuck me" she begs and Bucky hums "I'd do anythin', if you beg this pretty, kitten" Bucky teases as he mover her panties aside and slowly pushes his middle finger into her warm wet heat, groaning as her inner walls clench around his fingers.
"Hey, doll...I know this is cruel, I know it hurts, but you're a strong one, baby...I know you are" Bucky whispered "You survived 30 years of brainwashing so I know you'll go through another six months of this cryo chamber. Don't worry, doll..you're not alone, I'll be here, Tony will be here, the whole family will be here.." his breath hitched "Doll..babe..I..I'm sorry I didn't come for you sooner..I'm sorry for not recognizing you..I'm sorry I moved on from you.." his breath hitched again "But I'm not sorry for loving you..loving you was one of the best thing..the best thing that has ever happened to..to me" he took a deep breath "Come back to me..come back to me, sweetheart..and I'll be waiting for you..I'll wait for you, this time..only for you..only for you.." a few light sobs escaped his lips "Babe..I..I love you..just..just remember that.." Bucky let his tears stream from her eyes, sobs escaping his lips. A warm hand landed on his shoulder and Bucky turned to see Steve, smiling sadly at him and Bucky broke. He grabbed Steve and hugged him tight and Steve returned the embrace, running his fingers through Bucky's hair comforting him.
" Tasha asked but before Tony got the chance to answer the Avengers were back on their feet and Tasha had no choice but to shoot at Tony's shoulder and flee from the spot. Steve rushed at Tony's side and started gathering him in his arms but Tony pushed him back forcefully. "Tony...?" Steve asked. "She...she was there and now she's gone....I told you, screamed and pleaded to let her go...I wanted her to come to me so that I can knock her out with my armour and I could have saved her...but you" Tony pointed at Steve "You ruined that chance....my only chance to get my sister back-" but Steve interjected "But Tony how do you know it's Tasha, she could have bee-" Tony voiced over him "BECAUSE SHE IS MY FUCKING SISTER! ONLY I KNOW ABOUT HER SCAR ON THE FACE! YOU KNEW IT WAS BUCKY THE MINUTE HE TURNED TO YOU BUT THAT'S NOT IN MY CASE?! I'M NOT AN IDIOT ROGERS!" Steve shuddered at the use of his last name and Tony woke up and stomped back to the compound.
" "Yeah, might as well....oh come on! Now I have to carry you?! Great, best fucking safety trip." Tony muttered to himself. "
and shuffled away into the building to retrieve his Prom King title. However, the win never reached his heart.
"Now, now" Jarvis soothed, bringing him back into an embrace and rubbing his back with his left hand while his right was on a quest inside his suit pocket, looking for a handkerchief. "I-I d-don't wanna g-go th-there!" Tony said against his clothed shoulder while Jarvis shushed him gently "But Anthony, you have to go" Jarvis tried again while pulling away and wiping Tony's face "B-but why?" Tony asked again and his lips started to wobble and Jarvis brushed a few stray tears with the pad of his thumb "Because, gong there, you can learn a lot of things! And make new friends!" Jarvis placated Tony but Tony huffed and crossed his arms staring at Jarvis's eyes "But I know everything already!" Tony protested with a pout and Jarvis huffed a laughter "Yes, I know my dear Anthony but going there you can learn
Steve set the tray down and placed his coffee and blueberry pie on the table and walked away when "How are you?" Steve stopped and turned around to see Tony still looking at the screen but his fingers were hovering above the keys. Steve briefly looked at Sam and Sam nodded and he sat opposite Tony, facing him "I'm...good, how about you?" "I'm...not fine" Tony finally sighed and closed his laptop before looking at Steve. Eyes red rimmed and skin pale, Steve heart shattered into pieces. "What happened" Steve slowly asked and Tony huffed a bitter laugh "After dad and mom died, I really wanted to fight through and continue at the academy but Scar's diagnosis shattered me back. After my parents and my butler, she was the only one close to me and the one I was comfortable being myself, hearing her having cancer threw me into a hyperbole. Without telling anyone, I went off, settled myself into a boarding school and tried to forget everything...while she was suffering in pain" Tony's breath hitched "Bucky always texted me her condition but there were days that I'll never open his texts, to scared, to broken to know that whatever it was, she was going to go. But that lady fought, a year was they gave her but she was alive for two years. So, I decided to go and visit her before my third semester started and that night I had a call...from the hospital, she was dead. Just like that and I didn't even get to say goodbye!" Tony whispered roughly to himself. "Guilt washed through me and that's why every holiday I get, I'll come down here and visit her, a penance for what I did when she was sick..." Tony finished with a wet laugh and then wiped his tears before looking at Steve "How are you? How's Peg?" Tony asked and Steve took a deep breath.
" she asked in Russian. Steve went near Tony but Bucky grabbed his hands and tugged on it to ask him to stay back."My husband's in trouble, Buck" Steve hissed at him "If you go any closer, she'll kill Tony and all of us. Let me" Bucky hissed back. All the other Avengers, stayed back while Tony and Tasha froze there, with a gun pointing at Tony's forehead. "
Target has changed.The Winter Soldier still has my file, and he gave it to them.You need to take the file from them, and then remove them both. The place is secured.The Avengers will be removed and we shall prevail! Hail Hydra!
"You were supposed to be mine! You ran out on me! And now, a wife?!" Yelena shrieks but Bucky only hears Clint's silent footsteps into the vault through the vents. "We were working together Yelena, I never had feelings for you" Bucky says, his expression stormy "And please don't tell me this whole shebang is cause you can't keep your panties from twisting cause I have a wife" he grits and Yelena chuckles sinisterly "Oh, don't worry,
Konechno eto pravda...Ya prishel na kladbishche, potomu chto znal, chto ty priyedesh' navestit' svoyu sestru. - Of course, this is true ... I came to the cemetery because I knew that you would come to visit your sister.
. She looked absolutely delicious and Bucky just wanted to peel those clothes off of her that instant. Tony was nothing short as he was stunning as ever, he was in
" JARVIS’s cool voice smoothly flowed from the ceiling. Tony choked back his tears when he heard Jarvis’s voice after five years. Not that FRIDAY is a bad AI but nothing can compare to the attitude and sass like JARVIS. “It’s good to be back, J” Tony said while still clearing the cobwebs. "
"-we have looked at using atomic layer deposition to grow films of titanium oxide and zinc oxide in a conformal manner on nanostructured surfaces for use in medical devices. In addition, we have used chemical vapor deposition to grow a hard carbon material known as ultrananocrystalline diamond on nanostructured surfaces. This is also for use in medical devices. We are examining the processing of many types of medical devices, including microneedles, both for drug delivery and for biosensing." Tony ended his speech with a dramatic bow and joined Tasha in the backstage. "You did great! Oh god, Tony, you were awesome out there!" "Nah, you're awesome too" Tony replied back with a shy smile. The duo later exited the building and joined their family for their celebratory dinner at their favorite diner a few blocks away from the compound. Tasha looked up from her cheeseburger and fondly smiled at the domestic scenery in front of her, Bucky then laced his fingers with her, and tugged her into a long kiss, cheese and oil and all.
"Sir" the voice says and Tony startles before taking a deep breath "Uhh, hi..?" "Hello, sir" "Uhh, can ask help?" "Calling all Avengers to the interrogation vault, Miss Stark is unconscious" the voice calls and then Tony looks down at himself before he asks the voice again "Uhh...clothes?" and the metal suit then comes off his human and wraps around him. Tony panics before the voice calmly soothes him "It's okay, sir, I'm not going to hurt you" the voice says and Tony relaxes. He gently lifts his human's head and places it in his lap before resting against the wall and waits for the other humans.
That night, Steve carried Tony to their bedroom and made love, slowly, passionately. Soft touches, whispered endearments were passed between the two souls. Steve kept praising Tony on how brave he was to come out to the family and reassured him that he is there with him and so is his family. "I love you, sweetheart..." Steve whispered into Tony's ears when both of them reached their climaxes. Tony slumped back into the mattress in a heap of tears and chocked gasps, too overwhelmed at the amount of love from his husband and his family. Steve slowly pulled out of Tony and settled beside him, gathered him in his arms and shushed him back and forth whispering sweet nothings in his ears. After a few minutes, Steve planted a kiss on Tony's head and slid off of the bed and padded to their bathroom to retrieve a damp washcloth and went back into the room. Steve took a few minutes standing at the frame of the bathroom door to just admire his husband on the bed. Olive skin a contrast to the milk-white sheets of their bed, skin glistening in sweat and cum just made him look majestic, where once his body was pulled up in tense situation, seeing him so pliant and relaxed made Steve's heart swell. "Take a picture, it might last longer" Tony's voice cut through his thoughts. Steve looked at Tony at saw him smirking, rolled over to the side and propped up by one arm. Steve rolled his eyes fondly, but made his way to the bed and started cleaning Tony up. Tony sighed pleasantly, and let Steve maneuver him however he wanted. Two minutes passed, and Steve finished cleaning himself and went to the bathroom to clean himself up. Tony was on the verge of sleepiness and tried his hardest to keep his eyes open to cuddle with his husband, but five minutes later, Steve came out of the bathroom to see Tony was already asleep and he climbed to bed, pulled him close to his body, planted a kiss on his head and lulled himself back to sleep.
He turns and shoots another few goons, blood splashing against his face and slashes a few of them. By the time Steve and the others get there, Bucky is covered in blood and is marching his way to the vault entrance, punching the code and bolting to his wife's side. Ahana is barely breathing and the Iron Man suit is gently holding her. Bucky ignores the suit as he slowly carries his unconscious wife to the medical. "'ucky?.." his wife mutters softly and Bucky chokes back a sob "I'm here, moya dorogaya zhena, I'm here, you'll be alright" he syas as he carries her to the med bay.
Tony hadn't expected to see Rogers after moving to a boarding school. It was the mid term break and Tony wanted to visit Scar's grave before leaving to Malibu with Pepper. It was almost 4 years since his best friend died of cancer and he was left alone. With nothing to stay and no one to stay, he enrolled himself to a boarding school and then went to MIT. That's where he got new friends and a very new environment. During his third year was when the news hit him like a brick wall. It was early in the morning when his phone buzzed and he picked it up, the hospital in the other line. He immediately shoot up from his bed, clutching his t-shirt as the doctor finally called it. Tears streamed down his cheeks and his broken sobs were heard by his roommate, Rhodey. Rhodey immediately rushed to the hospital and they arrived just in time to see the doctor closing Scar's dead body with the blanket. He crumbled on the ground as Rhodey held him and both of them spent the rest of the day finishing up the documentation of her death. Now, he was actually going back to Malibu from Massachusetts and wanted to stop by New York to visit her. That was when he found this coffee shop, and since he wanted a cup of coffee since morning and also a quiet place to finish his upcoming Mechanical Engineering project, he entered the cafe. Rogers was the last person he wanted to see that day.
Ahana sweeps her gaze along her long lost brother's body and turns to her husband "How is he?" she whispers "he's doing okay, no injury, just...." "What?" "He''s different...he doesn't talk like a human-" "Behaves like a wolf" she finishes understandingly and her husband nods.  Ahana sighs and lays back down on her bed "I don't care if he behaves like a wolf or still talks like one, but he's back, that's all that matters. His health is fine, the rest can cure gradually" she whispers as her eyelids slowly close, the painkillers in her system slowing her down and within minutes, she's dead to the world.
Entering the class, Tony saw a piece of paper on his table, weighed down by his pencil box. He approached his table and sat, taking the paper and gasping quietly. It was a drawing- not professional but a beautiful one nonetheless -and he turned to the back and caught Steve's eyes, Steve beaming back at him as Tony mouthed a thank you. He turned back at the drawing, it was him. He was smiling widely and talking to someone on his right- most probably at Scar  -with a big smile, gap tooth and all. His curly and unruly hair and his chubby cheeks were also drawn to perfection. At the very end of the paper were words, four words that bloomed an unconditional happiness in his heart. 'Nice to meet you, Tony' the writing said and it was signed off with a 'Yours, Steve' and a goofy smiley emoji. Tony beamed at the drawing again and carefully slid it into his file, closed it and took a deep breath and waited for his next class
The room was dead silence except for the data running at the background projected in hologram. Bucky looked up at Tony "I'm sorry, Tony...it was all I could do, and it was not enough, it was never enough..." Tony faced the windows overlooking the forest without a word. Steve came behind him and wrapped him up in his arms. Tony closed his eyes and leaned back into the safe warmth. "Guess, we both betrayed her trust huh?" Tony said but there was no heat behind it but sorrow, pure sorrow. "She lost her love from Howard and Maria, her own dad killed her, her twin brother stood there watching her die and the guy she loved left her behind...is it weird that I'm thinking that she could have stayed dead? Like just dead. Burried with a tombstone that validated it. I mean, she could have bypassed this kind of pains." Tony huffed bitterly. Steve tightened his grip and kissed his head "For what's worth, I know you can fix her, like with Bucky-" "But what if I don't want to fix her?" "What?" "What if I don't want to fix her, what if I don't want to see her? Does that make a difference?" "Tony, what's wrong? I thought that was the reason you are staying here?" "She tried to kill me Steve..." Steve jerked back and spun Tony until he was facing Steve. "Tony, what do you mean?" "The bomb blast at Stark Towers was not terrorist, it was personal, she wanted to get rid of me." "Bucky did the same too, Tony. You have to remember that its not her, that is not her. Bring her back, we'll fix her together-" "Then what? Crisis averted? Steve, even if I fixed her brain, memories of her...of her past life will haunt her to death. I'd rather let her be dead then seeing her walking around like a ghost with nightmare." "So, you're telling me that its not worth it? Saving her is not worth it?" "Its not that Steve. Its the after that I'm worried about-" "We'll help. Sam is a great therapist and Bucky knows her more than any of us. We can use the B.A.R.F technology and we'll be right there to help her with her nightmares and PTSDs" Tony looked at Steve and then at Sam, who smiled encouragingly and then at Bucky, who nodded "Really?" Steve smiled and kissed him "Yes, sweetheart. When we said that Tasha is part of the family, we meant it." Tony was so overwhelmed with love that he hugged Steve tight and Sam and Bucky joined the group hug. "Okay, okay, that's enough. Go and get refreshed, let's go for breakfast and we'll start digging." Sam and Bucky nodded and went back to their room closing the door behind them. Tony locked the door and picked up the file and sat on the edge of the bed flipping through it. Steve sat beside Tony and pulled him closer and pecked him at the side of his head "We'll find her Tones, I promise" Tony sighed but looked at Steve and gave him a small smile. Steve than plucked the file out Tony's hand "Hey! I was reading that!" "Rest for now, Tony. And I haven't seen you for the past 3-" " 2 days" "For the past 2 days, and I need you" "My,my...what a dirty mind do you have, Captain" Steve's eyes clouded with lust and Tony smirked. Steve loved when he called him by his title. "On the bed. Now." Steve growls while shedding his clothes off. Tony smirked and lazily walked to the top of the bed and presented himself on the bed like a French model. "Look at you..beautiful.." "You wanna come up here and unwrap this beauty or are you gonna stand there and gap at me" Tony teased while beckoning him with his index finger. Steve prowled towards Tony like a predator scaring its prey. What started as a light brush of lips turned into a full passionate make out session. Steve plunged Tony's mouth with his tongue, tasting his insides and tickling his tongue while his hands roamed around Tony's body. One by one, Tony's clothes came off and both were naked. Tony gasped and moaned as the proximity made their cocks brush against each other. Steve trailed his mouth along Tony's jaw, neck and collarbone and started sucking a bruise their. "Hnng..Steve...I..I..need you..." Tony said between his breathy gasps and moans. Proud of the bruise on Tony's collarbone, Steve started trailing his lips down Tony's body while whispering "I got you, sweetheart..just...relax...". When Steve reached the vee of Tony's hips, he looked up at Tony and his cock stirred at a new pace. Back perfectly arched with his mouth hung open and tanned skin golden from the sun rays, he looked like a goddess. Trailing his fingers on the underside of Tony's cock "Tell me what you want.. sweetheart?" "You...you..hnngg...only you...in..in..me" Steve smile and kissed the head of Tony's cock and went lower. No words were passed between them as Steve worked Tony open with three fingers, Tony withered on the bed, moaned and gasped when Steve manage to find his prostate. Tony's cock was painfully hard and when he reached to hold it, Steve pushed it aside "No touching yourself, let me pleasure you" "Steve...please...m'hard....need...need you..." "Patience...sweetheart....." once Tony was open enough, Steve lubed his cock and gently pushed inside Tony's hole. Steve eyes snapped shut and his upper body hung low as Tony's heat enveloped him. "More..more..Steve..please" Tony was a babbling mess and Steve pushed in. Slow rhythm paced fast and Steve was slamming into Tony hitting his prostate with each thrust. Steve then grabbed Tony's cock and pumped it with the same pace "Steve!...m'close....m'gonna..gonna..Ah!...come" "Come for me sweetheart..let go.." and Tony did. Stripes of come splattered on his stomach and Steve followed soon after and filled Tony up.
Halfway to Stark Industries, her phone rings and she takes a peek at her phone and sees her husband's name on the caller id. Ahana smiles adoringly before connecting her phone to the car's bluetooth and answers the call. "Hey, husband of mine" she coos sweetly and Bucky chuckles at the other end "Morning, wife of mine. Missed you this morning.:" he says and Ahana hums apologetically "I'm sorry, babe. I had a call for an early meeting and I had to go. Investors meeting, I miss one and the whole building will come crumbling down" she jokes "Don't sell yourself short, doll. You're doing great...he'd be proud of you, ya know?" he softly says and Ahana's eyes water "Yeah, yeah..he'd be proud" her voice cracks "Today's the day....isn't it?" he asks softly and Ahana hums. The car is silent as she parks her car in her designated parking and turns her engine off, sighing heavily and leaning back on her seat, eyes closed. "Sweet thing?" Bucky calls and Ahana hums again "I just really miss him...like I keep thinking that, maybe I didn't give up easily, maybe he would be still alive-" " Sweet thing, don't even go there. You did not kill your brother! We checked every nook and cranny and we couldn't find him, so it's not your fault, never was" Bucky says sternly and Ahana hums before taking a deep breath and fixing her hair "Kayh, babe. I'm late and I have to go, I'll call you when I finish work." "Kayh, love you" "Love you, more" she says and ends her call.
Entering the building, she smiles at the receptionist when her PA comes bustling in, her hair harried and her high-heels clacking loudly on the granite flooring. "Kat, you okay?" she asks as she eyes her up concernly and Kat looks at her, her panic welling up. "One of the investor canceled on the meeting but now we have two site meetings AND a conference call to Japan-" "Kat, Kat. Relax, take a deep breath and look at me. Okay? Now, slowly, one by one" Ahana soothes her and Kat takes a deep breath before straightening up and looks at Ahana "One of our investor, Mr. Akino, canceled the meeting this morning, so we can push forward the following two site visits-" "To?" "The new Stark Medical Centre building site and the existing residency building site-" "And how is the progress?" "It's going well, the framework is done and they want you to see it before they seal it off with cement" "And then?" "And then, you have a conference call with Ms. Debowski-" "From?" "Russia, she wants to discuss about some funding issues and its urgent, according to her" :"Mmm" "And then you have the shareholder meeting at level 6-" "Time?" "Afternoon at 4" Kat finishes and switches off her StarkTab and looks at Ahana. " So far, this is today's agenda, but, I'll let you know if there's any shifts in it" "Then, okay. You're dismissed" Ahana shoos her off as she enters her office and places her bags in one corner and starts her coffee machine.
Tony slowly awoke the next morning, sun rays shining from the floor-to-ceiling window panes and light chirps from the birds outside. Tony blinked a few times to remove the excess sleep staggering in his eyes and snuggled deeper into the blanket to enjoy the morning. It was a very rare thing that Tony get to enjoy the Earth slowly coming alive, constantly plunged by nightmares or arm deep on a project for SI and the Avengers. Today however, he was lucky enough to not be waking up to the blaring of the Avengers alarm but to the sounds and sights of the early morning of New York. The arm tightened around his arms and soft and warm kisses were planted on his neck and shoulders. "Morning, sweetheart" Steve greeted him with his sleepy voice, deep and cracked at the edges of the sentence that made it more sexy. "Morning, babe" Tony answered back while rolling around the arm to face his husband. Sleep soft with an adorable bedhead is the Steve only Tony get to see "Keep using that voice, and I might consider a morning sex" Tony quipped. That made Steve fully wake up from his slumber with a mischievous eyes and a smirk. Long, thick fingers traced Tony's spine until it reached the curve of his ass. Tony shivered but stopped Steve's wondering hand. "I said I'll consider, I didn't say I wanted it." Tony mock scolded him. Steve pouted but Tony firmly shook his head. "Still sore babe, not everyone has fast refractive period like you." Tony leaned up to kiss Steve in apology and Steve willingly opened his mouth in a sigh and let Tony explore his mouth with his clever tongue. Pulling away, Steve asked Tony "So, what's your agenda today?" while still tracing Tony's forearm with his fingers. "Actually...." Tony slowly started but stopped. "Sweetheart? What's wrong?" Steve asked but Tony remained silent. Tony squirmed against Steve, but Steve knew his husband in and out so he remained silent until Tony sighed and continued "Actually, I was thinking that it's time for my twin sister to meet my family." Tony finished and looked at Steve expectantly. "You mean, you want to go see Tasha's grave together...?" Steve asked and Tony started rambling "It's stupid, why do I have to come up with this kind of ideas, I just ruined our mode, It's okay if you say no-" Steve kissed him quiet "It's an awesome plan, babe. I actually wanted to ask you that yesterday but it was too early. Of course we can go visit her grave, she's family too, Tones. So, let's get ready and inform the team!"
Tony woke up gasping for air. His right hand automatically reached for Steve but found it to be empty.
"You’ve given me a reason to succeed, a reason to better myself, a reason build and keep relationships..."
” and JARVIS detached the left arm plate and shoots off only to come back and pull Tony out. Once out, the arm reattaches back “
. Steve stood up from his seat and swooped Tony into a long kiss that left both of them breathless while Bucky walked over to Tasha and planted a light kiss on her cheek careful not to mess up her makeup. The duo then said their goodbyes and walked out of the compound driving off in Tony's Audi Spyder R8.
"Hey, baby boy...you okay?" she asks softly and her wolf whimpers but rolls over and Ahana checks him over but no injury and Ahana sighs, her head woozy from the blood and her eyes slowly as she slides to her side and passes out, armor and everything.
"Just..seeing you holding the baby, cooing at the baby just...I don't know just...if there was a medical miracle, ugh!" Steve grumbled and slumped his shoulder against Tony's shoulder. Tony ran his fingers through his hair "Unfortunately, there is no way I can get pregnant but..we can adopt though" Steve looked up at Tony with a glint of hope "Really?" "Really, really" they stared at each other before bursting out laughing. A baby it is.
Steve slowly opened his eyes and blinked a couple of times to adjust himself to blinding flourescent light. He wetted his lips a few times and gulped his saliva a few times before "T..Tony?" he crocked. Bruce who was sitting at a far corner reading with his Starkpad, looked up and walked over to the bed. "Hey, Steve." Bruce greeted. Steve looked up and smiled "Hey, Bruce, where's Tony?" "He is at Morristown Medical Centre." Steve instantly shot up from his bed but another wave of nausea hit him like a wall "Easy..You're just recovering from nausea" "But, Tony-" "The doctors are looking after him, he's still in surgery, once you get back to your feet, we can go see him" 'But I'm okay" Steve said while standing up only to hit the bed again. "I think from now on, let me be the judge of that. You have to rest Steve, once you are deemed alright, we can go and visit Tony" Where's Bucky?" at that Bruce's face sobered "He..he and Nat broke up." "Jesus, how?" "Bucky told about Yele- Tasha and Nat got mad that he lied...and she..left" "Can..can you call Bucky?" Bruce smiled fondly and swept a stray piece of hair from his forehead and nodded. Bruce checked his vitals one more time before exiting the room. After a few minutes, Bucky entered, his condition far worse than him. His eyes red rimmed, his hear a mess of tangles and his posture of submission all felt wrong to Steve's eyes. Bucky sat on the chair Bruce sat and finally looked up at Steve "Well, you look like shit" Steve teased but Bucky only smiled at it "Oh Bucky..." "I messed up Stevie..I just ruined the best thing that happened in my life.." "Buck, can I ask you a question?" "Yeah..sure" "Could you, if possible, still have feelings for..Tasha?" Steve asked slowly. Bucky stared at the bed linen picking at the stray piece of wool sticking out. "Buck...?" "Yeah..maybe..I dunno..it's..it's complicated" "I think you still do, if not you won't hang onto the last piece of her to get her back" Bucky sighed and nodded "Yeah..it's just the love I had for Tasha is completely different to the love I had for Nat." "In...which way?" "Its..I loved Nat not only for her beauty but of who she is in the inside, she is fearless, compassionate, caring and..she really took care of me...but not like Tasha.." Steve nodded in understanding "Tasha knew me inside and out, she knew my strength and my weaknesses, my good days and my bad days, what triggers me and what doesn't, she was my sanity back in the facility..no matter how many times they wiped my memory, she was constant, whenever they released me from the Dark Room, although I don't remember, my heart does and without thinking, I'll be there and she'll be there for me.." "Then why Nat?" Bucky huffed in a bitter laughter "Losing her was like losing a part of me...I was so lost and Nat was the one who came close enough to Tasha, I was happy, or atleast that's what I say to myself, but every time we get intimate, it's like...I'm not clean enough, too many secrets and...most of my heart still belonged to Tasha.." "So..you guys never had.." "Sex? Nope. I never felt comfortable...and then when things were going smoothly, she comes back. Tasha comes back and my stupid heart just holds..just holds onto that last piece of hope that I'll get her back...so, I didn't want to hurt Nat..so.." Bucky flailed his hands as if it explained the rest of his words. Steve exhaled and swung an arm around Bucky's shoulder "You know..for all the talk that you and Tony are not the same person, you guys have someone common" Bucky lightly smiled "Yeah..that's her, that's Tasha, she influence people in her life, whether she knows it or not" Bucky then suddenly turned to Steve sharply and stared hard at Steve "Tell me. Tell me going after Tasha is the right thing. Tell me breaking my relationship with Nat is a good choice." Steve pondered for a while "Buck, you said yourself, if Tasha is the one you're most comfortable with then go for it, but. Talk. Talk to Nat. Explain why and get in good terms, the more you let your breakup stew, the more she'll resent Tasha and..it won't be pretty" Bucky sighed in relief and slumped against Steve "Yeah...Tasha makes me...well, me". Just then, the door swung open and Bruce poked his head inside "Surgery successful, we can go see Tony."

It takes almost three weeks for Ahana to recover and she's putting on her shirt when Natasha comes in, a gentle smile on her face "Hey, how are you?" she whispers and Ahana nods "I'm better...not fully recovered but I'm better" she says and Natasha hums, sitting beside her on the bed. Both the ladies look at the other bed, Tony sleeping peacefully in it "What's the doc saying?" Ahana asks "He needs more time here, his body is still weak and they found slight injuries, so they want to keep him under observations" she says and Ahana nods. "I know I do not look like a sister who just lost her brother, being all cool and stuff, but I can see how panicked all of you were, yesterday" she says "The strain in Steve's eyes and Rhodey's voice confirmed it and me adding it? Nah, I'd rather help to cure my brother than be worried and useless" she continues and hops off her bed and walks towards her brother's. She gently takes her brother's hand and places a light kiss on it and pecks his forehead, running her fingers through his hair. "You know, its okay to worry and grieve, that does not make you useless,
” “Tony? Oh god Tony, I’m so sorry I just wanted you to be safe-“ “Hey, sweetheart relax, I’m not mad…it’s just the heat at the moment you know…I’m not mad at all. How are the kids? Dodger and Figgy okay?” “They are fine Tony…where are you? Everyone misses you like a limb here and we couldn’t track you with FRIDAY” “I….I’m at Stark Towers…” “Why? Why are you there?” “Sorry Steve but I have to do this on my own…I…I need to find Tasha” “Then let me help you, please” “You saw what happened at the graveyard, Steve…one wrong move and I’m going to lose her again” “I just wanted you to be safe…she…she had a gun right at your head..and I…I could have lost you…” “And that is exactly why I need to do this alone. No matter how I approach her, she’s gonna point the gun at my head but she is my sister and I’m a genius, I’ll find a way, Steve, you have to trust me in this..” Steve stayed silent for a while then “Fine. But the minute I sense you’re in danger, we’re coming for you and if it means taking down Tasha, then we’ll not hesitate to do that.” “Deal. Now actually, I wanted to speak to Barnes. Can you give it to him?” “Tony.” “Barnes. Hey, I need a few informations outta you, first of all do you know Tasha?” “Yup. Met her at the facility.” “How…close were both of you?” “Quite close, best friends I suppose.” “Do you know about Extremis?” “Yeah, kinda, after the super soldier serum ran out, some guy named Hammer came and saw Zola. Said he wanted to perfect the Extremis serum. Zola perfected it and took advantage of it. Double crossed Hammer and injected it to the next set of assets. Tasha was one of the first ones” “And what body part did Tasha was missing?” “Her chest was covered in glass pieces and doctors tried to take it out but failed so kinda stuffed a metal case surrounding the heart to prevent the glass from piercing her heart. Extremis regenerated her skin so the new skin grew on top of the glass pieces, enveloping it, and she didn’t need the metal case. Full of scars after the surgery” Tony closed his eyes and took a deep breath “Thanks Barnes, pass the phone back to- Barnes? Hello? J, what’s wrong with our communication?” JARVIS was eerily silent. “J, JARVIS!” Tony scrambled to the lab to only find that the door was locked. “Hey! Open up!” suddenly the flat screen in his room turned on “
Mrs. Maria Hill was a strict looking lady, tall and thin. Her dark blue blouse and pencil-cut skirt enhancing her tanned skin. Her dark blond hair tied back into a lazy bun. She entered the class with a beaming smile as the class scampered to their seats, the class silencing down. Mrs. Maria scanned the class and started looking at each and every student. She then put her books on her desk and took the black marker and started writing on the white board. Capping the marker back, she turned back to her students "Hi, everyone." she greeted calmly which the class chorused back a 'Hi' and silenced back "I'm Mrs. Maria Hill and I'm your class teacher for this year long. I'll be also teaching you Science this year." she said gently and the students nodded. She then sat down on her chair "Why don't we break the ice first?" she said which a sandy haired boy raised his hand "We get to break ice?! Wow!" and Mrs. Maria laughed, her laughter warming Tony's insides, making him relax a little more. "No, my dear boy, breaking the ice means we get to introduce ourselves to the class and we get to know each other" Mrs. Maria explained which the class bursted into giggles and a distance 'oh man' was heard. She then pointed her palm towards the far back of the class "Why don't we start with you?" . The skinny blond boy Tony saw earlier shuffled to the front "Hi everyone! My name is Steven Grant Rogers! I live in Brooklyn! My Ma's name is Sarah Rogers and she is a single mom. She is a nurse at a hospital. Oh! and call me Steve" the boy- Steve -finished and the whole class clapped. Steve gave him another smile before walking to his seat.
"Tasha, Tasha, listen to my voice, concentrate to my voice" James. That was James's voice, she struggled to concentrate to his voice when the same voice mocking her was louder. "Tasha, I know you're strong, listen to my voice, look at me, Tasha, look at me" Tasha strained to keep her eyes open but fought through it "Tasha, open your eyes, don't close it" James kept repeating it but it was for vain, the other voice was stronger. Tasha shook her head, trying to get rid of the voice but nothing. The voice was there laughing and mocking him. Then, her body was carried and another shot of sedatives coursed through her. she lost consciousness and the world blacked out. Bruce locked Tasha into the cryo chamber and started it. The pod instantly froze with Tasha's body inside of it and the last thing Tony saw before Tasha hid inside was a small huff of "Tony..." Shutting the machine and transporting it to the other cryo chambers and locked the room shut. Tony's knees buckled and Steve automatically caught him, tears streaming through his eyes and staining his cheeks. "I..I thought..I thought she was back..my sister was back.." Tony rasped through his hitched breath. "We'll get her back, don't you worry, she will be back. She's a Stark, Tony, she'll come up like a phoenix, trust me" Steve placated Tony. The rest of the team members gathered around the couple, offering their words of comfort. No of them knew, that Bucky entered the room and stared at the cryo chamber which had Tasha. He walked towards the pod and rested his forehead against the cool metal. His enhanced hearing could pick up the faint thumping of her heartbeat. Closing his eyes, his index finger tapped following each of her heartbeat, tears staining his cheeks.
The whole room was dead silence before both Tasha and Tony shrieked and ran to their partners, jumping into their arms and kissing them senseless. "Yes" Tasha whispered into Bucky's lips. "Yes, you big sap" Tony rasped to Steve and peppered his face with light kisses. The rest of the team celebrated in joy, jumping up and down, throwing their wishes at the newly engaged couple. And if FRIDAY took a picture, of the two couples staring at each other with love and adoration, no one has to know.

Bucky's house was packed with guests from his childhood right up to his army buddies, fixing his metal arm for one last time, he answered the door to see Steve and Tony and their family. "Hey! Come on,come in" Bucky and Nat greeted at the front door. The family shuffled inside the house and Tony immediately went to the crib and saw the most beautiful baby girl. "Wow...." Tony whispered as he gently touched her supple cheeks "She's a beauty isn't she?" Bucky said as he came behind Tony and he hummed in agreement. "What's her name? "Scarlett Maximoff Barnes" Bucky said with a beam as Tony turned to look at him. Bucky's eyes watered nonetheless "That's the least I can do to make her presence known" and Tony and Bucky hugged, both of them mourning for a lost best friend and first love.
Tony missed his family and Steve like a limb but he surged forward to get back his sister. The elevator stopped at his lab and the doors swooshed open. His lab was exactly like how he left it 5 years ago, bits and pieces of his latest armor, SHIELD files on Bucky Barnes, a copy of the Sokovian Accord with its pages haphazardly on his desk and a glass of half-filled scotch still sitting on it. Tony dusted the cobwebs hanging around and punched his security code.  "
is the other thought that comes in his mind and he snuggles further into the human- he doesn't know her name, was it Ahana? Whatever -thus, his human.
". Tony slowly came to consciousness "All right, all right, shut the alarm, J, I'm up. It's hurting my eardrums" The suit's thrusters immediately shut off and Tony was plunging fast and deep. Hitting the ground with a loud thud, Tony groaned in pain and blinked his eyes to force his brain to come online. "J, open up the suit" the suit opened up and Tony immediately sat up only to encounter, silence. "Uhh, J, where are we? Not near New York I'm guessing" "
Not as angsty as I thought it would be but, it's like the starting of the angst-o-rama, kinda, I'm still figuring out.
Ahana is mindlessly searching through the internet when an idea comes to her mind. "J?" she calls out "Yes, Miss Stark" JARVIS replies softly, as to not disturb the wolf on her lap. " Has there been any news on runaway animals? Dogs? Canines? Wolfs?" she asks and JARVIS searches quietly and finally projects his findings "As a matter of fact there is. 15 reports of a runaway wolf spotted in the City Hall Park and the Colombus Park" "And no one took action on it?" "There was also a similar incident last year, another runaway wolf but it turned out to be a massive dog. The owner turned up minutes later" "Show me that incident" and JARVIS screens the detailed report and the picture of the dog and "That looks alot like my wolf" Ahana looks down at her wolf sees alot of resemblance and she gasps "J? Where did they take the dog?" "There is no report saying that the dog is safely at home and...it seems like the family didn't even exist" "Huh?" "The neighbourhood the owner stayed, claims that the house he was staying was homely but the minute he got the dog, the next morning, it was empty" "Like no one lived there, or..." "Lived there long enough to get to the dog" "Wolf, it's a wolf. It's to big for a dog"
Bruce and Ahana chuckle before Bruce shifts to the wolf's leg and takes a look at it. Bruce gently presses the wound and slowly lifts the leg and turns it gently left and right and hums. "How bad, Bruce?" Ahana asks worriedly "No broken bones but his ligament is a little torn up, but, don't worry no surgery needed, for now I'd recommend a cast and plenty of rest, it'll heal up in a week or two" Bruce says and Ahana sighs in relieve "Oh, thank God". After the check-up, Bruce packs his things into his bag and takes a seat beside her "So, what now? That leg will take at minimum one week to heal and you can't keep it at you office" he deadpans and Ahana sighs "I don't know, I'll just bring him to the compund" "And the rest?" "One way or another, they'll know, so, better let them know now." she says, petting the wolf, the wolf rolling over and nuzzling his muzzle into Ahana's blouse, rumbling happily. Bruce chuckles "He really loves you, huh?" "Yeah" Ahana answers with a smile. Bruce checks his watch and curses before hugging Ahana "I have to go, another appoinment with doctor but let me know if there's any discomfort, kay?" "Yeah, sure. Hey, how's the surrogacy?' "It's okay so far, they planted both mine and Thor's swimmers into Jane's egg, now its the waiting game. Today, he wants to inform whether the fertilization is succesful or not" he says. "Hmm, good luck anyways and yeah, I'll inform if anything" she says and Bruce kisses her head once before exiting her office. "Guess now it's just me and you, huh baby boy?" she says, scratching his head and the wolf whines as an answer.
Driving towards the venue, Tasha reached over and laced her fingers with Tony and gave a squeeze. Tony momentarily turned towards Tasha and gave a quick smile and squeezed back her hands. "Thanks for..trusting me" Tasha suddenly said in a soft voice and Tony stopped at the red light and turned towards Tasha "What do you mean, sis?" "I mean..if it wasn't for you or Bucky or Steve, I..I wouldn't have come this far in my life" "Hey..you're family..and family members stick together, no matter what" Tasha leaned over and kissed his cheeks and Tony continued driving. After a while, Tasha cleared her throat "Hey, Tones?" Tony hummed telling her to continue "How...how did you know Steve was the one?" Tasha asked in a soft voice. Tony turned towards Tasha with a knowing smirk "Why..?" "Uhh...I mean, like how did you know that it was Steve that you'll be living for the rest of your life?" Tony's smirk changed into a shock and he gripped her hands "Am I thinking what you're thinking..?" Tasha blushed and looked down at her lap. Tony then parked his car in the VIP parking and fully turned towards Tasha and used his other hand to lift Tasha's face to look at him "Hey..I think he'll say yes, I mean you guys were pretty much together for a very, very, long time, so..I think..I..I'm happy for you Tasha..you both deserve each other" Tasha looked at him with tears in her eyes and hugged him tight. "Okay, okay, my makeup is going to be ruined, let's go!" Tony and Tasha laughed and excited the car and headed to the auditorium.
checked. She turns back at the barista and he winks at her, his smile brightening even more. Ahana looks back down at her cup and huffs out a laughter and turns back at him, and lifts her left hand and shows him her diamond-gold wedding ring.
), and Wong – walks away so that he can pull the flip phone out of his pocket. He hesitates over Steve’s name, looking down at the screen. Steve eagerly picks up whenever Tony calls with a new location for them to meet at – but will he pick up the phone now? Now, when more is riding on this call than a nice meal and a quick fuck?
There’s only one contact in the list, Tony stares at the name and the string of numbers beneath it. Steve, it says – not Steve Rogers, or Captain America – but Steve. Perhaps… Tony reaches up and rubs at the edge of his jaw, scratching through the neatly trimmed hair.
Steve’s hands drop away, and he looks at Tony, his expression one of tortured guilt. “You were going to kill him, Tony. I had to stop you – Bucky is a part of me – and I know I can help him get back to how I knew him. I couldn’t let you take that chance away from me, even if…”
“We’re not,” Tony says with a smirk that Steve can hear more than he can see. “But I sleep alone a lot these days. I sleep better when you’re there – though I won’t say that in the morning, you can bet your ass.”
Tony laughs giddily, covering his hands with his face. “Christ, Rhodey, I think I’m going crazy. I really think I’ve lost it. One too many hard blows to the head.”
Tony finds his attention straying as Steve gives a thorough debrief, a bowl of soup is placed in front of him – much more interesting than whatever inspiring drivel Steve is coming up with. Tony’s spoon clatters out of his hand and into the bowl when Peter Parker’s smiling face is projected in front of them.
“You idiot,” Tony seethes, shaking Steve by the front of his shirt. “You absolute – you could have been caught! And then what was I supposed to do!?”
“You’re not doing anything, Steve,” Tony leans up, his hamstrings trembling at the effort, and kisses Steve softly on the cheek. “I’ve still got my arms around you, remember?” His sweaty fingers dig against the soft skin at the nape of Steve’s neck.
Another gulp of vodka down, and now he stands in front of the fireplace, Steve’s dog tags clenched in his fist.
Tony watches him as he drags a chair over towards where he’s sitting, and Tony’s expression is inscrutable. Sometimes, Steve finds cracks in the façade – sometimes. Like when he’s drinking a bottle of beer, and Tony’s eyes fixate on his lips as he takes a sip. Or when someone says something funny, and Tony turns to Steve with a grin, his eyes bright with mirth. Steve had never thought twice about those little cracks, those little tells – but now he’s thinking over every time Tony’s gaze had lingered on him.
Steve cradles the necklace against his chest, and he can’t bring himself to look into Tony’s eyes, can’t bring himself to argue.
Tony pauses, though his feet don’t falter despite his hesitation. He looks up into Steve’s eyes, his smile tinged with regret. “You have my apologies, Cap.”
His socked feet curl over the edge of the roof, gazing down at the ground below. His brain, always working – never at rest, calculates the various trajectories of falls he could take.
he’ll say, his voice quiet. Steve will begin to hear the gears shifting in Tony’s brain, the endless amount of ideas taking shape simultaneously.
“Why did you come, then?” Tony snaps, taking another gulp of wine to fortify himself. “Don’t answer that.”
“There, all done. You could’ve done that yourself.” Tony picks up his gloves, holding one under his arm as he works the other onto his hand. “You can get your gloves on yourself,” he says over his shoulder, leaving Steve alone in the locker room. “Get me a mouth guard, will you?” Tony’s voice echoes into the room, Steve sat paralyzed on the bench. “If you knock a tooth out of my mouth I’ll kill you.”
Tony is back on his feet, moving to the foot of Steve’s bed, he’s suddenly filled with excitement. “You could come with me!”
Now it’s Tony turn to ogle Steve shamelessly as he swallows the oyster, and there’s color high in his cheeks, a slight smile on his face. He’s had a lot of time to think about this – them – since he abandoned Steve at the cottage.
Tony reaches up slowly to rub at his upper arm where Steve had grabbed it, gently brushing his palm over the fabric of the jacket he’s wearing. The movement draws Steve’s gaze to the faint light in Tony’s chest – and that’s not right, Tony didn’t have a reactor anymore. He had seen the evidence of its removal himself.
“I want.” Tony steps into Steve’s space, crowding him. His hands reach up, cupping Steve’s face as he leans up on his tiptoes (
“Do you think — You can say no. In fact, if you say no, you’ll spare me from any further embarrassment, but… Look, I haven’t been sleeping. So, I was wondering —.” Tony grimaces, looking away. “Do you think I could sleep with you tonight?” The words come out in a rush, said on one breath of air, and Tony deflates slowly afterwards.
Steve laughs, tipping his head back against the pillow, but his laugh turns into a choked groan as Tony drags his fingers over him slowly.
Steve wakes with a start, his heart pounding in his chest, Tony’s blood still warm on his hands. Tony had said his name with his dying breath, his blood bright red as it bubbled on his lips. Steve holds his head in his hands, breathing in deeply, feeling the sweat cool on his skin. He had rented the cottage for three nights, naively hopeful that Tony would stay with him – that he wouldn’t be sleeping alone in this bed.
“I know,” Tony says quickly, “I know, you can’t bring yourself to do this. You’re grieving too, I know. Somehow you lost the love of your life and gained your best friend back from the dead all in one day.”
His eyes are focused on Tony’s hand, the pad of his thumb brushing over one bruised knuckle, hearing Tony inhale sharply.
“Tony,” Steve chides. “You’ve practically adopted Peter Parker. What about that kid in Tennessee. Harold?”
“You can stay with me. Of course you can stay with me, Tony.” Steve’s thumb brushes over the backs of his knuckles, feeling Tony’s grip relax, hearing him sigh quietly. “Is that alright?”
Tony spasms against him as Steve’s teeth sink into the juncture of his neck and shoulder, feeling Steve’s hand slip down the front of his abdomen and under the waistband of his shorts.
“I love you.” It’s so easy, so true. Tony has not said that to Steve since the first night they shared together, mumbled sleepily against the other man’s chest when he thought Steve was asleep. Tony had thought it many times, and Steve had said it to him – but now Tony says it and means it.
“Yes,” Tony says, shrugging out of Rhodey’s grip – he has to pack. The address Steve’s neat script had written out seems to be residential. He’ll scrutinize it on the flight there. “But I’ll try not to break my previous record of incredible stupidity.”
Tony scowls at him, but he doesn’t pull his arm away. “Missed you, you idiot. Of course I missed that too, but that’s not why… I wanted to see you. Found your address. I was just indulging in a little bit of liquid courage before coming to see you. Meant to order an Uber. Got a bit too drunk – those guys must have followed me once I left the bar. They said my name, I turned — no one has called me by my name in a long time – and then, bam, bat to the head.”
“Anything earth shattering?” Tony pulls back the comforter to slide into the bed beside Steve, but he’s not fast enough. Steve’s eyes travel down from his face, to his chest, to his abdomen, lower – lower – and then back up to his face in a flash. He’s blushing, Tony realizes, and Tony isn’t.
Steve leaves Tony where he’s sat on the toilet, pressing the button of the clippers off and on idly, the machine vibrating in his hand. He takes two minutes to wash the kitchen scissors with soap and hot water, scrubbing almost as intensely as Tony had done with the dishes.
When Steve opens his eyes, it takes a moment for his world to come into focus. He reaches up slowly, rubbing at them, trying to blink away the gumminess. He’s not sure when he had fallen asleep – Tony had kept him up until daybreak. Not just with sex, though that had taken a lot of the time – with slow kisses, and secrets. Even after Tony had fallen asleep, his head tucked under Steve’s chin, arm sprawled across his chest, Steve had stayed awake. There was so much about Tony that he didn’t know, so much that he wanted to know – but he had learned a little tonight. He had learned how Tony stole the blankets in his sleep, how Tony would murmur a word every now and again, his mind always working. Plus, he had discovered how satisfying it was to hear Tony moan his name, bordering on a sob of relief.
He sits on the bed and reaches out to brush Peter’s hair out of his face. It’s a few seconds before Peter’s brown eyes pop open. He reaches his arms out for Steve to hold him as soon as he sees him. Steve opens his arms and Peter gets out from under the covers and climbs into his lap. Steve encases him in his arms and kisses his forehead. “Good morning baby.”
Tony spared no expense in the bathroom, the shower was big enough for five people. Marble hexagon tiles and oil-rubbed bronze Shower heads on both side and a waterfall shower head right in the middle. Steve only had the one on, he was trying to take a normal shower. He would have been happy with a tiny fiberglass shower with just enough space to turn around.
“Shh you’re alright,” Tony consoles him and looks over at Steve worried. Steve is scooting over closer to him and wrapping his arm around them.
“Pete,” Tony says as he rubs his eyes before holding out his hand and motion for Peter to come over.
“I hope not. He was really drunk when I put him to bed—” Peter’s eyes are drawn to the empty gin bottle sitting on the counter, “—I think he’s still asleep.”
“Well actually—” Steve begins as he makes everyone stay on the call for another ten minutes. The meeting ends and the intern promises to send out the meeting notes after he finishes editing them. He stands up to check on the children again wanting to make sure the swelling on Beverly’s eye was going down. He’s disappointed to find Peter out of time-out and playing with his toys in the middle of the room.
“Later,” Tony says as he closes his laptop and sets it on the side table. He gets up and sits opposite of Peter on the rug. “What do you want to build, kid?”
Peter moves away from Steve and buries his face into the couch cushion. Beverly pulls the ice pack away from her eye and holds it out ot her brother. “Here, Peter take this.”
“That’s actually a good idea. It will give Tony a chance to rest,” Steve says as he stands up. Steve walks with Tony back to the car and kisses him goodbye before rejoining the group.
“Liar. You were in like second grade. Threw up in Art class and they called Dad. Steve was out on a mission. Dad was too busy to pick you up so he sent Happy.”
“That’s not fair. He was my Daddy first! You’re taking him away,” Peter cries before trying to fight his way back up.
“They’re calling for rain. Probably in the next hour,” Steve says referring to the weather channel. He had the television on, he couldn’t stand the silence of the house.
Steve goes into the bedroom and sees Tony sitting up and looking at something on his phone. He wipes his face off with a towel. “‘Morning Tony.”
Steve pushes his hand away, pausing to rub his thumb across Peter’s palm. He drops his hand and starts to rub his back. Steve’s body stops fighting sleep and his mind starts to drift. Peter had finally gotten quiet and Steve felt so relaxed. Being home, feeling safe, and surrounded by the ones he loved.
Jerry walks over to their desktop computer and turns it on. “He’s definitely married to Steve. But who is Steve? Do you think he’s an Avenger?”
“I didn’t? I thought I did on the phone earlier. A little girl. Here,” Steve takes his phone out and projects the image into the air. He scrolls through it, the one from the file, and ones he’s taken in the facility.
“Tony, I never left the bed and he told me he didn’t know if it was me or you that took him outside.”
Steve takes off his shoes and hangs his keys on the hook. He looks over at Peter and puts his hands on his hips. “What are you doing up so late?”
The words sting even though Steve knows he doesn’t mean them. It’s just a kid upset he’s not getting his way and lashing out. He pinches the bridge of his nose in frustration and takes a deep breath. “We do not throw things. Get over here and pick up your shoe.”
Peter shuts the lights off and heads upstairs, pausing outside of the guestroom. He knocks on the door and waits for his sister to answer. A minute passes and he leans his head against the door and knocks again.
“We’ll get the kids in something private. Where celebrities send their children and everything is kept as private as possible.”
Tony wondered what Steve had said or done to trigger it in her. Or maybe she was just a kid realizing her mother wasn’t really coming back. That this home wasn’t a temporary and fun get away.
Tony hangs his head in his hands and Peter’s sharp cries break the silence. Crying like he’s in physical pain like he’s just been hit. Steve’s eyes immediately shoot to the rear-view mirror. He had to stop and find another way to deal with his anger. He was scaring his son and he never wanted his son to view him like that. He returns his eyes to the road and reaches for Tony’s hand and holds it tightly. He wanted to squeeze it so tightly that all the delicate bones snap. With his super human strength he could do it easily. Tony was his husband and he could never hurt him. He couldn’t live with himself if he had. He pulls his hand up to his mouth and kisses it. He lets his hand go and glances at him for just a second.
Tony gets down on his knees and rubs her hair off her forehead feeling her body temperature. There was a thin layer of sweat and her skin was warm to the touch.
It’s dark by the time they get to the house. The tires rolling over the gravel driveway wakes Peter up. He hears the slamming of car doors and his uncle Ben’s voice.
“Morgan! I told you to go to bed twenty minutes ago and that better not be my phone in your hand. Who are you calling this late?”
There was a lot of down-time on missions and Steve had recently discovered social media. So he spent a fair bit of time pinning various ideas he came across on Pinterest. The muffin tins was one of them. Each compartment he would filled with a different fruit or snack. Since he now had two picky eaters he had to get creative. Peter is still attached to his side as he starts to assemble them.
Beverly, feeling guilty over the fight with her brother, had spent the last hour cleaning up their place. It seems Peter was feeling the same way since he came back with food as a peace offering.
They sit around the hospital bed and set up their card game on Peter’s tray as they wait for the doctor. He mostly keeps up but seems to get confused and frustrated.
Tony kisses him and Steve tastes whiskey on him then and he wonders why he didn’t smell it earlier. The salt air was overwhelming his senses perhaps.
Tony was trying to keep his hand in one place but he really wanted to feel Steve’s skin. To touch the taunt muscles under his shirt, so he slides his hand up there looking cautiously at Steve to see how he’ll react. Steve lets out a soft groan but makes no move to stop him. So he lets his hand wander up his chest to tease his nipples hard, down to his belly to run his hand through the short stomach hair at the top of his boxers.
Peter looks up at the woman before running over to her. There was something about the energy she gave off, it felt safe and warm in her presence. She kneels before him and looks him over, pushing his hair from his forehead. “You poor thing. She’s hurt you. You’re just a babe,” she says ignoring the creature’s comments.
“Move over,” Tony says as he lies down on his side next to his son. “Turn around. Come on. Be my little spoon.”
“What do you think, Pete?” Tony asks as he pulls his shirt over his head before instructing Peter to lift his hips so he can slide his pants off next.
“Just sit still for a minute,” he teases as he rolls her onto her back and tickles her sides. She squeals and giggles loudly.
“Steve, this one from you?” Tony asks as he picks up a thin box wrapped in white paper with glittery snowflakes on it.
Steve zips up his bag and observes the room. Peter finally squeaks out an apology and Tony lets him go. He wipes the tears off his face and turns to head upstairs. He cries out as Steve grabs him and pulls him up into his arms. Peter reluctantly lets himself be held. “I know you’re mad at me and I’m sorry it has to be like this. I love you son.”
Tony pats his back but can’t find the right words to comfort him. He held him and listened to his husband’s soft crying. No tears come to Tony’s eyes and he didn’t really know why he wasn’t crying. Perhaps it was because one of them had to hold it together. If Tony could be strong for Steve it would pull them through like a compass guiding a traveler.
“Papa,” he calls over and over again as he comes into the room. Tony opens his eyes as Peter nears the bed. He worries his son is sleepwalking. He lifts up the blankets, scooting over and coaxing Peter into bed. He pulls him to his chest and kisses his forehead. “Papa isn’t home baby. You know that. Daddy’s here. Shh…don’t cry.”
The mood has changed and the evening now feels somber. Peter looks up at the windows that are level with the ground, watching the snowfall and build up. He had to tell someone else. Like a hot potato he had to pass it on before it burnt his hands. Who would he tell? It was too late to call anyone. MJ was already in bed, she had poked her head into the basement to tell them not to stay up too late after she had returned home from a book club Christmas party.
“Love you, kid,” Tony says as he leans down and kisses his forehead. Steve is next as he places a kiss on his cheek and whispers, “I love you.”
Steve’s heart is beating so fast that it feels like a cartoon one beating out of his chest. He wonders if he’s having a heart-attack. If it’s even possible with the serum. His left arm didn’t hurt, it had to hurt didn’t it?
“It’s no problem. We’ve been sitting in the sunroom watching him play with our dog for an hour now. Throwing the tennis ball and playing chase. Poor Bailey doesn’t get to play as much. We’re getting too old for it. What’s your boy’s name?”
They walk back to the kitchen. Steve grabs a couple six-cup muffin tins and sets them on the counter. Beverly is sitting at the table. Steve opens the fridge and pulls out some plastic containers full of cut fruit. He nearly trips over Peter as he goes to put them on the island.
Steve glances back towards the bed one more time before leaving the room. Tony and Peter were still soundly asleep. He goes to the kitchen and grabs a cup of coffee. They had been staying here long enough for him to figure out how to program the machine, so coffee was ready when he woke up. He carries his mug into the sunroom and settles into one of the overstuffed chairs. He pulls his phone out of the pocket of his pajamas, and scrolls through his contacts until he finds Sam Wilson. Tony gave him a hard time for putting full names in his phone. His husband’s phone was full of nicknames he had made up for people. Steve always found it maddening when he had to use Tony’s phone. Sam was currently Flyboy in Tony’s phone or at least last time Steve had checked. He didn’t know how many times he had changed his own from Captain Spangles to Hubby. Tony was always changing it back.
Peter was excited when he checked his email at school and saw that his 23andMe results were finally in. He had sent the test in months ago. He hadn’t told either of his parents about it and sent it in in secret. His biological parents died in a plane crash when he was four and he entered the foster system shortly after that. That all before he came to live with Tony and Steve. It had been many years since he had been adopted and he was now in high school. He couldn’t remember his grandparents and most of his relatives. Once a month his Aunt May and Uncle Ben would come by for a visit. There were usually gifts and one of his parents were always present. Sometimes they told him stories about his parents. He remembered being younger and finding it upsetting.
“God, I don’t…” His fingers thread through Steve’s hair, it has a bit more length now, sighing as Steve’s beard scrapes against his throat.
“I couldn’t stay,” Tony sets the cup down. “Well, I guess that much is obvious, since you all woke up and I was gone. I just knew I had to disappear – I couldn’t… I was so mad at you, Steve.”
She’s there – copper hair, freckles, Givenchy perfume. Tony melts into her embrace, burying his head against her neck, Pepper’s capable hands there to hold him upright. Steve’s jaw sets –
Tony looks down at where Steve’s fingers are brushing over the veins on the back of his hand slowly. The pad of Steve’s thumb brushes over a scabbed-over cut on the knuckle of his middle finger, Steve is used to these workshop accidents that riddle Tony’s body with bruises, cuts, and scrapes.
“Bastards took my wallet – took everything. They recognized me, Steve, I couldn’t think of any number to call. Just yours.” Tony’s voice wavers, and Steve trips as he puts on his sweatpants – Tony is crying.
“Print media’s still a thing?” Tony asks, reaching out and poking Steve’s newspaper in the center of the front page. “Or do you order it special?”
Tony eventually raises his hand to cover his eyes, fingers curling against his skin as Steve drags the razor through his hair. He can feel long curls of it flutter against his chest and back as they slip off the towel.
It’s a come-on, but Steve doesn’t think that Tony truly means it. Steve knocks the oyster back, hoping that he likes it better than the wine.
The letter might as well be poisonous. It’s completely impersonal, and Tony reads over it twice before setting it aside, swallowing back bile as it threatens to rise up out of his stomach. It’s the type of letter you would give to your coworker, not the type of letter you would come up with for someone you supposedly loved. Captain America’s shield strikes him in the chest again, and he closes his eyes against the pain – the office phone ringing, and ringing. The phone call with Ross doesn’t make him feel any better, in fact, it’s just another layer of betrayal. Steve had broken his buddies out of the Raft – fine. But who was going to catch the real heat for it? Tony, of course it would be Tony.
Steve sighs, running a hand over his face, fingers scratching at his beard. He’s not tired, but he doubts he’ll see Tony for at least twelve hours. Inwardly, as he makes his way to the bedroom beside Tony’s, he hopes the man will stay for more than one night. He hopes his admission will be enough. If he can’t get Tony’s forgiveness, at least he will be able to get Tony’s acceptance – and maybe that will be enough for them.
Tony shakes his head now, and there are more tears trickling from his eyes, Steve does his best to wipe them away. “Hate them.”
“Have you ever actually been on a vacation?” Tony brings Steve’s hand up to his mouth, so that he can tear the tape with his teeth. He grabs his right hand, holding his breath without even realizing it, his fingertips gently brushing over the calluses on Steve’s palm before getting to work.
“The kid said no, then?” Steve is surprised by that – Tony had been so excited to offer Peter a spot on the Avengers roster, he had made the kid his own suit.
He had effectively ignored his father’s grave, like always, but sat in front of his mother’s and pulled any stray weed that dare interrupted Maria Stark’s eternal rest.
The flip phone vibrates violently in Tony’s hand, and the missed call screen is wiped away as Steve’s name lights up the screen. Incoming call, Steve, 2:30 PM.
“I’m just entertaining myself, Steve – enjoying the holiday, you know.” Tony’s not sure why he’s not being honest with Steve, why he doesn’t just come out and say that he’s considering blasting his own head off because he’s so
Steve runs to him as he staggers down the steps of the Benatar, taking Tony’s right arm as Nebula holds firmly onto his left.
“Tony,” Steve looks at him, taking inventory. His brown eyes are hidden behind dark sunglasses, and his goatee is impeccable, but he’s swaying with the light breeze from the air conditioner – dead on his feet. “You look -.”
“I thought that you had come to terms how they died, Tony – I didn’t want… To upset you more, to… I thought it was a kindness, I really did. I didn’t want to hurt you.”
He’s sick of being sent on wild-goose chases around the world: a tall blonde man seen here, a girl with glowing red hands seen there. He’s also sick of Ross’ idle threats – though not so idle anymore, Ross had told him with a scowl that were Tony to continue failing to find the ex-Avengers, he’ll be incarcerated in a matter of months. Tony’s not sure when he accepted this responsibility for other people, but he’s done being a babysitter, and he’s done placating his baser desires of a quick and rough fuck from Captain America
“Can you give us a sec, please?” Tony snaps at Red Skull, and the figure disappears in a cloud of smoke.
Steve doesn’t get up from his chair, instead, he watches Tony as he tans. The sunlight catches the beads of water on his chest, and Steve’s eyes follow them as they trail down Tony’s abdomen, glinting in the curls of dark hair that spread down below his navel, and are eventually absorbed by the fabric of his Speedo. He watches Tony even after he’s fallen asleep, mouth slightly agape as he snores. Tony is a restless sleeper and he tosses and turns on the chair almost violently – Steve reaches out and rests his hand against Tony’s shoulder, making sure he doesn’t fall off the chair. Tony grumbles in his sleep, leaning in to Steve’s touch, but Steve pulls his hand away.
Tony’s fingers finally grasp at the edge of the shield, it’s too heavy for him to pick up now, he had exhausted all of his strength dragging himself over to it. His father had exhibited more care for this shield than he had ever exhibited for his son. He had made replica after replica, though they were never right – he had displayed them in his office. One time, Tony must have been seven or eight, he had climbed on top of his father’s desk and hoisted one of those shields down from its place on the wall. Howard was supposed to be gone for the rest of the day, and Tony had people to save – not real people, of course, Tony didn’t have many friends in the neighborhood (none, in truth). On shaking legs, he had managed to climb down from the desk, his arms trembling at the weight of the shield held out in front of his chest. How could Captain America hold onto this so easily, sometimes with one(!) hand, his father had said. The smooth metal slipped from Tony’s sweaty fingers, and he gasped, ducking down to grab it. The shield was caught before it hit the floor, and Tony was eye level with the shining black leather of his father’s shoe. Before he could blink, the shield was brought up quickly, Tony saw his own reflection in the metal as it struck him in the face. Howard had picked him up by the collar of his shirt, the fabric nearly tearing in his hand, and had physically thrown him out of his office without another word. Maria Stark had found her son sobbing in the hallway, one of the framed pictures that had been hanging on the wall shattered on the floor beside him, having fallen once he had struck it. Her gentle fingers had brushed over his swollen eye, his aching cheek, and she had ushered him to the kitchen without looking back at the office door.
