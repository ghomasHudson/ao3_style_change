Sherlock               Nodding, I pull myself up a little, "Maybe this man would get your favourite takeaway from that Chinese on the corner and allow you to put some of those idiotic spy movies on you enjoy without complaining...much?" I hesitate, then lean forward slightly, feeling a need to confirm, "Just to be sure...I am this man in question, correct?"
Mycroft                 "Rosie's room." I nodded in the direction of her room. "Don't be too hard on him, John. He's punished himself enough over the last 30 minutes. And Rosie is probably still sleeping."
Sherlock               I'm unsure how to react to this man who resembles my brother but who is emotional, wistful and even a little regretful. Leaning to refill my wine I swallow a mouthful, then finally speak, "You...liked her?"
Mycroft                 "Sleep... yes, we will sleep..." I mumbled. I turned my head and kissed Lestrade's wrist lightly. "Sleep, my love..."
Mycroft                 "And you don't think I'm capable of that?" I raised an eyebrow. "I assure you, Lest- I mean, Greg, I am quite adept at focusing on the task at hand without allowing... sentiment... to interfere." I snapped.
Sherlock               Pulling back a little, I flounder. The shallow waters of emotion that I'm usually comfortable in have been left behind a while back and I feel like I'm floundering in shark-infested waters now, "Let him what?"
Mycroft                 "I admit, I am not," I mumbled, nipping his neck lightly. "Am I distracting you?" I grinned. "I can stop..."
Sherlock               Squeezing Mycroft's hand, I don't speak, just stand there for a few moments holding it. My head is slightly bowed before lifting, staring intently at my brother with a range of emotions in my eyes from worry to fear to fondness.
Greg                      I roll my eyes and put my hands on my hips, waving for the chefs to get back to work. "That's what they were trying to say. That's why they were trying to stop you." I explained.
Rosie has inherited the Watson temper and the aim from both her genetic parents. The walls of the kitchen are now decorated with lunch. -SH
John                      “Because, I want to. I’m doing what I want for a change.” I put my hand on the door handle.
Greg                      "Hey, it's alright, just take deep breaths." I said soothingly when he grabbed my arm and I half crouched so he could keep his eyes on me while John finished with the bandages. I multitasked in watching him and John, smiling at Mycroft now and again.
Mycroft                 I sat dumbfounded for a moment, then stared into my nearly empty cup. "I... interest you..." I repeated cautiously.
Mycroft                 I recoiled. "I will take my chances with a scone, then. Pickle juice sounds positively horrifying." I reached into the bag and broke off a piece of a scone, nibbling on it experimentally. It was excessively sugary, but not bad.
Greg, I heard you were in DC. Is Sherlock with you? He’s not answering my texts.
Greg                      "Hey... you trust me, don’t you? Who would you rather have driving with Sherlock in the passenger seat? Me or a complete stranger that will push him out while we're still moving just so he'd shut up?" I smirk, holding the phone out of Sherlocks reach
Sherlock               There's a visible lump working up and down my throat, my eyes widening before I manage to stammer out, "The...the texts? Distracted you?"
Mycroft                 I walked over to the bar in the corner. "Care for a drink, Lestrade? It's early here, but late enough London time..."
Police here must be related to Anderson. -SH
"Yes Daddy. Then he can make all the tea for our parties."
Mycroft                 "I honestly had no idea who would be taking the position."
Mycroft                 I woke early the next morning, drenched in sweat, and with Lestrade asleep in the chair next to my bed, his hand resting lightly on mine. He stirred as I moved my hand away.
Greg                      I narrow my eyes slightly to read him, to see if he's just putting it on but I sit down opposite him when I see nothing of the sort. I folded my arms still, trying to calm my anger down to let him explain.
Greg                      "I want you to take me... please... Don't touch my cock at all…" I said as I threw my head back again as he ground against me and all I was focusing on was me and him rather than what was going on outside the door. I opened my eyes back up when I felt him still, seeing his eyes peering down at me.
Rosie                     "...mess!"
Carlton                 I fight back a chuckle at Rosie's words, "Quite right, the pretty man is helping your uncle to feel better and get stronger." Then lowering my voice so hopefully only Gregory can hear me, "Please relax Mr. Gregory. Mr. Reed and I will be out of here soon and you can take care of Mr. Holmes again. I don't want to be too presumptuous, but you make a lovely couple."
Sherlock               Nodding, I look rather satisfied and content, lifting his hand and starting to inspect our entangled fingers, "I've kissed people before but for cases. That was my first kiss with emotions involved."
Sherlock
Mycroft                 "They were certainly in a hurry to leave" I smirked.  "Hello, Rosie my dear. Come for a visit, I see”
Mycroft                 "I will not leave, and I will not ask you to go. I... " I swallowed, "I love you." I couldn't remember the last time I'd said that to someone other than family. But I could feel in my heart that I meant it.
Anthea
Sherlock               Glancing at Lestrade I pick up my coffee, sipping it and leaning back as all trace of my 'friendly' persona flee
Greg                      "So, what did you think of what we watched? No 10 is my favourite doctor with no 9 coming in very close behind." I smiled as I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and thought it was very domestic with one of our rarer days off.
Sherlock               Taking them I nod, then add, "You're not sleeping with Gary, are you? There's no 'supplies' in the bathroom. I just looked."
maybe the man asked him to the museum but John didn't know it was a date. I know I've been invited places and didn't know it was a date until someone tried kissing me. GL
Greg                      I wanted to scream but didn't want to attract attention to where we were, just having two cigarettes angrily pacing around the garden before I got too cold and had to come in. I found Mycroft still in the kitchen but sitting at the table with his sleeves now rolled up.
Mycroft                 The morphine was putting a pleasant haze over everything. Best of all, the pain had ebbed to a dull ache. I looked into Sherlock's eyes, swirling with colors. I blinked slowly several times, until my eyes were too heavy open again, and I drifted off.
Rosie      "Is Unca Myca and Unca Gayg not a popper famly cause the don't have rings or bees or a puppy?"
Rosie                     "Daddy. I want to stay." Daddy has his no look. The No Look. "Can I come back tomorrow?'
Mycroft                 It felt good to be able to relax, and laugh. In London, I was always under an inordinate amount of pressure to perform, and this trip to Washington was far from a pleasant experience. I took another bite of my meal, and pushed it away.
Sherlock               Grabbing the photo and my phone, I text Lestrade again, throwing open the hotel door and bounding into the corridor
Sherlock               Yelling back at Lestrade when I see him answering his phone I snap, "Can you please not have phone sex in front of me right now. We have a murderer to catch."
Greg                      "Do you mind if we walked back? I kinda want to stretch my legs a little." I almost broke out into a full-blown grin at how much more relaxed he looked and loved his giggle. It made my stomach flip over.
Drop Rosie off? Where are you going?
Greg                      "Thank you. I guess. Now, because of the smoking, you, you idiot, have given yourself a chest infection." I explained as we made our way down the hall and Mycroft seemed to be smiling a bit more than usual. I guess the fever would do that.
came on by Boris. It was an odd song that he'd heard a while ago but had downloaded, him having an idea that would drive Mycroft nuts.
Greg                      I turned my back on Rosie and folded my arms, "Yes, a car is coming to pick me up in about an hour so we could move some of my stuff into your house. And the medical equipment will be moved in while you're still here." I explained.
Rosie                     "Ok. Bye bye, Papa. Les go Gahm."
Sherlock               Pouring the hot tea for myself and Mycroft I give him a roll of my eyes, "I'm the very picture of innocence. John only says these things in a loving manner I'm sure."
John                      “That’s good, Mycroft, very good. You’re at the hospital and you’re safe. Try to rest some.” I squeeze his forearm.
Sherlock               Peering out the window I narrow my eyes, "There's lots of people here. Buying organic things."
James Morgan            "Is he one of those people who are too smart for their own good? It takes a good person to be patient and compassionate enough to be friends with that type of person.  How long does this conference last? If I recall it was something about Military Medicine...?"
Greg                      I also asked Michael to send the take out upstairs when it arrived, asking them to just order the best pizza in town and to just bill me. I walked round to his suite door and knocked gently holding the letters with a few files.
Greg                      I felt his cock stiffen and then his cum spraying over the back of my throat, my hand holding his hip, so he wouldn't hurt himself. I pulled my mouth back with a small noise and looked up at him again where he was trying to get his breath back. I loved how rough he looked.
Nina Boucher      "So who are you guys?" as I walk in and sit at my desk and gesture for them to sit on the leather sofa along the other wall. It's a small and cramped office with the desk pushed against one wall and a tall bookshelf filled with cook books in the corner.
Sherlock               "Actually..." my whole persona changes slightly, shifting into my rather bumbling, charming 'normal' man as my smile widens, "We were hoping we could have a chat with you. Brad, right?"
Sherlock               Chuckling, half in relief, I nod, "John. Are you...not not gay now?"
Sherlock
John                      I rub my hand over the back of my neck, Bashful, that he saw right through my crisis. “Thanks, James.” I disappear into the cab, pulling out my phone to read all of Sherlock’s texts. Shite. I scrub my hand over my face.
I know that but do you want him to be more than your best friend? GL
Greg                      "Okay, I'll stay but you've got to get some sleep." I said slowly as he held my hand to his cheek and I was holding my breath a little, it seemed very affectionate coming from a man like him.
John                      I jump up and start pacing. “Shit! Sherlock, what am I going to do? I don’t date men!”
Mycroft                 Rosie plopped herself down on the sofa, pulling the blanket up around her, and started watching the movie, still sniffling. I watched as her eyes slowly got heavier, and she fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of the movie. "Seems all the crying took a heavy toll on the child," I smiled, nudging Greg so he could see her sound asleep.
John                      “Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes. You might have heard of him. We’re kind of famous in London.” I wince.
Sherlock                       Spinning around on my heel I peer at my brother, wary and suspicious. As usual I find it difficult to read him but there's something there, something new and strange. "There's something you're not telling me Mycroft. You even asked for my help earlier."
Mycroft                 "You're not going anywhere," I said, pressing my lips to his neck.
John                      “It sounds like he was trying to reassure you but you weren’t listening. And Rosie will be fine. She’ll be no worse for the wear.” I bring my hand up to brush through Sherlock’s curls this time.
James Morgan      "Be still my beating heart!! Please tell me you have a picture of that! A Doctor. A Soldier. AND Adorable! You really are something special." I take a pic of John in the chair. "Sally would you take a picture of us?" I lean down next to John when she tells us to get closer."
John                      I run my fingers around my waist band of my pants. “Do you want me to... go wash a bit? Maybe you could do it for me. So, it’s to your satisfaction?”
------------ FINIT-----------------
Mycroft                 I glared at Greg when he told me to calm down. The fire in my eyes dimmed and I took a more relaxed posture as I pushed my emotional turmoil back out of the way. "Apologies," I said quietly, almost calmly. "I can schedule a meeting with Mr. Morgan first thing tomorrow."
Surgeon                "Yes, barely. The bullet missed his heart, but not by much. The tissue damage was pretty extensive. His collar bone is a mess - practically shattered. The next 24 hours are critical."
Rosie                     "Gayg! Your puddin' is here and ready for hugs. Up up up "
I have never had so many friends. You and John. I am unused to such abundance of friends. I shall attempt not to scare you away also -SH
Sherlock               Gasping, I lean closer too, speaking loud and very fast, words tumbling out over each other, "You've been shot in two places but you're alive and we're here and Lestrade is here but I'm not sure he counts and Bee is also here but you threw him to the ground."
Sherlock
Mycroft                 I leaned back in my chair, my hands covering the book on my lap. "I should have done better."
Greg                      "So it's all sorted." I smiled and knew we weren't going to be discussing it with Mycroft and I wondered what his opinion on it would be.
It’s just a saying, he's very hungover. What do you need my help with anyway? GL
John                      I let my head fall back on the couch. “Oh god.” I moan out. I look down to see a mess of curls covering his face. My cock hardened in his mouth at that. What was it with his hair? I reach out and ran my hand through it. I wonder if that’s what Sherlock’s hair felt like. The image that it was Sherlock between my legs flash through my mind. That caused my cock to pulse again. I wanted him. Sherlock. Why of all times? Now? Did I realize this? My phone vibrates somewhere in my pocket. I remembered the look in his face when I left him in the room. My phone vibrates again. He always needed me. What if something had happened? What if he went out on the case on his own? And needed me? What if he was actually in trouble? Panic started to rise up in my throat. I felt myself start to go a little soft at my distraction. James had to have felt it too.
Sherlock               I look truly miserable, standing there holding Rosie, covered in vomit and nearly as in pieces as she is, "I need to get her to the hospital Mycroft. I'm going to take your car."
Greg                      "Thank you. Just don't go out of your way to get them, if they're evidence then make sure Dimmock has them for as long as he needs." I relaxed and ran a hand through my hair where the calmness was coming back. I was my usual self again.
Greg                      "Right… how explicit? And it’s written in a different hand." I said lightly as I looked over and kept my wine glass in my hand where Mycroft obviously didn’t want to get close tonight.
We know he's still in Scotland but it's possible he could have left Dundee or even be travelling back to England. Remain on lockdown. I'm forwarding his details to Anthea now -SH
Greg                      "I know, I know… he was shot in the chest I think, I stopped the bleeding with my jacket..." I sighed when he pulled back to look at me and my shirt was scattered with it. My jacket had been left on the floor by the paramedics and you could see splashes of blood on my trousers.
"that was almost as bad as mine!"  He's finally starting to relax... Early in the show I whisper a joke about the Big Bang. We spent the rest our time there whispering stupid jokes and giggling like kids.  I grab his hand. "It's time for the Shuttle Tour! Let's go! Allonse-y!" I notice he doesn't grab my hand in return. "It's a bit crowded in here. Do you mind if I hold your hand? I don't want to lose you in all these people."
Mycroft                 I level Greg's pistol at James carefully. I see a momentary look of panic, then calm, cross Greg's face. I take careful aim at the part of James' shoulder just visible near Greg's, and squeeze the trigger. My ears are ringing from the blast, and I see that both James and Greg are on the ground. I drop the gun and run to the pair.
Sherlock               My lips curl up in what is technically a smile, reaching to grab the shears which are presented to me and stepping forwards to the ribbon, muttering out of the corner of my rigid lips, "I'll have to plan my revenge on Mycroft carefully."
Mycroft                 I threw down my paper on the coffee table. "May I go for a walk?" I said sarcastically. "In the garden. I promise not to lift anything." I needed to clear my head, get some fresh air. I was unreasonably upset right now.
Anthea
Mycroft                 "Greg is just as frustrating as you are, Anthea." I scowled. "It's almost as bad as being at home with Mummy." I coughed a bit. "Now what am I signing?" I sat at my desk, looking over the paperwork she'd brought.
Greg                      I cough a little and wretch but don’t bring anything up, my hand wiping my mouth and I soon found a nurse that would lend me a pair of blue scrubs since my clothes were now technically evidence because I'd been standing next to Mycroft when he was shot.
Mycroft                 I rolled my eyes again, and did as instructed, changing the angle of the screen so she was visible in the camera. I Then followed Greg out of the room
Sherlock               My nose twitches, a little smile on my lips as I deduce that the man in front of us is likely just an idiot
Mycroft                 I paced in my office nervously, stopping to look out the window at the waning sunlight. The city looked so peaceful at dusk, but I couldn't enjoy it...
Dillon                    My hands are warm and smooth as they grasp Mycroft's arm, lifting it very slowly as I test his reactions and pain thresholds, my voice lower and nearer his ear now as I start to work his body, "You should never hate any part of your body. It's yours and you should be proud."
Sherlock               Jerking, I raise my hand to the back of my head, staring after Lestrade in stunned amazement, "You hit me.... wait!" Grabbing the paper bag containing my honey I race after Lestrade, attempting to regain my dignity, not realizing my hair is raised at the back of my head now in a pronounced quaff.
Sherlock               Squeezing his hand again I hold it for a while longer as he sleeps, watching him carefully, before finally sitting back down and retreating to my mind palace... after making sure Bee is firmly still in place
Mycroft                 I laid back on the bed, my head foggy. "Couldn't have been... you work magic in the kitchen... you are kind, strong... handsome... you have all the right qualities..." I said, my eyes closing. The room seemed even colder than before, and I shivered harder.
Sherlock               Pulling John into my body I growl into his ear in a low, silky voice, "We're having sex."
Mycroft                 "Still, it's better than my usual fare. I generally end up ordering take away... not a lot of time to cook."
Greg                      I began to relax when I had the feeling that Mycroft wasn't going to stop things this time, my hips shifting against his so he knew exactly how much he'd been driving me insane. I moved my hands on his hips to his arse where I gave more than a generous squeeze.
Mycroft                 Closing my office door, I stopped and took a deep breath. My mind was positively racing. I had known Lestrade for a long time, though only in a professional capacity. Today's revelations put him in a whole new light, and a flattering one, at that. Looking over at the bar, I was suddenly glad Sherlock had taken the bourbon decanter - though my brain was willing, my stomach turned at the thought. I was being honest with Lestrade when I said I'd never considered a male partner. Perhaps I should reconsider...
Greg                      "I know, it was just my mind playing tricks on me." I whispered and I smiled when I felt his good hand rubbing my shoulder, trying to ease the obvious tension from them.
Mycroft                 I could see the tantrum brewing on her little face, and looked at Greg in a panic.
Greg                      "And you're gonna have to stay with uncle Mycroft a minute while I sort out dinner.." I grinned as I walked through, also needing to set the table for all of us
Greg                      "I'm fine Myc... Honestly, I'm alright…" I tried to soothe him as the medical team descended on me to cut my shirt, bandaging the wound from the bullet and then looking at James to see getting him into an ambulance
John                      “I’m headed to the clinic. Call or text me if you need anything.” I say to Mycroft as I head towards the door.
John                      I smirk and shoot a glance at Greg.
Mycroft                 "Dinner that doesn't come from a hospital kitchen sounds excellent," I said, relaxing a little bit. "What did you have in mind?"
Sherlock               Resisting John's pull, I try my best to escape his grip, trying to storm into the bedroom more, raising my voice to a bitter snap, "What are you doing with Lestrade? Don't you dare upset him!"
Is Rosie sleeping yet? We need to say goodnight -SH
Greg                      I chewed on the gum for a few minutes and I thought I'd been reading but I'd been staring at the fire, my ears perking up when I heard the door open and closed again. I smelt the nicotine from where I was sitting but kept quiet as I turned a page in my book. I'd also heard him coughing outside, the dumbass.
Greg                      "Well. Weird shit about me, saying I had nice shoulders, that I was kind, strong and... handsome." I stutter slightly, and my face goes the reddest it possibly could
Sherlock               I'm practically vibrating in my seat, wanting to ask questions and gripping my coffee with both hands. I remember my promise though and grit my teeth, breathing through my nose and allowing Lestrade to lead the questioning
James Morgan            "It's a date." I leave the bar and wait til I'm around the corner before I clap in glee. I whistle a happy tune all the way home. Now I just need to figure out who to call so I can get John on that Shuttle...
Mycroft                 "We cannot spend the next few weeks harping on each other..." I snapped.
Mycroft                 I should like to see Papa's toes, Rosie.
Rosie                     "But but but... Balloons?" Not liking Gayg’s answer I went to Unca Myca. "They’re just balloons. No reason to be scareded".
Rosie                     "He’s an ingenious bumblebee from the Sussex re... re... re... Area".
Greg                      "That’s fine, I usually just watched it at home anyway. You seen any of it before?" I asked with a small smile and I did have a bad gut feeling about him but thought he couldn't be that bad.
Sherlock               Twisting around more I sneer a little, "We're here not even a full day and already you've found a woman to seduce. I hope you're not planning on bringing her back here to our room."
Greg                      My heart jumped when he brushed his lips against mine but when he kissed me again more confidently, I leant into it with my eyes shut. It felt totally different to the kiss I'd shared with Peter and it felt a lot better. A lot more right. I wrapped my arms around his waist as his other hand cupped the other side of my face.
Mycroft                 I quickly looked away, turning to put away some of the paperwork littering my desk. "Was he able to give you the information you needed to begin your investigations? If he is choosing to be difficult about it, I'm willing to have a talk with him..."
Rosie                     "Bee loves you." Myca needs his cheek patted." Papa says we loves those dat need us and need dose dat love us." All this excitement has me sleepy...
Greg                      "I'll take a photo for Papa, shall I? I can tell him that you sent it for him to see." I said as I pulled out my phone and let her press the button to take the photo. It was a good photo, showing Herbert's fuzziness.
Mycroft                 The sommelier came to the table to present the wine selections. I blanched a little - alcohol was still an unpleasant thought. "Greg, would you like wine with dinner?" I asked.
Sherlock               "And where do I come into all this?" I shoot a glare at Anthea, "He's my brother after all?"
Mycroft                 I look at the bruise blooming on his face. "Did you win?" I ask with a smirk.
Mycroft                 I took Greg by the shoulders, and maneuvered us both to sit on the sofa. He started to say something, and I pulled him into a passionate kiss, effectively stopping whatever train of thought he had going.
Greg                      I sat down lightly and saw the hurt in his face, guessing he'd been close to this Ms. Smith but I kept my observations to myself. "And she was murdered?" I asked and just wanted basic details for now.
Mycroft                 "You are looking well, too, little brother." I leaned down to the toddler stuck to my legs. "Good afternoon, Rosie. How are you today?"
Mycroft                 My eyes follow Greg as he walks out of the room angrily. I had done my share of snapping at him over the last 3 weeks, but he'd never snapped back... "Rosie, why don't we go to the garden for a little while? You can tell me how many bees you can find..." I took the little girl's hand and we followed Greg outside. Rosie took off running toward the flowerbeds, and I sat with Greg in the gazebo.
Greg                      I had gotten an email about police officers needing to be at a reopening of a museum where a few people had made generous donations. I knew it was Mycroft and Sherlock, Sherlock and John stood on the steps ready to cut the ribbon while I was stood beside his brother to watch the crowd.
Mycroft                 "That was... so real..." I shook my head, trying to stop the images in my head. I laid my head on his shoulder, just breathing.
Greg                      I loved his laugh, the way his eyes lit up but I got on with taking his old bandages off rather gently. I didn’t often like talking about children and I met his eye when he asked me about them. I wouldn’t even know if he knew that I'd almost begged Caroline for us to try for kids.
John said his name was James. He wouldn't tell me much else. I'm going to search the nearby restaurants. John gets grumpy when he's not fed on a regular basis -SH
If you need me I can be there in ten minutes -SH
Sherlock               "Mycroft." I snap, waiting for the kettle to boil, "She doesn't need to know about -that-"
John                      I nod. “I can come by every day to check his dressings.”
Sherlock
Mycroft                 "Hmm." I nodded, returning to the paper I wasn't really reading. It felt like Greg had more to say, but was hesitant.
John                      I climb out of the cab and onto the pavement in front of Mycroft's house. I ring the bell.
Sherlock
Greg                      "You know what sort of person I am Mycroft. Everything I do, is because I want to do it and it means something to me. I wasn't going to shag you just because you threw a glass against the wall and yeah, I do feel sorry for you over the whole Ms. Smith thing but that's work. That's separate. " I explained and finished my mug of coffee.
Sherlock               There's a small, lost little note to my voice, "But we were going to go to the lab together and look at the emails for my brother."
Mycroft                 I coughed lightly - the smoke burned my lungs more than usual. My phone chirped, and I pulled it out, seeing a message from Sherlock.
Greg                      I put on my work face which was very stern, my arms folded across my chest as Mycroft sets up the laptop and Sherlock’s face pops up on the screen again. I sat forward slightly and saw John briefly in the background sleeping.
Mycroft                 I looked at Greg questioningly. "What's wrong?" I asked.
Nina Boucher      "I wouldn't know anything about that," I shrug and play dumb. How was I supposed to know that it was a poisonous flower Willa had brought me? It wasn't until I heard her coughing and then fall, that I rushed back into the dining room to see a shocked James getting up from his chair to go to her aid. I quickly realized what had happened and had to protect not only myself from being implicated, but more importantly James as he had an important mission to fulfill soon. While I was certainly supportive of their plans, I wasn't directly involved in them and only aware of it, so I could help keep an eye and ear on anyone getting wind of it. Our network was large but as far as I know James kept us all compartmentalized to protect us and the plan from failing.
Greg                      "And why does part of me not believe that? I know how hard it is, I've been trying to quit for the last 5 years and the furthest I've got is a month." I sighed as I motioned for him to sit down and my tone was still calm, but my face was stern.
Greg                      "I promise I will. You know me." I said softly as he got out of the cab and I asked the Michael at the Embassy to send the wine up ahead of me, so I could at least get back to my suite and change. I wasn't going to go as posh and just changed into some casual/comfy clothing
Greg                      "No, no, of course not. Any last tips, Anthea?" I shook my head with a smile and I'd been thinking that maybe a little time off wouldn't be a bad thing. I glanced up at Anthea.
Sherlock               "You are both still under house protection, correct?" Lowering my phone I give Rosie another gentle smile, nodding, "We also miss you. So much."
Mycroft                 I slowly rose from the table, slightly unsteady, but waving Greg away. "I can manage, Lestrade. Now if you'll excuse me..." I walked slowly to the bathroom down the hall to splash some water on my face and collect myself.
Nina Boucher  "Well I can't just walk away from this pot or what's in it will burn." I keep stirring the reduction sauce and call out in French to another cook to come take over making it. I carefully hand off control of the spoon and pot handle to him, never stopping stirring, and grab a towel from beside the stove to wipe my hands on as I walk towards my office. "This way gentlemen, and this better be important."
John                      “Oh. Sorry.” I did know what to say. I let my hands fall to my sides.
Sherlock               I begin muttering to myself, "I need to phone John...no, he'll murder me....but it may be dangerous to Rosie....but he'll be dangerous to me! She may be in danger...maybe I can phone one of the other GPs...no, they'll tell him..."
Mycroft                 I looked at Greg in surprise. "You've experience braiding hair?"
Mycroft                 "Did you and Caroline have a whirlwind courtship like that?" I asked, genuinely curious
Greg                      "I know you can be quiet, so I don't really know who's the devil here." I whispered as I fiddled with his belt buckle, pulling down his trousers and pushed forward on my knees so I could nuzzle around his thighs a little to tease him. It'd been a while but that didn't put me off.
Rosie                     "Gayg? Papa says you like my Myca. Do you?"
Greg                      "Got the evidence?" I asked as we both wandered out the front door and Sherlock’s long arm could easily hail a cab for us. I jumped in, trying to stay focused on the job in hand rather than the sights.
Anthea                  "I don't think you quite understand. You would need to be watching over him 24/7 until we catch the shooter. He is likely to try again once we take Mycroft outside the protections of this hospital. You'll move into a guest bedroom, but you will not be able to leave the house."
Sherlock               "Not evidence as such." My phone is pulled out, attempting for some reason to hide the screen from Lestrade as I start to swipe around, brows drawn together in concentration, "Suspicious emails sent just before her death. Nothing solid so far. I've isolated something in her blood though."
Mycroft                 "Perhaps not now, but things will settle down eventually. At least, I hope so." I grinned. I reached up and cupped his jaw, running my thumb along his cheek.
Greg                      "You know I can see straight through you as easily as you can see through me, right?" I squeezed his hand as he played the innocent act and I saw him grin then.
Rosie                     Pat Papa’s cheek "don be iddit" roll over and goes back to sleep.
Greg                      "Mycroft... stop...stop..." I had moved my arm out the way and didn't want to pull his hair, but I was so close. I didn't want to cum that way, his eyes seeming concerned when he pulled his mouth off me and wiped it with the back of his hand.
James Morgan      Obviously faking offense at his comment. "But it made you laugh a bit. I see that smile."
Greg                      "Nothing, I, just heard Rosie’s door and you need to be getting into bed anyway." I smiled softly as I got off his lap and helped him at least do his trousers up. I then helped him to his feet, trying to look tired.
Rosie                     "ITS GAYG, PAPA! Don't be an idjit.  Ok. Love you. Bye bye now. Don't forget Daddy's ring". I go to the screens camera and kisses it.
James Morgan      "How do you feel about deep fried bacon?" The look of shock was priceless.  "I'm kidding."
Sherlock               Leaning back in my seat a little I nod, my face calm and controlled, "I suspected as much. The letters in Russian, the flower...Nina. The police report is done with." Shrugging a shoulder, I continue bluntly, "No one beyond us needs to know your involvement. We do however need to know the name of her guest."
Sherlock
Greg                      "Yeah, the bees might have gotten her a little over excited earlier." I smiled as I took a sip of my own wine, pulling my legs up onto the sofa and I turned more towards him than the TV.
John                      We walk into the main hanger where there are planes parked on the ground and hanging from the ceiling.
Rosie                     "Where’s my tablet? I gots to show Myca pitchers of the pup he's getting me."
Sherlock
Greg                      "It's fine, I know sherlock winding you up stresses you out and I wasn't helping. God knows I'm the same when Adrian is around." I said softly as I took the toast out with cautious fingers and put the plate on the table, so he could start eating.
Sherlock               Rolling my eyes, I lean to try and grab the steering wheel, "Oh just let me park. You drive like an 80-year-old half blind woman with frontal lobe damage."
Inspector. Take care of my brother. He is not as strong as he believes himself to be. -SH
John                      I chuckle. “No, not here. Let’s go back to the hotel.” I lean up to kiss him again.
Greg                      I leave the coffees on a small table before rushing towards the kitchen, gun down the back of my trousers and I could hear swearing more than anything in the French. I poked my head round the door and let a few cooks out where the commotion was going on
John                      “Mycroft, part of this is your choice too. If you feel you need to stay a few more days, then you should.”
James Morgan     “Ok. I want you to keep a verrrrrry close eye on him.”
John                      “Still. Sherlock. Still.” I look around a bit. “What are we even looking for?”
Rosie                     Papa is sad. I stand on the seat next to him and pat his head and kiss his cheek like he does to me. "Dere dere. It's ok."
Rosie                     "More juice pees
Greg                      "Poison?" I question and smile weakly at the cab driver who looked concerned. I paid him when we arrived, my suit smart but it gave me room to breathe in the heat.
Mycroft                 I whimpered as Greg moved me to face him, and I was momentarily lost in his chocolate brown eyes. I stroked his jawline with my fingertips, seeing his questioning look.
Carlton                 "Ah I see the therapist has left. Are you ready for a trim Mr. Holmes?" as I grab my drape and gesture towards the chair. "I'm guessing you want your usual cut? It's been a while since I've done it, but I still remember," as I give a small smile.
Mycroft                 "It's OK. He is very tired. He can watch it with you again tomorrow." I whisper back. "We'll let him sleep for now."
John                      “I don’t need you passing out on me. Why don’t you lie back? The exit wound is just sutures so I don’t think I need to redress those.”
John                      “Sherlock, your coffee.” I say handing him his coffee, not giving him a choice.
Mycroft                 I read Sherlock's next message. "It appears Sherlock is planning for a longer stay. Will that be all right?" I was healing well, but still not up to 100%, and didn't want to saddle Greg with caring for two people.
Sherlock
Mycroft                 I just about choked on my coffee, and hoped that the redness in my face would be blamed on the ensuing coughing fit, not my embarrassment. "From the mouths of babes," I glared at Sherlock.
Rosie                     "Cause you love me, Gayg." Kisses "and I love you. Now, where's my cake? Papa says Myca always has cake."
Mycroft                 "It's not too late, you know. For adoption." I nodded, finishing my wine and setting the empty glass on the table.
John                      I thought about it and opened my mouth to say something and then snapped my mouth shut again. “I... thought you didn’t want... you weren’t... ready? You said you just wanted to watch...” I say with a confused look.
Mycroft                 "Is... Is Sherlock OK? I need to call him..." I started looking around for my phone. I was still fairly disoriented. The nightmare had seemed so real. Tears started to well up in my eyes.
Sherlock               "Feeling...?" I look confused before lifting my gaze, my eyes widening a little as I see James, spitting, "The not-date!"
Greg                      "Yeah, course it is. We've got a room set up for her." I shrugged and held his good shoulder with a smile as he read through Sherlock’s texts.
James Morgan      "What was his name again? Shirley? Shelley? I don't remember."
Mycroft                 I felt the message alert on my phone, and checked it, to find a message from Sherlock.
Greg                      "You'd think I was stupid if I explained." I smiled weakly and kept his eye as I felt his thumb rub against my hand. I reached over with my other hand to grab the bandages, so I could start wrapping him up again.
Peter Harkness    “Absolutely, there’s a great grill around the corner if you wanna walk and stretch your legs a bit?” I suggest, noticing he’d become a bit...sad maybe? Since emerging from meeting with Mr. Holmes. Tread lightly I reminded myself.
Greg                      "I know it’s been 20 years but.. telling me about her would help a little." I said more quietly as we ate and gave up on the whole date idea, knowing his head was elsewhere so decided to go with something he knew.
Peter Harkness    “I’ll just wait out in the hall for you Greg. Nice to meet you Mr. Holmes. Take your time” and I smile at them both before closing the library doors behind me.
Mycroft                 I leaned against the fireplace, my head in my hand, taking deep, shaky breaths trying to calm myself. I jumped a little when I felt Greg's hand move around my waist, and I leaned my forehead on his shoulder silently.
Mycroft                 "I think that's better than the nightmares, to be honest. I can't be waking Lestrade up at all hours..."
John                      “What was he correct about?” I ask shifting Rosie a bit, she was getting a little heavy in the position I was holding her.
I’m fine. I’m heading back to the hotel. Are you still there? Can we talk?
Sherlock               Watching his face I see when the realization hits, "There was no staff to clear the dishes after the meal. One dirty plate is still there which means that someone must have removed the other. " Turning back to the door I drop, "John, keep watch while I pick this lock."
John                      “No, I showed Greg how to redress the wounds. That way he can do it for you.” I suppress a grin, biting the inside of my lip.
Sherlock               Thinking a moment, I blurt out, "Oh! Not-Greg."
Greg                      I swung my leg over him so I could straddle him properly, arching my back when he stroked softly down my spine. I leant forward to only brush our lips together and just concentrated on his heartbeat against mine to get my own mind to relax.
Mycroft                 I started reading my book, occasionally looking up as Greg mowed the small lawn.
Brad Carter          "Lots of requests went through me. Can't remember all of them." There was that one weird thing.... "Wait. I remember. She wanted some sort of flower salad thingy. I delivered her mail earlier that day and one was a box from a florist in Russia. She said she had plans for it for dinner."
Mycroft                 "And now your brother... I'm sure that doesn't help." I said. "I never imagined my life with children, but spending time with Rosie... I can see the draw. Perhaps someday," I thought a bit wistfully.
Greg                      "Now if you need anything, you say now or just shout while I'm in on kitchen, okay?" I said softly as I made sure he was comfortable in the chair and gave him a smile to say I wasn't totally stubborn.
Mycroft                 I returned his crooked grin. "You knew full well - you were 5, after all. The bruise on my arm lasted the whole weekend." I took another bite of my meal.
No. Open the laptop I left with her and put it besides her on the bed. I'll read to her. -SH
Mycroft                 I raised an eyebrow.  "Given some of the things Sherlock has called you, I'm almost afraid to ask.”
The small audience in the club jumps to their feet with applause as Sherlock bounds on stage and sweeps John into his arms and they kiss for what to them felt like an eternity forgetting themselves and the others in witness. In reality they only kiss for a few seconds and then hold their foreheads against each other with eyes closed as the sounds of the cheering audience brings them back to reality.
Sherlock               My face contorts into confusion, then falls a little, "All I can think is him touching you. Wash, maybe?"
Mycroft                 Greg may have had a professional interest in joining me in my meeting with James, but I knew that part of his reason for being there was to make sure I stayed in check, that I didn't let my anger get the better of me. "Fine. Be here at 8:30am, then." I turned to my desk, and made a call to the Foreign Liaison's office to schedule the appointment.
Mycroft                 I look up at James and our guest. I rose from the soft leather chair, setting my now empty tumbler on the table. "Hello, Detective Inspector. I'm surprised to see you here."
Sherlock
Mycroft                 I picked up Rosie's empty bowl and put it in the sink as she slid out of her chair and ran after Greg, and I followed. I walked into the living room to find him frantically sifting through the boxes, photographs stacked on the table.
Greg                      I wasn't going to let what happened last night affect my professionalism and since sherlock was busy with looking at rare flowers/ingredients to put in food, I was merely Mycroft’s security for the day. I'd showered and changed into a light grey suit with no waistcoat or tie, my smile small as I came into his office.
Greg                      "I swear if your brother storms in, I'm not stopping.." I actually giggled with my eyes gleaming, them also watching Mycroft strip and then search the bedside table for what we were gonna need. I knew his younger brother had been the reason for the texts.
Dillon Reed, written by Lonewarg
Greg                      "That is a very bad word Rosie but I'll let you off for saying my name right." I held back my own laugh, picking her up and thought she was the cutest thing ever. I loved having her around.
You must also assist her in learning the exact species of bees native to the United States of America. She already knows British ones. It may help to test her on them. I have packed her cue cards -SH
Greg                      I'd looked up when he came over and hummed in surprise when he'd just grabbed my face to kiss me. I didn't understand but closed my eyes anyway, putting my hands around his sides.
Greg                      I felt my heart sink to the floor, my stomach churning and I had to blink twice at him before I could even comprehend what he'd just said to me. I could feel my face going pale and my mouth was just agape
Sherlock               His words finally reassure me, nodding and then leaning to try and slip her into his arms, whispering, "If you wish to spend some time away from me I understand. Mycroft has agreed I can sleep here"
Greg                      "I... uh... want... want to ride you." it was my turn to show the inexperience I'd had with men and I knew he hadn't heard with me by the way he met my eye again. It'd always been a fantasy of mine and I didn't want to scare him off now that we were here.
Sherlock               Shuffling from foot to foot I tug my coat further around myself, curling my upper lip and glancing at Lestrade, then back at Mycroft, before pausing, really staring at my brother, eyes piercing and attempting to deduce him
Mycroft                        "I did not orchestrate the murder of a high-ranking British diplomat in order to 'keep an eye' on your flatmate, Sherlock," I said darkly.  I leaned on my desk.  "Can you please keep yourself out of trouble?  I have quite enough to deal with right now." I sighed.
Greg                      "It doesn't matter. I'm just thinking generally." I shook my head as I leant against the sofa, pouring myself another glass of wine and because of the meds Mycroft was on, I was drinking alone.
Mycroft                 I sat back up, frustrated. "Greg, the very nature of your job involves a certain level of risk. So does mine. Do you think I would want you to stay if it meant your association with me endangered you?"
Sherlock smiles showing his phone to John as he hails a cab at the end of the alley. And then John feels his phone vibrate as it's still on silent from his time on stage.
Sherlock               Our eyes meet, my lips curving in a tiny little, real smile, "He seemed a respectable man. Is he your friend now?"
Sherlock               Jiggling Rosie on my hip I spit, "He's worse than you are Gary. He'll need my help." Pausing, I roll my top lip, "In fact, I'm surprised he hasn't contacted me yet."
Rosie                     "Ugh. Daddy makes the tea! Papa makes the..." What does Papa make?
Greg                      I was glad Rosie started to settle now and she seemed to run into the living room when I put her down to shut the door. The suitcases would have to go in her room
(a picture is sent of a rather blissed-out John sleeping, covers pulled up to his neck, still a slight smile playing around his lips)
Greg                      "I... don't think this is a good idea. Look, I know I was flirting with you a lot and I'm sorry, but I really can't mix work and pleasure.. It just makes things complicated.." I sighed as I stepped back and ran a hand through my hair, half of my buttons undone
Greg                      "A shower sounds good." I flashed him a grin before he went into his adjoining bathroom to start the shower, some wipes I'd found in the drawer cleaned up the small bit of lube on that before I joined him under the water. We were back with my head on his shoulder again 10 minutes later with both of us dozing off.
Anthea                  "Agreed" I state as I enter the room and little Rosie sees me and comes running and squealing towards me. I crouch down and catch her in my arms as she fiercely wraps her around me. Kissing the top of her head and holding her for a minute, I'm reminded of doing this exact same thing to my aunt Martha many years ago. I stand again when Rosie runs off to fetch a toy she wants to show me. "Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us, I need to discuss some work issues with our patient" and I give a slight smirk to Mycroft. "It'll just be a few minutes."
Lestrade. You know me. You know how insufferable I am to be around, even for short times working together on cases. John puts up with me constantly. He was not aware I was coming here. I followed him onto the plane and claimed his hotel room as my own. He may have been upset that I wanted him to spend time with me on his one day free from the conference. He seemed upset. I don't know how to fix things. I may be too late -SH
Greg                      "I'm sure she will and were gonna have a bit of pasta first and then we can make a cake tomorrow if you'd like." I raised an eyebrow at sherlock, knowing he was trying to wind me up but I was happy to have her whenever.
What if John doesn't want to be found? What if our argument was the last straw? -SH
Sherlock               Grabbing Mycroft's coat from the stand I start to go through the pockets before tossing it to one side, going to open the bedroom door and smirking at John, putting my finger to my lips, "Maybe I can get some pictures of Mycroft for future blackmail while we're here"
Greg                      "Well.. Sometimes we train new PCs so they don't get beaten up out on the street, stupid amount of paperwork but DIs mainly deal with the big cases.. Murders, homicides, that sort of thing.." I shrugged, smiling back at him.
Anthea                  Holding back a smile, "I felt his prior discretion in Holmes family matters mixed with his skills in protection would be ideal for this situation. Would you have rather had your brother here?"
Rosie                     "Gayg!" I run up to my other favoritest Unca. He lifts me up and swings me round like the dances I seen with Papa at the ballet.
Greg                      "You think I’m pretty?" I chuckled even more as Mycroft sat down beside us, taking a few photos from me to look at while I hunted through the box once again.
Turn on Skype. We need to speak to Rosie -SH
Greg                      "Did the surgeon say anything else to you?" I asked as we shuffled round to the private room next to the nurses’ station and I just felt like I wasn’t walking in my own body. It was an odd feeling.
Sherlock               Struggling, I yell, almost scream after the ambulance, "Let me go with him. Let me go. He's hurt."
Anthea
James Morgan      "Do soldiers do body shots?" Must. Keep. Innocent. Expression.  "Be right back. Feel free to look around." I know I have lime in my fridge. That and some shot glasses will be perfect.
Greg                      I'd never seen Mycroft approach me like that and I didn't even have time to kiss him back before he pushed me onto the bed. I put one hand onto the bed, the other going onto his good shoulder as he began stroking me again
Mycroft                 I jumped at the knock on the door. Setting my book down. "Yes? Is everything all right, Greg?" I said quietly. The door opened slowly, and my eyes met his.
John                      “Maybe but not for a few more days. Mycroft still need to be under the care of the doctors. He needs the pain management that the hospital is providing.” I say giving him a stern look.
Rosie                     "But what about our Myca? I bet he's hungry too..."
Greg                      "That’s what I thought. Lot of delegates are planning to arrive at the embassy on Monday afternoon for a conference over their economy… Communist-ruled countries." I explained from what I'd scribbled down on a piece of paper that I'd folded into my pocket.
Greg                      "One of you has to have sleep to look after Rosie so John, head home and get a couple hours.  You can come back then." I say rather more sternly than I meant before shuffling off to find me and Sherlock some coffee for a long night.
Mycroft                 I looked at him softly, trying to read him. He looked angry, but he wasn't... but definitely upset in some way. "What is it?" I asked quietly, my hand sliding down his arm to rest on his hand.
Sherlock               Swiftly climbing into the passenger seat, I start my own texting.
Mycroft                 I leaned up and kissed him gently nipping at his lower lip, and nibbling my way along his jaw and down his neck, "I want you so much..." I mumbled between kisses. My cock was leaking precum in anticipation
Greg                      "No but when they're not busy, I'm doing the paperwork from when they were busy." I said lightly and tried a few more pieces before putting my fork down. I wasn't horribly skinny, but I had lost weight
Disappointing, have you got anything from them though? GL
Sherlock               "There! Perfect!" I reach towards the laptop, "It's settled. We'll see you two in a week and we'll call back in a couple of hours to talk to Rosie when she's awake. Just leave the laptop besides her." with that I switch off the connection from our end
Peter Harkness    “So tell me about yourself, Greg. Follow any sports? Got any interesting hobbies? I think I caught that you’re a detective with Scotland Yard back home?” trying to keep the conversation light and focused on him as we walked to the grill.
Greg                      Over the next week, it became a lot more comfortable between us both. I was overjoyed when John asked us to look after Rosie while they went to Scotland and me and Mycroft hadn't yet talked about Caroline and kids.
James Morgan      Looking around I see nothing left to do. "The canisters have a timer, so I won't need to worry ‘bout that. Think we're all done here".
Greg                      "I am not gonna be your slave monkey while I’m out here Sherlock." I said a little as a warning where the jet lag was still keeping up with me and he must have known I needed a coffee myself.
Greg                      I spent a couple more weeks in America clearing a few things up at the embassy, my arm still bandaged when we flew back to the UK but the stitches had come out as soon as we got back. Instead of heading back to the yard to be a DI, I was instated as Mycroft’s head of security within his department, so we could stick close and it was also more enjoyable for me.
Greg                      "Hold on a minute." I warn and walk in front of him once Brad had finished talking with a customer. I smiled when I met his eye, showing him my badge and hope sherlock would actually behave.
Mycroft                 "Please help me, brother. Help me find out what really happened to her. I need to do this..." I leaned my head against him as he stood passively beside me.
Sherlock               Stuffing my phone away in my pocket I straighten, sweeping a hand down my coat to return it to pristine before striding in, confidence oozing from me as I attempt to sweep past security, shouting out to the guard, "Kitchen this way? Good, good..."
Mycroft                 I looked up when I heard the knock at the door, to see Lestrade standing there. "Is it time to leave already?”  I said, rubbing my tired eyes.
Greg                      "I'm sure I can do that." I smirked and still felt a bit like John was a tad annoyed, but I felt better since Mycroft had defended me. I naturally stepped towards the table when Mycroft seemed to be getting paler in the face.
Mycroft                 I pointed to the saline bottle John had left. "Use that to rinse it out," I told him, as he was looking a bit distracted.
John                      I looked it up a bit when Mycroft grabbed Greg’s arm. I continued. “You have to pull out the old packing and then rinse it with the saline tubes. Then just pack it with fresh gauze and tape him back up. The wound will have to be packed until his next follow up appointment. If the doctor sees that he’s healing well, then we may not have to pack it anymore.”
Rosie                     Wonder if Papa can make Gayg and Myca keam since I gots some of their hair.
Mycroft
Mycroft                 "I suspect it's a pretty significant 'gut feeling', if you pulled away so quickly. Is he not to be trusted? I could quietly have him reassigned..." I was wondering if Peter could have been somehow involved in Willa's murder.
Rosie                     "Yes! And I gots a yellow for you. Papa made it so it glows in the dark."
Brad Carter          "This isn't about the thing in the bathroom, is it? I swear it was just a little pot. It's medicinal!" I look over and see my manager walking towards me. I cannot afford to get in trouble, again.
Peter Harkness    My date Alex, an assistant to Senator Bernie Sanders, has just finished telling me a funny story, and while laughing I survey the room and am surprised to see at a corner table across the room a certain silver fox having dinner with...oh...with Mr. Holmes...and both of them are dressed to the nines. And Greg is just glowing. And the eye-fucking between him and Mr. Holmes is intense. And I'm now understanding better what had happened the other day between myself and Greg. Well shit... I suddenly realize how surprisingly enamored I'd become with Greg and am a little sad that it looked like I wasn't going to be getting anywhere with him. Alex notices I'm suddenly distracted and asks if I'm okay. I force a smile and try to ignore the dark cloud creeping over me. I blame my sudden change in mood on the drinks getting to my head and excuse myself to go to the bathroom.
Greg                      I let out a little laugh at that, pushing it down when Sherlock glared at me again. I finished my coffee and rubbed at the back of my neck as there were many things I wanted to say to Sherlock, but they just didn't come out of my mouth.
Sherlock               Biting into my own meal I frown as I watch him push his plate away, before leaning to refill both our wine glasses, "You hate it here. You hate this assignment."
Mycroft                 The tube down my throat was irritating, making me cough. I started to reach for it, when John grabbed my hand.
Greg                      I knew a little hum would have sent him over the edge so started moving my tongue around his cock a little more until he was pushing his hips up into my mouth. I moved my hand on his balls down to his perineum, then choosing to hum around him with as much as him in my mouth as possible.
Rosie                     Iz hard not to cry. I fling myself into Gayg’s arms and hug him tight. I forgot I was still holding the pretty pink polish til I saw it all spill out on his chest where my hand was.
Greg                      My work head had obviously kicked in to compensate for seeing someone get shot in front of me and I was running just behind Mycroft. I slammed into the door too, my gun coming out and pointing out James. "Put the keys down." I growled.
congratulations! I'm proud of you Sherlock GL
Greg                      "Fuck... Fuck it, I need a cigarette." I swore quietly at first and then more out loud, going into the hall to find my emergency pack of cigarettes that were in the inside pocket of my coat. I then padded out to the conservatory door with my hoody being slipped back on.
John                      “What? They can’t honestly think that’s a good idea?” I look from Mycroft to Sherlock and back.
Sherlock               The kiss takes me by surprise, making me lean back slightly but keeping tight hold of his hand. I try to push back after a few seconds, enjoying the sensations more and more. John's lips were rather thin and chapped but skillful and confident on my own. I can't help the bubble of rumbling noise that rises from my chest
Sherlock               Pondering something I lean over, testing the coffee is just lukewarm before trying to dip Mycroft's finger in it, leaving it there
Greg                      "We just gotta finish Myc’s nails and then we can dress up. We gotta be careful of his shoulder though still." I smile as I let her down and my cheeks go a nice shade of red where I found him grinning at me at the name change.
Mycroft                 "Surely you and Willa had some conversation over dinner the night she died..." I said, anger creeping into my voice.
Mycroft                        "If England were boring, I would have sought a permanent assignment.  I did not."  My voice cracked.  "Please go, Sherlock.  I do not have the stomach to deal with you right now."  I needed some time to come to grips with Willoughby's death.
Greg                      "Had a nice steak and then came back here to read through some emails from back home.. I'm guessing this was from your chat last night with Sherlock?" I nodded to the smashed glass and looked up at him again when I stood. I knew what he was trying to do.
John                      “You’re an idiot sometimes, you know that. Come here.” I pull his lips down to mine.
Mycroft
Its why you keep me around, is it not? GL
if you haven't managed to scare me away so far then you won't. John is always going to be your friend and I might see if I can contact him for you. GL
Sherlock               I hesitate, "Maybe I should phone John? Rosie's health is my primary concern at this time, even over my own relationship with him." The admittance makes my shoulders sag a little, arms tightening around Rosie despite the vomit risk
Mycroft                 "I have only seen two episodes... hardly enough to make an educated determination..." I huffed, lightly kissing his jaw.
Mycroft                 I climbed onto the bed, straddling his legs as I bent down to take him into my mouth again, my hand stroking what I wasn't licking and sucking.
Sherlock               Tapping away on my laptop I mutter, obviously not noticing that John had left the room and returned, "....and then he told me about her. It was most strange. Unnerving."
Mycroft                 "Moi? Bien sûr que non!" I looked at Sherlock innocently.
Mycroft                        "Just. go." I replied stiffly.  My iron grip on my emotions was beginning to slip, and I needed to be alone.
Greg                      "I think she'll do more than just test it. She'll blow it up." I grinned as I looked at the texts and put the little kit on the bedside table, my eyes scanning him, and I'd not really paid attention to his stature before until now. I'd mainly been watching John fix up his shoulder.
Greg                      "I'll have to get some practice in but we all need a way to blow off steam." I give him a cheeky grin as we head into the grill, it being stereotypical to what he thought it was going to be.
Sherlock               There's something slightly distracted in my voice, "Emails sent to an account I've been unable to trace. Different addresses and ISPs every time but the same theme. Talking about a target, plans, all extremely vague and I suspect in code for the most. There was one email though sent the day she died saying 'the target would no longer be a problem.'"
Mycroft                 "About your brother?" I asked, as he sat on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock               The streams paint John's stomach and even his chest, glistening and thick. My entire attention is caught in a manner usually reserved for less appealing subjects, making me move a little closer until I'm hovering above John's body, kneeling, my hands resting so close I'm almost, but not quite, touching him. The scent fills my nostrils, flaring them as I inhale deeply, gathering previously denied information. Glancing up at my new boyfriend I see him panting and spent, unable to prevent my next movement as I dip my head, tongue flicking out to collect a small sample of his passion before withdrawing to roll it around my mouth to taste with a look of curiosity plain
Greg                      "Please." I smiled back and saw the covered tray on the table, myself perching on the edge of the sofa while Mycroft poured the tea for both of us. He even remembered how I took it.
Mycroft                 I sat back on the sofa, looking through a few more of the handwritten letters. Each from a different sender, someone with whom Willa had been intimate. Some letters were dated only a few weeks apart. "She was... busy." I choked out, setting down the last letter. "She was apparently involved in some organization, and moved up the ranks quickly. The letters stop when she moved into the Embassy - she must have resorted to e-mail by then."
Mycroft                 I poured him a cup, and set it on the desk. "About last night, Greg..." I began uncomfortably.
Greg                      "Shit... Shit, shit..." I swore as I checked through the box again and I realised those photos were missing. It seemed more than just a coincidence, my face calm but I was beginning to worry in my head about what this was about.
give me an hour and then I'll text you the address. GL
Sherlock               My eyes widen, my body leaning forwards towards him without any conscious choice on my part. A low rumble vibrates through my chest and throat as my gaze becomes even more intense, nodding, "Impressive."
Rosie                     "No. Papa does my hair and he get all upset and no." I run to Unca Gayg cause he'll protect me from skizzer man.
Mycroft                 "A gardener, too? You really are a man of many talents. I've never had an affinity for plants - that was always Sherlock's area. I think I will join you. The fresh air will do me good”
Greg                      "It’s not your fault. He came of his own accord and there's no point doing the whole ‘what if’ thoughts.” I said as I paced the little sitting area we were in, my nails having blood underneath them even though I'd scrubbed them well.
Greg                      "No, no, I'm following just fine. I just thought you wanted to collect more data to make an opinion." I could feel his grin against my skin, my head trying to think of boring things just so it wouldn't be so obvious that I was being turned on.
James Morgan      "Could you send that to me? I'll send you copies of the ones Sally took."
- a long black feather
Greg                      "I apologise if I'm a bit hostile. I met your brother out in the lobby and you know how he pushes my buttons all hours of the day." I started to say softly after a minute or so silence, my posture relaxing along with my face softening.
Work would keep my mind off things.
Greg                      "Yeah, pain meds do that, especially the stronger ones. It’s horrible." I sighed and knew John was thinking about when I would have had to take that sort of medication, but I merely continued putting stuff away.
John                      “Here? In the British Embassy?” I hiss. Then realization dawns on me. “Oh... this isn’t about us... this is about you wanting to get one over on Mycroft. And James too.” I poke him in the chest.
That's him. He has a nasty scar over one eye now apparently. He's our man. He still seems to be in Scotland -SH
James Morgan      "Hello Mr. Holmes. I'm not used to being called in on a Saturday," I am quite pleased though. What better alibi could I have than Mycroft Holmes. "How can I help you?"
Mycroft                 My eyes widened in a mild panic. Text to Sherlock How long are you going to be gone?!?
Mycroft                 I looked at the offered spoon, and shrugged slightly. "I suppose one more spoonful won't hurt," I said, quickly leaning over and taking the bite slowly, letting the pudding melt onto my tongue before pulling away. I closed my eyes and smiled.
Sherlock               My look grows harder, snapping, "I could care for him. I know how. I observed you when you cared for me after my own gunshot wound."
Sherlock               My eyes close, leaning to touch my head with Rosie's, dark curls against bright sunshine, murmuring, "I am an impossible man to live with."
Greg                      "No, no, it wouldn't be at the yard." I said as I went back into the living room and I was looking everywhere. I'd even checked the piles of photos twice for the missing photos.
Mycroft                 I blanched a little at his phrasing, but quickly regained my composure. "Why would I hesitate? She is already dead, after all.  And she left me behind long ago."
Is there any 'baby's first firearms' training in existence? I believe she has talent. -SH
Greg                      I'd gotten up half an hour early for my morning run when I'd woken up from a nightmare, Mycroft's reaction yesterday still playing in my head. I'd checked all my security cameras before I left and when I'd showered and half changed, I narrowed my eyes at Peter heading into Mark's IT office.
Greg                      I’d spent the evening with Mycroft going over small details of the case, us ending up cuddling in bed throughout the night. I got up before him to order breakfast and was wandering back through in Mycroft’s dressing gown when I heard the text come through.
Greg                      "Good." I say sharply and let the silence fall again, keeping his eye and waited for him to tell me anything else about what was going on. What he wanted me to do, be at certain times.
meant to be but just tell me, Sherlock . GL
Sherlock               His giggle infects me, as always, making me turn my head a little and break out into chuckles, settling back to sit next to him once more, "We need to start varying your diet if I'm to perform oral sex on a regular basis"
Sherlock
Mycroft
Sherlock               Beaming, I lick some honey off one of the tasting sticks, chatting happily with the stall holder about the honey, picking out some jars to take back with me
Sherlock
Greg                      "He smells of the hospital Rosie and Myca isn't sad, his shoulder still hurts so he can't do as much. He still has to stay here for a couple more days rather than sleep in his own bed." I tried to explain simply.
Mycroft                 My shirt fluttered to the ground, and I carefully got to my feet, pushing down my pajama bottoms, leaving me standing naked before him. I could feel his eyes on me
Carlton                 "About five years ago, when the younger Mr. Holmes pulled his Lazarus," attempting to be subtle as I watched the little girl walk back out into the sitting room. "I understand she's his charge now?" as I nod my head at her, standing in front of Gregory combing thru his fringe.
Rosie                     "Daddy?" Waking up is hard...
Greg                      "Yeah, I think he's just trying to be a good brother. I see the sentiment behind it, even if it is a bit much." I said softly, and we'd not really spoken much in a week with everyone going in and out.
Sherlock               Pulling back I shake my head quickly, "Papa isn't angry at you little Rosie . It's all my fault. I gave you tea that was a bit not good." Sighing I make my way into the bathroom, "Don't touch my Belstaff Mycroft. I'll have it cleaned myself."
Sherlock               Nodding firmly, I glance away, "He's not much but he's the only brother I had. He asked me to investigate what happened to his old lover, through misguided sentiment." Looking back sharply at Nina I scowl, "He may not be so reluctant to let you go if he knows you're protecting someone who had something to do with her death. He's getting soft in his old age."
Greg                      "Yeah, sure. Or I can just make a romantic meal for us. And what did you talk to Anthea about yesterday?" I lifted my head and sat back in the chair, anxiously holding the arm of the chair as he spoke.
Greg                      Once we'd gotten the confession out of Nina and knew James was involved, we rushed back to the car to deal with her at a later point. I got my phone into the hands-free option, texting Mycroft.
John                      I watch as he leans down to taste some of my come from my chest. This causes another aftershock of arousal pass through me. I groan again.
John                      I let out a long moan as he strokes me. The butterflies in my stomach from the whole situation, still overwhelming. I try to relax and screw my eyes shut, enjoying his touch. His fingers were long, wrapped around me.
Carlton                 I see Rosie turn and squint her eyes at me clearly not sure if she trusts me yet. "It's okay Rosie. You have pretty hair already. But you know, my grand-nieces, they love unicorns just like you, and they love it when I braid and twist their hair up into a unicorn horn. Would you maybe like that? I promise I won't cut any hairs and it won't hurt at all." I then lean down to Mycroft a bit and say quietly "It does take quite a bit of hairspray to hold it up, so you'll need to wash it out later."
As I said, Sherlock , experiments take time. Collecting data does too. GL
Mycroft                 "Well, I wish you luck with that, then. I have no such illusions about my desire for nicotine." I shrugged with one shoulder.
I woke up with a scream.
Greg                      I looked back up at Mycroft who seemed to be keeping his eye away from me, my face half a smile and half a frown. "Are you sure? It really isn't going to affect a figure like yours." I smile and took another spoonful, offering it to him.
Lestrade. Lestrade is reading to her
Sherlock               Standing stock still I resist John's efforts to drag me away, my gaze moving between Lestrade and my rather smug looking brother, "You...you two....Noooooo....Nope! Not happening..."
Sherlock               Squeezing his hand again I nod, still smiling, "I'm a little wired too. It's a big chance which has happened tonight. I've gone from thinking I lost your friendship to gaining you as more. And my first, real kiss."
Greg                      "It’s an hour away, Sherlock. we might have to head back to the British Embassy to see if we can get a car." I caught my breath back, apologizing to the cab driver when Sherlock jumped back out to slam the door.
Mycroft                 "I think I understand why some parents drink." I smiled. "What I would give for a tenth of her energy and enthusiasm."  I handed Greg a glass.
Sherlock               I don't even look up from my typing, just raising my glass and taking a sip
Sherlock               Leaning forwards slightly I nod, "You mentioned preparing the two salads for Willa and her guest. Was there any difference between the two meals?"
Sherlock               There's the sounds of shouts from inside the embassy, then I appear, wrapped in a sheet with bare feet and a riot of curls, racing as fast as I can towards them. There seems to be another, smaller person caught in the same sheet, stumbling along and shouting in a gruff army voice for me to slow down
James Morgan      "Better early than late Mycroft. I can call you Mycroft, yeah? Feel free to call my James."
John                      I stare back at him, our silent communication. ‘It’ll be ok.’
Rosie                     "Don' be mean Gahm." I tell Gayg. "Not ok."
Greg                      "Thank you Rosie." I hold back a full grin as I found the photos from when I used to play cricket around the age of 12/13 and I was already tall for my age at that point.
Sherlock
yeah? Come on then, speak to your agony aunt Greg. GL
Mycroft                 I brought my cup to my lips, hiding my disappointment. "I understand. Did you... get the reaction you expected?" I asked.
I will wait for you in my office.
"I... Uncle Greg is right. We should paint his nails. I really don't like balloons, my dear" I made a face as though I were horrified, which in reality, I was, though not for the reasons Rosie probably thought.
Mycroft                 "That is a long time to avoid personal attachments" I said, staring into my coffee cup rather than looking him in the eye. Of course, I had been avoiding them for far longer.
James Morgan      I come back wearing a modest outfit of sweats and old Eagles t-shirt. Holding up a bottle in each hand, "Jack or Jim?"
Greg                      My eyes had seen the gun and I'd reached into my trousers for mine, only having my plain shirt on and then I had Peter falling back into my arms. I half collapsed to my knees with the force, my chest feeling the warm blood starting to pour out of his chest. I'd not even got my breath back.
John                      “No. I mean I have plans of my own tomorrow. I’m going to the Air and Space museum. With... a friend.” I take the business card out of my shirt pocket, turning it over.
Mycroft                 "A man of many talents, then, I see. New Scotland Yard is lucky to have you." I laughed. I was finding it was easy to be around Lestrade - without even trying, he lifted my spirits a bit.
Mycroft                 I looked around the garden, then turned to the cedar storage bench, carefully opening it and slipping out a pack of cigarettes. Silently, I shook one out of the pack, along with the lighter. I took the cigarette in my lips, sparked the lighter, and lit it, taking a long drag. I didn't smoke often - mostly a way of coping with extreme stress. The nicotine was very calming.
James Morgan            "Yes. Let me give you my card in case you need a n y t h i n g from your Embassy. Or if you'd like a tour around DC. It is my job to show foreign guests around." I had him my card and look dejected.
Greg                      "It's only just gone 9am and I haven't been awake that long.." I smiled softly and had gotten used to staying in his flat, not yet moved in but it was still early days. I had actually been awake an hour from a nightmare about what happened to Peter replaying in my mind.
John is not gay. Why would he be on a date with a man? -SH
Brad Carter          "If I knew their names I wouldn't call them Boris and Natasha!" Omg these guys are idiots!! "Look. I'm done. Any more questions you want to ask you can ask whoever is in charge now."
John                      “Sherlock....” I mutter turning even redder.
Mycroft                 I took another sip, letting the pleasant warm soothe the ache in my chest. "Vengeance is almost as dangerous to the heart as love is. You would do well to remember that.”  I sat heavily in my leather chair
Greg                      "I wouldn't laugh. Tell me." I poked his good side with my toe and got his attention back to me.
John                      “Um... I’m not sure. I kind of bollocks’d things up... I think...”
Mycroft                 I sat upright in bed, not feeling the searing pain in my shoulder, gasping for breath. "Sherlock... Sherlock... NO!" I wasn't fully awake, still trapped in the nightmare that had jolted me. I froze when I felt Greg's hand on my good shoulder.
Greg                      "That's me when I was your age Rosie.. my hair used to be that colour and much like Papa's..." I chuckled and patted the space next to me when Mycroft came back in, my arms around Rosie.
Rosie                     "You mean shit? Why not?"
Mycroft                 I sat quietly at the table with my coffee while Greg washed dishes. I knew if I got up to help him, he'd probably snap at me.
Mycroft                 "Not sad, Rosie, my dear. Just tired." I sighed. "Uncle Mycroft has had a long day." I stroked her back as she settled back in.
Mycroft                 I paled when I saw that Greg had been shot. "I... I shot you... I'm sorry, Greg..." I said, my face going sheet-white. The security team comes running through the door, cuffing the now-unconscious James, while the emergency medical team descends on both him and Greg.  I stepped away from the group, in a daze.
Sherlock               Frowning, I shake my head slowly, "It's hard to recall as my brother was rather under the influence of alcohol by then and emotional. I don't believe he mentioned where she went..." my fingers start flying once more, attempting to trace the movements of the younger Willa Smith
Mycroft                 I laughed weakly. "Heaven... forbid..." I closed my eyes for a moment, and opened them, to find Sherlock standing over me, his hand over mine.
Sherlock               Glancing at Lestrade I give him a little huff, then mutter, "And who are these Rocky and Bullwinkle people also? Are they involved?"
John          “Thanks for keeping her all this time. It was good to get away for a while.” I say taking her bags from Greg.
Mycroft                 I looked at Sherlock's texts with a smile. Greg knocked lightly on my bedroom door and entered, as I sat on the edge of the bed, my shirt off so he could change the dressings. "Rosie is testing Sherlock's last nerve, it seems," I grinned, showing Greg the texts.
James Morgan            "James Morgan, foreign relations, and fan of American History."
Mycroft                 The feel of his hands on my bare skin was exquisite torture. "You are a devil" I breathed, leaning my head back on the sofa
Mycroft                 "Perhaps after Rosie returns home, you can refresh my memory..." I winked.
Thank you. I suppose saying I'll keep you informed is redundant. -SH
Mycroft                 I nodded. "And why do you not want our driver to know this?" I asked smoothly.  (speaking in French)
Greg                      "Just some pasta that's easy to eat, just stab it with your fork and won't be so harsh on your good shoulder either." I called as I put the picture of me and my brother up on the fridge, ripping the one of me and Caroline in half to put in the bin.
Greg                     "Peter... Peter, keep your eyes open." I said with my voice coming out as rugged breaths, my hands trying to push down on the bullet wound but it must have hit something vital with the amount of blood. It was pouring over me and I was begging god to make it stop.
Greg                      "I think I'm gonna start planning it now and we can execute it when you're fit again." I chuckled at the smirk on his face, feeling a great relief to get that off my chest.
John                      I blush. “Do you know why Orion’s belt is a waste of space? Nevermind, It’s bad joke. Only three stars.” I quip back.
Greg                      "Shit. Get down, everybody, get down!" I shout loudly to the people around me and the PCs are getting everybody to cover, my own jacket coming off to push down on his chest where he'd been shot. I was bending over him to stop any more shots hitting him.
Greg                      "I know she was wrong but everyone else can make their own decision on that.." I smiled more easily when he put his hand over mine and I moved my fingers so I could squeeze his. I was then thinking we were back to a date, my eyes looking out for the attraction signs I'd learnt from Sherlock.
Mycroft                 "An infection? Would I correct in assuming I have a fever then? That does explain a lot..." I remembered weird flashes of dreams, and I started to wonder if any of it had been real. Lestrade was trying to avoid my gaze. "What did I say?" I asked tentatively, not really sure I wanted to know the answer.
Dillon                    Giving a huff I keep moving, ignoring his yells, "Oh you've been a bad boy, haven't you?" Tugging back on his shoulder with my palm I try and feel the extent of the damage, "So bad. You've been overdoing things"
Mycroft                 I took a few bites of my pad thai, but didn't really taste them. The smug grin on Greg's face was not helping.
Rosie                     Returning with a box of polish and stickers I set the kit on the table and climb up next to my Myca.
Sherlock
Rosie                   "Gay-gay. Yay." Unca G has the nearest hugs. "Myca now?" My Myca needs me, I can tell.
Rosie          "DADDY!DADDY! I misseded you so much!" He lifts me up and kisses me lots. "Where's Papa?"
James Morgan            Looking at my watch I notice how late it is. "How about 10am. Gives us plenty of time to do anything your heart desires".
What is the matter?
I messed up. We're at my brothers -SH
Greg                      "Did Mycroft say where she went with the job offer? Somewhere like America?" I asked and knew Russia and America had connections between one another for many years. It wouldn't be hard for her to get a 'sudden job offer' to get her out of the country or even away from Mycroft.
Two things so far. My brother told me to check the emails to the former security chief. He was an idiot. He makes Anderson look like a shining example of detective ability -SH
Mycroft                 In the middle of my breakfast, I hear my phone chirp, and read Sherlock's message with an eye roll. I call downstairs and arrange to have a car waiting for them when they arrive.
Mycroft                 "By the time I started university, my parents already knew what I was going to do - I had little choice in the matter." I finished my wine, and set the empty glass on the side table. "Uncle Rudy took me under his wing as an intern, and as soon as I finished at Cambridge, I went to work for him. Eventually, I replaced him."
Sherlock               Without even glancing up I carry on what I was obviously saying to the empty bed besides me, "...so it seems the whole security team may be inept which means more work for us of course. You may have to cancel some of your attendance at the lectures."
Sherlock               Pushing the 'borrowed' stapler into Lestrade's hands I snap a little, "I'm onto you Giles."
John                      I raise an eyebrow. “It’d do him some good to quit, too. Maybe you can help each other out.” I suggest.
You keep Anderson distracted I suppose -SH
Greg                      I jumped into the cab with Sherlock and once we'd gotten the Russian letters from Ms. Smith's former tenant who'd found them in her flat when she'd let the police in.
Greg                      "Both ideas sound amazing. I need more pastry in my life and nobody has ever drawn me before." I smiled and reached over to play with the hair on the back of his head, seeing him smile more as he thought about the idea.
James Morgan      As I walk down the lobby in the Embassy I see a familiar face and go up to him. "John?"
Greg                      I left the stew on the stove as I followed where Mycroft had walked, my arms folded as I watched him take a few drags and I then cleared my throat to let him know of my presence. I'd never seen somebody jump so high before.
That's your department. I'm heading to the lab now. There's something off about these toxicology reports but I can't work out what. I may need time and to contact Molly Hooper. -SH
Mycroft                 "First the polish, then the stickers, my dear. Now what color do you want?"
Greg                      "Right. Well, yes please, Sherlock." I was glaring at sherlock and John myself while trying to get the blush in my face to diminish. I could see Mycroft trying to avoid my eye and I thought he was doing it because he thought it was ludicrous.
Mycroft                 "It's not you I am worried about. It's that manic overgrown toddler you're in the car with. Let me know when you're on your way back, all right?"
James Morgan            I look around the bar to see if there's anyone worth my attention. I notice a adorable man as he walks up to the bar where I'm sitting.
Sherlock               Settling Rosie on my hip I give Mycroft a little glare, "I'm fully prepared to give you all the time and attention you need Mycroft. Stop treating me like I'm a child."
Sherlock               Pausing, I look rather sheepish, "No, mine are...not so good as John's."
John                      I cough and laugh dragging him out of the room as Greg blushes.
They quickly fumble with donning their respective engagement rings and pose for split second as the audience takes a million photos with their mobile phones before they rush backstage finding a dark corner to properly kiss for a few private minutes. Sherlock wipes away the few happy tears from John's cheeks before leading him out the alley doors and taking his fiancé home.
Mycroft                 "I apologize. Forgive me?" I asked hopefully. "Let me make it up to you, when we're both rested and reasonably sober?" I said with a crooked smile.
James Morgan      After a nice dinner and escorting John around the Capital Building I know it's time to take him home.  “Care to come to my place? There's a 24-hour coffee shop right next door. I promise I'll leave your virtue intact. Boy’s Oath or something like that."
Mycroft                 I ignored Sherlock's sloppy eating habits. "But you never had someone hit you with a barrage of peas shot rapid-fire through a straw. I think you would understand my dislike of them if you had."
Greg                      "Transparent? That's... nice..." I say slowly as it didn't exactly sound like a good thing, my free hand going behind my head as I leant back into the pillows, so he could turn to me more.
Rosie                     "Myca! Mycamycamycamyca!" I run up to him and hug his legs.
Mycroft                 The drapes closed, I slowly sat up running my fingers through my hair. My head was throbbing, and every joint in my body hurt from being curled onto the sofa all night. I drank the coffee greedily. "How was your evening?" I asked, trying to deflect the conversation.
Mycroft                 I gasped for breath, shuddering as I came back down. I lowered my arm, snickering at the dark purple mark my teeth left. "That was..." I started to say, at a complete loss for words. I reached down and stroked Greg's cheek softly.
Greg                      "Sure." I waved my hand at him calling me Greg but something wasn't sitting right for me for some reason. I merely ignored it, got into the passenger seat and we were then off to the embassy.
Call back in 2 hours. I'm sure she'll be awake by then.
Mycroft                 I smiled at his quiet statement, and kissed him lightly. "You can always trust me. I would do anything for you." I said, leaning my head on his shoulder.
Sherlock
Greg                      "Well, I was only a sergeant at the time I met her, it was about a year after we married that I became a DI. She thought it would be more desk work, less time out on cases and more time spent at home. I said it wasn't, but she thought I'd make the sacrifice for her." I explained and stood up with the breakfast plates.
Sherlock               Stripping off my ruined clothes I drop them in a corner of the bathroom, standing in only my underpants and peeking out, hissing, "Mycroft...I need clothes."
Carlton Fitzhugh, written by JohnsRedPants
Greg                      I'd headed back to my suite to email Sherlock about what was in the letters, my lips automatically curving up into a smile when I saw his text. I left my jacket in my room and saw David was just coming out of Mycroft’s room so I just caught the door before it was shut.
What do dogs have to do with it? -SH
Greg                      I connected to the stereo and put on one of my happier playlists, it starting with the song
Mycroft                 Greg brought in a tray of food, setting it on the table beside me. I carefully balanced the bowl on the arm of the chair, and took a bite. "You are a true artist in the kitchen, Greg," I said, savouring the food. I wasn't really terribly hungry, my stomach a bit unsettled for some reason, but I managed to eat nearly half of it before I set the bowl back on the tray.
Greg                      "Ah... well, yes, I do find you mysterious because you don't give much away." I said between mouthfuls of toast and let the silence fall again like a led balloon. I was watching him battle something in his head, his mouth trying to connect.
Mycroft                 "I am not going to scare him away, Sherlock," I sighed, shaking my head. "Please, go wait in my office, and we will join you shortly."
Mycroft                 "I had Anthea order it, to be delivered now," I smiled. "No lifting on my part, so you have no cause to scold me. Please, sit and eat. " I motioned to the chair across the table from me.
Sherlock               Straight away I'm back on my phone, scrolling now intently, "Molly found traces of gelsemium alkaloids in Smith's blood samples. I'm sure I've heard of something like this."
John                      I knock softly on the door, pushing it open to step in. “Hey.” I say quietly.
Sherlock               Hailing a cab I huff, "I have her home address. Come on. Or did my brother suck all your brains out last night as well as other things?" without waiting for him I leap into the taxi and give an address
Sherlock               My eyes fly open as he kisses me, then I pull back, slightly out of breath, "If we hurry back upstairs to Mycroft's private rooms we can lock ourselves in his living room and have sex. He won't mind. He's busy in his office."
Greg                      "Of course I will, it’s a bloody shooting in a public place." I walk along with Sherlock but keep one arm around him, my arms taking Rosie for a minute, so John could look over his partner. I tried to breathe when I got to the wheel of my car and my hands were so steady.
Sherlock               Lowering my fingers a little I smirk over the table, "Now you get me another coffee. Black. Two sugars."
Greg                      "What colour have we picked out for Uncle Myc then?" I said when Mycroft had put the first coat on my hand, waiting for it to dry and I liked how Myc sounded on the tongue. I was gonna have to call it him more often.
Rosie                     "Laaaa lalala la LA LA de daa la la LAAAAAAAA" Singing helps the pee come out.
John                      I pause at those words and my face falls a bit. No. I wouldn’t let him do this to me any longer. “I’m going to the museum, Sherlock.” I say a bit softer than I intended.
Sherlock
John                      “Alright, I’ll text Anthea to have something else sent over. What else can I help with?”
Sherlock
Sherlock               Glancing over too I follow his gaze, then treat him to an extra special friendly wink, "Look, when's your break? Can we get you a coffee and have an informal little talk?"
Sherlock
Sherlock
Greg                      "And I'm sorry you didn't really have a decision in me being here, deciding who looked after you." I said quietly when he looked back up at me and we didn't know one another that well anyway.
Greg                      I took a deep breath and grabbed the nearest thing to me, which was a small chair and Mycroft was half-awake and half-asleep so I leaned against the wall to listen to whoever was in the living room. I couldn’t make out what they were saying.
