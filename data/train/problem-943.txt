He had once thought it impossible that he could feel that amount of passion for someone, the inexhaustible need to kiss someone senseless, to hold them close and never let go; that gnawing fear of losing someone that never really went away, but John made him second-guess everything he knew about himself.
Turning his attention to the display of sandwiches and pastries, John searched the counter for something that Sherlock would find at least mildly appealing. The task proved immensely difficult.
“I’m ready to get back to work.”
“Wait, you’re cold. You’re shivering.”
However, the blissful feeling was short-lived when his attention was drawn by the steady hum of traffic outside, pierced by the odd screech of brakes and the occasional shout from a passer-by hailing a cab. From somewhere in the distance came the thump of some abhorrent techno mix, almost masked by the din of a throbbing bass. He could hear the click of heels against the pavement below, quickly receding into the distance, and the clamour of a group of teenagers laughing and chatting in raised voices right in front of Speedy’s café.
Giving his hand a gentle squeeze, John waited patiently for him to continue. He knew better than to rush Sherlock.
“Good morning.” John offered him a slight smile, walking to the counter.
And that’s why Sherlock’s words about his work being the only thing that he had left had felt like a sucker punch to the gut, leaving him reeling. Something about the way he had said “I lost everything I got” made his throat constrict until he thought he would choke. He knew how vital the Work was for Sherlock, but the knowledge that he felt like he had lost everything else of significance made John’s heart plummet to the pit of his stomach and something allied to grief lodge in his chest. He didn’t expect Sherlock to relinquish his work for his sake, nor did he want him to—it was what made him who he was, and John wouldn’t change a thing about him; he loved the man, irrevocably and wholeheartedly. But, and maybe it was selfish of him, he wanted to be something more than a sidekick, something more than a rag doll that was thrown aside and forgotten the second something more exciting came up. He didn’t want to compete with the Work. He wanted to exist in Sherlock’s world without the fear of getting discarded like an old toy when a new, flashy one appeared.
John let his eyes rest on Sherlock's face, taking in the way the light played over his features. The harsh fluorescent lighting made him look even paler than he was, emphasising his prominent cheekbones, accentuating the dark circles under his eyes. John had dragged a plastic chair beside the bed and was now perched on it, resting his hand on Sherlock's, gently caressing his palm with his thumb, drawing lazy circles against the soft flesh, soothing the man with the slow motion. Sherlock had let his eyelids fall shut, but John was familiar enough with his breathing pattern to know that he was still awake. He had spent sleepless nights listening to his every breath, watching his chest rise and fall, trying to slow down his own breathing to match his, unable to sleep because his mind refused to stop thinking about Sherlock, their relationship, dreading that Sherlock would eventually get bored and leave. The fear was always in the back of his mind, hovering at the edge of his thoughts, something he would never get rid of, the unavoidable side effect of being in love with Sherlock Holmes.
“It’s a blessing,” Sherlock agrees, gentle teasing in his tone. He hands the laptop over to John. “See if this meets your approval.”
“I’m lost,” he says in a tiny voice.
,” Maria sneers, her scant patience snapping. “Yes. You’re right. I’m not your wife, never was. You’re not my husband, you never were and believe me, I’m damn glad of it, considering how pathetically hung up you’ve always been on Sherlock Fucking Holmes.” She rolls her eyes and gives a melodramatic sigh before fixing her gaze again upon John. “Lovely relationship chat. Really. Now
After several long breathless moments Sherlock broke away, gulping for air, and rested his forehead against John’s. “I love you,” Sherlock said quietly, his voice trembling. “I love you more than anything else in this world.”
“Have you seen his back?” John asks sharply. “Because those scars look pretty damn
Their eyes meet in the rippled glass of the cheap, chipped bathroom mirror. A moment passes in silence, their breathing loud in the confines of the small room. John’s hand still cradles the back of Sherlock’s skull.
What stunned me, absolutely knocked me on my ass, is that there are so many readers out there who remembered this story, and loved it, and were ready to welcome me back with open arms and open hearts.
Just thinking about it exhausts him to the bone, so he puts the question off to deal with another day.
“I don’t…” Sherlock begins, trailing off as he uncharacteristically struggles for the right words to convey his thoughts. “You need to understand that I have no particular love for that line of work. It is what Holmeses do, by default. Some family businesses paint houses or run launderettes. We are in the intelligence industry. My brother, my mother, her father... the line stretches all the way back to the time of Victoria. For several years they left me in peace as my drug habit made me too much of a security risk, and it wasn’t until after I met you and became more stable that my abilities again outweighed my liabilities. Mycroft has insisted I retain my active status, but most of the time I try to avoid it like the plague. Occasionally, it’s a mutually beneficial arrangement, but it’s not the work or the life I want for myself.”
“Considering how much you like to be right, it truly is.” John kisses him once more. “But are you--are you certain? We’ve just fallen into bed, and that’s a pretty big leap to take right away.”
Sherlock drives them to an unprepossessing little strip mall in a nicer, cleaner, more suburban part of town. The pub, at the end of the row, is blandly innocuous from the outside; if one wasn’t looking it would be easily missed. The lettering on the window proclaims it to be Flynn’s Taphouse, and according to the neon sign above the door it is OPEN.
He’s thinner than John has ever seen him, more so than even two nights earlier. One meal of fried cheese and wings is barely a dent in weeks of poor food and worse sleep; his wiry slenderness, usually overlaid with muscle gained through a careful (though circumspect) regimen of pushups and crunches and planks, is slowly giving way to undeniable frailty. His stomach is concave, his hipbones sharp ridges, his ribs prominent enough to count.
After the nurse is gone, Sherlock puts down the days-old newspaper he’d been halfheartedly pretending to read. He gives John an appraising look.
John has to bite down hard on his back teeth to keep from laughing out loud; his laughter is based in fond affection, not mockery, not ever mockery, but he knows it would devastate Sherlock anyway so he keeps it in through sheer force of will.
Their bodies press together from shoulders to knees, John’s cock pressing and rubbing against the thin cotton covering the warm, lean stretch of Sherlock’s belly, and John can’t help but give in to animal instinct and
He slurps up a mouthful of noodles. “Let me eat first, for Christ’s sake.”
Later, John won't know for certain if he would have ended up seeking out Mycroft of his own volition. He'd like to think not, but...well.
“Why the hell didn’t you tell me?” John demands.
“On the Internet. I bought a six pack but you can only have them one at a time, they’re terrible for you, high fructose corn syrup and so much caffeine--”
weeks
John laughs a bit. “How did you know?” He shoves his arms inelegantly through the sleeves, allows Sherlock to snap the snaps and tie the strings and just generally properly arrange things.
Clarity of purpose returns to him with a chill, shocking swiftness.
John nods, presses his lips to the warm soft flesh of Sherlock’s lower belly one more time.
The flash of disappointment on Sherlock’s face is gone in the space of a single heartbeat. “Of course,” he says smoothly. “Well, then. Thank you for the assistance. As ever, you proved quite useful.” He pivots a half-step away from John, flips up his collar, an unconscious tell of self-protection.
“I didn’t roll my eyes.”
In fact, he feels worse, because he knows that he very definitely betrayed Sherlock’s trust, even if it was in the service of the greater good.
“Outstanding.” John sits down on the sofa, picks up his mug, drains the last dregs of cold ginger tea and sets it back down. “No more games. Tell us who she is to you, and where we can find her, and we will be out of your hair and on our way.”
He pushes down a brief flare of irrational panic; surely he hasn’t gone very far, not in the middle of the night. He cranes his head, looks at the doorway; a sliver of dim yellow light is visible under the closed door. He just went to make a cuppa or find a snack or look something up on his laptop, then.
It is full dark when the two men leave the shop.
The exterior is unremarkable, a bleak windowless edifice just outside the airport fence. At the left corner of the building, a single outdoor lamp illuminates the tempered glass door, bisected by a metal crash bar on the inner side. To the right of the door is a large, plainly lettered sign marked “Medical Linen Supply”. The building is surrounded by a woven metal fence, about two and a half meters tall; the sliding gate is open, but a security camera is clearly visible, perched on top of the right gatepost.
“Jesus Christ,” John breathes. “You’re the dirtiest thing I’ve ever seen. Tell me how good it feels, fucking yourself like that while I watch.”
What he doesn’t expect is the sound of a cap being unscrewed, and the cool plastic of a water bottle against his lower lip.
“You certainly did,” Sherlock says as he rises. He can’t resist pressing in close to John, planting a brief kiss into soft hair. As if on instinct, John relaxes into him, presses his head into Sherlock’s bare chest.
There are no toys on the bed, no rope or cuffs or spreader bars, no crop or paddle. Just John, waiting for him, endlessly patient. He’s taken off his shoes and socks, but otherwise remains fully dressed.
“Of course I am. But why?”
with me at school, much less that sort of thing.”
“They seem so normal,” John says several minutes later. It’s not quite what he really wants to say. He doesn’t have words yet for what he really wants to say.
When he opens the fourth door, however, his stomach lurches with sick horror.
Ten more and Sherlock’s floating, completely outside of himself, lost to the burning heat and the pain and the shameful pleasure of it. He’s whimpering and keening, heedless of the high desperate cries he’s making, and when John stops again every nerve in his entire body is on fire.
“Yes, love.”
And besides, He wouldn't be talking to Mycroft as a medical professional. He would be talking to Mycroft as Sherlock's friend. Boyfriend, maybe even. Of a sort, he supposes, even as that budding relationship withers and dies on the vine.
“That’s enough for now. You really need to rest.” John turns away to put the cup back on the side table. Sherlock instinctively reaches out and seizes his hand in a burst of panic, the movement shooting fireworks of agony throughout his body.
Sherlock shakes his head, his lips pursed in a mocking moue of sympathy. “Poor pitiful you, the true victim in this situation.” He makes a deliberate show of folding the document back into thirds and returning it to the envelope before tucking it into the inner breast pocket of his coat.
Sherlock moans softly in reply, tilting his hips up in silent, unmistakable entreaty, his prick rock hard, dusky pink and rising flush against his lower abdomen. John wraps fingers around the hot, satin smooth skin, nudging the foreskin gently back, stroking him, finding the rhythm as he explores the warm, sweat-damp crease of his groin, tasting the salty musky tang of his body. Sherlock whimpers, spreading his legs wider as he thrusts into the tight circle of John’s fist.
Later on, sleepless in his bed, John contemplates that going over to see Sherlock and then asking Mrs. Hudson not to tell him is in fact orders of magnitude more pathetic than going over there unannounced in the first place.
Curiosity is rapidly shifting into concern. Adrenaline doesn’t flood John’s system, not yet, but it’s definitely on standby.
“Mmmm-kay,” John replies, but he knows it’s already too late, he’s falling fast into unconsciousness. He decides tomorrow’s goals should include staying awake for more than thirty-two minutes at a time, but he’s asleep before he can articulate the thought.
Sherlock takes a long, fortifying pull on his cigarette.
“Rather than merely penetrating an unresisting body, he took a different tack to exert his will. He began to...to stimulate me, before and during, physically coercing my body into arousal. I tried desperately to fight it, to shut down my body’s responses. I did. But I couldn’t...He was able to make me ejaculate against my will, more than once, and then used that fact to taunt me, to humiliate me.”
“Still,” Sherlock confirms. “But in the spirit of total honesty, I should tell you that I don’t, I mean I haven’t, not since I came back. It just...It’s not a lack of wanting. I think about it.  I’ve even tried, a few times. But it’s just too...it  just seemed, on balance, to be easier to avoid the entire issue altogether. I’m well versed in repressing those kinds of thoughts, so it was--not
“Hey,” he says, sounding incongruously shy. He tosses the lube on the bed, uncaps the water bottle, and hands it to John, who suddenly discovers he’s very thirsty. He had been a bit too busy to notice before.
The kiss is undeniably clumsy; there is a clacking of teeth, and after the initial press of lips Sherlock freezes, as if shocked into stillness by the boldness of the act. John pauses, considering, then tilts his head in order to better slot their mouths together, pressing forward, deepening the kiss. After his first moment of surprise passes Sherlock rallies, bringing his free hand up to cradle John’s head as they kiss, thumb stroking against his cheek as they shift against each other, seeking the perfect fit.
The man turns to look at him, his hand on the doorknob.
It was almost one in the morning before the pair made it into bed, Sherlock carefully arranging John on his side, bandaged leg on top. “I wish we had something you could take for the pain,” grumbled Sherlock, feeling guilty that he was the reason John couldn’t even keep co-codamol in the flat.
Sherlock opens the passenger side door, discreetly helps John up into the SUV.
“No,” Sherlock says, fighting to keep his face serious as returns attention to his slides. “No problem at all.”
“I know,” says Sherlock. “it’s all right.”
“So, I could do that. Study them. Somewhere quieter. You could write those memoirs you’ve talked about.”
“We’ve had sex eleven times already,” Sherlock replies.
“Why are you still talking?” Sherlock wonders aloud.
"Fuck," he swears under his breath. He pockets the penlight, reaches for the Sig Sauer tucked into the back of his trousers, flicking off the safety as he makes his way into the main storage area, stepping as quickly and quietly as he can, in order not to attract the attention of the suspect who is--
“Four days ago?” John exclaims. “What took so damn long?”
So John has nowhere else he needs to be, not really, and his concern for Sherlock keeps him close to Baker Street. Not that John would phrase it like that. Not that he even (at least consciously) thinks about it like that. But the facts are incontrovertible--aside from regular visits to Mrs. Hudson and sporadic trips to the supermarket, he’s become something of a homebody, cooking and cleaning and…
“The key card doesn’t work,” Sherlock tells him. “Lee must have locked the building down when the police arrived.”
“I couldn’t possibly. Do try to find something that crosses our considerable generational gap.”
“Mine’s Molly. Molly Hooper.”
John rubs his eyes, sighs, and sits up, scrubbing a hand though the hair at the back his head. “What time is is?” he asks, his voice rough from sleep.
“She didn’t call me. Pete Dobrev did. He knew we had a history, and...frankly, he asked me to take her off his hands.”
John sags forward heavily, leaning his weight against the headboard as the last of the aftershocks ebb from his body. he opens his eyes and looks at Sherlock beneath him, gag and collar wrapped around his neck, his body soaked in cooling sweat and marked eyebrow to thigh with semen. His eyes are still closed, his face slack and and peaceful, his mind clearly still lingering in subspace.
Mummy calls and invites him out for Christmas.
John empties his glass in a swallow, refills his his drink again and takes it upstairs. He flicks on the bedroom light, and his eyes come to rest upon the boxes of Mary’s things, waiting patiently for the trip to Oxfam.
Sherlock’s phone beeps a notification tone. Sherlock pulls it out of his pocket and glances at it, a look of satisfaction crossing his features.
“Get over here,” Sherlock finally breathes. “
“That… endearment.”
John tilts his head and studies Sherlock carefully. The look in his eyes is, somehow, simultaneously both loving and filthy with unspoken intent. He smiles.
“Okay,” John says.
Sherlock holds up a hand. It trembles just minutely.
Louellen nods. “Of course. And when push comes to shove they deal in the wetwork, same as anyone else. They have a use for Maria, I needed to get her out of town for a bit.”
“I’m sorry,” John says, low and sincere, voice slightly rough with self-recrimination. “Sherlock, I mean it. You’re being lovely to me and I am sorry.”
“Cold,” Shan mutters through chattering teeth. “Please. Very cold.”
Lately, though, John has come to wonder--no, come to
That doesn’t exactly sound promising, and John’s stomach gives a bit of a lurch. “Okay,” he says, more evenly than he feels. He turns on his side, facing Sherlock. “How about you tell me what’s going on in that big brain of yours, then, so I have the right idea.”
John is trying for a bit of levity, but Sherlock’s eyes bore into his, utterly serious.
The sounds of Sherlock’s pleasure urging him on, John settles in for a long leisurely stay, alternating attentive suction with gentle flicks of his tongue, then pulling back to blow a stream cooling air over the wet rosy tip before pulling it back into his mouth to worry it gently with his teeth before then repeating the process over again on the other side.
John huffs. “Yes, your highness. Jesus. What’s the rush, then?”
A minute later Sherlock returns to bed with a box of Kleenex, holding it out wordlessly.
“I’m not angry,” John repeats in a voice utterly devoid of inflection. “And we’re not doing this in the back of a cab.”
Alan shrugs. “Is it true?” he asks, and at least he has the decency to look ashamed while saying it.
Surveying the employees as they are herded into the lobby, Sherlock quickly identifies the head teller (the lowest level employee with access to all the cash drawers, and thus the probable target of the bank robber’s attention) and manages to subtly maneuver himself next to her as the robber momentarily looks elsewhere.
“John,” Sherlock intones flatly. “Please. Shut up.”
“I’m more than
Sherlock just looks at him for a moment, then brings his head down and kisses the bare skin of John’s belly, licks and mouths at his flesh experimentally while John strokes his hair. It’s not quite sexy--John has the oddest feeling of being sampled, of Sherlock analyzing the data he’s acquiring through his lips and tongue--but it is sweet, and he can’t help but smile when Sherlock picks his head up and proclaims, “You taste good.”
Sherlock stands up, knees cracking slightly. John turns to his left, looks at himself in the mirror. Sherlock gives him a questioning look.
If he’s being absolutely honest, he
“So how is it, then?” John asks, shifting the subject slightly to make Sherlock feel more at ease.
In the eye of the storm, Molly is curled in an enormous overstuffed recliner, soundly asleep under a ratty blanket likely older than she is. In slumber she is wizened but still innocent, somehow young and ancient all at once.
Sherlock hesitates, looking for the right words. Fails to find them.
The two men pass the rest of the trip in silence.
“As the back door requires a key, he almost certainly left through the front. He likely left his prints and traces of blood all over the banister and the inside door handle.” Sherlock steps away from the body. “Miss Hackforth, we’ve seen enough. Close the door behind us please, and don’t come in here again on your own.”
“So you two have had that conversation,” John chuckles in genuine amusement. Sherlock shrugs a bit and smiles. Of course they had.
“I should have insisted on going along,” John muses aloud.
He scrubs at his eyes, glances at the clock on top of the piano. It’s after one a.m. John hauls himself to his feet, crosses the sitting room to retrieve the message.
They grin at each other for a moment like the lovesick idiots they are. Sherlock wraps his hands around John’s arse and tilts his hips up in unmistakable invitation.
“You’re mine,” John murmurs, low and rough. “You know that, you know you’re mine.”
“Oh Goddammit,” John sighs. "That arse is criminal. That arse should be banned by the Geneva Convention.” He sits up, swings his legs over the side of the bed, sets his tea on the side table. “Come here, you gorgeous thing,” he purrs, his voice gone undeniably darker and more commanding. Sherlock moves quietly on pale, bare feet to stand in front of John at the edge of the bed. John spreads his legs, point to the rug in between the vee of his thighs. “You know where you belong, pet.”
“You should have said something.”
John pauses, considers, decides to take a chance.
“How do you even -- ”
“Oh.” Sherlock hadn’t even quite realized he was so hard, but now with John fondling him the ache and need sparks into sudden flame, grown too strong to ignore. He gasps softly, pressing into John’s caressing palm.
The next day John doesn’t have work, so he has a lie-in for the first time in months.
“John,” he says, fighting hard to keep his voice even, “surely you’re not so stupid that you can’t parse the profound psychological difference between what we do and actually being forcibly imprisoned.”
"Morning," he murmurs, nonchalant as he picks up his coffee cup and drinks, eyes still on the laptop screen.
“Shift down a bit, then,” John says, and Sherlock wriggles himself downwards until their erect cocks are pressing together, delicate skin rubbing and sliding with a delicious friction. Far too lazy and sleepy to find the lube, John wets his palm with a few swipes of his tongue and wraps his hand around both of them, making Sherlock buries his face into the curve of John’s neck and shoulder as he makes a sweet, soft sigh of enjoyment.
Doctor Sheldon, to his credit, stops just short of rolling his eyes, but John can clearly see him fighting the impulse.
When John turns to answer Sherlock pushes him against the wall, cups large warm hands around his head and kisses him, greedy and desperate, mouth open, tongue wet and seeking.
“Gotcha,” Glenn replies. He positions another pillow behind John’s neck, pulls a blanket from the narrow closet and tucks it around John’s pale bare legs. “Call button’s right here. Your guy coming back soon, I hope?”
“We were afraid,” John says. “Of different things, and for different reasons, but we were both afraid.”
John presses his lips to the reddening mark his fingers left behind. “You’re such a desperate little whore,” he purrs against Sherlock’s skin, “so hungry for it, it’s beautiful. You just can’t control yourself tonight. Can you?”
“Well-earned, I’d say.” John runs possessive fingers down the crest of a slim hip. “I really do like it,” he murmurs. “Is that weird?”
“I know you’re not feeling yourself, but I need to tell you something very important, and it can’t wait. Are you listening?”
“No,” Sherlock says. “I mean, yes, I mean--okay. I would like you to stay. Just let me--”
“No,” John growls roughly. He pulls the coat out of Sherlock’s hands, tosses it aside, crowding into Sherlock’s space, backing him up to the edge of the kitchen table. "No more running, Sherlock.”
Jim nods once. “You’re an observant woman, Molly.” He turns his attention back to the board, contemplating, calculating. “Bet you’re a good player. Do you beat him often?”
(It also occurs to him to save that observation for another, less emotionally vulnerable moment, so maybe he is actually learning a thing or two along the way.)
A short while later, Sherlock is curled into a tight ball under the sheets, trying and failing to recapture elusive slumber when John speaks again, low and gentle.
John is quiet for a moment, not quite sure what to say.
These feelings, these powerful and terrifying waves of fear and shame and excitement and dizzying erotic pleasure -- it’s a drug. He sees this. It’s drug that is in some ways very much like the drugs he’s been so drawn to in the past, but also completely different, complex and nuanced and (if he’s being honest) incomparably superior, a cocktail of neurotransmitters and hormones and endorphins that produce a dizzying, soaring high far more compelling and addictive than any opiate could ever hope to be.
Late that evening he texts Sherlock.
“Thanks,” he mumbles. “Didn’t mean to fall asleep.”
(John is shockingly, inventively filthy-mouthed when intimate and Sherlock loves it, loves the contrast between the reserve of his public face and his frank, unashamed lewdness when he’s naked in Sherlock’s bed.)
“Good boy,” John murmurs approvingly, stroking his naked flank with a warm calloused fingers. “Soon you’ll get all you can take and more, I promise. But it’s my job to decide what you get. Not yours. Do you know why?”
John looks over at him and smiles, a rictus stretched over a skull.
“In fact,” Sherlock continues, “I believe you need to get me out of these wet clothes and into a warm bed. Immediately.”
John Watson.”
“In a...professional capacity,” he mutters. “So to speak.”
Sherlock whines a bit but stills the movement of his hips, resisting the impulse to thrust while revelling in the denial, in his obedience to John over the demands of his weak and willful body.
“I know. Your skin tone and colour were clearly indicative.” Sherlock sets the glass on the table and pauses to turn on the small bedside lamp before looking John over with his careful, analytical gaze.
Mary aims her gun at Sherlock’s forehead, her face pale and damp but her hand perfectly sure and steady. “Insult me some more, and you’ll see how slow I am.”
On the twelfth morning, John wakes early to a still-deeply asleep Sherlock sprawled out next to him, one arm flung across the safe zone between them, his hair a riot, his full lips parted as he snores just ever so slightly.
“Okay,” John says breathless from laughing. “Turn around and look where you’re going, please, you’re going to fall and break something, I’m right behind you, I promise.” Sherlock reluctantly breaks away, turns to step into the tub. John follows him, not too proud to admire the impressive view of his bare, round, inexplicably plump arse. Once they’re in the tub Sherlock turns and bends to kiss him again, large hands pressing against the small of his back, and John succumbs to his urges and grabs hold of Sherlock’s rear, relishing the feel of that one soft place on his hard, spare body, giving a low, involuntary growl as he pulls their bodies flush against each other. Their hips don’t align--height difference--but the feel of Sherlock’s wet naked skin against his cock is still amazing, makes John gasp with pleasure as Sherlock sighs, tilts his hips, rutting gently against John’s stomach.
Sherlock fiddles with the house number plate to the right of the doorframe, flipping it up to reveal a hidden keypad and thumbprint reader. He enters a string of numbers from memory and presses his thumb into the glass circle; an LED at the bottom of the keypad lights up green in approval as an electronic lock in the front door whirs and clicks. Sherlock opens the door, guiding John carefully ahead of him and over the threshold.
Sherlock shakes himself out of his brief reverie--he could think about John’s eyes for days, can even admit that to himself now without embarrassment, but that doesn’t mean it’s a wise use of mental capacity or time--and slides his arms into the sleeves of a crisp pale-grey buttondown. “I was thinking,” he says casually, as if he hadn’t a care in the world what John thought of the idea, “We ought to do it out at the house. There’s a registrar’s office not far away, and we could have some people over for a small...thing...after.”
just fuck me, God, I need you to fuck me.”
“John,” Sherlock finally says, soft and apologetic. “I don’t think we can get any closer without the dog alerting them to our presence. There’s really not much else we can do here.”
Sherlock huffed out a frustrated breath. “I can’t sleep.”
John felt dread clench at his guts, leaving a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. Not once in his life, had he felt so lost and afraid, so inadequate. He felt like he was back in Afghanistan praying to God, only this time it wasn't his life on the line, but the life of the man he loved so much that he would do anything it took to keep him alive. But there was nothing he could do but pray and praying seemed so pointless, like a waste of time. It wasn't enough. And it made him feel sick.
“You are thinking. It annoys me.” The words spat out of his mouth as Sherlock tried to hide his emotions from John, but his expression betrayed him, fear apparent on his face.
Sherlock merely huffed. The pain had spread to the right side of his head now, and it was becoming harder to hide his discomfort. He could feel beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead and he was sweating through his T-shirt, the fabric sticking to his back. He hoped that John was too intoxicated to notice.
life. He needed stimulation, the thrill of excitement, the rush he got from exposing himself to danger. Sherlock went to great lengths not to be bored. He loved the feeling of adrenaline surging through his body, the way all his senses seemed heightened when he was jumping across rooftops, chasing criminals down dark alleys. Not that John could blame him—he was equally addicted to adrenaline. Only one month after returning from Afghanistan, he had already missed the way he felt strong in the face of danger; he had a craving for unpredictability. It was ironic; having the possibility of death so close made him feel more alive.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you come to your senses then?”
“Sherlock, we need to get you to the hospital,” John's wavering voice came from in front of him, and Sherlock felt John's weight lift away from the bed, making him feel even more alone, lost in the endless darkness. The auditory input wasn't enough for him. Sherlock needed to see him, to touch him, to feel him with every fibre of his trembling body. As the familiar weight of John's body was gone, the distance between them suddenly felt longer. He felt as if they were a million miles apart; he couldn't feel John's breath tickling his skin anymore, nor could he smell the faint odour of his body lingering in his nostrils. He craved John's touch, he wanted John's lips pressed against his forehead, soothing him, he needed John to tell him he loved him, that he wouldn't leave him.
John rubbed a hand over his face and sighed. Regardless if he wanted it or not, Sherlock crowded his thoughts, and instead of the usual affection that flooded his whole being when he thought of Sherlock, he couldn’t help but feel anger creeping into his chest, swelling and growing until it was hard to breathe, the emotion choking his lungs.
“No…” Sherlock said again, making John look up quickly. He was sounding hesitant now: “John, I—“
Didn’t he see? Didn’t he
“Thanks,” Sherlock muttered. The word felt clumsy in his mouth. He grabbed the sides of the blanket and clutched it tighter around himself. He was perfectly awake now, his brain taking in the rate, rhythm and depth of John’s breathing, the duration of his audible swallows, the opening and closing of his hands, the anxious shuffle from one socked foot to the other. With a feeling of increasing disquiet, he sensed the air of uneasiness John seemed to be exuding. It was evident that he was uncomfortable and even ashamed—of his outburst or something else, Sherlock didn’t know—but there was something else in his manner that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
John deserved so much more.
life is going to die. We don’t know.” He hated those words. Every time he heard them, something painful tugged at his chest, making him want to shout in frustration. He wanted to let down his guard and release the anger that boiled inside him, he wanted to hit something, rip something—anything—apart. He wanted to cry at the unfairness of it all, but he knew it was futile, so he maintained his composure like a proper soldier, harbouring the sense of frustration inside, letting it grow like a snowball rolling downhill, gaining momentum every second.
John let his mouth curve into a smile as he listened to the soft sound of his breathing. John wanted to reach out and touch him, to caress his cheek and feel the slight stubble that had begun to form on his chin, stroke his curls away from his forehead, run his fingers lightly over his cheek. He had an unbearable need to touch him, to kiss him, to hold him, but he contained himself, not wanting to wake him. As much as he already missed hearing his deep baritone voice, John knew that Sherlock needed the rest.
P.S. Comments and kudos mean the world to me, thank you for leaving them!
“Sherlock—“
“You don’t have to explain.”
He had watched Sherlock walk further and further away, his silhouette vanishing in the dark night, and he had tried to force his legs to move with all the force he could muster—God, he had tried—but they wouldn’t obey his will, wouldn’t obey the simple command to run, leaving him standing alone on the cold, wet tarmac.
Abruptly, the wail of a siren floated in from the street and assaulted his ears, bristling the hair at the back of his neck. Goosebumps erupted over his forearms and his face contorted with indignation.
Sherlock was alone and it was all John's fault. He was a
Sherlock found it more difficult to deduce John when he couldn’t see the expression on his face. He wanted to know if there was a frown between his eyebrows, if his lips were pressed into a tight line. Was he smiling? Probably not. Was there pity in his eyes? Probably. He tried to focus on his voice instead, but it was free from any obvious emotion, and Sherlock didn’t like guessing. Much to his frustration, John’s voice being hoarse from lack of use—it was still early, and there had been more kissing than talking—was the only thing he could be certain of.
“I'm here. I'm here, love, and I'm not leaving.”
Sherlock scoffed. “Please, do be sensible, John. You haven't even taken your mobile phone out of your pocket, how would you know?” His voice was still slurry from the medication, but his annoyance was apparent.
John pulled the front door open, and with a sense of guilt gnawing at his heart, stepped outside into the brisk morning air.
Using the last of his strength, he forced his eyes open.
Not that Sherlock could blame him if he did; he was aware of the serious ramifications that his blindness had for their relationship. There was no possibility that their romantic relationship, which was built on the foundation of reciprocal giving and receiving, as well as mutual wants and needs, would continue to be mutually beneficial if John was forced to take care of him, constantly having to mollycoddle him and see to his every need, while he himself couldn’t give John what he craved—rooftop chases, heart-rushing fights, adrenaline-laden pursuits. There wasn’t anything of value he could offer to a man addicted to danger, not without his eyesight. He was nothing without his all-seeing, ever-observant eyes.
I'd love to hear what you think! (If you hate it, please, don't let me know.)
Clenching his jaw, John swallowed against the lump of misery forming in his throat, his nails digging half-moons into his palms. He was yet again seized by the urge to weep uncontrollably, the beginnings of tears already prickling at his eyes. With a twinge of mingled annoyance and anguish, he pressed the heels of his hands against them, willing the tears not to fall. He seemed to have an inexhaustible supply of them, he thought bitterly. They always seemed to come when he was alone, looming just below the surface, threatening to spill over the instant he let his guard down.
The fear that he wasn’t enough for Sherlock was nagging at the back of his mind, sending a shiver down his spine. John closed his eyes, battling the stinging sensation behind his eyelids that threatened to turn him into a sobbing mess. The events of the day, John thought, had transformed him into a coward, into a man incapable of controlling his inner turmoil.
John knew deep inside that he would never stop loving Sherlock. He couldn’t stop loving him even if he tried, and God knew he had tried. He really had.
John sighed and drew the buzzing device from his pocket. He had never been good at saying no to Sherlock, never been able to deny him anything. All his instincts told him to obey Sherlock, obey without questioning. There were six new messages, all from Greg Lestrade.
He didn't trust his voice enough to speak. Clenching his fists at his sides, he let out a shuddering breath and managed a nod.
“I could just—”
he had told someone. His brother, convinced of his own superiority, never respected Sherlock’s ability to make his own decisions, never respected him enough to leave him alone. Sherlock let the breath out and shifted his gaze from the roses. He knew there was no use wasting his energy thinking about his idiotic brother.
Because Sherlock trusts him.
“We still need a good wash,” John says, “but that’ll keep for later.” He tosses the soiled shirt back to the floor, collapses back into the tangled sheets next to Sherlock.
“No,” John says, soft but not kind, taking his hand away from Sherlock’s skin. “Not until you’ve been put right.”
But he can learn how to become worthy of John Watson. He may not succeed all or even most of the time, but he has the rest of his life to devote to the undertaking.
She looks ten years older than the last time John saw her, likely due to illness and rough living. Her skin is rough-textured and heavily made up to hide her poor health, but the drawn pallor of her face is still visible beneath beige foundation. A bright slash of rouge burns high on her cheeks, blue eyes are lined in harsh black liner, her lips are sticky with candy pink gloss. Her hair is covered by a grey and black paisley patterned headscarf, pinned just under her chin and tucked into the collar of a lumpy, knitted grey sweater coat that goes nearly to her knees. She is wearing her usual turned up jeans, and the chunky black boots on her feet look like they may be a size or two too big, perhaps nicked from Jennifer Hallman several days earlier.
“Shh, pet. I’m here,” he whispered. “You’re doing so well. I’m so proud of you. Shh.”
After awhile John sleeps as well, comforted by the warmth and nearness of Sherlock’s body.
“You like those,” Sherlock says, pointing to a square box in the freezer case. “The sausages made by the blonde woman who died of cancer.”
“Working here is not going to end well. When the DEA catches up to Christopher D'Annibale -- and they will, undoubtedly, maybe not right away, but someday soon -- you’re going to get caught up in it, and I am certain it won’t go smoothly for you.”
John pulls out the printout of the magnified scale, places it on the workbench between them.
“I have an idea,” he says after a bit of thought, climbing off Sherlock. He grabs a pillow and folds it in two, shoves it under his head as he lies back in the hopelessly tangled sheets.
“You’re welcome,” Patricia says, with perhaps ten percent less dislike in her tone than earlier, which is far better than Sherlock usually does in these sorts of situations.
“I love you too,” he says. He’s happy, he’s so damn happy, open and sated in this gorgeous unashamed moment, John’s softening cock still in his arse and beginning to sting but even that feels perfect in its pure human postcoital awkwardness.
In death, she is utterly indistinguishable from human as she was in life.
Sometimes, he thinks
“Nope?” Sherlock asks, in mock consternation.
“Really? Because it’s certainly reading that way to me.”
The minutes crawl by at a torturous pace. The chatter of the telly fades into a blur of white noise, the nuances of language belonging to a land beyond Sherlock’s comprehension. His knees are killing him, his shoulders sore. He’s endured far worse, of course;  this is nothing compared to what he’s regularly encountered in the course of his unconventional career, and he welcomes the discomfort, enjoys the way it grounds him, keeps him present in his body, the needs and demands of his flesh keeping him blank and mindless.
“A change of scenery always helps,” Glenn proclaims, guiding John to the recliner, arranging pillows to support him, and making sure his IV is secure and flowing freely. “I bet some fresh sheets on the bed and something cold to drink would fix you right up.”
“Um, three. The front, the back door from the kitchen, and there’s a basement door but that’s been padlocked for years. I’ve never opened it. I don’t think there’s even a key for it any longer.”
“Okay, whatever verb you’d like to use to describe what you're doing. Please stop. Sit down and wait with me.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock says, anxious, “I’m sorry -- I should get the -- ”
He has answers--well, some answers--but he doesn’t feel the slightest bit better.
“Would you like to--” he starts, but John stops him with a gentle hand on his chest.
“Yes, and well done, you. But two hours wedged into a Ford Focus are a drop in the bucket of what you actually need.”
These moments are where the entire bewildering tangle of his damaged and fragile psyche is laid bare, every nerve and fiber twitching, raw and exposed.
“See, that wasn’t actually an answer,” he observes.
“--and I’ve come to realise, not just tonight, but--thinking it over, thinking as rationally, as objectively as I can, I see that I’ve made the mistake of thinking that the only way I can live with this thing that happened to me is to put it in a box and seal it up, and never look at it again, but that’s not a real answer, either, is it? I don’t…” He pauses, shakes his head. “I don’t want to live like that. I don’t have the right answer yet, not exactly, but I know that hiding and pretending it didn’t happen is keeping me from you. Keeping me from
Sherlock was a werewolf. That fact was still sinking in. John could very well still be in shock and to think that he could have been on a date last night! What if he had been on the date? What if this was just some crazy alcohol-induced dream he was having and he hadn’t quite woken up yet to face the morning with a horrendous hangover? No, the atmosphere was far too serious for it to be a dream of any sort; despite the fantasy element of the werewolf factor everything seemed very real, too real for the scenario to be a dream.
He figured he ought to get to work on helping him, so he retrieved the heat pads, slipping them where he could in the position Sherlock was in, on the main muscles that he remembered being affected the most. He left once again only to get his med kit, cleaning the tiny tear on Sherlock’s arm and wrapping it. He was tired, yes, but he didn’t want to leave Sherlock alone, so he sat on the other side of the bed to keep an eye on him, calming himself by stroking the man’s hair beside him. He knew Sherlock would never allow it but somehow John couldn’t seem to help himself from imagining Sherlock wagging his tail in silent approval.
Greg picked up quickly, to which John was thankful for. “Greg?” he said quickly, taking a step away from his sulking friend. “Yeah, I am so sorry. Sherlock didn’t tell me he’d agreed to come in today, which he shouldn’t have done.” he said, directing a glare at Sherlock. “It turns out he can’t go to the scene today. You understand he was injured pretty badly on a... private case. Yes, I know he said he was fine, but you know Sherlock.” He laughed. “I don’t think he’s ready to go out yet. No, no, it’s alright, he just hasn’t quite finished recovering yet, that’s all. Yeah, he’s driving me up the wall... Listen Greg, could I come down tomorrow to collect the files, perhaps? I’m sure he could help from home I-” he paused, smiling. “Yes, thank you. I appreciate it. You know how he can get without a case. We can talk later. Yeah, alright, cheers.” He hung up, raising his hands defensively. “Alright? Done. No problem. You’ve got a case, now you can stop sulking.”
Sherlock let out a growl that could only be described as something similar to a cat’s purr. It was a much deeper sound and if it had not been heard within this current scenario, it could have been taken as something quite threatening. But with Sherlock’s tail beating away happily and his eyes closed contently, it was clearly a sign of enjoyment. However, the enjoyment soon ended as Sherlock realised what he was doing and snapped out of his daydream, shaking his head out of John’s grasp causing the tailing wagging and purring to cease.
John stomped down the stairs, cursing under his breath and checking his phone once more. “Shut that bloody window, will you? It’s freezing!” the doctor snapped at the detective, going to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.
“Hunters, John.”
John swallowed and nodded, sitting up straight. As Mycroft said, Sherlock would be weak. He would need John’s help, and it was John’s job to make sure he’d be alright. “Right then.” he said stiffly, getting up and making his way towards his bedroom with a slight limp in his step. “I’ll just get my things, like you said he’ll be awake soon and I want to get to work on that arm before there’s any more damage. Make yourself another cuppa, if you like.”
“Well how am I supposed to know?” John responded incredulously. “What do you normally do on full moons then, when you’re not a blood thirsty werewolf? Just... stay in the flat, watch telly or something?”
I'm incredibly sorry for the insane time gap between when I last posted, there's a whole story around that which I'll explain at the end but if anyone at all is still interested in this story you should all know that I've made the executive decision to delete the chapters surrounding the case. Personally I felt it was just a massive side track from the story I am trying to tell. Maybe I'll write it up again one day and publish it separately.
Then, without warning, the sudden crack of a gunshot cut through the air like steel.
Sherlock stared into John’s eyes, looking deep into them as he spoke more words of reassurance, words that were supposed to make him feel better – they weren’t. His breathing increased and his jaw had slowly set in anger. Sherlock snorted roughly through his nose and turned his head away from John’s before his body followed. He started to pace, his anger evident in every footstep.
“Great, so I have a massive fucking werewolf in the middle of the living room with a split personality? Yeah, amazing, I see it now.” he retorted sarcastically through his teeth. He cringed suddenly as he watched the wolf slam itself into the wall, suddenly grateful that Mrs. Hudson was away visiting her sister; he wondered if Sherlock or Mycroft had organised that.
John didn't understand - no - he couldn’t understand; he couldn’t know what was really going on. "John- I'm fine, really." he insisted but deep down he knew he wasn't. It wasn’t normally as bad as this, usually it was just uncomfortably warm but this... this was unbearable and his head! "I just need some water," he lied once more to his friend as he got up to walk towards the kitchen before completely falling on his ass on the living room floor.
“Yes, yeah, it’s me. Right here.” he said, nodding quickly. “It’s fine, just relax, it won’t hurt as bad after this,” he explained, finding a vein in Sherlock’s arm and injecting the painkiller. He took hold of Sherlock’s hand, moving his arm as carefully as he could and stared at the large wound, lips pressed into a tight frown. “I’ve got to get this stitch up. I’m sorry. This’ll probably hurt.” he murmured, opening an antiseptic pad and pressing it to the injury, eyes still on Sherlock’s face. He’d been a wolf a minute ago.
“No,” John said firmly, looking into Sherlock’s eyes. “Sherlock you’re hurt.” he stated loudly as he tightened his hold when the man tried to pull free, keeping him still. “Why can’t you just tell me what’s bothering you?”
“No, no,
There was a long pause as John went about cleaning out the wound. “The drugs should have kicked in by now, I’ll start to stitch your arm and back.”
“You weren’t just acting strange, Sherlock. For God’s sake, I know your sense of smell gets better closer to a change, but you could have been a little less obvious when you were
“So what if I act a little strange?” Sherlock defended. “Doesn’t everybody?”
“What do you mean amazing? What could possibly be so damn amazing about my current situation?!” John whispered incredulously.
The wolf narrowed his eyes at John, leaning into his face closely and sniffing around it carefully. John let out a quiet squeak and squeezed his eyes shut as the wolf’s cold nose brushed his face.
Sherlock was keeping himself busy. He had started learning Braille by self-study. He was spending hours walking around the flat, memorising distances in the different rooms, calculating how many steps there were from his chair to the music stand by the window, from the music stand to the sofa. He locked himself in his room for hours, examining different textures, running his fingers over hundreds of materials from his silk dressing gowns to ground oregano. And John was half-relieved that Sherlock was trying to make the best of the situation, half-worried that Sherlock wasn’t trusting him enough to ask for help. John knew that he should be glad that Sherlock didn’t let his blindness stop him, that he was trying to adjust to the situation. And he was glad, he really was. But Sherlock wasn’t talking to him, he had closed himself off completely, shut John out, and it was driving John crazy. John wanted to be there for him, but he didn't know how, and he was angry at himself for not being brave enough to talk, for not trying hard enough. Sherlock was coping, and all John could do was sit there and watch.
I'm so sorry!!! This chapter has taken me way too long to write. Thanks to everyone who has stuck around, I really appreciate it :)
Sighing heavily in response, John replied, “I know, Sherlock, me too. But the sooner we get you dressed, the sooner they can get started. They want to examine your eyes and do some blood tests. It shouldn’t take too long. Here, let me help you.”
“Alright,” John said, ignoring the sudden tightness in his throat, “of course.”
“What—” John paused for a moment, studying Sherlock's face. “Greg. His name is Greg.”
“Thank you, John.”
who needs some time?”
“John.” His voice was still faint but more urgent. Sherlock frowned, his brows knitting together, and his eyes fluttered open.
He let out an irritated huff. His brain was getting out of control, Sherlock thought bitterly, slowly rotting away, taken over by ridiculous, irrelevant thoughts born out of stagnation. It was due to lack of intellectual stimulation, that much was obvious. His mind was starving for a mental challenge, for the unadulterated bliss of intense focus; it needed something to fixate on—a problem, a puzzle, a case, anything. Anything else than the dull, monotonous blackness that seemed to hang over him like a shroud, wrapping itself around him, tighter and tighter with each passing day.
“We really need to talk.”
Their first kiss had been natural, as if they had both known all along that they were heading toward that moment. It had started out tentative and soft and lovely, but had grown quickly more demanding, as if they were trying to make up for all the lost years. John had never felt so happy, so perfectly right. Despite feeling like he had waited forever to be kissed like that, John's life didn't culminate in that moment; rather, it began a new chapter in an old story, their story.
He wanted to make Sherlock feel better, to make him feel loved, but he didn't know how to do it when he himself felt so afraid.
“Oh God, I love you,” John whispered aloud, although he knew Sherlock couldn’t hear him. His voice was hoarse with emotion, and John instantly cringed as his eyes threatened to fill with tears. He didn’t know why he felt the urge to cry, and he was too exhausted to think any further on the matter. Instead, he blinked several times, forcing the tears to stay back.
He fought the heaviness in his eyelids, but the tiredness he was experiencing threatened to overtake him, pulling him back into unconsciousness. His thoughts incomplete and unformed, Sherlock gave up the fight and surrendered to his exhaustion.
John nodded, encouraging him to continue. Sherlock frowned impatiently, and John realised that he couldn't see him, didn't see him nod. John pressed his eyes closed, fighting the emotions threatening to break through to the surface again. “Yeah?” John forced the word out of his mouth, cringing at the sound of his voice.
But Sherlock hadn’t heard him. He hadn’t turned back.
John checked his mobile phone, but there were no new messages. For a moment, his finger hovered over the keys, wondering what to tell Greg. He didn't want to tell him that Sherlock was blind; writing it down would make it more concrete, more real, more tangible. He didn't want to think about it. The denial helped him feel safe. Finally, he came to the conclusion that there was no good way to say it, and typed his message and sent it off.
John pressed his lips gently against his, wanting to kiss away the trembling.
“I can ask the nurse to give you something to help you—”
“It’s fine.”
“I’m fine, John.” There was no sign of Sherlock’s usual annoyance at his fussing, and John wasn’t sure whether to be glad or not.
John wished that Sherlock would just drop the subject; he didn't want to think about the messages, he didn't want to think about anything except Sherlock. The only thing that mattered to John was that Sherlock would be all right. Everything else could wait. “It's nothing important.”
It had been a week since they had had any conversation except the mundane. It almost felt like they were back in the time when they hadn’t yet confessed their feelings for each other, before they were together. Their conversation had been reduced to pointless, laconic chatter, which John desperately tried to keep up. And he was tired of small talk, sick of feeling as if he were talking to a brick wall. He didn’t want to talk one more time about the surprisingly cold weather, or the increasing prices at Tesco, or how they were out of milk again, and he most certainly didn’t want to get another nonchalant grunt in reply.
“Oh,” he uttered dumbly. His first impulse was to deny it, but just as he was about to open his mouth, a shudder rippled its way through his body, and he thought it best to remain silent.
“You all right, Sherlock?”
“I know I don't have to,” John said, his voice strangled. “The thing is, Sherlock, that I want to.”
John was dragged out of his reverie when the mounting strain in his forearms became too distracting. With a barely repressed groan, John pushed himself up into a sitting position, his left shoulder aching in protest, and then scooted backward until his naked back connected with the wall. The surface was pleasantly cool against his skin, which made him realise just how stuffy the air was. Beads of moisture stood out on his forehead and upper lip, and a rivulet of sweat was trickling its way down his chest toward his navel. It was August, and the upstairs bedroom always got hot in the summer, the tall windows permitting sunlight to pour in like liquid honey, painting the pale-green walls in golden hues and making one’s nude skin sticky and slick. It was considerably cooler in the downstairs bedroom, but, keeping in mind that Mrs Hudson—the landlady, who lived on the ground floor—had an excellent hearing, spending the nights in John’s—and now their—bedroom had felt like a sensible compromise when the physical part of their relationship had advanced to more than just kissing.
“You don't have to be here, John.”
His heart sank slightly as he saw a flash of bitter agony cross Sherlock’s face. “Right. I—I’ll be back soon.”
A voice in the back of his mind was trying to tell him that he had been too slow, slow to observe, slow to realise that the consuming darkness was gone, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Choosing to blame the drugs rather than his brain, he pushed the thought aside and ignored the voice that was trying to make him feel stupid and incompetent.
The ticking of the wall clock was driving him crazy, it was pushing him to the brink of sanity. The sound became amplified in his head; it was echoing off the bone of his skull, drowning out all other auditory input.
“Okay. Good. It’s—good.”
“Welcome back, love,” John whispered.
Suddenly, John was aware of Sherlock standing in front of him. Caught off guard, John gazed up at him, not knowing what to say. He cleared his throat and swallowed. “You alright?”
John couldn’t prevent a chuckle from escaping his lips. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, staring at the doctor, unbelieving. Sherlock had suddenly lost his eyesight and no one knew why, not even the best doctors in London, but yeah, there was absolutely no need to worry, John thought sardonically while shaking his head in disbelief.
“Sherlock?”
Mycroft sighed and raised his eyes again to meet John's gaze. He pursed his lips, as if considering whether or not to share his thoughts, and John could see the hesitation in his eyes. Mycroft opened his mouth, but then closed it. After what felt like minutes, he sighed again.
And it was at that moment John knew where he had to be, what he had to do. He felt like he was back on the battlefield, his heart filled with courage, ready to fight for his love, for Sherlock. He rose from the cushioned waiting room chair, straightened his back and squared his shoulders, settling into a soldier's stance.
He was dangerous, because he had crashed into John's life, all of a sudden, without warning, and turned it around, setting off an earthquake inside him, throwing everything he once knew to be true into disarray. John had been living alone, night after night haunted by nightmares, languishing in miserable loneliness. He had returned from Afghanistan injured and traumatised, unable to see the meaning of life, feeling lost and broken. Then he had met Sherlock Holmes, and their friendship had saved his life, changing it irrevocably.
“That’s fine,” John replies mildly, stroking Sherlock’s hair, reveling in being allowed this simple, longed-for intimacy, gently twining springy curls between his fingers. “I like the way my name sounds in your mouth. That’s enough for me.”
“I love you,” John  whispers, fierce and pure in his devotion.
“Try the door,” he says, handing the card to a dripping wet and drowned-looking Sherlock before turning back to Lee.
Sitting alone on a park bench, his tea long since gone cold, John takes a deep breath and tries saying the truth out loud for the first time in his entire life.
“You want a coffee?” John asks, dropping into the seat next to Sherlock.
fucked absolutely blind all in the same day really takes it out of a person.
Sherlock opens both eyes to glare at him properly, and Jesus Christ that was a mistake. He closes his eyes with a pained groan.
“I don’t mind taking care of you,” Sherlock tells him. “I don’t mind it all. In fact, that seems to be the very point I’m trying to prove here, either to you or to myself or to anyone else that cares to notice. I am both able and very willing to care for you. If you would be so kind as to just
“Hmm?”
“They did, at least on this end. However, the beauty of government espionage is while secrecy is a professed virtue, government bureaucracy is frankly inevitable. There’s always a file full of paperwork, somewhere. If you know where to look. Frankly, Mycroft built his entire career upon this fact.”
“Pedantic git,” John murmurs good-naturedly. “Okay, I just wondered if...   when you were in school. Did they, um, employ corporal punishment?”
about a case, John.”
“I do,” Sherlock says. “God, yes. Absolutely.”
“So much new information,” Sherlock says, sounding half distracted, the way he does when he’s already deep in thought. “Her last name, her residence in New Jersey...she’s bound to pop up again soon, John. I’m certain of it. The trick is knowing where to look.”
So John goes slow, inch by agonizingly slow inch, and the feel of Sherlock opening up inside for him, of accommodating him, of taking him in--it’s the most unbearably aroused he’s ever been in his whole life, his pelvis aching and heavy with need. He’s two-thirds in when Sherlock brings his legs up and locks them around John’s waist. “Come on,” he whispers. “I want all of you, now.” John’s frayed self-control snaps and he buries himself fully into Sherlock in one hard thrust. Sherlock cries out, grabbing John’s shoulders, fingers digging painfully into his deltoids as he shivers and gasps against him.
“Yes, John.”
“I love when you’re like this,” John rasps, his voice gone raw and ragged, his own demons set loose and running free. “When you’re crying from the pain, shivering and sweating, raw and open down to your very bones. When I take you apart like this I can see all of you, I can see and feel everything you are. You’re split wide open and you can’t hide from me like this, everything inside of you belongs to me and I love it.
“I want to see you come,” he breathes out in between grunting, panting gasps. “Yeah, I want it, I want to see it.”
Sherlock shrugs, a shift of a single silk-clad shoulder. “Mrs. Hudson brings me food.”
Yesterday morning, at the scene of the third homicide, Donovan suggested that perhaps the murderer was a Klingon. Sherlock had literally chased her from the room.
“I’m glad,” John says. They stay like that for several peaceful minutes.
“No gloves,” Sherlock observes. “Your protocols are lax indeed.”
The sky behind them is still clear, though, except for a few wisps of thin clouds scudding low across the horizon. The pale peach and pink beams of sunrise illuminate the landscape from the east, the skyscrapers of the city proper rising in the distance as they cross the bridge over the Delaware River, returning to Philadelphia.
“Next time,” John murmurs into the side of his neck. “We’re doing this properly. Third date rule.”
Jim nods and moves to Seb’s side, drapes a possessive arm around Sebastian. “Did you miss me, Tiger?"
Sherlock shakes his head. “I’m not,” he murmurs, soft and a little sad, and it breaks John’s heart in two.
Here’s a key difference between thirty and forty: at forty, one will inevitably fall asleep if one stretches out on the sofa, no matter how much one is brooding and stewing in angry frustration over one’s arsehole fiance.
Mycroft knocks on the raised glass partition; the driver lowers it several inches, and they exchange a few murmured words.
They make it halfway down the empty street before John turns away from Sherlock and vomits without warning, spinach and cheese and stomach acid pouring out of him and splattering on the pavement, the sound loud and violent in the silent predawn darkness.
Lestrade has the good grace to look away, ashamed.
But he doesn’t do it.
Sherlock doesn’t black out, exactly; it's more like a greying out of several blurry, indistinct minutes, and when he finally reacquaints with reality he’s sitting in his chair, holding a cooling mug of tea John pressed into his hands moments earlier.
“Okay,” he whispers at last. “As long as we’re together. Okay.”
“My remarkable powers of observation,” Sherlock murmurs as he picks up a pair of plaid flannel boxers John gratefully recognises as his own. Sherlock again kneels down onto the tile floor, ignoring the rivulets of water that are sure to seep into his trousers. “Grab the bar, other hand on my shoulder.”
Molly gives a minute shake of her head, seems to fold in on herself, shrinking into her faded cardigan. “Uh. I don’t--”
“John,” Sherlock says, cutting him off. “Remember how you asked me for a list?”
“What I want is you,” Sherlock murmurs.
“What do you think, John?” Sherlock asks, pointedly.
Moments pass.
“All right,” David says. “Good. It’s very unexpected but… I think it will be very good.”
Lee nods. “A couple years back, there was a bit of a power shuffle in the crime world. I believe you two know something about that?”
John took a deep breath, found his proper frame of mind, and reached out to weave his fingers into the dark tangled mane of Sherlock’s hair. Then he pulled. Hard.
“From where I stand, you're the
Sherlock’s still on alert, his posture wary.
With a wave of Maria's hand, the engine of the black van parked nearby roars to life. The headlights come up, bright halogen spotlighting the tableau: Sherlock’s kneeling frame casting a long shadow across the floor, the harsh blue-white beams illuminating the sharp planes of Mary’s face, making her look even more haggard, bordering on ghoulish.
“So that’s on the table now,” muses John. “We would need to talk about this more. A lot more. But I think, yeah, I would be open to something like that.”
And then the wave passes and his body slumps forward, his lungs still gasping for air. John’s strong arms encircle him, keeping him from falling as the powerful aftershocks make him shiver uncontrollably, John guides him down onto the blanket spread across the floor, gently eases the slick silicone plug from his body. He’s barely cognizant of the wetness covering him, coating his chest and belly and trickling out of his arse, sticky and rapidly cooling, or of John unbuckling the heavy black cuffs that tether his hands to his thighs.
“You okay?” Sherlock asks him quietly, and the soft tenderness in his voice, the sweetness of it like dark amber honey--it still somehow surprises John a bit, even after everything they’ve been through, after everything they’ve shared.
“I’m going to --” Sherlock begins, then pauses. “I need to stay out of sight, but I’ll maintain constant visual contact.” Sherlock presses closer to John, and in the small space between their bodies, mostly hidden from view, his strong slender fingers wrap tight around John’s wrist, shockingly strong. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he says with sudden urgency.
“You’re Sherlock Holmes,” she says, before turning to John. The warmth of her affect ratchets up several notches.
Jefferson nods.
(His cock, however, is a stupid foolish appendage that knows what it likes and doesn’t seem to much care what the rest of him thinks, staying resolutely hard and eager despite Sherlock’s best attempts to get his sympathetic nervous system under some semblance of control.)
Mycroft looks pinched and tense, clearly dying to say something, to pass judgment. For some unknown reason, though, he only peers closely at Sherlock, takes a deep breath, and speaks not one word about John Watson.
He had talked with Greg and the man had told him to relax. Greg had tried to reassure him that it had only been a week and everything would go back to normal eventually. The word ‘normal’ had sounded so absurd coming out of his mouth, his voice filled with his badly hidden concern, and John hadn’t been able to stifle his laughter. He had laughed, a sharp, unhumorous laugh, raw and hard, an echo of pain audible in his voice. Normal. Right. Nothing would ever be normal again, not for Sherlock, not for him. Sherlock and normal didn’t fit in the same sentence, especially not when the word ‘blind’ was added to the mix.
.” He spat the last word out as if it tasted foul on his tongue.
John leaned closer and laid his lips on the crown of Sherlock's head, breathing in his scent, feeling each one of his exhalations as a warm puff of air against his throat. “I love you, and I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you. I love you,” John whispered the words, placing light kisses on his forehead, brow, nose, and chin.
“I can't see, John,” Sherlock said, a trace of agitation creeping into his otherwise steady voice, “I can't see.”
as love. Two long years of pining for Sherlock, yearning for his touch, his taste, for his lips against his; wanting to feel the smoothness of Sherlock’s skin beneath his body, those long fingers of his tangled in his hair. Two years of blaming him, hating him, loving him, until one night John had had enough, and every emotion, every thought, every memory he had kept secret had broken through the dam, laying bare everything he had tried so hard to hide.
Sherlock took a shuddering breath and opened his eyes again, only to find himself confronted with more darkness. “I still can’t see, John,” he spluttered, his voice breaking on the last syllable. He sounded so weak, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. The relief he had felt earlier had evaporated. It had only been a dream.
I'd love to hear your thoughts, take care xx
Here's a new chapter, I hope you like it :)

He hated the self-conscious thoughts that muscled their way into his consciousness, the obtrusive doubts that crowded his mind whenever Sherlock brushed past him with the same indifference with which he regarded obnoxious people like Philip Anderson and Sally Donovan. He hated that he couldn’t quell the nonsensical questions popping into his head that made him want to slap himself. Even though he was very much aware how thoroughly ridiculous they were, he couldn’t divest himself of them; they kept torturing him, weaving themselves even into his dreams whenever he managed to slip into much-desired unconsciousness.
Sherlock didn't care about the pain in his head, he could tolerate it, he had endured much worse than it. The hammering pain wasn't pleasant—and yes, it hurt. But it didn't hurt as badly as his heart.
A knock on the door pulled him out of his thoughts. The doctor entered the room and walked over to them. “Mr Holmes and Dr Watson,” the man said politely, giving John a little nod, “How are you doing, Mr Holmes?” From the corner of his eye John saw Sherlock's body tense momentarily.
The trembling of his hands told Sherlock that the adrenaline rush was waning, but the tightness in his chest remained, making it hard to breathe. He was feeling weak, both emotionally and physically; his body was trying to betray him. Sherlock swallowed hard, trying to get rid of the lump in his throat, and he bit the inside of his cheek to prevent himself from letting his emotions spill out.
At least something hadn’t changed, John thought, and his eyes grew damp. Blinking quickly, he tried to force back the tears. He just wanted things to go back to normal, back to insults and eye rolls, back to Sherlock being a rude, annoying git.
Okay so this is my first attempt at writing fan fiction ever. I'm open to constructive criticism but, please, don't be too harsh on me! I tend to be very critical of myself and my own work, so it took me quite a while before I found the courage to publish this story. And as you have most certainly noticed, English is not my native language. I'd be more than happy if you could point out any errors in my writing so I can correct them!

“Whatever it is, we'll get through this, Sherlock,” John said, “I promise.”
No, John would never do that, said an anxious voice inside him. Not his John.
“Sherlock? You awake?” John asked, although he knew he was from the shallowness of his breathing and the occasional sigh.
Sherlock didn't have the strength to protest.
He felt pathetic. He
“Thank you.” His voice sounded weak, tired, and he thought that he saw a look of pity on her face as she nodded and walked away, leaving him alone with Sherlock in the dimly lit recovery room.
“He needs you.” His voice was calm, but his eyes betrayed his desperation.
Hello! Thank you so much for all the lovely comments you left on the last chapter, I was so happy to see that so many of you are still here :) Here's a new chapter, from Sherlock's POV this time. It's probably the longest chapter so far haha. I really hope you enjoy it! Hugs, elle_m
He should have known it. He should have known that it wasn't going to last forever. It had all been too perfect, thinking back on it now, and he had acted like an idiot, like a love-struck teenage boy, believing that this time life would be fair, that it was finally his turn to be happy, to be loved.
annoying git.
Faintly stunned by his own reaction, but past the point of caring, John simply unpeeled his fingers from the rail, clenching and unclenching his now-aching fist a few times. The strain of the past days had begun to take its toll, and it had become much more difficult for him to maintain a composed demeanour, no longer able to keep it together like the soldier he was. Now, he more often than not caught himself tensing his shoulders and grinding his teeth, constantly feeling as if he were balancing on a tightrope, precariously teetering on the edge of a breakdown.
It was still dark outside, no light filtering through the curtains, the only sound being the dull thudding of the rain. Had he been at home, in the warmth of 221B Baker Street, perched on the couch with Sherlock’s head resting on his thighs, the familiar rain of England would have felt cosy and safe, but now the chaotic weather only added to his gloomy mood.
