Jo rolls her eyes and makes a throat slicing motion to Dean behind Ellen’s back. “Yep,” Dean says cheerfully. “Jo was actually just telling me about how she was so excited to have the opportunity to learn about bike repair this summer, and now that I’m back I can teach her even more!”
Gabe’s grin takes up his entire face. “Alright, Dean Winchester! That’s my guy! Now, would you be a dear and fetch me a sugar packet for my coffee? It’s a little bit too bitter.”
“I thought I told you to take those off?” he says, fingering the edge of Dean’s waistband. “Or do you want me to do it for you?”
Actually, speaking of, he should probably text Lisa soon and see if she wants to grab a meal or something. They hadn’t ended on good terms, exactly, but he still thinks that they could make it as friends. Lisa was one of the few people who knew about what she called Dean’s “origin story.” Jo just calls it “trauma.” Dean thinks both make good points.
They begin to wander outside in the still-hot Claremont evening, feeling unstoppable with the alcohol coursing through their veins. Dean can’t remember what he ate for dinner, or if he ate dinner, so Jo hands him a party-size bag of Doritos for the journey. She is their intrepid leader, guiding them towards the party and not letting them stop even when Anna and Dean start laughing so hard that they can’t remember why they’re laughing and have to sit down on the hot pavement for a break.
Cas unbuttons his pants so fucking slowly, so slowly that Dean wants to take over for him, and then unzips his fly tooth by agonizing tooth. He crawls back up and covers Dean’s mouth in a bruising kiss while pulling Dean’s hips up into his, just long enough to work Dean’s pants and underwear down to his knees. Dean uses one hand to pull them off the rest of the way and drop them over the side of the bed, and then he and Cas are both naked and it feels like everywhere they touch is searing the shape of Cas into Dean’s skin. Dean feels like he might cum at any second, but he tries to hold on, tries to forget that he’s been fantasizing about this very moment for months.
Castiel arrives two minutes later with a salad in one hand and a small bowl of apple pie in the other. “I remembered that you said it was your favorite,” he says by way of explanation. Dean’s eyes widen.
Of course, the whole thing ended up being irrelevant when he took a bad fall against Chapman and ripped through his ACL. A surgery and several months later, the choice to quit soccer had been made for him and he still had absolutely no regrets. It wasn’t like he was planning to go professional or anything, so all it really did was decrease the stockpile of cash that John’s parents had left for Sam and Dean when they died.
“Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not some farcical French fry ceremony,” Cas says drily, reaching for his water glass.
“You ever think about the fact that being into dudes might not be a bad thing? Maybe crisis isn’t the right word. Maybe it’s just neutral. Or even positive.”
Dean looks at Charlie, feeling helpless. She winks. “Sounds like y’all have a great trip ahead of you,” she says. “Now, would anyone like to come inside with me for a fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie?”
Sam sighs. “Come on, man. You don’t have to tell me anything gross, but it seemed like there was maybe something there that wasn’t just two bros chilling. You were cuddling. I saw.”
Dean winces, not wanting to wander down those well-traveled paths in his mind. He tries to shake himself out of it, but the thoughts keep coming – Mary, hooked up to tubes and machines in the hospital that once employed her. Sam, barely old enough to understand what was happening, watching his mother suffer. And then the funeral and the endless days of grey, grey, grey.
Dean lets out a high pitched panic noise, but then sees Benny smirking. “You jackass,” he mutters, kicking Benny under the table. “I’m trying to have a crisis here.”
They arrive at the diner within a few minutes and Dean still does not feel prepared for the experience. He elects to keep his sunglasses on even as they spot Cas and Jo in a booth by the window and slide into their seats. The diner smells like a familiar mix of coffee, grease, and salt, and Dean’s stomach rumbles in anticipation. He tries not to pick at the old, chipping vinyl of the booth, or get distracted by the intensity of Castiel’s gaze from across the table. He’s glad he picked the spot next to Jo.
Sam has armchair diagnosed him with social anxiety, but Dean still hears his father’s voice in his head whenever he thinks about trying to find a therapist. Therapy is for weak-minded people, John would say, then a note of pride in his voice as he added on, “Not for my boys.” The conversation used to come up often when Dean’s mom was in treatment, as the months stretched into years and the endless hope soured into denial, anger, and finally acceptance.
Dean laughs a little bit too hard and makes weird eye contact with Cas. He doesn’t know when to look away, so he just keeps maintaining until he feels Jo’s elbow in his ribs. “Uh, what?” he asks, wondering what he missed.
Dean nods, smiles, hugs Aaron, wonders what exactly his outlet is going to be now for the rapidly increasing fantasies about dark stubble and cool, dry palms and stripteases starting with a trench coat.
When he arrives, Jo is helping Meg curl her hair while Anna tries on crop tops in front of the mirror. Dean takes a minute to acknowledge how strange it is that this is where he feels most comfortable on campus these days.
Phone in one pocket, ID and room key in the other, he pours himself a plastic Arrowhead water bottle of vodka and cranberry juice and then adds a lime wedge to class it up. He puts the rest of the vodka and juice and some assorted other beverages in a paper Vons bag to bring to Jo’s room so he isn’t showing up empty-handed. Locking his room behind him, he walks as quickly as he can to Jo’s dorm at Scripps, keeping his head down so that he doesn’t have to converse with any other revelers.
“Oh yeah? Which ladies? Last I heard, you were barely holding on to a halfway hookup situation with Lisa Braeden, and that was almost a year ago.”
“Dean, would you grab the hairspray from the bathroom?” Jo asks, concentrating fiercely. “And the comb that’s in there, please.”
“Well, I am uniquely talented. It’s these magic hands that the ladies just can’t stop talking about.”
“—Jess and I are able to communicate better and more clearly because we had an established friendship first. Plus, we’re able to be honest with each other because we had already seen each other through so many experiences by the time we started dating.”
Sam laughs good-naturedly. “Well, I apologize for my brother re-naming you, but glad to have you both here. Can I take a bag?”
He knows that if he stays in his room, he’ll spiral. It’s barely 4:30, but he swings his legs off the bed and changes into an old white bro tank and bright red shorts for the occasion. He glances in the mirror, realizes he looks like Zac Efron in the Baywatch remake, and decides he doesn’t care.
Dean sighs and rolls over far enough to be able to look Cas in those baby blue black holes. “What? I’m trying to fall asleep after getting laid by this extremely hot guy I know.”
Jo groans. “I’m sorry I tried to unscrew all the bolts with my hands. In my defense, I thought I could do it and I know I’m the strongest bike shop employee.”
He turns the knob to a new room with the same Star Wars poster on the wall and mezuzah in the door frame as last year. The lights are off and he doesn’t bother to turn them on, sitting on the bed and toe-ing off his shoes. This is going to be quick, and sloppy, and drunk, and he’s not going to think about it right now, or maybe ever, because if he thinks about it then it’s real and if it’s real then there’s going to be even more thinking and
Sam takes them to a coffee shop in downtown Palo Alto for breakfast, and Dean embarrasses him by mispronouncing all the fancy blends before finally just ordering a black coffee and a muffin. Cas joins in by asking the barista if she can recommend a Starbucks in the area, and Sam lets out a laugh despite himself.
Dean pulls out his phone and hovers over the contact. Trying not to second guess it, he clicks the call icon. The phone only rings once before he hears that familiar Louisiana drawl.
Dean can see people silhouetted in windows and doorways, gathered in small groups and spilling down the driveway. Sam pulls them through the crowd to the kitchen, where Jess introduces them to the host, a redhead by the name of Ed. Dean, not particularly caring about who is hosting beyond knowing what alcohol they have made available, shrugs and takes a shot of some kind of clear liquor from the countertop.
“Cas, you’re my favorite,” he sighs. “My very favorite. Don’t tell Sam.” And, actually, “Or Gabe. Or Jo.”
Jess laughs, easily and loudly. “Well, I don’t know about that. But if you’re anything like Sam here, I’m sure we’ll be great friends.” She pulls on Sam’s arm until they’re sitting on his bed. Dean looks around before plopping himself into Sam’s desk chair.
There is only one person on earth who has the indecency to text like this, and his grin is easily identifiable across the dining hall as he carries a plate piled with pastries to where Dean is sitting in the back corner.
“Who’s next?” he asks boldly, folding an elbow behind his head to show off the six-pack he still has from soccer. “Ladies? Or… Castiel?”
Dean’s not sure how they get back to Sam’s dorm, aside from a few flashes of the inside of a car that smells like tobacco and peppermint. He thinks he lays down at some point to rest his head in Castiel’s lap, but that would mean that his face has been in very close proximity with a very compelling part of Cas’ anatomy and nothing has come of it, so maybe that’s not actually real. Regardless, somehow Cas gets them back to that Spanish-style roof and the arching doorway and Dean is so grateful, so glad that Cas is so smart and responsible and caring.
about it. And so what if he’s seeing Aaron more than usual, and sometimes imagining what Aaron would be like if he had blue eyes and a deep, gravelly voice.
“Of course,” Dean says. “Why don’t you come around to the window and I can have you sign the forms and officially check your bike in.” He opens the filing drawer in the desk and pulls out a standard check-in form, then scribbles “Cas” at the top in blue ink. He hands paper and pen to Cas who frowns and writes “tiel” next to Dean’s scribble before turning to the rest of the form. Oh, okay. Got it.
“I said party and you inferred fundraising event for a Republican senator? No, you’re not wearing that.”
“What I say is, I miss you, man! Stanford got you so busy that you can’t call?” Sam’s semester had started a week before Dean left Kansas to come back to Claremont, which had also been part of the motivation for his volunteering to work freshman orientation at the bike shop. Without Sam around, there really wasn’t much to do in an already boring hometown.
Jo sighs. “Not that it’s either of our business, but Castiel went through a pretty nasty breakup last year. With a guy. Someone else with a weird name too, though I honestly don’t remember it right now. Pomona kid, politics major. From what I’ve heard, he was a nasty piece of work. That was honestly why Cas and I started hanging out – he really didn’t have anyone else. Except Charlie, but I think she was abroad last spring or something.”
Cas’ face, which now has an indiscernible expression on it as he takes in Dean’s gaze. “Dean,” he begins, his face softening, but Dean isn’t ready for that.
He loses track of the girls quickly but spots Gabriel’s light brown hair inside one of the brightly lit dorm rooms. He yells Gabe’s name but it’s too loud, too much going on, Gabe can’t hear him. As he gets closer, he becomes very aware that he is still not drunk enough for this.
“No,” Dean groans, rolling over and pulling his pillow over his head. His mouth tastes like dirty socks and his eyes feel gritty and dry. He puked at some point in the night, just got up and got it over with, so his stomach is okay for the time being but he doesn’t feel like he should depend on that continuing to be true.
“Maybe Dean will invite you on his fall break plans instead. Dean, what are you doing for fall break?” asks Charlie, looking hopeful.
“Dean, I want to dance,” Castiel pleads, tugging on Dean’s pocket. “Dean, can we go dance?” He doesn’t wait for a response before grabbing Dean’s hand and heading towards the source of the music, a giant, booming speaker in the corner of the living room. The lights are off and the room pulses with bodies, packed in so tightly that Dean can barely identify them as individual people.
Dean would like to disappear now, fully, just cease to exist, turn into a ghost and never ever revisit this conversation. He squirms. For a moment, there’s just the sound of Benny quietly sipping his coffee.
“What do you mean?” Cas asks innocently. “This is my best trench coat.” Jess snorts but tries to keep a straight face when Sam catches her eye.
Cas pulls out of Gabe’s grasp and huffs out a sigh. “We are not related by blood, Gabriel. I have reminded you of that many times.”
Dean scoffs. “I think they’re pretty good where they are,” he says, leaning in for another bite of pie. He catches Cas’ eye and sees a flash of something in them as his lips close around the fork.
“Castiel is a Psych major too,” Jo explains, stealing two full handfuls of fries from Gabe’s plate while he’s distracted by the conversation. “And you’re both advised by Jody, and you both like biking and sometimes go to that theology club and attend all of the free film screenings on campus. It’s kind of surprising that you haven’t run into each other before.”
“Hell yeah it is, dude! I forgot that they do pie here. Thank you,” he says, abandoning his burger and digging into the sugary apples. “Best dinner ever.”
“I mean it! And I think it’s an important preface to what I want to ask you.” Jo nudges him. “Which is whether you might potentially like Castiel, in a liking way, romantically.”
“You said the chains came off while you were riding it?” he asks the customer, a gangly girl with glasses who seems like she couldn’t have identified the chains if they bit her on the face.
The wide-eyed gaze wears off well into hour three, when they stop for gas. They manage to keep up a steady conversation about classes, movies, and cars, and Cas doesn’t once violate Dean’s “no complaining about the music” rule. He even surprises Dean with a maximum-volume rendition of Back in Black as they cruise through Gilroy.
He’s at Jo’s for the pregame when Cas arrives with Charlie, of course wearing that damned trench coat with the same white button down and grey slacks from Palo Alto underneath. This time, Dean smiles. Cas looks
They make their way over to where Dean is parked in the student lot. Cas scans the Toyotas in the lot. “Which one is you?” Dean points. Cas’s eyes bug out. “
“Executive decision, it’s one dude with the last name Norms,” Gabriel decrees, lifting a French fry in fake salute.
They’re stumbling up the stairs and down the hall and Dean is having trouble remembering which direction standing is supposed to go, and when he grabs for maybe the floor or maybe the wall he ends up with that cool, dry hand in his hand again and then an arm wraps around him and a nose is in his hair and he hears, whispered, “We have to be quiet,” over and over like a drunken prayer.
“Thanks,” the girl says, looking relieved. “I appreciate it.” Dean slides the forms he needs signed across the window of the bike shop and hands her a pen from the jar that Ellen keeps beneath the desk. The girl quickly scribbles her name and, with a tight smile and a wave, leaves the bike shop behind.
“I mean, it’s definitely been busy,” Sam said. “There’s a ton of orientation stuff, and then I’m also starting the actual content of all my classes and trying to keep up now that syllabus week is over. Plus, I met some cool guys down my hall and we’ve been hanging out a bunch.”
Jo cheers and pours the tequila, again bathing her sheets in it. Cas takes a breath, licks the salt, and holy shit even those two seconds of Cas’ tongue on Dean’s skin send a jolt of electricity through him and he doesn’t even have time to react before Cas is sucking the tequila down and Dean is maybe going to die from this? But damn, what a way to go.
“Man, you can’t wear a trench coat to a house party! You’re going to drink in those clothes? And dance?”
Dean can feel his brother rolling his eyes as he responds. “There are plenty of cute, interesting, smart, fun girls here, Dean. That’s why you’re never allowed to visit. I want to actually be friends with them.”
Finally, they make it to North Quad. Light spills out of all of the rooms on the first floor of Green – its residents are all soccer players, and each room holds a different themed drink. Dean gazes around, feeling soft, feeling warm, remembering that he loves these people, even if he doesn’t like them all the time. He bumps every fist he is presented with, passing out high fives like candy. He feels so good, so fucking good, remembering how fun alcohol is, but also a little bit thirsty and maybe there’s more to drink somewhere?
God, yes, Dean does want that, and he nods and bites his lip and bats his fucking eyelashes so that Cas will get the message. Cas cups his jawline with one hand and presses Dean’s mouth open with his thumb, and then slowly leans back in to suck a hickey into the hollow of Dean’s collarbone.
“Are you doing okay?” Cas asks him, and is that his hand on Dean’s face? Dean leans into the cool, dry, palm, humming happily and feeling a sudden sense of peace.
“It can, sure. But if you have a caring partner it shouldn’t be too bad. The first time is definitely more likely to be painful. But if we do it, I’d make sure to stretch you out properly first so you’d feel as little discomfort as possible.” Cas told him; sincerity clear in his voice. Just the thought of Cas stretching him out had him flushing and his spent cock tried to twitch in response.
"Haven’t even reached the best part." Dean purred, sliding in another finger and crooking them into his prostate.
“Okay…next question.” He continued, rubbing his neck in embarrassment. “Is it messy?” He wrinkled his nose at the thought. That was the thing he was actually most concerned about. He had already figured it could be painful, but he would be mortified if they did it and there was a mess.
“Of course not, Dean.” He scoffed. “I figured you were around that age since you are in college. Your age is not a problem for me” Cas assured before his smile faltered. “Is uh, is my age a problem for you?”
“Okay, this is probably gonna be Hella awkward, just so you’re warned.” He pointed a finger at Cas, making the other man chuckle.
The class had a Halloween Party and they all dressed up; Dean dressed as Han Solo of course. The kids were all adorable in their costumes as well. Bianca was definitely his favorite. She had come in in the most adorable Bumblebee costume, and that’s when he found out the real reason her nickname was Bee. She had proudly informed him that her papa loved bees and that’s why he named her that, before asking him if he liked her costume. He had told her of course he did, and then she proceeded to run around the room trying to sting all of her classmates. It was never a dull moment with these kids.
“Yeah. Um, so I was wondering, and you can absolutely say no.” He rushed to add. “But I was wondering if maybe, um, you could like, help me figure it out?” He asked unsurely. Cas was gaping like a fish at this point, eyes still wide in surprise before he cleared his throat.
have to be here?” Dean whined as they entered Club 608, a gay bar close to where they both lived. The atmosphere was pretty laid back, and you really wouldn’t even know it was a gay bar if it wasn’t for the LQBTQ+ flags lining the walls. There was a long bar on one wall, a small dance floor, and a pool table in the back. It wasn’t too crowded tonight, just enough people that no one would really stand out.
Dean’s hand slips a little bit and suddenly he’s touching Cas’ bare stomach, and he wonders if that’s okay, and he leans in to ask Cas if that’s okay, and that’s when Cas grinds back on him and suddenly his dick is very interested in the conversation. Holy shit is Cas good at this, whatever this is, the writhing and pulsing and general mating rituals of the red-blooded American male. Dean’s hand is still up Cas’ shirt, feeling the rounded muscle under soft skin, while his other hand holds tight to Cas’ hip as if it is the only thing keeping him standing, which who knows, maybe it is.
, comes the instantaneous response. Dean chuckles. Few things are more predictable than his relationship with Sam.
Twenty-five minutes later, Dean is making final decisions about whether to go with a leather jacket or just cuff the sleeves on his green plaid flannel. Cas is still in the shower, drowning his sugary sins in Sam’s unscented Dove bar soap, but Dean can hear Sam nervously shouting a five-minute warning to him through the wall. On the dresser, Dean sees a few bottles of cologne; sniffing one, he deems it acceptable and dabs it around his neck and pits.
Cas joins him, blinking as he takes off his sunglasses. “Does it smell like a place of higher learning to you?” he says to Dean, sniffing the air. “We don’t seem to have this scent back in Claremont.”
Dean takes a whiff. “Nah, I think that’s just a few festering superiority complexes. Sammy!” he yelps, spotting his gigantor brother waving so hard he fears for his shoulder health.
“Never mind. Look, I don’t know, man. He’s funny and interesting and weird as hell, and he’s been making my year a hell of a lot more fun than I was expecting. But I’m a little worried about him like, liking me. Because we have a good thing going with this friendship and I don’t want that to get messed up because he can’t keep it in his pants.”
That works for Dean – he had packed the car last night and didn’t need to go back to his room before they hit the road. He stuffs the rest of the eggs and toast into his mouth as fast as he can and wipes his mouth with a napkin that Cas hands him. “I can take our plates and then we can go?” Cas asks, already standing up to do so. Dean nods.
Afterwards, he feels Cas get up and return with a soft, damp washcloth, cleaning them both up before pulling a blanket up and over them. He burrows into the soft warmth of Cas’ neck and lets Cas hold him like a baby. He’ll never admit it in the light of day, but this is absolutely the best part of the whole night. Cas presses a soft kiss into his forehead and says his name, but he’s so sleepy, doesn’t want to open his eyes.
“Dean, did you hear me?” Sam is looking at him expectantly as they pull into the parking lot. The sun is going down over a cluster of trees in the distance, and Dean knows they are supposed to be heading out soon to a house party at one of Sam’s friends’ places.
“Regardless,” Dean says, grabbing a napkin out of the dispenser and pulling a pen from his backpack, “perhaps a film club of our very own is in order. Jo and I have been trying to make it happen for years because she hasn’t seen anything and I’ve seen everything, but we could never get the soccer guys to buy in.”
Sam’s head appears in Dean’s doorway as if summoned. “Really?” he asks excitedly. “Oh man, I was thinking about a Greenie Genie for the whole flight. Dean, you should really try one again. The flaxseed and spirulina are so good for you.”
As he closes out of his final Google doc for the day, he glances at the computer clock and realizes that he barely has enough time to pick up dinner from the dining hall before movie night is set to start. Suddenly, he feels the nerves tingling in his hands again.
Dean opens his eyes to confirm his suspicions. Indeed, he and Cas are still squeezed into Brady’s twin bed, locked into a tight spooning position. His arm is wrapped around Cas’ waist and tucked under his ribs, and Cas’ legs are tangled in Dean’s. Cas is letting out light snores and Dean briefly has the thought that it’s kind of cute. Like, in the way that you think your best friend is cute because you’re best friends.
“I have recovered,” he declares, pushing himself back up into a seated position. “Thank you for enabling my access to these life-changing nutrients.”
In the course of what feels like the next thirty seconds, Dean learns that Charlie is a Libra rising, a computer science major, first in her class at Mudd, actively being recruited by several government agencies, and planning to go rogue the second she graduates anyway. He wonders why she led with the star sign.
Cas smiles and rubs a thumb gently over his cheek. “Me too. I just… I wanted to tell you something.”
Ellen, now busy doing an inventory of the parts that were delivered the day before, looks over her shoulder at him, unimpressed. “I didn’t say I missed having a kiss-ass in the shop, Dean. Just someone who knows a wrench from his left hand.”
Cas is still fuming as he shrugs off his trench coat and throws it on the bed. “I don’t understand why you treat me like this “ –unzips his pants–“like I am a CHILD” –rips his white button-down out of his waistband, unbuttoning so furiously that Dean fears for the shirt—"when I am a perfectly full-grown and capable adult who can make my own goddamn decisions. You ass… butt.”
They pass the first night playing cards, ordering takeout, and nursing beers for longer than is truly necessary. Dean and Cas have a minor disagreement about sleeping arrangements, but Dean wins by simply lying down on the floor with Sam’s extra blanket and falling asleep before Cas can try to fight him further. He wakes up feeling a million years old with all of his joints creaking and clicking, but still feels a smile spread across this face when he sees Cas’ bleary, blinking morning face looking down at him from Brady’s bed.
“The curtain was Brady’s idea,” Sam says, gesturing. “Obviously it’s not any real privacy, but it does help a little when one of us has, a, uh, you know, like, a, um, girl—”
He plugs his phone in on the nightstand and grabs his laptop from his backpack, then flops down on his bed. As the harsh afternoon light softens into an evening glow, he works through an article analysis for his Psychology of Aging class, a blog post for his Religion and Trauma class, a presentation for the Ghosts and the Machines class that he did ultimately get into, and a long reading on Gaventian power analysis for his Race, Nation, and Baseball class.
Just then, Ellen herself rounds the corner. It’s Dean’s first sighting of his boss since being back on campus – she was out checking mail and getting the campus gossip from her friends in the mailroom when he opened this morning. “Good morning, Dean,” she says in her slight Kansas twang, reaching over to squeeze his forearm. “We’re glad to have you back, and even gladder you were willing to give up your last week of summer for freshman orientation. Jo, you giving an enthusiastic and grateful welcome to my favorite employee who is the only reason you aren’t alone this week?”
Dean blushes and drops his gaze to the grass. “No. Sorry. It was a dumb question. And it’s none of my beeswax. I just – well, we just – we had a moment. Or, he had a moment. In Palo Alto. And it made me wonder. About him.”
Dean scrambles out of the recliner, knocking his empty beer bottle to the ground, and takes three big strides to get to Bobby. “Let me get those, Bobby,” he says, taking the heavily loaded grocery bags out of Bobby’s arms and carrying them to the kitchen. He knows that Bobby isn’t “old” and would never dare to say anything to that effect, but he still has the instinct to give back whenever he can to this man who has become his father.
On second thought, no, God, no, this is not a boy but a man. Dean takes in the ruffled dark hair and piercing blue eyes atop a lanky, muscular runner’s frame. The man is wearing khaki-colored hiking shorts and a t-shirt that reads, “GISHWHES! Join The Hunt!” Somehow, it still doesn’t take away from his quietly powerful energy.
Charlie furrows her brow and looks at Cas expectantly. Her jaw drops and she yelps, “You’ve trained him out of that, too? He never lets me call him Cas!”
Benny leans in and stares at Dean. His eye contact is intense, and though it is not as intense as Cas can be, there is still something similar about the energy of these blue eyes. “Dean, you sucked me off before you ever went down on a girl. We fucked in the back of my pickup before I went to home base with my own actual girlfriend. Who is now my fiancée, by the way, though not that you asked.”
“You might, a little. I have to back out of our fall break plans. Dorothy surprised me with plane tickets to go visit her in Seattle.”
“Took a few wrong turns, but we ended up in the right place. Sam, this is my friend Cas. Or, uh, Castiel?”
As it always does when he experiences more than ten seconds of silence, his mind jumpstarts another panic spiral about Cas. He actually hasn’t been able to stop thinking about him since they arrived back home to Claremont and went their separate ways back to their dorm rooms. Dean has no idea what real Cas did that night, but Fantasy Cas spent a long time with Dean in the shower and then back in his bed, panting and writhing and finishing off his striptease in a hundred different ways.
“Dean?” comes a grumbly, rumbly voice from behind him. He turns. Cas is sitting up, scrubbing at his face, and stretching out his neck.  Against his will, Dean once again thinks,
Maybe this is hell. Just a constant jaunty ringtone from somewhere in the room that won’t stop. Why? Why won’t it stop? Dean remembers reading stories of torture by repetition. This. This is that.
They hang up, agreeing that Dean will text Benny to schedule once he knows more about his plans with Sam and Bobby this week. Dean leans back into the pillows and sighs. He doesn’t know why he put that off for so long, doesn’t know why he hasn’t reached out to Benny for two full years when Benny has never been anything but good to him.
“No silly, we’re taking Cas to Norms. He’s never been, remember? The whole thing about how he loves diners so we couldn’t believe that he hadn’t tried Norms? We talked about it for like ten full minutes, dude. How much did you drink last night? Anyway, you gotta get a move on, buddy. We were supposed to be there twenty minutes ago!”
“Well for the love of God and all things holy, you need to answer your phone faster! I’ve just been sitting in my car waiting for you. Cas and Jo are already there.”
Dean nods because it’s true and they should say it, and truthfully it’s the best idea that anyone has had in a long long while. He lets go of Jo’s hand but holds on tight to Cas.
Sam arrives home like a hurricane, as always. His flight is supposed to get in on Monday evening, since he only had one midterm to take on Monday morning, but it ends up getting delayed and Bobby finally gets him from the airport around 6:00 AM on Tuesday morning. Dean is fast asleep upstairs when he hears the door slam open and the thud of Sam dropping what sounds like six suitcases at once. Then the stomping up the stairs, since Sam is too gigantic to move across the floor quietly, and another dull thud as he falls into his bed. By the time Sam’s done showering, Dean is fully awake and staring at the ceiling.
They muddle their way through a drunken bedtime routine, barely managing a bathroom visit for brushing teeth and squinting in the harsh fluorescent light. Cas finishes first and goes back to the room, leaving Dean to stare at himself in the bathroom mirror. His eyes are red from the alcohol, face flushed, lips swollen, hair a wild mess. For a second, he thinks,
“Last semester I took a class called ‘Pottery and the Art of Love,’” he admits. “Since then, I have not felt that I am in a position to judge.”
Here being snorting his latte out of both nostrils after being caught off-guard by one of Castiel’s more unexpected jokes. The two of them really seem to be getting along, and Dean feels a warm glow in his chest as he watches them laughing together. He hadn’t known that this would mean so much to him, but it really feels like he suddenly has a family again.
But he has to admit, he’s having a lot of fun with the guy. Cas, in an extremely unexpected twist, is one of the funniest people Dean has ever met. What he had initially perceived as some kind of uncomfortable aloofness is actually the driest, sharpest sense of humor he’s ever seen. And they never run out of things to talk about, either. Jo was right that it’s surprising they hadn’t run into each other before on campus - they like all the same movies, have taken a bunch of the same classes at different times, and have all the same favorite spots on campus.
Sam lets out a groan loud enough to be heard through the walls. “Dean, I just got home and I’m tired,” he complains.
It’s not like there isn’t some material to work with there. Aside from Cas, there’s Aaron, and before Aaron was that boy whose name Dean never learned, who dressed like Doctor Sexy from Dean’s secret favorite TV show on Halloween of their freshman year and then tied Dean to his bed and gave him the best blowjob he’d ever had.
“Look who the cat dragged in,” Dean says, smiling. He reaches out a fist and she bumps it. “How was your summer, Harvelle?”
“Sit anywhere,” Cas says, gesturing towards the pillows and poufs. “And would you like a drink? We have Jo’s drinks or any kind of alcoholic seltzer.”
Castiel nods and hands the pen and paper back over to Dean. “That sounds great, Joanna,” he says. Joanna? Is this guy some kind of weird full-name fundamentalist? “I’m ready now if you are.”
Jo nods and looks away, back over to the tiny Chihuahua, which is now performing tricks for its owner to the delight of her friends. For a moment, she’s silent.
Dean whistles. Riding to Mount Baldy is an uphill journey, and even though the sun has only been up for a couple of hours, the temperature is already well on its way to surpassing a hundred degrees. “Well,” he says, “this should be an easy fix. If you sign this form, you can actually leave it here with us and we’ll return it to the gym when we’re done.”
The door bursts open and Dean startles, almost shattering the cologne bottle. “Jesus, Sammy,” he growls. “You don’t come with a warning bell yet?”
“Damn, dude,” Gabriel lets out a low whistle. “Didn’t realize you shared such a resemblance with death incarnate.”
Jo gives him a look. “The two of you are basically joined at the hip these days. Of course he likes you.”
“I would like to take a shower,” says Castiel. Dean glances in the rearview and doesn’t see him. When he turns around, he sees Cas fully lying down in the backseat. “This combination of sugar and caffeine does not particularly agree with me,” Cas sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I’m hopeful that a shower will help.”
It’s mid-morning on Wednesday and Dean is sitting in a vinyl booth, wondering if this table has always felt so exposed. It’s not, really, tucked in a corner behind the bar, but there’s a direct eyeline to the door and out the window to the street. He checks his phone again, but still no new texts. The bell over the door chimes and he jumps, looking up, but it’s a mom with two kids instead of a six-foot Louisianan.
Dean has been back at school for about two weeks, and has only seen Cas once for a rushed movie night. Everyone is stressed with finals and thesis deadlines coming up, so it makes sense, but it makes Dean feel squirmy and stressed that he hasn’t yet been able to say anything to Cas about his Thanksgiving revelation.
“I haven’t seen it,” says Gabe, attempting to wrest the remnants of his fries back out of Jo’s grip. “Any good?”
Dean pulls back and looks at Cas, sees that Cas is smiling back at him with his whole face, adorable crow’s feet and a perfect dimple and all. “I’d say it’s time to go dancing, wouldn’t you?”
Sam fills the silence on the way to the café, telling Dean excitedly about the dates that he and Jess have gone on since Fall Break. Jess continues to sound perfect for him – she loves hiking, camping, reading, dogs, volunteering, and trying new vegetables. Apparently they go to the farmers market every weekend to pick up kale and oranges. Barf.
Dean hangs up with Sam, reminding him once again of the value of a good lay and making him promise to call again soon. As he does so, he notices that he has four new texts waiting.
Oh no, oh no no no, this cannot be possible, cannot be right or real. What? Gabe is somehow related to Jo’s friend? How? How could it have not come up in four years of friendship that Gabe has a brother whom some people might find themselves attracted to in a frankly uncontrollable way?
It’s good to see Sam relaxed and at ease; there had been some years there where Dean wasn’t really sure that he would ever see Sam happy again. Dean’s freshman year, he had driven back to Kansas almost once a month to check on Sam and make sure that he was okay. After losing their mom and then their dad in rapid succession, it seemed only reasonable that the kid might be having a tough time. Luckily, Bobby and the guys in his shop stepped in to make sure that Sam was fed, housed, clothed, and even employed when he wanted to be. Sam, meanwhile, had funneled all of his energy into getting the best grades possible so that he could end up, well, here.
Dean can’t say no, hopeless to resist anything that this man asks of him, squeezes side by side with him in this college dorm extra-long twin (hey-oh! Just like Cas!), wondering if he’s breathing weird or too fast or too slow. How do people even breathe anyway? Should he hold his breath? Match it to Cas’? Both of those seem like extremely weird options and he just doesn’t–
Not to mention that at some point things with Benny became just a little bit too complicated. It was easier to stop talking, easier to cut him out, than to navigate and understand exactly what roles they played in each other’s lives. Benny had met Andrea and Dean had been starting to hook up with Lisa, and every phone call had started to get stiffer with longer silences until one day Dean just stopped answering.
It’s hotter than hell in the tiny bike shop, and Dean would know – he’s been. Well, maybe not to real hell, but certainly to his uncle Bobby’s mechanic shop with no air conditioning on a muggy Kansas day, and that’s close enough. The shack he is in now lacks some of the aromas of Bobby’s old chop shop, namely those of and related to the digestive systems of its staff, but he can still feel the sweat dripping slowly into his socks from the backs of his knees as he squats to check out his newest project.
He shoves his slacks down and suddenly he is standing in his underwear in front of Dean. Who, huh, wouldn’t have expected him to be a boxers guy. His chest heaves with the effort of this dramatic disrobing, and Dean is privately extremely impressed by the muscle tone of the abs that he can see in his peripheral vision as he keeps his gaze trained very intentionally on Cas’ face.
“As long as you’re not irreparably damaging the psyches of my female friends, I’m fine with a little bit of wounding.”
Had to put this at the end this time because of spoilies, but in the real-life situation this chapter is based on, the movie we watched was It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown! And it was our thighs pressing together not shoulders because we were sitting side by side squished together on a bed with all our friends. And an hour after the movie ended, the sophomores next door yelled at us for having fun too loudly because we were singing along to The Monster Mash. :)
Dean has been avoiding this conversation for almost two weeks now, knowing that Gabe was back on campus and wanted him to start partying with the team again. Though Gabe remains one of his best friends, he still just doesn’t feel great about going to parties with a group of people who hadn’t done much to support him through his injury and with whom he has almost nothing in common now. Just because he misses the game doesn’t mean he needs the people.
Castiel lives in a suite, Jo tells Dean, with a few other roommates that she has met once or twice. Apparently they all came in as religious studies majors and realized they lived well together across several doubles in their freshman year, so they’ve been living together ever since. Dean absorbs this information while focusing most of his energy on not slipping all the way back down the stairs of this dorm. He’s relieved when they arrive at a door that features a cloud-shaped piece of construction paper with Castiel’s name on it. He only has to knock twice before the door opens.
Cas steps forward and shakes Sam’s hand. “You can call me either. I have adjusted to the nickname at this point.”
Reflecting on that now, he opens up the student portal to check his class requests for the millionth time this morning, even though it’s barely 10:00 AM and the Pitzer dining hall’s Saturday brunch is looking like a ghost town while the rest of the school sleeps in. He absentmindedly scoops a lukewarm bite of scrambled eggs into his mouth as he scrolls through the class requests he has submitted. He’s trying hard to get into Ghostly Machines, rumored to be the best – or at least strangest – humanities GE on campus. Jo somehow managed to get in last spring and told Dean that her final was a twenty-page paper on summoning the energy of dead spirits. Dean is stoked.
“Just asking if you want to join the brunch plans we just made. Since you seem to be living in outer space.”
The first couple of weeks back on campus pass in a blur of high temperatures, short shorts, and slowly increasing anxiety about the semester ahead. Though it has only been a few days and he hasn’t even been to class yet, Dean is beginning to regret the courses that he picked for his senior fall semester. Surprisingly, it isn’t even his thesis that’s stressing him out, despite being a last minute Psych major (switching from his initial Econ declaration back when he was a freshman). No, mostly he’s worried about how to fill his time this year without soccer.
Dean screamed a hoarse cry, tears running down his cheeks. That was just how he loved it, the fullness and the pushing in when his hole was still too small for it. His hole clenched around Castiel’s wrists and his insides were hot and slid around him.
more than that; it had felt like he was making love to Cas, which was something he had never done before. When he looked into Cas’ eyes, it almost looked as if Cas felt the same. And then Cas had gone and kissed him, making Dean feel like he had died and gone to heaven. He couldn’t remember ever being kissed like that before in his life. He’d felt a tiny glimmer of hope that maybe,
"You have permission to come now Dean" he replied as he continued to fuck Dean hard and fast now. He felt the beginnings of his own orgasm building.
The rest of the pickup went by in a blur, and soon he was walking back to the classroom with Miss Mosely so they could pack up and leave, first day successfully down. He was so lost in thoughts of the other man still, as he packed up his bag, that he didn't hear his name being called, until he felt a firm nudge in his side.
Cas smiled and hugged Dean tighter. "Good, I'm glad." He said. "So, what's the oldest man you've been with then?" He asked curiously.
“Fu-fuck! Cas! Geez!” Dean croaked; the breath punched out of him from the force of the thrust. Cas didn’t hold back, or give anytime for the Hunter to adjust. He pulled back and fucked into Dean hard and fast, making the other man whimper in pain and pleasure.
"Hey, Cas." Dean smiled, leaning up and tilting Castiel’s head down so he could kiss him sweetly. He hadn't budged the two hours they'd slept.
“Y-yeah, fuck…I want it Cas. Put it in me.” He pleaded as he pushed his ass back, trying to get it inside him. He felt Cas lean over into the nightstand, before he straightened back up behind Dean. He could hear a cap flip open and then a wet finger rub against his rim. He held his breath as Cas pressed on his hole, and then it was pressing inside, having breached the tight muscle. It burned a little as Cas sunk in, but he licked around his finger, soothing the bit of pain. Dean felt Cas wiggling his finger around, and then there was a jolt of intense pleasure as he hit something inside him.
Cas sat down and began eating the lovely breakfast his boy prepared. He was very happy. "Thank you, Dean. And I'm sorry if I upset you this morning love."
“Yes, I did. You have nowhere to go. I suggest you comply with my orders and let me read you your rights.” Officer Novak stated stoically. Stern face a mask, not showing how frustrated he was with this criminal.
Once she gave birth to their daughter, Meg signed over her parental rights to Castiel and then disappeared from their lives, leaving him to raise a newborn alone. He didn’t even have any help from his parents because once they found out that, not only was he gay, he had a child out of wedlock as well, they disowned him completely. If it wasn’t for his older brother Gabriel, who took him in and helped him those first few years, he didn’t know what he would have done. He had only just graduated college a few months before she was born and he had yet to find a job in his field at the time. He would have been homeless on the streets if it wasn’t for Gabriel. Gabriel could be a total pain in the ass, but he came through when he needed him most and was there for him when no-one else was. Now, 8 years later, Castiel was 30, had a successful career as a computer programmer, owned his own home, and had an exceptional daughter that he would do anything for. Gabriel was still in their lives as a doting uncle and lived close enough that they saw him at least once a week. It was still a struggle being a single father, but Castiel was in a fairly good place in his life now. The only thing missing was a partner to share it with. But that was not a priority now, his daughter was.
“Yes, I turned 30 back in December. And you’re how old? I’m assuming at least 21 since they IDed you for that margarita you are drinking” Cas questioned in response.
“I can’t believe my baby is graduating.” Mary said beside him, tears in her eyes as she watched her son on the field.
“Fuck, that feels good.” Cas said as his cock slid against the soft material encasing his best friend’s cock.
“Yeah, um…yeah Cas. I uh, I’m in love with you.” He shrugged before he rushed on “And I get it if you don’t feel the same, I do. We can just pretend like this whole conversation didn’t- “He was cut off as Cas’ lips came crashing into his. He froze in shock for a second before he finally sank into the kiss. There were no fireworks or anything cheesy like that, but to Dean it was still the best kiss of his entire life. They finally had to come up for air and Cas pulled back and rested his forehead against Dean’s.
"Fuck" Cas said as he drove his patrol car towards Clerk’s. He had hoped it would be a slow day. He hated shoplifting calls. There was always just so much paperwork involved for, normally, a small dollar item. Cas pulled up to the shop and outside, Dean was sitting on a fence surrounding the shop, grinning hugely and waving as Cas drove up.
"No, Cas. " Dean cupped his jaw in his hands and kissed his lips. "You've done nothing but bring me happiness.”
“What can I say? I’m a cuddle slut.” Dean shrugged with the shoulder Cas wasn’t laying on. “Fuck that was good.”
“Thank you.” He muttered before clearing his throat. “Okay class, we are going to start our lesson on Shakespeare. Please open your books to the first page and we will begin.” He instructed before he grabbed his mug of coffee. He took his first sip and immediately spit it out all over his desk. What should have tasted like sweet ambrosia, tasted like coffee flavored salt water instead. The class all laughed again at his expense and Cas had to bite back the list of profanities that ran through his head. The day had to get better from there, right?
“You want me to suck your cock?” Cas replied wickedly as he licked the shell of the younger man’s ear, making Dean whimper. He nodded in response, too lost in pleasure for words.
“Oh, well I can see then why me walking you to the door and kissing you goodnight might not be a good idea then.”
“Oh, Sweetheart. I love you too.” Cas said as he leaned down and kissed Dean gently before pulling back to gaze into his eyes. Dean felt raw and flayed open. He loved this man so much, and knowing he was loved in return had a tear breaking free to roll slowly down his cheek.
“It’s weird to see you not at school Mr.-I mean- Dean.” She told him bluntly, pulling another chuckle out of the younger man.
“So, um…it’s about the other night, ya know, when we…” He made a vague jerking off motion with his hand as his face began to blush.
The older man slowly worked his cock in and out of Dean, his thrusts gentle at first, then gradually picking up as Dean begged for more. Dean’s cock was leaking profusely. He screamed when Cas angled just right and struck his prostate, hitting it over and over as Dean babbled incoherently. He held on tight as his ass was fucked, and soon he felt his balls begin to draw up, his orgasm right there.
"Oh, fuck yes please." Dean gasped, hole fluttering under his gaze and propping himself up a little to see Castiel’s face.
Fuck. Dean was Castiel's perfect sub. He seemed to take to it like he was meant for him. If only Dean had approached him sooner, they could have been doing much more. Castiel got ready in a tight pair of black jeans that he knew showed off his ass. And he threw on his AC/DC shirt that he knew made his biceps and pecks look huge. He grabbed his wallet and keys and left the house. He drove to the roadhouse, hoping Dean was honest and would meet him there. The waitress showed him to a booth in the back where he waited for his date.
"Um...I was wondering..." Cas started before he chickened out and left to room and went to his bedroom. For a Dom, he could really be a chicken shit and he knew it.
September and October flew by before Dean knew it, and suddenly it was Halloween already. He had finally gotten into the swing of things in the classroom, and he fell in love with most of his students-
The remaining guests all whooped and cheered, making Cas blush but smile fondly. He couldn’t wait for the next Chapter of their story together.
“And what a present it is.” Cas growled before he reached out to stroke the firm globes of his ass. He threw the bow to the side before climbing up on the bed straddle Dean’s thighs. He leaned down to cover Dean’s naked body with his own before whispering in his ear. “I can’t wait to be inside you.”
“I’m gonna cum” Cas gasped as the vibe sunk deep. His balls pulled up tight and he released thick ropes of cum all over his chest and belly.
The rest of the night was spent laying together on Cas couch watching Star Wars, both of their favorite movies. When Cas walked him out and kissed him goodbye, he was suddenly very anxious for the week to pass and Sunday to come.
“G-good. My ass hurts a little, but uh…not too bad. That was amazing Cas.” He whispered, still in awe that he just experienced all of that with someone who loved him and who he loved in return. His throat was tight with emotion and he clung tighter to Cas, never wanting to let go. “I love you.” He whispered again.
, when he finally does, Cas acted like a bumbling teenager with a crush, instead of the thirty-year-old man that he was. And now he would have to see the young man every day at pickup.
Dean bought things for dinner, trying to think of what Cas would like and deciding to make pork chops and greens. He ended up reaching the house a little late because of that. "Cas? You home?" He knocked on the door.
"You will be the death of me Dean" Cas laughed as he swatted Dean's hand away from his cock. "I would love to fuck you again, but, unlike you, there is no way I could get it up again this fast."
"Before we just jumped into sex, we should have had a serious conversation about boundaries, limits, and expectations. That was irresponsible on my part and for that I apologize." Cas replied.
He hadn’t been completely truthful though to his best friend. It had been no accident that made him click on that video. He had clicked it, knowing full well it was a gay video, considering he had purposely been browsing through the gay part of that site. Cas might know almost everything there was to know about Dean, but there was one thing he didn’t know. He couldn’t, considering Dean had only started really coming to terms with it himself, hence why he had been on that part of the site to begin with. Dean was pretty sure he wasn’t as straight as he always thought he was. In fact, he was almost positive he was bisexual. If he was being honest with himself, he had known this for about a decade, but he always just pushed those thoughts to the side, never really looking to close at them. Sure, he could appreciate a hot guy, but couldn’t everyone? Just because he could acknowledge when another man was good looking didn’t mean he was attracted to men, right? Yeah, he couldn’t even fool himself anymore. Especially not after a certain incident about a month ago.
He pocketed his phone and turned his key in the ignition, before pulling out of the spot and making the 15-minute drive to the restaurant. It was a bit of a run-down, family style place that served burgers and similar type of food, and had a bar in the corner. It had always been one of his favorite places to eat, especially since the owner Ellen was a long-time friend of his mom's. He pulled into the parking lot and shut off the car before making his way inside. He waved hello to the bartender as he made his way to the booth in the back corner- his regular spot.  He’d been coming there so long, that he never had to wait to be seated, he was basically family anyway.
Fuck it. He would just have to push through and get it over with. No sense wasting time worrying. He just needed to rip off the band aid. He gave himself a quick last-minute pep talk and made his way down the stairs and into the Livingroom where his parents were seated, watching the news. He stood in the entranceway, taking a few deep breaths to psych himself up, before his mom looked up and noticed him standing there.
Charlie caught up to him, and grabbed his arm to stop him from walking away. “Sorry, I won’t tease you anymore tonight.” The teasing tone was gone from her voice now.  “I’m just excited for you. You’ve been miserable for two months over that man. You thought he was straight and that you’d never see him again and
Dean moaned as he felt Cas start to harden. "You want me? All I do is mouth off. Maybe you should shut me up." Dean gave him a huge smirk, running his tongue over his lip.
" Nothing is wrong love. Just eat your breakfast my dear." Cas said as he got up and walked back into his bedroom. Dean frowned but shrugged and kept eating, smiling happily at the taste. Cas had really outdone himself.
“Hey Cas!” Charlie beamed at him where she was manning the booth, just like she had been that time two years ago. “You ready for this?”
didn’t know. Charlie’s did though. She had come out to them in high school and luckily, they had been supportive. Dean was happy it had gone well for her. He still wasn’t so sure how it would go for himself, and he knew time was drawing nearer for him to come out to his parents. He didn’t want to be one of those middle-aged men who were still in the closet. Maybe once he had a boyfriend- an actual
Cas got out of his cruiser, “What the fuck are you doing here? I told you to stop this Dean." He scoffed.
‘’ Sorry Papa, I forgot.” She smiled sweetly. Castiel knew it was her ‘get out of trouble smile’ that she somehow perfected. He rolled his eyes, but his lips twitched into a smile. He had a hard time ever staying upset with her. He could only imagine how she would eventually exploit that in her teenage years.
He sighed as he rubbed the tension out of the bridge of his nose, before sending the images of the website to his client. Hopefully they would accept them and then he could finish the few details he had left before making the site go live. Then he could move on to the next client. At least that one would be more exciting and hopefully hold his attention better. It was a site for a local Honeybee farm after all, and it was something that greatly interested him.
Dean held his hands out, with a shit eating grin on his face. “You gonna arrest me officer? Its procedure, right?”
?” He heard a familiar voice behind him, causing him to turn and stare into the face of the man he thought he’d never see again.
“I-I honestly don’t know Charlie.” He said truthfully as his shoulders slumped in defeat. “The date was going really well as far as I knew, but…he uh, he just jumped up out of nowhere and fled. I tried calling him. I left, heh, I left at least a dozen messages but he hasn’t called me back.” He explained.
“Dude you don’t gotta freshen up for me. Didn’t you just shower earlier?” Dean asked confused. Cas chuckled fondly at him before smirking.
“So, when’s the boy toy getting here?” Gabe prodded as he popped a lollipop into his mouth. Cas was shocked the man had any teeth left, considering the amount of sugar he consumed on a regular basis.
"Good boy" Cas said as he ran his fingers through Dean's hair before he tightened his grip and pulled Dean's head back. "But I never told you to start. Are you supposed to do things without me permission?"
Dean arched an eyebrow, "Congratulations, you can read a calendar. Seriously, what are you trying to say?" Dean was beginning to smile a little as castiel blushed.
“We were fooling around and she dared me to try on her panties. And I kinda liked ‘em. So, before I left the next morning to do the walk of shame, I stole ‘em.” Dean finished with a shrug as he took another sip from the bottle of whiskey he was drinking.
“So…. what do ya think?” Dean asked with a smirk once he was in front of Cas, though years of being his friend meant Cas could hear the uncertainty in his question.
"Good then. I get to be your first." Castiel said as he leaned back down and started licking Dean. Little kitten licks to start with. Just letting Dean get used to it. Once he felt him relax a little more, he started gently probing his tongue into Dean's entrance. In and out until he felt the muscles loosen. Then he really started tongue fucking him.
Cas eventually calmed his daughter down from her happy dance and explained to her that just because they were boyfriends, that doesn’t mean they were getting married. That had been slightly awkward as Cas stuttered his way through, but she seemed to take it well, before she ran back over to the swings to play again.
Cas had been getting suspicious of how Dean had been acting lately, and he knew it was only a matter of time till the secret spilled out anyway. It was just so hard to be around Cas and not be with him the way he really wanted. Movie nights used to be Dean’s favorite, but now it was like torture to sit so close to Cas and not be able to cuddle in close, or put an arm around the other man. Even driving here to the party, he had wished he could reach across the bench seat in his car and hold Cas’ hand in his. God, Dean couldn’t even count all of the times they stood close to one another and he had fantasized about leaning in and kissing Cas.
Cas was quiet for a minute. He was contemplating whether he should tell Dean how he felt. He figured he should go for it. He turned towards Dean and grabbed his hand.
Cas sat in the stands with Bee beside him, as they watched the students being called up by name, one-by-one. It was August, and Dean was finally graduating. He had ended up having to take a last-minute summer class so he was graduating at a later ceremony than originally planned. He also had a job lined up at an elementary school in their town. Not the one Bianca went to- they had offered him a job too- but he had decided that he didn’t want to work in a place that his boyfriend’s daughter attended. He had figured it could be awkward dating a dad of one of his students. Cas had laughed when Dean had told him it had been bad enough when he was just crushing on a dad of one of his students, and then he slapped Cas playfully when he reminded him of the DILF conversation from their first date.
Dean laughed. "No, I've got to work this afternoon too. Gotta help Uncle Bobby pay the bills." He nuzzled Castiel’s chest, too comfortable to move immediately.
“I guess I’m outnumbered here.” He grumbled as his daughter yelled for Alexa to play Taylor Swift. He turned to look at Dean. “You were supposed to be on my side.” He whined.
“You really need to talk to Cas. Give him a couple of days, since he asked for some space. But then you should really tell him how you feel Dean.” Sam urged.
Castiel was very pleased at how sensitive Dean was. But he continued down his body towards Dean's cock. And once he reached it, he swallowed his cock like an expert.
Dean blinked at him, eyes glazed over and tears spilled down his cheeks, drool smeared on his chin and chest and the floor. "Yes, master. Couldn’t help it." He was cheeky even when he had basically no voice, hoarse.
grown to accept Cas and they had a decent relationship now. It helped that Bee had him wrapped around her little finger. She’d just bat her eyelashes and get anything she wanted from the man. Cas was pretty sure he even saw a tear in the man’s eye that time she had slipped and called him grandpa. Everyone had frozen in shock at first, not knowing how to react, but then John had pulled her onto his lap and told her he would always be a grandpa to her, no matter what happened. That was the day Cas had truly felt like he had found a family of his own. He finally had people besides Gabe who had his back and who loved his daughter like their own.
"What do you mean? No-one has ever complimented or praised you in your life before?" Cas asked sadly.
“Sorry Papa!” She apologized before turning her former teacher. “Hi Mr. Winchester!” She greeted excitedly.
"Mmm, that they are. And you look sexy as hell in them too." Cas said as he leaned in close to Dean's ear." I would love nothing more than to bend you over this counter and fuck you while you are wearing them." He said as he nibbled on Dean's ear. He felt Dean shiver "However, that will have to wait till after dinner" he said as he backed off and went to flip the burgers.
“Guess you’ll have to buy me a new pair.” He teased, and Cas smiled as he looked up at him. He didn’t know how long they stared into each other’s eyes, but he felt something pass between them, something big, and his heart clenched in response. Dean leaned forward again, and Cas knew what was about to happen and he almost let it, but at the last second, he turned his head once more, receiving a kiss on his cheek, that he knew Dean meant for his lips. “Shit. I forgot again. I swear I’ll try to remember next time Cas.” Dean apologized.
"Yes Dean. Why don't you tell your brother how we met?" No way was Cas going to be the one to tell this. That would be totally up to Dean to share.
“Heya Cas.” The other man greeted, hand behind his back as he kicked a loose thread on his carpet. He looked contrite and Cas wasn’t sure why. Dean didn’t do anything wrong.
thorough shower, here he was, naked, face down and ass up in Cas’ bed while Cas kneeled behind him. His boyfriend (
“This is our first time at a big family dinner. We want to make sure we get invited back. Right Papa?” She turned to her father, and Cas’ heart broke, knowing that his daughter even realized just how important this was to him.
Cas hurried at his job so he could take his boyfriend out. He made reservations at a nice restaurant. Dean was waiting for him and opened the door for him when he got there, smiling. "Let's go now." Cas stated.
.” A young boy said, trying to mimic Darth Vader’s deep, heavy mechanical breathing. Cas just scoffed to himself.
an assbutt. Cas had apologized profusely, scolding his daughter who just said “But Daddy! You call Uncle Gabe that all the time!” Cas had again blushed as he dragged his daughter out of the school again, muttering to himself as he went.
"OK Winchester, I'm going to uncuff you and let you go and pretend thus arrest never happened. And I'll give you my number. But I don't want you to feel obligated to do anything. That wouldn't be fair, given that I have authority over you right now. So I want you to go home and really think about what you want. And whatever that is, I will not hold it against you. But please, for the love of God, promise me you will stop committing stupid crimes." Novak begged. He really hoped Dean would message or call him once he got home. But he didn't want to hope too bad in case he was disappointed. So he unlocked Dean's cuffs and let him go. And then he drove off, hoping against hope that he would hear from him.
Dean sat in the passenger seat of Cas’ car as Cas drove them back to his house. The anticipation of what they had planned was growing as they got closer to their destination. He had put it out of his mind during dinner; too focused on making sure everything went smoothly between his parents and his boyfriend. But now that he had nothing to distract his thoughts, he was a mess of emotions inside. He was definitely excited, thinking about going all the way with Cas; The thought of the older man pushing inside him for the first time had him chubbing up a bit inside of his jeans. He couldn’t deny that he was nervous though. He knew there was going to be some pain, but he trusted Cas to take care of him.
Dean smiled. He really wanted to laugh at how adorable Cas could be, even as a full grown adult. But he held it back as he reached out to rest his hands on top of Castiel’s. "Of course, I will."
Castiel reached over and ran his hands along Dean's ass. Just gently stroking both cheeks. Then he spread his ass and leaned down and lightly licked over his furled hole.
“Is this what you were looking for?” He questioned as he held out the bag. Gabe looked up from where he was crawling around on the floor; his eyes narrowed.
A month ago, his life had been much different. He had been living in New York City, in a penthouse suite with his fiancé, planning a wedding with the man he thought he was going to spend the rest of his life with. Instead, he had come home one afternoon last month, wanting to surprise Bartholomew for lunch, and found him in bed with another man. He remembered just standing there, frozen in shock, as he watched the love of his life, fucking some young twink right in their bed. Bart didn’t even have the decency to look ashamed when he caught Castiel standing there. He never even apologized either. He acted as if Cas was the crazy one for being upset because, and as he had put it, “It’s just sex Castiel. Don’t make a big deal out of it.”
Cas hurried to the bathroom and ran the water. He added some oil and bath salts. He quickly went back to the bedroom and picked Dean up bridal style and carried him to the bathroom where he gently set him down in the water and then climbed in and settled behind him, pulling Dean's back against his chest.
“I thought you looked familiar.” He said politely. “I’m Castiel. I’m sorry I don’t remember your name though.” He continued apologetically.
“Oh, just a part for Baby. She needs a new muffler and I’ve been trying to find one on eBay. It’s a bitch to find parts for her sometimes, but I just found someone selling it. Just hoping no one out bids me in the next three days before the auction ends. Send me some good vibes Cas.”
, Cas felt the same. But then Cas had gone and pushed him away, saying he was done and needed space. Maybe he had realized Dean was catching feelings and felt like they needed to stop because he didn’t feel that way.
“Blowjobs.” He blurted out simply, in his usual classless way. He watched as his roommate choked on air before turning to Dean with his classic bitch-face on; the one he used when he was annoyed at Dean for something.
Dean and Sam made their way back to the booth soon after. Castiel was happy when the food arrived so he had something to focus on. He was still nervous being around Dean's family, although luckily, they seemed ok with him. He was totally embarrassed that he got so emotional in front of Bobby. But all seemed alright. And he was still contemplating Bobby's comment about Dean with women because Dean made it clear to him, he was gay. Dean nudged him with a knee and smiled softly. He was happy about how well this was going. Dean seemed to be ok with how everything was going too, so Castiel tried to relax. Dean rested a hand on his thigh when he was done eating, laughing at a joke from Sam and Bobby, chuckling a little.
Dean gasped, whimpering at just the touch and the surprise of the tongue. "What are you doing? Fuck..." he pushed back into that wonderful feeling.
“Sorry, I uh, I forgot I need to…get home early tonight. I-I…uh, I gotta go.” Dean stammered out, a fierce blush blooming on his freckled cheeks. Before Cas could wrap his head around what was happening, Dean had rushed out the front door, leaving Cas confused and momentarily stunned. When his brain finally got with the program, he jumped to his feet and ran out the front door just in time to see the gorgeous black muscle car fleeing down his street. He pulled out his phone and tried to call Dean, but it went right to voicemail.
“Hey Handmaiden!” Charlie greeted him cheerfully, as she plopped herself down across from him in the booth. He rolled his eyes at the greeting; annoyed she was still calling him that stupid nickname. One time-
"I could always steal a jar of jam to get your time." Dean chuckled against Castiel’s skin. "You could fuck me against your patrol car as punishment.”
“What do you want Dean? Tell me.” Cas said before capturing his lips in another kiss. Dean’s head was spinning as he was kissed to breathlessness before the other man pulled back.
“Of course, Love, let’s go.” Castiel replied. He thanked Charlie and began to walk towards the Ferris wheel. He turned his head, trying to get one last glimpse of the young man, Dean. He found him staring back. They locked eyes and Castiel felt like something profound seemed to pass in their gaze. He shook himself out of that as he chastised himself for such a silly thought. It was probably just because it had been years since he had more than just his right hand keeping him company. That had to be all it was. He tried to put the whole encounter out of his head as he followed his daughter through the carnival for the rest of the day. It wasn’t like he would even see Dean again.
“Don’t even try to pretend like you are angry with me, Winchester.” She scoffed. “You should be thanking me. I did what you didn’t have the vagina to. Now you have a date with Mr. Dreamboat.” Her voice was smug, and he wanted to argue, just on principle, but he knew she had a point. He felt the fight leave his body as his hand fell down from where it was tugging at his-now fucked up-hair.
“Please just leave.” He choked out; his throat tight with emotion. He felt the panic clawing its way through his body.
After another hour of torture, Cas had finally had enough. They were on deserted two-lane highway, when Cas say he chance. There was a gravel back road coming up and it would be perfect for what he needed.
Castiel walked into the room after his initial surprise. Dean looked breathtaking in his pink satin panties. He was not expecting that at all. He walked around to face Dean and tipped his chin up to look him in the eyes.
“I can imagine.” He smiled. “I’ll be right back with a shirt.” He stood up and went to his bedroom and quickly changed out of the cum stained shirt, making sure to grab another one of his smaller ones for Dean. When he went back out to the living room, the other man had already taken his shirt off and Cas stopped in his tracks as he took in the trim body in front of him. When Dean looked up at his return, he quickly shook himself out of his ogling and threw him the shirt which he was quick to put on.
“Good morning Class. My name is Mr. Novak and I will be your English Teacher for the rest of this year. Before we begin, do you have any questions for me?” He addressed the class as a whole once the first bell rang to signal the start of class. A student in the back raised their hand and he called on them.
Once they arrived, he led his daughter to the entrance where they waited in line and paid their entrance fee, which was really just a $20 donation to the early child education program. He was happy to pay the donation because he fully supported anyone who wanted to educate the youth. They were given wrist bands to enter once he paid and Bianca was jumping up and down excited the entire time. She had a huge smile on her face before they even reached the first activity. Castiel was again glad that he could put that smile on her face. He always worried that he couldn’t be enough for her as a single father. So, times like this definitely made him feel like a good father. It was days like this that made all of the struggles as a single parent worth it.
“Y-yeah? You like ‘em?” Dean asked hesitantly, voice low with clear arousal. Cas pulled the other man’s hips down, grinding his hard cock up against him.
“I bet.” She said as she sipped her drink, before looking up at him with a glint of mischief in her eyes. Uh-oh. Dean did not like that look. “Soooo… run into anyone interesting today?” She asked, her innocent look clearly fake. “Maybe someone handsome, who's tall, dark-haired, with bright blue eyes perhaps?”
“Hello Dean.” He greeted once he reached his best friend. Dean looked startled, most likely not having heard Cas come in.
Cas would have maybe overlooked his sub's indiscretion. But of course, he had to be bratty about it. "You do realize I will have to punish you know boy, right?" He asked.
He took his jacket off to hang on the hook beside the door, and as he turned around, Cas was on him, pushing his back against the door and taking Dean by surprise. He captured the younger man’s lips in a kiss much more heated than before. His lips made their way up Dean’s chin and neck till he captured the lobe of his ear between his teeth.
“Fuck, Cas…” Dean moaned, and Cas could feel his friend’s cock harden against his own, which was digging painfully into his zipper. He reached down to undo his pants and pull his hard cock out, lining it up with Dean’s panty clad length. When he grinded them together again, they both let out twin moans.
“Roll over for me Dean. I want to see your face to make sure I’m not hurting you.” Cas said softly, and Dean rolled over to look up at the man. “Spread your legs for me sweetheart.”
“Yeah of course Dean. You’re still my big brother. Your sexuality doesn’t change that.” Sam was quick to assure him.
Cas just laughed. He knew he was going to have his hands full with Dean. And he looked forward to it. They pulled into the Diner parking lot and went inside and got a table.
"If I've ever been with a dom. Are you not happy with me?" Dean looked up at him with big green eyes.
“I’m sure she did. Does she um…does she go to J.F.K. elementary down the road?” She asked curiously.
“How do you feel?” Cas asked, a touch of concern in his voice. Dean wiggled his hips a little and winced.
"Dear lord, please promise me you will not actually do that. Please don’t try to give me any more headaches you little brat." He groaned.
Dean was whimpering and whining, thrashing under Cas and crying out with each shove in, stretching him and hitting his most sensitive spot.
“Fuck, Charlie…Ouch! Geez! What the hell was that for?” He complained, as he rubbed the sore spot on his arm where his best friend had punched him. She may be tiny, but
“oh yes. Come in please. I’m Cas.” The man opened the door and Dean followed him inside, secretly freaking out about the whole exchange. He followed Cas into what appeared to be a living room and sat where he pointed into a seat on the loveseat.
It hadn’t lasted long but it had been perfect. They had a long talk once they got back to the bunker, and by the time they went to sleep that night, Cas had moved into Dean’s room and they were officially together.
"Dean, a Dom/Sub relationship is about give and take. And it’s about trust. You trust me to take care of you and in turn, I trust you to be truthful to me about what you need and what your limits are. I’m not here to just take pleasure from you. I want to give you pleasure too. I don't want to just use you. I also expect you to try to behave like a good boy. If you do you will be rewarded. However, I know you are a little brat so I expect punishment to come into play frequently. " Cas explained.
He had probably just fucked up their friendship beyond repair now though. All because he hadn’t been able to separate his feelings from sex with Dean. God he was so stupid and pathetic. And of course, he had to go and do all of this during a damn pandemic where neither of them could leave the house. It was going to be absolute torture to see Dean every day now and not touch him anymore; not to mention how awkward it was going to be now that they had had sex and Cas had freaked out so bad. But he was being truthful, this had to stop. He couldn’t continue this whole experimenting thing with Dean. It already hurt too bad, and it would only get worse if they kept going. He just had to hope that they would be able to go back to the way things were before this all had started. He really couldn’t bare the thought of losing Dean as a friend.
“Fuck, Cas. I don’t know what’s gotten into you but I am so on-board right now.” Dean replied breathily where he was pinned down.
Dean leaned close again, his mouth right next to Castiel’s ear, “You really do have a nice ass, Officer Novak: He flicked his tongue through the grate, just managing to graze Castiel’s ear.
Cas eagerly kissed Dean back. He felt happy for once in his life. He definitely hadn't expected this bratty little twink he had been pursuing as a cop to suddenly carve his way into his heart.
"Oh. Um ok. That's good." Cas felt dumb again. He knew he loved Dean but he wasn't sure if he should say it now. He wasn't sure if Dean was saying he loved him or not. Or just loved what he did.
“First of all, I have no idea who Miss Mosely is, but Mr. Dreamboat stopped in the store before he headed to school to pick up his daughter. I figured you’d probably see him at pick up.” she smirked “I bet you were swooning when you saw him.” She batted her eyelashes obnoxiously, before laughing to herself.
"I need to be at the precinct at 7am." Cas replied. "So, I really need to be going now love." He frowned. He really didn’t want to have to say goodnight so soon. But he knew it was for the best.
He was rewarded with a gummy smile from the other man. “That makes me feel a lot better.” Cas sighed in relief just as the waiter delivered their meals.
, could ever change that. Do you hear me?” The tears that had been welling in his eyes began to slowly fall down his cheeks at those words. He threw his arms around his dad’s neck and let loose the sob that he could no longer hold back. He felt his mom sit down on his other side and join the hug.
“Yeah.” Cas agreed, as he attempted to catch his breath. Hot was an understatement. He didn’t know how he was going to make it through anymore of this without wanting more than Dean was offering though. He knew it was just sexual for his friend. Dean would never want him the way Cas hoped he would.
"Well I'm used to waking up early. A cop's day starts pretty early. I do have to be into work by 8 this morning love." Cas smiled.
“I think you’re ready for my cock now.” Cas’ voice was deep and gravely, and Dean could hear the arousal of the other man clear as day. He heard the sound of the lube being rubbed over the man’s cock before he felt the blunt tip of it press against his hole. “Look at me sweetheart.”
They both remained still, breathing heavily as they tried to catch their breaths, before Cas pulled his softening cock out, making Dean hiss in discomfort. Cas reached out to send a twirl of Grace through the hunter, alleviating some of the pain he had caused. Only a bi though, because he knew Dean would want to feel most of it for the next few days.
“Hello Dean. Please come in.” Cas smiled as he stepped aside and held the door open for the other man. Dean came inside and Cas shut the door behind him.
Cas came out of the bathroom and climbed into bed next to Dean. "What movie are we watching Love?" He asked.
Dean tucked the address in his pocket and after a shower and a quick internet search he showed up at Castiel’s house around nine, relieved to see the address was a real place as he rang the doorbell.
“Hello Dean.” He greeted. “I’d like you to meet my older brother, Gabriel. Gabriel, this is Dean.” He introduced the two men as they sat down at the table.
Cas let Bianca drag him around the Children’s Carnival, just like he had every year before, and he felt a strong sense of Déjà vu. Two years ago, he had been in this same spot, and he had no idea that day would change his life. He had no idea that he would end up meeting the love of his life that day, right at this very Carnival. He smiled as his daughter dragged him to yet another ride she wanted to go on.
He was sure he had a dopey smile on his face when they slowly pulled apart. He felt his chest constrict as they stared into each other’s eyes, something profound passing between them. He felt the need to say something, anything to lighten the heaviness of the moment.
Cas turned him around and pulled Dean against him, Dean's back to his chest. "Well the height difference does make you fit perfectly against me"
!  Cas; the man Dean had pined over for 7 months now, ever since July and that Carnival. He was going on a date with the man of his dreams-
“I’m in love with you! I’m in love with you and I’ve been in love with you for years and so I’ve been avoiding you because I didn’t know how to say it and I didn’t want to lose you and I just wanted to do this privately.” He babbled, unable to stop himself once he started. He was panting by the time he finished his tirade. Cas just stared at him, wide eyed before clearing his throat.
"Fuck yes. I'm your slut, your whore to use and abuse." Dean whimpered, fingers digging into the sheets.
It could have been minutes, or hours later, when Cas finally pulled out and flopped onto his back, pulling Dean to cuddle on top of his chest as he wrapped his arms around the younger man. He kissed Dean’s forehead, sending warm feelings of love through the young man.
Cas sat up next to Dean. He ran his fingers through his hair and sighed. "I know I act confident most of the time, especially when it comes to sex. But honestly? I guess I just get really insecure sometimes. I’m sorry."
? He knew what could happen to a male teacher if parents found out he bat for the other team. He was only student teaching and he’d be gone before he even begun his career! He must have been broadcasting his panic loudly on his face, because he felt a warm hand rest on his shaking shoulder.
"You're right I did promise that. But are you really hungry for breakfast? Or maybe hungry for something else" Cas leered.
“I’m gonna prep myself so just sit back and watch.” Cas instructed as he leaned forward on all fours putting his ass even closer to Dean’s face. Dean gulped at the view. Cas flicked open the cap and poured some lube on his fingers. He rubbed them together to warm it up before reaching behind himself and rubbing a circle around his rim before he began to sink his digit inside his tight hole.
Dean made a strangled noise, hips twitching but holding as still as possible. "Fuck, master, please...it feels so good.” Dean cried out.
"Well, I said I love you for putting thought into this." Dean didn’t seem to notice the big deal with what he said.
Cas spent all day Wednesday fretting around his house cleaning. There wasn’t even much to really clean, since he was a normally a tidy person anyway, and Bianca was past the age where it constantly looked like a tornado blew through his house. But he needed everything to be perfect.
But the weekends? That was a different story. They were used to going out with friends, or at least out to the bar, just the two of them. Now that they were pushing thirty, they didn’t party as much, but it was still nice to have the option to go out on a Friday or Saturday night. Instead, they were stuck inside because of a mandatory quarantine in their area. It was sad when Cas actually looked forward to grocery shopping, because it meant he had a valid reason to leave his house.
The video played, and he watched the two guys on the screen. They were both watching something off camera, probably a porno, and Cas heated at the similarity of what he and Dean were doing. He felt himself begin to harden as he watched the men rub themselves over their jeans. He itched to reach down and rub his own cock, but he held back, not sure if that was currently allowed. That is, until Dean spoke.
Cas pulled Dean up to stop him from cleaning. That was not important right now. "Dean, love, please look at me." Cas begged.
“Pretty and smart? Man, you hit the jackpot with this one.” Gabe teased right back making Dean laugh. Cas’ shoulders relaxed a bit, now that it seemed Dean wasn’t taking any offense at his brother’s words.
“You get used to it.” Cas replied, and Dean hoped he did. He hoped he had plenty of chances with Cas to get used to it. One could only hope.
Cas finished in the kitchen and made his way to the bedroom. He was very pleased to see Dean in the exact position he wanted.
The rest of July and August passed quickly, and before he knew it, it was September and he was walking into John F. Kennedy Elementary School for his first day of student teaching. It was his last requirement for his degree and then he could get his teaching certificate. He walked to the main office to sign in and get his class placement, before making his was down the hallway to the third-grade classroom he would be at from now till December. He made sure to get there early so he could meet the teacher and settle in before the students arrived.
“Thanks Missouri. I’m...uh…I’m not exactly out yet. I don't plan to be anytime soon.” He confessed quietly, tension leaving his body as the admitted out loud to the second person ever, that he wasn't straight. A small weight was lifted, knowing another person knew and didn't seem to be judging him.
" So, he doesn't understand sex yet? Or he doesn't actually know that his brother is gay?" Cas asked snarkily.
“Fu-uck Cas.” He whimpered. He felt so full, so stretched open. It still hurt, but not as bad. He felt his muscles begin to relax against the intrusion and he took a few shaky breaths before he told Cas to move. His boyfriend began gently circling his hips, barely pulling out before grinding back in deep and after a few minutes, the pain began to fade.
Cas continued eating him out, like Dean was his last meal. Suddenly, he felt Cas’ finger rub against his hole, beside his tongue, and Dean wanted it. “Do it Cas. Finger me.” He begged, wanting to know how it felt to finally feel something deep inside him.
Once Cas caught his breath, he pulled out of Dean slowly and reached up to release the handcuffs. "I'll be right back love. I’m just going to get a washcloth to clean us up." Cas said as he leaned down and kissed his boy's cheek. Dean hummed happily, shutting his eyes with the gentle kiss and bringing his arms down to rub feeling back into his wrists.
"Good boy." Cas said as he stroked Dean's face. " I want you to go into my room and stand next to my bed. Do not undress yet."
“You don’t look that old.” She stated, her head tilted in consideration. Cas noticed John’s lip twitch before he schooled his features.
Cas obviously realized Dean was struggling with a response. “It’s ok if you didn’t like it. You don’t have to pretend. I’m sorry that this was my gift to you.” He responded dejectedly.
Cas pulled Dean to him and crushed their lips together hard. He felt so lucky to have this young man in his life. Dean sighed happily, kissing back and clutching Castiel’s shoulders. Cas pulled back and held Dean's face in his hands. "I'm so glad you tormented me into fucking you, love" he smirked.
“I… I’m….” He started before he had to swallow around the lump in his throat. “I…I have something I need to tell you.” He whispered at the floor.
"You will be the death of me." Cas chuckled. "Did you enjoy what we did before though?" He asked. He was worried that maybe Dean didn't like it.
“It’s okay Dean. I can understand why you freaked out now. I’m sorry if I pushed you further than you were ready for.” He apologized, feeling guilty. “I should have asked for consent before I touched you like that.”
“Yeah, um…yeah. So, the thing is…I’m uh, I’m pretty sure I’m not straight.” He stammered, but kept his head held high with the admission as he waited for Cas’ reaction. Cas’ eyebrows shot way up high into his hairline and his jaw dropped. It would have been comical if Dean wasn’t so nervous.
Dean shook his head with a smile, not realizing Cas was serious. He finished cleaning and called out. "Cas, you should be out the door already!”
“I don’t want him to do anything he’s uncomfortable with Charlie.” He insisted. “I just want to make sure he’s okay. That’s actually the only reason I even came in here in the first place. I feel horrible that I might have done something to unintentionally upset him.”
"Good. I want you here with me all of the time. You are the best thing that has happened to me sweetheart." Cas said as he kissed Dean.
“John!” His mother cut in “Knock it off!” She reached over to smack him upside the head. “Calm down for Pete’s sake. Dean is an adult.” She scolded.
Cas kissed the top of Dean's head as he settled on his chest. "Are you ok Dean?" He asked. He knew he had been a little rough but he hoped he didn't scare Dean off. He hoped this thing between them could grow. He already had feelings for this young little brat.
"For being bratty trying to get your attention, and for at the restaurant, sir." Dean answered breathlessly, erection trapped against Castiel’s thigh as he panted in anticipation.
"If you truly want to be with me, you will go home tonight and you will go to sleep knowing that I would love to date an amazing boy like you. Here is my address. I’d love if you would come to my house tomorrow morning. I will cook you breakfast and we can talk some more. I’m a Dom and you apparently think you are a sub. We will discuss that tomorrow. " he stated as he made his way to his car. He drove home and went to sleep, praying Dean would still want him the next day.
Dean frowned, looking down at the ground. "I'm sorry, master. It won’t happen again. I just wanted more."
What the hell was going on here? What toilet just magically flushed on its own? Well-come to think of it- that was an actual thing, but usually only in public restrooms. Cas crouched down in front of the bowl, searching for some sensor or something that would have made that happen, but he couldn’t find any. It looked like a typically ordinary toilet, with a manual flush and everything.
"That's not it, Dean. I think maybe we just jumped the gun a little love." Cas tried to reassure Dean.
“Good to know.” Cas smirked. “I’m up for almost anything. Are you okay with me fucking you? If not, I’m perfectly okay with us jerking or sucking each other off.” Dean immediately felt more relaxed. He felt so inexperienced with any guy-on-guy action. And of course, he was lucky enough to find one who wouldn’t pressure him. Of course, though, that made him want to go even further,
“What about your parents? They didn’t help?” He asked curiously. A dark look passed over Cas’ face and he grimaced.
Dean narrowed his eyes suspiciously, "You're a terrible liar. Guess that would make a good cop." He flopped back down and sighed, "Well you don’t have to tell me now, but maybe if I'm good, later you will.
“Twenty-three actually. My birthday was last month.” Dean told the other man. “Is, uh…is that okay?” He asked timidly, still unsure whether his age would be a deal breaker or not for the older man. He got an eyeroll in response.
It was Saturday night and after a whole day of doing absolutely nothing, Dean somehow convinced him to drink with him again. Not that he really had to twist Cas’ arm too hard, seeing as he was also bored out of his mind. This pandemic had them both going stir-crazy at this point. At least during the week, they both had to work from home most of the day. Castiel worked as a tax accountant so it had been easy for him to work remotely since his work was all on computers anyway. Dean was an insurance claims rep, so his work was also fairly easy to do remotely, although he was on the phone all day with customers, unlike Cas who corresponded mostly through email. But at least they remained busy with work and both had a solid income coming in. They were some of the lucky ones.
Dean’s leg was shaking as he sat on the couch, waiting for the video call to go through. He felt his boyfriend place a comforting hand on his knee.
“Yeah…, I uh…I might have freaked out a tad.” Dean chuckled humorlessly; voice laced with insecurity. It made Cas’ heart break for the younger man, remembering how nervous he had been when he was still a virgin himself.
Dean tugged his arm, "Before we go home, I want to show you somewhere. Just take a right instead of a left and drive up the dirt road.”
He could hear the glee in her voice when she responded “Yes! We’re going shopping bitches! Oh, montage!”
“Cas! Hey its so good to see you! You haven’t been in the store in forever!” The red head squealed excitedly before punching Cas’ arm playfully.
Cas held his hand out. "Nice to meet you. Dean has told me so much about you two. I’m honored to meet you as I know you are very important to Dean" He said sincerely.
He saw Dean come in and holy shit he looked amazing. The skinny jeans he was wearing left nothing to the imagination. It also showed off Dean's bubble but that he was proud of. And his green tank top matched his eyes. Castiel was totally fucked.
“I know what we planned for tonight. But you know we don’t have to do anything if you aren’t comfortable Dean.” Cas assured him, probably noticing the nervousness rolling off of Dean. Dean smiled and felt warmth spread through him at how thoughtful Cas always was. It eased some of his nerves and solidified that he definitely was ready for this.
“I mean like actual full on sex Cas. You know…” He waved his hands in a crude manner, trying to mime what he was talking about.
“Yes. Y-yes I am. I’ve uh…I’ve had a crush on you for years too.” He admitted shyly, hope blooming in his chest.
“Um… not sure, never-uh- never done this before.’ He stammered out as he stared up at the Greek god between his legs.
“I want to.” Dean’s voice was heavy with arousal, and it sent a jolt of arousal straight to the older man’s cock.
"Oh, ill shut you up all right little boy. Get on your knees for me. Might as well start practicing." Cas said.
“Yes. Yes. Yes.” Dean whimpered. He felt the other man’s ass clamp down tight on his cock as the hunter spilled his release, coming untouched onto the hood of the car. A dozen more thrusts had Cas following as he painted Dean’s insides white.
Dean chuckled, "Never again will I complain about prep. You're huge. When blowjobs happen, I don’t know what I'll do." He shifted and sat up, their skin sticking together slightly.
Not much has changed since the last time Dean was here in August. He drops his bags on the dusty, squashy chintz couch and turns on a porcelain lamp on the side table. In the kitchen, he grabs a beer out of the yellowing fridge and then plops into the worn leather recliner, reaching for the remote before sinking fully in. He must fall asleep watching TV, because before he knows it, he is waking up to the sound of the door creaking open and Bobby calling from the entryway, “Dean, you home?”
As the afternoon stretches into evening, Dean feels his last anxieties about this trip dissolve. So what if he’s a little bit achey from a night on the dorm room floor? His people are safe and happy, and he is high from the constant input of sugary foods and, dare he say, love. Like, love for his brother. And friend love. Not, like, romantic love. Gross.
“They are cool,” Cas responds. “They are very cool. They have been very good to me since I arrived here, so it does not bother me that they’re often gone. Even though I do sometimes wish for a bit more company.”
“Uhhh, Castiel,” she says, turning to him and trying to disrupt the awkward silence, “Do you want to go get brunch with me? Pitzer dining hall is open for another hour or so and I know you like their omelettes. Plus, that’ll give Dean some time to get started on your bike.”
Standing next to Gabe is a familiar pair of the bluest eyes he’s ever seen. In the harsh light of this dorm room after the soft evening tones outside, they seem supercharged, like an ever-expanding black hole sucking in everything in the immediate vicinity. Somewhere, vaguely, in the back of his mind he has a memory of Sam correcting him – black holes don’t suck anything, they just attract – so maybe it’s just that he’s never felt an attraction like this before.
“Yes, that’s one of my favorite comparison points for frankly any piece of media. That and any connection to the book of Revelation.”
Dean is sitting with Jo on the Pitzer Mounds when he first brings it up. It’s just about a week after Fall Break, and Dean has spent the last few days diving back into all of the homework that he ignored while he and Cas were in the Bay. After arriving back in Claremont, Dean had finally received a text from Sam confirming that yes, he was alive, and yes, he and Jess were a thing now. Sam also noted that yes, he was planning to cut alcohol out of his life, maybe forever. Dean agreed.
His delivery is so dry that Dean almost can’t tell for sure if he’s joking. When they both turn back to face the TV, Dean tries hard not to notice where their shoulders press together.
“Welcome,” Cas greets them. He’s wearing a pair of blue sweatpants and a tan bathrobe with another old t-shirt. Dean feels a blast of dry, deliciously cold air from the room behind him. “Please, make yourselves comfortable.”
“Oh my gosh, Castiel!” she squeals, throwing her (admittedly sweaty, Dean would know) arms around the boy who has just arrived at the bike shop.
After delivering the required tools, Dean sits down on Jo’s bed and takes a sip from his vodka cranberry. It burns its way down his throat and he starts to relax a little bit, feeling comforted by the soft coziness of Jo’s dorm room. He leans back and begins chatting with Anna, getting his update on all the rugby gossip. As always, there’s a lot of it – apparently Claire broke up with her girlfriend in August and is now pursuing a straight girl from her major while Krissy is hopelessly obsessed with a freshman who won’t give her the time of day.
