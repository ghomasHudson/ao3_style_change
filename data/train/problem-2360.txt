Then, Cas appears at the door and Claire gets up more quickly than she wanted to demonstrate, with Kaia following her to embrace them.
4. I didn't watch the finale thinking it would have everything I wanted from the story, because it would never happen, and even then it was difficult... But, as Misha said, we can write our own endings, so this is mine.
Amara takes his hands and they both close their eyes. A flowing stream passes through them and Amara and Jack shine. He finally feels what is left of Chuck's power flowing out of him with Amara absorbing everything again.
Garth lowers his shoulders, he is still the usual Garth, but he seems to carry two heavier burdens of concern.
Jack is not like Chuck, he is not like the Archangels and he looks much more like the Winchesters, including the honorary member Castiel, than with those beings who should have been his family. She is impressed with what she felt when she was connected to Jack.
Then Castiel turned to them both, noticing their expressions of surprise. Maybe he got in the way too much.
And Cas talks like he's just pointing out facts, and manages to sound more genuine in the final question than Dean thought possible, even though he still sounds a little defensive as well.
For a moment neither of them says anything, they just stare at each other, a silence weighing more than it should. Cas lets his hands rest on top of his plate, like he doesn't know whether to push it at Dean or throw the sandwich away. Dean just shakes his head, disguising the slightest of smiles, then he clears his throat before continuing.
, as he hears his family wishing him congratulations, with Patience taking some pictures and Cas close by hugging him. Everyone has fun and tells jokes, talking banalities... But in the case of this family, banalities involve telling about the time that fairies were a national threat or when a werewolf once had to remove all teeth, or when vampires pretended to be vampires to attract people who wanted to be attracted to vampires. It is the normality that Dean knows and wants to share with others.
Sam Winchester had a plan. He would answer a call from Krissy, who together with Aiden and Josephin are leading one of the support groups to deal with ex-monsters. He and Dean would spend a few hours on the road, arrive at dusk at Krissy's house, solve what they needed, and they would go back to the Bunker giving a ride to the young hunters. Sam hoped that Cas and the others would carry out their part of the plan as well.
Rowena says in her sonorously graceful voice. The image is a little blurry, but little by little, Rowena's face is becoming more defined.
Dean exchanged a smile with Cas, pulling out of his thoughts. The bottles' glasses touched. Everything was fine for today, and that's enough… Being with Cas like this was enough for him… It should be, although there was something else missing… Being with Cas was always enough and insufficient in the same song. It was at this point that Dean stopped asking himself questions, because that insufficiency drew a door in front of him. A door that Dean didn't dare touch, moving forward so he could find whatever it was behind, so he could explain it in words that would shape what was missing… He faced that door without telling himself why he still needed more from himself as much as Cas.
Sam asks Jack with a frown as he sits at the kitchen table. Eileen is on the bench, with her back against Sam's chest while he keeps an arm around her, she wanders her hand over his as a gesture of comfort.
Now Jack was back, he took it upon himself to destroy Michael, and apparently the boy burned part of his own soul to save them. Dean just hoped that after his conversation with Donatello, he could really trust that there was still enough for Jack to continue being who he was.
Dean passes Cas a beer, while Cas offers him the last two slices of pizza that was on the table behind them. They smile more easily at each other and Dean glances at Cas, who responds with a smile so kind and eyes shining, distracted from the film.
, Dean remembers Cas' voice and his body freezes over by repeating the same sequence of events in his mind.
factor and that Dean could start commenting that he also has his birthday approaching. So Sam thinks quickly about changing the subject.
Sam centralized the articulation work between hunters and allies who were in a position to provide help, and those who needed help, even if they could not understand all their needs. Mia was contributing to the side of the ex-monsters, getting in touch with those who previously lived among humans, without putting them at risk, and bringing anyone who wanted to participate to the teams. Two months in that process, and it still seems far from over, that was just the beginning.
Dean has a tremor in his voice, but his body is finally able to relax. Without even thinking about it, he lets Cas' head rest on his chest and with his left hand he caresses Cas' neck, feeling his hair, comforting him.
Jack nods and the two spend a non-existent time observing that scenario, until he states that Amara could try pineapple pizza when he visits her again.
Dean cursed, with less anger than he thought possible, though more frustrated. He pressed to his temples as if a headache had started.
And Cas knows that is not the point, however, as far as he can imagine, he also does not fully understand where this conversation will go.
And Cas nods with conviction, as if ready to break through the walls and rebuild the place if need be.
she approaches, and they both sit under the central tree. This time neither the snake nor the little garden keeper appear.
Dean takes a deep breath, then turns his face and stares at her for a few seconds, just to make sure it's okay, that after all this talk they're still okay. And he smiles at her.
Dean had no idea who had written it.  He found no other sign of the same handwriting.  Was it another sub, wrenching his gut out?  Did the other person survive?  Did they give in and return to their family?  He couldn’t know, but the words seemed both desperate and defiant.  He found himself often thinking about what they meant and where the person was now.
But he reminded himself that his life now was nothing like what he knew of Fairfields.  His stocked kitchen gave him choice over food, that was healthy and full of taste.  This was not the food of the mass produced institution. And then there was the discovery of the Netflix and Disney+ accounts loaded onto his laptop.  He wondered if that was standard, or had Bobby told Rufus of Dean’s love of Star Wars, so Disney had been added for his entertainment.
“No Mary, I refuse.”  Dean heard the door closing in a quiet slam, bringing the conversation to an end.
Dean would mostly work on the car side of things.  While Rufus couldn’t give him the same opportunities for car restoration he had with Bobby, he assured Dean that there would be enough work to be challenging and engaging.
“No Dean.  It would mean giving up all you know.  You would disappear.  You would have to leave behind your family, never see your parents, or your brother again. You would have to always be careful, never to say too much, never to show too much.  For most it would be too much to ask, for you and your needs, it might even be impossible. I can’t make the choice for you, but I can give you a choice. Fairfields or to fight.”
Dean had not done well at school.  As a younger child his attention span and an urge to be in motion in some way had caused a distraction. Teachers didn’t like the boy who was always rocking on his chair legs and constantly getting up from his desk.  And he didn’t really see the point in learning how the seasons worked, they would continue to work regardless if he got a D or an A in his work.
Dean forced himself further into consciousness.  Looking up, he realised his pillow was actually Garth and his head was resting in the other man’s lap. Dean struggled a little, trying to get his body to move, embarrassment flooding him.
The idea made him want to cry. But with his Dad in the room, already unable to look at him, tears would only make it worse.
Dean had started to believe he’d make it, that somehow he’d been able to overcome what had threatened to send him to an institution. The routine had lulled him into a sense of security. It wasn’t that he had beaten his disability, or even believed it no longer held a grip on him. But he truly believed that as long as he fed his need to be of service he could continue his life, be productive, and maybe over time build a makeshift family.
“You think you need taking care of because you’ve always been told you will need taking care of.  Learned helplessness Dean.  No one told you you couldn’t do this job, couldn’t run half my business.  I just gave you an office and said have at it. And you showed me, and the world that you were able.”
“I don’t know my needs.  I don’t know what’s going on. How can you help me when I don’t even know what’s, what my body needs.” Dean’s voice trembled. “What happens if.. I don’t make it.”
The news had been devastating.  Dean saw the look of fear pass over his parents faces as the doctor reported another stark increased in his hormone levels.
After a week of isolation, everything started to happen at once.  Rufus had taken him downstairs to the workshops.  It was the weekend so they were empty and locked up.  Dean was given a set of masterkeys and given a run down of how Rufus ran his business.  Dean learned that aside from himself, Rufus hired a part time office manager, who was responsible for the book keeping and ordering side of the business. While not aware of the full truth of the situation, Rufus had reassured Dean that Garth would not be a problem.
Dean had been young when he had been diagnosed.  Everyone said this was lucky, the interventions could be put into place before his dynamic could take hold.
As Dean’s health improved, he started to establish a routine.  As much as he continued to hate mornings with an absolute passion, he forced himself out of bed early every morning.  He took the time in the morning to make sure he was well groomed.  It had never been something he’d bothered with in his old life.  Partly because it just wasn’t an established routine.  He didn’t come from a family that was too focused on appearance.  Their mother had cut everyone’s hair until Sammy, at age 15 threw a fit to be allowed to go to a stylist.  And partly, he’d always been worried that people would see his grooming habits as him giving into the urges of his submissive diagnosis.
Dean went to respond, but the lump in his throat felt like concrete, so he ended up nodding as he continued to force the tears to stop.
Gordon had looked at him, mocking disgust in his eyes and asked. “Don’t you think you should get my permission first, perve?”
“No they don’t. There are some, some that have fought to fulfil their own needs.  But I know someone, he’s a little cantankerous, my sort of cantankerous, rather than… the other kind. He’s a grouchy bastard, even more than me, but he in his way, would be able to hold you to your task, as you might need.”
“I don’t pay you both to sit around chattering like old ladies” he grumbled as he headed to his office.  Dean flashed Garth a conspiratory grin, before getting up to pour Rufus his own coffee.
Dean came to a halt at the top of the stairs.  He could hear his parents’ voices.  They were having an argument.  They weren’t yelling, but Dean recognised the cadence in the conversation.  Indeed, the fact it remained low and hushed rather than all out screaming meant it was probably about him.  Knowing Dean was in the house, Mary would be working hard not to upset him.
Each day had the same routine. Some part of the night was spend curled up on the bathroom floor, holding on, waiting for the waves of nausea to fade. When the morning came, the hot tea became the warm emotional support that pushed him on with his day.  At first, he fumbled with the day.  But as the day passed, he was able to achieve more, small parts of machinery rebuilt, a dead engine coming back to life.  When on Friday, he scrubbed the grease off his hands, Dean was able to feel a small sense of achievement.
Dean discovered he loved to cook, but this just brought frowns from his parents, so he supressed that interest and only showed abilities that his father would favour. He became good at home repair, adequate at gardening, but where he started to shine was working with anything with an engine. It was through this that somehow he’d found himself being shown around Bobby’s shop.
As for clothes, he wanted to look dapper, but had to admit to himself he really had no clue.  Second hand plaid had filled his closets, partly because the aforementioned lack of clue, but also, in his job, clothes did not remain unstained and torn for long. But he did buy himself a pair of jeans, for the weekends, that hugged him in all the right ways.  The first weekend he wore them, he’d had to run back to the apartment, feeling both pretentious but also dangerously exposed. He’d become more comfortable over the weeks, and now he allowed himself to admit he preened at the idea of attention.
His new home now consisted of one room, with a small bathroom attached. A single bed was placed against one wall, obviously meant to act as both bed and sofa, the room also contained a small kitchen and dining table set.  This would be his home now, or at least for the next seven days.  AT this point Dean had no idea where the rest of his life would lead.
The first day his hand shook too much to unscrew the bolt he wilfully chose to ignore it.  It had been a long day, he was tired, he stubbornly insisted to the worried internal view. As the symptoms grew, the shaking, the forgetfulness, the gnawing ache in his stomach, he found excuses, reasoning with himself so as to make it anything but his submission sending his body haywire.  He refused to lose everything once again.
“Full night’s sleep, man.  It was a good night.” Dean delivered Garth’s coffee before grabbing the worksheet for the day. “It this rate I might get through a whole day without a nap.”
He wondered now if her prediction would finally come true.  He had been grateful to gain his independence and worked hard to maintain it.  There ha been times when he had wanted to reach out, to ask for help, but the knowledge of being seen as a weak sub always pushed him on.  Until now, when something beyond his control threatened to shut everything down.  It seemed so unfair.
His father disappeared into the garage as soon as they arrived home.  Usually when he visited, Dean would join him there.  Their combined love of cars and engines had given them a place to meet when Dean was younger and still remained a shared love.  Leaning over an engine there was o lingering shame or fear at Dean’s diagnosis.  They could just be father and son.
He always tripled checked the locks every night before going to bed, fearful of authorities raiding his home while he slept. Whenever he left his home, he would scan the streets constantly, looking for anyone out of place, anyone paying him too much attention.   He was wary and afraid of anyone who crossed his path.
He had no idea how long he’d laid there, riding out the pain and fear.  He latched onto those words on the bathroom wall, repeating them over in his head. Time passed in that haze until he felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, pulling him back. The hands and arms surrounded him, supporting him to his feet.  The movement made Dean whimper softly, but a gruff voice quietly shushed him.
Dean had found a laptop sitting on the table, with a wifi password card sitting on top of it. He realised in that moment that his use of the internet would no longer be monitored.  His parents, under advisement from the specialists believed the internet would be too overwhelming for their sub-aligned son, so had set strict guardian-controls on all his devices.  Now he had the whole digital world sitting at his fingertips.  At that moment, it had all seemed far too overwhelming.
But now, as treatments continued to hold back the disordered thoughts and aches, Dean knew he’d let his father down. When the standard half-yearly tests had shown dramatic increases in hormones and brain activity, Dean had really hoped he would be fixed by the next regime of tests. He was willing to put up with the pain, nausea and embarrassment if it meant he could be normal.  Well as normal as possible.
But then, one morning just as he finished shaving, he doubled over in pain.  It had come so forcefully, so quickly he hadn’t time to move.  The remains of his breakfast mixing with the shaving suds in the sink. He ended up crawling to the toilet, unwilling to risk being caught be another wave.  His body seemed to shiver from the cold even as he burned up.
When Monday came, the first day of his new job, Dean had pulled himself up off the floor and got dressed.  He felt the responsibility to Rufus who had done so much for him, had offered him a home, a job and a safe place. So, while curling up in bed tired and depressed pulled at him, Dean wanted to hold up his responsibility, his part of the bargain so he had headed down stairs to the workshop.
He’d gotten a good life.  He loved his job.  Yes, he probably only got it originally because Bobby was a family friend.  And while some of the other staff saw him as incapable, Dean had been able to sow himself as skilled, with a rather amazing knack for coaxing back the run-down classic cares people had assumed were only worth scrapping.
Dean should probably be grateful that his dynamic position would end up reducing him to a compliant imbecile, unable to care for himself.  but oddly he could find no gratitude in this situation.
At first Bobby had scared Dean.  The older man was surly on his best days, and Dean soon learned there were days to give him a wide berth, leave him shut in his office.  But soon Dean started to find the surliness comforting.  Bobby was like that with everyone, it wasn’t simply a reaction to Dean. And once Dean stopped flinching away, and dropping his head as he shuffled off, Bobby started to teach him more about engines and cars.
“Bobby” incredulity showing in Dean’s voice “are you trying to get me to believe submissive illness isn’t real, that all those tests are lies?”
So when Rufus finally knocked and let himself in, Dean was relieved to see the other man. Rufus had told him he’d be staying here for awhile, at least until he detoxed for the medication in his system. Dean would no longer have to stay hidden inside, but the place was private enough to offer him some security.
The next day Dean managed to wrangle a lift from his father into work.  He purposefully ignored the looks his parents passed between them as he filled his thermos with coffee.  Bobby’s coffee was as thick as tar, and tasted of it. So, he made sure to always have a stash of his own, to get him through the day.  Or at least until lunch.
But then, later that night, Dean was woken by his body shaking. When he stood up, heading to get a glass of water, a wave of nausea hit him hard. He made it to the bathroom just in time.  The coolness of the porcelain eased the shock of trembling heat, but he couldn’t find the energy to drag himself to his feet.
Rufus Turner, the man Bobby had told Dean to contact, had been everything Bobby had described.  Old and grizzled like Bobby himself, and perhaps twice as cantankerous.  Bobby must have informed him Dean was on his way, as Rufus had immediately lead him to the back of his workshop and up the stairs to a tiny one room apartment.  Rufus had made it very clear that Dean was not to leave this room for a week, and then shut him inside.
“You have special needs Dean.  You always will.  But we, but I believe that the drugs and the institutions only enhance these needs, feed them, make them uncontrollable. But a job, giving you that sense of service, someone holding you accountable, how own home to create, all of those can fill the urges in you.”
They had always had a good relationship.  Dean’s disability never impacted their games or came up as they obsessed about Star Wars. There were no subs in the galaxy far far away.  But as Sam grew older, and more popular, he became more aware that his brother was different.
He desperately wanted someone to make the choice for him.  The ambivalence felt like it was tearing him apart.  He remembered back to one of the meetings they had had with the specialist.  He had sat there silently as the woman had told his parents that ambivalence and uncertainty were not something sub-aligned people could handle.  They were unable to process ambiguity or the grey areas.  The specialist had instructed his parents that they must always give him clear instructions or Dean would overcompensate and shut down.
With that Gabriel did a roll which should’ve been impossible for someone his height and weight. He also brought Sam with him.
Sam raised his shotgun to shoot the ghost with the salt shells but Gabriel pushed it down and looked at the ghost.
Jack thought for a second “I don’t know. I’m not used to eating much so I don't know what I like” he said.
What the Hell was Gabriel thinking! Did he actually think that he could take Michael down himself!? Or maybe he was trying to sacrifice himself to save the others?
“Cassie, you good” Gabriel asked. He was worried about his little brother. He may not show his care very often but he did care about some of the younger angels. The others were usually assholes.
He disappeared before the salt shell hit him and appeared behind Gabriel. He turned around but was thrown to the wall nearest.
“And I have eyes and am good at inspecting people, especially when it comes to this kind of stuff” Gabriel added as he put the bill in his wallet.
“You try being stuck on Earth for 200 hundred years without anyone being able to see you” Gabriel said “human souls aren’t made for that”
“Nope” Dean popped the p and took a step towards Castiel, their faces now inches apart “But we can teach him. Just like we taught you. I mean, how hard can it be to teach an archangel how to hunt?”
“I honestly have no idea” Sam said and lied sideways, looking towards Gabriel, his head resting on the palm of his hand. He used to other to pull Gabriel towards himself.
Cas was shocked. It was not uncommon for an angel to lose their grace. Cas lost his grace and Gabriel did most of his too. But giving it away
“He was going to try to take down Michael himself. I stopped him. And- and he pushed Lucifer to Michael with the remainder of his grace, I think. Then he passed out.”
Sam stopped in front of Gabriel, very close, and started taking Gabriel’s tie of whilst Gabriel stood there like a moose who saw a flashlight.
“I know a good place” Gabriel said and took his seat in the back of the car. Dean sat down on the driver’s seat.
Gabriel was quiet for a few second but he figured that being honest to Sam would be the best thing to do.
Okay, Dean needed to be honest. They didn’t immediately go back to the hotel after they left that restaurant. They went to a supermarket and bought beer, a bottle of whiskey (Gabriel insisted, as always) and a bunch of salt for the hunt and went to the hotel.
But Gabriel didn’t tell the new updates and what his weeks-long research was about. He didn’t tell Sam that he had some hopes of seeing his friend again. It was very not likely, but Gabriel had to try.
“How can I help you, gentlemen?” she asked. Her voice was young and sweet. She must really like her job.
“Yes. It symbolizes our connection to God. He has given us our graces and if we willingly throw give away- “
This chapter is a bit of a flashback chapter, describing the things that happened to Gabriel mostly from Sam POV
He moved his hand so that it would touch Cas’s. The angel pulled back but Dean kept going and held his hand.
When they were eating lunch, it was fine because Gabriel knew how to keep the chat away from certain things. He’d probably done it for years. But Dean didn’t know how. And this was the only way to  keep the talk under his control.
Sam remembered the small amount of time they knew each other. Starting from that case in California where he posed as a janitor, then to that time in Mystery Spot where he killed Dean about 100 times
The church was not that far away, only a five-minute drive. Dean talked to Cas (who was in the passenger seat) and Jack (who was in the back) about what they were going to ask about and how to act. Castiel listened and nodded whereas Jack kept telling Dean that they have done this before and already
“No. They were both how they always were like. Alex had told me that he was going to ask somebody out and asked for my advice.”
They stopped when they were standing in front of the first line of seats. One of the nuns saw them and hurried towards them.
But he had to do this. He had to stop daydreaming about Sam and get on with what he was doing because Sam had asked him to do this. Gabriel didn’t want to be useless, he also didn’t want to disappoint Sam.
Castiel gave Dean some basic ingredients that they had in the Bunker and Sam a sigil to draw on the head on Gabriel’s bed.
“Dean thinks it’s Elvis but I actually like Celine Dion more. I mean, Elvis is a god, but Celine Dion comes a just bit higher"
“There’s a TV series?” Gabriel asked. "The last time I heard, Martin had stopped writing amd that was in 2005 I think it was a Feast with Crows”
Dean let out a relieved sigh “God damn it, Sammy. Yeah, ok we can do that. Right?” he asked the back seaters.
“Sam, in case you forgot, I am human. I need to eat and take care of myself and not get wounded and all. I’ve never done this before.”
The man didn’t answer for a few seconds. “Agents, young Laura was transgender and William was pansexual” he said.
His brain was full of information now. About the guy’s horrific history. His mother had died during birth. An abusive father who didn’t really care about him. Getting rejected from good colleges and women. His father’s death and a long year of depression and loneliness.
was the exact reason why he left. His family was broken and he wanted to feel loved. He found this need from humanity and stayed with them.
Sam then realized that the new bit he wrote was more like a letter. But it was written on a wall. Who could-
“Dating back a couple centuries before Earth’s creation. I was still in heaven, so was Lucifer, he hadn’t rebelled yet. And I was bored. Because at the time my job was to be the Messenger but there were no messages to deliver yet so I had a bunch of free time.
“A group of people, actually” he said. They all looked at him, confused. Castiel even tilted his head a little. Typical.
Gabriel and Sam weren’t the definition of ‘normal’ but Sam liked to think that they were to get more ideas of what to do with Gabe
“That would mean that your soul is attached to something” Castiel said “that is what is keeping you on Earth if it not your bones”
“Lucifer rebelled and I had a lot of messages to carry from Dad. He hung around the wrong kind of people and got sent out of Heaven like the others. I never saw him again.”
Time seemed to stop. It was just them, in their own dreamworld, no outside, no problems, and they just kissed.
“I really wish we could do this under different circumstances” Sam said as Gabriel tosses Sam’s tie towards his bed.
Dean eyed Cas, who was still looking at his laptop, probably researching. His face was straight, focused on his work and Dean thought that he just looked so goddamn hot.
Dean said that there was no need wake up early and they probably chatted until 3am or something. It was a good night.
They then went out to eat some breakfast in the café that they went to the first day. It was awesome as the last time.
But everything changed during the apocalypse, in that hotel full of pagan gods. There, Gabriel helped them and even
“Okay. Umm the name I got is a bit trashy” he said. Gabriel raised an eyebrow. He didn’t give a shit about how Sam thought the game was. He was bored and wasn’t tired. The best way to spend this time was with Sam.
“Great” he said as he stood up. Everyone looked at him confused “Oh, there is a classic car collection place in the town. Thought you might like it.”
But why can’t they? Because Cas was a guy? Cas had explained this to him once. Angels didn’t have genders, not like humans did. They were a whole different species. Cas only
Dean would NEVER admit this to ANYBODY but he did like bits of TV land. Definitely not that weird Japanese show but meeting Dr Sexy was his dream and he did it (he also didn’t care that Sexy turned out to be Gabriel. He just imagined that Dr Sexy was actually Dr Sexy and everything was fine).
But Dean was shy. He had never felt like this before. Before, if he wanted to go out with a girl, he put his charming smile on and started talking to her and it worked.
Dean was expecting to see Cas, Mary, Jack, Gabriel and some other people they rescued from that Alternate Universe to be seated around a table, chatting and having a beer. He thought that the others had probably left to start a life for themselves.
“I said that they would do so when we came back here. Gabe said yesterday night when we were watching the stars.” Sam said.
But it wasn’t exactly a voice. It was more like layers of wind getting on top of each other and somehow speaking.
“Ok” “Let me finish my coffee first” Sam and Gabriel said at the same time. Sam gave Gabriel a look that shouted
Gabriel wondered. Sam was smart. Definitely smarter than Dean but Gabriel didn’t know about his special ability of hacking.
It didn’t take him more than 2 minutes to find Emma Smith’s account. He looked a Sam. He was still on his computer, typing. He probably was hacking into the security cameras or something. Gabriel was supposed to look back down at his laptop and keep going with the search but, he didn’t want to. He wanted to keep staring at Sam, and his all-time-perfect hair
“Okay mom” Gabriel said, defeated “I’ll go to bed and get a good night’s sleep like a good boy.” He added sarcastically.
“Yeah, I am. Anyway, I went there and everyone was minding their own business and I saw this angel in a corner with headphones on. I think he was painting the Alpha Centauri, not sure. Anyway, we started chatting and I realized that he was actually talking to me because he liked me rather than because I am an archangel and we became friends”
The drive took about 3 hours in total. When they arrived at Nebraska, they found a cheap, 3-star hotel and got a room.
This was because he was used to flying or just transporting. It was so much easier. You could travel miles in a second and not be tired at all. But he no longer had his wings and had to do everything the human way
After dinner Gabriel went back to the dungeon to carry on with his research. He had first started by researching about archangel graces to double check his knowledge. The books all said the same thing. ‘
"That would depend on both the origin and destination of record, whether or not the destination listed is the ultimate one," Cas answers.  "Negotiating with the border guards would be the easiest option, who for reasons best known to the vagaries of advanced bureaucracy, have the power to issue copies of any company's existing passthrough credentials from the checkpoints with almost no oversight, which is why ours imply we're associated with General Mills and regularly deliver large amounts of food to Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana."
Looking between them, Teresa thinks carefully and Castiel notices Alicia's got a pen and is taking notes on the back of Joe's report.
"We couldn't win," he interrupts, because it's true, because it's self-evident, because there's nothing else to say.  It falls like a stone in the air between them, but not for the inevitability, but for what it encompasses:
(Dean gets this isn't a guarantee--Cas's judgment was based on Alison as she was and is, the future unknown territory, free fucking will in action--but the intersection of infinite being and mortal means Cas's personal feelings are both separate and not the kind of thing he bothers to hide.  He might have tolerated Alison's existence (hostilely, probably with a lot of creepy staring and not just because that's fun), but no way would he have liked her if he'd sensed anything that didn't fit that standard. He sure as hell wouldn't have started teaching her how to use her abilities with what Dean's suspects is very un-Host-like enthusiasm.)
"Sincere interest," he assures her as he adds cream to his own cup and waits impatiently for her to finish with the sugar.  "That cast will be very uncomfortable tonight if you wish to dance, which I was told is a feature in large celebrations."
--and walked on two surprisingly unbroken feet all the way here while pulling a goddamn knife out of thin air.  She said yes to your fucking goddess because she wanted to save the kids and didn't care what she gave up to do it."
Pulling the door open, he climbs inside, turning the key automatically.  "Don't say anything," he manages, hearing the tremor in his voice as he begins to back out into the nearest clear street.  "Not yet."
"There's nothing else today."  Getting to his feet, he ignores the flash of Dean's grin as he takes out his keys.  "You realize you're being a cocktease and that's extremely annoying?"
Chuck's head snaps around. "How did anyone know to use it without a name?  I mean, do angels just--" he trickles off, like he's not sure how to finish that sentence. "Know it?"
Dean makes a face, but his attention is obviously elsewhere.  "Cyn was on patrol before I got here, right?"  Castiel nods obediently.  "Give her to James for his team; that gives 'em two people with patrol experience."
"Life lesson," Dean explains helpfully.  "No one passed but Cas: everyone else, you got studying to do.  Seriously, what the fuck, people?"
"Yeah, I'm great, thanks for asking," Dean adds as he extends his other hand toward Castiel imperiously, a silent but unmistakable command that his expression implies he's annoyed that he even has to make.  "Nice trick and everything, but I wasn't serious about
"I don't know," Cas answers slowly.  "It wasn't necessary.  My Grace still recognizes me. It's still mine, simply--inaccessible, because I shaped it to this purpose.  It shouldn't do that, but then again, angels don't generally use the last of their Grace to create wards, so maybe that's perfectly normal and no one ever tried."  He looks at Dean speculatively.  "What else did Chuck tell you?"
"And no one in Hell would know about it until it was completed," he says.  "Which would give everyone just enough time to try to run.  Except my Brethren, of course, but they might surprise me by showing some amount of intelligence and doing just that."
"If I think you want to leave, we leave," he says quietly.  "Look, we get done on the training field today, we can go back home, no problem."
"I could help," Castiel offers for the third time that morning when Dean drops onto the thick blanket beside him before collapsing backward with a sigh as he absently rubs his right hand.
"For the first: Mama didn't say as much, but I think--you told her you wanted to talk to it, which I assume means Zena told you it had made the request." He doesn't need to remember (yet) to have the definite impression of,
Chuck nods hesitantly, picking up enthusiasm when Dean nods with him.  "Yeah, I should--yeah.  Uh, I'll just go--"
They went through a lot of treatments, that much he was told, but it wasn't until she left the clipboard on his bed that he understood what that really meant.  He pulled out the bottom ten pages before she came back to get it--considering the number, barely noticeable--and read through them during his designated nap times (read: whenever either Cas or Vera decided he looked tired and they were only mostly right) trying to figure out what the hell happened to him.  It's not that Cas wouldn't tell him if he asked; it's that whatever happened, he's not sure Cas is ready to talk about all of it.  The two times his heart stopped are worrying, but not nearly as much as why the last one has a lot of cross-outs, entire areas of potential prognosis scratched out entirely.
"Let me look at Jody and Matt, and I'll be right behind you," Dolores says, taking his hand and letting him help her to her feet.  He nods, watching as she joins her helpers before moving to crouch by Alicia.
"Only the ones we survived," he answers reasonably.  "That would be all of them. I could be wrong, but I think we're on a streak."
"Hunter to hunter: never trust a pixie.  Fae are bad enough, but at least they don't bite."  She leans her head on one hand.  "Forward and back, Dean, and they didn't see us.  You're impossible, which helped a lot, because that's what hid us from them.  We weren't important to them, so we could make ourselves from the start.  We had a choice."  Before Dean can ask who she's talking about, her smile fades.  "It took all time and space to make you, and they thought that meant you didn't get one."
"You think I'm just going to let you walk away?" Lucifer asks curiously just as he before he reaches the mouth of the alley.
Cas serenely removes his own coat, looking not at all surprised when one of Amanda's recruits--Hector, he thinks absently, okay, he got them all on sight now, awesome--takes it and then Dean's.  "I don't see why you're objecting--"
"When you went into that attic, you were dissolved from this reality," he says, and Dean makes a very quiet sound with a suspicious resemblance to laughter while Nate's eyes widen. "For less than a millisecond: in that time, Winchester House panicked and seems to have suspended time, rolled it back, pulled your entire genetic profile from you the moment before you dissolved--and for that matter possibly the entire human genome--found every infinite part of you within itself, and very carefully and very thoroughly put you back together.  And to make sure that didn't happen again, it traded some infinite parts of itself with you, which in essence is contamination."  He searches Nate's face.  "You're fine, of course."
do anything.  None of us can but keep the perimeter stable and help out where we're needed.  Residents--and early arrivals--have been storm prepping since yesterday, so it's just--you know, leveling up.  Mercedes is leading the groups getting the livestock under cover and also, because this is shit you share, the culling has been going on since last night, so think about that at lunch."
Vera sighs, leaning back against the wall.  "Thought of that, but if I was, Sarah was with me.  I made her repeat it twice just to make sure. I guess it makes sense; I mean, they both loved Andy...."
You get used to it, he told Dean: that's survival, but stupidly--so stupidly--he hoped for more than that.
"I--," He stops, his voice rasping unpleasantly in his ears and wonders if he's sounded like this through their entire conversation.  Clearing his throat, he tries again.  "I apologize for…"
"Officially, all residents who wished to leave would report to one of the military checkpoints and after three days of isolation, if they showed no symptoms, they were allowed to leave."
"You're welcome," she says with a mischievous smile before looking around the room, taking in the pictures spreading across the walls.  "It's here somewhere, but where...."
"Having established that, question," Alicia says before Dean can decide which option here is more horrifying. "Did Crowley authorize this?"
"Which to be fair, you kind of are."  Cas's nods in serene agreement.  "Does he know anything about engines?"
, treason against the State," she agrees.  "The penalty: stripped of his citizenship, flogged, and publicly executed, his fortune confiscated, he and his family rendered
Dean kind of gets why.  He can't quite make a fist anymore with his right; even trying makes it shake so badly he can't even close his hand, and nothing--and he does mean nothing--doesn't hurt like hell.  Stretching it out, he checks his throbbing finger and blinks; stretched across the tip is a thin, mostly-healed line following the curve of the skin.  Running his right thumb over it, though, he can't feel the scab at all, just rough, callused flesh and a burst of heat like he touched a lit match; so that's what's going on.
Castiel arrives at the infirmary to find Dean and Alicia sharing the bed and pouring over medical records with matching expressions of horrified fascination, and all hope they're anyone's but his die an immediate death.  Shutting the door, he almost sighs as Alicia's head comes up without even the pretense of guilt, while Dean continues to read for a few more moments, shaking his head sadly before closing the folder.
Dean gulps a mouthful of scalding coffee to get something like clarity, sinking down on the concrete steps and taking in what he's pretty sure is what he and Cas are going to be trying to create real soon now.
Unexpectedly, his voice cuts off, and Dean takes a second to pick up his jeans from the floor before looking up.  "What?"
Alison and Teresa pretended they were choking on their excellent coffee, ten pounds of which is currently in Castiel's bag.)
It's the same group from yesterday, which reminds him to find out what kind of schedule Chitaqua has for patrol, but makes it a lot easier to put names to faces and get a decent idea of the kind of people Cas is dealing with.
"Please, Sempronia," Claudia whispers.  "Please, leave me this much."  Jerking her hand away, she rolls away, turning her back to Sempronia.  "Emet, make her leave!"
Coming inside, she shuts the door, and he waves her to the couch, taking the seat beside her and wishing he'd remembered to grab more coffee from the mess for the pot in here.  "What happened?"
"You're correct," Cas says, taking a drink from his own beer before studying Dean thoughtfully.  "You saw the MREs in supply?  You haven't been to the armory yet--"
"Risa told us stories about the team leaders' meetings," she says conversationally; of course she did.  He'd only be surprised if she didn't perform them for Vera and Amanda's amusement (and wishes he could have watched).  "Forty-two synonyms for 'wrong' in descending order by number of syllables?  She said she wasn't sure whether Dean was gonna kill you or himself."
you can't do with five plain old human senses and no bleeding from your ears, got it?  We'll do this the old fashioned way."  Dean's fingers tighten on his jaw.  "Got it?  I wanna hear the words, Cas."
"That's a good question.  Let me get back to you after I've thought about it." He pushes off the tree, grabbing the bottle before continuing on what is unmistakably a retreat toward the jeep with equally unsubtle speed.
"Destiny is a word far more vast than the definition would imply."  Cas frowns, eyes distant.  "Sometimes, what you've become makes it impossible to see all potential paths.  What you know--limits--what you believe can be achieved."
"Oh yeah," she confirms.  "Dean's going to handle observation tonight--God knows he has more experience than I do--but I'll be by to check those stitches in the morning and we'll trade off for the next few days, see if anything else shows up."
Vera and Joe wince in unison, looking at Dean warily. He shrugs, taking another drink of coffee (Vera wasn't even
Still smiling, Vera folds away the ruined towel and holds out a hand toward Castiel until he realizes she wants him to get another.  Taking one from the stack, he approaches, stopping exactly the length of his reach and handing it to Vera, aware of Sudha, Neeraja, and Njoya all smiling at him indulgently for reasons unclear.
Disappointment seems like such a small risk until it happens, Castiel reflects as the team comes inside, dripping water all over the immaculately clean floor but thankfully avoiding the rug, which is already becoming dusty due to the rain.  It's not as if he's not used to it, and so is Dean, but once--just once--he wants not to be.
"What about for Mira?" he snaps before he can stop himself, and closes his eyes: hell, no.  "You know, let me start over."
"Can't live his life for him," Alison says practically.  "Can't order him to stay in your camp--oh wait, you can do that.  My mistake."
"We confirmed it can simultaneously affect both the visual and auditory spectrum," Castiel says, deciding perhaps it's time to return to the original subject; it can't be healthy for Joseph to be that color for very long.  "It was tested on members of the camp," he pauses to let Amanda moan in horror, "as well as Jeffrey."
"Depends on if you like the taste of cream," a familiar voice says, and he looks up to see  Haruhi grinning at him from the other side of the trestle table, black hair pulled back in a loose ponytail.  Setting down another basket of tea--green, he notes, though in small, individual plastic bags that indicate these were grown locally--she gestures to the cylinders. "While all come from the same cow-substance, the taste is different.  And completely different from powdered, which has nothing to do with cows no matter what anyone tells you."
"Get down," Dean says, shoving Amanda down on the hood and covering her just as Alicia straightens, kicking a Croat in the face before pointing her gun at the hood and shooting, Matt following with a shot to the car beside it.  Turning, Alicia hops off the hood and runs toward Matt and Dean sees her wide grin as she fists on of her hands and the car explodes behind her.  "They carry C fucking 4?"  No fucking way could that car explode like that otherwise even if they both hit the fuselage. "Ana
Castiel could list the reasons, but for some reason, he can't quite remember them, not in the face of David's bewilderment and Dean's terrible attempt at being subtle.  "There was an announcement?"
"You're welcome," Cas answers with a faint smile, squeezing his ankle.  Dean struggles for some kind of reaction to being blatantly manipulated that isn't 'kind of likes it' and fails miserably. "I've been trying to think of an appropriate way to encourage your interaction since he and Vera returned from Alpha, and today's conversation gave me opportunity and subject matter without undue effort or awkwardness in manufacturing a believable situation."
So they move away a little bit. "Congratulations! You will see, I will be the coolest uncle this child will have, possibly they will like me more… And without wanting to offend, Sam, but I hope they look more like Eileen… ”
Dean lowers his eyes for a brief moment, then makes a decision and puts his hand on Cas' shoulder. He needs to be firm, honest, because he can't take any more to leave things unresolved.
Mia speaks while trying to be didactic, but she emphasizes the terms that sound like offensives spoken by hunters' mouths.
Dean tries to make a serious face, frowning. Cas nods in response. Dean then smiles and turns his body to the rest of the room.
Two days ago, when Charlie arrived at the Bunker, Castiel was nervous. He never met her in person, but he heard the stories through Sam and Dean… Dean had mentioned she was like the little sister they never had, and she looked like someone formidable. Castiel knows that someone the Winchesters choose to trust and call family is someone he already feels inclined to do the same for.
And all these realizations shudder inside Castiel, every time he sees Dean in full... Because when Castiel put his hand on Dean for the first time, he found the path to salvation he didn't know he needed… It was as if all the rebellion he had tried in the past, but forgotten, had burned away inside him, looking to Dean as the only door to break free… Every other time he disobeyed, there was no one he could look to and find out the rest of the path, no one to reassure him that he could do it right when everyone else saw him as wrong...And maybe all the lost and buried memories, reprogrammed, in Castiel's subconscious, they all found where to look at once, and chose to watch Dean Winchester, to follow him... Maybe that's why he couldn't stop doing it, because if he deciphered Dean, he would decipher himself, his will finding the strength that only that human could carry forward... Castiel burned as he touched Dean, awakening in his old skin, but with a new heart. That, no angel can cut from him... Not Naomi, not Ishim, Lucifer, Metatron or Raphael... What Dean means to him, the change that took place is irrevocable and irreversible, because it came from someone Castiel was already and it had only expanded who he could be... Loving Dean Winchester and choosing him was Castiel's way of rebelling, it was his way of becoming who he is…
Dean asks defensively, unsure if his face is giving in to what he doesn't want to think about at the moment.
Castiel stops for a second and stares at her. So far, he hasn't had the time or opportunity to put into words what it's been like these past few weeks. He talked a bit with Dean and Sam, but he didn't want to overwhelm them when they're still looking for a way to deal with the fallen angels and Castiel feels so useless for this new phase they're going to face.
Dean moves forward wanting to touch the black spot, wanting to immerse himself in it with that ‘give em' hell attitude’ he has that made him end up in hell a few times.
“That wouldn’t change anything” Sam said. He was very scared. Not about himself, Dean, Jack or Cas, but about Gabriel. Gabriel was too childish and could do stupid mistakes. Those mistakes can hurt him and Sam was scared of that.
Dean’s reflexes got the gun from under his pillow and pointed it at Castiel. Well, he hadn’t realized that that was Cas in front of him.
He had to thank Gabriel. He suggested it in the first place. He had also suggested that car museum. But that could come later.
Sam had tried to make Gabriel feel better. When Gabriel couldn’t sleep, Sam sat down in a chair his room, calmly talking him to sleep.
“Then tell me” Gabriel moved closer to Sam. He still had his towel on his hips and didn’t care if it fell “how do I tell your mother that I’m so in love with you?”
So Gabriel mentions this Friend he had back in Heaven and since I offically decided to make this fic a series, I think I should mention that this character is from a different TV show/book and won't be seen in this story (that's unless Idecide to write a little epilogue). If you can guess who he is, leave a comment if you'd like
Why was Dean bothering about that anyway? So what? Death was dead, ironically. And pizza had nothing to do with that.
In Dean’s opinion, no, it was a terrible idea. Gabriel already got himself hurt multiple times and a case could also be very dangerous. But what Sam said was right to. He wasn’t getting enough sleep and was doing non-stop research. He did need to stop and lift his head.
FYI the statue scene is not my idea. I saw that think on a post in Pinterest and loved it and decided to add that in here.
The diary had a leather cover and its paper underneath looked very fragile, as if it would crumble with a touch.
“Game of Thrones” Sam said “I also read the books too. Shame the last season was only on TV and not a book”
Gabriel was very nervous. His heart was racing and blood was running is his veins. He looked at Sam. The hunter’s face calmed him a bit and Gabriel took his hand “We’re together” he said.
“Well, look at who decided to join the party!” the archangel said with that stupid grin on his face.
He had just realized that he didn’t know. He hadn’t known that they left because he was too busy researching.
The second was more complicated. He hadn’t seen Libriel in ageeess and Libs didn’t know who Sam was and may get scared or try to attack. Who knew what the guy had been through? Maybe nothing significant, maybe everything at the same time. Gabriel was the angel Libs knew. He would be the angel he would speak to.
even understood the principles of Quantum Physics. But what they both didn’t know, was that they both liked to see each other smile, that they both felt safer in each other’s presence (mostly Gabriel because of his past traumatic experience with Asmodeus), that they would do anything for each other, even die if their relationship strengthens (Gabriel had sort of already done that once anyway). They both cared about each other.
The credits started rolling and they were about to get up and leave but Jack told them otherwise and told them that there were two extra scenes after the credits.
He was scared of what he was about to do but he knew that he could trust Sam. Sam wouldn’t let his secret slip if Dean didn’t want it to.
Sam actually knew that Gabriel probably wouldn’t do that. He was too confident for that. But he told him anyway, with the slight hope that he would listen
“Then I gotta catch up” Sam said “I think I last watched some episodes of the first season when I was in college”
Gabriel bit his upper lip. He was nervous about coming out to Dean, Cas and Jack. He had actually forgotten about Mary until today when he saw him again.
Dean was impressed. Cas had told that very fluently without stopping. He had become very good at this.
Gabriel pulled away again. He needed to breathe. Sam’s enormous body had enormous lungs so he could hold his breath for longer. But not Gabriel.
Gabriel and Castiel left the warehouse and got in the Impala which was still parked where they left it.
The Group all got themselves a bed. Sam and Dean took the left set whilst Jack and Gabriel took the right. Castiel took the couch since he didn’t really need sleep but only needed to sit down on occasion to blend in.
“Angels” Gabriel said quite loudly “I mean Cas is. I used to be and Jack is a Nephilim. That means half-angel by the way”
“Nebraska is one of the states with the least light pollution” Gabriel said “That means it is good for watching the stars. It would’ve been better if we were more north-west, it's even less there, but this should do”
Dinner was nice. There were chicken wings and chicken wings were always nice. There was a place in the 12
Dean could use this hunt to investigate. He could pay attention to Cas and try to understand if he also felt the same way.
Sam looked at Gabriel. He clearly didn’t want to go today. Because he was …scared? Sam sighed. “I agree with him” he said pointing at Gabriel. “We already did enough today and we earn a break. Let’s do the rest tomorrow.”
Dean and Castiel were walking towards Mary’s room to tell her first, being Dean’s mother and all, but they first saw Sam and Gabriel.
“Basically, yeah” Sam said with a little nod. “Dean, please just trust me with this. You’ve been gone for a while now and this worked out well. If there are any major problems, we’ll fix them together” he promised.
He actually had a headache, probably because if the amount of alcohol he drank last night. But he didn’t care about that now
“One of us asks a general question about ourselves and both of us answers. It’s to know each other better”
“So, I hacked into the other girl’s phone to track her GPS, yeah.” Gabriel nodded “apparently, she also went to the church at least once a week”
Sam told the backseat passengers about the details of the case while Dean was too busy singing along to Bohemian Rhapsody.
Dean, Castiel and Jack were back in the café in less than 5 minutes. Dean and Jack still had their suits on. Castiel was in his normal outfit with his trenchcoat.
“No, no not here. I’m saying that we can say there is a gas leak in that house and say that we’re gonna fix it”
Dean introduced them, and Castiel told the same story. The Father nodded and clearly listened carefully.
It was around 9 when they decided to lie down instead of sit. There were no clouds and their eyes were able to see very clearly by then.
“Only how depressing life was” Gabriel said “It was better in Paris. The revolution made it even better”
Sam had told him about that. When someone needed help on a job they were on, they just called and Sam would send someone to help them out.
“Also, if you want to, I found us a case” Sam said as he walked to his computer and opened the newspaper article that he was looking at.
The church was big, with rows and rows of wooden seats, stone angel statues and those colored mirrors showing scenes from the Bible. Th roof was quite high up and had very good lightning. Every corner of the building was well-lit.
“So, question” Dean said “do you think should we tell the others like, Sam, Mary, Jack and Bobby and Gabe or should we keep it in between us for now?”
“Well too bad for you, your brother’s been there for the last 20 minutes” Gabriel said. He was tying his second shoe now.
The man tried to deny that there was a leak by saying that the line wasn’t in the house’s bio or that nobody had called them. Dean and Sam kept lying and finally he went inside to go get his wife out for Dean and Sam to ‘fix the leak’.
Sam asked the regular questions and at the end he asked ‘‘Are there anybody you could think of who would want to hurt Laura or William?’’
He mixed herbs, placed candles and drew on the floor next to his friend’s name. It was like an anti-summoning spell. You transported yourself to the said person instead of bringing them to yourself.
Good. They knew that Dean was in charge at the moment. Otherwise, there’ll be chaos and they would get wounded, or worse.
They all nodded and went back to what they were doing before. Sam followed Dean into Sam’s room and Dean shut the door.
Out of all of this, one bit stood out. At the end of the long writing were three words that Sam knew.
Dean didn’t understand. They were literally in the middle of nowhere. There was a massive field around them and that was it.
After the ‘trading stories’ part, Gabriel went back into his room and took a hot shower. He hadn’t expected seeing Sam sitting on his bed. “Oh” he said “hey”
Gabriel told Dean some directions and Dean drove. The place was on the same road as that vintage car museum but Gabriel told Dean to turn right instead of left.
They were all silent. No-one had any idea about what to say, because that was the best plan that any of them could think of right now.
He previously had some doubts about this but as it got darker and his eyes adjusted more, he could see why Gabriel wanted to do this.
Gabriel wasn’t doing anything when he was drinking his coffee. He was just staring at a wall in deep thoughts.
Gabriel was sleeping for the next couple of days. Ironically, he woke up the day that Dean!Michael killed Lucifer and Michael!Dean left. He then started his research of archangels.
“Also, Heaven is boring” Gabriel added “there is so much more you could do here on Earth. And these two,” he pointed his thumb at Dean and Sam “they are not
“I’m not shotgun” he simply said. Sam raised his eyebrows, impressed. Not everybody was brave enough to argue about the music when Dean was driving.
He couldn’t even see Cas or Mary or Jack until Jack walked from the back of the bunker and said “Dean”
“We came to Nebraska and there is one thing I always wanted to do in here. We can only do it in the night though”
Gabe went after Lucifer with Rowena, which took guts because last time Gabriel saw Lucifer, Lucifer stabbed him.
Sam put a hand through Gabriel’s hair, lightly and slowly massaging his scalp. Gabriel liked that. “Go on”
“Monopoly” the archangel answered “I like the look on people’s faces when they have to pay me a high rent” Sam chuckled “You?”
There were a lot of boxes and Gabriel carried all of them and sat down on the floor and opened the spell book he found.
Dean knew that it was probably making him look like a bitch. Treating Jack and Cas as incompetent children
“I was 12. Dad didn’t let me go when I was younger. So, yes, I did go to bed at bout 9 because I was a kid. You are not a kid but it’s your first hunt so you shouldn’t stay awake until 1 am or something”
The nun (Sister Melisa) joined her hands in front of herself and kept her head low. “Yes, Father. I came out to have a drink and saw these three gentlemen. They were looking for you.”
Yeah, no shit. Cas was an angel with sick powers. But he was still scared about him. He could get hurt.
Those days were painful. To see an archangel, heaven’s most terrifying weapon, getting scared of the smallest thing like loud noises.
He patted Jack’s back and saw a trench coat pacing towards him. Cas. Castiel. His angel who ‘gripped him tight and raised him from perdition’.
“Dean, do you think there is something unusual with this case?” Castiel asked as they left the Café.
They got changed and Sam gave Gabriel a fake FBI badge that he had made. Special Agent Angus Young. AC/DC’ s solo guitarist. Dean was using names from Led Zeppelin all the time, why shouldn’t Sam use AC/DC?
.’  There wasn’t anything Gabriel could do to himself. It was either wait or beg Dad for Him to replace his grace. He wasn’t planning on doing that.
the time. He was trying to deny this but sometimes, he found himself thinking about Cas’s baby-blue eyes and his all-time confused face.
. Jack was visibly happy to see Dean again but something in his eyes were different, like all his hope and innocence was lost. This did bother Dean. Best take them both with.
Or Libriel maybe dead and all this research he had done was faulty. Gabriel prayed that that wouldn’t be the case.
“Oh yeah. He stopped writing for about 6 years but then A Dance with Dragons was out in 2011. They also started the TV series that year. Anyway, what’s yours?”
“So, he first agreed to help you, then he attacked you because you were gonna burn his diary?” Bobby asked, shocked.
“Dean would cut you if he knew, right?” Gabriel knew Dean Winchester. The guy was not a fan of modern music.
He folded his little letter and slid it under Sam/Gabriel’s door. It was about three in the morning and Sam wouldn’t see Gabriel in the bed next to him. At least he would get a letter.
I am sorry for probably freaking you out and I need you to know that I am fine and I’m just gonna go and see a friend. You can come in the next round, just not now. Anyway, please don’t try to follow me. I doubt you can.
“Yeah, let’s do that” Dean said “So you said there were two churches, right.” Both Sam and Gabriel nodded in agreement “Then, we’ll take one and you take the other. We’ll cover more ground that way”
“Uhhhh” Gabriel complained as he had a look at the stuff he had to carry. He sometimes really missed his angel mojo.
The Father walked towards them and then turned to the nun. “Sister Melisa, shouldn’t you be in the library, sorting out the books with Sister Gabriella?”
“Well everybody, if you wouldn’t mind, me and my little brother need to have a little chat” Dean said.
Sam saw that this subject made Gabriel uncomfortable so he changed it and kept playing their little game until they were both bored. Then they started doing something more active and a lot more fun.
It was about 5 to midnight. That meant that Gabriel and Castiel would have to go back to the warehouse and chat with that ghost.
“Yes, yes, you did” Sam said and took out his wallet. He took a 5-dollar bill and passed it to Gabriel.
It was. He thought that it was time to tell Sam about his Friend (at the time he was called Libriel but Gabriel was 99.999% sure that he changed it. Pretty much all of the fallen did), but not what he was going to do.
After their short breakfast, it was time to go to the warehouse and try to find clues. Or maybe even the ghost.
“Sorry. He’s new” Sam said “But yes. We know what happened to them but we think that those may be not suicides but serial murders instead.”
“I thought so too but she was found in this warehouse, half a mile away from house, without a note. Also did some digging, and get this, the same thing happened 4 times over the last decade. All teenagers, found in the same warehouse without notes. People leave notes when they kill themselves Dean.”
Later, when they were about to go through the rift but Michael caught up. Gabriel was about to sacrifice himself
He had declined the offer and the man took it nicely. Afterwards, he decided to give the group a little tour of the place. Dean asked questions and the man (Brad) answered them happily.
Gabriel looked back at his screen and started scrolling through the photos. There were usually photos of a girl with green eyes and straight, dark brown hair. She looked about 14.  That had to be Emma.
, Gabriel thought. He could pretend that this wasn’t the first time he went to a hunt, but he was just having lunch with friends. Unfortunately, that didn’t last long either.
He stood midway since a guy with lots of old papers in his hands just started staring at him with fear in his eyes. Oh yeah, they probably still thought he was Michael.
Sam looked at him and looked back inside. He was right. It was very nice and impressive with the candles hanging from the painted roof, and the biblical paintings and all.
But the reality was pretty much everybody they rescued walking around the bunker, hands full of books, papers and laptops.
Gabriel had to admit that he was not as chill as he looked. This ‘going to the warehouse and finding clues’ was his idea. But he never thought that it’d come to this.
He remembered how Cas looked at him when Dean was in danger or was going to do something dangerous that could risk his life. He remembered how Cas had reacted when that Metatron bitch had killed Dean.
“Yeah” Gabriel said “I read the diary and he had mood swings and had changed former decisions before”
to TV land and that idiotic Japanese show, becoming the Impala, being a doctor in Dean’s favorite TV show and being investigators and finally finding out who Gabriel really was; an archangel. Bu then came the night at that hotel full of Pagan gods and everything went downhill. Lucifer killed pretty much all the gods and also Gabriel (at least that’s what they believed at the time) and then they haven’t seen Gabriel for years, only to find him in the hands of Ketch.
Sam smiled. But this one was weak, not like the other ones he got when he was happy. It probably reminded him of a sad memory
The previous night, they decided that Dean and Sam should go to find that diary. Castiel, Jack and Gabriel would wait for them in the car a couple of blocks away.
“Alright then” Dean said and say down “For some reason, the ghost wants you” he looked at Gabriel “why is that anyway?”
was my idea” Gabriel whispered so only Sam could hear him. He didn’t care about Castiel’s inhuman/angelic senses.
“Well, I was thinking about our relation and since we both have the same father, we may be brothers too. But I think half-brother sounds better, don’t you think? I don’t want to be reminded that I am related to that psychopath.”
Dean entered the Bunker with Sam. Oh, how he missed this place.  It was his only stable home (except from his Impala) since he was 4 years old. And he shared it with people he loved, like Sam or Cas or Jack, and now Gabriel was also going to join, probably.
I honelty loved writing this story and as I said before, its's going to be a series with Good Omens added (maybe something else too? Hmmm) the next one is going to be called 'Two Angels and a Demon' so look out for it.
Sam took a few steps towards Gabriel. Gabriel could hear his heart bumping against his chest. It felt like it was trying to get out.
“Well, then you must know that there are different views when it comes to suicide. Some argue that it is not a sin, and some, including me, in my opinion, argue that it is a sin to end your own life. I really liked those two young people. They did remind me of me when I was younger.”
“Yes” Jack said as he straightened his black suit and blue tie, just like Cas’s. As they say, like father like son.
“Can you find the church that they all went to. Maybe it is more about the place rather that the belief” Gabriel said. Just then, the waiter brought their coffee. Gabriel added two spoons of sugar and took a sip.
He picked some of the boxes and carried them to the dungeon part of the dungeon from the library part. He would be able to do the spell safely without interruptions there.
But Dean couldn’t make a move. What if Castiel didn’t like him back? Then their whole relationship would break and Dean wouldn’t be able to see Castiel again. The angel would probably just ignore him. Dean was too scared.
. Then Jack came along and both Dean and Sam kind of adopted him whilst Jack already believed that Castiel was his father. It wasn’t that hard to get used to Jack.
Dean was surprised. He expected a different reaction from his brother. But Sam was acting as if he knew it all along.
“Exactly my point” Dean looked Cas in the eye then his eyes fell down to Cas’s lips. His heart started racing and he liked that. But his brain caught up and looked back at Cas’s eyes. He then took a step back.
There were also all those times when Cas invaded Dean’s personal space. He thought that that was because of Cas not knowing about human things but maybe it was because he had liked Dean and was constantly trying to show it.
Sam managed to catch up to the things that were happening. “Dude, you have a Queen tape?” Sam had never heard Dean play Queen before, he would say that most the songs were not rocky enough for his taste.
there are three things I would like to say 1) this chapter was quite hard to write since I had never have to do something like this before, so excuse the bad bits 2)the story actually fits in with the canon (except from the ships) so that is where it is going 3) *deep Darth Vader voice* the awkwardness is strong in this one
The group kept staring at the sky whilst Gabriel told them random facts about space and named consolation, stars and even some galaxies. They all listened and left the field sometime near midnight.
It was absurd! Why was everyone still here when they could’ve left and had a normal life! Dean definitely would’ve done so if he was one of these people.
“I had a brief look but I think it’s mostly about archangel graces and alternate universes. Dean he lost his grace
. It was mostly about what the kids did but overall, the teenagers were happily living their life. Until Mister Ghosty paid them a visit.
“Time was all jumbled up. They could have a look at the future to see what humanity would need. Or just use it for simple things like good music. Honestly, Heaven’s idea of ‘good music’” Gabriel did air quotes “is just harmonies and choirs. And no instruments. It’s really boring”
Dean ran his hands on the leather of his beloved car. He missed her and was very relieved that Sam hadn’t done anything to her, since the first time he died, he connected and iPod. A fucking iPod! Dean didn’t like iPods. Even though they were practical, there was something different with them and cassettes.
“I mean c’mon!” Gabriel said “We are 3 supernatural beings and 2 life-long experienced hunters. What’s the worst that can happen?”
Castiel was unsure about the previous night. Had it actually happened? Or maybe Dean was too drunk and didn’t have a clear head?
“Yes and I actually got a romantic idea in my mind. Also, so that your and my idiot brothers can admit their feeling to each other”
Sam and Gabriel didn’t say anything. The guy probably believed that they went to hell because their death looked like a suicide. He must have really cared about them.
. Except from the part that they had no guarantee that they’ll be able to find anything about the ghost, and also, they’ll probably be in extreme danger if the ghost was there.
The wallpaper was acceptable. It was a nice calming blue color with some occasional darker blue circles. Way better than those outrageous cheap motel wallpapers that Gabriel has seen the Winchesters in.
Dean couldn’t argue with that. Sam was his brother and if he didn’t want to go now, Dean wouldn’t force him.
It didn’t take Gabriel long to finish his coffee. Only two minutes. In that two minutes, Sam had paid the bill and got his and Gabriel’s stuff packed.
Sam could relate. He didn’t really like suits either. Mostly because they were either a bit too small for his ginormous size or because they just fit perfectly and made it hard for him to freely move his arms without ripping the fabric. But he did like the way that they looked.
“Didn’t you live through it?” Dean asked. He thought that Gabriel never went back to Heaven after he left.
Mary was quite for a couple of second. “Oh” she said “how nice of you two to finally admit your feelings”
“Thank you. Please return back to you post” the man’s voice was strict, and it was clear that he gave on order. But it was also kind, in a way.
Sam sighed again. Gabriel was determined that this was the only way and he would also come. There was no going back now.
They all went in the Impala and Dean started the engine. The engine’s familiar growl relaxed Dean a little bit. He hadn’t even realized that his muscles were pulled, ready to attack if needed to.
But the tables and chairs were black wood. It went really well together, black and gold. The designer of the place must be proud of themselves
“Yeah, it is” Dean explained “Think of it as-” Okay what can be a good comparison for their situation? “think of it as seeing me and Sam in a Shakespearean painting, standing next to the first Queen Elizabeth.”
Gabriel hadn’t realized how much time had passed. It was already 1:30 and they were done with the hunt. He had a promise to keep to Sam.
They drove to the warehouse and Dean parked the Impala near the entrance and got out of the car. The others followed. He took out shotguns and handed them to Sam. Gabriel came from the other side and Dean gave the salt to him.
He wen after Loki and his children; Fenris, Sleipnir and Jormungand. He then got stabbed and if Sam and Dean weren’t there, God knew what would’ve happened. But Gabe wasn’t going to stop until he got his revenge from Loki so Dean and Sam helped him out. But then the whole thing with Lucifer and Apocalypse world came.
Dean was going to answer that but Castiel spoke first “We had also thought of the same thing. But found out that three other teenagers had died the same way in the last 10 years. I think another one of the victims had also used to come here, Alex Dis. Maybe you’ve heard of him.”
He patted Jack one more time and walked towards Cas. He didn’t care about his brother’s eye roll and hugged Cas tightly around his arms. He let Cas’s scent travel through his nose and took it in. The angel’s smell was hard to describe because there were too many things he smelled at the same time, but Dean could make out some bits like honey (probably because Cas’s obsession with bees), that unwashed coat (seriously, he needed to wash that thing) and pie (though Dean may be imagining that one)
Dean didn’t want to do that though. They were already five people which was three more than what Dean was used to for his entire life. It was always him and Dad until Dad was gone which it then became him and Sam. He was still got used to having Cas around. That was very unusual to him at first but he went along with it and it turned out fine
Gabriel remembered what he read. Matt had many sudden mood changes and had frequently changed his former decisions.
“Pooo-op corn seller in a movie theater” Gabriel said. He was about to say pornstar but decided against it. There was a time and a place and this was not it.
Dean smiled. Damn he missed that kid. He was like a son to him just like how Ben felt like his son too even though Lisa claimed that he wasn’t.
Even after Gabriel’s great attempts at covering himself up, Sam got what he was going to say originally.
Gabriel sighed again “Remember how you said Crowley had literally remade Nick’s body to contain and control Lucifer inside” they all nodded “Well you gotta adjust it a bit to the devil for it to contain the devil”
“I don’t remember my first crush, even if it was a crush. But what I do remember, is my first friend.”
Dean left Sam’s room and walked towards Cas’s. He had a gut feeling that both Cas and Jack were going to be there. He was right.
“Wow. That is-“ Sam couldn’t find a good word to describe the situation Gabriel was in. He wasn’t even sure if such a word existed.
Did you like my little trashy haiku? I've been reading the Trials of Apollo and got brainwashed by Apollo's magestic poetry skills.
“Make sure to tell Donna to keep an eye on him” if Gabriel knew anything about his brother, it would be that you couldn’t keep him locked up for long. The cage couldn’t, neither could Crowley or Michael.
But Dean didn’t go to the kitchen. He went into his room’s bathroom and splashed water on his face and looked up to the mirror.
Gabriel kept scrolling. More photos of her and her family, and another girl. This one had blonde hair and gray eyes. She wasn’t her sister, they looked nothing alike, but they looked quite close. A good friend then, or maybe more.
Dean looked through the dates on the pages. 1814, 1817 and the latest was 8 September 1821. That must’ve been around the time that Mathew had died.
Here's the next chapter. Also, remember how I said that I literally started writing this fic because of one (1) scene? Yh that scene is here. Hopefully, you'll find it funny.
Gabriel went back to the dungeon and he lit all the candles, got the spell book (he didn’t want Sam to find and cast the spell he did) and stood in the middle of the circle.
“What happened to him?” Sam asked. This story was very good so far. But happy beginnings didn’t always have happy endings.
Castiel took a step and closed the little gap between them. Their chests were now touching and Dean moved his left hand to Castiel’s head and was caressing his hair.
He couldn’t risk it. Either for Sam or for his friend. So, he decided to do this alone. Though he could use some help at the time.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m not defending him. I just understand him and treated him like a human being rather than a monster” Gabriel said “It was also just to get him to co-operate” he added.
“Yeah” he admitted “I have no idea how to do this shit and I am fucking terrified.” Gabriel said and threw his shirt somewhere near his tie.
Jack was a step ahead of them. He had already grabbed Dean’s lighter when all this was happening and was running towards the diary.
Except from that occasion in the Supernatural convention when the mother ghost was trying to warn Dean and Sam about the children. But that was only once
Dean had mixed feelings about Gabriel. He hated him for a while, especially when he repeatedly killed Dean jut to annoy Sam. He also hated the TV land the he created
and Special Agent Plant. We’re hear about the tragic death of Emma Smith and would like to speak with the priest.”
“It’s the place where everything was designed. Basically, a department full of blue prints” Gabriel explained “Some of the things went to higher class of angels to be made, like Earth, but most were designed and made in there.”
This bit was what was familiar to Gabriel. He had done a lot of research for the last couple of weeks in the Bunker. He opened his laptop and opened a Google tab.
“You’re not saying anything about us but talking about the bet that you lost” Dean said. He expected a reaction from Gabriel. Not Sam, he had already told Sam about his crush but Gabriel wasn’t supposed to know. Sam hadn’t told him anything, right?
“Mr. Peck?” Dean said “My name is Dean Johnson and this is my colleague, Sam Jackson. We were sent here by the state government ‘cause there is a carbon monoxide leak in one of the main lines which happened to be right under your house”
The reality hit Sam like a truck. Gabriel was writing to his Father, God, Chuck. Did Gabriel believe that he could actually contact Chuck?
Matt must’ve really cared about the notebook. He had poured his heart out and wrote down secrets. Gabriel felt like a spy reading about someone’s personal life.
Mathew gave them an address. It was only a couple of blocks away but there was someone living in there these days. They’d have to find a way to get in.
“Hey” he said “I am Gabriel. And yes, me, Cassie and Jack here aren’t exactly human. I mean Jack half is but anyway.”
Except from the part that nobody (except Jack) understood the backstory and therefore had some confusions about the main story, the movie was good overall.
, which was pretty similar to what Sam and Gabe had told. The children were happily living their lives, minding their own business. Again, until they decided to come out of that closet.
Sam knocked the door and they both got their fake ID cards out. This time, they were two plumbers from the government.
“I was like that in my first hunt” Sam said as he put his hands around Gabriel’s shirtless waist. Gabriel put his hands on top of Sam’s.
ps. i was very determined to post this WAAAY too long chapter tonight and i couldn't do much editing (I dont usually do that much anyway) so if you spot any spellin errors or bits that dosen't make sense, shout me a comment and i'll fix it
Sam turned his computer towards Gabriel. William Custol’s Instagram account was open. Sam showed Gabriel a photo that he shared. It was a photo of a guy with a bit long light brown hair, just like Gabriel’s. The kid also had a cross earing. Another believer.
He was impressed. The guy knew how to write. His life had been a mess but he managed to make it seem exciting by those writing skills. They had amazing descriptions which clearly showed the mood he was in.
They had literally done this 5 minutes ago, but both wanted to do it for a long time now. For Gabriel, it was about since he got kidnapped and got sold to Asmodeus.
Gabriel didn’t like getting bossed around but he agreed and waited until Dean, Castiel and Jack had left and turned to Sam and took his jacket off.
But he couldn’t do that with Cas. He’s known him for too long. He can’t do the same thing. He had to make sure that Cas likes him back. That’s the only way Dean could and might make a move.
Sam explained them about what they did in more detail and they listened. Simultaneously with Sam, Gabriel also showed them some of the pictures as if they wouldn’t believe what Sam was saying
Dean moved the lighter near a piece of paper sticking out of the book but was thrown back. The lighter fell to the floor.
