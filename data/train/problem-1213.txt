The Captain shoved a brown paper bag, which obviously contained his pre-packed lunch into Sherlock’s arms. “I’m leaving you in Major Jones capable hands. I don’t want to see you again until next week when you’re ready to put some real effort into training. And for god’s sake, eat!” Watson snapped and closed the Officer’s door behind him.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He greeted back, “You know I knew you weren’t a real cadet the moment you walked onto the field. No one in their right mind with a military kink as strong as yours would be stupid enough to try to enlist. You could barely function.”
“Urrrrrhhh.” John gurgled. That must have been Sherlock, no one else would force him out of a medicated sleep just to tell him he needed help with his experiments. The world was fading again, he was tired his body felt heavy and the pain was going away.
“Another, god Sherlock.” John groaned, the muscles in his stomach tensing and relaxing in a sensual wave as he rocked back on his fingers. “You feel so good inside me. I want to cum on your cock, sweetheart.”
“Nope, I don’t want you out of my arms for the next twelve hours at least, so this is the best solution. Up we go!” John chuckled and began to climb the stairs, his hands slid down from Sherlock’s hips to pat, group and squeeze Sherlock arse.
“Sher’ock…” John grumbled, rolled over and grabbed Sherlock’s still ringing phone and shoved it into the detective’s hand. “Answer.”
“Mr Holmes I believe?” The man said with a thin smile. “Your brother, told me to expect you this morning. My name is Major Taylor Jones. Welcome to London University.”
That was over an hour ago now, and they’d somehow made it into their shared bedroom. They hadn’t ended up needing the one upstairs after all. Sherlock was spread out on the mattress, legs splayed wide, pulled up to his chin as John fucked him open with his hands.
Sherlock sat up and looked over to the muggle man who had until his unwanted arrival been sitting down to a full English breakfast.
The Captains hands moved away and he walked back up so he was bending down to look at Sherlock’s face. Sherlock was so involved in pushing himself up and down that he didn’t see the smirk on the Captain’s face. Watson leaned down and blew hot breath over the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Sherlock didn’t need telling twice, he rocked himself back and forth lifting himself up and down, shifting so John's cock would strike his prostate on every thrust. John helped by gripping the slim man's waist and thrusting up into Sherlock’s arse as he dropped down.
“I can be warmer, do you want my hot, wet fingers inside you sweetheart?” John groaned, Sherlock, pushed his hips down and rubbed his cock into John’s tummy.
The panel had what looked like several climate control features, one digital panel displayed the temperature, humidity and oxygen levels currently inside the cell. Perhaps Moriarty had some priceless artwork or archaeological items hidden away in a controlled environment? Sherlock blinked in confusion at the numbers as he read them: 93% humidity, 15% oxygen, 5ºC. Those were certainly not ideal conditions to keep antiquities under.
“He wasn’t a very nice man…” John shrugs and unconsciously leans into Sherlock warmth. His coat must be magic too, it radiates warmth and it’s very cold out on the street tonight. John can see their breath misting in front of him, mixing in the air between them.
Mr Amberley chose this moment to let out a rather pathetic whimper of pain and sadness. Mr Blue Scarf considered the criminal for a moment before sighing disdainfully into his smartphone. “You should invest in a futon, Lestrade. Your wife has found other uses for your marital bed. Again. Perhaps an ambulance should also be arranged as we may have broken Mr Amberley.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. The door on his right opened and Anthea strode in, her head perpetually bent down looking at her phone.
John watched Sherlock’s pert bottom sway left and right as he used each step of the ladder. “I have to say, Sherlock. I’m enjoying the view.”
“I remember.” John met Sherlock’s eyes, and it was almost impossible for John to hold himself back from leaning forward to kiss the madman. “I promise, always your way.”
“Oh yeah!” John shrugged, “I have a few pets actually. My sister calls my place the Watson Menagerie on account of how many animals I’ve collected over the years. Billy the goat, Samantha my sixteen-year-old tabby, Elvis, Prince, Elton and Bowie my rainbow lorikeets, Spot my old heifer and my two dogs Captain Barks and George.” Sherlock just stared. “Oh! And between twenty and eighty thousands bees. They don’t respond well to the sit command so it’s a bit hard to count them all!”
Would it be wise to pursue something with Johno? He’d never engaged in sex or a relationship during a case. Not once. But here he was, on the other side of the world, in a saltwater crocodile enclosure, chicken blood dripping from his fingers and having the time of his life with the most intriguing man he’d ever met.
“It’s okay, I understand why you didn’t tell me.” Sherlock stepped closer, their chests pressed together.
Without warning Captain Watson turned and continued running backwards, he was obviously inspecting the formation. He watched Sherlock run for a moment, Sherlock could feel his cheeks getting hot and turning red again. With a wink, the Captain jogged off to the side and slowed his pace so he could fall back. “Keep it up Cadets! I don’t want to see you break pace!”
“Oh. It’s you, again. Still garish and blue, I see. Why do you persist in being so tiny-minded and wrong? How tedious. It’s
Sherlock groaned. “Naked. Now.” He demanded, liquid fire rushing through his body. The desperate need to be with John, to touch every inch of his skin, to lick into his mouth and make him cum was overwhelming. He needed this, once more before he left.
“Now John!” Sherlock cried, launching himself at Rosamund. John wasted no time, the power coming easily to him now. It was always there just below the surface since his incarceration in the cold room. Fire leap from John’s hands and whooshed up the - apparently - highly flammable curtains. John twisted around, ducking as Ajay pulled the trigger and fired his gun up into the ceiling. With a swift kick, John swept Ajay’s legs out from under him and punched him soundly in the face. His nose cracked loudly on impact.
“Right, so I’m not calling out some other bloody guys name. I’m simply saying in my muggle way, your mouth is fantastic and I can’t think clearly enough to say anything meaningful. Just curse.”
John’s body had also probably not orgasmed this much since he was a teenager. Sherlock had run every kind of self-pleasure experiment he could think of. He knew every hot spot, every twist of the wrist that would make John Watson’s body hurl itself to completion. Sherlock was 99% sure that once they swapped back into their bodies and John finally got over his insecurities about being in a same sex relationship that Sherlock would be able to give John the best orgasm of his life.
Captain Barks had taken that very moment to launch himself at Sherlock, knocking him over and licking his face. George pranced about excitedly barking, trying to get between Sherlock and Cap so he too could snuggle and lick him.
“Not that I’ve been made aware of. It would seem congratulations are in order. This makes five successful solo missions, Sherlock. Are you sure you won’t consider taking on a more permanent role?”
“Just a few corrupt Barristers. There were a few leftover cells in Pentonville I thought could use some new tenants.”
John couldn’t stop the chuckle, “Hope you like you’re not adverse to partners that are a bit smoked?”
John held his erection up and rubbed it over Sherlock’s loosened hole. It caught on the edge, making both men moan before slipping inside. Sherlock pressed himself down slowly until his arse was flush with John’s groin.
John was right behind him, he growled into Sherlock's ear giving himself one final rough pull and then Sherlock could feel the hot splatters of cum pulse over his stomach and cock. Their combined cum pooling between them and soaking their pants.
Sherlock placed his hand on John’s cheek, “I’m real, you’re safe. You’re here, with me.” John nodded, his eyes looking cloudy with tears. “We need lube if you are to penetrate me.”
“Hurry up and put your penis into my anus now or I swear to Merlin I will hex you!” Sherlock growls when John pulls away to adjust himself.
Sherlock keened loudly as John’s cock head dragged against his prostate. “Fuck! Ten! Fuck! Eleven! Captain!”
The uniform had already been delivered by the time Sherlock made it back to 221B. One of Mycroft’s minions had actually laid it out on his bed. Standard army camo fatigues, including belt, boots and hat. Sherlock just stood in his bedroom doorway for several minutes staring at the uniform before he felt ready to approach it.
John watched in awe as Mr Blue Scarf, now finished with his phone bent down and lifted Mr Amberley without any apparent effort off of John. “Are you alright?” He asked.
“Keep those hips down Cadet, I don’t want to see you lifting your arse above your shoulders!” The Captain turned to look down over Sherlock’s posture.
There is a soft touch to his shoulder and Sherlock looks up into dark blue eyes. It’s John. The John he constructed as a companion in his mind. He’s wearing his burgundy jacket open, checkered shirt underneath.
The Captain crouched down beside Sherlock’s head, “That wasn’t twenty, Cadet. I didn’t tell you to stop.” his voice wasn’t loud and shouting anymore. It was deep and rough.
John just stared at him for a moment. Sherlock could see his eyes growing dark with arousal. “I need to make you blush more often.” John said, causing Sherlock’s blush to darken further.
“Ah!” Sherlock gasped, his movements slowing down, he dropped down onto John’s cock and ground down. Pressing the head of John’s cock into his prostate. “FF-F-
Both men quickly shucked off their clothes, letting them fall to the kitchen floor around them. Hands reached out stroking and touching each other. John pinched one of Sherlock’s nipples and moaned in response to Sherlock’s full body shiver. Sherlock couldn’t hold back anymore, the way John and he were pressing their now naked bodies together. Their height difference making it a little awkward, preventing Sherlock from pressing his cock against John’s. In frustration Sherlock returned the favour from yesterday and bent, signalling to John that he wanted him to lift up onto the kitchen bench.
“I’ve missed something, haven’t I?” John asked, staring at the naked woman standing in front of his boyfriend.
It didn’t take very long for Sherlock to pant heavily that he was ready, with another squirt of lube John’s cock was slicked and ready. The two shifted into a more comfortable position on the bed, Sherlock lifted himself up over John’s cock and began to lower himself down.
John blinks stupidly at Sherlock for a moment before he bursts out laughing. “You-hahaha-You don’t know-bloody-hehe-
Johno’s hand was warm. Sherlock tried to force his mind to focus, he could see the blood stain from where he was standing. On the far side, just at the edge of the grass. The ground was still a muddy red colour from where Moran had been eaten alive.
Sherlock cupped his hands around the cigarette in his mouth, while he’d been inside the cabin with John a strong wind had started up. Using his hands and a wind break Sherlock managed to light his cigarette and took a long drag on it. The warm smoke tickled his throat and filled his lungs, sighing happily Sherlock enjoyed the feeling of scratching that particular itch. With a flick of his wrist, Sherlock returned his lighter to his pocket and turned away from the wind.
“I-I think so too.” Sherlock pulled another tissue out of the box Mrs Hudson had placed in front of him, blowing his nose. “But I can’t give up London.”
Mrs Hudson began stroking his hair softly, “What’s happened?” Sherlock shuddered, finally losing the battle and letting the tears fall. “Oh, Sherlock.”
“Indeed you are John, and not in the way people normally get inside each other.” Sherlock winked at John. He’d start as he means to go on. Maximum flirting, maximum innuendo. John would be blind and deaf to miss Sherlock’s advances now.
The stairs were the same dull grey, unpainted concrete as the rest of the building. Sherlock was glad to see the string of exposed light globes lining the ceiling as it sloped downwards into the mountain. The door clicked shut behind him with a high echoing sound. He paused for a moment to listen, aware the sound may draw the attention of any dim-witted guards who may be nearby.
The minty flavour burst to life on his tongue, the feeling of the bristles rubbing over his teeth was beyond anything he’d ever felt. John moaned happily when he moved to brush the other side of his mouth, his tongue running over the side he’d just cleaned. His teeth felt smooth! He’d forgotten how amazing it felt to have clean teeth.
“And you invaded Afghanistan.” They both roared with a new wave of laughter, Sherlock grinned and held out his hand. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes.”
The world came crashing back to John violently. He gasped and flinched as pain spiked across his body. Everything hurt, he couldn’t breath. Something was in his mouth. Panic.
Sherlock sighed heavily, his breath misting densely in the freezing air. Now wasn’t the time to relive that particular conversation with his brother. It was the reason why he was currently freezing his balls off high up in the mountains of the Alps, but it wouldn’t help him now. Pulling his heavy cloak about him tighter, Sherlock refocused and began to make his way along the wall of the remote featureless concrete facility. His goal was to find the back entrance and make his way down to the basement.
Loony Desperado broke into Pentonville Prison wreaking chaos and destruction while assisting in the escape attempts of several prisoners. There seemed to be a madness to the method as various convicted rapists, murderers and thieves walked out unimpeded while other prisoners screamed for assistance from their cells. Loony Desperado walked past these cells with nary a backwards glance.
“I warned you.” Sherlock growled, “I said, let him go. Or I’ll kill you. You have chosen death, and I will give it to you.” The air elemental looked down at the gun in his hands, then threw it into the circling vortex of wind. It was carried, like magic through the storm to smash with tremendous force into John’s glass prison, shattering it and carrying the glass safely away from John.
John needed to find another hiding place, he pressed down on the man’s leg more firmly as he glanced down at his patient. The man’s eyes were blank, staring up at the blue, cloudless sky, John hadn’t been fast enough. It took more effort than John would like to admit to stop pressing onto the man’s leg. It was useless now, John’s skills would be needed elsewhere, he needed to focus.
Sherlock groaned, the tingles shooting up and down his spine were just annoying him today. He really wasn’t looking forward to another day running around and trying not to collapse into a puddle of goo at Captain Watson’s feet. He had a criminal to catch.
“You like my mouth, don’t you John?” Sherlock teased, using John’s own words against him. “I’ve seen you look, stare really. You can’t take your eyes off them when I talk. You’re obsessed.”
But that wasn’t right anymore, he had John now. John Watson, the most confusing man he’d ever met. From his scarred body to his glowing eyes. Sherlock wasn’t sure what to think of him, and yet his libido had obviously been kicked up into high gear. If Sherlock was the sort of man to fuck and run he would. A passion filled night with the ex-soldier before he went off to defeat Moriarty in a blaze or glory.
“Yes.” Sherlock gasped out, John’s hand still pumping his erection. “Please, oh god. I want you to cum on me. Please, John.” He begged.
The splash of icy water over Sherlock's face helped to calm his racing mind, he could feel the anxiety and panic building. Everything was moving too fast, John was everything he could have dreamed about in a partner but there was one problem: John belonged here, and Sherlock belonged in London.
John and Sherlock had been tracking down one of Moriarty’s goons. They hadn’t realised he was a wizard too until too late. Sherlock had shoved John to the ground the moment their attacker had spun around, wand drawn.
“Damn, so tight! God you’re so greedy I can feel you pulling my fingers deeper inside you. Fuck, I can’t wait. Sherlock please? I need to be inside you.” John couldn’t watch Sherlock wriggle and pant anymore or he was going to explode.
“I suppose. It’s already proving more tedious than I expected. The building is really no longer up to code and at the end of the day, I’ve probably done everyone a favour just by doing this much. Dinner?”
“Everything has been arranged, Sir,” She said, stepping to the side of the door and waiting for her master's call. If only Mycroft’s stupid agent last week had been so well trained.
With a deep breath Sherlock steeled himself and pulled up the hospital gown. “John Watson you sneaky bastard.” He cursed under his breath. Sherlock had known from the moment he watched John walk that he’d been well endowed, but he’d severely underestimated.
Sherlock reached for the folder with the sugar tongs, taking it from his brothers grasp like it was some infected or dirty thing he didn’t want to touch. “You’re seriously sending me to Australia? Like some convict?”
“We’re being picked off, at this rate, we’ll all be dead. Just shut up and do as I say! That’s an order!”
It took three months for Mycroft to track down Rosamund Moran for them. She was currently staying in Berlin in preparation to attend a political Gala where several very important dignitaries would be. Mycroft suspected Moriarty had instructed the Assassin to kill off the favourite candidate to be voted in during France’s presidential election next month. It was Sherlock and John’s job to stop Miss Moran.
One of Johno’s eyebrows had lifted at Sherlock’s admission, “I’ll call you whatever you like.” he winked. “Tell me then, when do you knock off,
John had to grit his teeth to stop from laughing, for someone who accused everyone they met of being an idiot, Desperado was woefully incorrect. “Fellow Hero? Not likely. You’re Supervillain Loony Desperado. I would happily give your real name to all the media outlets and newspapers of Britain if I thought it would stop you.”
“Hello, darling! Calling in big brother for help? Too bad, so sad.” Moriarty laughed. “I’m afraid he’s not available. In fact, he’s a little tied up at the moment. What do you think Sherlock? Let me know after the beep. Will he sink or swim?”
It was everything Sherlock could have ever wanted. A warm home, the sound of paws clicking around as George continued to follow his master, the wuffing of Captain Barks as he chased something in dreamland, the vibrating purr of Samantha in his lap, and the wonderful engaging conversation with John as they learnt all there was to know about the other.
It felt like he’d been shot in his other shoulder. “I’m sorry I woke you but I had to be sure. When you’re better we have some experiments to run.”
“Sherlock, that’s my body. I know when it’s had a shag, or in this case a wank I ‘spose. So did you?” John grinned.
John had to be dreaming, it was the only explanation for the sequence of events over the last twelve hours. He’d not just told Sherlock about his powers, he’d given him a front row seat to the absolute worst of it and instead of turning him in or running away in fear. Here Sherlock was rocking into him, rubbing his naked body against him and John was two fingers deep into his arse, preparing the gorgeous posh boy for his cock.
Prison overpopulation became less of an issue when innocent men were no longer incarcerated. Perhaps the events of today would sufficiently scare the Commissioner into walking a more righteous path. If not, there was still the stash of evidence back at 221B.
Turning to the left Sherlock continued making his way quietly into the biggest room, it was a laboratory not dissimilar to those he’d seen at Baskerville. The biggest difference Sherlock was quick to notice, being that almost eighty percent of the room was dominated by an enormous glass cell. The glass looked frosted, a highly opaque milky white that was impossible to see through.  There was a steel panel connected to one side of the cell, it’s red, blue, green and amber LED light’s blinking rhythmically.
John watched his tall saviour retreat outside, slipping on his heavy coat as he pressed the cabin door closed behind him. For a moment John just stood there, alone in the small room, without being watched. Without having to control his breathing, without having to channel energy through his body to keep warm. John wasn’t sure how long he’d been locked up, he’d need to ask Sherlock the date. He wanted to remember it, celebrate it in future like a birthday.
“Jones just spoke to me in the hallway he’s leaving for the airport, said his Mum who lives abroad just got diagnosed with cancer.”
It’s a picture that appears to be broadcasting in real time from a police helicopter for all of London to see - a man flying. With a screaming, swaying bundle of red-faced Police Commissioner dangling below him like so much garbage.
Sherlock helped John around the house, feeding all his animals. George, who turned out to be a cattle dog with boundless energy following John around like a shadow was a delight. Captain Barks had settled himself back on the couch, rolled over onto his back, legs in the air. Sherlock couldn’t help but chuckle at the Great Dane everytime he spotted him out of the corner of his eye.
“Fuck me.” John growled and it came out so low and deep that it actually started Sherlock. He didn’t know his voice could sound so, dragon-like. He’d have to try that out on John, later.
“Yes! John, right hand side, top draw. Hurry.” Sherlock shuddered and pulled his legs down so they rested against his chest.
. It had been this train of thought that had led to a quick online search and the purchase of a pirate’s hat, which now sat perched upon his curls (at a jaunty angle) with a red feather flapping in the breeze.
“Christ, Sherlock you need to fuck me,” John gasped, finally giving up on holding himself at the forty-five-degree angle he’d been leaning back at and falling with a slap against the wooden surface of the counter. “There…” John took a breath. “There is lube in the bathroom, second drawer down.”
Sherlock chuckles, he can feel something building in the air between them but he’s not sure what it means. “That’s true. He was a bad cabbie. Should have seen the route he took us to get here!” John loses the grip on his mirth and a giggle bursts forth from his lips. Sherlock wants to kiss him.
“Doctor.” Sherlock blurted. “Doctor Watson, yes I uhm… I find it helps me think. I was trying to remember what happened.”
Sherlock picked up the sugar cube tongs, playing with them, snapping them together between his fingers. “Cairo?”
“That’s Johno.” Azza said, slapping Sherlock good-naturedly on the back, “He’s our head Zookeeper for the reptiles. You’ll need to go to him if you want access to Acco’s enclosure. Now then, that’s enough dillydallying. Time to talk shop! The media have been swarming-”
“John! It’s going to be alright, I promise.” Sherlock took out his phone, “I’m calling Mycroft, just… Just don’t let her escape. And…” Sherlock put his phone to his ear, listening to the dial tone. He looked into John’s beautiful, sparkling eyes. He was amazing. The most amazing man Sherlock had ever met. “I-I-I won’t tell. John. You’re safe with me, please believe me.”
John was currently three fingers deep into Sherlock arse, both of them sweaty and panting. They’d just chased and caught a murder and had come home full of energy, adrenaline and ready to fuck each other into next week.
“Aguamenti! JOHN! Reducto!” John heard Sherlock calling him, and he yelled out that he was okay, a bit wet and battered now that Sherlock had basically hit him with the magical equivalent of a fire hose. But at least he wasn’t on fire anymore.
Sherlock did sleep in the guest room that night, but he wasn’t alone. Captain Barks climbed up onto the bed with him and Sherlock enjoyed the deepest most restful sleep he’d had in a long time. The sounds of Cap’s doggy snoring and quiet wuffing as the dog dreamed of chasing things was a perfect lullaby.
John has been sitting in his bedsit, attempting to put together some semblance of a super suit after hearing about the break-in at Pentonville Prison. He has some vague idea about anonymously tracking down the fugitives and restoring balance but as he looks indecisively at the face of the suit and wonders how much he really prioritises breathing and whether a hole for his mouth and nose is actually optional he is interrupted. A news broadcast flashes across his television with the words LIVE! glaring at him from the corner of the screen.
, master.” The detective slid himself down John’s wonderfully hot body, he was deliciously warm. He’d be amazing to sleep next to, Sherlock could imagine it. Waking up, warm and cuddled together. John would be soft and sleepy, they’d share sloppy morning kisses for hours.
“No, no… John. You don’t. You’re not like them. You’re a kind, wonderful man.” Sherlock glanced down at Rosamund. Her leg was back and burnt up her knee now. She was gasping and panting in pain, no longer fully conscious of what was happening around her. “If you do this, you’re no better than they are.”
The sparse intel Mycroft's minions at MI6 had been able to gather had at least proven to be true, the problem was they were always parts of a whole. Often key bit's of information would be missed or simply not exist until it was too late and Sherlock had to deal with the fallout. This new criminal Mycroft was currently battling wasn’t their usual fair. He was a true mastermind, a proper baddie for Sherlock to slay. He called himself ‘The Spider’ the man at the center of a criminal web.
As the door thumped closed behind him the wind changed again, bringing heavier snow down onto the tiny cabin.
“Down again Holmes,” The Captain encouraged and grasped his hips one last time. He glanced up to see where his troop were. There were on the far side of the field, perfect.
The other hero was dressed in a garish royal blue morph suit, with red gloves, wellingtons and pants pulled over the top. He’d also tied a cheap two-hundred and fifty thread count white cotton sheet around his neck in a simile of the typical heroic cape. Sherlock was not impressed with the travesty of the British Flag which had been sloppily hand-painted on the man's broad chest.
“Oh! I see. You are forgiven then, John.” Sherlock smiles a gigantic goofy smile up at John before he plunges his mouth down over his cock.
Sherlock rushes over to his jacket which John had thrown across the room the night before. Hands shaking with panic, Sherlock quickly pulls up his contacts. It’s time he told Mycroft everything. Before he presses the ‘Call’ button, Sherlock’s phone pings with a message.
“You bastard!” Rosamund yelled pulling a knife from her belt and stabbing Sherlock in the arm as he raised it to protect his face. “I’ll kill you! Both of you!”
“I’m taking this out of your rent, again!” Mrs Hudson yelled as she stomped into the kitchen and began making him a sandwich.
again. John rinsed his mouth out and took several deep gulps of water from the tap. Then he settled himself and concentrated inwards. Letting the flow of power weaken inside himself, allowing the energy to dwindle off until it was almost nothing.
“No, I don’t think so. Nothing that comes to mind anyways. If I think of anything else I’ll let you know.” John’s eyes glittered and sparkled in the darkening cabin, it was getting late.
“Yes, John it’s me. You’re safe. You’re with me. I’ve got you.” Sherlock cupped John’s face in his hands. He watched as John’s eyes lost their bright glow and slowly returned to their natural deep blue.
For the second time that day, John wasn’t fast enough. The bullet from the sniper hits its mark, slamming into his left shoulder and bursting out through his back. The force of the bullet shoved John backwards, then there was just pain. John screamed, and his whole body seemed to scream along with him. Blindly John reached out for the only thing that could possibly help him.
Over the roar of the fire, John could just make out Sherlock yelling more spells. “Mobiliarbus! Levicorpus!”. With a sudden violent jerk, John’s ankles were yanked up over his head and he found himself hanging upside down.
“I believe you, I just… Well. It’s not really fair, is it? You can conjure lube whenever you want, and that’s fine for you but what if I wanna keep you mindless with lust for me hmm? I don’t like breaking the mood to have to bring your wits back long enough for you to twizzle your wand.”
He looked over at the instrument caddy beside the table and picked up a long pair of tweezers. Carefully Sherlock moved the flesh away from the neck vertebrae. There were cut marks, made by a blade on the bone. Moran’s head had been removed before he’d been fed to the crocodile.
Skidding on the sand John turned around and faced his attackers. With a deep breath, he did something he’d sworn to himself never to do. Use his powers to hurt, to kill. John pulled on the energy within him, he could feel his skin heating up, the palms of his hands getting hotter and hotter. He needed to make this shot count. Perhaps the sniper would be too confused watching him to shoot, maybe it would buy his men enough time to make it to safety.
John giggles, “Easy now, genius.” After a few seconds and a few adjustments of Sherlock’s trembling legs John finally, finally manages to push into Sherlock.
“Oh fuck, me too.” John fell forward, his hands clapping loudly on the wooden counter on either side of Sherlock’s head. “Kiss me?”
Johno moved closer, his hand drifting higher to rub circles into Sherlock’s shoulder blade. “Nigel, can I call you Nigel?”
Sherlock glanced up from where he was bent uncomfortably over some files on the ULOTC recruits. So far he’d not found any leads on which one was the murderer and he was running out of time. There was a chance that the killer could strike again. The wall in question was covered in photos of all the male recruits in uniform pinned to the wall.
“There is still time, take a bathroom break in ten minutes and see if you can find her backstage. Message me as soon as you do. Don’t engage her without me, John.” Sherlock reached out for his hand and squeezed it. “Promise me. This can’t end like the what happened in Monaco.”
John grinned. “That was so hot, I wanted to fuck you so bad and you kept sticking out your arse like an offering. Jesus Christ. Please let me, Sherlock please. I want to.”
“Sherlock…” John breathed as he leant forward and pressed his supernaturally warm lips against Sherlocks.
At this, Sherlock turns around in disbelief. “Immediately? Surely I should land first unless you are wishing me to engage in an act of murder?” The interloper was dressed in the most ridiculous outfit Sherlock had ever seen, it was obviously some attempt at the overused and cliched Superhero costume. No doubt the imbecile has picked a suitably unimaginative name to match. Great Britain Man, or some such.
John pried his eyes open and took in the scene from his upside-down position hanging over the flipped and somewhat burned lorry. Moran sneered at Sherlock and flicked his wand towards the detective.
The Captain had Sherlock placed at the front of the group right behind him so that he could watch Sherlock closely. This meant that Sherlock had to watch John Watson run, watch his legs stride powerfully. Watch his back move and flex as his arms swung with his movements, and most importantly watch his arse pull the fatigues light across his cheeks as each leg swung forward.
The sound of whistling caught Sherlock's attention as he rounded the corner and approached the ‘Reptile Cave’ entrance. Leaning against the faux cave wall was the only interesting person in all of Australia, as far as Sherlock was concerned. Johno grinned at him. His smile was warm, reaching his eyes and giving him a wonderful glow.
Sherlock waited for John to continue, but he didn’t, he simply grabbed a long sleeved shirt from the pile and pulled it over his head. He even had scars on his hands, white shiny lines following along where his tendons would be under the skin. Sherlock shuddered, maybe it was better he didn’t know what had happened. Surely those scars hadn’t been caused by his deployment to Afghanistan, no Sherlock wasn’t that naive. He knew explorative dissection incisions when he saw them.
Sherlock pushed himself up and got up off of John. “What else would I say? That is what you’re going to do. Penetrate my arsehole with your penis.” He slipped into the bathroom for a moment, then returned with a brand new bottle of personal lubricant in hand.
Sherlock shook his head, “No I didn’t choose it, Mycroft thinks he’s funny.” he sighed. “But it would be best if you kept that bit of information to yourself.”
John didn’t reply, but the sound of Sherlock’s hotel room door closing behind him was answer enough.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered, his mind shoving several different fantasies of John on his knees, mouth full of Sherlock cock before his eyes. “Next time.” Sherlock agreed, climbing up onto the bench and lifting John’s legs over his shoulders. Bracing himself with one arm Sherlock reached down and lined up his cock with John’s arsehole.
“I’m s-sorry sir, do you want me to start again?” Sherlock puffed and glanced up at the Captain. If his face could get any redder it certainly gave it a try. John Watson’s deep blue eyes were blown wide, his pupils were heavily dilated and Sherlock could tell his breathing and heart rate were elevated. He was aroused.
“John!” Sherlock called, startling both himself and Rosamund. “Stop, you… You can’t. Let her go. Let me take her to Mycroft.
“Could you see yourself, well… Would you like… Hmm…” John cleared his throat again. He was never good at this talking stuff.
As promised John dropped Sherlock off at his hotel on his way to the Zoo. Sherlock would never admit to watching the electric blue Prius for as long as possible until it turned a corner and disappeared from sight. The loss of John’s presence weighed heavily on his mind as he showered and dressed in clean clothes.
“Sorry, brother. You already know what my answer is going to be. What you will be interested in, however, is that I may have found a source for insider information on Moriarty’s network.” Sherlock tilted his head in question, still holding John’s gaze. “If my source is willing to give up that information?”
“Christ, Sherlock… You… You…” John panted. Sherlock repeated the motion, again and again, taking a little bit more of John into his mouth each time. On the next downward movement, Sherlock swirled his tongue around the head of John’s cock, his mouth lingering and sucking softly has he pulled back up.
“Nnnnnn-Nine!” Sherlock whined, he could feel it coming, his orgasm was coiled so tight in his belly he just needed something. “T-t-tennnn”
“I detest repetition. Here. Have him, if you can catch him.” Sherlock dropped the squirming, squealing pig of a man below him, somewhat content that the other corrupt police officers were safely housed within the prison cells of Pentonville.
Sherlock had now been inside John’s body for a week. He had tried to maintain the body in as close to the same condition that he had found it in when he had awoken inside it. It had a few bruises from where Sherlock had tripped and fallen and when he had stubbed John’s hairy toes on the kitchen table. Other than that it was in perfect condition.
As Sherlock and his unwanted tour guide were making their way past the Reptile section of the Zoo, the Administrator suddenly made a very strange shouting noise.
“John, we’re here. Stay close to me, and try not to talk to anyone if you can. Our first priority is to find Rosamund and take her out.” Sherlock nodded towards the door of the limo as their car pulled up to the red carpeted entrance of the theatre. John adjusted his shoulder holster under his jacket and ducked out of the car, stepping aside to allow Sherlock through behind him.
John was wet, actually that was an understatement. Drenched to the bone was a more accurate description. It had been pouring with rain for the last three hours and unfortunately John had been unable to take shelter because of a certain curly-haired detective.
“Well, I knew you were desperate for a bit of action but I didn’t think you would put yourself in distractedly skin-tight lycra and wear your pants on the outside. It suits you much better than that horrid jumper you wore the other night. Were you seriously going to move in with me? Knowing I was Bloodhound?”
Sherlock poked his tongue out childishly, but he straightened up, pulling his fingers out of John’s body and squeezing more lubricant onto his hand. John scooted backwards as far as he was able to on the limited space of the kitchen bench and watched, panting as Sherlock wrapped his wet hand around his cock and stroked himself.
Sherlock glanced over at John and Mycroft. They’d both been gagged, his eyes locked with his brother’s. Mycroft shook his head ever so slightly. Sherlock’s heart sunk, this was it then, there was no getting out of this, no MI5 swat team that would descend down and save them.
” The pool abruptly filled with rushing wind, faster and faster it swirled around Sherlock. The wind lifted up debris from around the pool and slammed it into walls and pillars. John’s prison swayed dangerously back and forth as the wind pushed against it. The steel cables groaned under the load.
“Oh!” Sherlock gasped and lowered himself down until he could just feel the pressure of the grass on his erection before pushing back up again. “S-seven!”
“Right then, I’m off. Gotta put Barry in the enclosure before smoko or he’ll miss lunch. Give us a shout if ya need me Mister Humphrey!” Johno smiled, turning around and waving back over his head, making his way towards the vibrantly signed ‘REPTILE CAVE’ enclosure. Sherlock just stared after the man, who oh-so-casually would hold the world's deadliest snake in a sack over his shoulder. What an Intriguing man…
“You see, Sherlock. I’m done playing games with you now. You’ve taken someone very dear to, not only myself but to my Sebastian. He loves his sister, you know. Families do.” Moriarty shrugs. “Sebastian wants revenge, but I can’t have him breaking my very special toy.” James gestures over at the glass coffin. John is starting to wake up, the drugs finally beginning to wear off. “He’s one of a kind, after all.”
Mycroft had never forgotten Sherlock’s little secret kink when he had searched his little brothers room and found his stash of military magazines stuffed between his mattress and the slats on his bed. It was intolerable.
The clatter of footsteps growing louder and louder behind him pulled Sherlock’s focus away from the captivating man. The scientist's and guns for hire who manned this laboratory had obviously returned from wherever they’d been. He needed to set the charges and get out. Now.
With a deep breath Sherlock stepped forward and shook it, the hand was calloused, rough and strong. This was torture.
But he is back in a glass cell, Sherlock is willing to bet John will not be happy about that. Sebastian has locked John in a special coffin like contraption which he has suspended over the pool. The water is obviously a failsafe, if John manages to heat up enough to melt the glass then the coffin will be dumped into the water. Which will flood the prison and John will drown.
“Obviously Anderson, I have eyes.” Sherlock huffed. “Just because you need the most obvious of facts pointed out to you doesn’t mean we all do.”
Realisation hit him hard. There was no way he could ask John to give all this up. He’d built all of this with his own hands, cultivated the land, his sweat and blood had given this beautiful place life. He would never agree to follow Sherlock back to his flat on Baker Street, surrounded by concrete, cobblestones, grey skies and rainy days.
Under his new uniform Sherlock had, pre-emptively wore his tightest pair of pants. He knew from previous experience he would be at least half had for most of the day just being near military personnel. Once those personnel turned their attention on him and started barking orders, all bets were off. Sherlock hoped he would be able to keep his composure long enough to find the murderer quickly so he could get out of there as fast as possible.
The buildings were lit up with bright purples, reds, whites and oranges as the two wizards duelled. Mycroft would not be happy once he found out Sherlock had participated in an extremely public display of magic in the middle of Muggle London. John tried to pull his legs free of the sticking charm but found it impossible.
John’s was actually staring at Sherlock in open astonishment, his mouth hanging open and pupils dilating visibly by the second.
Sherlock smiled at John softly before turning his attention to the journalist who had taken the stage. John continued to watch Sherlock for a moment longer before returning to scan the room for their target. Neither man noticed they continued to hold hands.
Sherlock placed the head down but turned it so that the severed neck faced him. Leaning closer he inspected the severed flesh, the edge of the skin was rough and messy it looked like the head had been ripped off the body. Sherlock frowned, there was something…
“Bathroom,” John muttered into Sherlock’s ear after about fifteen minutes had passed. He made his way between tables, walking left and right trying to cover as much ground as possible. Wherever Rosamund was hiding it certainly wasn’t in plain sight. Ducking through a side door, John found himself in an empty hallway he looked around for a moment to get his bearings then made his way towards the stage entrance.
Could he make John come like this? From touching his nipples only? It certainly felt like it. “Oh god, John!” Sherlock moaned and suddenly had a genius idea. He had two hands, and John’s body had two nipples.
The useless dunderhead he was carrying trussed up in rope just wouldn’t stop screaming. How irritating.
“Sherlock! Fuck! I’m gonna cum, stop. For fuck's sake. You’re too fucking good.” John pushed against Sherlock’s head. “Christ!”
Sherlock flinched backwards and quickly rolled away from the woman. Standing up and watching, in shock as John lost control of himself.
“No Sir!” Sherlock panted back, his spine was tingling. His feet felt too heavy and too light at the same time.
They were back in 221B now, several Chinese food containers spread around them. Sherlock was showing off some of his magic for John, it was brilliant. Sparks of blue, purple and orange exploded from the end of his wand and he twirled it around his fingers.
“...have to come out to the house before you go back to dreary old England. I think you’d like it, or well… I hope you do. I’m also a wildlife carer, so I have a couple of Joeys at home if you’d like to see them?” John glanced over at Sherlock, eyes sparkling. “You can also meet Billy.”
At least Sherlock wouldn’t feel the effects of the time difference as badly as some with his sleeping schedule being so out of ordinary, already. His transport has yet to fail him while crossing the international date line and Sherlock saw no reason why this trip would be any different.
“How did you know he was colour blind?” Lestrade asked looking puzzled by Sherlock’s last deduction.
In fact, John was so smitten with Sherlock Holmes that he was actively contemplating telling him. He’d never told anyone his secret. The only people who knew where his Mum, Dad and Sister. His Mum and Dad wouldn’t be telling anyone anytime soon, being that they had died when John was eighteen. His sister could feasibly tell someone, but the likelihood of anyone believing her was slim.
“Yes Sir!” Sherlock gasped. Oh god, oh god, oh god. How was he going to do this? He could barely focus on anything but Captain Watson. He was supposed to be finding the murderer not blushing and swooning like a Jane Austen character because the military man spoke to him. Sherlock gritted his teeth and kept his focus on one of the high windows in the building across the field. After a moment’s hesitation Captain Watson continued his inspection down the line.
“How interesting that you deem it appropriate knowledge to keep in your ‘harddrive’ that to be a member of the ULOTC you must first be enrolled as a student at London University.”
John nodded, “Not a very imaginative name for a goat I know. But Billy’s a fantastic gal, keeps my grass short and she’s a great laugh. Such a funny one, old Bil.”
“Do you think you can open the door, sweetheart?” John’s voice had turned gentle. He’d called Sherlock ‘sweetheart’... Sherlock reached over and turned the lock on the door. John was inside the stall in seconds, kneeling on the floor between Sherlock's legs. “Keep breathing, that’s perfect. Wonderful.”
“I heard what you said, git.” John huffed and shoved the tall dark and handsome magical man off his kitchen table. Why the bastard kept appearing out of thin air only to slam onto it was beyond John’s understanding.
John had just laughed and excitedly pulled him over to his beehives. “Sherlock, I’d like you to meet my Bee Army.”
“Alright then,” Sherlock pulled one of John’s hands away from his arse and squirted a glob of lube onto his palm. “Make me all sick and wet for your cock, John. I want to ride you until I cum.”
Today John was being woken up, properly. Sherlock wanted to be there for him. To explain that they’d swapped and that between sessions of fondling John’s gigantic penis Sherlock had researched and figured out a way to swap them back. This time, without the third-degree burns and induced coma.
“Azza!” Johno called happily as he approached them. The two clasped hands in greeting. “Strange to see you out of the office? Fancy some sun, mate?”
“Oh! Christ Sherlock!” John gasped as Sherlock lifted himself up, then dropped down onto John’s cock. It was delicious, Sherlock’s insides rippling and gripping his cock so tightly. “Yes, baby.
“Good shot.” Sherlock all but purrs the moment he is standing in front of John. It’s not the thought of death that has his heart racing and palms sweaty. It’s the thought of John, protecting him. John. The very, very interesting muggle shooting a serial killer to save a wizard he met three days ago.
“John!” Sherlock cried out, his whole body going rigid. Orgasm taking him by surprise. He’d been so engrossed in tasting and biting he’d not been paying attention to the building pressure, the white-hot pleasure growing to unbearable heights before plunging over the other side. Sherlock’s body shuddered and spasmed, riding out the aftershocks of the best orgasm of his life.
“Sherlock, you… We just met. I don’t know a thing about you, I don’t even know where ‘home’ is. I’m not going to move in with some sorcerer who magically fell into my flat. I know you’re smarter than that.” John rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed.
“Oh, my apologies Doctor Watson! You and your flatmate Sherlock Holmes were struck by lightning two days ago. I’m afraid Mr Holmes hasn’t woken up yet he was hit more directly and has suffered third-degree burns to his right arm and chest. We are keeping him in an induced coma until his body has had a chance to heal first.” The Doctor glanced down at the file in his hands. “You and Mr Holmes are listed as each others next of kin. Is that correct?”
“Fucking lunatics! You‘ve shattered my pelvis!” The thief screams,  “You ain’t no coppers! Please don’t kill me! I swear I will never steal again!”
Sherlock!” John’s hips were tilting and shifting, rocking in time with Sherlock’s soft kisses. “Yessss, you’re mouth, fuck.
Sherlock giggled before he could stop himself. John Watson had hairy toes. Amazing. He needed a mirror. Sherlock slid out of bed and stumbled his way across the room to the toilet.
Sherlock had only spared himself a brief moment in his hotel room. Enough time to change, and adopt his new ‘identity’ as Nigel Humphrey,  member of Interpol, sent to Australia to investigate the strange death of a British citizen. ‘Nigel’ caught an Uber to Australia Zoo and made his introductions to the Zoo Administrator, who was probably the most boring man Sherlock had ever had the misfortune to meet.
“Team Bloodhound and his sidekick Captain London. It has a lot of potential, you know?” Sherlock had been arguing for a new Superhero Team™ with 221B Baker Street as a base of operations since they arrived.
“Oh, bloody hell!” John swears aloud as he stands to rip off his striped jumper and begins to pull on the lycra morph suit. A litany of curse words continued internally as he realised this suit is nowhere near ready for his first Supervillain encounter.
The smell of flowery perfume drifted over Sherlock’s senses, the clip-clip of a woman's heels behind him. Boring. Perhaps tonight was the night Mycroft would be wrong. He’d never been before, but Sherlock supposed, everyone was human. Humans make mistakes.
“Cadet Holmes, is there something I can do for you?” Captain Watson said as he stood up from his desk. Sherlock was in the officers building again, but this time instead of Major Jones to greeting him it was John Watson.
John snorted, “Greg doesn’t want to get married again, not after that mess with his ex-wife. I bet Mycroft has secretly had the paperwork filed.”
The Captain re-took his seat behind his desk and his eyes swept up and down Sherlock’s body. “I see, will you be needing to interview the officers as well?”
“John!” Sherlock growled and looked down at his blogger with a scowl. It was at that moment, with John looking up into his flatmates eyes both of them squinting due to rain that the next flash of light came.
He was short, but broad. Clearly still very fit, especially for a man approaching 40. His hair was blond but it was lightened further with a hint of silver, that only showed when the early morning light hit it just right. His hands looked strong and capable, his stride confident and his fatigues were pressed and starched beautifully. Sherlock let his eyes take in all the information he could about the Captain. Single, veteran of at least 20, maybe 25 years. Trained as a trauma surgeon. Wounded in action, left shoulder. Most likely a bullet wound.
Sherlock reached for a glass of water from the fountain beside the couch and took a few deep gulps of water. The cold helped him clear his mind. Sherlock strode over the the Major’s desk and began sifting through everything. It was a few moments later when Sherlock found what he’d been looking for. It was a list of all the Universities employee’s and their political views. The names of the victims he’d murdered had been crossed out. Bingo.
John cuts him off with a soft kiss, they pull each other closer and when John pulls away he rubs his nose against Sherlock’s. “I love you, you’re the only one for me, Sherlock. Every since you fell, almost literally into my lap.”
Sherlock flies away to the soundtrack of screams fading as the distance between them grew before being abruptly cut off… By death or rescue, it was no longer his concern.
John, who had been looking over the photos of the dignitaries who would be in attendance at the Gala made eye contact with Sherlock for a moment before getting up and shutting the blinds on all the windows.
Sherlock reached out to touch John’s shoulder softly, he was warm and Sherlock felt a shiver travel up his arm at the soft feeling of the wool. His hands were cold and John felt like a perfectly heated water bottle. “I’m trying to stop him, Mycroft has been building up evidence against him for years. We’re so close now, to ending his little game. We just need to find and take down his network. Moriarty isn’t stupid. He’s got people who can take over if he’s killed or arrested. We need to get rid of them first, then cut off the head. Once we do that his web will collapse into itself.”
“Fuck, Sherlock you. God, you’re so hot. You want it so bad, don’t you. You want my cock?” John panted and added another finger to the slow in out, in out movement.
“Your left hand, it’s quite obvious the gun isn’t loaded. You see here,” Sherlock pointed to the man’s wrist. “If the gun was loaded your wrist would be under more strain with the additional weight of a full magazine. Here, the trigger is not engaged. So it’s not that you ‘won’t’ shoot me. It’s that you cannot. Be assured though that I am sure if the gun had been loaded I would be in fear of my life.” Sherlock paused and started at the muggle. “You’re an army doctor.”
John shifted down, his hand not holding him up sliding down Sherlock’s chest, he pinched and pulled at a hard nipple on his way and groaned as he watched Sherlock squirm and moan in response. John sat back on his heels and lifted Sherlock’s legs up, catching on Sherlock grasped his legs and held them up.
“Obviously.” Sherlock rolled his eys, he was in a very bad mood this morning. Waking up on the floor covered in dried semen was not an enjoyable experience. Being greeting by the main attraction of his dreams last night in such an unfriendly manner wasn’t helping.
When the case was over, once Sherlock knew who had killed Sebastian Moran, he would return back to London. He would lose John. Sherlock looked over at his companion, John was talking about other native animals he’d fostered in the past; fruit bats, sugar gliders, several kookaburras and even a wedge-tailed eagle with a broken wing. He needed to make the most of the time he would have with John.
“I’m done. It’s enough. I don’t want to run around London anymore. I want to be with you, John. I want to watch the sun rise and set together, I want to see the stars with you. I want to watch you make jam and keep bees and sell organic honey for pocket money.”
Sherlock had never been the best at apparition. He knew how to do it but he always seemed to just slightly miss his coordinates. Mycroft made fun of him endlessly for it. Today though seemed to be far worse than the mishaps before. Sherlock who was aiming for St. Barts had managed to apparate into some Muggles house quite unexpectedly.
“Gu-ah!” Sherlock cried out, he was so close. He was going to cum from doing pushups in the middle of a field. “Fuck!”
“Yes. It’s my brother. Excuse me for a moment.” Sherlock mentally thanked his brother for his impeccable timing, pulled out his phone which was still playing Mycroft’s personalised ringtone and swiped his finger over the screen to answer. “Mikey, my love. Have I told you how much I hate puppies?”
It had been a long day at the clinic, there was a stomach bug that had been making the rounds and so he and a couple of other GP’s had stayed back later than usual to help. John both loved and hated working at the clinic, it was boring treating people day-in-day-out for runny noses, sore throats and flu shots. But John also loved helping people, it was the reason why he’d become a Doctor in the first place.
” Sherlock whined, his lips captured again by Johno’s mouth. Johno’s hands were back, squeezing his arse, then gripping lower onto his thighs.
“The bullet they just dug out of the wall’s from a handgun. Kill shot over that distance from that kind of a weapon – that’s a crack shot you’re looking for, but not just a marksman; a fighter. His hands couldn’t have shaken at all, so clearly he’s acclimated to violence. He didn’t fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You’re looking for a man probably with a history of military service… and nerves of steel… Actually, do you know what?
“Yes, must have been, through that window.” John muttered and gestured unconvincingly towards the mess of police cars and flashing lights.
Sherlock shook himself and turned towards the shower, he was behaving like a randy teenager. They’d just fucked, quite vigorously only after meeting a handful of hours beforehand and now they were going out to dinner together. Sherlock turned on the hot water and waited for the stream to heat up, adjusting the temperature to suit his preference.
“And alert every bodyguard in the theatre?” Sherlock whispered back at John, before reaching out for the ladder and starting to climb. “We’d never find her in the mass panic, same problem with your fire alarm idea.”
“It’s fine, keep going. You can go faster. I’m good.” Sherlock encouraged and pulled John down so he could kiss his forehead. Their height difference meant that Sherlock couldn’t reach his lips but he could scrape his nails down John’s back and wrap his legs around his waist.
Johno laughed. “Too right! Now then, Azza said you wanted to have a look around Acco’s enclosure?” The Zookeeper rubbed a hand over his neatly trimmed beard. The sound of the thick bristles rustling sent a shiver down Sherlock's spine.
One of John’s hands slid up Sherlock’s back and into his hair, gripping the curls tightly and pulling. “You need to…” Sherlock nipped at John’s shoulder in retaliation. “Sherlock!”
Sherlock’s whole body clenched, his muscles pulling tight his breath whooshing out of his lungs and he comes. He comes and comes and comes. It feels like it goes on for hours. “Oh! Oh! John!”
“Harry is my sister, not my brother.” John gasped between kisses, “It was shrapnel damaged that caused the tremor, our airlift took a direct hit and the side paneling on the chopper exploded.”
“John, it’s okay. I know this is weird. We were struck by lightning and somehow in the discharge of electricity our conscious minds swapped bodies. Now, not to worry. While you’ve been unconscious I’ve been doing research and I have devised an experiment in which we will use these two defibrillators to re-create the same charge and swap our minds back.” Sherlock pulled over the hospital cart that he had borrowed from intensive care inside which he had stowed two defibrillators.
John nodded and shifted forward in his red armchair towards Sherlock. They were sitting facing each other in front of the fire. It was very warm and cosy and John thought that if he got to spend every night just like this for the rest of his life in Baker Street he would die a very happy man. John overbalanced a bit and ended up with one knee on the floor between Sherlock’s legs, and one hand braced firmly on one of Sherlock’s long legs. “Uh…” John hesitated to push himself back up into his chair.
“You’re lucky John’s alive, Moran. If you had killed him I would rip you apart with my bare hands.” Sherlock growled.
John moved away quickly pulling his uniform shirt out from where it was tucked into his trousers and violently tearing it over his head, throwing it in a random direction. Sherlock’s breath caught, his eyes darting around taking in all the new data. John had clearly spent a lot of time out in the sun without a shirt. There were no tan lines. Just golden skin, sparse blonde chest hair, and a large scar that reached down from John’s left shoulder to the centre of his chest. It looked like a massive bite mark.
“Ow! Sherlock!” John winced, “Fucking-that hurt like a bitch. Do you go for all the guys kidneys first?”
Sherlock threw the bag into the corner of the room and then looked at the bed. He looked a mess. Bandages covered his right arm and disappeared under the hospital gown they’d put on his body. The body, Sherlock hoped contained John’s consciousness. They must have swapped. They must have.
John wondered why no one else had realised this fact, especially considering the man worked as a consultant for Scotland Yard. Surely the police weren’t that incompetent.
“It’s magic John, it’s not going to hurt you.” Sherlock rolls his eyes at his boyfriend as they walk down the aisle at their local chemist.
Sherlock lifted up, pressing his open mouth against John’s, they breathed heavily into each other's mouths, John's beard scratching deliciously against Sherlock’s lips, their tongues curling and sliding against the others. Sherlock could feel the sharp white-hot spark of orgasm crash over him. The waves of pleasure causing his thrusts up into John’s body to falter. John was only seconds behind, his cock cumming untouched, splashing warmth all over Sherlock’s chest.
