“Blue.”
Cas’s eyes were beaded with tears as they stared at Dean. Words spilled from his mouth, all true. He didn’t even really know what he was saying- everything he had kept buried down, everything he had ever felt was spilling out for the first time. Dean watched them with tears beading his own eyes, his lips bit to keep his own words from spilling. Cas didn’t pay much mind. The empty was coming, he knew that- but still they stood and confessed.
“It’s nice to meet you, Meg.” Sam replied, a smile on his face. Dean nodded in agreement.
“You know the girl?”
“There's a kid here named Lucifer?” Sam asked incredulously, his eyes tinted with what seemed to be shock.
"Ah well, no more moving around for you two." Bobby remarked. "Now you got a new, permanent school."
Dean finished his poptart and hastily grabbed his bag, swung it over his shoulder, grabbed his water bottle and walked out of the dorm room and to his first class. His classes ended at 4 that day, and once they were over, he got a bite to eat at the local IHop. He once again wolfed his food down in record time, and gulped his drink down. His phone buzzed as he finished his food, and he glanced at it to see a text from Cas.
“Because, Dean,” Sam explained, taking a bite of his spaghetti, “Your soulmate is supposed to be your partner for life. You know, the best friend and lover who loves you for who you are, not for your past or what you’ve done. And soulmates are supposed to bring you lots of happiness. Isn’t it normal to want happiness?”
Charlie clicked her tongue and let her eyes dart across Sam’s face. “That’s a shame. You mind if I help you find them?”
It was 11 am by the time any of the hungover Novak siblings woke up- and Balthazar was surprisingly the first to wake up. He was followed about twenty minutes later by a very sluggish and slightly irritable Cas, who was clutching his head and groaning from his hangover.
"Dean! Good morning!"
Charlie just smiled. “I have my ways, Dean. I’ll help find them.”
"Well, this city is pretty nice, from what I've seen." Dean agreed.
Charlie glanced at Dean, beaming. "And besides, Dorothy is really nice. She's studying Aerospace Engineering!"
A wide, bright smile suddenly spread across Charlie’s face, as she seemed to jitter with excitement- to the surprise of all those at the table. Dean glanced suspiciously at her, but he wasn’t expecting what she said.
Dean groaned loudly and shoved his face back into the pillow. “Goddammit. Why does it have to be a friday?? Why can’t it just be saturday?!”
“Awwww.” Charlie sighed, a small smile resting on her face.
spending time with Cas. The two had taken to lounging around in their dorm room, lying lazily on their beds, talking about shows they liked and watching random Marvel movies. Dean had been exercising his control over his feelings, trying not to show them and yet trying to drop subtle hints about his feelings to Cas. However, Anna’s words were proving true; Cas was extremely oblivious when it came to feelings.
Anna stared at Balth. “What guy?”
Dean wondered. He was perfectly happy in his bed, tucked under the thick blankets with his head against the warm, cushy pillow. He didn't want to get up.
“Oh I don’t. I just listen to nightcore every now and then, and you can find a lot of her songs nightcored. They're all pretty good dance-y songs.”
Samandriel was the next person to enter the kitchen that morning for breakfast, having changed into some good clothes. He was now dressed in his typical attire- a striped shirt that Chuck had said was white and red, a pair of jeans and some dark shoes which Chuck had also said were dark red. He grabbed a plate of waffles and drizzled quite a bit of syrup onto them before taking a forkful of waffle.
His room was yet to be fully decorated- he surprisingly still had some unpacking to do- but he had a desk, a computer and the walls were painted. The paint can had said mahogany on it, but Dean couldn't tell if the can had been lying or not, as his room was still solid gray to him. Nevertheless, he just assumed it was mahogany and had painted his room with it.
He had come to the unbearable conclusion a while back. If anything were to happen to Dean, they decided, he’d sacrifice himself to make sure his human survived. Even if it took everything they had, even if he had to give up everything he’d ever known and loved, he’d do it for Dean. He’d already done so a thousand times over. Sacrificing themself for Dean wasn’t even a second thought. It had been ingrained into his entire being by now-
A burst of colors, reds and yellows and greens and blues, all splashed across the house. Anna’s hair was a beautiful shade of red, Balthazar’s a dark, ashy blonde and Samandriel’s a light brown. Cas looked down at his own shirt, which was a dark red color.
“So what are we supposed to do with the list?” Dean whispered. “I barely know anyone at this school. It’d be like… like searching for a needle in a haystack. It’s damn near impossible!”
"About four weeks into summer."
Gabriel nodded and took a bite of his waffles. He glanced over at Cas, who was sitting quietly and eating the regular buttermilk waffles Becky had prepared. Cas shared a brief glance with Gabriel, before nodding his head as he continued eating.
"Well, Bobby said your classes start at 8:30, and mine do too, so I woke up early so I could call you." Sam replied.
“Hey guys,” Cried Becky as she walked downstairs, “School starts in one hour. You should probably head out in the next fifteen minutes.”
As Dean poured water over the plates, he suddenly remembered something.
"You can use the bathroom now." Dean remarked, walking into the kitchen. He grabbed a pan, put it on the oven, and began making an omelette. Dean had been cooking for himself and his brother since he was six, so he could make a whole array of dishes. And luckily, Bobby had bought him a cookbook when he was 10, so Dean had used that cookbook to fix breakfast, lunch and dinner for himself and his brother since then. He'd hide it from his father, then take it out while his father was off working, and cook enough food for a few days.
However, Sam and Dean didn't seem to care- an empty house meant an opportunity to personalize the house- to make it their own. They had never had that opportunity before, as their family had never had enough money to get anything to decorate either of the boys rooms. But now, Bobby was taking care of them, and he had a stable enough income and enough money to get things to decorate their rooms. And man were Sam and Dean excited at the prospect of having their own rooms to personalize.
Cas and Balthazar cebrate their birthday. Dean and Sam meet some of Charlie's friends
“Lebanon?”
in all caps from Charlie. Dean laughed and typed something back.
“Nothing.”
Balthazar took a quick glance at the list and shrugged. “Well, you could add a personality to the list.”
“Castiel Novak. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
Sam’s next class was French 1, and he didn't know anyone in the class, but he liked it regardless. The teacher, Mr. Anthony, had the same first name as him, which he found interesting. The teacher was also actually French, having been born and raised in France. Given that, he knew a lot about France and its culture, and was happy to tell the class about it.
Charlie nodded. “Really green. A very pretty green.” She pulled out her phone and unlocked, briefly looking at her own reflection in the camera. “You got lucky. I have blue-hazel eyes.”
Michael suddenly emerged on the stairs, glancing at Anna. “What?”
“Mhm.”
“Exactly my point.”
It was then that she grabbed her phone and typed away at the screen, though Sam was unsure if it was related to his current situation, or if she was just texting her soulmate. Either way, Sam continued painting, hoping his slip of the tongue wouldn’t come back to haunt him.
also misha stole my glasses and told me i’m blind so that was fun
Andy shifted in his seat, playing with the pencil between his fingers. “Something happen? You’ve been weird the entire period.”
“You better not.”
When the class started, Dean managed to actually take some decent notes, trying his hardest to listen and write down whatever he could. The class seemed to drag on for a long time, and yet seemed to go by really fast, and before Dean knew it, it was 10 am, and the class was over. Dean grabbed his bag and headed back to his dorm, dropped off his bag and then headed to the campus cafeteria.
Catching himself, Dean screwed the cap back on and set the bottle down. "Thanks." He spoke, glancing at Cas. Cas nodded and opened the front door, grabbed his bag and walked off.
Dean shook his head. “I’ve never understood why anyone would put math first. I got US History first, though. Thankfully.”
"What about you?"
be chewed out relentlessly.
“What choice do I have? Sam’s 14, I can't exactly let him live by himself in the apartment, even if you visit everyday.” Dean replied, his hand gripping the wheel. He hadn't even started his car yet.
“You do like your therapist, right? I can get ya a new one.”
Cas averted his eyes right as Gabriel walked over to him. Gabriel gave him a quick pat on the back before walking out of the dorm. Gabriel quietly closed th door as he left, leaving Cas alone to his thoughts.
Dean passed by many pretty things as he drove. Dean wasn't paying much attention to any of them, but each were pretty in their own aspects. Things like farms and sculptures, things Dean had never taken the time to look at before.
"Mechanical Engineering." Dean replied. "I want to work with cars."
Sam shook his head in dismissal and gripped his pencil. “I’m fine, Andy, really.”
“How were your classes?” Cas inquired the moment Dean stepped back into the dorm. Dean sighed and put his bag down, letting it fall to the floor with a loud thunk.
“Hello Gabriel.” Cas monotoned as his older brother waved feverently at him. Cas opened one of the van doors and sat in the seat next to Gabriel, as Lucifer and Michael both made their way to sit in the front seats.
Dean got back to the dorms at 5 that afternoon, and the dorm was empty. He set his bag down on the floor, then walked to the bathroom and turned on the water of the shower. Dean then undressed and stepped into the warm water, sighing as it hit his back. He had always loved a warm shower. He stood in the shower for a solid five minutes, doing nothing but enjoying the warm water against his skin. After five minutes, he began washing his hair and body.
Balthazar just shrugged, taking another box of Chips Ahoy. His eyes glanced over a few other boxes before he snuck a box of Pocky off the shelf.
“Heya Sammy.” Dean spoke, as his younger brother ran towards him and engulfed him in his arms. Dean hugged back, and Sam soon pulled away, and hugged Bobby in turn.
The cake was a neat and pretty thing. The body of it was white and the surface was blue, with the icing trickling down like paint. Blue and cream colored dollops of icing lined the edges, encircling the “Happy Birthday Castiel” message written there in neat black lettering.
“Dean Winchester.”
"Hey, Dean. My older sister invited me to go with her to this aquarium in the town over, do you want to come with me? My sister won't mind."
Next door to him, Dean could hear the familiar sounds of Sam getting ready- the shuffle of his closet doors, the crumpling of clothes onto the floor, and the shuffling of shoes. Dean didn't have to guess Sam’s next move, though; in a moment, Dean’s door was swung open by a way-too-eager Sam.
“Yes, I suppose you could, but I’ve seen that look before. That’s love, bitch. Now who is it?” Dean sighed, and Charlie grabbed his hand. “Look, I’d say I won’t pressure you to tell me but unfortunately I’d probably be lying. I can say, though, that I won’t joke around about it nor will I constantly bring it up if you don’t want me to.” Charlie pulled her shoulder up and laid her head on it. “Alright?”
As Charlie and Jo threw fries back and forth, Dean joined in and also threw fries. Sam just talked calmly to Benny about the school and soulmates. Benny seemed to have a similar outlook on soulmates to Sam, which he appreciated. And so, the two talked endlessly until the bell rang, and the group of five left for their next class.
so, in case y'all didn't know, i've hit a roadblock writing this story. idk when the next chapter will be out, but hopefully in the next seven weeks. i'll see y'all soon. thanks for being patient
“Yeah.” Jo replied, narrowing her eyes. “She’s talking to some girl, but she has her lunch.”
“No. All I remember is the color blue. I don’t know what it means though.”
“Nice to meet you too.” Dean replied, as Lisa waved her hand and walked over to a girl with dark hair who was attempting a lap dance on some dude.
People slowly started trickling out of the building, as Kevin dragged Dean outside. Sam was already by the Impala, preoccupied with whatever was on his phone. Meg was also there, chatting happily with Benny. Meanwhile Jo was trying to get Charlie up, as Charlie laid on the ground, babbling and giggling drunkenly. As Kevin dragged Dean across the street, Sam lifted his head and smiled.
“Cas! Hey Cas!” Jack exclaimed, holding his arms out. “Look! I’m feeling better!”
“I love you.”
He reached the college in exactly twenty minutes, right on time. He shut his door and locked the car, before he made his way to the main office so he could get his schedule and dorm room. As he reached the front door of the college, he looked up at the college in awe. Sighing, he opened the door and walked inside the large building.
The college Dean was in had four floors of dorms for both girls and boys. First floor was for freshmen, second for sophomores, third for juniors and fourth for seniors. There was also two dorm buildings for both boys and girls, as despite being a college for a relatively small town, there was a lot of students in the college.
Sam just shook his head and continued to eat. ‘Whatever you say, Dean.”
Gabriel was already sitting in Lucifer’s van, a grin on his face when he saw his little brother. “Cassie! Hey!”
"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Charlie." Dean mused, holding out his hand to shake Dorothy's. Dorothy smiled and shook his hand, her brown hair bouncing slightly.
Cas softly blinked as the light began to slowly stream into the room. It was early morning, only six or seven am- Cas wasn’t sure. He didn’t usually bother glancing at the clock- time wasn’t something excessively important to him, unless whatever he was doing was time-centered.
“She's my adoptive mom.” Charlie explained, a small smile still present on her face. “My real parents… they got into an accident when I was 12. Karen and her husband adopted me.” She tilted her head, ignoring the shocked expressions Sam and Dean both wore. “Was that your dad?”
“Won’t be a problem.” Michael replied with a smile, squeezing his eyes shut as Lucifer placed a kiss onto his cheek.
“Got it.” Kevin replied, handing the drunk Dean off to Sam.
Cas bit his lip awkwardly, sensing not to press the matter further, and turned his head. "My family loves Halloween. My eldest brother always went all out for the holiday, he helped my parents decorate the house since he was 9."
“Clearly, you’re not if you’re falling for a guy.”
As Dean did so, Cas slowly drifted off to sleep, and soon, Dean found Cas's head resting on his shoulder. Dean would've moved him, but Cas looked rather peaceful sleeping, and something in Dean told him to not disturb Cas. So, he didn't. Instead, he took one of his two jackets off and laid it over Cas like a blanket. And not even an hour later, Dean had fallen asleep with his own head leaning against Cas.
Cas nodded. “So, I just gotta keep watch for someone with green eyes?”
"I was talking to my friend Meg." Cas replied. "I've known her since ninth grade. She moved to Ohio last year, so I can only talk to her through phone calls and texts."
“I still don't understand why you couldn’t come in with us.” Balthazar complained, setting two bags down in the backseat.
~~~~~
All of a sudden, a yelp was heard from the opposite side of the lunch room, followed by roars of laughter. Dean and Sam both lifted their heads, confused. Charlie glanced up for a brief second and clicked her tongue.
Jo nodded as Sam pulled off the grass and rolled the Impala down the street. As he got going, he didn’t even glance back at the house where his soulmate stayed. He’d think about it more in the morning. For now, he just wanted to get home and sleep.
“Lucifer will drive half of us and Gabriel will drive the other half. So we get to choose whose car we go in.” Anael explained, setting down her empty milk glass. “I’m going with Lucifer.”
"Dean, there's more tanks if you want to see them." Cas spoke, and Dean's head whirled around. Cas held back a laugh at how quickly he had caught Dean's attention.
“Alright. I’ll pick you up in half an hour.” Dean then hung up and turned to face Cas. “My friend got dumped, so I’m gonna need to take her out today to cheer her up.”
“I do too.” Charlie said with a laugh. “My mom, she hates Led Zeppelin. She always complains if I play them in my car. Of course, she doesn't even have to go in my car since she has her own, but I guess she likes to judge my music taste.”
Dean's second class of the day was chemistry, and after that was lunch. Dean sat at a lone table during lunch, in the ginormous campus cafeteria. Many people sat outside, chattering amongst themselves. Dean saw no reason to go outside and sit in the hot sun, so he stayed inside in the air conditioning. Lunch lasted for an hour, and Dean finished his food rather quickly, so he just looked on his phone for most of the time.
By the time all the pets were put up, both Gabriel and Samandriel had finished their breakfast. As they put their plates in the sink, Gabriel grabbed his car keys right as Lucifer walked out the door with Hannah and Anael.
“You sure bought a lot.” Dean commented as he watched Cas struggle to put his bags away. Cas let out a wry laugh.
Dean nodded, stood up and stretched his legs.  He took the first opportunity he could to slap his face, chastising himself. He couldn't be falling, not this quickly, and not for a guy. Hell no. There was no way.
Cas shrugged his shoulders, picking up his bag before turning to face Dean. "Well, everyone in my family was surprised when he became a business major."
She pursed her lips and sighed. “If you don’t want to pay too much attention to finding your soulmate, I won’t force you to, Dean. But I will try to help if I can. Okay?”
Cas shrugged and nodded. “Your hair’s gold.”
Benny’s eyes widened, and Jo stared at him, starstruck.
“Dude, that’s cool. I wish I could meet my soulmate.”
The girl nodded and walked back to the first floor with them. “Alright. Well then, I wish you luck in your search.”
Dean nodded and took a butterfinger from the bag, unwrapping the candy bar. As he bit into it, Charlie began typing eagerly on her phone, a smile on her face.
The singing started right after that. Dean led the others in a gusto, and Cas blinked at the taller man’s singing voice. He tuned out every other voice in the room, only focusing on Dean’s.
“It’s not mine. Have you seen any other phones?”
A waitress came over, introduced herself as Shaye and took both their orders. Once she walked off with her notepad in hand, Dean turned to face
“Seriously?”
Dean almost instantly sprung up at the sound of french toast and pizza, causing Sam to whip his hand over his mouth to stop himself from laughing. Dean caught the small burst of contained laughter and fixed himself, hiding his excitement before yawning and patting his hair down.
“You guys got your schedules?” When everyone nodded, Gabriel held his own up. “I got English 4 first, what about you guys?”
“What luck!” The boy exclaimed slurredly, tilting his head. “I was hoping to find a hot person here.”
"My brother Lucifer got me into it." Cas continued with a shrug, taking the remote and flipping through the channels. "Are you not a fan?"
Once all his classes were finished, he collapsed in his dorm room. His roommate was not back yet, so Dean hooked his headphones into his phone, blasted his music through the headphones and danced for a bit, before he ultimately fell asleep, music still playing, but much softer.
Dean nodded, and Bobby closed the door behind him, leaving Dean to get ready for the day, which he did. Dean pulled on the plaid shirt and put a jacket on over it- his hand-me-down leather jacket, in fact, which was one of the only positive memories he had of his father.
To Cas’s surprise, it was already 11 am by the time he had been dragged downstairs. So, while the cake and cards were for later, Becky did have a birthday breakfast and Cas and Balthazar’s favorites- delicious buttermilk waffles and maple syrup with cinnamon rolls for Cas, and lemon scones with a small bit of strawberry shortcake on the side for Balthazar. All the dishes had been expertly made by Becky, who was actually a pretty good cook and always made birthday breakfast meals everytime there was a birthday.
The second bell rang loudly, and the teacher took the opportunity to close the door.
Michael nodded and began typing away at the computer once again.
“Are they?”
Lucifer finally came downstairs just moments after Anael ran upstairs, and he was followed by Hannah and Anna, both of whom were dressed and ready to go. As the three descended the stairs, Hannah grabbed Coffee, who was sitting on the fourth stair, and took her back to her room to put her up. Anna grabbed her own cat, Quinn, and put her up as well.
Cas let out a small laugh, and nodded. “That is true.”
“Ooh, what part of Kansas?”
Cas waved goodbye and took off to his first class of the day, and Dean walked off to his first class of the day, Calculus. Not too long after he sat down, a redhead girl appeared next to him.
"Ooh, so you're gonna be drawing blood from people for a living?" Dorothy asked, and Benny nodded.
Being roommates, Cas had managed to get a glimpse of a scar or two on Dean's skin, but he was smart enough to keep quiet and never ask anything. Cas had his own experiences with violence that he too would rather not relive.
“18.56.” She spoke, holding her hand out. Dean gave her a twenty dollar bill, and she almost immediately dispensed it into the register and pulled out a dollar bill and some coins. “Have a nice day sir.”
Charlie held up a french fry and bit into it. “Yeah, otherwise known as the infamous Gabriel Novak. People call him the trickster because he pulls a lot of pranks. We’d have called him the prankster, but apparently he prefers the title of trickster.”
Cas nodded, and Dean, intrigued, looked at Anna. "Who's Michael?"
Jess tucked her pencil away in her pencil bag, before glancing back at Sam. “I have culinary.”
It was tiny with bad plumbing and the constant smell of cats, but Dean managed to live there just fine. Any place with his brother but without his father was an amazing place indeed.
“Your party? Oh, right, your party.”
“Alrighty. I’m gonna duck back into my dorm and change into a more Halloween-y outfit, that alright with you?” When Dean and Cas both nodded, Charlie smiled and ran back to her dorm. When she reemerged, she was dressed in an orange, decorative sweater with a pumpkin wearing sunglasses on it. Her pants were black with purple spiderwebs, and she wore purple sneakers. Some of her hair was pulled back and held by a purple spider hair clip. Overall, she looked to be right out of a Halloween ad.
“Yeah, but I don’t remember anything else.” Dean remarked, glancing at his brother. “Just the color blue. I can’t even remember
“Alright! Let them have cake!” Dean cried, taking the knife to slice through the cake. He handed a generous slice to Cas, who took it without question, not even considering his lack of ability to taste anything. Cas took a fork and brought it to his mouth, taking slices of the cake without thought.
"Yeah, let's go. And let's take my car." Dean replied, turning to face Cas. Cas nodded, and Dean grabbed his keys.
Lucifer nodded and held up a list. “Should I add anything else?”
Speaking of his brother, Dean peeked his head into Sam’s room, only to see Sam sleeping soundly in his bed. Dean smiled and quietly closed the door, before turning his attention to the kitchen.
“4:30.”
Michael frowned. “Tall with brown hair? That’s not a lot to go on.”
~~~~~
Sam sat silent, munching away at his food. He agreed with Dean, Charlie’s eyes were very pretty, but he stayed silent as he didn't yet want them to know that he could see colors. He had seen Charlie in action, and he wasn’t sure he could hide the identity of his soulmate for long- especially since he hadn’t been drunk and therefore had no excuse.
About five minutes before the bell rang, a girl with light-colored hair approached Sam. When he glanced up to look at her, she smiled pleasantly and held out her hand.
Cas shook his head, a small smile curving onto his mouth. "Your food isn't going anywhere. It's not going to disappear if you don't eat it within two minutes."
“Dean! Get your butt up, you have school today!”
Dean sought for a plaid shirt in JC Penny’s, taking to the men's section. Sam loved red, so Dean grabbed a red and black plaid shirt and took it to the cash register. The woman working there lifted her head and almost immediately smiled, as though it was rehearsed. She held her hand out and took the plaid shirt, placing it onto the table. She scanned it and lifted her head up once more.
“I don’t feel the need to, or at least now right now, when it’s barely an hour into the party. Why waste most of the party blackout drunk, right?” She took a sip of the drink in her hand, before holding it up. “Cherry coke. Thankfully most of the sodas haven’t been spiked yet. Do beware of the punch, though.”
~~~~~
“Dean Winchester.”
Both Sam and Dean nodded eagerly, so Charlie led them to a table near the windows, which was apparently her usual table. Two people were already sitting there, chatting happily to one another. When Charlie sat down with Sam and Dean, the two people at the table turned their heads.
“Dean.” Charlie spoke, her voice calm yet scary. “Look, if you’re falling for someone of the same sex, that means you aren’t straight. You could be gay, bi or pan. Hell, you could even be polysexual, but you sure as hell aren’t straight. And Dean, dude, I love you but you better damn not pull that internalized homophobia shit on me. There’s nothing wrong with liking someone of the same sex.”
“Quiet morning, hm?” Asked Charlie as the girl led them into the basement.
"Yes." Dean replied grudgingly, laying on his side in an attempt to get comfortable again.
He drove to the closest restaurant, which was a McDonalds. There he ordered two big macs and a coke, all of which he wolfed down extremely quickly. Despite wolfing it all down, he managed to savor every bite he took. He wasn't used to eating this much food at once. He was so happy to finally have money of his own for food, money that he could use to buy actual meals rather than the occasional snack and spaghetti fixings. It didn't take Dean long to be finished with his food, and once he was, he threw all his garbage away and drove back to the University.
Dean was in front of the tank in an instant. The tank was full of some saltwater fish, nothing too intriguing, but Dean seemed enamored enough by it. Cas smiled; Dean seemed so awestruck and amazed by something so simple as a saltwater fishtank. It was.... almost amusing.
“Oh, I was just wondering what you put as your favorite show.” She replied, “I put Sherlock down as mine.”
Sam sighed as he and Jo pushed drunk Dean and Charlie into the back seats. “Of course they got drunk.”
Even so, there was much Cas didn’t understand, and much that still piqued his curiosity. It came to a head that morning, when he walked into the kitchen to an array of shouts and cheers.
"Mm, AHS. I need to finish off Coven." Cas said, sitting down on the couch.
I realized as I was uploading this that they were supposed to pick Charlie up at a McDonalds and not her dorm, so oops
Dean laughed. “Well, you’re gonna have a hella hard time with me as a roommate. I can't clean or keep my stuff neat for shit.”
“Says the AHS stan.” Gabriel shot a glance at Cas, raising both of his brows.
Dean got back to the dorm late that night, after spending an entire day with Charlie to cheer her up. After getting her hair cut and nearly buying out an entire Hot Topic, Dean was satisfied that he had cheered her up.
"Sweet! I love burgers." Dean remarked, sitting down at the table. Cas placed a glass of water down next to Dean before he sat down in his own seat. Dean took a large bite out of his burger, and continued to munch hungrily. Cas, however, ate slowly, taking time to sneak in small conversation with Dean.
Bobby carried both suitcases up the carpeted wooden stairs in the foyer and up onto the carpeted second floor. Sam and Dean were both fighting over which room they got, as both of them wanted the upstairs master bedroom, which was the larger of the two upstairs bedrooms.
“Of course boy, and you don't need to thank me. That's what I’m here for, right? Now you go home and buy you and your brother some food.”
I managed to whip this up over two days so it's probably poor quality so forgive me! I'm in Japan at the moment and my brain is fried, so I do apologize if this chapter is bad. Anyways, please enjoy! Sorry for the wait!
“How did you get the Tiësto and Icona Pop song?”
“Charlie? What's the matter?” Dean asked worriedly.
Dean eased the car out of the driveway, and once he rolled back onto the road, he drove off towards the school, leaving the house behind.
The bell rang right after that, and the art teacher stood in front of the class and began to talk. She had them do a simple thing- draw a sketch of themselves and personalize it by adding little symbols of things they liked. She handed out colored pencils, and although neither Sam, Dean nor Charlie could tell what color they were by looking at them, they used the pencils nonetheless by reading the color from the side.
“Ah, so she is.” Jo paused. “That’s weird. She doesn’t go in the lunch line much.”
Cas shook his head as a small smile crept onto his lips. "Alright. I'll be back in half an hour." Dean smiled and nodded, and Cas stepped out the door.
“Nothing you can’t handle, hm?” She remarked with a laugh. Her attention then turned to Dean and Charlie, who waved. “These are the friends you brought with you?” When Cas nodded, the woman smiled and shook Dean and Charlie’s hands. “The name’s Becky Novak. I’m Castiel’s mother.”
“Gabriel! Good morning sweetheart, I made your favorite.” She held up a plate and put it down in front of him as soon as he sat down. As he took the plate and cut his waffles, Becky gave a kind smile. “If you want, you can stay home today. It is your birthday, after all. You don’t turn 18 every day.”
Cas has a nightmare and reminisces on a dark moment from high school
“That’s good. You think you can get it to one hundred or so songs by ten tonight?”
“I’ll help too. Can’t have my twin bro being all lonely when his soulmate is out there.” Balthazar announced, wrapping his arm around Cas’s shoulder.
Cas nodded.
A few minutes passed, and Dean’s head snapped up when he abruptly heard footsteps. His eyes gazed up to see Charlie in front of him. She waved numbly before setting her bag down, and then she sat down, wiping a stray tear from her face. She had been crying quite a bit ever since Dorothy dumped her.
“That’s what I was going for.” She replied, a slight smirk settling on her lips. “Halloween’s one of my favorite days of the year. I figured I should show it. Anyways, since we have nearly two hours before that party starts, ya think we can stop somewhere for food? I haven’t had anything to eat since ten this morning.”
responsibility,
The waitress stopped by and handed Dean and Cas their food, and they continued talking over their pancakes and bacon.
Sam had been placed next to a kid named Andy, whom he had noticed on the first day, sitting in the back corner. When he sat down next to Andy, Andy didn't say anything.
“Hey Gemini,” Cas murmured, running a hand through her fur, “Good morning little girl.” She ruffled her fur in appreciation, giving a soft meow in response.
“Wow, Sammy. That’s really good!” He exclaimed, pausing his own painting for a brief moment.
“Oh, really? I’ve wanted to visit Kansas. My aunt lives there, but she always visits us instead of us visiting her.”
Dean turned and took Cas’s hands into his own, leading the angel over to the cake. Cas still only stared. Dean’s eyes fell onto his face, seemingly searching for something- Cas glanced at him for a moment, their eyes locking, and Dean pulled back, seemingly having found whatever he was looking for.
“Here. Wear this.”
“You met your soulmate?” Jo pressed her hands against the table, leaning over it as she stared at Dean.
Sam nodded. “He is.”
human,
Gabriel certainly wasn’t expecting to be woken up on Monday morning to a pillow thrown at his face, but that’s exactly what he got. After he spluttered awake, he lifted his eyes to see a laughing Balthazar and a grinning Claire.
It took Sam a second to process the question, or the fact that someone was speaking to him. By the time he looked up, Andy was staring at him, a look of concern visible on his face.
“Yeah, yeah, I know. It’d be nice if we didn’t have to get all this shit every year, though. I always wonder how Lucifer pays for it.”
“Cas! Hey, there you are. Mom made waffles for breakfast.” Balthazar exclaimed, pushing a plate of waffles towards Cas as he sat down. Cas took the plate, drizzled some syrup over it and took a bite.
“I don’t see why we have to be twenty five minutes late.” Dean grumbled as he pulled at a stubborn strand of hair. “Why can't we just head over now?”
Dean set his bag down and sighed as he sat. He stretched a little, letting the muscles he didn't even know were tense relax. And man, did that feel nice. He then pulled out his phone and checked to see if he had gotten any messages from Sam yet. None. Dean quickly typed a little ‘good morning’ to Sam before stuffing his phone away to lay his head down.
Sure enough, the boy stood and glanced at both of them, introducing himself as Ash.
“8 pm.” Cas responded, drawing Charlie’s attention. She turned to face him, and nodded.
"Haven't you been to an aquarium before?" Anna questioned, tilting her head.
Lucifer ducked, but it wasn’t long before Balthazar was chasing Lucifer up the stairs, trying adamantly to hit him over the head with the DVD while Becky tried to stop them and Chuck just sighed and ignored it. Becky ran up the stairs after them, crying their names, as Chuck just turned back to Cas and handed him a gift card to one of his and Balthazar’s favorite restaurants, Applebees.
And since the pandemic had come to a head and crawled over the world, the group had found themselves mostly locked inside- which none of them really protested, as it gave them time to ward the bunker securely and prepare for their upcoming fight.
Dean shook his hand a bit tersely. This guy wasn’t Dean’s dad, but he sure looked similar to him, and that put Dean on edge. The man, however, thankfully didn’t seem to notice Dean’s tenseness. “It’s nice to meet you too, Michael.” Dean finally spoke, and Michael nodded.
Balthazar groaned but heaved Cas, who was passed out on the couch, and carried him to his room. Hannah, meanwhile, took care of Anna and Anael, while Michael took care of Lucifer and Samandriel carried Gabriel. As soon as the drunks were all put to bed, Michael sighed and turned to the other 3, who were all standing next to the railing of the stairs.
Gradually, Cas introduced each of his siblings and his siblings friends to Dean. By the time Dean got all of their names, a knock came at the door and Gabriel walked in.
The TV was on in the main living room, playing the Avatar The Last Airbender series as Jack sat happily on the couch, holding his kitten Marble in his lap. He waved to them when they walked past him, pointing eagerly at the screen.
Cas and Dean soon finished off their food and climbed into the Impala, and Cas pulled up directions on his phone to the froyo place. Cas then read off the directions to Dean, and they quickly reached the froyo place. They both got out of the car, closing the doors in sync, and together they walked up to the building.
“Mr. Lester? Lucky, he's one of the nicest teachers. I got stuck with the mean English teacher my first year.” Gabriel remarked. “What lunch periods do you all have?”
Dean fell onto his bed and stretched, spreading his limbs out as he sighed in content. He couldn't remember a happier time.
"That's nice, it's good you two get along." Benny commented, turning his head to face left. "My class is right here, so I'll see you at lunch, brother."
Dean patted Sam on the back again. “Now go on to your geometry class.”
“It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Winchester. My name’s Karen Bradbury, I’m Charlie’s mother.”
"You ready?" Cas questioned, gazing at Dean, who had his back turned. Dean nodded, grabbing his phone.
“Alright, well, I’m up.” Gabriel groaned, rubbing his face into his pillow. He then shifted onto his side as Balthazar and Claire finally left his room.
“Sorry, no.” Cas replied, setting his backpack on the floor. “Can you play a Studio Killers or Mystery Skulls song?”
"I'm majoring in Creative Writing, so my first class is creative nonfiction." Cas replied, glancing at his schedule. "What about you?"
Dean huffed but unscrewed the cap of the water bottle and drank some of the water inside. The water was crisp against his dry throat, which he hadn't even realized was dry and sore until he began drinking the water. He nearly drank half the bottle before he stopped himself.
Dean paused for a moment, collecting his thoughts. “Wow, straight to the point.”
First official chapter should be up around mid-late June!
Words replayed over and over as Castiel watched Dean, watched him go into fight or flight mode. Dozens of emotions that Castiel couldn’t name flooded through him as they grabbed Dean and led him to the dungeon.
“Chuck, it's been a while. How’s that writing job treating you?”
Even Cas had let out a chuckle. It was then that they heard a crash and a scream, followed by another crash and another scream. They soon realized that Lucifer had yet again jumped out of his window and took off down the street, while Balthazar jumped out after him all while Becky screamed after them.
When he finally went downstairs to have breakfast, he saw breakfast was eggs and bacon, courtesy of Becky. Cas was the last person downstairs that morning, so he settled for a piece of bacon and one forkful of scrambled eggs before grabbing his backpack. A few of his siblings were still waiting by the door as Gabriel and Lucifer got dressed upstairs. Cas joined them and stood by the door, scrolling away on his phone while he waited.
“Oh no, I don’t think you’re bragging.”
Dean and Cas talk a bit about breakfast. Dean, to his dismay, begins to fall in love.
"Huh. Your family must've been one busy one, then." Anna remarked, placing a hand gently on the glass of the tank. She peered in, her attention caught by one of the more colorful fish.
“I’m sure someone’ll point you in the right direction.”
“What party?”
Sam’s next class was Law Studies, and the teacher, a really tall man with dark hair and a british accent, stood in front of the class and announced the assigned seats.
sorry this took so long to update, i went to jaxcon in november, had my wisdom teeth out the following week and then had exams. on the plus side, i met jensen, jared, misha, rich, rob, matt, kim, bri, rachel, emily and jeffrey!! rich even signed my drawing of him and wrote birthday buddies on it since i told him we share a birthday (sept. 4th)  :D
“It is. I trust life is well for you too, Rowena?”
“Cas and Gabe can see color!”
Sam nodded and grabbed a paintbrush and some paint bottles, not bothering to look at the labels. Dean also grabbed a paintbrush and a few bottles of paint, also not looking at the labels. Sam quickly realized this mistake, but thankfully neither Dean nor Charlie seemed to notice that he had grabbed the correct colors without even glancing at the labels.
Cas chuckled. "Well, any type of engineering requires math."
"Tired?" Dean remarked, glancing at Cas. Cas nodded and yawned a second time.
“Are you okay?” She asked raspily. Her voice sounded odd- and Sam instantly figured out that she must be deaf.
"I have dinner with Michael at 6, so we have to leave by 4, alright?"
He groaned again and hung his head. “Just fantastic. It wasn’t a dream.” He pulled the blanket off of himself, letting his feet rest on the unbelievably soft floor rug for a fleeting moment before finally standing up to face the day.
And then Dean stepped forward. Wordlessly. Cas stared at him, eyes wide with both shock and anticipation.
“Happy birthday Cas!” Cried the cascade of voices, and it took a few moments before Cas recognized the voices to be belonging to all those who had taken residence in the bunker. There stood Dean, Sam, Eileen and Jack, all smiling as they stood in a kitchen that Cas suddenly realized was decorated.
“In my family, there’s no such thing as a lot. You should see our tree.” He shook his head a little as he pushed the final bag into the back, straining a little. “I don't know how we always afford all those presents at Christmas.”
“You ready to go home, lil bro?” Gabriel asked, glancing eagerly at Cas, who just nodded plainly. “Alrighty. Let's go!”
"What about your parents?"
pizza night friday, but I’m guessing you don’t want that.”
justified, but I still won’t give him the gift card.”
“I’ll stay home.” Gabriel replied, after a few moments of thought.
~~~~~
His eyes began to scour the crowds, spotting families with young children and couples holding hands. It suddenly made Dean very grateful he had Cas next to him, though a bit resentful that he couldn't hold hands with Cas like he wanted. As Cas pointed out a few of the otters, Dean laughed, and Anna watched with a sort of curiosity from where she was.
Jo tilted her head and paused, placing her snack bar down. “You two are from Kansas?” When Dean nodded, Jo tilted her head again. “I was born in Kansas. My mom and I lived in Kansas City for a few years, until my dad died, and we moved out here.”
Dean chuckled softly at the sight before turning his attention back to the table of snacks. There was chips and dips, cookies, a half empty plate of pigs in a blanket, an almost entirely ignored bowl of fruit, bowls of trail mix, a plate full of pretzels and an almost empty plate of pizza rolls- a pretty impressive display, if Dean said so himself. Then again, he rarely ever attended high school parties, so perhaps it wasn’t all that impressive.
Bobby shook his hand. “Ah, don't thank me boy. Put that on and get ready so you aren't late for your first day. You still gotta get your schedule, don't forget.”
Dean and Cas climbed into Dean's car, and Dean began driving to the aquarium, Cas guiding him down the correct streets.
Dean smiled at the simple text, stowing his phone away as he waited for a waitress so that he could pay for his food.
And so, on one Sunday morning, that’s exactly what they did.
"Pancakes, whenever my mom would fix them." Cas explained. "Occasionally waffles or cereal. My family wasn't big on breakfast when I was growing up."
Bobby looked up at Dean from his seat as Dean grabbed all of his things. “Sam’ll love that.”
Michael and Anna turned their heads and stared at Cas, who sunk into Balthazar’s arms in shame.
Dean woke up at 4 that afternoon, his dorm room still empty. His phone had died and his music had ceased, so he plugged his phone in to charge, and then pulled his homework out. His homework took him an entire hour to do, during which not even a knock came on the door of the dorm. Dean finished his homework at a quarter past five, when his phone began to rang. He checked his phone, smiled when he saw his brother's name as the caller ID, and picked up.
Gabriel tossed his head and downed another forkful of waffle.
Dean probably shouldn’t have ditched Sam so early into the party, but Dean needed food, and it’d probably be hard for the two of them to stick together the entire time, given how huge they both were. At least, that’s what Dean told himself as he walked to the dining room, where a table full of snacks laid.
The three of them reached Charlie’s house rather quick, as she lived a mere six minutes away from them. Charlie lived in a rather pretty, quaint little house- it was a single story house in a roundabout, with a pretty driveway and flowers alongside the walkway- ones Bobby guessed were some type of rose. A dark-colored sedan sat in the driveway, one they guessed belonged to her parents.
Cas's brother Gabriel swung by the dorm about once every three-four days, averaging one-two times a week. Dean didn't particularly like Gabriel, as something in Gabriel's personality just irritated Dean, but he never said anything. He figured it best to leave his pet peeves in silence; living with his father his entire life had more than taught him to never bring up something that could turn into an argument. Dean had had enough arguments in his life end physically, and he didn't want anymore of those.
“Mom’s going to stay home and watch after you, so she wants you to go back to bed. Meanwhile, I’m gonna go get dressed so I can go to school.”
“Our friend Charlie’s house,” Sam replied with a smile, “she’s gonna introduce us to some friends of hers.”
i am so so sorry for the long ass wait!!! motivation is a bitch. as an apology, i present to you: a 4600 word chapter. enjoy!
“Green eyes definitely sounds more plausible.” Chirped Samandriel, who had been keeping relatively quiet the whole time. “But it’s still a rare eye color.”
“American Horror Story for me,” Dean held up his paper so that Charlie could clearly see it, “But I’ve been meaning to watch Sherlock. I just got Netflix, so I should be able to watch it on there.”
Sam took a brief moment to ponder the question, sincerely considering his options. Eventually, against his better judgement, he found himself nodding.
Small streamers littered the cabinets and walls, sparse in their placement. A banner was strung along the height of the ceiling, plastered with the words “Happy Birthday” in neat multicolored letters. Colored cups sat along the tables, along with what Cas noticed was a neatly decorated cake. Plates were scattered next to it, along with utensils and cards.
Sam paused petting Arizona and nodded eagerly, clasping the straps of his backpack, which, like his pencil pouch, was Harry Potter themed. “Yep! I’m ready!”
“Gold? Ooh. Does that mean I’m pretty?” The boy gave a drunken giggle. “I’m Gabe Novak.”
Dean nodded, glancing briefly towards the window. Cas caught himself staring for a second too long and tugged his attention back to cooking waffles before Dean could notice Cas had been staring.
“It could be something about their appearance.” Sam suggested. “Probably whatever you noticed first about them, like their eyes or something they were wearing.”
Charlie nodded. “Seriously. No one knows why he hasn’t been suspended for a prank yet, but there’s a rumor his aunt is the principal.”
The boy smiled at that, and before Cas could even process it, the boy’s lips were on his.
Dean groaned, grabbing the bag of school supplies he had prepared. "Yeah, that's the shitty thing." Dean sighed, and suddenly turned to face Cas. "What's your brother Gabriel majoring in?"
When he reached his geometry class, it was mostly empty, given how early he was. The teacher, a somewhat tall man with dark hair, placed a calculator at Sam’s desk, before placing a calculator at every other desk in the room.
Soon enough though, a boy came into the room with beers, and Dean, ignoring all rational thought, began to drink as the movie played on.
“You must be Dean.” Spoke one of those people, a short, blue eyed man with a crinkled smile. Dean nodded, and the man smiled even wider. “The name’s Chuck Novak. I’m Castiel’s father.”
Dean still had a somewhat upset look on his face, and Cas, while not incredibly perceptive, quickly picked up on it.
“Well too bad. Suck it up buttercup!” She exclaimed, giving him a pat on the shoulder.
After Jack and Gavin, the cake was passed around the room. Gabriel took perhaps the largest slice, being so sugar-addicted. Lucifer also got a larger slice, mainly because he didn’t want Gabriel’s dramatically big slice to outshine him.
he ate breakfast, so as to not just clean them and then get food remnants on them.
Then, without warning, Charlie grabbed Jo’s hand and whirled to face the brothers. “Imma take Jo and find the dance floor. See ya ‘round 3!” And with that, she took off with Jo up the stairs.
“True that.” Came a voice suddenly, and Sam turned to see the dark haired girl that Jess often stuck with. As he locked eyes with her, something registered in her dark eyes, and she raised her brows. “Oh, you’re Sam, right? The name’s Ruby.”
Cas nodded, and grabbed his wallet. "I'm going out to get some more food. You want anything?"
“Dorothy dumped me.” Charlie sobbed, her voice breaking. “Can- can you please take me somewhere today? I need to get my mind off of her.”
She sighed. “Okay, okay. I’ve narrowed down the list I got of the names of the kids at the party. There’s only like twenty names left that I haven’t checked off.”
“Is it possible that we can get a list of some guests as well?” Sam asked, tilting his head. “Just in case someone stole his phone, ya know.”
“Nice to meet you Gabe, but I’ve got to go.” Sam explained hurriedly, before pushing past the boy and hurrying downstairs.
Dean drove and drove and drove until he finally reached the girls dorms, and he parked in the parking lot and slid out of the car. As soon as he did, he heard a voice yell his name, followed by a blur of red and suddenly he was engulfed in an embrace. Charlie wrapped her arms around him and sobbed, and Dean ran his hand through her hair and on her back, trying to calm her down. He managed to coax her into the car, and her crying slowed. Dean handed her a couple tissues and she sniffed pitifully.
“So, spot anyone who looks like they could be my soulmate?” Gabriel questioned as Cas, Balthazar and Samandriel loaded into his car.
The full party was mainly taking place in the dining room, pool deck, basement and attic, so there was little reason for anyone to be in the foyer- except for the boy that had let them in, who seemed oddly entertained despite doing nothing but standing and waiting for more people to arrive.
~~~~~
~~~~~
“Ay Samandriel, Balth and Hannah, help me get the others into their beds.”
The teacher handed each of them a 8.5 by 11 inch canvas, and each student quickly put it on their easels. Charlie was the first of the three of them to paint, as she dipped her brush into the green and began painting the landscape. Sam dipped his brush into the green as well and started painting a landscape, while Dean just dipped his into the yellow and started to paint a sun.
Cas cocked his head, then turned to glance back over the posters. “I’m sure we’ll get along just fine.” He remarked, not entirely focused on any one thing in that moment.
As he savored the delicious taste of fluffy buttermilk waffles and homemade syrup, Sam finished his own plate and put it into the sink with a clatter before rinsing it off with water. Sam then got a drink and downed his morning pill- a pill prescribed to both Sam and Dean, to combat anxiety and stress. When Sam downed his, he took Dean’s pill into his hand and handed it to Dean, who downed it as soon as he finished eating his own plate of waffles.
“What was what?” Jo asked, peering at Benny.
“Alright, well, we have to go together, since today's both of our birthdays, so I’ll wait outside.” Balthazar remarked, holding the door open as Claire and Hannah walked out. Once they both left, Balthazar walked out into the hall and closed the door behind him.
Once all the bags were safely tucked in the car, Dean began to drive. By then, the streets were a bit more empty, and the drive back to the dorms was peaceful.
“We moved from Kansas.” Dean replied.
His third period was Math with a teacher named Mr. Saunders, who was also pretty entertaining. Mr. Saunders had started off the class pointing his pointer finger at a kid who had walked in tapping away at his phone, then ended the class with a whoop.
Over the course of the next half hour, Cas’s two missing siblings, Anna and Balthazar, both showed up. Once everyone was at the house, the party went into full-swing. Music blared, a few people danced and the others talked.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief. “Yes, please. I barely understand any of this.”
Samandriel nodded and typed eagerly away on the computer. “Noted.”
“Oh- oh, yeah, sorry.” Sam replied, dragging himself out of his trance. He quickly realized how weird he must’ve looked- staring absentmindedly at a blank piece of notebook paper, dragging his pencil along lazily with no real direction or goal- and snapped his notebook closed, almost without thinking.
Lucifer cocked a brow. “Do you
Cas tilted his head. "My brother? He's majoring in business. He wants to own a candy shop someday." Cas glanced in the direction his brother had taken off in, and smiled. "My entire family thought he was crazy to pursue business. They said he should go for drama, or something like that. No one expected him to do so well as a business major, you see. But he's proving our family wrong. He loves it, though. He rubs it in everyone's faces at holidays, like 'look at me, I'm gonna graduate with a business degree'. It annoys most of our family."
She pursed her lips momentarily, her dark eyes glancing across his face as if to scan him. Sam didn’t really understand why, but her eyes ran all over his face for a little while. However, it didn’t last more then a few seconds, as she quickly unpursed her lips and closed them flatly. “Nice to meet you too.” And without another word, she turned and went back to her worksheet.
Balthazar scanned an eye over his own schedule. “Spanish 2 is first for me. Ha! I got Mr. Harrison!”
“A tall guy with brown hair.” Cas replied, checking the time on his phone. “I’m gonna head to my first period.”
a lil bit of a shorter chapter but it's not meant to have much happen. anyways, surprise! i know last time it took me two months to update, so have a lil gift! i don't know when the next chapter will be up, but i'm hoping by the end of the year. regardless, enjoy!
"Other than my brother? Not really. I just moved here a few weeks ago, I hardly know anybody." Dean remarked, sighing.
But how much was sacrificing yourself supposed to hurt?
~~~~~
Dean makes omelettes. Benny appears and Charlie gets a girlfriend. Dean and Cas both watch AHS.
“Good, good.” Chuck then turned to face Amara’s wife, who stood politely behind Amara. When Chuck held his hand out, she took it graciously.
Sam’s fourth and biggest class was Culinary, led by a teacher named Ms. Ramsumair. She explained that the first thing they were going to make was a simple one: pancakes. Sam got paired up with some kid that sat next to him, and the two worked tirelessly until their pancakes were finished. Right as they finished them, the bell rang, and everyone took off to their fifth period.
"Oh, you're into engineering too, then, huh?" Dean remarked, and Dorothy nodded.
It was 7:30 am, way too early for Dean to function, when he was shaken awake by a very eager Cas. There was a glow in his eyes- excitement, perhaps, or just pure, unadulterated joy.
He had tasked Samandriel, Gabriel, Michael and Castiel to making a giant joint playlist for the party, one that was long enough to play for six hours, minimum. A playlist that size meant at least 100 songs, which thankfully wasn't hard with a task force of four people putting songs in.
The door was almost instantly swung open by a tall, lanky boy with light hair and a v-neck shirt. “Ah! More guests! Welcome, welcome,” The boy cried joyously in a british accent, “Enjoy the party! And watch the punch, it’s already been spiked.”
Dean glanced up at Bobby with an inch of nervousness. “I, uh, met my soulmate last night. While I was blackout drunk. And now I can see colors, but I don’t even remember meeting them.”
Sure enough, Bobby had made the boys waffles, a surprisingly large mound of waffles that Dean wasn’t sure he could even finish. Then again, ever since they had come into Bobby’s care, they had never ended a single day without a full and happy belly.
Cas sighed but nodded, and picked up his phone to order some pizza.
Sam nodded in understanding and heaved his backpack up. “Thank you. Have a good day Dean.”
Gabriel opened his mouth to retort, but ultimately stayed quiet and stuffed his earbuds into his ears. Cas just smiled as Gabriel scrolled through YouTube to find a proper video to watch.
The two boys then took to walking around the house, exploring the three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen, two living rooms, the backyard, pool, and many other areas. The house wasn't particularly large, but it was a relatively new, modern house- having been built in 1986- and it was larger than their old house, so both brothers were perfectly happy with it. Plus, the backyard was actually pretty large, with a wrap-around fence and an open grassy area that led out to a very pretty lake.
“Yeah well,” Hannah shrugged, “Gabe turns 18 this year, so ‘pparently Aunt Amara decided he deserves his own special visit instead of sharing one with you two.”
“No, don't.” Balthazar sighed, taking his empty plate to the sink. “I’ll ride with you.”
“Alright. You ready for your first day of high school?” Questioned Dean, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel. Sam nodded eagerly, sitting up a little straighter as he stared at the house through the windshield.
“I know you said no money, but please take this.” Cas handed Dean five twenties. “Buy something for your brother.”
"Are you in love with my brother?"
Sam nodded right as the teacher began to tell the class what they were doing that day. Apparently, the teacher was to hand out a letter to home, then just explained the course and what they would be doing over the course of the school year. Sam listened intently to every word, eager to start the class. His dream was to become a lawyer, which was specifically why he had chosen this class in the first place.
The sound of waffles actually perked Dean up, so he shooed Sam out of his room so he could finish getting dressed. He tugged on a gray Star Wars shirt, a red flannel and a pair of jeans, patted his hair down, then headed downstairs.
Cas soon found his mom, Becky, brushing her hair in the cabana bathroom next to her bedroom, so Cas knocked on the open door to signal his presence. When she turned her head and her eyes met his, he spoke. “Hey mom, Jack’s not feeling well, says he has a fever and his head hurts. He wants to stay home today.”
"Bacon and egg omelette." Dean replied, holding up the pan to give Cas a little glimpse. "You want one?"
Dean hurried to change, putting on a new jacket and some jeans. He patted his hair a little, as it was sticking up some. When he came back out of the bathroom, Cas was typing on his phone. Cas lifted his head at the sound of the door opening, and a pleasant smile formed on his face, one that made Dean smile.
So far Dean had spent a little over $200, and most of it had been food; Cas usually bought food for the two of them, so Dean didn't have to pay for himself much.
“I’m Michael.” Said the man at Lucifer’s side. “Michael Milton. It’s nice to meet you, Dean.”
“Here you go.” Cas spoke, handing Dean a mug of hot chocolate. “Drink up. I have waffles made, too.” Dean took the mug and began to drink deeply. After a few seconds, Cas turned back to face Dean. “Oh, I have to visit my siblings today, so I’ll be back at ten or so tonight.”
Dean takes Charlie out to cheer her up. Cas gets picked up by his siblings and realizes something
“At the party.” Sam murmured, shyness evident in his tone. “It’s just.. I don’t know, I guess since you also found yours there, I felt it’d be awkward to say I also found mine. And I just wasn’t thinking. Shock, I guess.”
“Happy Halloween!” Charlie exclaimed, handing a small bag to Dean as soon as he sat down.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you.” Said the boy with a thick Louisiana accent. He held out his hand and Dean graciously took it. “You two new? I don't think I’ve seen you two ‘round here.”
Chuck yelled a simple “Okay!” in reply, so Becky turned and sent Cas back to his room, asking him to put Jack to bed.
"Castiel! There you are!" The woman exclaimed, running over to hug her younger brother. As she pulled away, she glanced at Dean. "Who's this?"
"You're my brother, I'd wake up at 6 am to talk to you."
Dean chuckled. "Well your brothers sound fun." Dean turned his focus back to the TV, trying to find a channel to watch.
Dean begrudgingly agreed, as long as Sam went along with them. Sam, who, unbeknownst to Dean, was still hiding the fact that he could see colors, agreed to go solely to help Dean- despite his own discomfort at the chance of running into Gabriel again. Perhaps he shouldn’t have been as uncomfortable- Gabriel was his soulmate after all- but Sam knew it would bring attention to him and he wasn’t yet sure if he wanted to have the spotlight on him.
“I don’t want people talking.”
“This is delicious!” Dean exclaimed as he ate a spoonful of the frozen yogurt.
Jess’s lips curved up into a shy smile and she tilted her head. “Really?”
“Good morning.” Came a voice, belonging to none other than Samandriel. He was still dressed in yesterday's clothes, but his hair was brushed neatly and he was holding a shirt in his hand. “What's for breakfast?”
“Happy birthday you two!” Chuck cried, hugging both boys. Alex barked relentlessly at his feet, but Chuck ignored him.
“By a few, he means ten.” The second boy laughed. “My name’s Gabriel. Your new grumpy roommate is my little brother, Castiel.”
“Sam, it’s Saturday.” Dean whined angrily, digging his face into his pillow. Sam tapped on the wall next to Dean’s door, taking a moment to admire Dean’s small assortment of posters. As he did so, Dean tugged his blanket back over himself and glanced at Sam. “Why are you waking me up so early on a Saturday?”
“We will, Bobby.” Sam replied with a smile.
“Hey, Sam, you alright?”
Cas nodded, catching on that Dean didn't want to say anything else.
"We're gonna live here?" Asked Sam incredulously, staring at the house in awe as he stepped out of the car.
“It’s one of my ways of finding your soulmate.” She remarked, fiddling with her food. “I’m going around to people and checking if they see color. Oh, but don’t worry! I’m very discreet, they don’t have any idea.”
Benny patted Dean’s shoulder. “Well, you’re a lucky one brother. Not many people can say they met their soulmate in high school.”
"Alright."
"It's nice to meet you too." Dean spoke, as she ran a hand through her hair. Anna gave him a sweet smile before turning to Cas.
“We didn’t keep track of exactly who was here, but I do believe Balthazar kept a decent list of who he saw walk in and out. I can try fetching that for you, I don’t know if it’ll be much help.”
Gabriel pulled out of the parking lot and made his way down the winding road. “Yeah, true. But patience has never been my strong suit.”
Realizing he didn't know what section was what, Dean turned his head and walked to the nearest employee. “Excuse me, where's the law section?”
many siblings.”
"My brothers have too much energy. I always get tired after visiting them, because they wind me up so much." Cas explained, leaning his head back.
He didn’t know exactly why he was so worried and caught up about his soulmate’s identity, given that he had been so adamant to find them. But something about his soulmate being an infamous trickster just deterred him. He wasn’t a fan of the attention that he knew would follow that revelation.
“I wouldn’t have minded! I thought you were super excited to meet your soulmate? Took you by surprise, I guess?” Dean wrapped an arm around Sam, briefly setting his paintbrush aside. “Do you know who they are?”
Dean dug the keys into the ignition, laughing when the car erupted to life with a familiar roar. It softened to a purr, one that was very comforting to both brothers.
“Yeah, yeah, I know.” Dean groaned, rolling onto his belly before lifting his hand to flip Sam off. Sam cried out a familiar “Jerk!” before he closed Dean’s door, drowning out the “Bitch!” that followed.
"Hey, I have a shift at McDonalds tonight, I won't be back until 10."
Bobby just shook his head and waved Sam and Dean off towards the dining area. “No need to thank me, boy. You two eat up so you can head to school.”
The calculators ended up being just so that the teacher could explain how they were used and what for.
“If you’re going to keep that up, you can help the others with the decorations.”
“Freak Show for me,” Charlie put her paper down and zipped her Doctor Who pencil pouch up, “But Asylum is a close second.”
Their actual birthday party with their friends had been the day prior, since it had been a Saturday, so today was much more relaxed. As soon as the boys finished their breakfasts, they sat on the couch and watched the movie eagerly. While the two boys
Cas nodded, but rubbed at his eyes as his vision began to blur. Unfortunately for Cas, he was very much a lightweight- and a full cup of beer was more than enough to get him drunk.
“Morning Gabe! Happy Birthday!” Balthazar laughed, earning a small glare from Gabriel.
"I will let my brother know."
"Dean, this is my girlfriend, Dorothy. I invited her to sit with us."
"Thanks." Dean replied, taking a forkful of his own omelette.
“Yeah.” Dean admitted softly, lowering his eyes.
. Charlie exclaimed in joy while Jo and Benny both nodded approvingly. Sam, who actually didn't mind AC/DC, leaned his head against the window as he lip synced along to the song.
"I really like Coven so far. The historical aspect really lured me in, but the magic aspect is rather intriguing as well." Cas claimed, watching the episode intently. Dean murmured in agreement, his eyes trailing from the show to Cas and back to the show. And as Dean sat with his back against the couch, he felt peace. And he loved that feeling.
“Already?” Sam asked worriedly as they hurried inside, and the door was shut loudly behind them.
Cas tossed a bottle of water to Dean, and Dean caught it. "Take that, and drink it. You need to drink something other than soda."
Dean stifled a laugh, quickly covering his mouth with his open hand. Cas just sighed in mild exasperation.
“Oh shut the fuck up.” Snapped Lucifer.
When Cas opened the door, Jack was laying down on his bed, watching the TV adamantly. When Cas walked in, Jack turned his head and sat up a little, his large eyes watching Cas expectantly.
Hope y'all enjoy this prologue!
Dean nodded and waved goodbye to Benny, who walked off in the direction of his classes. Dean pulled out his phone, checking to make sure he wasn't late, then ran to his class. He got there just minutes shy of the class starting, and scrambled to find a good seat.
“I was born here, and I’ve never moved. I’ve just been living here all my life.” She tilted her head. “Where are you from? I’m guessing you’re new.”
I'm so sorry for such a long wait! I've been struggling with writers block, and I've also been trying to juggle writing around four-five stories at once (cuz I'm an idiot) but I'll hopefully get the next chapter out on time. I'm having a bit more ease writing chapter 7 though so it should be out on time.
Sam shrugged. “Not that well. I know a little.” His eyes met the girl’s eyes- a look of surprise and gratefulness barely evident. “I… someone I knew went mute for a short period of time. I had to learn sign language so I could easily talk to them.”
“I met my soulmate.”
Their new town was Sioux Falls, South Dakota- the place Bobby had once lived years prior, before moving to another state after the death of his wife. Bobby had decided to move both boys to his hometown, far away from their old hometown of Lawrence, Kansas. Neither of the boys had ever been to Sioux Falls, so neither of them knew much about it, other than what Bobby had told them- and they were excited to live there.
And so Sam found himself standing in the foyer, watching YouTube videos on his phone as he attempted to avoid the crowds of people passing through, and avoided eye contact with the door boy.
“I didn’t know you listened to Miss Amani.” Michael remarked, raising his eyebrows.
For Cas, he got a new computer and camera, some books and clothes, painting supplies and some new notebooks. Balthazar, meanwhile, got some new clothes, a camera, a cookbook, a DVD of songs by The Classic Crime, a Slytherin banner and a ‘my heart will go on’ DVD that he promptly chucked at Lucifer’s head.
Dean shook his head, setting a plate down on the table. "I was lucky just go get a costume. My family, we didn't celebrate Halloween much. We'd go trick or treating every couple of years, which I always enjoyed."
“Alright class,” Cried the art teacher the moment the bell rang, “Get into groups of three! You’ll be doing a small group project.”
As Cas snatched his plate back, Samandriel nodded and left the room to go change before he ate.
After cake of course came presents, and boy were the twins overwhelmed at the pile of presents waiting for them- approximately sixteen presents each. Most came from Chuck, Becky or their siblings, and 3 came from Amara and her wife.
There were many things Dean regretted in his life- not getting Sam that Harry Potter book for his tenth birthday, not turning that one science project in on time- but his latest regret was setting his morning alarm for 7 in the morning after staying up until 1 am.
“How were your first five classes?” Dean inquired, taking out a plastic spoon to eat his spaghetti with.
When Sam nodded, her lips curved into an even bigger and somehow even shyer smile. “Thanks. People tend to think I’m bragging.”
“Your hair. It’s blonde. Like ash blonde.”
When Michael returned with the list, Charlie thanked him and she walked with Sam and Dean to the kitchen. Inside the kitchen sat a small boy with light brown locks, next to a chattering girl with long red hair. As Charlie approached the two, the girl stopped and faced them.
Dean did manage to carve out enough time in his schedule to call his brother once a day and drive to visit his brother every weekend.
Jess then tilted her head again, glancing at Sam’s binder and then at him. “Oh, what’s your next class?”
“Did Lucifer make you drink?” Was the first thing that came out of Michael’s mouth the second Cas found refuge in the foyer, where Michael had been staying.
Cas set his own fork down for a brief moment. “I’ll go with Gabriel as well. He has Imagine Dragons in his playlist.”
There was a brief moment of silence to process what Dean had just said, but Charlie picked up on it first. She quickly stood up, her phone clattering to the floor as she stared at Dean in shock.
The boy chuckled and stood up, opting to sit next to Dean instead. “Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Castiel Novak, but everyone calls me Cas.”
Meanwhile, the two struck up a conversation about their respective classes while Dean played rock songs on low volume. Surprisingly, Cas didn't seem to mind the rock songs, and he actually nodded his head along to the rhythm.
Cas woke up the morning of the first day of school to a face full of fur. Spluttering, he almost immediately sat up, scaring his cat right off of his chest and sending her bounding across the room.
“Hey Bobby. I just got my dorm information, and I have to move in tomorrow, so Sam’s gonna have to stay with you for a while.”
"Do you like the fishtank?" Cas questioned, as if he couldn't already predict Dean's answer from his expression. Dean nodded eagerly, and Cas held back a chuckle at the raw curiosity and awe Dean had.
Charlie immediately held her hand out. “Hello Sam! It’s nice to meet you.”
The air in the froyo place, named Menchies, was crisp, cool and comforting. Dean welcomed the rush of cool air wholeheartedly, smiling as he walked towards the flavors on the back wall. Cas walked behind him, and began pointing out flavors to Dean. Dean eventually settled on dulche de leche (he was somewhat of a fan of caramel) and Cas picked out toasted marshmallow. The two moved to the table that held an array of toppings, picked out a few, then paid for their frozen yogurt.
"Alright!" Sam cried, "I'll call you every day until then."
Dean shook his head. “No, I do.” Cas blinked, and Dean took a shaky inhale of breath. “You’re not the only one who has things they’ve always wanted to say, Cas. You know, all these years I’ve watched you. All these years I’ve been by your side. I’ve fought for you, died for you. I don’t know how I didn’t realize it sooner. ”
Cas reached a hand out and grabbed a french crueler, biting into it joyfully. Dean, however, took a double chocolate donut with chocolate frosting while Gabriel grabbed a simple chocolate frosted with rainbow sprinkles. Gabriel, with his donut in hand, laid onto the couch, sitting with his legs spread out.
“I know a great frozen yogurt place near here, you wanna check it out?” Cas asked, and Dean’s head immediately jerked up. He nodded excitedly, and Cas smiled. “Alright.”
“Gemini!” He cried out, eyes landing on the black and white ragamuffin cat that was now sitting next to his door, pawing at it helplessly. “How many times have I told you to not wake me up like that?”
It didn't take long for Sam and Dean to notice how loud the halls were today- they usually were loud, but they seemed a lot louder than usual.
“Not really, I didn’t get a good look. But I remember he was tall and had short, medium-ish colored hair. Probably some shade of blonde or brown.”
Gabriel fake-barfed in the background as Lucifer then rushed off to take care of the snacks. Michael just gave Gabriel a quick “really” glare before turning back to the playlist.
“How are you going to do that?”
Dean nodded and took the bag with his purchase in it, and he clutched the bag in his hand. He then made his way to the next stop, which was Books a Million. Dean figured he’d find a law book there. Where better to find a book than a bookstore, right?
Cas rolled his eyes and let out a sigh towards his twin. “Do you even remember the face of the guy that made out with me?”
It was Dean’s favorite plaid shirt, one that Bobby had washed specifically so Dean could wear it today.
Samandriel once again typed away at the computer, picked a video that Cas pointed to, and put it in the playlist.
Dean turned his head, locking eyes with Cas. "Uh, sure. I've never been to an aquarium."
Dean hung up, then quickly texted his friend Charlie. 'I'm going to a party with my roommate tonight, and I'm allowed to bring one friend. Would you want to tag along?'
I'm so so so sorry for the lack of updates! I've been so busy writing my marvel series and I've hit a bit of a road block writing this story. This chapter is really short and hella crappy but I didn't want to make you guys wait any longer. Please forgive me, and thank you for being so patient  <3
Anna nearly fell over. “Are you fucking kidding me?? Michael! Michael you’ll never believe it!” She suddenly ran towards the stairs, waving her arms up. “Michael! Michael!”
Cas stood up, stretched, and walked to the kitchen, leaving Dean to mentally slap himself. "I'm craving pancakes, you wanna go to IHOP?"
“My name’s Charlie, this is Sam and Dean.” Charlie replied. “We’re looking for Dean’s phone. He lost it last night.”
“Dorothy?” Dean questioned, seeing the smile on Charlie’s face. Charlie laughed and tucked her phone away.
Once the waffle iron dinged, Cas opened it and laid out the waffle on a plate. He walked over and laid it on the table, where Dean had sat down. Cas placed a container of syrup down as well. Dean began to pour syrup onto his waffles until they were half-drowning in syrup. Dean then shoveled forkfuls of waffle into his mouth, not bothering to eat slowly. Even after being out of his father’s clutches for over five months, he still ate like the food would be thrown away if he didn't finish it in time.
Sam then walked out of the front door and walked hurriedly to the Impala, ignoring the boy’s drunken cries. Once he reached the Impala, he simply sat down on the grass and watched YouTube videos, trying avidly to pass the time and drown out any thoughts of Gabe or the color gold.
"I'm good," Benny replied, shrugging as he gripped his bag, "My roomie is giving me a whole lotta crap lately. He's an early bird, so he doesn't like that I'm a night owl." Benny turned, stopped for a quick second, and glanced at Dean. "How's your roommate? You two getting along?"
"Have you lived in Kansas your whole life?" Dean asked, tilting his head.
Gabriel whirled his head at Cas. “Wait, you can?”
“So,” Gabriel bit into his donut, “how’s your last weeks before finals treating you two?”
“If you're also in this room, then yes.” The boy replied, his voice slightly deeper than what Dean was expecting. A boy suddenly walked in behind the dark haired boy.
Charlie shrugged. “Still, his aunt being the principal sounds better.” She then grabbed a french fry and shoved it into Jo’s face. Jo took the french fry and threw it back at Charlie, who ducked and threw a fry back at Jo.
Dean grabbed the bag he had bought to carry his school stuff in, and piled his textbooks and pencils into it. He checked the clock, seven am.
I forgot to upload on the 20th but I had an exam every day during the entire week so forgive me. After this chapter, this version and the Wattpad version will have the same amount of chapters up, and they'll be uploaded in sync.
“Yes!” She turned her head, sighing. “Don’t you want to find your soulmate?”
Anna pointed a finger at Cas. “Cas can see color.”
The two boys walked around the aquarium for quite a while, Cas pointing out tanks while Dean would clamor over them. Cas nearly laughed a few times; it was far too amusing to watch Dean get so excited over something as simple as a fish tank. Then again, from what Dean had said so far of his interests and experiences, it seemed there was still a ton of things he hadn't yet done that most people had. Towards the end of the day, they bought some snacks and sat on a bench, eating and chatting. And both of them could agree that it had been an incredibly fun day.
By one am, however, he had been dragged back inside by a very drunk Lucifer, who slurred about how Cas needed to “enjoy himself” before handing him a cup of beer and slapping him on the back. Irritated but knowing Lucifer would just hunt him down later (Lucifer was surprisingly determined when drunk), Cas gulped down the drink, ignoring the horribly bitter taste. When he finished it off, Lucifer laughed, patted him on the back and ran off to some other part of the house, probably to force another one of their siblings to drink.
I'll try to write a bit of Charlie and Dorothy moments in this fic but I can't guarantee anything. Also, Dean can cook because why not
Cas nodded, his eyes lingering on Dean, who was still enamored by the fish in the tank.
Still, Cas enjoyed watching humans- the Winchesters in particular. The brothers were an intriguing case, even amongst the waves of humans Cas had encountered. He hadn’t ever shied away from his clear fascination and favoritism towards the two brothers, nor had they done the same. The brothers were kind, loyal humans, willing to stand up for others and fight for what is right, something Cas greatly admired. He had always been enamored with humans and the layers to them, but the Winchesters had only increased this factor.
Cas groaned tiredly and rolled over onto his side, wheezing as Claire shook him. She eventually jumped off of him and instead went over to Gemini and began stroking her fur, cooing at her while Cas stumbled awake.
"I know that, it's just you eat them almost every day. Don't you eat anything else for breakfast?"
By the time he got back, Cas had already returned from his family’s house, and was laying half-asleep on his bed. When Dean set his stuff down, the noise caused Cas to stir.
By the time the clock struck 3, Dean was completely wasted and surprisingly still standing. And by some miraculous string of luck, he was right by Kevin at the time, who was very eager to leave.
Sam nodded again, and his lips curved into a grin. “Lemme guess, you’ve been done for a few minutes?”
"They're Halloween decorations." Cas replied, peering at the paper bats and ghosts he had hung on the wall. "Don't you put up Halloween decorations at home?"
“Come in.” He called, running a hand through his hair. The door swung open to reveal, to no surprise, Sam. He stood there, wide-eyed, a smile on his face. “Now why are you so happy, Sammy? It’s a monday.”
“Don't worry about paying.” Cas took out his wallet and peered briefly into it. “I can cover you if you need anything extra.”
“Oh, I’m sorry,” The boy spoke, and Dean was taken aback by the boy’s voice, “Did you want to sit alone?”
It was quite cold that morning, something Dean loved. He had donned an old leather jacket his dad had given him, something that oddly was his most prized possession. Perhaps it was because the one thing he got completely to himself, the one thing that was his and his alone. It was the one thing that he had had his entire life.
Charlie lifted her hand and knocked three times on the door, and it was quickly swung open by a tall, lanky boy with dark hair and blue eyes.
“I’ll just get a list of everyone who was at the party.”
“What did his soulmate look like again?” Samandriel inquired, a confused expression on his face as he glanced at his brothers.
Monday rolls around, much to the chagrin of both the Novaks and the Winchesters. Sam and Dean meet two of Charlie's friends, and Lucifer begins planning something.
“I’m Garth!” Said the second boy, standing up to hug Sam and Dean. They both attempted to protest, but got trapped anyways.
Cas, as promised, returned at 9 that night. Dean was still awake, watching reruns of 90s shows.
“That's your mom?” Dean asked. Charlie nodded as her mom walked upstairs. “Do you look more like your dad, then?”
He grabbed two jackets and a black shirt, pulled them all on, then tugged on some jeans. He closed the door of his closet before glancing at his reflection in the mirror. Assuring himself he looked fine, he walked out into the tiny kitchen of the tiny apartment he had managed to buy. Dean had been saving money since he was 10, from birthdays or Christmases or anywhere he could get money. He had even snagged a few dollar bills out of people’s wallets in his utter desperation. He had been desperate to move out since the age of 10, out from under the roof of his abusive father. And sure enough, just weeks after Dean graduated high school, he managed to purchase an apartment in a small town on the opposite side of Kansas. He had quite quickly packed all of his and his brother's stuff, and had dragged his younger brother with him to the apartment.
“Is the yelling upsetting you?” Cas asked, kneeling down to face Jack. Jack lowered his eyes and nodded, placing his kitten Marble on the floor. Marble gave a soft meow and walked right up to Nox and rubbed her body against her, as Nox ruffled her fur and laid down. Gemini gave an indignant meow from her spot on the top of the cat tower.
“He did? I do think I saw a phone in the basement.” The girl stood up and beckoned them. “Here, follow me.” Sure enough, the girl led them over to the basement stairs and began to descend.
“With what teacher?”
It was almost too much to take in at once.
Dean ordered a regular hamburger and a soda, and his food was out within minutes. He sat by a window, glancing out at the people walking past. Adults, children, a few teenagers with dyed hair; Dean saw a whole array of people pass by. Dean was taking in the time to look at the little details of the people that walked past, as he had never gotten that chance.
Dean's second class started at 1 and ended at 2:30, so he got off in time for his shift at McDonalds, which started at 3. He had to deal with a few rude customers, including a middle aged man who demanded to get a refund on his burger and a woman who had a mind blowingly difficult order, and wouldn't accept anything less than perfection.
“Come on Dean, it’s time to go.” Kevin grumbled, grabbing Dean’s arm. Dean initially protested, but went willingly after Kevin promised him lots of food at home.
Balthazar thought for a moment. “Not much. My memory isn’t the best when I’m drunk.” He paused, thinking. “I do remember rescuing you from the basement. I can’t fully remember why, but I think some guy was hitting on you. Could’ve been him.”
Balthazar grabbed Cas’s plate and held it up. “Buttermilk waffles with syrup.”
Sam shook his head, still a little wobbly and caught off guard. “No, no. I just… I don’t know. Guess I’m just a little off today.”
Samandriel supplied, glancing at the both of them. They nodded in response, as the door closed behind them. The cafeteria was relatively empty, as it was only 8am. The three brothers found a seat near the main hall and began talking about their classes as the crowds began to file into the building.
Gabriel just shrugged his shoulders and then crouched down, holding his arms out as Lucifer’s pitbull ran towards him and began licking Gabriel’s face.
“Cas-“
The playlist was finished early thanks to Michael, Samandriel, Gabriel and Castiel’s diligence (though Gabriel did admittedly goof off quite a bit) and contained one hundred and twenty songs- plenty enough for Lucifer, thank goodness- and would last the entire party and then some. All the snacks were out and ready, all the decorations in place and everyone ready to face the mob of people that were surely on their way.
~~~~~
Cas took the opportunity to close his door and get dressed, pulling on an AHS shirt and some jeans. He opted out of his usual trench coat, promising himself he’d wear it tomorrow, but that it was too dirty today and needed to be washed. He set a sticky note on his door to remind himself to wash it when he got home from school, before grabbing his phone and walking downstairs.
And thus, he was going all around the house, making sure everyone would be ready tomorrow. Thankfully, for the Novak’s sanity, there weren't many decorations to put up, given that the party was a simple “start of school” type party rather than having a concrete theme, like Halloween or New Years. Lucifer still found ways to drive them all crazy, though.
“You’re in luck, Cas. There aren’t many people out there with green eyes.”
Samandriel clicked away at the computer, removing Devil Devil and replacing it with Living Dead Girl.
Cas finished his omelette first, and his fork fell to his plate with a clatter. "That was amazing!" He exclaimed, standing up to put his plate in the sink.
Dean lifted his head. “You see her?”
Dean nodded in agreement, then grabbed the four boxes of his stuff (including food) and put it all in his car. Then, he turned the key into the engine and began to drive.
“Dean?” Came a wet voice, shaky and unstable, as though the speaker had been crying. Dean almost immediately recognized it as Charlie’s voice.
With a huff, Dean rolled over and closed his eyes, hoping to get some sleep in. The world wasn't that kind, though, and Bobby was knocking on Dean’s door in minutes.
“Dean! You’re awake!” Sam exclaimed, walking over to his brother, who held a hand up to stop Sam from hugging him.
“Is Lucifer gonna drive us to school?” Inquired Cas as he stuffed a forkful of waffles into his mouth.
The clock soon struck 7:40 and so chaos descended on those who were not yet fully ready to go to school. Gabriel stood by the door, a smug grin on his face as he gleefully watched the chaos unfold.
Charlie rolled her eyes slightly, then leaned down and grabbed her phone off the floor before turning to face Dean. “Okay, Dean, then how about this? You beat me in a game of AHS trivia, and I’ll let it go and we’ll do it your way. I beat you, and we go find your soulmate, my way.”
“Who were you talking to?” Jo asked.
“He never pays for his party stuff.”
And so, Dean ate and ate until his plate was empty, and he then found himself downstairs in the living room next to a flood of dancing (and mostly drunk) teens.
“But I-”
soulmate, while we’re at it.”
“Some guy was making out with you, Cassie?” Gabriel asked. His voice was surprisingly not teasing in any way, but rather protective- if someone had laid a hand on Gabriel’s lil bro, that person would have a hell of a problem rain down onto them. The sudden fire in Anna’s eyes seemed to indicate that she’d be just as eager to protect Cas.
“Mhm.”
By the time his shift ended at 9, Dean was just about fed up with people. He turned the keys into the ignition, revved up his car and drove back to his dorm. Cas was there, and true to his promise, had dinner ready by the time Dean walked in the door. He had prepared two hamburgers, which was one of the few things Cas even knew how to make.
Sam gave a small chuckle as he watched Dean pull his pillow over his ears. Sam rested a hand on the pillow and tugged. “It’s
Luckily, Cas didn't hear the remark.
He eventually found refuge on the second floor, albeit pretty much all of the rooms were closed off except for a single bathroom. Still, a surprising amount of the party guests were either in the attic, the living room or the basement, so the second floor was thankfully empty of all party goers except for two others who were also eating. It was surprisingly quiet, or at least more quiet than most parts of the house. It was almost completely absent of voices, with the only sound being the blasting of the song ‘C’mon’ by Kesha.
"I was born here." Dean explained. "On the other side of the state, though."
The boy suddenly placed the box he was holding on the second bed, and the second boy also dropped his box. They walked out to go get more boxes, and Dean saw this as an opportunity to go out and buy himself some actual breakfast with the money Bobby had given him for food.
Dean nodded, and cocked his head as Bobby walked towards them. Moments before Bobby even reached the door, a pretty, demure woman with long hair appeared in the doorway behind Charlie, a pleasant smile on her face as Bobby reached the door.
Before he could process it, the boy held up Cas’s chin in his hand. “Your eyes are… really pretty.”
Dean smiled and clicked shuffle, and the first song to play was
“Mornin’ son,” Bobby said gruffly, handing Dean a plate of french toast, “Here’s your breakfast.”
“Be safe out there kids.” Bobby announced, standing in the doorway to the kitchen. He watched them all with expectant eyes as he dried off a drink glass. “Drive safely and watch your drinks.”
By then, Bobby was awake, sipping on a bottle of beer when Dean walked into the room. Bobby hastily put the beer away, however, not wanting to set Dean off. Dean’s father had drank so much so often that Dean could barely see alcohol without cringing.
When he stepped into the hot water, it was as though anything bad he was thinking off washed away in the water. The hot water was comforting and warm against his bare skin, and he sighed in content at how warm the water was. He washed his hair and the rest of himself, and got out of the shower a few minutes after he was done washing, as the water was just too comforting to step out of. Alas, he had to actually do stuff today, so he turned the water off and stepped out into the bathroom. The icy cold air nipped at his skin, but he quickly dried himself off with a towel, which made the cold air just a little more bearable. He then got redressed in the clothes he had originally put on, and finally opened the bathroom door.
“Yep, and I have to keep watch for a freakishly tall guy with brown hair.” Gabriel patted Cas on the back and gave a small laugh. “Hey! Now we have something that we can do together.”
Dean put his phone back on the charger and looked up a few nearby restaurants. Eventually, he decided on a burger place called Five Guys, and grabbed his phone and wallet and keys. He went to his car, unlocked it, got into his car and turned on the ignition. He drove to the burger place and walked inside.
Balthazar nodded at that, though thankfully out of Gabriel’s line of view. Once off the winding road, Gabriel drove down the main road until he pulled into the parking lot of a shopping complex.
Before Dean could reply, Sam interjected with a simple, “I’ll do the sunset.” Charlie turned and glanced at him, but Sam didn’t respond, only meeting her eyes.
“This early, Cas?” Balthazar gave him a glance, his gray blue eyes locking with Cas’s. “Class doesn’t start for twenty five more minutes.”
“They were alright. My geometry teacher is fine, my law studies teacher is british, I believe. Oh, my french one teacher is also named Sam, and my culinary teacher was pretty nice. She just handed out cookies to everyone in the class and introduced herself.” Sam took the brownie out of his lunchbox and handed it to Dean. “No colors yet, though.”
The words fell from his lips along with a torrent of emotion. Instantly, Dean’s entire posture changed- he went almost slack-jawed, his eyes wider than Cas had ever seen them. He swallowed heavily, words trapped in his throat. The empty was near now.
As soon as he finished though, he spotted Charlie trying to glance at his paper.
As soon as Cas finished off his own plate of waffles, he discarded it in the sink, gave a pat to Hershey and went to put Gemini and Nox up. It was a bit of a struggle to get Gemini up, but Nox came willingly and perched herself on the top of the cat tower as Cas closed the door.
"Winchester. Like the Winchester Mystery House? That place is amazing. I went there when I was 15, it's wicked." Charlie babbled, her eyes lighting up.
“And lose money you could use to pay your bills? Boy, I know how much money you have versus how much your bills cost. I am going to be paying for your groceries for the next few months until you can catch up and have a steady income.” Bobby lectured as they walked back to the car. “I am your guardian for now, I’m not gonna let you go hungry anymore.”
Dean cocked his head. “Seriously?”
Cas, however, soon proved to be enough of a distraction to bring Dean out of his thoughts.
“It’s nice to meet you Lucifer.” Dean spoke, and glanced at the man at Lucifer’s side. He was a bit shorter than both Lucifer and Dean, with dark hair and a face similar to John Winchester’s face. It made Dean shiver a bit. He hadn’t seen his father in months, but he could still remember his dad’s face clear as day.
Bobby grabbed Dean’s empty glass of water as soon as he was done with it, but not before he turned to Dean. “Hey, Dean, don't forget that you have a therapy appointment after school.”
“Oh, I’m sure they won’t.” Karen replied with a smile. Bobby simply nodded, bid both brothers farewell, and went back to his car, driving off back towards the house. By time Bobby pulled out of the driveway, Dean and Sam had walked itl the house, and Charlie had closed the door behind them.
Cas soon snapped out of his trance, and instead turned to face Dean. “I’m guessing you’ve never been to a Menchies before.”
“Any of them say they can see colors?”
This chapter is a bit shorter than I'd like, but it's midnight and I figured why not upload it today? Anyways, enjoy!
The boy soon broke the kiss, instead craning his head as he stared intently at Cas’s face. Before the boy could kiss him again, Balthazar came out of nowhere and snatched Cas’s arm.
“Awesome. I’ve been there- it's really cool.” Her eyes glanced down to Dean’s backpack, which caught her eye. “Led Zeppelin fan?”
“Alright! Pile into Dean’s car and let’s go!”
Jess just gave a small smile, and the bell rang just seconds later. She kindly bid him farewell and took off, as he himself also went to his next class.
Dean held his phone closer to his face. "Bye Sammy."
“It’s nice to meet you, Mrs. Novak. I’m Dean Winchester.” Dean spoke, and Becky smiled.
Cas blinked his eyes, and lifted his head. “Blonde.”
Lucifer’s party happens. Dean meets Cas, and Sam meets Gabriel. And of course, sparks and colors fly.
"Mm. You single?" She remarked, and before Dean could respond, she shook her hand. "I'm just kidding. It's nice to meet you."
As Sam got back to his work, a girl tapped on Andy’s shoulder and nudged towards Sam, so Andy tapped Sam’s shoulder. “Hey, Sam. This girl wants to ask you something.”
Once lunch was over, Sam was grateful that he only had two classes left in the day. He was oddly tired today, but he shrugged it off as being just not getting enough sleep.
Dean paused, a fleeting, unpleasant memory filling his mind. Dean shook his head, finishing off his food with another huge bite. "You don't know that." Dean murmured as he stood up to throw his trash away. Cas heard the small remark, but didn't think much of it. Instead, he just started putting up the groceries he had gotten in the small dorm room pantry.
The Novaks had learned over many years that it was very hard to break Cas’s concentration as well as to wake him up. An avid writer and reader, whenever Cas was heavily focused on his hobbies, or just sleeping, barely anything would tear him out of it. Except maybe his door being slammed open.
“Hmm. Add a Miss Amani song, either Come On Now or Who’s on My Rocket. And an Icona Pop song. Maybe ‘Let’s Go’? It's by Tiësto and Icona Pop.”
“Andy.” He replied, taking Sam’s hand hesitantly. “Andy Gallagher.”
As soon as the singing ended, Dean gestured to the candles. “Now you blow them out, Cas.” He supplied helpfully. Cas started, then leaned forward and blew each candle out with a swift breath to an applause.
Dean let out a laugh as he shoveled another forkful of waffle into his mouth. He finished his plate in minutes, and rinsed his plate off in the sink before grabbing his backpack. By that time, Sam was already ready, his backpack on his back, stuffed full of binders and notebooks and a Harry Potter themed pencil pouch. He was sitting by the front door, his hands dug into Arizona’s fur, petting her eagerly as he cooed at her.
The mall was fairly crowded for a tuesday, Dean thought. Cars littered the parking lot, so many of them that it was actually challenging to find a place to park.
In seconds, Becky was downstairs, but no longer determined to chase after the boys. “They’ll come back,” she had said with a tired expression, “and I’ll scream at them then.” Gabriel cackled at that, knowing that Balthazar and Lucifer would
The girl gave a small skeptical glance, but didn’t question him. Instead, she simply nodded in understanding before returning to her work.
“We’re gonna have a lot to do in the morning.” He groaned.
The girl shook her head.
Dean only had three classes today, so a while after lunch ended, he went to his third class, physics. Physics was a bore, but still incredibly hard, even on the first day. Dean had never been good at physics, so he struggled to keep up with the notes.
“What luck, what luck. My soulmate’s a blooming alcoholic.” Michael grumbled. “I’ll go find him. Just, stay here. Don’t drink anymore if you don’t want to.”
Dean let out a small sigh of relief and smiled. “Thanks Bobby.”
Lisa chuckled softly, before craning her head and groaning. “Ugh, my friend is trying to dance on someone. I gotta go, gotta stop her before she does something she’ll regret. It was nice meeting you Dean.”
“Gabriel! I’m not-”
He dug the keys into the ignition and started the car, then drove and drove and drove, all the while letting Charlie have complete control over the radio. At one point, she turned the radio off and began playing her own music, which consisted mainly of Panic! At The Disco, Imagine Dragons, Set It Off and more rock/alternative bands.
Dean shook his head, but Cas shoved the money into his hand and took off without another word. Dean groaned and stared at the money, eventually turning to stuffing it into his wallet. He muttered something under his breath as he began to walk to the nearest map of the mall. He had decided to buy his brother three things: a book on law, a new plaid shirt and something from Harry Potter. Dean didn't know exactly what from Harry Potter, but given that Sam was most likely a Ravenclaw, Dean wanted to get him something to do with Ravenclaw.
Cas bit his lip. “Uh, green. I remember something green.” He frowned in thought, and ultimately shook his head. “I can’t really remember anything else. I just remember green.”
Sam nodded. “Okay.”
“Exactly my point.” She laughed, her eyes twinkling. Dean just sighed and glanced at her.

“Alright, good morning everyone. I’m Ms. Rankin, and I’ll be teaching you World History Honors. Since today is the first day, I’ll just read the class rules and hand out a get-to-know-me sheet.”
“Sure.”
“Deano!” Gabriel cried, giving Dean a brief hug. “It’s good to see you again. It feels like it’s been forever.”
The second boy was shorter, with golden hair and eyes, and a cheery smile on his face. “I’m just here to help this guy move in.” The second boy explained, still smiling.
By 7:50, all the siblings were finally dressed, fed and ready to go. Gabriel ushered Cas, Balthazar and Samandriel into his car, and they all piled their stuff in before climbing into their respective seats- Cas took shotgun while Balthazar and Samandriel sat in the back. Once the doors were closed, he turned on his playlist and drove the three of them to school, dropping them off.
When Cas glanced at him and raised an eyebrow, Balthazar just hushed him and put it in the cart. “He won’t notice.”
It took Dean a few minutes to reach the store, and it was surprisingly empty when he reached it. Other than the employees, only a dozen or so people were walking around in the store.
They thankfully weren’t alone for long, as Benny and Jo soon sat down at the table, both right before the bell rang. They both noticed Charlie’s absence from the table almost immediately.
"Yeah. He's actually in his last year of college here. His dorm room is upstairs, on the senior's floor." Cas explained.
“Yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, and I’d add Apple Bottom Jeans. That is always a crowd pleaser. And Back In Black, if it isn’t in there alread- oh, you do have it! Nevermind then.”
Not one to be deterred, however, Sam held put his hand. Andy seemed a bit perplexed, but he took it nevertheless.
~~~~~
After leaving his dorm, Dean reached his 8 am class pretty quickly. It was mostly because he decided to speedwalk to his classroom, given how far it was from the dorms. Dean might’ve hated running, but he was the type who easily excelled at athletics. He tended to be the fastest runner in all of his gym classes, something he actually prided himself on.
She let out a small squeal before calming down. “So, freakishly tall guy with brown hair. That’s definitely a start. Cas, what about you? Do you remember anything?”
Dean blushed crimson and typed a hasty response to Charlie, before stuffing his phone away. He then waited for Cas to get out of the shower. As he waited, his phone rang, so he held his phone to his ear.
Dean picked up a leather jacket, another jacket and a shirt, and a pair of jeans. As he did so, Cas took a small step back, leaning against the wall.
Cas tilted his head, glancing at Dean with a confused expression. "I didn't know you worked at McDonalds."
Jack nodded in understanding, so Cas grabbed some clothes from his closet for himself and left his door open just a crack.
“That's great, Jack.” Cas replied with a smile. He set his backpack down and walked over to Jack, glancing briefly at the TV. “You watching your favorite show?”
Samandriel tilted his head. “Mr. Harrison?”
“Think so.” Sam replied, taking the plate in his hands. Plate in hand, he walked to the dining area, which was on the other side of the foyer. He placed his plate down in the middle of the table and then made his way back to the kitchen to grab some silverware, Arizona following him all the way. Bobby was still there, fiddling with the pancake maker. Sam grabbed some silverware from the drawers and glanced at Bobby. “I went in his room to try and wake him up a few minutes ago. I think he got up to get dressed by the time I walked out.”
As soon as the song started, Dean dug the keys into the ignition and rolled the car out of the driveway, before heading off towards the school. He and Sam had a small conversation during the ride- mainly just about small little things, like movies and pop culture. The ride didn’t seem to last long enough.
Dean nodded, grabbing his keys as the three of them made their way back to the Impala. “We already ate, but we can take you to get something. I honestly wouldn’t mind more food.”
“I wanted some Five Guys.” Gabriel replied simply, pulling into a parking spot in front of a Five Guys. “Consider it my treat. I’m paying.”
The two brothers finished off a total of six plates of waffles each (Dean taking four and Sam taking two) before it was finally time for them to head out. They both grabbed their backpacks, bid farewell to Bobby, walked out the door and hopped into the Impala.
“Lucifer Novak’s party.” Charlie cocked her head, taking a quick glance at a table near the corner window, “He always throws a party every year at the beginning of school. And every year, the entire school is invited. It's a pretty big deal.”
A confused expression dawned on Sam’s face, so Jess tapped his shoulder and cupped her hand to his ear. “Sorry about that, Ruby’s just not very open to new people.” Jess whispered with an apologetic smile. Sam nodded in understanding, as Jess gave him another smile. She was an oddly cheerful person, but Sam didn’t mind.
“Really? Aw man.”
“Oh I am,” Balthazar replied, downing a cup of water, “I’m just not a lightweight like you.”
The first thing he heard after opening his door was the sound of Lucifer yelling at Gabriel to get up. Given how common the sound was, Cas just shrugged it off and went downstairs, Nox and Gemini following closely behind. That was until two of the other cats of the house, Quinn and Coffee, came walking out towards Nox and Gemini, and the two cats paused to meow at them.
“Do we really have to get seven different types of cookies?” Cas groaned, shaking the list Lucifer had given him. “Hardly anyone even eats the cookies! They usually just get drunk and dance.”
"See you at ten."
"Alright you two, get in the car. Let's go look at the town."
Jack nodded. “Mhm. I feel hot, then I felt cold. I think I have a fever.”
Charlie smiled, thanked Dean, and began to focus on the paper she had pulled out.
“That's alright boy.” Bobby replied gruffly, a hint of happiness in his voice. “I don't mind taking care of Sam. But the question is, you gonna move out of your apartment?”
“Oh, so you lived less than an hour away from where we lived.” Dean shoved a cupcake from his lunchbox into his mouth, then wiped his hands. “We lived in Lawrence.”
Time hadn’t yet washed away all the scars, it seemed.
“Main rule of a party, Dean,” Charlie chastised, “Always be fashionably late. That's how you get people talking!”
And he wasn’t, for some unknown reason. Whatever it was, Sam was grateful that he didn’t have to worry about hiding his new found vision for colors.
Sam nodded as Dean climbed into the shotgun seat. Sam climbed into the back as Bobby finally climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the car on.
~~~~~
“You two must be Sam and Dean! The name’s Meg, it’s a pleasure.” She stepped forward and hugged both boys, pulling back with a smile on her face. “Charlie’s said quite a bit about you.”
Dean was a bit disappointed, but he hid it well. “You didn’t upset me. Now go and have fun with your friend, okay?”
"Yeah, just like the Winchester Mystery House." Dean remarked. He couldn't count the number of people who had related his name to the famous California tourist attraction.
“Probably looking for my soulmate.” Dean whispered under his breath. Unfortunately for him, Benny heard that he said something.
“Blue.”
“Good morning boy. You going off to your dorm to move in?” Bobby asked. Dean nodded, and Bobby smiled. “Alright. Take your car, drive careful. Text me when you’re done so I know everything’s good.”
Dean woke up the following Monday at 7 in the morning exactly, from his roommates alarm. Dean groaned as Castiel turned the alarm clock off.
“You have a Sarah Paulson poster in your room.” Cas deadpanned.
Dean continued eating, and he finished off his first donut with ease. Once done, he grabbed his backpack and heaved it onto his back. “I got an 8 am class, so I gotta run.”
“Yes, I am.” Sam replied, signing a little as he did so. The girl looked surprised.
After the three of them all sat down and ordered their drinks and food- and got their drinks- Dean glanced out the window at some cars that drove by and some people that walked among the parking lot. As he stared out the window, he put his cheek against his hand and sighed, stirring his straw in his drink absentmindedly. "It's crazy to think that school is about five weeks away."
Charlie took Dorothy's hand and pointed at something on her phone, which made Dorothy laugh. Dorothy soon became immersed in whatever Charlie was showing her, so Dean took the time to strike up a conversation with Benny, and the two chatted for the rest of lunch.
“Freddy! Freddy, c’mere,” Lucifer held his arms out, catching his dogs attention. Freddy ran to Lucifer instead, as Lucifer stuck his tongue out at Gabriel.
Lunch didn’t seem to arrive soon enough. By the time it did arrive, Sam was grateful to finally have a break from the onslaught of school work. His Geometry teacher had sprung a test on them, his law studies and french teacher had both given them projects, and he had spent his culinary class making sure that Gabriel wasn’t there.
"English."
“Guy, I think.”
Charlie nodded. "That's a cool aspiration. I just want to do stuff with computers."
"Can I sit here?" She asked, and Dean nodded. The girl sat down, unpacked her bags and faced the front of the lecture room. Suddenly, she turned to face Dean. "My name's Charlie, Charlie Bradbury. What's yours?"
His loyalty to the brothers had only increased over the years. Now the very emotions he always pondered over had found a heart with the two men, specifically with the shorter, freckled man- Dean.
~~~~~
The house also happened to be in a relatively large neighborhood, meaning both boys would have the opportunity of many potential new friends- and a park, which they had seen when they were driving to the house. Granted, the park was small and only had a few trees and a playground, but they were excited all the same.
“At 6. I want to take him out to eat.” Dean murmured, sitting up. He grabbed his phone and began typing out a text message to his younger brother. Not even a minute after he sent it, his phone buzzed with a reply. “Alright, we can get my brother at 6.”
Dean sighed, scouring his brain for memories. “I did, once. My family friend took my brother and I to a Menchies for my brother’s seventh birthday.” A fond smile slipped onto his lips. “My brother looked so happy when we pulled up.” Dean didn’t have many clear memories from before his thirteenth birthday, mainly due to how much time had passed, but he could always remember the days his brother smiled.
Everyone in the house knew exactly who was at the door- Chuck ran over to the door, and sure enough, Aunt Amara stood outside, a practiced smile on her face.
“Oh, Kevin, you’re here.” Sam exclaimed joyously, before glancing briefly at Dean, who was very obviously drunk. “I’m going to drive the Impala home with Dean, Jo and Charlie. You, Benny and Meg will take Meg’s car back to my house. Just have Benny follow me, okay?”
“I don’t know.” Michael replied. “Whoever their soulmates are, though, ought to be looking for them. Just keep an eye and ear out.” He patted both Cas and Gabriel on the shoulder. “You’ll find them. Just give it time, and keep looking.”
Dean groaned again in dismay, but ultimately sat up when Bobby nearly kicked his door in.
There, he met up with his two friends, Charlie and Benny, whom he always ate lunch with. He would invite Cas, but Cas had already said he sat with three of his siblings.
“Amara, it's good to see you!” Chuck exclaimed, holding his arms out. Amara tilted her head and held her arms out as well, pulling her baby brother into her arms.
“Now, this group project shouldn’t be too difficult, but some of you may struggle with it. You’ll be doing a paintings- one person will paint a sunrise, one person will paint a midday sun, and the last person will paint a sunset! I’ve given you each paints with colors labeled- if you need to know which colors to use, they’ve been written on the board.” She turned and pointed to the white board, where a lazily sketched sunrise, midday sun and sunset laid, colors labeled. “I will be walking around, so feel free to ask if you need help.”
“Oof, not much of a drinker huh?” The boy slurred, tilting his head.
“Well,” Charlie began, calming herself, “I’d tell you but I don’t wanna force it in your face first thing in the morning.”
Dean sighed as Charlie let out a giggle and turned to face Sam. “Now, are ya ready kids?”
And with that, Sam walked off to his first class, Dean close in tow. The two brothers split when Sam had to go upstairs, so Dean continued going forward until he reached the 300 hall.
"I'm good, just had breakfast. What about you?"
“Sorry.” Dean murmured apologetically.
~~~~~
"Here we are boys." Exclaimed Bobby gruffly, setting Dean's suitcase down on the pavement of the driveway that he had just pulled into. "This is your new home."
“And yet, you’re one too.”
“It’s nice to meet you Dean. And please, call me Becky.” She spoke, before turning to Charlie. “And what’s your name?”
“Not really. Well, I want to meet them on my own, not by tracking them down. I hate the idea of being controlled by my fate. If I find them, I want it to be on my own time, of my own will.”
Dean smiled at his brother's voice. "Sammy, how are ya? What are ya doing calling me this early?"
Dean stuffed a forkful of spaghetti into his mouth and nearly choked trying to answer. “Well, only like ten percent of people meet their soulmates in highschool, remember? And it’s usually in their last two years, not really first year. But hey, don’t fret. You’ll find your soulmate one day. Though I still don’t understand why you want to find them so badly.”
"Hey Cas?"
“Charlie hey! Who’s this?” Asked the girl, tilting her head curiously.
Trigger warning for homophobia andsome mild violence. All slurs are censored but I would still tread lightly
"Mhm." She murmured, brushing a bit of her hair off her shoulder. "Well, my brother is a bit too oblivious with feelings, so good luck. But if you hurt him, I'll end you."
Cas nodded, before Balthazar patted him on the back and walked off, leaving Cas alone and wondering where the boy with brilliant green eyes was.
Then she walked off to another tank without a word, and Dean was left red-faced, his eyebrows raised. Cas returned quickly, and Dean remained quiet, observing the otters while he mulled over thoughts in his mind.
“It’s what friends are for, right?” She replied, beaming. “Now, please let me help you with that crush of yours.”
“You two sure know how to decorate.” Dean remarked as he walked into the dorm room. Cas turned around, briefly startled by Dean’s sudden reappearance.
Jo took a bite of her snack bar and quickly wiped her mouth. “How crazy is that then, we were so close and yet we never met?”
me to be noisy?”
"Are you in there, Dean?" Cas asked, his voice floating into the room.
“We will!” Cried Anael, dumping her plate into the sink. She rinsed it off with water and then left it as she ran upstairs to get properly dressed.
