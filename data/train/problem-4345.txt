But for the past week, the Winchesters have been planning something entirely non-hunting related. Sam and Dean argue a little over what day to celebrate, but in the end it’s Jack when Eileen sides with him over her Sam. Jack wouldn’t choose sides.
“No you’re diff’rent.” Castiel’s words are definitely slurring, and it’s making Dean feel giggly as well.
“You always were such a hero, weren’t you Sergeant. Your life for theirs without a second thought.” In the dimly lit tourist park, Zachariah stands, hands held behind his back and chest puffing out like he’s already won.
He comes back and helps Dean stand, stripping him of his panties. The washcloth is warm as his dom cleans the mess they’d made. He feels relaxed in every sense of the word as he’s guided to where he’s pretty sure he saw a couch when he got here.
“That’s a very long story Officer.” Castiel sighs heavily, finding himself incredibly exhausted from everything that’s happened today.
As the pounding slows, he picks up on a steady beeping. It somehow feels sharp, like the high pitch of it is somehow cutting into his temples. He wants it to stop, but it doesn’t. It just carries on somewhere off to the side, beeping in sync with the pounding in his head.
Eileen steps forward to give him his coffee, making sure his hands are firmly wrapped around the cup before stepping back to Sam.
It rings a few times before a clearly british voice answers, “King of Hell, to what do I owe this pleasure?”
“We’ve got more bad news for you if you’re up for hearing it.” Sick of standing, Dean seats himself at the edge of the bed, being careful to avoid jostling Cas.
He feels guilty that he is here rather than sleeping next to Claire’s bedside like a father should. But he hasn’t exactly been much more than a sperm donor to Claire before now so what’s one more night. Besides, the young dark haired girl at the front desk, Krissy he thought he heard the officer call her, back at the station had been so kind as to point out that he looked ‘like trash’ and should get some sleep or he’d scare the poor kid.
Castiel debates for half a second the impulse to respond about how that’s exactly what his own neighbor does, but that only makes it that much easier to slip into the image of Impala’s fantasy.
“Hi, yes I’m Jimmy.” He finally says, watching as Charlie scoots into Claire’s booth. “How is it that you know Claire?”
The door opens and his heart starts racing. The door clicks shut, and light footsteps approach him. He feels himself being circled and instantly ensures he’s in the correct posture. Back straight, head down. A large hand cards through his hair momentarily, and he finds himself leaning into the touch.
Castiel giggles at that, his fingers running fondly down the side of the empty bottle between them, “How are you not drunk?” he muses.
“Because, Dean,” Castiel leans in close again, his lips just shy of Dean’s ear, “I want to remember every little detail and I’ve never been drunk before so I don’t know if I’ll remember any of this.”
“Wait, is this the same Ben from Lisa’s?” Castiel asks with his brows furrowed trying to make the connection in his head.
“She’s dead, isn’t she?” Castiel can hear the woman’s voice on the other end catch. “I knew something was wrong when he left, he never ditches us. Fuck. I’m sorry, I’m sure you don’t want to deal with a stranger crying on the phone.”
He works the lid off and pulls out what he can only guess would be a small jingle bell on a necklace chain.
The two of them spend quite some time with Mary teaching Castiel how to properly play with the dolls, explaining how he HAS TO make his voice sound like it’s supposed to and not all “like a bear with a cold” like he’d apparently been doing.
“Hey, it’s not mean,” Dean defends himself, “I just don’t want some drooly mutt hanging around my house.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever heard you swear before.” It’s Dean’s turn to cock his head to the side, “Do it again.”
“Deee!!!!” Mary squeals behind Castiel, causing the man to jump a bit, “Cassie is soooo good at playing dollies! Can he play with us every Sunday?”
“Yup!” Claire says without missing a beat, “But now I’m hungry. Can I have ice cream for breakfast?”
His dom sucks bruises into his neck and on his shoulders, one hand pulling his head to the side by his hair for better access and the other hand teasing one nipple after the other. His senses slowly blend together, but he feels the heat rising in his gut all the same.
: It’s got a hate fuck vibe, but I figure your neighbor is an ass too so this might hit home for you too.
“Should I hand the phone back to the kid, Dean or are we adults?” He playfully chastises the man, acting more like old friends than new acquaintances.
There are two main exceptions to the rules. The first being Amara. Having no true territory or purpose besides being alive to keep the cosmos balanced, she is therefore allowed to go where she pleases so long as she stays out of everyone else’s business.
At ten to one, Castiel and Claire walk into the Roadhouse. As promised, Dean and his brother are waiting at the booth with Dean’s child. Letting go of Castiel’s hand, Claire runs to give Ben a hug.
Charlie Destroyer of Sleep: I can’t really tell you, I just need to know if there’s a reason to follow the slightly suspicious breadcrumbs or if I’m barking up the wrong tree.
Sitting on the mediation pillow in the corner of his living room, Castiel takes another deep breath trying to refocus himself. Meditation has become a huge part in managing his anxiety, and since the whole coronavirus thing started his anxiety has been all over the place. Working at home as a teen crisis counselor hasn’t exactly been easy without the ability to separate work and home. It’s been two weeks since the governor announced the stay at home order with no true end in sight. But right now the only thing that he would like to end is his neighbor.
“How ya’ feeling? We’ve got you on some painkillers. Not the good stuff but that’s coming as soon as Sam gets his ass back here with it.”
He damn near cries when he sees Claire. She’s sleeping on the hospital bed, wrapped up in a fuzzy Doc McStuffins blanket. He’s got a teddy bear from the gift shop in his hands and his phone charging on the other side of the room as he watches her sleep.
“You’re fucking brave you know.” Dean sways in his chair leading Castiel to reach out and place his hand on Dean’s shoulder to keep him from falling over into the desk.
There is only one problem left to solve before the Entity can go back to the Empty. Castiel. While the Entity wants to leave their deal intact, Michael had other plans. Plans that involve keeping Castiel in Heaven like the rest of his brethren. And that just wouldn’t do.
I didn't reread this one, so it's completely unedited. Going through an emotional funk this week so you get what you get and you don't throw a fit.
“First door on the right, keys already in the door. Stairwell doesn’t have a door, but don’t let that fool ya into thinking you can steal from me. Enough security in this place you’d be stupid to try to take so much as a napkin without permission.”
“Drop the gun or the next one goes through your heart.” Castiel looks back to Zachariah, down on one knee and wincing in pain as an officer approaches cautiously from a few yards back.
“Why did it take you so long to find us?” Her little head cocks to the side again, the blonde hair cascading down adding to the innocent look.
Castiel holds back his chuckle, noting how the comment made Dean blush a little, “I like cats more than dogs, but dogs are okay too.”
“Should have taken it slower, you’ll feel like hell in the morning.” Thinking about the morning and feeling shitty, Dean rolls his chair over, getting into Castiel’s personal space to open the top left drawer. Producing a bottle of aspirin, he pops the top and shoves two of them into Castiel’s hand who takes them without question.
“Sucks.” Castiel almost wishes there was vodka left now. “Overbearing isn’t anything I’d consider my dad, if anything he’s almost as carefree as they come. Noami on the other hand was no angel.”
From the other side of the booth, Sam slides out gesturing for Ben to as well. Without a word, Dean pulls a set of keys from his pocket and hands them over to Sam.
“For fuck’s sake, Sammy, could you possibly have shittier timing!” Dean yells from next to him, his voice tinted with something along the lines of amusement and annoyance.
: So good, Impala. Bet it would feel so good. Close just thinking about it. Thinking about my hand wrapped around both of us, your lips on my neck making all kinds of marks.
He lets his mouth go slack, keeping his tongue still and handing the control over. “Such a good boy,” his dom’s voice lower than it had been before, “Such a beautiful mouth you’ve got, Dean. Feels so good.”
The words settle in Dean’s gut like a ball of lead. This isn’t Castiel’s first time being human, but it is his first time falling from Heaven. Last time, when Metadouche had stolen his grace,he’d at least been decent enough to not throw him off Cloud Nine as well.
They’re halfway through a very touching stuffed animal wedding being officiated by Ellie when the apartment door bangs open. Dean’s got his arms loaded with groceries, his hatred of taking more than one trip obvious in the way he’s got bags looped all the way up his arms.
: Finally got it, Angel. The dildo I used is pretty big too so I figure even if he’s hung I could do it.
The metallic taste in his mouth proves that he isn’t just tasting molecules anymore. There’s no trace of his grace left to skew the blood into something less disgusting. It’s not enough to choke him, but the feel of it clinging to his teeth is all he can focus on now that he’s noticed it. He wants to spit it out, but his body chastises him for even attempting to move his head to the side.
Rather than responding verbally, Castiel pushes himself as best he can to the side of the bed closest to all the machines. He attempts to grab the blanket and lift it for Dean, but his hands can’t seem to find the edge and he ends up just grabbing a handful and holding it up a bit.
Zachariah tsks his tongue at Castiel, swinging the handgun towards the car and firing off three shots one after the other. The sound of glass breaking, the car alarm, and gunfire echo through the night.
“That’s a bit of a story.” He chuckles, sitting a little more sideways as well. “Your grandpa, Chuck, fell in love with Lilith. They had two kids together and adopted another. Then Chuck cheated on her, which was really mean of him to do by the way, but that resulted in another one of my brothers. Chuck and Lilith got a divorce, then he fell in love with Eve. Eve and Chuck had me and according to your uncle Gabriel, they got divorced and remarried.”
“Castiel. And  I hope it isn’t too forward of me, but I tucked my number into your pocket before I dressed you.”
The officer laughs glancing over at (who Castiel is assuming based on outfit and desk) is the Sheriff, “Nah Jody’s nice enough to let me go home now and then. Last night was just an all hands on deck kind of situation. Don’t get a lot more than kids selling pot and drunk driving in these parts.”
“My turn yet?” Sam asks and Eileen nods in response. The younger hunter is up with the excitement of a child on Christmas morning, darting towards the door, “I’ve just gotta go grab it quick, be right back.”
“So what’s the verdict, Dean?” Castiel asks, turning to face his boyfriend, “Can we keep her or should we put her back on the streets as a wayward orphan?”
“There is a little spot where you thread it through when you’ve got some time just play around with it. Owner’s manual is tucked into the side pocket and there are diagrams on the sides for the different ways to install it.”
“Alright, so why don’t you hop in the back of my cruiser and we’ll take you into the station. Unless you’d rather talk here, I’d just rather not get bit by mosquitoes.” The man’s voice is light hearted, like he’s genuinely trying to help. So Castiel just lets him be in charge, no questions asked.
“Two bedrooms. It’s me and my five-year-old.” He explains, hoping to not end up on the sexy side of anything with this man.
A baritone laugh echoes through the room, “I didn’t say anything about letting you cum, Dean. You’ve been good. Too good to let me be done with you so soon. I’m glad we’re on the same page about that.”
His dom’s forehead drops against his own, the deep moans being breathed into the air are beyond pornographic. The feel of hot cum spilling onto his panties almost enough to make him hard all over again.
One hand reaches out, touching over each of the bruises he’s sure are left on his neck. He can hear the other working over the thick cock between them. It takes all of his willpower to keep his hands behind his back like a good sub.
“I see Claire’s been talking about me.” Sam smirks, pulling papers out of his bag. The two get right to business, Castiel explaining the note his brother had left for him and Sam explaining the legal courses of action they could take. With him, Sam brought a packet of information about getting licensed to do foster care, including the application for the county.
“Thought I could wait it out, that it was just a dumb crush.” Dean continues, his voice barely audible, “Then I come home and you’re being cute as fuck playing dollies with my niece and shit, man.”
Less than three hours of sleep has him feeling like shit, but it’s still a better morning than yesterday was. No death threats awaiting him at the end of the night anyway. His stomach is in knots as he thinks about officially meeting Claire. He had willed himself years ago to forget all about Amelia for fear that he’d slip and go find them.
“I’ll have Missouri make some calls to Jack’s social worker, but unless we can prove that Lilith is an unfit caregiver it could be near impossible to get him across state lines.”
“Cassie?” She says breaking through his thoughts, “Can you play dollies with me ‘til Dee gets home?”
“She said she wanted me to know who you were even if you weren’t there.” Just like Amelia to do something so kind to someone so undeserving of kindness. She always had such a big heart.
Castiel had pulled up and jumped out of his car as soon as he saw the light blue sedan parked along the curb. Looking that way, he can just make out the shape of his ex-girlfriend sitting in the back driver’s side seat. He doesn’t see Claire, and that thought alone makes his stomach knot up. What if he’s too late?
“It’s not your mommy, Claire,” Castiel says, sitting up straighter to hit the call light like the nurse had requested he do when she woke up. “I’m your father.”
The silence in the car borders between awkward and pleasant as the two grown men look at each other. It’s Claire who finally breaks the silence with a loud, “I HAVE TO PEE, DADDY!”
Deciding that she seems like the type who just might, he decides to sit up on his bed just enough to be half-awake. Before texting her back, he saves her number as a contact.
“Says the guy I’ve had a crush on since fucking forever.” Dean hadn’t meant to say it, but fuck that’s what vodka is for. Nevertheless his face goes red enough to hide his freckles.
“Mommy had lots of pictures of you all over our house,” Claire announces out of the blue while drawing on printer paper with a sharpie (both courtesy of Ellen).
“You have four uncles, my brothers. Michael, Lucius, Raphael, and Gabriel. My parents, Chuck and Eve, are both still alive but they aren’t together anymore.”
“Awwww, Claire this is the best!” Charlie’s smile could be seen a mile away, it’s easy to see that her reaction is real. “I’ll show it the giant and handmaiden right away and then it’s getting framed!”
“Usually she’s here seven thirty to five, but given your situation just drop her off and pick her up when you need. She’s a great kid, I won’t mind a little extra time with her while you get things situated.”
“I swear to God-Chuck-Michael whoever the fuck is in charge now that I will kill the next person who speaks if it’s not Cas.”
“Dee says that she’s an animal studier person who goes into the rainforest!” Mary says bouncing around, clutching a much more pristine doll in her uninjured hand, “She was taking pictures of a super rare pink tiger when a ginormous snake tried to eat her!”
Cas let out a breath, aborting whatever he was going to say, because apparently he was trying to focus on one thing at time.  Because Dean had multiple
And, he couldn’t believe he was saying this, but he guessed that was for the best. He liked Jo, and he probably shouldn’t make things awkward by ruining a perfectly good friendship.
Dean wanted to throw up as he watched Cas tense, then nod remorsefully.  Sam let out another breath, halfway to a scoff.  He nodded, too, much more quickly.
But Zachariah let out a loud, disappointed sigh. “Castiel,” he reproved, “she was the third serious prospect you’ve sabotaged.”
Dean walked briskly out of the store, shoving his entire body against the glass door to leave. The bell buzzed.
Using the wine as an excuse, he elbowed between Cas and the guy sitting next to him—Balthazar, Dean thought his name was. He’d seen him around a few times before. “Cas,” he whispered, pouring the wine slowly. Cas turned his head to look at him. “Check out the girl at the end of the table.” He nodded subtly in the blonde’s direction, and Cas’ eyes slid over to her.
“Benny?” a voice came from the back of the thin hall, catching both Dean and Benny’s attention. The shadow of a woman poked her head out of the bedroom door. It was too dark for her to make out Dean’s features; Dean knew that because he could hardly see Benny standing a foot away.
“What the hell’s going on out here?” Castiel heard a familiar voice call from the shadows outside the farmhouse.  He looked up, watching as the outline of a petite woman walked toward their group.  Ruby came into the glow of the fire.  A tilted smile was pressed onto her lips, the shadows playing on her face, as she regarded him.  “Castiel.  You’re supposed to be dead.”
“Yes,” he assured her. He thinned his lips remorsefully. “I… haven’t been sleeping well.” That, at least, was the truth. He found it difficult to fall asleep knowing he wouldn’t wake up to Dean. It made him wonder what the point of waking up at all was.
Jack nodded vigorously, prompting Dean to crouch down to his level. Dean pointed up at a high shelf inside the pantry. “See that jar there that says boomslang venom? Think you can get that for me?”
Dean’s face cracked at that, but he controlled it when Cas leaned back.  He clicked his tongue. “Promises, promises.”
He felt Cas watching him for what felt like an hour.  The soundtrack to the movie swelled in the background, unnoticed.  “You don’t want to lose him.”
“No,” he said, bringing his eyes level.  “I’m worried about what’s gonna be left when all this is over.”
He barked out a surprised laugh at that. A genuine smile slid across Claire’s face, and she joined in. And, in that smile and glinting in her blue eyes, Dean saw the kid he used to know.
Castiel sighed.  They weren’t that lucky.  “I doubt it. At least, not directly.  She’s most likely a low-level soldier.”  He had to stop a shudder when he heard his own words.
“Whatever—whatever you think is best,” he said. He turned his head to look at Dean. “And, if you’d prefer I be a part of the conversation when you do tell her, I’ll be there.”
“Got it,” Sam said, grateful for something to do.  He couldn’t just stand around while Dean was dying.  Briefly, he shared a look at Cas.  Cas barely paused in rolling up his sleeves to look back.
The front door banged open. Dean pressed himself against the wall and strained to listen over the music (it sounded like it was playing the main theme to
Dean's face hardened, but he felt his eyes flicker downward guiltily.  Of course, he trusted Cas.  He didn't even know why that was a question anymore.  He thought Cas knew that.
There was a second then—just a quick one—where everything just paused. Their eyes locked, and this weird energy that Dean didn’t know how to put a name to passed between them. But he couldn’t really linger on it, and he didn’t want to, because Cas was crowding back in to press teasing pecks to Dean’s mouth, making Dean chase him whenever he pulled away.
Dean wanted to collapse.  Instead, he put his feet under him and struggled to stand.  He walked forward, eyes intent on house, and on the man within.
Dean took a step out of the group and turned to face them all.  “Sooner the better,” he said, and began bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet to warm up.  “I’m ready.”
A little over an hour after they settled in, Dean threw his blankets off with a huff and got up.  “I’ll take over,” he told Sam in a whisper, even though he must have known Castiel wasn’t asleep, either.
“Right,” he said, a twinge of disappointment creeping in.  But, if she only left because she was out of work, maybe she’d be willing to return.
“Attention passengers,” a friendly voice sounded from over the loudspeaker.  Dean’s neck snapped up.  For a second there, he’d forgotten he was afraid.  But then the desk attendant said, “We’ll be boarding flight 586 to Paris in five minutes, beginning with business class.  Please have your tickets ready at the gate.”
“She sent him to the Empty,” Sam said, his eyes flickering back and forth in memory. They paused, turning back to Cas. “And that woke the angels and demons up?”
Sam had his phone held to his face, one finger plugging his ear so he could hear his mother over the throng. He guided them along the back wall. Castiel stuck close to Dean, something clawing up his throat, and he wasn’t certain meeting Mary Winchester had much to do with it. There were so many people crammed into the space, so much noise from the machinery. Castiel didn’t think he’d ever seen so much concentrated chaos.
He supposed he would eventually, but the thought of staying in Waco had crossed his mind from time to time in the last few days.  It would unsettle him, leaving Jack without any protection in case Lucifer’s gang tracked him down.  Castiel didn’t know if he could wash his hands of that concern once the baby was with Kelly’s parents.
They were both headed straight for the road.  A line of cars zipped past, paying no mind to the child headed straight for them.
The house sat on the top of the hill, its wooden face rotting and weather-beaten, moss and mold rife on the planks as nature attempted to reclaim it. The door was chained, too, so Dean went to one of the boarded up windows. He ignored the profanity graffitied onto the pine and pried the board off with his hands. Beneath it, the window was shattered, and he thought he’d be able to fit through it.
Dean reluctantly pulled off Cas to get the strainer from the cabinet.  "Good.  Tell her we'll be there."
Dean rolled off of him to allow Castiel to put it on, and he opened the bottle of lube and warmed some up in his hands.  He pressed another kiss to Castiel’s jaw before wrapping his fingers around his dick and working on the layer of slick moisture.  Castiel closed his eyes and circled into Dean’s touch, trying to focus on not ruining the moment.
It had been exactly one week, one day, eight hours, and twenty-four minutes since Dean had left on his trip.  One week, one day, eight hours, and twenty-four minutes since they’d kissed.
Crowley sighed in a put upon way.  “Fine,” he agreed, stepping to the side to let Dean in.  “Get in. I won’t discuss a coup d’état in the hallway.”
“These clothes are very—” Another grunt, accompanied by some rustling. “I don’t like these metal contraptions, Dean. Where are the buttons?”
So far, she was the only person besides Zachariah that Dean had seen. It wasn’t like he expected to meet the master of the house on his first day—or maybe at all—but he expected to see
“We take him back to Lawrence.  Where he belongs,” Dean said, his eyes still latched on Cas’.  “I’m not giving him to a bunch of nuns.  Kelly didn’t want the Catholics raising him, anyway, remember?”  He quirked a grin.
Cas was shoving past him before Dean could even finish his sentence, and Dean wasn’t sure if he should close the door.  What if he needed to make a quick escape? He chanced it, and let the door swing shut behind him as he slumped back towards the bed.
He only joined the conversation when Mary asked him questions. Where did he grow up? What did he study in school? What was his family like? He wasn’t certain how he should answer any of those questions because he didn’t know what Dean had told her. A spiteful part of him wished to tell her the truth.
Castiel let all the air in his lungs expel itself. Not answering, he peeled off his coat and hung it on the rack next to the door. He moved to the table and nearly fell into one of the chairs.
Cas hummed out a lowly kind of rumble.  He paced in closer again, and Dean turned around fully to greet him.  He flattened his palm on Cas’ chest, and leaned in to press their lips together.  Cas accepted it easily, short grunts and desperate noises lifting from his throat.  Dean moved his thumb back and forth, feeling Cas’ nipple harden under his dress shirt.  Cas rattled against it, his hands flying to Dean’s sides.
"I better get back," Eileen told them, making them all look back at the phone.  "Sam, I'll give you the names tomorrow after class.  Want to meet in the dining hall?"
Dean’s eyes volleyed across his face.  It didn’t answer his question.  Cas’ hands had stilled on him, and Dean found himself leaning into the touch.
“Is that what your problem is?” Ruby snapped.  “You hate me because you’re some bitter old hag?  Or because, when Lucifer gets his child, he’ll have me to thank and not you?
Ruby pulled her brows together in concentration.  “Oh.  Uh . . . well, there were three of them.  Tall fellas.  And—it was the strangest thing.  They . . . well, they had a baby with them.”
Sam turned to him. Resolutely, he said, “I’m going with you.” Like Dean thought Sam would let him do otherwise.
"Exactly!  He's a Novak, Sam!  They tried to kill me.  They did kill Mom—and Ash.  They basically killed Jess."
He stepped onto the porch, the wood creaking beneath him as he swiped his boots so as not to track any dirt in.  The shade the overhang provided was a bit of relief from the warm day.  Dean could already hear chatter from inside, along with the familiar sound of lyrical laughter.  He let it wash over him, as if it were a balm to the last few weeks, before opening the door.
Dean reached into his coat, opened his tin. There was only one left. His throat tightened, but he told himself not to be stupid. He picked it up and offered Cas his best smile. “Guess we’re sharing.”
He rounded his hands to Dean’s back and trailed slowly down his spine, to his ass. Dean sat up straighter, pulling in a breath. Castiel tried to keep his movements slow, but he couldn’t deny he was eager—eager to watch the pleasure play on Dean’s face, eager to unwind him like Dean had done to him.
“I know what you are,” Zach told him arrogantly. “And, what? Did you really think you could come collect payment now that your boss is dead? Don’t think I haven’t heard of her demise.”
“You really think most of them were innocent?” Dean asked.  He heard the crack that ran through his own words.
Dean palmed Castiel’s shirt off completely, and Castiel let it fall to the floor, and then Dean set in. He mouthed against Castiel’s chest, leaving hot and wet trails on his pecks and teasing at his nipples with the tip of his tongue. Castiel gave a low groan, his chest instinctually pulling forward for more. Dean’s open palms were dragging heat tantalizingly slow up Castiel’s back, a steady ascent to his shoulder blades. The friction it caused made Castiel catch fire.
There was nothing to think about, but Dean nodded, if only to get Sam off his case.  “Fine. I’ll think about it,” he lied. “Don’t mean I’ll do anything though.”
“Castiel Novak’s office.  This is Dean.” It was weird how, in such a short time, those words felt so natural.  They rolled right off his tongue. He couldn’t imagine not saying them again, even though there was a solid change that would be the last time.
Humor and happiness still sparkling on his features, Dean let his hand slide from Castiel’s as he stood up. He bounced down a step and turned back around, their eyes locking.
It struck Castiel as an odd question, one no one had ever asked him before. Maybe his mother would have if he’d been old enough to hold many memories of her before her passing.
Cas quickly cleared the table of the kettle and plates.  As he did, Kelly leaned forward against the wood, panting hard.  “Hot water,” he repeated, voice snippier.  “And blankets.  Go.”
Dean realized he better hurry up and follow. He jumped out of his seat and rushed after his brother.
“Fine,” he answered, eyes again lighting about the room as if they’d somehow missed Dean in their initial search. “Where’s Dean?”
Castiel looked down at the counter, wondering if Dean would come back or if he should do what he was planning to by leaving. He didn’t want to. He wanted to talk to Dean more. Maybe because Dean was the only one that entire evening to treat him like he wasn’t invisible. But he probably wouldn’t return. The patron had given him an out, and he’d likely take it. Castiel wouldn’t blame him. After all, the bar was busy and—
The bartender came back with their drinks, setting them down in front of them on cocktail napkins.  Dean picked his up immediately and took a gulp, wincing at the burn of alcohol. Sam had snorted out a laugh.  “I dunno, Dean. Everyone seems to like him.”
Despite his best efforts, Dean was forced to spend the week in bed recuperating, whereas Sam helped Max with breaking in the young horses and Ruby aided Tasha and Alicia with the chores around the house and the stable.  Dean hated it.  He had no way of occupying his mind.  Even when he was able to get some fresh air by going for a walk, or sitting on the fence watching Sam and Max work while he and Alicia shouted out pointers, or exercised Baby, his thoughts still wandered.
Hours later, they were still sitting at the dining room table, a pile of books and a laptop on sleep mode spread out in front of them. Dean’s eyes were swimming at this point, and even though all the windows in the house were open, the air sat heavily around them. Most importantly, his stomach was growling. It was still light outside, but it was late—close to seven.
“No, she never beat us.”  Something occurred to him—something he’d never thought to ask before.  “What about you?”
Castiel let out a breath, hearing it fill up the silence around him. He picked himself up, ass a little sore from the porcelain of the tub. He moved to the sinks, eyes on his reflection walking towards him in the mirror. When he came upon the sink, he kept staring forward.
Behind them, one of the horses snorted.  It made Castiel’s heart skip a beat.  He looked over his shoulder at the three sleeping shadows tethered to a low hanging branch of the oak.  The nearby stage sat like a black hole against the night.  But they were still alone.
Dean nodded, not really wanting to think about that. Cas was alive now. That was all that mattered. “Okay, what about me? Anything?”
Dean squared his jaw, and tried really hard to keep glaring directly at Michael, but he faltered.  He didn't want to think about Cas forcing himself to stay away, about Cas in pain.  Even if he was the one who broke it off, even if his reasons were stupid.  Dean knew Cas was only trying to protect him, and Michael was really the one keeping them apart.
It was nearly a straight shot to Illinois along route 36, until it turned into I-55 and led north. Castiel drove through the night, and watched the birthing and dying stars and twirling galaxies that were once as far away to him as a thought give way to the pink and orange sun rising through his windscreen. He sat through morning rush hour traffic and cursed construction sites and swiveled his head to peer at the result of traffic accidents along the highway’s shoulder, but he never stopped. It was close to eleven in the morning when he finally arrived in the woods outside of Pontiac, and the truck once again needed fuel.
Dean was still waiting for an answer as the door suddenly flew open with a gush of wind and Sam stormed in. The temperature dropped even more and Dean shivered slightly as the room was suddenly too cold to be only wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants.
“So, where are we going now? I’ll just assume there is more to this island than one building with bedrooms and a cafeteria.” Dean looked at Castiel, who got nervous again as Dean was standing just a little too closely.
Dean shook his head. “Actually, Cas invited me to his room, we’ll watch a movie. I guess if you want, you could…” Dean trailed off, definitely not wanting his brother to come. He was too excited to see Castiel again and he did not want Sam to know what was going on between them. Hell, Dean himself didn’t even know what was going on between them.
“That is such a cool gift, I wish I could do that.” Kevin exclaimed, staring at Dean shamelessly, watching as even the bright red slowly faded, leaving only Dean’s normal, perfectly healthy skin. Dean smiled at that, remembering how he had thought the same thing about every gift he had encountered so far. “Why, what is your gift?”
“Good.” Dean said, reaching out to take Castiel’s hand across the table. “Good.” Castiel replied stupidly, smiling back and entwining their fingers. They held eye contact for a few seconds, longer than would have been comfortable with anyone else.
“Sam is on his way home. Meg is taking him to be with his family, with his girlfriend. I made sure he will be surrounded by people that love him, that'll help him get through this tragic loss.” Gabriel said and Castiel deflated. Sam was fine, Gabriel and Charlie were here to help Castiel the way that Sam's family would help Sam.
“Dean.” Cas chimes in as Dean still doesn’t let go and Dean steps back, dropping Chuck who falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping for air.
“He will not kill him. Alistair is still locked up, we think Azazel is holding Sam hostage to make a deal. He will not make a move until his brother is out of the cell and safe. Right now, the best we can do is stay in here. Until we locate him nobody is safe outside of their room.” Castiel tried to reason, but one look at Dean was enough to tell that reasoning would not work. He was too afraid to loose his brother to listen to reason.
“No.” Dean said simply and it was the end of their conversation. They walked in silence, Castiel looking around for any clues, Dean keeping his head down just in case.
“It will be okay. Don't worry.” It was an empty promise and they both knew it. There was nothing they could do to save Sam. Now that the initial urgency of the situation was gone, Castiel realized that he would not be able to live with himself if he hurt another person. Even a scumbag like Azazel. Dean knew it, too. He was secretly glad that Cas had not done anything, he did not want to be the reason for Castiel's suffering.
“I love you.” He says, settling his hands on Castiel's lower stomach, smiling as he says it. It’s almost funny how easy it is to tell Cas that he loves him, now that he once admitted it.
“When was the last time you slipped, then? The last time you unintentionally revealed your powers.” Dean asked challengingly and Castiel pulled his hand from Dean's grip. He didn't understand where the sudden hostility came from and felt that Dean had no right to treat him like this.
“Dean.” The intensity of Castiel’s stare made Dean want to sink into his pillows and take back everything he just said. “As I already said, you cannot leave this room until we know that you are not going to endanger anyone. I don’t know why your parents kept this a secret from you, but the Gene is real. Your father had it and he passed it on to you. You have to stay here for a minimum of two weeks after we figured out your gift. We cannot risk you endangering civilians.” Deans anger prevailed over his intimidation and he jumped off the bed again. “My father was a drunk and an ass. He did not have any gift and neither do I. This is insane. I will go to find my brother now.” He said and stormed to the door, only to find Castiel right in front of him. He stumbled back as he bumped into the man and watched with wide eyes as Castiel started to glow from the inside. His whole body emitted a white light that was so bright, Dean had to fight the urge to avert his eyes. “I said you cannot leave this room.” Castiel’s voice was calm, but threatening and Dean involuntarily took a step back and watched in awe as the man’s shadow unfolded two giant wings that spread out across the whole white wall behind him. It was then that Dean was convinced this could not be a joke, everything looked too real. He would have to accept that maybe his image of the world was wrong and that there was something bigger and better than humanity. And apparently, Dean was a part of it. Dean had always been a fan of superhero movies and if this was to be his new reality he just hoped his superpower was something cool. “Alright then. How do we find out what I can do?”
Castiel nodded slowly and looked down at his plate again, feeling Dean’s eyes on him as he spoke. “I feel the same, Dean. I can’t seem to find the right words to tell you how much you already mean to me. I have never experienced something like this. It scares me.” If he was going to be honest he might as well go all the way. “I never had any hook-ups, casual or serious but if I had to label it, I would say I’m pretty serious about this.” Castiel said and finally looked at Dean who was smiling warmly at him.
Everything happens very fast after Dean finally gets out of the bathtub. He is still not convinced all the blood is washed from his hair, even after Castiel shampooed him four times. Still, he does not want to wait another second. The flight to California will take way too long already. At some point Gabriel and Meg join them, helping them pack whatever Castiel deems necessary. They all walk out of the Institute together, and Dean is surprised to see a plane waiting for them. “Don't ever say I never did anything for you, little brother.” Gabriel says to Castiel as he hugs him goodbye. “I'll follow in a few days, we just have to take care of Megs working contract first.” Gabriel grins at the incredulous look Castiel gives him. “What? You didn't think I actually had to stay here, did you? I just wanted to keep you company.” They hug again and then Castiel enters the plane, ready to start his life.
“It’s quarter past 4. You slept for about 11 hours.” Even though Castiel never experienced it himself, he understood how weird the whole situation must be for Dean. Especially since John never prepared him for this. All things considered, Dean was acting extremely normal and seemed pretty relaxed.
“What?” Dean asked, stepping away from Castiel as he turned to look at him. “Not like they don't deserve it.”
Castiel hummed to himself as he set the table. It was one of those old rock songs that Dean made him listen to over and over again, insisting that this was the only acceptable music to listen to. Castiel smiled to himself as he set down two glasses. He didn't much care for classic rock, but like with everything that Dean was enthusiastic about, he enjoyed watching Dean listen to it. This particular one had been stuck in his head for days now as Dean had played it several times after Castiel had admitted he kind of liked it.
Dean remembered the way he had felt when thinking about somebody else touching Castiel’s wings and tried to imagine how he would react to Castiel saying what he had just said. He reached out and placed one hand on Castiel’s knee, searching physical contact, smiling even wider when Castiel shimmied a little closer, his leg brushing against Dean’s now.
“He is still under Azazel's control and beat up Meg. She was lucky that she could sedate him. Get your asses over to his room. And open a window, it reeks in here.” Gabriel did not wait for further questions and simply stormed out again, leaving Castiel and Dean worried and confused.
“You still must have many questions.” Castiel offered, hoping that explaining everything would make it easier for Dean to stay relaxed.
“Metatron here says we might just have to wait it out. Time should weaken the link between Azazel and the patient. Eventually it could just fade on its own.”
Castiel looked down at his food, his non-existent appetite turning into nausea.  He’d been so worried about Meg finding out that his family thought they were dating, but he should have been focusing on protecting the Winchesters.  He hadn’t wanted Michael to know he was still in contact with them, especially after the Christmas party.
He sat in bed, legs crossed over the covers, and unfolded Dean’s latest letter. The moon was bright as it poured in through the windows and spread over the floor, its light as cold and pale and clean as flesh in an open coffin for mourners to pay tribute to. A shroud of wispy clouds hung over it.
And then Hannah materialized at his side.  She was in a simple black dress, and had a headset on.  She shot Castiel a small, hidden smile, and he did his best to return it without it seeming too shaky.  She said, “Excuse the interruption, sir, but the mayor just arrived.”
Chevy shook her head again before bowing it slightly.  Sam offered her a smile and reached forward to stroke her neck.  “Easy,” he whispered again.
Castiel leaned back against the bricks, looking down at his feet.  He was stepping in an icy puddle, even though it hadn't snowed in days.  He tried to remind himself that need was different than want.  It was different than love.
“But,” Sonny added, sparking a bit of hope.  He held up a finger.  “I can tell you this: our Lord has a tendency of testing us.”
“Must have once been the field where Sam burned your bones,” Cas confirmed. It was bleak, even for them. Even bleaker, Cas told him, “Sam woke up in a crematorium on the other side of the state.”
Once in the house, Dean sat Cas down on one of the chairs at the table.  He pulled Cas’ arms around to the back, ignoring the uncomfortable grunt Cas gave at being manhandled.  He re-fastened the shackles behind the chair, confident that it would hold the witch.
Dean stayed still for a long moment, deciding whether or not to follow—even though he knew he didn’t have a choice. Still, he lingered, and picked up the moonshine bottle. There were still some dregs at the bottom. He tried to get them out by shaking the bottle over his mouth, but it was no use. Frowning, he tossed it back onto the hay and picked himself up.
Castiel sat still for a moment, her words turning over in his mind. He supposed she was right. Boston wasn’t far. He could be there in two hours by train. Perhaps he could go there for a weekend, surprise Dean like Dean was always surprising him. It might help, just to see Dean again. It might give Castiel the peace he needed to get through the rest of Dean’s absence.
Castiel nodded. He didn’t know when that would be, but he hoped it wasn’t any time soon. If he was returning home, he wanted time to mentally prepare himself.
“So, Castiel, you from the area?” Mr. Masters asked conversationally as he took the steaming meatloaf and potatoes from out of the oven. Meg went to one of the cabinets and pulled out a serving plate.
Sam shrugged again, in the way he did when he was happy but trying to downplay it.  “Over the weekend.”
Cas slipped his hand out of Dean's and walked across the dock towards the bank.  His footsteps thumped dully against the wood, keeping time with the slight knock of the side of the boat against the fenders.  Dean stared after him, waiting for Cas to say something—to do something—anything—to either make him the happiest guy alive or cause all his hopes to come crashing down around him.  Either one would be better than this twisting bundle of nerves pushing its way up from Dean's stomach to his throat.
“Worse than the last one.” Was Castiel complaining? He didn’t care. “I know I asked for work at the firm, but all I’ve gotten since are the same dull, tedious assignments. We’ll never draw in more readers with these.” He was beginning to think his father was punishing him for not wanting a wife.
He heard Zach continue coldly: “So, it’s her. Trust me, this has been in the making for a while. Her brother wasn’t too gung-ho about her marrying the boss’ son. Didn’t want any favoritism, you see. But he was happy enough to get a promotion and not have to pay a dowry. Castiel lives, Daphne gets a husband, Chuck gets his heir, and I keep my job. And, well, we kept wondering when Abaddon would come collect on that favor we owed her, but that doesn’t matter much now that she’s dead.”
Nodding, Raphael hummed.  He came level with Castiel on the other side of the desk.  “If you found this alleged proof, what was your plan for it?”
Dean was saying, “Anyway, what d’you say I swing by and pick you up?  We could grab something eat before starting up again. No way I’m leaving this state without a slice of key lime pie—.”
“Knew you’d be in here,” he said, pointing what was left of his sandwich at Cas in an accusatory way before taking a big bite out of it. His fingers and cheeks were pretty warm now, after the painful pins and needles that came with thawing out the frigidness from them. “You need to shake up your schedule.”
He sighed through his nose, seeing the air fog around him, and ignored her comment. “We should be there soon.” His cheeks were numb, and he’d also lost feeling in his fingers long ago, but that could have very well been from the loss of circulation in Meg’s hold. He squinted at the path ahead, trying to pick out the names above the residence halls’ doors. There were vague impressions of lines and words, but he needed to get closer to see them.
From her lean on the counter next to Dean, Claire placed her chin in her hand, turning her face away.
"Hey, Cas," Sam said, standing up as Dean led Cas towards the sofa.  Cas hadn't bothered to take off his coat, which meant he probably wasn't staying long.  Dean pretended he hadn't cooked an extra helping of pasta earlier just in case Cas was hungry when he stopped by.  If Cas wasn't staying, Dean wouldn't offer.
They carried the body over to one of the silver slabs in the center of the room and unzipped the body bag the rest of the way. Just like the girl’s face, the skin on the rest of her body was clean and flawless. She barely even had any birthmarks that Dean could see, but he didn’t look that hard. Even though she was dead, it still felt like a weird invasion of privacy to have some naked chick right out there in the open, even if she was cold and pale and looked a little bit like a wax doll at this point.
.  Heard you the first time, Clarence."  She pressed the sole of her boot into the bottom of the fence, making it bulge inward.  "It's cool.  We only screwed like, once, right?  No biggie."
Damn it.  He felt some of the moisture in his eyes fall down from his lashes.  The lights along the road were twinkling hazily, sharp rings haloing them in a blur.  Dean tried to blink them back into focus.
“Hi, welcome to the Lebanon Diner. Pick any booth you like,” she said, gesturing to the screen set into the counter. Dean blinked down at it, thrown. The screen depicted icons of tables, some of them green, some yellow, and some red.
He did another cursory look around, coming up satisfied. He pulled down the corners of his mouth and nodded. “Okay,” he said to himself, and pocketed his knife.
The chair came crashing down to all four legs with a thud. Balthazar told her, “He’s still single until there’s a ring on it, darling.”
But Dean’s brows popped. “Uh, try again,” he said, and Castiel didn’t understand. He especially didn’t understand when Dean stepped closer and reached for his face with an expression of determination. Everything in Castiel suddenly shut down—his thoughts, his heartbeat, his headache.
Dean’s grip on his shoulders tightened as he scrambled for purchase against the wave of pleasure.  His hips began to press against Cas’ thigh, seeking out friction. He heard himself say Cas’ name.
Cas' expression turned fond and adoring at that before his cell phone vibrated with a text on the counter next to them.  He hummed out a surprised sound, and then drew away to pick up his phone.  Dean busied himself stirring the pasta and sauce.
Dean shifted. He put his chin on Castiel’s chest and smiled up at him. “’Cause I like you, and what I say goes.”
Dean hauled himself up the stairs next to the loading dock, hearing the tin rattle hollowly under his boots with every step.  The railings on either side of him were biting cold in the chilly night when he brushed his finger against them. The air carried the iron scent of blood, and Dean tried to attribute that to the oncoming fall weather rather than any toxic used syringes discarded in the dumpsters or anything else unsanitary.  But, now that he really knew what was going on at this hospital, he wasn’t putting anything past the staff.
"You nearly toppled Evangelist," Castiel told him.  "The town went into a recession.  Many people lost their jobs, their livelihoods."
Michael was standing on the other side of the room.  His expression was taut, shoulders rigid, eyes murderous.  Balthazar was hovering just a step behind him, and he looked almost remorseful.
And, strangely, there was a voice in his head telling him that Michael was only looking out for him.  Dean had lied to him, after all.  Dean knowingly withheld information pertinent to Castiel's life and family.  But that didn't warrant cutting him out of his life, and it certainly needn't be punishable by jail time.  Castiel wasn't that dramatic.
They went upstairs together, making a left at the top of the stairwell. Castiel had found his way back from the hallway many times after he’d gotten lost. He just had to retrace his steps. However, when he got to the spot that should have opened up to the dead end hallway, there was nothing. It was a wall and a door leading into an untouched bedroom.
Dean didn’t answer.  He clamped his jaw shut, deciding to go with anger.  What the hell was Cas doing, standing around his car like that?  Dean should get in and run his ass over.
Dean shared a look at Sam, who lifted his brows in an exasperated way but didn’t look like he was about to argue.  Dean wouldn’t either.  It was Sonny’s right to protect his own charges.
Michael looked around to Castiel, his visage dancing in the heat’s haze. He said, “Remember, no second chances.” There was a flap of wings, and he was gone. Castiel felt Dean go with him. It emptied out the contents of his chest.
Sam started awake, blinking in the blue flickering light of the TV as his eyes adjusted to the darkness.  Dean glanced at him briefly before returning his eyes to the door. The knock sounded again.
For a long time, he thought Balthazar wouldn’t. Balthazar lingered, his eyes a sympathetic touch to the side of Castiel’s cheek. Then, he breathed out and slouched toward the door. Castiel refused to look in his direction.
"Hey, Dean."  There was music and clattering in the background, sounding like he was in a diner or a bar. John's voice was soft and tired over the line.  Dean wondered what time zone he was in.
“If—Well, if you still want to,” Dean said, sounding a little nervous now.  “We don’t have to.  I just thought . . .”
Dean paused, the knife still in his hand, and looked up through his lashes.  His gaze slid over to the side then, to connect with Jo's.  She was sitting at the counter with a textbook in front of her.
“It’s gonna get wrinkled.”  He grunted, and let the seatbelt snap back against him.  “God, look at me. Wearing a tux, on my way to some rich fundraiser that the
He turned his focus back on their comrades.  “Someone go fetch Lucifer.  I think it’s high time we ended this charade.”
He told Dean about Gabriel.  About the pranks he used to play on their siblings, always pulling Castiel into them as his accomplice, even when Castiel was too young to comprehend what they were doing.  About the candy and chocolates he always hoarded in his pockets. About the park he used to take Castiel and Anna to when he was a teenager and they were still children. It was the same park Castiel frequently took Claire and Jack.
It only made her more embarrassed, but she was biting down on a smile. Her eyes flickered to the doorway. “Does it ever get confusing, with my dad and Castiel both there?”
“All right, okay,” Sam cut in, breaking up the fight before it could get any worse.  That was lucky, because Dean felt himself simmering.  He couldn’t stop looking at that luggage.  Sam leaned forward and went on, “Cas, what else did she say?”
Sam and Cas shared a glance, the moment between them forgotten for now, and they both walked back over to the till.  Garth was answering, “I heard one of the firefighters did.  And one of the johns who was inside at the time.  I think maybe a couple of the townsfolk who helped to put it out, too, but I’m not sure.”
Concern was still lining Cas’ forehead, but he seemed to relax marginally.  He said, “You’re bleeding.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed, and Dean considered the fact that Cas would lose everything, too.  He had just as much at stake as anyone else in the town.
Cas went rigid, everything about his stance suggesting confusion. He looked around, and sure enough, his forehead was pinched and his eyes were narrowed. Dean let out a whoop of laughter, and jumped up and down to get his attention. Cas’ face slackened, and a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. Dean saw his name being formed on Cas’ lips, and really it was ridiculous. There was no way Cas—blind as a bat Cas—should have seen him, especially when he was packed like a sardine in the crowd.
Yes, he was very drunk. It didn’t stop him from taking another drink. He kept Dean’s eyes when he did, just because he wanted to see Dean’s reaction to his words. Predictably, Dean’s brows popped in a mixture of shock and humor—and embarrassment. Castiel liked to watch Dean squirm.
When they were both on their feet, Castiel took a step towards the pews, expecting Dean to do the same. But Dean grabbed him hard by the wrist again and spun Castiel back around, into him. Before Castiel knew it, Dean’s other hand was cradling his jaw tenderly and his lips were on his.
Castiel passed his hand anxiously across the back of his neck.  Every nerve in his body was on edge. He’d thought about sex more that night than he had perhaps all year.
“Oh!” Cas said, eyes flashing.  He pulled out his phone and started tapping on the screen.  “I would have been standing here for hours waiting for it to arrive.”
It was the fifth box they’d carried up that day, and there were still a few more in the flatbed of Castiel’s truck. Two suitcases of clothes were in the backseat of the Impala, as well. Castiel really didn’t know he’d had so much stuff until he had to pack it up to move.
“Try again.” Castiel pressed frantic kisses to Dean’s face—beneath his eyes, his nose, the corner of his mouth, his temple and the scar on his chin and between his brows. As he mouthed at Dean’s jaw, he muttered encouragements. Things like
His thoughts were buzzing frantically through his head. His eyes remained wide open, staring up at the ceiling.
Aches and pains were far from his worst problem, though. One woman had screamed at him for not selling her a winning scratch off lottery game, and she only yelled louder when he pointed out that he wasn’t aware what the outcome would be when she purchased it. On top of that, there was an incident with the slushy machine that left a mess of blue, sticky ice on the floor and the front of his jeans.
She scanned the medical records, humming.  "Well, looks like your vitals are good.  There wasn't too much smoke inhalation.  And your fluids are back up.  Burns weren't that severe, but we'll have to keep medicating them with ointment for at least a week.  But that's something you can do from home with a prescription."
But it appeared too late, because Dean asked, “I mean, it’s not like you’ve been in love with everyone you’ve ever fucked, right?”
Dean scoffed, anger flaring hot inside him.  “Appropriate?” he echoed, the word twisting the air into something crooked around it.  He didn’t know if that or
It was mid-February, and after weeks of think tanks and brainstorming sessions, the teams were running their ideas by the executives.  Rowena had all her teams working on it, because it was a big account, and if they won it, it’d be a lot more money in Dick Roman’s bank account.  Not that any of the grunts would see much payout, but they still worked day in and day out. They’d been in the meeting all morning, and Dean had been hoping there’d be a break for lunch.  His dreams were shot down when Rowena told everyone they’d be bringing food in.
Instead, Dean leaned towards him again, placing one hand on Castiel’s chin before kissing him in a way that could only be described as possessively. “No.” He finally admitted when he pulled back, leaving Cas a little breathless. “We should go back inside, I can feel myself getting a sunburn.” Dean decided and got up, holding out one hand to help up Castiel. Castiel totally ignored it at first, his wings slowly fading into seemingly nothing as he stood up on his own. Then he took Dean’s hand, smiling. “I don’t think it is possible for you to get sunburnt anymore, handsome.” He said and Dean squeezed his hand, smiling at the nickname. “It is possible for you to get sunburnt though and I didn’t see you put on any sunscreen this morning.” Castiel chuckled at that and walked back around the building with Dean.
“So, what did you think? Awesome, isn’t it?” Dean asked as soon as the credits started rolling, looking at Castiel expectantly. “It’s definitely… something” Castiel said hesitant, not wanting to disappoint Dean. Immediately, Dean’s smile dropped . “You hated it.” Castiel blushed at that, hoping Dean wouldn’t notice in the half-dark. “I wouldn’t say I hated it… it’s just a bit… unrealistic?” Dean let out a low chuckle at that, swinging his legs off the couch and sitting up.
Without another thought he throws on the first clothes he sees and pulls himself into his Continental. Shaking fingers Google map the center of the US on his smartphone. 13 hours from Baudette, Minnesota to middle of nowhere Kansas.
Pushing right past the officer, Castiel races towards the sedan. He’s got to see her, got to know that she’s okay. But he’s being pulled to a stop with the ambulance still blocking his line of sight.
“Should I be worried for Claire that you need to get ahold of him so badly?” The playfulness in Dean’s voice is gone leaving just worry.
“I feel pretty stupid, I’m not sure what hospital Claire was taken to. I’d have looked it up on the Google, but in my haste, I didn’t grab my charger before I took off down here. Used most of my battery on directions.”
“Hi, Mary!” He tries, keeping his voice loud and cheerful to break through to her. It works well enough to get her to stop wailing, but the steady stream of tears continues.
Maybe it takes hours to actually get around to putting the groceries away, but they can wait. Because for once, Dean and Castiel are done waiting.
“Geez, sorry. Didn’t realize that Cas didn’t want the morphine I almost got caught stealing.” Even without sight, Cas can picture the so called ‘bitch face’ that Sam is wearing. Two additional sets of footprints fall in behind Sam. “Move over so Eileen can help me set it up.”
“DADDY!” She yells despite the tiny distance from the living room to the kitchen, “AM I IN CHARGE OF JACK?”
“No aunties, unless one of your uncles got married since I’ve last heard from them. I have an aunt, Amara. So she’s your great-aunt. But she’d probably feel old if you called her that, so if you ever talk to her I’d stick with aunt.”
“Yes, that would be incredibly helpful.” Castiel steps back with a sigh and lets her crawl in to hook it up.
“Sammy!” She repeats as if saying it again will clear it all up, “He helps sad little kids all the time, daddy. He can help us rescue Jack from our evil grandma!”
“Can’t you be my daddy?” she asks with her head rested in Dean’s shoulder. It hurts to hear it, but really Castiel is nothing more than a stranger with shared DNA to Claire.
With an angry huff, Cas raises from his pillow and stalks towards the wall. With a low level of anger bubbling inside of him he pounds his hand against their shared wall a few times hoping that his neighbor gets the hint to turn it down. There’s a clashing sound like pots and pans falling to the ground and moments later the volume is cut in half. While it might not be as quiet as he’d like it, Cas takes it as a win and goes to fix himself a cup of tea. He’s just pouring the water into his mug when his phone signals a new message.
Jessica turns to Claire, who is still happily sitting in the wheelchair. “How about you hop in so I can show your daddy how to do this.”
“I’d rather you let me continue holding onto you,” he says much too timidly for a former angel of the Lord, “I can’t exactly see and it helps to have some form of connection to keep me from feeling like I’m still falling.”
“Okay, so until you’re better at this I’ll put it forward-facing. Claire is still small enough that she could maybe rear face for a while longer, but it’s not necessary at her age and size.”
He moans when his dom’s grip tightens in his hair, moans again when he beats out his gag reflex and is able to deepthroat. But nothing beats the moan that comes when his dom starts fucking into his throat.
“Okay fine.” Dean relents, missing the warmth of Castiel’s breath on his neck as soon as he sits back in the chair, “But take a video with me anyway. I want to make sure I remember asking you to be my boyfriend.”
“Mommy?” A little voice comes from the bed and it pulls more tears from Castiel. “Is that you, mommy?”
The show they're talking about is Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir. It's on Netflix if you wanna check it out, for being a kid's show it's not half bad. (wow can you tell I'm a parent?)
“Yeah, welcome to the club, buddy.” Dean chuckles out, “At least when I met Ben, Lisa was around to teach me the whole parenting thing.”
“Hello, Dean.” The man rumbles out, the sound coming from in front of Dean, sending a shiver down his spine. He’d never considered himself to have a voice kink before, but damn if this new dom couldn’t make him cum from just talking, “Beings this is our first session together I’m going to need you to tell me what your safeword is.”
“Missouri Mosley, child protection services.” The woman’s voice is soft and kind with a southern twang to it, but that doesn’t stop the nerves in Castiel’s stomach as the woman sits in the empty chair next to him, “Jimmy I presume.”
Dean sputters a bit in response before leaning back against the couch, “Fine you can keep the damn dog. But it’s not sleeping in the bed with us and if it so much as looks at the steaks I’ve got planned for supper tonight we’re gonna have a problem.”
“To the batmobile!” Claire announces with excitement, pointing in the general direction of the front entrance. The three of them make their way through the small parking lot to Castiel’s car. Claire giggles at it, which is a better reaction than most people give him anyway.
“Thank you so much, Lisa.” A small wave of relief washes over him, “Is everyone in this town so nice or is it just because of what happened?”
Firm hands rub up and down where the rope was digging into his skin. His mystery dom steps forward, his hard cock pressing into Dean’s ass. Hands wrap around the back of his own, taking control of Dean’s movements. One hand sweeps up his stomach to tease at his nipples, the other sinks low but not quite low enough. Dean doesn’t know which to focus on.
“I dunno. Just kinda easier to talk to I guess.” And the way he says it has Dean thinking maybe, just maybe, he’s flirting back.
“So what’cha need then?” Officer Winchester asks, kicking his feet up on his desk earning a shake of the head from his superior.
“Good boy.” The words send a shiver down him that goes straight to his cock. “Ah,” the voice comes out smug, “you want to be my good boy, don’t you Dean?”
It’s an innocent question and he finds himself chuckling, “Yes, I have lots of family.” One of them wants me dead, but that’s not something he’ll tell her.
Castiel leans forward, closing the gap between them and effectively shutting Dean up from continuing on his rant. The kiss is anything but chaste as the two of them allow every emotion that’s been held back to come flooding forward.
Just as he’s setting his phone down there’s a crash and a splash in the kitchen followed by a quiet, “I spilled a little.”
“Eh! Jesse, it is him.” He hears on the other end, “Okay buddy, I’m going to help you out. I can’t give you his info, but I’m going to text him right now that he needs to give you a call. That okay?”
Quick as a cat, the child is up and digging through her toy box. Castiel pulls himself off of the couch to go find the secret doll stash. Going into Dean’s room is nothing new, they’d spent plenty of time hanging out in each other’s room. Getting on his knees to pull a shoe box out from under the bed was a whole other thing. He’d seen it before, of course. He’d just always assumed it was sex toys. Instead he finds half mangled Barbie dolls in questionable fashion.
Jack huffs in resignation, but leaves to go wake Eileen anyway, leaving Dean alone with Castiel once again. The silence that falls between them is just on the wrong side of uncomfortable.
“Dean, he literally fell from Heaven. If anyone’s earned some oxy it’s him.” Sam’s voice is fuzzy, but it tugs Castiel towards consciousness.
“So much!” Dean says it with a laugh. He could go on forever listing ways that he isn’t perfect, it was practically his superpower. “Just a lot of pressure all the time. It’s all got to be perfect. Perfect grades, perfect attendance, perfect fucking extracurriculars, perfect big brother to Sam, perfect stupid girl they keep pushing me towards.”
“I’m in witness protection. My alias is James Novak, I won’t give you my real name for my own safety. Zachariah Adler is the man who had the gun to my head tonight. While I was overseas I uncovered a faction of the military that was involved with a third party monetizing the war. First Lieutenant Adler was a part of that faction.”
At the first sight of the vodka Castiel had looked skeptical, claiming to have never had a drink before. A part of Dean felt bad for letting his tutor get drunk, but he feels too good right now to have the logical side of him win any kind of argument, “So you’ve really never drank before?”
“I’ve got all kinds of time, just let me know the important stuff so I know if there’s something bigger than us going on.” Fuck it, might as well get it all out.
: So then after he’s kissed me fucking stupid, he’d pull back just a bit. He’s got these fucking sexy lips, bet they’d be all plush and wet from the kiss.
“Well! That’s great, Claire.” The nurse nods along with her before turning her attention to Castiel. “So this must be your angel then?”
“Thank you for everything.” Castiel can feel his eyes watering as he looks over the sheet of paper, barely noticing the social worker taking her leave from the room.
Fuck, except he doesn’t have a clue where the nearest hospital even is or have a way to get there. He supposes the station should know where they’d taken Claire beings they had gotten ahold of the hospital last night. Looks like he’s heading back to the station then.
“I wouldn’t say I drink a lot, just sometimes I guess.” Mostly the truth. Senior year stress had increased the drinking for sure, but it wasn’t near often enough for him to worry about it.
For the second time, Castiel is rudely awoken. This time, by Claire jumping on him, knees hitting him right in his stomach.
“You should have seen his face, Dean!” Eileen laughs, “He’d made up his mind the second he heard it whining.”
“Daddy?” Castiel isn’t sure if it’s the little voice that’s saying it or the fact that she’s calling him daddy without a second thought, but his heart swells enough he thinks it’ll burst.
“Watch it Winchester.” She scolds, but the smile never leaves her face, it reminds him of how he and his mother had been before she passed.
“Sam is a half hour away with some of ‘the good stuff.’” Under less shitty circumstances Dean might have smiled at the boy making finger quotes like Castiel does, but now all he cares about is hearing that Cas won’t be in pain much longer.
Without so much as a parting goodbye, Ellen’s flicking the lights off and heading out the door. There’s a light in the stairwell and in the hall upstairs, so at least he wasn’t left in pitch black.
Beings Claire seems more okay with going home, he figures it’s safe to slide out of the booth. Claire follows, climbing off of Dean’s lap.
“Mine is bumble, however, I would also like to utilize the stoplight system as well in case I'd like to check in with you. Do you understand the stoplight system?”
The trilling sound of an awaiting Skype calls shocks Castiel out of his Tuesday afternoon mediation. With a groan he stretches himself out to check which laptop it's coming from, surprised to find it's Dean's laptop rather than his own. Typically his roommate only gets calls on Sunday afternoons to chat with his niece and always ends up in his room with the door closed to avoid disturbing Castiel's mediation.
Looking over the information he finds the number for her daycare. The one that she was probably supposed to be at right now. Castiel grabs his phone off the charger and dials the number. Can’t be much different than calling in sick to work, right?
But when it comes time to open his eyes, Castiel is met with darkness. Despite the searing pain, he brings his hands up to his face, rubbing at his eyes in the hopes of clearing out whatever is in the way. There are no bandages, but he rubs clumsily at his eyes anyways before trying again. Still, he sees nothing.
“It’s actually not you I need,” he starts, getting interrupted by an almost disappointed sounded ‘oh’.
Zachariah must see something change in his face, because he starts laughing. It’s deep and sickening.
“I’m asking you to trust me on this.” There’s the usual gruffness, but maybe a bit of desperation as well. It’s hard to tell when everything feels stuck between reality and dream.
“As soon as you let me.” Dean is grinning now too, consequences be damned. This fucker right here was worth coming out to his dad for.
He doesn’t even notice the officer stepping around Zachariah towards him. Well, he does notice, just doesn’t respond. Ambulances are paradeing towards the scene. EMT’s jumping out to meet the officer holding Claire. HIS Claire.
“No! Absolutely not, Samantha!” Dean scolds as soon as he sees the wiggly little thing in Sam’s arms.
: My apartment is small as fuck, couch is only about 5 feet from the door. He’d see it and drag me up onto my feet and throw me down on it.
“Charlie, wait!” Claire scoots out of the booth, and meets Charlie where she turns around, “I drew this for you. It’s all of us. See, that’s you with the crown! And that’s your handmaiden and giant! And over here your noble warriors. And I drew my daddy too because you said you want to play with him. But I don’t know what he wants to be so I made him a warrior just like me.”
Castiel’s stomach drops as his eyes dart towards the car. The back window is shattered and blood glistens a deep and dark against the light interior as it pours from the holes in Amelia’s head.
“Mommy said she didn’t have any family.” She looks up at him, her blue eyes meeting his, “Do you have a family?”
“Okay, again I’m sorry about trying to get ahold of you so early. I don’t know how much of a morning person you are, but I’d probably be pissed at someone doing this to me.”
“Are you trying to get me into bed with you, angel?” Dean teases even as Cas feels the thin mattress dip. It’s a little odd being so close on such a small bed. He can feel Dean’s breath hot on his shoulder and there is an additional heaviness where Dean settles his arm over Cas’s stomach.
“Seriously, don’t worry about it.” She shakes her head at him, “Honestly, it’s nice to know that you care enough to accept the help.”
“Tap your foot once for yellow, twice for red. Right now I want you to show me how good you can suck my cock. Can you do that for me?”
As soon as his phone buzzed with the new message Cas felt himself going over the edge. The image of Dean beneath him on a couch that in his mind was his own. And maybe, just maybe, he pictured himself praising Impala rather than his neighbor. But with no face to the name, it’s Dean’s he sees as he cums.
“Well yeah!” Sam argues passionately while trying not to jostle the pup too much, “How could I justify dropping a couple grand on a different dog and leaving this poor thing in a shelter just because one is easier to train. I mean, we’ve fought God. I think we can handle a puppy.”
Calling to quit sucks, but having to leave a voicemail sucks just a little less. It’s brief and leaves no room for having to explain himself further than a “This is Jimmy Novak, sorry for the late notice but I quit effective immediately.”
“Geez, you make a guy late for a Skype call and drives off without you.” There’s only adoration in Dean’s voice as he talks about his brother.
“No, of course not. I just found out that I have a nephew who's living with his grandmother while his father serves times and my other brother wants me to get him out of her care and-”
Dean smirks at the chat. Even sexting Angel was being a total sweetheart. The man’s ability to be nothing but kind is one of the biggest reasons Dean finds himself chatting with Angel more and more often, sex completely aside.
Castiel sits back, watching them snark back and forth across the aisle. It’s much lighter than the kind of bickering he grew up with. There were no harsh remarks dealt out for maximum emotional damage, just playful remarks that had everyone smiling like the sun.
“Charlie.” She announces, sticking her hand out to Castiel. “I don’t actually work here, but I saw you with Claire and I put it together that you were Jimmy so I told Ellen I’d bring your food over for you so I could stop and chat.”
“Me.” Dean says, reaching behind them to the back of the couch where he’d stashed his gift. “I didn’t wrap it. Kinda seemed pointless when you can’t see.”
Zachariah raises his gun instead of obeying the orders, this time facing Castiel. Another shot goes off and Zachariah is lying in a heap on the grass. There are officers rushing towards the car, pulling Amelia and Claire out. Years of military training and all Castiel can do is stand and watch as his ex is pronounced dead on the scene.
“Just making sure. If you want, I can have my partner Officer Harvelle drive it up after they deal with the scene. I notice it’s still running so I’d assume the keys are in it.”
: Like always, hottie’ll bang on the wall but fuck him right? So I just turn it up and get back to doing my thing. I imagine he’d get pissed about that and then come bang on my door to yell at me about it.
“I’ll see what I can do.” He chuckles at her response, pulling out his phone to give this Crowley guy a call.
It takes Jack stuffing pillows behind Castiel’s back to allow him to sit up better for Dean to realize he’s still clinging to Castiel’s hands like a lifeline. He starts to let go, but Cas clings tighter.
“Her name is Megara Honeybee Winchester; if you have any qualms about that I would be glad to let her take your spot on the bed and you can sleep in the dogbed.”
“Thank you, Crowley. I’ll be able to see them whenever you’re available.” Hopefully, when Claire is at daycare, this man doesn’t exactly scream child-friendly.
“It’s time to be a person!” She declares, bouncing up and down on him. As much as he hates mornings, Castiel can’t bring himself to hate waking up like this.
Finally unable to resist any longer, Cas wraps his hand around his cock. His head rolls back in relief as he pictures Dean on his knees in front of him. Impala’s mention of deepthroating brings up memories of his girlfriend from his freshman year of college. The feel of his cock hitting the back of Meg’s throat, the cocky smirk as he tightened his grip in her hair.
“Fuck, I’m not heartless.” He grumbles, reaching over to scratch it behind its half-bitten off ear. “So what’ll you name her? Gotta be something badass like Buffy or Athe-”
“Huh, she’s actually the one who got me into law enforcement in the first place.” The officer looks a little lost in thought before shaking his head a bit to regain focus, "Long way from home, you have anywhere to stay here?"
Dean nods greedily, wanting desperately to get his face fucked by his mystery dom. He isn’t left waiting. One hand grips into his hair, the other lines the cock up to his lips. Dean wets his lips before leaning forward and wrapping his lips around it, finding it to be perfectly thick. The dom drops his hand from the cock, now using both hands to grip into Dean’s hair.
Castiel shifts a little nervously in his chair at the sudden excitement, “Yes sir. She recently transferred from Baudette where I was relocated, but she remained on my case.”
He sighs heavily, not really knowing how to answer, “The bad man Jody told you about, he was really mad at me. I was trying to hide from him and I was scared that you and your mommy would get hurt if you stayed with me.”
“Dean,” Castiel interrupts him before he can argue back, a firm hand holding his hunter back, “If you don’t let your brother give me my puppy right this second there will be no birthday sex.”
“Hey,” Dean starts, his voice much softer as he pulls Claire up into his lap, “I know it’s rough without your mom. Everything is different and nothing feels quite right, but you’ll get there eventually. You’re always going to miss her, but I promise you kiddo, she never really left you.”
Pulling out the other envelope, Castiel can see that his hands are shaking. Inside are pictures, just as his brother promised. A little boy golden haired boy, held tight in the arms of his Uncle Gabriel. Another was Jack as an infant cradled by Grandpa Chuck. The last picture was likely the most recent judging by Jack’s size. He’s dressed for Easter at church. Castiel would recognize the little purple and blue bunny tie they had all worn anywhere. But Jack isn’t smiling. It’s Lilith whose holding his hand, and there is a solemn look on his face.
He’s the only family that Claire has left thanks to Zachariah. However, Castiel has never so much as babysat before...
“How come you’re crying?” The little voice startles him, coming from the where the hall meets the tiny living room.
“Well, like I said I’m looking for a place to rent in Lebanon. Dean recommended me.” He adds, looking down at Ellen’s note.
“I can do anything I can do.” She says hopping off of him with confidence that’s rather terrifying coming from someone so small.
Castiel glances over at the booth where his daughter is situated with Dean and Ben. They’re all giggling over something. The sight is a beautiful thing and it makes him want this all the more, lack of parenting skills be damned.
As the officer stands up and begins clearing the notes scattered on the table Castiel realizes he never got the man's name.
“Whoa, I’m gonna stop you right there buddy. Sam is my brother, I don’t know what Claire was telling you but that’s as far as that goes.” For a reason Castiel doesn’t have time to focus on, he actually breathes a sigh of relief at hearing they’re brothers.
“No shit, Sherlock.” Dean responds after setting down the cheap bottle of caramel apple flavored vodka on the stack of long forgotten textbooks between the two of them.
“Fuck you’re hot.” And Dean is almost overwhelmed by how irresistible the smile he gets in return is, “Please tell me I get to know your name.”
Dean told himself he wasn’t going to fall apart, not while Castiel was still hooked up to machines. Despite that, he still finds himself blinking back tears and pulling Cas’s hand up to his lips.
“We sure you’re not suffering head trauma?” Officer Winchester quips as he fishes out the keys from a drawer. “Anyways, like I said it’s just parked right out back.
“Claire told me that Sammy could help me out with something and I’m trying to get ahold of him, but it’s early on a Saturday and I have no actual idea of who he is. I didn’t even think about the time, so if I woke you two up-”
“Ain’t no worry.” The officer nods, but moves his feet off his desk so he can click around on the desktop computer a bit. “She’s just over in Smith County Memorial, only a twenty-minute drive. I’ll print you off directions. Ask any nurse to borrow a charger, they’ve all got ‘em or know someone who does. Let’s be real, who doesn’t use their phone at work.”
“Yours or not, we’ve got two dead bodies and lots of questions.” Castiel turns to face him, how can he not get it? The officer steps closer, patting him almost reassuringly on the back, “Hey, I promise you that your daughter is in good hands. As soon as we’ve got our questions answered we’ll let you see her. Until then, I need you to cooperate, okay?”
“First of all,” Claire says back with enough sass that Castiel would have thought he was talking to a preteen and not a preschooler, “she made my baby cousin sad so I hate her.”
“Family doesn’t end in blood.” Ellen’s voice pulls Castiel’s focus from his daughter, “I been acting as these boys’ conscious long enough, I should know.”
“How much for the room anyway? Officer Winchester didn’t sa-” Before he can even finish he’s cut off by Ellen’s loud laugh.
“That would be perfect!” A little wave of relief washes over Castiel, at least this officer made it seem like Dean would be pretty okay with this. He rattles off his number to Office Cuevas.
It’s a tight squeeze to fit in the booth with them, Claire had stayed in her spot next to the wall leaving Castiel to sit next to Dean. It felt a little awkward at first, but as they eat and talk and joke, Castiel feels a little like he’s a part of their crowd
Castiel can’t help but smile at that. Of all the ways he saw this going, ice cream wasn’t what he expected. But, he supposes, children tend to find better ways than adults to cope with trauma. They way she’s said it reminds him of Gabriel, he’d always used ice cream as a coping mechanism when they were kids.
“Glad you’re feeling so good. I was worried you’d end up a sad or angry drunk.” Dean almost makes it a point not to wheel his chair back away, finding warmth being so close to Castiel. ”Good to know your a giggly drunk.”
“Yeah, she’s my not-actual Uncle Bobby’s friend’s daughter. My dad’s been pushing us together since we were fucking toddlers. Not like her mom or Bobby actually give a shit about the two of us getting together.”
“With what? You seem so perfect.” Castiel’s barely got the sentence out before Dean’s outright laughing at the statement.
Realization completely overshadows the child’s free use of insults, “Wait, Dean? Like the cop Dean?”
“Amelia didn’t, but you should definitely try it!” Charlie looks over to a booth on the other side of the bar. From where he’s sitting, Castiel can see one man and make out the back of the other’s head. The one he can see is wearing a similar plaid shirt and has longer brown hair.
: So uh I like to start with me just chilling in my living room kicking back a beer and listening to some records. Just relaxing you know?
“Ha, at least I lucked out at being the oldest.” Dean says, holding the front door for the others. Outside it’s still mostly warm.
The five of them come to an agreement on the order of the new world. Heaven and Hell will be locked away. Demons will be barred from making deals. Angels will be kept far from the temptations of humanity that skewed the views of Angels before. Even reapers are to be kept on a tighter leash, with Billie keeping a close eye on them to avoid unauthorized uses of their gates between worlds.
Panic starts up deep inside of him and he shoves it down as best he can. Darkness is part of life, he’s experienced it before. The fact that he’s semi-conscious would suggest that he isn’t in the Empty. It’s possible that the room lights are off. But even then he should be able to make out the shapes of his hands right in front of his face. Or the lights that the incredibly annoying machine next to him surely have. There should be something. Anything.
“Eh, only about an hour, but it’s not like they’re dating so I ain't too worried about it.” Dean answers, playing around with the radio settings until it’s on a classic rock station. “Worse case scenario is that Eileen gives me hell for it Tuesday at work.”
Dean kneels on the mat in the center of the room. His dom is due any minute now. Every nerve is on edge as he waits. The soft blindfold takes away his sight, the rough ropes he’s looped around his arms keeps him from touching. He’s dressed in nothing but black panties that barely contain him.
Dean’s face lights up with laughter filling his room with sound not caring that his brother is actually studying on the other side of the thin wall. Of course Castiel would take it seriously, he couldn’t get a reference to save his life, “It’s a- you know what, never mind. How ya’ feeling, buddy?”
They spent three days in Philly, with only a couple of hours dedicated to Cas canceling his viewing appointments with realtors and property owners, and going into Carver & Edlund Publishing to “regretfully” inform them he wouldn’t be taking the position, after all.  Dean was in the hotel room with him as Cas called that startup out in California accepting their offer. It was a little bit less money than what the publishing house had offered, and Dean stupidly tried to talk him out of it, but Cas seemed pretty adamant.
Castiel looked back up.  “Michael’s?” he echoed. It wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t the whole truth, either.  At least, that’s what he was banking on.
Dean tried not to blush, but he could feel the back of his neck heat up.  “I dunno, just an idea,” he excused. “You don’t have to bring it to the team or anything.  I’m just spitballing.”
But there was still life in him, and Castiel would not let it fade away.  He couldn’t. Not this life. This life that he’s held in his hands, mended its broken soul and mangled flesh, breathed back into being.  This life. The one that mattered to him more than his own.
His mind blurry, he sat back up again, trying to blink himself right. To the untrained eye, Cas looked pretty in control, but his lips were parted and his nostrils were flaring, and he was trying really hard to keep composure.
The others actively asked him questions to include him in their conversation, which was something he found he appreciated. They seemed interested in his life, and then fascinated when the conversation led him to admitting he’d had his own apartment since freshman year of college.
“Of course,” he said, setting the book aside. He left it open to the page she was on, because he couldn’t tell her to stop – even if they both knew their answer wouldn’t be in that book.
He was met with a derisive laugh.  "This goes way back.  I just don't know what it is.  But there were other fires, other families.  They all had ties to the Novaks, and all of them died the same way as Mary."
Of course, their father was long gone, too.  He stepped down from his position as chairman and CEO of Evangelist after Lucifer's transgression, leaving Michael to run the company.  Quickly after he retired, he rekindled his relationship with his sister, a woman Castiel had never met because of a falling out before he was born.  He left to visit her—in Hawaii?  California?  Dubai?  Castiel wasn't certain.  His father didn't keep tabs on his children, and he wasn't a man they could easily track down.  That was six years ago.  Castiel wondered when he would return—
They sat in silence for a long moment, and Dean could hear his heart pounding in his ears. He tried not to read too much into Cas’ response. He thought back to the barely there smile on Cas’ lips as they danced.
They all knew that bringing Jack home, raising him—it would change everything.  But everything already had changed, and maybe for the better.  They could be a family.
Castiel lifted his book off his knees, as if it wasn’t obvious. Dean’s face dawned with realization, and he seemed a little embarrassed. His cheeks colored slightly, and Castiel realized he had a smattering of freckles there. They crept up his temples and bridged his nose. Castiel wondered how many there were. Thousands. Millions. More than there were stars in the night sky.
It was odd.  He couldn’t help but notice that Dean had been avoiding eye contact for most of the night.  It wasn’t something Castiel was used to with him.
He shouldn’t have even gone in.  He should have stayed in bed. Because what was the point?  He was just going to get fired anyway.
He nodded, and thought that was the end of it, but she looked like she had more to say. He waited for her to either speak or get out.
“They should come out in a day or two,” Cas told him.  It took a second for Dean to remember he was talking about the stitches.
Castiel’s eyes widened instantly, his pulse stuttering and then hammering.  Perhaps the west was wilder than he thought.
"Yeah, it was him.  Award-winning smile and all."  Cas didn't laugh.  Neither did Dean.  He put his arm on the table and leaned into it.  "It sounded like Meg's dad worked for him.  Like Raphael's his boss."
Dean hummed with disinterest, because he couldn’t exactly argue. He wiped his hands on his jeans and reached forward to shuffle through some of the papers. One image caught his attention. Dean frowned, tilted his head to look at it better upside down. It was that strange star symbol he saw at the chapel in Boston, only this one didn’t have a circle around it.
Cas frowned though, perplexed.  “Dean’s very good at his job.” Dean ducked his head, trying not to blush too much.  And then Cas said, “What do you do?”
After, Dean stayed still, his posture curling downward while he caught his breath. He was damp and flustered all over, and he tried not to grimace at the stickiness on his stomach and ass. Beneath him, Cas was looking at up him, his chest rising and falling in audible breaths, his cheeks and chest blushing pink, his eyes clear blue.
Castiel didn’t mind, especially when he heard the fondness hidden beneath Dean’s words.  He always appeared so proud when he spoke of Sam. “You seem to take good care of him.”
“Hey!  Guys! Up here!” a familiar, perky voice called from a little ways up the line.  Charlie was jumping up and down, the white faux-fur cloak she wore bouncing with her.  She had a blue skirt beneath a white tunic, and accessorized with blue armbands and a headband, and a heavy fake-toothed necklace.  She had red markings in the shape of triangles on her face.
“Bring Dean back,” Castiel demanded, “or I will make sure you are never free, even if I have to live forever.”
The first time Dean had been arrested, he’d been thirteen, and they’d been passing through Arkansas.  It was for stealing a candy bar—and, yeah, okay, fine, some dude’s wallet—from the supermarket. His dad had left him to stew in jail all night before picking him up in the morning to learn his lesson.  But Dean wasn’t exactly the brightest bulb in the box, so the lesson really didn’t take.
“Fuck,” Dean said when the kiss broke, and Castiel had to agree.  Dean rolled Castiel onto his back and started kissing down his body, along the band of Castiel’s boxers.  His palms went to either of Castiel’s hips, and he glanced up to lock onto his eyes. “You good?”
“But that’s not Jimmy anymore,” Dean said, and the statement confused Castiel.  He tilted his head to the side as Dean went on, “It’s you, Cas. Jimmy’s dead—been dead a long time, and his body—,” he let out a sardonic breath.  “It was blown to smithereens, remember?
Dean was led back towards the house, the both of them trudging up the hill and across the patio.  The music was a lot louder inside, and the sound of laughter and talking was mixed with the clanging of cutlery.
Dean nodded, eyes still fixed on a point on Cas’s chest. “Yeah,” he agreed. Hopefully, he added, “How about just a couple more minutes, huh?”
would be how it ended? Dean tried to tell himself to stop being an idiot. Instead, he practically chewed a hole through his cheek.
There was a sharp intake of breath, and then Cas hummed, "Mm.  Yeah.  I'm awake."  He sounded way too groggy for that to be true.
Dean peered around the room, mostly empty now but for a few stragglers who glanced at the displays and plaques without fully reading them.  His eyes focused on something just over Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel looked around to find a case with a few rusted medical supplies, bottles, and tinctures.  There was also a poster depicting a colorful drawing of a mother with two round faced, happy looking children, an advertisement for something called Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup.
When Dean could speak again, the first thing he said was, “Cas.”  He grabbed Cas’ shoulders, pulling him into a fierce hug.
Castiel turned around fully and kept his expression impassive.  Sam already knew why. His eyes flitted back to the angel briefly.  “You sure she won’t—? You sure we’ll still be able to talk to her after?”
“You know,” he said slowly, stepping in closer, eyes hooded.  Castiel didn’t know what to do. Dean had been avoiding him all night, and he was probably only acting this way because he was drunk.  Dean was amorous towards everyone when he was drinking. It didn’t mean anything. And this was completely unfair, not to mention extremely frustrating in more ways than one.  “We could go again.”
He nodded, nerves alight inside of him. He didn’t know why. Dean had already complimented the piece, but perhaps he was just being polite. “It’s, um… A work in progress,” he attempted to preface.
Castiel’s face dropped.  Why did he even bother? “Well, I’m sorry, Dean.  I don’t own any hiking boots.”
"Is there anyone else in the building?" Cas eyes, even though it sounded like he already knew the answer.  No one was there.  It was just them.  Even if there was another person around, no human could run that quickly.
"Great," Dean said to his back, trying to push cheer.  "I'll go get him back inside.  Hey, I heard there's a pretty awesome aquarium in Boston.  Got penguins and everything.  If we get up bright and early, maybe we can hit it up tomorrow."
Dean rolled his eyes. He wasn’t letting Sam’s weird anti-Halloween attitude ruin his hard work. “Dude,” he griped. “We’ve been over this.
Suddenly, the phone started making a sound. His eyes widened. He hadn’t pressed anything. Was it broken?
Dean swallowed hard.  He couldn't picture ending up with anyone else.  Only Cas, he realized ruefully.  It wouldn't be right with anyone else.  He'd rather be alone, he thought, resigned.
He set Sam’s plate on the table next to him, then sat down in the opposite chair to eat his own meal. “So, what d’we got?” he asked, mouth full of meat and bread.
Cas' expression softened as he met Sam's eyes, and he nodded once.  Then, he turned his head back to Dean, gaze flickering up and down in a way that made Dean's skin prickle.  He tried to blame that on his metaphorical hackles going up, but deep down he knew that wasn't true.
When he got bored of coloring, Dean sat back against the couch cushion, trying not to yawn or admit the cold had wiped all his energy. He also pointedly ignored the ache in his chest when he noticed the neatly folded blanket and pillow on the opposite side of the couch. It was a little easier to bear when Cas sidled up next to him, fitting against Dean’s side. At first, Dean didn’t know if he was doing it on purpose or if the cushions dipped to push them together; but then Dean hooked his arm over the back of the couch, and Cas snuggled in closer to him.
“Just do it,” Dean said, practically begging. He didn’t need both of them mad at him at the same time. Cas challenged his stare for a half a second before snatching the keys.
Dean swallowed some of the coffee to buy himself time, and forced himself not to spit it back up no matter how cold it was.  "I don't—I like her just fine."
Castiel swallowed, but it didn’t shake loose the lump in his throat. He barely heard his own voice when he forced out, “Dean?”
He tried to tell himself this would be different. Dean wasn’t a classmate that he barely knew. Dean was… He was
Zachariah gave a heavy breath, almost sounding genuine, and leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees. “Mr. Wesson,” he said levelly. “Dean. If you truly do care for him, you know what you have to do. If you’re around, he’ll never grow to love Daphne. And, if he doesn’t love Daphne…”
When Meg arrived, Castiel stood up to greet her, and introduced her to his family.  She gave a little half-wave to each of them, and he could feel all their eyes on them.  It seemed like they were scrutinizing his every move, which may have been preposterous but it compelled him to take Zeke’s example and awkwardly give Meg a kiss on the cheek before they sat down.  It was quick, and she reacted by jerking away in surprise, and he felt his entire face heat up with embarrassment as he hoped no one saw the exchange.
“You read Latin,” Cas said. “Your brother is studying to become a lawyer. You shoot a gun better than anyone I’ve ever seen.”
Pressing his lips together, he nodded, and tried not to show how her words had affected him. He walked up to situate himself between her legs, and she draped her arms over his shoulders. She leaned in to press a kiss to his mouth, her lips parting almost instantly. She ran her fingers through the base of his hair as her tongue slid against his, and he kept his hands on her hips.
“What?” Dean asked, some frustration slipping into his tone.  “What’s the issue? Your apartment? School? You can come live with me and Sammy.  And—we’ll figure out the rest of it, I don’t know. I can get a third job or something.  We can take out loans. I mean, you got one semester left. How much could it possibly be?”
He steeled himself against that feeling, and snatched the pen out of Naomi’s hand.  He signed and dated the contract. Naomi took it back and glanced it over, like she was checking to make sure he hadn’t signed with a fake name.  Satisfied, she tucked the contract away.
Dean turned, orienting his entire body into Castiel, until he was shoved up against his side.  Dean’s arms wrapped around his middle, and Castiel found himself sitting between Dean’s legs.  His own legs were bent over Dean’s left knee.  It was such an abrupt change, Castiel went rigid.
He shouldn’t have let Jody pull him away.  He should have gone after Cas. He didn’t know why everything seemed so urgent, and maybe he was overreacting, but it felt like that was the last time he’d ever see Cas if he didn’t move fast.
Castiel looked at him sharply.  "Then, perhaps you should plan it, brother, if you think you have better ideas."
He’d bought it on his break in between class and work, and he’d skipped out of the garage about a half hour early to set it up before Cas got home.
All he knew presently was this: Michael had found him amongst the crowd, and he was currently charming Meg with some chat about his college days.  His date was hanging off his arm, smiling at him with twinkling eyes, like he hung the moon. And Castiel was clenching his fist, too enraged to hear anything that was being said, trying too hard to keep himself under control.  Too busy attempting to convince himself that anything in his life was real.
"I was just . . ." He didn't have an excuse.  "I have to go."  Keeping his eyes down, he strode past Sam, who quickly flattened his back against the wall to let Castiel through.  He had every intention of continuing on, to not stop for anything.
Sam reached back into the trunk, something inside rustling. He pulled out a large, curling piece of parchment. “It’s a map of Amherst from the 1850s!”
That hope carried him to well after sundown. He and Sam had already gone into town to buy the train tickets. There was a 1 AM train to New York. That would give him plenty of time to get Cas at midnight and get to the station. From New York, they could go anywhere. Sam had asked about the train schedules while they were at the depot, and he was working on coming up with the best, most erratic route to throw anyone looking for them off their scent.
“Probably cold,” Dean grunted. It was the first thing he’d said all day. He lifted his mug to his lips to test his theory, and grimaced when he was proven right.
Dean didn't have to rummage around the cabinets.  He knew precisely where the k-cups were located.  He knew where the mugs were.  He knew how to work the machine.  Soon, the burning sweet smell of boiling coffee filled the air.
Dean sucked in a breath as if preparing himself, and then he sealed their lips together. And it felt like their first kiss all over again. Something ratcheted up in Castiel’s chest, feeling far too big for his body to contain. He kept his eyes half-open, watching Dean at the proximity as they kissed. He could barely pick out the freckles on Dean’s skin in the darkness, but he could see the way Dean’s brow was lined in concentration, the half-moons of his lashes fluttering against his cheeks.
Castiel would be able to ask his friends to help.  Thank God. Balthazar would probably jump at the opportunity to be paid, and he wasn’t so certain Meg would be too excited about helping, but he might be able to persuade her.
When he swung into the kitchen, it was mostly dark but for the one flickering candle on the butcher block in the center of the room. Benny stood on one side of the block, arms folded, eyes studious. He was watching Jo, sitting across from him, bite into something that looked like a cupcake.
Dean picked up the empty bottle next to his bed.  There was still a shallow film of amber liquid in one of the corners.  Maybe he could get that out somehow.
. (And that other time it was on TV and he just watched it again because he had nothing better to do, okay.)
“Yes,” Balthazar agreed easily, a flourish of one hand showing off the red plastic cup in his other. “Question is: why aren’t you, love? Allow me to correct that.” He stood up and walked across the room to join Meg at the nightstand.
“All right,” Sam said, heaving a little as he took on Jack’s weight.  He was getting too big and very soon they wouldn’t be able to lift him, Castiel realized with a certain pang of sadness.  But it was the kind of sadness that meant good things were to come.
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, stifling his frustration. They were both just anxious. Dean himself had a constant buzz beneath his skin that practically itched if he stood still for too long. But there was nothing left to do for now. They just needed to grab a few hours’ worth of sleep before their journey began in earnest.
Dean inhaled, his face instantly going pale and expressionless.  Castiel felt the color drain from his own cheeks.
While Dean had to move around the country?  Steal and lie and cheat and do awful, stupid, terrible things to put food on the table?  To live without his parents?  To raise his little brother?  To not be able to go to school and have a normal life?  A normal childhood?  Why should Dean have all this crap shoved on him his whole life?  Why did Alastair deserve to keep his life?
Quickly composing himself for whatever was to come, Dean walked to the other side of the balcony, where the trellis was fixed against the wall. Its wooden planks were bare of roses and thorns, and Dean was grateful for small mercies.
Bobby didn't say anything.  He just eyed Dean for another moment before he patted the truck's door and got back inside.  The engine revved as he drove its massive girth around the building, towards the scrap yard.  Dean watched Cas' truck jerk along behind it, the falling snow sliding down the flatbed and piling up against the inside hatch.
She and Jack were on the couch again. Jack was once more asleep, but Claire seemed to be wrapped up in her own thoughts. Sometimes, Cas caught her smiling.
As they drove through town, Castiel squinted at the masses of people going about their day. There were men and women in embroidered suits and satiny, flowing dresses. Children in pointed hats scampered around, their hands full of caramel apples and chocolate. One family with a young daughter was coming out of the familiar’s shop, the girl nuzzling her cheek against her new black kitten. Small jack-o-lanterns were in every window and, in the grassy square just outside the town hall, a giant version sat proudly.
Dean sighed. The smoke was still caught in his throat. He decided it was better not to argue. He flapped up his hands and let them fall back to his lap, gesturing for her to keep going. When she was done, she turned around quickly, her long, braided ponytail arcing around her.
Meg picked up the platter, and nodded towards the stack of dinner plates she’d piled up on the counter. “Wanna do me a favor and take those?”
From the other corner of the room, Sam was leaning around the beam and shooting.  Two men fell, bodies still, and another let out a yelp as his knees buckled beneath him with a spray of blood before Dean’s gun clicked emptily.
He made for the tree line, wondering if it would be better to leave the flowers in Cas’ garden and avoid the cemetery altogether. But he guessed that would be cowardly of him. Besides, he didn’t want to go to the garden, anyway, and see it cold with untouched snow. It was more of a grave than anything else on the grounds could ever be.
Dean moved his fist up the shaft and twisted at the head before sliding back down the other side.  He pumped Cas hard, his other hand still digging into Cas’ ass.
Dean shook his head gently, and blinked for the first time in what Castiel realized must have been a full minute.  “Yeah, I—it’s nothing,” he said, answering a question Castiel hadn’t even asked. “I just . . .” He turned away from the case to face Castiel, distractedly bringing his hand up to his mouth and tugging on his bottom lip.
“Hey, babe, check this out,” Dean said when something caught his eye. He tugged Castiel along to the other side of the fountain and released his hand to crouch down next to one of the dirt patches. Little green ferns feathered that section of the garden, their plump red berries in full bloom. Dean let his hand brush through the plant.
The shirt hung loosely from his body and for the first time in a long time Castiel felt somewhat safe and at home. It was a similar feeling to what being with Dean had felt like and Castiel sobbed in frustration at the thought. The next few minutes were a blur. Frustrated, angry and despaired Castiel punched the wall repeatedly, finally relieving some of the pain, replacing it with physical pain as the final, hard blow to the wall was accompanied by an ugly cracking noise coming right from the centre of his hand.
“What do you mean, my brother is awake? What the hell is going on?” Dean looked at Castiel who just stared back at him blankly. “Castiel? What the hell is going on.” Dean tried his best not to get annoyed with the other man as Castiel just blinked and stepped back a bit.
“No. Cas, I… He…” Dean turned his head to look at Castiel, and Cas could see it in his eyes. The pain and the fear was prominent in his gaze, even as Dean struggled to put it into words.
Behind Castiel, Dean suddenly jerked awake, coughing violently and still clutching his hand to his chest. Castiel spun around, relief flooding through him, overwhelming him. The tears that had stung in his eyes before finally spilled over as he pulled Dean close, holding him protectively as Dean tried to regain his breath. “Breathe. You're fine. You're alive.” Castiel didn't know whether he was trying to soothe Dean or himself. He had been certain that he had lost Dean. Cain's touch gave heart attacks, killed immediately. That's what had happened and yet here Dean was, alive and breathing, slowly calming down as he clutched Castiel close.
“Hey.” Dean protested as Castiel left him entirely exposed and quickly placed a pillow in his lap before Castiel could open the door. Without waiting for an invitation Gabriel stormed into the room. “You two need to get dressed, right now. Your brother beat up my girl.” Gabriel said, pointing an accusing finger at Dean.
It started out as a lump in his chest that seemed to grow each second, making it progressively harder to breathe. His left arm seemed to start cramping and he pressed his right hand to his chest, struggling to breathe. He stared at Cain, wondering what he had done to deserve this. His vision blurred and he got dizzy, falling to his knees as Castiel was too shocked to react.
“Fine, Clarence. But only because I love you and I like seeing you happy.” She said with a fake annoyance that was only contradicted by the soft smile she gave. It wasn't until she turned to walk back into Sam's room that it dawned on Dean what she had just agreed to.
“Whatever. This isn’t even what I wanted to talk to you about.” He said, and Sam nodded, letting himself fall into the pillows on his couch, looking at Dean. “Okay. Shoot.” He said expectantly when Dean didn’t start talking right away.
“Awesome. What time is it now?” Dean asked, having lost all sense of time since his little trip here. For all he knew, it could be 10 in the morning.
“A little water would be nice. A bath, maybe.” Dean says and hesitantly sits up, revelling in how happy this simple movement makes him. The last time he was able to sit up this easily seems ages ago. Almost immediately, Cas is up to get him a glass of water, somehow managing to go into the kitchen without really taking his eye off Dean. “Don't worry, angel. I'm okay.” Dean says as he gets up, muscles still weakened and exhausted. With his healing abilities he would have thought his muscles would take less time to recover. Then again, he has just repeatedly come back from the dead, maybe he should slow it down a bit.
“Vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, Dean.” Castiel said and Dean sighed deeply. “Not you too. I already hear enough of that crap from Sam. And look.” Dean said, taking his hamburger apart and pulling out the slice of tomato. “Vegetables.” He said triumphantly and placed the slice on his plate before licking the sauce off his fingers.
“Dean Winchester, of course. Castiel has told me all about you. And he didn't exaggerate, you really are handsome. Such pretty eyes.” She said dreamily and winked at Dean who threw Cas a glance, unsure which one of them was blushing more. Of course Charlie noticed and smiled brightly. “This is so exciting. You’ll have to tell me all about you, Dean. You're making Castiel very happy.” She announced as she hooked her arm under Dean's and practically dragged Dean out of the cafeteria. Castiel stayed behind, watching as Dean turned to look at him, seemingly helpless as Charlie questioned him. His face was burning with embarrassment and he looked around, searching for a rock to crawl under. Sadly enough, the cafeteria did not have any rocks to offer and Castiel sighed deeply before following the two of them. If Charlie was going to talk to Dean he would have to make sure she did not reveal all of the cheesy things he had told her about Dean. Their relationship wasn't evolved enough for that.
It wouldn’t be the first time they showered together.  They did it most mornings that Castiel stayed over the Winchesters’, to conserve water and save on the heating bill.  However, that didn’t always go to plan, and they sometimes ended up wasting water and electricity.
Dean didn’t want to be let off the hook. Not yet, anyway. Before Cas could follow that up, he kept on, “I’m the one who did this to us.” They knew that now. This was all his fault. So, if anyone was dying here, it better be him. He didn’t want to cause Cas anymore pain.
When they reached the avenue, cars were zipping past at speeds probably too dangerous for a busy city street.  The whoosh of tires on the tar served as constant background noise. Dean turned towards Cas, who breathed out with a sigh of finality.  Briefly, Dean wondered how he could keep this night going, but that was a bad idea. Cas didn’t want that, anyway.
Mary caught him looking at the photograph. She laughed lightly again. “Lawrence town fair. He won the junior’s competition for growing the largest pumpkin that year. Grew it right in the backyard.” She shook her head at the memory. “He always did have a green thumb. No idea where he got that from!” She turned and continued up the stairs.
He glanced behind the realtor at the house. One story was set high up on stilts over the long grass of the swampland. Through the wooden legs, Dean could see a small backyard leading to an old wooden dock with an ancient airboat tied up to it. The water sat stagnant, lethargic, as reeds shivered whenever something unseen under the surface brushed against them. The mangrove trees on either side closed in on each other, creating a tunnel that blocked out the light. Dense foliage compacted the house on the sides, and there was nothing across the unlined street except for more trees and shallow wetlands.
Dean didn’t want the night to be over.  He wanted to stay wrapped up in this warm little bubble where none of the bad stuff could get in.  But, despite that wish, they started to seep in anyway, along with all the reasons as to why Cas
Sam swallowed the blood in one go, knocking it back. He tossed the cup to the side, letting it smash against the wall.
“Okay. I’m almost done here.” A pile of folded clothes in his hands, he went back to the open drawer of the dresser.
He sat back, and tossed his pen into the margins of the book he was reading. “Okay, break time. What d’you say we get some dinner?”
Jody and Donna must have heard his footsteps thundering against the floor, because they both looked up.  Dean didn’t know what kind of expression he was wearing, and he hoped it looked as uncompromising as it felt, but Jody’s eyes immediately widened.
“Everything will fall into place,” Zachariah concluded, and if he thought he’d still have his job once Castiel inherited the manor, he was mistaken.
He walked toward the voice, following it wherever it beckoned.  Behind his eyes, all he could see was blue.
“Don’t sell yourself short,” Cas said, and there was a hint of a sly smile in his tone.  “I bet there are lots of things you’re good at.”
“It’s a town upstate.  Our parents used to take us there sometimes.”  He wondered if Sam would mind including someone else into their little secret language—but it was
Dean’s eyes swept up to meet his, and there was a proud twinkle in them, like he was comfortable enough to look away from his feet. Castiel searched his face. The wave of nausea broke against the shore, and he felt pleasantly weightless again. Flying. Or falling. It wouldn’t last long, he knew. He wondered if Dean might catch him.
Dean couldn’t believe he’d let himself fall for Cas’ act.  For a second, he’d forgotten who he was speaking to.
Dean forgot all about what happened earlier.  Whatever wound it had torn open in him patched itself up.
Dean swallowed and cast his eyes upward. “Cas, you know I’m not trying to smother you, right? I’m just…”
He let his hand fall back down to his lap. He sat in the armchair next to the window of his bedroom, and he could still see the lantern flickering in Dean’s apartment from the vantage point. Not that he was looking. He was simply… wondering when Dean would arrive. They hadn’t set a time. Perhaps he should have been more specific. He’d just assumed Dean would arrive after the rest of the house had gone to sleep.
Dean’s name filled the space in a mantra, until Castiel said it more urgently in warning.  He could feel his muscles starting to tense, pressure building up slowly within him that was just about ready to burst.  And all he could think about was Dean—Dean was doing this to him. Dean’s mouth was on him, his lips stretched around him and his cheeks hollowing and he was so beautiful.
When he spoke, Ruby couldn’t see his mouth moving in the darkness.  It seemed as if the flames were addressing her.  “Sit, child.”
“He picked it out all himself,” Cas assured him, watching with a faint smile. He pretended to be exasperated by it, even when they were young together, but truthfully he found Dean’s preoccupation with all things Western adorable. Jack migrated toward the cultural phenomenon even without Dean’s input. As young as five, he would be transfixed in front of some Western movie from the thirties.
When it started up again, it moved too quickly. Shame and panic sprouted like a wildfire in his stomach. They spread up his chest, clogged his throat, rose up like bile.
Cas didn’t look away in any kind of shame for having been caught watching Dean sleep.  His ear was still against his pillow, and he was lying on his side, and his long lashes swept down slowly as he blinked.  Dean wondered how long he’d been doing that. It was a little creepy, but Dean was too busy trying not to be mortified to care about that.
But then he remembered that it was still night, and they were stuck there until sunrise. “Oh, shit,” he breathed. “Uh... We might have to hold off on the whole
Dean put down his coffee on the floor next to his bed and laid back down again, staring straight up.  He really wished Cas’ head were on his chest right about now.
Dean hid his blush by turning to the door to the bedroom.  In the next room, he caught sight of a small sliver of the window.  The sky was still dark, but the faintest touch of the sun’s first light was bleeding into the horizon.  Distantly, he could hear early birds chirping.  It was nearly day.
He opened his eyes, gaze falling on Bobby, trying to gauge his thoughts. “What about you? You think there’s a way?”
Which led him to his next point: “Look, whatever.  We didn’t sign your contract or something. I get that.  My bad. But you’re really gonna fire us over it?” He really didn’t care if they sacked him, but Cas—Cas liked it there!
Outside the box, he heard something like nails dragging along the lid. Dean’s muffled, broken voice came through. “I’m sorry, Cas. Fuck—I’m—Cas.”
Shit.  Dean didn’t want to picture it.  People packed inside the back of one of those carriers.  Some of them bleeding out. Some of them dead. Scared.
It was enough for some of the ire to course through Castiel’s bloodstream again. He needed to leave. Because of Sam? Because he was ashamed?
“Yeah. Said no other mechanic’s ever been able to figure out why the engine’d been clicking like that. Said you managed to fix it. Even offered to pay extra because of it.”
It was Dean’s second week on the job. So far, he was liking it. Sure, Zach could be a little overbearing, but he mostly left Dean alone. Everyone else was great. Garth, who took care of the dogs and horses, took some getting used to, but that was only because he was so damn friendly. It was actually a little endearing, but Dean wouldn’t admit that out loud.
“What’s going on between you two,” she said. Cas stood frozen, unsure whether or not this was about to turn into a marriage counseling session. He sincerely hoped not. And the Baneses weren’t helping very much by ducking their heads to hide their amusement. “So unless you both want to drop the charade, act like adults, and tell each other how you really still feel about one another, I suggest you leave my kitchen, Castiel.”
But, honestly?  Dean wasn’t sure it was the trip causing it.  He thought it was more about Cas going with him.  All his life, he’d pictured doing this alone. He pictured turning towards the shotgun seat and finding it empty, and he never realized that
Sam knitted his brows together, not understanding.  There were tears in her eyes.  “Hey, hey.  What is it?” he coaxed, turning fully toward her now.
Deciding whatever he’d managed would have to be good enough, he slowly tipped back down onto heels, his arms shooting out for balance while the mattress shifted again. He exhaled, relieved that he hadn’t fallen over.
“Raphael,” Castiel said, a rock forming in his throat.  He tried to look calm, as if he were meant to be there. He wasn’t certain how he was going to finish his sentence when he said, “I was just—.”
Dean nodded, half a moment more passing before he stepped away.  On his way to the rectangle of sunlight pooling in from outside the barn doors, Dean put his fingers into his mouth and whistled.  The horses stood to attention, ready to be led out to the pen to join the others.
Cas stood in the doorway like he wasn’t sure what to do next.  His hands were fisted at his sides. Dean glanced around. There were a few people in the stools at the bar, chatting in groups of twos and threes.  The bartender moved from customer to customer. A few more familiar faces were seated at the tables, eating and drinking, while others were around the pool table.  At the back of the room, there were two tables pushed together, three men occupying the chairs while three other seats remained empty.
But he didn't want to move.  He wanted to stay with Dean until he knew Dean was safe and awake and fine.  He wanted to be there to hold Dean's hand and tell him that everything would be okay, as if he could make such promises.  He wanted to be there when Dean woke up, so Castiel could see his eyes and kiss his smile.
Something that felt as cold as steel ran down his spine.  He pulled his shoulders straighter.  “Meg.”  Part of him wanted to deny it, to say,
His eyes flickered down to the cracked, tan dirt.  He wasn't aware that conversation was necessary.  They hadn't had it yet.  In fact, they hadn't spoken about anything remotely in the vicinity of their kiss since Dean left.  Castiel had wanted to bring it up, but he didn't know how.  He'd assumed Dean would take the lead.
Besides that, Dean literally just couldn’t tell him. Because it would only lead to questions that he couldn’t answer.
He paced toward her slowly, careful not to spook her upon his approach to the other side of the body.  “Excuse me, ma’am?” he asked softly, slipping his hat off his head again in respect.
The two kept arguing as Dean went to the coat rack and grabbed his jacket, and he had a secret bet with himself that neither of those losers would end up making a move before the night was over.  “Hey, Dean, you headed out?” Max called, and Dean’s stomach soured. He really hoped Max wasn’t trying to accompany him. But then he realized they were in different hotels, anyway, so he was probably panicking for nothing.
Castiel nodded, even though he wasn’t exactly sure what Dean was getting at. Was he upset at being back? “Well… With any luck, we’ll locate Chuck soon and then we can go back home.”
Dean was sitting in the ratty old wheelie chair behind the desk in the office of Bobby's garage.  He was leaning back as far as the chair would allow, which wasn’t very far since the back of it jammed up forever ago, and his feet were crossed and resting on the bottom drawer of the desk he'd toed open with his boot.  It was his lunch break, and his sad, soggy ham and Cheetos sandwich that he'd brought from home was sitting atop an off-brand Ziplock baggie on the scratched, smudged glass that covered the dozens of local business cards Bobby had on display on the desk.
The voice was like rolling thunder against loose gravel. Dean wondered if he wanted to spend all day in bed, after all.
She didn’t seem all that convinced.  “Well,” she mused, “if I hadn’t, I would have never met you.”  She bit her lip in consideration.  “Maybe that’s one good thing to come out of this whole mess.”  Her voice went up at the end, like she was asking him.
Castiel shook out his hand again, hearing the joints in his wrist crack under the movement, and blinked so that the text would stop swimming hazily.
Dean didn’t notice. “Look, it’s alright. Whatever happened, we can—” He reached out to lay his hand on Castiel’s shoulder.
Cas did nothing for half a second too long, and then he wordlessly picked himself up to his knees, their chests sliding together in the motion, and shuffled backwards on the bed. Dean bent his knees and kicked them over the side. “Be right back,” he said, and walked to the door. He glanced over his shoulder, seeing Cas sit back on his heels, before opening the door fully and heading for the bathroom.
More glass shattered, but it wasn’t any of the windows.  Something had landed on the stage’s roof.  The next thing Sam knew, he was on his back, coughing the air back into his lungs.  There’s been a loud boom.  He smelled smoke.  The horses were whinnying and bucking frantically in their harnesses.
Dean ignored him and gestured for the bartender for a whiskey. The man came over with a bottle and glass that Dean knew would probably just be for pretense. He’d chug the whiskey straight from the jar if Sam weren’t around. “I’ll take the bottle,” he said, tossing down more than enough money on the counter.
Anael must have seen Michael’s glare because, as soon as he was looking away, she leaned forward, caught Castiel’s eye, and gave him an exaggerated and sarcastic thumbs up. The movement caused the lace bell-sleeve of her dress to move down her arm. Castiel tried not to scowl at her, and it wouldn’t have done much good, anyway. She snapped back in position almost as quickly as she’d come.
“No,” Henriksen said again.  The keys clunked and rattled between his hands as he located the one for the cell door.  When he stuck it into the lock, he said, “But by tomorrow, I’ll either have these two or Nicholas Pike in chains.  I’m bringing in an outlaw either way.  But I figure there’s only one way I can rescue an infant, too.  I call that a good day.”  The metal whined as he turned the key and the deadbolt disengaged.  “So, what the hell?”
“I think you’re gonna care,” Dean threatened, twiddling the knife in his hands. He had yet to use it, however, and it had been hours. The djinn was probably beginning to catch on. Castiel, from his place near the window, sighed. Dean was a skilled torturer. True, he didn’t enjoy it, but sometimes it was necessary.
“I’m just trying to correct my family’s mistakes,” Cas said, apparently moving past their current argument and finishing the one they were having before.  “And I’m trying to ensure the people of this town are safe. That
Chuck withered slightly, breathing out. His voice was kinder but still firm when he said, “Look, Castiel. I know you’re eager, but you should only focus on one thing right now, and that’s finding a wife.”
“Castiel, darling, might I have a private word?”  Balthazar turned to start walking, already expecting Castiel to follow him.
Cas cocked his head to the side and raised a skeptical brow.  Dean rolled his eyes and looked away.  "Don't gimme the look."  He just didn't have the faith in Meg that Cas, for whatever reason, did.
Dean grabbed him by the wrist and led him up to their room. They fell into bed together, and dissolved into heady kisses. Their bodies moved into one another, pushing and pulling.
"It doesn't say, but I think it's for Evangelist," Sam said.  "There are tons of these, ranging from the 90s to 2012.  That was the same year Lucifer went to jail, right?"
He didn't leave any room for debate, as he left the room quickly afterwards.  Castiel sighed, not wanting to move.  His limbs were heavy and his thoughts sluggish.  After a few more seconds of lying there, he hauled himself up into a sitting position and searched the tangled blankets that had been kicked to the end of the bed for his boxers.  He grumbled as he slipped them on, and instantly felt like he needed a shower.  They hung limply off his hips as he walked down the hall, yawning the whole way.
“Bye,” Dean said, letting his hand slip from Cas at the last possible second while he walked away. He watched his husband shrug into his coat, and then Cas left through the front door.
He thought about when he was a little kid, half-asleep in his bed in the dead of night. With his eyes skewed tight and the hairs on the back of his neck standing on edge as some imaginary boogeyman hovered behind him. With the thought that, if he ignored it, pretended he was asleep, it would go away. With another thought telling him to open his eyes, to face the danger despite the cold fear sitting like lead in his gut. He’d opened his eyes every time, and every time all he found was empty darkness, no threat at all.
“Uh-huh. Whatever.” She turned around and started rinsing the glasses out. “Just get out of here. Tell Dean I said happy birthday.” He knew she wasn’t being sincere.
The song switched into something a little slower, with a beat building beneath the lyrics.  Dean leaned away, a grin cracking his slick lips. “Wanna dance?” he said, and Castiel nodded.  He still really didn’t know how to dance, but most people just swung their hips and grinded against each other.  It wasn’t very complicated, even if he did feel silly doing it and he had no clue what to do with his hands most of the time.  But he wouldn’t object to Dean’s body moving against his.
The last time he’d gone, the bench was a mound beneath the piles of snow and the stream trickled under a top layer of ice. He assumed he wouldn’t know if there was any damage until the snows melted.
Again, Cas pulled a face like he didn’t quite understand.  “Jack was fussing.  I didn’t want him to wake you, so I took him down here to calm him,” he answered steadily.
“Heya, Cas,” Dean said back and when he smiled it was that same terrible smile that he always brought with him across the divide, the one that stopped at his jawline and made Cas forget to inhale. Not that he could blame Dean, not at all. It just… hurt. All of them hurt from it.
After a while, their kisses became less hurried, less feverish.  They were languid and drowsy and Dean felt his breath tripping with the tenderness of it all.  His cheeks were scratched red by Cas’ stubble and his lips were swollen and wet, and it was the best damn make out session he’d ever had.
Castiel had mostly tuned out. He hadn’t meant to, but he suddenly felt as if his ears were clogged with cotton. His throat went dry. A few hours ago, he’d been thinking of finding a job, but it hadn’t fully dawned on him that, no matter how independent he tried to become, he was still technically dead and had been for a very long time. He didn’t know if it would ever truly be possible to exist in this new world. He would always be dependent on another. He wasn’t certain he could live that way for long. Even if he could, he wondered if Dean would become sick of him after a while and leave.
Cas tilted his head to the side, regarding Dean like he was an idiot—and, hell, maybe he was right.  "The spring semester ended, if you recall.  My summer courses don't start up for a week.  I did mention that to you previously."
He tore out of bed, ignoring Cas calling his name. His door slammed against the wall when he left his room, but he went right to Sam’s door and started banging. “Sam? Sammy!” There was a light on inside, peeking out through the cracks under the door, so Sam was definitely awake.
She nodded, again saying, “Thanks. And, um… He’s already had his breakfast. He eats lunch around one o’clock, and he gets pretty cranky after that, but it usually only lasts about ten minutes before he passes out for a nap. What else? Um… No allergies. And, oh! Don’t let him have anything nougat! He’ll try to con you into giving him a candy bar, but don’t listen. Once you give him one, you’ll never hear the end of it until he’s eaten six.”
He could feel her eyes on him. She turned her head, allowing him to guide her along the path. “Does it ever get… boring?” she asked.
Castiel opened his mouth to protest, but his argument withered in his chest.  He realized Lucifer was right.  He'd always seen himself as a kind of shepherd to the people of the town.  His father, Michael—they'd told him that he was a leader, an example, for the community.  So much of what he believed had been shaped by that notion.  It was why he volunteered at the orphanage, why he got straight A's in a subject he hated, why he'd broken it off with Dean.  Because that was the way of the world according to the Novaks.  It was the world according to him.
“Amelia changed her last name when she moved up to Lebanon. Her and Claire both have the last name Novak. I assume she did that for you.”
“Nah, you’ve got yourself a pretty good dad already.” He reassures her, running his hand through her hair.
Jack presented his toy proudly.  The wooden figure resembled a man, but it wasn’t very anatomically proportional.  The limbs were much too long to depict a normal-sized man.  Sam’s brows pinched as he looked at the doll, but then something seemed to dawn on his face.
Dean stomach lurched, partly in confusion and partly in worry. “Cas? Why, what—?” He suddenly wanted to throw up. What had happened after he left? Did Chuck pick a match for Cas? Was Cas engaged?
Dean stared ahead at the picture, pursing his lips a little in thought.  He really didn’t want things to be awkward with Cas after they kissed, but they kind of already were.  He leaned back on the couch, and tried to focus on the movie.
“Dean.”  The abrupt change in his tone made Dean go cold.  He reverted back into a kid cowering under his covers from the monster in the closet.  And, like that kid peeking his head out, hoping beyond hope he was safe and the closet was still empty, he looked.
Dean may come through into a diner every year, but he and Claire usually only spared enough time to catch up with Benny before heading out. They only had so long to spend together, after all. Breakfast for four, two of those being Dean and Claire, meant a large breakfast and a greasy breakfast.
“Dean, I—,” he started, and stopped.  What could he say to make this right? What could he say to keep Dean from kicking him out?  He ruined everything.
Dean shrugged. “Okay,” he said. There was a pause, and Zach kept looking at him expectantly. Dean realized, “What, right now?”
Dean pinched his lips, but he wasn’t exactly able to argue. He guessed he hadn’t gotten the genius gene that seemed to run in his family, which was a shame because it probably would have come in handy right about now.
“Yes,” Cas said.  He put the locket down and brought up the picture frame.  Delicately, he held it between both hands, staring somberly down at the photograph before turning it around for Dean to see.  Kelly, a little younger than Dean had ever known her, was staring off to the side of the frame.  The exposure of the photograph blew out some of the lines of her face, and the sepia tone made her hair seem darker than Dean thought it actually was.  But it was a good picture.
She blinked up at him, not really knowing how to feel.  It was an honor, and to hear those words was bliss.  She’d won his trust and his favor.  But motherhood?  She wasn’t Lilith.  She’d fail.  She was better at fighting.
Castiel felt himself start to panic.  There was a sharp feeling in his chest.  He shouldn’t have said anything.  Maybe Dean didn’t feel the same way he did about wanting to keep Jack in their lives.  Maybe Dean didn’t feel the same way about
There was a ghost inhabiting his body, ever-present right beneath the skin. It walked when he walked; talked when he talked. It had the same thoughts, the same wants. And he wondered if its name was Dean Wesson, after all. Maybe he was the ghost.
“Well, he does,” Dean assured him.  “And I don’t wanna fuck this up before it actually gets started, so . . . No picking up hotties in bars for me.”
Cas was already shaking his head, jaw jutting out in an angry pout, halfway through Dean’s words. “You don’t believe that.”
He wasn’t sure where else he’d be. “I’m here. Hello.” He opened up the screen door, looking down at Jack, who was bundled in an orange corduroy coat. A small backpack with a colorful design of the fish movie he and Castiel had watched hung at his side. “Hello, Jack.”
