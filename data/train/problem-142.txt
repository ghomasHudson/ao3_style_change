Instinctively, Sherlock clanged around his neck, and John carried him to the couch where they fell together quite clumsily. Sherlock was laughing loudly now, John was chuckling.
The doctor, after he had come in Sherlock's mouth, had cuddled him and praised him. They had passed the rest of the afternoon peacefully, the sub had been nuzzling and napping frequently on John's lap, searching constantly for his comfort as if his mind had not still totally surrendered at the idea it was time to come back to reality.
The doctor let his hair go with an exhausted sigh, a new wave of stinging pain hit the detective's scalp as he did.
Sherlock frowned, “What do you mean, sir?” he asked, “Your training, Sherlock,” the doctor said, as that was enough of an explanation.
John had going increasing force and rhythm, not letting his palm just fell flat of Sherlock's backside but keeping his finger together and let the strikes run on the cheeks' curve. He had always liked this kind of punishment, a bit old fashioned maybe, and it was definitely less of an impact than any implement would be, but it allowed to keep it going on for a long time without making any serious damage, allowing the sub to gradually melt beneath it.
Again Mycroft quite patronizing smile irritated him, “See, Doctor,” the sub explained, “you are the first dominant who proved to be able to stay with my brother for more than a few minutes and, I assume from the state of your hand, you even managed to punish him” he added, the satisfaction on his face was way too obvious.
“Sherlock,” John warned him but the detective shook his head interrupting him, “Please,” he said, his voice was cracking.
Sherlock was starting to fall in that blessed state, the pain on his backside was turning in mellow warmth, the tears felt like liberation. As he curled up against John's chest, hugged by the Dom's scent, hearing the doctor's calm breath and heart, he felt so little, so loved and taken care of, safe.
Sherlock looked at the little tube in his hand, a single pill was inside it.
A shiver had run through his spine as the sub reminded the severe whipping he had received, the bites of the birching were still smarting on his entire back, from his shoulders down to his thighs. It had been the first time his skin had been broken, even if only slightly.
The sub increased pace slowly, feeling the veins of the Dom's cock pulsing in his mouth, around his lips. John's wet fingers were tightening around his curls as he went on, possessively preventing him to back away.
Sherlock hadn't seen Victor since middle school before their paths had been separated. He still remembered that kiss Victor had given him, the spinning of his head and the sensation of floating he had felt. They never had a romantic story really, but the shocking gaze of Mycroft from the other side of the schoolyard had been delightful. Surprising the older Holmes was a rather remarkable talent that Victor had, and the scandalized yell of the prefect had made the young ginger boy laugh. He had always had a taste for scandals.
“I thought you might fancy some real breakfast,” the woman said, “Sherlock always forget to do his groceries” she added with a playful scold.
“I wanted to do this as soon as I saw this tub” the doctor said smiling as he knelt in front of the tub, rubbing tenderly Sherlock's body with the sponge, not minding that his sleeves, despite being folded to half his arms, were getting wet as he soaked the sponge again so that it wouldn't get cold. It was a shame, he thought, that the tub wasn't big enough for both of them, but he still enjoyed bathing his boy, it was soothing aftercare.
Sherlock looked at him, his eyes narrowed “I don't need it, I am able to control myself” he said, “no matter as much influence you think you have on me”, he added with a cold smile, mocking the Dom's words. For a moment, John fell silent, Sherlock looked at him gloatingly at seeing the effect his remark had on the Dom, “It wasn't a suggestion, boy”.
“Give me your belt, Sherlock” John commanded him. He had put a chair in the middle of the room and he was now waiting for Sherlock to obey.
“Sherlock?” John's voice echoed in the library, the building collapsed.
As John managed to pull Sherlock away, with all the intention to drag him forcibly back in line if necessary, looking worried at the numerous guards who were now watching them, she finally picked up the phone.
As the Doctor lowered his own trousers, he saw the sub looking at him with shining eyes, he smiled at him “Peeking, boy?” he said with a playful stern, Sherlock smiled timidly returning to face the sheets.
The silence fell again in the room heavy.
“My number is on the internet, he has a phone for personal use and a work one, I needed an unknown number” Sherlock explained plainly, “Also he was been annoying, I pickpocket him when he is annoying” he added.
He had crawled with wobbling arms and shaking knees, he had been scared at the idea the plug would go out as he moved but it just didn't.
“Then, why are you here, if you don't want my advice, John?” She asked, taking a sip of wine, observing the Doctor uneasily. Her lipstick red lips were smiling amusedly.
John opened the office door, “Out” he said to Sherlock. The sub stood up, he gave Greg a last glare of resentment, before walking out the door, avoiding John's eyes.
“You will address me as 'Sir'” he declared with a plain tone, “If you turn out to have specific kinks, we might change it, but I expect you to use it, especially if you have to ask me something or you are being punished” he continued.
“Up, back on your knees again, Sherlock,” John said, “I will deal with you later if you manage to act civil” he added darkly.
He liked blindfolds, really, it had been an acquired taste, he had needed time to let his Dom take away his sight, but now it just meant he didn't have to worry to predict what would happen next, he just had to flavor the sensations as they came, unexpectedly. He closed his eyes behind the blindfold, inhaling the smell of the fabric that was so familiar to him.
“Undress,” John commanded, he was fiddling with the crop in his hands, not even looking at Sherlock as he obeyed.
Without further warning, a sharp hand fell on him, the sound of the flesh was barely muffled by his thin trousers, it resonated on the flat. Sherlock let a humph out from the surprise. The pain was barely there, warm and quickly fading.
John corrected him a few more times: every time Sherlock dropped something with annoyance or disorganized manner, the Dom would tut, and, grabbing the sub's ear, he would give him another sweet taste of the paddle, turning his ass of a delightfully pink.
Part of Sherlock's brain was still refusing to accept the blame for how the events had turned out, yet he swallowed before saying, maybe with too much force “I'm sorry, Sir”.
“It’s okay, Liam.” Thomas reached up, gently rubbing Liam’s muzzle. “I’m fine. I know you can’t pull out yet. Do you want to me to disentangle us? We can stay like this if you need to, but I think I can do it without hurting you.”
“Yeah, thanks. And Uncle Greg… I love you.”
if you ever cheated on him, but I can guarantee it wouldn’t be good.”
“I know that all too well. To be honest, I think I’m just panicking a bit at the thought of sharing you with anyone, and how you’re going to handle this. I know how you feel about someone other than me touching you. Aren’t you afraid?”
it is you’re doing, isn’t my field.” John shrugged. “I did get the mirror cut and attached to the bottom of the jar, at least”, he muttered, defending his efforts.
“I’ll make you a deal. You ask, and if I think it’s none of your business, I’ll tell you. I got some things I’d like to ask you too, and I’ll give you the same deal there, okay? If you don’t wanna tell me, you don’t have to.”
“We’ll work somethin’ out. Don’t worry, okay? I’ll take care of everything. You can stay at my place for now, and we’ll see about gettin’ you back in school.”
“He is young and was in his first fight. He was hurt and so his instincts took over. It takes time and acceptance before a werewolf can control his instincts when he is threatened like that. He needed meat to heal so he ate. I don’t understand why he’s so upset about it since they were already dead but humans are strange like that.”
“Just ask”, Greg said softly. He had a good idea what Mycroft was about to ask, and he hoped he was right.
“Thank you. I’m sure I’ll be in contact very soon.”

He heard the tea tray rattle as she sat it down, and his stomach growled. Unable to wait any longer, he dashed to the bathroom. She was still there when he finished, squealing in outrage.

“You don’t have to change it at all. A lotta gay couples don’t, but I’m really hopin’ Mycroft does go with hyphenating. I like the idea of puttin’ my name on him.” Greg grinned.
“And you’ve been drinking more.” Sherlock slunk over, tossing his coat and the cigarette on the coffee table, and sat down beside John.
“Me too. I kinda like the idea of puttin’ my name on you.” He grinned, nibbling on Mycroft’s neck. “It lets people know you’re
Sherlock crawled across the floor, reaching under his chair for a cigarette. The Turkish slipper he kept them in had somehow ended up pushed nearly to the back. He’d finally got his fingers on it when he heard John stirring on the sofa.
“Hell would be a lot emptier if that were true.” Lucifer laughed softly. “Somehow, sex and guilt became intertwined in your soul. I’ve no doubt John’s untangled no small amount of that, but I can help you separate the two. It’s no guarantee, but you’ll let me help, then you can perhaps move past the guilt once it’s sorted out.”

She got it from him…” He pointed to the shorter of the three men. “… and disposed of her own shirt, which was wet from drowning her daughter.” He bent low, studying the faint trace of spots on the dirty linoleum floor. “There are clear signs something wet was carried through here.” He followed the trail into the kitchen, and pulled open the lower cabinets. Behind an assortment of junk and cleaning products was a damp, wadded up shirt. He pointed it out with a triumphant flourish.
“It isn’t. John, I don’t ever want anyone but you, a point I think I’ve been very clear about, but there’s far more to consider here than my own feelings on the matter. He’s by far the most powerful being we’re likely to encounter in this realm or any other. Having the ability to summon him instantly to our aid is an advantage we may not be able to afford to refuse. Can I really be so selfish as to put my own discomfort at the idea above the lives of others?”

“She’ll be alright. She’s just used more magic than her body can handle. If Loki’s willing to help, between the two of us we can probably give her enough magical energy to recover in a few hours.” Lucifer brushed Violet’s hair back with surprising gentleness. “She’ll have to be taught to restrain herself or she’ll end up burning herself out. Magic of that scale is almost unheard of in humans. Her body seems basically human, and you’re not designed to wield that much magic without a physical cost. I know you’re familiar with that, Mycroft.”
“Good morning, brother mine. Do come in.” Mycroft nodded a greeting to John and led them into the kitchen. “How was your trip to L.A.? Was he genuine?”
“We have a deal… temporarily. But we have laws and rules of conduct in this country. I expect you to follow them, and not to cause a disturbance.”
If this was going to continue, it couldn’t be kept secret. There was far too much potential for blackmail for them both if it was kept secret. He wondered how Greg’s co-workers would react. His own colleagues would only be mildly surprised. The press might be a minor annoyance, considering Greg’s position, but only if there was some hint of scandal or secrecy.
“Don’t drop me this time.” John laughed as he draped his arms around Sherlock’s neck, pulling himself up as his lover lifted him. He wrapped his legs around his lover’s waist, locking his ankles together. Sherlock pressed him against the wall, trying to lower him onto his cock. “I don’t think this is going to work…”

“Do you

“Would that be so bad?” Mycroft asked softly. His anxious glance was met with a kiss. Greg wrapped his arm around him, holding him close as he whispered in his ear.

“Still, better safe than sorry.” Mycroft sighed heavily. “You call them. Mummy’s much more likely to listen to you. Have them go visit some friends for a few days. I doubt Eurus will bother tracking them down if they’re not at home.”
“I…” He hesitated unable to express how he felt in words. He understood, in his way, what Sherlock meant. He’d tried to make himself into a thinking machine, but being with him let Sherlock be human for a while. He thought again of the enormous courage this all must have taken him. The idea that this brilliant, damaged, beautiful man would place that much trust in him was humbling. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“When I kissed him, he felt desire. Have you ever asked yourself what I felt?”
“What’d you do, give him a blowjob?”

though, is it?” She’d been lonely since her husband’s suicide, and she thought of Mycroft, coming home to an empty house all those years. She looked at him sympathetically. “It must have been very difficult for you, all these years alone. It’s good you’ve met someone. Is it serious, the two of you?”

“Oh, FUCK! GREG!”, he shouted.
“I have three interviews tomorrow.” John headed upstairs to gather Rosie and her things. He paused on the stairs, listening to the Sherlock and Mary discuss the candidates he’d chosen. A smile slowly spread across his face. He stepped in, shouldering the bag and gathering his daughter in his arms.
, is it?” He looked at Mary, feeling a little vindicated. “It’s almost like choosing a new family member. With all this magic business going on, they’re going to end up spending a lot of time with Rosie, and I want just the right person.”
“Well, then, maybe a massage will help. Let’s get you undressed.” He leaned over, gently kissing Sherlock’s brow as he unbuttoned his shirt.
“I like to sleep on clean sheets”, Mycroft said primly.
… You enjoyed that bit, didn’t you?”
“I can’t let her go around doing that. She’s shortened the life of everyone in London by five minutes. Do you have any idea how much time it’s going to take to straighten all that out? It’s going to cause no end of trouble.”
That’s the worst of it; how my thoughts about him are becoming…

“The fly in the ointment. Yes, I know all that. I also know he loves you, John.”
“It was part of the deal I made. What is your profession?”
“John, I.. do you want… This thing with Lucifer; do you want it?” Sherlock sat on the bed, shirt unbuttoned and trousers still on, with a very uneasy look on his face. “Please, just be honest with me and tell me how

“Yeah, Greg’s great.” She sat in silence, waiting to see if he was going to tell her more. After a few minutes, she finally asked. “Is everything okay, John?”
“They’re so soft…”
“Well, that ruined a perfectly good Vivienne Westwood.” He pushed his finger through the hole in his jacket and laughed. “Running out of options, Sherlock? Now that John’s dead, you could always just kill yourself. Why don’t you jump? It’d be just like old times; you and me, coming full circle. So romantic, don’t you think?”

“And there’s the rest of it.” He groaned softly in frustration as John vanished. “How

He pulled through the open gate and down the long, tree-lined drive to Challenger’s family home, an old stone manor house called “The Briars”. Parking the car, he headed to the door, grateful for the comforting weight of his gun in its shoulder holster. He doubted he’d need it and thought it probable that if it came down to violence, it’d be unlikely he’d be fast enough to draw and fire it, but at least the special rounds Mycroft had designed gave him a fighting chance against the vampire if the need should arise.
“Yes. And Anthea… Well done. Thank you.”

“Aren’t I
“Is it?” He sounded dubious.
“Beings like Oberon or Death may be powerful, but Powers are limited by their Position. Death chose Mary over Greg, because she can’t affect a mortal before his time, while Mary, being a ghost, is within the power of her Position.”

“I dunno. I kinda favor hyphenating, but I’ll be happy to go along with whatever Mycroft wants.”
“Well, it wouldn’t. Not with me, anyway. I love you, and nothing’s ever gonna change that. Do you think it might change how you feel about me?”

been glorious.  Mycroft had done things he’d have found personally unimaginable, and his enthusiasm had overcome his inexperience. He’d been impaled on Greg’s cock, pinned to the bed by Greg’s strength and weight and silenced by Greg’s tongue in his mouth, and he’d never felt freer or more confident in his life.
“Don’t be an arse… Oh! You called me a ghost! Does that mean we’re believing in me today?” She smiled brightly and hopped off the bed. “Now put the kettle on and let’s have that chat, shall we?”
“You can
“As the presence of the Fae in England predates humanity itself, I hardly think they qualify as illegal immigrants. It’s really quite simple, Mycroft. There are far too many Ways between us and the Fae realm to close them all. For now, our best solution is to deal with each hive as it appears and do everything within our power to see it’s treated properly. Believe me, we want fairies living in as many of these Ways as possible. They are, within the rules I have explained, benevolent, and as they can’t stray from their mounds, their impact on human society will be minimal. They are also very territorial, and they’re quite powerful as a group, so we won’t have to worry about something far worse than fairies using the Way.”

“You are a werewolf and you acted as a young one does when the blood-lust comes over him. Your instincts overwhelmed your mind. This is a thing you can learn to control, if you can accept what you are.”

“It is. Mummy, Father… I’d like you to meet Detective Chief Inspector Greg Lestrade. My fiancé.”
“And I enjoyed your enthusiasm. It’s easy to become jaded and forget how exciting something as simple as a helicopter ride can be. Have you ever been in one, Liam?”
“Not since yesterday.” Sherlock’s voice was playfully petulant. “I was worried you might have forgotten.”
“Only certain beings outside of the realm of Faerie can use their Ways. If it was formed when the seal was broken, it could have been trapped between worlds within the Way. Closing the Way would have expelled it back to this world.”
“Guys, get in here! You’re gonna want a look at these monitors.” They rushed into the computer room, staring at the monitors in shock.

“Oil.” John growled, crawling up Sherlock’s body, stopping to nip lightly on one nipple.
are you on about?” John suddenly decided that since Rosie was safely with Mrs. Hudson, being the responsible, adult one could go to hell. He got up and poured himself a drink. “Are you even listening?
“Hi, Bill. Rosie’s finally asleep”, she said, glancing at John. She looked curiously at Bill as John stepped over to pick the box off the pile. Long and thin, it bore the name and logo of a prominent jeweler. The card attached said, simply:
“We can’t let that happen”, Sherlock said softly, his eyes darting towards the gun John was still holding.
me inside you. And when you’re writhing and panting with desire, I’m gonna put it inside that sexy, hot, tight arse of yours and make love to you until you’re shaking with pleasure. Then I’m gonna fill that sweet arse of yours with my cum, ‘cause watching you orgasm just drives me wild. And I hope you’re still hard after that, ‘cause I wanna suck you again, until you cum in my mouth. I wanna taste you, lover,and I want you to taste yourself on my lips. That sound okay with you?”
“It gives us all a bit of a test run. I’m just excited about having a nanny I can talk to. Ugh, not that one.” She gestured disapprovingly at the shirt in his hand. “The blue one.”
Greg felt his lover’s tension beginning to fade under his touch, and he smiled gently as Mycroft responded to the kiss. He saw Mycroft’s breath quicken, and his own quickened in response. His eyes traveled down Fenris’s body, watching his erection grow, and he was pleased to see Mycroft’s effect on him.

Fenris came with a loud, howling moan as he felt Mycroft’s cock pulsing, pumping hot, slick cum against his flesh. When he was spent, he leaned over, licking the back of Greg’s neck and working his way down his body.
“So I see.” Greg eyed the Wolf God’s lean, muscular body and hard cock appreciatively. He glanced down at Mycroft’s cock, grinning happily as he led him to bed. “You’re not the only one who’s eager.”
“Yeah, assumin’ I’m not out on a case. Gimme a call when you’re ready and I’ll meet you if I’m free.”

“Mmm”, Sherlock purred like a big cat as he looked at John’s cock, licking his lips. Smiling, John crawled into bed. His lover immediately pushed him onto his back, nibbling his way down his body with agonizingly sensual slowness. He reached John’s cock, licking his way down it before nipping lightly at his inner thighs.

“And just imagine how it’d feel, tickling you inside while you fuck me…”
“He seems happy, though.”
“What?” Slightly shocked, John’s eyes widened, and he took another sip of his beer to cover his embarrassment. “Uh… Yeah”, he admitted reluctantly. “I wish to God I knew

“It’s blackmail, and I won’t have it”, John snarled.

He kept one hand on his lover’s thigh as his fingers slid between Fenris’s cheeks, teasing at his entrance. He slipped one finger in, wondering how human Fenris’s internal anatomy was. After a few moments, he slid a second in beside it.

that. If it weren’t for Rosie, he’d have stormed out for a long walk. Realizing that his daughter had been quiet for a long while, he turned to check on her and saw Mary crouched beside her.
Falling in love with him wasn’t as terrifying as the thought of losing John, or himself, in the process. He sighed softly, realizing he was already lost. He’d hoped if he did nothing, things would stay the same, but he realized he’d been deluding himself. John, no matter how much he wanted to, would never make the first move. Eventually, he’d meet someone else. John was a romantic, and not likely to be alone long. He’d want someone there for him; someone to be in love with. He’d want sex.

“John, about that… the sex, I mean; I don’t want you to feel that you have to do anything you don’t want. You’ve said before that I always have to have things
“There is little left in our modern age to challenge an adventuresome man like him, John. It may have been the desperation of boredom that led him to take such a chance. Having a man like Professor Challenger as one’s role model would be frustrating in a world with no new frontiers to explore.”
“Got your letter from
“You could have died last night. I almost died last night. With all this magic we’ll be dealing with, and Moriarty still running loose, that’s not a chance I’m willing to take. So which will it be? You have three options.”
“Nah, John, come on in an’ have a seat. I was just packin’ a few things up. Can I get you something?”
“Don’t play games with
“I’d be surprised if you didn’t”, laughed Greg. “I gotta say, that sex power thing you do is great.”
“That’s kinda complicated sweetheart, but he’s… family too.”
“It disintegrated.” He sighed softly. “I’ll explain it later.” His sleek black sedan pulled up beside them. “Please just go to your hotel.”
“I’m not going to have sex with you.”
“I know that. I also know he’s the best and the most decent man I’ve ever known.”
“It looks like the police have things under control. They’ll reach our position soon.” Mary was far too exhausted to possess any more bodies, and the seemingly never-ending tide of undead was finally starting to ebb. “Can you get Liam calmed down? We need to get out of here.”
“Round two?” John looked at the two of them incredulously. “I can’t imagine going again after that.”
“Problem? What problem?”
Mycroft closed his eyes, clearing his mind and locking away all thoughts of hostile action against the fairies. Sherlock watched the subtle details of Mycroft’s smile as it became genuine. Steven stared at Mycroft curiously for a moment, then relaxed his wings.

“Liam!” She looked up from the selection of tinned cat food, smiling when she saw him. “Please, call me Molly. It’s good to see you.”
“Good. Anthea, see if you can do anything about gettin’ some of those fires put out. If you can’t, back up Mycroft and me. Sherlock, what are you doing?”
. Are you here for her? Can she see you?”
“I admit he’d find falling in love terrifying. A
“Not until later. I thought I’d stop by and introduce you to someone.” He reached behind his ear and held out his finger. Perched on it was a large blue butterfly, nervously fanning its wings.
“Jesus Christ. Thanks, Tim. You were a lot of help. I know he’s going to be a pain. Damn, he can be stubborn! I was about to lose my temper with him.”
“What do you want me to do to you?” Mycroft smiled playfully as he nibbled Greg’s ear.
“God… yes!” John was nearly vibrating with need. He lifted his hips, wrapping his legs around him and groaning with pleasure as Sherlock’s long, lean cock sank into his body. Hand still entangled in his hair, he drew him into a kiss, devouring his lips as Sherlock began to move. Sherlock balanced himself on one arm so he could reach down, circling his hand around John’s cock and stroking it in rhythm with his thrusting.
“And since it’s
“I have to imagine so…”
“Hurry, Greg! She’s too strong; I can’t hold her long!” Shrugging Mary off, the old woman rushed towards Sherlock, still shrieking in anger. Mary lunged, kicking her off balance as Greg stepped forward, firing the taser. The wires shot out, bits of jade catching in her chest as the room cracked with electricity. With one final wail, she vanished. Suddenly illuminated, the three watched the bulb in the jar flicker and then grow brighter, until it shattered, leaving them in semi-darkness again. Greg gritted his teeth, struggling not to drop the jar as a shock of electricity went through him.
“Yes, I swear on my heart.” Two questions left. “If I’m going to protect both worlds, I need to know a lot more about the Fae than how to destroy them. Are you willing to provide the information I need to be your shield?”
orders. I assumed it was a personal decision, to prevent me from using you against him should some power struggle arise. Again, a very sensible precaution.” He chuckled good-naturedly. “I can strongly suggest things, but that is the limit of my power as far as you’re concerned. I have more authority over his younger brother than I do you.”

“Oh? You let him top you, huh?” Greg looked at him curiously, amusement twinkling in his dark brown eyes.
“Are you calling
insane.” He sat back in his chair, savoring the slow-spreading heat as he sipped his whisky. He already knew, by the look in Sherlock’s eyes, that this was an argument he probably wouldn’t win. He tried a different tactic. “What does
“I’d think chasing a skin-stealing demon behind a hell-hound would be adventure enough for one day.” Kicking off his shoes, he pulled off his trousers and pants and laid down beside Sherlock.
“I was?”
“Almost forty-five minutes.” He grinned. “I imagine you’re dehydrated. Stay there, and I’ll get you some water.” He hopped out of bed, grabbing a couple of bottles of water from the mini-fridge beside the bed.
“You’re a great kisser, lover.”
“Well, don’t think I’m going to clean all this mess up, boys.” She tried, somewhat unsuccessfully, to hide her smile. John had always been good for Sherlock, and she couldn’t have been happier for them both.
“I can afford it”, he said softly. He looked away, trying to hide the pain in his eyes. The thought of going back to sleeping alone was agonizing.
“Who are you?” He turned to see what would have looked like his reflection if his clothes had been made of the forest. Even they were copied down to the slightest details; the bright red stitching on his coat, the blue of his scarf, even the buttons of his shirt were all duplicated in leaves, bark, flowers and vines.
“Two months ago, during the last full moon.” He glanced about nervously, trying to decide if the detective had been followed. “I’m not
“If it makes you uncomfortable we can send it all back, but it’s all coming out of an account that I never use and never intend to use. The only reason my wardrobe comes from it is that Mycroft insisted that I at least
“I like Violet better. Let’s call me that instead. Is this my room? It doesn’t look like a girl’s room.”
“Tim, I’m about to show you somethin’ that’s gonna be hard to believe. Just stay real calm and quiet, and I’ll explain, but you’re not gonna believe me ‘til you see ‘em.” He led Tim past the fountain, to the spot near the hawthorn tree where the fairies usually appeared, and sat down. Tim sat in the grass beside him, looking at him curiously. A few moments passed, then a large bumblebee appeared, landing on Greg’s shoulder. He watched in astonishment as his uncle held out his hand and the bee landed on it.
“John, you can still say no if you want, but I’ve invited him back to our room.”

“What’s he like, this Mycroft fellow? He hasn’t tried anything funny, has he?”
helpful.” John laughed, somewhere between amused and nervous. It might, he thought, be best if Sherlock got dressed, and he wondered why he felt so nervous. It never occurred to him that the two things were connected.
The tatters of its once brilliant mind hungered, yearning for completeness. It instinctively sought what it had sensed earlier; two brightly luminous minds among many dim ones. The pale sunlight had kept it at bay, hiding in the shadows, and now that night had fallen, they were gone. It paused, trying to track them like a hound catching a scent on the wind. One was lost to it; the distance was too great, but it could sense the other, far away. It flowed across the fog-shrouded landscape, making its way toward London.
“You wouldn’t be jealous?”
“Cum. I need you to cum in me first.” He bent his head and parted his lips, wrapping an inhumanly long tongue around the base of Mycroft’s cock and sliding it up the shaft.
“You look happy.” She said wistfully.
“The basement ceiling’s not very high. If he transforms, he’s going to take out the entire ground floor, including the stairway.”
: (24 April, mid-evening)
“Yeah, I’d like that.” Greg reached down, grasping Mycroft’s hand and pulling him to his feet. “I was hoping you’d ask.”
“Calm down, Donovan.”
John reached out for the oil and found it almost mysteriously appearing as Sherlock slipped it into his hand. He drizzled a bit on his fingers, awkwardly recapping the now-slippery bottle. His fingers gently caressed Sherlock’s arse, slipping between the cheeks, slowly teasing their way to… something hard. He stopped, his eyes wide and bewildered.
“Mmm, lover…” Greg stood behind Mycroft, nibbling at his neck as he helped him unbutton his shirt. “I love doing this; stripping all your clothes off.”
“Dear God, I can’t imagine…” Mycroft removed the pullover he was wearing, sneering at it in distaste. They’d taken Violet, Alice and Fenris shopping. All three had been in dire need of clothing, and the girls had needed more appropriate furnishings for their rooms. To say that keeping track of all three in the shops had been a challenge would be an understatement.
“I was in Los Angeles last month for a business matter. While I was there, I heard rumors that a local nightclub owner was capable of granting favors of a most extraordinary nature. I did a background check and while all his documents seem in order, there is absolutely no record of him beyond five years ago. Strangely enough, he also seems to be some sort of free-lance consultant for the LAPD’s homicide department. Intrigued, I paid him a visit. He claimed to be the Devil.”  He smiled at Sherlock and John shivered slightly. Friendly as he seemed, there was something distinctly predatory about him when he smiled. “I was, of course, highly doubtful.”
“Mary, is that a bad bird?” Having lost her fear of Mary, Alice hid behind her and peered up fearfully at Bran.

“Hello, Sherlock. Do you like my little celebration? It’s very festive.” She clapped her hands with child-like glee as she watched the fires spreading across the city below. “I’ve always liked fire. I think I’ll fill the world with fire.”
After take-off, they shared a light meal while Steven flitted excitedly around the cabin, landing occasionally to nibble at the biscuits and milk Sherlock had laid out for him. By the end of the meal, John was yawning, and Steven had fallen asleep, nestled behind Sherlock’s ear. They made their way to the bedroom, and Sherlock gently moved the little fairy onto his shirt, which he’d folded on the dresser to as a make-shift bed for him. He and John stripped their clothes off and slid into bed. Cuddling together, John soon fell asleep.
“Alright, Molly.” He shouldered the bag and gathered his daughter in his arms. He stopped at the doorway, looking back at her. “I really am sorry.”
“Are the child protection people going to take me away now?” She leaned against him, clinging to his arm. “Mummy says they’re all bad people but she lies a lot. I don’t think she loves me. She’s always saying I’m bad. Sometimes she hurts me, even when I’ve been good.”

“A bit.”, he admitted ruefully. “But I

“John!”

“No, Mary’s the only ghost I can see.”
As their bodies began to move together, time seemed to stop, and the world faded away until each of them knew nothing but the other. Their moans grew louder as they neared climax. John growled, driving himself in deep as Sherlock came, crying out John’s name. John finished moments later, emptying himself into his lover, and the two collapsed together, lying intertwined in sticky, insensate bliss.
Sherlock had taken it on himself to brief Mycroft on their findings, obviously eager to get it all over with so he could get on with his ghost hunt. He spoke quickly, skipping any details that Mycroft would consider either obvious or more suited to a written report. She looked at John and Greg and shrugged, nearly unable to follow Sherlock’s narrative despite the fact she’d been there.

“It didn’t seem quite sporting to leave the poor fellow down there. One gains a certain sense of sympathy for them when one can command them.” He picked it up, setting the creature on the ground. “Off you go, then. Find yourself a nice safe sewer.”
“Make love to me, John.” Sherlock had practically pounced on John the moment they’d gotten through the door. He wrapped his arms around him and bent his head, his breath tickling John’s ear. “I need to feel you inside me. Now.” He smothered any objections John might have had with a kiss, dragging him to the bedroom.

forbidden. Just think about the ripples this kind of thing creates in reality. Like, for example, a guy was gonna die in a few minutes when a drunk driver runs off the road, but that can’t happen because a bus just hit him instead. So now he’s dead early, the bus driver’s gonna be traumatized and the drunk driver ends up getting off scott-free. And that’s just one case. Multiply that by a bunch. All that stuff’s gonna have consequences that Destiny, me and a lotta other Powers are gonna have to fix. So everybody’s gonna be all pissed off, ‘cause she just made a whole lot of work for everybody. Plus the Fates have to weave a whole new thread for Alice, and shorten a bunch more, and they’re gonna be bitching about it for years. I’m probably going to take some flak for not taking… what’s her name, the baby Goddess you’ve got there?”
“Help you how?”
“Is that your medical recommendation?” He grabbed John’s arm, his long fingers brushing across his wrist. The glass slid into his hands as John jerked away.
“Me.” Greg sighed. “Mycroft’s right about magic gettin’ stronger. It seems the reason I could see Mary last night is because I’ve become a bloody medium in the last couple of days.”
“That’s incredible. I couldn’t even touch him, Greg! Sherlock, you’ve invented ghost armor.”
“Sherlock, what are you thinking? Whatever she was, whatever she might become, she’s just a child now.”

“I know. I’m glad.”
“Such as?”
“A bloody what?” Greg looked at Sherlock in dismay.
“That was enough sleeping sand to put down a full grown major Goddess, so I’d say at least a day, possibly more. As to what’s happened to her…” Loki knelt beside him, studying her with his bright green eyes. “Most of her power has been locked away. She’ll be able to access it slowly, as her mind matures.”
socialize. John-like…
“No doubt you’re right.” He smiled softly, thinking of the changes his brother had been through. “I’ll deny it if you tell him so, but Mycroft’s really surprised me. I’ve come to admire his ability to adapt. It wasn’t very long ago that he was nearly having a melt-down over the idea of being in a relationship with
“No, he was off today. I stopped by his flat when I was out shopping for Rosie.”
“I know what you mean. It’s a lot to get used to. Still, Lucifer’s actually a bit nice, once you get past that playboy image of his.” John smiled somewhat fondly, thinking of the incredibly intimate experience of making love with Sherlock wrapped in Lucifer’s wings.
“Shit! She’s fast!” Greg exclaimed, bringing up the taser as Mary grappled with her. She grabbed her from behind, struggling to hold her.
It hadn’t taken long to charm himself into a suite at the one of the best hotels in London, as well as acquiring a whole new wardrobe. Loki looked down at the suit he wore, trying to decide how he felt about modern fashions. The tie seemed a silly affectation, but he did like the feeling of the silk shirt against his skin. It was, he decided, less practical but overall quite a bit more comfortable than the leather, wool and fur he was accustomed to wearing. He looked at the large cart of room service food he’d ordered. It was certainly a welcome change from the rather monotonous diet of Jotunheim. He decided that he quite liked the conveniences the modern age had to offer. The lights dimmed suddenly as a tall hooded figure with a large heavy book chained to his right arm materialized. Loki sighed unhappily. Despite his caution in avoiding the Ways, he’d already been found.
‘Yeah, I’m putting in my resignation on Monday, along with a recommendation for your promotion.” Greg balanced the mobile on his shoulder while he loaded the latest delivery of mead, meat and other essentials into the refrigerator. He grinned, thinking that feeding Gods was an expensive proposition. “You deserve it. You did a hell of a job, gettin’ everybody organized like you did.”
“Against what? Sherlock… what is it you’re
“So I noticed.” His fingers drummed softly on the seat and a small frown line showed on his brow.
“Sherlock Holmes. What has Destiny decreed?”
“Oddly enough, no. I find myself strangely attached to him since we’ve bonded. I genuinely do consider him part of the family now. I suppose it’s due to the magic involved in bonding with him. The idea that my emotions may have been manipulated magically really should disturb me a great deal more than it does. Perhaps it’s because it’s mutual.”

wanna, then I’m interested. I don’t want you doin’ it out of some sense of obligation, but if it’s really got you intrigued, that’s fine. Seein’ you get hot is what turns me on.” He smiled softly at Mycroft and reached over to take his hand. He was, in reality, more than a little intrigued with the idea himself, but this was a decision Mycroft needed to make. He didn’t want his lover to feel any more pressured into it than he already was. “I just don’t want you to do anything you’d regret.”
“Mrs. Jenson is a different kind of ghost than you. She’s capable of moving objects. Look.” He pointed to a small curio cabinet, and Greg shone his torch on it. Several boxes sat nearby, the name of a local charity shop printed in marker on their sides. They were empty except for wadded and torn bits of paper. “She’s unpacked them, and very recently. Interesting.” He’d knelt, examining the boxes and the area around them more closely. “Greg, you said she was glowing. Describe it.”

“Get down!” Greg threw himself across Mycroft as a military attack helicopter fired, unleashing a hail of heavy artillery rounds over their heads at the dragon. They crouched, hidden behind the crenelated stonework as the great beast roared, fire pouring from its jaws. The helicopter erupted into flames, exploding as it went into the Thames.

“Good. I’m about to tell you about some things you may find alarming. In addition to fairies, there are a number of other magical creatures, some of which are quite dangerous, and they’re becoming much more common as time passes. It’s only a matter of time until it becomes common knowledge. Your uncle and I, along with some other gifted individuals, are doing what we can to see that
From his perch on the dresser, Steven had watched the two, pondering the mysteries of human mating. For the Fae, gender was a fluid thing and it had seemed a nearly incomprehensible thing to him that humans only seemed to have two. Fairies had five distinctly different gender modes and were capable of transforming between them as they desired. It seemed very limiting to him but the two humans seemed to be able to give each other pleasure, and he supposed that was all that mattered. It was reassuring to him to see his hive-kings had a strong bond.

“And you really believe all this?” She picked up the file, leafing through it.
“John, you’re in love with a man, and you liked giving him a blowjob. Is that really so awful?”
“It is… a bit awkward, but owing him a favor would be awkward as well, considering that Thomas already owes him one. Having the two highest ranking members of our organization both owing Lucifer a favor could be problematic. Also, I believe one can only ask him for one favor, which means I wouldn’t have that option in some future emergency. Fenris, you know him better than we do. What’s your opinion?”
“Fenris, can we play some more?” Alice tugged at his tail, bored with the conversation.

no shadow, and her reflection was absent from the mirror.
“True. Doesn’t it… worry you? Aside from her being a potentially psychopathic miniature Goddess, I mean.”
“You’re getting exceptionally good at that.” Sherlock smiled and sank down beside him as John drew him into a kiss.
“What?” Greg and John rushed after him as he ran back into the garden while Sherlock went to get Mycroft. They found Alice sitting under the tree, looking very much alive and crying as she shook Violet’s shoulder, trying to wake her. Tim knelt beside her, obviously worried.
“I… Mary and I were talking, and we think… she and I were wondering…”
“I’m gettin’ used to it. Come on in.” The smile faded from Greg’s face as he turned away. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to see him, but he didn’t really want to explain about magic to his 82 year-old father. He sat the box and his father’s things down in the foyer. “You want something to drink, maybe a sandwich or something?”
“What does she mean by that?” Mycroft looked curiously at Lucifer.
“Dear God… it

“Even the extra ones at the middle?” He frowned discontentedly at his reflection. No matter how many years had gone by or how much weight he’d lost, he still saw himself as fat.
“Thank you. That was one of the most beautiful experiences of my life.”
“I’m not sure that’s true. Remember the assurances he demanded of Thomas? Why would an evil being demand he not kill? If he were evil, then why would he care? And why exact a promise that he wouldn’t create more vampires?”
“Look, I get why people say you gotta love somebody because they’re family, but you don’t. He is your dad, so if he ever comes to his senses and realizes what a great kid you are, you should try to forgive him, but if he’s gonna stay a complete prick, you don’t gotta love him.”

Mycroft’s misgivings and inhibitions had given way entirely to the sheer sensuality of the situation and he held off his orgasm as long as possible. He drank in the sights and sensations with eager eyes; the tight, slick heat of Fenris’s body around his cock, the sight of his beloved squirming with pleasure and watching him with those dark passion-filled eyes, and the growls of ecstasy and trembling limbs that told him his cock was capable of driving a God to orgasm. Finally, senses overwhelmed, he came with a loud cry, emptying himself deep into Fenris’s body. Panting, he fell beside Greg, claiming a deep, passionate kiss. An odd, unexpected sense of affection for Fenris came over him with the completion of their bond, and he reached down, gently running his fingers through the wolf God’s hair.
“It’s way better. Bein’ with you is the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Mycroft. You’re the sexiest man I ever met, and you’re the love of my life. Forever, lover.”
“No! Of course I knew I liked women. But that sort of thing; it’s just a phase with some people, like that… emu thing.”
On the other realm, the entity began to laugh with pure joy. After over 3,000 years, the seal had been cracked. He would soon be free of his dreary existence in this frozen wasteland; free to return to the Earthly realm and finally have some fun. He just had to be patient a little while longer, and let things take the course he’d set into motion. Magic would soon return to Earth in full force. Though they were lesser beings, the realms had been so much more amusing when humans wielded magic.
Her attempts to research Mycroft Holmes had been frustrating and she suspected his position with the government was far beyond minor. She’d even resorted to calling Anderson to ask about him, only to be warned off and hung up on. She had to admit he wasn’t the most reliable source given his history of mental problems, but he’d sounded genuinely frightened.
“Yes, thank you. What’s this all about, Mycroft?” She raised one elegant eyebrow, looking at him curiously. She’d never been invited to his home, so whatever he had to discuss must be both private and important.
“She’s here?” Mycroft followed Sherlock’s gaze, estimating where she must be. Though he was careful not to react, he found the idea of unseen entities in his home a very disturbing breech in security.
Oberon laughed, holding up three fingers.

“Six months. All I’m asking is you spend six months tutoring the child and behaving yourself. What’s that in the life-span of an immortal?”
“I know. I dropped by to see Greg while you were gone. We’re planning on checking out the other ghosts that the vampire mentioned, to make sure they’re not dangerous.”
“I don’t know. He instructed me to go back to my hotel and warned me to put out the Do Not Disturb sign. I have a vague recollection of disturbing dreams that night, but I can’t recall the specifics of it beyond the sense of experiencing what I can only describe as sleep paralysis. When I awoke, it was three nights later, and I was as I am now; a vampire.”

Most of the others are way too tied up in rules and following orders to actually give a fuck about what’s right or wrong.” She paused, thinking. “Amenadiel’s been in L.A. for a while, trying to get Lucifer to go back to Hell, so he
what it feels like to have someone like that and lose them. Maybe that’s why I’m so scared. I asked him to give me some time before we told everyone that we’re a… a couple. It’s just not that easy for me, just… coming-out like that. If I
John pushed back against Sherlock’s cock, and the heat of desire went through them both. He rolled over, pressing their hips together and rubbing his cock against his lover’s. Sherlock’s eyes opened as he leaned in for a kiss. They laid there, kissing and caressing each other until they were almost frenzied with need.
“We just got engaged a few days ago, but I’ve known him for years.”
“There is no reason for shame. You are young yet, and have much to learn.”
“I can’t wait to get home.” John sat on the bed and pulled off his shoes.
“I don’t
Mycroft willed his dark thoughts away, reassuring himself that no one would ever know. He couldn’t change what he’d done in the past, but Greg had changed his future. He might never be a good man, but being with Greg had made him a better one. He resolved that he’d do everything within his power to ensure Greg’s happiness. His smile returned as he thought again of Greg’s words.
“Well he does give me a tingle, kinda like a ghost does. Maybe other people pick that up subconsciously.” Greg grinned a bit as he grabbed himself a beer and settled on the stool beside Mycroft. He was never sure how much weight Mycroft actually gave his theories, but he appreciated the effort.  “I wanna hear how your day went before the others get here, but there’s somethin’ I’d like to have a little chat about first.”

that. It’s the most important bit.” He stepped close, leaning into Sherlock’s space until their noses were almost touching. Sherlock found himself staring into his own eyes. Unflinching, he gazed back into pupils as dark as the void. He felt something pushing against his mind. Narrowing his eyes, he pushed back, and the creature staggered backwards, laughing and shaking its head. “You’re interesting, for a human.”

“I suppose so… but they’d have to be experienced with children. Who’ve you got in mind?”

Fenris came bounding in from the garden, looking hopefully at him as he wagged his tail.

“My God…”
“It is, really. It’s hard sometimes though. I hate keeping secrets, but not many people would understand. They’d think I’m some kind of monster. I guess, you know, technically I am… I mean, I guess I’m not really human anymore, but I’d never want to hurt anybody. I worry about that… not me hurting someone; I mean people finding out what I am. I was really scared the other night at the lab. I’d have never had the nerve to come forward if it weren’t for Tom being there.”

“I’m kinda too busy to teach you, but I’ll send one of my helpers. It’ll be a pain being short-staffed for a while, but it’s probably worth it in the long run. But if you run into any other mediums, you’ve got to promise to teach them in return. As long as they’re not, you know, assholes. You’re gonna have enough trouble with amateurs as it is.”
“Me too. I’ve never seen you or Sherlock so happy.” She patted his arm affectionately. “You really are good for each other.”
“Probably. It seems the sort of thing he’d do.” Mary settled on a chair across from him at the table.

the Holmes brothers have good taste in men.”
“Fuck no, and fuck him too. Are you alright? Where are you?” Tim blinked back tears at the sound of his older brother’s voice.
“I have the distinct memory of a woman’s voice, whispering in my ear. I had a secret lover. No one else reacted to the sound. I blurted out she had a secret lover, and they just assumed I’d deduced it as usual. But it was more like some… random hallucination. It was also correct. And it’s not the only case recently that’s had a… bizarre aspect.”

Careful not to wake John, who’d fallen asleep on the sofa, Sherlock looked cautiously in the kitchen. Satisfied that no explosions were imminent, he tossed his coat across a chair and settled himself on the floor beside the small stack of files Greg had left for him, intending to sort through them. Instead, he found himself staring at John.

“We have?” Arthur looked at his wife in surprise.
“Thank God he’s alright. I don’t know why he didn’t come to me. When I found out what Tony did… He’s lucky I’m so damned old, or I’d be over there kicking his arse right now, I would! What started it? All Andy would tell me is they had some sorta row.”
“You can see things others can’t.” It seemed a very silly question to Fenris.
“You’re inviting us to Mycroft’s? He lets you do that, does he? Just invite people round? To his house?”
Still hard, Sherlock pulled out of John, reaching back to pull out
“John?” Sherlock sat up, wondering what time it was. He glanced out the window, noting the sun was going down. He’d slept several hours. “Why didn’t you wake me?”
“Oh?” Mary raised one eyebrow curiously. “Another little man-chat?”
“Rabbits”, Bill muttered, glancing at Steven, who was perched on the arm of the chair beside him. The two had finally come to an uneasy truce over a tin of biscuits, but Steven remained cautious. Bill attracted far too many ghosts for his comfort, even with the protection the jade ring gave him. He cocked his head, trying to decide what the human had meant by rabbits.

“I can tell you’ve put a lot of effort into your garden.”
