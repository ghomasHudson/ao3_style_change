“Tired, but better.”  Cas pulled himself into a sitting into position.  “I take it you found the armour.”
“I need a moment,” Lucifer said.  He walked quickly out of the room.
The calling spell wasn’t complex, especially with family, but it required a calmness that Castiel was having trouble finding.  It took him far longer than he’d have liked to make contact.
He wondered what his parents would have thought of Cas.  The wizard thing probably wouldn’t have been an issue, they both had consulted with magicians while he was growing up.  He remembered herring a few things about the Novak family.  Not much, but they were an old family and that would have appealed to his mother’s sense of decorum.  Dean was sure his parents would have approved of, if not out right like Cas.  Sammy definitely would like Cas.  This realization made Dean happy.  He was smiling brightly when Cas came back over.
“It would be easier on the horses if they only had one rider,” Castiel said.  “Charlie can have my horse and I’ll walk too.”
Tonight was the chance to try, to see what it would be like, to take a chance. Cas’s stomach fluttered, and he placed his palm across it to soothe the tremors. It wasn’t quite something he’d experienced before, and he took a deep breath in around it, feeling his hand be pushed out and followed it back in. His breath was a little shaky and he frowned as he processed it, trying again. He hoped it wasn’t gastrointestinal distress.
Cas inhaled sharply, and swallowed. Dean could see his eyes shining in the moonlight. “Everything I did, I thought I was doing what was best. For everyone… and for you, Dean.”
"What do you want, Cas?" Sam asked. "Since when do you get hungry, anyway?"
"Fine. We can figure it out on the way."
"It was..." He mused. "Fascinating."
He stood over the toilet and held himself, sighing as he relieved himself, letting his bladder release all the beer, and tequila, he took in last night. This, this was the perfect level of morning after, a little bit groggy, and little bit heavy, but no throwing up, no real headache, just the knowledge he had a good night. Perfect.
"Cold spots." Dean checked off.
Sam looked round, checking out the windows, but found they were all closed. "Dean, did you get air conditioner in here, or something?"
Cas blinked, and Sam looked over to him as best he could, startled by the sudden sadness he saw in him. He fought the urge to tell him the truth, to hint to him, somehow, but instead opted for "I'm sorry."
“Not as a human.” Sam pointed out from a few meters away. Sam was fearsome in a fight, he knew that. He was aware how much taller this human was than him now, how much taller he had always been than his vessel. Sure, before he had been the size of the Chrysler building, crammed into the just-shy of 6ft body, but now this was it. 5 Feet and 11 inches, no higher.
“What’s wrong?” He heard behind him, and he span around, seeing Cas in the doorway. He was slightly out of breath, hair dripping, and his shirt was half buttoned up. Dean swallowed, trying not to look at how the water shined on his neck, his chest. His eyes were wide as he took in the room, which then squinted into a frown. “This doesn’t look like an emergency.”
"That only just dawning on you?" Livvie looked out of the window, and her eyes widened as she saw the first sliver of true sunlight on the horizon. "Get out."
Sam frowned. “Sure. And him saying “careful or it’ll sound like you care” was nothing?”
Dean groaned, Cas could see rather than hear it. “
"Did you think they were still going to be there?" He asked, nodding over Cas's shoulder when he received nothing but a confused look. "Your wings?"
“And ourselves too.” Cas mused.
“I’ve been wanting to check this place out since we got into town.” Dean grinned, looking around from their table. Man, it was a novelty to be outside, relaxing in a place that wasn’t the bunker. Sure, he loved it there, it had pretty much everything they ever wanted and never had, but god damn it… being out in society again? Sitting in a bar with people around living their own lives, completely separate from him, it felt amazing. He felt elated. He knew that the bunker’s air system was good but the air sure did taste sweeter right now.
“Sam, cold spot.” He announced, and Sam looked up, drawing his gun. Cas followed suit, but no one immediately appeared.
"Last night." Dean said a little too quickly as they drove off.
"No!" Sam stood up, trying to placate his brother. "Of course not, Dean! What I'm saying is that we need to be smart about it."
time since he’d really got laid, months now. The last time he got anywhere close was-
"It was. But he needed to. His family were dicks."
"We'll look after him."
Dean had eventually gone back to Cas's room, accompanied by Sam. He alternated between being unable to keep his eyes off the comatose man, to being unable to even look at him.
"Oh." Dean's face fell slightly, realising his job was about to get more difficult. "But not all of her, I bet."
This was up to Cas.
"No, I mean," Sam back peddled. "I've got backup. I'm backup." He explained, and Dean leant back a bit, raising his eyebrows.
She threw the blade.
He’d risked so much by coming to Dean, their friendship, this ease which they were all living with, surely it wasn’t worth it. And he must have known that Dean would say no, he knew this much about Dean Winchester. Dean was decidedly straight, brought up by his Father and by society to be so. And while he knew about Dean’s dalliances in his adolescence he knew these were not choices made out of passion but of desperation, and that it wasn’t something he’d enjoyed. He knew all of this, and yet he’d still put Dean in this position.
And left again instantly.
“So don’t let him hunt.” She shrugged, and Dean looked at her in confusion. “I’m serious. You’re that worried, don’t let him hunt.”
"So, Cassie; you've fallen."
Frank Devereaux had given the boys co-ordinates to the warehouse. It was another of his latest paranoid assertions; the Leviathan's were taking charge of this place and turning it into something or other.
"Not quite, Dean." Livvie smugly told him, winking to Cas from across the room as he watched her with silent rage.
How crazy to think that Castiel, former angel of the lord, heavenly warrior and celestial being turned human was more okay with this gay stuff than him. In the grand scheme of things, after everything he’d been through, Dean guessed it didn’t register. And hadn’t he said that in the bible it had never really been in there in the first place? Hadn’t he lain siege to that Christian bookshop over that very reason? Had he known then what he wanted? He could ask Cas, but that felt too close for comfort right now.
“Because he fought with Raphael?” Cas asked, and Dean nodded. “He was heavily indoctrinated.”
“Yeah, but the good sludge,” Dean said smugly, watching his brother get riled up at his deliberate obtuseness. “Full of vitamins.”
"Sorry!" She whispered with an apologetic smile. "Didn't mean to wake y'all!"
Dean got ready to drop the match, fingers tightening in preparation to release, to call upon the angel that might kill them before helping, when a voice stopped them, calling out from behind, a voice that had no right to be here in this room.
“When did you do that?”
Sam scoffed at him, shucking off his jacket and placing another log in the hearth. “You know it wouldn’t kill you to help your kidneys every once in a while.”
Sam knew about them, they all knew it. Dean had said he’d talked to Sam about it, that the conversation had went well. He would have been nervous to mention anything, but Dean had already made it clear… “As was the sex.”
Balthazar stood in front of them, a smile on his face. At least he could see what he was fighting.
.” He glared at Cas. “Right now I’m no threat to you, but you can bet whoever jumps in will gun for your head pretty damn fast. Kekzor was a big fan of the apocalypse, and you guys stopped that. Agmamoth was a follower of Azazel, Ezaamech just doesn’t like hunters… trust me, you’re going to have a way tougher time with them.”
“It’s not your fault,” Cas approximated a shrug, and glanced up at Sam. “Unless it is, in which case I would certainly appreciate an explanation.” He attempted a wry smile, which turned genuine as he saw Sam catch it. He was getting better at jokes, he could tell.
“Aren’t we doing that right now?”
“And where do you go when you’re not here?” He asked, and she looked at him again, sighing.
But would he change it back?
“Eugh, but Sam’s gonna be around.” He groaned, but Cas shook his head.
. They shone from his face, a beacon. Cas couldn’t see Dean’s soul, not any more, and he knew now that he had taken it for granted while he could. It was etched deep into his memory from the first time he saw Dean, his butchered, bruised, torn soul, terrified and with one defence of enacting cruelty on other souls. He saw Dean, the real, true Dean. He’d known what to expect, had known that they were too late to save him before the first seal broke, but he had expected to feel pity, or more likely revulsion. Instead he felt sadness, overwhelming, and the intense urge to fight, to protect this being in front of him, to fight to save him and make him whole. The atrocity that was done to him somehow outweighed the atrocities he was enacting, and Cas had roared in despair when he saw him. This tarnished, agonisingly beautiful soul.
Breathe out. “Trying not to.” He finally got out. He was allowed to have this, to want this. This was allowed. No one was gonna charge in and break this up, he wasn’t about to get attacked. He didn’t need his fight or flight right now.
Cas winced briefly as the needle worked over his spine, before plastering the poker-face back on, teeth gritted perhaps a little tighter than before. She soothingly petted his shoulder. "Try and relax, Cas," she told him, glancing over to Dean. He caught Kirsty's look, her quick flick of her eyes down to his hands. He knew what she was thinking. But that wasn't him. He wasn't the hand-holder, he wasn't the comforter. He patched up wounds, he gave pats on the back, he gave a shot of whiskey and a hundred bucks to go see a hooker. He didn't hold hands.
Cas sighed, the situation in front of him presenting itself clearer. They were right, it made sense tactically. She was human, and law abiding. But it still went against the grain. “I’ll come with you to Kansas.” Cas compromised, and Dean nodded once in agreement. A deal.
“We need backup in case something goes south.”
"Huh." Sam said.
No response.
But it was important to Sammy, so Dean came along, standing close enough to be involved, but mainly left Sam to it. Dean looked back to the car where Cas stood waiting, watching them. Dean had offered that Cas join them, but he seemed to pick up on the halfheartedness of the offer, recognising it was just for the Winchesters.
Reaching the motel they found that Dean had already sorted the room. He certainly hadn't gone out of his way to accommodate Cas in this, had instead chosen the usual two-bed rooms, though, Sam noticed, it did have a semi-comfortable looking recliner in the room, if Cas didn't mind staying on something that probably had never been washed.
“Charlie found out about the books, huh?” Sam checked, and Dean nodded as he straightened back up.
“Is this outfit nice enough for this restaurant?” Cas looked down at himself, taking in the cotton green shirt, embroidered gently with white thread. The rest of his outfit was simply the pants and jacket from the tailored suit Dean had made him buy, and he looked up at Dean, who had turned a little pink again.
"Please."
"It was worth a try. The answer was no, for the record."
"So how's it feeling?" Dean asked, motioning with his finger for Cas to spin around and face the sink, like the night before.
He let these thoughts roll around his head, because if it wasn’t these thoughts, then it would be about what he couldn’t think about, about who he wouldn’t let himself think about.
"That was never gonna work." He muttered gruffly.
She knew the hurt that they were both feeling. But she couldn't let that stop her.
Cas froze, watching Dean, waiting to see what his plan was.
But, no, he realised as he walked into the garage and saw Dean waiting by the car, already moved out and ready to drive. Dean looked up from chewing on a fingernail, and a smile spread across his face, shaky, and Cas realised he was nervous too. Dean had been waiting for him, had been waiting with purpose because he wanted him. This was better, he knew.
“No,” He said quickly, turning around - when had he left the bed? He was standing, suddenly. He had slippers, didn’t he? Cas was sitting up now, and Dean could see he was worried. “No, I’m fine, everything’s fine.”
The glass in front of him refilled, thank fuck, another measure of whiskey, and he gestured for it to be filled higher. He took a quick gulp, and felt the heat of it fill his chest. Better.
That wasn’t- oh. He thought Cas was jacking off. Right. “Yes.” He said firmly, nodding his head. “It was
"Doesn't make up for what he did." Dean said stubbornly, taking a big sip. "That was, like, a year and a half ago."
"What?" Sam asked. "What did you do?"
The angel to land was that in the body of a small girl. She recognised her almost instantly - it was Zedkiel, Castiel's friend from earlier; the angel of forgiveness.
Dean pauses, and Cas wonders if Charlie is there, distracting his attention. “It’s in the way you speak, you gotta relax them. Or, you can say something like….
"We're
Was it being away for a time, for the first time since he was human? Had absence made Dean’s beauty all the more profound to Cas?
Dean blinked. "What?"
"The faucets on this suck worse than Sammy's taste in music. I don't care that you saw Archimedes sitting in the tub playing with himself, they didn't have running water back then." He reached over, grabbing the handles. "Hot, cold. Supposed to be, anyway. You kinda have to wait for it to stop having a panic attack over being turned on, then fiddle with it. Sam says he's gonna fix the pressure soon." He looked up at Cas, who was watching him, eyes following every move. "We'll fix you up with some clothes. The old suit got left behind at the hospital, hope you don't mind."
He suddenly felt that same excitement. A home of his own, a room of his own, all his own. He’d never had this, and he knew Dean hadn’t either.
Cas didn't know if he was the cause of Dean's sadness, of how much of a role he had in it, but he knew he wanted to fix it. He knew that he wanted to be the one to see Dean's smile for the first time again. The real smile, not the callous, sarcastic smile.
Dean nodded at her, a wide smile across his face. "Dean," He said, before nodding to Cas. "Cas."
Dean turned to leave, but Cas looked at the picture frame that he had dropped. It had not shattered, luckily, and he bent to pick it up.
He felt Dean try to shift underneath him, move his legs to knock Cas off balance, but he compensated, and Dean stayed firm. Dean huffed out a breath and Cas could feel it across his lips.
Why’d he have to go and say that? They’d been doing fine for years without bringing this up, without putting words to whatever it was going on here. They’d been through a lot together, this was his best friend, the one person in the world, ‘sides Sam, who knew him best of all. And maybe there’d been weird moments over the years (or over the last few weeks in the shower), moments where Dean had let his mind wander and consider, on freer days when Dean felt himself shift past the yesses and no’s, and wrongs and rights that he’d learned about everything in this damn world.
” She sighed. “
Cas looked at them both. “Are we-” He cut himself off, shaking his head. “Let’s get in.” He reached for the door, brushing Dean in the process, and Dean tried to smother how he flinched away. Cas hefted the door open, it was stiff and creaked, and inside… pitch black. The light from outside lit a few feet, a short hallway, a kind of porch, and Dean gingerly stepped over the threshold, waiting for a booby trap, a giant rolling stone ball… nothing. He stepped forwards.
for help, you would have given it.” Cas rushed out, and Dean could hear the frustration in him.
"Yeah, I got that."
Smiling into it, he turned back to the others, clasping the warm cup with both hands. However, as he spotted Cas, halfway through pulling his green sweater off, he twitched, the drink spilling over onto his hands and down his front. He swore at the sharp pain, coinciding with his friend pulling the material over his head, missing Cas's blue eyes widen in alarm at Dean's exclamation of pain. He instead focused on his own clothing, pulling the sodden material from his skin, feeling the air hit his damp skin, chilling him instantly despite the burn. As he instinctively moved the mug away from him, he sloshed more over his hand and onto the floor, before he eventually managed to put it down.
And then a guy, cute, moderately age appropriate, had taken Cas’s hand and Dean had all but
"What happened to Jimmy?" Sam asked, and Cas looked up in surprise. "I mean, is he still in there? Is he gone?"
“Oh.” She said, nodding appreciatively.
"Hey, Cas?" Sam called over. Cas looked up, slight confusion on his face, still not understanding the film, even with the help of the blurb. "You wanna help make dinner?"
"Oh, it's a party and the whole world's invited to tap dance in it." He rambled.
Dean got it, but he shook his head. “No, it was good. I liked it. We can do more of that.” He took a deep breath, filling his lungs as much as they would take, breathing in courage. “I wanna see where this goes with you.”
“A-” Cas’s eyes went wide, looking from Dean to the sight ahead and back again. “A gay bar? Why?”
He picked the first room in the hallway. The rooms were identical so the choice there was arbitrary, but it made sense. Dean had tactically chosen one further along, more time to get alerted to an intruder, more time to react.
"I'm a Nephilim." She told them. She pointed at Castiel, and winked as she walked away, calling back "Have fun explaining that one."
“So we’re going to meet her?” Cas confirms, and Dean whips round to look at him instantly.
"She's got the angel blade." Sam reminded him. "Still so sure?"
"We have not done him a favour yet." Cas reminded. He stared at Dean, watching as the hunter paused, clearly disconcerted by the gaze from those big blue eyes. After a few seconds he sighed and put down the beer.
Dean moved to stand, not looking at Cas. He placed his cards face up on the table, tapping them for good measure. “I fold.”
Anna sighed, glancing over at Cas. He hadn't said anything.
"What do you mean?"
"Or what, Dean? You gonna hit me? Is that gonna make you feel better?"
She woke up bolt upright, breathing heavily as she processed the information.
, the bitter, soapy, salty taste of him… he moaned and gripped Cas’s thighs, hands curling in and digging his nails into the tender flesh of Cas’s inner thighs, and he felt Cas jump, the motion pushing him further into Dean’s mouth, and he loved the way his throat contracted around him, coughing as he pulled off slightly, relishing in the way Cas shivered and grasped him at the sensation. He could hear Cas chanting his name above him, and he wanted to make him say more, to say anything, to lose all words until all he had was sound and sensation. He wanted him to feel good, so good.
"What?"
"Look, I was stupid...so stupid. I should've just waited to hear back from you instead of assuming. I just...I got so jealous because I thought you were with someone else, and I didn't think straight."
Castiel sighed and slowly shut the door behind him. Maybe he should text Dean back, apologize?  But even as the thought passed through his head, he dismissed it. Dean probably didn't want to hear from him.
Dean shook his head. “This is in my blood.”
Dean finally meets Gabriel, his link to Lucifer. But the more he learns about Cas's world, the more he wants to protect him from it.
Dean nodded, but a furrow still lined his brow. "You said youngest son?"
The sobs, which Dean could now tell were coming from the closet, faltered. Dean looked to Benny, who simply shrugged.
“You didn’t seem too affected.”
Was it any wonder that so many people had stopped to stare at him as they’d navigated the crowded floor below? And even up above, when they reached the VIP area, the door had no sooner closed them off from the loud club below than they were surrounded by some of the other girls who were already in attendance. Both Anna and Meg had been pushed aside, but neither seemed surprised. So this was apparently the norm when out with Cas?
Yes, that’s what he was doing: running all the variables. He was
Both father and daughter watched as Castiel trudged toward the house, more defeated than they’d ever seen him.
"You've been busy, huh?" She finally asked. Castiel smiled and nodded. "Are you okay?"
“Who was that?” Castiel whispered.
"So? She never found out," Castiel defended.
He burst out laughing at her incredulous expression. “Yeah, I felt the same when I realized it.”
“Why?”
He’d long since figured out the solution for Sammy’s problem. It hadn’t taken long to compile his case. In fact, it had taken longer to figure out how he would present it: Charles—more casual, a strong bond with each of his children, his only daughter’s happiness on the line—would be easy, but John—strong, rigid, determined to create alliances through any means—would take a little more convincing. But Dean knew his father well enough to know that when Dean presented the numbers for the trade agreements, King Winchester would give in.
“Why?” he asked.
Yet his posture slowly loosened, his body giving as he curled against Dean again.
Dean raised a hand to his ear, speaking softly. “You all hearing that?”
FUN FACT: this chapter is definitely the longest...and I wrote it in first person because there was no way I could keep Dean's "voice" using third person. In fact, I'm still a little worried I may have gone a little too "soft" sometimes, but who doesn't love a soft Bad Boy? Especially Bad Boy Dean Winchester!
He stepped into the store with its shattered glass front and found himself inside the jet. He recognized the vague, shadowy shapes of his team, but they were all facing away from him. They all watched the two people at the back—the only two clear-cut and defined figures.
“Dean! Cas has been looking for you everywhere!” She pulled out her phone, shooting off a text.
Sam, who obviously didn’t see everything, frowned. “Who?”
"What else was I supposed to think?" Dean countered.
“I’m sorry,” Cas murmured, his expression regretful. “I wish—”
at him. “If you are what you say you are…”
” Sam clapped Dean on the back as he struggled to regain his breath. When the coughing subsided and his tears cleared, Cas stood only a few feet away, talking to Jo about her new internship.
He raced through the grass, following the cries, until he found it. The cat lay sprawled on the ground, its body shaking with frantic gasps, its tail twitching in agitation.
“Fuck, that’s hot!” Dean grabbed Cas by the hair and yanked him off, pulling him back up to his mouth for another hungry kiss. While he had Cas distracted with his tongue, he reached down to tug those sinfully tight jeans off. He ripped Cas’s blazer and shirt off and tossed them off to the side. Both men ignored the loud crash as the centerpiece on the coffee table toppled over, spilling decorative stones everywhere. Once Cas was blessedly naked, Dean slapped his ass cheek, and Cas moaned.
“Names, deaths, payouts...” Lucifer said with a shrug. “The usual. But now you see why he’ll do
Anael’s soft voice reached him. “Are you okay, Castiel?”
Castiel nodded as the woman pulled him into the hug, then realized she probably couldn't see him. “Yes, ma'am.”
“Sure,
But it was too late.
“Of course,” Sam agreed.
“No light, no heat. Just four stone walls gouged with scratch marks left by desperate men driven crazy by the isolation,” Harvelle described.
The plan was simple: take out the factory first then move up to the house. If the team hit the party first, there were workers down at the factory to destroy evidence. But if the factory went first, Crowley would be too busy with his guests to be warned about it, much less destroy any evidence. And even if he wasn’t busy enough, Cas would be there to keep him distracted.
“The pleasure is all mine,” she replied, her expression gracious. Her bearing was one that Castiel was used to, having grown up in the world he did. She had money, that much was certain, and the bearing that indicated she came from old money. “Anna mentioned you had a piece I might be interested in, and I just had to come see it for myself,” she explained, and Castiel nodded enthusiastically.
With an internal groan, Castiel wrenched his thoughts away from the alpha’s physique. Not the time or place...
“Gordon’s a loose cannon,” Dean sighed, rubbing a hand over his mouth. “I guess we just got lucky.” He glanced around. “Where is he now?”
“The whole house.” Cas had laughed at Dean’s awestruck expression.
As soon as she was out of sight, Cas pressed the minuscule button to release the cat’s paw. It meowed in protest, even as it tugged its leg in, trying to protect itself.
“Have you been going up by the playroom?”
Cas stared at him for a long moment, then hummed as he spun to face the mirror on the wall behind him, his lipstick in hand, and started to apply it. It was the dark red one that Dean had always loved. Cas almost never wore makeup anymore; it wasn’t really smiled upon in his line of work. But if he recalled right, seeing him in lipstick had always…
Had he really ditched the entire fucking event, just to avoid Dean?
In turn, no one spoke to him, no one looked at him. Mothers hurried their children from his path as glowering vendors begrudgingly accepted his gold for their wares.
Castiel and Crowley had only walked a few feet further when the rumble of a loud engine pierced through the stillness of the morning air. Castiel and Crowley turned to find a boxy, black car turning the corner behind them. Castiel smiled almost unconsciously as he locked eyes on the driver.
Standing just behind him, a man with kind eyes was smiling as Cas used their clasped hands to tug him forward.
And haunted. So very haunted by what he’d done, by what he was, and he didn’t know if he would ever break free. From his fear, his internal prison. His guilt and shame.
Dean was dressed in a white dress shirt, his sleeves rolled up, exposing his forearms, a red and white striped tie and black slacks, and holding a large cup of coffee in one hand and his messenger bag over his shoulder as he walked up the steps to the high school for the first day of classes.
“You do this often?” he asked.
“I finished it,” Dean said when Castiel showed up two days later. Honestly he’d wanted to come back the very next day, to pick up where he’d left off in the book and to see Dean again, but he didn’t want to make his visits too frequent for fear that he would start to drive the other man crazy. Dean wasn’t used to company after all.
“Marry me.”
, he told himself.
Castiel nodded. “Makes sense,” he said. “I think I’d feel the same way.”
“You can’t . . . you can’t just say stuff like that,” he said softly. And once again he found himself staring into those mesmerizing green eyes.
“Come on, you’re saying your list of favorites doesn’t get longer than ice cream and the color green?” Dean teased.
“Dean?” he said, standing and moving towards the other room. He peaked inside, but there was no sign of Dean.
“Yes, sir,” they said together.
boy, the only boy he’d ever truly wanted. The boy he’d lost before he’d even had him.
“Cas,” Dean breathed, as the other man’s fingers brushed the side of his face. He was trembling. He’d never known this level of affection before. This level of intimacy. Cas wanted to be close to him, to touch him, to look at him, and he couldn’t understand why.
“Anything else?” Dean prodded.
“I brought you some warmer clothes,” Castiel said, holding up the satchel he was carrying. “Anna made them. I hope you don’t mind, but it seemed like you could use them.”
“I’m a bit of a romantic,” he’d admitted to Dean with a blush.
Cas sighed again and climbed into the bed, turning the lamp off and laying down. “You want another blanket?” he asked. “Or I could turn up the heat. You’ll probably get cold down there.”
“You like to read?” Dean asked, standing next to him, and noticing the look of utter contentment on the handsome man’s face as he held the book in his hands like it was the most valuable thing in the world. And it made him immensely happy.
“I uh, I actually came to tell you that I’ll be leaving soon,” Castiel said. “Mrs. Anderson had her baby, so she’ll be back after the holidays.”
“All right,” Castiel said. He set the book back in the trunk and headed for the door.
“I’m proud of you,” he said, and kissed him. “You were the best looking one up there.”
He smiled.
“Genre?”
“Dean,” Cas said, grabbing Dean’s arm and shaking it. “Dean, wake up.”
More crying. This time softer.
“Okay, well, can you think inside where it’s warm? You are going to make yourself sicker out here,” Castiel insisted.
“And I told you I can’t leave while you’re still sick.”
Castiel reached up and stroked Dean’s mangled cheek, even though he knew the other man couldn’t feel it, and Dean’s gaze met his. “You could wear your mask if it makes you feel more comfortable around the children, Dean,” he said. “I would understand. But you don’t have to. I think you’ve learned somehow that you have to hide yourself from people, that they will fear you or be disgusted by you. Was that your father as well?”
Castiel blushed. “Right, yeah, habit, I guess. Would you like to sit?” he gestured to the chair Dean was standing next to.
“Stanford was amazing,” Castiel said with a wide grin. “Not gonna lie, I had my share of sleepless nights and panic attacks over last minute papers and what not, but over all, I loved it. Just graduated last year.”
“Maybe I should,” Castiel agreed. “Have to find someone to go with me though.”
He awoke to the sound of Dean coughing, and the man was shivering, sweat beading his forehead once again.
Anna nodded in understanding. She stayed to make her brother breakfast and then hugged and kissed him and headed out again, saying she would be back tonight just in case Dean’s fever hadn’t broken and she needed to fetch Dr. Singer again.
Castiel ruffled his son's dark hair as he bounced off the bed and followed his father and sister into the kitchen.
The stewardesses came down the aisle for the in flight instructions at that point and then Dean felt himself beginning to get nervous all over again as the plane jostled and started moving faster, preparing for take off. He found himself breathing heavier and gripping the seat rests once again.
“I should pay you,” Castiel said, reaching into a leather pouch tied to his belt.
“Both,” Dean said. “And don’t forget the marshmallows.”
So why was he sick to his stomach? Why did the collar of his shirt feel so tight? Why were his hands shaking when he ran his fingers through his hair? Why did he jump when he heard a knock on the door?
Dean nodded, already starting to lose consciousness again.
Castiel blinked. He wasn’t sure what to think now, or say.
“Was it just me that wished I could take your hand on that airplane to keep you calm?” Cas continued.
Castiel’s chest felt tight. He had knots in his stomach. He knew he needed to do this, but he hated it. He hated that he needed help, especially with something that it seemed like no one else needed help with.
“No, Dean, you’re human,” Cas said, wiping the man’s tears away. “And I can’t promise to solve all of your problems, but I can promise you won’t face them alone. I love you, Dean.”
And for some reason, it seemed, the beautiful blue eyed man liked him.
Castiel smiled. “I’m glad,” he said. “I don’t have another one for you, but I can bring one when I come next time.”
And Dean couldn’t believe how damn adorable he was.
Their third date was a combination of their first and second dates. Since it was getting colder out now they got their coffee and then took it to their secret spot and laid out their blanket to look up at the stars once again, and they sipped on their warm drinks, this time covered in Dean’s extra blanket, which was just barely big enough for both of them, but they were both okay with shuffling a little closer together to make it work.
“Jesus,” he said, putting a hand to his chest and letting out a breath, and the young man chuckled slightly.
"Can you not fight about which one?" Dean asked, looking back and forth between his children.
“Well, first time for everything,” Dean said, and winked at him again.
Meg sighed and handed him the bag across the counter. “You and me both, Clarence,” she said. “Tell your sister I said hi.”
Dean found himself nodding, and lifted his head. He used the sleeve of his coat to wipe off Castiel's shoulder where he’d leaked bodily fluids onto it, and then wiped his eyes. Cas handed him a handkerchief and he used it to wipe his nose.
****************
“Lean into this feeling of lightness, as you continue to breath deeply. Slowly bring your focus back into the physical space around you, holding onto this feeling of freedom and lightness. How good it feels to open up all of this space inside of yourself without the wieight of all that negative energy, slowly wiggling your fingers and your toes, bringing  movement back into the body, and when you’re ready, opening your eyes.”
Dean gave him a lopsided smile. “Okay,” he said. “Where are we going?”
Dean eyed him. “Be honest,” he said.
“You graduation present,” Dean said. “And before you open it I just want to go on record of saying that I had this in mind way before you started begging me and then I had to act like a jerk to throw you off the scent.”
They both nodded again.
“Like how about all the times you leave out the coffee creamer or the jelly, and I have to put it away? I don’t get on your case about that,” Dean said. “Or when I can’t eat chips or popcorn anywhere near you cuz you’ll freak out about the noise? Like just me chewing is a crime against humanity? Or you’ll go on your spending sprees that very nearly get us in the poor house.”
Dean nodded, and Castiel walked away, giving him a small wave before he disappeared.
Castiel blushed and rubbed the back o his neck with his hand. “I, I guess so,” he said.
Dean flushed and was hopeful that somehow Castiel didn’t notice. “Oh,” he said. How the hell was he supposed to do that? Not that he couldn’t find a million and one good things to write about the boy but he just felt like any letter of recommendation from him would be a tad biased. Still, he felt like he owed it to Castiel to be a damn professional about this. What was he going to tell the kid?
And this time, when Dean asked Cas to distract him during their flight, it wasn’t talking that he had in mind.
to handle a dog right now. Or ever.”
“Dean, you have to stop listening to your father,” he said. “He’s poison, do you understand? He’s toxic. I know that’s hard for you to hear, because he is your father and as horribly as he treated you you still loved him. You still craved his approval.  But his approval was not worth having, Dean. He was wrong, Dean. He was wrong. And no matter what mistakes you made or how you messed up, he had no right to treat you that way. He should have been there for you.  He should have loved you. That was his job. And if he was hurting he should have gotten help, not taken it out on you. You deserved better. Your father made his own choices and his happiness was not your responsibility. I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Cas tilted his head in confusion but followed him. He couldn’t help but notice how beautiful the night sky was when one could actually get away from the city and see the stars and enjoy the quiet of the the crickets chirping and the leaves rustling in the trees nearby, and the moon glowing softly over head.
***************
“Later,” Cas said, grinning.
“Cas?” she murmured again, as the rag was pressed to her cheeks, and her neck. And she tried to open her eyes.
************
Dean was exhausted when he got back to Lawrence. And when Lisa slid her arms around his waist at the airport and kissed him he struggled to kiss her back.
“Hello.”
“I’ve got a good immune system,” Cas said, grinning at him.
“Cool, so you need help with math, right?”
And Dean was already starting to tear up when Castiel spoke.
“I uh, I don’t fly very well,” he admitted. “Kind a freaks me out, actually.” He flushed, embarrassed, and half expecting his former student to laugh at him.
He blinked, and looked up into the soft green eyes, and freckle scattered face that he loved so very much.
“Well, lucky for me,” Dean said, and winked at him.
“Castiel, I was beginning to worry about you,” Anna said, when her brother came home. “Where were you?”
“I, uh, I was wondering if you could do me a favor, actually,” Castiel said. “I’m working on applying for colleges, and I was hoping you could write me a letter of recommendation?” He said it as a question rather than a statement.
“No,” he whispered. He looked around frantically in the carriage to find any sign of what might have happened to his sister but there was nothing. And she could be anywhere.
Cas smiled. “I like you a lot, too, Dean,” he said.
know what happened to his face?” Castiel asked, swallowing a lump in his throat. He was shaking even more now.
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been working before he was wiping the sweat from his forehead with his shirt sleeve, and almost as if on cue he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see Anna standing next to him with a glass of water and a piece of freshly baked banana bread.
"I thought I could trust you not to spill," Dean said, grinning back. "Besides that we both know the only reason you eat waffles is for the syrup." He winked at his husband and Castiel gave him a dopey grin.
And the next words out of Dean’s mouth had Cas blushing bright red.
He was so very deeply in love with Cas.
Cas smiled slightly. “There’s nothing to be afraid of, Dean,” he said. “It’s you.”
“Am I on time?” Castiel asked.
One last time.
Dean nodded again and took a deep breath, and let it out.
“It’s your fault,” Dean teased. “You know what these legs do to me.”
“No, it’s uh, it’s fine,” Dean stammered, rubbing the back of his neck. If he wasn’t bi, and Cas wasn’t fucking gorgeous and they were just two normal heterosexual guys sharing a hotel room this wouldn’t be the most incredibly awkward and yet erotic experience of Dean’s life.
“In your unbiased opinion,” Castiel grinned.
He didn’t realize just how exhausted Castiel looked until he finally had the courage to look him in the face. The man’s eyes were blood shot and his shoulders were slumped. He looked like he was barely conscious. And Dean winced again.
Dean frowned, though Castiel couldn’t see it. “You don’t have to be here,” he said, defensively. “I did not ask you to return,” and he went to shut the door, but was surprised when Castiel stepped forward and stopped him, resting his hand against it.
Dean nodded. And he couldn’t help the confused mixture of feelings that washed over him when Cas kissed him on the cheek before walking away and closing the curtain behind him. He was fairly certain he was in love with the beautiful blue eyed man, and that Cas was in love with him, and as much as he wanted it, as much as he had butterflies in his stomach and as much as he’d wanted to continue kissing Cas until his lips were sore and swollen, he also felt incredibly unworthy. Castiel was far too good for him. He could have anyone, and yet he chose the recluse in the woods, the man with half a face, the man with a past he knew nothing about. And he kept coming back. He stayed. And not because of anything Dean had done. He came back for Dean himself.
"No, not that one." Dean shook his head. "Try another."
"Why don't you go?" He suggested, settling into his chair.
Sam obliged, shining the flashlight onto it. They both winced as the light glared off of the shiny gold, but then peered closer at it, properly seeing what they couldn't before.
Cas opened his mouth to speak, but at that second Dean’s phone began to ring insistently in his pocket. He fished it out, glancing at the screen, before it was snatched by Cas. Dean scrabbled for it back, but Cas protested: “You’re driving.”
“We should answer.” Sam said, and all eyes were on him. “Someone might need help.”
"I brought you both back from hell, physically unharmed." Castiel reminded. "If I can only find the vessel, it will work."
Cas stepped forward into Dean’s space, his mouth on Dean’s instantly and pulled their hips together, kissing through Dean’s surprised moan. Cas’s hands stayed on Dean’s hips but
“He’s got a point.” Sam said. “We know Dick’s afraid of us, Charlie said the same.”
“I travel a lot, for work.” He told her, truthfully enough.
"A case." Dean repeated.
"Fine." Sam shrugged.
“Hey, Sammy.” Dean called out.
This should have been over, but when is it ever a simple salt and burn? They’d cremated the remains of Grandma yesterday, but she still showed up the next night, walking the halls and scaring the hell out of little Becky. The family had decided to get out of town for a few days, give Becky a little breather and stay with some friends, so Cas and Sam broke in under the cover of darkness. The family cat wasn’t impressed but Cas had spent some time soothing it, and it now took its place on an armchair placidly with no more complaint.
"Well-"
After a couple of episodes she turned it off and slowly climbed upstairs, crawling into the first bed she could find. It was a double bed, with soft, creamy sheets and beautifully decorated furnishings. She fell asleep almost instantly, and to anyone who would've walked in right then, she looked for all the world like a normal, human woman, aged with stress and unkind years, but softened, calm, peaceful.
“Why weren’t we more prepared?” Dean asked, and Sam sighed.
But Dean was still calling. Dean was yelling for him, was so angry, was so... desperate. For the first time since he had returned, Dean was asking for him, and how could Cas deny him that?
"You consider this a 'class'?"
“Think what?”
Castiel shrugged. "I wasn't feeling well."
Even as he pulled parchments out with specific laws and amendments, he could feel his body begin producing a tiny bit more slick. Hopefully not enough to be scented, but definitely enough for Dean to realize what was happening. God, he hoped this conversation was headed where he thought it was headed. Dean was giving Castiel the perfect deal: he could still help Anael, even while choosing Dean.
Dean jerked his head back to the party. “You’re missing all the fun.”
“And you were acting all huffy that I’d gone,” he teased.
And then, at breakfast one morning, the heavy front door of the bunker exploded in a cacophony of wood and broken sigils.
Castiel's eyes widened as they stepped into the large, airy kitchen. A glance at the stove confirmed that the delicious scent was coming from a large pot that boiled on the back burner. A variety of utensils and ingredients littered the counters, along with many modern appliances. Portraits and memos and grade reports graced the refrigerator front.
Balth snorted out a laugh. “Sure, we’ll call it that, if you want.”
She’d also join Cas and his friends for lunch, with Sam tagging along, or Cas would come join them at their table. It was so easy to slip into friendship with him, because he was such a good soul who, even with this sarcasm and sharp wit, brought non-stop laughter to their lunches.
Suddenly, warm arms slid around him from behind. Cas flinched, already panicking about losing control over his power, but rather than break off, his blue light flared, steadied. There was no more wavering, no more uncertainty.
Castiel started tugging him toward the couch, flushing as the boy's eyes traced over his bare torso. Castiel had forgone clothes, opting to remain in his red panties to open the door. He figured it would save them some unnecessary time later.
Dean spun to finally look at him. “Leaving again. Just like that? Not even going to stick around, maybe help deal with the backlash we’ll get from this mission?
Dean huffed out a sigh. "Cas, sweetheart...please..."
"Yes, you should've waited," Castiel agreed simply, not offering any more. Dean sighed, squeezing his hand tightly.
. He was one of the best goddamned detectives on an international task force. He was better now; he’d made it through the pain, and he was a stronger person for it. He wasn’t going to give that up just because Dean popped back up and batted his pretty green eyes.
Dean glanced away for a moment before turning back to him. “How about tonight?”
All three men shared knowing smiles, condescending in their righteousness. Dean wanted to kick all of their asses.
"So big!" Castiel panted as he rocked his hips gently, his walls tightening around Dean's shaft. "You stretch me so nice."
But for some reason, that didn’t feel nearly as good as he’d thought it would. Instead, he just felt…empty, like he always had since Dean hopped out that bathroom window into the pouring rain. He’d thought that maybe catching Dean would help fill that emptiness. It hadn’t.
“The power in the blade, it…”
Sam spoke up. “As fascinating as this all is, can we get the hell out of these damn ruins? I feel like they’re about to crash in.” He turned to mutter to Benny, “Especially after all that lights and explosions bullshit.”
He suddenly remembered the markers in his bag for art class. He crawled over and dug them out, finding the darkest color he had before coloring over the words. As they disappeared, he felt a piece of himself go with them. Gone was the wide eyed pretty plaything that Victor had left for someone else to pick up. No one would miss him away.
. So, so sorry.”
Meg stood stiffly, her entire frame radiating anger. Even in her anger, though, she knew to hold herself in check. She gritted out, “You know, I’ve just remembered another engagement. If you’ll excuse me.”
So when Cas had realized the truth about Dean, his unassuming mechanic from the States, it had hurt…it had hurt so much. But not nearly as much when Dean had left without a word. He’d hopped out of a bathroom window, leaving nothing but a worn-down pair of boots and a few toiletries behind. And now Cas was left with nothing but the memories, beautiful smoky memories that danced around Cas’s periphery, taunting him.
“I know,” Castiel interrupted, his smile reassuring as he reached up to pet a hand through Dean’s hair. “I know. And it'll still take time, for both of us, but I think we're both invested enough to make this work, right?”
"If you really wanna touch me, all you gotta do is ask. No need to go knocking me off my feet," he teased. Gordon just glared at him. "Just keep the offer in mind, big guy."
Dean’s smile turned bitter, and he hesitated only a moment before shaking his head. “I think this was my last go around, Sir. The things I had to do for this mission...I can’t go through that again, and I wouldn’t ever want to order another person to do the same.”
“Inside, before Ash came through, you said you
"I'm ditching class to let you fuck me over a bathroom counter in broad daylight, where anyone could walk in. If that's not a slut, I don't know what is."
“Dean,” Garth’s voice pulled his attention back. “I think... I think the bonding took for him.”
Sam burst out into a loud guffaw as Jo flipped him off, but she wore her own smile.
“I’m not ready...”
“Ach! They are getting better at recognizing my work,” Ana muttered. “We are out of time.” Suddenly, a brown sack was cradled in her arms where nothing had been before. “Take it and go. Keep it hidden, keep it safe.”
“Okay,” Sam said. “So you should probably talk about that.”
“They’re not excuses,” Cas tried weakly, even as his free hand finally slipped around Dean’s back to brush along his bare skin. “You really are...you’re so bright, and beautiful and you’re…you’re...”
“That’s Gordon. He’s kind of a dick.”
Castiel smiled fully, a soft curve to his mouth that was ten times better than the little quirks Dean had seen thus far. “Of course, Dean.”
“Right,” Cas’s voice was dry. “Sorry, I must have forgotten to stop by the corner store and pick up a $7 bottle of Barefoot.”
“Yeah,” Dean’s good mood faltered. “What happened here?”
At Castiel’s flat look, she sighed heavily. “I know, my boy, I don’t have to tell you. You are the expert, after all.”
“I don’t know,” he whispered hoarsely. “I didn’t even wait for him to wake up, I just ran.”
Dean strolled back into the compound, whistling merrily as he nodded at different people he passed. It had been a damn successful trip, and now they had rations to last them a long while.
That evening, when the cat came to his door, it had the promised key tied to a string around its neck.
admitting to having other partners, while Cas had really believed they’d had something special. That knot in his chest tightened even further, and Cas had to look away. He couldn’t meet Dean’s gaze right now, not when he could feel the tears brimming. Now he just had to figure out how he was going to escape without letting slip how fuckin’ stupid he’d been.
“Cas,” he murmured.
Castiel kept his gaze firmly on his plate, refusing the temptation to lift his eyes towards that back corner again. No more mistakes, not today. No matter how very appealing they may be.
“You coming to bed?“
“Oh, doesn’t he look so young!” She smiled down at the picture for a moment before spinning on her heel. “Come, let us gather your friends. We will go retrieve Castiel together.”
Dean blushed. “I didn’t think touching was allowed…”
Dean frowned. "Cas, she...she's gone, okay? Done for. I only slept with her because I thought...I got jealous, okay?"
“When I was much younger, when I fell in love for the very first time... I can still remember what it felt like, being wrapped up in him so completely. I felt loved, protected. This...” she looked back at the painting, “somehow this is exactly what it felt like.”
One day during their walk, the cat bounded down a side path that was so narrow and dark, it could hardly be qualified as a
He'd been shocked when Crowley called him the first time three years ago. He was the school bully, cruel to everyone, with enough dirt on them to keep anyone from doing anything about it. But when he got Castiel into bed, things were different. He wasn't gentle by any means, but he made sure he didn't hurt him either.
She looked to Castiel, her gaze imploring. "I didn't mean to. I was trying to help. It wasn't until years after he left, when I finally forgave him, that I realized I shouldn't have judged him so harshly or tried to change him. So I determined that, no matter what, I would allow my children to be who they were, even if I didn't totally agree with it." She smiled gently. "I couldn't bear to lose you, too. So when I realized that you were homosexual, I reminded myself that I wasn't going to change you. But I still couldn't quite bring myself to...you know..."
Victor froze for one long second, then another. Finally he scoffed. “There’s nothing on that drive that can connect back to me.” His smile was slow, exultant. “You can’t prove shit.”
this is” way.
Dean felt the hope die within him. He’d been so sure…
Unaware of Castiel's heart-shattering epiphany, Lucifer continued. “But that agent wasn’t the primary target, so we ducked out real quick before anyone showed up.”
Yes, the hordes had been bad before, but now they seemed...hungrier.
“I told him I’d wait for him here,” Dean said.
Dean smiled enthusiastically, but there was apprehension in his gaze as well as he asked, “So?”
"What if she is a serial killer? Then there won't be an after," Castiel argued. Dean made an assenting sound, but nothing more than that. He'd been just as put out by the interruption as Castiel had.
And then Dean's mouth was covering his.
A flash of blue light exploded through the room, and then all was dark and quiet again. The old god with its gaping maw and bloody gaze was gone.
Dean arched a brow. “You? Won’t he recognize you from the party? You know, the one where you
Victor grimaced. “I know, I wouldn’t have tried ripping it open without you here, but Gordon...”
Dean’s head suddenly popped back up. “Is he going to that party? The big one at...I can’t remember his name.”
"I wanna see you," Dean whispered. Castiel smirked and tugged his shirt over his head, exposing his smooth chest, and tossed it away. He stood and undid his belt and jeans, slowly pushing them down his legs. Dean groaned when he caught sight of the little green panties Castiel wore.
Nope, Dean Winchester did not do relationships. I had a good thing going with dealing: getting paid and getting laid from both teams.
I was feeling pretty damn smug about the whole thing, sure that I’d ended up with the upper hand.
And, in my mind, that meant keeping the upper hand for sex. Yeah...upper hand, my
“Came from that house,” he drawled.
Castiel smiled grimly, “Just because you can pretend that he doesn’t exist, that does not mean I have to.”
"Because Gabriel is four years younger than Michael and their quizzes were almost exactly the same."
“Wondered what?”
“My lord,” Winchester interrupted. “It’s a forest, it’s open to anyone.” He took a step forward, but still the entire clearing separated them. “Please, continue with your sketches. I’d just like to tend to the flowers, so long as I’m not in your way.”
Castiel shifted Kaiden from one hip to the other and smiled ruefully. “It’s what I’m used to, and if I keep busy...”
“Voyeurism,” Cas muttered as he caught his breath after. “Never would’ve guessed you were so kinky, babe.”
Dean swung his legs over the side of the bed. “Where is he?”
“But I thought,” Dean started, confused. “I thought she tried to run away with you? When you spoke of that last night, it seemed...”
speak. He’d been told that this man was long dead, but somehow Castiel knew. He just
“In a way,” Ana responded. “It is based off of this forest.”
“I’m done with this coward,” he snarled, staring up at the cloud high in the sky where the wizard perched. “No more distractions.” He looked back at Dean. “Go help the others.”
The orb began to rise slowly toward the opening. Cas stepped forward, breaking free of Dean’s hold to keep his focus on the beam from beneath and guide it through. Dean almost expected the portal to snap shut once the orb had passed into the world above. Instead it remained open, allowing Cas to maintain his connection with his chanting.
“The first time, or...?”
Castiel was so caught up with the newness of being with Dean that he didn't notice it at first. He didn't realize what was happening until he'd said
In class, she moved to sit next to Cas, and through him, Ruby on his other side. At first she was a little upset with the dark-haired girl, but after hearing the whole story from Ruby’s perspective, she realized that Ruby had just been trying to protect her friend. She found that she got along with Ruby so well, they decided to team up for their big project in Forensics the next semester.
"Deal," Dean replied, meeting his hand in the middle.
“Yeah,” Luci admitted.
“Where are you going?” Sam called, tailing after him uncertainly.
Cas chuckled. “Kind of real.”
He could feel the anxiety radiating off Anael, his younger sister, as the camera zoomed in on the doorway where a tall, smiling man stepped through and waved. Even just watching, one could see the alpha in him, confident and strong and absolutely giant.
"I see," Crowley said. "Are you actually interested in him or just what's written on a bathroom wall?"
Castiel had to get the attention away from himself. He had to turn this around on Dean. He arched an eyebrow. "I'm sorry, but I didn't realize the guy who actually texted the number on the bathroom stall gets to pass moral judgment on the whore. Tell me, Dean, do
“Come on,” I said. “Let’s get somewhere quiet.”
"Crowley would never throw himself under the bus," Gordon tried, but Castiel just laughed harder.
Cas felt his stomach drop.
“I’m sure your judgment will be best in this matter, Monsieur Winchester,” Cas replied hoarsely. He pulled his gaze away, reached across the counter to drop his gold into the baker’s waiting palm, and grabbed the loaves in return.
“Of course!” Jess cried. “I couldn’t stand seeing you so sad, not when you’ve been so happy recently.”
“Ready for this, Lover?” he breathed as the head caught on the rim. And then he was pushing down, taking Dean inch by inch, moaning like he was made for this. Dean could only watch him, watch his beautiful face scrunched up, the light sheen of sweat breaking out on his brow, the way his mouth fell open as he pushed himself down further.
Now, he was elbows-deep in an old disagreement between two families long extinct. No one would benefit from this research, but it kept his mind busy enough to ignore the thrumming pain in his chest, the swirling thoughts in his mind, the irritating flare in his belly.
“When you gotta be home?” I asked between kisses.
only a couple more days. Only a couple more days and Dean would be going home, leaving Castiel
Castiel’s eyebrows drew together as he unfolded the rich paper, but his confusion didn't last long. His eyes widened when he saw the seal on the letterhead.
His name was Dean Smith, and he was an investment banker. He’d just moved to California for work, but he missed his old life back in Kansas. He still needed to transfer his gym membership, he preferred Vonnegut to Brautigan, and he’d take a plain old beer any day.
But Cas had done it. He’d arrested almost all of them. The only ones who hadn’t gotten nabbed were Garth, Ash, and Charlie. Or, at least, Dean assumed that they didn’t have Charlie. He’d seen them escorting Jo to the women’s holding cell, but Charlie hadn’t been with her.
.” His hand came up to cup Cas’s cheek as he pleaded, “Come back with me, give me another chance. I can’t promise that I’ll be perfect, but I’ll sure as hell be yours, if you let me.”
Castiel nodded in agreement as she disparaged over the young waiter who “actually offered me a Gewürztraminer for my pairing. A Gewürztraminer!” but even as his head nodded, his eyes flitted over to the corner table.
“I feel that I should be the starstruck one,” Arthur teased. “A real-live prince fangirling over me? And you can call me Ketch.”
"Oh, little whore, I'm nowhere near done with you yet."
“Long enough,” Castiel responded. He took one step forward, then another, while Dean stood stock still, caught in the headlights.
Castiel laughed and gave him a gentle push away. “And the fragile male ego once again rears its ugly head!”
Cas stood then helped Dean up. They looked around at the mess of clothes and spilled decorations, glanced at each other.
The door to the arboretum creaked open, and Dean called out a bright “Good morning!” to whoever had just entered. Hopefully it was Sammy with some breakfast; he hadn’t eaten yet.
“And hungry, from the looks of it,” Gabe said, his tone nothing short of lascivious.
“Of course!” Castiel frowned. “Why wouldn’t they?”
“Let’s run through things again,” Sam called, his voice full-Alpha, yanking Dean’s attention back. He and Hannah joined Sam at the table. They hadn’t brought the entire team, since it was fewer-the-better on stealth missions like this. In the front, Meg handed off the controls to the auto-pilot then walked back to the round table where the others watched Sam pull up a holographic map from the center of the table.
Dean wasn’t sure if the sword would hurt Cas or not, but he wasn’t going to risk it.  He ran from his spot to intercept.  He met the spirit before it could reach Cas.  As he stepped into its path the spirit seemed to notice him for the first time.  It drew up short and readied the sword.
Raphael looked at Jack and then flicked his eyes back to Dean.  “He’s fine.”
“Your man will be fine,” she explained.  “Though, he might be a bit twitchy after this.  I came as soon as I heard my daughter was returned home.  Mine too.”
Bobby had told him stories about the creatures.  They lived in the deepest and coldest lakes.  They drown the unwary and than feasted on their corpses.  Any water that had a drowning usually was claimed to house a kelpie.  It was easier to blame the monster than accept that your idiot brother went swimming drunk.  Dean wasn’t sure if Bobby had been trying to warn him about the dangers of water monsters, or just to not be stupid around water.
“Seriously Dean,” Cas said.  “I didn’t see her at the party.  She’s lying.”
“Don’t corrupt my brother.”
“You’re smarter than this Sam,” Billie sighed.  “I’ll assume it’s the beer muddling your brain.  Death creates a divide in your life.  On one side you have your loved one and on the other you have the rest of your life without that person.  Castiel had a choice.  Stay on this side of that divide and live for eternity without Dean.  Or go back and live on the other side with the knowledge that one day he would be able to get to be with Dean again.”
Cas blinked at him.  “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
The man briefly paused to take a breath.  His wife began her irritating laugh and stopped part way through.  The man coughed and his eyes bulged a little.  His wife grabbed his arm and began taking a step backward.  Castiel was about to ask what was wrong when he heard his brother.
Castiel smiled.  “And I was right.  My life changed forever.  And despite being stabbed on our first meeting we’ve done fairly well for ourselves.”
The gate to his world lay tantalizingly close.  He could sense it just above his head.  He needed to get back through it before it closed.  He knew some spells that would be useful in this situation, but he needed air to cast them.  He could fight these weeds and whatever else lurked down here.  He just needed to get to the surface first.
Sam met them at the hospital and the three men got Dean checked in.  Sam stepped out when Dean had to change.
“I am sorry I wasn’t here last year,” he apologized.  “I was on a quest.  Well, healing as part of the quest really.  But I succeeded.  Saved the princess and won the king’s approval.  Got Sammy a chance for a real education.  Better than anything I could have provided on my own.”
The morning after the tube came out Luke started spending more of the time they were both awake in the library.  Dean took this as a good sign.  He didn’t mind the extra alone time with Cas, but it probably meant that Luke was comfortable enough with Cas’ progress that he felt he didn’t need to be hovering all the time.
“He’ll be okay,” Gabriel told Jack.
“Eventually,” Castiel said.  “It’ll take some time.”
“Yeah, Hallmark doesn’t exactly have a card for this.”  The other Dean stood and shook Dean’s hand.  “If you really think Cas deserves better.  Be better.  Be the better man and don’t chicken out.  Tell him everything.  He’s worth it.”
“At what cost though?”
Cas had found the hunt the day after Crowley flounced off with Sam.  He told Dean it would give them something to do until Sam returned and it was only a few hours from the bunker.  Dean didn’t bring it up, but he suspected the angel was also trying to replace the pie Crowley had stolen.  Or at least get Dean to stop whining about the theft.  The pie after this hunt was going to be all the sweeter.
The tracker walked carefully around Jess’s body.  He touched the soil around her and inspected the bushes.
The wagon he’d almost rode into was the type that would double as a home and a place of business.  Its wooden awning was up and underneath it was a table with two empty chairs.  An older woman sat behind the table and watched them.  Her curly hair was cropped close to her head.  Her clothes were simple, neat and impeccably clean.
Castiel wasn’t sure how long he could keep the barrier up.  It had been a lot easier to keep the flames away because they didn’t have any real physical force.  Blocking the full force of an angry dragon’s blows was another matter entirely.  He could probably keep the dragon off of Dean for only one or two more attacks.  Fortunately, the knight had taken advantage of the reprieve and was almost back on his feet.
They sat in silence for a little bit.  It wasn’t uncomfortable.  It was like they were on the road again.  Castiel found himself missing that peace.  He almost brought up to Dean, but there was another knock at the door.  This one was firmer and more insistent.
“Fine, but if you hurt her anymore than she already is.” She left it hanging and helped Dean pick Gilda up.  Charlene spoke soothingly to the horses and took their reins.  She led them through the portal with Dean following close behind.  Cas came immediately afterward.
Dean shook his head and tried to ignore the next few acorns and screams from the branches above.  The squirrel had surprising aim and pelted them both for almost
“To what do I owe this pleasure brother?  Upright, clean and talkative before the sun has fallen to evening.”
“Good enough,” Dean sighed.  “What does this thing look like?”
“Heya Dean.  What can I do you for?” Donna always sounded perky on the phone.
“I can lie all I want,” Castiel said.  “But I don’t make promises lightly.  I have to follow through with them or bad things happen.”
Castiel was pleased that Dean was recovering so quickly.  Raphael had not painted a bright picture for someone suffering from manticore venom.  It was almost always a death sentence and an unpleasant one at that.  Now that Dean had woken free of confusion, Raphael had assured him that it was only a matter of time before full recovery.  The venom was neutralized, but its effects would linger.  The knight would be weak, but if he followed medical orders he would be back on his feet shortly.  He didn’t mention it specifically, but Castiel thought that his brother was referring to Dean’s ill-fated attempt to walk.
Castiel looked up and saw his very naked son crawling across the ceiling.  He blinked.  He blinked again.  And then he said the first thing that came to mind.
“Go first one.”
The next morning Dean got up early.  Cas was still sleeping and he didn’t want to wake the wizard.  Partially because he felt that Cas needed the rest, and partially because he didn’t want to deal with grumpy Cas right now.  He gathered up the items he’d pulled from his pack the night before and set off to where Benjamin had indicated his armour was.
Gabe smirked and adjusted his cloak.  The grey fabric seemed to swirl as if it were made of dark smoke.  It contrasted sharply with Castiel’s own pale tan coat.  “I know I know.  And I know you know that I know.”
DEAN: They are.  I really need your help on this.  I can’t decide.
********
Castiel’s head was pounding and his entire being was wracked with pain.  The ropes kept him bound inside the circle.  He blinked the blood from his eyes and could make out the dimly glowing symbols painted along the rope.  They were enchanted against angels.  He wouldn’t be able to break them.  And even if he could that circle kept him pinned inside.  He pushed against the pain and looked around.  He was in a room without windows and only one door.  There wasn’t anyone or anything else in the room with him.
“There’s a bookstore opening in town today.”
“I hope you will be as pleased with my work as I am,” the dwarf pointed to one of the tables.
The kelpie bucked and threw him off.  Dean landed in the mud and rolled to avoid the attack he expected.
“Well,” Cas said as he started to blush.  “Most of them where about what was going on in this general area,” he waved a hand vaguely over his groin.  “I certainly wasn’t going to my parents about that.  I thought about Gabe but wasn’t sure he’d give me the right answers.  In the end I snuck into Raphael’s room and stole some of his anatomy books.”
********
Sam reached out and grabbed her arm.  “What do you mean I’m ‘ so close’.”
“Faeries draw their power from the forest,” Rowena told them.
Cas blushed and rubbed at his neck.  “You saved mine first.  The manticore would have killed me if you hadn’t leapt in front of it.  Which was stupid by the way.”
“I have advantages that no one else in this room has,” Crowley smirked.  “Especially when it comes to the question at hand.  Before climbing the corporate ladder, I began my career as a crossroads demon.  Bartering and trading.  I’ve never forgotten those lessons.  I can look at you and know what your inner most desires are.  Sex, money, power. Initially Dean wanted many of the usual things.  But when I met Castiel.  Well, Feathers had more specific things in mind.  Flannel for one thing.
“We haven’t seen anything this side,” Castiel told him.  “Might be better spots on the other side.  It shouldn’t take all that long to cross us over.”
The creature placed the sack down and opened it.  It reached inside and rummaged around for a moment before pulling out a slender volume that it held out to Castiel.  He knew it was a grimoire, but it looked like it should contain poetry instead of spells.  He accepted the book, being careful not to make contact with the creature’s skin.  He wasn’t sure what type of demon it was, but it was definitely demonic.
The sky abruptly darkened.  Black clouds rolled across the sky.  There was a clap of thunder and a bolt of lightening snaked down to strike the ground near the orchard.  The lightening flung dirt and other debris into the air.  When it cleared he could see a tall man striding away from the trees.  His cloak flared around him and for a moment Dean thought he had wings.  In his right hand he carried a huge spear.  The tip was glowing a brilliant blue.  The man pointed the spear as he walked.
“Or we could go with you and get answers.”
“Cas?”
“He’s your what now?”
Castiel leaned in and kissed Dean.  They stayed like that for a moment before he pulled back.
“No.”  Cas’s laughter stopped and his lips twisted in distaste.  “I have more than one brother.  It was my second eldest brother who did it.  Father was not pleased.”
“And here I thought you were supposed to be the smart Winchester brother.”
“Yeah, it does.”  Dean freshened his own coffee.  “I’m grateful for what you’ve done already for him, but I didn’t think nurses could do everything you were doing.”
Cas smiled that smile.  “Dean.  Would you marry me?”
********
“Can I help you?” Castiel asked.
Dean hung up as he got out of the Impala.  Greg’s car was gone.  The front door to the house opened as he walked toward the studio.  A small blonde woman stepped out.  At first glance she looked to be in her late thirties.  She stared at him for a moment.
“What was that about?” Dean asked.  “Why did you tell him to leave?”
Castiel couldn’t cast a spell as powerful as teleportation and was stuck walking.  Even if he could, he didn’t know where he was going and the spell would likely fail.  Or put them hundreds of miles from where they wanted to go.  Or at the bottom of the sea.  He sighed and glanced over at Dean.  The knight’s calm demeanor made him want to shake the man until he reacted to the boredom that he should rightfully feel.
It was too much.  This weapon had to be worth more than his remaining estate.  Possibly more than all the Winchester lands before his father lost them.  He couldn’t accept it.
Getting out of his blankets took more effort than he’d have liked.  He was tired.  Both physically and emotionally.  Manifesting his staff had taken a lot out of him and it would take time to recover. The spell he’d cast also took its toll.  On top of that was the emotional rollercoaster of dealing with his brother.  He needed another nap and he just got up.
“That’s better,” the woman said.  “A daughter of the Court shouldn’t let herself be seen so….poorly.”
“Now, is that enough to prove my credentials to send you out on a quest?”
“I feel like I could sleep for a week,” Castiel said.  He accepted the pear that Dean handed him.  It was perfectly ripe.  Not too soft, but not to hard either.
“I found him.”  Michael’s voice sounded in his mind.  “He looks rough.  I don’t know how he’s still alive.”
“Cas isn’t my boyfriend.  We’re just friends.”
“I’ve dealt with goblins before,” Dean said.  “They bleed like everything else.  A few good men should cut through them.”
“I think so,” Castiel said.  “I think that was the ‘they’re to busy to bother the living’ thing Rowena mentioned.”
Raphael gave Jack a quick glance over and assured them that the baby was fine despite having been out in the rain.  Castiel breathed a sigh of relief, he hadn’t even been aware that he was worried about Jack get sick.
“What is happening?”
Sam repeated it more clearly.
“I think the teacher might object.”
“It’s more than tradition,” she explained.  “It’s an enchantment built right into the walls.  The tutors won’t teach anyone who isn’t family.”
“What do you think she meant about the dragon?”  Dean asked.
The Queen of the fairies had been given quarters that were even more lavish than the ones Castiel had been given.  He wasn’t surprised at that, she was of higher rank than he was.  It was just surprising that the quarters existed at all.  More rooms, larger sitting areas and a balcony that overlooked the courtyard.  There were also a half dozen servants buzzing around.  Gilda sat off to one side.  The blonde fairy, Claire Castiel thought, was standing behind her.  The older fairy was near the queen.
“Hey, watch the name dropping.”  Gabe looked around quickly and muttered a few words under his breath.  The sound of the bustling crowd around them faded.
“Not quite perfect,” the dwarf said.  “But no mortal could create that ring.  While he wears that ring, you will always be with your beloved.  So long as your heart beats in your chest your beloved will feel it.  You will be with him wherever he goes.”
The angel didn’t follow him into the library. He walked through the stacks and pulled a bottle of whiskey from behind a book on the mating habits of ghouls.  He’d stumbled across it a few weeks back while researching for a hunt.  The Men of Letters had booze stashed all over the place.  He snagged a glass off the table on his way to his room.
Seeing something done and doing it yourself was very different.  Michael had said that shaping his staff was more of an act of will than casting a spell.  Castiel hoped it was that simple.  He built a picture of a shield in his mind, basing it off the shield Dean had worn at the tourney.  Then he forced his will into his staff and tried to make it change.
Cas’ bleeding stopped.
The sound of water grew louder and he found his way into a room off the main hall.  It was just as big as the main hall except instead of plain pillars it had pillars carved with people.  Big people.  Way bigger than he was, like almost ten feet tall.  They looked pretty though.  He guessed they were elves. Nobles.  All men on one side and all women on the other side.  Dressed in finery and holding weapons.  Dean thought it was odd for statues to be have their hands on sheathed weapons, but they were elves, so maybe this was normal.  He should ask Cas about that.  Cas would know, he knew stuff and he was just great.
He had finished saddling Baby by the time Cas was waking up.  It had taken him very little time to realize that Cas’ pleasantness as a companion was directly proportionate to how high the sun was in the sky.  Dawn was a bad time to be near the man.  He got more tolerable the closer they got to noon.  By midday the wizard was human again and it was safe to talk to him.  Even the birds avoided him first thing in the morning.
“Oh, I’m not leaving,” Gabe told him.  “The king has offered me a job and I’ve taken it.”
Dean barely heard the question.  “He’s an angel.”
CHARLIE: Come on Dean.
Ducking back inside he looked around again.  The other doorway was the only other way out of the room.  He ran over to it and looked inside.  There was a long hallway that lead further into the mountain.  The end of the hallway was obscured in the dark.  He didn’t have time to wander the halls of the village hoping to find a passage that would lead him over to Dean.
To the man’s credit only the colour drained from his face, but didn’t back away.  “You must mean the LADY Gilda.  You can understand my confusion.  We use proper titles here.”
“Welcome home my daughter.”
He felt at peace.  Zachariah was dead.  His family was safe.  He wouldn’t see them again, he knew it, but they were safe.
They moved quickly through the halls.  Dean nodded to several of the guards he saw along the way.  The first one confirmed that Charlie and Gilda had finished court and would likely be out on the terrace.  No one else tried to stop them.
wasn’t used to holding one.  “Of Cas.”
“I have someone for you to meet,” Dean said proudly.  He unwrapped the bundle in his arms.  “Meet your grandson, Jack.”
Two figure leapt over her prone figure and advanced into the room.  Time seemed to slow for Dean as a young woman threw herself at him.  He managed to get a shot off before she knocked him to the ground.  Her claws made short work of his shirt and left deep gouges in his chest.  They struggled on the floor until she was pulled away.  Cas was there.  He hurled the werewolf from Dean.  She slammed into a wall and fell to the floor.  The angel advanced on her with his blade drawn.
She sighed in annoyance.  “I doesn’t work that way.  I do this then I go see my granddaughter.”
Time passes.  Healing and realizations occur.
“It’s been a pretty good story so far, hasn’t it?”
He felt the magic ripple away from him and disappear into the trees.
This one rambles a bit, but it does get there in the end.  The next chapter should be a bit more eventful.
It was early afternoon by the time that Dean returned to camp.  He’d taken his time coming back.  If asked he’d have said it was because there were large chunks of dirt that needed to be removed.  There was no point in lugging dirt back to camp just to knock it off there.  To himself he knew it was because he didn’t want to have to spend time with Cas being quiet again and shutting him out.  It was a childish way to think, but it was still there.  He liked Cas a lot and he didn’t know what was going to happen next, but he wanted to find out.  And finding out meant trying to get Cas to talk to him.
His son was glued to his side.  Jack had always wanted to be close to people, in particular his parents, but the boy had refused to let Castiel go anywhere without him.  Not that Castiel was complaining about that.  The two had been practically glued together since he had woken a few hours before.
He hadn’t been graceful when he pitched himself backward to avoid the flames.  He was glad that no one was around to see him fall on his ass like that.  He didn’t care what most people thought of him, but embarrassing was still embarrassing.  He stood and brushed the dust off his coat as best he could.
“It’s a start,” Dean said.  “Any idea where this Bender might be?”
“Mr Novak?”
“You’re safe, you’re not my type either,” Luke assured him.  “What I’m trying to say is that you deserve to be happy.  And maybe you could be the reason someone else is happy.”  He cocked his head to one side listening.  “Your not-boyfriend is coming so I’ll wrap this up.  Don’t fuck this up.  You deserve to be happy.  Now I’m going to liberate the beer from your fridge and process what the hell has happened to me the last little while”
“The wealthy rarely care for what the peasantry gets up to,” Rowena said.  “So long as we pay our taxes and don’t revolt we aren’t even worth notice.”
“Now,” the king said.  “What happened?  Perhaps you should start.”
“Cas loved Dean like a brother,” Sam said.
Rowena relinquished her charge and waited until they were both sitting again.  “You’re responsible for getting him back.  No more than an hour out here.”  She turned and walked back inside.
“Me too,” Dean said.  “I know we didn’t know what was going on, but I still feel bad about hurting her.  I really did a number on her.”
He also remembered the moment when he finally took the plunge and admitted his feelings.  A story he definitely wasn’t sharing with this crowd.
Once they were both in dry clothes, Cas helped Dean manhandle two fallen logs closer to the fire.  They draped their clothes on one to dry and sat on the other.  Dean wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and opened the side for Cas sit next to him if he wanted.  Dean was happy that the man did settle under the blanket with him.
“He abandoned our father to die while he went and danced with demons.  I will not forgive him for that.”
“I offer you to yield again Sir,” the other knight said.
“Pretty sure it’s Cas’ older brother.”
The wizard blinked out of sight.  Dean was disappointed.  There was no smoke, no ravens flying away, no gouts of flame.  Just empty air where the wizard had stood.
He found the whiskey behind the second cupboard.  Dean could never hide the good stuff.  He poured himself two fingers and knocked it back.  He wasn’t ready to deal with this.  He poured another two and set the bottle aside.
Gilda’s recovery advanced faster than Dean’s.  When he asked Rowena about it she laughed.
“You need a healer.”
Dean laughed.  “I think I’ll stick with the ones I have now.  Wouldn’t want to upset them.”  He traced the symbols with his finger.  “What do these mean?”
Castiel did his best to ignore the anger of his brother speaking of their father.  He had no right to mention their father after he abandoned him.  But bringing that up wouldn’t be productive right now.
“All Bobby’s doing,” Dean said.  “He did most of the day to day stuff when my father was still alive, and taught me what I know about it.  But he’s the one that keeps everything going.”
Dean drew his sword and dove into the water.
“Okay, so what causes aphagia,” Dean drew the word out to irritate his brother.
Sam slowly pulled his hand back.  "How many times?"
“Sorry, I zoned out there,” Dean apologized.  “What did you say?”
“What is that stuff?” Dean asked.  “It smells awful.”
Dean let the topic of his friend’s dating life slide.  “Sure.  Grab food after?”
“Officially the king, but it was Lady Gilda’s suggestion.  She’s Princess Charlene’s lady in waiting.  The king takes her suggestions seriously.”
***********
Dean stalked up to it and grabbed the end of the cord and yanked the creature forward.  “Leave,” he hissed at it.  “Leave and never come back here.”
“It has been far too long Lucifer.  We used to talk all the time.”  Asmodeus picked an invisible thread off a coat sleeve.  “What brings you to call on a friend?”
Michael was there before Dean could take more than a step toward the nearest ogre.  He raised his staff and a bolt of lightning arced from the spear tip.  The creature howled in pain and clutched at the burn left up its side.
Dean just nodded and stared at all the blood.
“Hey,” he said.  “I don’t know what happened, but I’m pretty sure you saved my life.  Thanks.”
“I think we’ll be good.”
The other knight led Dean to the healer’s tent and only left him when he was sitting down inside with one of the sisters that staffed the tent coming over to see him.
“No cost he wasn’t willing to pay,” Lucifer said.  “Besides, it worked.  The soul of your friend was laid to rest.”
There was a brief knock at the door and Bobby walked in.  The man had never waited more than a brief second after knocking.  It had created some embarrassing situations when Dean was growing up.  Embarrassing for Dean, Bobby never seemed bothered by it.
Cas placed the bowl over a candle and let go.  The bowl remained suspended over the flame.  A moment later thick smoke began to rise up from the bowl.  By the time it did Cas was already placing another bowl.  Once all the bowls were placed it became difficult to see Cas’ form clearly. He could smell the smoke from where he was standing and it wasn’t pleasant.  It was acrid, but was the perfect aroma for the chanting.  It smelt like the words felt inside Dean’s head.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Ana told me that this was more real for you than reality itself.”
“And as long as those dead keep popping up,” Dean added, “we’re never going to get close to this bastard.”
Now, he would have this one too. He was too good not to. All he had to do was be patient.
“Of course he was!” Gabe burst out, but his voice was farther than before, like Cas had moved away from him. “You would’ve solidified the alliance between them!”
"Why do you care so much whether or not I think I'm a slut?" Castiel rebutted.
The old woman smiled even amidst her final, shallow breaths. “My dove.”
“They
Castiel nodded and Naomi kissed his forehead.
“I think I’d remember if I’ve ever seen anything like that.”
“On?”
Castiel shook his head. “I’m very good at blending in.” And then, while they both watched, his face shifted—more like morphed—into a replica of Meg’s.
Always direct, straightforward as ever, he spoke bluntly.
What really bothered Dean, though, was the fact that the alpha gene had been discovered by scientists working with the old Men of Letters. They’d been trying to recreate the “god gene” held by Dean’s own grandfather Henry, the gene that enabled his line to host archangels. Basically, society had been further divided, more effectively than ever before, in their attempt to replicate the curse that flowed through Dean’s veins.
“But a beautiful memory…”
"Hey, slut," he said, leaning too close. "Wanna meet me in the bathroom later?"
“That’s why he was able to defeat Kazimir so easily,” he realized, remembering how Cas had fought and won that day. He’d wondered why Cas had let Dean stay with him, essentially hinder him. Now he knew: Castiel had been keeping him close enough to protect.
“Dean!” he greeted, stepping forward to pull him into a quick hug. Dean’s grin was huge as he wrapped his arms tight around Cas.
“I don’t care how you do things,” Cas retorted. “You haven’t been here for the past months, watching his cruelty toward those girls, experiencing it for yourself…” His hands twisted slowly, and Crowley’s screams grew louder.
“Nanshe, huh?” Cas teased.
“You do remember,” she pointed toward herself, “that I speak Russian, one of the two languages spoken there.”
Castiel let out a weak chuckle. “No, no...” he wouldn’t quite meet Dean’s eyes. “They just...they didn’t approve of my relationship with Michael. We weren’t, uh...” he toyed with the hem of his maternity blouse. “We weren’t true mates.”
Castiel held up a hand to cut him off. “All is forgiven, Agent Winchester. Besides, you weren’t the only one who ran that day. I owe you an apology as well.”
He turned his horrified gaze on Ana. “He’s been sheltering me from it?”
“I thought...I thought… gotten back control...could keep ...safe,” Cas’s voice carried on the breeze, whistled through the mountain.
the text read.
“Isn’t she beautiful?” Crowley grabbed Castiel by the blonde hair and yanked his head back, lifting his still-worshipful gaze. “Such a beautiful little whore.”
"Crowley?" Castiel questioned.
He said something to the guy walking with him, then turned and started walking towards me. The guy looked at me, then froze, his eyes wide. I don’t know what he thought was happening, but he quickly turned away and started trotting towards one of the few cars still in the lot.
“I’m not an alpha,” Dean seethed.
“We should have listened,” Gadreel said. “If we had, she wouldn’t be…” His gaze dropped to where Dean cradled Ana’s body.
As they neared Dean’s room, Cas kept his eyes downward, focused on the children. He didn’t want to see that closed door, didn’t want to think about what was happening inside.
Castiel smiled broadly, the break in his heart now on its way to mending. “I think, just for right now, that’s enough.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “I caught sight of a couple of his shipping containers as Sammy and I were getting into the car the other day.”
“How can I help you, Castiel?”
When Brady saw Novak in Anatomy on Monday, the dude went white then blushed up to his hairline. He studiously avoided Brady’s gaze and kept his head down.
“When will I hear back from him?” Dean asked.
As Dean led Cas back out to the Impala, their fingers still linked between them, Cas smiled up at him flirtatiously. “So…”
Well, Jessie was the last of the children who had parents here in the compound. Castiel turned to the other six children who remained and smiled warmly. Whether their parents were dead or simply missing...
She could feel the creature writhing, fighting, beating against her power with ferocious attacks. She could barely maintain her hold against it, even with Castiel’s help—the help of her supreme—but he had fought it alone for days now.
Castiel didn't respond, but his silence was answer enough. Naomi sighed heavily.
“No! No, no!” Dean immediately assured him, his expression anxious.
“Gordon,” Dean called, his tone brooking no argument. The tall lanky alpha broke away from the others and stepped up to Dean.
“And you never should, because I gotta tell you: just from your vibe, I can tell you’re probably on Dean’s bad side.”
be, but he knew it wouldn't be just that.
Several children let out giggles as the girl cried, “No! In your tummy!”
She nodded toward the cells. “Lead the way, Detective.”
“Don’t ya’ fellas worry none!” Benny winked and held up his phone. “I got it covered.” The doorman nodded then shut the doors behind himself as he stepped back out.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I was trying to keep my mind busy so I wouldn’t go crazy over you! You were just wandering around, distracting me with your scent and your eyes and your…I mean, that dinner where you dressed in your uniform? God, that was a rough one! I could barely even focus on Sam and Ana.”
So they’d gone red, then. Dean didn’t care, he had other priorities at the moment.
“But they weren’t your True Mate! Because if you’d ever pulled that stunt on them, like you did this poor omega…”
“Dean, your eyes...”
He couldn’t go back, not when the mere sight of Cas’s rare smiles sent his heart swooping, his mind reeling. Not when the memory of that quiet conversation over Oreos replayed in his mind again and again. Not when he recalled the jealousy that spiked within him when he saw Castiel with Crowley. Not now that he’d realized the depth of his own devotion.
Castiel shook himself and continued. “They hired a governess who started grooming her for marriage at age
“Your cat is quite lovely, if just a bit overprotective,” she praised as Lord Dupuis saw her to the door.
"Okay, you're okay. Where have you been all day?"
“I didn’t want it to end,” Dean admitted.
"I'm tried of being used. Tired of hurting.  I'm...so tired."
“Stop worrying!”
Dean arched a brow, but didn't offer any comment. Castiel suddenly felt like he had to explain, which was ridiculous. He didn't owe this boy anything, but still...
hurt him.”
“You have no fucking idea,” Meg muttered with a glare at the couple. “I was happy living my single life, but now they gotta throw it up in my face every fucking time I see them.”
"For waiting. For getting to know me and giving me a bed."
He adored Dean getting rough near the end, when his thrusts would turn uneven and haphazard. He adored Dean wrapping him up in his long, tan arms, fingers splaying low on Cas’s back to keep him close. He adored waking up in the morning to Dean’s smile, morning breath be damned. He adored showering with Dean, laughing as his boyfriend used the shampoo to twist their hair into funnier and funnier shapes.
?” Garth pointed toward the purple cloud. “The one who’s definitely alive?”
“That’s them, isn’t it?” Dean asked.
Castiel had forgotten just how easy it was to fall in love with Dean. Every moment he spent with his conman, from the private jet ride to the pricey villa to the crisp white sheets, he could feel himself tumbling back into that warm place where it was just him and Dean and their deep, abiding bond.
Oh...right. He wasn’t ignoring Benny and Dean. He was just keeping to his cover as an omega who only spoke Russian. He was really just that
"Nah...I'll let my security team take care of it!"
Charlie was escorted past a few minutes later, toward the ladies’ holding cell.
“Now march!”
Castiel shook his head sadly. “I just don’t want to lose him, not when it’s just starting.” He smiled at them. “I feel like I finally have something that’s just for me, and I don’t want to give that up.”
“Dean Winchester.”
A giggle escaped Anael, followed by a chortle from Michael. Soon, all three of the siblings were laughing hysterically.
“Castiel,” he breathed, and it was thunderous in the silence that cloaked the them.
Castiel stared at the ceiling, the words echoing in his mind. Fresh tears slipped down his cheeks
“All wrong?”
Dean slowly sat up, forcing the others back. “How?”
Snuggling deeper into his lap, the cat purred contentedly.
Cas smiled softly as he reached for another cookie. “I think it will be easier to start with the follow-up.” He glanced away. “I was born with my power, like most of my brothers and sisters. But, even as an infant...it was far too strong, too volatile. Within three months, Ana had found me. She took me in, raised me, honed my skills.”
He smiled blandly and nodded at the security guard behind the front desk, lifting a hand in greeting to a colleague as he passed. Generic but likable, that was Dean Smith.
“Hello, my little friend,” he murmured, his voice cracking with his tears. He rubbed a gentle hand over the cat’s back. “Have you caught any tasty mice today?”
“How far along are you?” The young alpha woman seated across from Donna asked. Her name was Jo, and she was Ellen’s daughter. Her mate, a beta named Ruby, was somewhere in the facility, but Castiel had yet to meet her.
Dean flushed and glanced over at Castiel, but the smaller boy said nothing. He'd let Dean decide how this was gonna play, if they were going all the way with this.
Benny stepped up between them, smirking. “Time to make a house call.”
“Hey!” Cas yelped, jerking his hand back. “Gross!”
until the moment where he can’t force that forwards any more. It perplexed Castiel every time, knowing that he Dean was lying but unsure how to help, what to do, the correct way to help his friend. He could follow this example, but it sounded exhausting, and somehow he knew Sam wouldn’t buy it. “I’m… frustrated.” He finally decided. “This body is weak, and the world it lives in is tough. I’m going to be asking a lot of it, and somehow that’s reliant on my own resilience, which I worry is waning.”
"Is he with you?" The man asked, and Dean blinked up at him.
"That, and because he's your friend."
important enough?”
“What do you take me for?”
. It hurt. “How was your drink.”
than you can comprehend, Dean, I have been fighting for-”
“Oh.” He thought back over their interactions, the first conversation they’d had. “Is that why you appreciated the destruction of the Westboro Baptist Church?”
“Yeah, she helped alright.” Dean smirked.
Their dual torchlight barely piercing the darkness, but what he could see was ridiculous. This room was big, bigger than the whole of the cabin they’d just spent weeks in. Downstairs, cos there was a downstairs, was a big table with what looked like a map, desks with old Ham Radios, Telegraphs, Stereos, and at least another room back there. “What is this place?” Dean asked, and he felt Cas step up next to him, looking out over it all.
Dean arched a brow. “What do you mean?”
“Obvious?” Gordon muttered, and Cas nodded slowly.
After a long pause, she allowed her magic to fade from his. She stood beside him, listening as he recited the spell carefully, slowly, so that she heard and understood every word.
Crowley chuckled. "No more than you're lying to yourself, Darling." He brought his lips down to Castiel's, a kiss that Castiel eagerly returned despite the hollow feeling in his chest.
So Dean was into racing…and into Ketch. It was no big deal, he tried to tell himself. But it absolutely was, his alpha snapped back, because from what Castiel could see through his binoculars, Ketch was into Dean too.
Dean looked up from where he’d been whispering with Sam.
Dean‘s hands curled into fists as he shook with rage. “I did everything right! We’d cleared the building, triple checked every cam—“
It was exactly the same as what she saw with Dean, and when she told Sam about it, he was relieved. He admitted one quiet night that he’d always felt guilty, because Dean was taking care of him, providing for his future. Now
In the mid-fifties, military scientists had discovered the phenomenon. The promise had been “Higher planes of existence, sharper senses,” and even, “Discover your true soulmate!” The appeal of those promises had been far too enticing for many to ignore.
Castiel could sense the tension between them, like he was some kind of shiny gold belt and they two heavyweights about to go head to head. It was as flattering as it was annoying.
Dean’s fists slammed into the punching bag, striking rhythmically and repetitively, again and again, brutal blows that would incapacitate any real opponent. His anger, frustrations, and fears poured into each punch, until a final strike sent the bag flying across the room. With a sigh, he stepped back and ran a hand through his hair.
The man held out his hand toward Castiel, a warm smile on his face. “John Winchester. You must be Cas.”
For the first time, Victor looked away. He ran a hand over his mouth. “I couldn’t stop the elevator in time. He was supposed to get trapped in there too.”
---------------------
Bright blue eyes blinked back at him, plush pink lips spread into a knowing smile, and that deep, resonant voice he still felt in his dreams said, “Hello, Dean.”
Dean slipped into the darkened apartment, trying not to make too much noise as he crept through the dining room. He shuddered as the rainwater that had caught in his hair dripped down his neck into his collar, soaking the fabric and winced as the floorboard creaked below his boots.
Castiel groaned and flung a hand over his eyes. "I don't know! I don't know..." He trailed off. "I, uh... I met someone during lunch, up in the bathroom."
“How did he... from what I understand, it’s very painful for omegas.”
Crowley chuckled. “For one as thirsty as this? She’s just a slut begging for it like she’s always in heat.” He gripped Castiel’s chin and jerked it up for a rough kiss. “Such a good omega bitch.”
Cas ignored him in favor of signing yet another form. He loved his job, but fuck if the paperwork didn’t kill him.
“You gonna go for it?” He asked.
He watched as Castiel hurried to the elevator, offering him one final wave when he turned to press the button inside. Castiel smiled again and gave a timid wave of his own just as the elevator doors shut, cutting him from Dean’s view.
So right after the nightmare. Cas had finally accepted the role that would keep him far away from Dean. But now the question rose as to why he’d done it: to avoid Dean...or protect him?
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Gabriel,” Dean greeted the shorter man.
Castiel watched with slight distaste as Dean grabbed the ketchup bottle out of the holder and squirted a liberal amount all over his fries.
Dean found himself adding the number to his phone for later. Why not take advantage of a sure thing?
Luci grinned, teeth too white in the pool’s lowlights. “Because Crowley wants it.”
“Just Dean, Mother!” Castiel called back as he tugged Dean out of the chilly November air into the warm house.
She shot him a deadpan look. “Because you're awesome!”
Castiel grinned dopily. "So it is."
“It’s okay,” Castiel offered. “I just...she likes catching me off guard. Even if you had been able to warn me in that split second, it still wouldn’t have been enough time.”
“It shouldn’t have to,” Dean said. “You’re a good person.”
He heard the called, “Adieu, Lord Dupuis!” but he did not turn back.
“We made it look like a botched job,” Luci confirmed, then leaned back and folded his hands behind his head. “So trust me, killing one agent ain’t gonna start any war. I’ll just make a little call to my friend, have him push it under the rug.”
Dean was once again pacing up and down the library in the bunker, glancing at the clock every minute or two.
He watched silently from his spot on the ground as Castiel drew nearer. He looked different...softer. Perhaps it was the loose, flowing blue robe that tugged this way and that in the breeze, or the dark hair that whipped loosely around his face.
“How’s it going in here?” Castiel heard from the door. He turned to find Dean standing there, but couldn’t find it in himself to provide much of an answer.
Turned out to be a good call on his part. It was just one less piece of clothing I had to yank off when we fucked in the backseat of the Impala after Brady left.
“How sickeningly adorable,” Gabe cooed.
Dean reached up to pass a hand in front of them. Were his eyes gold like Castiel’s?
“Fuck you, Dean Winchester,” he breathed. Even though he knew Dean couldn’t hear him, it still felt good to say.
“I don’t think it’s fair that my parents are forcing Anael to marry your brother just because she is an omega princess,” Castiel blurted out.
“Were they wrong? Crowley and Ruby, I mean.”
He peered through the keyhole, and sure enough, New Guy stood there, shifting from foot to foot. Castiel realized that he should probably get the new guy's name; it'd be weird to call him New Guy as they fucked.
“You’re not angry?”
Dean’s head snapped toward the east when he heard Sam running through the trees, just far enough away that Dean couldn’t see him through the fog.
“Dean,” Castiel whined, his face twisted in pain as another contraction hit.
“And you
As they strolled back out toward the gallery, Castiel kept his smile in place, but internally he sighed heavily. Now that Hester knew, now that Castiel had stood his ground, he had to wonder how much longer he and Dean had.
beforehand.”
“Donna?” Dean quirked an eyebrow.
Hannah’s face scrunched slightly. “How? I don’t feel connected to you, but I can feel her.” She pointed to Ana. “I can’t even sense your secondary gender.”
This chapter is completely new! The original version on Tumblr only went through chapter 9, but I always felt like there should be at least 1 more, a true epilogue that just wrapped it all in a nice bow. So, enjoy!
“Hey there,” Brady held up his hands in an appeasing manner. “Not trying to cause problems. It just suddenly makes so much more sense.”
Dean's eyes widened in recognition. So he had heard about Victor.
“You gave me your
Dean’s mind raced. Had that been the couple that the men had been joking about before Dean and Benny got to them? The gang they’d just finished off—and yes, once upon a time Dean would have felt bad about killing actual humans, but these men had only been out for blood, adding to the mayhem by attacking innocent civilians trying to reach safety, which meant that they were just as bad as the real monsters out there—but they’d talked about an alpha and omega couple...
Dean must have seen his confusion because he explained, "You said I was communicating with my friend right now."
“Sorry,” Gabriel wheezed, but his frame still shook. “It’s just...we can all agree Cas is being an idiot, right?”
“Well, news certainly does travel fast,” Castiel muttered, leaning back in his chair. He crossed his legs, folded his hands in his lap. It was a false confidence, he knew, but it still helped, even if just in his own chest.
“I do, Castiel. I really do,” Dean promised.
Crowley was laying in bed, reading. He looked up when he heard the door open and smiled when he saw Castiel.
The graceful, beautiful,
Dean frowned at the idea, but Hannah was quick to correct his assumption. “To protect you, not push you away.”
Right, Cas was officially a dumbass. Here Dean was,
She sighed and set down her devotional book, patting the couch cushion beside her. She took a sip of wine as Castiel padded across the living room to flop down onto the couch beside her.
Finally,
“None of your damn business,” Winchester growled. “Now get the hell out of here before I beat the shit outta you for annoying me.”
“Yes, he is missing,” Hannah soothed, even as she took a moment to greet the others then turned back to Dean. “The council decreed that they could not have her running halfway around the world when the supreme is missing. If this does come to the worst, they need Ana to train the new rising Supreme.”
"Leave," Dean muttered.
“I just saw something,” Hannah gasped as she ran up beside him.
It’d make everything so much easier.
Castiel glanced at him skeptically. Sure, he was saying that now, but what about next week when he was still being shunned. Obviously this boy was too stubborn for his own good.
Castiel turned to face her, and immediately his face took on the same surprised expression that Ana’s had. “You are one of us.”
Dean grinned. “Sounds perfect!”
The gala brings far more surprises than even Castiel could have prepared for.
“Their racetrack,” Dean answered. “There’s a charity event today.”
Dean shot Brady a warning glance. “I’m sorry, you must be confused. I’m Dean Smith.”
"I just remembered, I promised Sam I'd help him with his math homework. I have to go."
Dean shook his head. “No, they weren’t wrong.”
Castiel smiled kindly. “Yes, that’s a baby too.”
. “Why don’t we say that the next flight is the 7:58 this evening? I may need you with me for the interrogations.”
Cas gave no answer, instead digging through a pile of odds and ends on the table.
Dean stared at the ground. “What?”
Dean tried the handle, and finding it unlocked, pushed the door open. He stepped inside, scanning the room.
He almost went to Dean, not even entirely sure of what he wanted to do or say, but then his arm was being grabbed by someone from behind. He turned to find Michael, who held him back as the others passed through.
“No, Dean, I meant it!” She pointed at him. “You just need to go home and leave us the hell alone.”
Again, Gia stepped forward first. “It is our own fault, that this burden now falls to you. I will go with you.”
The girl seemed to accept his answer, nodded, and followed the others as they filed past Dean’s closed bedroom door toward the bathroom.
The nightmarish god halted, and its expression looked shocked. The demonic figures shattered away, leaving their creator to fight Cas alone. It gasped in pain as Cas’s hand twisted in midair. He tightened his fingers into a fist, and the monster shuddered.
Now Castiel was left to endure the derision and hatred of the townspeople, forced to run from their loathing. He didn’t stroll down the winding side paths as he might have on another day, didn’t pause to inspect the wildflowers that were in full bloom, didn’t slow in the least until he was past his borders. Only when he was safely on his own land did he stop and slump onto the low stone wall, his cheeks burning with the exertion of his flight. There, in the silence of his isolation, he finally allowed the sobs to break free.
“Thank you!” Castiel enthused, squeezing the alpha’s forearm excitedly. “I was just thinking today that I’d need to figure something else out besides the floor.”
He turned to Sam. “Where is he?” he growled lowly.
Dean nodded, then turned and walked from the office, to the elevator, through the front lobby, and out the front door for one final time.
Charlie just shook her head. "I think you may have met your match, Castiel Novak. He's not gonna be easy to scare off."
The clone scoffed. “You’re going to make things right? After all the work I’ve done to tear this place apart?”
He plopped down in the chair in the corner, just long enough to untie and pull off his boots.
Bobby’s expression was inscrutable for several long moments, until he nodded. “I’ll expect your resignation on my desk tomorrow, then?”
“So young...”
His voice shook. “You were supposed to go with Hannah, I told Ana...”
Dean’s head dropped as his mind replayed the frantic words that had pulled him from the nightmare. The final word cut him to his core.
Silence fell before Sam murmured, “She is pretty, right?”
"Thank you," he murmured, looking up at Dean. "This was...I've never gotten to do this before." Before he could think better of it, he leaned up to press a kiss to the hinge of Dean's jaw. Dean's expression switched to one of surprise as he glanced down at Castiel, who started blushing. The gesture had been sweet, soft. So unlike him.
A few weeks before spring break, Sam was awarded a hefty scholarship, so he convinced Dean to use some of the saved-up tuition money for a vacation with Cas. Sam (and Jess, when she could sneak away) stayed with the house while Dean and Cas flew down to St. Bart’s for the week.
“It’s a plan.” He looked back down at the recipe on his phone.
Dean refused to give his friend’s name, no matter how much Cas prodded and guessed. It wasn't until they were walking up the steps to the giant villa’s patio that he dropped the casual line: “I’ve only ever known him as LeMarc.”
“Kinda makes you wonder if he was worth it, huh?” Benny yelled.
Pain, humiliation...betrayal. The surge of Cas’s bitterness stabbed through Dean. He felt like he couldn’t breathe, like his very soul was being crushed under the onslaught of self-loathing. But to watch Cas’s face...Dean hadn’t even realized, at the time, how much he’d hurt Castiel.
The others watched in silent shock as their voices grew louder, their bodies tensed for a fight.
“So you had to use me because…?” Cas said, still unwilling to let Dean off the hook.
I (barely) graduated high school and started working full-time for Bobby. Those paychecks went to bills and food and shit. But I was also working more for Ash. Hell, at some point, it started to feel like
Castiel really should have tried to stop the stupid words that popped into his brain, he really should’ve. He’d gotten really good at it in school, but there in the rain with that gorgeous man smirking down at him, he couldn’t seem to stop them.
Hurrying the children forward, Castiel smiled down at Ginny, although he could feel how false it was across his lips. She’d used her sparse words to ask a question, and he needed to answer or risk her pulling even further inside herself again. “I think she needs to ask him a question.”
“Who wants to play a game?”
Sam’s smile was fond, and Dean knew his brother was thinking of Eileen, the daughter of John’s closest advisor. Dean could see some definite parallels between the two unwilling royals, and already his mind was whirring away, figuring out angles that could make everyone happy.
But beyond that, Castiel looked...good. Better than good—distracting. But that didn’t make sense because he looked the exact same as the last time Dean had seen him. And yet his mouth dropped open, his brain short circuiting.
“Why are you...” Dean trailed off. “Why aren’t you, you know,
Castiel shook his head. “I’ve just...I’ve never gotten so much attention from so many alphas. Michael was always there to...to...” he trailed off as he bit back the sudden tears.
The warning bell rang, and they left the warm car to trudge inside. Once Cas had gone down the hall toward his first hour class, Jess whipped out her phone and typed a short message to Dean.
Dean shook his head. “No, I rejected the bond, it didn’t...”
“Usually I do,” Dean agreed. “But this time it all seemed so...I don’t know.”
“The sanctuary is set up in an old hospital, and we have some doctors and other people who can help you and your pup.” He tried to smile reassuringly. “We can keep you both safe.” A somewhat empty promise in the face of...everything, but it got the omega to finally look back at him in contemplation of his offer.
Cas chuckled and curled up next to Dean to press a kiss to his neck. “I agree wholeheartedly.”
Dean’s head shot up, and he found the dark-haired man with the striking blue eyes standing there...at their table, in this very restaurant.
“It’s not the same,” Dean finished his thought.
A rolling eyes emoji popped up on his screen.
Still Henriksen had no luck either, despite his network that remained as strong as ever. Dean knew that he and the team were out of options.
“That’s wonderful,” Cas complimented, and the worst part: he was being genuine.
Dean recognized Castiel immediately. His dark hair was a little bit longer now, and his face was thinner, older, but he was definitely the man from the picture. The black henley he wore seemed an exact match to it.
Dean’s expression turned bashful. “I’m trying.”
The text was short, to the point: “My place 2nite?”
“Dean,” Cas smiled as he turned to face the approaching alpha. “How was the supplies run?”
“You really are awful at this game, aren’t you?”
“You’ve got it all wrong: I don’t want you to get over me.”
don’t mind?”
Dean nodded. “And even if you say no to me, even if this is done between us...you’re still free. I made sure of that.”
Cas gets some bad news from his boss.
Before he’d known that Dean was back in town, he hadn’t thought about him in weeks…months, even. But now, the dumbass found his way into Cas’s thoughts on a minute by minute basis.
“I’m meeting Brady in a couple minutes,” Dean warned.
No explanation, no time or date.
Cas didn’t stop, didn’t even glance back, and Dean felt a burst of pain in his chest. He’d really fucked up this time.
Castiel’s frown twisted into a sharp smile. “A distraction would be helpful.”
Castiel nodded. “Good. I’ll catch up with you in a bit, Anna.”
"I missed that, too," Charlie said, touching his face lightly. "Hurry up and try those on. I wanna see how good you look."
Cas frowned. Obviously something was amiss. Maybe it was as simple as the fact that M. Winchester was the only person new enough to town to not hate Cas.
Dean nodded somberly, seemingly unsurprised by the abrupt change of subject. He brought a trembling hand up to cup Castiel’s wet cheek.
“I had Caleb waiting outside. Cas put that Jacob fella in a cab, then he just....” He trailed off as Dean's head jerked back up.
“Sixteen,” Dean supplied. “The day I presented omega was the day I became a pawn with a skillset. And luckily for him, not even my True Mate wants this, so he’s got me for good.” He laughed again, a hoarse, self-deprecating thing. “And now I don’t even have that stupid True Mate excuse, not after this. Guess who’s going to the highest bidder now?”
Gordon snorted. “Don’t worry, I haven’t gone near your precious omega. You can ask these guys,” he gestured back toward the other men on the crew who were all pretending not to listen.
She nodded, but her complexion remained pale.
Cas’s expression slipped to uncertainty, his eyes so hurt yet hopeful, and Dean pressed his advantage. “There’s nothing for you back there but a forged signature,” he whispered, his lips dangerously close to Cas’s.
“Call me Dean,” he asked. “And there’s no apology needed. Let’s just… start fresh?”
Cas shrugged nonchalantly. “It's what I've always done.”
She pointed to the wall. “I can’t break through that...but you can.”
Jess smiled and said in a sing-song voice, “There’s always this weekend.”
“Jess took care of it,” I answered.
Sam chuckled and shook his head. “Let me guess, he controls the one field that miraculously provides half the country’s food.”
Dean’s heart thundered in his ears, hoping...hoping that Cas would say the magic words.
“Benny?”
She wrapped her arms around Sam’s torso and frowned up at him. “Apparently
“Yes, Castiel, I have to make the deal with
“I just want to get to know you,” the alpha said, leering at Castiel knowingly. “Pretty little pregnant thing like you probably knows lots of tricks.”
"I know. But I want a change. I thought we could go through my closet and get rid of some things and I'd like to get a haircut. I just...I need a change."
“Hey Cas!” she greeted. Before she could even ask, Cas was throwing his arms around her in a tight squeeze, then stepped back quickly.
All of the figures stalked forward in perfect sync with their monstrous host. Still the council chanted behind Cas, and Dean somehow knew what they were doing: they were offering their power to the new supreme in this fight.
But it still hurt like a bitch to think about being separated from Dean. And yet, Cas already knew, deep down, they'd make it.
Cas was hyperventilating. “Yes! But we never said naked!”
He spun to face her. “Your true master, Kseniya. Don’t you recognize me? You swore to serve me if I brought your bastard of a son back.”
“Well, how are we going to find him?”
“What do you want?” the woman barked.
“Was he infected?” Benny asked from over Dean’s shoulder.
“I prefer Cas,” he replied without thinking.
Instead, Castiel shrugged noncommittally. He slid his hand into Dean’s and began leading him away from the art, away from the uncomfortable question that still hung in the air, toward the exit.
“Dean!” Micah yelled and flung himself at the tall alpha’s legs.
I laughed low. “Nah, we don’t have time for that tonight. You gotta get back to your friends.” And then I pulled my hand out and zipped up his jeans.
“You doin’ okay, brother?” Benny asked. He’d been there every step of the way in that journey, he’d seen Dean fall in love, then chop that love off at the root for the sake of his career. He’d never said anything about it, never judged, which Dean appreciated.
Dean tried not to let that hurt him, that loss of faith. There’d been a day when Cas would’ve believed in Dean completely, when Cas would’ve laughed at the thought of a silly challenge from a dick-off like the Leviathan, but now…
