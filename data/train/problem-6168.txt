Loki was imprisoned on Asgard and Thor did not imagine that Clint welcomed the prospect of being close to him, or that Clint was all that trustful of other Asgardians besides Thor himself.
Speaking of shock’s though. Tony’s thoughts were derailed as Thor’s hammer slammed directly into his chest, his distraction allowing Thor an opening to score another hit that sent him flying backwards into a post, his body slamming up against the sharper edges of the suit as he tried to orient himself and get back in the air before he fell into the metaphorical lava pit below.
He knew that voice. But Tony couldn’t heed it. He didn’t want to keep breathing when every breath was knives in his lungs.
Her laughing thoughts trilled through his mind and he audibly scoffed, to Steve's obvious confusion.
“Cap!” Tony slapped one hand hard against Rogers shoulder, and this deep inside his head Tony could feel how that blow hurt but Steve barely even winced. It was enough however to pull his unfocused gaze from Barnes and Tony kept a tight grip on him as he tried to knock some sense back into him.
it, but the names won't materialize inside his mind. These are memories that belong to someone else. Not Ivan. Not the soldier. But
"Last one in is a monkey's uncle!" He shouts, just as he's overtaken by Rhodey, his long powerful legs carrying him past Tony in a blur of speed and laughter.
Even hyped up on extremis Ty was no match for an experienced fighter, let alone this completely terrifying display of pantherlike strength and motion going on in front of him. Tony wasn't actually sure he would have pit an actual ass panther against the guy.
And then he remembered what T’Challa had told him, that day in the lab, back when things had been simpler, when his hope had been younger but his doubts no less crushing.
"That was awful. Even for you Stark."
“Nor so happy to lose to a foreign Pride,” Nakia added in a poignant way. She was leaning up against the bar, watching where Natasha was mixing up one of her secret revival smoothies. She refused to tell anyone what was in them exactly but there was nothing like them for giving the old tired system a jolt. Nakia had turned her head to stare at T’Challa, who frowned at her with a distinct air of embarrassment behind it. The she-tom smirked.
With a spin of his wheels that screamed huffiness the bot begrudgingly complied, gears whirring just loud enough to make his feelings on the matter known.
"How! How are you doing this? Release me!" M.O.D.O.K. was screeching as he streaked past, and Tony praying that his lab work would pay off, gathered that hot pulsing energy in the center of his chest and cast it toward his palms.
But the itch of not being close enough, of leaving them vulnerably unbonded, was distracting and only growing stronger by the day.
“I’m glad, but I’m kinda surprised you didn’t.”
But here in his memories the sun is beating down bright and the water is blue as anything as he runs towards the edge of the low cliff side.
“What’s going on?” Steve voiced aloud and Tony shrugged already reaching within his suit jacket for his phone.
"You need to slow your heart rate down." Natasha's warning was devoid of all emotion in tone but her concern wrapped around Tony through their bond almost in spite of how professional her mask was.
“Hey Tony, tell this guy how fast the average kat heals.” Clint said, and Tony could only presume he meant tell medi-kat because Rhodey definitely knew already, what with how often Tony managed to injure himself. Not that it made much sense for the medic not to know either.
“What is it?” they ask. This is Jaime. He’s not kin the same way the boy in their arms is but that doesn’t mean he isn’t theirs.
“Please don’t tell anybody.” Peter pleaded, finally looking up at Tony despite the fear he felt. He had to make him understand. “T-they’ll kill me or take me away, and I can’t do that to my aunt. I’m all she has.”
But there are other memories that sober just as well, that don't leave him shaking and heaving with the need to be sick. These memories are rich with scents: roses in the garden, lye soap and shoe polish, flour, soil and bubbling bone broth.
“Aye my friend. Though she may indeed seem a god to you Midgardians, she is but one of many from a race called the Kǫtrdýr. We came across them many earth centuries ago. There was a brief war, which my mother helped to end. As a show of good faith that our two kingdoms would always be at peace, Bastet presented her with a pair of kits.”
Natasha’s warning was accompanied with a dark sense of threat – the threat of losses not yet felt, and tears not yet shed – and there was nothing for Tony to do but swallow and nod his head.
Above him was a haze. Through it he thought he glimpsed faces, familiar, and then a light, pale and blue, but he couldn’t concentrate on any of them.
The bastards never fully realize till it’s too late but he’s the most expensive ride any of them will take in this lifetime.
"Okay. Here's the thing, screw that. " He snapped with a click of his jaw. His eyes quickly darted to Steve when he shifted slightly, so that he was in front of Natasha, partially blocking the fel from view as if to protect her from Tony's judgment and Tony had to fight not to roll his eyes. The last person who needed that sort of coddling was Natasha, but the fact that she didn't immediately try to remove his balls told Tony quite a lot more on its own.
While mounting, a tom sinks their teeth into it and a signal shoots up to the brain and strait down to the ovaries to start serving up eggs. With any luck over the next couple of days of heat driven continuous coupling, the two will part oh so proud parents to be. The Ovular-Gland is touch sensitive, the more enflamed the more so, but it takes a fare amount of continuous pressure to flip the switch so when tom’s bite, they bite hard and they hold on for dear life. It’s commonly called latching, and it also happens to be a biological failsafe, because even though heat hormones muddle the brain, as long as you avoid latching a fel can avoid an unwanted pregnancy.
“The woman on the right is a 99.9 percent match for McKenzie Walsh. Twenty-one-year old resident of Virginia. The feline on her left does not match with any registered identity within the prespecified margins, Sir.”
The 22nd Of December
“So you invited the man we think is behind all this to walk into your house for a chat?” Cap demanded incredulously, the air already getting peppery with fight scent and Tony wrinkled his nose, flicking his tail in irritation. Rhodey sighed and somehow looked like he was about to pass out from how not surprised he was.
Natasha, shivering, pressed closer to his back and more of her warmth leeched from her body to his. There was something not quite natural about how steadily he could feel that warmth, how purposefully his body seemed to take it from hers and he knew that she had to be giving it to him somehow.
Phil had been unexpected. The first human being that Clint had ever met who didn’t ignore that half his DNA was human and treated Clint like he was worth more than his service. He never seemed to have a hair out of place even on the most dangerous of missions but he went home to watch bad tv with the rest of America ( or good TV as he insists, shit like M.A.S.H and Happy Days). He drove a vintage car and collected trading cards and even got Clint to admit that he'd always kind of liked the Captain America comics as well.
“You did not, you big liar!” Princess shrieked indignantly, face lighting up as she cackled with laughter.
“I guarantee you however nasty your grandmother is she has nothing on the guys that I’m dealing with, so you’re going to stay here and keep out of trouble.” Tony responded, already headed for the back door.
Fury opened his mouth like he might say something to that disturbing bit of imagery, but he paused mid breath at the sound of Bruce clearing his throat down at the other end of the table.
"It's you Tony.” Bruce replied softly, laying a hand over Tony’s where it was twisted in the blanket. “Or rather the Queen brain.  I've had a chance to get further through the files T’Challa gave us.  It's amazing what your brain is capable of. Your psychic ability is off the charts.”
For the visual people, check out the
He (Bruce) still worries when this happens, so mindful of the delicate creature in his arms, but in this future (in this dream) he’s not alone with Hulk anymore. The team is together, all of them, and that means even when he can’t find the strength to calm his mind or make his heart slow on his own, the others can help.
The bald admission didn’t surprise Tony, but the tense silence that fell over the room was heavy. T’Challa didn’t flinch from Tony’s hard stare, and if he noticed the way the air was thickening with the smell of fight he didn’t let it show.
“Man has a point.” Tony drawled and Ross smiled through his teeth.
But even as he said it the tension was draining out of him. This time he didn’t fight it.
“I only met your brother briefly on my way out the window,” Tony quipped, scraping the last bits of sauce from the sides of his bowl noisily. “But he seems like kind of a shit starter. Spending an afternoon knee deep in stag shit actually sounds fairly fitting. Go Thor’s mom.”
They’re a small kit, small even for their age and the man who is father (but isn’t) takes their blood and says their veins would be easier to find if (he) weren’t such a runt.
Tony stopped struggling if only because he was dangling in the air secured only by a single mans arm and he wasn't suicidal.
"Two?! Goodness you speak well. He'll be giving sermons with the rabbi next thing we know."
He only had a moment to savor the victory because Aldrich chose that moment to breathe actual ass fire at him, and Tony had to duck and roll to avoid becoming barbeque.
His eyes quickly scanned the deceptively empty hall until he spotted the small black device on top of a pile of broken plaster. He marched over and crushed it with his heel. He could tell that had effectively killed the noise when Peter slumped over, releasing his ears with a painful moan and Steve did the same and slowly straightened once more.
“But to some people, you and I are just animals. We’re not people enough to make the choice between right and wrong and when it’s necessary to fight to save ourselves or others.”
There was a long pause in which Tony could hear his own heart pounding unusually loudly in his ears and a faint sound on the other end of the line that might have been a purr but could also have been the hum of a machine before the tom responded.
“I told you I hated those comics. They got so many things wrong, but Bucky was a flat out lie. The man I knew was a smart ass who never let me get away with a single thing. A lot like you.”
“You’re damn right.” Steve smiled back at him and Tony laughed.
“Just because you sound like Clint Barton doesn’t mean you are Clint Barton,” the unfamiliar female chimed in a worldly way, but there was something about her tone that made Clint think she was yanking his tail. He kind of liked it. Having the Stark Resilient interns crawling all over the tower the past few weeks was taking some getting used to. A nice bunch, but most of them were used to living and working in very restrictive settings and seem terrified of stepping even a hair out of line. It was like having a tower full of Bruce’s scuttling about and fidgeting in their lab coats.
"I am utilizing your American obsession with the democratic process."Luke explained in a tone that was somehow one hundred percent serious even as he was grinning down at Tony like the cat that got the canary. "My vote, is no."
"So why are you?" Natasha asked with a red eyebrow arched.
Tony had always been a warrior. That wasn’t the difference.
Phil gave him an unimpressed look.
“Yours, when you threw up all over that rug Pepper loved in the Malibu house weeping into your champagne glass about how much you couldn’t live without him if Charlie took that job in Manchester.” Tony chuckled.
“He’s a killer Steve. The best there is. Whatever he was before is gone.”
“You are an exceptional rarity in the world Mr. Stark. But you’re not perfect. None of the gata are. You’ve been broken down, chipped away at over the centuries, and now you are not even capable of fulfilling the purpose of your design are you?” Killian was saying as he leaned over Tony once more, hand trailing down the smooth plane of his chest and lips curling into a smile as Tony tensed, the acrid smell of fear filling the air as the man’s fingers brushed against the edge of the arc reactor.
Natasha bites a poisoned apple, there's no prince to kiss her awake. Tony takes a shitty hand and shows AIM why this isn't checkers (They thought it was). Harley's house gets blown up, but Tony's pretty okay with that because it was falling down anyway and he's pretty good at building things.
And now that he has pupils of his own, he only hopes to do right by them.
“You had us worried, but T’Challa said it wasn’t abnormal.” Bruce murmured, his hands gently skimming over Tony’s arm, expertly avoiding his tubing and Tony purred at the contact. He was so focused on Bruce he hadn’t even noticed T’Challa approaching in the hall through the clear doors.
Tony didn’t realize he was still speaking until he recognized the lingering echo of his own voice in the barn, choked on a sob. Natasha had lifted a hand and was stroking it through his hair, and he shouldn’t be so damn needy, especially when she was injured, but he couldn’t help but sink into her. He let the gesture sooth him until his breathing had evened and the unspilled tears had dried up and he could blink the fugue of misery and panic away.
“Did Tony ever show you his dream?” Steve asked and Natasha was still beside him. Steve looked up at her and found pensive green eyes staring back.
“It’s your lucky night Cap. They’re on display for a reason so friends get pain free ogles.” Natasha murmured with a slight smirk raising her glass to drink. Though many of the ladies filling the hall were wearing evening gloves she’d chosen few accessories herself, allowing her form hugging dress and various bared appendages to speak for themselves.
“So they try and take our teeth, and when that doesn’t work they put us down.” Tony finished in a grave tone. “I don’t know what those guys were after. Maybe they were bad. Maybe they’re trying to help themselves or somebody else, but either way if the Avengers don’t get a handle on the situation and somebody gets hurt, a lot of Gata are going to suffer. Do you understand?”
Another update. Doing my best to keep this alive. :) Thank you for your kind words of encouragement and your feedback. I hope you enjoy it. If you're looking for some mood music, this title's chapter and driving inspiration is taken from Billy Joel's "For the longest time".
Stupid. So stupid. So unfair. But she knew it was true. Dashing away the prick of tears Nyota continued.
“If it’s in my tower? I think so” Tony snipped and T’Challa chuckled under his breath.
“Really, then why did you say yes to your little team of freaks? ” Stone snarled yanking Tony’s head back against the table by his hair, and Natasha finally realized what she’d sensed that day at the tower was so wrong about the man’s scent. She hadn’t been able to pin it before because it wasn’t a matter of what was wrong with his scent but what was right.
Because there’s no reason for Steve to know how he likes his coffee - black with two spoons of demerara sugar (cabinet left of the sink, marked CRACK in Rhodey’s handwriting) or that he’s a chewy bacon guy (because why would you dry the life out of bacon people, come on) and that he can’t stand runny egg yolk, unless Steve has cared enough to pay attention.
A/N: Back with another chapter. Wow, I am really blown away that people are still reading this. I really hope you enjoy.
He wasn’t about to give Barnes the chance to attack and put him on the defensive. The enhanced kat was extremely strong, and even though the suit could keep up, Tony knew it would be a mistake to give the winter soldier even that slight advantage. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a red streak, but didn’t dare take his eyes off of Barnes, or the wicked throwing stars he seemed to pull out of nowhere to fling with the speed of light.
“How do you figure we do that?” Clint asked. “I don’t think he’s listed in the white-pages do you?”
And in that haze of rage all he could think was why not?
“You helped us in a tight spot son, and we’re grateful, but the Avengers are a team. If you really want to be a part of it, the first rule of teamwork is listening to your teammates.” He scolded in that ‘Captain America disapproves’ tone that could wilt flowers. “Tony asked you to stay on the bench. Having an untrained wild card appear on the field disrupts the entire team. You could have caused more harm by showing up than you realize.”
This year he’d had to improvise some because of the destruction of the Shelter, but Pepper had made arrangements to see the lodge properly decked out and that the residents would have as fine a Christmas as Tony’s money could buy them.
Steve closed his eyes in relief and hugged Tony tight.
“How could our friend Ty or any tom hope to win the heart of someone like you, when he had no teeth? No way to fight for you? No way to fight for your progeny? It’s a crime Tony. You come from a beautiful masterful people, but you’re all broken.”
“Go back!” Nyota shouted as she tried to reach the pilots chair. She was caught and held back by her cousin Riri and her younger brother T’Cael. She hissed at them, swiping her claws across Riri’s cheek. The younger girl yowled and bared her teeth but didn’t let go. T’Cael squeezed her waist like he meant to squeeze the very air out of her. It’s the desperate fear on her brother’s face that finally makes her go limp. She won’t hurt him. Not anymore than he’s already been hurt.
“Did you?” Steve asked dryly as Harley waved his StarkPad emphatically in Tony’s face until the older fel grabbed it and took a look at what was on screen. Which turned out to be a complicated looking hand drawn graph that he must have uploaded. Tony was going to have to teach him how to use a Smartsheet.
“What about that armor you’re wearing? Any more of those?” Tony suggested almost too causally and Thor laughed under his breath.
You could say the whole making Tony his son and heir thing had been Howard’s last big joke on the world.
“We’ll be moving to the ballroom shortly. I’d give it a half hour or so, a few cocktails. A dance or two so there’s a nice cozy picture of you and Tony dancing on the front page tomorrow that Pepper can turn into gold. I’ll let Pepper know so Happy can be waiting with the car. You alert the others.” She answered with a considering look in Tony’s direction. “He’s got time.”
Some sort of firewall had been put up since he’d last hacked into the ship, but slicing through it was so easy Tony almost wondered if T'Challa were inviting him in. There was a chance that T'Challa might not still be aboard Daggar, but he had a hunch that even if he wasn't that T'challa would have left something in place to alert him if Tony showed up again where he didn’t belong. It's what Tony would do.
He felt himself sliding and didn’t fight it. He let his head fall against the prince’s warm shoulder and frowned when T’Challa squirmed and shifted about, until he realized that the tom was only moving so that Tony could lie more comfortably, his head resting against the soft hollow between chest and shoulder.
“Never stopped me before.”
Tony’s hands clenched in his lap. It was everything he could do not to reach over and check again that Steve was truly okay.  So, was it worth it? Yes - because Steve was worth anything because those that Tony loved would always be worth anything – and no. Because Steve was alive and Barnes was someone that he loved.  Tony took a deep breath and let it out slow.
“No it’s not.” Amory spoke up from his work station. While Nyota was focused on the complicated process of weapons restock, he was surrounded by blue holo-screens, burrowing deep into several private servers (including government ones) continuing the delicate process of weaving identities for them. But he'd looked up from his work his gentle brown eyes meeting hers with sympathy, and even worse, understanding.
"Nip isn't bad in small doses. Amee's not as bad as some of the others." Bruce mused aloud, watching as (surprise) the doctor informed Amee's parent that she was expecting kits.
"JARVIS, hook us up." he prompted and JARVIS, sounding faintly amused himself responds almost as quickly.
If Tony hadn’t already wheedled him into weighing in on some special project he had going, or hadn’t busted his head open (or bruised something or another during the last call to assemble) and refused the medical attention of a proper medical doctor, the probability that he’d just come breezing into Bruce’s lab before the day was out - with some new spark of genius that absolutely couldn’t wait, in need of some friendly advice, or even just a distraction from dealing with some pressing problem that he’d work up to asking advice about in his own sweet time - was high and only getting higher. The probability of a Tony related distraction (sans heat) was currently at 77%. Pre-heat had increased those probable's to 89%.
Lady Ponka gave them both a curious look as she swept past them in the thick furs the Jabari tribe were so known for.
pride. The first in centuries this side of the pacific and it's a pretty big deal. Fury wants his little team of superheros to stay fighting fit and government approved and Pepper keeps on insisting that Tony needs to smooze and garner new contracts for SI, so unfortunately there was no getting out of that nights event.
Next up, Tony's surgery chapter! Clint and Tony deal with the past. Steve and T'Challa have a little peace talk of their own. And dare I say it? A wild Bucky (finally) appears.
“Tony… this is a city.” Darren gaped. “You want to build an entire city?”
Steve had been all but ordered to consider Tony as a potential mate when Fury had first presented the Initiative to him, but Steve was not the sort of guy to follow orders blindly and that fresh from losing Bucky the idea had left him feeling sick. In those days just getting out of bed in the morning without wanting to slip back under the ice took most of his energy; but he’d told himself he had to keep going for Bucky’s sake, and that Bucky would have wanted the Pride, would have jumped at the opportunity that Fury was offering and that it would mean so much for the Gata.
“Either you’re still pretty pissed about that,” Steve remarked, straightening his stance as he flicked his eyes down purposefully to those gleaming claws once more. “Or you’re just happy to see me.”
(Oh Bruce.)
"I will... Sir." The kid gulped and Tony was laughing as Steve pulled him out into the crowd of dancers again.
Clint felt the hair on his body raise and bit back the urge to hiss.
Unnamed infant. *
He was already naturally quicker than these rats could ever hope to be. He didn’t worry about the bullets, counting on what he’d observed of the extremis virus in the enemy. He felt the occasional sting of a hit but it was just that, a sting. They might as well have been bees. They did piss him off however and the claws came out with a growl and he was happy to teach the guy trying to slam the butt of his gun against his skull the error of his ways.
"I admit to some curiosity about that." Tony allowed with a shrug, though the tom couldn't see him either. "Sorry to disappoint you Catguy. They were very nice arms, but I have this rule about not jumping into bed with undercover operatives. Especially ones from foreign governments."
He remembers his frustration with Tony’s prodding, his smug attempt to hear the soldier admit that he suspects Bucky is his zero. The ash he rose from at his rebirth. He’d spat out his real name, and the room had changed.
just went to show that you never really knew a person. The child in him wanted to wail that she of all people should know him better.
“What is it about the human brain you find so interesting?” Tony asked, but the young woman was already waving away his question before he even finished.
“Alright.” he grunted in response, swishing his tail as if there were some annoying fly he wanted to swat but the only annoying thing here really was Prince T’Challa and how well he seemed to have Tony’s number. He couldn’t really argue against that. T’Challa hadn’t really harmed him or anyone else in his mission and the mission itself made a lot of logical sense. Yeah maybe he’d toyed with Tony a little bit with all that flirting but Tony was a big boy (he’d literally just told Rhodey that) and had known what he was about when he’d let it continue. Hell, he’d been an active participant up until he’d decided to commit to a relationship with Steve.
Relief threatened to drown him for a moment as the fear that had gripped him since waking up exposed and at the mercy of his captors finally had its way with him, so grateful to see the face of a friend that he could almost cry.
“Courting?” Natasha asked dryly, green eyes assessing the tom closey and Luke, apparently unbothered, smiled wider.
He heard an explosion but it wasn’t what finally made him pause, it was the sudden tingling in his brain, the yank he felt back towards the facility and the sudden certain knowledge that Clint was hurt and hurt badly.
Tony sucked in a slight breath. He knew how badly he'd fucked things up, and what a hard time she was going to have facing the trouble that Robert was stirring up. She was always cleaning up his messes. Shielding him. Loving him even though he was probably the least deserving person on the planet.
The soldier had brought them there.
“Don’t think my wish is something that will fit under the tree Big Guy.”
"I've known your mama since we were barely knee high. And just look at you boychick. Oh Maria he's just a little cherub." She pinches his cheek which hurts but then she kisses the spot a moment later and Tony decides he likes it and the smell of her perfume.
The name of the one who came before Ivan is on the tip of his tongue. Scratching at his mind like an itch. When he remembers the name of the ghost who lives inside of him he wonders what it will change. It’s an insatiable curiosity that he shouldn’t have. He covets it all the more for that.
Those places had always made Tony feel like an object. His dates had wanted to show him off. All too eager to be seen with America's most infamous bad kitty on their arm amidst the bubbling champagne and gleaming chains.
"Yeah.  Biologically we're pretty stunted...." the tom said with a sad wry little smile. "But that's changed now. That's why we secluded you. You now have a fully functional Queen brain with none of the training for it. Between that and your technopathy we thought it best to bring you down here. We didn’t think machines exploding and accidently melting people’s brains was a good way for you to wake up.”
“So quick to call in your debts when we have only just caught our breath,” T’Challa teased crossing over to the bar where Pepper had organized a spread for their royal visitor. He grabbed a cube of cheese off a tray and popped it into his mouth chewing and then carefully swallowing before he went on, “But as you said, a deal is a deal. I have a few medical files I’d be happy to share with you that should help enlighten you on uninterrupted Alurian biology and our known capabilities. Over dinner.”
And then he gently slides his glasses back on, looks right at Tony like his eyes can crack his chest open and examine his insides and asks the two questions that will haunt the rest of his life.
Okay, kind of amazing actually, like creamy peanut butter and spicy chilies with a hint of ginger. And fish! Not any fish that Tony was familiar with but buttery and tantalizing in the best way.
Oh boy... this was, this was heavy. Suddenly it was hard to breathe. Tony just had not been prepared for the weight of this. Not at all.
Natasha shrugged.
Tony is nine when his tutor makes him eat soap after he starts reciting the entire textbook in Latin.
And speaking of Pepper, that was the moment the original bossy red head in charge of cramming good sense into his skull, decided to put in her two cents.
Dad was different than she remembered him, a little rawer, rougher around the edges, and his tech was severely outdated, but going toe to toe with him and her aunt and uncles was still no picnic. That and it was pretty much the worst thing ever to trade blows with the same people she just wanted to rip her mask off and beg to take care of her. So yeah. No more of that please and thanks.
Tony had caught it too apparently.
We don’t believe it.
“You heard the man. Miss Hannagan is looking for you little runts and I have work to do.”
The pain swells and Tony hears screaming, tastes bile and blood in his mouth. His head is a consuming storm of memories that rather than distract from the pain only seem to add to it.
had a child, they’d come for it. They’d never stop coming.
They feel like family, but that is just outdated instructions talking.
Tuesday nights the kats in their department gather in their apartment because they are the only one’s without a live-in handler. There are three of them in the entire department so they are close. Necessity will do that but Amory is the one they think they would have been close with under any circumstances.
“Be that as it may, Sir, you did promise to take caution. Perhaps it would be prudent to seek professional advice on the matter?”
So given that there was a feral tom running around outfitted with foreign tech, making minced salad out of Tony's enemies, you’d think there would at least be a wanted poster stuck somewhere; but here they are in America, land of " the domesticated kat is a happy kat", and there are nothing but crickets from SHIELD and strangely none of the press has so much as printed a word about the guy.
"I have every right." Tony snapped viciously, stepping equally close, hands curled tightly into fists. "Did you forget what we're all doing here Captain? This is the Avengers Pride isn't it? Pretty sure I read the label and it named me Queen."
You see what I mean about this guy? How’s a person supposed to run a company, a Pride, and still have time for all the sex they need to have?
Technically, Tony knew it was an under suit not dissimilar to the one Tony was wearing under his armor but if being a member of the club didn’t come with the right to tease then he didn’t know what would. The three female body guards on the other hand had stripped out of their sleek form hugging dresses straight down to their underwear.
Hughard finishes his breakfast the next morning and grunts as he wipes his mustache with his napkin. Tony doesn't look up, because the chances of Hughard talking to him are slim and even if he were, it would only mean that Hughard had decided to punish him after all.
“Hello Bruce.” She returned with a small quirk of lips.
YOU COULD ALWAYS DO IT.
The kits whiskers twitched as his eyes lit up with excitement, his honey brown tail swishing behind him and over on the couch Natasha made a small sound of amusement.
"And to seek a favor, I imagine." The woman purred dangerously, and Tony stepped forward. The guardsman hissed threateningly at him and he rolled his eyes, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender.
Steve had thought that if this was Pride, if they could all just stay exactly as they were right in that moment, then he never wanted to let it go.
“Why didn’t she tell me? Why didn’t
“Then I’ll come find you.” He promised. “I’ll always be able to find you. You know how I know?”
A low snarl slipped past Tony's lips and it was only the gentle grip Natasha took of his elbow that halted the vicious words that wanted to leap off of his tongue.
But reality had intruded on their little love nest in the form of their worried teammates who were all up and about, and finding reasons to linger on the common floor in wait for Tony and Steve to emerge from the penthouse.  After a while the constant tug of worry in the back of Tony’s mind had become too distracting.
The couple beside them at the bar for instance when they ordered their drinks looked stupidly happy, like propaganda piece 'love is love' stupidly happy. As happy as Tony felt. The woman, a cute young kitten with her brown hair done up in some truly impressive ringlets leaned across the bar to shout at them over the music.
“You’re not suggesting we do what they did?” Jaime asked, sounding suitably appalled by the idea and Nyota quickly shook her head, narrowing her eyes at him in affront.
"I don't understand. What was all of that?! Was it Extremis?"
A warning in this chapter for mentions of attempted non-con. It's very slight, only spoken of in memory, but the more you know.
Silence, was the only return and Tony cursed beneath his breath.
“I alerted you exactly five times Sir that Mr. Debar was on his way. Perhaps if you were better rested you would not so frequently zone out your surroundings.”
“Who the hell do you think you are?” Mrs. Keener who was visibly shaking with fury spat, pointing one wrinkled finger in his direction.
Some memories are better left buried.
Steve had been awake in the twenty-first century for about ten months and the voice in his head that yearned for Bucky so badly (so darkly) had not gone away. It had gotten so bad that Steve couldn't even eat without remembering how Bucky would never enjoy another meal because Steve had failed him, so that the food started to taste like ash in his mouth.
Natasha pressed a soft kiss to the top of his head and Tony purred.
Ricochet, you take your aim
Whatever comeback Tony would have made was not to be, for at that moment the horn sounded, signaling that the hunt was about to begin.
It meant 'and boldly we go into the black'.
It wasn’t perfect, but sometimes that was just how life was.
Steve couldn't finish. It doesn't matter because the memory is haunting him, so strongly that Tony almost doesn't even have to reach, it's pushing itself forward, begging to be looked at.
The option to retrieve it and blow the dust off is always there. For instance, he has no trouble recalling that barrette in his mother’s hair the day he was born, as well as the overwhelming cacophony of loud breathes and booming voices that had assaulted him from all angles and made him numb with his very first recognizable emotion. Gutless terror.
Hopefully. Maybe she was that pissed at him.
He's fifteen when he figures out what the big deal with sex is. But those are other memories for other times.
. You gave me a home.” Steve raised Tony’s hand – there were a lot of people touching his hands today, he thought, and just as quickly he thought of Queen Bastet watching them, telling them that the future was in the hands of the builders, wishing them sure hands. Steve pressed a kiss against his wrist, breath warm and moist against the sensitive skin. Tony bit back a sob as relief and elation flooding through him as Steve whispered urgently, wiping at the tears that were sliding down his cheeks out of nowhere. Crying definitely had not been on the menu. When had he started doing that?
"Tony are you alright?" Cap asked, unaware of the silent exchange, hand reaching toward him like he might gently grip his elbow and Tony shrugged out of range. He couldn't handle being touched just then.
“You mean leaving Harley with my mother.” Jena stated evenly, Tony would give her this, she had grit but that just made him angrier truth be told. Because where was that grit when it had mattered?
She rose silently and even as she signaled for the servers to sweep back in and they came, bearing large steaming cauldrons of the bone broth that MiKall had described to them so many hours ago, her voice went hissing through his thoughts like a cold wind one last time.
"How have I lied to you?" Steve laughed over the music pulling Tony back in tight, grinning down at him all smug and Tony would be pissed if he weren't having such a great time.
"Are you trying to win something or are you naturally this stupid?" Tony sneers and he can hear Yinsen release a small moan of dismay. With more assurance than he feels, Tony stares the police officer down, whose lip has curled into a snarl.
“Amory, the portal!” Riri screams, and their cousin Amory’s fingers fly over the controls of the teleportation device that they and the T’Challa of this earth have been working to repair. If it works the way it should, a portal between here and somewhere else should open up just long enough for the ARK to escape the destruction of this earth. If it doesn’t, then they die.
Steve’s gut clenched. He Turned his head slightly to glance at Natasha who nodded, traded a brief look with Clint and took off with a bounding leap, using the archer’s cupped hands as a springboard to launch herself gracefully into the air. She latched onto the ceiling with her claws and used them to crawl over the heads of the crowd, bits of plaster and dust falling in trail behind her. She’s really something, Natasha. Even in the middle of a battle, Steve couldn’t help but appreciate her skill.
, over a stupid thing like a glimpse into another reality where Bucky had lived and Tony was some sort of beloved uncle figure. Why risk what they were building over a something that didn’t matter in the long run and would only hurt him?
As Tony strode into the room his eyes naturally went first to the table surrounded by chairs in the center of the room, only to find them empty. Movement drew his eyes to the long windows where the young woman standing by the windows looking out over the city with her back to the door had turned to watch him approach.
Tony's stomach churned, the smile becoming more fixed on his face.
"Don't worry about it.” Sam assured him with an indulgent smile. “With all the ways this could have played out, it's just nice to see so much good coming out of it."
“Luke!” Clint crowed, abandoning the group by the punchbowl, had loped his way over to the tom and swung an arm around his neck in the universally understood language of Bro-dom. “Come remind my anal retentive partner how high the tolerance level for an adult Kat is.”
They knew enough about bonds now that there was no point in hiding from that truth, however uncomfortable. Steve still yearned for his first mate. They were still reaching for each other on that separate plane, across time and space. Anyone else but Tony would have cut and run rather than try and compete with that. He didn’t have to be in a relationship with Steve to care about him or bury their hatchets, but Tony, stubbornly, had decided he wanted to have it all.
It was easier to get caught up in the bright whirlwind nature of the kid’s thoughts, but it wasn’t safe to get inside the kids head. It was bad enough Harley was involved in their mess as it was, Tony couldn’t further screw up his life by accidently screwing with his head in ways he might not be able to repair.
“I was harder on you than was probably fair. You have an entire nation that is depending on you, not to mention loyalty to your Pride. Besides,” Tony grinned. “Nothing settles a bruised ego like a good old fashioned fight. Can’t say I wasn’t thrilled when you offered to be my punching bag.”
It struck the post just as Clint landed, sending the structure wobbling and the athletic tom scrambling to stick his landing.
"If we're done here-"
But that was a journey for later. The three of them were going to survive, and that meant for a little while longer at least the only thing he had to follow was orders.
Calm settling over him he walked toward the front of the house, senses focused on the sound of the booted feet and harsh breathing of his prey.
"More flings?" Luke muttered beneath his breath but Tony was too busy to check for judgment because there was the mystery of Maya's sudden appearance and the fact that he didn't give a shit.
This close it was easy to see the flecks of amber and the deep swirls of marron in the tom’s eye. He’d been fascinated by them the night they’d met, Tony remembered. Even in shock he’d noticed how arresting they were, like the stare of a jungle cat.
“I’m thinking enough room for an air strip away from the housing.”
Tony was running images nabbed from the security cameras of Wanda’s face through every corner of the internet; every email, hub, archive, and storage bank that he could crack into. So far nothing, but the search continued in the background. Maybe it was running so many background tasks at once, but the gentle knock on the door before Natasha pushed her way inside the hospital room actually managed to take Tony by surprise.
Steve looks like a child whose just been told he’s won Christmas for the rest of forever, eyes wide and sparkling as he asks all breathless, “Really?”
He’s fucking terrified. Okay? He’s terrified of how this ends if Barnes is too far gone to be helped. Because Tony has it within him to put the man down, but he was afraid of what it would cost.
Bruce and Clint were both sporting reindeer antlers on top of their heads to match their fuzzy brown sweaters and Thor wore a matching costume with Harley. Tony meanwhile was sitting comfortable in a pearly white suit, his customer designed white shades tucked artfully into his hair.
“Your heart rate has elevated sir and your core temperature has spiked. Do be careful.” Jarvis warned.
Clint seemed to agree with him, whistling low as he too gapped at the medic.
“Sure you’re comfortable leaving them alone?” Clint asked, surprised that Tony would even make such a move.
There's a smell to domesticated gata that still makes Tony shudder at times. They were always just that bit sour in his nose.
Self-imprisonment is the strongest kind there is.
But that was okay, it would give the others time to get into more defensible positions.
They are his contract. His reminder. His self-made shackles. After the fact he never remembers the words themselves, just the feeling of his mind turning on him. Until now.
And then a very pretty and very bored voice asked, "Is there a Queen among you?"
Guy had a point there, Tony thought as he pulled away with a purr, nuzzling Bruce’s cheek once more before finally releasing him. He supposed releasing him was the polite thing to do.
Over the com-line he heard Tony snuffle a snort and chuckle. Steve bit his lip to keep from grinning. A dick joke in the middle of a fight. Stark was really rubbing off on him.
And there it was. Confirmation of what he’d already suspected. T’Challa hadn’t taken seduction off the table as a negotiation tactic. What was it he’d said?
"Don't think I'm finished with you either Barton. I see the way you're moving that arm."
“Maybe we can’t,” Nyota admitted. “But maybe dad and the others can. We just have to plant the right seeds.”
He had never been able to shake the memories of his first disastrous heat and the events surrounding it.
“He doesn’t know what he’s doing.” Tony reminded them both. He wasn’t a fucking saint. That shit had hurt, and he was tempted to call for a round two and show Winter Kitty a thing or two about how much he didn’t appreciate being shot at, but that wouldn’t help any of them in the long run.
“Just so long as Donny Kepple continues to invest in Maria's House, his mother can rub what she likes.” Tony answered dryly and the smile in Natasha's eyes disappeared.
Chuckling into his glass Tony suddenly had the most brilliant idea.
"I am his son" Luke answered as if that should explain everything.
He needed to get those ducks in their rows first.
Friends were good. So much more than he'd ever expected. So much more than he deserved, a familiar voice (sounding a shit ton like his dear departed not-father) whispered. Only that wasn't right was it? They wouldn't all be here, weathering out his moods and respecting his conditions if they didn't want to be. Steve definitely wouldn't be. Not unless he saw something worth sticking around for.
screaming trough him as Steve’s breath hitched and he pulled back in shock, just enough to peer down at Tony with wide blue eyes.
And why should he be embarrassed? They’re his equals after all. The only difference between him and them is he gets paid for the use of his body.
JARVIS stressed the word ‘promised’ – because he was an engineered spoil sport – and Tony couldn’t help the uncomfortable guilt he felt, or remembering holding T’Challa’s hand and breathing in his scent while he’d made said promise.
“The Kat-People’s home world?” Clint echoed his surprise and Thor nodded.
“Hello, Ayeba.”
"Yep." He popped the P with a smile. "Just give him a squeeze and he'll phone home."
“Your Highness, welcome to the United States.” Everette stepped forward as the tom and his entourage reached the welcoming party and greeted them loudly enough so that there was no confusion for the rest of the crowd that the serious faced Gata male standing before them really was the prince they’d all been waiting for.
Bruce was frowning at one of the monitors and Helen, who was watching another, noted with a small betraying hitch in her breath, “Patient’s core temperature just spiked.”
There. The buffet block looked to be made of thick steel. It wasn’t perfect but it was going to have to do.
"No offense," Cap said slowly and Tony saw Clint roll his eyes. He bit back a huff of laughter, because he agreed with the sentiment. Anytime someone started a sentence off with 'no offense' the chances of something offensive following increased by at least ninety percent.
Tony didn’t know what to say immediately. His thoughts racing as he considered the conundrum before him. He’d not been expecting T’Challa to give him a gift, especially something so obviously priceless. But maybe he should have expected it. He remembered what T’Challa had told them in the kitchen that morning when he’d brought Tony soup. Courting he’d called it. Because buttering up the Queen was standard protocol for getting what you wanted out of them wasn’t it?
One of the back doors was open, a line of them holding guns were stationed in wait by a loading truck. One glance inside at the cages stacked on top of each other and Tony saw red.
“That’s barely a year from now.” Billy pointed out, blinking his eyes open sleepily. “It’s still going to happen right?”
It reminded him of his childhood in a small way. Which normally Tony wouldn’t call a good thing, except the walks Jarvis used to take him on were some of the sweeter parts of the bittersweet. He does like it. He likes it enough that even though some jerk with a camera recognized them in their (rather ridiculous really) attempts to blend in with the crowds and snapped a picture of Steve plucking his sunglasses off of his face to steal a kiss off his laughing mouth and obviously sold it to the newspapers, Tony can’t regret anything. Not even his poor costume choice. Because it turns out that Steve was right and nobody but Tony Stark and someone trying to hide their face wears expensive aviators in wintertime. Who knew.
So this chapter didn't have a lot of Thor in it because Tony had some important pieces to push into motion but next up : It's Christmas and since Tony's fairly certain it's his last he just wants to spend it in peace, but Harley wants to build a snowman and the villains seem to be doing Holiday overtime. Catman keeps showing up and the only one more depressed than Tony this Christmas might actually be Steve. Turns out that 'Yule time'  is a pretty big deal for a certain thunder god and none of it will do. If ever Tony thought Thor was more brawn than brain, well he'd stand corrected.
Tony expects to watch the thief disappear out of sight but to his surprise the thief is suddenly stopped by a figure stepping in front of his path and the two bodies collide, wrestling each other to the ground.
“That’s the reason no one will buy you! You’re too damn attached. What’d I warn you about Becca! All that damn money to get you bred and the boy isn’t worth shit!” he is fond of shouting in drunken rages.
She and Clint had been called away suddenly on a mission for SHIELD, the highly-classified nature of which Tony was party to because Natasha at least, was officially a member of Pride Avengers and as part of a bonded trio, technically she belonged to him and Bruce and Fury had to ask before he borrowed.
She gave the aid a severe frown. Whether she didn’t like being given orders by an assistant on principle or whether it was because this particular assistant happened to be a kat, who knew, but Tony was just glad that she didn’t try and touch him again.
The fel on screen was young, pretty and mostly plastic, nothing like Stark, but something about hearing those words reminded him uncomfortably of Tony.
The light in the fog flickered, growing brighter as a room appeared around him. The den of a country home. Familiar.
“No way! How could you even ask me that? Who would do something like that?!”
“Lets get one thing straight shall we? That little trick you played? I get it. It’s not like we were best friends or some shit. It wasn’t personal and really Highness it’s no skin off my back.”
She said the name with a hitch, like it got caught somewhere between her heart and her throat and Steve wondered sadly who Ivan was. She didn’t leave him wondering long.
Good, Tony didn’t plan on waiting. It was always nice when he and Steve were on the same page.
Steve smiled, thinking about it as he wandered into the living room on the common floor. He paused to stare at the glowing lights on the tree, thinking fondly of Harley's excitement as it had been put up and decorated and the man who had made that possible for him.
“The object of simulation six is to take down the flagbearer of the opposing team. The flag bearers must stay on their designated castle mounts but are allowed to defend themselves and perform offensive strikes. All players may use any weapons of their choosing, but drawing blood is strictly prohibited and will result in an immediate loss for your team and termination of the simulation. The floor while cushioned is also metaphorical lava. Any player knocked back to the floor has suffered a violent fiery death and is effectively removed from further combat. Teams please choose your flagbearers.”
"Turn it off." Tony seethed, ears flattening against his skull. There was a black sort of rage simmering low in his stomach as the news clip continued.
"Nah, Luke's from the Congo" Clint yawned widely and smirked in Tony's direction. "He's heard all the stories about the old prides. He was probably expecting us to walk around with our claws out and have heads hanging off the mailbox or something."
His aunt and his uncle, nonna and nonno, their memories are few but they are treasured.
“No! No, it’s just that this is so cool. This is… this is –” Peter grappled for words and blinked away the onset of tears he’d just promised Tony weren’t coming – he refused to blubber like a helpless kitten in front of the guy who’d fought off terrorists and aliens. But it was clear now more than ever that a mistake had been made, and Peter just didn’t feel right, not telling him the truth.
"Mr. Stone and his companion insist on seeing you Sir. " JARVIS answered, switching to a better view so he could see the faces of both Ty and his female companion and Tony sucked in a breath slowly through his nose.
“If he was recovered by the soviets they would have seen the serum in his blood. They would have seen it as an opportunity to create a soldier of their own.”
His parents come home a few days later. Tony is in the kitchen, helping Ana with dinner when Hughard storms in. His heart sinks into his stomach with anxiety when Hughard’s eyes lock on him, bright with anger as he barks, “Come here Tony, let me have a look at you.”
Tony took a deep breath.
"Don’t."
The tom was suddenly just there in the doorway, removing some sort of earpiece from one ear.
“Tony!”
“Nyota, you’ve gotta keep your strength up. If you get sick we don’t have a doctor on board.”
Tony, reminded of why he was pissed, turned with everyone else to glare again at fury, a muscle in his jaw working as he clenched his teeth. Fury's expression remained stony but he hesitated, which told Tony that he definitely didn't want to answer that question and didn't appreciate being backed into a corner over it. He hissed low, and Pepper squeezed his arm again.
Tony didn’t need the glint of metal peeking out from under Barnes drooping right sleeve, or for the other kat to turn and look at him to know that it really was Barnes standing there. All those trips through Bucky’s memories and playing games of kat and mouse in his head had forged a link between them. Not a full bond by any means, but Tony would forever recognize the feel of Barnes’ mind. His distinct taste.
"Everyone is fine," Bruce interjected. " The seizures were minor. They could have done damage if prolonged but you sort of skipped around, always stopping just shy of doing real damage. It’s like you knew."
“We practice, Tony, so that we know what to expect on the field! We wouldn’t make that call in reality and we’re not making it in practice either.”
M.O.D.O.K was at the center of it all, giving orders, directing the yellow suited A.I.M. insurgents with cackling glee from atop his hover chair like some twisted version of Santa Clause, as he flew between buildings.
“Consuming the Benu provides one with sight. It is believed that after a few generations of consumption that the Kǫtrdýr developed the bonding abilities that were passed down to the Alurio but that was after hundreds of years. I must agree with Banner. Developing such a strong link to a stranger’s mind after only one consumption seems unlikely.”
IT IS SWEET THAT YOU THINK I NEED YOUR HELP LEAVING THE CRADLE, BUT I AM HAPPY TO PLAY THE PART ANYTIME YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING IT A TRY.
Tony swallowed and drew closer to him, reaching for his hands, needing the grounding contact as much as Steve seemed to. It was a testament to Tony’s innately selfish nature that even now, down to the last moment, there was a wild urge that flickered to life within him not to say what he had intended to say, to take Natasha’s advice and let the ticking time bomb that was the Winter Soldier stay in its corner; but he knew better.
This was an easy job, Natasha could already tell. The people who worked here relied too heavily on the secret nature of their operation and their defenses would be as easy to cut through as warm butter; but despite that she found it hard to relax.
She was wearing the uniform that allowed her to move with her tail out even though normally she liked to work tucked (one less appendage for an enemy to grab) because when it came to climbing the tail really did help, and she was confident enough in her ability to get in and out of the facility without being seen that she opted for the luxury over comfort.
Tony swallowed, feeling an odd sense of falling. He thought he had a pretty good idea of what Bruce was getting at.
He wasn’t in cardiac arrest, he was just having a panic attack. No Biggie.
Well, a higher grade of one anyway.
"But hey. Positive thinking right? I'm gonna be fine and when it's all over, we're all going to sit down and have another one of these great family talks." Tony squeezed him encouragingly and Bruce chuckled, somewhat thinly.
Natasha got stiller and Steve’s shoulders tensed, but he nodded, glancing to Natasha for confirmation. The fel woman just swished her tail, as if the morning were like any other, and they weren’t about to embark on a quest to draw out a deadly assassin.
He blinked away the betraying prick of tears, recognizing the new hands on his shoulders as belonging to Bruce which was the only reason he didn’t hiss and spit and try and claw at him like he had the others.
Riri was her girl, through thick and thin, but she’d never let Nyota live it down. Ever since that tiny incident when she’d bit Anna Jones after she’d bragged to everyone how Jaime had complimented her stupid new bow, Riri liked to act like trying to gnaw another little girls face off meant Nyota had some giant crush on him or something. She’d been seven okay!
“You’re going to die of stupidity,” she said, almost sadly, but Tony just grinned, because everybody knows in former assassin that just meant I love you.
"They're Jews Tony and they're speaking a kind of Hebrew, it's... well, long ago our people only spoke Hebrew but we've traveled far since them. Sometimes two languages meet and decide they might as well be friends, so one asks the other for a dance."
Pepper didn’t even dignify that with a retort, making a droll face before her screen blanked out and JARVIS stopped the projection.
Steve's head was a graveyard, full of dark spots and broken networks. Watching the lights slowly power on in brighter and brighter bursts was one of the most beautiful and humbling things Tony had ever witnessed.
“What?” Peter asked hesitantly.
Two things are needed. Heat and the built in biological trigger for his body to start ovulating. Now domestic male felines have barbs on their penises that flip the switch, which thank god is not the case in Gata. Instead, there is a small gland at the back of a fels neck that normally is only a small swell on the back of the neck, but becomes tender and enflamed during heat.
"What? When?" Clint was the first to demand looking shocked and slightly hurt, likely that he hadn't been told before now.
It had been a toss up between sending him or Natasha and Clint had wondered at first why he'd won out over her, because Clint was a good spy but Natasha was the spy and it was clear from the beginning that The Stark Job was too important to fuck up.
“Yeah, you are.” Steve smiled at him, it was full of pain, but pride and admiration too. Gratefulness. Tony leaned into him, let the taller man wrap his arms around him.
would always be one and the same.
Getting the message out to the team was as simple as connecting to JARVIS’ server, which was only a matter of accessing the internet with his brain. Crazy right? But stranger things were already happening. But AIM would find their tracks long before the team would get there. So he needed that repulsor and he didn’t have time to properly fix the mangled reactor in order to use it as a power source.
Fuck. So this wasn't good.
“Run.”
But his attention was snagged by a sudden clatter at the end of the hall and a frightened scream.
But there he was, coming toward her against the odds proving once more that the only certain thing was uncertainty.
They’d taken a bad hit during their mission to VIXON. The ark wasn’t as big as the hellicarrier dad had once built for SHIELD. There was just enough space for a few sleeping quarters, a canteen and some lab space.
Tony nodded distractedly as the tom turned to make his way to the exit, passing Steve with a nod of acknowledgment as the super soldier made his way toward Tony.
“Wise what?” The Colonel put his throat on display by taking the bait, not because he didn’t understand Tony’s games, but because they held an unspoken understanding that he would play them in exchange for the temporal institution of intimacy.
Steve looked like he wanted to believe, Tony could see the desperate hope creeping into his gaze, but he was too afraid to.
“Your Papa said all that about me?” Tony asked, ten shades weirded out by the thought and ten humbled. He knew he’d done some good things for Gata over the years, but he also knew it wasn’t nearly enough and that plenty of kats looked down on him for rocking the boat. Bad kitty. So Tony never took it for granted that for a few, he was a hero and a role model.
The Avengers are a pride and considering that this is America land of the free (unless you happen to be feline) where gata are required to be domesticated (with a few special exceptions) and it's impossible to live without a master, it's safe to say that prides are mostly a thing for the history books.
“There was a break in at Oscorp” one of the guests, a man Steve didn’t recognize turned to them.  He had his phone in his hand, playing a news clip for the people closest to him.
Her blue eyes watched the area where three older kits played in the surf, all relatively close in age. Tony's eyes were drawn to the only girl in the trio. There were wet clumps of sand drying in the little girl's frizzy ringlets, largely because she and an older boy were engaged in a war that seemed to involve trying to shove sand down each other's throats and god was she lovely. Her warm honey brown skin was only getting darker under the bright sun, which was beginning to streak her wind-tossed mass of curls.
“Any luck questioning ViXon employees?” he asked, and Steve replied.
THEY APPEAR TO BE TRAINED IN THE MARTIAL ART OF ỌRUNIYAN… AMONG OTHER THINGS. AT THE CORE OF ỌRUNIYAN IS THE BELIEF THAT THE ANIMAL WHO LEAVES THE GROUND FIRST MOVES FROM THE HUNTED TO THE HUNTER.
On the other hand if he refused to help, Tony would only become more suspicious of Wakanda's involvement in their strange enemies sudden appearance.  He was well aware that he was pinning the tom between a rock and a hard place. He was banking on it.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s chest and shot him a look.
"Vonkov isn't coming back." Hughard bites off with a snarl and Tony flinches. "It's time you learnt a thing or two about the weaponry anyway. But this contract is worth a great deal of money, so you do as you're told and mind that tongue of yours or I'll give you a whipping you won't forget. You hear me boy?"
Natasha was a harder read. She was too good to let it show, but she had a weakness now. The careful way she held her emotions in check, effectively erecting a wall of silence between their minds was a tell all of its own. The bond was constant, which meant it was nearly impossible to keep that sort of blankness up twenty-four-seven. The fact that it was there at all told Tony enough.
“We.” Natasha flicked her tail in irritation, her ears twitching atop her head as she lifted Tony’s eyes to hers by the hand sunk in his hair. “We try and bring him back. As a team. As a family. It is not all on you, or Steve, though he’ll think that it is.”
“Nyota, no scratching.” They reprimand without much heat because the girl is already curling into a ball and falling back asleep.
Tony Stark, billionaire, philanthropist, and reformed playboy (thank you very much) doing  here you ask? Here being  a dirt road in the middle of Georgia instead of tucked into his luxurious bed beside his smoking hot fiancé eating flavored ice chips off his chest .  Or
It was trying to figure out what was going on in that head of his that made Steve so nervous.
"Couldn't sleep?" Tony asked, already suspecting the answer and Steve nodded.
“Amory’s fifteen,” Jamie rejoined with an eye roll of his own. “And you know how sensitive he is. He’s got enough pressure on him already.”
Stark. Avenger. Queen. He wasn’t stopping until they were dead.
He rushed Clint like a linebacker and grabbed ahold of him, and for one terrified moment Clint imagines being stabbed or otherwise impaled, but the guy just heaves and threw Clint clear across the room straight through a glass set of doors. As pain splintered through his back Clint was thankful for Tony’s obsession with glassy things.
“Bucky don’t say that!” Steve’s attention snapped back to Bizzaro Barnes, voice cracking like his heart was breaking all over again (it is) but Bucky just talked over him.
There was a flurry of movement within the crowd and then a low ripple of sound as the tenor of the voices surrounding them rose in confusion. The hair on the back of Steve’s neck rose at the sudden spike in tension and he felt Tony go tense in his arms. Battle ready, he thought fleetingly.
“In the barn?” The kid shook his head, mouse brown hair flopping as he shrugged. “Only when Mom’s not home, otherwise I stay in the house with her and old Mrs. Keener. Dad used to stay with me so I didn’t get scared but when grandpa died Mrs. Keener sold him. That was six years ago.”
The tom's dark eyes moved from the other fel and landed on Tony like a ton of bricks, piercing and so full of heavy meaning that Tony had to fight not to shrink away from it.
She might have all of his weaknesses catalogued and his patterns memorized, but she wasn’t really
"Being here with you, and on this team, I guess part of me started to really believe that the future I'd imagined was gone might not be, and I got ahead of myself. It's been a long time since I've had anything like real hope in that area.
Far from giving up the old chase, they were trying with renewed vigor to gain control of the Iron Man armor. They were pushing the angle that leaving a highly lethal weapon in the control of an unstable being was by definition negligent, and that the obvious solution was to appoint a human handler from the military to supervise. To sweeten the poisoned apple, they were suggesting James Rhodes for the job.
“Is it part of your methodology to deny them their heritage?” Prince T’Challa pulled all of the eyes at their table to him, and the conversations at the other tables seemed to be dying off as well. No one had actually dared to try serving the visiting royal in a pet dish so he was paused with fork in hand, midway through puncturing another bite of fish off his plate. He sounded pleasantly curious as he continued.
brains.” She insisted. “Gata. They’re so resilient. My uncle, he was experimented on. The humans nearly broke him.”
Tony knew it was and in that moment he could see it in Steve's eyes, the slow acceptance of that very truth.
"Did I say army?" Tony feigned surprise. "I meant security officers. The island will need them. We can't have flesh sharks and rival tech company’s buzzing around trying to steel either our tech or vulnerable citizens can we."
"The Captain insisted that Stark was still fit for battle and assured me that if there reached a point where he felt that was no longer true that Stark would be benched until such a time as a cure for the virus could be found." Coulson answered in his usual calm way but Tony turned and blinked at him as if he'd stood up and shouted.
“Okay.” Steve’s voice was oddly quiet within the room, raspy and breathless, but his eyes were drinking him in with amazement. Tony purred louder in satisfaction and pulled Steve’s mouth back to his.
Tony nods wordlessly, too wary of being struck to give a repeat performance. His backside already hurts so much he’s sure he’ll cry and he won’t do that in front of Hughard. Not anymore.
"It. All of it." Luke grinned at him with some of the whitest teeth Clint had ever seen, completely shit eating and Clint relaxed, rolling his eyes at the lame joke.
He cringed at the deep bloody gashes that seemed to magically appear across his once friend's torso and the gurgled cry of pain Ty let loose as the other tom spun and his barbed tail whipping his barbed tail across his enemies neck almost dismissively.
“If something were to happen to me before you and your brother are grown, it would fall to your uncle to lead our people. And he would do it well, because he was not a foolish kit who thought that being a mighty Alurio meant he could skip out on his lessons. Have you heard me?”
Tony dragged his head up and blinked owlishly as the familiarity in that obnoxious drawl fully sank in. He’d been so busy drinking in the blessedly cool waves of air washing over his face, that it took him a moment to realize he recognized his rescuer. They hadn't gone to high school together because Tony's a genius and graduated when he was fourteen years old, but Tony had hung around with the local football team because... actually no. Nope. Best not to go down that road.
He had not been as keen on stars in his youth as his brother, but Thor had often joined Loki on the roof of the turret to provide him company. He'd seen how often alone Loki was, even amongst their many friends and admirers. One could not call themselves a Prince of Asgard without acquiring a constant stream of hangers on, but with hindsight it was easy to see all the ways in which Loki had been subtly ostracized and made to feel the difference of his birth.
Tony might be a feral Queen and the CEO of a billion dollar company, as well as one of the leading voices on Gata rights, but every now and then a fellow just wanted to feel a bit like Scarlet Ohara and have someone who made their stomach do the wibblies turn a bit pink while asking for permission to touch them. So sue him.
Tony grins and Mama narrows her eyes in warning, but Tony can tell she's already holding back a smile even as she warns.
“More in a fish mood Buddy. Lets go with the smoked tuna and fries from Han’s Fish Fry, skip the green stuff. Order extras for the moochers.”
Bucky whirls on him, teeth flashing in the dark as he growls.
"I find that hard to believe. I'm a one of a kind darling."
Her thoughts interrupted his as her mouth pulled into a disapproving frown.
"Yeah. Thanks... not my favorite way to travel."
"You forget to whom you speak." A low growl ripped out of Catman's throat and Steve's heated blue eyes flew to him with barely checked rage.
Fair warning: hearts are gonna get a bit messy here on out. No way around it. Expect many changes from canon. The only promise I make is that the Avengers Pride comes out strong on the other side, there's another wedding and somebody has a baby.
They went through a couple of the simulations that Tony had programed and when Clint still looked like he had a few rounds left in him, Steve took him through his paces.
As usual Luke held himself proudly and Tony looked on as he somehow made the act of shrugging out of that atrocious coat look graceful and choreographed.
“Yeah. My dad was a scientist. He even got his doctorate after they ruled that exceptional Kat’s could be considered.” Peter felt himself blushing, even as he continued to smile hesitantly at Mr. Stark. Dad had always told him that it was because of Tony Stark that Kat’s had started being admitted into colleges, and had gained access to high level certification programs. He used to read to Peter from Forbes and other journals about all of Tony’s accomplishments. He’d always said, that it was worth putting up with the bullies and the snobs at school because one day Peter could do great things too and help make things even better for other kids.
Ty took a step closer but halted at Tony's hardening stare.
It turns out Rubber Guys aren’t just raiding any old shelter at the ass crack of morning. If they had been, SHIELD would have handled it on their own, because funny looking guys with guns weren’t exactly the sort of threats Fury had in mind when he’d started the Pride initiative.
“Focus on the task. You can’t help Stark if your head isn’t in the game.”
He makes Tony get up, tells him to write on the chalkboard 'A nasty tempered Jew, comes to no good', over and over until he is satisfied that the message has sunk in.
“You can’t move it there, Steve. That is totally not a move!”
"You sure that's what you really want Cap? I'm not easy to love."
It was the video sample from the single interview the Wakandain king had given after the country had been discovered. The one where he'd basically told the U.N. to fuck off and leave them alone. Although it had been over a decade since then Tony seriously doubted the King of Wakanda had graduated to dressing up in costume and following the Avengers around New York for the hell of it.
"Ouch." Bruce hissed, dropping the remote. Tony scrambled for it, inadvertently (or perhaps not) kneeing him in the groin. Clint tensed, but Bruce just shook his head, a small smile tugging at his mouth. Tony's tail was already curling tighter around Bruce's as if to make up for it, and he didn't feel even a hint of anger at the shenanigans.
And Ty had played him like a fiddle for years, until Tony had unraveled everyone's grand plans by refusing to get pregnant. He'd seen the real Ty then.
“Already ahead of you honey bear. He’s got a mother here in New York and a brother in the air force.”
Amory - Of Avengers Pride
“Hey Buddy,” Steve chuckles and when the child signals for up he complies, lifting the boy effortlessly into his arms. Jaime promptly buries his face against his father’s neck and mumbles.
Thank you guys SO much for all your comments last week, I was so pleasantly surprised. This is my first time writing anything not strictly Steve/Tony so there's some nerves involved with setting up their relationship for possible failure without making somebody hateable. Hopefully they come across as bumbling boys just... well bumbling.
Wanda looks to her brother with worry. Pietro shrugs before getting up to follow him.
“Be careful of Captain Rogers. He is a good man, but he is not for you.”
“It’s still that way in Wakanda isn’t it? You’ve got the kat-gene so I take it the Queen has a sweet touch.”
It is not either Wanda or Pietro’s first mission, but it is by far the most important objective they have ever been given. Their performance on the field this time around will determine their usefulness to the empire. Their failure will result in termination. The thought brings a tightness to his chest, a dark coiling feeling of dread.
“Ny… we’re smart, I know we are, but this is kind of above our pay grade.” Riri hedged, looking crestfallen. “I don’t know if we could get it right even with eighteen years to work on it. We’re still learning and where are we going to find someone to teach us all the stuff we still don’t know?”
Barnes. He was talking about Barnes. Tony knew it.
Tony took them deeper, taking more, coaxing with every movement of lip, and Steve’s hands gripped his waist and held tight; and just like that the kiss went from something controlled to something desperate burgeoning with all their pent up emotions.
Wordlessly Steve reached over to turn off the stove and Tony took his hand drawing him towards the bedroom. When they were inside and Steve had closed the door behind them he turned into his arms, and just as before Steve met him as if he’d anticipated the move. They moved in sync, extensions of each other and Tony purred in delight as Steve’s warm mouth moved against his, pouring out his passion.
