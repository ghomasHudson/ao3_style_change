“SHIELD’s compromised. By HYDRA. Most of it’s corrupt—Rumlow, Pierce, Stern. You can trust Clint, Nat, Fury, and Maria—Hill, that is—and I’m pretty sure that’s it. You gotta—you can’t do anything drastic, alright, Rogers? You gotta trust me.”
Tony had been angry at first. He had stormed out of the room when Steve told him, gone down to the lab, and blown up half of the prototypes that he had on his workbench. He still wasn’t sure exactly how he felt about it: it was less of a conscious feeling than a mixture of resentment, grief, anger, but also pity and empathy.
“Just send them to the Arctic!” Sam said. “There’s got to be a spot where the weapons can’t reach anyone of interest to Insight just in case they come back online.”
Steve sprinted, counting the seconds before Bucky could get to his feet and pull out his gun. He punched in the override code to access the satellite chips and ripped it out as quickly as he could.
JARVIS told him that the Mandarin was broadcasting from Miami, then continued, “Sir, there is… other news.”
He knew, obviously, that it was possible that he and Steve could be an item. Their future selves had dated each other, broken up, and then gotten back together. It was obviously feasible, but future Thor had warned that their timeline had already branched off into an alternate universe. While it was good that the space-time continuum hadn’t been destroyed, it also meant that there was no guarantee that they would get together at all.
Natasha leapt into the narrow gap. Clint stared wide-eyed at a flickering image of Coulson’s face, reading NEUTRALIZED.
Tony flicked his fingers in the pattern that he’d designed to turn on the pieces of the suit, and sure enough, the jets on the various fragments powered up. “Initialize sequence.”
“Just stick Loki down there for a few days,” Stark suggested, then smirked. “Let him cool down a little.”
“What have you done today?” Tony asked incredulously, but then Steve began to shift next to him as though to get up with him. “Not you too!”
Low blow. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that he didn’t have an enhanced body that healed shit in like three hours. He told Steve as much, and he huffed with laughter. “Sorry.”
Days later, after his mother’s and Loki’s deaths, Thor asked again. Odin looked at him blankly, like he had no idea what Thor was talking about, and suggested he take some time off.
i solemmly promise that i will try my utmost to have another chapter up as timely as possible, and it will NOT be another six months. thank you everyone <3
A Stark hadn’t given up on Steve after seventy years. Steve wouldn’t give up on another Stark after less than a day.
They tracked down Thanos fairly quickly for a ‘technologically inferior’ civilization, in the words of Thor, Carol, and the raccoon. It ended up being a simple algorithm designed to track the Stones’ energy signatures. Once he used the Gauntlet again (which didn’t take long, unsurprisingly), they had a lock on his location and they were gunning it for some random planet in the ‘Nova Corps,’ whatever that meant.
“You bought more of Disney,” said Bruce, who had arrived sometime during the night and was already bullying Tony.
Steve smiled at him, and it was warm, huge, and happy. Tony basked in that warmth for a moment before Steve said, “You’re going to bed.”
“You’ll pay,” she spat, and shot a hand toward Thor. A stream of red, glowing energy collided with Thor’s head in the same moment that Natasha came from the shadows and jammed the girl in the neck with her Widow’s Bites.
He and Natasha moved in sync: she shot the glass of the adjacent room and he grabbed her and hurled them both through it just as the bomb detonated.
“They were delayed after the… electrical incident with the generators and Mr. Odinson,” JARVIS reported, an ounce of hesitation in his voice to presumably emphasize the absurdity of that fiasco. “They will be finishing tomorrow.”
Steve stared at the phone for one long moment, CALL FAILED blinking on the screen, then he numbly returned his attention to the TV.
“Steve,” Tony called cheerily, pressing the trigger to inject another one of his nanites into his forearm. “
A year after Thor left, the Avengers had expanded into an even larger family unit all contained in Tony’s Tower, and he wasn’t even mad about it.
“Okay,” Tony breathed out, clenching his fingers forcefully around his upper arms to still their shaking. “Okay."
Fifteen minutes later, they were driving up some freeway that Steve didn’t know—Sam was in the drivers seat, a consequence of his experience in DC and Steve’s lack thereof. Natasha and Clint sat in the back, Sitwell wedged in between them. Neither Clint nor Sitwell seemed particularly pleased with that arrangement, but Natasha was unflappable as ever.
“You never look bad,” Steve said almost immediately, then blushed when Tony raised an eyebrow at him. Bruce muffled a laugh behind his hand, but ignored Tony’s glare.
Trevor’s information turned out to have practically nothing useful in it, as it was interspersed with cheers for some inane soccer team that Tony had never bothered to pay attention to. Something about a big boat and the coast.
“Get out of the country, for starters,” Steve snapped. Natasha and Clint were both smirking, and Steve jerked his hand over his throat in the universal
She turned her head to look, which was good, as his unwitting accomplice had just confirmed that she was coherent. “I’m gonna swing by, you’re just gonna grab him,” he continued as though it were the easiest thing in the world. “You got it?”
Tony groaned, but Steve sat forwards. Tony quietly mourned the removal of the warmth against his side, but Steve didn’t seem to notice. “What could HYDRA do with the Scepter?” Steve asked worriedly. “It already has mind controlling powers, could it… do something else?”
“Great,” Natasha said dryly. The rest of them shifted uncomfortably, and Tony was reminded of whispers of
really leaving, and it hit him harder than he’d expected. He watched as the two Thors converged on each other, the younger one asking a muted question and older Thor’s face falling. He said something that Steve didn’t catch, something that looked like a warning or a piece of advice from the way that his counterpart’s shoulders slumped.
There was a sound of glass shattering and metal crumpling, and when Steve walked into the kitchen the next morning like nothing was amiss, there was a poorly-concealed hole punched through the wall. Stark, when he came into the kitchen, had dark circles under his eyes, and when he saw the damage that Rogers had done, he stiffened, pressed a hand against his chest, and fled the room.
“Wild ride,” Stark said, but he was pale and his dark eyes were dancing almost nervously. He wouldn’t meet Steve’s gaze. “Um, shall we meet our...selves?”
“What’s questionable about electricity?” he burst out, his breathing stuttering for the nth time. “Oh, God, not again.”
For a moment, Thor’s vision flickered, and he saw Hlidskjalf in pieces, scattered across the throne room, the ceiling mosaic haloed around the ruined gold. Atop it lay Loki, his skin tinged purple, neck at an awkward angle, eyes bulging, and Thor swayed forwards a step.
“What’s the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?” he asked, because he knew JARVIS was coming.
“Thirty seconds, tops—” Natasha began, then froze. Steve spun just in time to see Batroc hurl a grenade and bolt out the door.
“Sir,” JARVIS said suddenly. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’ve compiled a list of likely locations for the Scepter have been moved to. I’ve also discovered evidence of tampering with the tracker as long ago as three weeks after the invasion.”
Harley asked him if he was having another attack, then defensively told Tony that he hadn’t even mentioned New York, which was helpful.
“Guess they finally got all their shit out in the open,” Natasha said, leaning back in her chair at the dining table. “You guys saw Stark’s face these past few days, right?”
If Tony had a therapist, they would probably tell him that he was making pathetic excuses and remind him of their heart-to-heart two days ago. This was why Tony didn’t have a therapist.
“Let me see that,” Stark ordered, and pulled the hologram to himself. He studied it for a moment, zoomed in on one particular spike, and then whooped at the top of his lungs. “Yeah, baby! They came for us!”
“Okay,” Tony said, hoping his voice wasn’t too squeaky. “Well, if you want to sneak out and then surprise everyone in the lobby or whatever, I won’t tell. You could also have a bedroom for tonight.”
Are you insulting my self-care habits—whoa, how did I manage to plan out how to fit an entire ice-cream maker into the suit? This doesn’t even make sense, this is like something Clint would demand that I build into his quiver and then decide that it was too bulky and then I’d have to give him back his old one and he wouldn’t notice, JARVIS, who approved this?”
Loki inhaled sharply, and his green eyes looked like they were full of broken glass. For a fraction of a second, Thor thought he saw tears shimmering in their depths, but they were gone before he could even blink.
Then there was that horrible broadcast; the Mandarin hijacked the signal of broadcast TV and took responsibility for bombings that Tony hadn’t even heard about. Rhodey told him about the nine attacks over lunch: no remains of any bomb casings, no witnesses, a heat signature of 3000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Maximoff whispered in the near-silence. Her face was pale as the moon, and she raised trembling fingers and released his teammates.
“Hey, they warned us,” Clint commented, spinning two chopsticks in between his fingers in varying patterns, for whatever reason. “How many times did Rogers tell you to not keep secrets?”
She let go and only clutched Tony with one arm, which he fully respected. The first time that he’d scooped Clint up in an embrace like this, he’d clung to him, refusing to let go for half of the trip.
Blast doors rumbled to life, shutting them into the decrepit warehouse. Steve flung his shield desperately at the rapidly-closing gap, but too late. Clint already had an arrow fully nocked, but he didn’t let fly. Natasha had her phone out, her eyebrows forming a hard line of tension. “Guys, we got a bogey. Short-range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.”
“Ultron was my solution.” Stark shoved his hands forcefully in his pockets, as though that would hide their shaking. “And if I recall, it wasn’t just me. Bruce and Wanda Maximoff had a pretty significant hand in that. But that’s still not the point—nuh uh, Steve, do
“Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head?” Sam asked him wryly. Clint snorted.
The lights in the hallway were equally dim, and Tony regretted putting in such ominous emergency illumination for a moment. JARVIS had already called the elevator, and the building trembled again.
“It’s damaged,” Thor reported. “But it looks different. More advanced—well, to your standards, at least. And he—ah. He’s carrying you, Captain.”
Natasha quirked an eyebrow. Maria had pulled out her phone, barking at whoever was on the other end to
Pierce had had gone off on a tangent that Tony had managed to entirely tune out, but Thor had obviously been half-listening to both conversations. He had been raised as a prince, Tony realized belatedly—he had to know how to handle delicate diplomatic situations.
,” he cries desperately. “I’m yours,” he whispers brokenly, the second time, “Yes, yes, I’m yours Tony. All yours, anything you want, anything, you know. Whatever you wanna—any fucking thing—j-just use me baby, w-want you to use me like I’m—oh my fucking goodness—like I’m a toy, like I belong to you!” Tony’s eyes are locked on his, so dark and hungry and exactly the only thing Steve wants to see. He’s panting and groaning, barely choking back his own needy noises as Steve mewls and whimpers. Finally, finally, he fucks into Steve brutally fast, shaking the bedframe as Tony nails his prostate over and over again. Steve’s cock, angry and trapped between them, spits out another glob of precome and he can feel his climax right there, he’s teetering on a razor’s edge, happily overwhelmed by the weight of Tony on top of him, stinging grip the other man has on his hair, the harsh drag of his own breath in his poor, abused throat.
They look at each other, heads tilted in mild confusion. Neither of them have ever been in a situation like this, one that warrants discussing
“You’re only to answer R&D calls or emails if you’ve been contacted enough times for it to seem like an emergency. I told Pepper and she says that she’s passed on the word to the developers too. If they know what’s good for them your phone won’t ring at all,” Steve says as they triple check that they have everything. Unlike Tony, Steve packs his things neatly and doesn’t rely on “I’ll just buy it later”. Tony thinks it’ll probably be nice to have everything he needs readily available for once.
and how one feels about another singular person. It’s very foreign. Usually Steve talks about the subtle curvature of so and so’s cock that made him see God and Buck remembers the soft wetness of a pussy on his face and that’s their relationship talk.
“I’m not being rash,” Steve says, exasperated. Tony isn’t so sure about that. He would go as far as saying that he disagrees, actually. Because Steve is being rash. He’s being ridiculous, in fact. The opportunity to study abroad for free is not something he should even consider passing up on, even if it means he’ll be time zones away from Tony for almost an entire year. Steve wants to see the world, and he won’t let Tony bankroll his travels, so this is obviously the next best thing. If Steve dropped out in the next second and expected Tony to support him for the rest of his life Tony wouldn’t have a problem with it at all. He just wants to see his boyfriend happy, and he knows that a school year spent in Paris would make him terribly happy. Steve had been practically salivating when he got the offer in the mail. Tony would not let him pass it up just to spare his very grown feelings.
“You comin’ to the show tonight?” Clint asks him, screaming over the music. The vein in his neck bulges in a sort of unappetizing way so Steve decides that he actually maybe doesn’t need food. The song in the living room changes to something by Archers of Loaf and Steve nearly groans at Bucky’s taste in whiny alt music.
There’s a lull during which Sam takes his own hit, and then, “Yeah it is. You don’t even gaze lovingly at Bucky.”
Stark, your fucking mouth. Do you ever sh-shut the hell up?” she groans, eyes rolling as she finds a particularly favorable angle to rub up against him.
“-When the dude elbows me in the side of the head. Literally winds the fuck up and elbows me in the head, and then I’m dizzy and still tryin’ to fight and he just shoves me across the floor and puts his knee in my stomach and this twisted piece of dried dog shit headbutts me like we’re in a goddamned movie Katie, I shit you the fuck not. I’m ‘bout to be down for the count, y’know because he did get me pretty good and he’s still punching my face in, when I manage to knee him in the gut, and dude fucking almost pukes. So, I know when to bow out of some shit, and I’m trying to get up and get away, y’know get my last few words in, when security rolls up and they pick me and Steve,- who somehow got hit in the face during all this? I dunno,- up off the floor and we get tossed. Meanwhile, Nat’s standin’ at the bar shook out of her mind because she just watched me nearly get my ass kicked and thrown out of the bar for some unknown reason,” Bucky finishes breathlessly. Suddenly, Natasha brings them all to a hault, props Bucky up on the wall of an alleyway, and glares at them collectively.
These results to his experiment leave him with even more questions. Does Tony care about him? Does Tony want him happy? Yes? Obviously. If a posh guy like him was willing to nearly get his face beaten in at a concert full of 20 somethings off their ass with anger and drugs, all for Steve, then obviously he cares about him at least a little bit. And Steve doesn’t know what to do with that information. Because he likes to know Tony is happy too, comfortable and not at all anxious in any way. He likes to suck to anxiety out of Tony’s body through his dick but he also likes to crank up the 70s rock in Tony’s workshop and watch him work on his muscle cars and shit because all the tension just melts from his shoulders and face and thighs like he’s coming. Does this mean they’re in love? Does this mean they’re dating? And if so, is this all dating consists of? Because Steve can handle this, he is handling this, but is there more? Does he have to meet Tony’s rich fancy friends and put on a show to impress them? Does he have to stay locked up in the penthouse like a little kept thing? Will he have to stop hanging out with his friends because they have a bad rep? And when Tony leaves him will he be this gross hollowed out thing, aching once again for whatever cock he can have up his ass? Who will he be once he’s Tony’s? It’s frightening to think about, and Steve isn’t easily scared.
“Right. Screw the food,” Tony says, turning away with the tray and starting towards the kitchen again.
When Steve wakes up the next morning, it’s surprisingly peaceful. There’s no Motley Crue blaring from any speakers, Steve can’t smell any gas leaking from anywhere, and when he looks out of his window and towards the street both Sam and Bucky’s cars are still parked, which means they’re both home but neither one of them is yelling. It’s unsettling to say the least, and while Steve pulls on a shirt and his glasses he runs through a series of probable scenarios to explain the state of his home. He pokes his head around his doorframe and looks down the hall, but every door is shut. He considers the possibility that Natasha stayed the night and therefore Bucky is distracted but then Steve notices a jar of mayo is still sitting at the top of the stairs and there’s an electric razor still buzzing on the bathroom sink, so he doubts that’s the case. Natasha would never allow this bullshit on her watch. Steve brushes his teeth with the door open so he can still hear a little bit, just in case his roommate are preparing some sort of stealth operation. If he lived anywhere else this would be called “paranoia”, but here it’s simply taking necessary precautions. Nothing happens though.
But, the conversation does give him an idea. People who like each other are supposed to do things that make each other happy, right? And he figures a nice way to test and see in Tony actually likes
“Clint…” Sam starts, but doesn’t finish because he locates some vodka. Steve doesn’t even need to be able to see his face to know that it’s gone slack with relief. Living here is like a full time job most days.
He has to be buzzed into Steve’s building by a girl at a front desk, but he’s around often enough that she just smiles and lets him up without question. Tony never lived on campus, not even when he was a minor in undergrad, so he isn’t really familiar with the procedures but he’s pretty sure Steve is supposed to come down and sign him into the building. He doesn’t think about the fact that he’s at Brown so much that security doesn’t even feel the need to do it. Tony just attributes it to them knowing who he is.
“Right. Bucky told me he’d get his ass kicked every day for me when we were like freshmen in high school. It completely solidified our friendship,” Steve points out, lazily making his way towards the stairs. Just being in the same room as Bucky is getting him a little high and if he wants to stay awake while attending this lame ass show in this stupid hipster bar in Bed-Stuy then he needs to be stone sober. Plus, this conversation has taken an uncomfortable turn towards painfully familiar territory and he’d rather not get into a verbal axe battle with a teenage girl. It’s below him, to be quite frank, and he’s mostly gotten over his passionate hatred of being thought to be Bucky’s claimed piece of ass. The insinuation has become a lot less offensive now that Steve has a healthy respect for his specific brand of sex appeal and doesn’t get all bent out of shape when people assume that the only guy he could pull ever would have to be his previously mostly straight best friend.
“Yeah,” Bucky agrees, “That’s just me. I’m a violent lover. I love hard as shit. I want Natasha to kick my ass to hell and back, that means I love her.”
Steve’s sort of bored after work so he goes to Rumlow’s. Bucky won’t be home until midnight, so he won’t be able to talk shit, Sam goes to bed at reasonable hours, and Clint gets up to all types of weird shit in the night so his judgment doesn’t matter. Rumlow helps him occupy his time and get much needed cardio workouts.
Steve has pressed a ring into hand, palmed between them like some kind of secret deal. Tony looks down at him, incredulous. He’s frozen right where he is, shock running through his veins just as quickly as his blood. He stares at the ring; it’s a simple gold
“I wanted to be right here Stark,” she tells him, her voice gone low and sultry. She leans back into the seat, her posture soft and civilian as she slouches. Maybe it’s purposeful, but maybe it’s not, either way her legs spread slightly and suddenly the little sliver of skin exposed by her dress isn’t enough for Tony. He can’t help but drink in all the skin on display, can’t help but rest one hand on her thigh and tilt his head in silent question. Tony notices that his hand can almost completely encircle her thigh and it sends a thrill through him. He knows she can tell. Captain Eve Rogers, master seductress apparently.
Tony slides another finger inside of Steve not too long after and he groans softly, “Your hole is so pretty and pink, stretched around my fingers baby. You look so good like this,” and then he sticks his tongue out and circles the rim of Steve’s sensitive, fluttering hole. He’s very precise, spreading the warm wetness of his spit there and fucking his fingers in and out steadily until Steve is gasping and shaking.
Sitting on the edge of the bed, missing only his coat and shoes, shirt mostly unbuttoned, is Tony. He’s scratching at his goatee, his hair is slightly disheveled; he’s perfect. Steve scrambles over to him eagerly, lowers himself to his knees and presents Tony with the tray. Tony takes the glass between his calloused, elegant fingers, and takes a long drink.
, she probably wears a size fucking 5 ring or something absolutely insane like that, and Tony’s thickened cock looks huge next to her little palm. He can only imagine what it’ll look like when he’s fully hard in her grip, he would bet that she’d even use both hands. Tony pushes her panties to one side and traces over the wet, throbbing swell of her lips, so sweet and fat with arousal that it makes him groan. He can’t wait to get his mouth on her and says as much as his fingers flick through her sticky wetness. Tony doesn’t give her any fingers though, he wants her good and needy before he gives her any penetration at all. This is his favorite part of casual sex, the part where you get to imagine any and everything you want, the part where you get to figure your partner out. People are so easy to pick apart when it comes to sex; even the most composed people become babbling idiots and Tony likes having that power over people. If he knows anything he knows sex, and he knows just about every trick in the book to get his partners horny and desperate.
“He’ll be fine, Hill,” he said, and he sounded like he knew something Steve didn’t. “I’ve got a guarantee.”
“Be careful, Tony,” Steve said, grunting as he presumably hurled his shield at something. “Who knows what they’ve been doing with the Mind Stone.”
Natasha, Sam, and Tony were both privately convinced that Bucky would never turn up until he felt ready to be found, but they let Steve hang onto his hope.
The other Thor studied his alternate, smiled sympathetically, and didn’t say anything. His Thor didn’t say anything, either, but Steve watched his grip tighten on Mjolnir.
“He doesn’t even know yet,” Rogers protested, sounding aggrieved. “There’d be nothing to be mad about—”
The faceplate knocked into the back of Steve’s head, sending him stumbling to the floor, before it slammed into Tony’s face.
“Insight’s launching in sixteen hours, we’re cutting it a little bit close here,” Natasha said, sticking her face in between the front seats.
“Okay,” Tony breathed out, clenching his fingers forcefully around his upper arms to still their shaking. “Okay. The Mark 42?”
Trevor stared blankly at Tony, justifiably, as Rhodey currently wasn’t doing anything except levelling a disgusted stare at everything in the room, but then he pressed the still-hot muzzle of his gun against Trevor’s ear, and the junkie immediately began spewing out apologies.
The team had molded to fit them, too, just like the rest of the new Avengers. Wanda had become quite attached to Steve and Natasha, whilst Pietro had taken a shine to Clint. Both of them were still a little uncomfortable around Tony, which he didn’t blame them for, so he was happy for them regardless.
From the scorn in Stark’s voice, Steve gathered that was a bad thing. He felt a twinge of sympathy for his double, but mostly he was confused. Who could throw a moon? And to be quite honest, he wasn’t really sure what a neutron star was.
and Tony was stumbling, running to the door, to his suit. The palladium poisoning that had been running through his blood not so long ago forced itself to the forefront of his brain, and he stammered out something about poison and to check his brain before JARVIS’s filtered voice told him that he’d had a major anxiety attack.
Steve was almost tempted to take the stairs, but before he could voice a protest, Stark had a hand wrapped around the back of the harness on Steve’s back and suddenly they were flying.
“Yoo-hoo,” one metal arm detached from under his arms and waved in his face. “Jeez, Cap, I was dead for two days and you’ve already gotten over me? That’s cold, even for you—”
“Getting there,” Steve said, because Tony’s face was still pale and waxy, his hand trembling in Steve’s, and Thor’s shoulders had curved in in an effort to make himself smaller.
“No, it wasn’t,” Rhodey said, and Tony wilted internally. Why could nothing ever be easy? “You got yours?”
Steve rolled to his feet. “She, Fury, and Hill have had a hell of a time exposing and uprooting a lot of the agents, especially in STRIKE, but Natasha worded it as… she needs someone who radiates patriotism and America to root out the evil fuckers.”
Their tempers continued to fray. Thor was obviously only sticking around Earth due to Loki’s presence in the basement of the Tower, and Steve barely saw the god on his in-between visits to the city. Natasha and Clint vanished (day two of seven) after they were sure that Stark and Rogers weren’t any threat with only a short explanation to JARVIS—probably back to SHIELD, but it was still disconcerting for the Tower to be so empty. Bruce mostly stayed in the lab, working with Tony and Stark, so Steve was often left alone.
When Steve arrived back at SHIELD headquarters, there were junior agents all over the ground floor, staring at Natasha, Clint, and especially Steve and whispering. Natasha pretended not to notice, and Clint glared at them, but Steve was just wondering
The noise that Steve’s phone made when it crumpled in his fist made him think of how the Iron Man suit must have crumpled under all of that wreckage.
Tony snapped his fingers. “The sass. I didn’t—did I program that? I feel like I would have remembered doing that.”
“At this moment, the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up,” Killian mused, a smarmy grin fixed onto his face as though he hadn’t just infected one of Tony’s best friends with Extremis. “And if it does give up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it’s really just a lot of pain.”
Tony slid to his knees in a phone booth in the middle of nowhere in Tennessee, and his lungs felt so tight he worried the arc reactor would combust.
Stark emphasized firmly. “Thanos collected all of the Infinity Stones and snapped half the universe into oblivion—hey, should I be telling them this? Am I destroying our universe and the space-time continuum?”
(Once, on the first day, Steve had picked up a phone call half-asleep and mumbled, “It’s me.” Without hesitating, Clint, hyped up on coffee, had completed with far too much enthusiasm with, “Mario!”)
“We were ten years old. Having dinner, the four of us.” Neither of them seemed fazed by the non-sequitur that he had just spoken. There was an entranced quality to his voice, as though he’d been returned to the moment that this had happened. “When the first shell hits two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It’s big,” he continued, gesturing with his hands. Wanda had turned her face away, hiding in the shadows of the ruined cell.
“Maybe,” Tony answered amiably as static lifted the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck. A tiny bolt of lighting (well, tiny compared to some of the others that Steve had seen Thor summon during the fight) arced downwards from the Tower and collided with the chest plate of the armor. Stark’s hair stood on end, but the chestpiece began to glow.
When Steve had been small and scrappy and stupid, he’d stuffed pilfered oranges into his pockets and picked fights he could never win, just to feel some semblance of control. He had been grasping at straws, snarling at Bucky through bloody teeth and defending some broken sense of honor that was more of an excuse than a moral code. He volunteered for an experiment in a Brooklyn basement and crashed a plane into the Arctic chasing that control, but whether he was slipping oranges into his pockets or upsetting plans to tear down democracy, Steve never felt like he was making his own choices.
When Steve reached Camp Lehigh and saw his ghosts running rampant among the crumbled facades and wrecked bunkers, he had two SHIELD assassins at his sides and his shield at his back. Memories screamed in his face, pounded at the back of his mind: Peggy, shouting at the recruits who had decided to think with the piece of flesh between their legs instead of between their ears; Bucky’s smile, which was already beginning to fade from his memory; Howard Stark’s manic rambling that reminded him, now, of Tony.
Rogers was almost the complete opposite. He still did a few optimistic things here and there: encouraging Tony, Stark, and Bruce to keep working when they got down; offering Steve a smile when he found himself in the gym, whaling on the punching bags so hard that he could barely breathe; not protesting when Natasha snatched a pastry from his hand and taking a big bite. On the surface, he was just a little more closed-off, a little colder.
“Oh, my God,” Natasha said. Fury was watching the screen, lips parted, and Clint started pacing the length of the room like a caged animal.
impressed by the versatility and design of his Tony Stark’s Iron Man armor. This other suit, though, seemed impossible. Where the old Iron Man suit was bulky or sharp-edged, this suit was curved and sleek. More of the design was gold instead of red—the arms and legs, mostly. It looked like the metal bent and flexed whenever Stark moved… the other Stark, that was.
“I’m going to hit the sack,” Clint said suddenly, slapping his drumsticks together. “Been a long day.”
Sam put his hands up in surrender, looking a little flustered at his apparent gaffe to an alien prince.
“Whoa!” Tony lunged forward, the suit screeching as the joints grated, and caught Steve under the armpits. “Steve, hey, stay with me.”
Tony went up to the roof and sat there for a good, long while. His legs dangled off the side and in the cold night air, New York City glowed on the horizon. No dust clogging the air, no half-collapsed buildings that had never been repaired. It was just home.
“Crap,” he muttered, smacking at where the implants were, and Steve flipped his visor up, smirking. Tony jabbed a finger at him. “Don’t you say it—”
“Like you don’t like them better than me,” Clint grumbled as though Tony wasn’t sitting right there, stupefied.
“I assume you have a way to bring us back,” Stark was saying, “unless you like us so much that you wanted to strand yourself in 2012, too.”
“I’ll be damned,” he said wryly, reveling for a moment in Killian’s perplexed moue. “The prodigal son returns.”
Steve practically flung his shield aside when he found Tony, crumpled on his side with an Iron Man gauntlet around his left hand. His nose was bleeding, and he had a cut along his cheekbone, but that was the only sign of injury.
The rest of the people stood behind them, and most of them were impossible to make out, as their faces had been violently X-ed out. The woman in front and the red man had received similar treatment. There were a few that were spared: a bald woman with a blue-and-silver face, a legitimate raccoon wearing some sort of outfit, a woman with sandy hair in red and blue. But the sheer amount of scribbled-out faces was astonishing in itself.
Rhodey smashed through the window and shot the two armed guards dead, and Trevor jerked awake at the sounds of gunshots. He eyed Tony dazedly. “What’ve you come as?” he asked blankly, and Rhodey slammed him back in his easy chair.
“No,” Tony attempted to protest, but it was of no use. That was one of the downsides to dating Captain America: contests of physical strength weren’t exactly
Once the three of them are settled in the car, Steve and Tony banished to the back seats, Bucky sets off for Natasha’s place. She lives in a much nicer area than them, in this complex of condos in Tribeca that her family owns. Her grandmother purchased this building specifically for Nat to live in when she finally moved out of her parents house so that she could commute to NYU without too much hassle. The same amount of time Steve has been spending getting to know Tony, getting to
“Like this?” Steve breathes, glancing over at Tony, who nods his approval. Tony stands so that he towers over Steve’s prone form and drinks in the sight of him.
“It’s not almost like,” Steve says around his mouthful of smoke, “I definitely do. It’s just…weird is all.”
“Y’know Steve, don’t take this the wrong way, but Tony is the only guy you’ve fucked that I’ve ever liked,” Bucky calls as he hangs his and Natasha’s coats. Steve is very glad that Tony has already fallen asleep.
“Yeah. It’s Sam’s place though,” Bucky answers her, flipping through the channels until he finds Rocco’s Modern Life playing on Nick.
” type of dates. They leave Steve feeling all blushy and lightheaded and totally unlike himself. He’s never been shown off before and while Steve likes to think he has a great sense of self and propriety, it’s nice to not wonder if the person whose fingers he’s moaning around at night is ashamed of him during the day.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you T-Tony, sir, thank you. That’s so good, fuck, thank you!” he screams, writhing around as thick streams of come spurt across his rippling abs. Tony groans right along with him, rubbing his hand over his trapped cock for some relief.
“So, what force of nature should I be thanking for this happy little adventure?” he gasps, trying valiantly to be clever. One of Eve’s small hands goes to unbutton his collar and remove his bowtie so that she can have access to his chest.
Steve takes a nap before they head out. He’s walking out of the front door with Clint, Bucky, and a very secretly frazzled Kate Bishop when Sam pulls into the drive in his white Mazda and everyone applauds when they see him. Everyone except Steve, who’s still a little dazed from having just woken up and not having eaten anything since like 11 that morning. It’s cool though, he tells himself, because he’s going to get like half sloshed at this club and then Bucky will feel obligated to feed him in order to ensure he doesn’t vomit up his own gastrointestinal system. Maybe he’ll get some of those really good burgers from the place on Flushing. Sam would probably want him to eat
Steve whimpers, licks over his swollen lips. It’s difficult to speak when he’s like this, so down and soft and sweet, time moves like molasses and he can barely see straight. It’s like nothing exists outside of him and Tony, like the only thing keeping him tethered to the planet earth is the sweet friction of his hole clenching around Tony’s dick. Tony gets so deep Steve feels like he’s in his guts, but it’s so good, it’s so so perfect. The thick glide, the tug against his rim, the squelch of lube and spit Tony’s cock is mixing inside of him. Steve knows that later when Tony’s finished with him his hole will be pink and puffy and Tony will want to suck around it, like a kiss. Just the thought makes Steve shudder; being used like this is so perfect. He could take Tony’s dick forever, just let himself be used like the world’s most enthusiastic fleshlight.
“Shall I take you home?” he asks, quirking a brow. He’s gorgeous in a dark maroon suit, black button down underneath, watch sparkling on his wrist. The perfect chocolate of his curls look darker than usual in this light, making his cheekbones stand out and his lips appear bright, bitten pink. His posture is casual but the expression on his face is anything but. Tony offers his hand to Steve and Steve takes it as he drops his legs and stands up from the stool he was warming.
On another hand, Steve could be terribly put off by this. He’s seen good marriages and he’s familiar with touches that don’t lead to fucking, but maybe he doesn’t want that with Tony. They’ve spent years being
want to go. I don’t know if I—what if I’m not ready?” Steve asks quietly, insecurely. His voice has gone small, with no trace of the blustering sureness he’d displayed just a few minutes earlier.
“Do your worst,” she chuckles. Steve doesn’t reply, just unbuttons her pants and slides them down her shapely, tan legs. A lot of people don’t realize this, but the suit is incredibly heavy, and Toni has to stay in pretty good shape to maneuver it the way she does. She’s muscular from heavy lifting and metal work as well, and it’s evident as he sucks at her thigh and licks at her belly button. Toni is quiet in a way that’s generally uncharacteristic of her, except that she always gets like this right before. She shakes slightly, quivers in sweet anticipation as Steve noses around her panties (thin, silky, light pink, perfect on her skin), arranges her legs so that he can kiss a bruise into her hamstring, rubs his thumbs over her nipples without removing her bra further than sliding it down her body.
Tony pulls away, and this time flicks Steve’s balls even harder, watches how the jump up close to his body, “What the fuck did I tell you?” he growls, using his other hand to harshly grip the base of Steve’s cock, effectively stopping his movements. The younger man stills instantly, his hand stops flying over his cock and he sobs in apology.
Tony chuckles lowly and sits down next to Steve before pulling Steve’s bony feet into his lap. He produces a lighter from his pocket as well, and twists off the cap of the Corona, “No baby, you go ahead,” and presses play. Steve is so in love he can hardly breathe.
“What the h-?” he begins angrily, his adrenaline spiking once again when he’s met with the glaring face of Steve Rogers. They pause for one brief moment before their lips are crashing together in a clash of gnashing teeth and snarling breaths.
“I think that’s enough,” Tony tells him eventually. He searches Steve’s face, looking for something that he doesn’t find, because then he’s brushing his hand over Steve’s head and kissing his forehead, “Be a good boy and put all that down.”
Sam clucks sympathetically as they come into Steve’s view, “I know buddy, but you also can’t just give away Bucky’s truck. He needs it to get to work,” he drops the keys to his own car, a sensible Mazda, on the counter next to Steve’s ankle. So that’s why Bucky was screaming bloody murder. Steve nods his greeting to Clint who just nods back in the sad way that a scolded child might. He represses the urge to roll his eyes.
Because no matter how much Steve hates these political ass kissing competitions, no matter how much he loathes having insecure business men and their soulless wives talk about his work like it’s a hobby, Steve doesn’t have any complaints about the sex that comes when everything’s over. Steve gets a few drinks in him and Tony gets drunk off the thrill of outsmarting no less than 150 people with barely any effort all; all that power turns him into someone else. There’s a side of Tony that he very rarely lets anyone see, that he reserves especially for Steve, and it always comes out on nights like these. Steve just has to wait until it’s his turn, and soon enough he’ll be under the scrutiny of all of Tony’s sweet, undivided attention. The thought alone makes his cock stir in his trousers.
“Bucky’s always yelling,” Steve comments offhandedly, finally grabbing a bottle of water and walking out of the kitchen. His best friend glares at him as soon as they make eye contact and Steve rolls his eyes. Bucky’s the least scary person in this room.
Sitting across from Steve, watching him dig into the steak he predictably ordered, looking so handsome and lovely in his suit, Tony thinks that he should probably buy a ring. He knows that he should buy a ring. There’s no one on earth he wants to play footsie with more. Tony never knew he could have someone the way he has Steve; in him Tony has a partner in crime, a confidant, a lover, the whole world.
They go out, eat some fancy Thai food, get photographed by a few paparazzo, nothing serious. When Toni is alone a crowd of them will follow her, but if Steve is around they’re immediately too intimidated and will fan out. Steve is glad that there aren’t that many of them on this particular night; it’s nice out, and it might be the last evening of good weather for a while. He wants to walk through the park with Toni, watch the setting sun play with the colors in her hair. He wants to watch her eyes glaze over in anticipation of what’s in store for her later that night. So he tugs her wrist and they walk the few blocks to the nearest park. She’s in a pair of fitted trousers that hug her ass nicely, and Steve inserts his hand in her back pocket.
The entire group turned to stare at him, various looks of disbelief coloring their faces. They had been slow to put away their smart phones and Nikons but Steve just kept giving his best disappointed, stern look and eventually they disbanded. The man and woman who’d been surrounded by fans turned to look at Steve, and suddenly he was hit with the full force of Tony Stark’s biggest grin.
“I know. You’re always such a good boy. Hop to it now,” he instructs with a pat on Steve’s rear. Tony doesn’t acknowledge him further, just expecting Steve to jump to follow whichever directions he’s been given. It’s the little things like that, the small ways in which Tony shows how thoroughly he’s possessed Steve, that make nights like these so delectable. Because Tony is always wealthy, he’s always just a little too much older than Steve, he’s always commanding and alluring, but he isn’t always
s as Steve strokes and squeezes, hips gyrating in search of that perfect friction. Normally Steve would stop him, tell him that he takes what Steve gives him, but this time Steve just watches, almost awestruck as Tony takes what he needs. Steve can see it in Tony, the same way he feels it himself; a need that burns through the body like a fever.
Low in Steve’s gut, arousal builds. He’s been half hard since his third glass of whisky, and that was before he caught sight of Tony running his hands through his hair, loosening the collar of his shirt. That was before he got to be close to him again and could smell the musky spice of his cologne, feel the strength in his grip as he held onto Steve. It’s nice to be in Tony’s sights again, it makes Steve feel like he’s in his care, under his protection, trapped in being possessed by the world’s most secretly possessive man.
, making her sob at the pain. Tony’s glad that she stopped jerking him off because that sight alone, her hurting herself while she comes, would’ve made him shoot off right then. He’s leaking all over himself; the stain on his thigh is the least of his concerns.
Meanwhile, Tony glares at him icily, “I want you to say that this fucking means something to you!” he yells, his face becoming flushed. He walks over to one of his dressers and starts throwing himself into underwear and other articles of clothing but Steve doesn’t really care about that. All he knows is that his vision has gone blurry with… tears and he doesn’t know how to make this better but he does know that he wants to. Make this better, that is. If Tony walks away from him Steve will never be able to fix this, he knows that too, and he’ll never be able to fix himself afterwards.
“Yeah,” his boyfriend sighs. Tony goes back into the chat so that he can see the way Steve’s eyebrows have pulled together and his mouth has gone all pinched and tight. His heart clenches at the sight.
,” she moans, fucking her hips back and forth quickly. There’s going to be a wet spot on Tony’s trousers, a big one that obviously illustrates to anyone that sees them exactly what they were doing on their car ride. That thought alone makes his cock twitch in Eve’s hand and another fat drop of precome swells at the tip. She groans at the sight and grinds harder Tony can feel the small, hard, nub that is her clit as she fucks herself against him, and he places a hand at the small of her back to press her even closer to his body. Tony bounces his leg too, wants to help her get off in any way he can. She uses her other hand to pull at his hair, using him for leverage once again. He can’t say that he minds.
They have to take two cars, which is a first. Bucky, Natasha, and Clint get in the pickup and Sam drives the lovebirds in his sensible Mazda. Tony had offered to have them driven in the Suburban but what’s life if you don’t have to worry about navigating your way home in tequila induced haze?
, god I can’t wait,” he pants. Eve squeezes her eyes shut like she can’t bear to look at him and speeds her hand up to match her own thrusts. Tony doesn’t want to come like this but figures he can hold out for a lot longer than Eve, whose face has gone such a deep shade of red he’s surprised she hasn’t passed out from the blood rush. Her breathing is labored, her perky breasts bouncing as she gyrates, and the blush goes past them. Tony can’t help himself, licks up the center of her chest, kisses both nipples, gets his hand in her hair like he wanted to all along and turns her head towards him. He wants her to look at him when she comes for the first time, he wants her to know he’s devouring her with his eyes when she shakes apart and flails and quakes with her climax.
“Of course. Look,” and Tony squirms until Steve frees him and he can rummage through his suitcase. The little black box is carefully hidden so that Steve’s little folding fingers never would have found it while he double and triple checked that Tony had everything. The velvet is soft and purposeful beneath Tony’s fingers. He turns shyly, facing Steve and presenting him with this box that has held Tony’s entire heart prisoner for years. He opens the box and sees the ring, one he usually didn’t allow himself to look at because it just got him too worked up. Thinking about the way it would look on Steve’s hand filled him with so much love Tony suspected he could float away like a helium balloon or sink to the bottom of the ocean like a sunken ship. It was nearly embarrassing except here Steve was, blushing and grinning and looking the way Tony felt.
“Me neither. Should I…” Steve trails off. Tony is undoing his cufflinks, looking regal, and he nods his head easily, already knowing what Steve was about to propose. Steve can see the way his spine is lengthening, the way he’s falling into his role. A shudder rolls through Steve’s body, from head to toe, and he wants to drop to his knees right there.
mine; you know that? You’re mine. My sweetheart, my beautiful, precious boy. The sweetest little cock hungry boy I’ve ever known. All mine. Mine to fuck and use and play with however I want right?” Steve nods, tugs on Tony’s hair, “Yeah mine. You’re such a good boy baby, you know exactly what to say. I’m so proud of you honey, I know your hole must be so sore and fucked out, but you take it so nicely. Not one complaint out of you, thank you baby, thank you sweet boy, for letting me have you.”
Tony swallows down the tears threatening to escape him, “Yes,” he says certainly. Because even if he is scared, he’s sure that he wants to give Steve his hand. They don’t look away from each other as Tony slips the ring onto the appropriate finger. Steve inhales sharply.
So Tony shoulder checks Rogers on his way out the room, “Right, right. Real mature of our benevolent dictator here,” he calls behind him, slamming the door as he goes.
“Of course,” Tony murmurs. His hands find Steve’s waist, holding him right about the band of Steve’s boxers, and his fingers draw a soft pattern on the ridge of Steve’s hipbone. It’s relaxing and comfortable, and they just stand there in the kitchen and hug for a while because they can. It feels better to do this here, in the brownstone, than in the penthouse. Tony doesn’t even really like it there, and if Steve is honest there’s nothing particularly relaxing about the island of Manhattan.
“How’d he get back?” Steve asks, looks at Clint “How’d you get back? Weren’t you driving the truck? Why have you decided to raise a child without consulting us? Where did the girl go?”
Once they return to Brooklyn and they get into the brownstone, Nat deals out blankets for those who can’t really make it up the stairs (Bucky) and those who don’t actually live in the house (Kate) so that they can sleep off the night on the couches downstairs. Kate curls into a ball in the loveseat and Bucky stretches himself out on the sofa in a dramatic sprawl that causes him to groan and wince and hiss like a whiny bitch the entire time. Natasha, a saint, puts up with this mess stone faced and serious while she bandages up his face (which is probably fucked to hell in a non sexy way) and makes him drink water. Tony, an adult, does the same to the rest of the herd and everyone shepherds themselves in their separate directions. He gets to come into Steve’s room.
“No. I like the Brooklyn clubs; they’re cute yeah? I got a couple of hipster places, some really swanky rich people joints, even a few places approved by Punk Master James. I’ve got my hands in everything.”
They’re quiet for what seems like an eternity, only the sounds of their heavy breathing filling the air, and in that eternity Steve ages maybe a million years. Saying those words took something out of him and despite his flushed face and heaving lungs, he feels calmer. It’s settling to have that in the open: his fear. He was afraid, it’s as simple as that, and now that Tony knows Tony can make a decision and Steve can stop living in fear. He can deal with pain, but fear is something else. Fear is crippling and he’s hated being afraid. He’s hated not trusting that Tony wouldn’t want him to be afraid.
And suddenly, in a burst of uncharacteristic earnestness, Steve finds himself saying, for some inexplicable reason: “Yeah,” but getting up and walking over to the booth where his friends are to tell them he’s leaving before Tony can reply. When he returns to his spot at the bar, he finds the man sitting there with a sort of puzzled look on his strange, pretty face. He looks nothing like Brock Rumlow, or Max Payne, or Dylan Blanchard from 10th grade English, or even goddamned Leigh Raymond, the nicest guy he’s ever fucked.
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” she chants, before all of Eve’s language skills devolve into her only being able to make this needy, wrecked
very normal. So juvenile. Young love is so beautiful,” Pepper giggled. Tony could feel his face heating up and astutely ignored her. It was always slightly embarrassing for his friends to acknowledge his small age, even if they claimed they were supportive of him engaging in age appropriate behavior.
“He threatened me with violence when he asked me to teach him sign language,” Clint adds. Steve hears something clang and fall to the ground and he rolls his eyes before finally stepping on the first stair. Steve is pretty sure that it doesn’t take other people 10 whole minutes to get from their front door, to kitchen, to the first stair leading to the second level of his house and he’s vaguely sad about having missed out on a normal 20 something’s experience of life. And then he hears Clint groan, “Oh oven mitt, you’re useless,” regretfully and he’s incredibly happy that he’s made the decision to live with this merry band of fucking losers. They’re pretty great when they want to be.
All of this angst comes to a halting swell five weeks into its brewing. Steve has been avoiding Tony still,treating him like he’d treat one of his nicer regulars and only calling him when he wants to hook up or maybe needs a ride to get to food and or work. Tony, who is the king of Repressed Emotions, doesn’t ever say anything or even react differently to Steve’s sudden temperature change. Bucky says, on a semi regular basis, that they’re a trainwreck and he’s not wrong. Even Sam can’t help himself from watching this shitshow with a bowl of popcorn, leaving his door open for every fight they have over the phone (which they never used to do) and sticking around in the living room to watch tapes with them and listen to them chat awkwardly at each other. They’ve been doing this
have him interject, the flash of headlights blinds them all. They’re gathered in the opening of an alley, far enough away from the trash to not be able to smell it so much, and not deep enough in to get mugged or murdered without someone else noticing, but people don’t usually drive into alleys. It’s generally pretty gross and dangerous, and when Steve gets a good look at the shiny Suburban that has somehow managed to squeeze itself in between the bricks, he figures this guy isn’t from the city and doesn’t know this.
“No that’s not the question,” he practically purrs, twisting his hand just so and making Tony see stars. He tries to kick Steve off, put up a bit of a fight, make it seem like he’s not so gone on this, but it’s no use, and that only frustrates him further. “The question is, why pretend like you don’t fucking want it, Stark? Why get me all riled up like this? I’ve known this whole time, I’ve just been waiting for the right moment to get you alone, work out some of this pent up energy, yknow?” he rambles.
“It’s almost like you love him,” Sam scoffs, holding the lighter out to light the bowl for Steve. His friends are really sweet when they want to be.
In New York Steve splits his time between Brooklyn and the mansion in Manhattan. He goes back to his same summer job every year, spends some of the day with Bucky and a few of their acquaintances in the neighborhood, and at night he comes out to Manhattan to be with Tony.
It’s a fun night, an easy night. Tony slams back a shot with the rest of the group, sips from a beer, but doesn’t drink for the rest of the night. Steve gets absolutely fucking blitzed. The band that plays definitely errs on the whinier emo side, but they’re loud and their basslines are awesome, so he and Bucky waste no time throwing themselves into the fray of it. Less than three songs in Bucky has his shirt off, they’re headbanging wildly, and have been threatened with bodily harm at least four times. It’s great. They get back to the table and do a few more shots, and when Bucky drags Nat into the crowd Steve stays back with Tony. Steve pushes himself close, grabs Tony's arm and drapes it over himself so that he can feel  warm and safe and small. The older man looks more amused than anything, watching Steve's friend run about and make fools of themselves for the entire night, so Steve doesn’t bother asking if he’s ready to go.
“And you and all of your friends smoke like chimneys to top it off. I’m surprised you’re a walker,” they laugh. Tony presses this deep, tense kiss to Steve’s mouth that’s more of a gasping thing than a happy one, but that’s okay. He craves this closeness unabashedly now, he has to.
“Eat,” Tony demands gently. He doesn’t even reach a hand out towards his food until Steve has taken at least two bites of his omelette and sipped his juice. He looks disproportionately happy at the sight of Steve enjoying himself.
He breathes turbulently, “I didn’t know what to do, Tony,” he admits, and the older man sucks in a gasp, “I was scared and I didn’t know what to do. Because… because you’re right and I was fucking a bunch of other guys before you and they were all just a means to an end, I guess. They were to scratch and itch I couldn’t reach; they weren’t around to care about me or be wanted by me. But you are, right? You want me and you want me to want you back. And you’re right, I was treating you like them and I should’ve known better than to be afraid of- of liking the way someone treats me but I didn’t- I still don’t really. I’m still scared.”
“I’ve missed you, sweetcheeks,” he murmurs into Steve’s ear. His voice is low, gravelly, and he squeezes Steve’s hip as they make their way past photographers. They both duck, hiding their faces slightly, until they’re met by Happy with the Rolls Royce. Tony opens the door, allows Steve to slide in first, and then joins him. They’re mostly silent on the ride home, sharing small smiles and pecks on the lip, but not much more. Tony likes to let the anticipation build.
“Mornin’ sweetness,” Steve greets him beatifically. Tony doesn’t blush but it’s a close call. Instead, to disguise how Steve makes his heart race, he grabs his coffee and takes a long gulp.
Tony’s cock is a nice length, pretty average in that department, but Coke can thick and he forces Steve’s tight asshole open with 4 fingers before he’s pressing in with his dick. They go bare for the first time, a wordless agreement, and both of them let out needy moans at the feeling. Tony forces Steve’s legs over his shoulders and around his neck so he can get his mouth on Steve’s hole and that’s it; he’s totally done for. He’s heaving in these huge wheezing breaths and he’s probably tomato red and Tony just keeps growling low in his throat, and coming up for air and to encourage Steve to be as loud as he want. Tony calls Steve his “good boy” but the possessiveness in his tone is what gets Steve’s cock dripping. He’s never been someone else’s, he’s never wanted to be, but to be
They met at an art show. Tony and Pepper had been cruising a lot of galleries that season, trying to replenish the Stark collection to the best of their ability. Steve had begun to make a bit of a name for himself, at least in New York, so he’d been featured amongst some more popular modern artists despite his focus on hyperrealism. He’d been wandering around a bit, introducing himself to wealthy collectors, artists, and writers for websites and magazines, when he noticed a man being surrounded by photographers. No one but the press was meant to be taking photos, especially not with flash, so Steve had excused himself from the conversation he was involved in to walk over to the gaggle of people.
“Yes, you may baby. Come for me, let me see how much you like it,” he says kindly. Steve weeps out his thanks and just as his powerful hips start fucking into the air, just as he squeezes his thighs together and lets himself start to come, Tony lays quick snaps of the cane across his nipples, alternating very fast for the moments of Steve’s orgasm crashing through him.
too,” Tony tells him, waving the DVD in Steve’s face before going to pop it into the console. Steve looks up at him and smiles, a big easy smile that takes up most of his face.
Tony yanks on the chain this time, hard and fast and mean, gives Steve a nasty smirk that has the other man biting his lip, “Oh I see. You’re a little pain slut. You like when I hurt you,” he teases. Steve’s face goes bright red, even the tips of his ears, but he nods eagerly. “Mmm, wonder how much you’ll like this.” And that’s all the warning Tony gives before he’s pulling on the chain so hard, the clamps pop free. Steve lets out a wail, a sob of ecstasy, and slams his fists into the mattress. His thighs tremble and he fucks up into the air, his fat, wet cockhead slapping against his abs with the force. Once he settles Tony trails a finger through the puddle of precome in the divots of Steve’s abs and pops it into his mouth. “Yum.”
Toni kneels up and gives Steve some room to breathe. Her chest is heaving and sweat trickles down her spine, Steve can feel it pooling at the small of her back. He smiles up at her.
goodness, Stark—I’m gonna—Tony, I’m so close, I’m gonna come, fuck, fuck, fuck,” she sobs loudly. Tony almost feels bad for Happy, but honestly, his driver has put up with a lot worse.
that,” she snorts meanly, but still squirms her way deeper into the fold of his arm. Steve rolls his eyes. It’s nice to just chat with Toni sometimes, they don’t get to do it very often. They talk about any and everything under the sun; TV shows they’re watching,  books they’ve read, house gossip. He’s happy they get to do this. When they first met, Steve will admit, he was a bit hostile and they certainly got off on the wrong foot. After getting to know her better, Steve found that Toni is just
When he wakes, Tony has turned off all the lights, opened the windows, lit three candles, and brought in a tray of apple slices and cheese for them to enjoy. He’s obviously cleaned them up, as Steve isn’t sticky with dried come or smelling of rancid sweat, and he’s even tucked Steve under the covers, the duvet up to his chin. Steve snuffles, reaching for the other man even as he crosses the room from the doorway to kneel on the floor next to the bed.
,” he whined, throwing another shirt into his bag. He’d only be in Providence for like a week but he had at least two weeks’ worth of clothes packed. If he stopped packing Pepper was gonna keep talking to him. At least this way he could kind of ignore her until she caught a hint.
“Luck’s got nothin’ to do with it, handsome,” she drawls. Her slim fingers tangle in the hair at the base of Tony’s skull and she pulls so that she can get to his neck. She sucks and bites the skin there, trailing her clever tongue over a tendon that’s bulging, nibbling right under his ear and giggling when she feels the way it makes his hips twitch. The blue dress has been tossed to one side and Tony catches the briefest glimpse of lacy black underthings as Eve rolls her own hips into the growing bulge in Tony’s pants. She lets out a quiet hum of pleasure but doesn’t let this distract her from her mission of mauling Tony’s neck.
He begins by placing his mouth on one of Steve’s overheated, red nipples. The clamps are protected with a little bit of plastic so they aren’t too hard but the chain between them is relatively heavy and Steve has been wearing them for quite a while. He swirls his tongue over the sensitive nub and sucks lightly, making Steve whimper and thrust his hips into the air. Tony knows he can come from this alone, once they get going. Steve will come from having his poor, pretty nipples played with and Tony will remove the plug in his ass and replace it with his cock; by the time he fucks into Steve, the blonde will be so delirious with pleasure he won’t know up from down. With that in mind, Tony takes his sweet time before giving Steve’s other nipple the same treatment.
taps me on the shoulder. And I’m like, y’know, what the hell does this guy want? So I turn around and y’all know how I get when I’m off my ass,” he looks around at all of them and everyone nods because hell yeah, they know how he gets when he’s drunk, “and the dude is just like, breathing too heavy and shit and he’s like “is that little red thing yours?” like Nat’s s-some kind of fucking car on the street or some shit and I can’t just, y’know, let ‘im talk ‘bout my girl like that so I’m like okay fuck off asshole, and Sam comes over to the bar and he’s like, bein’ Sam and he’s like “what’s goin’ on here?” when he realizes who this fucking dicktip is and he’s like “hey
about it or try and maybe it’s not how married people fuck and say I love you but it’s working for them.
Steve, understanding immediately, gathers the incriminating evidence: he folds the bong, collects the food he enjoyed without his best friend, all of Sam’s beer bottles. He runs to the kitchen and disposes of these things while Bucky is still distracted and makes it back to the couch to wake his boyfriend just as Bucky rounds the corner into the living room.
