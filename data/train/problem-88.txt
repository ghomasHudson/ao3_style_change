Everything is so much quieter in his head now.  His brain never, ever shuts off, and when it's harnessed to a case, it makes him brilliant, but if it's not constantly occupied, it cannibalises itself, recursive bad memories and corrosive what-ifs spiralling down into infinity.  He'd given up hope of ever being able to slow it down by legal means, but physical contact with John seems to do it.  He hasn't had access to this kind of regular touch in decades, and he'll take as much advantage of it as John will allow.
John smiles at him with only his eyes.  "Fine.  We can watch
“Sherlock?  How does it look?”
John lifts the hem of Sherlock’s sweat-damp T-shirt and peels it over his head, and Sherlock still feels hot but it's an entirely different heat now, trickling down his spine and settling molten in the cradle of his hips. John looks overcome at the sight of him, barely halfway undressed, and Sherlock thinks he may spontaneously combust if he doesn't start touching John again immediately. Sherlock reaches out, and then John’s hands are on him, roving over his torso, a declaration of intent that makes his belly tighten with need.  His hands find John’s hair and he slots their mouths together, licking his way assiduously into John's mouth, desperate to find out how he tastes and whether Sherlock can estimate the pH of John’s saliva using just his tongue. He can't, he'll need samples, but this is already the best experiment he's ever undertaken.
"I — yeah, okay.  I suppose I didn't, at that.  And I have some idea what it's like to be trapped in your own brain, thanks ever so.  It's hell.  Is that the only reason?"
"Has it occurred to you that sharing a bed is not something friends and flatmates usually do?"
John chuckled. "Well, I hope Mrs Hudson's holiday is as happy as ours."
Sherlock Holmes is in love with John Watson.
.  You might only complain through half of that one."
John's blog becomes a chronicle of Sherlock almost immediately.  He's so much more interesting than John, and he's so easy to write about.  The words start flowing again, and John slowly gains a following of readers (and future clients) for his improbable-yet-true tales of Sherlock’s cases.  The blog turns into a running account of their mad, wonderful existence, and Sherlock lodges a token protest, but when he thinks John isn't looking, he reads the posts and lets his mouth twitch up at one corner.
"Fine. I'll see what I can dig up."
Sherlock, on purpose, and leaves his journal sticking out just slightly from under his bed, like an invitation.  Just to see what happens.  His impulse control is only good compared to Sherlock's, and that's not saying much.
Sherlock swallowed, and then nodded. "Yes."
"For you, yes," John said, and held his hand tighter. "Should we do some trick-or-treating on the way home, do you think?" John teased. "Seems a shame to waste the costumes."
"John?"
"Of course I'm coming with you." John squares his shoulders, as if daring Sherlock to try and stop him. "Of course I am."
He should probably say something.
"God, it's hot in here. What're you working on?"
That's when he starts the book.
He starts writing
John grinned lecherously. "Literal or figurative sweets?"
It was October, and John was glad. Autumn had settled around them like a cloak. The air was spiced with the earthy, comforting scents of dying leaves and slumbering hearth fires, and the days were crouching down into long nights that nipped at fingers and noses. The trees in Regent's Park were setting themselves on fire in blazing reds and golds, and there was enough of a chill in the air to claw through light jackets and jumpers. John had taken to wearing his heavier cable-knit jumpers, which Sherlock teased him about but which still made him nestle into John's chest on the sofa. Tea seemed even more necessary than usual, and they kept the fire stoked while they were home, to ward off the crepuscular cold that crept in through the windowpanes and under the door.
Sherlock sighs. "No, I never have. Do you?"
If John were actually burning, sending up smoke like a signal fire, Sherlock is sure, somehow, that he would be able to see it from anywhere in the world.
“All right, John,” he murmurs, low. “Anywhere.”
"I love you," John said softly. Sherlock's tiny exhalation of breath against his lips was like the suggestion of a kiss, and John took it gladly. He slid his hand up into Sherlock's riotous hair and pressed his warm, slightly chapped lower lip between his own. He kissed his mouth open with focussed, tender patience, until Sherlock's hands were clutching at John's waist and hips and he was making soft, needy sounds into John's mouth. John was breathing hard himself by now, and he gently broke the kiss while they both got their breath back. He buried his face in Sherlock's long neck and dropped a few more kisses there, lingering at his suprasternal notch, before bringing his hands up to frame it and pulling back a bit to look at Sherlock, who was gratifyingly disheveled. John smiled.
Sherlock is still alive, and John is here and safe and kissing him.  John forgave him, again.  John wants him to stay.  John’s breath is coming in soft little bursts against Sherlock’s cheek, and he is so very warm under Sherlock’s hands, and life is (suddenly, breathtakingly) perfect.
"Yes, fine.  I'm not hungry," he sulks, but it's a token protest and they both know it.
John glares at him over the top of the newspaper, his hair still damp and tousled from his shower.  "What, Sherlock."
John reached for his tea. He was going to need it for this conversation.
He sheds his suit, his coat, his armour, again.  He left his coat with Mycroft, exchanged it for nondescript T-shirts and hoodies that make him look like a misguided tourist.  The ill-fitting fabric sloughs off of him like a skin every time he changes his identity.  He doesn’t feel like himself without his suits, without John, but he’s not meant to.
Sherlock makes him want to write things.  He unfolds John's life and reads it like a map before vanishing with a wink, leaving John's existence to undergo a seismic shift.  It reorients itself around the space where Sherlock had been, and everything else gets buried in the subsidence.  Sherlock only gets more dangerously fascinating, not less, and within a day John has moved in with the man and shot a stranger for him with his very illegal Sig Sauer.
John chokes out a laugh. “Me too. Here at the end of all things.” He finally smiles, in the way he has when he’s made a pop culture reference he knows Sherlock won’t understand. But then John twines their fingers together and rests his head against Sherlock’s shoulder and breathes very carefully, so Sherlock finds that John’s banality is something he can more than forgive.
Sherlock sniffs.  "I can't help it if I have an excellent memory and superior musical skill.  I certainly deleted the rest of the movie."
The way forward is obvious, then.  He'll just have to figure out how to get John to touch him again.
John is safe.  John is happy.  John has what he wants.
He would have liked to have seen John there, in his element, several years and one bullet away from rearranging Sherlock’s life for him, but he has John here and now and that’s quite enough to be going on with.
The next morning, John’s chair is occupied again. The flat feels indefinably warmer with him in it.
"That's fine," Sherlock replies, and fills out the paperwork. He'll bring John back here when his dog is ready to go home with them. In the meantime, he can move his chemicals to the higher cabinets.
"I know you will," John said, and held him tighter, as if he knew what Sherlock was thinking. Perhaps he did, at that. Sherlock had not missed the way John looked at him sometimes when he thought Sherlock didn't see, as if he was memorising him before the final exam. Sherlock was rather wrinkled and bony by this point in life, but John still looked at him like he had that first night, as if the mere fact of Sherlock's existence was something beautiful and miraculous. Perhaps it was, if it had led to this, to the two of them together. John had hurtled out of space like a meteor and left Sherlock a smouldering crater, sending up the smoke signals of his devotion.
Sherlock blinks. “Where are we?”
"Yes," Sherlock agrees ruefully. "Better late than never." And they settle down together on the grass, still so incongruously green, and wait, propped against each other, for the end to arrive. John is a bracing reassurance all along Sherlock's side. He can feel the seismic shift propagating towards them, and see the air on the horizon twist and distort. The sky turns an even deeper red, haemorrhaging out. Immolation glimmers in the distance like embers, and the earth burns, inexorable as a lit fuse.
“Eat, Sherlock,” John exhorts, like he used to, and pushes the basket of bread at him.  “You look like a skeleton.”
Sherlock is meticulous with data; he always has been. All of his experiments and cases and criminal studies are recorded in notebooks and digitally archived and stored in his mind palace, a triune unity of information. Even his informal studies of John are inscribed on Sherlock's neural pathways, the sparks of thought flashing in the same captivating colours as the police lights that glanced off of John’s hair after he shot a man for Sherlock.
But what if he doesn’t?
They walked the last two blocks home in a blissful daze, still drunk on the night and each other. When they entered 221, John glanced toward Mrs Hudson's door, trying to gauge if they'd need to be quiet, but Sherlock just snorted.
John reaches out then, and touches Sherlock's face, his jaw, very gently, and slowly, slow enough to give Sherlock plenty of time to pull away if John's got this wrong.  Sherlock doesn't pull away.  He turns his face into John's palm, eyes fluttering shut, and John's fingertips start caressing lightly, just under Sherlock's ear.
"Do you see, John? Do you get it? We're like those reactants. We—"
Sherlock makes himself leave before John wakes up. They don’t talk about it, but Sherlock can still feel the warmth at every point where John’s skin pressed against his, their pulses keeping perfect time.
John could almost see Sherlock's ruffled feathers relaxing back into place. "Yes, all right." He slanted his eyes at John and opened his mouth as if to say something else, but seemed to think better of it.
When he picks up a few bruises on a case, he wonders what it would be like if John had been the one to mark him.  Sherlock would be able to watch the evidence of John's desire for him being reabsorbed into his body as the bruising changed colour and slowly faded.  Bruises bloom like ink in water on his pale skin.  They’d be visible for over a week.
Sherlock will rejoice.
Now it's Sherlock's turn to blink.  Possibly worth trying once as an experiment, but "That's not at all what I had in mind.  Though if
Sherlock goes back to Serbia.
Sherlock is so alive that he radiates energy like the heat shimmer off asphalt.  Every move he makes seems effortless, as if his mind directly commands his body without any clumsy interpreters of muscle or bone.  He has the physical control and grace of a dancer, all fluidity and fine lines, and John could watch him for days.  He's wiry and deceptively strong, but he's not as tall as you'd think once he's out of that suit and coat.  He’s haughty and ruthless and childish, but also more human than he’ll ever admit.  He's brilliant and infuriating and more than a bit mad, and John can't imagine his life without him anymore.
"John, are you sure you're all right?"
, Sherlock, you do have one."
"You needn't worry about your virtue, John.  If you must know, it makes everything — quieter.  In my brain.  You can't know what it's like, having everything in your head at once.  The physical contact makes it more bearable.  And you didn't seem to mind it either," he adds, a trifle defensively.
“Ta.  Um, you too.  Are you feeling all right?”
"I know, though I beg to differ."
And he could have done; they could have retired together when Sherlock's transport finally betrayed him, and they could have wizened into old men here. He could have watched John shuffle about the house as he grew slower and even shorter, bundled in increasingly terrible jumpers. Sherlock could have measured the tonal degradations in John's hair as it faded from bronze to silver, and seen the sun crown him in argent while the bees rose up behind him like a prayer. They could have been a matched set, wrinkled and diminished but still together and alive, telling death to piss off for as long as possible.
“Jesus,” John groans, “your voice is practically subsonic like this,
"Ah." Sherlock squinted slightly; the little patch of skin between his eyebrows wrinkled up. "Who are you meant to be?"
Sherlock bins the pack after the second cigarette. They taste terrible.
John has stayed, all this time; John will stay until the end, and maybe even after that. He's promised as much, many times and in so many different ways. John will wait for him in the next life, if there is one, just as Sherlock will wait for him if he goes first. They'll set sail into the radiant unknown together. If death is the undiscovered country, Sherlock refuses to chart it without John by his side.
He finds John upstairs, jaw set, cleaning his gun. He has the same look on his face as he did that day at the pool, when he told Sherlock to
"Yes," Sherlock rumbles, and suddenly bristles with impatience.  "Enough talking," he growls, and tips them both down onto the bed, side by side.  John laughs; he can't help it.  He feels like he could do anything right now: take on an army, swim an ocean, fly.  He's invincible, indomitable, because he's so in love with this impossible, inevitable man.
"What? No. Why would I?"
“Sorry, what?”
.  There are so many ways that even someone as competent and combat-ready as John can be taken by surprise, hurt, killed, and Sherlock cannot think past the images and the urgency and the, yes, all right, the
Sherlock blinks.  "But you said — "
to John more clearly than four walls ever could. "You set a very high standard, John," he said, his voice dropping low. John felt heat flood to the tips of his fingers, tingling. Sherlock lifted his chin toward the stairs in invitation, and John bounded up them.
"Dull social conventions have never stopped us before.  You usually rather like it when I ignore them."
What aromatic compounds make up the way John smells? What is the pH of his saliva? What is the frequency and amplitude of his laugh? What is the equation for the steady arc of his shoulders? Which electrolytes are present in his sweat, and would it be more conductive when combined with Sherlock's? What is the specific gravity of his blood?  When John looks at him, do John’s oxytocin levels rise? Do the adrenalin levels in his blood surge when Sherlock stands too close?
John huffs a self-deprecating laugh.  “Other than the victim’s love of ugly shrubbery, no.  Ready to go?”
Sherlock's nose wrinkled up when he saw the punch and the themed refreshments surrounding it. "How fortunate that we already had dinner."
Two evenings later, in a rare case of other people making themselves useful, Harry phones John, who is foolish enough to pick up out of guilt, even though their conversations never go well.  It devolves into a shouting match within ten minutes and leaves John pacing and fuming in the kitchen, looking ready to throw his mobile out the window.
"John.  John.  John."
Their food is delicious, as usual, and after he's paid, he takes John's hand again and leads him down the lane. "And now, for your present — the first one, anyway," he teases, and John laughs.
When their wine comes, he fills their glasses and raises his in a toast. "To many more years together," he says, and John lifts his glass.
"No, I did! I do," John reassures him, and Sherlock feels his shoulders relax. "I was just surprised, that's all."
John makes him brave.
Scotland is intolerable. There are far too many hideous cabled jumpers on the backs of its inhabitants. He wants to set every last one of the offending garments on fire, as a warning to the other Scots and their abysmal aesthetic sense.
They're not young men anymore, and they haven't been for a long time. He can't help dwelling on it at times, especially when he's forcibly reminded of the banal cruelties of age. He has to be mindful of the time he spends bent over the hives in the morning; if he stays in one position for too long, his back aches for days. His mind palace, too, is not what it once was; it would be more accurate now to call it a manor. He and John both find it difficult to sleep through the night, thanks to their deteriorating bladders. It's a challenge to maintain one's dignity when nature is bent on sabotaging it. And he worries about John, who is five years older and moving rather slower these days. His shoulder pains him badly when it rains, and he needs glasses, which he fought against for months. When he had come home wearing them, looking all prickly and puffed-up like a porcupine, Sherlock had stared, enraptured by this magnificently ferocious little creature, and John had glared back, tetchy and spoiling for a fight.
After a few more minutes of listening to John's steady breaths, Sherlock lets his eyes slip shut and starts to drift, secure in the knowledge of John in his rightful place: next to Sherlock.  He floats away on the tide of sleep, and dreams of thrilling chases, the choral, cloistered hum of bees, and his longest-term experiment yet.
He couldn’t say it then, but he lives it every day.
Sherlock grins back. "Not until later. I made you breakfast."
Sherlock laughed, as John had hoped. Making Sherlock laugh was his favourite challenge.
This morning, Sherlock lost another of the hives. He'd gone outside to find thousands of brittle, dead drones, curled up in their hexagonal cells like waxy shrouds. The meagre honey they'd left behind was dripping down the comb like old blood, slow as a funeral dirge. It's the second such hive this season.
In the morning, John's hands find his hair and pet at his curls, and Sherlock breathes into the signpost solidity of John's sternum.
"I'm Indiana Jones, Sherlock. You know, the archaeologist from the films?
. Sherlock tugs slightly in invitation, and John accepts, lying face-down on the bed next to him, still touching him, and meeting his unblinking gaze in the darkness. He can feel the ridges of John's fingerprints against the inside of his wrist. The moonlight pools between them like mercury, lapping against John's edges, and Sherlock doesn't look away.
They engage in their own act of creation, of defiance in the face of destruction. Just the two of them against the rest of the world.
"The one with the loud man and the ridiculous cars.  I can't be expected to remember the title."
"You found it, then."  John feels oddly calm.  He's been waiting for this, even if he wasn't entirely willing to admit it.  Sherlock's lack of personal boundaries can be useful at times.
Sherlock's brow scrunches up in frustration, little folds forming above the bridge of his nose.  John wants to smooth them out with his thumb.  "Just look at the notebook, John."
Sherlock never expected to make it past thirty anyway.
He wonders, occasionally, if he really did break something in the fall, and it has taken him all this time to notice.
Two days later Sherlock comes home in the afternoon. He doesn’t leave the flat much besides from working on cases. But today he has been at the bookshop, has bought a few new notebooks. He couldn’t resist.
Sherlock has 76 filled notebooks.
Sherlock lies on the ground and watches John’s feet moving.
John reaches for the glasses. Touches Sherlock’s hand ever so slightly, then opens the lids.
“You hurt me”, Sherlock whispers. As if he is too afraid to speak up.
Size: 6.5
‘I said, don’t
“Now, tell me. What happened to my bike?”
So one morning John decided to spice things up a bit in this silly game. An experiment, probably. But he wanted it to be a game, and it was his turn to be in charge now.
Sherlock rubs his cheek on the pillow, imagines John lays right behind him. He sighs. He actually sighs a lot lately.
“I do look. What is it, for God’s sake?”
Painful embarrassment pours through Sherlock. He knows that feeling, has felt it a lot of times before.
A hair. Red, thick, five centimetres.
John’s heart turns liquid while his cock is still hard.
“But John…!”
Sherlock nods. John pats his foot, now wrapped in gauze. It doesn’t hurt anymore. He wants to get up.
“No?”
Sherlock cries out, something between a sigh and a growl. He has let go of everything.
“What is that?” Sherlock is curious.
‘Sherlock! That’s our dinner! Take your hands out of the food!’ His mum sounds more astonished than angry.
And then Sherlock feels how an arm is put around him. He leans into this embrace, wants to be closer to John. He wants to get rid of the duvet, the coat. But at the same time he is too afraid to dismantle his protective wall.
When he gets back to England, he’s taken to one of Mycroft’s underground lairs again.  Mycroft is waiting there for him, looking insufferably pleased about something.  He attempts to hand Sherlock the surveillance file on John, but Sherlock lets it drop onto the desk.
“Was Mycroft too busy?” he sneers.
John grinned at him, feeling a bit predatory. "I'm always ready for action with you." At this, Kellerman made a retching sound underneath him. John dug his knee into one of his kidneys.
He heard Sherlock's tread on the stairs and turned to see him striding into the room, dressed as a vampire, bloody hell. John was going to have a difficult time staying focussed tonight.
"I would have stayed with you," John says, "if you'd let me."
John, likewise, knows when Sherlock's brain is tearing itself apart and in what fashion, and can supply the proper antidote. He knows all the best walking paths near their cottage, and sometimes over-exerts Sherlock on purpose to check his lung capacity, even though he hasn't smoked in over a decade. John builds the perfect fires in the winter, ones that generate almost as much warmth as he does. It fills Sherlock with a buoyant happiness, as if his heart is a helium balloon.
When they get back to Baker Street, Sherlock lets John go up first, so he can watch the seventeen steps welcome John back and lift him up to the landing, like hands raised in gratitude.  It’s surreal, the way the scant light in the entryway gathers itself to John.  But then, he belongs here.  He should never cross another threshold but this one, never hang his coat anywhere else.
The journal’s not explicit, exactly, and perhaps not instantly damning — Sherlock is usually too lazy to go through John's things without a reason, though it's been known to happen — but it's more, and more poetic, than he usually writes about his flatmate/friend, and taken as a whole, it's certainly enough to make the world's only consulting detective suspicious.  So John keeps it in his wardrobe, and keeps writing.  He notices everything about Sherlock now; he can't do anything else.  His observations flow out of his fingertips and onto the page, his heart bleeding ink until his hands are drenched in Sherlock.  John hoards moments and descriptions and mental pictures like a magpie collecting treasures, and writes his tribute to Sherlock one sentence at a time.
The first body, that of one of Moriarty’s snipers, is found on a Tuesday. Sherlock is called in to look at it, crumpled up on the pavement like a discarded garment. It’s barely recognisable as human, with vicious slashes to the face, indicating extreme hatred on the part of the killer. There are second-degree burns to most of the exposed skin—clearly done pre-mortem—and deep, ragged wounds to the chest and abdomen, the sources of which are still embedded in the flesh, winking up at him through the viscera. It’s shrapnel, quite a lot of it, as if from a bomb.
He’d said, truthfully, that John was a romantic, but perhaps it rubbed off.  He still catches himself thinking
It helps him remember to breathe, at least.
"Soppy," he said, but he was trying and failing not to smile, so the word had no sting.
the work of a serial killer, the number six could have symbolic significance; six is considered the number of less-than-perfection, of man as opposed to God (who is represented in 7’s and 3’s), hence 666 as the devil’s number.
"For God's sake, Sherlock, I'm not going to kiss it better!"  John tenses, clearly ready to fend Sherlock off if necessary.
When he wakes up, John is waiting for him, as he promised. It’s dark here, wherever they are, and Sherlock’s eyes don’t seem to be adjusting, but he can see John’s, two fairy lights in the Stygian gloom.
"Shall we?" John asked.
He plays his violin quite often now. There wasn’t time to bring his chemistry equipment, and the cases are unavoidably cancelled, but the music distracts him and keeps John from pacing like a caged tiger. Sherlock plays all of the most sentimental pieces in his repertoire, and John always stops to listen, watching Sherlock with something unnameable in his eyes. Sherlock watches back and lets his fingers retrace the mathematically marvellous proportions of his violin, while his eyes do the same to John.
He would not like to live in a world without John Watson in it.
John blinks down at him suspiciously.  "There's paracetamol in the loo."
Sherlock stands outside a busy shopping centre in Copenhagen and hunches his shoulders against the night’s insinuating chill. People are susurrating around the nearest entrance in a variegated, multi-coloured mass of humanity, not unlike the pointillist tableau of crowds in a Tube station. If he is bored enough to watch for patterns in their interactions, which he is, he can sort them by family groups, friends, couples. They swirl together and apart and together like shining droplets of mercury. Above them, the stars are prism-bright and lancing, just as they were in a London back alley, well over a year ago now.
When John cries out his name, Sherlock feels the way elemental sodium must when it hits water.
Sherlock had zeroed in on Kellerman and the woman next to him like a hawk spotting a mouse. "That's his sister. He claimed not to have seen her in six years."
In his dreams, he sets his heart upon the water, and waits.
Sherlock mourns on the microscale—the perfect, firework thrill of a case newly solved, of a poison correctly identified; the patina of his violin in the lamplight; the sunlit warmth of John’s voice when he says
They eat in companionable silence and then stroll into town holding hands. John glances up at him through his eyelashes, mischievous and fond. The corner of Sherlock's mouth tips up. John is even shorter now than he used to be, though Sherlock knows better than to tease him about it. John may be small and wrinkled and a bit stooped, but Sherlock still finds him lovely to look at and touch and share his life with. He bends down to kiss the top of John's head, for no reason other than to feel the heat of his scalp and to smell the John-ness of his hair.
It's late afternoon, and it's sweltering. It’s mid-September but London is in the midst of a heat wave, so it's more than hot enough inside to make Sherlock irritable as he tries to identify the toxin found on the skin of Lestrade's latest murder victim. Sherlock is sweating, and if it gets any hotter in the flat, the reaction kinetics will be thrown off and he won't be able to do this until tomorrow. He can feel the curls at the nape of his neck growing damp, and a single drop of sweat runs down below his collar. The windows are already open, to no avail, and Mrs Hudson is out, so shouting for her to do something about the heat didn't help either. Even in pyjamas, this is intolerable, and he can barely concentrate. He's almost finished when the heat ratchets up just one more degree and his solution starts to precipitate out. Finally foiled, he lets out a bellow of frustration and slams his fist onto the table just as John walks through the door, home from the clinic. Sherlock freezes, caught, and immediately schools his face into a suitably contrite expression. John eyes him, considering, and walks through the sitting room and the kitchen to him.
John huffs in frustration. "You know exactly what I mean. After we die."
John is the only person he’s ever met who reminds him of London.
It all makes him feel young again, even though this is nothing like London, nothing like the fevered, fanatical loneliness of his youth. Spring here always puts an extra bounce in John's step; he straightens into parade rest when he sees the lush verdure advancing up over the Downs, as if he's waiting for marching orders from Persephone. Sherlock wonders if John likes pomegranates. He should know that by now, probably, but it's never come up. Then again, there are always new things to discover; it never fails to please him, the bottomless paradox of John. Even after all these years, the depths of him are still a beloved mystery. It's almost a sacrament, the learning of new John-facts. The way he feels for John is the closest he's come to an experience of the numinous: it frees him, occasionally, from the prison of the self. But he has no desire for converts in the traditional sense; his blogger is not for sharing. He's perfectly happy to live out the rest of his life in monastic devotion, feeding John and loving John and provoking John just enough to distract him from what Sherlock did to their kitchen table. He would never have thought this would be enough, but then, his younger self had been significantly stupider in many ways. John is the crowning mystery of Sherlock's life — a perfect ten, arguably unsolvable but worth every single second spent in the attempt.
Sometimes it takes quite a long time to connect the next dot. He would have relished the challenge, before.
Sherlock sighs his most put-upon sigh, but once they've watched the first few scenes and he's protested the shoddy science and multiple impossibilities, John relaxes against him in a way that feels as right as springing the last tumbler of a lock.  Sherlock rearranges himself to pull his arm out of the blanket cocoon and lay it along the back of the sofa, which also happens to be behind John's shoulders.  John stiffens and looks over, but Sherlock remains impassive.  "My arm was going numb," he provides, which isn't even a lie, and John gradually unstiffens, having found this an acceptable excuse for what his awful father would have called 'unmanly' touching.  Sherlock breathes out in relief and goes back to cheerfully eviscerating the movie, which John good-naturedly protests but is clearly entertained by.
John needed to write Sherlock in the way he saw him, but it wasn't until he got him down on paper that he realised what he'd actually written.  It's as good as a love letter, and nearly as suggestive.  It takes him the better part of two weeks to come to terms with it.  The entire time, he feels as if it must be written on his forehead, the reason why he's acting so oddly, why he avoids close contact and starts guiltily every time he looks at Sherlock for too long.  He sees Sherlock watching him more closely, but he mercifully doesn't say anything about it.  Those chatoyant eyes disassemble him, but Sherlock's face doesn't tell any secrets.
“That’s right,” John says, proud, as if Sherlock had finally been civil to a client. “You let me down. And do you remember what you promised, Sherlock? What you said you’d do for me?”
It's just that, well.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered shut, and his nose slotted against John's. Sometimes, even now, vulnerabilities were easier to confess this way, and neither of them said the words lightly. "I — yes, all right. If you like."
John would’ve made him eat.
His entire life was an unresolved melody until John appeared.
“Sherlock.”  John is staring at him, blank and unreadable.  “I thought … um.  Jesus.”  He blinks, and moves to the side of the doorframe.  "You can come in, you know."
, and
"Yeah, that sounds nice," John replies, eyes shining, and tucks in to his food while Sherlock watches, pleased. In rather a role reversal, John's appetite isn't what it used to be, so occasionally it's Sherlock who has to remind John to eat.
"Come and find out," John said. "And bring your fangs."
John breaks off in the middle of a discourse—on something, Sherlock’s not sure what, because he was distracted by counting John’s new grey hairs and wondering if their texture or tensile strength is different to that of the brassier strands, and is John at all likely to let him find out—to murmur a statement.  Sherlock startles, caught.
. Its rain-slick, cobblestone hide glistens under the streetlights. Its exhalations crinkle the skin of the Thames and spin the Eye like a pinwheel. The Underground trains thunder through its veins, and the pulse of the City is a constant metronome.
He cannot imagine either of them without the other, not anymore. Sometimes he still has nightmares about those long years apart from John, never knowing if he'd survive to see him again. It had taken several months of apologies and explanations and hideously uncomfortable soul-baring before John relented, but that had been one of the best days of Sherlock's life. So had the day they met, and their wedding; Mrs Hudson had cried all through their vows, and John had shone like a beacon of love, as if someone had built a lighthouse inside him. Sherlock had wanted to sail toward that light for the rest of his life, and still does.
given, just by the way he represents Sherlock to the world.
Sherlock just wants John to come back.
"Where are your fangs?" John asked, half-teasing. The thought of a fanged Sherlock had delicious possibilities.
"Hmm," John teased, bringing his hands up to Sherlock's waist. Sherlock arched slightly into the touch, like a pleased cat. "Did you have a plan in mind?"
For a moment, he wonders if Mycroft might be behind this, but no: Mycroft would never be so dramatic about killing, not even when it was done to make a point. So, serial killer, or just a very specific vendetta?
For John's birthday, Sherlock makes him tea with his favourite orange blossom honey, cooks him breakfast, and gently kisses him awake.
Sherlock has had so much time to review pros and cons and likelihoods, and despite his panic, no matter how many times he ran the variables, he always concluded that the benefits outweighed the risks.  John, who is good and generous and kind, will almost certainly not leave him if he can’t return Sherlock’s words.  If necessary, Sherlock is still a good enough liar that he could make John believe it was a misunderstanding, that he hadn’t really meant it in
It has been sixty-two days, eight cities, and twenty-two members of Moriarty’s network since Sherlock last saw London. Mycroft sends him money and surveillance photos of John, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade. Mrs Hudson looks smaller and thinner, and Lestrade is obviously exhausted, worn ragged around the edges.
“Your hypothesis has merit,” gasps Sherlock, “but it could do with further study.”
It never gets easier, but it does become routine.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, and opens his mouth.
He looks at the stars and thinks about decaying orbits and how, if John is a black hole, Sherlock passed his event horizon long ago.
John laughs outright, his eyes crinkling up charmingly at the corners.  "Yeah, that's definitely your life motto.  All right, then?"
Sherlock closes his eyes and concentrates on breathing in through his nose, out through his mouth. John’s other hand comes to rest in his hair, stroking, and Sherlock can feel his curls dissolving and reforming around John’s fingers.
"I was cold," Sherlock protests, as pathetically as he can manage, and lifts a corner of his blanket cocoon.  "If we share body heat, we'll recover more quickly.  It's science, John."
The landscape here is sometimes quite pleasing, when he leaves his mind long enough to notice it. At night, the stars are viciously beautiful, and the sight of them makes him ache fiercely for John every time.
"Yeah, it does that," John says, a bit testily.  He stretches up onto his toes to reach for their mugs, bringing the crown of his head level with Sherlock's eyes.  "We don't all spend an hour and six products on our hair in the morning."
For the first time in his life, Sherlock prefers not to think too deeply about the circumstances behind a murder.
“You’re needed at home,” says Anthea, and lowers her hood.  Her mouth purses in a faint moue of distaste at the state of his person.
When Sherlock was five years old, he got his first chemistry set. It came in a leather carrying case with latches that opened with a satisfying
"Um. Thank you?" John says, and leans back a bit to free himself from Sherlock's arms.  "Sorry.  I don't know why I keep trying with her sometimes.  She's too stubborn for her own good."
He watches the buildings blur by behind John in the cab window, watery and indistinct, and remembers the first time he saw London.  He was three years old, and the instant affinity he felt for this man-made amalgam of skin and steel filled him up and fascinated him like the tempestuous strains of Beethoven.  London had its own music, its chaotic complexity humming around him like a beehive, and it was astounding that something so monolithic could also be so intricate and multi-faceted.  He learned the City with the obsessive alacrity he reserves for truly precious things.  Its buildings and roads became the foundational architecture of his mind palace, stratified levels of storage that would never be exhausted, because even the ancient Romans were just upstart colonists when they took Londinium.  It’s deceptively simple from the outside, but even someone as brilliant as Sherlock could study it for a lifetime and never be bored.
Sherlock is across the room before he even realises it, stepping none-too-gently on the prone body of the killer on the way.  He grabs John by the shoulders to turn his body square to Sherlock's, looking him over with eyes and hands, circling him, patting him down to check for hidden injuries, and not pausing for breath until he's sure that John emerged intact.  John looks surprised but lets it happen, and his bemused expression turns to concern when Sherlock realises that his own limbs are trembling, just slightly, from the adrenaline comedown now that it's over and John is still alive.  He's always hated that his body betrays him this way, but he's never been able to stop it happening, so he normally settles for hiding it.  But he can't hide from John, here, now, and a small, reckless part of him doesn't even wish to, so he forces himself to meet John's eyes again and sees only gentleness and affection.
“I did promise,” John answers, thoughtful, “and I’ve not forgot. But you’ll have to wait a while longer, I’m afraid. Just a little while. And I do need your help, so you’re going to have to follow me. Can you do that, Sherlock? I know where we’re going.”
Then: John’s hands, John’s mouth, John’s heart, after all this time.
One of his hotel rooms in Russia has a fireplace with two chairs in front of it. Since Mycroft arranged the reservation, Sherlock makes a mental note to be especially insufferable to him when next he phones. Sherlock flings his bag in the direction of the bedroom, in which he is not going to sleep. He does not stare too long at the empty chair to the left of the fireplace, and absolutely does not envision John sitting in it, looking up at him in fond amazement.
"You look like a lion when you pounce on our prey like that," he growled, and John shivered.
Well. He does know, but he tries not to dwell on it.
This John, this new version of John, is just ever so slightly wrong, like a skilfully forged sculpture. His hair hasn’t been combed, and he hasn’t changed out of the torn, dirty jumper. His eyes are the exact colour of the water in the pool, blue as Cerenkov radiation.
“Shh, I know. It’s all right. It’ll be like falling asleep, and when you wake up, I’ll be there. Just one more thing for me, Sherlock, and then it’s done.”
"Yes." Awed, Sherlock lifts John's hand to his mouth and kisses it. He keeps his eyes fixed on the points where they connect, on the movement of his thumb over John's knuckles. Their palms clasp together like closed parentheses.
John is there, as he’d been three weeks before the first time Sherlock left, reading the newspaper in the other room while Sherlock finished his experiment. When he glanced up from the microscope, the early morning sun had warmed John's hair and made it glow golden as Midas’ touch.  It crowned John and made him a little king on an upholstered throne. He found himself looking up more often to track the movement of the light across John's scalp. He wondered (out of idle curiosity) what it would feel like to follow the path of the light with his fingertips, to learn the topography of John's skull and the texture of his hair between Sherlock's fingers. Would John let him? Would he giggle and dismiss it as 'Sherlock being Sherlock', or become annoyed and push him away? John could be unpredictable in these matters, so new data was always useful.
“Yes, John.” He doesn’t feel quite so cold now; it’s the difference between February and March.
Someday far too soon, they'll die, and be interred in the same urn: what's left of John transmuted into beloved ash, commingled irreversibly with what's left of Sherlock, forever and ever amen. Someday, they'll be gone — but for now, and later, and for all of the shining times before, Sherlock will give thanks.
John squares his shoulders, a soldier ready to advance.  He smiles, but it’s a sad smile.  “I said, I wish I could have been with you.  I … wanted to be with you.”
"Hey. All right?"
Sherlock feels an answering buoyancy in his own chest at John’s smothered laughter.  It makes him light-headed and dizzy.  He feels drunk, but he’s only had half a glass of wine.
. Sherlock seemed to realise it too, and broke off mid-sentence to glance over at John, who kept gazing back. He had nothing left to hide anymore, nor did he want to.
John’s voice would seem unremarkable to most people, but Sherlock could pick it out of a crowd of hundreds.  He feels it in his marrow when John speaks, down in the secret places where new erythrocytes are made.  Every one resonates at the frequency of John’s voice, rushes out into Sherlock’s bloodstream and gathers in his fingertips in a desperate bid to get to John.  All of Sherlock’s cells are imprinted with John’s words, pulsating in time with the molecules set vibrating by John’s vocal cords.  He’s memorised the timbre of John’s voice when it drops low and dangerous with command, like a hawk stooping to its prey.  Sherlock’s entire body knows the shape John’s mouth makes around his name.
Mycroft's mouth quirks into the beginning of a smile.  "Even so."
From then on, he plots daily about how to engineer prolonged contact with John.
John laughed. "Close enough, I suppose. But now we're watching
When John stretched out his hand to him from the pavement, as though he could freeze him in place by sheer force of will, Sherlock felt an almost gravitic pull. He has not stopped feeling it since.
, like we've been doing?"
It's wonderful.
Sherlock looks down.  John’s hand is on his chest.  Now John is touching his face, tilting his head up so their gazes meet.  John is looking at him with the kind of emotion that Sherlock had thought only existed in bad novels.  John’s fingertips are stroking up the back of his neck, pressing and pulling and drawing him down towards John, and Sherlock goes willingly, will follow John anywhere, even—
He wonders how it would feel to be held by John, or to curve around him in bed, whether all of Sherlock’s molecules would orient themselves toward John, mirroring their embrace on the microscopic level, looking for their counterparts, bonded forever.
Sherlock smiled at him, incandescent. That light in Sherlock's eyes spelled
When one star in a binary star system dies, the other will slowly drift out into space, unmoored and aimless.
"Yeah?" John asks, shakily, and the pad of his thumb sneaks up into Sherlock's hair.
"People don't notice clichéd costumes, John. It will blend right in. You, however . . . " Sherlock eyed him again.
If possible, John’s grin grows even wider.  He looks incandescent, like Sherlock feels, as if his heart has just reached critical mass.
"What?" he'd growled.
"Do you think," John asks, watching the sun set vermillion over the Downs, "that there's anything after this?"
He outran love for as long as he could, but it still found him, stalking him like a lion on the veldt until he finally let down his guard.  Ruthless, it tore out his heart to cherish like a ruddy cabochon jewel.
This calls for more planning.
"Minor, my arse."
"You don't know who the Prime Minister is, but you didn't delete
on your violin."
John reaches out a hand, and beckons him home.
He remembers, because it's the same way he feels when he looks at John.
Happily, since they're both full and sluggish from lunch, it's only a brief walk to Ian's house, and Sherlock tries to enjoy it, to be here and now without worrying about the future. He's only partially successful, but when John squeezes his hand and smiles at him, it's hard to be elsewhere.
"Oh, ta," John says, and rummages for the remote.  This briefly causes the hair stroking to stop, at which Sherlock pushes his head up into John's hand, annoyed.  John huffs out a brief laugh and resumes stroking while he turns the telly on.  Sherlock stretches out full-length, draping his legs over the end of the sofa, and turns his face contentedly into John's stomach while John's sturdy fingers sort through his curls.
Sherlock followed and shut the door behind them. His self-confident grace was back, and he shed his cape in one fluid motion, swirling it off his shoulders in a grandiose movement successfully calculated to make John laugh.
It’s perfectly rational.
He looks at John's clever, dexterous hands and thinks of embryology, of the delicate balance of hormones and growth factors in amniotic fluid that influenced the anatomy and physiology of this person in front of him, and knows that even Lamarck and Darwin would be at a loss to explain the marvel that is John.
On their next case, Sherlock accidentally-on-purpose falls into the Thames.  (He takes his coat off first; he'd managed to find an excuse for that much.)  He didn't intend for John to jump in after him, especially since Sherlock is an excellent swimmer, but John's concern and the urgency with which he pulled Sherlock from the water were nonetheless reassuring.  Sherlock can still salvage this.
"That programme you like is on," he offers, magnanimous in victory.
John sets the puppy down on its kennel bed so that he can cup Sherlock's face in his hands. "I promise," he says, and kisses him.
This is going to be the best story John's ever told.
, and
Sherlock smirked, and his eyes looked ready to swallow John up like the Big Bad Wolf. The night was clear and sharp and cold, and John's senses were all tuned to the purring thrum of Sherlock's voice and the adrenaline in his own veins. They'd caught another killer, one more bad man off the streets thanks to them. It was an excellent evening, and it was likely to get even better before the day was done. The tilt of Sherlock's mouth guaranteed it.
"Shut up!" Sherlock's cheeks were turning pink. John rocked up onto his toes to kiss one of them.
Sherlock puts on his best sad, pleading expression.  "John.  I think I might have a bruised rib from the chase.  You should probably check.  In the interest of medical thoroughness."
In a way, Sherlock was right: falling in love really is the end of the world.
Sometimes, John is under him, pupils blown dark and deep as mine shafts, and Sherlock presses the pads of his fingers into all the right places until John opens up like a puzzle box for him.
He spends the rest of the day staving off panic, looking for any possible solution, an ameliorating gift to give to John when he comes home. Sherlock made a vow, after all.
John’s eyes turn hard. “It’s mine now,” he says, “all of it. What would you do, to have me back again?”
Since things have been progressing so well, Sherlock allows what he deems a suitable adjustment period — surely another week of regular contact should be enough for even John's slower brain to acclimate — before he crawls into John's bed at three in the morning.  John's bed is an immediate improvement over his own, due to the presence of John in it.  He nuzzles into the John-scented pillow and resolves to buy John better sheets.  These can't have a thread count higher than three hundred, and he strongly suspects they're at least thirty percent polyester, for God's sake.  He shudders, and John freezes, coming instantly awake.
"Which one?"
"Unnecessary," Sherlock murmured.
"Do you have a Halloween costume?" Sherlock asked, apropos of nothing. John put down his fourth Hobnob and blinked at him.
"You git, you took my blanket.  Budge up," John says when he returns.  Sherlock blinks his drooping eyelids open and looks as immovable and languid as possible.
When Sherlock cares about something, he analyses it, takes it apart piece by piece.  He dreams about doing the same to John.
"Your death wish is really coming along," John says, in a tortured attempt at levity.
If it weren’t for the knowledge of their certain death, he’d be perfectly happy.
“Have you really missed the pattern here, Sherlock?” he says, indulgent and almost fond, so like the old John. “Will you let me help you?”
In the morning, Sherlock finds that not only did they both fall asleep at some point, but John also draped himself over Sherlock’s body as if he was waiting for bombs to fall. John’s back rises and falls under the sheets like the bellows of the earth.
Fortunately, it's January, just after New Year's.
"Let's go," Sherlock whispered, and they made a beeline for the exit to cut him off. The back of the house opened onto an alley, and Kellerman was just coming around the corner toward the street when they came out. He froze, wide-eyed with panic.
"Too bad," John says, somehow managing to smile at him through a stern frown while he moves to lean against the wall, taking up watch over the killer in case he regains consciousness.
“Anything, John. I promised you anything, if you’d only come back.”
"It's a big party, John. What are two more people in the crowd?"
"Do you ever wonder," John says, sounding almost accusatory, "what it would be like to completely start over? Do you ever want to?"
Mycroft had said, but that is where the analogy breaks down. He is not growing now; he feels instead as though his world is shrinking down to a single end goal, which is inextricably intertwined with the ache.
"Yes."  Sherlock's face and posture are careful, giving nothing away.  He's holding John's journal in his lap, his hands folded primly on top of it.  But there's a second book, sitting on the end of the bed, a few feet away from Sherlock.  It's one of Sherlock's lab notebooks, black-bound and deceptively innocuous.  Sherlock's eyes flick to it and back to John, and Sherlock inclines his head at it, waiting for John to pick it up.
Sherlock shifts his bum experimentally.  "Ah.  Yes."  He fishes it out from where it's fallen between the cushions.  "I'll give it to you if you promise not to watch a Bond film.  Or anything that claims to be 'reality'.  And come
John turns, dislodging Sherlock's hands, and regards him with what Sherlock considers unwarranted amusement.  "Sure it does.  I guess the shelf full or hair care products in the loo is just for show, then?"
, and still trying to protect him, futile though it is. “It has its advantages,” Sherlock says softly, and helps John find the kettle.
“Do you see, Sherlock? Do you understand why it has to be this way?”
It's fanciful, but sometimes he thinks that when they put him on a morgue slab, all of the places on his body that John has ever touched or nudged or brushed against in the hallway will fluoresce under the black light and illuminate him like the scene of a crime, with the thin skin over his heart glowing brightest of all.
Nine days after John's daughter is born, the apocalypse starts.
It’s adventure, and epic poetry, and the holy despair of loving someone who will never love you back.
"Isolating the toxin from Lestrade’s latest case, but the heat ruined it. It's an irreversible reaction; I can't salvage it now."
love with Sherlock.
What if he says them, and John leaves?  What if he laughs, and
John is here, and Sherlock loves him, and John loves him back.
John shies away from his hands, but smiles at him all the same, just out of reach.
Sherlock could easily become accustomed to this.  He rarely touches anyone, unless it's necessary for a case, but touching John produces an extraordinary sense of satisfaction and warmth, like playing violin in the lamplight while John watches.  There are no mathematics that can explain it, though something more subjective like hedonic calculus or Maslow's hierarchy of needs might come close.  He's been building a battalion of supporting arguments in case John protests, in case he demands a reason why.  Sherlock doesn't want to lose this.
“I thought that we can put flowers in a window box. I’ve read that bees like lavender. So I went to a florist’s. We can put it on your window sill so you can watch the bees from your bedroom.”
“Sherlock, I never meant to hurt you! Please, believe me!”
“Go away!”
John is in the shower and knows that he is watched. It’s the third time in two weeks. He hasn’t closed the transparent shower curtain completely because he doesn’t want to block the view.
He looks into Sherlock’s eyes from above, and Sherlock can feel an afterglow inside him.
“Okay”, Sherlock agrees quietly.
“Doesn’t matter now. Where are you hurt?”
have in mind?”, Greg responds.
Habits: Growing too small (because of being in the washing machine too often)
John is already back from work. He is in the kitchen, preparing dinner. It smells quite delicious, Sherlock has to admit.
John touches his arm, looks him in the eyes. “You know that they are no pets, right?”
The door bell rings. So Mycroft has arrived already. Sherlock won’t hurry for him. Back in his bedroom Sherlock takes his time to decide what to wear today. It’s rather inconvenient that he has to get dressed. But he definitely won’t wear shoes. They are only going over to his parents after all. No need to be formal.
“Maybe we can change the flat into something more cosy?”, John says now. “So it feels more like a home?”
“Don’t compare me to Mycroft.”
One two three
John looks sceptically, his lips form a fine line. His flatmate looks a bit crazy while he hobbles over the floor, muffled in this big white sheet.
Still in his coat he sits down on his bed, frees the toy from the box.
“Damn it! What’s with your hand?”
They fit tight, accentuate John’s abs and biceps. He makes some moves in front of the mirror. He needs to work out again to maintain his muscles. He can start tomorrow, right in their living room. Observed by Sherlock. A payback for when this idiot crawled over the floor like a baby to collect dust for his damn collection, and waggled his delicious ass.
“Bookshop”, Sherlock answers, takes off his scarf, stops under the door frame.
“It’s the easiest when you lay down on the floor and put your foot into my lap”, he orders.
He takes a step forward.
‘Get your own.’
John is back with his kit and clean towels soon. He sinks down on the sofa. Takes Sherlock’s hurt foot in his hand. Rests it on his leg. Wipes the blood away. Careful. Gentle.
“Let me go, please”, Sherlock begs.
The next day Sherlock is told to finish the project without a partner.
“Er, Sherlock? I guess it’s a bad connection. I’ll send you the address. Hope to see you soon.” Detective Inspector Lestrade ends the call.
John stays in front of Sherlock’s bedroom door for a while. Wants to make clear if everything is alright with his flatmate. You never know what might have happened to him this day.
“You are not helping me with the cleaning, are you?”
He knows that he can’t banish the thoughts of John from his head and heart. But he can try to condition his body to stop reacting to these thoughts. He has to.
On the kitchen table sits a box. Opened.
John is gone. But he needs John.
He creeps and crawls, his bare skin bleeding. He reaches the stone. His red blends with the glow. He takes the stone. It is warm. It is his heart. And the coldest heat and the most blazing coldness, the loudest screaming pain and the keenest whispers rush through his veins.
Sherlock opens his eyes. Too bright. Blinks. Pulls the sheet over his head. Better.
“I’m nearly finished”, John says. “And after that you stay in bed and don’t move even the slightest. How can one manage to rip open his foot twice a day?”
“John?”
“Sit.”
Lestrade shares a look with John.
“John, I need help.”
A twitch between Sherlock’s legs, a dragging in his loins.
‘Where?’, asks Mycroft.
He is on his phone, calls his parents. His Mum answers right away.
John leans against the cool tiles, water pours over his body. His dick is twitching and he already feels the tension building in his loins.
Sherlock gets up, grabs his basket, makes a big step over the fence to demonstrate how small it is.
‘I am not a childminder’, Mycroft replies. ‘It was his idea.’
Together they spend the next three hours stepping on furniture, cursing, waving with their hands, opening every window, more cursing. It’s John who swears the most. While Sherlock grows quieter and quieter.
Sherlock is tempted to catch a common brimstone. Its wings are nearly translucent.
Scraping (Dust pan, glass splinters, bristles of a broom)
: Observing John in the shower.
So he turns to the wardrobe.
With a towel John dries the drops from Sherlock’s face.
“I’m glad to. I didn’t know that you still like him. I’ll send him out today. But now tell me, how do you do?”
Then Sherlock kneels down, empties the content of two baskets on the floor. Socks and pants.
“I heard that sound in your bedroom yesterday”, John then says.
“What’re you analysing?” John leans over Sherlock’s shoulder. He can smell his flatmate’s clean scent of shampoo and soap.
Instead the arms reach me again. They rear up. They want to climb my shins.
“Right.” John nods. Licks his lips. “Right. My new bike, that I have not even tested once, needs a new bell, a new light and a paint job.”
‘Of course it is!’
“It’s just totally fine to have some relicts from our childhood. You don’t need to be embarrassed about it.”
They are tucked away in the bottom drawer. When he had not yet built his mind palace, he wrote everything down into these little notebooks. He was merely five years old.
He has fallen down from the sky, lays on the floor in John’s room again. Becomes aware of the big wet splodges on his stomach. Suddenly the excitement is gone, leaves purple sadness.
“Are you awake?”, he whispers.
Once more Sherlock wants to touch himself. He jiggles around. Claws his fingers into his thighs.
“Some fled?”
There is a white sting inside Sherlock, between his heart and stomach. He gasps. He can see him now, feel him.
‘Easter! It’s Easter, Sherlock. If you’ve already forgotten.’
Sherlock doesn’t answer. He thinks John doesn’t expect an answer.
Nevertheless. The door has been opened ajar.
When the disinfection spray hits the hurt area Sherlock shivers. Absent-minded John strokes his foot a few times while working on the wound.
He opens his eyes, hasn’t realised they were closed before.
“I’m bleeding.”
Oh, how much he wants to come all over Sherlock’s pretty face! Jam his length between Sherlock’s delicate lips, deep into his throat so he has to gag a few times. And all this time his flatmate would look at John from below, his lashes fluttering, tears in those big astonished eyes. Too perplexed to realise what’s going on. But John would show him how to suck a cock,
“Morning. It’s Lestrade. We need you.”
Sherlock lays on his side, facing John, curled around Bumble. He looks a lot younger with his eyes closed. John bends over him and presses a light kiss on his curls. Sherlock sighs in his dreams. John’s heart turns warm. “Good night”, he whispers.
The buzzing sound coming from his basket increases. The bees don’t like to be shaken inside their little prisons. And twenty-seven startled and angry bees can make a lot of noise.
“John is right, we need to go there, right away!”, Sally insists.
“Maybe I should speak to your flatmate. He can keep an eye on you.”
“Are you okay?”, John asks.
He stumbles. He crashes through a window, falls into the darkness, falls to the ground. He watches the walls disappear. He screams.
“Don’t answer. That was a rhetorical question.”
Sherlock runs his fingers through the thin paper strips. Pulls them aside to get a better look at what is inside the nest. Chocolate eggs in colourful wrapping. He picks the green one. Pulls back the foil. The scent is strong, the taste stronger. Delicious. Easter isn’t that bad with John.
I grab the handle, I bolt into the room. The door shuts behind me, I hear the sound of the lock. Four times.
His hand moves over his cock, faster, faster.
John kneels before him, caresses his knees.
“Maybe you need glasses, you know. Those bites were obvious to the eye. At least to mine”, Sherlock continues.
Sherlock is intrigued.
Burnt.
“Only wanted to learn how to ride a bicycle.”
A quiet hum comes from inside.
He should thank John for the bee. So he grabs his mobile phone, takes a photo of the flowers, deletes the photo because it’s a bit too postcard-like, writes a short message instead.
He opens his eyes widely. He is confused.
“Petri dishes”, Sherlock answers. He fiddles with the tape, opens the box. “500 pieces.”
He should ban him from the kitchen completely. No experiments, no cooking, no nothing. Or he should punish him for every time he makes a mess. Take Sherlock’s riding crop, he used to use to hit corpses with, and smack it onto his round, posh ass. Leave red whip scars on that white skin.
. He snorts.
John’s facial expression. His hands. The inside of the doctor’s kit. The bandage.
“Maybe tomorrow”, he backs off.
“Yeah, bit bossy, again”, John whispers.
Why does John use a different email address for a dating website?
“You what?”
John points at his flatmate without any words. Glances at him for a few more seconds.
Sherlock spots three bees on the sweet violet. It’s easy to catch one of them. He puts the container back into the basket, continues his walk to Regent’s Park.
Then he starts with facts about John.
“Maybe they just arrived late and wanted to get their stuff unpacked, no matter the time”, Greg says.
An explosion of colourful, blazing fireworks shoots through Sherlock when he finally grabs himself. He is astonished and amazed. Confused, intrigued, fascinated.
John wants them to go on a bicycle tour together. John wants to spend a day out with Sherlock. Wants to recreate a happy memory. Wants to share some of his good times with Sherlock.
“I can open them”, John says, his voice soft.
Sherlock lets out a hiss, interrupts John’s thoughts.
“Solved it yet?” John’s smiling at him, as if he knows that this is a foregone conclusion.  It is, of course, but it’s unfailingly pleasant to have John think so.
What seems truly necessary is that he should
way.  Or, even if John wasn’t convinced, he would allow them both the excuse to pretend it never happened, and they could have whatever friendship might be left to them.
"Ah, thank you. That's lovely." John heaves himself up, and Sherlock gives him a gentle assisting push. John toddles into the bathroom, and Sherlock takes a moment to appreciate the way the sun glints off of John's hair like freshly fallen snow. (He tried calculating the albedo once, but got distracted by the sea-deep blue of John's eyes and the glitter of his stubble in the morning light.)
He hasn't studied this killer long enough to be sure which way he would go, but he knows John, and John, when stalking someone who was stalking him, would have stayed in cover, would have kept to the higher ground with a vantage point where he'd have a clear shot.  Given the surrounding streets and the direction John would have come from, that leaves only one building, and Sherlock rushes for it, heedless.  He shoulders past the door hanging off its hinges and inside, slowing just enough to start searching for signs of life, signs of John, when he hears an ominous thump from the far end of the hall.  He sprints for it, practically falls through the door, and nearly stumbles in relief at the sight of John, seemingly unharmed, with the killer unconscious and bloodied on the floor in front of him.  John is tying the killer's wrists behind him with one of the zip ties he's taken to carrying around, another extension of his practicality.  John straightens up, short and unafraid and perfect, and grins at him.  "What took you so long?"
John starts muttering under his breath.  It sounds intriguingly like very creative swearing.
While he is away, he reads dozens of books on astronomy, because he needs something to occupy his mind and because he is still trying to define the serrated edge of longing that seizes him whenever he studies the subject.
He wrote about a few boys too during that time, and later on at uni, but they sure as hell never knew about it.
But Sherlock has John, finally, exclusively, and—well. There are worse ways to die.
It's lovely, actually: the soft nubbly cables of John's oatmeal jumper under his fingertips, snagging just slightly on his violin calluses; the comforting smell of John, of home, wool and tea and gun oil mixed up with the faint tang of chemicals and the musty smell of old wallpaper overlaid with the scents of wood and rosin. John's body heat bleeding through his clothes, just a bit hotter than average.  The hesitant shift of John's shoulders, not exactly uncomfortable but still unused to this, still wondering if this is really within the bounds of 'things mates do' and whether Sherlock will take it the wrong way (which is ridiculous, since Sherlock has no more than a passing academic interest in John's penis and certainly no sexual designs on it).
John sighs in a rather insultingly put-upon manner, but drops the paper.  "You were fine when I checked you the other day.  Does something hurt?  Are you having trouble breathing?"
He hangs his hood and coveralls by their front door where his Belstaff ought to be, but he and John don’t go out anymore; there’s nowhere safe to go.
"Yes, I suppose so.  Thank you," he adds, at which John looks at him even more suspiciously but returns to his chair.
"I mean — that you'll have to stick around to take care of it. The dog. Just the dog, of course, no one else. You'll have to stick around for a good while longer, John. Years and years yet. I'm sure it will be a very long-lived dog." He's babbling, he knows, but it's hardly the first time.
"Are those the face-melty ones?"
Sherlock could drown in those eyes.
When Sherlock climbs up to John's bedroom with the pills and a glass of water, John's waiting for him, having just plugged in his mobile to charge.  Sherlock passes the water to John, who swallows the pills, gingerly takes his shirt off, and kneels on the bed.  The bruising starts between John’s shoulder blades, near the T5 vertebra, and extends up his back and onto the nape of his neck.  There’s darker, livid aubergine blood pooling under his skin, forming an outline to match the edge of the skip that John was thrown against.  Sherlock sits down behind him for a closer look.  He can feel the heat radiating from John’s skin, the inflammatory response as John’s body tries to rebuild damaged tissues.
When this thought makes the corners of his mouth pull up and his throat constrict, he is taken almost entirely by surprise.
The next day, while John is reading his morning paper, Sherlock makes a more concerted attempt.
He wants to read every word of the book that is John, from beginning to end.  He wants to stroke his spine and the gilded edges of his pages.
"What was that for?" John looks up at him, and his eyes are smiling.
When the air becomes a heavy molten heat against his face, he looks away from their hands and back to John and takes a shaky breath. John's eyes are smiling at him, even as the world goes white as starlight.
For a man like Sherlock Holmes, ‘anything’ is a very broad promise indeed.
It's more than just bodies, when they're together this way; it's something else entirely. He can feel every tiny quivering movement of John's frame where he's pressed against him, and it's as if Sherlock doesn't fully exist until John touches him solid with his hands and speaks him into existence with his mouth, offering up little gasping breaths and hitched moans against Sherlock's skin.
.  While this lacks the sharp relief of the crime scene contact, there's a whole different warmth in the knowledge that John trusts him enough even for this, this contact that he wouldn't give to any other friend, especially not a male one.  It's the sort of trust that makes Sherlock want to live up to it.  And also, of course, to have this again.  While he's aware that he touches few people and seldom, he didn't expect what a beneficial effect introducing physical contact would have on his well-being, and also, it seems, on John's.  They are mammals, after all, so perhaps he shouldn't find the oxytocin release of social bonding such a surprise, but it's his most unexpected finding in years.
"Ow!" John protested.
When he gets home from work and goes upstairs to drop off his bag, Sherlock is sitting on his bed, one step ahead of him like always.
Sherlock smiled, as if in memory of the dustup. Or of John's arse.
Downstairs, Sherlock sets the table while John takes a shower. When John returns, he's wearing the cobalt button-up that brings out his eyes. He saves it for days when he's feeling particularly affectionate toward Sherlock, so the morning is off to an excellent start.
He watches John move about the flat and thinks about volumetric displacement, and wonders how it's possible for John's displacement to be so disproportionate to his size.
"Yes," Sherlock murmurs, eyes wide.  "That would be — good, John."
A mere month ago, in another life, Janine Hawkins, née Moriarty, was arrested for tampering with the British Telecom network, and her property was seized by the British Government. When Mycroft suggests that Sherlock and John leave while they still can, he offers them the cottage in Sussex. They flee to the country like children in a wartime drama. Sherlock brings his violin, and John brings his gun.
Whenever he arrives in a new city, Sherlock calculates the distance back to Baker Street. It is a mental tic he can’t seem to shake, horridly sentimental though it is.
Several of the scrub bushes are a precise match for the colour of John's hair.
“John, what I’m trying to say—what I wanted to say before I left—is that I … love you.  John Watson.  I love you.”
John palms the notebook and picks it up, opening it to the first page.  Sherlock's scrawled handwriting fills every line, barely legible, but John can make most of it out.  Each page is dated, starting from February 2010.  It's Sherlock's observations of him.  They get more detailed, and personal, as the dates progress.  John’s eyes widen a bit at the lengthy monograph about why tea made by him is superior to tea made by anyone else, and when he gets to the section that records his known emotional responses to different violin pieces, John realises that, coming from Sherlock, this is an astoundingly obvious admission of sentiment.
"Not joining me?" John says wryly. Sherlock blinks and then steals one of John's jars of jam to spread on his toast.
At the graveyard, he’d stood chill and quiet as the marble slabs around him and watched John say goodbye, his face a slow-motion demolition before Sherlock’s eyes.  John had limped away, and Sherlock had gone the opposite direction, to protect John rather than release him from his grief.
Sherlock swallows.  "Yes, fine."  He pops into the loo for the medicine while John drags himself up the stairs.
"Sherlock, did you . . . buy me a puppy?"
There must be some method of preservation. Surely, in a just universe, one of the laws of thermodynamics would have accounted for this and provided a loophole, some way in which all the discrete quanta that comprise their material existence could remain intact.
"I do know, Sherlock," John says. "I—me too." He laughs. "Better late than never, I suppose."
Sherlock looks anywhere but at him.  He starts talking, quickly, tripping over his own words and clutching at the journal with his fine-boned hands.  "I — am saying that I find myself fascinated with you as well, in all ways.  I thought perhaps, since you've already written a book about me, and I've written one of sorts about you, that possibly — you might like to collaborate on the next one.  Since collaboration has proven productive so far, for the Work and — other things."  He draws in a deep breath, and now he does look up at John, finally.  His eyes are uncharacteristically earnest, and he looks a bit unsure and heartbreakingly young.  "I would like to continue observing you indefinitely, John.  For as long as you'll permit it.  I think I may never have enough data where you're concerned."
Sherlock feels warm and relaxed and — he has to search for the word —
It takes, on average, 3.2 minutes to get his heart rate back to its baseline value.
It would be so good to see John again.
The three of them work on the garden together, weeding and pruning and coaxing it further into bloom until it's fragrant and vital, a feast for the eyes and for the bees. Sherlock gets freckles from being out in the sun, and John counts and tends them with the same care Sherlock gives to his bees. It's good and it's now and it's everything Sherlock would've never thought to hope for. It may be the twilight of their lives together, but it's no less beautiful for that.
“Anything,” Sherlock breathes, and knows it for the truth as soon as he’s said it.
Oh, shit.
"This one, I think," he says to the breeder, Ian, who smiles back.
“What’s so funny?” John says, gently, and brushes a hand down Sherlock’s throat, tracing his suprasternal notch with his thumb.  This is novel and marvellous, and Sherlock finally stops laughing so that he can record the sensation in his mind palace, in the newly expanded room for John-Induced Somatosensory Feedback.  When he’s done, he waves a hand in the direction of the table.
It’s appallingly sentimental, and yet undeniably comforting.
Sherlock suddenly goes very cold.
Well, technically it's a journal, consisting of things John doesn't want to put on the blog, for reasons he doesn't care to examine too closely just yet.  Things like the way Sherlock's clever fingers move when they're picking a lock, John keeping lookout with only half his attention, or the way veins stand out in Sherlock's sinewy forearms when he plays Sarasate at three in the morning in his pyjamas.  Or the way his throat goes on for miles, carved and cool as a Corinthian column, or how summer sunlight gets trapped in his hair like an insect in amber.  The way his voice curls like a contented cat around the syllables of John's name, or how Sherlock can smile at him using only his eyes, mischievous and knowing.
Five days and three visits to charity shops later, John had finished excavating the wardrobe in his old bedroom and was putting the finishing touches on his costume. He was wearing a sand-coloured safari shirt with khaki trousers, a low-slung leather belt with attached gun holster, his brown leather bomber jacket, and a brown felt fedora. He hadn't shaved this morning either, to complete the ensemble. Since he'd already had the jacket, this had been a reasonably easy costume to throw together last-minute, and it made him nostalgic for afternoons at the cinema as a kid.
"Hear, hear."
How pedestrian of him.
Three nights later, John does.
It’s raining in sparse, fat drops, falling slowly, struggling through the thick air. The smell of it, damp and oddly musty, is rare here, in the middle of the Mojave Desert. This town is a geographical anomaly, and he is too conspicuous here, sticking out like an orchid in a field of dandelions.
Sherlock swallows.  “Yes.”  He experiences a stab of guilt at the mention of pain meds, since he’s the reason they don't have anything stronger in the flat.  This, combined with Sherlock’s intense relief that John is all right and not brain-damaged or worse, leads unexpectedly to Sherlock leaning into John’s back, forehead resting at the base of John’s neck and breathing onto John’s spine while trying not to hyperventilate.  He clenches his hands in the sheets to prevent them from clamping onto John without his permission.
“It’s a place for people like us,” John says, and Sherlock can hear the smile in his voice.
No one would have expected him to be so good at disappearing, but he's had a lot of practice this year.
“I’ll find out for myself this time.”
"Sorry," John murmurs, and squeezes the nape of Sherlock's neck. Sherlock's breath hitches as his perception narrows entirely to the points of contact between John's fingertips and his fevered skin. He looks up at John, which is dangerous, but he can't help it. John seems caught, and his pupils are dilated. He looks flushed, and though he's beginning to sweat too, Sherlock doesn't think it's just from the heat. His own pupils dilate even further as he takes all this in, wonders about electrolytes again, combines it with John's hand on the back of his neck and John's shallow breathing to come to an astounding conclusion.
John, still smiling, bent to retrieve his fedora from where it had fallen during the tussle, just shy of a shallow puddle, and they set out for home. Sherlock fell into place beside him, a bellows-breathing shadow. John could feel the heat of him even through his jacket, and their quick breaths fogged the air. Their hands brushed, and he turned his palm to Sherlock's, tangling their fingers together. Sherlock hummed and tugged John a bit closer, where he could wrap their hands up in the folds of his cape. John glanced over, a fond smile tugging at his mouth.
“John. Why can’t I see you? You promised.” Sherlock knows his voice holds an unwelcome note of desperation, but he feels as though the dark is suffocating him, pressing in from all sides with the weight and nap of velvet.
John goes on like this for a week, until a rainy Thursday arrives, almost entirely unremarkable.  He spends most of his locum hours on dreary NHS paperwork, forgets his umbrella, and endures his last two Tube stops crammed in at rush hour with what seems like half of London.
When Sherlock opens the door to John, he looks worse than Sherlock has ever seen him, haggard and hunted and hurt. “I had a paternity test,” John grits out, posture stiff. “Mind if I stay here for a while?”
In the morning, John is still there, sitting in his chair. He has not made tea. He does not mention last night. Sherlock studies him, trying to brand him onto his memory.
John sits down heavily on the bed at that, a careful distance from Sherlock.  When he puts his hands down on the duvet, he can feel the warmth from Sherlock's body where it's bled into the sheets.  He shivers.
"Sherlock.  God knows I don't want to talk about this either, but I just need to check — are you — is this —
John seems to deflate, all the anger and tension seeping out of him, and a calm determination settles in their place. "Sherlock. Stand up."
As he got older, he turned in his fair share of writing exercises at school, and he even let one of his teachers talk him into entering a secondary school fiction contest, but for the most part, John didn't think about writing much until he discovered how girls reacted to it.  He was already well busy with science courses and medical ambitions and the captaincy of the rugby team, but he wrote his first serious girlfriend a rather long and heartfelt Valentine when he was sixteen, which led, in shockingly short order, to John and Julie in her parents' guest bedroom, moving frantically and clumsily against each other until she shuddered and gave a startled cry, and John came so hard he all but passed out on top of her.  Still, John thought it was a pretty respectable showing for his first time, and even though he and Julie broke up later that year, John kept writing for his girlfriends.  Part of it was self-interest, sure, but he also just liked it.  He liked the way that caring about someone made him pay more attention.  It made him want to keep a record of how he saw them, and of all the things that made them unique to anyone else.
In his dreams, the heart of the city beats on, embodied in the chambers and ventricles of 221B. At its centre sits a homunculus, built of steel and bravery and clad in wool jumpers, deceptively mundane and absolutely vital.
John's always been good at hiding in plain sight.  It's what he's started doing on his blog, now that he's aware of how much he's in danger of giving away, how much he's
Sherlock considers.  The urge to touch John, to check the integrity of his skin with his fingers and verify that it's really whole and healing, to feel the tiny fine hairs and the small variations in texture, not to mention the scar that brought him back to London, is novel and nearly overwhelming.  It’s not sexual, but he wants the tactile connection, the visceral reassurance that John will be fine, that he’s still here with Sherlock and not lying broken in an alley.  But John’s present and breathing steadily, still waiting for his response.
He makes it three and a half months before he’s captured again.  That’s three months longer than anyone else has managed, but still hardly satisfactory.
Sherlock’s jaw snaps shut with an audible click. He abruptly realises that he’s shaking, just slightly. He must be cold again. Why else would he be shaking, if not from the cold?
"Yes," Sherlock allows, and does so.  "Should I take my shirt off?"
John reaches delicately between the fourth and fifth ribs with his index finger and touches Sherlock’s left ventricle. Sherlock’s whole body jerks. John’s hands are cold.
He said he plays the violin when he’s thinking, but now it would be more accurate to say he plays it when he’s thinking about John.  He stays awake nights and pours his frenetic energy into the strings, summons hope and affection and yearning out of his violin’s dark places, like life out of the primordial deep.  It’s evidence of the emotions few people believe him to possess, and he always keeps playing until John wakes up and walks in to bear witness.  The pieces don’t feel finished without John there to hear them.
The last time he was this agitated, he was still using. He could be again. The indicators of a flourishing local drug trade are hideously obvious. He could be stratospherically high within an hour if he likes. And then the noise would stop, the roaring flood of useless stimuli generated by stupid, useless people living their stupid, useless lives and never bothering to be quiet about it. His mind would still to a perfect, crystalline precision, like an elegant mathematical proof, like Bach at his most pristine.
“Scientific progress waits for no man,” John laughs as he lowers his head, and Sherlock finds himself in euphoric agreement.
He'd like to have John's hands at his mouth again, but not for punching.
to save me, at least, even if it wasn’t enough.”
He wonders a lot of things.  He can’t stop wondering.
"Oh," John says softly.  He shifts closer to Sherlock, within arm's reach now.  "You can observe me for as long as you like, Sherlock.  I can't imagine ever wanting you to stop.  Can I . . . observe you as well?"
"Well?"
"Well, I think I'm for bed," John announces not long after.  Sherlock notes the way John's favouring his right shoulder and feels a twinge of concern.
“I wouldn’t have thought you’d like the country,” John says from the kitchen. He’s checking to see how much water they have left, but he pretends to be looking for tea once he spots Sherlock.
Interesting.  The sensations of John's hands sweeping his ribs were pleasant enough, but nowhere near their earlier calming intensity.  While it's possible the stressful situation contributed to the hug's anxiolytic effects, he'd rather not repeat that part of the experiment, so he'll concentrate on the rest of it.  Maybe it has to be reciprocal contact for it to work?  They were essentially holding on to each other, after all.
John's eyes abruptly prickle with heat, and he clears his throat, so incredibly fond of his mad, brilliant friend that he feels incandescent with it, an adoring sunrise in his chest glowing redly through the slats of his ribs.  He lets his palm curl around the dip of Sherlock's waist, gathering him in closer.  "You great bloody romantic."
"Always," Sherlock managed, his voice rough.
"I should hope not," Sherlock sniffs, but he knows John can tell he's mollified. "You'll have to be the one to take care of it, you know. I'm not good at that sort of thing," he says, suddenly a bit nervous.
"Bullshit. You would not. People love me."
John pulled Sherlock's shirt out of his trousers, pressed closer — though not close enough — and smiled against Sherlock's mouth. "Happy Halloween, Sherlock," he said, and set about ensuring that it was a very happy holiday indeed.
"And how do you expect to get in when we've never met him?"
“John …” He stops. John clears his throat, and finally looks up.
John walks over to stand in front of him and tilts Sherlock’s head up. John’s thumb strokes gently across his cheekbone, once, so lightly that Sherlock thinks he might have imagined it.
He's even more dedicated to his writing now, now that he knows (or is reasonably sure) that Sherlock will read what he writes in the journal.  He agonises over every word, wants every clause to be as striking and affecting as he can make it.  He's not at all sure he succeeds, but at least Sherlock will see the effort.  He might even see what it means.  John's finally starting to.
The fifth body is Moriarty himself, still grinning in an obscene death rictus and splayed out in what’s left of his Westwood suit. The tiny skulls on his tie are drenched in blood. It’s Mycroft who summons Sherlock to this crime scene, who shows up there himself and searches Sherlock’s face with shuttered, pale eyes before speaking.
"Bloody ancient? Like someone's grandfather?"
He never thought he’d be in the same place as John again, and now he’s only a metre away.  Their shared breaths fill the space between them and connect them, bear them up on the same current.  If he listens very hard, he can hear the air rushing out of John’s lungs and into his own, rapid and subliminal as the River Fleet.  Sherlock fills his lungs as deeply as he can.  The faint scent of John drapes itself over his hindbrain with the same weight of comfort and familiarity as his Belstaff, and he can feel the ragged edge of his anxiety start to recede.
"Just the opposite, in fact," Sherlock avers, and John's expression softens. They stand barefooted amongst the hives like remembered kings, and the bees emit a low elegiac hum.
Four facts on beekeeping
Sherlock sits up, his knees feel wobbly. He is too afraid to stand up now. Semen runs down his lower abdomen, his hand is damp and sticky. He feels dirty. Not just on the outside.
Sherlock presses himself against the wall. Tears sting behind his eyes. He can’t cry now.
Sherlock’s lips part. His breathing goes shorter now. Feels the twitch again, feels more than just that.
Sighing (John)
John shakes his head. ‘Your parents invited us two weeks ago. For dinner.’
The name lingers on his tongue.
John touches his flatmates knee, squeezes it. Fast.
They are at the sea. He smells the salty water. His trousers are already wet from splishing and splashing. Redbeard shakes his body, little drops coming out of his fur. Mycroft screams, but Sherlock laughs. He dances and jumps around, always followed by his dog.
The tension breaks and John releases a cry, followed by streams of his semen.
Bees Act 1980
He presses Bumble to his chest, wants to curl into a ball around the bee. Wants to be held by John.
“A bit.”
John feels his extremities tickling. Like an anticipation. Restlessness settles inside his stomach.
Regent’s Park or Hyde Park?
“No way! Why do you know?” Sally looks in disbelief.
So he set up a mock account for a dating website and bought a gay magazine.
. And when I come home tonight I don’t want to hear you, I don’t want to see you.”
Sherlock puts the notebook aside. He is confused. There is a feeling inside him he cannot term perfectly. Usually he doesn’t have a lot of feelings. Most of the time he is somewhat neutral. He also knows excitement, curiosity (is that a feeling or more like a state of mind?), a bit of happiness and sadness in equal parts. Forlornness.
And then the burning extinguishes. A pink spike appears. Hurts. Sherlock can’t suppress a whimper.
Sherlock looks up, his eyes read, tears stream down his cheeks. “Go away, leave me alone.”
When he has come home from work two days ago he could tell that Sherlock had been in here again. His clothes were organised.
"That's suspicious, isn't it?", John comments.
Looking up was a bad idea. It makes the sick feeling stretch. His head dizzy. Bile is rising. Sherlock gets up. Hasty. Hectic. His vision blurred for a second. He half runs, half stumbles to the bathroom. Makes it to the toilet just in time. His knees hit the tiles hard.
“Do you clean the flat today?”, he asks.
John sinks down. “What has happened?”
John grabs Sherlock under the arms. Lifts him with surprising strength. Sherlock stumbles. But John is there to steady him. The knee hurts.
He collapses on the bed, bobs around a bit. John’s mattress is too hard. But the sheets smell gorgeous. Like John.
“Show it to me.” John grabs Sherlock’s hand. His palm is red, a burn blister has formed.
“No.”
Sherlock pushes the door open, enters the room. A moment he stays still. The curtains are half closed so everything lays in dim light. It’s quiet, even the street outside keeps silent. Sherlock takes a deep breath, smells John’s perfume. A shiver goes through his body.
The shirts get organised by colour, the trousers by length.
“Leave me alone! You scare me!”
Sherlock sinks on the toilet lid.
John lets his arms hang down his body. Shakes his head. Deflated.
“There is no sign that says that.”
‘Get a move on, Sherlock. Mycroft’s here in a minute’, John urges, his arms elbow deep in the sink.
Fish. They are having fish for Easter dinner.
“What is it?”, John asks.
He turns to a blank page. Titles it.
A memory gets entangled in his thoughts.
“You’re disgusting! Knock yourself out over Adam in a public toilet? That’s sick. We should tell the teachers.” Jimmy blocks the door, the only way out.
“Tell me, what is going on? Did you keep the bees I found? Are there other insects in here?”
“I really didn’t mean to…”
Sherlock’s heart is indulging in reminiscences.
Sherlock stares.
He falls sideways. The bike still between his legs.
Sherlock smiles, his front teeth are missing. He hugs his elder brother.
“No.”
Throbbing (my heart)
It was peaceful to fall asleep and wake up to the bumbling sounds. The bees make his bedroom feel a bit safer. A bit more home.
“Pick up the phone the next time I’ll call you, okay? You are a bit neglectful.”
A shiver of rage runs down John’s spine. He has been Captain Watson for a great part of his life, 112 soldiers were under his command. And not a single one of them ever dared to contradict him. So now it is definitely not the time to allow such an insecure and insolent child like Sherlock Holmes, who thinks of himself as a genius, such pubescent behaviour.
There is a blue circle inside Sherlock, near his heart. He knows that feeling. It’s homesickness. The first weeks after he had moved out of his parents' home the blue circle had been a constant companion.
He tries the bell. The sound pinches his ears and sight. A yellow glare.
“See you later!” Sally waves at them, rushes away, her backpack bouncing up and down. Lip chases after his girlfriend.
Find your partner with one click.
John is wearing grey socks that disappear under the trouser legs of his jeans.
My body is one black mess. My brain is frost nipped. From the rain. Why does this rain feel blue instead of black and grey? Black snowflakes now.
Although it’s very hard to keep it a secret. Sherlock really wants to share something so joyful with John.
“Don’t stare, help me instead”, Sherlock says.
“It’s okay. I got it.” John’s left hand rests on the bridge of Sherlock’s hurt foot. He can feel the touch, finally. Feels the warmth of John’s hand against his cool skin.
He likes their story, his and Sherlock's.  He'd be happy to live in it for the rest of his life.  But after he starts catching himself wondering how best to describe the tilt of Sherlock's mouth when he's amused, or the way that firelight and fondness can turn his eyes warm and contented when he looks at John, John has to admit, if only to himself, that he wouldn't terribly mind if Sherlock wanted more romance in the narrative.  He thinks it's already a love story.
Well. Close enough.
John wants to do Sherlock justice, to record everything that makes him who he is, the good, the bad, and the extraordinary, so that other people can see Sherlock the way John does: not as a freak or a sociopath, but as someone fantastic.  He's difficult and an arse and he makes even John look emotionally mature, and John loves him like he's never loved anyone else.
"I suppose that would be acceptable," Sherlock murmurs. He feels like a small child, afraid of the dark and glad to be comforted. "If you promise, that is. Do you promise?" His voice has grown thready, but then, so has John's.
"I'm straightening it.  You had a piece sticking up."
They settle into the cottage, everything strange and new while the world falls apart outside. It’s not 221B, but it’s home now, because it's where John is. Sherlock finds beekeeping gear in a shed in the garden and repairs the hives, order in the midst of chaos. John watches from the house, convinced Sherlock is going to set off a swarm, but Sherlock knows how to placate the bees. His hands move over them like a conductor’s over his orchestra.
Sherlock's high cheekbones flushed with colour, and he watched John from underneath his eyelashes. His mouth did something complicated, and John felt his heart twist in response. Sherlock could still be heartbreakingly unsure about being loved, even after all this time. John smoothed his thumb down the back of Sherlock's hand, soothing, and his pinky and ring fingers slid back to touch the inside of Sherlock's wrist. He could feel the blood rushing there, jumping up to meet his. John's other hand went to Sherlock's jaw, gently lifting his face up.
Sherlock blinks at this pronouncement, and keeps his opinions regarding Watson stubbornness to himself.
Every time they strike him, something inside him vibrates at the exact frequency of John’s voice saying,
Since the near-miss in Prague, he has avoided graveyards. He found himself dangerously distracted by the vivid memory of John at his grave, standing there stoic and hollowed-out, like London after the Blitz.
Sherlock wakes, breathing hard, from a nightmare of the pool, and immediately wonders if he’s still dreaming. John is there, perched on the edge of his bed, but he looks … different. In the dim light from the street, Sherlock can see that John’s hair is stubbornly mussed, and the front of his jumper is torn and dirty. Sherlock reaches for him without thinking, tries to flatten his palms against John’s chest to search for a heartbeat.
Sherlock closes his eyes.
“The skin doesn’t appear to be broken, just badly bruised," Sherlock confirms.  "How’s the pain?”
“Thanks.” John nods once, tightly, and climbs up the stairs to his bedroom.
"Yes, John." A terrible thought occurs. "Did you not want — "
When his mobile lights up with an incoming call from Mycroft, Sherlock already knows what his brother will say.
Instead, he buys cigarettes in a fit of restless longing. He stands near the tiny slit window of his room and smokes the first one. The nicotine enters his bloodstream in a heady rush, and the attendant modulation of neurotransmitters is almost enough to drown out John’s voice in his head, going on and on about how smoking is awful for you and how Sherlock will probably end up in an early grave if he doesn’t stop.
John hasn't been this happy in years.
"We can share," he murmurs, and burrows deeper into the blankets.
"I blame your writing.  It's a bad influence."  Sherlock grins at him, boyish and delighted, and threads his long fingers into John's hair, pulling him into a kiss.  It's headlong and vulnerable and so very promising, solemn as a wedding vow, and John smiles against his mouth.
It's as close to godhood as he ever feels when he's not with Sherlock.  It's a purpose, a life, something (someone) to live for.  It's vital, in every sense of the word.  John's not a particularly religious man, but at its best, writing feels transcendent.  It makes him part of something bigger, timeless, as though he can identify with God when He made something from nothing and called it good.  Most of the time, the vast majority in fact, writing is slow and frustrating and discouraging, just throwing words at a goal he falls far short of, but when it's really good, there's nothing like it.  He may not be able to write like his favourite authors, the ones who can turn a sentence into a symphony, but he can write like himself, and that's enough to be going on with.
"I have an entire disguise closet, John, do keep up."
In his head, John is there with him, giving advice, stopping him when he's tempted to say too much. He knows it's not real, and that's how he knows he's still sane.
John loves Sherlock. More to the point, John's
Sherlock comes in.
John makes tea every morning, dependable as the foundations of London.  Most mornings, Sherlock lies folded up in his chair and observes whilst John snipes companionably at him.  John’s movements have a certain economy of motion that Sherlock finds aesthetically pleasing.  He knows John would never call himself graceful, but then, John’s never seen himself make tea with practiced competence, or go running through back alleys after a sex offender, or fire a perfect shot with a handgun at twenty metres.
"Sherlock.  When I said, 'Get some sleep', I didn't mean with me."
What’s more, he wants to.
"What?" Sherlock said. "Your hands are cold."
Sherlock drops his head into John’s hands, and releases the breath he’s been holding for so long.
John’s mouth is on his.  It is chaste and slow and very, very gentle, as if Sherlock is something precious that John wants to keep.  It is almost beyond belief, and yet.
John smiled, and stepped in closer to rest his forehead against Sherlock's. "Should I say it?"
"We're here," Sherlock announces a few minutes later, and holds the door open for John. John cocks his head at him, curious, and goes inside. Sherlock, as ever, follows him.
John grinned. "That's adorable."
Sherlock groans at the pun, and then groans for a completely different reason when John ducks his head and does something very cunning to the edge of Sherlock’s collarbone.
"There's no need to make that face, love," John says, still cradling the puppy. "No one could ever replace you, you know."
, transcendent, singular.  He had no idea a chemical defect could do this to a person; it’s really very—
John just smiles, and gets the tea bags out.
And then—Sherlock is flying, he is falling, he is weightless, he is soaring on the wings of a euphoric high better than anything he has ever felt.  His future with John stretches out like a map unrolled, like the wide universe.  He can feel his eyes start to burn and his mouth pull into a grin without his permission, and John is grinning back at him, and it is
"Sherlock," John whispers, and his eyes are suspiciously shiny. Sherlock can't stop looking at him, even though he can feel himself blushing. "I intend to, yeah?" John says gently, and reaches out to take his hand. "I plan to stick around for a very long while yet. I wouldn't want to leave my — dog — to be taken care of by anyone else. But I'm afraid you'll have to stick around too. To help with the dog, of course."
It’s alchemical, the way he feels about John: initial regard transformed into something much more.  Avicenna and the others thought they were changing dross into gold, but Sherlock doesn’t need misguided metaphysics to tell him that John is something precious, or that he’d purify a thousand compounds just to replicate the pyrite shine of his hair.
The sensation is much like stumbling over a missing stair.
Kepler’s third law, the law of harmonies, compares the orbital periods and radii of different planets.
"I wish I'd realised it sooner." John admits it with his arms crossed, still wearing his favourite cabled jumper even though it's not remotely cold in the house. "Maybe I should have, but I was so angry for so long, and I never thought you would quite feel that way about anyone, least of all me."
Sherlock looks at the pictures of John last. In the first, John is wearing his horrendous oatmeal jumper and his most military bearing. But Sherlock can see the slight shift in his stance to favour his right leg: psychosomatic limp acting up again. He can see the tightness in John’s eyes and mouth, tell-tale signs of stress. John usually thrives under stress, but clearly this is a new kind, one Sherlock didn’t have the chance to observe.
He’s up and off the bed before John can even properly turn his head, but Sherlock hears John call his name as he all but trips down the stairs.
He does not admit to himself that any further amount of time, no matter how small, is unacceptable.
“For as long as you like,” Sherlock says, and tries not to look happier than John will allow.
Sherlock considers.  Comforting physical contact is generally thought of as a beneficial response to a friend in distress.  Therefore, he joins John in the kitchen, approaching slowly so as not to spook him, and hugs him awkwardly around the shoulders, patting his back a few times for good measure.  John stills, surprised, but extricates his arms after a few seconds and brings them up loosely around Sherlock's waist, and then they're hugging properly.
It's just another potentiality that will never occur, now. He'll never find out what John looks like in reading glasses, or whether he'll still be a crack shot at sixty-five.
Sherlock stares back at John, at the blue drowned look in his eyes, and knows he’s done for; they both are. “John, given the circumstances, I think you should know—it seems that I—” He's choking; why is he choking? His voice worked just fine a moment ago.
Sherlock clears his throat.  “Yes,” he croaks, “let’s go home.”
Neither of them sleep much. All of the things left undone and words left unsaid ache like a palpated bruise, even after their hurried goodbyes in London. Lestrade and Molly had stayed at their posts, and Mrs Hudson had gone to her sister’s in Brighton. Harry was, as John bitterly put it, “dead to the world anyway” and in Manchester. Mary and the baby were gone, underground somewhere, and John claimed to be fine but clearly sometimes still missed her and the life he was never going to have.
Sherlock stills, and listens, and starts walking, following John’s voice into the black until he can figure out what to do. He will not let John down again; he will save him this time. He will.
His mind is going to get him killed someday, or worse, get John killed.
John stands up from his chair to loom over him, their usual positions reversed, and Sherlock has nowhere to look except at John, who fills Sherlock's vision like he fills his existence.
Sherlock’s mouth is dry. He
Sherlock smiles. "The offer still stands."
John nods, as though he expected nothing else from the world but a catastrophe.
John covers Sherlock’s right hand—
"Is this all right?"
He was doing chemistry when he met John, and the two have been paired in his mind ever since.  He’d been testing for the presence of a particular blood antigen, indicative of a very rare genotype, when John limped through the door.  For once, what was off the microscope slide was more intriguing than what was on it.  He took John in at a glance, and in retrospect, was taken in turn.
He does wonder, though, if John still has the uniform.
Sherlock pulled up short, blinked rapidly at him, and looked him over, eyes darkening in a way that made John's breathing pick up in anticipation. His eyes slid down from the stubble on John's jaw to stare directly at John's sternum, at the gap in his shirt where John had left the top two buttons unbuttoned, but what he said was "You don't own a fedora."
"Okay," Sherlock breathes, astonished, and then he's on his feet and they're kissing.  John’s mouth is a revelation, and Sherlock wants to write the equations of motion for the way it moves against his, warm and thorough and perfect.  John lavishes each of his lips with attention in turn, as if he’s had ages to make plans for what he would do to Sherlock’s mouth and is finally fulfilling them.  Sherlock cups John’s jaw in his hands, keeping him where he wants him, and his fingertips explore the soft hidden skin behind John’s ears.  John shivers and clutches at Sherlock’s hair, and Sherlock breaks the kiss to gasp and tilt his head back into the sensation.  He can hear John make a feral sound at this, and his hands knead through Sherlock’s curls while his mouth goes straight to Sherlock’s exposed throat, mapping out every centimetre of it.  When John bites gently at his Adam’s apple, Sherlock moans John’s name, his voice in its lowest register.  John shudders against him, breaths flaring out quick and shallow against the hollow of Sherlock’s throat.
But injustice is only one of the many things wrong with the universe, and when John wanders in to find him crumpled on the floor, surrounded by pages and pages of unsolvable equations, he doesn’t even say anything, just sits down heavily next to Sherlock and puts an arm around his shoulders and lets him breathe into John’s jumper.
Death has never particularly frightened him, his own included, but he finds he cannot countenance the idea that John Watson will cease to be. Sherlock knows, logically, that he will be likewise dead and unconscious of any change, but it seems fundamentally wrong that the universe should ever forget John, one of its best creations. Surely, there will be some echo left. Energy is always conserved in a closed system, so perhaps the waveforms that make up John’s consciousness will quiver and quaver but not entirely go quiet. Perhaps what’s left of Sherlock, if anything, will merge with what’s left of John.
"You claim to hate Bond films, but last week I heard you playing the theme from
John's birthday is coming up. Sherlock thinks he'll get him a dog. He's seen John gaze longingly at people's pet dogs whenever they go into town, and he's ascertained by careful questioning that John had an English bulldog as a boy that he doted on, but he'd had to give it up when his family moved houses. Sherlock has no doubt that even a small John would have been stoic and dry-eyed about it, but he would have missed his dog terribly. Sherlock wants to make it up to him. Wants to make everything up to him, in fact, but since that's sadly impossible, perhaps a dog will do. He's found a breeder not far from here, so now he just has to provide a diversion for John. He and Harry haven't gone to lunch in some time, so that should work.
It's mostly waiting at first—long days and nights of surveillance and planning that only occasionally culminate in the field work he hates. It's a wonder the entirety of MI6 didn't expire of boredom decades ago. Sherlock doesn't even need to be present for most of it. But the agents insist and he has nowhere better to be at the moment, so he tunes out their incessant droning and lets his mind go where he can't: home.
He can't remember exactly when it started, which is frankly appalling. His memory is all but eidetic, but for a very long time, he didn't even realise it was happening. He remembers meeting John, of course, but even after that, when their lives clicked together like the tumblers of a lock, he had no inkling of what was coming. He just wanted
At the pool, he'd wanted—needed—to confirm with his hands that John wasn't hurt. He needed the proof of as many senses as possible that John was fine, needed to map and survey the terrain of him with his palms.  Instead, he’d ripped the Semtex off John’s back and prepared himself to die, the first time.
John gives him a ghost of his old smile.  “Yeah, all right.”
"That costume suits you. Lucky that you wore something so battle-ready."
Sherlock nodded, and John led them down the stairs and onto the street, accompanied by the pleasing knowledge that Sherlock was definitely staring at his arse.
This second disappointment should be easier to weather, given the amount of practice he has already accumulated. But instead of coming in overwhelming waves like the first, it aches constantly, like his bones did when he was fourteen and adding height faster than his body could handle.
John kissed him for a few lovely moments longer, before pulling reluctantly back from Sherlock before they both got carried away. Sherlock blinked his way back to the here and now, which never failed to be immensely flattering.
whereupon Sherlock had pointed out that it hadn’t been locked, making sure to slam said door on his way out.
"Anyway, Dracula? Really?" John had expected something more esoteric. And less distracting. "Where did you even get that?"
"Lovely! If you'll just follow me, then." Sherlock puts a hand on the small of John's back to lead him along into the kennel room. He makes sure to stay slightly in front of John, so that he can see his face when John realises where this is going. When he sees the puppies, John goes very still under Sherlock's palm.
Sherlock hates to lose data: it leaves holes in the universe, little darknesses that eat away at the edifice of knowledge and increase the entropy of existence. Sherlock hates that when they die, the vast reams of information that make up who they are will be erased: the acicular acuity of his thoughts will be blunted and shattered, and so will the precise angles of the furrows in John’s brow when Sherlock exasperates him, the refractory index of his irises, and the proud line of his spine when he holds a gun.
."  He flops down on the sofa next to Sherlock and pulls some of the blankets off of him.  He's sitting close enough to provide some warmth, but they're not actually touching.  Yet.  "Are you sitting on the telly remote?"
He takes John to bed and loves him very, very slowly, as if the space between their bodies is all the world they need.
John perked up and looked, and sure enough, they were clearly siblings, with the same long nose and chestnut-coloured hair. They were familiar and at ease with each other; there was no sign of wariness or animosity. Though really, John reflected, there should have been; Kellerman was almost certainly a murderer, and probably more than once. He had stopped short of being a serial killer, for which John was thankful, but Sherlock mostly seemed to regard it as a failure of personal ambition. While John was musing, Kellerman suddenly broke away from his sister and headed for the back door.
“It’ll be quick, I promise,” John soothes. “It doesn’t need to be protracted like with the others. I know that you
He looks up at Sherlock, his whole face open in the way it only ever is around him, and Sherlock feels something stutter in his chest, his treacherous heart beating
.  John is essential, and so Sherlock takes a shuddering breath, puts his back against a sturdy, dirty brick wall, and goes to his mind palace.
John sighed. "Right. And what are we looking for, exactly?"
"Anyway," John continues, looking him in the eye, "it's nice that you tried to help, so — thanks."  He nods once, definitively, and leaves the room.
The lower bout of his violin echoes the sweet Darwinian curve of John's skull, and the waist of his violin mirrors the arc of John's throat. They're recurring tessellations in the cosmos, patterns that ripple out into nothingness.
Two weeks in Argentina and he still hasn’t got used to the heat. When he ventures outside, it’s under a broad-brimmed hat that hides his sharp eyes and sharper cheekbones from the villagers. He buys coffee and mangoes because he can’t remember when he ate last and that’s a bit not good.
Sherlock observes John, who is in their unfamiliar kitchen, small and steady and
It's a level of closeness he never thought he'd achieve with anyone, but with John it feels as natural as — but much less boring than — breathing.
John's hands are a paradox. They're so gentle and seeking when Sherlock is hurt, but so clenched and furious when he does the hurting. They're the hands that shot a man for him, the fingertips that bruised his wrist searching for a pulse, the knuckles that bloodied his unapologetic mouth.
It’s quite warm here, Sherlock realises, choking down the unreasoning fear in his throat. He won’t be cold anymore, not here. Maybe it’s John’s presence warming him; maybe it’s something else.
Alexandria is full of the acrid grief of lost knowledge, of the ghosts of thousands of books that keep company with the human remains underground, in the tortuous treasure trove of the Necropolis.
"It's all right," he said into John's solar plexus. "I'll manage." And he would; it wasn't the bees themselves that had left him so shaken, though losing another hive was of course vexing. It was the sense that death seemed to be everywhere he looked these days, seeping up from the ground like fog, and it was making him afraid. It was not something he cared to think of, and yet he did. Death was a wolf at the door, slavering for more flesh, and he did not want to give it.
John’s voice could fell armies, and probably has.
The room was decorated with the trappings of the holiday, fake spider webs taped up in the corners and rubber bats hanging from the ceiling. There were plastic eyeballs floating in the punch bowl. In these surroundings, Sherlock looked, more than ever, like a swan among pigeons.
. In retrospect, Sherlock's defensive tactics against Mary's ex seem more sensible than ever, if a bit too late.
“You know how he feels about legwork,” she chides him, and shoots the next guard who comes through the door.
For the first time in years, Sherlock has (nearly) everything he wants.
“A long-term study, then?  For science?”
John curls up in his chair like a cat when he reads.  The firelight washes him in soft reds and golds and soaks into his jumper and hair.  He looks so warm—he
"Night," John says, and falls back asleep with the combined ease of a soldier and a doctor.
.  The blasted hope won’t go away, small but stubborn, like John.  He can feel it buried deep in his mind palace and struggling to get out.  He can’t bring himself to kill it entirely.  It’s all one with pirates and starlight and the possibility of the open sea.
It was home, this: a fire whispering to itself in the grate, his familiar chair, a hot cuppa, and his socked feet gently bumping against Sherlock's every time one of them shifted. 221b was a cosy den of books and tea and case files, and he and Sherlock reigned there like kings over a royal treasury of mysterious killers and dangerous chases through London's secret places. The days were getting shorter and colder, shrinking into themselves for winter, and he felt the urge to hibernate, to just get a heavy blanket and Sherlock and not leave the flat for several days. He was also hungry, but he'd already been to Tesco earlier to get the ingredients for dinner, and he had a packet of chocolate Hobnobs next to his chair, so that was sorted for now.
Afterwards, John stays away from the flat. He doesn’t answer texts or even phone calls, once Sherlock resorts to the latter. Sherlock considers following him, but opts to wait, since Sherlock is not worried. Obviously. There will be some rational—or perhaps irrational—explanation for why John is gone. He is certainly not hurt, or in danger, or—well. He’s not. So, in his absence, Sherlock performs every messy and malodourous experiment he can think of, purposely leaves human remains in the refrigerator drawer, and goes through a pack and a half of cigarettes out of spite, because if John is going to desert him then Sherlock is damn well going to smoke.
“Right then, come on, Sherlock. Follow the sound of my voice.” John giggles, then, high and thin and reedy.
It's good, the way they are with each other; it's always been good. It still surprises him, but some days it's almost worth being old for this sort of thing, for the unconscious intimacy that comes from spending decades with someone. He and John move around each other like satellites, and they hardly have to speak to know what the other is thinking.
"Well then," Sherlock says, "go and meet your present." Ian has the puppy in his broad palms, and he transfers the wrinkly little thing over to John and leaves them to get acquainted. John cradles it against his chest with an utterly besotted look on his face, and the puppy burrows blissfully into John's shirtfront. Sherlock feels an irritable spike of jealousy. Almost immediately, John chuckles at him, even though Sherlock hadn't thought he was looking.
—with his left and lifts them both to Sherlock’s chest, just over his heart. Sherlock takes a shuddering breath and makes a diagonal incision through his pectoral muscle. He peels back the flesh so that John can see inside, through the ribs, to Sherlock’s heart, which is still beating, off-rhythm and out of time. It hurts, but the look on John’s face, intent and greedy and fascinated, blots out the pain.
While he is mapping out the remnants of Moriarty’s network, he talks to John. It helps him think. Connections and hierarchies fall into place until he can see which node has to be neutralised next. He turns, to bask in John’s praise, and is brought up short by reality.
"No. I went to Oxfam."
"She'll be out for hours yet. You have no idea, John."
"I — not exactly," Sherlock hedges, "but I still think you should check."
Sherlock will take whatever John is willing to give him.  Thus, logic dictates that, since this is yet another chance Sherlock never expected to receive, he would be a fool not to take it.
“The others, they hurt you,” he gasps out, “but I didn’t save you. I wasn’t clever enough. You trusted me, and I didn’t save you.”
The next morning he’d shown John the approximate EEG he’d drawn up of his brain activity and explained that, while it was lamentably imprecise and needed to be done properly in a controlled environment, the alpha wave amplitude indicated that John would have fewer nightmares if he ran more often and gave up his late-night curries. John had blinked, said nothing, and made him tea. He’d left his bedroom door open that night and every night after.
The media, of course, has seized breathlessly upon his ‘suicide’. He reads the coverage from a library computer in Vienna. There are endless speculative, tell-all articles, most sensational, all of them wrong. Lestrade is still fighting to keep his job at the Yard. John is still being pursued by the paparazzi, looking small and tired and painfully diminished, in a way that Sherlock can’t quite define—not until hours later, when he looks in the mirror at his own expression, and thinks,
"Yes, fine."
"Yeah, I do," John replies when Sherlock can't produce anything else. "I am."
He’s home now.
John’s not here.
"No!  No.  Um, no thank you?"  John flushes bright red.  Sherlock decides to put him out of his misery by sparing him further talking.  He unceremoniously grabs John's free hand and places it in his hair.  "Just this."
"Well, where else am I supposed to sleep?"
He wants to use words the way Sherlock uses data.  Writing has never seemed quite as important as it does now; the urge to get it right has never been this strong.  He wants to feel the caught-killer thrill of a beautiful sentence and the scalpel-sharp satisfaction of an apt description.  He wants to know that he's captured Sherlock as well as English ever can, that he's made him come alive for others, made him just that little bit less mortal.
"Always."
"I need to see if Kellerman invited his sister. If he did, he's guilty. He claimed they were estranged, but he may have used her business to launder money."
They wander around the town centre for a bit, popping in and out of antique shops and bookstores, until it's time for lunch. They've found a small Italian place they like, and while it's not Angelo's, it does an excellent pesto tagliatelle, and its tiramisu is divine. He lets John order for them, though Sherlock adds on a bottle of wine for the occasion and requests a candle. It's their tradition, and it always makes John smile to see it.
After Sherlock gathers what evidence he needs, he goes to collect John.  He’s crouched in the back garden, examining the blood left behind by the victim, but he turns when Sherlock walks outside.  He offers a hand to pull John up to him, and Sherlock thinks about chirality as their palms clasp together, the handedness of molecules meant to interlock.
"Does that make you a lion tamer, then?"
Sherlock looked disgruntled. "They made me lisp."
“Why didn’t you—oh, hell.” John laughs, once, and scrubs his hand over his face.  “Sherlock, you idiot.  I love you too.”
He wonders what would happen if he pushed John flat onto the kitchen table.  If he stocked it with all of his non-toxic but staining compounds first, and made sure to tip over every one with the force of their bodies, the multi-coloured marks would last for days, drenching their skin and streaking them with the evidence of what they’d done.  Their hands, slender and sturdy respectively, would be soaked in variegated hues that everyone would see, flowing up from their fingertips which had absorbed the liquids from each other’s skin like wicks, like plant stems from the earth.  They’d be caught, perhaps literally, red-handed.
He succumbs to the tactile impulse again in the kitchen the next morning, however.  John is at the counter, putting the kettle on, and he's still slow and groggy with sleep.  His brassy hair is sticking up in a cowlick behind his right ear.  Sherlock wonders what it feels like to touch, so he puts one hand on John's shoulder to hold him still and reaches his other hand out to sink his fingertips into John's hair.  John freezes for a few seconds while Sherlock catalogues the haptic feedback.  John's hair is warm with the heat of his scalp and springs back slightly to the touch.  It's softer than it looks.  He briefly lets his palm cup the curve of John's skull.  It's smaller, but nicer to touch than Sherlock's friend the skull.  He feels John's shoulder twitch under his fingers, as if he's not sure whether to shake Sherlock off or not.
He could say it now, but he knows that John will never hear it.
Sherlock sniffed indignantly. "One of the costumers at Pinewood owes me a favour."
“It’s over now, Sherlock. Do please refrain from doing anything rash. John would not have wanted that.”
. Oh.
John flexes his shoulders experimentally and lets out a small pained grunt.  “It still aches quite a bit, but the paracetamol should kick in soon.  I’ll be sore for a while, but I’ll manage.  It could’ve been much worse.”
"That won't be much longer."
"Mmm, perhaps," he said, his fingertips seeking out the sensitive places behind John's ears. "But not too tame, I hope."
, and that sensation was familiar enough, even if it wasn't usually provoked by a person. But it gradually sublimated into something much odder and deeper and stronger, something for which he had no prior frame of reference. So he can hardly be blamed, really, if he didn't recognise it for what it was until it was far, far too late.
“Want it for a collection?” John smirks, holding up his tweezers that embrace a bloody piece of glass. For a moment Sherlock considers the idea. But he doesn’t collect memories.
“Changing perspectives”, was Sherlock’s explanation.
“So, you gonna tell me what happened?”, asks John while cleaning the wound on Sherlock’s knee.
“You think it’s a good idea?”, John asks, the new sensation still lingering inside him. He isn’t so sure to visit Creepy Cottage anymore.
“I don’t go and get you new petri dishes, I told you that before.”
John points at the huge box inside their living room. “What is that?”
Sherlock chuckles.
When the first finger nail scratches my ankle I start running, fleeing.
“I’m sorry John. I really am. I destroyed your bike.” Sherlock does feel so guilty.
Redbeard, Irish Setter, the scrawly description says.
?“ Sherlock scrunches up his nose. Puts his book down.
Sherlock stays silent.
John decides to put the cooking pot in the trash. It’s beyond remedy.
“Why would I?”
Sherlock bleeds on the sofa instead, has placed his foot on it.
And John. Hundreds of images of John whirr in his mind’s eye. Tangling photographs in the storm of his fire.
“Come out”, coos Jimmy. “We know that you’re in here.”
Sherlock glances at the radio clock on the nightstand. “4.37.”
And John turns around. Desperate. Devastated.
And then, finally, John touches Sherlock’s skin around the ankle.
When he leaves the zoo and enters Regent’s Park John finds Sherlock sitting on a bench, drawing circles with the tip of his shoe in the gravel beneath.
“I told you so.” Sherlock’s voice is nearly back to normal.
The crinkling newspaper again.
‘Mhhhhh.’ Sherlock stretches. Leaves the twilight of his sheets. Squints at John standing in the morning light. Button down shirt. Rolled up sleeves. Jeans. Socks.
“I went to Regent’s Park the morning you caught the first one.”
Sherlock doesn’t feel ready to leave his nest.
‘I’ll get you some socks. Doctor’s order’, John says. He smirks. Sternly.
“Yeff, buffing teef.”
Mrs Holmes sighs. “What is it, dear?”
John smirks.
Sharp stones cut into his soft soles. Red triangles. Flashing. He wouldn’t mind shoes now too much. Can’t wait to be inside. Rough wooden flooring under his feet. Stringy carpets. His feet remember how every step in his childhood home feels. He only walks on the panels. If he touches the cracks he loses.
“You are not allowed to be behind the fence.”
“Then don’t ask.”
His bedroom door opens.
He has to investigate this.
As Regent’s Park is closer to Baker Street, Sherlock decides to go there first. He takes a circuit though. Sways the basket a bit. The pharmacy glasses clink. It’s hard not to leap for joy. The day feels so good!
He has fallen in love with John Watson.
The white gauze has turned red and wet. Sherlock is pleased.
He thinks about the bee in their kitchen, he thinks about John. How happy John can make him.
”Well, whatever’s going on, we need you at a crime scene.”
: John’s eyes aren’t just blue, they are a bit greyish too.
Sherlock freezes. It’s the boys from his chemistry class, Adam’s clique.
Sherlock shrugs.
Redbeard. His dog. His best friend.
“I’m a doctor. I should take as much care of myself as of my patients.“
The inside is a mess. Hasn’t been tidied up for three weeks.
“Household filth. I told you so. Have to inspect the other rooms as well. And other flats, obviously. Do you think Mrs Hudson and Lestrade are fine with that? I think I start with households from people I already know.”
I open my mouth and let it rain inside me.
He wriggles around. Tries to find a more comfortable position. So there aren’t red rings of pain in his stomach. So the sick feeling in his throat doesn’t choke him.
How many scars does John have?
“Tell Sherlock to call me. This case isn’t solved yet”, Greg says.
And then the truth hits him and he realises something.
“Sounds like the beginning of a big collection.” John sighs.
But Sherlock can’t help it, feels awkward. Miserable. Wants John to leave him alone, wants John to stay. He is confused, once again. Doesn’t know what to feel or do or say.
He comes down with something, perhaps.
John grabs his doctor’s kit and wants to leave.
“Good morning”, John says.
He has wrecked John’s bicycle.
‘All out?’, he asks.
Sherlock needs the whole day to catalogue the insects. He wants to make sure to be finished before John comes home from work. Sherlock is pretty sure that his flatmate won’t be too keen on sharing the flat with nearly thirty bees.
“At least he is right. There are two tiny bloody spots between the fingers. I guess we have to wait for a toxicity analysis to know more.”
John wants to fuck him so badly. Wants to desecrate his innocent Sherlock, thrust inside his hole, rip that arse open. He wants to hear Sherlock scream and moan, every little noise made of pain and lust.
His stomach calms down while his throat is burning.
Bumble.
John is thoroughly fit, his upper body and legs muscular and wiry. His skin is still damp from the shower, drops fall from his hair down his chest. The towel sits low on his hips, his loins are showing.
Sherlock pulls his legs to his chest, hugs himself. Hides his face.
Hallucinations dreams intruders, hallucinations dreams intruders, hallucinations dreams intruders -
Yes, Sherlock knows. Has experienced it already.
John had noticed that there had been a change in their relationship as flatmates. Sherlock had started to behave strange, even weirder than usual. He stared into the air, and it was clear he wasn’t in his mind palace but rather day dreaming.
Sherlock blinks a few times. He is back on the bathroom floor at Baker Street. His bum is cold, his face wet with tears. Fear dances in cruel moves through his veins until it reaches his heart.
“Does your bee have a name?”, John asks.
“Yeah, I should. Probably. Good morning.” Sherlock turns around, leaves the policeman behind.The basket hums like a hive.
“It’s Saturday, I don’t have to go anywhere today. I can read for as long as I want.”
“Yeah, I’m fine.” But Sherlock’s voice is hoarse and he clenches his jaw. “Let’s go home.” He gets up, doesn’t wait for John to follow.
“It’s gonna sting”, John warns. The sharp smell of iodine and antiseptic spray surrounds them. Sherlock feels like choking. From the scent. The pain. The guilt.
He gasps, opens his eyes widely, can’t see anything but John. There is a bulge in John’s trousers, even bigger than the one under Sherlock’s robe now. And Sherlock wants nothing more than to touch it, to touch
happen.
Nothing remains but a hollow place and a red glowing stone.
Sherlock stops walking. The zoo lays behind him. But going back isn’t an option. And going home isn’t too. So he just sinks down on a bench in Regent’s Park. In between.
He takes some white and black shirts to the changing room. One size smaller than usual.
“Boys, haven’t you heard the doorbell?” It’s Mrs Hudson who has opened the door to their living room, a package deliverer right behind her.
Sherlock still doesn’t move, doesn’t mind the big box with his laboratory supplies. With his inner eyes he still sees John.
