“It’s a ring,” Dean answered, he came over to stand in front of Cas and unclasped it. “You put it around the base of your dick and it delays your orgasm until you take it off.”
Castiel pulled Dean down and kissed him softly, shaking his hand entwined with Dean’s free so he could snake it down to the button of Dean’s jeans.
“You fucking piece of garbage,” she said, wiping the blood from her mouth before reaching down to wrap her hands around Castiel’s throat. Castiel reached out, moving his hand around to try and find anything that could help him. “You have any last words?” Amara smiled at him, toothy and insane. Castiel frantically tried to buck her off of him and search for anything on the ground he could use to gain leverage but found nothing. “No? Well, say goodbye, then,” Amara said. Castiel flung his arm out, gasping as it came in contact with something cold and metallic. “I’m going to kill you.”
Dean cut the girl off with an incredulous and harsh laugh. “You’ll what?” He asked, “You’ll kill me? You’ll tell everyone about Cas and I?” Dean laughed again before seeing red and looking her straight in the eyes. “You won’t be telling anyone about Cas and I.”
Dean was quiet for a while, and Castiel was too, taking in and processing everything that had just happened. Castiel knew it wasn’t like himself to unload just like that, and it would be easy to just brush it off as he’d been keeping all this in a bubble for as long as he could remember and it finally burst, but Castiel was beginning to think maybe it was something more. Maybe it was something between him and Dean, or maybe just about Dean specifically.
Gabe was thoroughly invested in the conversation and was asking questions about life as a pirate. And the others talked with animated faces and wild arm movements, almost slapping each other in the face sometimes.
Castiel held his head in his hands, just trying to tune his friends out as they continued shouting. Over and over, for however long—Castiel wasn’t certain, all he knew was that it lasted for hours in his head. He couldn’t really process what was being said, just the gist of each of their tirades. Rachel just kept saying they didn’t know Dean, they didn’t know him, didn’t know him, therefore didn’t know his intentions or his wants and expectations of repayment. And Gadreel kept repeating the phrase ‘true mates’ and how 'true mates' weren’t capable of hurting each other.
“H-huh… H-how?” Cas asked, feeling the heat in his abdomen, not building or falling; just burning. Dean kept him there with every movement of his hips.
“Dean?” he asked, sleep still evident in his voice. He tried to stretch himself out, aiming to pull whatever was over his eyes off, but he found that he couldn’t move. “What?” He tried to remember what happened last night. All he came up with was him and Dean falling asleep, face-to-face while laughing and whispering jokes to each other. “Dean?” Cas pulled at the restraints around his arms again. He tried to move his legs and found that they were also tied up — just like how Dean had tied him up when he wore those panties and Dean put the cockring on him.
“Shit,” Dean almost cried. Cas was bobbing his head and swirling his tongue around the head of Dean’s manhood furiously while twisting and pumping his hands along his shaft. “Fu-u-uck!” Cas felt himself smile around Dean’s girth. He bobbed his head for a few more minutes before pulling off and looking at Dean.
“You’re sure they’ll be here?” Dean asked, and Castiel tore his eyes away from the spot where his father’s bedroom should be. Instead, it was just a crumbled corner of the mansion. Anything in there was gone, and Castiel found he really didn’t care.
“I’m Charlie,” She said. “Nice to meet you.” Cas was thankful for the interaction and smiled back at her.
“I don’t know,” he said, “We can only see seven other ships, but there’s no telling just how many more there will be once we break horizon.”
“Hush, Dean,” Cas said softly. “Let me do this for you.” He slipped his hands down to undo the first button of Dean’s shirt, kissing the newly exposed skin. Slowly and methodically, Cas went about undoing the rest, placing kisses as he went.
“You have an omega mate?” Castiel asked, completely in awe of the very idea that anyone could even have such a choice.
Castiel mewled and his body gave one last jerk before he went still, mewling and moaning for several long minutes until he was silent. Dean kept Castiel held against him through it all until he was able to calm down and come back to himself completely. And when he did, Dean registered the soft sounds of snoring.
Castiel’s eyes rolled up into his head at the thought of Dean moving. Of Dean pulling out all the way and pushing back into him, because he knew,
“So, so good,” Cas mewled. “You’re so big…” Cas trailed off, panting hard. Dean took pity on him and snapped his hips into Cas, angling them while he was at it to make the angel beneath him squirm.
Charlie made a small noise of discontent and then turned to Jess. “You know I said not to wait for his first heat to come before bringing him up,” she said, “I said it would be too much of a shock to him.”
“Touch me,” Cas gasped. “Touch me, please!” Dean obliged him, smoothing his hands over Cas’s sides and the tops of his thighs. Cas cried out, moaning wildly and uncontrollably. Like every nerve in Cas’s body was on fire and when Dean touched him, the fire was doused.
“Okay,” Dean said, gritting his teeth. Cas began to smile but was stopped as Dean drove his hips forward.
“What?” Rachel shifted her weight from one foot to the other. “You never…” Castiel shrugged and Rachel frowned. “I thought you moved to California,” she said, “That’s what Jo said, and dad never said anything about you after you left.”
Last month, Dean had been sent proof Lisa and Ben were all set up in Heaven at the best Inn—the one the high class people stayed at. Lisa had enough gold to last a year, if not more with how frugal she was. Dean was confident that he could get to Abbadon swiftly and neutralize her, but just in case, he wanted them to be okay unless it took longer than he thought it would. The small envelope containing a piece of his own stationary with Lisa’s handwriting saying,
“Knot me,” he said, gasping as he felt that heat pooling in his stomach again. “When you come, knot me.”
“Dean,” Benny started, his tone somewhat scolding. He sat down across the table from him in the mess. “It’s late, and I know you’re tired.”
Michael stepped out and walked briskly into their house, ignoring Cas. Something Cas was actually thankful for once. He made his way up to his room quickly undressed and redressed in his nightclothes, getting into his bed as soon as he was in his dark blue shorts he only wore every few months. Today had been the rare kind of day where it got warmer throughout and hadn't let up yet. So cas had dug the shorts from the bottom of his closet, pulling them on quickly and then getting into bed even quicker. When Dean was gone, he found it easier to go to sleep as soon as he was allowed to. It made the days go by faster.
Cas’s heart broke further. He took Dean’s face between his hands, “Listen to me, okay?” Dean’s eyes darted frantically between Cas’s before he nodded. “You’re not a monster.”
“Where is Rachel right now?” he asked. Gadreel walked with him across the room to the door, watching him carefully just in case he lost his footing or became too dizzy.
“Yes,” Cas said. He spread his legs farther apart to let Dean settle between them more comfortably. Dean immediately started sucking red blotches into his skin.
“I’ll grab our things. You take a moment to prepare,” he said, and then he was gone and Castiel was left alone to pick out an outfit. It took shorter than Castiel wanted—he went simple; a pair of jeans, dress shirt with a vest, and his trench coat—and then he was alone with his thoughts.
“I… I wasn’t looking, I’m sorry…” Castiel said softly, barely able to hear with the blood rushing through his ears. The man smiled at him, and Castiel had to fight to breathe right.
“Yeah, I know, sex is just the gift that just keeps on giving, isn’t it?” Dean said, half expecting Castiel to glare at him or slap him, but Castiel just threw his head back as he spread his knees to grind down and get Dean as deep as he possibly could.
“Okay,” Dean lead the way, never once letting Cas’s hand go. Something in which he was grateful for. It kept him focused and grounded.
Castiel watched him until he couldn’t see Dean anymore, and then he forced himself to tear his eyes away and make his way home, a small smile on his face the whole way there.
The sound of Rachel’s muffled scolding was the last thing Castiel heard before he exited the ballroom and made his way to the docking unit in the back of the arena. It’s where they’d parked their semi and were keeping Arkangel in his microgel tank to regenerate and recuperate. They’d been given the Victor’s Suite in the hotel above the arena, but Castiel preferred to sleep close to Arkangel. It made him feel safer. And it allowed him to let his guard down. He was safe with Arkangel, and he could let go of the constant vigilance he kept up to protect himself from the horrible memories of that night. And even though it was fucking awful to remember, he didn’t have a choice because sometimes, after matches, when the adrenaline wore off and he had nothing to focus on but himself, the past caught back up with him. And he broke. The memories of what those alpha’s did to him—what they made him do…all came crashing down on him.
Dean lifted his hand like he was going to touch Castiel, and that’s when Castiel noticed how close they’d gotten. He should have backed away, he should have wanted to get as far away from the alpha in front of him as possible…but he didn’t back away; and he didn’t want to. He wanted Dean to touch him, a little bit. No matter how terrifying that was, he couldn’t stop himself from wanting it.
Whatever Dean had been expecting, it wasn’t that. And he jumped into action, calling out Castiel’s name as he lunged forward to try and grab his boyfriend, but Castiel dodged him.
“You’re allowed to go straight to bed when we get home, Castiel,” Michael said, his voice loud and cutting as he broke the silence that had settled between the two Novaks as soon as they had gotten into their transportation.
Dean and Castiel wouldn’t—nor would the entirety of Winchester—send anyone back to an unsafe land, so Castiel and Dean had decided that if this kingdom didn’t align with Winchester and compromise in the reforming of their kingdom, they would have a declaration of war sent to them within the week.
“I’m still full from breakfast,” he said. She frowned at him and looked like she wanted to say more, but kept herself from saying it.
“Really?” Cas asked, his face melting and small smile replacing the scowl that he had been wearing. Dean smiled back and opened his mouth to respond but Cas shook his head and the look from before was back. “Th-that's not what I’m angry about,” he said. Dean didn’t have time to respond to what he was angry about before Cas dropped to his knees. He started to furiously undo Dean’s pants, almost as if he couldn’t work fast enough. “I don’t doubt your fidelity, Dean.”
“Oh.” The omega frowned and looked away quickly. “I-I’m not a virgin,” he said, and Dean knew that was a lie.
“It… It’s my fault.” Sam said, pulling out a set of clothes for Cas to change in to. Cas pulled the robe around him tighter and head tilted just slightly. Not enough so that his gaze left the wall above the bed, but enough so that Sam knew that he was listening. “Look, just let Dean explain, alright? A-and if you’re going to blame someone—if you need to blame anyone, blame me. Please don’t blame Dean.”
He was so fond of this boy. He didn’t know why. There were so many other people he was fond of and cared for, but it was different with Cas.
“Oh, Dean, please!” Cas begged his voice sounding like a sob. Dean pulled his fingers out and undid his pants, pushing them down enough to get to his own manhood.
“True mate,” Castiel whispered. Gabe let out a laugh and stepped up to Dean, poking him in the chest hard enough to make Dean take a step back.
“Then make love to me,” He gasped, clinging to Dean as he felt the man’s half-hard cock push into him again slowly. Cas whined Dean’s name, not entirely sure what he was wanting.
“I don’t like leaving you,” Dean whispered, hugging Cas tightly. “It tears me up inside. I hate it, Cas. I hate leaving you alone for such long periods of time.”
“I mean no disrespect to your family when I say this, but I really don’t want to know them. They don’t come across as worth knowing, especially if they’ve made you feel like trash your whole life,” Dean said, and it made Castiel blush even more. He couldn’t think of anything to say and Dean brought a hand up to rub at the back of his neck. He shuffled his feet and looked down at the ground as he laughed nervously. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. You don’t know me, and I don’t know you well enough to be telling you all that—I made you uncomfortable, I’m sorry, I—”
Dean choked on his spit and started coughing, suspiciously sounding more like laughing. “You want to know what a twink is?” He asked, his voice just a tad raspy.
Castiel felt his power start to thrum inside him, and all he could think about was all the times when he was younger and his siblings excluded him, left him in the dust, made him feel less than.
“Yeah,” Cas said, yelping as Dean flicked his tongue out against his rim. “Again,” he breathed out, spreading his knees farther apart.
The look in Cas's eyes had Dean fighting even harder for breath. And the emotion in Dean's made Cas want to melt.
Cas leaned into Dean’s arms and turned to press his lips against Dean’s for just a second. “Just keep holding me for now.”
?” Amara asked, sucking air in through her teeth in a hiss with a mocking grimace on her face. “That’s right. He’s your true mate and all that, isn’t he? He claimed you and everything. So you have to defend him, don’t you?”
“Absolutely not,” He said, and this time the shock was clear on Abbadon’s face. Dean called over his shoulder, “Benny!” And then smiled at Abbadon. “There are some people who deserve your blood more than me, and no matter how much I want it to be me who kills you, I want more to live through this day.”
He stared at the new and pristine looking spyglass carefully set in some more cloth. Looking up at Sam he said, “You got me a new spyglass?”
Castiel slicking more as he pumped his fingers before he felt it dripping down to his wrist, and he moaned as Castiel’s cock jumped several times in his mouth through his orgasm. “God, don’t stop!”
“I need you out of these offensive garments,” he said. Dean chuckled and leaned in to kiss him, but Castiel blocked him and did his best to growl at Dean. “No kisses until you are nude.”
Cas moved one of his hands off Dean’s shaft and slid it to push against the man’s abdomen, drawing out a whine from Dean’s lips.
“You’ve been fantasizing about me since you were thirteen? I was…” Dean did some quick mental math as he found a band and quickly put it around his wrist. “Fucking—I was
Pure rage boiled inside Castiel, and he looked at all his siblings. People who he’d called his family thought that Dean, born to an ordinary family and lived a normal life, could have been the thing that ended the world. Even though Castiel was just like them, even when he was special too, they didn’t—couldn’t, wouldn’t—believe that he was
“So, how has your day been?” Dean said, and it jarred Castiel just slightly because he’d been so focused on keeping his heart from not beating out of his chest.
’s cooed from his students. “Next is my family and friends, then teaching, then my car—a sixty-seven Chevy Impala. Don’t drive it much anymore with four kids, but it’s
“What would you like to drink?” Ellen asked, “We have water, barley tea, rosewater, lavender drink, and apple or lemon drink.” She paused. “I could get you ale, cider, mead, or wine, too, although I would not recommend those for you now.”
Castiel inhaled sharply at that because what had happened to Kevin had been horrific. Meg grabbed Castiel’s hand and asked, “Was it bad? What happened to him?”
“Hello,” the omega—Castiel, said and waved. He smiled at the few who waved back. “I’m just here to get the kids and we’ll be out of all your hair.”
“What are you doing here?” he asked, “We already had this conversation. You shouldn’t be down here.”
“May we sit and chat with you?” She asked. Castiel stopped chewing and pondered that for a moment. He reached for the tray of meats and cheeses and pulled it closer to him as he settled back against the headboard.
But one fateful day, Benny was able to seduce one of the female guards and get her keys. They got out, finally. They were free.
Charlie looked in his eyes and nodded. “It would,” She said. Dean smiled and shook his head, wincing when he felt the stitches pull at his skin. “Don’t move your head, idiot.”
was going to happen. He didn’t know what exactly would be going down, but something was set into motion the moment Castiel picked that ball of fur up and brought her into their apartment.
After a while, Dean spoke up again, “Wait, I have another question. How did Zach know about the apocalypse? I heard the others talking about how he wrote in his journals that the apocalypse was going to happen. They thought I was going to cause it.”
Another tap to his forehead made him roll away from Alfie because he felt that after having to deal with the King—
“Look, from how I see it, my brother could do complex math problems by seventh grade while I struggled with algebra in tenth grade, but I can figure out how to fix my car when it breaks down and save hundreds of dollars while he was never able to grasp the work in order to spare the call to a mechanic. He has to spend the hundreds of dollars I get to save when his car breaks down. And he has to have his girlfriend drop him off and pick him up from work until his car is out of the shop.” Dean chuckled. “We all have different areas where we excel because we’re all different. You may not be able to do the things they can do, but there are things that you can do that they can’t. So, you
“Hm,” Cas hummed, pulling Dean in for a quick kiss. “Must be very important, seeing as you’re here, on the bed. With me.”
Cas looked up from his plate to see Lucifer. He rolled his eyes and glanced around the mess, noting where everyone was. Dean was with Benny, Lisa, and Sam in the drawing room going over a few last details before the feast, so they were nowhere to be seen. Charlie and Gilda were sitting together, Charlie in Gilda’s lap, while Jo was next to them both, smiling and laughing. If Cas didn’t know better, he would definitely say that the three of them were...flirting? It was quite a sight.
“C’mere,” Dean said, turning Cas around as he backed up to his desk chair. He sat down and sucked Cas’s length into his mouth, bobbing his head a few times, before holding the ring out and looking up at Cas. “You sure you want to?” He asked, smiling comfortingly.
“I, um, I like kissing?” Castiel said as Dean gently pushed him back to lie down. “A-and I’ve liked when I play with my, uh, my nipples.”
“Yeah, that was even worse,” Castiel said, shuddering at the memory of the eulogy their dad gave at Kevin’s funeral.
“Well, after you didn’t come home…” Castiel shrugged. “Things were hard for a long time. And then dad acted like everything was fine. He held a small memorial for you, even though none of us ever really thought you were dead, and then he put the others back into training. And then Kevin was hurt on a mission and we lost him. We were all sixteen at the time. That’s when things really started getting bad.
He gasped as he saw Dean’s manhood just beginning to rise; still mostly soft, but despite that, the size was still impressive. Just looking at it made his omega yearn for it and slick begin feeling like it was pouring out of him.
“Sure,” Dean said, standing up and walking slowly over to sit next to her. He gingerly laid down Ben next to him and smiled when Ben stretched out before scooting until his back was against Dean’s leg. “What is it?”
“What colorful language,” Dean said, feigning shock. He let go of Cas’s length and moved his hand to circle his rim. “I have no idea where you could have possibly picked that up.” Cas laughed breathily as Dean slid his fingers into him. “Who fucking knows. I’m a little too preoccupied by other things to care, squarely,” Dean finished, smiling widely and pulling his fingers out before grabbing the bottle of oil and coating his shaft in it. He lined the head of his cock up with Cas’s hole before moving his hands to Cas’s hips.
“Be there in a sec’!” Dean grunted and waved his brother off, nipping as Cas’s neck some more. Cas found himself moaning seconds later as Dean’s hand came to palm at the front of his trousers.
Cas inhaled sharply and moaned. “Yes.” His knuckles dug into the sheet beneath him, turning white from his death grip. He bent his legs up farther. “Please.” Dean moved so Cas could rest his legs over his thighs and stroked himself faster, looking at Cas’s blissed out face.
“Sweeting,” the brunette said, taking a step forward and grabbing a small loaf of bread, “My name is Ellen.” She ripped a piece of the bread off and put it in her mouth, chewing it for a few moments before swallowing. Castiel hadn’t even thought about the food being tampered with and mentally kicked himself for not being more wary.
“Dean,” Cas gasped in a moment of clarity, making the older man lift his head and look into Cas’s eyes. Cas’s mouth dropped open and his eyelids drooped. Cas moaned Dean’s name loudly as he came again, pulling Dean with him in a erratic — almost painful — jerk.
“Really? None of you want to say just one thing about him?” Jo asked, her face contorted into a look of sheer shock and disgust.
Until he really thought about it and thought about Dean’s employment to Amara. “That’s why you’re with Amara?”
“Yeah. It also kinda made me a problem child, because I would steal from other kids at school so I could feed my brother,” Dean said. “But when I got to high school, I was put in ceramics class, and the teacher changed my life. He straightened me out, and that’s when I got into clay because with clay, I can make whatever I want. I can escape into a world where what I’m making is actually happening, if that makes sense?”
Cas risked a look behind him but couldn’t see Dean. He stopped and treaded water, looking for any sign of his lover. There was no sign of him, though.
“Best way to wake up in the morning,” Dean laughed, taking hold of Cas’s cock and stroking it. Cas whimpered and thrust his hips slightly. “You want me to take your cock out of your pants?” Dean asked, his mouth right next to Cas’s ear. “Take you into my mouth and make you come?” Dean gave Cas enough time to whimper out a feeble
“God!” Jo huffed. “I’m so tired of alphas labeling me ‘high maintenance’ just because I want them to show me little acts of love.”
Dean turned around slowly, waiting until he was completely facing Castiel to answer. “No, I don’t. I never have.”
“Not everyone has all perfect experiences in their sexual history. I don’t pry, I don’t judge, and I certainly
“Nothing,” he said, throwing the covers off himself and getting up to get dressed. “Nothing is wrong with me.”
Dean pumped his fingers into Cas for several minutes, adding more at just the right time to make Cas’s legs shake and his breath come out in stuttering gasps.
Lisa felt her eyes begin to shed tears. She smiled and wiped them away. “Of course,” She laughed. “If you are.”
“Don’t come,” Dean said again, adding another finger and making Cas just about scream as he rubbed against Cas's prostate relentlessly.
“I should’ve known,” Cas sighed before sitting down at a table with Charlie, Gilda, and Sam following suit; Benny came to sit down not much later with a pitcher of what was called “
“Yeah. It’s Amara’s favorite. She spends a lot of time there,” Dean said. He face fell a little and he looked about to say more, but Castiel stopped him.
“I love you,” Castiel gasped. He moaned deeply as the feeling of Dean’s fingers digging into his hip and thigh, pulling him down into his lap desperately made him reach that amazing high again. “I love you!”
“Dean, I’m gonna make him fucking vomit. We’re gonna be going at it tonight and he’s gonna be upchucking the amazing dinner were gonna make into the toilet because I’m gonna fucking
when you’re in heat. The thought that I don’t satisfy your sexual needs has never even entered a million mile radius of my mind,” Dean said. Castiel’s face broke out into a broad smile and he leaned forward to grab Dean’s shirt, pulling him forwards so they could kiss.
“Much too long,” Dean agreed distractedly. He was trying to find that little spot inside Cas to make him scream.
“Stop struggling, fucker!” Alastair said. He stopped trying to undo his pants and backhanded Castiel, sending him sprawling onto the floor. Castiel heard him chuckling at the whimper he let out and the self-righteous tone of Alastair’s gargled laugh angered Castiel.
“Whoa there, Ben,” Dean said in a soothing voice. He leaned down and put his hand on the child’s back. “What’s wrong?” A crash of thunder sounded and Ben screamed, digging his face into Dean’s leg.
“Yeah?” Cas asked breathlessly. Dean groaned in response. “I like when I can make you feel good.” Dean laughed into Cas’s neck and ended it with a kiss. Cas slowed his hand, making Dean raise his head to look at Cas. The smaller man smiled and swiped his thumb over the slit of Dean’s cock, collecting the precome that started to seep out. He brought it up to his mouth and licked it off.
“Now, if you do hear someone at the door and they don’t say the code word, then you get into the closet and find the keyhole that this key goes to.” He handed her the key from around his neck. “It’s a passageway that leads to a secret room. Inside there’s an escape pod. It’s not like anything you’ve seen before; Gilda, Kevin, and Ash engineered it from some materials Gilda brought from her homeworld. It will take you to a house where you and Ben can live safely with an old friend. Use the code word. It’s to let him know you’re part of my crew and something has happened. He’ll help you.”
“Cas!” Charlie squealed, running over to hug him. “Happy early birthday!” Cas smiled at Charlie before he looked behind her to see Sam and Gilda approaching them.

“Sh,” Dean whispered, opening the bottle of oil and slicking up his fingers. As soon as he rubbed the pad of his finger against Cas’s rim Cas almost screamed, pushing down onto Dean’s hand.
“Right, well…” he began, trying to keep more tears from leaking out of his eyes, but by the looks on his students’s faces, he wasn’t succeeding. “Well, I’m not gonna be able to do much more teaching today because I just found out my mate and I are having twins,” he said, wiping his eyes hastily as he heard choruses of his students congratulating him.
Dean laughed like he couldn’t believe Castiel was saying what he was saying, and his hands came to wrap around Castiel’s body.
So, Castiel snuck about the castle, keeping his ears open for any sounds of footsteps or voices. But as he did that, he found that he should have also been remembering the path he took because he found that he’d lost his way after only an hour.
Castiel recognized those voices. The first had been Dean, and the second had been one of his trusted advisers, an alpha named Robert Singer; everyone called him Bobby.
It wasn’t until the child first stepped his foot onto the uneven wood of the docks did Dean speed up his pace. The child was getting rather close to the edge of the walks and wasn’t looking where he was going.
The Angel’s Academy. That was the school his siblings attended while he schooled himself. They were taught how to harness their powers and sent on crime fighting missions while he was told he couldn’t go with the others because there was just nothing special about him.
Castiel laughed and nodded, giving Dean a quick peck before he nodded to the students still in the room. Dean looked over his shoulder to the stunned students behind him and sobered up.
Cas sighed, closing his eyes and imagining Dean next to him, snoring into his hair and his legs tangled together with Cas’s. He imagined waking up to the sun shining through Dean’s window in his cabin and lighting up the pirates features so beautifully.
Castiel smiled as Dean looked up at him with wide eyes. “You’re not going too fast,” Castiel said, climbing up and settling himself on Dean’s lap, “And no, I don’t want to talk, it’s not enough for me.”
Cas nodded, squeezing Dean’s hand and taking as deep of breaths as he could without it hurting. Gilda pressed down under his rib cage on the left. Cas felt himself scream and lurch upwards. Dean held him down, looking at Gilda.
, Dean!” Cas begged, thrusting his hips up again. Dean had to take a moment to comprise himself. Cas had just cursed in front of him. Cas - the walking definition of innocence - had
“Chuck will keep us informed, too,” Sam said, stepping closer to Dean and putting a hand on his shoulder. “If there are too many more, though, Dean… I don’t know what we’re going to do. We only have so much man power and there are some pretty substantial ships out there. I don’t know if—”
“Dean,” Cas whimpered, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck and burying his face into the hair on the side of his head. “It’s too much; I can’t move. I won’t be able to move.”
Castiel clutched at Dean's hair, whimpering pathetically and looking up at Dean in the same way. He was practically begging Dean. For what? To be touched, Dean knew that was exactly what he wanted. But Dean was firm on his rule: Castiel needed to come himself.
“Oh, thanks,” Dean said. Ellen ushered them over to the bar, pulling the least destroyed chairs out for them to sit.
“Dean!” Cas gasped out, shaking as he was worked through his orgasms. Dean kissed Cas roughly, shoving his tongue into Cas’s mouth and, again, mapping out every inch of the young man’s mouth he could until he had to pull away for air.
“Cas, I… You… We…” Rachel started, and before Castiel could react she was surging forward faster than Castiel had ever seen her move and wrapping him up in a hug. “Thank god! We were so worried about you!”
“I think I’m luckier to have you,” Dean said, kissing Castiel with so much tenderness and love, it took his breath away.
And then Ellen told them the one thing that really stuck with Castiel: omegas got to choose their mate. They could reject any alpha they didn’t want to be with.
Castiel whimpered as he tried to stop. He’d been taught that the best way to get through your heat was to have someone tie you down and stand watch over you. To keep you hydrated and place cool cloths on your forehead so you didn’t overheat. He’d been taught the only way to get through a heat was to suffer.
“Yes,” Cas breathed out, nodding his head vigorously. He slid his hands down Dean’s arms until he could encircle the man’s wrists. “
“Hm, yeah,” Dean said, “Why would I? Every orgasm you have just gets me that much closer to putting my cock in you, doesn’t it?”
Castiel gripped the sheets beneath him and gritted his teeth, forcing his eyes open to see Ellen reaching out of the door to the room. When she pulled her arms back, she held a quilt with a pillow on top in her arms. Castiel’s eyes closed of their own accord and by the time he’d opened them again, Ellen was standing right beside his bed. She kneeled down and reached out to run her hand through Castiel’s hair.
“‘M too,” Cas murmured. Dean could tell he was falling asleep again. And he was okay with that. Cas needed his sleep. But he started frowning and trying to lift his head again.
“No, look, Cas, I’m sorry but if I wanted advice,” Rachel said, and shook her head like she was disappointed in Castiel. “I wouldn’t ask you.”
“No,” Cas said, shaking his head. He brought his hands up and ran them through Dean’s hair. “It’s okay.”
When Castiel was thirteen and he walked into the ale cellar and saw King John redressing himself as one of the omegas from the kitchen cowered in the corner, dress ripped and bloody in certain places he didn’t care to think about after that night, dark bruises on her neck, chest, and face, Alfie was there to listen to Castiel tell him what happened…
"Why are you looking at me like that, baby?" Dean asked quietly, moving his thumb across Castiel's stomach in slow strokes. Castiel only whined high in his throat, pleading. "I don't know what you're asking me for, Omega. Or why you're even asking. You can come whenever you want to, baby. I already told you you could."
“You do understand that you can’t just put your life on pause while Dean’s here, right?” Gabe walked over to sit next to Cas. “I get that you don’t get to see him much and when you do it’s not for very long, however—”
“Dean,” Sam said, his voice slightly annoyed. “C’mon.” Dean ignored him and held Cas as he kissed his way to his neck.
When Dean walked into the mess he almost dropped Cas. It hadn't been changed much, but a few colorful strips of dyed fabric hung from the ceiling and there was colored glass placed around some of the lights that basked the whole room in a pleasant light blue glow.
“Oi. Let me tell you, then,” Meg began, sitting up with an intense and serious look on her face, “See, Cas, true mates are something the universe designed. Meeting them is this huge, great event—it’s a
. Dean has been gone for nine godsdamn months. Three months short of a year since he's seen Dean. Since he's been able to hold him in his arms, kiss him,
“I know, baby,” Dean said, a light and airy tone to his voice. He used both his hands to pinch Cas’s nipples as he kissed down to the boy’s hip bones. “I got you.”
“Right, I mean she’s not feeling well, stomach ache—you know the deal,” Dean said, waving his hand in the air. A few kids chuckled quietly at that.
Cas nodded, finally turning to face Crowley. He didn’t think the King would occupy his time reading books such as
Jo shifted her weight and didn’t respond. Castiel stared questioningly at her until it dawned on him. “Oh,” he said, and Rachel looked at him in concern.
“Aye,” Dean said. “Thank you, Sam.” He turned back to watch the ship as it sailed closer and closer. Sam stayed silent, checking his time keeper and then the ship every now and then. He was constantly gauging the amount of time it would take for them to reach the Impala.
“Maybe this doesn’t mean anything to you,” Dean said, his voice thick with emotion, “maybe you’ll never want to be with me—and that’s okay, but I want you to know I would do absolutely anything to keep you safe.”
He breathed hard as he rushed onto the splintery wooden docks and up the stairs to the ropes. Cas didn't even think twice as he climbed himself onto the Impala, swinging himself over the ledge and landing with a thud and looking around.
Castiel snapped his eyes open. He didn’t really know what he’d been expecting Dean to say, but it wasn’t that. It shouldn’t have surprised him as much as it did, either, but Dean had a knack for defying the stereotypes.
“How are you doing?” Dean asked, cupping Cas’s face with one hand while the other continued to rub at Cas’s side. “Was that too much?”
“Oh,” Dean breathed out, stepping closer to Cas. Neither of them spoke for a long while; Dean just traced over Cas’s chest and rubbed his back in a way that Cas couldn’t feel. “I’m sorry.” Dean sounded broken. “I should’ve never fell asleep. I’m so stupid! I should’ve taken you back.”
“I’ve told you before,” Cas started, trying to pry her hand off as she tugged him out of bed, “I can’t promise that he’ll take you with him. It’s not up to me!”
“Told you...” Dean huffed into Cas’s ear, “...I have stamina.” He punctuated his sentence with a sharp thrust of his hips.
“Uh.” Dean shrugged as Castiel took a step forward. He followed Castiel, and they began walking together. “Yes. I’m going this way.”
“Why, Cas?” Dean asked again, and Castiel didn’t know how he did it but he was so gentle and sincere. He wasn’t coming off as pushy in the least and it baffled Castiel as to how he did it. “Cas, why? Please.”
Dean set his jaw and nodded. “I’ve got you.” He led them out into the hallway and to a closet opposite his own room. Dean opened the doors and pulled out a heavy brown over coat as well as a brimmed hat with three feathers sticking out of it. “Put these on and I can escort you into town, you have to keep your head down and the collars up.”
Cas nodded and turned his head to the side, “Yeah.” He captured Dean’s lips with his and moaned quietly at the fact that he
“Saving a whole bunch of people doesn’t make up for the bad I’ve done,” Dean said. Cas saw Dean’s face change from a look of self-hatred and hurt to one of guilt and sorrow. Dean turned away from him again.
“Oh, Castiel! It looks like God is looking down on us in favor. He wants this to happen! He wants Dean Winchester to die. And He wants it to be at my hands, commanding the most powerful army in the world to hunt him down!”
But just before Castiel could pull himself up to kiss Dean, Dean stepped back. He shook his head and coughed.
Castiel arched up off the bed, sobbing as slick started gushing out around Dean’s cock. He writhed and squirmed against Dean and the bed before he started to simultaneously try and get away and get closer to Dean. His arms shot up to dig into the mess of Dean’s pillows, and Dean just watched it happen, savoring the feel of slick wetting his hips and dripping down his thighs.
Meg laughed. “Not when you have other options like a fucking peanut butter and banana sandwich. But you do what you have to to survive.”
Benny looked at him from the corner of his eye, “Of course.” He smiled, too. “Now go to bed. I think Lisa and Ben are in there right now; sleeping, actually.”
“Cas!” Both Sam and Cas’s heads whipped towards the door just in time to see Dean burst in. His eyes immediately found Cas’s. “Cas…” The air changed in the room and Cas felt his heart squeeze.
Meg stood up and moved over to Castiel. She enveloped him in a hug and radiated calmness through her scent.
“Okay, then, yeah, I’ve had this planned since three and a half years ago, minus one day,” Dean said. Castiel’s face broke out into a bright smile.
Castiel groaned and stomped his foot, but nodded. Dean slowly took his hand off Castiel’s mouth, hovering it close by in case he tried something.
Okay, before I get into anything else, I posted/entered this fic to the BCBB anonymously, apparently, and i have no idea how that happened or how to fix it. So... Just to let y'all know, this is "Are you Your Father's Son?" by Adestielable, with art by Kamicon for the Bottom Cas Big Bang.
“Dinner’s ready,” Benny came into Cas’s medic room, finding Dean laying over Cas’s legs, fast asleep and snoring. He leaned against the door jam and smiled. Seeing Dean in love made him very happy. Dean deserved it.
“No!” Castiel cried, punching Alastair wherever he could—aiming many of his shots at Alastair’s crotch—and scratching at the alpha’s arm in hopes of getting the hand out of his hair. He could fight back much better if he was standing.
. He was getting married in the afternoon and he would be expected to consummate the union in the evening, which wasn’t something he could do. Given how Meg’s last husband wasn’t able to impregnate her and give her an heir to the throne, Cas fully expected something quite horrible to happen to him.
“Gotcha!” Dean yelled, wrapping an arm around Cas’s waist. The younger man squealed and kicked his legs, making Dean fall backwards underwater and let go of Cas’s waist. He was able to get away from Dean and swam back towards the bank.
“For Winchester!” Someone else screamed out, earning the crowds approval in the form of a battle cry. Dean felt his chest swell with pride and admiration for his crew.
“I-if you want to,” he said, looking into Cas’s eyes. Uncertainty clouded his confidence. “We don’t have to get married — of course — I mean,
“You’re not hard to love,” Cas insisted. “It’s hard to get you to accept that you’re loved.” Dean buried his face into Cas’s neck. Which was easily becoming one of his favorite parts of Cas’s body.
it. How it made him feel when he was painting and how a weight seemed to lift from his shoulders when he finished.
“What relationship?” Cas pushed away his plate of salad. The one he’d made up a hour ago when he came in here, after Dean had been called into the drawing room, and had only eaten a few bites of. “We do not have a relationship.”
The young boy, no more than five Dean thought, was getting too close and he didn’t want to see anything happen to the child.
“Fuck,” Dean chuckled, pushing his hips down and thrusting. Cas almost screamed at the friction it caused.
scared in front of anyone... Even me.” He came behind Dean and sat on his knees to hug Dean, resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “I
“Care to prove it?” Meg whispered. Cas froze in his spot as Meg’s hand slid from his shoulder to his chest. “Care to prove you’re excited by me, at the very least,” she continued, her hand sliding lower and lower. Cas could feel his heart pounding in his chest and he wanted nothing more to shrug her off and get as far away as he could… But he was frozen as Meg’s hand stopped just above his waistband. “I wouldn’t mind having some fun, even if we’re not married yet. It’s been so long since my last husband and I laid together. I don’t believe anyone would blame us for jumping the gun a bit. Do you?” Cas held his breath. “What do you say?” Meg whispered, her mouth right by Cas’s ear. Her pinky finger slipped into his waistband and Cas jumped up away from her. His painting fell to the ground, but he didn’t care.
“You sure?” Dean asked, a sly smile on his face. Cas groaned in frustration and dug the heels of his feet into the back of Dean’s thighs. Dean huffed out a laugh, snapping his hips into Cas roughly, making the boy cry out for more. “Hard enough?” Cas moaned in response, snaking his arm down to gather on his fingers some of the precome that had leaked onto his stomach.
“Nay!” Dean rolled his eyes at her impatience. “I will lay our bridge and we will meet in the middle. If you try any funny business, my crew will not hesitate to start feeding the fishes with your crew.” Dean set his jaw and waited as the swabs started lowering the bridge. The other ship was smaller, and so the bridge had to be set at a slant, but Dean took this to be a good thing.
“Flip over, omega,” Dean said, sitting up and pulling out of Castiel. Castiel whined in upset at Dean as he slipped free.
“No!” Cas shrieked, pushing back against Dean and making the man fall on his back onto the bed with Cas on top of him.
Dean groaned as he trudged behind Cas, “Food isn't really what I'm hungry for.” He shook his hand from Cas’s to wrap his arms around Cas’s middle. Cas smiled and opened the door, trying to walk out of their room with Dean pulling him back into his broad chest.
Lisa said once he’d caught up with her, “Thank you, Dean. That was brilliant in there - saying I was part of your crew. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’ll never ask anything else of you; ever. I promise. You’ll never have to hear from Ben and I again. We’ll disappear.”
“I understand,” Crowley said. “Seeing as my daughter’s previous husband came to an…untimely demise in a hunting accident before producing an heir, I’ll keep that in mind while I think this proposal over.”
“Oh.” Dean was still for a moment before he shrugged. “I say hear them out. They can’t hurt me when you’re around, anyway, so there’s no rush to get out of here.”
“Don’t think too much into it.” Castiel huffed. “My omega is the one who thinks it’s a good idea I have heats.”
I have some cherry on my face?” Dean asked, stepping around the head of the table as Cas backed away. “I wonder who put it there?” Dean smirked and lunged to grab Cas.
And then he laughed. Just a little at first, but then he couldn’t stop himself. It took minutes to calm down and when he did, he almost started laughing again at the look on Amara’s face. He just shook his head and leaned back in his chair. “No,” he said.
“Stop talking with them, please. Don’t go out with them anymore because I know part of the reason they’re trying so hard to be friends with you is because they’re trying to mess with me again,” he said. “If your friendship had been able to grow, I wouldn’t’ve put it past them to only be doing it to get to me again. They’re…” Castiel shuddered as memories of those weeks at summer came came flooding back. “They’re really bad people. They told me they’d always be looking for me.”
“Oh, my God,” Rachel said under her breath, sighing in exasperation. “Can we not fight about this? We all have our own feelings about dad, and no one is going to be changing how they feel about him today.”
“So…” Gadreel shrugged again. “What do you really think, Cas? Is he like all those other alphas? Is he trustworthy? Do you like him?”
“Morning, Dean,” Cas responded, placing his hands over his stomach and rubbing away some of the soreness. “I can do that for you?”
“Dean,” Cas whined, feeling heat start to pool in his abdomen. He gasped as he felt Dean pull out. “No!” Dean shushed him as he turned Cas around and hooked his arms under his knees.
“Dean, I'm not gonna last long,” Cas said, tugging on Dean’s hair and rocking his hips up into Dean as the pirate worked over his body. “I'm already so close.”
Castiel agreed, pulling back to finally dive in for a kiss, but Sam’s voice called out and stopped them.
Cas giggled as he pulled off Dean. “I take that as a compliment,” he said, kissing around the head of Dean's cock. The older man groaned, looking down at Cas with hooded eyes.
“Right,” Jess said with uncertainty, “See, they are special instruments Castiel can use or can have used on him by one of us.”
Castiel froze at the question. He felt his heartbeat quicken and his brain fog up. That small snap of the fight had scared him. It had taken him by surprise because try as he might, he wasn’t perfect in the arena. Inferno had surprised him with that blade and then when Castiel was trapped between Inferno and the wall of the arena…it had reminded him of that night two years ago.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. It was like Cas was invisible. Not that he cared much. Meg and Crowley could throw whatever kind of wedding they wanted and Cas wouldn’t care.
“Hey,” Dean said. Castiel jerked his head back up, blushing a little at being caught. “What are you in for?” He asked. Castiel shrugged, trying to be nonchalant.
“Cas,” Dean said right back, “Now arms up.” Cas huffed and lifted his arms to let Dean slide the shirt on. Dean situated the shirt and then swept Cas off his feet. “See? That didn’t take so long.”
“Y-yeah,” Dean panted, wrapping his arms around Cas. “I think… I think I need to lie down.” Cas nodded, clasping his arms around Dean’s waist and helping to hold him up as they walked over to their bed. Dean collapsed onto the bed on his stomach. Cas smiled and crawled over to him, throwing one of his legs over Dean’s.
their eyes! That’s just weird. It’s got to be rather uncomfortable, too… And did you know, bees communicate with each other by dancing and by using pheromones.”
After that, no one dared to tell Castiel what they knew of why he was betrothed to the crown Prince.
Benny smiled back at Cas, “Aye,” he said, nodding his head and pushing off the door jam. “I’ve got more food to attend to; if you don’t mind.” Benny came over and handed Cas a bag with what Cas assumed to be food for Dean.
It's coming up on six months of Dean being gone; the maximum amount of time Dean promised he'd be gone. Cas is starting to really worry.
Castiel’s stomach twisted, and what scared him to his core was that it wasn’t twisting in alarm. It was churning with something pleasant and warm. “So?” Castiel heard his voice break. He had to cough to get it back to normal. “I don’t want anything to do with you. You’re an alpha.”
“How do you feel?” Dean asked, dipping his head to suck Cas’s bottom lip into his mouth briefly. Cas was breathing hard and his hands were on Dean’s neck and in his hair, tugging him impossibly closer. Dean pushed his hand into Cas’s drawers and started to jerk him furiously.
When he was done, Dean kissed Cas, slow and tender before pulling out of him and rolling off to lay beside Cas; reveling in the post orgasmic bliss and catching his breath before talking.
“Really?” Dean asked, smirking and meeting Cas’s thrusts with slow drags of his own. Cas cried out, struggling against Dean’s hold on his wrists. “Don’t move,” Dean growled into Cas’s ear, giving one last push against Cas’s before he got up. The bed dipped as Dean got off to grab the rope from the drawer.
They all thought it was their fault, but it wasn’t any of theirs. They had all been kids. They were just kids, and their father had pitted them against each other. Made them all compete in a war for his attention and affection where no one could possibly win. Castiel’s trauma wasn’t their fault, just as their own traumas weren’t his or each other’s faults either. It wasn’t fair to keep blaming them.
“Dean,” Cas moaned against Dean’s mouth, gasping and arching his back as he felt Dean’s cum spill inside him. He went silent as he came, his body seizing up and muscles going stiff. His eyes snapped open wide like the feeling of orgasming surprised him — even after all his time spent with Dean.
“Alright,” Bobby said, “Alas, Dean. My intent was not to imply that you are not a good king. You are and you care for your people’s safety. All your people.”
Castiel ripped some more bread from his loaf and chewed it slowly, savoring the delicious taste. He’d had bread before, of course, but it had always been the burnt and undercooked loafs; the ones unsuitable to give to King Dean and his court.
Just like last time, Cas watched the ship leave until long after he couldn’t see it anymore. Part of him was staying because he hoped that Dean would turn the ship around and come right back and take him on the ship and never return to Heaven. He knew that wasn’t going to happen. Not yet.
Dean shushed the young man by pushing an oiled finger into his hole. Cas moaned and threw his head back; he gasped out frenzied words that turned into only sounds seconds later. Dean added two more fingers in rapid succession, watching as Cas’s eyes screwed themselves shut and his hips jerked down to meet Dean’s fingers.
Meg finally sighed and stood up, sauntering away from Cas. “Alright,” she said. “It’s no matter, though. You don’t have to be attracted to me. All I need is for you to be able to give me an heir.” Cas watched as she made her way towards his door. She turned around once she reached it and gave Cas a serious and dark look. “Word of advice, Castiel: find something that arouses you. If you don’t, I’m afraid you’ll end up like my last husband.”
The pirate nodded and leaned down to kiss Cas tenderly. “I’m more than okay,” he whispered against Cas’s lips, smiling at the warmth that flared inside him whenever he touched his angel.
Castiel’s heart squeezed at the thought of Alfie spending any time in the dungeon, so he stepped forward, shaking and terrified.
“I take no responsibility for that,” he said closing his eyes and sighing when Cas made quick work of lathering his cock with the oil, making sure to drip a little extra on.
Castiel was looking forward to dinner. Both because he wanted to see Dean, and because he wanted to tell Dean about the writing competition his creative writing professor announced during his lecture. Castiel was practically running across campus when classes ended to get to that café Dean was at as soon as possible. He was so distracted in his haste that he almost missed Rachel when he passed her. The only thing that stopped him was hearing his name called in her voice. It stopped him dead in his tracks and made his blood run cold.
. No one’s heard of it; but it’s there. You know what it means?” Dean asked. “It’s latin.” He paused and shook his head in spite. “Pit of Abominations,” he laughed bitterly. “It’s an island full of monsters; the scum of the earth.”
’s to each other. Dean kept as close as he could while Cas rolled them over. Cas leaned over Dean, looking into his eyes and smiled before pulling the man to sit up. Dean held onto Cas tightly, pressing his chest to Cas’s; even as Cas grabbed the oil and dripped a fair amount onto his member.
"De-e-ean!" Cas moaned brokenly. Dean felt himself getting close to his own release; he quickened his hips only slightly, but it was enough to make Cas gasp loudly and push himself onto his elbows to look into Dean’s eyes.
“Whoa mama!” Gadreel yelled as he set the absinthe back on the table. “That is strong!” He took another swig and smiled ridiculously wide at the label. “Not to straight up change the conversation on you, but damn, this kinda tastes like some kind of cleaner!”
“Oh,” Alfie said. His arm dropped from around Castiel’s shoulders, but Alfie didn’t move too far away. “That is great.”
Dean had decided to stay a little longer than a few weeks this time. Something in which Cas was thankful for. He’s already admitted it to Dean, but Ava had really messed with him. Not in any way that was permanent. But she’d gotten so close to telling everyone their secret, and Cas couldn’t stand to think about what he would do without being able to simply just hold Dean.
“Ben?” Dean asked, putting his hand on the boy’s back and rubbing it in circles. Ben lifted his head and kissed Dean’s cheek.
, really,” Cas blushed. “It’s just… Gilda gave me the all clear last week. Meaning, we can have sex, but we haven’t. And I’m starting to get frustrated because of it. It’s been two
Castiel refused to acknowledge. He heard Dean take a few steps forward and he forced himself not to move back. The King would not get any sign of fear.
Dean smiled and it was like the sun had vanished because of how bright it lit up his face. “Well, I’m glad you’re feeling like that, that’s awesome,” he said, and the sincerity in his voice made Castiel want to kiss him.
“Oh, it feels that good, huh?” Dean said, laughing as he quickly realigned himself and pushed back in. “Came so hard you pushed me out?”
“That’s enough torture for her,” Dean said, “She wanted me to kill her to make a statement, and depriving her of her last chance to be a nuisance to me? That is going to break her more than any other torture would.”
“Yes,” Cas repeated, pushing back to feel Dean’s own growing erection. He smiled and spread his knees farther apart, gripping onto the sheets below him. “So fucking good.”
“You make me feel I am alive. Other men have said they’ve seen Gods come down from the Heavens and speak to them with voices of liquid gold… But I don’t need to see or hear any God. I don’t need them, Cas. Not when I have you.”
is dead!” Dean spat, a deep venomous hatred in his words. The sheer intensity of his tone made Castiel feel almost bad for hating Dean right off the bat. He watched as Dean took a deep breath and straighten back up. Dean looked directly into his eyes after that and spoke clearly, “And so dies with him the order of the kingdom during his heinous rule.”
“Okay,” Cas breathed, wrapping his arms around Dean’s neck. “Good… Do you—I mean, you haven’t stopped… Nevermind.”
Not even a minute later, Cas’s words turned into urgent gasps and whines. Dean lifted his head from Cas’s neck and looked into his eyes. They came at the same time, crushing their lips together and whispering
Dean inhaled sharply, “Not yet.” Cas cried out and let himself drop back onto his back with his arms up gripping the edge of the table again. His legs fell even more open and his thighs trembled violently.
“He said that he had been looking for a boy about my age. Turns out, he’d been watching me for a few years — wanted to make sure I was the right one, I guess.”
“I would like to take you on a walk through the garden,” Dean said, “the marigolds and irises have bloomed and the sight is lovely.”
Dean broke out in a grin, “Okay.” He put his hands on Cas’s hips and rubbed circles with his thumbs into the skin there.
“Huh… Okay, well, I’m following your lead.” Dean reached down to interlock their fingers. “I’m not going anywhere.”
,” Castiel said, almost demanding. Dean laughed and leaned down to kiss Castiel, pushing forward slowly. Castiel moaned when the head of Dean’s cock entered him, he tried to wrap his legs around Dean to pull him in faster, but Dean acted faster and grabbed his knees, pushing them open and into the bed.
By the time Castiel was done with all of the work for those classes, it was almost two, and Dean would be home soon. Castiel could start editing his piece for the current creative writing assignment due in a few days. He’d finished it earlier in the week, and Dean had read it and left notes. All Castiel had to do now was go over it and finalize everything.
Dean couldn’t help the swelling sensation he got in his chest for Cas. “You’re special talent is being the best partner a man could ever ask for.”
The husband either had the driver stop at one of the taverns on the way back to get a few drinks, or he was lying about taking the carriage. However, the constable that helped him when he arrived at the police headquarters did say he smelled alcohol on the husband's breath. Meaning that inconsistency could be crossed off and the motive behind the husband lying about time of arrival and/or departure could be added.
“He told me he killed you!” Benny said, holding onto Alfie like his life depended on it. Castiel guessed maybe it actually might. “He told me he killed you as punishment for what we did!”
— as Dean called it earlier that night — on Dean’s face. He brought it to his mouth and smiled when Dean’s eyes darted down to watch him suck his finger clean.
Castiel jumped and threw his arms around Dean’s neck, joyously pressing his lips to Dean’s in a excited kiss as the people out in the pews cheered and clapped for him and Dean.
Castiel pushed himself off the floor and turned to the door, his heart beating so hard he could feel it in his throat.
“I do not want to accept Dean’s—” Castiel cut himself off as he doubled over in pain again. His omega was going utterly savage and would not let him finish that sentence.
a beta. Dean being an escort meant that he was an alpha because betas just weren’t escorts. Female betas weren’t desirable like omega’s and male betas would always be outshone by alpha’s.
Rachel let go of his arm, only to grab his hand and start tugging him upstairs. “Let’s get you settled,” she said. “Mom got our rooms prepared for us already.”
"You've just undone more than five years worth of sucking up and placating the King of the Royal Kingdom," Michael kicked Cas onto his back. "Crowley does not forgive or forget easily! You've very much just doomed this family and erased my chances of Dean Winchester's head in a jar!"
“We got you!” The little girl yelled and pulled a small wooden dagger out of her sleeve and pretended to stab Dean in the heart. Dean gasped as she did, stumbling back until his knees hit a bench. He fell down onto it, and then slumped back, letting out a huge sigh of air.
to try and help Castiel figure out how to deal with the big emotions—angered him. What did Zachariah actually think? That a
“Cas, this is Meg,” she said, gesturing to the brown haired omega. Meg instantly got up and walked over to him in a way Castiel could only call flirtatious.
Castiel let out this harsh breath because he could hear the emotion in Dean’s voice. It helped to push him closer to that edge, and he desperately moved to meet Dean’s pace because he wanted Dean inside him. The fact that just the alpha’s fingers could make him come made him want nothing more than to feel Dean’s member pumping inside him.
Regardless, Cas took his time to process the news; he didn’t want to think too much about it for a while. And in the meantime, he was as content as he could be under the circumstances. Seeing as though he was still
much sex before,” he teased, and Castiel glared at him. “Well, since you say you’ve only taken an average dick before, sorry to tell you, but you’re not ready to take mine.”
“Prithee, I only want the truth from you. I will do no harm to you or any others, even if what your truth is, is hurtful or upsetting to me,” Dean said, and Castiel had to clench his jaw closed even harder. He felt all these emotions bubbling up to the surface and he knew he couldn’t hold back what he wanted to say. “Please, Castiel, I—”
“Life as a pirate,” Dean started, “It’s dangerous. I would never forgive myself if anything happened to him.”
Castiel couldn’t help but feel a little miffed that they didn’t know his name. If he were an alpha, they would be talking in depth about how cool his name was and how badass it sounded for a beastie pilot.
“Do you know who I am?!” Crowley yelled angrily as two more people—Sam and Ash, Cas deducted—pulled him and Meg out of their carriage. “I’m the bloody King!”
Castiel felt the corner of his mouth twitch up, because he could feel his power start pounding inside him. It was growing with every second as Castiel’s anger boiled to rage.
“You both understand he is right here, yes?” Ellen interrupted, not taking her eyes off of Castiel while she spoke. Charlie and Jess shut up, and looked sheepish as they quickly apologized to Ellen, “You will have to excuse them,” she said, offering the bread in her hand to Castiel again.
"Dean," Cas whispered in a rough voice. He planted his feet and fucked his hips down in a calculated way that had Dean's digit inside him in a second. Cas yelped loudly at the burst of white hot pleasure that shot through him violently.
“You okay for me to move again, Cas?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded frantically, moaning as Dean started thrusting; slowly at first, but before long, Dean picked up his pace and it made Castiel start climbing. Castiel could barely move as Dean set up a quick rhythm, and he stared up at Dean with wide eyes because the feeling of the alpha pumping inside him like this was incredible. It felt like fire was coursing through his veins and lightning was sparking through every nerve.
Castiel huffed. “So let it!” He did what felt natural and rolled his hips down onto Dean’s, moaning loudly at the sensation. “Please!”
Rachel looked like Castiel had hit her. “Of course,” she said, and then glanced at Dean for a split second. “It’s about mom. And it’s important, so can we…?”
Three months after Dean's left, Cas in confronted by a woman from the Novak kitchen staff. Ava tells Cas that if he doesn't get her onto Dean's ship and a place in his crew, she's going to expose them and their relationship.
“What do you want me to do?” Dean asked, giving a sharp thrust of his hips and making Cas curl in towards Dean in surprise.
“Good.” Bobby turned to Castiel one last time. “Now, do you Dame Castiel, take his Majesty the King of Winchester as your mate, and pledge to him before every soul in this holy room to honor and cherish him, to stay with him in sickness and in health, in fair and in foul, be his one true and lasting counselor and solace, and forsaking all other, keep only to him, so long as ye both shall live?”
“Hey!” He said, startling Gilda just a bit. “What’s going on between you and Charlie with Jo? I saw you guys in the mess, too, you know. And if I didn’t know better, I’d say you looked like you were flirting.”
“Is this about what I said last night? Because Cas, I’m sorry I didn’t defend you,” Rachel said, “I should have, and I feel awful that I didn’t.”
Dean was determined to make his angel feel as amazing as possible. He wanted to show Cas how much he treasured him. Dean hummed around his angel and pushed his hands under Cas’s shirt, running his hands over Cas’s sensitive nipples. He pinched and pulled on them before massaging his thumbs over them.
future?” Dean nodded, sliding his hand over Cas’s heart again. “So you didn’t lose hope.” Cas smiled, “You just misplaced it.”
“We got to a room at the end of the hall and I was strapped to a table in there,” Dean said, his voice starting to break. “Alastair was smiling. It was a sickening look on him. Everything is. He’s a damned demon.” He had to stop and collect himself again. “Alastair sent his men away and just… looked at me. I thought he was going to kill me; I thought he was going to do anything than what he actually did…” Dean trailed off, digging his fingers farther into Cas’s muscles. There would be bruises there when Dean let go of him, but Cas didn’t care. He was too focused on letting Dean get his story out. “H-he cut my… My clothes off.” Dean was crying now. “A-and then h-he…" He trailed off. Cas didn't need Dean to finish, though. Cas knew what Dean meant.
“Dean!” Cas gasped, arching into the sensation. Dean thumbed over Cas’s other nipple a few times, getting it hard before he rolled it between his fingers. He pinched and pulled at the bud, reveling in the little gasps and whimpers that Cas was letting out.
“Aye, aye,” Chuck nodded, scurrying away to pass on the order. Dean stood, fiddling with his spyglass before taking it out and checking on the ship.
Castiel looked past Dean’s frame and nodded behind him. “I’m going that way,” he said, surprising both himself and Dean that he was agreeing to letting a perfect stranger walk him home. Well, part way home. Dean was, after all, a stranger; an alpha stranger, and Castiel figured he should probably err on the side of caution.
Cas struggled to his feet, holding his stomach. “I’m sorry.” He coughed and wheezed. His legs shook and his knees felt like they were about to buckle.
Castiel turned away from Dean and squared his shoulders. Dean could practically see the look of calm but murderous rage in his eyes already, and he sighed in defeat.
“Feels so good,” Cas moaned, bringing his hand up and pushing his fingers into Dean’s mouth. Dean closed his eyes, moving his tongue between the digits and sucking the taste of Cas off them. There was a sweetness to it that made Dean shudder in appreciation.
“I’m not.” Dean reached down to pull up his shirt. Castiel looked down and gasped at what he saw. The bullet had hit Dean alright, but it was just a graze on the side of his rib cage. “I didn’t think bullets would hurt that much, and it shocked me more than I care to admit.”
“Cas’s father kneed him in the stomach, Gilda said it was an easy fix, but Cas needed to be put under. She kicked me out because she needs to be able to work with no distractions.”
Dean smirked and oiled up his manhood before teasing Cas’s rim with the head of his cock. “You want me to just fuck into you?”
The person Dean’s father sold him to was an absolute monster. He would come down into the dark floor below his dungeon with his guards and force Dean to be strapped to his “table of nightmares.” Once Dean was tied down and unable to move, he forced himself into Dean. No preparation, no reprieve, no regard for Dean’s well being.
“Someone has to be pure on that ship,” Cas joked, smiling as he sorted through his papers. He handed an article to Gabe and told his uncle to read it before checking his answers.
“No kidding,” Cas breathed out, tilting his head to the side and baring his neck for Dean. “How come you don’t hold out that long every time?”
“I am,” Dean said quietly, his voice shaky. “I’m so sorry, baby.” Cas sobbed out a laugh, shaking his head as he pulled away and crushed his lips to Dean’s.
’s from the regular group, plus a few other’s Cas didn’t know, as they boarded the ship again. It was about nine o’clock and the sun had set two hours ago. It got very cold very fast by the lake, and Dean could only produce so much heat to keep himself as well as Cas’s small body warm.
That line of thought helped him sleep, but it didn’t mean it got rid of his guilt. He often woke up after only four hours of sleep and couldn’t get back to bed no matter how hard he tried. Which meant he was up and ready by the time anyone came to wake him.
“No, I definitely agree with you. But Dean? I mean, has he even touched you? In any way?” Gadreel asked. “Besides that first night.”
“Omega,” he said, his voice deep and commanding, reminding Castiel just how much of an alpha he truly was, “bite me.”
“Hm, not that I can remember.” Castiel laughed softly. “Also, going back to the moving out thing, if we do…” He smirked and leaned in to whisper into Dean’s ear. “We can be as
“We’ll be at the ship, soon, Cas,” Gilda said, reaching over and covering him with a robe. “Dean’s waiting for you. Don’t worry.”
“You know how long I can hold off my orgasm for,” Dean said, smiling before nipping at Cas’s skin. “But this time I can hit your prostate as much as I want, make you come time after time, without release.”
“If worst comes to worst, know that I love you both, you understand?” He said. Lisa nodded, her eyes becoming wet. “Alright, now close the door, lock it, and keep yourselves safe.” She nodded again, slowly and hesitantly closing the door. Dean didn’t hear the locks click right away and let out a shaky breath. “Lock the door, Lisa,” He said. The first lock clicked not long later and then the rest followed — thirteen total. Twelve of which had never been used before this moment.
“Do you mean the plain Honey Nut Cheerios I got for you?” Castiel asked, walking quickly to the aisle with the cereals. “I got those because it lowers your cholesterol and it’s that name brand garbage you like that doesn’t even use real honey. You use the real honey I put out for you, Gabe.”
“Easier than you!” Castiel scoffed. “Everyone is easier to get off than you are. You take forever to fucking knot me!”
“I’d rather not.” Castiel didn’t miss the way Dean’s eyebrows drew together or the way his mouth curved down.
“Fuck! Sl-slow down, Cas,” he gasped, trying to keep Castiel still, but Castiel just batted his hands away and kept grinding against him. “Cas, if you keep this up then my knot is never gonna go down.”
Castiel couldn’t help smiling shyly. “I-I guess,” he said. Dean handed Castiel his phone and Castiel quickly put in his number.
“Yeah, I can feel you,” Dean said, and Castiel collapsed against him, shaking and whimpering for several long minutes until Dean gave one last thrust up into Castiel and emptied another load in the omega.
Castiel’s eyes trailed over Dean’s arms and a small smile came to his face as he reached up to trace over some of the tattoos Dean had. He gave a little bit more attention to the pentagram over Dean’s heart in particular, and Dean watched him trace the endless knot of the star for a few moments. And then Castiel moved his hands, and eyes, down and his smile quickly fell and his lips parted on an excited exhale. Dean could scent the spike of arousal in the air when Castiel got to the ‘v’ of his hips.
The boy and girl laughed as Dean pretended to be dead, but after a few seconds Dean opened one eye and then jumped back to life. He hugged the two children and spun them around a few times before letting them down. The girl ran off while the boy stayed put and reached up towards Dean again, pulling at his pants leg.
Lucifer’s face fell and he leaned forward in his seat. “Why are you with Dean?” He asked in a hushed tone, eyes wide and curious. There was a little bit of pain in there that took Cas off guard. His walls crumbled a bit and he found himself growing curious to where Lucifer was headed with this conversation.
“Yeah, you know, when I was a kid, I needed an outlet, because my dad was… I mean, you understand crappy dads.”
He slowly lowered himself after that, letting out these barely there breathy moans he couldn’t keep in because…it felt
“Did you know that bees never sleep? And that there are three types of honey bees: the queen, the workers, and the drones,” Cas said, seeing Dean smile a little bit. “Honey bees fly at 15 miles per hour and their wings stroke 11,400 times per minute, thus making their distinctive buzz. And they’re the only insect that produce food for humans. They will usually travel approximately 3 miles from their hive. They’re the only bees that die after they sting, they have five eyes: 3 small ones on top of the head and two big ones in front. They also have hair
“And that’s why you apologize so much?” Castiel scoffed. “That’s ridiculous. You’re fucking ridiculous.”
As they entered, everyone stood and bowed to them. Dean walked with Castiel to one end of the table, pulling the chair out for him and pushing it in when Castiel had sat down. He gave Castiel a kiss on the cheek, and then walked leisurely to his own seat at the other end of the table, sitting down and getting comfortable before he addressed the rest of the room.
Castiel watched her for a few seconds, anger rising in him the longer he watched and the next thing he knew he was pulling the trigger over and over again. He pulled and pulled until he there were no more bullets left and Amara was unrecognizable. And then, only then, did he drop the gun and stand up, turning towards where Dean’s body was. Castiel stumbled over to his mate, anguish and despair causing tears to stream down his face.
It was all too much. Indescribable pleasure coursed through every nerve Castiel had and it made the storm outside rage harder. The windows shook from the force of the winds, and Dean groaned loudly as Castiel felt another orgasm tear through him.
“Cas,” Dean whispered, and Castiel turned his attention to where Dean pointed to. His mother was there, a small smile on her face as she looked at him.
“Yes father,” He said timidly. Michael set his jaw and walked over to his door, stopping in the frame and speaking over his shoulder.
“I stabbed her in the lungs,” Dean replied smoothly. It used to feel odd to talk about his work with Cas, but the kid had a talent for professionalism and how to word sentences better. Plus he wasn’t even phased by Dean’s bluntness anymore.
“No,” he said, his voice full of so much righteous authority that Alastair and his comrades flinched, “
“Forsooth,” Meg said in a bored tone. Castiel saw her rolling her eyes and looking at her nails, “It seems as though all he had on his mind all through his teen aged years was Castiel.”
“I can ask Bobby if he would be willing to take over a few of my duties,” Dean said, “Or I can carve out at least one night a week for a dinner like this with you? Perchance—”
“What do I do?” Castiel asked. Charlie pursed her lips in thought, and Meg tapped her chin. They sat in silence for what felt like forever to Castiel, but just as he was about to give up hope, Charlie jumped up.
Cas smiled, “Great,” he said, giving Dean’s hand a squeeze. “How long do I have to stay in here for?”
Cas let out a deep breath and wasn’t able to do anything but nod. Dean backed up and slid into his spot with a smirk. Now Cas was the one who looked flustered and out of it.
Castiel’s thoughts were cut short as Dean’s mouth enveloped his member. All the air was pushed out of his lungs in a single soft moan, and his hands shot down to thread into Dean’s hair.
“Thank you,” Cas said, looking from Sam to Benny. “Really, you have no idea how much that means to me to hear you say that.”
Dean shook his head. “You don’t understand. This isn’t about me. You have no idea what he would do to my crew if he found out.”
“I’m really happy that you’re awake, actually, because I wanted to, um,” the omega shuffled again. “My name is Castiel, by the way. Castiel Novak—you can call me Cas. I live in the house right behind you. I can see you when you work in your backyard through my window.”
“Dean Winchester,” Ava announced. Dean hadn't noticed her until that moment. He looked over at her and his face immediately contorted into a look of hatred and anger. “I want to come on the Impala. I want to join your crew.”
What really made things noticeable was how Rachel was acting. She had always been there to support Castiel, but now it was like she couldn’t even look at him. Something had changed between them, and Castiel couldn’t help but feel like it was partly his fault. He’d always had an inkling Rachel wanted more from their relationship, but he also knew he never wanted to be in a relationship with her. He didn’t want to be in a relationship with anyone. Castiel told himself he just didn’t want partnership, but really it was a combination of a lot of things he wasn’t ready to try and decipher. Either way, Castiel just didn’t want anything more than friendship because even that was hard sometimes.
They woke up early the next morning with heavy hearts and sad eyes. Dean had to leave. And he wouldn’t be back for months. It wasn't different from the previous times that Dean left. But somehow it was also very different. That fact was as agonizing to Dean as it was to Cas. Dean wanted to stay or take his angel with him, but he couldn’t. Neither actions were options.
Dean went back to eating Cas out, circling his tongue around Cas’s rim before he used the grip he had on Cas’s hips to pull the boy towards him as he drove his tongue forward.
“I've been practicing, Dean,” Cas teased. He lifted himself up and dropped back down, letting out a pleased huff. “You know what I did?” he put his hands on Dean’s chest for leverage. “I used that gold you gave me — you know, when you thought I was a whore — and I went into the town market.” Cas rotated his hips, making Dean gasp for breath. “I bought another toy for myself.”
“You can look up now,” Dean informed Cas, not letting go of his hand; not that Cas wanted him too. Dean was a comforting presence, and—maybe because the man took his virginity, maybe some other reason—Cas craved his touch.
“If they do decided to attack then we need to be ready,” Dean said, nodding to himself as he heard the bell being sounded and then shouts from his crew to get ready.
“Maybe I’ll tie you up while I’m at it. Make you watch yourself get fucked,” Dean leaned down to growl into Cas’s ear. “I know you’d love that: to see yourself completely under my control. Completely helpless under me with my dick pounding into you and my hand on your cock.” Cas let out a desperate noise, a cross between a cry and whimper. “I wouldn’t let you come, though. No matter how much you begged and pleaded for me to get you off, I wouldn’t let you. Not until I came first.”
“How may I help you today, Cas?” She asked, stretching out over one of the benches, “What is on your mind?”
Castiel rolled his eyes and closed his door, making a point to audibly lock it before shaking out of his jacket and coming to sit on the couch.
“Benny?” Rachel’s voice came from upstairs followed by quick footsteps until she was on the other side of Benny, helping Castiel to lift him up. Jo came up by Castiel and pushed him away, shooting him a dirty glare as she took his place in holding Benny up.
Ava nodded, “Yeah. I saw his ship dock earlier today.” She strode over to him and grabbed his wrist with impressive strength. “Let’s go. You’re getting me on that ship.”
“How — ah! — How does it feel f-for you, Dean?” Cas asked, his voice hitching every other word. Dean moved his hands down to Cas’s hips again and rubbed circles into his skin.
Dean nodded, closing his own eyes in contentment. They stayed like that until Dean heard Cas’s light snores. The pirate pushed himself up again and studied his peaceful face.
Castiel locked his ankles behind Dean’s back and pulled him so their hips were flush together. He kept Dean’s hips against his until he was able to stop coming with every little shift of Dean inside him; and only then, after he was able to control himself, Castiel hooked his leg around Dean’s hip to roll them so he was on top. He put his hands against Dean’s chest and started to slowly ride the alpha. He gasped every time he rose up, and moaned deeply when he lowered himself. Every little move pushed him closer to the edge.
“We’ll have to eventually,” Dean said, and Castiel couldn’t help the little grunt of disapproval he let out. “Oh, don’t be such a baby.”
“You are already so wet,” Dean said, leaning forward and the next thing Castiel felt was something warm and wet at his entrance. He yelped and shot his hand down to grab a handful of Dean’s hair, stopping him before he could do anything more.
“They should be pulling to port soon,” Sam announced after a while. “About five minutes with the speed they're at now. It could be later, seeing as they have to lay anchor.”
“Y-you haven’t even let me…let me prep you or anything, Cas,” Dean said. Castiel gently pushed him back down on his bed. “Cas, wait, you have to let me—”
“Hey,” he said quietly, even though the other pirates wouldn't have been able to hear them. “You be careful, you hear me?”
Castiel wouldn’t accept this. He turned his attention towards Amara. She looked almost shocked at what she had done and Castiel used that to his advantage. He sprinted as fast as he could, reaching the woman who killed his mate just as she seemed to come back to the present.
“Yeah,” Cas smiled at the three pirates. In the time that Cas was on board, the nights where Dean and him didn’t have sex, they spent around his ship talking with the people who were still up. Most often it was the same group: Charlie, Gilda, Sam, Benny, and sometimes Kevin or Ash. “Thank you for the birthday wishes.”
me and forcing me to—” Dean cut himself off with a gut-wrenching sob. “H-he made me think that deep down I wanted him to touch me. He almost brainwashed me into thinking I liked when he raped me.” Cas let Dean hide his face now. “He did it so many times on just that day. I was so fucking exhausted. I just wanted to die, Cas. I wanted to never have been born…” Dean cried harder.
Dean’s face fell as Castiel trailed off. He reached out to take Castiel’s hand and laced their fingers together. “Cas, I don’t know what to say…” he paused to squeeze Castiel’s hand. “Thank you for trusting me with this. I know this isn’t easy for you to share—”
Cas stared blankly at Lucifer, giving him nothing. “Will you please leave me alone? I feel I’ve made myself very clear about what I want regarding you.”
“Wonderful. I will meet you at the fountain shortly,” he said, and with that he turned to leave. Gilda shut the door and then turned to Castiel.
“Dean!” Cas raised his voice, shutting Dean up and making the man raise his head to look into his eyes. “Did you… You didn’t, I mean, you didn’t leave me because you wanted to, did you?”
Dean nodded slowly, holding Castiel’s eye until the omega’s blush reached the tips of his ears. And then he slapped his hand against the counter and clicked his tongue on the roof of his mouth.
Cas’s father had left early for a day trip to a neighboring town to prep for his trip to the Royal Kingdom next week; meaning, Cas was excused from his schooling and court observations around midday. Furthermore, he got to meet with Dean and have a hike in the woods together.
“‘M fallin’ asleep,” He whined. Dean had to stop himself from laughing at how drugged Cas was at the moment.
“Tell me how much better it feels,” Dean said, slowly pushing back into Castiel and smirking as the omega’s eyes rolled up into his head and he let out a long cry of Dean’s name. “Come on, omega, tell me how much better it feels to get fucked by my cock.”
“Thank you.” Dean looked over his shoulder at Cas, smirking. Cas’s eyes found Dean's again and he blushed, pulling the covers up around him further. “Are you cold?” Dean asked, stepping into a pair of drawers, then pants and sliding a baggy white shirt over his head.
coming.” Cas whined, clenching his fists around the sheets beneath him. He mumbled out incoherent words and thoughts as Dean massaged the soothing lotion into his skin. Dean smiled and listened to his angel’s nonsensical chatter, still loving every sound that came from Cas’s mouth.
“Yes,” Castiel said distractedly as he looked around at the hedges trimmed in the shape of wolves, “I have enjoyed it quite a lot.”
“Whoa there, Cas!” Gadreel said, his voice a little deeper than normal. He’d already downed a few drinks bought for him by some cute betas. “Who gave you that lemon that’s got your face all twisted?”
“You’re right,” he said, nodding. The pit in his stomach started to lessen as he saw Lisa finally come over and take Ben from Dean’s arms, pretending to be put out at their antics but smiling as she walked towards the sleeping quarters. She gave Benny and Cas warm smiles as she approached and then said a quiet
“O-okay,” Dean breathed out as Cas finally was able to pull Dean’s trousers down to about mid-thigh. “What are you angry about then?”
“Then what does he give you that I don’t, Cas!” Gabe yelled. He ripped his hand out of Cas’s and stood up, walking over to the window that overlooked the sea in the town’s library. He glared at Dean’s ship and the moving forms on it. One of them was Dean and right now, Gabe
Unfortunately for that kingdom, Dean, Castiel, and several other trusted Winchester officials had met with every single woman, man, and child to figure why they came to Winchester, and where they would fit in best, and each and every person had a story heavy with abuse and maltreatment of omegas and children from the alphas in their home kingdom.
“If you want,” Cas said, a laugh in his voice. Dean rolled his eyes and smiled fondly as he stood up, making Cas gasp and dig his fingers into Dean’s shoulders. “God, I’m so sensitive!”
Castiel pushed off his stool and moved closer to Dean. He reached up and pulled Dean’s hands away, peering up into his eyes. “I will,” he whispered, “I promise Dean, I will.”
“It’s not a ‘phase’, Gabe.” Castiel said tiredly, “I’ve been eating like this since I could purchase my own food.”
Dean smiled at him. “Good morning,” Dean’s voice was cheery and light. Cas smiled at him before noticing Dean was naked and wet. His eyes traveled down Dean’s body before stopping at the older man’s groin. Pride swelled in Dean’s chest. “Admiring the view?” he joked, walking over to his dresser to grab some fresh clothes. Dean turned, careful not to show his back, and heard Cas speak.
“Oh fuck!” Dean’s legs started to shake. “I’m coming!” He gripped onto Cas’s hair as he curled forward from the intense force of his orgasm.
“Who is that?!” Rachel shouted. Gabe suddenly let go of Castiel and leaned down, grabbing this large rock that he threw into the rift.
“Yes, I was. But I have more planned and I can’t have you ruining it by making me come so embarrassingly early.” Dean leaned back over Cas, hovering over his lips as he reached into his nightstand and grabbed the oil, as well as something else. He leaned back and held his hand behind his back.
The taller man was above him in seconds and beaming at Cas. “I win,” He said, and leaned down to kiss the smaller man.
“Well… You both need each other. You both give the other something that no one else can or will be able to.” Cas started to deny what Benny said, but stopped short because he was right — Benny was making a good point. Yes, there were other people that Dean could have sex with. But none of them could give them what Cas was giving him. Especially not with where they both were in their lives.
“Alpha!” Castiel vision went white and he curled into himself with the intensity of his orgasm, clawing as any part of Dean as he could.
“It’s safe now,” Dean said, almost startling Castiel. Castiel looked up again and saw Dean finally letting his shoulders relax and his posture sag. “She’s gone.”
And right this second, the pain and humiliation he felt that night as they used him for their pleasure and entertainment started to suffocate Castiel. He tried to keep it together just long enough to reach the semi, but he could feel the memories creeping up faster than he was walking. The next thing he knew, he was on his knees, hunched over on the floor as his walls fell and the past consumed him.
“Family,” he repeated. He shook his head at the depth Rachel seemed to think was behind that word for them. “You sure made me feel part of the family last night.”
Castel could feel the butterflies wake inside him. “Um, well, for my creative writing class we were supposed to develop an idea in the first few weeks of class so we can work on that throughout the year, and I thought of this idea about a boy who finds out that he’s descended from a long line of shifters,” Castiel said, and Dean’s eyebrows shot up in interest. “And he finds out that he’s not just an orphan, but he’s the rightful heir to the throne of the shifters and that his family was murdered by another shifter family who gained their shifting abilities through black magic. So, he goes on an adventure to reclaim his rightful place, and while he’s doing this, he makes some new friends and finds an omega that he falls in love with.”
Sam and Benny finished after a tortuously long time, finally pushing the body into the water and standing up. They were both panting slightly, but smiling, nonetheless.
Cas closed his fist more firmly around Dean’s girth, “Like this?” He asked. When Dean nodded, he started to slide his hand along the length. “You're so hard.”
“Nah, you’re just easy to get off,” Dean said, shrugging a shoulder and chuckling as Castiel glared at him in playful anger.
The wedding was today. Cas had been woken up early and ushered off to a small room where he was sat down and fussed about for hours by a group of four maidens. His hair was left alone, for the most part. No one had been able to tame it, so they just left it and said that it wasn’t really what mattered.
“I never thought you’d leave, honestly, much less be the first to leave,” she said, “That must have gone over super well with dad and everyone else.”
“I can’t just tell you,” Cas said, feigning exasperation. He nudged Dean to lift his arm in order to slide under him. “That would ruin the surprise.”
Though, the only reason he was even allowed into the kitchen was because he needed to be schooled as if he himself were royalty and the kitchen was perfect for that when things were slow.
“Yes,” Cas agreed. He gasped as Dean yanked his trousers down even further, nudging him to lift his knees to pull the articles of clothing off all the way. After that, Cas heard the telltale sign of Dean’s buckle coming undone and the dip and shift of the bed as he shucked his own pants and shirts off.
“Hm,” Dean hummed, nodding again. He stopped and planted his feet where he was, waiting for the smaller ship to glide to stop next to his Baby.
“Gabe!” Cas hissed, finally finding his footing and refusing to move another step closer. He darted his eyes over to Dean, immediately stiffening when he saw three women from one of the brothels sidling up to him and touching him. “What do they think they’re doing?”
Castiel nodded hesitantly. “Okay.” He turned to leave, pausing at the door so he could say, “I’ll check back up on you later, okay? And I’ll leave my cell number on the fridge for you in case you need to call me.”
Castiel grabbed handfuls of the bedsheets and bit his bottom lip so hard he was sure he was about to break the skin as Dean’s tongue trailed over his hip bones. He could feel Dean’s hands sliding down his body, and it made him want to both push into it and pull away because it felt so nice yet so foreign.
“Castiel, we can get you a package when your next heat comes to be, if you would like,” Ellen said, “We will not be keeping them from you.”
Cas looked straight into Dean’s eyes. “Stop,” he whispered hoarsely. Dean felt like he was just punched in the stomach. Cas’s eyes were wide and pleading for Dean
Castiel rolled his eyes again and was going to retort back with something when his watch went off to let him know six hours had passed since he’d taken his medication.
“Quick,” Cas agreed. Dean reached behind him and grabbed the soap. He got it wet and then started massaging his soapy hands over Cas’s body.
“Alpha!” Castiel cried, letting go of his cock and arching up from the bed. Dean felt him squeeze around his fingers and a moment later, Castiel’s release shot out from the tip of his cock. “Alpha, thank you!” Castiel screamed, undulating down onto Dean’s fingers as he rode out the wave of his orgasm.
“I knew you lied,” Dean said, smirking as Castiel let out this deep, sighing moan. “You’ve never been fucked before.”
This denial was almost too much for him. He wanted to come right now. And he wanted Dean to use him for his own pleasure. He wanted Dean’s cum to paint his skin so he could see and feel the evidence of Dean’s want for
Castiel heard the soft noises of people sitting down, and it all really hit him then. He was getting married to his true mate, his best friend, the only man and alpha he would ever love. That knowledge calmed his racing heart, and gave him such peace.
Castiel wasn’t sure how long it took for him to stop shivering, but when he did, he pulled back and kissed Dean until he couldn’t breathe. He only broke the kiss because his lungs started burning and instead settled for placing small kisses to Dean’s lips until his eyelids started to grow heavy. When that happened, Dean turned and laid back against the bed with Castiel on top of him, kissing him once more before tucking them under the covers.
“Wedding date and place?” Ruby asked, pursing her lips for a moment before looking up at Crowley. “I suppose you’ll want to hold the ceremony at the chapel? The one on the Circle?”
Dean stepped up to her and took her hands in his, lowering his voice to speak, “I can protect you two. You’ll never have to sell yourself again.”
“I think part of the size of everything this year is because Benny wanted to show off to the new crew members,” Cas said, poking at his food. He’d taken several bites of his food, but that was all. The food was good, but he didn’t have an appetite. “That or it was Dean who told him to make so much so that Dean could show off how great Benny is at that he does.”
Castiel heard his siblings gasp as he pulled his powers back, and they let go of him shortly after. They looked at each other in surprise, patting over themselves in disbelief. Castiel couldn’t help but smile, and he turned around to Dean, reaching out for his hand.
“You’re allowed to be vulnerable in front of me,” Cas said softly, cupping Dean’s face with both of his hands. Dean nodded and tilted his head down to kiss Cas again. He pulled back just for a second to remove his own shirt and then moved his hands under Cas’s shirt.
Castiel used all the strength he could to try and push Amara off him, but she hardly budged and she just laughed.
“Well… That’s… I doubt I could just bend you over and you’d be able to take my cock,” he said. Castiel took another step forward, nodding his head towards the inside of Dean’s house. Dean pushed off his door frame, stepping aside to let Castiel in.
“I’m sorry, I spoke right over you,” he said when Dean got back, and they started towards the produce section. “You don’t care about bees, do you?”
“Okay,” Cas answered. He put his hands against the headboard and locked his elbows. Dean pulled on the ropes until Cas was blushing from head to toe from the vulnerable position he was in.
“I do,” Cas said, lacing his fingers between Dean’s. “I know I’m not going to regret coming with you as sure as I know that I love you.” Dean closed his eyes taking a deep breath.
“Take my clothes off, Dean,” he said, pumping his hand along Dean’s length. “Use the oil and get me ready for you.”
Castiel just focused on that: getting to his semi. He felt his heart pounding in his chest and blood rushing in his ears loud enough that if Dean was following him, he wouldn’t be able to hear it. He chanced a look over his shoulder, almost laughing out loud at the fact he didn’t see Dean behind him anywhere.
“Y-yes,” Castiel said, and Dean’s smile was blinding. He reached into his pocket and almost dropped his phone in his haste to get it into Castiel’s hand. Castiel quickly tapped in his number and handed the phone back to Dean, blushing lightly at the fact that he just gave some alpha his number.
“I’m so sorry, Cas,” Dean said pulling his pants up and buckling his belt. “Fuck! I shouldn’t have fallen asleep.”
“Dad,” Ben yawned with teary eyes, gripping onto Dean’s nightshirt and climbing onto his chest. “I had a bad dream.” Ben said, his voice small and laced with left over fear. “A sticky-monster was trying to eat me.”
“Really?” Castiel gasped, he was about to ask more about what new things people were allowed to do now, but Alfie spoke first.
“That’s not your fault. We all left because we were adults and needed to make a life for ourselves. Jo is just bitter because she never wanted the crime fighting to end.” Rachel said. She smiled softly at him and hugged him again. “And I’m glad you’re here. I’m really glad you’re here.”
“I don’t think you do,” Cas said, slowing as they came to turn onto the pathway leading to Novak Manor. He walked up to the door, hesitating before opening it. “What do you get?”
Castiel began with a firm resolution, no matter how angry his omega was he would not let it make this decision for him.
“Yes,” He said, and then gasped as he felt something new against his member. A quick look down showed him that Dean had wrapped his hand around the both of their members and was stroking them together.
“I’m a twink?” Cas asked, furrowing his brows as he thought about what Dean could mean. “What do you mean by that? What about me is a twink?”
“Absolutely father,” Cas said. Michael strided away to confer with some of his city employees. This court case was a nice vacation from Michael’s mayor duties, but he is still the mayor and has other duties to attend to.
“Well, you know now,” Ruby said, just a slight sneer to her voice. “Anyway, when would you like to have the wedding commence? I suppose you’ll want another summer wedding?”
“Damn,” he chuckled, “When we get married it’s gonna be hard to write vows. I won’t have the words.”
Cas felt his cock ache between his legs and he wanted nothing more than to be able to touch himself or for Dean to reach down and jerk him off. But Dean was the one setting the rules right now. And Cas loved it, if he were to be honest. He loved when Dean dominated him; he loved being helpless to Dean. Part of it was because he knew Dean wouldn’t really hurt him, and he’d stop if it got to be too much. Cas trusted Dean with the most intimate and vulnerable parts of himself.
“And we don’t know how many more ships there really are,” Sam said quietly. Dean reached into his pocket to pull out his spyglass, quickly lifting it to his eye. He saw the ships Sam had mentioned, plus a few more now.
“Oh,” Cas was starting to breathe hard. “Would you… Would you tie me up while I was wearing it, too?”
He smiled warmly at his older brother and motioned for him to open it. Dean eyed the present carefully as he pulled the string tied around it until the fabric fell open. He furrowed his eyebrows together at the stained wood box for a second before flipping it open.
“For the love of God, Dean, you’re not stupid. I know you know I was describing you!” Castiel said, grabbing Dean’s shirt and hauling himself up, making it so Dean had to scramble to catch him. “I never even
odd, the fact that now all these new scents were swirling around him and assaulting his new sense of scenting. It was all just
Castiel grabbed the change of clothes and the towel and quickly showered, feeling better than he had in years as he put on Dean’s old clothes, even if his stomach was growling at him. And when he made his way through the house to the entry hall, he saw Dean standing there holding two sandwiches.
“You were the meanest of all. After dad, you were the leader of the bullying and exclusion,” Castiel said. He dropped the knife and reached out, flicking his wrist to hold Jo up in the air. “You told me for years that I was
Ava nodded. “Yup,” she stepped over to the table where Michael had been just moments ago. “And I don’t want to tell anyone, but I will if I have to.”
“Please!” He cried, trying to control his breathing. Dean pulled his fingers out and kissed up to Cas’s face.
“Cas,” Dean started, turning his head to capture Cas’s lips with his own. “Are you sure? We can wait a little longer, baby. We don’t need to rush.”
Today already appeared to be different, though. It was two in the morning and Dean still couldn’t sleep. He could feel his guilt for leaving Cas behind squeezing itself tighter and tighter around his lungs with each breath and the longer he thought about what he’d done, the worse it got.
Dean shuddered in disgust at himself, thanking whoever might be listening for this rubber band trick because he was one wrong turn away from a panic attack. “Oh, my god. Did I just—
“Don’t move, Dean,” she said and if looks could kill, this kid would definitely be close to meeting his maker.
Once I begin posting the new pirate fic, I will not take this one down (even though I’m really embarrassed by this fic and how not great it is lmao), because it’s very dear to me.
“I’m sorry Dean,” Gilda jerked her head towards the door. “Benny, Sam.” Dean yelled and struggled as Benny and Sam dragged him out.
being enough for me. You’re so far past being enough for me it blows my mind. I love you so much, and I hate that you think you’re not worthy of love.”
