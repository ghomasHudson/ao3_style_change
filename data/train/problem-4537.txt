They're oblivious to everything else - because, for them, everything else has faded away. The room is gone, they are in an eerie, empty space of blackness and nothingness. There is only them and miles of uncharted skin burning to be explored.
She would get more once they were both awake and able to talk to her, she was sure. For now, she had enough to mull over and walked down the hall lost in thought. She remembered what she had seen when she last saw the boy. He had been young, cocky, and scared, looking for a father who was eluding him. She had sensed he was destined for big things. Bigger than she was used to dealing with. She had assumed it was all tied into the apocalypse- that-never-was, but now she knew that was not it. His life had seemed to go murky when she had looked down it before; there was a fog that obscured it from her prying eyes. It had unsettled her, and she had been terse with the child out of unease. Now she had glimpsed down that same life and seen his fate merged with that of an angel so closely they became one. She didn't know which disturbed her more.
He's a little light-headed and looks away from Dean. He stares at the highway to keep from shaking at the sheer magnitude of …of …
“Sam. We should talk,” Castiel settles into the chair opposite Sam, he raises his brow at the titles he sees scattered all around the table.
"She's into you, man- and it seems like it's not one-sided? You gonna take her up on her offer?" Sam laughs as he watches Castiel, Angel of the Lord blush.
Three days after they had left the Bayou behind them, Sam got up early. He got dressed and slipped out of the cabin well before Dean would be waking up. He was determined to get to the bottom of this. He knew what he was planning wasn't exactly kosher. Magic usually had a price -but Dean needed him. He had researched this spell, found a list of ingredients and instructions, and he was determined to complete the ritual as soon as he could.
They spend the rest of the night looking up rituals to break holds on people- hoping that Cas qualifies as enough of a person for the spells to work. They search through all of the books they can get their hands on. They make a brief call to Kevin for some translation work, and then they fall asleep for a few hours after the sun has already come out over the horizon. They have a half-formed plan that requires a few ingredients and a secure location by the time lunch rolls around.
Sam had been very distracted by Sean's aura. It was magnificent. It reminded him of Castiel, but it shone bright orange instead of the blue-white of the Angel's. It gave off energy like nothing he'd seen so far.
“Well, it turns out Tamar was kind of a big deal. She is a direct decedent of Christ. Through her firstborn son. Perez. It looks like some pagan historians disagreed with that though- saying that Zerah was the true firstborn.” Kevin pages through his notes. “There was a big dispute about it back in those days. Being firstborn meant you got the inheritance, the family deferred to you as their leader, and you pretty much called the shots. Jews would bestow a blessing of oils and prayer on the firstborn as a kind of rite, to pass all that to the next generation. Pagans believed differently- they followed that the first baby to “breach into this world from the formless void of the before” was the firstborn and heir.”
“Like bring it back from the dark side? How the hell do you do that?” Dean slumps back into his chair, his brief exhilaration crashing down.
"Good point. I guess his status as half-fallen or something probably made him an easy target. Not like the guy hangs out with other Angels who might pick up on this." Sam is starting to work the problem now. "Do you think it's one of them, though? Why would they not just do the heavy lifting themselves- I mean, Cas isn't especially powerful, right?"
. He takes a deep breath and the scent hits him right in the groin. He shoots up alarmed by the rush of desire that pools in his gut. He is getting hard.
“Dean.” Cas says and when their eyes lock it’s all heat and smolder “I will cherish this, and I will make it good for you” Castiel is all alpha male as he rushes Dean
“Fine, I will give you the cliff notes but then I will leave you with the visions and you can pen down all the details. Deal?” Gabriel slumps against the sinks next to Kevin.
At 4 am Dean gives up. He gets up and pulls on his clothes and sets out in search of coffee. His exhaustion and frustration swirl around in his gut until it solidifies into a pretty shitty mood.
He used to take extreme creative license with the meals he made for Sammy when they were kids. Mixing things that God never intended to even share shelf space let alone a bowl- in odd concoctions- just to make sure the kid got enough to eat to keep him growing. Some days he regrets taking that to heart so completely- it would have been nice to be the
He mixes the dust and sand and pours it in a circle, setting candles all around the perimeter. He lights the incense and sits cross-legged in the middle of the ring. He tries to clear his mind- inhaling the rich scent of sage with hints of patchouli. The smell always takes him back to adolescence, when Dad and Dean finally included him on hunts. Supplies and mystic shopping trips were some of the first duties assigned to him. He had resented being sheltered from the action- being "left out". He had been so naive.
“Wow” Charlie sighs. “Shit this is the first time I have ever had an OTP go all out cannon on me…I don’t know what to do with the feels!” She squeaks.
Cas looks confused and opens his mouth to say something, but before he gets anything out that chain pulls tight. It's darker than Sam's seen it, and it looks like its hurting Cas. Its swirling and glowing and Cas' face goes slack in pain. The fire seems to be blocking him from any outside influence- that was a gamble, and Sam's relieved Dean suggested it.
"It's got to be. We could use a window." Dean is getting excited, Hellhounds you can see are a lot less terrifying than the invisible kind.
Dean shoots up violently, sweat running down his back. His stomach roils and he takes a deep breath trying to stop the whiskey from making an encore appearance.
Mary follows her son trying to figure out what she is missing here. She knows Dean cares about Castiel, she saw that when she met him. That hug they had shared had spoken volumes; of trust, affection and years of loyalty. She had come to care for the Angel too, its’ not like she meant for him to get hurt. Or anyone to at that.
Sam drifts in and out of sleep with his face against the window. He thinks they ought to pull over for the night soon and says as much to Mary when they cross the Arizona border. They agree to pull off at the next exit and find some dinner. He suspects Dean is going to be extra grumpy after going all day without food. He is proven right less than 5 minutes later when he hears a grumble coming from the back seat.
, he saw what remained of her victims in the morgue. This was one crazy bitch; she was collecting hearts – four so far. They still had no idea why.
This was slowly driving him insane- and he could think of two solutions. Try to drown his questions with whisky -the way he was taught or talk to someone who would maybe tell him?
Cas frowns at him then his face clears with realization. “Oh, you mean when I told Dean I loved him?” and he looks at Sam with such an innocent look, no embarrassment, no blushing. He’s even making eye contact as he waits for Sam to follow up with an actual question.
And if there is any other spell work around- it would manifest as some kind of symbol indicating the magics' intention or at least origin. Sam was sure that he would be able to see Benny's influence all over Dean; he only hoped it gave him enough clues so that he could get rid of it. He read about ancient vampires having been able to manipulate humans with compelling spells and a sort of hypnosis if they had drunk some of their victims' blood. He wondered what kind of control letting a vampire possess you would give them. He hates Benny just a little more thinking about the creature exploiting his brother.
No stutter, no denial, no attempt to elaborate or explain or deflect. He just waits for Sam to say something. And Sam almost forgets how to
The drive to Idaho was pleasant; Dean loved being out on the road with his baby, and Cas was good company. They'd needed some time to talk, Cas had been through a lot with Naomi, and it was time they checked in with each other. They'd been talking more; it was a thing he'd been trying. Sam has been on him about "not bottling things up" for years, and he figured he'd give it a shot a few months ago.
Okay so I am getting excited about this story again...it is definitely the biggest idea I've chased. It gets a little overwhelming when I think about it...Let me know what you think!
“Cas!” Dean’s head shoots up, and his face- for once- betrays his emotions. A landslide of relief floods Sam’s entire being. Mostly Dean’s but mixed in is his own. It’s a lot.
They finished their breakfast making small talk. Sam would catch Dean fiddling with Cas’ tie every few minutes with a soft look in his eyes and a ghost of a smile on his lips.
"Yeah, now we just have to figure out who has the juice to pull Cas' strings. Before it gets any worse." Sam is really sure he doesn't want to meet whoever is behind this kind of move.
Wendy's place turned into a brawl after three mooks showed up- Sam only walked away from it cause Cas showed up in the nick of time to save his ass.  Not before a demon ended up possessing the poor woman. They did manage to learn that the demons were getting their information from a hostage Crowley was keeping at a motel. Sam exorcised Wendy, and she could not stop swooning over him – he was glad to leave.
Missouri explains how a group of powers and mystics, even some old gods like Adrastia and younger ones like Yuè Lǎo stepped in and nurtured this line. Followed it and fated its growth and that this line would usher in the new age."
“Wonderful. Congratulations.” Sam says swallowing and trying to smile at the old woman. “This may sound strange but did you ever notice any disturbances in the house, anything you couldn’t explain?” He screws his face into the sympathetic one he uses when trying to convey that he will believe what they tell him, no matter how crazy it might sound.
“The line is ending. It has reached its culmination. You are the last of the Guardians. You must see it made whole so it can restore balance.”
Cas turns and walks back over to Dean – seemingly unaware that he's headed into a tempest, and as Sam watches Cas' grace blooms and starts bleeding into Dean's raging aura and it calms at first contact. Sam stares- he can't help it.
"So, you and Clarence spent the year honeymooning in Purgatory. I guess you're off the hook. How come Sam never looked for me?"
“Taking you apart with my mouth.” Cas replies and his voice vibrates against Dean making him squirm. And Cas just dives right back in. Licking a feather-light circle around his opening and then without warning thrusting his talented tongue against it again and again and again.
Cas. How come you and Dean were there for a year? A whole damn year. Was Dean that hard to convince? I mean I get it- I still don’t trust Benny. He’s a vamp. But what took so long? And what did they guy do to eventually talk him into it?”
"And it's just a few words of Enochian" Kevin starts to explain handing a piece of paper to Cas, who starts to read the ancient script. "The spell has to be spoken after you finish each of the three trials."
Banging on the door violently cause there is only so much he can take- he keeps trying to get through to them “Guys! Come on! We have to go!!! I saw a ghost in the bathroom- we need to deal with this.”
moment Castiel popped back in. The world moved on as if nothing happened and no one else seemed to have noticed at all. Cas continued his previously aborted movement towards Dean. He succeeded in freeing him from the death grip the late Gavin had had around Dean's throat.
noticed that although they shared rooms on the road- they didn’t seem to be spending the night together in the Bunker. Dean or Cas would sneak back to their own rooms after their
John feels like there is a lot she isn’t telling him. A lot everyone is not telling him. But he also knows that there is a lot to tell, and he’s only been back for two days. He’ll be patient.
"But could a coyote like you do it?" Sam keeps pushing, and Dean can see him focus his eyes the way he's been doing when he tries to hold back the psychic input.
that he thinks it might explode out of his chest like they do on cartoons. He swallows thickly and wipes an errand tear off his cheek as he takes Cas’ hand in his and just stares. Sam shoves him lightly from behind and Dean snaps out of his trance to realize that Jody has said something and he totally missed it.
“So… your tie is still wet?” Sam asks trying not to sound annoyed because he does not look like a federal agent. But he also kinda wants to laugh at the grumpy, disheveled former angel.
"Your time has passed; it is the age of light. Relinquish your hold." A crisp voice full of authority says, and Sam turns to see a being he doesn't even know where to begin in describing. It's light and wings and eyes.
“Yeah, we killed the werewolf and saved a girl. She gave me her phone number and Dad told me I was too young for that. I am confused. I call you on the phone all the time.” Jack looks up at Dean with that signature head tilt that he copies perfectly- and he tries not to die from the sweetness of it all.
right?” Sam’s mouth started quirking in a smile as he thought about it. For the last few months his brother has been having more sex than either of them ever had and this whole time he was seeing the same person over and over. He was in a
Dean hit his head against the shelf he was reaching into for the eggs. “Son of a bitch!” He straightened and slowly turned to look at Kevin and Sam who were both eagerly awaiting his reply it seemed.
"And you saw something with Cas?" Dean stops his pacing to face Sam. A worried look etched on his features; his aura is pulsing in a frantic pattern that Sam could read as anxious even if he had the emotional intelligence of a rock.
“Yeah. Of course. Look, man, I know we haven’t talked about…” and here he gestures between the two of them wildly “you know…this, this thing. Us.” His face feels like it’s reaching new shades of red by the second.
"So, you know who this is, Dean, walking us to our deaths?" he is making a pretty desperate play here but desperate times and all that.
- Sam seriously wonders sometimes why they haven't ganked that asshole yet- he has his uses, but Sam doesn't think he's worth the trouble. Not when he sees Alfie's condition. The angel looks terrible- he broadcasts pain, and utter horror and Sam's new senses nearly overwhelm him, he has a hard time keeping his face controlled and his breakfast from coming up.
“Father Thompson had some unorthodox ideas, which is why the Men of Letters were interested,” the now old man says.
They pat each other’s backs before releasing and then John says goodnight and walks to his room down the hall.
He was walking past the barn when he heard the music coming from the living quarters at the back. Walking up, he listens at the door that leads to Ellie's room. "I touch myself" from the Divinyls blaring through the thin wood. He pushes it aside, and there is Ellie dancing and holding a bottle of the good stuff. Turning to the sound her turns off the stereo, causing her to spin around.
And then she lifts her arm and points a long ghostly finger towards the sound. Sam reluctantly follows her with his eyes, and he sees great beasts, the ones from before, they are pushing and gnashing their teeth. A subtle, invisible force holds them back, but it flickers as he watches- it's failing. He knows that instinctually.
“That’s what we’re still working on. I mean, the whole point of the lineage was to lead up to Christ being born, we’re not sure why it matters now?” Kevin says, getting that look he gets when he is working a particularly tricky problem.
“Dean, Sam.” He offers in greeting. “I was using the laundromat at the motel to wash out the mud from last night and it appears someone moved my clothes out of the dryer before they were done.”
“Whatever, Bitch. It’s not my fault I’m irresistible” Dean swaggered ahead and plopped down onto his bed. He pulled out his phone and started texting. Getting that same look on his face.
with him, it’s like everything means more. You know? I mean I’ve only ever lived with Lisa and that was messed up right from the start. I just wanted to do this right with him.”
"He can not be trusted, Castiel. None of them can. They do not realize the peril they place us all in by persisting down this path!" She shifts slightly in his grasp.
"Great, so Sam has to officiate a wedding? This whole thing seems crazier by the day." Dean takes a big gulp of his beer and turns to Sam.
Dean gave Sam a few "What is your deal?" looks after they had fallen back into silence but hadn't said anything to him since. Sam figures Dean's letting him "stew in his juices."
“Sam, Jack – can you give us a minute please?” Cas asks giving them a soft pleading look. He knows Sam is excited, intellectually curious and not trying to poke at Dean, but he also knows Dean is not ready for this.
Sam was ready to go home – he had spent the last week getting more and more upset every time he spotted a random novelty sock on the cabin door. Turns out they didn’t have any more vacancies and he had spent more than his fair share napping in the Impala while Dean got his rocks off in a big comfy bed.
"Nah- he shacked up with some chick, got a job, and a dog- white pickets all the way" Dean tries to sound casual; it still stings.
He stared at Cas and watched as he flicked the lighter into the open grave sending Mr.Roe off to wherever dead spirits go. There was an incredible flash that seemed to dispel the dark from the whole graveyard. And Sam could see two Reapers standing at the edge of the cemetery, watchful sentries waiting for the spirit to find peace. The spectacle was a lot to absorb with his new sensorium. It almost distracted him from noticing that the connection between Cas and -what he could only assume to be heaven- looked more substantial than it did before and was throbbing in a deep inky black. The same kind of black he had seen around the demons at the warehouse. His gut roiled at that realization and he felt a strong urge to sever it. It gave off a darkness that had nothing to do with the color.
They're sipping their coffee when Dean and Cas come walking into the restaurant. Dean is frowning and Cas looks annoyed. “What happened to you guys?” Mary asks amusement leaking into her voice. “I got you, boys, some coffee” she nods at the other side of the booth and the two steaming mugs.
Sam falls asleep at the war table. They had been researching the Guardians all morning, and he hardly slept last night. Or if his intuition was correct, he hadn't slept at all.
“Not a ghost. An apparition.” Mary explains. She remembers working a case similar to this with her father and cousins back in the day. “I think we're dealing with a kind of Poltergeist, born out of intense adolescent emotional and sexual energy.”
Dean is grateful that Sam suggested Mary stay with him and Eileen. He knows he needs to talk to Cas and he wants to do it right. They decided to hit the road right away because Dean wants to get home. He wants the next time he makes love to Cas to be in his bed. In
Then suddenly Dean pulls him into a fierce but brief hug. It surprises him, was Dean really that worried about his reaction? God, he must have messed his kids up more than he ever realized.
Standing there in the middle of the room, for all the world to see is his brother. His older, hereto for apparently straight brother. Who at this very moment seems to be unbuttoning the jeans of a very aroused and very male angel.
. Not that she couldn’t see that they were crazy in love, pretty much way back when she was seven. The surprise was that they
over the last few months. Easier than she thought possible. Even sending them a gag gift for Valentines- fuzzy handcuff with a card saying it was from Hot Topical. The wedding news threw her. Dean had asked
"It was a big boat," Cas says, looking at Dean and the corners of his mouth do that attempt at lifting that counts as his smile. Sam watches as Dean blushes, on his cheeks and his aura. He sneaks a peek under the table, and the cord is pulsing brightly again- as he suspected.
After stammering like an idiot about being “tired” and “saving money” and trying not to look at anyone, Sam had rolled his eyes and sent Dean to get the room. It had just gotten more awkward from there on out. He didn’t know how to act around Cas, he’d never had a boyfriend- oh god he was gonna have to think of a better word. He tried to talk to Cas the next morning before Sam got back from his run but was interrupted by the sweaty Moose delivering breakfast. He had been sleeping on the couch in their room ever since and they still hadn’t talked.
"I just don't want you to tell him that he's all tied up with Cas, not before I can figure out my visions. I know my brother; he hates feeling like others are stuck with him. He'd balk. He'd push Cas away saying its' for his own good, and Cas- he doesn't need that right now, he's been through a lot recently. "Sam fills the coffee pot with tap water.
Cas just looks up from his cup with slightly raised eyebrows focusing on Sam and waits. The guy is very sparing with words, another thing he considered in his analysis as he lay awake last night. He tends to say what needs to be said, gutted down to the core, makes his point with no adjectives or superlatives. Efficient, sometimes brutally honest.
Once the reinforcements arrived, the fight was over pretty quick. Crowley was swearing his revenge on Meg before snapping his fingers and disappearing.
Eileen rushes after Sam and vines shoot out from everywhere determined to keep her away. She hacks through them with Sam’s dropped ax.
"Your age has ended. It is time for you to return to the well for your slumber." The angel, Sam, is sure, commands, and points a flaming sword at the creature. The creature scurries away with a lasting deafening wail that has Sam clutching at his ears.
Sam spends a few more hours pouring over his research. He's running down the theory that the cord is symbolic of Yuè Lǎo the Chinese god. Legend has it that Yuè would tie a red string around the ankles of couples fated to marry or in earlier translations -people who were destined to meet for an important reason. The legend is obscure, and each book has a different take on it. Some surrounding cultures have their own versions of it; Koreans tell of the string being around their wrists, for example. Sam decided to follow the Chinese one down since it dates back the furthest, and the particular cord he is interested in is around ankles. His brothers and his best friends' ankles.
John had been stunned when he appeared in the large library facing his oldest son. Dean had looked so much older than when he had last seen him, and he could tell he had missed a lot. Sam was still hunting with Dean and that both surprised
“Mom. Dude, are you listening?” Sam gives Dean his frowning face that simultaneously says, “are you for real?” and “are you ok?”.
“That’s fine- at least we got a roof, we’ve dealt with way worse accommodations before Dean,” Sam says frowning at the harsh look Dean shoots him.
The fight is a close one. Dean's glasses get knocked off, and he can't track the hound. He's almost kibble when Cas shows up just in time, he tries to stab the mutt with his blade, and they wrestle around on the ground. Dean's heart seizes up when it rips across the angel's chest, and blood rushes out. He grabs the demon knife and rushes; he tackles it and barely keeps its gaping jaw from locking around his throat for the kill when he plunges Ruby's blade deep into its belly. He keeps pushing the knife along the body of the beast, and its blood comes rushing out, covering him in warm rancid smelling liquid. The hound's limp body slumps, and he pushes it to the right, letting it collapse on the floor. Then he looks up and sees Cas getting up, his coat stained with the blood that was seeping from what would have been a mortal wound if Cas was mortal. His flesh already knitted back together and as good as new. Dean knows he overreacted, but it's hard to remember that his best friend is indestructible when he's got his insides on the outside.
Sam needed to figure out what that could mean. He also needed to figure out what was happening to Cas. Benny and Dean's situation suddenly seemed a lot less urgent.
“What did you have in mind?” Cas asks, his voice dropping lower, letting Dean know that he has some very specific ideas of his own in mind.
Cas keeps sinking until he finally bottoms out. Flush with Dean in a new way, one flesh. The heat and pressure is so much. He concentrates hard on what he needs to accomplish here to keep from shooting off like a bottle rocket. He stills to give Dean time to stretch around him, to relax his walls and regain his own focus. He leans down and crushes their mouths against each other. His tongue thrusting almost violently into Dean’s mouth in imitation of what his cock is aching to do.
“I guess what I’m trying to get at is that you have been so patient. So, faithful, loyal and you sacrificed everything for me, for
Ellie gave them the rundown of the family as they arrived. The rich farther with his young wife, the failed country singer with the drinking problem, and the youngest sister who lives in Paris.
“Shit, it’s a little weird ok. I mean Dad was like super straight so that alone was a mind fuck. But you guys, you guys are the real thing. I know. Cause it reminds me of Mom and Dad.” She swallows down the swell of emotion bubbling up and pulls on her dress just to have something to distract her from his eyes.
Replaying the events that just unfolded- Dean stammers out “So…when you walked in when we were..umm…you know…”
The feedback he's getting from Dean makes it near impossible. Dean is alight with fear and barely contained fury. The fear seems to be for Castiel- not off Castiel.
Early on a Saturday morning, Missouri calls with a break "Samuel, I thought you had done your worst when you kicked the hornets' nest that was the apocalypse, but you went and outdone yourself!"
“They only have one room. Some stupid homecoming week for the university- the whole town is swarming with people.” Dean grouses as he drops onto the seat scooting over to make room for Cas.
“My kids didn’t think I knew. But I did.” Ms. Holt says with an edge to her voice now that is very out of place coming from a retired orphanage director sitting in her robe.
"Samuel, it is good to meet you finally" her voice is warm and steady. Whatever she is, she is not afraid of him. Long white hair flows down her chest in loose waves. She is wearing a flowing robe that reminds Sam of the elves in Lord of the Rings. She is old, although he gets the impression that she is even older than he might guess. She radiates command, but it's a calm, gentle power, unlike anything he's encountered before. It's how he imagined Angels being before he got to know them.
"I turned it back on… my penance is going well. I have uh… been helping people, Dean." Cas sounded guilt-ridden. Sam could relate; he knew what it felt like to let Dean down, to feel like you had to earn back his trust.
“He did. There would have been considerable rearranging of destinies and close supervision of the line from then on. It might be why he disappeared shortly after the Crucifixion. It would have been an enormously tasking undertaking.” Castiel suddenly feels pity for his brother, and it lessens the sting of betrayal he has always harbored for his abandonment of the host.
“I have told you before, we share a profound bond. Formed when your soul interacted with my grace in hell. We have always been in tune with each other on a psychic level.” Castiel explains.
"It's the trials, pretty sure it's a one-way trip. Don't tell Sammy. He'd only try to talk me outa doing them." Dean said, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.
"Good morning to you too, Mr. Manners." Dean frowns down at the pan and flips the golden-brown cake.
He can feel his own blood running down his chest where Dean had left his claim. They are gasping for breath and floating in a haze of chemicals as their nerves try to reclaim their own spendings from between synapses. He collapses on his husband and they just rest for a while. Unaware of time passing.
“You’re welcome” he deadpans and heads back in to check for more survivors. He has to reach for the stair rail on the porch to keep from falling on his ass as the latest quake rattles through the house.
Two hours into the drive they pulled over for a quick breakfast in Salina, the sun had been up for an hour or so and Dean’s stomach was making ungodly sounds. The diner had a pancake special with all-you-can-eat bacon-
"Now, you take a few sips of this and head straight for bed, you hear me?" She whispered while soaking the bag in a cup.
All seven shots find their mark and she drops to the floor and Cas follows. For an unforgiving second Dean thinks she took Cas with her and he rushes over to the pile of tan fabric.
Cas can sense the tension coming from Dean- it's suffocating. It makes him restless. He feels it under his sternum, in the pads of his fingers, his mouth is dry.  He doesn’t understand
Over the next few days, they research and make some progress. Missouri and Kevin are staying with Garth. They have made headway on the translations and are reaching out to the hunter community for leads.
“I love you. I love you Cas. Not like a brother. You get me?” Dean’s voice is cracking again and he looks at Cas and he is so open, his defenses down.
Yeah, he wanted to have sex with Cas last night. God, he still does. He can’t remember a time before when he didn’t want to take a tumble in the sack with this man. But he isn’t just a man. He's his best friend and an angel. He was going to hell again.
“Beloved, you would be bound to me for eternity. You would wish that?” Cas asks placing a flat hand over Dean’s heart and he feels a tear roll down his cheek.
The case had been a doozy, James, their cop-turned-witch friend, had been set up by one of his own, and they'd almost caught on too late. James' familiar was a beautiful woman who liked to take the shape of a large Doberman, and her relationship with James had seemed endlessly fascinating to Dean.
“That’s what you think upset me??? Although- I really would have expected more from you!  If you were going to do
“Not regretting it already?” Dean says with his usual humor to mask the lingering insecurities he has when it comes to things he doesn’t believe he deserves.
“Shut up, you’re just jealous cause I married a grade A hottie” Dean smiles at Sam and gives him a light punch on the shoulder.
“Cas, she almost got you killed! I can’t just get over that!” Dean almost shouted as he turned to face Castiel. His face was plaintive, begging Castiel to understand that Dean needed to keep those he cared about, his family, safe.
"Wow, I thought you were being cute- that he was a medic or something…but you mean he's really an Angel?" Ellie blurts out, staring at Cas with big eyes.
stuff happens, but you’re not supposed to meddle. Don’t you watch sci fi? Never ends well.” He says and takes a deep breath.
"Okay, guys, I think that's it for today. I can't try to track one more family tree, or I might lose it." Sam says slamming shut the hefty leather tome he's been referencing.
“No you ninny” Crowley sasses. “She collects the hearts of men in love. God, it’s a good thing you have your looks squirrel.” He shoots Sam an almost sympathetic look and pops out of their room.
“That sounds like a good plan. We could make sure nothing bad happens.” Cas deadpans. This does sound like a great way for him to get a sense of the place. It would be good to figure out if it is indeed a ghost or something else.
Dean certainly had never expected to see his father again. He remembered being vaguely surprised when he had encountered
Cas looks at Dean and his frustration must show for Dean is smiling at him and then chuckles when Cas deepens his frown.
“What about me? What about the people who care about you?” even after all these years, Sam can’t believe Dean is so dismissive of his own worth.
Sam gets another mental-movie- clip. Cas again, accompanied by a devastating sense of terror and powerlessness as Sam sees through Dean's eyes- a Leviathan has the angel on the ground and is poised for the kill. Then Sam is flooded with the purest sense of relief and joy when Benny steps up and beheads the creature.
Sam approaches the car wearily, not knowing what to expect from the spell. He's surprised to not really see anything obvious; Dean has a slight glow around him – he assumes that's the "aura" Bobby wrote about seeing on people. It fluctuates and has a kind of pulsating quality to it. The color seems to be gold, with some flecks of green around the edges. His second sight fades in and out on the drive. He tries to push his thoughts away and focus on the mission- he could explore his new senses after the Angel is safe.
He watches as John gently helps Jack flip a piece of sizzling toast in a pan. They are both smiling, and the kitchen feels warm and comfortable.
"We guard the line. We protect it from those who seek to corrupt it, but it is time. The line is ending, and you are its final sentinel. As it was foretold so it shall be."
“Oh honey, it’s just the suit, I’m sure of it!” Mary smiles at Dean and she is having a hard time keeping the giggles at bay.  She had gone dressed in casual clothes just wanting to blend in while Dean had done the usual FBI schtick.
“Let me check…” Sam answers getting his phone out and opening google maps. “…we're about 10 hours out.”
“Son, I want you to know that I don’t care that he’s a man.” He wants to say something more eloquent. More profound but he thinks he’s said all he can manage at the moment. Heaven taught him a lot about acceptance and what really matters but he’s still no poet when it comes to talking about things.
He tries to make sense of it all as he drives to the store for supplies. He needed to clear his head and get some air. Dean was talking to Kevin about leads on how to get into Hell, and Sam really hated thinking about Dean going back there- on a typical day- but especially with as weak as he's been getting.
Going to try and get a chapter out every day but I am working on my Residency applications too so no promises.
Sam was leading the way, increasingly irritated with the timing of the case and wanting it to be over. Dean and Cas were bringing up the rear carrying the shovels. Sam had a duffle slung over his shoulder filled with salt and lighter fluid, and he carried Dean's old sawed-off, loaded with rock salt shells. The headstone was where the map had indicated it would be, and Sam set about clearing the long-dead flower arrangements from the topsoil, so they could start digging when Mr. Roe made an appearance.
Sam shoot him his patented bitch face and says: “Crowley’s right. It’s a good thing you have your looks Dean.” With that he starts for the Impala with the supplies the demon had provided for their rescue mission.
turned out to be a ghoul and they took care of it. The drive back was uneventful save for the fact that Dean was letting Sam drive Baby. He had fractured his wrist on the son of a bitch and was currently sporting a bright blue cast.
"You have really gone and opened the flood gates now, haven't you? That spell was meant for civilians; you already had powers. Strong powers- you must be seeing the earth's magnetic field? I bet you about ready to lose your mind?" she asks with some concern.
He was somewhat relieved to know it wasn’t a controlling spell. It would have been purged along with the chain if it was. He was taking small comfort in that.
Sam watched -captivated as the white light of grace flowed from Cas' digits into Dean's body, and it suffused through his own light shadow. Dean's colors briefly flared in a blue hue and then calmed to that soft pink that has been showing up occasionally. To Sam's amazement, Cas shimmered in that same rosy hue for a split second, and the red cord at their feet blazed
. It’s not every day someone saves you from Hell, and then defies Heaven for you. He gets it. They have a…
They stand there in the middle of the room kissing- like one of them just came back from the war, when there is a loud knock at the door. And it shatters their cocoon.
“Oh yes. And no, I don’t mind.” She gestures for them to follow her inside swinging open the door and turning to lead them into a living room. “I was up, early morning prayer.” She gestures to an open Bible and rosary on the coffee table.
He hauled himself up and went over to his sink, rinsing the copper taste from his mouth, putting on his favorite robe and a brave face he set out in search of coffee.  He finds Sam nursing a cup with an open bottle of Tylenol on the countertop.
for Dean. No one else could fit into their life so effortlessly and be such an asset. Cas literally put Dean back together after Hell- there was nothing he didn’t know about Dean and he still worshiped the ground he walked on. Dean deserved that. He had spent his whole life putting everyone else first. He gave up every chance at a normal life to take care of Sam and save strangers who never even knew. Dean was a friggin’
them – it hardly seems noteworthy. But its all-consuming. It’s all Cas can think about. They haven’t talked about it, not surprising, Dean doesn’t talk. Dean is the one who’s eyes looked accusing and stepped away.
Does the taint of Azazel's blood dull his own emotions, or is Dean different? Dean, who raised him, who put him first at every turn, who died for him. Does he simply feel more?
What if yellow eyes had left him alone? Would Mary and John be sitting on the porch drinking Arnold Palmers, maybe talking about Sam out in California? Wondering when they’d see Dean and the grandkids again?
This seems to be going better though, well even. She steps into Cas’ personal space and is running her fingers up and down his tie.
"I was woken up by the Impala and figured I might as well start working when it's quiet." He says, taking a big gulp of water after Dean placed a glass in front of him.
“Yeah well, I guess that’s the last frontier. I don’t know man, you are the only guy I ever did anything with. It just seemed so vulnerable, I was scared to before. I wanted to try it after we moved in but I was already kinda planning today and I thought it might be, you know special or something. If I waited. Then when you told me about the mating thing- I knew. I wanted to do it this way.” Dean is crimson and looking at their hands that are clasped together tightly between them.
"Do you know anything that can help? This is all really unfamiliar, and it just keeps piling on." He may have sounded a little desperate, but he was.
The crossroad demon tells them what they needed to know, and they dispatch him before the sun is even fully over the horizon.
“Yeah, your dad sent me your pictures. Did you guys have a good time?” Dean smiles as Jack yawns. The kid doesn’t need to sleep but sometimes he manages to get so excited about things that he gets a little tuckered.
“Yes Dean. He loves you. And I am pretty sure you love him. Now go to sleep and we can talk about it in the morning ok?” Sam pulls the blanket over his brother and leaves the door cracked open so he can hear if he throws up later.
“Yeah, figured we’d need to shower and change before we start talking to people. And I could do with some breakfast.” Dean says putting the car in park. There is a Denny’s across the street and his stomach is growling.
That gets Sam's attention, and he steals a glance over at the pair. He can see her real face, but he finds he can tune it out if he focuses just a little, and she seems to be genuine in her flirting. He finds it fascinating that one of the worst women they know seems to have the hots for one of the most innocent people he's ever met. Opposites really do seem to attract in this case.
After he established that he is not going to be stumbling onto the King of Hell in this part of town, he started thinking about the ritual. He had found it in an old book of Bobby's, according to the notes in the margin Bobby had used it, successfully, and that was good enough for Sam.
It was enough to make him believe in soulmates again. He smiles thinking about little feet running up and down the halls of the Bunker and says a little prayer to whoever is listening thanking them for sending this Angel into Dean’s life.
Sam shot through the front door before Dean even had the trunk of the Impala closed. He beelined it for the bedroom and yanked the book containing the spell out with an impatient jerk. Shutting the door behind him and telling Dean that he needed to make a phone call in private.
“How are you, Dean?” Cas gets to the heart of the matter in that way he has. He knows Dean well enough to know that John being back would have him off balance and on edge.
They whispered as they made their way into the kitchen, and Sam started heating water on the gas range. Missouri had brought some special tea that she promised would let his mind rest.
when you said the first part.” Sam tries to explain, he feels like he is not making the point he was trying to make. Cas isn’t getting it.
They learn that rogue reapers run a border crossing operation, and they set off to find the one they got a lead on. Dean is feeling better, but Sam insists on going with him, so all three of them end up crammed into the back seat of a cab. The driver is the man they were looking for, and he keeps nervously glancing in the mirror while talking into his headset.
“Dean, I am not sure I understand?” Cas hedges carefully. He thinks he might know what his husband is saying but he is still new at “reading between the lines” that he feels he needs to clarify.
He wanted to compare notes- tell Dean what he thought he knew and get his brother’s insight into the situation. He just had to get to the book for a few minutes to make sure of some facts before he got Dean alarmed.
“It was me. Your brother is stubborn. I tried to protect him. To lead the leviathan away from him. To keep him safe. But he kept coming. He kept searching. I tried
"Yeah, I thought it was Angel radio first, it changes shape- the first time I noticed- it was just a thin cord, but it didn't do anything. Then I started noticing it would kinda yank him away- like after Alfie." Sam goes on. "He gets this flash of like fear on his face, and then he pops out. But this last time- it was different."
I went back and did some minor editing on the previous chapters, its' been a while since I watched season 8 and got my timelines confused. I took out references to Sam and the trails since he wasn't technically doing them at this point so sorry about that.  Also as usual- unbeta'd so let me know if you see any mistakes.
"When we were in the graveyard. Time stopped- like in a cartoon. It was crazy, Dean. I saw Cas pop away looking terrified and the chain pulling tight, and then everything just froze. I mean, the leaves stopped moving- I couldn't breathe, but I didn't need to either. Anyways, it was maybe 5 minutes, and then Cas plops back down here, and everything starts moving again." Sam sits down on the couch, remembering the events still leave him feeling chilled.
They settle around the Formica dinner set, and Dean starts in on his burger with extra bacon and cheese, and the wave of
John heard the garage a few hours after retiring to the room they let him stay in. Part of him was nearly overcome with curiosity but he figured they needed some time. Besides, it's not every day your husband's father comes back from the dead and moves into a room down the hall. They probably would want to deal with that. And it was really late. So, he tried his best to got back to sleep.
Cas slumps down onto the forest floor with the grace of the town drunk falling off his regular bar seat.
Dean and Cas come sauntering out of the no-longer-haunted house at that moment having taken the time to put their clothes back on-
They just took out a nest of Vampires, but it did not go smoothly. Dean was a walking bruise and Sam was pretty sure he had a broken nose. He went out to get some painkillers since they ran out earlier this morning. And as he stepped up to the door he noticed something that made his mind screech to a halt.
Dean has been saying he's concerned about Cas, but Sam was distracted by the whole vampire situation and had blown it off.
The others tell him they are almost ready for bed but want to cross-reference one more line, and he bids them good night. He stops by his room and grabs a robe and his slippers before heading for the bathroom. The water pressure is fantastic in the bunker, but he's too tired to get any enjoyment out of his shower. He plops down in his bed just after midnight and falls asleep in seconds.
“Wait-you said they have a kid. That’s not possible. They are just two regular guys right. I mean you’re not going to make one of them …you know…oh god. What are you going to do?” Kevin is flashing back to some horrific mpreg Anime his cousin used to be into and shudders.
Sammy looks at him with his “are you okay” expression and Dean just shakes his head and hands him his precious craft beer. They bitch about the job, crack Crowley jokes and correct Cas when he says or does something “not human”.
He’s currently very concerned over any potential fallout from Cas’ puppet master. He has Kevin looking into who could have this much power, and he’s even asked Crowley -though only after Dean broke his resolve on contacting that slimy bastard. So far, they have nothing concrete. Crowley had agreed with the current theory of “heaven,” and as vague as that was, it was also the most terrifying of possibilities.
"Cas! Cas- come on, buddy- say something." Dean's voice sounds hoarse- like he's been screaming. Sam vaguely recalls that he was. He'd cried for Cas the second the explosion rocked the small clearing.  So much had happened in those few seconds it takes his mind a minute to make sense of it.
These things usually end hilariously with the new human either getting slapped or- a few times- he has had a drink end up in his face. And he always looks positively dumbfounded when they storm off.
Sam had long ago stopped teasing them about their new relationship status and had solidly moved on to being jealous. Not that he begrudged either of them their happiness- he just wanted some of his own. Sam wanted what Dean and Cas had and how weird was that?  Dean was completely in love and not even a little bit freaked out about it- not even the part where he was in love with a dude who happened to have been an Angel for a few millennia. Sam never thought he’d see the day but Dean was content and Cas was a great influence on him. He calmed his brother- Dean was no longer drinking himself to death and actually tried really hard not to die on a daily basis.
She frowned at the memory and again concentrated on calling forth the willful Castiel. He had been coded to perfect obedience. She had broken him,
“Shotgun gets to pick the music – limited time deal Cas.” Dean smirks as the angel settles down next to him.  He feels like a teenager. His face keeps getting hot and his dick is half hard. He smiles a big sappy grin when Cas puts in one of his rare power ballad tapes. REO Speedwagon starts playing as he pulls out of the lot leaving Littlefield.
Like mojo an endless supply of lube. He even uses that awesome healing touch of his to magic Dean’s dick back to life- over and over and over. He is rearing to go again and he just had orgasm
Cas turns his focus back to Dean curious to hear him explain, he slowly lets his hand fall to his lap and realizes that Dean is still holding his arm around him and Cas feels his heart speed up.
Just as he’s about to turn and get back in the car, a familiar voice says, “What ifs’ never solved a damn problem- and neither does feeling sorry for yourself!”
Sam's sitting on the same worn couch he and Dean once shared in what feels like a different life. He isn't even surprised that she had found him. Missouri is making tea in her small kitchen, and he's left taking in all the knick-knacks and family photos on her walls. She hasn't given off any psychic clues since he ran into her. He gets a distinct impression that it's intentional.
, he never thought about it again. Having Mary in his life has not been without its share of issues but he feels like it was something he needed. It had helped him settle into the man he had become. He had some lingering insecurities, resentments and repressed feelings that have largely been dealt with- in no small part due to having his mom around. No one had been more surprised by that than Dean himself. Seems like God’s sister had known what she was doing after all.
“I would not think to do this thing if you objected. I am not your father but you are important to me, I do not wish to cause you any more heart ache”
It’s earlier than he’d like to be up- especially after the night they had -after everything he never did eat his midnight snack. As a consequence, his stomach is growling at him in unhappy rumbles.
inch of the place. He is going to have to talk to Dean if this doesn’t blow over soon- it’s embarrassing to watch. It's not even the first time this has happened. Maybe its cause Mary was there to see this time?
"Start at the beginning. Who is this Naomi chick- and what did she want with you?" Dean slumps down on the ratty couch next to Sam.
Dean falls over to lie next to Cas breathing heavily and coming down from his latest orgasm. His lips are dry and he feels exhausted. Cas reaches for him. Desperate still after hours and hours of this.
The nights had been the worst. Hearing Dean's prayers as he pleaded for Cas to hear him. Cas heard every agonizing word. His heart aches, remembering the deals Dean tried to make with any higher power who cared to listen. The promises he made if he ever got to see Cas again.
“Yeah their activities are probably feeding the poltergeist” Eileen adds looking at Sam apologetically. She knows that Sam has been rooting for Dean and Cas to have a talk about the obvious feelings they have for each other, but she can also imagine how awkward talking about them and sex must be in the presence of his mother and the woman he is currently sleeping with.
“Sorry kiddo, no spoilers for you personally- where’s the fun in that.” Gabriel answers sounding amused.
Sam feels a little uncomfortable, or restless…like something is crawling under his skin. He feels hot and flustered. It might have something to do with the gorgeous girl talking to him. She has her hand on his arm and is looking at him like she hasn’t had dinner and he is on the menu.
“He did not leave until much later,” Castiel replies slumping into his chair slightly. Dean’s aura reaches out towards the angel, and they do that merging thing that they sometimes do. It always makes Sam feel like he’s seeing something private though he isn’t sure it is. He hasn’t seen either of them reach out to Kevin like that, but it hardly surprises him. Kevin is family, but he is still new, and he keeps himself guarded, his aura is always tightly controlled and rarely extends past his skin more than a few millimeters. In fact, the only time it really moves is when his mother is near.
Vivid glimpses of people meeting in strange and unusual ways. Tamar and her father in law.  A Chinese warrior falls in love with the prisoner he is escorting from Mongolia. There is a man who saves a young girl during the crusades. Another woman finds a hunter wounded in a boreal forest and nurses him back to health. The hardened outlaw robbing a train catches the eye of a young countess visiting the Frontier.  A couple meets helping slaves escape in the underground railroad—a factory worker who bumps into a soldier returning from Germany.
“Come again? What work?” Kevin asked getting really low on patience- this guys was being cryptic on purpose he suspected.
He heard the Impala pull into the garage and was surprised to hear Sam talking to someone in hushed tones. He glanced at the digital clock display on the DVD player- it was 3:20 am.
He starts mouthing along Cas throat- loving the feel of his day-old beard, rough against his lips. Cas is the only man he’s ever been with like this. Not that he never thought about it before Cas came along- he did. But his life was always complicated enough- he just figured that since he also liked women he’d just keep things simple. Besides the hunting community isn’t’ likely to have a pride parade any time soon -so why bother? He knows Sam has always known- you can only hide
I am in medical school and things are kinda snowballing over here as the academic year is coming to an end- I have another board exam coming up soon so BIG, IMPORTANT, future defying stuff. That said- this morning in the shower it hit me.
“Thank you Claire. It means everything to hear you say that.” He says and she could swear his voice isn’t holding steady either. “Could I, um, would it be okay if I …if we…hugged?” he stammers out, eyes fliting between hers and the floor.
“Herrrhemmm”: Sam doesn’t want to interrupt this ‘cause God knows it was a long time coming but they should really get out of here. There is no way someone didn't hear all that gun fire.
Sorry guys. I have been busy with life stuff...boot camp actually so internet is not real available. Here is the final chapter-not proofed very well so sorry for any mistakes. Also there is a time stamp half written that I will hopefully upload soon. As a thank you to those of you who stuck around...see end notes for more info.
"Damn, that boy has a knack for getting in the middle of things, with a capital, T" Bobby says, thinking about everything he just learned. "Sounds like he's supposed to preside over the apocalypse-
It's a day late I apologize, I am almost done with the next chapter and I was trying to post both on the same day but alas. Here is a short chapter hopefully to be followed by a longer one soon.
Or any night for the rest of his life, because he falls asleep curled up in the arms of his very own Guardian Angel.
“Um, when you thought you were dying, you ummm. The part about love?” Sam hedges hoping Cas remembers the exact phrase so he doesn’t have to repeat it.
“Cas?!? Cas is that really …you? How?” Dean voice sounds small, choked and cautious like he expects something terrible to happen if he makes too much noise.
Dean knows Cas loves it when he preps himself, so they can go straight to fucking hard and fast. Cas also loves to prep him himself, on nights when they have time and can take it slow. Cas has spent hours making Dean come over and over on just his fingers, or his tongue before finally giving Dean what he needs. But Dean missed him too much these last few days to waste a second.
“How are you doing, Dean?” Cas asks, and his mouth pulls into that almost smile he gives Dean sometimes. That soft look -directed at him-makes him feel like he does when he pushes Baby over one of the hills outside of town. That split second when they catch air, and he’s weightless.
"I do like a man who can handle his meat." She teases, and Cas gets flustered- he has a hard time with innuendo and never knows how to respond, so he just keeps flipping the steaks.
“You should get some rest. We have, much to do and you have not been taking care of yourself,” Castiel says, his voice low and comforting, there’s gentle admonition there, also fondness.
Sorry for the delay between posts. Medical school is an epic time suck. ;) Promise the next one will be up very soon- which is why this one is kinda short.
They collected the ingredients, basic herbs, holy water, a selenite crystal to draw the spell into. Dean had suggested they add some holy oil to make it more Angelic, and the logic had been sound. Dean really is so much smarter than he ever gives himself credit for.
Dean says the short incantation to release Bobby, and they watch as his essence is spirited up to Heaven where he should have been the whole time.
He slumps his shoulders. “I know you probably won’t believe me, but I never wanted you boys to stay in this life. I always hoped we would go back to normal after we got the son of a bitch. That you’d go to school, that Dean would find a girl. That we could walk away.”
Kevin looks at the room and recognizes it as the huge dining room they never use just off the library. There is a lot of people sitting around what looks like a turkey dinner. Their voices sound kind of tinny like its coming through something.
“Hey,” Dean gets out and tries to smile. Cas is looking at him like he just came back from the dead, so it must have been pretty bad.
“Oh yeah, I accidentally took yours in the dark the other day. I was kinda glad though- Sam noticed and that’s how we got to talking about
"The Old Ones, huh? They were a race of beings made of pure chaos- I always thought they were just part of Pagan creation myths. Go figure you boys find a way to piss them off."
“Sounds like a plan.” Dean says getting the waitresses' attention and ordering a slice of pecan pie. “Thanks, Darlin’” he says as she walks away, he thinks he hears Cas huff in annoyance at his side. It makes his leg speed up.
Sam runs his fingers through his hair in frustration – this was not going as planned. How did this go so wrong?  “Cas did you mean it?”
“I don’t know why it matters, just that it does. I mean, the Guardian seems to think so. God, I wish I knew what the hell this all means!” Sam lets out in frustration getting a surprised look from everyone in the room. Dean’s worry hits him, followed closely by Castiel’s interest and mostly irritation from Kevin. It suffocates him, and he needs to get out.
Between Sam's abilities and Cas' angelic powers, they make short work of the retrieval. Cas glows so brightly when he picks up the tablet that Sam had to close his eyes. Even with it safely tucked in his trench coat, Sam can still sense the pulsing energy coming off it. He hasn't been near the demon tablet physically since the spell, and he wonders if it would feel the same.
In the dark room, the light streaming in from the hallway highlights the bed in the center. Sheets are crumpled up and clothes are everywhere. And Dean is on his stomach pillows propped under his hips and a very annoyed looking Angel is draped over his back. They are both very naked and covered in a shining gleam of sweat.
"He was compromised, he attacked me, and I had to defend myself": Cas answers in a strange, robotic tone with a far-off look in his eyes. He doesn't even return the stare from Dean. He
Sam can't speak- his ears are bleeding, and his breathing is labored. The sound is pushing in on him. He just stares at the Guardian and tries to convey how pissed off all her non sequitur is, making him while fighting to stay on his feet.
Their lights merge and pulse in time with each other, and Sam gets that warm glowing feeling they sometimes broadcast.
“The part that has me stumped is this. When me and Bobby popped out it took Benny a few hours to meet up with us.
I just want to thank everyone who commented on my last "update" y'all we so supportive and kind! I am doing this for YOU! I should be able to write more now that interview travel is done. Finishing some ER work in the next few weeks but have a few free days coming up that I will use to gain some momentum with this story. *yelling into the abyss*LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE STILL OUT THERE...there.. there.....
Mary and Sam get lost in a conversation about how trans fats are now a bad thing and Mary is quite dumbfounded.
Tonight, Dean’s making Turkey pastrami on rye. Sam teases him about “getting domestic” a lot these days – but fuck it. He deserves to. He’s never had access to a full kitchen on a reliable basis and he’s letting his inner Rachel Ray show a bit-
“Thank you, Mary. You look nice too. As do you, Dean.” Cas stammers out, clearly uncomfortable with all the eyes on him. “ Sam assured me I no longer look like a
“Yeah, I got big fast. Had to. You’re taller than Pops!” Jack says looking slightly awed. “But not as tall as Sam.”
Dean can’t stop the moan that slips out from his throat at the feel of his husband’s desire pressing into his stomach. He’s starting to get turned on too but for now, he might just take advantage of the situation.
“I have to do something, Sam. He’s just so damaged, and I can’t get a good purchase” Cas sighs and looks down at Dean again.
He strolled across the parking lot and just before he reached for the door- there it was again- a wool sock covered in pie slices.
“So with Dean and Cas…” Mary tries but can’t get herself to finish that sentence. She isn’t even used to being the same age as her sons, she is going to need some time getting used the idea of them and sex. She isn’t naïve despite Sam’s teasing she just needs to adjust from 4-year-old mud pie baking ray of sunshine to thirty-something ruggedly handsome man first, thank you very much.
He was startled when Dean leaned forward and pressed his lips against his- he thought they were getting ready to throw punches. It took him less than a second to redirect that pent-up energy into kissing back. And it was the closest to flying he has been in months.
"Yeah, well, I'm trying to get rid of it, it's just tougher than I thought, and we had a lot come up after."
Dean decides that words really are not his friends and takes the three steps that separate them when he sees the look of apprehension on Cas’ face. It’s like the man expects to be pushed away, told to leave again. He can’t stand it a second longer.
Cas snaps out of his recollection when the Reaper leaves. Dean is staring at him with a look so tender Cas wants to reach out to him. He realizes the familiar itch his hand gets in moments like these is somehow less and more when his hand is in Dean's.
- Cas was right about that word. Cas’ lips are soft and yielding and not dry at all. Dean moans a little when Cas starts kissing back- and he is gonna go ahead and chalk that up to adrenaline. His body comes alive with electricity and his nerves hum in pleasure as he finally gets to taste his angel. He is still gripping the tie and about to bring his tongue into play when he hears someone clearing their throat.
“God Cas you’re gorgeous you know that?” he said taking in the tan skin and toned muscles of his angel. “I wanna try something I’ve been thinking off for a while…that ok?” Dean asked Cas while sliding his boxer briefs off his slim hips. “I trust you Dean.” Cas said in that gravel voice that made Dean leak pre-come onto his own boxers.
