"Answer my question. Where are the drops?" John repeated.
The hours flowed by, the children coming and going. They took interest in Sherlock, asking his name, what work he did, and what his family was like. Molly taught him several phrases that he spoke with the children, answering their questions with her help, and was met with smiles and giggles. He was given a grass mat to sit on, which was much more comfortable then the rough floor of the cave. The air was cool and dry, but the fire was kept high enough to keep him warm. He was shown to the women's privy, a small area with a low ceiling off the main cavern, where he visited several times to relieve himself into a clay chamber pot. He would have preferred to go outside, but it seemed against the rules for him to leave the cave or venture far from his circle.
"Can I sleep in your room tonight?" Sherlock asked.
There was a gentle nudge against his bottom and he realized Sherlock was fully hard up against him. The familiar and invigorating feeling of a stiff cock-
Sherlock slept lightly, naked, as always, on his bed of grass mats. He rose from the depths of sleep into the early dawn, in an unusual state of arousal. The feeling of warmth and damp around his manhood was strong. With one hand wrapped around the rigidity of his shaft, he delivered slow, languid strokes. In a state of demi-sleep, he imagined that it was John's human hand, not his own, that was delivering his pleasure. In his fantasy, John enveloped Sherlock's body in his strong tentacles, reserving his hands for more gentle explorations of Sherlock's most private places. The John in Sherlock's imagination was surprisingly talented in delivering such satisfaction, and in a few short moments, Sherlock quietly uttered John's name as he reached his climax. His seed spilled in creamy spurts across his own stomach.
Sherlock clutched the gunnel of the canoe with both hands as he leaned into the sea spray and vomited into the ocean. The waves seemed to get bigger by the minute and the bow of the small boat rose higher and higher, only to crash back down into the trough of the next wave. He spit once more into the water, doing his best to rid the taste of stomach acid from his tongue. He looked back towards the stern to where John was a shifting mass beneath the surface, his many strong tentacles stroking through the water to push the canoe through the angry seas. The only part of the great creature above water were his muscled human arms and sturdy hands where they gripped the sides of the hull.
The door creaked open slowly and Sherlock peaked inside.
John turned and leaned on the counter while he waited for the water to boil. He tried not to stare at his attractive flatmate too often, it wasn't exactly typical behavior, but Sherlock seemed so engrossed in his work he was unlikely to notice. Sherlock was dressed in black trousers and a silk navy blue shirt that was straining at the buttons across his narrow chest. His black curly hair fell over his forehead, a stark contrast to the flawless, pale skin underneath. Sherlock had beautiful eyes: green and blue, with flecks of darker pigment mixed in. The sharpness of his cheekbones, gauntness of his face, and delightful upturned nose gave him an aristocratic air that John just loved to admire.
Sherlock was quiet now, save for the stuffy sound of trying to breath through the aftermath of the tears.
Finally,
For once she was a true love of mine."
Sherlock watched with wide eyes as John removed the bottle, still sealed, from the small box.
Sherlock blinked up at him, eyes wide, with a look of anxiety and confusion.
John took his time. He held Sherlock's hips down and bobbed his head back and forward. He worked the frenulum with his tongue and enjoyed the scandalous noises that Sherlock was making. He licked at the slit, tasting the bitterness of precum and the distinctness of Sherlock. He heard his bedside drawer open and a cold bottle of lube was pressed against the back of his hand.
"Come on, back to bed, Sherlock." John spoke firmly but kept his voice quiet. He was met with a quiet mew of protest. "Turn towards me," he commanded. Sherlock turned in the chair to face him, eyes pointed to the kitchen but unfocused. "Stand up," John added and again Sherlock complied. Once he was standing, John took him by the arm and led him down the corridor.
"Sure, Sherlock," John said as he scooted back towards the wall and lifted the blanket, providing a clear invitation to his flatmate to come in under the warm covers. Sherlock crossed the room and climbed into bed. John noticed Sherlock had brought his own pillow when he placed it next to John's and settled himself into bed, lying on his side facing him.
Two more days passed that Sherlock spent with the Island People. He missed John terribly and tried not to show his sadness and disappointment that John had not come back for him yet. He did his best to learn as much as he could. He learned many dozens of words and phrases from Molly and practiced speaking with the women. He expressed gratitude to them for keeping him safe and he did his best to help them in their work rebuilding what the storm had taken away. He learned their ways of preparing food and weaving grasses into matts and crafting a cloth they called kapa from plant fibers. He watched the men rebuild houses from a distance, noting how they carefully wove and twisted the coconut fiber ropes between many layers of palms and grasses.
With speed and grace, John performed an about-turn and fled into the sea.
"I grew out of it, no thanks to the quack therapist they sent me to."
With a brief smile and departing squeeze to the shoulder, John stood up and headed for the kitchen to give Sherlock some space and make a cup a tea for them both. He was proud of his flatmate for facing down the childhood fear, but, more so he felt pride in himself for being the one Sherlock allowed to help him with it. Sherlock Holmes, the man who wore a carefully crafted mask of confidence and uncaring at all times in public, trusted John with such a vulnerability. It really was an honor, one that John understood and respected. And if he did spend his next few days off treating Sherlock's case of pink eye every few hours, well, John really didn't mind.
Sherlock sketches most everything he observes in one of his notebooks with hopes that someday his observations will be absorbed into the great body of knowledge treasured by academia. However, he does not sketch or record information on John for fear that men would come to hunt him if he were discovered. Instead, Sherlock prefers to commit all details of John to memory, where they are safe and treasured.
"Good evening, John," Sherlock said when he heard John come in. He was seated at the kitchen table, looking through his dissecting scope. He was still dressed in his pajamas, but his hair was immaculately in place and he looked good. As usual.
John looked up at him. "Did something happen when you were young?"
"I don't recall," Sherlock answered curtly from where he was flopped on the couch.
Sherlock's blinks continued, causing John to smile a little more. He had seen Sherlock do this before when he was presented with new information that seemed to disagree with previous observations. John reached for Sherlock's free hand, gently unclenching his fist so he could hold Sherlock's sweaty palm.
, he thought, that's what he was hoping for.
"Alright," Sherlock responded.
John moved him away several inches and shifted such that they were at eye level. In the dim light, Sherlock could see John's expression had softened. His eyes were tinged with sadness, remorse, but most of all,
"You're welcome," Molly replied with a smile. They sat in companionable silence for several minutes and the conversation of the others in the group slowly built to the previous levels. It was quiet in the cave, save for the collection of voices, and the sounds of the storm raging outside.
He slipped his own pajama bottoms and pants down to his knees, freeing his cock, then kicked them off with his feet. Before he could get back to Sherlock's pants, the detective had slipped out of his pajama bottoms and pants together and cast them onto the floor next to the bed. John wanted to
John brought two mugs to the table, placed one by Sherlock, then sat down in the chair opposite, setting his own tea down and reaching for the newspaper. He noticed, of course, that Sherlock always brought the paper up for John to read, even on days he was far too busy to do much else.
"And?"
The detective pushed open the door, his form just a shadow in the darkness.
John's bed was rather small for two grown men, so in order to keep a bit of space between them, he was pressed back towards the cold wall, the edge of the duvet riding up to let in the draft of the room. He wiggled a little, trying to get comfortable, trying not to wake Sherlock. He inched away from the cold wall just a little. Then he inched a tiny bit more, closer into the warmth of Sherlock's back. The duvet settled behind him, blocking out the cold room.
Sherlock had found great pleasure and pride in building a simple 1-room house where he keeps his meager belongings. He constructed the round grass walls and palm frond roof in imitation of the dwellings he saw in the Islanders' village, using the plant fiber ropes they had so generously given him. Though the grass house is just large enough for him to lay down inside, he prefers to sleep outside adjacent to the lagoon and beneath the low canopy made of sail cloth. He finds the closed space of the windowless room disagreeable, and he struggles to remember how ordinary he once found the stuffy parlors and classrooms of his former life.
John was in surprising proximity at the edge of the water. Though his features were not clear in the early dawn light, Sherlock could tell John's octopod eyes were wide in surprise, his octopod skin inky and almost black. He had undoubtedly just observed the rather private moment. Sherlock gasped in chagrin and in an uncharacteristic act of modesty quickly covered his softening member from John's intrigued stare. Surely, John must understand the coital actions of human men? Why did his facial expression convey such... shock? Disgust? Embarrassment? Was he offended at the utterance of his name? Did he disapprove of Sherlock wasting his own seed in this way? Did John always watch him in his sleep?
"How often must that happen?" Sherlock asked.
And then she shall be a true love of mine."
The waves finally subsided as John maneuvered the boat, now half swamped, into the lagoon and farther into the shallows. Without fanfare, John beached the canoe and they were immediately approached by a group of 5 women, all middle-aged, clad only in cloths around their waists. Sherlock climbed on wobbly legs from the boat into the knee-deep water and looked towards John with uncertainty.
Molly looked to the sea, the pre-dawn light still dim on the horizon. "I must go now, and return to the village before the sun rises." With one last gentle smile, she turned and left, and did not look back.
Sherlock timidly regarded his new company. They smiled welcomingly at him and spoke several words, but then returned to conversation among themselves. As with the group at the beach, he was surrounded by women of all ages, from near girls to old women, grey and wrinkled. Many sat with small children on their laps or infants clutched at their breasts. They all had the darkly colored skin, heavy build, and black hair that characterized the inhabitants of the island.
"Goodnight, Sherlock."
"Alright," John responded, he was being as delicate, yet direct, as he could. "I am concerned because you are clearly more than just uncomfortable about this. You are almost in full blown panic. Take a few breaths with me."
Sherlock huffed in frustration. "This is so stupid. Why am I like this?" he blurted out in a raised voice.
"Sherlock, mate, what're you doing?"
"And you say I belong to him?"
Taking his time, John worked Sherlock open. When he finally brushed over his prostate, Sherlock hummed loudly. John's erection had calmed slightly from the concentration of preparing Sherlock, but the sound of his partner's arousal brought him back to full hardness.
Feeling chastised, Sherlock looked back towards the fire. "I apologize, but thank you for telling me so much. I am very curious by nature, I meant no disrespect."
John Watson wanted all those things. But he wanted them to come about consensually, not from lust spawned by some caring gesture in the dark of night.
"Yes," Sherlock replied, "yes to all of it."
, he thought.
talk. I am a very good doctor and I care about you very much. Sometimes traumatic things happen to people that lead to very strong fears and anxieties. You didn't do anything wrong and the way you're feeling right now is not your fault."
John's back was turned so he didn't see the brief flash of anxiety in Sherlock's eyes when he glanced up as John went to make something for breakfast.
"I'm sorry if I woke you Sherlock. I'm alright. Just, you know..." he trailed off as Sherlock pushed the door open and stepped inside.
Molly stopped just several feet from the canoe and turned to Sherlock. "I will leave you here for Wh'an. Take good care and be well."
*****
Back in Sherlock's bedroom, lit dimly by the lamp on the nightstand, John led him over to the bed and pulled the covers away. Sherlock laid down and as soon as he rested his head on the pillow, his eyes closed, the tension left his body, and his expression settled to one of quiet repose. He looked almost angelic in the dim light of the room, his raven curls spilling over his forehead, accentuating his angular features. John pulled the duvet up over his sleeping flatmate and listened as his breathing evened out. He switched off the lamp, walked quietly from the room, and closed the door behind him. He left it open several inches, though, so he could hear if Sherlock got out of bed.
As usual, Sherlock was already up the next morning when John came down from his room. He was lying on the couch still in his pajamas reading one of John's medical journals. A brief word of good morning, two cups of tea, and when John went to sit in his chair and read the newspaper, he caught sight of Sherlock's eye. It was worse than the day before.
He jerked awake, upright in bed, a shout just on the tip of his tongue. Car headlights flashed over his darkened bedroom. The flat was still. Quiet.
This time, when he shuffled back, Sherlock let him go. John slipped out from under the covers and sat on the edge of the bed briefly. He stood up, feeling his shoulder stiff as usual. He gave Sherlock a gentle smile over his shoulder as he left, not yet ready to turn and face his flatmate while he was sporting an obvious erection. He wanted desperately to clear the tension between them. He wanted to wake up in bed next to Sherlock, to have a lazy lie-in, to show Sherlock how much he loved him.
Sherlock stared at John, still mid-chew. The bridge of his nose wrinkled and he blinked rapidly as he obviously tried to remember. "What happened? What did I do? Did I say anything?" he demanded, looking around the room in alarm.
The doctor churned the case over in his head. The crime started as a theft, then went wrong and ended in a brutal double murder. The Yarders were ready to condemn the worker who had been painting the flat downstairs. Though the man had confessed, the crime didn't seem to add up. The real killer, Henry Booker, was a university drop-out, desperate for money but couldn't hold a job. Booker was a loner and also probably quite brilliant, who knows what he could have accomplished if he hadn't been so troubled and cut-off from society. Sherlock had taken an immediate interest in him when he was identified as having been at the block of flats that day. Reluctantly, Lestrade gave Sherlock permission to participate in interviews with Booker on three more occasions. Of course, Sherlock finally got the information they needed and together with John had recovered the money and stolen property, sealing the case against the university drop-out.
"No, Sherlock, you didn't hurt me, there's no need to apologize. Let's get you back inside before your feet freeze."
A quick inhale and sideways flick of Sherlock's eyes told John he had just hit the proverbial nail on the head. He reached out, gently taking Sherlock's hand and giving it an unhurried squeeze. He lay still and patient, giving Sherlock the time he needed.
"Classes weren't very interesting and I didn't get on with the other students. Group laboratory assignments were the most difficult. I skipped a lot of classes, and my marks were not very good. Mostly I kept to myself. I stayed in my room, or I went to the library, or walked the city. Honestly, during my first year, I didn't plan to come back."
Sherlock did not reply, which was uncharacteristically rude, as he would often at least give a low hum of either acknowledgement or disagreement when John asked him a question. John transferred his laptop to the side table and turned, looking over the back of his chair to see Sherlock in the kitchen.
Despite John's obvious stare, Sherlock paid him no mind. He went about his business, removing the milk and setting it down on the kitchen table. After closing the refrigerator, he opened the bottom cabinet next to the sink and, with a great amount of clamoring around, took out several pots and pans and set them on the table next to the milk. Then he paused, standing still to regard the items on the table, apparently deep in thought.
Having received the answer he was hoping for, John gave Sherlock an honest smile and let the moment dwell briefly before he sat up. "Alright, let's switch places, you lie here, on the couch. I'll sit on the coffee table."
- stirred his arousal.
"I mean it, Sherlock, the sooner you get those drops in the sooner it will go away. And keep using the drops, even if it clears up, or else it may come back worse."
"I want to help you, but I won't force you. Do you trust me?"
Sherlock had surmised that a great storm was coming and John was bringing him to the Island People. The intense sea sickness and severity of the pending weather considerably dampened the enthusiasm he would have otherwise felt at finally being brought back to see the Islanders.
"See, that wasn't so bad, right?"
"O, where are you going? To Scarborough fair,
"Can we talk about this?" John asked.
John deposited Sherlock on the sand next to his home and then slowly retreated back into the water. Sherlock clutched one tentacle in his hand, just to make sure John understood he wanted him to stay. John did stay, resting in his usual place in the gently lapping waves.
"Was the sleepwalking very severe? I mean, did you ever do anything dangerous?"
"Where...?" Sherlock clutched the sleeve of John's jacket. He looked over the empty street, then at John, then down to the ground. His brow was furrowed in confusion. "Why are we fighting and where are my shoes?"
Sherlock stilled his fidgeting fingers. He glanced up to John's eyes, then away. At length he responded.
"And tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
"Keep your eye open," John instructed as he repeated the motion, the bottle still capped, Sherlock's grip still firm on John's wrist. Finished, he looked down at Sherlock.
John was upset. Angry, even. Was Sherlock not permitted to go to the Island's interior? Had he broken a custom or rule that he was oblivious to? Was John still disturbed by what had happened that morning? Sherlock was quite confused, and a little frightened, by John's strange behavior. Octopoda had certainly never handled him so roughly or around the neck before. But, the friendship and trust they had built between them was strong and Sherlock calmed himself, willing his muscles to relax and his mind to believe that John would never really hurt him.
John was about to offer the 'I'm sorry' platitude, but Sherlock continued before he could say it.
"And tell her to wash it in yonder dry well,
John quietly rose from his chair and went over to sit in the empty kitchen chair next to Sherlock. In the dim light, he could see Sherlock's eyes were half-lidded and his stare was glassy and vacant.
, John thought and fought the urge to smirk. He grasped Sherlock's slender hips with both hands, and leaned in and licked at the side of the head. With no more delay, he engulfed the glans in his mouth. The fit of it against the roof of his mouth was exquisite.
Sherlock pulled out one of the two kitchen chairs, but instead of sitting down, he carried it over to the hearth and set it facing the fireplace. Then, he returned to the kitchen for the second chair, brought it to the sitting room, and set it alongside the first. Finally, he sat down on the first chair, staring intently at the cold, dark ashes in the fireplace.
Please note: The story Molly tells of how the islands were created is loosely based on the activities of Papahanaumoku (Earth Mother) and Wakea (Sky Father) who were responsible for many creations, though not always with each other. Their children include the Hawaiian Islands, some of the Hawaiian people, and kalo, which is a very important food staple. There are other Hawaiian creation mythologies, but Papahanaumoku and Wakea are my favorite.
Sherlock has become much more accustom to swimming in the ocean lagoon with John. He has come to trust the giant creature, who is always nearby and ready to take Sherlock into his secure arms should he grow tired or be startled by a shark or seal. Sherlock feels so safe with his friend that on several occasions they have ventured beyond the relative safety of the reef out into the bottomless blue of the open ocean.
John returned to his chair. He saved and closed the Word document on his laptop, then sat quietly, listening to sounds coming from the flat. Ten or fifteen peaceful minutes passed by and John was nodding off. It was unlikely Sherlock would wake again that night and John was tired. He went to the bathroom to use the loo and brush his teeth. On the way to his room, John stopped by the kitchen and put the milk, now damp with a layer of sweat, back into the fridge. He would leave the chairs by the fireplace and the pots and pans on the table. It would be a good mystery for Sherlock to solve tomorrow.
And then she shall be a true love of mine."
The noise from the kitchen had quieted by the time John finally got out of bed. He came downstairs and glanced over at Sherlock hunched over his dissecting scope at the kitchen table. Without a word, John continued to the bathroom to perform his morning routine then returned to his room to dress. When he came down the stairs for the second time, fully dressed and ready for the day, Sherlock was still at the scope.
"John?" Sherlock's voice was low and croaky, but the slight waver betrayed his confusion.
Sensing his discomfort, or perhaps feeling his slight shivers, John began to move and Sherlock was surprised when he felt the swimming motion transition to shuffling as John reached the beach much sooner than he expected. He had thought they were farther away, but perhaps John had simply planned to bring him back all along so he hadn't taken Sherlock that far out to sea, but was instead moving parallel to shore.
"Only when I was quite young. It was a childhood phase and I grew out of it. Telly?" Sherlock reached for the remote controller to switch something on. He seemed very uninterested in continuing the conversation. He was right, it was probably just the stressful case, just sleep deprivation.
Sherlock didn't respond.
Their morning had proceeded normally until John left to attend to some errand. A gentle rain began to fall and the sound of the drops falling on Sherlock's sailcloth roof were so soothing that he indulged in a late morning nap.
Probably not direct enough. Also, from the swelling around the lid John could tell it wasn't good, so that was an "obvious" question that he shouldn't bother with. Better cut to the chase.
He was thinking it was probably time for him to head upstairs to bed when he heard the door to Sherlock's bedroom abruptly open. The barefoot detective, dressed in his pajama bottoms and an inside-out t-shirt, came marching out to the kitchen and went directly to the refrigerator before bruskly opening the door and peering in.
was more like it, but, again, obvious, John knew the answer was no. He was irritated that Sherlock was so blasé about his health. Just a little effort. So many people the world over didn't have access to any healthcare. Sherlock had a live-in doctor. The problem had been diagnosed and the medication delivered, just inches away, and Sherlock did nothing. John regarded Sherlock, reclined on the couch and pretending to read, obviously aware of John's scrutiny.
"Every few hours to start."
in Henry Booker?" John asked, trying his best to keep his voice gentle and unjudging. He didn't want to invalidate Sherlock's feelings, that he felt empathy for a ruthless killer was proof of the quality of the young man's character. "Could... would Victor have loved and cared for him, the way he did for you?"
Turning back to the ocean he saw the unique silhouette that he had grown so fond of. John's broad shoulders emerged from the calm waters, and Sherlock thought he surely had been there waiting for him below the water's surface all along. Without as much as a thought, Sherlock dropped his bundle of notebooks into the canoe and ran to John, gleefully splashing down into the water with his arms outstretched. He had looked forward to their reunion for many days, and finally, he found himself swept up in the strong arms of the benevolent sea creature. He hugged tight around John's neck and felt the tentacles rise to support his weight and keep him mostly dry from the sea.
. John had been just as horrified of losing Sherlock as Sherlock had been of losing him.
John began shallow, then slowly drew the strokes out farther, pushing back in deeply after each. He thrust steadily, yet gently, studying Sherlock's face for signs of discomfort. The dark curls were sweaty and matted to his forehead, his eyes pinched in concentration. He was letting out whimpers of pleasure, gasps and sighs, and John knew neither of them were going to last much longer. He reached down and pulled Sherlock's thighs up, simultaneously shifting himself slightly lower so that he would brush his prostate with the next thrust.
All this time, John simply watched him, per his usual habit. As the flames began to die down to coals, John swam off into the lagoon, submerged, and quickly surfaced with a fish that he brought back to Sherlock. Sherlock gratefully took the offering, cleaned it, cooked it over the fire, and shared it with John. The two friends had a quiet and enjoyable meal together. Sherlock enjoyed the domesticity of the moment and felt increasingly confident that their friendship seemed very much intact.
Just then, a young girl approached Molly and spoke to her in the native's language, she responded then the child gleefully returned to the old lady she had been sitting with.
John returned his hand to Sherlock's cock just as he felt Sherlock grasp him. Sherlock's touch was warm and gentle. He pulled along John's length then reached down to circle around the scrotum, lifting his testis and rolling them along the pads of his fingers. He returned to the shaft and stroked from root to tip, pulling the foreskin back as he circled John's considerable girth and slid his hand back down.
“I do want to,” he says, “but I can’t.”
“I’m always ready,” John shoots back with a grin.
Reminder, this is incomplete and will not be finished. Knowing that, enjoy!
“Alright,” John says, “let’s get that coat off of you, I need to see if you’ve been hurt elsewhere.”
He had an idea about it, but that just made him want to forget it even more. He couldn’t think about someone looking at him like that again. He didn’t want to.
Sherlock grits his teeth, his hands tightening on the steering wheel.
In some sad way I already know
He’s still against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock’s hand on his neck. It feels good, it feels right. Except that it doesn’t, because John shouldn’t have this. He doesn’t deserve Sherlock comforting him, not after…
So I will not ask you
Harry Watson - Yancy Becket
“…four, three, two, one,” Lestrade continues, getting quieter.
“We didn’t know about the poison until later, when the vet inquired about possible exposure. In addition to her seeming unaffected by the loss, my father found the poison hidden in the back of Euros’ wardrobe. When I returned from school, Euros told me that she wouldn’t have had to hurt Redbeard if he hadn’t hurt her first. Of course, I was hysterical, and tried to hit her. She broke my arm, and gave Mycroft a broken nose when he tried to restrain her.”
John wakes, exhausted, at Sherlock’s bedside, hospital equipment quietly ticking away around them. He wakes, forcefully brought to consciousness by the thought that he lost Sherlock to a bullet.
I would not ask and neither would you
The boy giggles and hides his face against Greg’s leg. “Thank you,” he murmurs.
“Shut up,” John says playfully, pushing Sherlock back onto his elbows and straddling him. “We have something important to finish.”
Sherlock dreams of funerals. Lestrade. Mrs. Hudson. John.
“He had consumed a large amount of rat poison, which caused internal bleeding, among other things. By the time symptoms appeared, it was likely too late to do anything.”
Eyes always seeking
Sherlock tenses. John’s brow furrows. “Why not?”
—————————
she says, and he can hear her smiling around it. He can’t even see it and hates it. He hates her.
He walks into the office and finds John’s body on the floor.
“No spoilers, Sherlock!” She plays affronted, but she almost giggles. “You know better.”
,” the computer finishes.
On top of Greg’s shoulders is a boy, about four, with brown hair and grey eyes, and a too-big hat with a Ranger emblem. When Lestrade turns and recognizes John, he grins.
Sherlock slid back into consciousness slowly, a warm body snuggled against him. Not the larger, solid form of his husband, but the small, nearly vibrating form of their son.
Sherlock huffed at John’s interruption, but continued. “Scott was badly injured on a run four years ago and was no longer able to pilot. He’s one of our brighter engineers on the floor, nowadays.”

But he goes, if only to reconcile and end it like a decent human being.
“Infamous?” John asks.
He leaves that for another time. The adrenaline start to fade, and his breathing slowly rights itself. His mind jumpstarts back into analysis mode.
John looks from Mycroft back to Sherlock. “I have a feeling there’s more?” he asks softly. Sherlock closes his eyes, turning away slightly.
And that he does, his mouth suddenly occupied elsewhere.
“I’ll call Greg, tell him only things you can solve from home.”
Euros is responsible for John beating up Sherlock
There’s a small moment of stillness and hesitation before John responds. “Why, Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s gaze narrows. “I did, yes, based on your neural profile and combat history.”
Over time, he opens up a little more. But Mary still feels a certain part of it all has been left out.
“Do we?” Sherlock feigns innocence, “I don’t recall.”
Sherlock smiles brightly, for a few moments. Then he’s back to the lesson; “We could attempt to work in a dip as well, but honestly I think you’ve got enough to be getting on.”
“I’m sorry,” he whispers into Sherlock’s hair. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
Sherlock mirrors the motion as John complies, stepping out with his left.
Sherlock clicks his teeth. “Jim thinks he’s God’s gift to Earth, and the other two seem to believe him,” Sherlock scoffs. “My brother was about to move him before we were decommissioned. Now, there aren’t enough of us to spare him.”
They follow after, headed into the Shatterdome. They walk into a large freight elevator, surrounded by pieces of Kaiju anatomy floating in large glass containers. Supervising them is a small, mousey woman in a lab coat.
John looks away, blankly. “Oh.”
“Sherlock!” he whispers. “We don’t have masks.”
I could not ask you where you came from
“Ah. Well, if I have no choice.”
“Do you know how to waltz?”
John squeezes his hand, a light pressure, warm. He returns it, leans forward toward their joined hands.
And this is dangerous
Another Holmes. Upon second glance, John begins to see the facial similarities, infinitesimal as they seem.
“When I was 6, she was 10, and Mycroft was 13, I begged for a dog for Christmas. It was all I wanted. And I got one. He was an Irish Setter, with beautiful red fur.”
“I’m going to finish the sitting room today,” John tells Sherlock.
Sherlock’s sudden appearance only seemed to make all John’s thoughts slow to an indistinguishable pace, and then sprint forward in a flash of fury and relief.
“I’ll talk him 'round,” Mary tells Sherlock.
“You’re right,” Sherlock says quietly. John cannot look at him. He won’t. He doesn’t have the right to. He does not want to move from this spot, wants to stay rooted there forever.
“Do what?” he bites. She rolls her eyes, both now blue again, contacts discarded on the table next to her. She’s also made quick work of her hair, having shaken out her mahogany curls back over her shoulders.
“So, you’re the infamous John Watson,” says one man. Sebastian, he thinks.
“How is it relevant?” he asks, avoiding the question. John’s not entirely sure what Sherlock is doing, but he’s not about to just surrender information. He’s surprised Sherlock hasn’t just deduced him.
But very time he looked up at the Marshal and Sherlock, he could see this look in Sherlock’s eye, and a slight lift in his upper lip. John couldn’t decide is he was curious, amused, or annoyed.
Her hand feels too light without her gun. But John is not afraid.
She picks up the pace incrementally, not enough to tip off her tail. There’s plenty of streetlight, and John Watson isn’t afraid.
They’re still in bed. The early morning sun is breaking through their window, streaking across the duvet.
“Because we’re supposed to be co-pilots, goddammit, and I’m not going to let one incident keep us grounded. We can get past this.”
John takes only a half-step back gripping Sherlock’s fingers in his own. “Like this,” Sherlock demonstrates, pulling John’s hand along with his as he spins—Sherlock ducks slightly to accommodate John’s reach—then ends right where he started, looking at John.
Sherlock swallows. “That much was obvious, yes. Unfortunately, it is not meant to be.” Sherlock tries to get around John, who just stops him again, hand on Sherlock’s chest.
——————————————————
Up ahead, the streetlight fades. There are only a few more lamps before they end and the streets go dark. John Watson is not afraid, and then she sees it, a telephone box. With a light on inside, and if she’s lucky, a latch on the door. She checks her purse again for some loose change, and finds enough to make a call.
Sherlock smirks, “Fine.”
Because once they’re in the Drift, there is nothing between his mind and Harry’s—absolutely nothing.
Surprisingly, John hears a groan from the bunk beside him. “Why d’you have to think so loudly, Johnny?” his sister mutters, arm thrown over her face as if to block him out.
Squeezing his hand again, John turns back to Mycroft.
“Don’t make that face,” she bemoans, disgusted. “John made a face when he saw me, I told him I’d put a hole in it. I’m still tempted to do so,” she teases, her eyes lighting up at the prospect.
He tackles Sherlock to the floor.
Sherlock smirks, and meets John at the edge of the mat. “This should be interesting,” John says quietly, while Sherlock is unbuttoning his shirt.
“Let’s never do that,” Sherlock says desperately as John reaches into his pants, “And let’s stop talking.”
“Atlas Zeta, ready and aligned, sir,” Harry comms.
None of this is real. His memories of the last few days become hazy, garbled. Like radio static.
John offers a hand, she takes it carefully. “Lovely to meet you,” she says.
“Later, then,” he sighed.
“So what were we doing there, anyway?” John asks.
“Oh, like you know how to waltz!” he calls out.
And then there was Mary. She was good. Excellent, in fact. The best of the bunch, if John had a say. But Sherlock still had that look.
John allowed himself a moment to confirm Sherlock’s existence, and to revel in the proximity, the contact of him—something he could never get enough of, even before Sherlock’s ‘fall’.
John breathes slow, in and out.
Everyone around them is also dressed impeccably. Complex, expensive, colorful gowns surround them, and plenty other suits as well.
The phone clicks, and then the mysterious Sherlock Holmes is gone.
“Is that Yamarashi?” John asks, indicating the beast on his left forearm.
“Yes.” He does not elaborate.
Being back in the suit of armor required to pilot a Jaeger is both familiar and foreign at the same time. Part of it is the new design, but part of it is at the back of his mind, John can’t stop thinking about that last time he was in a Jaeger, his sister died.
By the time Sherlock returned, he had managed the task and was blinking up at the industrially bare wall of a hospital room.
Then the lights went down and, for a moment, left them in complete darkness.
“And now,” said he, “I would like to go over the entire house and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.”
“Right,” John said simply, limping forward.
“Moriarty,” Sherlock said finally.
Sherlock shook John hard, then slapped him across the face, then shook his shoulders (even the bad one). Nothing worked.
“Sherlock,” John reached up with his good hand and plucked what appeared to be a tear from Sherlock’s cheek. “I’m sorry.”
John drank gratefully, though the water burned going down. Somewhere in the back of his mind a small voice murmured something about ventilators. He ignored it.
“He said he would
“Sherlock,” he said, “this is hard for me. I don’t… I can’t… It’s just hard. And I didn’t want to scare you away. Regardless of how you felt about me, I was afraid that would change if I told you… you know,
"Well, that could have gone better," John said, shooting Lestrade a sympathetic look.
“Your chest,” Sherlock said softly, “how does it feel.”
"What's wrong Sherlock," John's voice was soft now too.
“There!” John stopped short, just as a head disappeared into a building to their right. “That’s the pit shaft. He’s going down into the caves. We’ll lose him in there if we don’t hurry.”
“That’s not good,” Lestrade said.
“No,” Mycroft said on the other end of the line. “I don’t think that is a good idea brother.”
“Fine,” he said. “Let’s play your little game.”
She glared and snarled, but did not respond.
"Then follow me sir," he said, gesturing down a hallway with a tired expression. "I'm afraid you have a difficult decision to make and very little time in which to make it."
"No," John was getting annoyed now, "I said it's fine. What are you getting at?"
Sherlock examined the paper closely.
As soon as he reached the top of the ladder, Sherlock was dialing his phone.
“Well,” the doctor seemed not to notice Sherlock’s tone, “the leg sustained serious damage.”
“It was your own fault, you know,” Moriarty continued. “All you had to do was look the other way. Everybody else did. You brought it upon yourself. But you didn’t even mind, did you? You have some skill in combat. I’ve watched you take down men twice your size. But when Seb here had his fun with you, you didn’t even fight back. You allowed him to do whatever he wanted with you.”
"But why?" John asked before Sherlock could say anything. "Why would you stay when all the others like you had left? Why would you want to be alone?"
Molly waited a moment, clearly checking that Sherlock was finished before she responded. But Sherlock had run himself out and now sat glaring at the ugly tile at his feet.
He was shoved away almost immediately and John was gone. Buried beneath medical equipment just as he had been buried beneath rubble and carted off into an ambulance.
Sherlock had never felt such intense rage and hatred in his entire life. He seemed to burn with it. He thought he might actually implode.
Sherlock lost his voice again. What was he supposed to do? He couldn’t take the chance that Sebastian would kill John right in front of him. But he couldn’t… There was no way he could watch that sadist…
He found that one of his hands had moved, almost of its own volition. It was on John’s neck. Sherlock wanted to kiss that neck. Wanted to fondle it with his mouth. But he also never wanted to leave John’s mouth, so he caressed his neck with his hand instead. Then, his hand was moving down, across John’s good shoulder and onto his bare chest.
Feeling angry with himself and frightened that his actions may have endangered their easy companionship, Sherlock decided he would benefit from venturing upland into the verdant interior of the island for the first time. It seemed the perfect opportunity since John was apparently ignoring him. He would also enjoy the exercise and distraction of documenting the journey in his notebook. Sherlock had explored the beaches quite thoroughly, often with John swimming alongside as Sherlock walked on the sand. They had seen in their wanderings that less than a mile down the beach, there was a stream valley that cut a gradual slope into the great hill, and might provide a good place to climb.
John rotated onto his back, turning to finally see Sherlock's face in the dim light. His curls were sleep tussled and beautiful, his eyes bright, his gorgeous bowed lips just begging to be kissed.
John browsed the paper, thinking about what to make for breakfast, but kept an eye on Sherlock because he was a little curious. Sherlock usually engaged with John a bit more than this in the mornings and he was often excited to talk about his work, but not today.
Sherlock's breathing had not yet evened out, but he was lying still and seemed peaceful. What was the harm in letting him stay?
It was all John needed to let go. He leaned in to kiss Sherlock again as he reached into his pants and wrapped his fingers around the firm length. He gave it a gentle squeeze and was answered with a gasp. He stroked up the length and felt a tiny bit of precum moisten his hand. He rutted against Sherlock's thigh again.
Perhaps Fate had just handed John Watson the perfect opportunity. Sherlock was reaching out to him.
"Come on, Sherlock, wake up," John spoke more softly, "we need to get you back inside."
"That's fine, Sherlock," John responded, "I'm not going to pressure you into talking about it. But..." John paused, waiting for Sherlock to look at him. "I want you to listen to
John was simultaneously relieved and disappointed that Sherlock had gotten up and left before John woke and they could talk. He wondered what Sherlock had thought when he found himself in John's bed. Surely he wouldn't remember there was a woodland creature in his own bedroom, so he was probably a bit confused. It seemed, though, that Sherlock was taking his sleepwalking in stride and was perhaps, then, not too bothered. John briefly considered checking Sherlock's room for porcupines, but he was pretty sure Mycroft hadn't been by lately so surely his flatmate must have dreamed it.
John stroked Sherlock's cheeks and chest with his human hands. His suckers moved along his back, gently touching and reacquainting himself with the human after his long absence. The slender tip of one tentacle reached into the garment and pulled it free from Sherlock's waist. Without interference from the scratchy artificial barrier between him and the warm skin of his friend, Octopoda was free to hold Sherlock as close as he wanted. In any other situation, the gesture would have seemed sexual, but this was different. John needed tactile information and took great comfort from the physical contact as much as Sherlock needed to tell John what was in his heart.
"And what, John?" Sherlock threw his best put-upon glance over his shoulder.
Perhaps that was it. Perhaps the eager vilification of the innocent worker, the troubling psyche of Henry Booker, or the Yarders' crueler than usual treatment of Sherlock had brought up unpleasant memories from his childhood. But, sharing his suppositions with Sherlock would accomplish nothing other than to make the detective uncomfortable and withdrawn. John had been gifted the information from Sherlock's past, and he wouldn't wield that privilege lightly. He decided instead to focus on his intent: concern for Sherlock, not a desire to intrude or subject him to a layperson psychoanalysis.
"How did that feel?" John asked. He could feel Sherlock's slender fingers still wrapped firmly around his wrist.
"A long time ago, Sea Mother and her husband, Sky Father, made this island, which we call Uluwehi. They made many islands, including our neighbor island and 7 more that can be journeyed to in boats. Together, they created the people that live on the islands. They made great mountains under the sea, that rise near the surface and provide bountiful home for the creatures of the ocean. Sky Father went away and Sea Mother was lonely. She fell in love with an octopus and they had a child, Wh'an. Wh'an protects his family from the foreigners who come here."
"Right, I'll get washed up."
Molly did not seem bothered. "Yes, his name is Tangaroa, he is a fisherman."
John snapped into wakefulness immediately, his mind racing and heart jumping in his chest.
"I see," John replied. "Why did your parents think you needed a therapist?"
him. John had the urge to get up and cross the expanse between them. To perch on the edge of the couch at Sherlock's hip, put a warm hand on his shoulder, and offer reassurances that he was, in fact, not broken and he never was. John knew, though, that Sherlock would misinterpret such actions as patronizing.
John's head was now sharing the pillow that Sherlock had commandeered. His nose was almost at the back of Sherlock's neck. He could smell his posh shampoo and the moisturizer that he was always spreading on his arms to keep the eczema at bay. There was also something else. Perhaps a faint hint of sweat, or just the smell of Sherlock. It smelled nice.
"What are you doing Sherlock? Can I help?" John asked gently and quietly.
Sherlock. All of him. He grasped the hem of the t-shirt and pulled it up and over Sherlock's head. He pulled off his own t-shirt, noticing how Sherlock's eyes flashed down to the gnarled scar tissue on his shoulder. John briefly admired the pale plains of Sherlock's chest and well-defined abs, sparsely covered with short hairs.
Sherlock sighed. "Yes. I was maybe 10."
It was a challenging climb and Sherlock's heart was beating hard in his chest as they finally reached a craggy rock face where an opening at least 10 yards wide led to an expansive cave inside the mountain. Sherlock was led into the cave where groups of people sat around fires, the smoke rising high to the ceiling of the great cavern. It seemed the great majority of the people had come together here and formed small gatherings of women and men, separately, with children of all ages among them. Continuing deep into the cave, the women accompanying Sherlock indicated him to sit with a group of 15 or so women and children who were gathered in the darkness around the flickering flames of a fire burning in a small barrel-shaped terra cotta stove. After depositing the heavy bundle on the ground at the edge of the circle, he sat facing the fire with his back against it. He still held the parcel containing the notebooks in his lap.
Sherlock hesitated. "Alright, I'm ready."
John sat patiently, waiting for a response from Sherlock, but none came.
Booker never showed remorse. He thought he was entitled to the money of the 72 year old lady he tried to rob. He would have gone free, if Sherlock hadn't been so insistent that Lestrade interview him more thoroughly. As usual, the Yarders and the city as a whole owed Sherlock a debt of gratitude, but had repaid him in suspicion and jibes that he had too much in common with Booker. The implication was, as Donovan said, one day they would all be standing around a body, and Sherlock Holmes would be the one who put it there.
John broke the seal and removed the cap. When he looked back up to Sherlock though, he was surprised to see the genuine anxiety on the man's face. His breathing had quickened and a sheen of sweat had even broke on his forehead. John realized something more was going on. Sherlock was having a potent emotional reaction to something about the situation, he wasn't just being difficult on purpose. John felt rather guilty for feeling angry with Sherlock just moments before.
Still looking lost and uncertain, Sherlock's eyes darted to John, then away. He performed a slight shrug, his lips pressed together in silence.
"May I see?" John asked as he rose from his chair and circled the table. He stood next to Sherlock's right side, noticing the man was reluctant to turn and face him. When he did, John leaned down to be at Sherlock's level, and without touching, he examined the irritated eye. It was indeed very pink, with some crusty discharge at the tear duct. His other eye looked fine.
The weather has shifted. Though it is still plenty warm, it rains heavily for a brief time almost every day. When these downpours occur, Sherlock often sits under his sail cloth, or stands out naked in the rain to clean the dirt and salt from his skin.
John took Sherlock into a firm but brief embrace. With both hands on the sides of Sherlock's head, he touched their foreheads together, allowing Sherlock the opportunity to momentarily savor the smell of John's skin: sea salt and freshly fallen ocean rain. Then, abruptly, John pushed him away into the hands of the patiently waiting women and Sherlock glimpsed the conflicted look in his friend's eyes. Quiet panic gripped Sherlock's chest as he watched John quickly turn and lunge back into the sea, disappearing beneath the rain speckled surface of the strangely placid lagoon. Sherlock wanted to yell, to go after his friend. He would swim out into the deep water and John would certainly return, holding him in the safety of his tentacles as he always did. But Sherlock did not go after John, he remained frozen where he stood, surrounded by these strange women. He watched as the dark form moved away from shore beneath the clear waters until it disappeared in the distance. John had left him behind.
Sherlock looked across the circle to where two young children- perhaps 3 and 5 years old, sat giggling with the other women before he returned his attention to Molly.
Sherlock alternately spoke with Molly and sat quietly, at one point even napping for a short time. When asked by one of the children what he had in his bundle of belongings, he showed her his notebooks. John had taken them all and even included a writing pencil that had been closed between the pages. How fortuitous, Sherlock realized, as he could write down each word that Molly taught him together with the English translation. He was very good at learning languages, but this would allow him to expand his vocabulary with even more efficiency.
After being so high, the two men, breathing fast and drenched in cum and sweat, took a while to come down. John felt his softened cock slip from Sherlock's wet hole. The tension in his muscles began to relax and he lowered himself down onto Sherlock, shifting to the side and feeling comfortable in his arms. The pair snuggled quietly and John felt the wave of fatigue wash over him.
"Delightful, I was quite tired, I didn't get up until near noon," Sherlock responded around a bite of salad. He stopped chewing, and studied John's face as suspicion took over his features. "Why?"
Coming together again, the kiss continued. Slow at first, then John licked along the cupid's bow and pressed his tongue between Sherlock's lips, which Sherlock parted to give him entry. John licked into his mouth, feeling the softness of his tongue, mesmerized with this new part of Sherlock. As the kiss became more heated, he framed Sherlock's face with his hands and gracefully turned them over so Sherlock was underneath him. He continued to lavish attention on Sherlock's lips, the beautiful curls of his hair between John's fingers.
"Alright," John responded.
By the time John was done in the loo, Sherlock had a plate prepared for him and the salad out on the coffee table in the sitting room. The two flatmates sat in comfortable silence and tucked in to their dinner. John was very hungry, it had been a busy afternoon and he hadn't anything to eat since lunch.
No answer.
Without delay, John reached forward, bottle inverted, and squeezed. A single drop fell from the tip, landing on Sherlock's sick eye. The detective flinched and made a quiet sound of surprise, pressing his head back into the couch pillow, both eyes clenched shut and forming the wrinkle across the bridge of his nose. He opened his eyes, looking to John with an expression of disbelief, blinking rapidly as if he was surprised something more awful didn't happen.
John seemed more nervous than usual, carrying a certain energy that made the atmosphere somewhat uncomfortable. Sherlock chocked it up to residual awkwardness from their tense exchange the evening before. John had been rather rough in his treatment of Sherlock, and the human had several circular red markings on his chest and neck to show for it. They were just burst blood vessels beneath the skin where John's suckers had gripped too firmly, there was no pain, Sherlock was not angry. He knew John felt remorse for it, as evidenced by the way his octopod eyes glanced down more than was customary when they sat together on the beach.
Understanding seemed to dawn on Sherlock and he glanced around the street once more, then his feelings quickly turned to embarrassment. "I'm sorry, John. This hasn't happened in ..." he didn't finish the sentence. "Did I hurt you? I didn't realize it was you."
Savory sage, rosemary, and thyme,
Sherlock was roused from sleep by wet hands bracing at his shoulders. He opened his eyes to see John towering over him, his octopod eyes dark with anxiety. He hoisted Sherlock from his bed so quickly that Sherlock was momentarily dizzy, and carried him straight to the water where he placed him in a canoe. The craft Sherlock found himself sitting in was quite a bit larger than the last that John brought to him. It was outfitted with a single outrigger and multiple seats so it would fit at least 6 men.
"Were you dreaming?" John asked the next day as he sat down in his chair in the sitting room.
came up to John's room. Well, that he knew of. What now?
Sherlock listened attentively as Molly described the Islanders' customs and the details of her daily life. He learned they placed great importance on making offerings to Wh'an. They left special foods, flowers, ropes, fabrics, and occasionally traded goods from the sailing ships. The bounty of sail cloth that Sherlock had used to build his shelter had been a special gift. The offerings were always placed in a canoe and left at the point of land east of the village before sunrise.
Sherlock admitted to himself that this was not the first time he had allowed himself to indulge in several improper dreams and fantasies involving his companion. John would understandably be appalled if he could see what was inside Sherlock's heart and mind, perhaps that is why John had fled with such haste. That morning, Sherlock decided that such urges and fantasies were a danger to their friendship, and resolved to suppress or better conceal such feelings. But perhaps it was already too late.
"Hello," she repeated. "My name is Molly."
"Goodnight, John," Sherlock whispered.
In a low, quiet voice, John began to sing.
John paused as Sherlock seemed to process the words. He looked down at the saline eye drops in his hand, stroking his index finger around the cap where the ridged texture of the edge met the smooth dome of the top.
"I don't always see the good in people, I don't have a lot of friends," John went on. "For a while, after I got back from being deployed, I didn't want to be around people much at all. It's hard to go through that and still have much faith in the world. But then, you know what happened? I met you. You're charismatic. People like you. You always see the
He kept gently trying to soothe his flatmate, but despite the passage of several minutes, Sherlock was still inconsolable. John considered whether he should try to wake Sherlock. Speak loudly to him? Turn on the lights? But what was the sense in interfering? Sherlock's brilliant mind was working through something, and he was safe here in his room with John. It was better to leave things be.
Sherlock leaned back from the side of the boat and returned his focus to the multiple verdant peaks of the neighbor island. He could feel the adrenaline pulsing through his veins, his muscles quivering and weak. Breathe in. Breathe out. He clutched his collection of scientific notebooks, wrapped in a heavy linen shirt, against his chest with one arm and held tight to the side of the canoe with the other. The sky was dark, despite that it could not be much past midday, and a strong and steady warm wind blew from an unusual direction. Another wave broke over the bow, spraying Sherlock with more salt water which ran down his already wet chest to join the sloshing puddle in the bottom of the canoe.
"You are not defective, Sherlock. You have an anxiety and you're doing really well facing it. I'm not going anywhere. I want you to take as much time as you need."
Here, though, Sherlock is not lonely because every day he has the company of his one true friend, John. John is the singular specimen of
"Can you tell me more about Wh'an?"
John had to run out to do the shopping, so he picked up the prescription erythromycin eye drops that Sarah, his colleague at the clinic, had called in for Sherlock. When he got home, Sherlock was back at the microwave, preparing another batch of samples to examine under the dissecting scope.
"Beautiful," John whispered, then he settled back down onto that perfect body, reveling in the sensation of finally being completely bare and pressed together.
"Have there been others that 'belonged' to Wh'an before?"
John was torn between savoring the moment and extricating himself from the situation as quickly as possible. He wanted badly to lean forward and kiss those perfect lips. His reason won out and instead he brushed the curls away from Sherlock's forehead, running his fingers through his hair to gently hold the back of his head and angle it down for a chaste kiss on the forehead. "You're welcome, Sherlock."
Sherlock quieted somewhat as he listened to the lyrics.
"Yeah, sure, whatever you want," John replied.
, a magnificent half-man, half-octopod sea creature. John rescued him from certain drowning and brought him here to this deserted island. John brings him goods pilfered from sailing ships and items given him by the people of a neighbor island who revere John as their protector. John has not taken Sherlock back to see the Island People, instead, keeping him solitary, but lavished with attention and well cared for. Each day, John brings him a new fish which Sherlock sketches carefully in his notebook. On days that Sherlock builds a fire, he cooks the fish, and him and John eat it together. On other days, Sherlock subsides on fruits picked from the trees and root vegetables that John brings him from the Island People.
Sherlock processed that information. "Are there others like Wh'an?"
Like a bucket of ice water, the words suddenly seemed to reach him and Sherlock froze in place. The street fell quiet except for the sound of their heavy breathing.
He slid off Sherlock's length with a pop and looked up at him. If Sherlock looked delicious and debauched before, he was irresistible now.
The younger man's reaction was immediate. Sherlock's eyes flew open with a shout and he grabbed the base of his own cock, holding it firmly. John backed off just a little bit, but he continued stroking at Sherlock's insides, letting himself go little by little as he felt the familiar tension start to build in his abdomen. He felt Sherlock tightening around him. Close.
He might as well just go with it, though. Sherlock had already made himself comfortable in John's double bed with the pillow beneath his head. He lay facing the room, John pinned between him and the wall. It felt secure, actually, being between Sherlock's warm, solid body and the wall.
Now, the murderer was in custody, ample evidence had been documented and organized to get a conviction while exonerating the workman who had been framed for the crime. All the proper paperwork had been completed, signed, and filed. John and Sherlock headed home to Baker Street, stopping by the Chinese restaurant at the corner for a satisfying dinner on the way.
"Oh yes, John," Sherlock panted. "So good..."
Sherlock sat on the coffee table, now their positions were reversed. John held out the bottle of saline eye drops. Sherlock just stared. John removed the cap from the bottle and picked up Sherlock's hand, putting it between his fingers. He laid his head back, looking up to the ceiling.
"The fact that you're sleepwalking isn't terribly worrisome since you already have a history of the behavior. But I am concerned that you tried to walk down the street. You have no idea where you were headed?"
John pulled Sherlock forward and gave him a chaste kiss on the forehead. "I'd like that, too," he whispered. John wanted to kiss the beautiful lips that he knew were
Sherlock did as instructed.
John reached forward, firmly holding Sherlock's shoulder. He wished he could see his eyes. But, maybe that's what made it easier to make confessions under the cover of darkness. It was the false sense of anonymity. The belief that it's easier to walk back on truths uttered in the dark.
Baker Street below was still and dark. John glimpsed the coat-clad figure of his flatmate moving briskly along the sidewalk: hands in his pockets, head down, hurry in his step. John glanced at the clock. It was shortly after midnight. He got the distinct feeling something was amiss. He quickly pulled on a t-shirt and descended the stairs to the sitting room. He grabbed his shoes and coat and continued downstairs.
"Oh, that smells lovely. Do we have angel hair?"
Sherlock's life in England had been very lonely. As a boy, he had no tolerance for the inane trivialities and games of the other children. In school, he belonged even less, the teachers despised his cleverness and unwillingness to sit quietly when he was far wiser than the lot of them. In adulthood, many sought his company but were turned away by his unstoppable honesty and desire to prove to all that he was the most intelligent man among them. He was an embarrassment to his mother and father because, though he was an eligible bachelor, he had no interest in the fairer sex. He had no ambitions and no friends or companions to speak of.
So, Sherlock made preparations to undertake the journey. The moon had been rising early and was very full, so he was not concerned with disembarking so late in the day, as long as he returned to the beach by dark, he knew he could make his way. He put on his old trousers, which were now frayed very short and really quite in need of mending, and tied the knife that John had given him to the waste. He ate and drank enough to sustain him for several hours, though he was confident he could find freshwater and fruits along the way. He covered each foot with thick leaves and a portion of sailcloth, tying the layers into place loosely with a length of plant fiber rope. Satisfied with the design of his improvised shoes, he took them off to carry with him down the beach until he ventured up the craggy rock streambed. He also carried with him a notebook and a pencil.
There are many wonderful things on John's island to occupy Sherlock's time. He has spent much effort cataloging the plentiful species of plants, birds, and creatures in the surrounding waters as well as constructing detailed maps of the shore and surrounding lagoon. If he follows the beach to the opposite side of the great hill, he can see where the Island People live. The larger neighbor island is crowned with numerous, tall peaks. Sherlock has yet to venture high into the interior of his own island, but when he does, he hopes to see from the higher vantage point if there are any more neighboring lands.
"Yes," Sherlock replied as he reached into the pantry cabinet and shifted some boxes around on the top shelf, undoubtedly looking for the angel hair. He was doing it in that way he did most things. He knew he was attractive and even looking for a box of pasta it showed. John loved it. Yeah, he should definitely consider having a talk. Eventually. But not tonight.
