Moving through the halls, Steve kept an alert eye out - just in case any hydra agents had slipped past the first sweep. “Running with my pack isn’t much of a place for an omega,” he warned. “We don’t have heat rooms or products for it.”
"Nope. Let's get you warmed up. Sparring with Rhodey will help. I know a few boxers that could keep you in good form too," Maria kicked his ass for the next few hours while Tony already missed her.
That is a great birthday and no matter what anyone says those fireworks are yours. It’s your birthday, and you’re enjoying them, they’re yours. Throw those kids up Shits creek without a paddle. I just hope you were exaggerating about 24 kids.
Alas! My dread plan to stop you from enjoying the painting has failed. However shall I face the rest of the League of Wicked Men when they learn of my most egregious defeat? My name shall be blacked out from their books, and I shall be forced to wander in the wilderness of the Borough alone. All because of your victory. Woe is me.
Nibbling her bottom lip, Serena gazed up at the blond through her eyelashes. “Tony introduced me to two of Steve’s murals earlier today. If you ever have the time, I would be glad to show them to you too. But… apparently, this bar features a mural by him too.” She finally really looked around, noticing how the mural wrapped over literally every single wall. “Oh my… Tony. This is … The entire thing was him?”
Tony pulled out the exploded view of a watch he’d drawn in the midst of a trip. He double-checked it for parts that wouldn’t be available in Grant’s time and adjusted a few lines. Checked again for any dates, which there were none. It was a small enough drawing he didn’t need to fold it. A rewrite of the letter in ink and Tony wrote R46S for the address before setting the envelope in the box.
I am trying to find information that I can use to get Obie at least off the board. But I am not having any luck finding anything I can present to the authorities. Nothing I can even present to the board. I have no evidence besides the fact he has been messing with my head for years. My parents are dead, and I saw the fucking wounds. But by now their bodies are so decayed it’s just my testimony with nothing to prove it. I would probably be pacing and ranting this at you sweetheart, and I feel the need to apologize about that.
“Perfection, Stevie. Is it alright if I move the sheets around a little for a better aesthetic?” Arnie took a slow step towards the bed but waited for permission before moving to adjust the bedding. By the time he stepped back to the board once more, the sheet was still tucked under Steve’s hip on one side. But the other side spilled off the bed in a dramatic swath. The fabric gathered neatly low on the blond’s back, showing the small dimples there, and cut asymmetrically across his thighs. With his head resting on his crossed arms, Steve’s back was twisted into a rather lovely arc that led down over the hill of his hip and along the slope of his legs. Even his toes were slightly pointed from how he had stretched, enjoying the sensation of it in his muscles. “Now just… stay there,” Arnie commanded.
The art historian was easy to recognize; Tony had been certain to thoroughly vet her before agreeing to let her show him around. She was petite with a thick cloud of tight curls swaying around her head in the gentle breeze. Her clothing was oversized, making her look even smaller than she already was, and her large, circle-framed glasses served to hide most of her face. But, a genuine enough smile graced her lips as she held out a small hand, “Dr. Stark, it’s a pleasure,” she said, her voice curling with a distinct Haitian lilt.
“Again, that heart of yours Jarvis,” Tony murmured softly before taking a slow sip. He let out a soft hum at the taste before stretching out carefully on the couch. “So I think I need to start distancing myself from him. I’ve never let him in the lab, but I have shown him projects. Maybe I should slowly start there.”
As the pair moved to answer Lee’s commands, the brunette pulled Steve back over to the couch. “How has your art been going?”
“Better,” Bucky bragged. Moving over to the tub, he set the water running before moving the wood counter to the floor. “Becca did. And you know she’s got a gift with it.”
Mostly it's getting seen with a bunch of women. And such. I think that might help. Uphold a 'wild party lifestyle' Haha. You know I am shocked a few things haven't made it anywhere.  I think I want to just have some tea with Lee, and maybe add a splash of Vermouth instead. That would be nice.
Tony woke up alone. His erection had died down, and Ty had cleared out. “Never was cuddly just, I was already as close as a person could get you know?” was what Ty had told him once. As of yet there wasn’t any indigestion at least. Tony looked at the information Friday was displaying on a blissfully dark setting. It was definitely a morning where he empathized with Grant’s sentiment: just leave him in the dark to hibernate.
Losing time whether it’s to liquor or sleep is bullshit. The only thing that comes from them is attempts at damage control. I’ve lived it. It sucks. I’ve thought about hibernating the winter away like a bear, but I can’t quite do it.
Pepper was a little quiet so far - thoughtful as she held the box with her gift. A small smile tugged her lips. “Sure, Mr. Stark,” she teased softly. “For once, everything actually is all about you.”
“Don’t have much of a choice if I want to go home, do I,” Steve teased. He flashed her a smile over his shoulder. “It’ll be fine. People wash and dry.”
There are people I know in the scientific community looking into the sort of difficulty you’re describing. How the letters kind of swim around for you. The one used in comics is a kind of font that has proven easier to read. I could write to you like this instead if you want on a more regular basis.
But still! Can you believe it? And if I do well enough, they said they should have more murals for me to do around the city. They are trying to get more up before winter hits, and I told them I would be happy to do as many as they wanted me to. Just one mural pays well enough for my rent, groceries, and a little extra to set aside. If I could do them regular, I might be able to get more art supplies - paint and chalks and such.
I sort of wished Bella had stabbed the guy. Violence is not the answer, but being robbed of your mind is something I would probably want to hurt someone over. That said, “What knife?” and watching the light die from that man’s eyes for a moment was visceral.
“Nah, consider it a fair trade. I get your photo, and you get directions!” With a laugh and a wave, the man started off down towards the beach - camera in hand.
“Malibu, you’re very obviously a Brooklyn boy,” Tony replied with a little chuckle. He glanced out in the night and squinted. He tried to focus on that and not how great Steve smelled. “Can’t escape the accent.”
The picture was a result of a trip to our park. While I was sketching, I noticed a raven stealing a chucklehead’s watch right out of his pocket. And something about that bird just reminded me of you. Maybe it was its love of shiny things, or maybe it was how excited it got over being so clever. Either way, I could have sworn you were there in the park with me. Old coot never even noticed the bird getting away with his watch. He deserved it, with what he was going on about.
Her eyes widened. “The ginger and the other guy were boyfriends?” She gave a little wiggle. “My specialty is queer art during World War II - it’s what I love. This confirms my theory that Steve Rogers was closer to the queer community than official reports would have people believe.” Serena slid into the cab while Tony held open the door, happily bouncing across the seat. “Today is the best day ever. Do you know what kind of breakthrough this is? What it will mean to the queer community?”
Taking his elbow, the woman started for the stairs. “Don’t mention it.” She glanced over him. “So what’s your fella’s name?” Startled, he looked up at her. “The walls are thin. Not many secrets live here.”
When Bucky came home from work that day, he had stopped past the Barnes family hellhole to take the quickest shower possible - a newfangled thing he had helped his father install to replace the old bathtub. He then grabbed a hunk of bread and the pot of soup Winifred Barnes had prepared before heading out the door. A short walk down the hall and a bump to the jamb opened the door to Steve’s apartment, which was less than half the size of the space Bucky’s family resided in. It was two rooms crammed all but on top of each other with a set of janky glass doors dividing the two spaces. Moving into the cramped kitchen, Bucky sighed at the absolute devastation that reigned throughout the space. Steve had clearly forgotten to take down his laundry, as it was still strung on lines throughout the kitchen. There were dishes piled on the postage stamp table in the corner and on the chunk of wood that served as a counter across the top of the tub. Honestly, Bucky did not even know Steve even owned that many dishes.
“Yeah. Yeah, that would be fun. If nothing else Grant gets some new art references,” Tony pondered as he sank further into the tub.
I hope your trip to Vegas is going well. Is it as bright and amazing as everyone always says it is? Franklin always jokes about wanting to go there, but I am not sure I would like it much. What do you think: should I add it to the bucket list or not?
Tony had been struck by inspiration finally for later when Steve was able to read his normal writing without too many difficulties. So far he had a set of motion trackers on his arm and hand with a pressure sensor under a sheet of paper. It played with the idea that you could scan your writing and put it on a computer screen. It was just a matter of feeding a robotic arm the input to mimic his writing. Hence the pressure and motion sensors. He would be able to write Steve from anywhere, anytime. And look organic with pressure pressed into the paper.
He let out a slow breath and checked to make sure the stall was empty. Then, sliding inside, he pulled the curtain shut behind him. Squinting at the instructions, he read them carefully. First came adjusting the seat so his eyes would be at the right level. It was almost comic just how much he had to raise it; whoever had used the booth last must have been a giant. He then sat down, squirming back into the seat so he did not feel like he was about to fall off the edge. Steve turned slightly at an angle, like the instructions said, and carefully pulled out a quarter. “I only hope this works,” he muttered, still not certain of the technology’s capabilities. Once he dropped the coin into the machine, he could hear it begin to whirl.
He got a text earlier from Pat of 'Happy Birthday.' Then she sent photos that were showing her helping weigh tiger cubs at a rescue reserve.  It was so cute he wanted to burst.
“It’s over in Cobble Hill. And I’m more than happy to give you as much time as you need.” She hesitated. “I will warn you, this one is considered to be in danger of being lost. The city has not allocated money for its restoration, so it is in rough shape. Probably because the lay of the block changed after the mural was completed, meaning it is tucked back into an alleyway. Most people have no idea it is even there.”
Steve wanted that. Wanted to see that. It was a desperate ache, one that seemed woven into the very marrow of his ribcage and tied into the strings of his heart. The love that he promised would never be brought to life threatened to spill out of him; had already spilled out of him in each of the drawings. This drawing, though, had that intimacy that Steve longed to share with the genius; the sort of vulnerability and reverence that could only come from the deepest of loves. And it was unfair, the blond knew, to want such things. He had been the one to draw a boundary, thick and unrelenting, between them after the incident with Ty. To want more almost seemed cruel, as though he were not man enough to uphold the boundary.
But my budget might be able to take some entertainment this month. If you peep your eyes onto the April edition of Harper’s Bazaar, be sure to admire the cover for me. It is really something else. Maybe this month we could try reading? The only picture coming up that we might both like does not come out until the end of April – the new one with Cary Grant. Penny Serenade.
So, Steve found himself seated at a table across from the pair without his usual chaperone. Which brought with it a sort of strange freedom. Because, as much as Steve adored Bucky, the man was clearly not at home among the gay men of New York. He would fidget and let his eyes wander restlessly, as though not certain where it was actually safe to look. Steve hated for his friend to be so uncomfortable, and so was glad to give him the night to recover from a double shift instead of coming out with them for who knew how long.
“Frequently,” Tony answered, looking for the telltale braid Demi usually wore. He found her near a coat rack and tilted her head looking at Tony before she lowered her gaze a touch more.  “Demi, this is Serena, Serena this is Demi. And welcome to Steve mural 3.”
I’ve told you about my nightmares so it isn’t the easiest thing to get me to sleep. So it sounds like we follow a pretty similar schedule. I might be able to figure out something that might make it easier for your back. But I think making it would still be a little rough on funds. Or not but I wouldn’t be able to send it to you properly. There are so many things I want to help with and invent ways to help you. It's frustrating I have to be here.
There must be something about you people want to follow.  Or protect in you. Pretty sure you trigger the Nona instincts too. If they want to feed you that much.
I appreciate you being careful with the picture of Ana and Jarvis since it was from their anniversary. And you are damn distracting too. But we gotta focus on our tightrope walking. We can do this.
“Yeah!” Tony smiled walking to the set and the mats where he had already set up the camera. Beside the mat, Jarvis set up one of his digital cameras in conjunction with Friday. And then the three of them went right into the demonstration.
And your painting is stunning. Franklin’s family is gorgeous. And I’ve got the painting in a frame now. You can’t stop me.
And no, the brows are not right. We got distracted with my shoulders! Groucho brows are a couple steps too far, though. You made me look like I pluck my brows or something; and, I am just not that motivated with my appearance. Franklin, on the other hand, is that much of a dandy. He spends more time grooming before a date than I spend in a week.
Obie would hurt you. I have no doubt about it. You’re good for me, I want to be better around you. He benefitted from my ignorance. He benefitted when I drank and when my father drank. He probably hoped I would die as a child. But I am inevitably going to prove useless to him at some point. If he had some part in my parents’ death, and I was supposed to go with them, he was going to kill me and Jarvis too. And I can’t forgive that.
Tony sent his letter and walked up to see Jarvis, they wound up having a Bond Marathon while the rest of the day bled away.
And writing you back felt vital to me. I didn’t want you to think you were unwanted any longer than I had already made you feel involuntarily. I’m glad I made your day brighter. Your letters have been a bright point for me too. Your sketches are beside where I store my pens and letters; they look perfect on the wall.
Tony winced as he felt his phone vibrate. Repeatedly. He peeked at his phone a moment to see Demi’s texts of “Do I stand a chance she is so pretty! And so cute”
But you are a light to me, Eddie. I am so grateful for you. Sometimes thinking of your letters is the only thing that gets me up in the morning. I hope you are well. And that you are able to find something to bring you joy. God knows one of us needs it.
“Not yet, but I’ll let you know if I need any help. I’m still a little confused about why you and all the other cover models of this year are so determined to help…”
See I would totally make a tea bot for Jarvis, but he has it down to a science with timers for certain blends though his normal one he just adds milk and honey and just leaves the bag in. He inhales it. So you are right. And that is why the bots are downstairs or it would be chaos.
"It was started by my aunt, so I’m familiar with it. She stepped down from the role, though.  Does that make you want to change your mind?" Tony asked with a little grin.
Also his plea in front of the judge that he could keep his child was so heartfelt.  I will repeat, I did not need those feelings.
“Is that even a question anymore, Buck?” He rolled his eyes as Bucky ruffled his hair. “Got a bottle of the cheap stuff back in my room. Probably go through most of it, if I can stomach it.”
“Of course. Just hang on a moment. I’ll walk you to the door, too.” Moving back into her room, she went to her closet to grab the items for Steve. When she returned, she passed them over with a wan smile. “And I know, you’ll get them back to me when you can. Just don’t make me come chasing you down to get them.”
It was definitely a lack of something - self preservation or inhibition, maybe - that brought the thought further detail. He imagined sharp, clever fingers reaching to pinch a little meanly. Maybe the guy would leave a mark where he could reach. Tony groaned imagining it: sharp bony hips against his ass and hair a bit blonder than the sight behind him. It took a moment before he realized he was fantasizing about Grant. Damnit, dammit it was so wrong.
Tony rested his feet on the footstool and pulled up Grant’s letter. Tony grabbed a tablet and started writing away.
And with the war… I believe the bad things that are managing to get out. Living in the neighbourhood I do, there are a lot of fears. A lot of whispers. Some people have been talking of moving out to the country, just in case the worse should happen. Might be a better chance of hiding out there than in a place like New York. Because if there is an invasion or someone decides to drop a bomb, we are basically a sitting target. And that scares folks – with good reason. Me? I doubt I will survive the war one way or another. So really it just seems like a matter of where I die and how.
As the evening oil burned into the early morning, the group finally began to wander off to bed in ones and twos. Eventually, George gestured for Steve to come with him. “I will show you to your room. You need anything to sleep in?” As they started up the steps, the brunet gave Steve a glance up and down.
“Well, I think we can make sure you stay warm,” George all but purred. “Can’t have you freezing while you’re a guest under our roof.”
Finishing his prayer, he turned to find Bucky staring up at the chapel’s ceiling. The building was far finer than the synagogue the Barnes family attended. Well, perhaps not finer. Gaudier, Bucky would say, once they were safely on the path to the florist down the street. Steve attempted a smile and simply said, “Yeah, they sure like their gold leafing and stained glass, don’t they?”
You will not believe the offer I just got. After months of doing posters and little advertisements, the Public Works of Art Project has asked me to do a mural for them. Can you imagine that? My art, as big as the side of an entire building! They are letting me choose my subject, but it has to be American. Whatever that means. I think right now they just want all of the art to evoke patriotism, so we are even being encouraged to avoid what they consider ‘foreign’ art styles. I will find out next week where the mural is supposed to go, which will help me decide what content to include. I will probably have to do a hundred sketches before I get it right. They at least have ways of printing the outline big enough to transfer onto the building, making it a bit easier to go from sketch to mural.
And as a father, if not golden, I will be silver; my grandfather’s hair went nearly white. So we will see. I am trying to be a better man, though times are rough all around Grant. Being away from Ty has helped a lot. Still not sure about being a father though. Maybe mentoring or something first would be better before trying to procreate.
The only real downside to the work was that it left them both so exhausted at the end of the day that they barely managed to eat before collapsing in their respective beds. And, as fortune turned their way, it meant it was more than a week before Bucky was able to sneak down the alleyway near where Rockland Palace used to be. He quickly found the right letter and stuffed it in his pocket, hurrying away before anyone could notice his presence. Steve always wanted to go deliver the letters himself - probably hoping he might chance across his Edward - but Bucky forbade it. After all, if Stevie got arrested, he wouldn’t last a week in a prison.
And yeah you’re right. So just a touch bushier? Maybe it wouldn’t hurt for you to try to fiddle with them, I’m sure Frankie can offer you some pointers. I’m pretty good at occupying myself, be it sketching out designs, working on time travel, or trying to work on gathering evidence against Obie. Also looking for the wayward doctor who had the Jekyll and Hyde incident. Though not too hard on that last one just in case he doesn’t want to be found.
Though, if Steve were frank with himself, he was rather certain the relationship between them would never go that direction again. Sure, Edward was kind to him - flattering even. But a man like that would have a partner equally as posh; someone who understood the struggles Edward’s status lead to. Steve would make a bumbling fool of himself if they found an impossible future where they could be together. It was better, Steve thought, to set aside any thoughts of a relationship beyond friendly letter writing. They would never meet. Never talk face to face. Or hear one another’s voices. And that was that.
Tony nearly fell right on his ass, he stumbled back leaning against the wall to take in the full picture. Them. It was them how Steve had described them when he had gone to Central Park. On a private rainy evening a soft moment where he’d steal a kiss. And Steve had gotten away with it. He wheezed out a breath as his knees gave. This mural was Steve shouting from the rooftops and Tony choked out a sob as he felt his eyes spillover.
And oh my god. I would love to see that painting of Pendragon and Mark. I love ANY spin on those stuffy old pictures; I get so bored of seeing the same portraiture. So having your friends dressed all posh and either looking fondly at each other or even just comfortably together would be such a damn treat. That is the kind of stuff that makes the thing that lives in my chest thrive. I’d love to see them happy. I wish I could forge a document, something that would allow them to marry. A gift like that would be amazing to make, or even just to help someone make.
Tony read it at first with a little smile that slowly sank. He was pretty sure he wasn’t the cause of this little downturn. But he still wanted to pull Grant through the letter and find some way to distract him. He could remind Grant it was his turn to pick the movie for starters.
Arnie laughed a little and pat Steve firmly on the back. “Lee, Carson. This is Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes. Steve is part of the invalid contingent. You two would get along, Carson.”
Trying to decide on a gift for Edward was giving Steve all kinds of anxiety. He knew, without a doubt, that the engineer was wealthy. It showed in the way Eddie casually paid for some movie dates and the size of his garage, not to mention the 1932 Ford Flathead Roadster that was the man’s “hobby” car. Steve, on the other hand, tended to barely scrape by most months and didn’t have a lot of money to spend on gifts for his best guy. Which meant he had to get a bit more inventive.
I've never been the easiest to get to sleep. Nightmares.  Ones that I think would seem crazy to others. I dream I saw my parents in their caskets and they had wounds that even as a child (which I usually am in this dream) I knew didn't fit with the crash. It haunts me.
How bad was the hangover sunshine? I have the feeling that you are aware most of the origins are either Greek or Latin, and because a bunch of scientists worked in those languages. And that sounds like a very pretty bouquet.  I hope you and Franklin ate well.
The next morning Tony drafted a letter to Grant as he waited for Breakfast to arrive with Demi. “You text him?” Demi asked with a little chuckle as she sipped a mimosa.
Her shoulders shook with her laughter. “If you’d like to. I was just very surprised when the director asked me if I could give you a tour since you were interested in World War II-era murals. Definitely not what I expected of my internship.”
Are you suggesting Penny Serenade because of Cary Grant? Because yes. I will happily join you, just to imagine you being a mess over Cary. He’s probably going to be phenomenal. Of course now I forget every book I’ve read. Any ideas Grant?
Bucky rolled his eyes. Steve was such a diva. “I could,” he agreed easily. “But if I did that, I’d also have to write someone a letter. Tell ‘im you died afore you could read what he had to say.” And because Buck really was a punk, he pulled the letter out of his back pocket and gave it a tempting little wave.
“Yeah. I can do that,” Tony answered, putting the soldering iron back in its holder. “I’ll need to liberate another soldering rod in a bit anyway. My hands need the break.” Tony curiously followed and held one of the pilfered handguns.
Of course, those revelations came too little too late as far as Ty was concerned. Whether it was he lost time or whatever Ty took wasn’t helping him, Tony was on his stomach resting with an erection and dreaming of yet another blond he’d never meet or deserve. Tony rested his forehead against the pillow and muttered a forlorn, “Fuck.”
I really like the scent by the way. But for the love of god, if it makes your asthma react. Don’t spray it in a closed space. If you get this please write back to me. And for the sake of your asthma, I am not spraying it with my cologne. Sorry to disappoint.
“Oof. Okay. I am pretty sure I am going to put that money into helping it get restored, and because it’s Steve. Get it moved somewhere it’ll get the care. But alright, have you ever been to the Carlyle? “
Tony stared at the finished Jericho schematics. All that was left was to fabricate, and it was just about perfect Obie calming material.  The math was perfect; the simulations were perfect; and, it would demonstrate so well. All he had to do was keep it handy in case of rising suspicions. Somewhere in the fugue-like state, he had been in, Tony heard Dum-E be the best little bot and put a letter in its home.
Grant. I think Obie is getting suspicious that I am not going out as much. I have this idea that feels like a step backwards but would let him lay off.  It would attract attention at least but my replies to you might be more delayed than I would like.
And Franklin being a judge of anything seems dubious to me. But, he sure loves to eat. As long as it is Kosher, he will put it in his mouth.
"How has the training with Maria been going?" Was what Rhodey had texted him while he was changing for the training. Then Tony grinned mischievously as he grabbed pictures of the times Maria had knocked him on his ass.
Within a week he was introduced to a woman named Maria Hill, who had just been discharged from the Marines.
But anyway I could go on about jetpacks for a while depending on how you want to fuel them and safety. I’d rather read the Hobbit with you. There’s no harm in reading old favourites either.
Well that’s handy to know. I’m glad he likes the mitts. And I did remember that, or I thought I did, about the proportions of your hands. Something about the hands of someone much taller? I am glad I remembered that. And I appreciate knowing that now, thank you.
Thank you again to Anna for the test reading and suggestions. And Welcome to the other group of characters that I was not expecting at the initial planning stage. Twice over to be honest.
For Steve, his love bled into the way he pushed through every illness that came his way with a stubborn optimism that almost made Bucky laugh. He was more determined than ever to live because he had something to hope for - something to live for. It also reflected in the way Steve went on more adventures, just to be able to write to his boyfriend about them. Not to mention the countless sketches the blond sent along with the letters in an attempt to help Eddie feel that much closer to what was being described. He even would send along with occasional attempts at copper artwork, which were often dubious at best. (Steve enjoyed it immensely even if he was not the greatest at it.) To make up for the haphazard attempts, he would also mail the brunet copies of posters and mural sketches he did for the Public Works of Art Project. Steve’s personal favourite was one of Becca, who was dressed in the denim overalls and red scarf she wore when going to work as a riveter. On the poster she flexed and stared boldly at the viewer, showing off her strength, even as the words “we can do it” stood stark at the top of the page.
Just as a note, Tony and Steve do talk about their abusive dads, though it's not particularly explicit
And of course you would favor red. You just love to let everyone know you are there and so beautiful, right honey? I just wish I could see you in all your glory. I bet you look stunning wearing red, especially with your heritage. The art teacher I had for classical oil colors loved to ramble about how Italians make jewel tones look fabulous.
“You actually have everything else pretty covered. Jen appreciated the almond milk. And there was almost enough fruit to make up for the lack of muesli. Thank you,” Demi slowly moved out of the pose and kneeled on her mat.
I’m looking forward to those doodles you’ll make from up there. It’s funny to me, that in all of this, I’ve been the one sending you more art. But it’s fun; it’s something keeping my hands busy. And Grant I will take you up on that suggestion to make Kitt and Grant futuristic. I will also make traffic plans and routes to keep collisions from happening - maybe not this letter though. But I will because if you are planning a new mode of travel, you have got to consider safety. I actually really, really like that idea. Them pinging would help but you have to make sure people actually know how to be careful if something fails.
Tony lit up a little like a Christmas tree for a moment. Like that was a secret he didn’t know at all. “That is amazing, I won’t tell. And I wish I could say I never got caught but well, the times I have been caught, left a mark. Especially when my dad was drunk. Which would lead to me building stuff and tinkering with things which is part of how I got so good at tinkering and electronics.”
I uh, I was going to make it a surprise,  but I am getting a camera. I am changing part of my garage into a darkroom so no one else will see any of the pictures or anything.  Any requests? Besides my face so you can spot me in a crowd. I might do some pictures with a friend who is teaching me more fighting.
“That was amazing,” Steve breathed, as the ending credits rolled. Looking over at Bucky, he laughed a little to find the brunet had his hands over his eyes. “Buck. It’s over. The good guys won.”
I am probably going to love having a snooze with you.  Just make sure to be careful with my nightmares.  But having you around would be great. And I am going to either have a Grant backpack or a Grant shaped blanket apparently, great. Might help me sleep some normal hours or at least a better quality sleep.
And maybe someday Jarvis can have a tea robot! I think I know a fella smart enough to build something like that. Course, he might complain about tea regulations and home traffic patterns… seems like the sort of thing he would do.
“Probably not. But I would know if it isn’t because of your project,” Jarvis gestured at Tony’s math and research then glanced back at him. “I’m a little surprised you aren’t a touch further in that.”
Erskine had agreed: Steve’s fighting spirit had been what allowed the serum to work. A lesser alpha would never have been able to withstand the pain - the unmaking - of the serum.
“A curse upon your house Lord Kitt!” Tony wrote on the back, including a little doodle of himself with a fancy cape and crown sticking his tongue out at the reader.  He tucked everything in and sent the letter with a smile. Tony patted the mailbox before it did its thing, and he looked back at his normal workspace.
I am glad you have steady work, any bit helps; be careful to go outside for your breaks. I imagine your lungs will thank you. I am not sure if we can be seen or even near the same neighborhood, but I would like to see us in the same picture.  Maybe we can see the movie in different theaters and write about it.
Your holidays sounded great. Jarvis makes some of the best baked goods I’ve ever had. I think you’d enjoy it. If I could, I’d send you a bunch of it; give you enough to share with Franklin’s family. And this year I dodged all of the mistletoe, thankfully. I think I climbed a window one time to do it. But I did it. Don’t like the tradition that much.
“Is Grant your complicated relationship?” Demi asked as they watched the credits for the next movie Tony had queued up.
Tony watched, he doubted they’d let him examine the weapons too closely at this point. It wasn’t as if the weapons had opened any kind of portal previously. The only reason he considered a tesseract-powered machine was that it powered devices far ahead of its time. Tony could potentially use it to power a time machine.
I hate him. And I always resented kids who had dads who loved them. Because I thought, ‘Wow, I must be awful. If I were a better kid, maybe my father would love me.’ But instead, he finally decided he was sick of us and left. February 10, 1928. So … February is a bad month to begin with. Ma and I both preferred to pretend it did not exist, you know? And everyone getting all obsessed with Valentine’s Day has just made it worse. I would always try to bring home Ma some flowers for the 14th, just so she had something to smile about.
The hall, which Steve supposed had once been the mess, teamed with life. Howlies moved to raid the larder and sort the omegas into different categories of needs. By the time darkness was falling, most everyone was asleep because of the exhaustion of the day.
And I thought Trina was going to die when she fell. Hit her head and die because that is the nature of my paranoia sometimes. It sounded super unsafe. Also Applejack was like a sweet heavier set Jarvis.
Franklin sounds like he’s great to be around. I am glad you have someone like that in your life. I might think about you curling up around me to help me sleep later. I enjoy that you're so comfortable with me. It makes it great to read your letters.
I also submitted my final sketch to the PWAP office. They said it looks real good and very American. Though I think one of them gave me a leery look for putting Rhodey in there. But I just stared him down. Because America is not just white folks. If anything, I want my next mural to be of a jazz scene, catching the way the community hums with a different energy. And maybe after that I can sneak in some of my fellow artists into a mural, remind the world that not everybody is fitting to marry a woman and have a bunch of kids.
Steve shot the omega an absolutely bewildered look. “That ain’t an accent I’d expect to hear in a facility like this,” he said without thinking. “Were you captured while doing espionage or something?” He checked the room once more before pulling the door the rest of the way open.
Finally, when the tea was steeping, Steve sat down at the kitchen table and pulled the envelope towards him. Maybe Edward would make things better. Pulling out the folded sheets, the blond took a steadying breath. He flipped the pages flat on the table with the blade of his thumb and began to read in the flickering light of his oil lamp.
“Your fella sure doesn’t hold back on gifts,” the brunet griped. “I was sure my arms were ‘bout to fall off haulin’ that through the city. Shoulda made you go get it yourself.”
The fact you are an engineer astounds me. What sort of things is it you build? Though the economy is better than it was a few years ago, things are still so difficult. You must be very talented to have kept your job. I wonder if I have seen any of your craftsmanship without knowing it. What made you decide to be an engineer?
So, Steve was pacing in his apartment, waiting for Arnie to show up with his pen-pal-lover Michael in tow. The blond had asked for the men to come together, much to Arnie’s surprise. Steve would not admit it, but he found Michael’s presence soothing – plus it might distract the redhead from teasing too much. When Steve met the other blond for the first time, they got on like a house on fire. Where Arnie was all flash and flame, Michael was grounded and steady. It created a balance that made Steve feel more comfortable, as it curbed the redhead’s party urges and led to more days wandering museums or galleries. Michael was a math teacher by trade, but it was clear he had an artist’s heart with the way he spoke so thoughtfully about symbolism and beauty. It was easy to listen to him speak in that rich, molasses voice of his for hours as he peeled back the corners of the universe for consideration. He even enjoyed talking science with Buck; the two bandying theories like it was a game of tennis.
“The Howlies have a knack for that.” Steve shot the other man a wry smile. “If you come with me, I can see that you get food and a blanket. Reinforcements are on their way. Should be able to help get you where you need to.”
I know just the thing for Jarvis and Ana, but can you mail it back after you’re done? Also, your references are in here too, Sunshine. Those you can keep. Jarvis does this caramel apple pie that looks too pretty to eat. But it is so good. Got him to make it for the photos you asked for. I promise I’m not spoiled.
Stepping out onto the porch, Steve pulled the slicker tight around his body. “I’ll be sure to, Lee. You two would get on real well, I think. He’s almost as much mischief as you are.”
Steve had been right that it would be difficult to arrange to see the movie. But, Bucky was nothing if not a miracle worker. Well, more like a self-sacrificing idiot. Either way, though, Steve was mighty grateful for him. The pair splurged on dinner at the local diner before heading to the pictures, settling in to watch
Also, I have no idea how to be someone’s fella. The only dates I have been on have been doubling with Franklin. I want to do this right, but I have a feeling we are going to have to figure out what, if anything, we want to change between us. I do not even know how to write dirty letters; would not even know where to start. Just … figured I should warn you.
He hummed thoughtfully. “Probably the bar in the Carlyle. I based it on a concert me and some of my friends went to.” Steve chuckled. “Ella Fitzgerald.”
Happy birthday. I love you so much more than I have the words for, but I hope you can feel it in the gifts I made for you.
I love your comics so much. They are a delight. Maybe you should quit being an engineer and draw for the papers instead. Sir Grant would be the champion of children everywhere. But the adventures he goes on with Lord Kitt... I am sure those would be my favorite. Sir Grant gets a bit lonely going through the world by himself.
“You’ll have to put it to the pack,” Steve said firmly. “I may be the commanding officer, but we work as a team. And any additions have to be approved unanimously.”
And the smell! Steve nearly started to salivate when he caught the scent of the corn dogs and funnel cakes; the popcorn and pies; the hot dogs and clam bakes. It all smelled divine. Edward would certainly want him to spend at least a little of the money eating, Steve was certain. Surely that was part of what the other man referred to as “treating yourself.” And maybe he could spare some money to ride on the Parachute Jump or the Cyclone. Just to live a little. But before he did any of that, he had to see about getting those pictures made. (It just wouldn’t do for his hair to be a wreck in the photos; Edward would never draw his hair right then.)
Is your taste in books more cheerful than your taste in movies? I don’t mean anything bad by that; just we are not having luck with movies so far. I might have mixed up movies because there was something with spies that I thought was a thing. Might have just been a script.
A blush settled high and fast on Steve’s cheeks. “He ain’t my engineer,” he automatically grumbled. “We’re just… pals. Same as always.”
But in his hands, cradled almost like a treasure, was a drawing of what Steve imagined the man would look like asleep. The restless sweep of his curls, tossed by dreams, falling over his forehead. A smooth curve as his neck joined the shoulder. Stubble, unruly and dark, ruining the shape of the man’s ridiculous goatee. Strong, calloused fingers tangled in the blanket held to his chest, a tender gesture that made him seem smaller and softer than he likely was. But most of all, dearest of all, was the tiny smile Steve had drawn on his lips - as though he were caught in a particularly good dream.
“Smart man,” she said with a wicked grin. “When he comes home, you’ll have to introduce us. I am very curious to see what sort of man caught your eye.”
A frown flickered across her face. “Interesting.” As they turned the corner, she gestured to it. “This is admittedly one of my favourites of the time period. There is something so… joyful about it. About four years ago it was actually restored to its original glory, as best we could manage based on early photographs and documentation. We call it the Arthur Avenue Diner Mural.”
Tony shut his eyes and took a slow breath. It was not going to do anyone any good if he started getting horny over this guy's hands at random. “God damnit.” Tony cursed as he finally read Grant describe himself in a meaningful way. Tony added a few more mental details: he probably had lashes for days that might be a little fair. The nose, the nose made him think of a photo he had seen ages ago of Captain America. A shot that revealed this little bend in his nose that looked like his nose had been broken at some point.
Grant if you want me to handle the more raunchy things I will be happy to help. But really I am much more for going at any pace you want to set. I have a decent imagination but we have time. It’s not a race.
I would probably run around to all of your murals and make a presentation on them. If I were there. After I go around on my own first to see them all.
"I will see what I can do. But I mean your art. The costume is marketing itself but you have a lot of talent." Tony explained, definitely making note of the name. He stepped a little closer and nudged Steve with his arm “I’m going to need Arnie’s last name for that. But I’m serious about talking about your art. I want to hear more.”
Bucky blinked up at the clear delight on the blond’s face. “You two are madder than a bucket of cats.” He hesitated. “It’s cute. I’m glad you’ve got a good fella. And that it worked out between ya.”
While they were waiting for help to arrive, Steve began moving through the facility to make sure they had an accurate count on how many omega and how many babies were in the area. He was just about done when he noticed a door that was locked more securely than any of the others had been. Listening at the door, he could hear the hummingbird hammer of someone’s terrified heartbeat and the strange sound of grinding metal. In a moment, he had busted the lock on the door and peered inside the gloom.
Steve had known what it was by the smell of it. The air was rank with terror, pain, and the putrid musk of omegas in distress. He had ordered the Howlies to put on their gas masks, just to avoid triggering any rages among the alphas, and then they went in. It was somehow even worse than the scent had belied. Cramped cells, filthy omega bodies, and a nursery packed with neglected infants. Once the Howlies had secured the base, Gabe radioed for the Swiss and medical teams to come in.
“I worry more about you than myself Tony. I can handle myself just fine. Grant brings out the things in you I had always known. It makes me happy to see you happy,” Jarvis explained as he set his popcorn bowl to one side. “So what did you end up sending him?”
And yeah, the bushiness is right. Wrong shape, though. You have made me look like I am plotting something evil. My ma raised a good Irish boy. I even still go to Mass, even though … Well. I believe in God, but I dunno if He is tied to a specific church, if you know what I mean? Seems like men come in and make a lot of extra rules, things He never did say. And that never quite sits right with me. But I go to Mass because it would make Ma happy. So, uh, less evil eyebrows? Whatever that means.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you. While I like that, I like Tony better. May I have the permission to call you Serena?” Tony asked with a smile.
With a heavy and rather overdramatic sigh, Steve gave in with a quiet, “Fine. But only for you, Lee.”
Making you that guide wasn’t that difficult, I have a friend with a bookbinding machine, and I do my own picture developing. Some bits of affixing combined with both Maria and I writing by hand took a week - since we see each other for a few hours at a time daily. She was happy to have the project. If you could somehow convince Maria to be less shy about speaking to Pepper in regards to her crush we might get somewhere. You getting the shit kicked out of you less would be great. Though you were looking nicely unmarked for those drawings. Mind you, I couldn’t see your knuckles. Would I have wanted to see those?
“Cigs help Buck and Morita with their anxiety,” Steve said in an undertone. “And Dernier and Dugan work for their cigars when we are in places that have ‘em.”
“Yeah, I’m going to have to get this coat cleaned so we’re not walking anywhere for a bit,” Tony nodded making a quick call for a cab. “I’ll see about getting the front desk to send it out before we try heading into the bar.“ Tony gave a quick grin as the cab arrived a few minutes later.
I will do my best to be careful. In theory, it will take me anywhere from two to four weeks per mural, depending on how big they are – in addition to the planning phase. So lots of time to feel tall.
What would it take to make you forget October is coming? You are going to have outdoor work at least with the murals. But I still would like to help with good flowers again. Peonies, Hydrangea and…. Bells of Ireland, was it? So am I going to get another liquored up Grant letter? Or are you hiding the pens and paper sweetheart?
A wireless phone? That sure would be a miraculous device. Our building does not even have a private line, so I can barely fathom how different it would be if people had access to phones just wherever they went. Gosh. What would they even do with them?
Sorry, I have never done something like this before. And I honestly cannot remember the last time I wrote a letter. But maybe you will be patient with me?
A laugh almost slid past Steve’s lips. “I will be sure to tell him you send your warnings. Eddie was pretty impressed when I said I’d met you. He’ll be honoured to have been threatened by you.”
“Naked,” Arnie confirmed. “Shorts would ruin the lines. Don’t worry, Stevie. You’ll be under a sheet. And I promise Michael and I won’t get handsy with ya. Even if you are as cute as a button.”
Jarvis made some wry comment on Tony’s state, he was sure, but everything seemed muffled and distant. Whatever Ty had given him packed one hell of a punch. Usually Tony was able to shake things off pretty well, but he was on a trip that seemed intent to keep going.
“Whatever you want. I’m in an extremely complicated relationship, but we agreed that publicity would be a way to keep the press off the trail. I’ve been into old movies and some kind of pampering since my new trainer is very mean if either of those appeals to you. But I am very open to listening to what you want,” Tony offered as he spun on his stool.
“Well, I have ones that I am looking for. I think they are going to make this far more interesting for you Serena,” Tony nodded as he took her hand and shook it.
Tony sat not even able to snap any pictures yet as he read the Italian he didn’t know Steve knew. He closed his fingers trying to focus on something else. Trying to pull himself together. He was so loved, and that was the crux of it. He was loved by a man the world was going to forget existed. He was loved by a small firecracker of an artist that painted one of the largest love letters he’d ever seen in his life. They were going to paint over this man in colours that he’d dreaded for years. Colours that reflected nothing of what he’d truly wanted.
Reaching down, Tony selected the gift from Jarvis and just … stared at it for several moments.  Finally lifting the corner on the tape, Tony opened the ends and let the box slide out onto his lap. His jaw hung slack as he saw the white lacquered box, and his hands began to shake as he traced the edges of the box reverently. He remembered this box. Tony remembered sitting in the Jarvises’ quarters as he watched Ana pull this box from her desk drawer. For a moment Tony feels as if he’s seeing it in double as he opens the box to see everything as she left it. The Conklin pen in its case sitting in a sectioned-off portion of the kit. Her paper stacked tidily in one compartment, and her little pad of sticky notes in another little section. And a section for personal cards. A portion of the kit still held the tightly sealed bottle of ink. “Jarvis,” Tony whispered, tracing his thumbs along the kit to feel the velvet lining. He felt his chest flutter and sniffed for a moment, trying to hold back the tears. “This was Ana’s.”
Maria is going to love hearing you’ve got Franklin’s sisters learning from the guide. I love it. And the art you did for her!  I think I know just the frame to get for this too. I’ll tell you her thoughts after my training with her.
“I was a bit surprised to find out you two weren’t an item, based on how he hovers over you,” George admitted. Stopping in front of a door, he twisted the handle. “Though I’m glad you aren’t.” When Steve went to walk into the door, the editor blocked the way with his arm. Leaning in close, he gazed down into the blond’s bright cerulean eyes. “Anybody ever tell you how beautiful you are, Steven?”
Still… I think you shouting from the rooftops is going to be my attempt at drawing you this week. I’ve also got some small technical bits I think a flying car would need too.
Tony scrunched his face like he was even thinking of arguing with them. “Yeah okay, I can work with having food first,” Tony said with a little smile. The meal, of course, was absolutely amazing. The cake, delectable. Tony patted his stomach before they moved to the living room nearest to the kitchen. “So, gift time?” he asked as they walked.
I think I will use Sir Van Gogh for the next eyebrow experiment. Anyone you have in mind as being a witch or wizard that would play with your eyebrows for shits and giggles? Or I might just draw Katherine Hepburn. And then try at your brows.
As I said, I am not the best at describing myself. So, I have left another drawing. This time of my hands. My ma always said I had a pianist’s hands, simply because my fingers are so long. Though I am very slight, my hands are rather large; Franklin likes to tease me that I have hands better suited to someone over six feet tall than someone my height. Most days my hands are covered in ink or charcoal, but sometimes I am lucky enough to get a job where I get to use paint. I tend to get it not just on my face but in my hair, which used to frustrate my ma so bad. She would always ask me if I rolled around in my art before finishing it, which I would tell her was the best part of being an artist. For some reason she never found it too funny, probably because getting ink and paint out of clothes is so difficult.
"Yeah me too, sorry about the double booking on your promotion day. Obie was insistent the deal had to be that day. I'll figure out how to make up for that honeybear. Kick ass!" Tony sent back quickly. He pocketed his phone and helped roll up the mats before Maria went home.
When it came time for Arnie to draw Steve, the blond was a bundle of nerves. While his body had gained more muscle after his illness in the winter, he never felt particularly comfortable in his own skin. He was nothing like Arnie and Bucky; they were strapping and beautiful. And there was a corner of his mind that whispered it was one thing for Edward to hear about his figure and another altogether to see it laid out on the page. What if the man hated how he looked?
I seem to keep adding you to every mural I do. Maybe that will just have to be my signature. You and me, caring for each other so much if you only know where to look for it. Guess that officially makes you my muse. Which is why you get a ridiculous little sketch of you acting like my muse. I had to make some guesses about your build, but I figure you have been getting even more toned working with Maria. Something tells me you got real fine gams, babydoll. The kind that would make me stutter. I can only see so much in those photos in the handbook, but I have a strong feeling about it.
I'm sorry to hear the future scares you. I think it becomes easier with more friends around you. I also think moving forward is always worth it. And I think things will get better. They have to. But let me know when you have the funds to see Angel Street.
But they wanted to park the cars higher up. Though the rest of it is actually architecture I really love.
I’m going to see the movie tonight. So you have to imagine me sitting in the lobby scribbling my reaction on a notepad for the next bit.
“Stevie, you still alive?” he called. A shadow in the other room moved, which seemed to indicate that someone was still kicking. And that was good enough for Bucky at that moment. “Jeeze, punk, I don’t think your place could be more of’a mess if you tried. If my ma saw this place she might fall over straight dead.” After setting the pot down on the floor, he began to stack the dishes and clear a spot for the bread on the table. “Ma sent you some more food. She’s worried you’ll waste away to nothin’ if she don’t.” Once the table was clear enough, he moved the pot up off the floor, not bothering to find a trivet since the wood surface was stained with all kinds of things.
My dad was like that too Grant. And it was good ol’ Fucking Obie that provided the liquor. But this is about you.
Getting knit caps to match the scarves was easy for his gift for the guys. It was something he could do. He gets a call and text in December from Pepper reminding him that yes, he did win The Apogee award, Pepper’s already got it booked. Tony attended Rhodey’s newest promotion and let them get soused. He spent most of Hell week in a daze of insomnia and groggy thoughts. How he could get some posthumous revenge if it came to that. How Obie probably sold his parents out.
Tell me something good? Something nobody would expect about you. I want to know the dark and the light of you, Eddie.
And I was sure to pass along your kiss to Lee. She had no shortage of words with George, and I have been making sure Franklin or Pendragon or Mark go with me to February House. Oh! Mark is Pendragon’s boyfriend. They met through letters and only just got together about a month ago. I think you would like Mark. He teaches school, whittles, and loves to sass Pendragon. He is actually quite a bit like if you put my personality and Franklin’s into one person. It is nice.
“Better to find out now,” Michael said gently. “He could surprise you. Want to be with you as much as you want to be with him.” He shared a sidelong glance with Arnie. “Even if it means things being more difficult.”
Before the lights could come on, signalling the start of the photograph, Steve lifted the flowers so they covered the majority of his face. Only his eyes, which were sparkling with impish delight, peaked over the top of the bouquet. He held as still as he could until the lights clicked off, signaling that the photo was complete. Steve let out a slow sigh and hopped off the chair. Parting the curtain, he stepped outside and waited by the little slot for the photo to appear. And, when he heard the distinct little clang of the metal frame hitting the tray, he nearly jumped out of his skin.
I will have you know, I will take great joy in being tall. Something tells me the view will be something else. Expect at least a doodle or two of whatever I happen to see from up there. Of course, it is the Bronx, so it will not be quite as amazing as if I were drawing Brooklyn. But not every borough can be as amazing as mine.
Steve huffed at his best friend. “You’re a terror, Bucky Barnes.” But, he managed to wobble upright and began to shuffle towards the chest of drawers that also served as his art desk. He fought with one of the drawers for a moment before he finally got it to slide open, revealing neatly folded shirts. Steve grabbed one before looking over at the brunet. “You gunna start the bath or just stare at me, huh?”
Arching an eyebrow, Arnie offered his friend a devilish smirk. “You could just tell him: Oh Eddie, I want to suck your dick. Please come to New York and come all -” Whatever else he would have said was smothered by Michael’s hand.
The actual contents of Edward’s letter made Steve’s heart ache. While the man was wealthy, it seemed like he had suffered so much loss. There was an undercurrent of loneliness to his words that made it seem like he had never simply known what it was to sink into a place and call it home. To have a family that was, in every sense of the word,
Scowling at Arnie, the blond brushed past him to unmake the bed. “Edward better appreciate this,” he grumbled.
Grabbing a crumpled ball of paper off the table - a failed artwork - Steve lobbed it at the back of Bucky’s head. “Shut your face. I’m wonderful. He’d be delighted to make my acquaintance.” The brunet just gave Steve an unimpressed look over his shoulder before resuming the dishes. “Says he’s Italian. Ma would’ve liked that. She always loved seein’ that Italian grocer at mass each week. Blushed up a storm when he’d talk at her in that accent of his.”
And I would love to see armor designs for them. But maybe you could do a fusion. Like, Sir Grant goes to the year 2000. Lord Kitt could have a jetpack, and maybe they drive a flying car. That would be neat.
“That would not be professional. And I really wasn’t professional that night,”  Maria replied firmly, before dropping her shoulders. “But doing something like that would be a great project while you’re recovering from this. Jarvis can snap the pictures so Rhodey doesn’t see you being owned again.”
I am also real sorry about your folks. Losing them that suddenly must have been real difficult, especially given the last conversation you had with them. At least with Ma she died slowly and we had a lot of time for our goodbyes, even if I hated losing her. She died of tuberculosis. In some ways, I always wished she went fast so she did not have to waste away. But, I guess there are small mercies in dying of sickness. Sorry. I am not very good at offering comfort or anything like that. If I were there, I probably would have just held onto you. Touch and time just being together can mean more than words, I think.
I’m imagining that and you really are going all out on your vigilantism screaming from rooftops and everything sweetheart. I am so very happy to be kissed. That sounds amazing and believe me especially once I get your face right Sunshine I’m probably not going to think of much else. There is nothing much going on here but you in my head right now. It’s actually really great after the shit week I’ve had. I feel like I think way too much.
appearing in the newspaper cartoon section and how everyone would love finding out what new mischief the little knight got up to each week.
Jekyll and Hyde could be a lot of fun. Science is a pretty powerful thing, and I am real curious to see how they carry out the story. I always wonder if Hyde would have still gone through with the experiment if he had known what he would become. He seems like the type where his thirst for knowledge far exceeds his self-preservation instincts. Or maybe it was something that went beyond that.
