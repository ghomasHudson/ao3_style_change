“It’s me,” Steve says. There isn’t a calendar on the wall or a copy of today’s paper, but based by haunted look in Tony’s eyes, he knows where he is and when he is, which means whatever he’s going to tell Tony won’t be believed.
Tony takes a couple of deep breaths. “I’m just saying it’s worth waiting until we have more Pym Particles. Then we can go back as a team.”
“Yeah, sure.” Tony reaches out a hand to help him up and this time Steve accepts the help. “There’s the one down the hall we have in case Fury ever stays over.” It had never been used.
, just in case Steve’s worried about that. Tony also shows his appreciation by sliding his hand down the ripples of Steve’s muscles until he ‘accidentally’ brushes against the tent in Steve’s flannel pants.
“What can I do?” Steve asked, kneeling down next to Iron Man and trying again to find anything to release the armor.
Images flood his mind, but they come with thoughts stranger and more detailed than the movies playing before his eyes.
“But--” When he finally got the nerve to tell Tony all those years ago, it had been like this. He had been unsure. He had thought Tony would say no, or if Tony said yes, it would not have worked out and that would be the worst thing.
Tony managed to not wince at the mention of Steve’s death. He looked again at Wong, curious at what exactly was so ‘interesting’ about Timely. There had been some strange events over the last six months, but that hadn't filled the town's hollow center. At least, it hadn't for Tony. “I’ll agree that Timely is...interesting, but I’m not sure if it’s interesting enough to justify your trip.”
Tony looks from the dildo to the lube to the full condom box and draws a pretty clear picture of what Steve’s sex life is like. He’s still wrapping his head around the visual when the bathroom door opens. Without looking up, Tony asks suggestively, “When you said you didn’t have a lot of experience, you meant with other people, right?” He holds up the dildo to make his point and gives Steve a couple of eyebrow wiggles to show he’s intrigued, not judgmental.
Steve took my arm and rested it across his chest, above his injury. I curled behind him so that my head was leaning on my other arm and the entire front of my body was flush with Steve's back. He was quiet, and I imagined him lost in a memory. “You're right. It's much warmer here.”
. And watching Steve walk away gives him an idea worth waiting for. “Quick question: what do you think about anal?” he asks, fast enough to shout down every voice in his head that’s confused why he asked it.
“Please, please,” Tony babbles with his eyes shut tight. “Please, I’ll do anything.” He’ll stay still, like the Supreme Leader always wants, if it would just be over with.
But there’s none there to give, no answer, no ending that will fix it, just moments through which he’ll have to breathe. Steve picks up the portfolio case and walks up the stairs to the platform, leaning heavily on the railing with every step.
Tony had a few reasons to doubt that was the case. Maybe it was just a product of Nathan’s advanced age, but he seemed perfectly comfortable sitting across the room. The second was, well, worth confirmation. “I read a file on you once. Top secret. You’re important.” Tony sat down again and held Nathan’s gaze. “You’re Nomad.”
“Want some help?” Tony asks by gesturing to the pizza boxes and cans Steve’s trying to balance in his hands.
Tony blinked, more annoyed than he was minutes ago. Why exactly had Wong invited him over to speak to this doctor, who was not actually a doctor? “What is your name? I’m not sure you told me when I entered.”
One last time, he checks that his Avengers communicator is properly calibrated to the suit. The nanobots glisten through the glass syringe, constantly catching his vision, and he knows he won't understand this when he wakes up. He didn't last time
“I’m fine. And tell Pepper ‘thank you’.” Steve looks to the floor and then somewhere above Tony’s head.
Steve slams his head back onto the pillow. “Tony, if you don’t start fucking me in the next minute, I’m putting my clothes back on.”
“Nathan….” Tony’s mind immediately goes to the history books on that, but the more he looks at the man and the lines around his eyes, he remembers another person he might know. “Peggy Carter’s husband?” The smile breaks in that moment, and yeah, maybe Tony shouldn’t have brought up the guy’s late wife. Tony drops his gauntleted hand in some form of apology and is glad Nathan takes it for the olive branch it is by lowering his arms to his sides and taking a few steps forward.
He was just twisting the doorknob to the den when a flash of blue materialized in his peripheral vision. “Steve--” Tony began to say. His eyes were wide, hopeful, nothing like his earlier attempt to convince Steve who he was, maybe because he didn’t need to.
, Tony thinks, but that’s probably not even enough to change his mind. The Avengers, as a concept, are so intertwined with Steve that the logo itself reminds him of Steve’s knees pushing Tony’s thighs apart while Tony tries to struggle against the hands tight around his wrists. “I don’t think there’s anything. I’m sorry.”
“Incredibly. Top secret. I wouldn’t keep it from you unless I had to.” The hologram bit his lip, and even blue, Tony’s face could be so expressive.
Steve leaned down, rested his forehead against Tony’s. “We’ll talk about that later. Now, I’m just glad you’re ok.”
There was silence in the room. Tony could tell he was being evaluated. Wong spoke up to ease the tension. “My friend has many talents,” he explained. “The one he is referring to is rare and difficult to accomplish, and I have only seen it done once before. It requires the sort of assistance that few are willing to give.” It was pretty clear that this 'talent' had to do with Steve's death.
“Huh?” Steve grunts as he slides down so that he’s laying on the bed again, now a comfortable six inches from Tony.
He wasn’t lying when he spoke to Pepper—they’re going to win and bring back everyone snapped away. And then not a minute later, he’s flying home to hug his daughter.
“Now I see you understand.” Doctor Strange stood up. “Take a little time to think about it. I’ll be here for the week.” He turned away from Tony. “Wong, as always, your tea is delicious.”
Except his fingers stick against the sweat fusing the cloth to Steve’s skin before he can graze a nipple. He stops, breaks the kiss, and gives Steve a severe look. “You’re gross”
and leave Steve’s pleasure as an afterthought. It’s not how he operates. Tony begins to lift Steve’s legs so that they’ll hook over his shoulders, but Steve must misread the cue, because he grips his thighs and lifts his feet into the air. The new position provides Tony a couple more inches to work with, inches that have Steve muttering his name on repeat.
Steve doesn’t say it. Instead, his mouth is hanging slightly agape and his eyes are wide enough to hit the corners of the cowl. Tony follows his gaze over his shoulder.
.” Steve’s behind the door before Tony finishes talking. From here, Tony can hear the sound of water, the rustling of a curtain, and Steve stripping down. He looks around the apartment, searching for a way to keep his mind occupied while he eagerly waits.
“I’m glad you’re one of us.” Tony meant it. Steve was the extra ingredient the Avengers hadn't known they needed. Everything just worked with him around. He got along famously with Thor and Janet and Hank, always cracking jokes at meetings and assisting in the field like he came prepackaged for maximum avenging.
Tony killed the engine after pulling into the parking space in the tower’s garage then turned to Steve in the passenger seat. “Home sweet home.”
He was watching cell phone footage of Tony fighting with Rhodey in his Malibu mansion - before it’s destruction, obviously - on what Steve knew was Tony’s birthday, back when he was dying from palladium poisoning, when his own phone began to ring. Glancing at the phone and spotting
“Yeah. Been there,” Tony nodded. “In the spirit of being your Rhodey, even if you don’t realise until you're in deep, you can still tell me.”
He stopped for lunch, wiping the sweat and soot from his forehead with his shirt and sat with his feet in the pool as he ate a sandwich, hoping Tony might appear to talk to him. No such luck.
“Foggy Nelson, meet Steve Rogers,” Bucky explained. “Steve, Foggy. Foggy’s Matt’s partner. Speaking of, where is he?”
“Time?” Tony asked absently, pretending to bite Ellie’s fingers and sending her into peals of laughter.
Natasha stepped forward, taking Sharon’s hands and squeezing them gently. “Sharon, I’ve known you for three years now. Even if we weren’t together, I’d still be there for you. Because you’re my best friend. And… I like kids. And your kid? I’m going to love your kid.”
“To… give some advice I guess. If I can in a way that doesn’t make me sound like a pretentious douche.”
There was something about abandoned buildings and the way nature was slowly reclaiming them as its own which had long captivated Steve. The beauty of the former grandeur undiminished, merely transformed. There was an atmosphere to them, a lingering sense of the lives lived or the jobs worked within their walls which made him feel oh-so small and yet so alive all at once. No two were ever the same, and he loved discovering little clues that told the story of the people who once called it home or made their living there.
They were lying in bed, facing each other, and Steve looked exhausted but Tony couldn’t sleep and Steve flat out refused to leave him alone when he was coming down from a panic attack. When Tony tried to argue he wasn’t alone because Steve was right next to him, Steve just fixed him with a look and a, “Tony. Shut up.”
When the elevator arrived at the top floor of the penthouse, they headed straight through Tony’s walk-in closet to the bathroom where they began to peel themselves out of their half-dry clothes. Steve grimaced at the cold, wet fabric on his skin, before stifling another yawn. The excitement and adrenaline of the day was beginning to catch up with him, and from Tony’s sluggish movements, he was feeling the same way.
“Uh, we met online almost exactly a year ago. June 26th. We first met in person on July 12th.” Steve smoothed his hands over his pants, hating the expressions of most of the audience in the gallery, soaking up the little details of his relationship that he and Tony had kept out of the press and the public because it was private.
“I think we need to talk,” Steve began, his voice rough even to his own ears. “I know you hate me. I don’t exactly like you either. But here’s the facts: you don’t have anybody else. No one knows you’re here but me. And even if they did, they’d probably want to lock you up in a tank somewhere or dissect you.”
“Steve, I’m sorry,” Tony whispered and Steve could see that he meant it. Tony shuffled closer, reaching out then hesitating. Steve gave a small nod then Tony dropped his hand onto Steve’s arm, rubbing it slowly.
Tony looked up sharply, the smile slipping off of his face. He caught Ellie’s hand as it swung towards his nose, letting her fingers wrap around his forefinger. Steve always marvelled how small his pup was when he saw her whole hand barely managing to encircle Tony’s finger.
“And I’ll be there for you,” Tony promised. “I’ll hold your hand whenever you’re scared, Steve. About anything.”
“You know him? He’s the driver of the other car. It’s his daughter you’re here to help. His wife works at the hospital.”
Steve groaned, his head falling back. “No!” he exclaimed, shaking his head. “You did not just say that. Nuh uh. That is too cheesy, get out. Go on.”
“Like you can wait,” Steve retorted, sinking into the pillows. The familiar weight on Tony on top of him settled something in his chest, all while stoking the flames in his veins in anticipation of what was to come.
Steve woke with a groan, sticking one hand out of his blanket burrito to fish for his phone. He knocked his glasses onto the floor, before finally finding his phone. Steve picked it up, yanking it free from the charger, and rolled onto his back to stab at the screen until the alarm fell blessedly silent.
Then slowly, so slowly, still holding Steve’s gaze, Tony raised Steve’s wrist to his nose and scented him.
“Awesome. I better call Pepper, give her a heads up. Then let’s beat Lady Gaga to 20 million followers!”
The crowd clapped and cheered, and there were even a couple of whistles, which made Steve jump. He glared at them all. Why was Stane talking about Tony as though he knew him? And all those comments implying Tony didn’t care about the Stark employees, or was actively fighting against Stane? The only thing Tony was fighting for was to stay alive.
“Hopefully not too long. The department is kinda backed up, I’m afraid. I’ll let you know as soon as we know.”
Bruce followed Dr. Romanoff out of the room. Once in the corridor, she turned to him, smiling proudly. “Good job.”
Steve recognised him from various new reports and magazine covers over the years. It was hard to live in America and not know who Obadiah Stane was. He was up there with Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos as businessmen whose fame went beyond the business community.
“I promise,” he added, “I won’t ever hurt Steve.” He raised his pinkie and offered it to her. “Pinkie swear?”
When he woke again, Steve pulled his boots on and filled his travel mug with coffee, collecting some of the fish from the fridge and tossing a couple of apples into the bag too. His own stomach growled, but making breakfast felt like too much effort for him. At the last minute, he grabbed a banana and shoved it into his backpack with his water bottle, then set off.
God, he was pathetic. Rhodey didn’t deserve to deal with this shit. Look at this mess. Steve was going to tidy it up, he decided, kicking off his blanket.
Steve’s face softened. He smiled. “Because I kept the flowers, Tony,” he explained softly. “I keep all of them.”
Steve’s back arched, his muscles going tense as he came in a rush of heat which almost seemed surprising. He let his head drop, panting into Tony’s neck as his orgasm washed over him, leaving him shaking and breathless.
Steve hummed. “I think I probably would’ve seen you at the bar,” he mused, his lips brushing Tony’s ear. “And I probably wouldn’t have recognised you at first and then when I did I probably would’ve called you an asshole or something.”
But Tony’s mind was never still, even with Steve half naked underneath him, and he pulled back to ask, “Do you think Clint was acting weird at dinner?”
“Damn right,” Tony nodded and Bucky fist-bumped him. The only time they were ever completely united was in their Army vs. Air Force rivalry, joining forces to defend the Army’s honour.
Eventually, all of Maria Stark’s papers were gone, the final batch smouldering in the bottom of the oil drum. Steve returned to the office one last time, glancing around the now empty walls and drawers just in case he’d missed anything. Then he left the room, pulling both hidden doors closed behind him, double checking they were properly shut before making his way downstairs.
“Yeah. I thought about it. Then I decided to trust you instead,” Tony replied with a soft smile. He squeezed Steve’s hand. “Let’s go upstairs.”
Steve sucked in a breath, staring out across the waves, watching them roll across the sand for several minutes before he could reply. Grief bubbled in his throat, threatening to choke him.
Evie Rose hummed and hawed over the decision of which ice cream flavours to choose, playing up to her devoted audience of not only her beloved uncle, but also the newfound schmuck with a wallet, before eventually insisting she just had to have Cotton Candy. Tony picked up his own cup of Pumpkin Cheesecake and Steve’s Lemon Sky, allowing Steve to keep an eye on Evie Rose and her own mountain of ice cream, watching fondly while Steve made sure the ice cream didn't end up in a sticky pile on the floor as she climbed onto a chair.
Something nudged his shoulder and Tony jerked backwards, his eyes wide in fear until they fell on DUM-E, who chirped nervously.
Joseph hesitated for a second in the doorway, his moustache twitching, then he disappeared and Steve burst out laughing, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder.
Their eyes met and Steve shook his head, silently begging Tony to go, to hide, to let Steve take Stane’s attention. Not that there was anywhere for Tony to go.
When he did, Steve only managed a quick sip of his vodka before Tony’s hand slipped down his arm and curled their fingers together, tugging Steve out of the booth and towards the dance floor.
Tony spotted Steve’s blond head entering the bar and hopped out of the booth, his arms already outstretched to pull Steve in for a hug. And then finally, finally, Steve was there, in his arms, kissing him.
“You are beautiful,” Tony declared, stopping outside a cage which held a huge, fluffy white monstrosity. He was the most perfect thing Tony had ever seen. “Truly. You are. Beautiful.”
He sat through all sixty eight videos in the playlist and by the time the playlist ended, Steve was shaken and raw. He leaned back in his chair, running his fingers through his hair, blowing out his cheeks as he exhaled slowly.
“Wait, who the fuck are you?” Wilson frowned. His face scrunched in pain, his hand wavering above the blood stain on his
“MJ. I haven’t seen Nick Fury since my wedding day. That was eight years ago. I have no idea where he is.”
“Hey,” Tony said. He held up the thermometer. “Come on, you have a fever and I need to know how much I should be freaking out right now.”
But he pressed a kiss to Steve’s temple to take the sting out of his comment, and Steve snuggled further into his chest.
Tony chuckled, remembering to pick up a key on the way out, then took the stairs to the roof at a jog. He sat down on the blow-up couch, scrolling through his contacts until he found Rhodey.
“It’s okay, honey. I’ve got you,” Tony murmured, running his hand up and down Steve’s spine. Steve felt a strong hand grip his shoulder supportingly and he knew it must be Bucky. He leaned into their touches and tried to forget the feeling of Nefaria’s smug expression sweeping over his body.
He’d called Tony before he arrived and Tony told him that everything was set up for him, he just needed to scan his palm print at the elevator and he would have access to the floor set aside for him, and then Tony promised to stop by after his board meeting.
Steve slumped against the wall, massaging the ache in his arm and squeezing his eyes shut. They burned with unshed tears.
“Hey. Hey buddy?” he called. The guard turned to him. “Hey, hi. Can you help? Please? My nose, it’s, it’s really itchy. Please, can you just scratch it?”
As they unpacked the food and waited for Sharon to arrive, Steve realised how little he actually knew about his roommate.
“I don’t want some pompous little Stark swanning in here and taking over just because he’s riding on the coattails of daddy’s greatness - not that Howard Stark is so great,” Hank muttered. “Maria, she has some skill, I’ll admit that. But Howard only got to where he is because his-”
“I can’t live in Avengers Mountain.” As soon as he says it, he knows he should have just said no to everything. Not being in the mountain is an imperfect boundary and one that won’t alleviate the problem. “The work I’m doing with Stark Unlimited is just too important to me,” he half-lies to explain and hopes it’s enough.
“Did you… Are you making a joke?” Steve exclaimed. He indicated to the blood seeping through his jeans. “Is this funny to you?”
But Steve began to move, riding Tony’s cock and setting a pace in time with Tony’s thrusts. Tony made a strangled noise, his fingers digging into Steve’s hips.
He was still trying not to think too much about Tony being in the battle, or in any kind of danger, but he was determined not to hide from the fact his boyfriend was a superhero. He’d never learn to live with it if he just ignored it.
Steve jumped. His heart pounded in his ears as he spotted Rhodey standing in the doorway of his own bedroom.
It was weird, Scott decided, kinda like watching your dad and your teacher hugging. Not that that had ever happened to him, per se - at least, God, he hoped not. He shuddered. It was the idea or the principle or something.
It took the Dreadnoughts’ scans less than a second to pick up on the fact that Tony had turned off his weapons, leaving him defenceless in the middle of the sky, with no one around to save him. They launched towards him and Tony hit the release switch on his thigh.
He hated watching Tony walk out of the door and had to fight the urge to run after him, gathering him up in his arms and refusing to let go. Logically he knew Tony was keeping the world safe, but emotionally he wanted Tony here, with him, where it was safe.
Beside him, Johnny curled in on himself and Sharon suspected if he could sneak away or disappear, he would’ve done it the second he saw May.
But Steve wanted to expand Ellie’s world beyond the Tower and the Avengers - not to mention the fact that he was starting to get cabin fever. Between staying at SHIELD while he was pregnant and then staying at the Tower because he had Ellie, he’d barely been out since he woke up in the future.
“I don’t believe that is an answer which can be quantified. According to any medical advice, bleeding is not recommended.”
There was too much emotion between them for Tony to linger opening Steve. On another day, he would happily spend as long as possible, taking Steve right to the edge before backing off again. But not today.
“You two think you can get in and out without anybody knowing about it?” Bucky asked. Natasha fixed him with a look. “Right,” Bucky sighed. “Forgot who I was talking to. Alright, let’s do it. On one condition.”
“That’s because that officer tackled you to the ground,” Matt muttered, anger written across his face.
It was a brief biography of the staff at the Marine Institute, including one Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, PhD, who’d worked there for the past two years. A quick detour to Google Maps told him that the Malibu Marine Institute was only a thirty minute drive away. Steve tapped his fingers against his laptop.
“Anyway,” Bucky retorted. “Yes. That was my plan for the night. And you know what? It’s probably my plan for tomorrow night, too. What am I supposed to do? Just sit at home waiting?”
“I’m not,” Steve confirmed. He ducked his head, feeling his cheeks colour and cursed his mother’s Irish colouring. “In fact, if you asked Arnie, he’d say the only one I’ve been pining over is you.”
He takes in a deep breath before adding, “I’ve always liked guys and gals.  It’s nothing new. But if you don’t want to do it Tony, just say it. Don’t talk around it.”
It takes a moment before it clicks. Sharon, the blonde nurse from next door who had later turned out to be Agent 13.  Natasha had filled him in about her before the split up in DC. Peggy’s niece who had been raised by Peggy in the halls of SHIELD.  She had gone CIA after everything.
JARVIS send him a text 72 hours later with a picture an a question.  It’s a pixelated image of a man hunched over, a hood pulled over his head.  But his head is turned just so, and it may have been years - decades - since they have stood in the same space and known each other, but Steve knows Bucky’s cheekbones, the line of his nose, even the familiar bags under those distant eyes.
“Always.”  And Steve finds he means it more than he thought, but pushes the thought away and follows Tony out of the room.
“Huh,” Sam says.  His entire manner changes, like he is studying Steve.  Steve makes sure to lightly hit him when he does. “You know I don’t like your I’m-thinking-something-but-not-going-to-share shrink face.”
“You’re not,” Tony says, quietly.  His spoon scrapes the bottom of his bowl and Steve looks back at him.  “I do what I want, how I want, when I want. If it wasn’t helping you, it would be some other side project.  And this makes me feel useful.”
“They aren’t, and he’s already enroute to the rendezvous point,” she returns easily.  “And you really need to hear this from Tony.” Her lips thin before adding on, “I don’t have all the details.”
Steve feels unbearably guilty about that.  Natasha’s mentioned the amount of stress Tony is under these days.  He’s caught the news here and there on their trek. Watching coverage of press conferences.  Tony working to clean up New York and now D.C. Launching initiatives for scholarships, working on clean energy.  He’s out at galas and museum openings, smiling a bit too wide, laughing in a way Steve doesn’t imagine him when they are talking.
Manhattan would have gone so much better if he had known how to read Tony, he realizes now.  Tony was trying to tell him things back then. He just didn’t take the time to listen.
Steve rocks back on his heels for a moment and turns away from Nat and Clint both talking quietly.  “Yeah,” he says while looking at the water. “It was an easy bar fight. Nat was a surprise though.”
They reach an ancient data center that looks too familiar to what Steve remembers from Zola’s digital appearance.  Natasha calls Tony and puts him on speaker. “Okay kids, I need you to put the bright blue cord from Steve’s tablet into the nearest serial port and turn the baby on.  JARVIS will take care of it from there.”
“Hurts, huh?” Nat says. Her mouth twists with displeasure. “Sounds like a disinhibitor with some kind of tactile response.”
“Vodka,” she replies, deadpanned.  There is a pause, and in that moment, something eases in her.  She doesn’t completely unwind, but there is something in her face that reminds him of Natasha instead of just a soldier.
It had been just like Germany.  Right when the trail had gone cold, there had been some blurry pictures that had shown up on Instagram.  Nothing about the two users could have tied to each other, but still, Tony had been wary about handing him the information.  They had all voted on what to do.
Steve frowns and turns in his seat to face Tony more fully. “You are flushed.” He cups a hand around Tony's shoulder and a juddering gasp slips from Tony's mouth, his eyes going even darker. He licks his lips again and Steve's stomach flutters.
It’s not until they have been in the air for an hour that Steve’s head clears up to realized Tony isn’t there.  He goes to stand up, but a look from Natasha keeps him in his seat.
It feels like that Tony is different than the one he talks to for hours on end.  Steve’s not too comfortable looking at that version of Tony. Sometimes he does, ends up looking too long, trying to find something of his Tony in there.
Natasha reaches out and takes Tony's hand and Tony sags, stepping toward her. She strokes his face. “That wasn't so bad.”
Someone on the right side of the warehouse takes that a cue and levels a rocket launcher at Tony.  Steve scrambles upright, trying to get to Tony, get him out of the blast radius as the guy launches it.  “Tony!” he screams.
Tony steps in real close and kisses him on the corner of his mouth before pulling back.  “How do you feel about burgers.”
And he’s still not caught up, but he can understand the phrase backdoor sounds a little more like a white lie he would tell General Phillips before he and the commandos would roll out on little to no intel and on a hunch and a half.
“I don’t mind,” Tony says, his voice going softer.  “I like having people around more than some would think.”
He spins around, lets off twelve shots hitting each of the guys in non vital places - mostly both kneecaps Steve notes.  Tony then sits down hard. “I’m out,” he says, like it’s small talk and not a problem with all the bullets still raining down around them.  “Seven clips, and I’m already out.”
“So it’s just you and me and some of my friends,” Rumlow grins wider.  Like someone deranged. “I think you’ll enjoy what we have planned for you.”
“My friends will get to me,” Steve bites back, because they don’t leave a man behind.  They aren’t like that. Sam won’t let it go.
“I kind of do,” Tony returns.  “I promised that I privatized national security.  Global security problems makes it look like I am a liar.”  He pauses before adding, “Don’t die out there Captain. That’s an order.”
It’s only four guys, and he gets the first one down with a punch at full strength and a little bit of surprise.  He kicks back, gets guy number two in the gut, as three reaches for him. He falls forward into a handstand before pushing off and letting his feet hit the third guy in the face.  Steve ends up standing over him, grabs his gun and removes the magazine and twists the metal of the gun in hand until it’s unrecognizable.
As they get settled in to watch the movie, Steve glances over and catches Tony's eye again. Tony gives him a tiny smile and Steve's stomach flips. He wriggles deeper under Thor's arm, the warmth and weight of it washing through him in vibrating waves of contentment and he sees Tony frown. Nat pinches Tony's leg.
That’s when the hook behind him gets yanked on, and Steve can’t hide the low groan.  He falls back into the motion, turns and hunches, making the guy unsteady on his feet before sweeping the man’s feet out from under him.  He goes down, hard and lets go of the chain. Steve takes what little is left and wraps it around his hands before turning towards the footsteps to his right and jabs right at the second man.  He then takes the chain and wraps it around his neck until he passes out and let’s go, watching the man slumps in front of him.
Steve stays where he is, fingers clutching the edge of the box as he watches.  Tony strolls across the open area, moonlight catching his skin and making him glow.  He stops in the middle of the space. Rumlow leans against a hummer, gun held loosely in his hand, but still trained on Tony.  “You’re not going to negotiate for the dear captain you came to rescue?”
Bruce interrupts him.  “You know,” he starts, “I told him he wouldn’t want to keep me around here.  There was too good of a chance of a Hulk-out, and he doesn’t need the attention. You know what he told me?”  Bruce’s demeanor changes, shifting his balance until he leans in a little and gestures widely enough that the remnants of his tea nearly fly out of his cup.  “‘I’m been doing what I shouldn’t for this long ,and it hasn’t caused me any problems I care about yet.’”
On stage, the Ironettes swivel their hips as one and Steve pictures Tony doing the same in those tiny, shiny shorts. His ears go blisteringly hot.
Steve takes the lead, keeping an eye out for anyone headed their direction and Tony falls back to walk with Natasha, the two of them talking in low voices.
He moves side to side a little bit as the gunshots ping around him, trying to use Rumlow as a shield.  Steve hears Rumlow grunt as he gets hit once or twice before going silent, fingers falling limp. He knows he has to keep Rumlow there a few more moments.  It could be another fake out, but he’s losing his grip on the chain that is still biting into his hands, even though they are slick with his own blood at this point.
“Wait,” Tony called. Steve turned and raised an eyebrow. Tony swallowed. “Why? I know you said all that stuff about how I need you but… Why?”
Steve did as ordered, perching on the corner of her unmade bed and tilting his head back to give her better access.
“Technically, I was early,” Stark argued, a shit-eating grin spreading across his face, “Considering I started treating my first patient before my shift even started.”
He used to think he would never have this. He’d thought that he would be too sick or weak to carry a pup to term and had tried to content himself with the knowledge that not everyone had pups.
“And not that it really matters,” Tony continued, “But I actually like a partner who challenges me. Besides, I live in the same building as Bruce Banner and Bucky Barnes. And despite Barnes’ earlier behaviour, he is technically a genius too. Serum amplified everything.”
They crossed the street, Tony and Bucky flanking MJ as they approached the homeless camp. Tony’s heart wrenched at the sight of all these people, left with no choice but to live on the streets. This wasn’t the country he went to war for.
“No, he’s not,” Tony replied calmly. “His renal artery is cut, I’m gonna clamp it. We’re going to use his own blood. Start a line. Go! Come on, time is of the essence here, people.”
Steve’s eyes flickered to the audience, where the vultures were leaning forward, smelling gossip on the horizon and determined not to miss out on anything important. He took a deep breath, focusing on keeping his face blank.
“I beg your pardon?” Loki Borson exclaimed, looking affronted. Bruce suspected that he often wore than expression, on the rare occasions when someone had the guts to tell him that he was wrong.
But he didn’t pull away, didn’t slip back into the water and splash Steve with his tail. He lay on the cracked tile, both of them staring up at the night sky in silence, their fingers entwined. Steve couldn’t help but wonder if Tony’s heart was pounding as hard as his own.
“We heard the noise,” she explained. “Men in tracksuits. They used to own the building until Clint bought it. He chased them away. But they’ve been back, trying to get the building back from him. I looked out the window…”
t-shirt. He ran through his leaving-the-apartment checklist; phone, keys, wallet, inhaler, Epipen. By the time he was ready, Angie had emerged from her room, a hoodie that Steve recognised as his own dwarfing her tiny frame.
“We should just upload his information onto the app,” Marci pointed out. “Then it’s easier to add photos and whatever.”
“Because I’m a disaster when it comes to relationships,” Steve explained. “So, I don’t have them. I can barely keep friendships alive, so I have… no chance with anything more. I’m a mess.”
After a moment of terror at the thought of taking care of Steve, Tony forced himself to calm down and reminded himself that he’d successfully nursed himself back to health multiple times, including from food poisoning, measles, and palladium poisoning.
Or he was, until Tony hooked his fingers into the neck of Barton’s t-shirt and yanked him backwards. Barton squawked, arms flailing, before falling into a chair more by luck than any real skill as far as Steve could tell.
“I’m just gonna cut the wire,” Clint declared and oh great, now Tony was having helicarrier flashbacks.
Steve rolled over in bed, caught in that place between sleep and wakefulness thanks to the knowledge that he was in a strange bed. He reached out blindly for Tony but instead of his boyfriend, his hand met warm but empty sheets.
His heat only lasted three days, which was unusually short for Steve but he wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth. He still felt tired when it was over but it wasn’t the bone crushing weariness of the last few days. Plus, without the aching muscles it was a lot easier to deal with.
The door was open and Steve was standing there, in pyjama pants and bare chested, looking adorably sleep-rumpled. Just the sight of him had Tony’s eyes filling up and his throat closed.
He meant for more than just the picture. He thought about what Arnie said, about knowing that Ellie was loved, and realised that they would never have to worry about her not being loved. Not as long as the Avengers were around.
“You not going to lose your mind and try and take us all out?” Clint adds.  “Because I would like to fly this plane, find a bed, and pass out for a while.  Getting in another fight with you is something not in that plan.”
Tony takes a moment to take in a deep breath and collect himself before he speaks.  “Yeah,” Tony stands and discards all the gear he was wearing to keep from losing his instruments.  “Get a plane ready. Do we have a go bag for this?”
The morning breakfasts where everyone staggers in and makes jokes about Tony having to pay for them all to his disgruntled pre-coffee face.
“The times have changed and so have the technology,” Tony replies in between mouthfuls.  “I’d have to teach you this stuff, and it’s just faster at this point between me and JARVIS.  It’s just hard sometimes, like a needle in a haystack. Because your friend is good as much as I hate to admit it.  We have had to get inventive.”
“We suspected,” Tony admits.   “I wasn’t sure how much he was following you or it was an accident.  After Germany, I was suspicious.” The clanging of shots pause, and Tony shoots up.  Steve sees some more guys around the corner, and Tony mutters, “I got them.”
Then, Steve thinks of Bucky running scared, trying to stay safe.  How he’s gotten better at avoiding media. He’s had to learn to be scarce.  He knows he is being hunted. Steve’s heart hurts at the images he can conjure up all too easily.
“Oh,” she had repeated before rolling her eyes and heading back to the front of the plane.  Sam hadn’t had the decency to move. Just sat there and laughed at him to his face before Steve shoved him and moved to the back bunk to avoid everyone.)
“If you’re sure,” Steve says, careful not to push.  He remembers Natasha remarking that Tony got rid of all his suits - all but walked away from the life except for helping him.
“Hey, you guys gonna dish up or what?” Clint says, waggling a silver kettle with a narrow spout. Tony raises an eyebrow at Clint, making no move to take it, so Steve does.
“Talked to Tony, he wanted to make sure the two of you were okay,” she shrugs.  “I just got back from New York.” She watches him for a moment, and Steve doesn’t want to know what she reads into his face.  “You look better with the beard than this one,” is all she adds, rolling a shoulder at Clint.
Clint goes, “Whatever you want to do.  This is your mission. I’m just along for the ride and sweet paycheck to make sure you don’t try to die again
The waiter returns with Tony’s coffee and a companion, who carries a massive round silver tray covered in piles of bright colored food. Behind him is another guy with six plates carefully balanced on both arms. Those have rolls of something thin and brown. Up close, it kind of reminds Steve of a crepe.
“Is what because of you?” Tony sounds distant, and he had told Steve he would have to keep working through the call, but he would be too tied up to text, so talking would be easier and faster.
They end up back in the states after the Russia lead.  New York actually, and they wait until JARVIS can tell them where Bucky has been sighted next.  They end up in the city, not the compound - at the Tower of all places.
“Uh,” Steve stutters.  “Sam said he had some loose ends to tie up before he headed out, but to call him when I get information.”
Tony curses lowly before closing his eyes and clearing his head.  “Okay I’m heading your way Nat. Text me any updates on what you know. We need to figure out where they have taken Steve.”
“So,” Tony pulls out a tone Steve is getting used to, and fondly calls - in his head -  teacher mode, “You know google is a thing used to search for information that basically is an index of the internet, right?”
Steve doesn’t hear the answer but sees the men on the right approaching.  He slides his eyes away and sees them keep coming out of the corner of his eyes - thinking he can’t see them.  Yeah, definitely dosed with something, but he can feel it all coming back, bit by bit. He lets get the men five feet away, listening to Tony speak to the others as he reloads, before leaping up, over Tony’s head and taking them on.
Tony laughs, helplessly a little.  But it’s realer, nicer. His body language is loose, not tight and shut down.  It reminds him of Clint when he is trying to make Steve see something his way. What Tony forgets is Steve is stubborn. “But what I meant is I don’t spend a year housing, paying and helping on an adventure like yours if I don’t like you.”
Steve shrugs.  “I actually insulted him when I first met him.  We got on a little better as it went on, but we parted on pretty rocky terms.”  Sam keeps eyeing him, and Steve adds, “I haven’t seen him since Manhattan and whole aliens coming from a hole in the sky thing.”
She tilts her head, inspecting the room, and Steve leans back and takes a moment to mock outrage as he follows her gaze to the right.  The barkeep just finishes searching for something under the bar, a disgruntled look as he straightens and puts up one finger to the customer at the bar before heading to the back.
Bullets ring out, and he gets shot once in the stomach as he keeps pushing forward.  Tony looks back at him for a moment, and yells, “Get back!” even as a rocket comes right at him.
Tony had built a tracking program to put together footage of Bucky and shifted through the information with some algorithm to discover what was the most useful.  JARVIS refused to tell Steve where the original software had come from - only admitted Tony needed to tweak some things in the initial program.
“Not...not like that.”  Tony groans. “God just ignore all of that.  I’m scrubbing you guys from the video.”
Steve wants to do that, to feed something into Tony's mouth, and he flushes hot at the thought. Instead, he digs in, copying Clint and Tony and pinching some of the food between a scrap of the brown sheet from his own plate and popping the whole thing in his mouth. The flavor is intense, completely taking over his tongue, followed by the tangy flavor of the pancake-like stuff. It's unlike anything Steve's ever eaten, despite some of the familiar flavors.
“How’s Pepper?” Steve asks, looking out into the dark night sky.  “Last time you said she was doing better.”
Steve’s phone starts ringing after two days in the hospital.  He has to sheepishly wince as a woman double his age (and
"Yeah,” Steve replies, peering around for any easy to spot cameras.  There is one under the United sign. “Cameras again?”
Steve looks ahead and sees Natasha and Clint talking back and forth about some topic or another.  Her gaze is warm when she looks at Clint. Warmer than Steve’s seen it before. “JARVIS mostly. He’s Tony’s AI.  He’s doing some research for this,” he waves a hand around.
“Well,” Tony responds.  “You are stopping some actual bad guys today, so I don’t think you are doing too shabby of a second job there.”
Tony missed it.  And Steve wanted to know what it was like to truly work side by side with him again.
He can practically hear the shrug across the line.  “Pepper and Nat text,” he offers. “What did you call me about?”
“That’s true,” Steve replies.  “I just kind of want this over thought.  I want to go back to New York and take a moment and just sit down.  Not having to be rushing, you know.”
They end up stumbling towards Tony’s plane a half a mile away.  Steve’s healing but with a bullet wound in the gut, the meat hook still in his shoulder, and what is probably a concussion - he’s having a hard time walking in a straight line.  Tony is leading the way, still in the suit. He’s being short, succulent in a way Steve isn’t used to.
“God, Natasha just keeps all the secrets and doesn’t share anything,” Tony huffs.  “Long story short, we’ve got a training facility outside New York. You’re in DC right?”
“Oh my god, of course you're not fine. You're the first one who touched me after Hammer grabbed me!”
“Do what exactly?” Tony asks, tentatively.  Steve looks up and sees he has pulled close to Steve, but just barely out of arms reach.  “You said ‘do it’, what does that
Tony shrugs, “I’m helping nameless, faceless people in the crowd.  With this, I know who is benefiting, and I’ve realized I like putting faces to who I help.”
right,” Tony says again and the hand that's been burning steadily against Steve's thigh for the better part of the last few minutes pulls away. Tony groans, but Steve has a hard time focusing on that because his leg feels
“Of course you needed help,” Tony replies when he asks him in the middle of a tiny village in the middle of Russia.  They are about to hike out to a rumored facility where they held Bucky once. “And it’s like you don’t know what google alerts are.”
Sam leans forward and nods.  “You and Stark must be close if he’s lending you his AI.”  He looks casual but it’s been five months on this journey, and Steve’s gotten pretty good at reading Sam’s counselor mode.  The closeness and look in his eyes is always key to knowing exactly what mode Sam is in.
, and turns to his contacts.  He dials Tony, listens to the phone ring change before there is an out of breath, “You okay?”
“I...” Steve doesn't move, feeling the weight of everyone's eyes and, worse, the weight of the idea of touching Tony the way Natasha is now, her fingers stroking the hair at the back of his neck, and… His heart speeds up, juddering in his chest.
Tony pauses, like he didn’t expect that, before getting flustered.  “Shit, I didn’t mean it like that. I know you’re old fashioned and love your pin up girls, it’s nothing like that -”
That thought hits him hard, and Steve has to sit down on the bed for a moment and shake away the imperfect pictures that are his memories before the serum of him and Bucky laughing, arguing, and everything in between in that tiny Brooklyn apartment.  Him coughing too hard all of a sudden and the way Bucky’s eyes went tight.
Steve keeps staring, and the moment drags between them before Clint slumps even further, like a man defeated.  “Okay, maybe all true,” Clint amends. “But I’m decent at flying thing, and it’s in my contract to not eat dumpster pizza.”
“The amount of shirts the merchandising side of the nonprofit has sold with the outline of your shield and helmet covers it,”  There is a pause and the shutting of doors. “Like I said, don’t worry about it. How do you like your new gear?”
Steve laughs as he hangs up, cutting off Tony’s rant mid sentence, because he’s gotten used to it by now.
“Miss me Captain?” the man asks, muffled behind the mask.  He comes to a top right in front of Steve, just far enough that Steve can’t reach reach out to him if he wanted to.
“You okay without Natasha out there working on your stuff?” Steve asks.  He knows they have been working on something. He can sometimes hear her in the background, talking in low whispers in the middle of their conversations at all hours.  Bruce sometimes too. Hulk, once or twice.
Steve covers his face, shoulders hunching. “This is not how I wanted you to find out,” he says stiffly.
He takes in the scene, a mostly empty bar where they were supposed to meet an twitter user who had promised information that JARVIS had thought may be legitimate. The bar’s emptied out, and there is no one left.  Another dead end.
“If only you weren’t hanging out here like a skinned dead animal,” Rumlow sneers.  “You would be surprised about how long a man could stay awake when you separate their skin from the meat.  And with your healing factor? I could work on beating all of my records ten times over.”
bubble shows for a long moment before a reply appears.  He doesn’t know it until after he reads the text, but Steve has been holding his breath the entire time.
“It’s good, great even,” Steve replies.  “But the info on the tablet. This is more than enough to start tracking down Bucky.”
Steve can't stand that look on his face and the words just keep coming. “I can't—not, not when I'm like this, Tony. It takes all I've got to stop myself on a normal day. I can't do it with
“Was,” Clint shrugs bonelessly, and sometimes Steve wonders about his story.  How Clint came to be here, but he isn’t someone to be noisy like that. “Now I’m one of Tony Stark’s drivers.”
“She’s taking the CEO spot back,” Tony says.  “Not a moment too soon. I’m about to strangle the board.”
It reminds him of Peggy, in the early days.  The way she always was hiding a smile for some reason or another.
“So,” Steve lifts his chin up.  “You’re Winter Soldier 2.0. You know HYDRA has never been that great at making the second one as good as the first.”  He grins. “Look at all the failed versions of me? I took down the Red Skull and he was the closest version.”
and aching in its wake. Tony puts his hand back and it's like dipping his leg into a Jacuzzi—hot and instantly soothing.
“Rush job,” Tony replies.  He looks to where Natasha and Steve are standing, and Steve knows the moment he sees how much he is leaning on Natasha.  “Let’s get bird brain and get out of here. Steve needs some medical attention. My plane is nearby.”
Bucky stands up and heads to him.  Everyone pulls a few steps away but watches them closely.  Bucky uses his flesh hand to grab the arm less bruised up. “Where is the medical gear in this place?”
Tony shrugs.  “No suits or arc reactor any more.  I wouldn’t be much of one in the field.  I’m strictly sticking to the desk duty these days.”
They watch as the compound burns down companionably outside when Sam asks, “How come he always answers you guys?”
“I told you,” he said quietly. “Anything Ellie needs. And she needs- she deserves to know her sire. To- To have a chance at remembering him. He’s her dad.” Tony’s eyes closed for a second. “She deserves the chance to know him,” he finished, meeting Steve’s eyes once more.
Steve closed his bedroom door, leaning against it for a second before hobbling over to his bed and collapsing. He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes until he saw stars. Blinking until his vision cleared, Steve stared up at the faint watermark on his ceiling and whispered, “What the fuck just happened?”
When he swapped contracts with Tony, Steve leaned close and whispered, “Are you two trying to make me laugh?”
alerted them to their arrival at the penthouse. Tony pulled back, smiling brightly, and pulled Steve out of the elevator.
“It’s definitely working,” Peggy agreed. “Tony has serious bedroom eyes for you. Poor boy can’t keep his eyes off your arse.”
Icy water flooded into his suit, his wound stinging, and then the suit was gone, falling apart and washing away.
“No, you won’t,” the drunk retorted. “Fucking doctors. I’m hurt! I’m bleeding! And you don’t help. What kind of fucking doctors don’t help people, huh? Huh?”
A crunch drew his attention; when Tony turned around, Clint was frowning at the remains of a cell phone with a Kandinsky case. Bile rose in his throat.
Tony came immediately towards him, pulling him in for a kiss. Steve tangled his fingers in Tony’s hair, deepening the kiss and pouring everything into it.
And that brings us to the end of Wildfire! Thank you so much to everyone who has read, kudosed and commented on this fic, and an extra special thank you to the artists who have contributed to it; Trashie, Charlie, and Quinn.
Suddenly he remembered stepping through this door for the first time, with the realtor who showed it to him, and falling in love with the apartment immediately. He was ready to start his future and couldn’t wait for it to arrive.
He pulled back, then let his hips snap forward, driving into Steve again and again until he was a squirming, groaning mess beneath Tony, his vocabulary reduced to
“Urgh, fine,” Clint grumbled. “But only because it’s a matter of national security. And none of you have any taste.”
“Awesome. Stark Industries is involved in cutting edge medical research and technology that helps kids and adults alike recover. They are also supplying tablets, televisions and other sound and vision equipment to paediatric units across the country to help the families that need it most and make hospital stays a little more tolerable.
“When I was a kid,” Tony began slowly, staring at the water. “I found this piece of tech in the water. It was dropped by, I don’t know, researchers or something.” There was a ghost of a smile on his face. “I spent hours taking it apart and trying to figure out how it worked.”
“It’s okay, baby,” Steve smiled, leaning into Tony’s side. “I was small and skinny until I was sixteen, so I always got picked last. So we would’ve been picked last together.”
At the end of the day, Steve picked up the flowers carefully, taking care with them on the subway and thanking his lucky stars he’d decided against taking his bike to work that morning.
October crawled into November, the skies turning greyer and the nights growing longer, and life went on as normal. Or as normal as it coulda Steve supposed, when you were dating a billionaire superhero. But despite everything, it was normal.
Back at the apartment, he loaded the fish into the fridge then tiptoed back to his room and crashed on his bed to try and catch a few more hours of sleep.
Steve told himself that he wasn’t going to do anything about Tony, but then he spend the entire drive back to the Tower thinking about it. And once he started thinking about it, he couldn’t stop thinking about it. By the time he pulled into the Tower parking lot, he was gripped by the same determination he’d felt before going after Hydra.
“This suit is Tom Ford,” Tony replied. “It doesn’t come with a lock pick. That’s an optional extra. What about you? You worked in a circus. Are you telling me you can’t get out of some ropes?”
Tony tilted Steve’s head back so he could inspect the split lip, the black eye, and the cut on Steve’s cheek. The entire time, it felt like something was building, some invisible pressure squeezing down on them, and Steve knew it was only a matter of time until it blew.
He stepped under the spray, letting it soak through his clothes until they were sticking to him. He didn’t have any soap, but he scrubbed his hands over his body and his clothes, getting the worst of the dirt and the dried sweat off of his skin. It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough until he could make it home for a proper shower.
Tony spat out the toothpaste, picking up the glass and rinsing out his mouth. He dropped his toothbrush into the glass and stared at it for a minute. His toothbrush was sitting there, between Steve and Angie’s, looking like it belonged there.
Steve put his guitar aside, leaning it against the end of the couch and tossing his plectrum onto the table before shuffling closer to Tony.
“I ate a bagel,” Hope blurted out. “Earlier. I ate a bagel earlier. That’s probably why my lipstick is smudged. No other reason.”
A soft cough drew his attention. Steve blinked, and found one of the cleaning staff watching him with understanding eyes. “Mr Rogers, don’t you have to get to class?” she said gently.
They separated briefly - and yet still for far too long - to wriggle out of their pants and underwear. Tony kicked his jeans off of the bed and lunged towards his bedside cabinet, yanking the drawer open and groaning loudly.
He scrolled through all the information on the company, its financial history and stock prices, when something jumped out at him. The company ran a casino boat which operated out of the Chelsea Piers called the Guiletta. Running a quick search, he found that she left the dock twenty three minutes ago. Taking into account travel time, that would give them just enough time for them to take Steve from Castello Malvagio to the Chelsea Piers.
“Oh yeah, vomit, I forgot. Well, go nurse him back to health so you can profess your undying love and give me nieces and nephews. I want three, by the way.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, his fingers itching to reach out for Tony, desperate to comfort him in whatever way he could. He’d always been tactile, especially when it came to comfort.
The rest of the team was already gathered at the dining table in the communal kitchen when Tony emerged from the elevator, box in hand.
“Yeah. I know,” he nodded. “I’d say nice to meet you, but I think we can both agree this isn’t nice, it’s just horribly awkward.”
“I know I’m being stupid and vain,” Tony muttered, looking up so Steve could apply the make-up over the dark circles beneath his eyes.
In a move which went disastrously wrong the first time they tried it, Tony lifted Steve’s right knee just enough for Tony to slip his leg out from underneath and open it. “Hands on my shoulders,” Tony murmured.
"If I break my promise, you can kick my butt,” Tony promised. When she remained unconvinced, he added, “And have all the ice cream in the world. Deal?”
Underwater, with his chest growing tighter by the second, it took everything Steve had not to panic. Panicking would just result in him running out of oxygen even quicker, he reasoned. But, God, it was terrifying.
“It’s so good to see you again,” Alexander grinned, squeezing Steve’s shoulder just the wrong side of too much.
“Looking for the off switch,” Tony replied. “So we can get some sleep. Is this it?” he asked, flicking Steve’s nipple.
Tony laughed, glancing over his shoulder as he walked towards the elevator. And he thought to himself that Steve looked like he belonged in Tony’s kitchen.
As Hank turned to leave, the supply room door opened again and Hope stepped out. Hank smiled automatically at the sight of his daughter, who started when her eyes fell on him.
“I think we both know,” Stane replied. “And unlike you, I won’t insult your intelligence by pretending we don’t know exactly what’s going on here.”
But Arnie was in London on leave. When Steve realised that he couldn’t survive several more days of this, he’d called up his old friend and asked him to help him through his heat. Arnie took one look at Steve’s pained expression and agreed.
And despite the fact Steve had been feeling off for three days now, the irritation flared up at Tony calling him on it, and he snapped, “I’m fine.”
Steve’s stomach grumbled loudly, but he walked away without picking anything to eat. He just didn’t have the energy for that.
Tony took a moment just to look at him, drinking in the little crease between his eyebrows that meant he was concentrating and the tick in his jaw that meant whatever it was had pissed him off. God, Tony was so relieved to see him again.
Pepper pressed a shaking hand to her mouth and ducked her head. Natasha could picture the ring that Hogan showed her earlier sitting on her finger. It belonged there, but for a cruel twist of fate that was going to tear them apart again.
With that sobering thought, Steve returned to the pool room. He tried not to let the potential loss of such a large piece of Hollywood’s architectural history bring him down, and instead did his best to enjoy exploring. Off of the swimming pool was what remained of a billiard room. The table was gone, but the light fitting which would’ve hung low, illuminating the table through the fog of cigar smoke, still remained. The sunlight glinted off of the gold plating and the green glass.
Steve nodded slowly but he made no attempt to move until Tony heaved himself off of the couch with a groan and held out his hand. Steve took it, tanging their fingers together and levered himself upright. They left the den and headed down to the communal kitchen.
