. They were a team. In this together. Taking care of each other. Protecting each other. Two strong people in a partnership in every aspect of life.
"Oh, I-" John Watson's beautiful tenor voice murmurs uncomfortably behind him and Sherlock freezes. "Sorry, I just… I just wanted to make sure you were alright."
Thank god for John doing it first before the blood rushing up Sherlock's neck reaches the capillaries in his cheeks.
They could fuck like this one day. John could work Sherlock open on his hands and knees and drive into him with dirty thrust after dirty thrust and he knows, Christ he can tell from the arch in that beautiful backside that Sherlock would fucking
Sherlock smiled, attempting a laugh of his own and abandoning it halfway through as John crooked his fingers just so.
A loud, sharp bang rang out through the small flat and John's fingers froze in their movements, eyes shooting up to find an equally frightened Sherlock.
"I mean, yeah it was intrusive and borderline humiliating for me to hear all my secrets revealed, but I don't know. It was accurate. And you were only trying to help."
Nodding once succinctly, Sherlock sets his beer bottle to the side and grips the tiny sphere in his hand, palm sweating around it as he realizes this game does actually require some sort of skill. He's glad there isn't much expectation on how he plays but he'd prefer not to make a damn fool out of himself.
," Sherlock teases back, screwing his face up into mock seriousness as he says, "I've been busy studying
He doesn't know who initiates, all he knows is John's lips are so soft and not as rough and urgent as normal and Sherlock is melting into him.
"What?" Sherlock demands, finally pausing in his preparations to depart and staring John down. "What is the issue here?"
But he hadn't yet. They went on, discussing Sherlock's abilities and police work. By the end, John was edging closer on the couch and trying to subtly hint that he would like to tag along on more cases if Sherlock would have him. The thought of John being involved in this part of his life had been a very bizarre turn-on.
"Well he's got Sherlock wrapped around his finger," John muttered, this conversation making him feel no better than before. So Sherlock ends up with someone terrible. Someone worse than John. Someone worthless. So what?
good. I swear. I just… there are so many things I want Sherlock, I can't even begin to… I've never let myself really want them, though, you know? With you, I just thought maybe it wasn't in the cards, that maybe sex wasn't ever going to be your thing but now… now I know and all the things I've never truly let myself think about… I mean, I've certainly
It meant that Sherlock was trusting him. As much as John was letting himself be vulnerable, Sherlock was placing himself in an equal state, trusting John with everything he had.
John obeyed. He took a cursory glance around the room himself, shuddering slightly as he took in a large pool of blood lying ominously on the floor. Everything else looked untouched to an untrained eye, with the exception of the giant red puddle. John bit back on the unease he felt knowing someone died in this room, and turned his gaze back to the man on the floor.
The boy on top of him currently licking into his mouth and taking everything he has? Yes, Sherlock will give anything to this boy.
"Sure," Greg nods amiably, "plenty of people can. Although, those people are not usually ones who've gotten my boyfriend's baby brother completely legless at a party."
Ignoring the pain in his chest, Sherlock doesn't bother to move until the lot of the footballers are gone and then he's hurrying off in the opposite direction, adjusting the strap on his shoulder as he hurries down the hall to safety, already feeling drained and it's only first hour, trying and failing to pretend Anderson's words aren't currently bouncing around inside his head and making his heart hurt just a little more than usual.
Tomorrow. Tomorrow Sherlock would tell him. Tonight he would let him sleep. And tomorrow, he would tell John everything. And let John decide for himself if Sherlock Holmes was worthy of being loved by John Watson.
In all his years on earth, Sherlock has never lived closer than ten meters from another person. He shares a home with an older brother, a housekeeper and an entire wait staff, but none of them
He promptly forgets all about Chemistry and stares down at the pencil-written paragraph – no, wait –
"Stay with me," he whispers into the dark, holding tighter to the boy in his arms whose softening cock is still buried inside him. "Please."
John glanced over in time to see Mycroft raise a defiant eyebrow, silently assessing and judging the hell out of the spoiled prat in John's way.
"Never had to," Sherlock shrugs. "Everyone that mattered pretty much seems to have assumed or guessed. Didn't seem like there was much of a point."
Sherlock replays what he just said back in his mind then freezes. "Nothing," he murmurs, eyes wide. "Never mind." He turns hard on his heel and attempts to take off, but a strong hand wraps around his wrist.
Sherlock follows with slightly less enthusiasm, something suspiciously like nerves squirming unpleasantly in his belly.
Irene makes an appalled face like John is being completely ignorant about something abundantly clear and turns to Paul for support.
"I'm freezing," Sherlock grouses, glaring out onto the pitch as though it has personally offended him. He feels that it has. If it weren't for this stupid rectangle of mud and chunks of grass, Sherlock would be home right now, sipping hot tea and soaking his battered toes in a footbath. His eyes flutter at the thought as his bones chill beneath his coat.
Then he rips Sherlock's towel from his waist and picks the boy up by his hips and, quite literally, throws him onto the bed.
Sherlock talked. He spoke with such conviction and passion, like everything he'd said was absolute fact and not to be questioned and John, though he probably should know better, was immediately enthralled.
He has absolutely nothing to worry about. Irene, while stunning, is not a threat to his relationship. No one is. Not with the undeniably strong connection they share.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was fully aware how entirely irrational he was being. This was Sherlock Holmes, for godsake. His nutter of a roommate, best friend and most recently boyfriend was added to the list of titles. Really, he should have expected this. He should
John dives under again and Sherlock quickly and efficiently strips off his clothing, running starkers into the water before John resurfaces.
? Did something happen? What happened? People only say they're fine when they aren't fine, right? Is Sherlock trying to tell him something? That everything
go waltzing into the lion's den right now. Not when John has no plan in place. Not when John isn't prepared. Not when John is utterly
"There you go, baby," John murmurs encouragingly in his ear. "Are you going to come? Will you come for me?"
fucking him tonight making his stomach churn unpleasantly, realization crashing over him as he takes in the boy on his porch.
Ignoring the silently boiling, raging lava pooling underneath his skin, John nods gently. "Okay," he says evenly, terrified of spooking Paul into not continuing but barely containing himself from reaching out and shaking the rest of the information out of his friend.
He can't seem to find any words to explain that that isn't what he meant but it also might kind of be what he meant he supposes, so instead of saying anything at all, he simply gapes stupidly for long enough that John lifts a hand to lay against his cheek and leans forward with a soft laugh. "I think I like the sound of that," he whispers, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's cheek. He strokes a thumb along a red cheekbone once more before dropping his hand and glancing back to the menu, taking the pressure off of Sherlock to figure out something to say.
An hour earlier, short, tanned fingers had been holding tightly to a boney hip. A rough, calloused palm had been pressed to a racing heart. Damp lips had been exhaling heated, sleeping breathes against a pale ear at the same tempo of a chest rising and falling along sharp shoulder blades.
. He wanted to have the freedom to explore this, figure out what he truly wanted, make mistakes and sort it all out. And he lived in the very last place on earth that he could do that. So, again, night after night of thinking and wishing and
"Oh yeah?" John whispers, parting his lips just millimeters from the head of Sherlock's cock. "Lick where?"
And the breath he'd recently caught promptly leaves his chest again, swiftly knocked from his lungs at the sight before him.
A serious shiver of fresh rage rattles his short frame and John has to drop his hand from where it rests on Paul's shoulder to clench his fists to his sides and calm himself before he does something truly crazy, like storm out of this kitchen right now and make his way down the street to Victor and Paul's house.
"You are a bit," Victor grins wider, clearly missing the hint of frustration in Sherlock's tone. "Come on. You gotta relax if you want to be at your best for teaching Chemistry, yeah?"
John felt a small warmth burrow itself into his chest. He impressed Sherlock. He'd surprised Sherlock. John bit the inside of his lip to keep from smiling harder.
A soft moan was heard in the room and he couldn't decide if it was from him or Sherlock but it was delicious. He giggled. "You're so warm," he said again, trying to whisper, hoping it sounded as sexy as it did in his head, and hoping if he spoke softly Sherlock would be okay with him speaking.
"Oh my god," Irene grumbles, shaking her head at her own phone before all three devices in the kitchen sound with different ringtones and John pulls his back out to check it.
"There we are," John grins and his thigh presses against Sherlock's, forcing a rather serious shiver to make its way down the curly-haired boy's spine. He thanks his past self for flipping the lights off before sitting down on the couch, effectively hiding the heat creeping into his cheeks.
"But that's the whole point, John!" Sherlock cries, embarrassment mixing with anger making him feel unnecessarily anxious and defensive. This is John he's talking to after all. John would never make him feel bad about any of this. But still, he keeps bloody talking because he apparently has zero self-control. "It's never on
John turns his head and presses a kiss to Sherlock's temple. "We did it, baby. You and me. And Dolly of course," he says, patting Dolly's neck. "Such a good girl."
Sherlock paused and looked away as though weighing something in his mind. John noticed his hand shaking silently and stared at the man, realizing how difficult this truly was for him. John's heart pounded a little harder, suddenly finding himself being privy to something as private as Sherlock's inner thoughts. He'd been so angry with him this past week he hadn't realized how much he missed the intrigue he had toward this man, how fascinated he was by him. He forgot how much he loved the mysteries of Sherlock and now here he was, gaining more access then he ever had before, information about how Sherlock felt. How Sherlock felt about
He swipes the pad of his thumb over the spot, gathering the liquid onto the pad of his finger and slips it between Sherlock's still parted lips.
John hummed in reply, closing his eyes and trying not to think about newspapers and editors and who the hell he'd become since meeting Sherlock Holmes.
?" John gripes but his footsteps are getting closer and Sherlock takes one steady breath, grins down at his feet for a solid beat before pushing down on the handle of the door and tossing it open with barely contained excitement.
it, Sherlock. Not being with you like that… only being friends. I couldn't… You are my best friend. Always have been. I'd rather date nameless girls than risk our friendship. Not when I thought you didn't feel the same way."
, he tacks on internally. He can't be sure he won't vomit later after this little trek home, considering how his stomach keeps rolling, though the urgency of it has dulled to a slow tumble, simply reminding Sherlock that's its still unsettled and perhaps debating how it would like to go about fixing it, not giving the genius an option in the least.
Bright grey eyes are staring down at him, hooded and clouded but bright as ever, wet swollen lips parted and begging to be kissed all over again, cheeks glowing red and round and beautiful, curls twisting up this way and that, Sherlock Holmes is an absolute mess and positively stunning just like this, mostly naked and painfully unfulfilled, fire burning in his irises silently pleading to be touched.
John had babbled happily the entire cab ride home, grinning from ear to ear, gesturing wildly, reliving the moment over and over.
"I really don't think there is," John protested. "He's just bitter because a lower rank then him is getting special attention from a Major."
John frowned. "Uh- I don't know. Probably just an easy target or something seeing as you live with me. I'm sorry, he has it out for me, I told you. It'll be fine-"
is pushing against a gently rising and falling stomach with every breath Sherlock takes, bringing John's full attention down between them and zeroing in on the soft rub of his own jersey stroking against the head of his-
"Christ, you're so soft," John murmurs against his skin, dragging his lips along Sherlock's pectoral muscle. "You taste
He continued to deny he was going, because really, he shouldn't be going, but since he sort of already knew better than to believe he'd ever be able to out maneuver a Holmes, he'd privately resigned himself to the fact that he was in fact going. He'd huff a bit and sigh and shrug and tell Sherlock it didn't matter because he really couldn't be going on this trip, while silently vibrating with anticipation at the prospect.
John's head is down, shoulders stiff and unyielding as he shuffles down the corridor, a bead of sweat dripping down his temple that only Sherlock would think to look for.
She stomps her feet a few times and Sherlock feels that familiar curiosity crawl up over his spine like it always does.
And suddenly, another voice is filling his head, an all-too-familiar voice speaking words he'd only heard a short time ago, six words ringing in his ears like a bomb has just gone off.
"Here we are then," John handed the bottle to his friend and took a sip. He chose to ignore the same odd look Mike was still giving him and stole a glance at the wall where he'd seen him.
Nodding minutely, the movement causing his brain to lurch to the side of head, Sherlock steadies himself enough to let go of the countertop. Pinching his eyes shut, he takes a deep breath before opening them again to the twisted sight around him, blinking in an attempt to settle his vision and clear away the unsteadiness, barely able to bloody
Sherlock hardly hears his father's response of 'What are you, a detective now?' before he's bolting out the door to the stables, vision blurring with pure, unadulterated fury.
And with a slap on the back and another knowing brow raise, Mycroft and Greg are gone and John turns back to his roommate with a grin, the blue in his eyes deepening ever so slightly when he's happy. "Guess it's just you and me tonight, then. What do you think? Chinese or Italian?"
Sherlock smiled leaning his forehead down against John's. "Alright, calm down," he muttered and John laughed, reaching for a kiss.
harshly, spilling into John's fist again and again before falling boneless back against him and John releases his grip on Sherlock's spend cock, instead clutching at Sherlock's torso, burying his face in that long damp neck and riding his hips along that gorgeous arse.
"Exquisite," John finishes his sentence, but Sherlock only half-hears it as the blood rushes in his ears and his body shivers.
to get it, nothing making any sense now that he's had John Watson in every sense of the word and won't ever have him again.
John laughed. "Of course you are. Well now we each know a little more about the other. Now I think we can officially be friends."
John lets go as soon as Sherlock has the wherewithal to even his pace with John's and Sherlock silently curses himself for righting his steps. If he'd just slowed a bit, John's hand would still be around his wrist and if he maneuvered just right, he could have slid his palm into John's and-
And suddenly, John's hand is moving again. And Sherlock forgets how to breathe altogether, watching with wide eyes as it creeps closer.
"Well fine," John throws a playful glare at the pair of his friends grinning eagerly at him. "I guess I'll just faff off and let you boys get down to it. Just leave me here all on my own."
"We meet again," Victor attempts to joke though his smile is rather insincere, eyes lingering just long enough on John to make it quite clear he's very aware he isn't welcome here and simply doesn't give a toss.
"Sherlock! It's been ages!" Angelo booms in that deep, growling voice of his, bundling Sherlock to his thick chest. "Where you been, mate? Haven't seen any of the Holmes round this place in too long!"
just came in here to see if you were alright," John shrugs too innocently. Sherlock can see the smirk playing on his lips. "
"Take your shirt off," Sherlock demanded, fingers sliding from John's thighs to his arse and squeezing, emphasizing his eagerness, that now they were both disappearing into a land of urgent lust and needs that have sat dormant for too long between them, that have been begging to be let out and be made known and put to use, that living under a roof together and
Sherlock's face heats on cue. "Oh… no, that- that's okay, I didn't mean… I mean I can walk, it's not that far or anything, I was just… I mean it's not…"
"Sherlock!" Mrs. Hudson admonished as soon as she yanked open the door, but Sherlock was already pushing past her and into 221A, heading for the kitchen.
Sherlock stares because apparently that's all Sherlock can do when in the presence of the rugby captain.
"We're snogging, John," Sherlock murmurs, unwilling to let go long enough to talk this through, gripping a hand on John's hip and yanking him down, forcing them both to groan.
The line was quiet as Sherlock lost it, which was more then he could ever ask for. At least now, he didn't feel so alone.
John couldn't resist. He reached up and traced those plump lips with the tips of his fingers, feeling Sherlock's heated breath over top of them.
"I-well, I...I've never-I don't-" Sherlock stutters through half sentences until he finally sighs. "Everything," he murmurs. "I would...like to learn everything."
"Medicine," John replies, sitting back down to his desk and shuffling his papers and Sherlock takes the moment free of scrutiny to raise his eyes to the ceiling and curse himself to the high heavens.
John sucked in a breath, shivering slightly against Sherlock's touch. Warmth bloomed in Sherlock's chest and he reached a finger under John's chin, tilting his head toward him and dropped a gentle kiss on his lips. "You have nothing to worry about you silly boy," Sherlock whispered over his lips, then disappeared through the doors after Molly, appreciating the knowledge that John was staring dumbfounded after him.
"God," John moans softly, thankful for the music pounding loudly, drowning out his inappropriate noises, cursing to the high heavens for bringing Sherlock out at all tonight considering he now desperately
He can feel how thick Sherlock's saliva is as he swallows, John following the movement with his tongue as it slides down his throat.
When John bloody Watson decided it was a good idea to show up again, hands dug in his pockets, hair wet and skin damp, freshly showered from practice, navy jacket zipped up to his chin accenting his already sparkling blue eyes, giving them a deep glowing affect. His pink lips would curve into a shy smile as Sherlock came sauntering out of the studio looking like a hot mess, baggy sweats covering his skintight tank tops and thin tights.
Greg's smirk holds a thousand words. "Older and wiser, Johnny Boy," he says airily. "Should have been quicker on the draw."
He didn't even give himself time to process the start of Greg's rant as he took off, deciding standing and waiting would do him no good. Circling the crowd like a vulture, John's blue eyes were blazing with determination, deciding not confronting this thing with Sherlock could be worse then rejection, and needing to get on with it before he lost his nerve.
It gives Sherlock a second to catch his breath, to compose himself and to get quite a spectacular view of John Watson's tight arse looking exquisite in snug dark jeans.
Sherlock takes a breath before opening the window, squaring his shoulders and clenching his jaw. He's nervous but he wants to do this. He wants this to be done. He wants things to be
And Sherlock is suddenly trying to remember why he thought bringing John Watson here was such a brilliant idea. Because seeing him now, just inside the doorway of his beloved family home, surrounding by the familiar trimmings that had been a part of his Christmas since he was a boy, it feels much different than a flatmate meeting another flatmate's family. It feels much more intimate. More formal. Like their relationship is something else entirely besides flat sharers and friends.
John huffed, yanking his clothing back up, tying and buttoning anxiously, fingers shaking as they moved. "We can't… we can't do this anymore. This is bad. It's… this is
Especially as John slides a hand down his belly and slips his fingers beneath Sherlock's, taking him in hand and taking over.
The outrage is adorable, Sherlock clearly quite offended by the notion that Mike Stamford would have the audacity to interrupt his private time getting off with John Watson.
John did as he was told, settling his bag on a chair in the office, then turned back and Sherlock herded him out into the hallway to shut and lock his door behind them. He turned and hurried past him toward the exit.
The questions had plagued Sherlock's mind for the entire week after the kiss. The Kiss. Better known in his mind as the Moment When Sherlock Royally Fucked Up. He should have never let it get that far. Ever. He should have had more control. He shouldn't have been overpowered by…
"I'm not afraid," Sherlock snaps immediately before clamping his mouth shut and doubling down on ignoring, focusing on his slides with renewed intensity, shoulders hunched and tense all over. "I'm just not going."
"You can pout all you want," John replies as he turns back to his desk and slumps in his chair, feeling incredibly out of sorts, his body buzzing while his head spins in confusion. "I don't much care. But you should enjoy that little mess of yours while you can because it'll be the last one you make in here."
"What?!" Greg cries, suddenly appearing at Sherlock's shoulder, the rest of the rugby team drifting up behind him, conversations dying down at the sound of their captain hollering. "Jesus Christ Paul, are you serious right now?"
Which made it all the more bizarre when people still hit on Sherlock. According to the rest of the uni students, John and Sherlock were an item, seeing as they were together all the time. A fact John secretly reveled in, hoping if the rumor got out wide enough, he wouldn't have a small panic attack every time someone approached. Although, he denied it when directly asked if they were together, terrified if he didn't and Sherlock found out, their friendship would be over.
Moran immediately dropped his hold and stood at attention. John struggled to do the same as he caught his breath. Neither spoke as Major Holmes stared down Moran.
Stomach clenching uncomfortably at the idea of talking to Paul after a week of silence, John manages a nod. "I will," he bids as Greg offers a sympathetic smile and heads out the door.
Shimmering blue eyes bore into his cloudy gray irises. Sherlock doesn't need a mirror to feel his own pupils dilate.
The man Greg had been ogling only minutes ago stood before him, hands dug into his pockets, sly smile on his face. "And so early in the night," the man continued. "I thought a man of your status wouldn't cower to someone as pathetic as Victor Trevor."
"Sherlock, I swear, if you miss that bloody train, I will not cover for you with mummy," his brother hissed into the phone.
"See," he says rather weakly, dropping the note back to the bed and resisting the urge to flop down on it and sulk.
"I don't really," John said with an embarrassed laugh. "I don't think I'm ready for dead bodies and morgues quite yet. But can I still come? I'll wait in the hall or something. If-if that's okay?" He glanced down. "I'd still like to be a part of it."
Sherlock laid a few more chaste kisses on John's lips, then one against his cheek. John settled back on his heels, realizing he'd been on his toes, as he thought Sherlock was pulling away, but Sherlock followed him down, wrapping his arms further around his waist and holding him in a genuine embrace. John melted into the hug, not realizing how badly he needed someone to hold him like this, and buried his head in Sherlock's neck. He remembered Sherlock holding him in the car last night and he gripped tighter to him, silently thanking him for being there for him, protecting him when he so obviously needed it, even if he didn't know it. Sherlock's grip on him was warm and inviting and a little possessive and John drank it in. He didn't know he had a need to feel possessed like this but being wanted by Sherlock Holmes was... intoxicating. He reveled in it.
John works him through it, only pulling off when Sherlock goes still and makes small uncomfortable noises from oversensitivity.
"Is that so?" Sherlock replies, attempting to look unconcerned, though his cheeks tint a soft pink and John doesn't miss the quietly pleased grin on his face.
That seems to soften Sherlock a bit, beautiful blue marble-like eyes peering up at John through dark lashes, worry swimming in a mix of curiosity, hope and
"You're John Watson?" The guard actually looked surprised and rather pleased all at once. "The John Watson Sherlock is always prattling on about?"
Sherlock frowned. "Because I can't walk home naked," he said slowly, seeming unsure if John would comprehend his words.
Sherlock forced himself to turn back to his bag. He needed to get away from this boy. He was rapidly losing control. "Well, this has been pleasant, and wildly inappropriate Mr. Watson, so if there's nothing else you want-"
Sparks dance along the insides of Sherlock's eyelids as they fall closed, mouth dropping open simultaneously in a gasp, letting himself be rocked by his lover into the sheets, one calf still perched on John's shoulder, the other wrapped around John's waist, drawing Sherlock's body open for further exploration. He knows how much John enjoys his flexibility, something he's been told over and over in moments of heat, John bending him this way and that, eyes widening every time Sherlock's long limbs accommodated new positions.
That apparently was the throat-clearer's cue as he made his way up to the front, smiling winningly at Sherlock, dark brown eyes somehow glittering, wavy chestnut hair falling around his face perfectly. Even without speaking, John could see he was posh as hell, clothing clinging to every fit line of his body, hair perfectly coiffed into place, accessories strategically placed on his person.
He felt the head of his erection hit the back of Sherlock's throat and he cried out, yanking on Sherlock's curls accidentally, panic and pleasure all coursing through him. There was no way he was going to last. "Oh f-fuck, Sherlock, I-I'm going-I can't-I-"
"No," John shook his head fiercely against Sherlock's sternum. "No, I didn't mean any of that, I was just... I don't even know. I don't even remember why I was upset, and I'm so so sorry Sherlock-"
As he went to pull open the door, a lean figure towered over him from behind, spidery fingers pressing against the wood to keep it shut. "John," Sherlock breathed in his ear and John shuddered, arousal striking red hot through his veins. "Don't go."
Sherlock pauses too, suddenly feeling unsure as John gapes at him. "Um, you know the… the things we need to… to have… intercourse."
And it's all because that adorably drunken, red-faced, curly-haired boy that lives in his room had mumbled four soft-spoken, sleepy words and promptly devastated John Watson's entire worldview.
This is not the look of a freshly showered café barista who got off a shift twenty minutes ago. This is not the look of an exhausted employee just off from their first day.
John chuckles softly and moves, gathering up the remaining pages and sliding them into one of Sherlock's books.
Of course that endeavor comes with another person involved which Sherlock literally cannot imagine being anyone besides the boy sitting across from him. The very straight boy who has no romantic interest in any other boy let alone Sherlock Holmes of all people.
So Sherlock, being Sherlock, had intervened. He told himself it was out of curiosity. He told himself it was about data and interest in proving his theories and observations.
And now he was being kind. God, he was fucking perfect. So perfect. John tried to let out a sigh, but it was only half-hearted. "Alright," he murmured. Before properly thinking it over, John slid his palm across the space between then and slipped his hand into Sherlock's gloved one. Without hesitation, Sherlock laced their fingers and settled their joined hands on his lap. John grinned.
"Older and wiser," John mutters sarcastically. "Meaner and dumber, maybe." He subtly flicks a gaze at his boyfriend in a brief sweep for any discomfort but all he gets in return is a challenging glare and a completely relaxed Sherlock Holmes staring back at him, seeming completely calm in the situation, not needing John's protection in the least.
John rolls his hips and Sherlock is panting heavily, never knowing anything could feel this good. John holds him down, arms still bound over his head and Sherlock pushes back and takes it.
He turns to find John eyeing him curiously. "And why does Sherlock Holmes have a giant box of condoms in his room?"
Thank you guys for the love on this story! It's a nice little sidepiece I like to come back to every now and then, and I love that there are people out there enjoying it as much as I am writing it. Cheers!
"You're right, my apologies," Sherlock agrees with an overly furrowed brow, bogus concern etched in his features. "Sally must have just come round for a nice little chat and just
at him right now, a simple lift of each corner of his mouth, brows raised kindly as though he's pleased as punch to be in the Holmes household for Christmas, blissfully unaware of exactly what's going on here. Unaware of exactly how Sherlock
"Great, thank you," John replies in a whoosh of relieved breath. "Anything could happen, you know. Freak accident."
"I think I'd better… I think I'd better not," he tries again, slow-blinking down to the counter, where the beer cans seem to have reappeared, no longer in his arms. When had that happened?
"Besides, you put a lot of effort into tonight," John carries on, still doting on Sherlock's mouth with soft kisses and gentle touches.
Sherlock whirled around so quickly, John immediately dropped his gaze to the table, cheeks burning. John could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, searching every crease and crinkle on his face. John did his best to keep his features neutral.
"Thinking," Sherlock replies with a hint of annoyance in his voice, though he leans into John's touch where his fingers have found their way into wild curls, scratching lightly along his scalp in soothing drags.
to ogle players like they are something to eat. If secondary school had taught Sherlock anything, it's that athletes – particularly rugby players- are well-loved in London, infatuated with and obsessed over.
"Why are you here?" Sherlock said as John took a seat in the chair across from the desk. Never one to beat around the bush, his editor.
Startled slightly out of his raging thoughts by the boisterous, though not unwelcome, voice of his Pong partner, Sherlock attempts not to grin too terribly hard, all thoughts of his irritating brother fading away as he turns back around to find Mike Stamford waving him down, jogging toward him from the muddy rugby field.
Sherlock frowns, looking down to pick at the peeling plastic on the table. "It's just sex," he mumbles. What's the big deal? He's never had it only because he hasn't had the opportunity. Doesn't mean he hasn't thought about it. Or wanted it. Or perhaps conducted several experiments on himself bore from curiosity and raging hormones.
John rushed to him, reaching out a hand. "I don't want this to be a one night stand," he said hastily, shaking his head and laying a hand on Sherlock's forearm.
Jesus, it was so goddamn obvious now, John clenched his jaw to keep the scream from escaping his lips.
A burst of laughter falls from John's lips and he grins at his teammate, finally landing on the same page, realizing exactly what they're talking about and exactly how much they have in common. "My god, you're telling me," John agrees with a shake of his head. "What is it with them?"
"I'm not here to be seen by anyone," Sherlock said coldly. It wasn't a lie. He didn't want to be seen. He wanted to just… observe. And maybe make sure John was okay. And maybe just have a good long look at him for the first time in five days. He didn't realize how much he would miss just seeing him on a regular basis.
"Thank you," John beams, and Sherlock turns just in time to find the radiant smile on John's face is aimed in his direction.
"Pretty much," Irene shrugs. She glances over her shoulder and out into the main room, eyeing the rest of the patrons at the party before turning back. "Look, Sherlock isn't going to watch out for himself. He doesn't realize what he's getting into with Victor. He needs us but he can't know what we're doing. Make sense?"
Sherlock lowered his phone and stared at the screen, feeling better then he had in weeks. The embarrassing truth that he was a mama's boy wasn't something he chose to share with anyone if he could help it and he himself chose not to recognize. He chose to ignore the fact that every time he spoke with his mother, it made him feel exponentially better, and instead pretended he was strong enough not to still need his mum on occasion.
John, for his part, doesn't find anything about his words funny. He glances up at Sherlock for a split second before glancing back to the boy addressing him.
Something had shifted between them. In the span of a single conversation, something had changed. Clicked into place? Corrected itself?
, exactly?" It's Sherlock's turn to get a bit worked up, very much not understanding this conversation at all or why it seems to be the second time he's having it. And what is it with everyone getting on his case about one of the only people who has been nice to him? Victor is perfectly harmless, maybe a bit dull even. But he's
Sherlock sighed. This boy really wasn't going to make this easy for him. And a small, twisted part of him was so glad he wasn't backing down. He was enjoying seeing the fight John had in him.
John glared after him. What the hell did that mean? This was his house. Why would he knock on his own door? John stood on the doorstep for a moment longer before scraping his key into the lock, deciding to ignore Sherlock's cryptic statement. Bloody lunatic, probably just wanted to make him wait a moment longer to suffer with the raging hard-on he had from that stupid snog. Bastard.
Sherlock bites down on the disappointment of having John Watson encouraging him to date someone else and focuses on his words.
Glancing up toward the building looming in front of them and fighting the effort not to grin or, god forbid,
And before he can even ask a question to John's shock, and utter horror, Victor Trevor walks in through the opening, dressed in sweats and a hoodie and somehow still looking posh, and, if John isn't mistaken, rather smug, seeming quite pleased with himself.
The shocked look on John's face was almost enough to pull Sherlock out of his anger but not quite. He didn't want to hurt him but he didn't want this from John if the only reason John was doing it was because he assumed Sherlock wanted it. And dammit, he wanted to go slowly. He wanted these things to
The blush that instantly heated Sherlock's sharp cheekbones was so bloody precious, John could have kissed each one twice. Something tightened in his chest, completely thrilled with himself for eliciting this lovely reaction on those domineering features, wishing he had more then one opportunity a week to do so.
Face going ghostly pale, John takes a step back as though slapped by Sherlock's words. "What?" he says softly, looking bewildered and… hurt?
Huffing an irritated sigh down at himself, Sherlock tugs each cuff of his plain black button-down to lay neatly along his wrists, makes one last pass with his palms down the front of his shirt in an ill-fated attempt to smooth out any wrinkles, knowing full well if there are any creases they won't be removed by a simple brush of a hand, and squares his shoulders. Drawing himself up to his full height, Sherlock dives head first into the abyss.
Hands on his hips, lips on his neck, fingers in his hair...all limbs belonging to the new stable boy that now roams his property.
"Fuck yes," John can't quite keep himself from blurting out, offering an apologetic smile when Sherlock chuckles softly, glancing up beneath his dark eyelashes to grin at his boyfriend and John's knees nearly give out at the
It takes him a solid minute to have the wherewithal to follow, head spinning with what the hell just happened and what exactly it means for his situation.
Mycroft is eyeing him carefully, scrutinizing his every move, every twitch. John shrinks slightly beneath the gaze, entirely unsure how to react as the silence stretches out between them uncomfortably. He fidgets slightly in his seat, staring stupidly back at the clearly important man sitting across from him.
"Uh oh," Sherlock mutters, pushing back from the desk and rising hastily from his chair, still watching the mixture with interest.
"W-What?" Sherlock stammers. He's still a bit dazed. Though he does notice John is not dressed for formal, in jeans and a black t-shirt.
Sherlock's hips gave several, hard thrusts as he chased his own orgasm, gasping into John's ear with scattered breathes, body shaking atop John's. John held him tighter, clenching around Sherlock, wanting to deliver him as much pleasure as Sherlock had given him. The guttural cry that ripped from Sherlock's lips was so gorgeous, John preened slightly in his own sweating, sticky state, clutching to the man he loved so desperately.
The man's brows knitted together in confusion. "Really? That's your question? You're not shocked that Mike is bisexual or that he was about to hit on you?"
Sherlock's elbows buckle and he just about drops down heavily but John's hands catch him, laying his palms against Sherlock's shoulder blades and lowers him down. Sherlock lets himself be manhandled as John kicks his feet out from under him, allowing Sherlock to lay flat against him, back to front, panting and sweaty and so unbelievably satisfied he could fall asleep right this very minute.
"Um," John's throat is suddenly very dry. How on earth does he explain Sherlock or the reaction he's stirred quite spectacularly in John? "I don't uh… he's alright."
He tugs off his gloves and unhooks his helmet, panicked as he searches. "John?" he calls as he gets closer.
His thoughts were cut off as he watched a tiny sliver of skin peek out from John's jumper as he raised his arms over his head and stretched. Sherlock watched the jumper ride up slightly, revealing a tanned mid-section and dirty blonde hairs trailing down and disappearing under his trouser waistband. God, he was fit. All hard but smooth muscles, runners muscles, with a bit of bulk from the years of rugby, and when in the hell had that become Sherlock's type? He swallowed thickly, gripping his fingers together behind his back to resist the urge to touch. They were in a morgue for Christ's sake. How unsexy is that?
John can't keep up but he still seems thrilled to be a part of it, following in Lestrade's car and grinning when he arrives finding Sherlock pinning a suspect to the ground.
John stayed silent for long enough to make Sherlock concerned before he finally agreed. "Alright. Fine."
Though, he only gets a split second to enjoy it before his back is smacking wetly against the ground and his roommate is no longer on him but beside him, arm still slung around his waist, giggles racking the body beside him so loudly Sherlock can't help joining in.
John pouted, sticking his bottom lip out as far as he could. "Why not? You'll like it, I promise. I'm really good." John heard an annoyed huff and pouted even more. "Please? I'll make it so good for you," he crooned, knowing for sure he sounded super sexy.
"So what do you do then?" John asked, feeling rude for talking about someone sitting right next to them.
Sherlock rounded the table, storming closer to where John was sitting, his body vibrating with anger. "Feel sorry for you?" he spat, "Do you think I dole out sympathy so easily? I hate to break this to you, seeing as you're so hell bent on believing no one does, but I care about you John and witnessing what happened to you hurt me. And it wasn't because I felt bad about kissing you, because frankly, I don't. I wanted to kiss you and I did because I do what I fucking want to."
The grin John throws at him could light up the cloudy sky of London any day of the week. "Good, that's settled. It's Friday night at seven. Don't be late."
He looked completely ridiculous and completely enthralled and John loved absolutely every single inch of him.
John was indescribable during sex. He was eager and wanting and so bloody gorgeous, not to mention the chemistry they had in bed. It was unreal. Sherlock reveled in it.
-" John gasped into Sherlock's mouth, hips bucking into the touch. "Fuh- oh fuck me. Christ Sherlock, fuck me."
"Mm," Sherlock replies, taking a beat to down a gulp of water. "Yes," he mutters weakly down to his drink.
"He was yelling at me while I was doing press-ups and said- he said 'your meetings won't change anything.' I didn't think anything of it at the time. He squished it into a bunch of other things he was yelling, but now…"
John sits meters from him at a different table with his rugby team, avoiding his eyes, shooting pained smiles as his mates laugh and jostle him around, taking jabs at each other like the morons they are. He has no color in his cheeks, no brightness in his eyes. He looks dreadful.
The giggles turn into downright belly laughs as John clutches at his stomach, shoulders shaking up and down. "I would have loved to see that," he gasps.
"Beer Pong and football aren't the same thing, Mike," John rolls his eyes. "Besides, you're getting a little grabby with my partner and I think I'd rather you be a bit further from him." He throws a grin in Sherlock's direction and the genius boy attempts to huff indignantly while simultaneously fighting off the smile curving his lips.
John could feel the color draining from his face, unsure of how to respond, unsure if he could respond. He gaped upward, losing himself in those silver eyes.
Sherlock grabs for one of John's hands next to his elbow. "No!" he whispers desperately. "No, please, don't stop."
Fire rages on fiercely beneath his skin, filling his chest to the brim and racing along every nerve ending he has, and John hasn't forgotten exactly what it feels like to want so urgently but he'd certainly been otherwise occupied and when he sees it, sees his lover read his body language, sees the inferno blazing in blue eyes, Sherlock's own dilate in return and from there, it's all over.
Brushing fingers through his curls, John makes a soft, precious sound, lips finding Sherlock's again with reverence. "Always," he repeats.
"Fuck, ohhhh fuck," Sherlock muttered, wriggling his hips against John's hand, fingers digging into the sheets beneath him.
He doesn't remember asking Sherlock over and over if he was alright the first time they made love, always being so careful with him.
Sherlock turns sharply to his seatmate, eyes giant. "How'd you know?" he blurts before thinking better of it.
Sherlock blinks, as those two words bounce around his brain before settling and allowing him to process them and-
, frozen in abject horror, the color in his cheeks so severe John can't quite help himself, the sight to pure and perfect to do anything else.
In fact, this unusual and rather elusive roommate he now has had already mucked up his plans good and proper within the first hour of being on campus.
John's mouth curved into a knowing grin and he huffed a small laugh. "I just…" he sighed, seeming to already feel silly about what he was about to say. "I can't believe that I know someone like you."
His captain simply laughs, shaking his head and spinning on his heel. "I'll see you tonight Johnny Boy."
A soft, special smile turns John's mouth upward beautifully and Sherlock has to kiss it, has to taste that happy grin on John's face.
And Sherlock turns his head into his pillow to cover the sob escaping his lips and doesn't say a word.
"Inside joke with the rest of the dancers," Sherlock muttered. "Because of my deductions, I was able to catch an employee stealing from Rick a few weeks back. They started calling me The Detective and I needed a stage name anyway so…" He rolled his hand threw the air to finish the sentence.
But Christ those eyes, crystal blue and shining bright and all-consuming, John is lost in that stunning gaze staring back at him like he's some sort of wonder, like he's done something so unexpected and so wonderful, like he's something to be treasured and kept. It's a jolt to his system, a lightning bolt through the heart the way Sherlock Holmes is looking at John Watson, so much more than lust though of course that shines brightest but encircling it is something else entirely, something powerful and precious, something tempering the heat in his eyes, stoking the fire and making it last, not just for tonight but forever more, burning lasting embers between them that glow boldly with silent promises and answers to unasked questions.
Sherlock, somehow managing only to touch his lips to John's forehead and nothing else, made a pained sound. "I'm sorry," he whispered, "We can stop." He moved to pull away.
John, like that-" Sherlock starts to babble as John starts to fuck him harder, effectively bouncing Sherlock in his lap.
He walks a fine line every day of desperately wanting John by his side, and never wanting to see him again. It's unbelievably painful to be near him.
Mycroft breaks the squabble with a sigh, shaking the umbrella slightly to let loose the water gathering at the top. Sherlock watches John through the thicker rainfall, creating a rather picturesque scene, fighting down a soft smile as Mike tackles a laughing John into the mud, several other boys joining in as they dash around the dirty field, kicking up all kinds of filth and looking happy as ever. A twinge of jealousy pinches Sherlock's gut, silently wishing he were somehow involved in the activities before him, wishing he were included in unplanned rainy afternoon roughhousing, wishing he was something more than simply the odd roommate stalking along the path in hopes of catching a glimpse of tan skin and blue eyes.
He'd spent the day entirety of Sunday preparing, washing, making and then remaking his bed, carefully ironing his favorite jeans and creasing his collared shirt to perfection, and then soaked his body in a hot bath before scrubbing every inch of himself until he was red and raw and ready, fixing his curls and dabbing just a gentle hint of cologne on his wrist, keeping his hands and mind busy with preparing for what is probably the biggest moment of his life but since he hasn't truly let himself sit down to think about it too hard without starting to have the beginnings of a panic attack, Sherlock practically jumps out of his skin at the sound of the doorbell.
"You sure you're okay?" Victor is eyeing him carefully from where he stands looming over the genius, hands clasped in front of him.
By 5PM the panic has all but swallowed him whole as John glances stealthily at his phone sitting in his palm for the 90th time as he walks toward the rugby pitch, waiting for the screen to come to life with a text alert from Sherlock Holmes that hasn't come all fucking day.
It takes all of two hours before Irene is grinning up at him as they walk in to the studio after school, looking for all the world like the cat who got the cream, eyes glinting with knowledge.
"Don't play dumb with me, Sherlock. You are well-aware that I want you. Don't pretend like its some major revelation."
He feels a bit guilty now as he watched her shuffle her hooves. She's restless being cooped up in her stall all the time.
A soft hum escapes John's lips and then the boy is bringing his free hand up to take the items of Sherlock, condom and a small packet of lubricant. He sits back on his knees, both hands leaving Sherlock's body to work open the packets, first the condom – Sherlock watches as he rolls it onto his cock, biting his lip at the sight of John practically touching himself - then the lube, tearing it open and squeezing some first onto his palm and then his cock, stroking up and down to smear it around.
The doctor blinks rapidly, seemingly having some sort of internal debate. In the end, he slumps slightly and looks down. "Well. Good luck."
"Yeah, yeah you had me alright," the blond shrugs him off, fighting off a grin of his own. Over the weeks of practice, these boys have become like family to him. He can't help but appreciate a little jabbing here and there, feeling rather accepted in this group of kind gentlemen he'd stumbled upon. Even if they are a bunch of tossers, all still hooting and hollering over their shared joke at his expense.
They settled into familiar banter as John made himself dinner, forgoing the takeaway he didn't want to eat alone. He switched on the telly after Sherlock had sauntered off to his room, reemerging a half an hour later looking perfectly coiffed and perfectly sexy in his usual dark trousers and fitted button down.
"I just don't want it to be a big deal," Sherlock counters, ears going hot at John's blunt vulgarity. "Plus it would be nice to get it out of the way before uni. No use in bringing that lovely reputation as a freak to a whole other school."
The part of the day when he is awake far earlier than anyone in his household, usually having hardly slept, and slips out into the cool foggy morning.
Sherlock halts his frantic pulling and pushing and settles back under on the sheets at John's quiet words.
Sherlock stopped short of reaching his arms around him and cautiously looked around. He then lunged for John's wrist and pulled him behind the building and out of sight.
Sherlock fidgets slightly at any comment that hints of something more. Sherlock always looks away, never able to look John in the eye during one of these moment, and blushes - oh god, the
Exhaling through his nose in irritation, Sherlock rolls his eyes and looks back at his book in front of him, trying and failing not to be completely humiliated. He should have seen that, should have been able to tell that Irene is gay. Stupid,
"I gotta go," John mumbled, an unhealthy swell of panic wafting through him. He stood abruptly, almost knocking his coffee to the floor in his haste, barely noticing as he hurried to the door.
Sherlock is shocked at how much that thought arouses him. Getting caught. Getting caught with his dick in John's mouth. He audibly groans at the thought.
John was scared as hell. Sherlock glared at him as he spoke. "I-I thought you'd...want that," John spluttered, so obviously confused and humiliated and lost. Sherlock placed his hands firmly on John's shoulders.
"Are you alright?" he snapped, angrier then he'd meant but unable to stop the panic and fear from coming into his words.
In all honesty, Sherlock had sort of assumed this is exactly how his boyfriend would handle being injured: ignore it, deny it, claim all is well until his dying breath the stubborn arse that he is, and Sherlock bloody well knew it didn't he, why he thought for even a moment John would allow himself to be managed and cared for and babied a little now completely beyond him as they stand staring at each other having a silent face-off, glaring the other down, waiting to make the first move.
Closing his eyes against the wave of intense feeling that washed over him, a small sob escaped John's lips. Something deep in his chest ached heavily, his emotions all warring for dominance within him; fear, arousal, vulnerability... it was making him panic.
"Mm," Sherlock murmurs with a nod as one of the men on the screen, presumably Bing Crosby, begins to sing a simple rendition of White Christmas and the curly-haired boy realizes he agrees with John's assessment as the voice coming from the surround-sound seems to seep into his skin, warming him all over. He grips his warm mug between his hands and eases back a bit, the buzzing of his slight frame finally calming, unsure if it's the music or the rum or the company that's making him feel rather content.
Startling slightly when his older brother looks away from him and down toward the field where the voice calling an unfamiliar name is coming from, Sherlock follows his gaze with a frown. Who the hell is Myc? And why would Mycroft concern himself finding out?
Truth be told, he hadn't considered what John would be to him at all. He'd been solely concerned about what John needed.
It's the most sensual foreplay they've ever had, neither moving to go further, basking in the closeness, lingering in aching touches, leaving no body part untouched, no groan unkissed, trailing tips of fingers along wet skin, dragging tongues against damp lips.
John's certain he's drooling. He's biting his lip hard to keep from making any sounds, shoving his hands into his pockets to keep from touching his own cock and watches. Simply watches Sherlock experiment with plucking at his nipples, hand moving slowly beneath his pants, body rolling in time with his ministrations.
"Ah," John nods soundly, more to himself than anyone else, seeming to have cleared the nasty fog that had clouded his precious features, coming back around again. "Sorry. I thought you'd come for…" John waves a limp hand in the general direction of where Sherlock is standing beside him, looking a bit confused at his own thoughts before righting himself yet again with a tilt of his head, making some internal decision before sitting back on his heels a bit, the edge in his posture waning to relaxed again. "So you're roommates with Paul," he reiterates. Sherlock glances down at the bottle perched in John's grasp and wonders if that small amount of alcohol has already gone to John's head. Poor bloke is being a bigger idiot than usual. A
He ignores Lestrade's annoying bumblings of reintroducing himself and makes his way up the steps. He slips into the room where the body of a middle-aged woman lies on her side. He kneels close and does what he does best; he observes.
. Trust me, there are very few Cadets who are as interested in making friends as they are in rising in the ranks quickly."
And with those parting words, Sherlock exited the room, leaving the writers to sort themselves, and John to wallow in his misery.
At the time, Sherlock had been so inexperienced with any sort of thing like this. He wasn't disliked during secondary school, nor teased, though looking back on it now it probably had less to do with how well-liked he was and more to do with how well-liked
Mike had an odd look on his face that John couldn't quite decipher. His mouth was hanging open slightly and his eyes seemed to be glossed over. His brow was knitted together and he was staring. Staring at John.
He rounded the corner of the small room where several officers were filing out, grumbling and looking irritated. John reached up on his toes to look over shoulders to see a dark figure crouching in the middle of the floor, coat splayed out around him, head bent. He looked like a fucking superhero about to take off into the night, and John was lost for a moment, barely noticing the odd looks the officers were giving him as they pushed passed. Once the room cleared, he stood in the doorway with Lestrade, staring down at Sherlock's back, memorized by that strong back holding so still.
Sherlock shuffles his feet and adjusts the frames on his face, looking anywhere but at the blond boy. "Do you…do you want to come to mine later? Like…after school or something?"
Sherlock slides into a cab, barks an address at the driver and silently sets about gathering his memories of love and happiness and John Watson.
SORRY THIS CHAPTER TOOK A WHILE! Life got in the way, a bit. I guess that whole getting this done in a month was totally off, yeah? SORRY! I'll try to be better about updates!
"Oh come on," she says in exasperation. "It's not hard to miss those longing looks in the hallway or the fact that you attend every rugby game."
John ducks and takes the tip of Sherlock's cock in his mouth. He engulfs the entire length and begins sucking in earnest, grinning around Sherlock's cock as the boy keens, gripping John's hair and throwing his hips up.
After a full week of frustratingly teasing text messages, Friday was here. John hadn't seen Sherlock at all in five days.
John stands uncomfortably in the doorway, glancing around the flat, hands twitching at his sides against his crutches.
?" was the best thing John could come up with after he couldn't settle on one of the thousand questions he had.
Sherlock had nodded and dropped down in the chair across from him. "How do you feel about the violin?"
"Unfair," John whispered, figuring it was useless to try to hide how turned on his was. He kept his body pressed to Sherlock's, overly enjoying the touch. "So you're just going to tease me until you see fit?" God that sounded positively miserable.
. He internally battled with disappointment, relief, anxiety and embarrassment in the blink of an eye, trying to process what and why the hell those words had just come out of Sherlock's mouth. He noticed the cabby eyeing them in the review-mirror but he ignored him. "Wh- I didn't-That wasn't-…" John sighed. There was never a point on lying to Sherlock. "Why not?" he decided on, as childish as it sounded. Truthfully, waiting just sounded so much worse then getting it over with. He didn't want to be in too deep when he was officially rejected. That just seemed cruel.
he had a gorgeous bloke who had expressed deep interest in him and damn it all to hell, he wanted him. So badly. So badly it ached. Almost worse then when he thought he had no chance at all. He wanted to touch him, to be touched by him, to learn each other's bodies, to feel and listen and give and take and
"Says societal standards," Sherlock volleys back, gathering himself enough to roll his eyes and ignore his burning cheeks.
The hand in his shifts and tugs a bit and Sherlock glances up to find John smiling warmly at him, blue eyes bright with a fondness Sherlock is so used to seeing in the privacy of their bedroom he's a bit startled by the affect it has on him out in a public setting.
"Eh, it could be worse," John waves away and just as he's preparing to jump head first into this conversation, Sherlock is a bit startled at John chuckles and shoots him a grin. "What other depressing things should we talk about next?"
John, however, isn't listening. With one single look to Sherlock and another back to Seb, John seems to read the situation like an open book. The veins in his neck are protruding with vigor, popping colorfully from his neck as he clenches his jaw tightly. His fingers close tighter around Sherlock's delicate knuckles, physically restraining himself. "We're not pretending," he grinds out through gritted teeth, shifting slightly forward while tugging Sherlock a pace behind him as though to physically shield him from any harmful words spoken about him.
"Alright," Greg calls and John turns to find his captain strolling up hand-in-hand with none other than Mycroft Holmes, looking as casual as can be in a three-piece suit, a giant umbrella opened neatly over both their heads. "We're here. What's all this about then?"
"That chemical compound equation?" Irene suddenly perks up in her chair from where she'd been slouched, eyeing both Victor and Sherlock carefully for almost the entire hour, hardly paying much attention to the task at hand let alone participating. It hadn't gone unnoticed by the genius; he'd just simply ignored it seeing as there is a project he needs to have completed within the next three days and has no time for slacking partners.
And as much as Sherlock wants to blame Victor Trevor for making a fool of him, blame him for the loss of the most important thing he's ever had in his life, he can't. Because he knows it's not true.
"Oh, all kinds of things," Sherlock ventures out a little further from his comfort zone, the conversation coming far easier than he'd thought possible. "The teachers at my secondary school were complete idiots. I had to conduct my own experiments just to learn something. Though I'm quite certain we would have never tested the flammability of wool socks in class."
John was nodding before he'd even processed what he was agreeing to, his blonde fringe rubbing against Sherlock's dark chest hairs. His eyelids grew heavy in the heat of Sherlock's skin as he burrowed deeper under the covers and into Sherlock with a wide yawn.
"Yes," John groaned clutching impossibly tighter, as though afraid Sherlock would put him down if he didn't. Like that was even the faintest of possibilities right at this moment.
before everyone gets there. No one wants to smell the pitch and your long-since-dried sweat while they attempt to enjoy a beer."
"Irene?" John asks with a tilt of his head, still grinning. "Sherlock Holmes, did you ask Irene for help on how to take me on a date?"
"You're kidding, right?" he murmured, allowing the amusement play across his face. John glared at him.
By the grace of God alone, Sherlock was able to stay standing as John's blue eyes shined wetly, chewing at his bottom lip in an attempt to keep the tears from falling. He looked down at the floor, blinking furiously and Sherlock took the opportunity to lean against the wall.
Sherlock's mouth coaxed John's to respond to it, calm presses of lips and rolls of tongues, John's hands clinging to Sherlock's curls. It was intoxicating, the attention Sherlock paid to every moan and gasp he elicited from John's mouth.
Wriggling out of his grasp, John tosses a playful punch into his friend's ribs. "Yeah, I told you that in confidence, thanks," he attempts to scold, though his lips twitch up in a good-natured grin.
to be apart from him. It makes Sherlock ache in places he didn't realize he had, forcing loneliness back into his world where it doesn't belong, twisting his stomach and his heart and his head all up in knots with the sheer knowledge that not only was Sherlock Holmes never meant to be alone; he is meant to be with John Watson very specifically.
Except for translucent eyes that are trained on John's and dark hair that it matted back off his forehead and pretty pink lips that are wrapped around his shaft, John sees nothing else.
Blinking away the last of the stubborn tears still stinging his eyes and staying as still as possible, hoping maybe if he doesn't move John might forget he's there entirely and leave without another word, Sherlock doesn't dare turn around, doesn't dare to
John looked so confused and scared it tugged violently at Sherlock's heart, staring into those beautiful blue eyes, blazing with concern and fear.
Three rounds later, the three of them were giggling madly and John had all but forgotten about his exchange with Sherlock. He didn't want to worry about that now. Right now he wanted to see what this club could potentially hold for him. What this life could possibly be like.
Today, Sherlock will not dwell on Mary Morstan's arm linked in John Watson's as he passes them in the hallway.
"You getting dramatically upset over such menial tasks like schoolwork is tiresome, John," Sherlock continued, clearly unaware he was poking a very angry bear. Or, maybe he was aware and simply didn't care. "I was merely offering a solution."
The pink in his face promptly darkens seven shades into a deep, horrified red, gaze trained on the pillow like a magnet drawn to its mate, unable to look away, unable to look at
"We all have shit days, John," Molly soothed, refilling his coffee mug. "We all say stupid things we don't mean. Just go apologize. It'll make you feel better, trust me."
John shakes his head. "You don't. Really, you don't, Sherlock. I'm just," he shakes his head incredulously. "I'm married," he murmurs. "I'm married and I didn't know. It's...alarming."
Even in the low lighting, Sherlock can see the pink kissing each of the apples in John's cheeks. "What?" the rugby player attempts to ask though the fact that he's refusing to even look at Sherlock tells the entire story.
So, he hides. He's made himself scarce, found a cozy spot in the back of the library, and hidden himself away to avoid any sort of invite or smile or sleepy 'good morning' from that perfect athlete he's been focusing all his attention on.
Forget that the world outside this room could come down on their heads if anyone ever found out about what they'd done. This alone could be the end of them both.
Standard procedure, he unhinges the latch and shoves the glass frame upward, then turns before John has even moved to rummage through his closet.
He's changed his mind at least eighteen times by the time 7pm rolls around on Sunday evening, the magnitude of what's about the happen only made real two hours prior when John had text him after radio silence for 48 hours:
That may or may not be just a taste of what is on its way with this story. Sorry for that mother of a chapter but I hope it was worth it! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE LOVE SO FAR! You guys are amazing!
John's heart sinks just slightly, concern roiling harshly in his belly, fear creeping along close behind at what could have possibly caused his teammate to look quite like this.
"Are you sure?" John rushes out before descending on his mouth again like he can't bear the thought of not kissing Sherlock in this moment. "I don't want to hurt you."
His father limps toward the kitchen. "Actually," his father huffs a laugh, "it was John who finally caught her."
exactly?!" John demands back, snickering quietly at the offended glare his boyfriend shoots him, clearly none too pleased by not only John's participation in this situation but the fact that he's doing nothing but egging it on.
thank you very much, grey eyes staring in horror at his darkest secret being splayed out in public like this for all the world to see, for
but- and of course you can say no, obviously, you don't have to, and I wouldn't be upset or anything and it's completely up to you if you want to or-"
John cocked his head. Was that all there was to this meeting? Just a friendly check-in? Wasn't that for his direct superior to do with him, not a Major of all people? "Uh-Fine."
Victor didn't give a lick about Sherlock Holmes' big, beautiful brain or his annoying-yet-endearing unsafe and unsanitary experiments, or his quirky sleep habits or his no-nonsense attitude about anything he deemed boring. He didn't care that Sherlock's favorite takeaway was Thai, and he didn't care that Sherlock reads Chemistry textbooks for fun and he didn't care that Sherlock has hardly ever had any friends, much less any type of romantic relationship.
' is hardly a blip on his radar anymore. Sure he could cough up a few choice scenes where big, mean arseholes tossed him into lockers and called him a freak or a faggot or a loser during secondary school, and of course he could remember several memorable pummelings he'd been on the receiving end of while blokes three times his size spat venom down at his broken body. He's got plenty of those to choose from.
John presses his lips together to hide the grin threatening to spread over his features and pretends to think it over. "Well I
"Experiment, yes I know. And sometimes experiments go wrong. So go on and do them somewhere they are meant to be done and leave my living area out of it, alright?"
The familiar ache returns at the pit of Sherlock's stomach when he realizes all too quickly that this will obviously not end in fucking.
John lifts Sherlock's hand to his mouth and brushes a kiss across his knuckles. The hitched breath in Sherlock's throat is accompanied by a spin of his heart and several gasps from across the cafeteria.
"Fuck off," John bit, turning his back to his exhausting roommate and flinging his bag onto the bed.
John's pupils are blown to the brink, a sliver of navy still circling black but only just, his chest and cheeks pink as a grapefruit, stomach muscles clenched and gorgeous where he's crunched upward to reach for Sherlock. His tanned fingers trace the edge of the genius boy's jaw, curling beneath and stroking a thumb along his chin. He looks sinfully delicious splayed out in the sheets naked with his lover between his thighs and Sherlock is becoming desperate to devour him.
"Think it over," the woman said. John turned to look at Sherlock who was scowling at the back of the woman's head.
"Stop," Sherlock said coolly. "Just because I'm asking you stay here doesn't mean I want to talk to you. Truthfully, I don't want to hear what you have to say. It's been ten years and I just... there really isn't much to say. You made your choices and… that's it. We will keep it strictly professional. We will work together. We will stop these attacks on your friends. But that's it. I don't want to talk to you about anything else. Understood?"
His roommate didn't move a muscle. He lay still on his bed, fingers pressed together under his chin. "John," he acknowledged.
"Jesus, yes," John whispers, cock throbbing, pleasure rippling all along his frame, the warmth of the body against his doing nothing but spurring him on and on, Sherlock's filthy words ratcheting his arousal up several ticks.
"What would be the point of that?" Irene grumbles, "I'm not the one interested in cute boys in shorts."
," Irene's face twists into a mocking sneer as she practically spits the words back at him. "You are too stupid to see it so I'm telling you this now; be fucking careful with him. Seriously. I don't like anything about this. Besides, you're basically taken. He needs to back off. He's practically foaming at the mouth over you."
John bit back a frustrated sigh. "Victoria, I cannot accept that. First of all, I don't even have a job-"
The genius he shares a room with doesn't deign to dignify that with an answer, busying himself with a plethora of slides scattered around his desk and focusing his eyes into the microscope lenses again, ignoring the question and conversation altogether.
No, Sherlock will take care of it. He will take care of it without sounding an alarm and forcing John to come to his rescue like his two kind yet unhelpful friends here would do.
Just like he'd tried to convince himself that coming to the pub was because he wanted a drink. Not because he wanted to see John.
As the door closed, Sherlock bit back an irritated growl. He didn't want to give Mycroft the satisfaction, but how dreadful it was to know that even his own brother knew he couldn't give John what he needed. He was sure Mycroft knew all about yesterday morning's incident from his damned cameras placed strategically outside the door of Sherlock's flat. Surely he witnessed John helping Sherlock home, staying in his flat for God knows how long, taking care of him like he was some sort of weakling.
"Anything," is the immediate response from the boy beneath him, practically moaning as Sherlock traces a pink nipple, biting his lip as he watches it pebble to hardness before he drags a finger pad over top it, swallowing his own groan as John squirms. "Fuck,
"Die? Why would you care John? I'm such a pest, such an inconvenience for you, giving you a home and a job and a fucking life again, I know it's just the worst for you, so why would you give a flying fuck if I-"
"Ah," Greg nods in understanding toward John, then back to Mycroft with a fixed brow raise. "And what does John's 'intentions' have to do with
Now, kneeling before this incredible genius of a boy stripped bare and beautiful before him cradling his skull and caressing his skin, John knows in an absolute sort of way that this right here this is what being in love looks like. This is what being in love
The man did actually laugh this time but didn't respond. John grinned harder at the sight, lost in this man's smile. "Hey, what's your name?" The words tumbled out of his mouth and suddenly his brain snapped into place. "Wait, how did you know my name? And how did you know I want to be a doctor?" He paused for a moment, furrowing his brow. "And why did you want to help me save my friendship with Mike?" The questions were falling out of his mouth with ease now and John had to close his lips tightly yet again.
Sherlock giggles a happy little sound that makes John hate himself just a little bit more and settles impossibly closer, cuddling into John as tight as he can.
But then the Pong tournament had started and Victor had stormed off like an overgrown child and John's internal animal had snorted a satisfied breath and sauntered back into its cage, still awake but not nearly as alert.
"So sad, isn't it?" Victor murmured in his ear. "That gorgeous body should be a crime. And look at you, lusting after it like some schoolboy. So pathetically sad."
He bites his lip at the memory of where those came from. John's rough, calloused hands did that. John's teeth did that.
John smiles to himself, picturing a tiny Sherlock chasing after flying yellow and black creatures with a jar in hand, hoping to capture just one he could keep. "That sounds nice," John replies softly, daring to take a step forward.
"You scared me," John bites back, covering a sob with pinched lips. "You scared the hell out of me."
He doesn't reach for Sherlock immediately and it crushes the curly-haired boy. Even in his furious state, he still craves John's touch.
John couldn't move. He'd really never considered how his parents would react when they found out he was gay. Truthfully he hadn't given it much thought. They hadn't cared when he made the rugby team, barely batted an eye when he made captain. They had hardly even registered that he was going to uni, leaving him to get himself moved and paid for. Never had they been concerned about anything in his life before. Why would this affect them? His parents had done a remarkable job of being absent while present. Why would things change now when he was no longer around? And why did they care if he was gay?
Sherlock shrugged. He'd truly never thought about getting credit. It wasn't for anyone else. It was for him. To keep his mind from imploding. Whoever else his work benefitted was never at the forefront of his mind.
He watches as his friends file off the field, laughing and jostling each other as they go, not a care in the world, completely unaware of their teammate lingering uneasily at their bench, completely unsure of what to do with himself.
"I've got you, love," Sherlock murmured, winding an arm around John as he turned to him. "I'm right here." He stroked a calming hand through John's hair, pulling him close under the blankets and holding him, John's cheek landing on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock bolts upright from where he'd fallen asleep on his desk at the sound of the door slamming open. He scrambles for his glasses, shoves them on his face and turns to see a very flushed John Watson standing in the doorway.
It's a bit silly, daydreaming about such a specific scenario, one Sherlock can't actually picture happening in real life since, frankly, he'd gotten something pretty damn close a few weeks ago when John introduced him to the rugby boys as his boyfriend, but still, it stirs something low in his belly, something that's been getting gradually less dormant since John Watson entered his world and flipped it on its head and Sherlock grits his teeth as the early stages of an erection threaten to tighten his trousers.
"Oh," Sherlock's heart drops to his stomach at the thought of going back to his room, the pain of what he knows he'll find there too much to bear. "I… I can't."
Sherlock held tight to his hand but seemed to mentally retreat. "You'll see." Then he sat back, pulled out his phone and leaned back against the seat.
The touch of John's mouth against Sherlock's sends a rather serious zing straight to his pounding heart, and he hums softly.
He can't even appreciate being bound in his favorite piece of cloth. He drops his gaze, trying to blink back the tears.
Staring for a moment longer than necessary before a grin breaks out on his face, John is suddenly giggling, reaching for Sherlock's mug and taking it from his hands, depositing both of their cups on the coffee table before standing.
"Awe, it's our last day together," Seb sneers into his ear, his words dripping with sarcasm as he takes his old seat behind him, clearly unconcerned with alphabetical order for the stage call. "How will I survive without hearing about your precious John every day?"
"I know you've been keeping out of your room at all costs but you haven't... I mean that's all you've done, right? Just the library and the labs?"
Sherlock burst through the back doors of the building purposefully forceful, banging the door hard against the wall, hoping to startle and stop anything going on in the shadows.
John couldn't help but smile back. The kid reminded him a little of Mike, all confident but kind and he stuck out his hand. "No kidding. I'm John. John Watson."
Mycroft glared. "Sherlock is not yours to play with, John," he said coldly. "You don't get to play these games with my brother. He may let you because he doesn't know any better, but I won't stand for it. I've known plenty of boys like you. You don't stand a chance with a Holmes."
Huffing out a curse under his breath, Sherlock readjusts the strap on his shoulder as his school books shift in his book bag. "Anderson," he smiles insincerely, eyes flickering over the small group of footballers passing him by, all of which have some sort of girl hanging off their arm, all of whom are laughing at the display like the imbeciles that they are. "Always a pleasure."
He says it with such casualty, John wonders if he's simply being honest. "Okay fine," John challenges, " your brother
"This wasn't my brilliant idea!" Greg snaps immediately, attempting and failing not to laugh. "Why am I being blamed for dragging us all out here?"
John rolled his eyes. "You know what. That deducing thing. Even so many years later, it's still impressive."
to hate, not to waste any energy on negativity like that, and he's truly never met someone he out and out
John laughed too as he readjusted himself on the couch, gripping his tea mug. "Okay, so the, uh, deduction thing. How did that all come about, then? Where did you learn to do that?"
They lay in the silence for a moment, the love between them wrapping snuggly around them, kisses turning to caresses and nudges and soft hums.
"If you need to throw up, let me know," John says beside him kindly. "It's alright, okay? Nothing to be ashamed of. It'll only make you feel better."
Biting down harshly on a cry threatening to burst free from his throat, Sherlock is just about to start up the begging again, about to plead for John to touch his neglected cock, sitting hard and aching between their sweaty bodies, gaining the smallest of friction, not nearly enough, and the first please is just rolling around Sherlock's mouth when clever, clever John takes him in hand with a soft murmur of praise and a curse of delight as the cock in his hand bursts a long string of precome.
The scariest man John had ever met owned this house and he was about to come barging in like some knight in shining armor.
"Your friend has been staring at you all night. But not in a longing sort of way. More in a fearful, panicked way. He's not hanging on your every word or pining after you like he would be if he were actually interested. He's been deliberating, going through options of some sort in his head, trying to make a decision. Probably about what he is going to say, how he is going to phrase it. He's been leaning away from you, not toward you like he would if he were actually attracted to you. His body language would depict excitement and anticipation, a twitch of the hand toward you, a subconscious cocking of the head imagining you in some intimate way. He's considered backing out of his plan several times tonight, trying to gather up the courage to talk to several good-looking men around this party. Those men he has shown attraction toward. A subconscious licking of the lips, a minute shuffle in their directions, all depicting sexual interest. But fear, as it so often does, has gotten in the way. He doesn't have the confidence to actually approach a stranger for sex. So he decided to go with his original plan; propositioning you. He's thinking he could start somewhere safe and since he knows you are a homosexual, he figured you wouldn't turn him down. Stupid, really. Gay men are not attracted to all men. But then again, most of the human race is inherently stupid."
Another cheer sounds in the other room and John steps around his friends. "I'd better get back out there."
, and he cannot deny it. He can't deny it to himself, not during these hours, not while John sleeps only meters from him. He knows those lingering gazes he's caught himself holding, those fond smiles he can't help tossing in the blond's direction, that warmth that blooms in his chest when John grins or laughs; he
"I got a similar story from Greg this afternoon," John nods. "Apparently Sherlock's older brother has tried to talk to him about Victor as well. Sherlock told him to shove it."
It takes an entire two minutes for Paul to stand up straight again from where he's doubled over laughing.
John spread his legs and Sherlock gasped softly, his pale cheeks flushing beautifully. "John," he whispered.
He turns on one heel and carries Sherlock out of the loo with ease, as though carrying a fully grown boy isn't anything extraordinary. Or hot as hell. Sherlock trembles slightly, his cock filling rapidly against John's stomach. "What did you have in mind?"
"I do have my moments," John nodded, still smiling, sagging slightly into Sherlock's arms as their lovemaking slowed from frantic climaxes to soft, reverent touches. "Although, I still have a lot to learn."
"I've got it, love," John chuckles, pausing to press a kiss to Sherlock's lips, "but thank you for helping."
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "We're in a pub, aren't we? I should think my reason for being here should be rather obvious."
A darker part of Sherlock hated himself for what he'd just done. A lighter part of Sherlock felt the familiar excitement of possibility. The lighter part won in the end and Sherlock grinned foolishly.
"Sherlock Holmes is a fucking bastard," John said almost angrily, slamming his drink down on the table they'd found. "And that is the last time I'm going to say it. We need another round. We're getting fucked up tonight." Mike and Link both crowed in agreement.
Gathering his own thoughts, Sherlock takes a moment to mull that over, carefully wading through John's words in an attempt to decipher the hidden meaning, knowing he must be missing something….
He nodded sharply, hearing Sherlock's words for what they really were, and pointed a finger at Harry. "Stay here and get some sleep."
But Sherlock was waving his hand as though Lestrade's statement was a ridiculous concern. "I had the situation under control."
Sherlock falters, almost tipping right over as he lowers himself back to the ground and turns to find John leaning against the frame of the door, arms crossed over his bare chest, somehow having recovered his pants even though Sherlock had put in a great deal of effort in tossing them far away, hoping to never see or hear from them again.
God, it was sick, he knew. Sick how enticing he found that. To be the first to lay hands on that smooth skin, those sensual lips, run fingers into those tumbling curls...
John scanned the room again and landed on the back of a dark, curly head in the front row. John couldn't help the smile that crept on to his face.
He couldn't say why he'd chosen to do it, and was well aware of how creepy this was but he was curious as hell. What did Sherlock do outside of school besides let random guys give him head in a dark alley? That thought made a fine tremor of anger shimmy its way down John's body and he forced himself to shake it off. No time for jealousy now. He'd promised himself he'd get over it.
"Money talks, John," the man replied. "Victor is a fraud. A fake. Nothing more than a liar with an attitude problem and daddy's credit card in his back pocket. He is no better than you John. No better than anyone. Trust me."
"You're clearly not," John says a bit firmer, feet crunching in the snow as he walks closer to Sherlock. "What's the matter?"
or simply in John's direction and all that carefully laid control would shatter like it was never there at all and Sherlock would be lost to his filthy thoughts and a painfully hard erection. The genius boy had thought time would help ease the tension in his body that's produced itself by being so physically close to someone he's so devastatingly attracted to without releasing it properly, but time has done nothing to tamper the budding urges he's never properly had.
The minutes don't even register on his radar as he stares down at the message on the phone in his hand, the quiet of the library doing nothing to soothe his loud, racing thoughts, popping like firecrackers in every different direction, diverting his attention this way and that as he reads it and then reads it again and then reads it again.
"I love you too," John rushes out, bending down to meet Sherlock's lips. "Christ, I love you so much."
Sherlock rolls his eyes at the display, the whole routine extremely tedious considering they have a very similar conversation at least once a week. This will be year four of this kind of harassment and Sherlock is exhausted. "Sally, Sebastian," he mutters with a nod of his head, flickering his eyes along them both, carefully picking up subtle queues and hints that everything isn't quite as solid as they seem to want everyone to believe it is. He smirks. "I see you two are still attempting to make a go of it. Pathetic really, considering Sally here stayed the night with Anderson last night."
Fingers wrap into the front of his button down and tug with perfectly clear intent and Sherlock has no interest in denying the command, stumbling through the doorway in John's grasp and trying not to laugh joyously because his body isn't sure what else to do with all this energy as the door slams behind him right about the same time his back is colliding with it.
Swallowing harshly, Sherlock stares down the single red cup that tops the pyramid, the cup that now holds the ball he'd just thrown, rattling slightly at the impact of the shot, the cup that means the genius scored on his very first Beer Pong throw
Sherlock ignores the stirring in his belly and instead rolls his eyes. Irene doesn't know what she's talking about. Irene is popular. Irene has friends and dates and parties and a life outside of ballet. Sherlock does not. How on earth could someone like John ever fancy the weird, dancer boy in his class? It doesn't make any sense.
"Hey, mate, relax," Victor says, throwing up his hands in mock defense. "We were just having a laugh."
"An acknowledgment of understanding would be most welcome at this time, John," the stranger said impatiently.
. That would only be asking for trouble. That would be going down a very dangerous path. That would be stupid and sentimental. Two things Sherlock is very much not.
"You know I can't do that," Sherlock murmurs, pushing into John's touch. "As much as I wish I could."
"Sh-Sherlock-" John chokes, mouth falling open, completely unaware he'd been this keyed up after watching Sherlock fall to pieces. "Oh god
long time, Sherlock can function again. Sherlock and John can be Sherlock and John without any complications like
Sherlock wants to tell John how beautiful he thought he was that first day. How fascinating Sherlock had immediately found him, standing there with a cane in hand, putting absolutely no weight on it, giving so much of himself away without even knowing it.
," Mrs. Holmes' croons, beaming in the blond boy's direction where John is currently puffing out his chest and standing a little straighter at the praise, admiring the cookie covered in white frosting in his hand in the shape of a teddy bear.
Relaxing slightly, appreciating that Sherlock was trying, a small laugh escaped his lips as he grinned. "It was difficult actually. Phillip Anderson's a total wanker. Talking to him can most definitely be classified as a hardship."
Before Sherlock can respond, John stands, leaving his lunch behind and marching to the nearest exit to the patio outside, not bothering to look back to see if Sherlock is coming. He scrambles to follow, a cold shiver of fear running down his spine. John hasn't been mad at him yet. He doesn't think he's going to like this.
things to the genius boy, conjures up thoughts in his head and sends little shivers down his spine because all he wants to do, right now in this moment, is to make John Watson feel so fucking
John's fingers come to the hook and eye of Sherlock's waistband. "Fucking breeches," John is muttering as he makes quick work unbuttoning and yanking. "
John bit into his flannel as another bout of tears filled his eyes, concealed only by the shower water streaming down his face.
Something completely out of place on that face he thought he knew. Something Sherlock has not noticed until this very minute and somehow it no longer matters what Mycroft said or what Irene said or what John said, because Sherlock can see it now clear as day. Sherlock can see it all.
If John would have known that waking up with Sherlock Holmes would make him this giddy, he would have started doing it a long time ago. Sherlock was still staring down at John as they entered what was obviously the kitchen, cheeks now tinted a delicious pink that John wanted to lick when Sherlock, without breaking eye contact said "Mummy. I'd like you to meet John Watson."
"What?" Sherlock moans back, unwilling to loosen his grasp, the thought of John moving away from him becoming completely unacceptable. "What is it?"
"Oh how nice for you," John almost yelled back, "I'm so glad you wanted to kiss me, oh how special I feel now that I know Sherlock Holmes wanted to kiss me. Did you also want to humiliate me and shove me out of your flat after you got me to admit I wanted you? Was that just some sick power trip for you? People don't do shit like that to people they care about so if that's you caring, I can do without it."
Mrs. Holmes chuckles at her youngest son's reaction. "No," she says between laughs. "No, I don't mean like that. I know Mycroft handled that."
"I've got a tutoring session," Sherlock mutters, looking about as enthused about it as John is about him leaving their room. "I'm meeting Victor at his house."
"Um," Sherlock had started, feeling oddly unsure of himself, something he didn't experience often. "Well, you know about my deductions-"
A tiny gasp hitches harshly in Sherlock's throat as he lies very still, watching almost as if in slow motion as a small, calloused hand reaches across the small space between them. He holds his breath as he watches the progression, heart pounding harder in his chest, realizing exactly where that appendage is going to land and he waits in impatient silence, anticipation building in his gut, needing this touch more than he needs air.
Sherlock's kiss deepened at that single word, hands coming to the hem of John's shirt and yanking it up, only pausing the kiss to pull it clean over his head. "Yes," he growled, sliding his fingers into the small space between John's belt buckle and his jeans and tugging, pulling him along.
Sherlock was surprised they hadn't noticed him before. Now watching Mike make his way angrily through the crowded pub, he almost wished he had stayed under the radar.
"I'll be teaching Victor Chemistry, John," Sherlock replies dubiously as he slings his bag onto his shoulder. "I can promise you, it won't be fun."
"I… am not sure what we're talking about here," John replies warily, feeling uneasy about discussing any personal or private topic regarding his partner.
I speak the truth," Sherlock flips his hand in dismissal, turning back around to face the front of the lecture hall, ignoring the small, nasty churn in his stomach. "Must you repeat yourself constantly?"
"Oh my god," John chuckles, pressing his forehead to Sherlock's rapidly reddening cheek, attempting and aborting to drop a kiss to his boyfriend's jaw. "What is going on right now? What a wanker."
Huffing a laugh from behind him, John is suddenly breathing softly in his ear, "Because I don't need your entire family knowing that I fucked Holmes the younger good and proper last night. Fair?"
He closes his eyes and breathes her name, thanking Christ that he still has one friend in this world. One friendship he hasn't royally fucked up.
He's barely spoken to Sherlock, with the exception of greetings in the morning and small talk about food and the occasional nod.
John rolled his eyes. Of course he would ask another question instead of getting to the fucking point. "I googled it like a normal teenager. I did play rugby you know, I'm used to having bruises."
The man stared blankly at John for three long seconds. Then promptly rolled his eyes. "For godsake," he muttered under his breath, "that was very much not what I was suggesting."
Sherlock tucks himself back in his pants, then turns and pushes John onto his back. John smirks. "Eager, are we?"
"This isn't so bad," Irene says happily, snuggling closer to Sherlock on the small space they'd squished themselves into in the crowd of screaming fans. It's chaos. Completely uncivilized. And cold as shit.
John nodded, pushing away his questions for now because Sherlock was about to come, and watching Sherlock come was one of his most favorite things in the world. So instead, he pulled his shirt all the way off, leaned back on his hands and whispered, "Come for me."
"Christ, the sounds you make," Sherlock was murmuring, having moved his hands up to John's almost too-long hair, although he was thankful for the length now. He liked being used as leverage for Sherlock to hold on to. He hummed back as he plucked the buttons open, wanting to press his naked torso to Sherlock's more then anything. That thought drove him to tug a bit harder, forcing the last button through its captive hole and pushing the shirt down Sherlock's broad shoulders. Sherlock dropped his arms compliantly, allowing John to pull it off his wrists. John let himself take a long moment to look down at the pale body before him, somehow hard and soft all at once, holding the sharp edges that Sherlock's face held while simultaneously seeming inviting and sensual and God, John wanted to melt into him. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, pressed his palms into the small of his back and brought him forward.
"I think it's your turn," John murmured over the heated latex covering Sherlock's cock, exhaling along the length.
Sherlock's sharp gaze dances back and forth between them with a frown. "Well, I can dance with both-"
And a little pissed off that all he could think about was Sherlock. This was the infamous club Link had seen him at. This was the place he was sure Sherlock picked up many of his conquests. Who knows, he may even see him tonight, picking someone up. Someone else. Someone that wasn't John.
The full on pout of Sherlock Holmes resembles that of a five-year-old child being scolded by their mother. With a loud exhale, Sherlock twists on one heel, stomps to his bed and throws himself down onto the comforter in the most dramatic way he can manage, blankets puffing up around him as he lands face-down on his pillow, curls bouncing along for the ride.
John blushed madly. "No no, S-no. I apologize for my behavior last night. It was inappropriate and I promise it won't happen again."
But already John is forcing any infatuation he's forming toward Sherlock, determined to leave that poor, obviously bullied boy alone and make this a summer Sherlock will never forget.
If and when John wants it, Sherlock wants to be prepared. He wants to be ready for anything. He wants to be
"I know," Mike agrees sympathetically. "Go get it over with so you can come back and watch your boy dominate the table."
Blinking for a long moment, Sherlock finally drops his gaze, thumbing at the pencil marks he's just made on his paper and shaking his head. "He's just a tool," he tries to say lightly. "It's this stupid holiday. Seems to somehow bring out the worst in him, needing to poke fun at me for… well, it's just exhausting."
John's cock hardens to the point of pain as he takes in Sherlock's gorgeous body and perfectly debauched afterglow. He looks beautiful and filthy and sated and lovely and before John realizes it, his own hand is on his own cock, stroking himself off.
Warmth pools from inside the house out onto the front porch and the sight before his eyes is almost exactly how the photograph in his mind looks, though he's certain his photographic memory could never ever do justice to actually
Shoving his things into his bag hastily and waving off his teammates ribbing him about his urgency, John hustles up the hill and across the road to his dorm room, attempting to calm his pounding heart that has nothing to do with the sprints he'd just completed.
A cheer rings out from around the corner, Mike's voice cutting through their conversation with a bellowing, "Well done Sherlock!" and the rest of the party-goers holler in celebration. John glances quickly over his shoulder, realizing he'd better get back quick since he'd promised he'd see Sherlock's first victory of the night.
Eyeing him curiously with a raised eyebrow that the genius can't see, John takes a step forward. "Alright?" he asks softly, concern coloring his words.
He cut himself off immediately. "Sorry." No way was he telling Molly Hooper about his sex life with Sherlock. It was so stupid anyway. For Sherlock to even
Those precious fingers glide along his jawline, skimming below his ear and finding their way into the dark curls at the nape of his neck, twining into them and holding on as the dark outline of John Watson looms closer, Sherlock tracing his moonlit frame, parting his lips in a soft gasp as a puff of John's warm breath ghosts over his face, the closeness of their mouths undeniable now.
Sherlock forces himself to roll his eyes to distract from the blush creeping into his cheeks and John laughs.
as bad as Link had said. John forced himself not to panic. He was a good student. He could handle a tough teacher.
"And is this Sherlock?" One of the boys currently crowding closer nods, smiling sunnily in Sherlock's direction.
This time, Sherlock is clinging just as harshly to John as John is to him and everything goes blessedly silent as his entire world narrows down to John and John's strong body and John's warm mouth and John's hands in his shirt.
Sherlock sighed. "John, you must stop assuming things. Assuming we're going to a break in, assuming we're spying on someone. My work if often unpredictable, and it won't be easy for you to determine what comes next, so why tell you where we are starting?"
John glared at his two laughing friends then turned and left the bar, forcing down the anxiety for now. He didn't want that to ruin his time with Sherlock.
The man shook his head sharply as though to snap himself of whatever it was he was under and huffed an uncomfortable laugh. "I am truly at a loss for words," he smiled wanly at John.
Sherlock's breath caught deep in his chest as he looked down into those dark blue eyes, then found his gaze on John's lips, his own falling open subconsciously. He never wanted anything to happen to this boy. He wanted to him to stay here. Stay with him. Stay safe and sound.
All John had done in front of Sherlock was embarrass himself. Victor had of course assisted with that but in all reality, John should have handled this better. John should have taken this on much sooner, should have made a damn move, shouldn't have waited for someone like Victor to show up, swoop in and blow him right out of the water, killing any chance he ever thought he held with Sherlock Holmes.
