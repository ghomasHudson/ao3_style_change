Cautiously, John heaved himself upright, unsure whether either his leg would hold him up, nor whether whatever he was lying on could withstand his weight. Warily, John jumped down from the softness, tucking his injured leg up under his body and landing with three paws. Curious, John sniffed around the room first, before leaving the comfortably dark den and exploring the rest of the human dwelling. John recognised none of the things inside, but it smelt heavily of the human Alpha. This was obviously where he lived. And there were no other scents of others. This pleased John immensely.
Sherlock pulled back in surprise, and John was horrified.
Sherlock purred, licking and nibbling his ear, then down his neck.
Snorting, John crumpled the letter up in his fist, face red, and once again soaked it in the sink and watching as it dissolved.
Now that he mentioned it, John had hit his head earlier and he now he could feel blood clotting against his skin.
“I’ll be right back,” John promised in a whisper, a fond smile tugging on his lips.
He wasn’t sure how long he sat there, he just knew that the sun was slowly disappearing beyond the horizon.
Sherlock seemed to be frozen, his whole body tense and he didn’t move even after Mike left and disappeared into the crowd.
the prince? Prince Holmes?” John asked breathlessly in surprise, looking back at Sherlock with wide eyes.
“I don’t know, John,” Sherlock sighed, softening a little at John’s cry, and strode over to John, wrapping his arms around him and John buried his face into Sherlock’s neck gratefully, “Maybe you caught the flu or something like that.”
“Thank you,” John thanked Sherlock happily.
Later, a few months after, Sherlock scowled at him as John once again pulled away from under his wings. John felt bad, but he knew that he couldn’t get that close. It was too much of a risk.
Sherlock stood swiftly and turned. “Lestrade, John would not ruin any of the evidence, and he will help me think. He’s already proved more adept at catching criminals than most of your officers,” Sherlock said sharply, seemingly ready for a fight.
John’s hand was down in his pocket, gripping his phone and holding it out before he’d had time to realise that he’d done so, the words tumbling from his mouth, “Take mine.”
John glanced out the window and panicked as he caught sight of Sherlock raising the pill to his lips. John snarled as he saw the finger tighten around the trigger, and lunged, knocking the sniper to the ground as the shot fired. He spared a moment to listen, to hear Sherlock’s continued breathing and the laboured breathing of the elderly man, and quickly and cleanly snapped the neck of the sniper before dragging him and the gun out the back of the building to dispose of it.
“Hey, do you have a name?” John asked as he rifled through the fridge to find something to eat. “And, what do you eat?”
His gaze sharpened as he took in John, and John blinked. Why was his name important? Shrugging it off, he looked back to the baby, blinking as he found that he was awake and staring at John with the most gorgeous eyes John was sure he would ever see. They were a curious mix of silver and blue, and suited him well. He stared at John quietly, and John could feel a sense of anticipation in the room. For several moments, Sherlock stared at him, then gave a happy gurgle, a small smile on his round face as his wings fluttered against his tiny back.
John was content to just stay like this, tucked under Sherlock’s wing, feeling safe. He knew no one could see him with Sherlock’s wing around him, and he felt protected. Sherlock was watching him, and he remembered that he was the older of them, and he shifted his wings slightly, moving to back away from Sherlock and out of the comfort of his wings. Sherlock’s wings tightened around him, pulling him even closer to Sherlock’s body. John flushed, but shook his head and backed out. It was too dangerous to get any further into this than he already was.
Sherlock gave a frown, and his eyes watered as he looked up at his mother and began to cry. Mrs Holmes shot a look at her husband that looked a lot like ‘I told you so’. John stared at Sherlock helplessly.
over the fact that Sherlock had let him believe he was dead for
“John is special,” Sherlock said simply, not turning around, and gently nudging John’s jaw until he was looking at his Alpha once more. “How did you get outside, John?”
A subtle flaring of his nostrils confirmed what John had already thought – Sherlock Holmes was an Alpha. Betas couldn’t scent like Alphas and Omegas, and they only knew the difference when they were told.
Did that mean Sherlock could forgive him? That they could live together once more and Sherlock could, once more, be his pack leader – his Alpha? Even though Sherlock was all that he could remember, his wolf side instinctively recognised Sherlock as the leader of their pack. It had taken him years to recognise what his instincts were telling him and even longer that he found the proper name for it.
Sherlock stilled, and he seemed confused. Then, he shook his head as if to get rid of pesky thoughts, and asked again, “Where is John?”
John stabbed his pasta and took a bite before grimacing in displeasure, which confused him. This was his favourite pasta, and yet he didn’t want it for some reason. John twirled his food around his fork and dangled it in the air for a few moments, before a growl from Sherlock sent him shoving the food into his mouth.
The next few hours were torturous. Sherlock alternated between pacing violently in front of the door, and pressing his nose to John’s neck to make sure he was still there sitting on the bed and still okay. Every time someone walked past their door, Sherlock would snarl in warning, and John would sigh. He knew Sherlock well enough by now to know that he was as frustrated with his own actions as John was.
John yawned on the way back and Sherlock wrapped an arm about his waist. “You did good John,” Sherlock murmured, kissing his temple.
One day, Sherlock hadn’t returned home and the moon was rising, so John went down stairs and whined at the door until the lady (Mrs Hudson, as he’d heard her being referred to as), opened it up for him. John slipped out, his fur spiking uncomfortably. This was the first time he’d been out of the den without Sherlock, and he wasn’t quite sure how Sherlock would react, but he was worried about his Alpha and needed to see him.
“No.” Lie. Well, sort of. He
“Yes,” John answered instantly, no doubt in his mind.
“You recognise me. Your body language indicates that you are familiar with me, and yet I
John transformed back into his human form, grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pressed it to his belly and repeated softly, “I’m pregnant, Sherlock.”
John didn’t own a phone (why would he, when Sherlock just lived next door? And besides, John was terrible with electronic devices and it was better to leave those to Sherlock) nor did he have a computer, so there was no way for his to talk to Sherlock.
“It was kind of like anger, but… not. I didn’t want you near her. Or anyone,” John explained, twisting so he could see Sherlock’s face.
Again, thank you to everyone and I hope you enjoyed my story! If you like, go check out my other stories as they all tend to run on the same basic principals (top Sherlock and bottom John).
“We can’t be friends anymore,” John told him, looking up at him, blinking furiously to try and not cry.
“Never again,” John agreed softly, kissing Sherlock on the lips to soothe him.
Was the immediate response, though Sherlock’s slow breathing didn’t change and he didn’t twitch a muscle.
They did some research, and they found out that a normal wolf’s research was sixty-three days in length. Which only left them with roughly three weeks before John gave birth. Sherlock grew more protective, and John started nesting, hiding himself away in the bedroom as his belly grew bigger, and built a nest in their bed. He scrunched up their sheets into a rough circle, then placed some of their clothing in and around the sheets, and placed some pillows in their before pulling the covers on top and scattering more clothing and pillows on top. It smelt strongly of the both of them, and John spent a lot of time on and in the nest.
John trailed off, took a deep breath, braced himself and raised his head further and lifted his tail. He managed one step like that before he was tackled to the ground, a loud snarling filling the air as Sherlock’s jaws wrapped around his throat and squeezed as he pressed his paws into John’s belly.
“So you come searching my flat? How did you even find this place?” John asked, glancing around, angry.
Curling on his side, John wrapped his arms around his belly and pressed his nose into the pillow, inhaling Sherlock’s scent and falling back into sleep.
“They don’t like me,” John whispered, and knew he was right when Sherlock hesitated.
Even John could see that Sherlock was winning, and John smiled warmly, pleased. He’d already known that Sherlock was smart from watching him before, but this was even greater proof.
John nodded, pleased. “Alright, down you hop, I need to undress,” John told Sherlock, and laughed at the way Sherlock instantly elegantly jumped off of his arm and onto the floor mat, sitting gracefully and staring up at John expectantly.
John couldn’t see his Alpha’s face like this, but the tight grip on his jaw loosened slightly. “A rabbit?” he didn’t sound as impressed as John had hoped. “You bolted from me for a
Even thinking his name was painful. But, John pushed those thoughts away and took a sip of his drink with a grimace. Glancing over at Mike, John smiled fondly as his friend boasted about something.
“John,” Mycroft said coldly, “What are you doing here?”
It had been Mike who had encouraged him to continue his dream and study to become a doctor, Mike who would pick him up out of his depression every year and help him through the hard times, Mike who took away the alcohol and forced him to continue on living, Mike who convinced him that it was okay to fly again. Mike was a great friend, and John owed him a lot. Owed him everything, really.
Satisfied, his Alpha turned to him and knelt down, cupping John’s face in his hands and looked him over thoroughly, as if looking for injury.
Slipping quietly out of Sherlock’s room, John made his way towards where the bathroom hopefully still was.
Sherlock stood, bringing John up with him, his second pair of wings wrapped firmly around John’s hips and keeping him steady and pressed against Sherlock’s front.
Sherlock’s face was soft and he was smiling in amusement, opening his eyes to look at John. He reached out and carded his fingers through John’s hair, which he instantly leant into. “Jealousy. You were jealous,” Sherlock explained, gently scratching his fingers against John’s scalp.
“Why?” Sherlock demanded, shooting in front of him once more and stopping all his attempts to escape by grabbing John’s wrist in a tight grip.
“I was looking for you, of course,” Sarah told him in a sickly-sweet voice, “I called your work a while ago and they told me you were on annual leave.”
“Why haven’t you accepted my gifts?” Sherlock questioned bluntly, his gaze (John noted that his eye had healed slightly, but he could still only properly use one) focussed intently on John.
John was only seventeen, and he’d never had a piercing or gotten a tattoo, and this
. Instead, he asked, “What colour is the ink?”
As promised, the sun was still rising, shedding gentle light over the world as John took flight from his cloud and flew leisurely to the cave, humming happily to himself. There was no rush. He doubted Sherlock would be there yet – the only reason he was up was because of the sun, hitting his cloud and warming it up pleasantly.
John was resting against the pole for support now as his knees trembled slightly at having such an amazing Alpha so incredibly close to him. “I do love tea,” John managed to get out, before realising the attention they were gathering and cleared his throat again, shifting back slightly.
Sarah looked as startled as John felt. She’d cheated on him?
When he was done, John laid it all out on the kitchen table and set out the cutlery, but when he turned to tell Sherlock it was all ready, his Alpha was already lovingly laying down his violin in his case and turning to John and making his way over to the kitchen.
“Tell me!” Sherlock shouted, letting go of the collar and fisting the material at John’s chest, forcing him upright. “What have you done to John? I swear, if you’ve hurt him, you’ll pay for it!”
Snuggling back into Sherlock’s body, John asked sleepily, “What time’s it?”
“I’m going to bond you, my precious Omega,” Sherlock panted into his ear, nipping lightly at the lobe, “Make you mine. All mine. Ah, fuck. You’re so tight, John. So, so tight.” Sherlock’s praises made John hurtle towards climax faster, and Sherlock groaned at the increased tightness around his cock. “That’s it, John,” Sherlock purred, “Come for me. Come in those gorgeous panties of yours.”
a genius after all.”
“Show me your ID,” Sherlock ordered, and even though his voice was soft, the order was hard to ignore.
John looked at Sherlock, instinctively, wanting to instantly say no, but he knew it wasn’t his choice. Sherlock turned away to tidy up after a moment, but John had caught the flicker in his facial feature. Sherlock didn’t want them to have two bedrooms.
Truly, there was nothing better than being by his Alpha’s side for the rest of their lives.
John frowned. “But you’ve got both the Lestrade’s, and Mycroft,” John protested, switching legs and leaning over his other foot.
He watched and listened as Sherlock started describing the sniper, and watched as Sherlock’s gaze fell on him then swept over him, taking in his raggard appearance, the dirt under his nails and the way some of his shirt was still untucked, and paused in speaking.
Grinning excitedly, John looked back up to Mrs Holmes, and she gently held out Sherlock, and John took him carefully into his arms, cradling him close to his chest. Sherlock stared up at him with his big eyes, just watching John, and John smiled softly down at him. There was just something about him, something that called to John, and he wanted to stay with Sherlock. Looking up at the clock on the wall, he frowned. He needed to get back, or he was going to be noticed. “I should be going,” he said reluctantly, looking up from Sherlock’s sweet face to see that Mrs and Mr Holmes were in some sort of silent debate.
*.*.*.*.*
There was silence for a few moments before Sherlock asked, “Did you know there were more of you?”
The whole of the next day, Sherlock coddled John and cared for him, looking after his every needs and putting cream on the wounds and bandaging it back up. John enjoyed being cared for like this, despite the pain. It was worth it to see Sherlock looked so pleased.
John knew he should be disturbed by how easily and quietly someone was managing to break into his home and get so close to him without waking him, but he could only smile as he reached out and took the note, breaking the seal and tipping it upside down. Onto his cupped palm fell a key with a string and a small bit of paper attached which read ‘221B’ and a carefully folded note.
Sherlock tilted his head, and rumbled, “Go on.”
Sherlock was finally sounding like the Sherlock John knew again, but John couldn’t help but flinch at the hurt tone in his voice. “I had to,” John murmured, gently stroking the pencil.
Shaking himself out from his depressing thoughts, John sighed and sat up. There was no point in trying to go back to sleep now. He was back in London, in a tiny, crappy flat, wishing he’d never even heard of war.
The media left them alone, and the story of Sherlock Holmes the criminal faded from the minds of Londoners.
“The smell,” John got out, his voice sounding clogged.
One elegant eyebrow lifted with clear amusement, pale pink lips spreading into a smirk. “Yes, John,” Sherlock’s deep voice rumbled from the man, and it was strange hearing it come from the seeming-human in front of him instead of a little black dragon.
“You don’t want to see this,” John stepped up to her, a small part of his brain telling him he was now too far away from Sherlock, but it was quickly silenced by the protector in him.
Sherlock gave a soft growl of displeasure, but was instantly distracted as John shifted, his shirt and jumper lifting a bit, the Alpha’s gaze finding some lace from his panties.
“Forever,” John echoed happily.
Sherlock’s eyes opened, focusing on John with a grim expression. “No!” John protested instantly, “I don’t know how. It may not even work!”
He trusted Sherlock. He had no idea what the tattoo was, but he trusted Sherlock. He wanted to ask Sherlock questions like
, Sherlock whispered in his mind, then nuzzled John and all of their pups,
A loud rumbly noise came from the dragon’s stomach, and John chuckled softly. “Right, food. I’ll go get some,” John said with a smile, stroking the dragon once more before gently picking him up and placing him on the bed.
John Watson grew up as a Gifted. He could move his consciousness up and see the energy world. There were not many who could do what he could, though it used to be very common, now it was rare. John kept it a secret, as he didn’t see any point in bragging about it.  It was gorgeous, the energy world, with bright pulsing colours or dark, dull colours (depending on whether the owner was good or bad, and those that were both good and bad had a swirling mix of both).
John hesitated a moment, well aware of what his wolf form now looked like, but before Sherlock could reprimand him or demand again, John transformed. He stood, head bent and eyes closed. Before Sherlock had kicked him out, changing into his wolf form had simply been shifting into his other skin, but now it was different. Now, he had to struggle to control himself and had to fight with his instincts.
He listened to Sherlock rummage around and get dressed, then listened to his soft footsteps retreating and leaving John alone in their bedroom.
Sherlock purred in his mind, licking at John’s hole, causing John to twitch in surprise and then still as Sherlock growled.
*.*.*.
Sherlock groaned and shook his head. John’s grip on Sherlock’s hand tightened in worry. What should he do? How could he stop Sherlock from dying?
John kept quiet, heart racing with fear. As his silence stretched, his father gave him a choice. “You either stop being friends with him, or we will go after
It was two years later when Sherlock got his first erection. Ever since that morning two years ago, Sherlock had been taking care of John’s morning erections, and every other erection that John got. Most of the erections that John got were caused in one way or another by Sherlock, and he was sure Sherlock knew that even though John had never told him. Their relationship had evolved past friendship, to include kisses and cuddling and hand-holding, and John was always amused when Sherlock got possessive in public, and if he thought someone else was trying to hit on John, Sherlock would grab the Sub and snog him thoroughly no matter where they were. And, okay, that had led to John provoking Sherlock a couple of time to get some possessive and ridiculously hot kisses, but no one could really blame him.
Sherlock’s gaze slid to the side, up at the wound on John’s head, and he licked it again. “Yes, I know
eating those on me,” John protested firmly when Sherlock made to take the meat and eat it on John’s shoulder, “You’ll get the juices all over my jumper!”
Heading into the kitchen with the dragon draped comfortably across his shoulders, John revelled in the freedom of having two hands to use again instead of one, and not having to worry about constantly checking on the egg, as the dragon was firmly on his shoulders and obviously not going anywhere.
John hadn’t wanted to go – he would stick to his promise even if Sherlock hadn’t -, but eventually Mike had wheeled his way into convincing John to go, if only so that he could make sure Mike didn’t do anything stupid.
“Huh,” John said, leaning back in his chair.
This was familiar, and comforting, and John relaxed further, making a soft noise as Sherlock continued stroking his hair. Finally, Sherlock pulled back and pressed a kiss to John’s forehead and murmured softly, “Sleep,” before tucking John’s head back under his chin.
Sherlock looked at him and took the phone, but stilled for a spit-second in his typing, eyes widening minutely.
John managed to move all of his few things into 221B in the afternoon. And by evening he’d given his key back to his landlord and gotten everything settled. He spent most of the evening moving things around to the way that he wanted them and stocking up the fridge and cupboards with food.
The girl was harder to catch than anticipated, even with her phone number. On the third day, John needed a break. There was nothing he could do here to help, and Sherlock was in a foul mood, rejecting anything John said viciously. But he still refused to let John out of sight.
“Oh, definitely not,” she laughed quietly, then grabbed his hand and a pen and wrote her number on it, her pale cheeks flushing red.
die at the hands of a human!
“I brought you some lunch,” John told Sherlock, changing the topic before the scent of his arousal got too obvious.
He knew by heart which window was Sherlock’s, and he wasn’t surprised to see it open – that must have been how Sherlock got back in. He dived in through Sherlock’s window, he looked around briefly. He couldn’t see Sherlock, and turned around, eyes sweeping over the room.
could use the money, it was how
happy,” John agreed, leaning up and stealing a quick kiss, “I have a gorgeous, intelligent Alpha mate whom I just spent a heat with.”
*.*.*.*
“Ewww,” She wrinkled her nose, then her gaze turned to the side. “Oh! Is that Sherlock Holmes? Is he solving the murder?”
Sherlock growled in warning. “You’re not allowed to keep secrets from me, John,” Sherlock snarled lowly, grip tightening on John’s fur until it was painful and caused John to wince, “Don’t you remember what happened last time you did?”
So, John got dressed in his best going-out clothes (the ones normally reserved for dates), including his best shoes, spent a while in the bathroom making himself look presentable, then walked out to the living room and collected his keys and phone from the table.
John had been reluctant to leave at the end of the day, but he knew he had to. Sherlock had been reluctant to let him leave, finally having his best friend back that he hadn’t even remembered until today. He had satisfied Sherlock by promising that he would be back in two days’ time – because coming here every day would just be suspicious.
Sherlock’s hands were rubbing his baby bump gently. “Sorry,” Sherlock’s deep voice rumbled apologetically in his ear, “I needed you and it was the quickest and easiest way.”
Basically, courting was the Alpha proving that they could provide the four basic things that humans needed to survive.
Sherlock (who now looked seventeen) appeared, a grin on his face, “John!” he called happily, but his expression froze as he saw John’s face, and then noticed Harry. “What-what’s going on?” he asked, slightly less sure of himself.
Then, he’d need to figure out how on earth he was going to tell Sherlock.
“I promise they will never keep us apart,” Sherlock promised him, and pressed a light kiss to the top of John’s head.
John turned and watched as Sherlock sniffed around the flat, tail in the air, and John felt fond amusement as Sherlock leapt around the room. He watched as Sherlock’s nose wrinkled and his head turned to face the kitchen.
John gaped in surprise. “That’s… brilliant,” he breathed out.
“After her, John!” Sherlock commanded, “And bring her back alive.”
John couldn’t help but stir at the sight of all Sherlock’s gorgeous pale skin, his cock twitching with interest. Sherlock inhaled deeply and grinned wolfishly at John, leaning down and claiming his mouth in a hard kiss.
Sniffing the air, he panicked as he smelt the metallic tang of guns. And, of course, Sherlock reacted to his panic by curling even tighter around him. John lifted his head and could feel the vibrations of Sherlock’s growl against the back of his head. Peeking at what he could see, John saw guards with shields and guns pointed at them.
John shook his head quickly again, still backing up as his Alpha advanced on him. Then, Sherlock’s gaze flickered over his body, stilling on his neck for a second too long. “What’s this?” Sherlock murmured, reaching out as if to touch his collar, and John bolted without a second thought.
“Wait here, I’ll go get it running,” Sherlock told him, pressing a kiss to John’s forehead before slipping out of bed and John’s arms.
Finally, they passed off the egg to a young girl of about twenty, with gorgeous wide blue eyes and golden hair. He watched the awe in her gaze, and slipped her an envelope with the key for her new home. She didn’t even notice. Watching them for a moment, John sighed softly and then hugged Sherlock.
“It made me sick,” John sulked, because that was the only logical explanation. He’d eaten the food, and then he’d thrown up.
job to protect
Back in the – their – flat, Sherlock shut the door behind them so Mrs Hudson wouldn’t hear and faced John, who was waiting in the middle of the room, cane long since discarded.
They fell into silence, and after quite a while of waiting, they finally saw the prisoners open the door and begin dragging in a limp body.
rescued rankled John, he had to admit that the Alpha had been taking good care of him. John felt better than he’d felt in moons, and he was grateful to the human. John would be loyal to him for taking care of him like this.
Sherlock must have triggered his heat, John thought with a groan, and the courting gifts had helped speed it along. John had had a heat once when he first presented, but that had been fifteen years ago and he hadn’t met an Alpha before Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed, his fingers gently caressing John’s stomach. “I know. But you’re mine, and I shan’t let you go.”
“I-I don’t know what you mean,” John stammered, all too aware of Sherlock’s pencil in his pocket.
“Mmph?” John mumbled in question, yawning against Sherlock’s neck.
,” his father spat the word ‘Holmes’ like it was poison, “any more. We’ve been very patient with you, John, but this can’t continue.”
John was a fighter and a healer of the pack. Because of his size, he was a formidable fighter, and it was easy for him to overpower most of the wolves that came to try and steal their territory for another pack, and he had scars all over his body to boast the number of battles that he had been in and survived. And yet, John had an affinity for knowing what plants were useful for healing. John was a faster healer than the rest of his packmates, and therefore never used any of the herbs for himself, but used them to make his packmates stronger.
“You told me to fuck off,” John murmured with amusement, yawning and stretching out.
“It hurts,” John told Sherlock softly, and lifted Sherlock’s cup of coffee, which his boyfriend took.
“You are
John brought his wrist up to his mouth once more, licking over the wound and not watching long enough to see it heal up almost instantaneously.
“Very forward, doctor,” Sherlock purred with a smirk.
John was now 2 646 years old and looked around in his early 40’s. Every year, he gave Sherlock a present; he left it on Sherlock’s bed, right in the middle while Sherlock was downstairs unwrapping all his other ones. After the first fifty years, Sherlock stopped asking who left them, and seemed to have completely forgotten him. It hurt, but it was better this way, John knew. It was so much better than Sherlock being hurt because of him.
“Let’s do something!” John exclaimed, standing up, taking Sherlock’s hands in his own to pull him up too.
*.*.*.
Thank you to everyone who read, commented, gave kudos or any combination! I love every one of you, and you all helped to keep my motivation going to keep on writing! This was originally meant to be a one-shot, but then I got curious and posted what I had written, and the response has blown me away! I love each and every one of you, and your supports means more than you can ever know!
Sherlock flopped backwards on the bed, and John crawled up onto the bed with him, snuggling into Sherlock’s side and wrapping an arm around Sherlock’s waist with a blissful smile. Sherlock’s wings curled around him, keeping him close.
! He would always remember Sherlock, but Sherlock would forget him by the time another hundred years had passed, if not before that.
Sherlock’s eyes were soft and he leant forward, pressing his nose tenderly to John’s head.
“I want you to come back to the city,” the other human – Mycroft – said bluntly, irritation colouring his tone, “You’ve had your fun, now come back and stop this tantrum at once Sherlock.”
For a moment, John paused, torn between running away from the horrible smell and clearing his nose, and obeying Sherlock. As always, obeying Sherlock won out, and he took cautious steps forward into the far corner of the room where Sherlock was by the body. John held a hand to his nose to try and muffle the scent somewhat, but it didn’t work. It stung his nose, but pleasing Sherlock was more important than any discomfort.
“You bastard!” Mike shouted, more enraged than John had ever seen him, “You have no right! No right! You have no idea what you did!”
John sighed happily. “Love you too,” John mumbled, wanting nothing more than to go to sleep on his Alpha’s knot with his Alpha’s strong body around him.
“This…was unexpected,” Sherlock admitted, his gaze hungry as he looked down at John.
John looked over him, admiring his lean, graceful form. John stroked his hand over Sherlock’s back and listened to the rumbly purring noise that emanated from Sherlock’s chest. Smiling, John closed his eyes and leant back until he was fully stretched out in the tub and his neck was resting on the back of the bath.
“He won’t harm me. Stand back,” John ordered, before returning his attention to the gorgeous Alpha below him.
Sherlock smirked at him, and slowly released his hand. Then, abruptly, Sherlock turned and started striding off, calling over his shoulder, “Come on, John! I’ve got something to show you!”
Sighing, John sat up and headed into the bathroom to go to the loo.
John gave a soft rumble of comfort and a nod, pressing his nose gently to Sherlock’s cheek.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft began, and John lunged forward, furious, but was stopped by firm hands on his scruff jerking him backwards.
’ sounding in his head. With a groan, John opened his eyes and then pressed backwards in shock. There was a black dragon face staring at him, with gorgeous sea-coloured eyes gazing at him.
Curious about the mental link Sherlock had talked about earlier, John awkwardly tried probing for Sherlock’s mind. After a few moments, he shifted into the energy world.  A gold thread was linking himself and Sherlock, from his heart to Sherlock’s. He could see the pure colours of blue and yellow and bright green and the pink tinge of love surrounding Sherlock, and he smiled.
For weeks, John was in a state of shock and denial, sure that any day Sherlock would turn back up and sweep him away and apologise. But, it never happened.
Sherlock examined him intently, as if positive John was lying. “You really think so,” Sherlock stated, sounding puzzle. “That’s not what people normally say.”
Sherlock gave a chuckle. “Perhaps.”
Sherlock laughed and nodded his head, “Of course.”
Sherlock pulled a face and made his way through, heading straight to John, looking determined. “Well?” Sherlock questioned, “What did you think?”
That night, he curled up on John’s chest, wings spread and preventing him from moving around too much.
It had started out the same as every other time – with Sherlock behind John, with John on his hands and knees on Sherlock’s magnificent king bed and Sherlock pounding into John from behind, whispering encouragements and grunted out praises as John moaned helplessly. And then, Sherlock had shifted slightly, reaching onto the bedside table and picking up two somethings, unscrewing one of them.
Sherlock growled lowly and cuddled John even closer. “Lestrade came and took them away, I assume that they’ll be put into isolation and questioned. No doubt they are part of the murder ring that I’m about to break,” Sherlock told him, licking John’s jaw and his tongue lingered on the Omega’s skin.
John,” Sherlock’s voice came out in a low snarl.
“You don’t sound so certain,” DI Dimmock said suspiciously, “Can we come in and snoop around?”
John stepped forward, and the Dom turned his head with a slight smirk, locking eyes and not looking at all surprised to see John. John flushed in embarrassment, gaze dropping and turned his head to the side, only to catch sight of his wings and was surprised to see that they had lowered submissively.
He could sense Sherlock’s confusion.
But, then, one day, John was confronted by his parents.
John obeyed without hesitation, transforming into his wolf form and panting, eyes squeezed closed. Sherlock moved to his rear, lifting his tail out of the way and soothing John through his contractions.
John spent two days with his skin burning hot, and an aching need that his fingers couldn’t fill. John had no concept of time, he only knew that Mrs Hudson would come up every once in a while and leave bottles of cool water and a wash cloth outside of the bedroom door. When a wave had passed, he would stumble upright and collect them then push the furniture back into place and take a long drink and sometimes wash himself before sleeping and waking up in a wave of heat and his fingers already inside of himself.
“No, you were in heat when the last gift was delivered,” Sherlock said, frowning in thought, before smiling. “Ask Mrs Hudson, she probably put it somewhere.”
Sherlock smiled at him softly. “I look forward to it. But now I really need to go, John,” Sherlock said, and John sighed with a nod.
What had made even John grimace, she didn’t flinch at.
John shivered at the words and nodded. Sherlock pulled back and kissed John’s forehead before cuddling him close. “Sleep, John,” Sherlock whispered softly, and John nodded again.
He was strong, despite his skinny appearance, and John summed up that he was lean, but no less strong than any other Alpha. He was smart too, and sharp of tongue, and had a tinge of arrogance in the way that he walked. There was something that drew John to him.
Oh. Oh! No, no, no! Sherlock had gone after the killer by himself! What an idiot! Why would he do that? Why not let John know? Whining in anxiousness, John paced for a moment, waited for the dot to settle, zoomed in on it, and dashed out the door. Once he was out in the streets, he darted into an alley way and transformed. He had to pause for a few moments, head whirling as he fought to control himself and his instincts.
He’d promised to always protect Sherlock, and he wouldn’t be able to bear it if he was the cause of Sherlock getting harmed.
“So, you’ll accept my courting now?” Sherlock queried.
“John?” he questioned, gaze becoming fixed on John’s lips.
“Of course! It was extraordinary,” John exclaimed.
“John! You’re bleeding,” Sherlock stated, reaching into his coat pocket and producing a portable pack of tissues and tugged a few out, holding them to John’s nose and tipping his head down. “What happened?” Sherlock’s voice was sharp with concern.
Then, John pushed it back towards Sherlock suddenly. He shouldn’t be here. Sherlock took it with a frown, looking up at John, but he was already backing away. “Wait!” Sherlock called. “How do you know this?”
Sherlock’s hand grasped his chin, and turned him back to meet his intense gaze. “That didn’t stop you before,” he pointed out.
Bending his head, Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, “Mycroft works for the government. He’s here to help. He helped me get in here in the first place, and he can get you out.”
Leaning up, he kissed Sherlock, and became lost into the kiss for a few moments before slowly pulling back.
*.*.*.
John spent the next two weeks at home, taking the egg everywhere he went, not wanting it out of sight.
*.*.*.
John cried out in pain, not pleasure, as the knife dug into his back, something trickling down the blade and into the cut. Sherlock shushed him softly, tenderly, and kept carving into his skin. The pain drew him back from the edge of orgasm he’d been on. He was crying, whimpering Sherlock’s name, but still thrusting back into Sherlock’s cock, wanting some pleasure to counteract the pain. Sherlock was crooning, telling John how good he was, how it wouldn’t take long.
The air helped clear his head and he didn’t feel quite so ill anymore. Sighing in relief, he placed a contemplative hand on his stomach and rubbed gently through his warm jumper (not that he really needed extra warmth, but it was comforting and kept out the bite of the wind). He walked along the less crowded streets of London and ended up at a quiet park. Sitting down, he flexed his toes and leant back against the hard bench and closed his eyes.
?” Sherlock spat the word ‘Angel’, his tone cold.
When he’d turned around, Sherlock had crumpled to the ground, a hand clutching at his stomach. After that, his memories were a bit of a blur. He remembered killing the murderer, then picking up Sherlock and ending up back at Baker Street. He’d lain Sherlock down on the bed, and paced at the side of the bed.
“Tomorrow’s the last day,” Sherlock continued, his hand caressing John’s belly through the Omega’s shirt, “Will you come home with me and bond and be my mate?”
The words were harsh and cold, and John watched as Sarah fled the flat quickly, slamming the door behind her. Slowly, Sherlock slipped from his mind and body and the feeling of water running over him came again, and then he was in control of himself.
Sherlock simply held it for a moment before comparing it to John’s wings. His gaze turned to John, eyes sharp. “Why did you lie?” he demanded.
dragon eggs come about?”
There was rustling from the bed, and then one of Sherlock’s hands cupped the back of his head lightly and brought him slightly forwards until his lips brushed against something warm. After a moment, he realised it was Sherlock’s cock, and John moaned breathily. Above him, Sherlock chuckled softly, and then Sherlock’s cock was being pressed into his mouth. John didn’t fight it, but instead relaxed into the feeling and opened his mouth even wider. It felt good, for his mouth to be filled like this.
John gave Sherlock a smile and turned to go, then turned back and said as a thought struck him, “I never received your last gift,” he told Sherlock with a slight frown.
John suddenly felt exhausted and, as Sherlock gently lowered him onto the soft bed (really, it was almost as soft as the cloud he slept on) he knew that it was mental exhaustion, and not physical exhaustion that made him feel this way. Sherlock lay down next to him, and John comfortably snuggled into his side, and smiled at the feel of Sherlock’s soft wings brushing over his skin. He knew for a fact that Sherlock was covering him completely from anyone else’s eyes, and, if anyone walked into the room, all they would see was Sherlock. John gave a smile at the protectiveness his Devil –
“Now,” he crooned, walking over to the dresser and rifling through it before pulling out a pair of black silk panties with a tiny crotch and hardly any back. It was more like a G-string than panties, “You’ll wear these to make your Alpha happy, won’t you?”
“I’m fine,” John assured him, rolling his shoulder and grimacing at the stiffness.
“Good… boy,” Sherlock murmured, his eyes closed.
John could feel the tension easing out of him at the gentle affection, his eyes closing. He felt safe, and secure. This human Alpha would care for him and protect him, John could sense it. And in turn, John would devote himself to his Alpha.
Sherlock had left him behind.
John rested his head back against the trunk and closed his eyes, relaxing in Sherlock’s presence and enjoying the peace and quiet. It was a comfortable silence, not at all awkward, and John liked that they didn’t have to attempt to make small talk.
The next day, John woke early, feeling much better. He showered and shaved (his facial hair had gotten out of control during his heat), and then dressed, wearing the clothes that Sherlock had bought him, including the panties.
The gun nudged him to walk, so John walked, and heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath. “You’ve injured him,” Sherlock said in a low, dangerous rumble.
John took it with a small smile and plucked another of his feathers, roughly the same size, and handed them both over to Sherlock. “Now. Tell me what you see now,” he instructed, heart pounding slightly faster.
“You look happy,” Sherlock commented with a smile as he strode towards the bathroom.
“If you were a werewolf, this would be so much easier,” John fretted, fidgeting restlessly and gesturing with his hands as he spoke, “Then the bullet wouldn’t be a problem as the body would simply spit it back out and all I’d have to do is bandage up the wound and your body would heal itself!”
A hand slid up his chest, then fished under and pulled out the collar. Instantly, Sherlock stilled and his scent turned dark and dangerous.
Two days after he’d gotten the call (it had taken him two days because he’d been out in the far outer reaches of London tending to a patient – a
Halfway through his preparations, soft violin music wafted into the kitchen and John paused momentarily, glancing in the direction of the noise and found Sherlock swaying softly with the violin, eyes closed and a peaceful expression on his face. Mesmerised, John watched for a few moments before turning around and continued making breakfast (or lunch – he had yet to look at a clock) with the music soothing him.
John grasped his wallet from his back pocket and flipped it open, holding it out in front of Sherlock’s good eye and watching as he scanned over it carefully before meeting John’s gaze once more with a smile.
The world John lived in consisted of mostly Betas, with the occasional rare Alpha or Omega. Alphas and Omegas were treasured, and an Alpha and Omega meeting was extremely rare, so the government had set up centres were Alphas and Omegas could go to meet others and hopefully mate and bond and produce more of them.
Sherlock gave a soft giggle, and John lifted one wing to smile at him, before placing a finger to his lips and lowering his wings again. “I’m hiding,” John whispered loudly.
They asked him to come in and take care of Sherlock Holmes – one of the most wanted criminals in England. He was shocked, but accepted.
Sherlock started humming softly, and long gentle fingers stroked over John’s wings. Giving a content trill, John relaxed almost completely, his body complete jelly and in Sherlock’s complete control. Sherlock’s chest was vibrating gently under John’s chest, and he could hear Sherlock’s soothing, steady heartbeat. The perfect melody to send him to sleep.
*.*.*.
” he shouted at Sherlock, his eyes blazing.
They’d planned on renting a room in a hotel on the night of graduation (a nice hotel, and Sherlock had refused to tell him how much it would cost) and there they would have sex for the first time.
At the command, John almost instantly orgasmed, back arching and he cried out.
He would call her later, when she’d finished work, John decided. Moving over to the couch, he settled the warm egg into his lap and called his boss. He informed her that he was taking a month off with annual leave, and didn’t say much about it. For some reason, he didn’t want to tell anybody about the egg until it was hatched and wouldn’t come to harm.
No response. Leaning his head closer, John could hear Sherlock’s breathing. It was deep and even, as if he was asleep. Frowning, John shook Sherlock lightly. The Alpha in Sherlock would surely have reacted to his Omega’s presence, so why hadn’t Sherlock woken up?
“I love you too,” Sherlock purred, nuzzling the back of his neck.
“Hello,” he was greeted civilly, but there was clear worry in Sherlock’s eyes, a slight frown on his face and he had wrinkles at the corners of his eyes that only ever appeared when he was stressed, “I’m looking for my pet. Have you seen him?”
Hands cupped his furry cheeks and tilted his head up to meet his Alpha’s gaze. “Thank you, John,” he was told softly.
John quickly obeyed the command, slipping back into sleep and curling up into Sherlock’s body, feeling safe and content and loved. Even if Sherlock hadn’t said it, John knew that Sherlock still loved him.
John was relieved to find that she was still alive, and after checking her over, he found a blow to her temple which he assumed was the reason why she was passed out. Looking up for his patient, his gaze was drawn to Sherlock, who had a fellow prisoner pinned to the ground and a grin on his face. He looked alive in a way that John hadn’t seen yet, and John liked it and decided instantly he would be following Sherlock on lots of cases after this.
A darkness blotted out the sun, and John sighed. A cloud, perfect, he thought sarcastically. He really liked the sunshine. Wait. It wasn’t passing over. In fact… It was getting denser…
John smiled, a hand coming up to gently stroke down the black, smooth, scaly back. There were soft, tiny, hardly noticeable spikes along it. “I thought dragons had armour,” John said in surprise, sitting up a bit more.
John wavered a moment, but as Sherlock’s hold on his chin tightened slightly, he blurted out mentally,
*.*.*.*
Sherlock sighed again, and nipped the tip of John’s ear.
“Is-is Sherlock home?” he asked, his voice wavering.
“Alright, then,” John said, and hummed softly, lifting his arm carefully to take the packet from Sherlock’s sharp teeth, and headed over to the cupboards and retrieved a plate and a knife.
After an indeterminable stretch of time, John opened his eyes and flexed his wings. He should get going.
The third time, John returned to the flat. Well, not quite. He sat on the bench facing the flat and watched the dark flat, wanting to go in a curl up with Sherlock, but knowing that he couldn’t. He was too lost in watching the flat for signs of his Alpha to notice someone approaching him from behind, until it was too late. A hand clamped down on his shoulder and John bolted out of the seat, teeth bared in a defensive snarl that died on his lips as he realised he was snarling at his Alpha. His gaze turned down then to the side, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.
“Good,” John replied with a nod, stepping back, “I’ll be back in a week to check on you.”
John shivered, gaze flicking to meet Sherlock’s and licked his lips, wishing he could kiss Sherlock. He didn’t answer Sherlock, instead moving to peer into Sherlock’s ears.
Dragon eggs all took different times to hatch, between a few days and a month. He would need to stay by its side and care for it and make sure no harm came to the precious egg in his hands.
Sherlock looked affronted for a moment, “Then, you know, I -,”
“Okay,” John whispered in agreement, not wanting to move just yet.
“So when are we going to take down this murder ring?” John asked to once again distract Sherlock.
John could feel his heart melting with each word, a soft smile curling his lips upwards at Sherlock’s sweet words. Resting a hand on his belly and stroking softly, John wished Sherlock were here so that he could kiss his sweet Alpha. Not being with Sherlock was hellish, and John wasn’t sure how long he would be able to cope. Especially since he had Sherlock’s pups in his belly.
The egg was a forest green, a gorgeous, bright colour. It had been weird, being pregnant even though he was a man, and even weirder giving birth to an egg. Sherlock had protected and treasured him throughout the entire pregnancy, spoiling him and making sure that he rested and didn’t do anything strenuous. Sherlock had even put up with the mood swings, and the cravings, never losing his temper.
Sherlock didn’t laugh, but his lips twitched up in the corners in a show of amusement, his gaze focussed intently on the prisoner underneath him. A Beta, but a Beta that had threatened Sherlock’s pregnant Omega mate. John didn’t envy any of them right now, but a glance at Sherlock showed his mate was tense, but still and waiting.
that he was a Sub, he could easily pass as a Dom if he wished. John didn’t care how brawny or big a Dom was; he refused to submit to anyone unless they earned it.
That stopped John short, his growl fading away in confusion, sniffing the air again. No, this was definitely a human. Yet, he acted and spoke like an Alpha. If he were a wolf, John would have instantly recognised him as one, and yet he was a human. And this human had killed the hunters? John’s head tilted, relying on his other senses to bring him more information about this human, seeing as his sight was fuzzy and he couldn’t focus on anything. He focused in on the human’s heartrate, and it was steady. Not lying, then. His nose picked up the faintest scent of human blood - , no, two different kind of human blood. Two hunters, going by the smell of the metallic weapons that humans used.
“You can’t come with me,” John snapped, “You’re not old enough to be able to turn invisible, and you’re too vulnerable to come with.”
“Mm, I know,” John responded, kissing Sherlock chastely before leaning against him and turning on the Telly.
John blinked in surprise, but nodded. “Alright. I’m sorry,” John apologised softly.
John raised an eyebrow in response, recognizing the voice as that of the young teen who’d given him her phone number. No doubt Sherlock was on his way, hopefully with backup.
“Then why did I throw up?” John cried, distraught and hating it when Sherlock was mad at him.
John kept his eyes closed and opened his mouth as ordered, completely relaxed and sliding into that now-familiar headspace where all that mattered was whatever Sherlock would give him.
Concern and a little panic overwhelming him, John rolled Sherlock onto his back, and checked his pulse. It was slow, but not dangerously so. Why wasn’t Sherlock reacting at all? Resorting to desperate measures, John sent a wave of fear through the bond, but Sherlock didn’t even twitch. Something was seriously wrong.
“I don’t know what you mean,” John responded quietly, his lips quirking up in amusement.
John gave a nod, and then turned and allowed himself to be led away and outside the compound.
what you were worried about earlier, wasn’t it?” Sherlock said, sounding genuinely perplexed.
Sherlock paused for a moment and looked up at him, and John whimpered needily, shifting his hips eagerly. The silk of the panties feels nice on his heated skin, unlike the ‘scratchy’ material of the other clothes.
“My parents,” Sherlock spat out the words with such hate that John whined again, “Shh, sorry, I’m sorry my dear. It’s alright.”
Sitting down in the bedroom feeling embarrassed, it was only a moment later before Sherlock burst into the room. His eyes fell on John and John saw the confused frown on his face.
They stayed like that for a while, just lying there and enjoying the warm water. Eventually, John pulled himself upright and quickly washed over Sherlock’s claws and body and then his own body, before standing up and setting Sherlock down on the countertop and drying him off with a fluffy towel and then drying himself off.
An Omega’s heat was only triggered by an Alpha, as it would be wasted on Betas as Betas’ cocks weren’t long enough to reach their cervix, and didn’t have the knot to keep in the sperm.
Sherlock stood.
“Of course I will, you git,” John teased, smiling and was pleased when Sherlock returned the smile.
Sarah gasped, and then tears came to her eyes. “I’m sorry! Please, please, give me another chance! I don’t want us to be over, John!”
Sherlock was frowning in confusion, and he gently took the pencil, gazing at it, before his eyes widened, and John knew he had finally remembered. Sherlock stroked the pencil reverently. “I remember making this,” Sherlock said in a soft whisper, hardly audible.
Any other day, and this kind of back-talking would have had him punished for sure.
John twisted around and stood up, placing his hands on his hips and frowning at Sherlock. “Surely, that’s not-,” John started, but was cut off as the door behind him banged open, and he found himself being pulled backwards by hands under his armpits.
“Look, Sherlock,
Sherlock stared up at him for a few moments before slowly grasping his hands and standing by his own strength. Sherlock pressed a kiss below John’s ear and then murmured lowly, “I’ll get you out of this, John, don’t worry. I promise you’ll be back in Baker Street by the end of the week.”
John spent the next few weeks examining his wings. The silver on his wings slowly started to turn to grey, just a few centimetres up from the tip. It was hardly anything, hardly anything anyone would notice, but to John, it was blatantly obvious. He became self-conscious about his wings. He only saw Sherlock once in those few weeks, and while he was away from Sherlock, the change in his wings stopped.
. Pulling back, distraught, John caught a glimpse of a women winking at him before she disappeared. Instantly, John started running back to Baker Street, wanting to get back to Sherlock. He didn’t like it. It was wrong. Sherlock was the only person who was meant to kiss him and touch him and that woman was
Sherlock glanced at him, and then back to his experiment. The dismissal hurt, and John averted his gaze for a moment before taking a deep breath and straightening his back.
*.*.*.
John cursed loudly as his knees gave out, and he crashed to the ground, hitting his head then everything went dark.
“It’s very nice,” John managed to get out as he rested his leg in the middle of the room, leaning on the cane and lifting his foot from the ground slightly to relieve the pressure on it.
“Ta,” John said, rubbing his wrists. “I’m getting a bit on for this whole kidnapping thing,” John sighed as Sherlock released John’s feet as well.
Sherlock paused and licked and kissed John’s back and shoulders as he waited for John to adjust to his massive length. John whined and shifted his hips backwards when the slight pain had subsided and all that remained was pleasure.
A shaky sigh was all he got in response, and John quickly called his boss to say there was a familial emergency, and dashed off. The traffic was awful, so he ran the entire way back to the flat.
John realised then that Sherlock and Mike had never met.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and flopped back down onto the sleeping roll, and waved a hand imperiously towards the corner of the tent. Curiously, John crawled over and found a tray, and lifted the lid off. His mouth watered as he gazed at the food.
“Yes, now, John,” Lestrade told him, and John stood and turned to face his Alpha with a small smile.
, John begged desperately, hips shifting in need of release.
After a hesitant moment, the dragon took a careful step forward and pressed his small head against John’s cheek.
must be John Watson then! I’m such a huge fan!” She pressed closer to him, looking up at him in adoration.
“Piss off,” the Dom returned.
to be with Sherlock again, but he didn’t want to risk them getting caught and becoming Fallen. He met Sherlock’s stare and just sat there and lost himself in that intense gaze.
Upset, John had gone, hopefully lingering on the doorstep and asking quietly, anxiously, “How long?”
Sherlock said nothing, but the look that he graced John with was full of scorn, and a hint of something else John couldn’t decipher. Sherlock’s long fingers clenched in the back of John’s jumper for a long moment, then released as Sherlock swept in front of him and knelt down in front of the body and started explaining his deductions.
Sherlock’s hands tightened in his fur. “You’re lying,” Sherlock said, and he sounded surprised.
During the night, they tended to drift apart in their sleep, and then come back together, except with Sherlock generally spooning John from behind. Sherlock would wrap both sets of wings around him, and John would be unable to move or squirm away, and it was an absolutely wonderful feeling to be held that tightly.
*.*.*.
John made his way to the university that he and Sherlock shared, and he went to the cafeteria, getting a tea for him and a coffee for Sherlock and then went to their meeting spot. John was surprised when arms came around him from behind and nuzzled his neck. John tilted his head back automatically and gave a smile.
Sherlock snorted. “Of course.”
“Really?” John asked softly, curiously. “Most Alphas come here and try and find the perfect, traditional submissive Omega.”
“I like you like this,” Sherlock murmured, “All vulnerable and submissive. It pleases me.”
“How could you possible know that I applied for the army?” John questioned.
“No, but you are pregnant. I can smell it on you. Surely, police coming around and asking questions whilst you are without your mate would be upsetting?” Sherlock said with a querying hum.
” John asked in shock, creeping forward hesitantly after glancing around the flat.
“I know,” Sherlock rumbled, pressing a kiss to John’s neck, “I didn’t want to, believe me.”
“Enough,” the human spoke, voice sharp with command, “You couldn’t do anything to me, not in the state you’re in, so shut up.”
John followed her trail, keeping to the shadows so he wasn’t seen and it didn’t take him long to catch up to her.
Wondering if he would be able to speak again, John reached up and patted Sherlock’s face gently, “Sherrrrl’ck,” then patted at his own chest and said, “John.”
John was following Sherlock onto yet another crime scene. John didn’t mind going to crime scenes with Sherlock – watching Sherlock’s face light up in excitement as he solved the puzzle was always well worth it – and he rather enjoyed it. Especially when they got to tracking down the suspect and Sherlock would let John chase the suspect. It was fun.
The next few days flew by. Lestrade (the DI) woke up and ordered Sherlock out of the prison. The media went into a frenzy, claiming Sherlock to be an ‘Alpha dedicated to his work!’ and praising him for his faithfulness and thanking him for keeping London safe.
Later, after the exhilarating chase after a cab and then back to Baker Street, after the drugs bust, when Sherlock had dashed off without John, and Lestrade had given his little speech about Sherlock becoming a good man, John paced the flat.
“It’s nice to know you care,” John smiled up at Sherlock.
Lifting the note to his nose, John inhaled deeply and hummed in content. It smelt like Sherlock, and that soothed him. Unfolding it, John read it curiously.
“Of course I do,” John said with a curious frown. “Why, what do people normally say?”
“Uh, what?” John asked, blinking owlishly. It was early morning –
Three days later, the first gift arrived. At first, John assumed that it had been sent to the wrong person. On his kitchen table, were two bags, with a sealed envelope sticky-taped to the outside of one. One bag was filled with several types of tea. Very expensive tea, he realised upon looking at them closer. Confused and curious, John looked into the second bag. It was filled with gourmet easy meals, and John frowned in confusion. Next, John carefully peeled the envelope from the bag and turned it over, surprised to find a black seal. Peering at it closely, he could see the imprint of a wolf face. Was this a family seal, or a personal one?
John sighed. “That doesn’t matter. Are you going to kill me or not?” he asked, fighting hard to keep his voice even.
“Is it murder?” She asked, staring up at John with wide eyes.
Sighing, John lifted his pillow and retrieved the envelope under his pillow, curious, but knowing he shouldn’t read it. Rolling out of bed, John felt itchy. Frowning in discomfort, John shook his head and stood, hoping he wasn’t getting sick. He disposed of the note in the sink and then went and took a shower after placing the envelope for Sherlock’s landlady into his wallet (he had to fold it to get it in, but he figured that wouldn’t matter too much.
“What is?” John asked, not wanting to move from the comfort and safety of Sherlock’s wing.
So, they were most likely in an abandoned building somewhere. Not in the center of London, as he couldn’t hear traffic. Probably in the industrial area, where there was less traffic.
John broke the kiss, panting, eyes closed, as Sherlock sped up, pulling almost completely out before thrusting back in, brushing against John’s prostate and sending sparks of pleasure inside of him.
“Well then, do you want to continue playing?” his Alpha asked with an indulgent smile, and John nodded his head eagerly, squirming under his Alpha.
“Can I?” John asked hesitantly, looking back at Mr Holmes and Mycroft, Mr Holmes gave a faint smile and nodded.
John placed his hand in Sherlock’s and let himself be tugged out of the tent and into the open air. They walked in silence past all the tents and into the surrounding trees. They didn’t need to talk, and it was comfortable silence as they made their way back to the clearing in which John had first approached Sherlock.
