“Well well, brother mine, you should be a detective,” Mycroft deadpans, then drops three more pies in Sherlock’s plate.
He wipes away the secretions and blood staining Sherlock’s genitals, makes a sign to Mycroft, who lets go of Sherlock’s legs, which both fall sideways, like lifeless, rubber members.  Sherlock is trying to catch his breath.  The contraction is over.
John gives Sherlock a languid hand job while murmuring at his ear exactly what he wants to ear.  Sherlock comes with a raw cry within two minutes.  There is water everywhere on the floor.
They can hear Mycroft’s voice from the kitchen.  He got on his phone as soon as they arrived.  Even though John cannot make out the words, he guesses Mycroft doesn’t have good news, and knowing him, it must be extremely annoying.  He’s used to getting what he wants, when he wants it, but it appears even the puppet master of the British government doesn’t have any power over the elements.  Huh.  Who would have thought?
While they watch the corpse of Margaret Grey, (who died seven days ago from a stroke) being dragged out of the water, shivering under a light snow, Sherlock explains the motives to Lestrade.
"The capacity of liquid absorption in natural fibres regarding... Anyway, you wouldn’t understand.")
Sherlock tilts his head and stares at him for at least three long seconds.  Then, there it is, the left corner of his mouth lifting.
Putting the pack of Earl Grey on the counter, he turns toward Sherlock.  He doesn’t have much time, he knows.  Sherlock’s brain gears are in motion, and moving fast.  It’s a matter of seconds before he figures out why Mycroft had wanted to see John.
"I don't know... More sharing, I supposed, and belly rubbing, and consulting parents-to-be forums and... hell, have a plaster made of your belly, or something equally ridiculous.  I don't think you would have found yourself so damn scared if we had taken the time to enjoy this pregnancy properly."
“ALRIGHT,” John shouts, ex-captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers in full display. “Sherlock, stop fighting us.  Mycroft, follow my lead.”
Sherlock is in the same position as John left him in three hours ago, sitting at the kitchen table looking down his microscope.  He’s still wearing his pyjamas and blue dressing gown.  When John doesn’t say “hi”, just walks into the kitchen and fills the kettle, he pushes himself away from the table.
"... Coffee and then he looked at me in a very strange, very un-Lestrade way and took a sip himself.  He's heard me, I can tell, although he is clearly out of his depth trying to figure out how to react to the situation.  Which, well, besides congratulate me, what else could he possibly say or do?  And now, all of New Scotland Yard will know.  I am mad at myself, John, to feel so incredibly uncomfortable with the knowledge.  How am I responsible for Lestrade's awkwardness?  Surely there is nothing especially extraordinary in being with child - care for some water?"
“But what if it doesn’t work between us, won’t it leave Sherlock worse for wear?” John asks shyly, trying to process the fact that Mycroft keeps complimenting him.
Sherlock seems like he's about to close himself off again.  John takes his chin between his fingers and initiates the movement.  Sherlock follows.
"This isn't about the fear of their actions being uncovered," Sherlock murmurs.  "The violence of it suggest that Green is a psychopath who was just waiting for an excuse to turn into murderer."
"You want me to cook brunch?" John asks, because now, apparently, keeping Sherlock well fed always improves his mood.  Something John wouldn't have thought possible before the pregnancy, but which he now uses wisely.  The haircut crisis seems to be over, but better safe than sorry, right?  Sherlock had mentioned French crepes two or three times only yesterday, and John has found a wonderful recipe, with a honey brown sugar sauce.  This should keep him happy for the rest of the day.
"Hey, I...let's forget it, ok?" He pleads, taking Sherlock's hand.  "Forcing you to remember painful stuff is the last thing I want.  The hell with the money, pay for the baby stuff however you want to pay, alright?"
John curses under his breath, hearing the woman's voice.  Claire Green.  He lifts both his hands, slowly.
“Ok, hmm... Ok.  Mycroft, you need to get the fire going, we’ve put it out not even an hour ago, it shouldn’t be too hard.  And after that, well...last time we were here I saw a fuel generator in the shed behind the house.  I have no idea if it’s working, but it would be good to get electricity back in here.  Alright?”
“How are things at Baker street, Dr. Watson?”  Mycroft asks, playing with his closed umbrella resting at the side of his chair.
It's not been an easy day.  The temperature outside reaches thirty-five Celsius degrees and it's so humid, the air feels heavy and almost solid when you breathe.  Sherlock wakes up covered in sweat, with a headache that has him dizzy enough that John doesn't let him walk by his own.  He throws up the buttered toast he managed to eat for breakfast.  His legs are swollen, his ankles barely noticeable anymore.  Usually, a cold foot bath helps a lot -Sherlock is not prone to water retention, which, according to their doctor, he should be thankful for.  It really can make the last couple of months of a pregnancy completely miserable.
Short of breath, a bit dizzy from arousal and lack of oxygen, John lets Sherlock's cock slip out of his mouth as soon as it begins to soften
"Oh, do not stop on my account, please," Sherlock cuts him off, chin raised high, cold and composed. (One might call the expression he wears his 'resting bitch face'.)  "If you cannot stand the presence of a pregnant man."
"It's okay, John, I'm here," Sherlock says calmly, pressing his forehead against John's.  The relief in instantaneous but results in another bout of ugly dry sobs.
The abandoned building is three floors high, and seems to be in good shape, despite having been left to rot for more than two decades, according to Sherlock.  A police officer guides them to the third floor through a narrow staircase, the elevator being considered unsafe.  John cannot help but notice how slowly Sherlock walks up, with a hand under his belly and another holding the rail with a solid grip.  He also hears him panting, even though he does his best to be silent.  Restraining himself from offering his arm or suggesting he takes off his coat - it's ridiculous to wear it, given the warm temperature - John prays once more for the case to be one of those Sherlock solves in minutes, bragging in front of Lestrade and complaining he's been disturbed for nothing, before exiting the scene in dramatic fashion.
“Despite what Sherlock has everyone believe, he doesn’t hate me.  My brother calls and visits me on a regular basis.  You two are not attached to the hip, you know.  Sherlock still does things without you, although it appears to be less and less frequent lately.”
John tries to calm down.  He waits, eyes closed, letting his guard down.  Tries to remember the movie he saw last week, the one he enjoyed so much.  There was a cop and a-
Lestrade, Donovan and a young officer are in discussion a foot away from the corpse.  A forensic technician is busy settling his digital camera.  Two other officers are standing near the door.
The Beeks family story doesn’t have a happy ending, but given the circumstances, and thanks to Sherlock, the outcome is the best anyone could have hoped for.
Amy lays an arm on his shoulder.  "Ah, Sherlock, I wish I could provide you with certitudes, but the truth is, these things happens.  You aren't responsible.  As a matter of fact, so far, you've been a perfect patient.  You are doing everything to provide your baby an optimal development."
"He... well... It was a close call, you know," John says hesitantly, finding that he's in fact trying to explain Sherlock's behaviour to himself as much as to his sister.
Sherlock does.  It doesn't take long before he finally becomes silent, hiccupping still between too deep breaths, but he's getting there.  He sniffs wetly.  John figures he'll be able to make him smile soon with a couple of snarky remarks about snout and his favourite jumper.
"Ok.  She's been dead for eight months.  I guess a few more minutes won't make a difference at this point."
Sherlock once more wraps his arms around John’s neck, and John holds his waist, massaging his lower back.  Sherlock’s forehead is resting on his good shoulder, and he knows he’s being careful not to use the other one, not to hurt John, even though he is the one in pain.  Thinking about it has John’s throat swelling. He gets himself under control quickly. He won’t bloody cry in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock snorts. “I need quiet, uneventful days.  I want to be very lazy while you spoil me rotten, until our little acrobat is ready to join us.”
John smiles, tilting his hand down below Sherlock's belly to rub at his cock, already half hard, a tensed bulge trapped in soft cotton.  Speaking dirty to Sherlock can leave him stoic and bored, but providing the most basic sort of affection can result in him coming in his pants.
John probably would have reacted more strongly if Sherlock's hair had been that short everywhere, but some curls on the top of his head have escaped the scissors. It's a nice haircut, to be honest, and once the shock has passed, John finds he quite likes it.  He should say something, he must have been silent for way too many seconds for Sherlock's liking.
Except it is false.  John had known from the beginning that although Sherlock wore his clothes like an armour to conceal any sign of weakness, he worries about his physical appearance, and is, as a matter of fact, extremely insecure about it. The need to control everything plays a part of it.  John had once caught Sherlock replacing a rebel strand over and over again, in front of the mirror, adding product until it was perfectly tamed.  It is a good example regarding the scrupulous way he treats his physical appearance in general.  Control, always.
And he must have said at least some of it out loud because here they are, the most gorgeous, intelligent, piercing eyes in the world.
“I know, but at least your brother promised it would stay out of the news.  What happened today is ours, and only ours.”
Sherlock shakes harder, enough for John to worry and strengthen his hold while pulling his head back so that he can look at him.
He runs his finger low, under his belly.  "It might be the location of a sensitive nerve," Sherlock sighs.  "Hold your horses, Doctor Watson," he adds when John begins to reply.  "I know.  She is starting to be quite confined and must have difficulty moving as much as she used to."
Sherlock smiles at him and bend down, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.  "I was ashamed to tell you, and there you are, surprising me once more, by taking my defence."
What a crazy life they lead.  It isn’t the first time a criminal wanted revenge for having been caught.  Sherlock is used to making enemies -he even brags about it.  Most of the time, it’s no big deal.  Because of his markers all over London, his homeless network, and having the British Government as a Big Brother, Sherlock can easily take the upper hand on any potential individual or collective plotting against him.  If it comes down to a physical assault, well, John isn’t only following Sherlock around to ask stupid questions.  Besides, although he likes to see himself as Sherlock’s protector, he has to admit Sherlock is a formidable fighter; agile and silent, deceptively strong: his technique is unique, a result of his boxer training and his knowledge of some obscure martial art called Baritsu.  His hits are few but always efficient.  He knows exactly where to hit on the human anatomy to have the best results.  “Because I fight with my brain,” he had once told John.
Sherlock has both arms over Mycroft's trapped shoulders and his chin resting on his brother's head.  "Thank you," he says, holding him even closer.  "I really appreciate it."
John makes up his mind and sits back between Sherlock's legs, ignoring his groan of protest.  He shuts up and gasps in surprise when John takes his cock between his fingers, lifting it away from his testicles.  Sherlock hums under his breath and his already erect cock hardens more under John's touch.
There is something in his voice, a caution, as if he's onto something he doesn't especially like.  He turns his head toward John, revealing how pale his face has become.  "A little help?"
"Doctor Ben Wilson came first.  Given his age, he is the most experienced of the lot.  He's also the most well-known androcologist in the greater London area; he has received several awards and published articles in prestigious science magazines.  However, he's in it for what it can do for him.  He has fed his ambition, has played the London political game with a cleverness that I cannot help but admire.  For the past several years, though, he has spent more time giving conferences or sitting in his pompous office, giving interviews, than delivering babies.  Long story short, he's a pretentious arsehole and I'm certain he would be the one Mycroft would suggest."
Sage lets go of Sherlock’s nipple with a soft “pop” and then yawns, before she shoves her tiny face into Sherlock’s bare chest.  Sherlock observes her with a wide smile.  Once more, his eyes fill with tears.  He curses at himself and wipes them away.  “Cannot wait for my hormones to settle down,” he grumbles.
John nods.  He wishes Sherlock would come closer, but doesn't know how to ask.  It is usually the other way around.
"Sharing, mostly.  It's always you and me against the world, you know, and we've treated the pregnancy so clinically.  I mean, even when we went shopping... we had our list and we were all about efficiency and... I mean, you picked all the newborns pyjamas while I was checking the list, and they are folded in the baby's room, ready to be used and I can't even name the colour of a single one."
He listens to Sherlock's lungs, searches for swollen glands in the neck area, then he tests the pupil dilation.  It is a little slow, but it might only be because Sherlock has spent many hours in the darkness, and is lacking sleep.
It's good to feel content and peaceful, for the first time in a month. The vomiting spells that had began plaguing Sherlock in November had soon become problematic enough to consult Dr. Brown. As it had turned out, Sherlock has been suffering from severe morning sickness, a condition that is prevalent amongst carriers.  It got to a point where John had to drag him to the A&E, after Sherlock had fainted at the end of an especially violent episode.  There was a limit to what John could do, at home - he could keep Sherlock hydrated, using the intravenous way if it became serious, but had no power in stopping or even diminishing the episodes that would happen several times a day.
Sherlock interrupts for the first time.  "General anxiety disorder coupled with a form of PTSD, most probably.  Paranoïa."
“That’s it, Sherlock,” John says, delicately sliding his index around the birth canal, “that’s a good one, keep going.”
He hears Greg explaining to Sherlock they haven't found any personal item allowing the identification of the woman.
After a long second, Sherlock seems to get a hold of himself.  He sighs and lays his arms down close to his body, as if to steady himself.  “Of course.  You need the rest.  It is a quarter past three in the morning.  According to your doctor, you will be allowed to go home in a few hours if you keep improving.  I have asked Mycroft to have clean clothes sent to us.”
"Making people around me miserable, because that is how I feel. It is such childish behaviour. You are right; sometimes I make it difficult for you to love me, despite the fact that I would most probably die if you were to leave."
He always has to ask, because neither he nor Sherlock enjoy it when he wears a condom, so Sherlock is on the pill, and knowing how serious he is about not finding himself pregnant, John doesn't take any risk.
Sherlock listens carefully, answers the question in a remarkably calm and contained voice, then gets out of his pocket a small notebook in which he’s noted well... everything. How could John have missed this - Sherlock transforms everything, every situation in a potential file, or graphic, or spreadsheet.
“That is a freaking faith leap for someone who doesn’t believe in love. “It is, isn’t it?” Mycroft’s disdainful smile is back, with a vengeance, it seems.  “I am not arrogant enough to think I’m infallible, though, so I need to conclude our little conversation with a warning.”
"Trust me, Sherlock, if you had told me something like that I would remember.  Plus, it's not like you never speak to me when I am not actually there and you forget.”
This chapter is Mycroft-heavy, and maybe you will find his behaviour unusual, but it is wanted that way.  For those of you who are interested, and have watched the fourth season of the show, I wrote some notes at the end of the chapter about Mycroft's character and how I personally view him.
“I am sorry,but we can’t wait, and I promise I will do everything for us to be left alone as much as possible once we’re at the hospital,” John says, trying to keep his voice low and even.  “We have a new plan, that is all.  We gather our things, I call Amy, and we leave for St Mary’s.”
John can see the tug of a hardly supressed smile on Sherlock's face, which has him going from tears to a hysterical, gravely giggle.
("Stop being such a child.  You asked for my help, this is me helping you.  You will come with me to the class or..."
"What?"  He asks, breathless.  He lifts his head long enough to nip at Sherlock's neck.  That beautiful, creamy neck he's been staring at for so long.
Which is why, when Sherlock loses his main distraction while on strict rest, John elaborates a plan to prevent him from falling into his usual vicious circle of boredom and melancholy.  It is a strategy very similar to what you do when you have to take a kid on a long road trip, or get him to keep calm at church, with a different activity planned for each waking hour and an emergency plan in case everything else fails (Sex. The emergency plan here is sex.)  All of this without forgetting Sherlock is everything
There is an impatient knock at the door.  Sherlock brushes past John, an amused smile on his face.  "Is it too optimistic to believe he could die from the shock?"
John figures he's teased Sherlock enough already.  After all, it isn't what he needs right now, and although John might still be surfing the wave of excitement from knowing the sex of the baby, he needs to step back a little, to understand the aftermath of a sudden rush of emotions for Sherlock.
The kettle starts to whistle, and for a few minutes, John busies himself making tea, missing most of the conversation -for some reason, Mycroft is speaking in a soft, very low voice, and Sherlock does the same, probably unconsciously.
John and Mycroft exchange a silent look.  It’s happening, Mycroft’s eyes say.  Yes, it is, John answers.
", which owned him a severe and disapproving look from the driver, fuck him,) with the intention of getting properly plastered.  After a shot of tequila and half a beer, he had felt like nothing would go far down his throat anymore.  He had walked for a couple of miles, his head filled with too many thoughts, unable to concentrate on any of them.  Then, the icy cold February wind had gotten the best of him, and John hailed a cab, because as many hours it would take to get back home, John would have to face Sherlock sooner or later.
"Why would I be obligated to save Scotland Yard’s clearly over-rated arse each time they stumble onto their own feet?" Sherlock snaps coldly at him.
"Bloody hell, Mycroft, it's been two days!  Aren't you supposed to be the British government?  How can you monitor your brother's life with an obsessive accuracy and not know where he could've gone?  Jesus CHRIST!"
Sherlock’s face has tensed and his mouth has quirked into a little grimace.  If he knew he actually looks a little like Mycroft when he does that, it would probably set him off like a rocket.
And maybe Sherlock is not only brilliant but a bloody mind reader because at this exact moment, he speaks, just loud enough for  John to hear him.
He is exasperating, and frustrating, and yes, sometimes, so immature it's easy to consider him like a child that needs tending, but Jesus, John isn't worthy of him if he regards him, even for a second, like a burden.
was, without a doubt, the victim they were looking for.  They wouldn't be sure until they found the baby she had or the father, unless they found something at the shop to compare the DNA they had extracted from the body.  Anderson's team was already sweeping the shop.  Sherlock had pointed out all the clues that had led them to the shop, and explained in a voice too quick for anyone to catch every word of it, how a simple mathematical formula about factors of correspondence meant he was right.  Then, he had called a cab and dragged John with him, keeping silent despite Lestrade's questions.
Sherlock nods eagerly.  "The contractions too.  I haven't had one ever since they installed the monitor."
"Because of this, of me!" Sherlock replies.  "I cannot do it, and I cannot have a child.  I... I'm not a good man, John.  You know that.  I wouldn't be able to give a child what it needs.  I am not fit to be a father - most of the time, I don't even think I'm fit to be a lover.  And, God help me, I am terrified.  I... I know the facts.  Carrier pregnancies are not easy: there is a high risk of a miscarriage, more than with women, up until the second trimester.  Half of the births have to be through c-sections, due the tightness of the birth canal.  Also, natal deformities are more frequent, just as are the risks of eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and an array of other symptoms that are exclusive to male carriers.  And this is barely the tip of the iceberg; hear me out because I did some research and, although the first carriers have appeared more than a hundred year ago, social norms are still conservative.  It is not unusual for carriers that decide to have a child to suffer from the stigma of their particular status.  Children born from same-sex parents are more likely to be bullied.  As for the medical care, too few gynaecologists decide to specialise in male pregnancy, there are also numerous statistics tending toward the difficulties to be treated, as well as assuring a follow-up during the-"
And then, to John's astonishment, he lets his large right hand rest on the patch of skin below his navel.
Then he swallows Sherlock's giggle by kissing him, covering his belly with his arm.  The silence between them is peaceful while they remain in that awkward embrace for several minutes.  Sherlock nuzzles John's neck, sucks lightly at the sensitive skin, keeping his mouth there afterward, the warm, delicate skin of his lips barely making contact.
Or maybe taken off guard, just as John is.  He goes back to his spot near the window to let the pale sun caress his face.  He might as well - if the brothers have decided to ignore him, he could tap dance in a kilt between them without being spared a single look.
"You did well, love," John murmurs, sitting on the edge of the bed so he can take off Sherlock's shoes.
John laughs too.  It hurts like hell, but he doesn’t care.  He’s alive, Sherlock is as well, and for now, it’s more than enough.
"What is it, Sherlock?" John cannot hide his exasperation.  Sherlock definitely has something to say about finding Beeks and meeting him.  Tomorrow.
"What?" Sherlock lifts himself on his elbows.  "What is it, John?  I am usually the one saying 'oh' and then refusing to answer."
It takes  a couple of seconds before Sherlock lifts his head.  Even then, it seems to be with great effort.  He looks down at John, waiting avidly for reassurance, and his trust is once again complete and pure -naive, some would say.  Whatever.  They aren't geniuses.
"How's your head?" Sherlock asks, managing to type on his phone with his free hand at the same time.
And okay, John didn't think it was possible to lose an erection when so close to coming, but apparently, Sherlock's declaration does it.
am having a baby," Sherlock says harshly. “Unless you want to climb here with me and have a probe shoved so far up your arse you feel like vomiting.”
The cottage is lovely.  It's a small, two-storied stucco construction, with large windows and a garden full of flowers and herbs, surrounded by an iron fence decorated with swirling patterns.  It stands alone on the cliff above the ocean, and there is a path down the rocks leading to the beach, which John had forbidden Sherlock to try, not in his condition, and not before John has tried it himself.  Other cottages and summer houses are scattered here and there, all accessible by a common gravel road, but they are far enough from one another that it is easy to forget about them and feel like the hills belong to yourself.  The landscape is amazing, and with the breeze from the ocean John feels like he never knew what it was like to breathe so deeply before they came here, with the air so pure you feel drunk on it.
Sherlock is now bright red.  "I know it doesn't make sense," he mumbles.  "But tell me, John, what am I supposed to do?  You think that when I told you I couldn't do it on my own, I was making an overly dramatic statement after a life-threatening situation? It is a fact.  I cannot raise a child on my own.  I can't.  I would've never even think of having a child if it weren't for you."
Ok... John relaxes a little more.  Maybe everything will be alright.  He should really learn to trust Sherlock's capability of behaving normally -almost normally- as it has happened more and more ever since they got together.  Then a sudden question catches John's attention.  Amy Brown is asking if there are any twins in both their family.  John shakes his head, certain Sherlock is doing the same.  But no...
"Yes, a simple civic ceremony, no fuss, just a couple of guests, or would you prefer the whole church religious experience?"
“I’m having a baby, you genius,” Sherlock snarls, and it’s reassuring to hear him acting normal again.
Mycroft put a hand on his shoulder, still and cold, showing he’s not used to those sorts of gesture.
"Shush," Sherlock is saying his forehead leaning against John's.  "Shush, John.  I won't let you go, I swear, please, please don't speak."
John blinks, surprised to see Sherlock staring at him, hands shoved in his pockets, a small smile tugging at his lips.
John nods.  Sherlock looks like he's about to address the most pressing issue, John can tell by the way he's fidgeting.  The doctor in him wants to put Sherlock to bed and let him rest, but he can't.  They need to finish this.  Sherlock, especially, needs to express everything that's been going through his mind for the past five days.
"Her name wasn't Camila but Alexandra," Sherlock tells Beeks without turning his eyes away from the picture.
"Oh please, do not lay that thick, gooey crap on me.  I am Sherlock Holmes, not a bloody social worker wishing to make the word a better place."
It's a coincidence to meet Sarah there.  She's with her brother and a couple of cousins.  After some hesitation, John agrees to joins them.  Sarah's cousins are both paramedics, his brother is a respiratory therapist (apparently, health-related careers are a tradition in the family) and the four or them seem to be enjoying themselves.  John ends up having a very good time.  He's glad he and Sarah remained friends when things didn't work out between them. She's a great and fun friend to be around.
Mycroft will get the upstairs master bedroom.  As they did when they first came to the cottage, Sherlock and John are downstairs, once again out of necessity.  Sherlock’s legs are sore and swollen: it would have been cruel to get him to take the stairs several times a day.  His only complaint is that that the small bathroom on the ground floor is so narrow he can barely fit –he’s exaggerating, as usual.  Sherlock has put up a total of twenty-five pounds since he got pregnant.
With an impatient gesture, Sherlock wipes the tears on his cheeks.  "Well, look at me.  I'm pathetic."
“Yes, that is also true.  Would it surprise you, Dr. Watson, if I were to tell you that Sherlock never had a romantic relationship, or a single sexual encounter?  The furthest he got was kissing a boy when he was fifteen.  He’s disciplined himself ever since to treat his body like transport and eliminate everything that could get in the way of his thought process.  Is it the real reason?  Well, it’s not my story to tell.  The fact remains.  At thirty-six years old, my brother is in love for the first time, and you are the object of his affection.”
"There you go.  Now stop whining.  You barely wear it anymore, and it was getting worn out.  I don't see the point."
Sherlock's belly is expanding. He doesn't speak of it, but John has seen him more than once over the last week changing clothes with impatience, dropping them like they are nothing more than rags.  John waits for him to bring up the issue.  His belly is still pretty modest, but Sherlock has always worn his clothes as tight as possible without it being indecent -John has zero complaints on the matter, by the way- so it figures he won't be able to stretch the fabric any longer.
“Listen, Sherlock, I don’t know if they were contractions or not, but we’re going to the hospital anyway.  There is nothing to panic about or-“
He realises right then that he can have this.  He can touch Sherlock.  It’s a thrill that runs through his veins, setting him on fire.  His cock gives a soft twitch.
Louisa pushes her chair back.  "I need to get started on the Christmas dinner, John.  Would you like to give me a hand?"
"And you wonder why I rejected intimate relationships for so long, John - look what it makes people do," Sherlock had said harshly.  To which John had easily replied, sliding a hand around Sherlock's waist and cupping his belly, "yes, and look what it can also do."
John grabs the soap and begins to wash himself, and it takes a few minutes before he realises Sherlock hasn't begun yet.  He's standing right under the spray, arms wrapped around his too thin body, eyes closed.  He doesn't seem distressed, or lost.  Just... pensive.
“Oh.” John is aware of how disappointed he sounds, but come on.  There is nothing worse than the feel of having lost something you didn't even get to have in the first place.
After three glasses of wine, he was explaining to Anderson how to differentiate normal footprints from those of people with a limp, and at one point, he had patted his head, an affectionate smile on his face.  "Don't worry, you'll get it someday."  John and Lestrade were watching from a distance, giggling openly, and of course, Lestrade had the camera of his phone turned on.
Sherlock's face has found its place in the crook of his neck once again.  His breath comes out in small, warm puffs, damping John's skin.
"Sherlock has been ill, but he's doing better.  Still, he needs to build his strength back.  I assure you there is nothing to worry about."
John wonders when exactly his Sherlock has been replaced by a friendly doppelganger.  There must be something to explain his behaviour.  It is not that he is incapable of any interaction with people that are a little different, or that he hasn't tamed his emotional side enough to behave normally in those kind of situations - John would be an arsehole if he thought that way, as a matter of fact... Still, this is one of his tactics, when he wants to ply someone for information; he
“The landslide happened at six this morning.  It goes on for half a mile.  It seems therewere environmental studies done here five years ago, and the file had shown instability in the soil, due to an underground branch of the river, but it had been stamped ‘not urgent’ and ‘to be monitored.’” He states the facts almost mechanically.
.  As Sherlock and John were being cautious not to put themselves in danger, after what had happened to John a couple of months ago, they had proceeded as Lestrade always wanted them to and called him.  He had been the first one to arrive, and was waiting for them with bad news.  The family living there had bought the house from Stephen Beeks six months ago, and had no idea where he had moved.  The neighbours didn't know either, but Lestrade had called some more officers to interview everyone living in the small street.
Sherlock’s voice is reduced to a murmur.  He still can’t seem to look at John in the eyes.  “Despite the fact that you were put in a terrible position by a major failure in my deductions, you offered me to run when you would have stayed there and died.”
John fights to put his gloves on while Mycroft stretches over Sherlock, effectively keeping his legs open.  Sherlock curses in between moans.  John, seeing his hands scratching frenetically at the sofa’s fabric, swallows another lump in his throat.
"Does not make any sense, I know," Sherlock dismisses the idea.  "Nevertheless, there is a particular movement she does... with her head most probably, that gives me the very strong impression something - well, someone - is biting the inside of my pelvis... right there."
If you remember the warning for graphic birth in the tags of the fic, well, it starts now.  Those of you who read some of my other stories know that I like to go into great details to describe my labour and delivery scenes.  The warning stands for this chapter and the following two.  You've been warned.
Sherlock watches him drink from under his fringe.  His hair isn't as artfully done as usual, there is no product in it.  The curls are messy and frizzy, an array of small, shiny black corkscrews, looking as soft as cotton.  It makes him look young and carefree, which is a nice balance with the visible pouches under his red-rimmed eyes and the downward curve of worry on his mouth.
The more he speaks, the more John feels like an idiot.  Oh, it's so easy to call Sherlock a drama queen and childish, but he's no better.  He snorts.  "My god, I need a little action.  Sorry, Sherlock.  Seriously.  I shouldn't have taken your phone.  It wasn't my most mature moment."
There is no time lapse, no skipping ahead.  John is aware of everything, although he cannot really feel.  It isn't like seeing himself from the outside.  It isn't like being numb.  Somewhere in between.
As if on cue, his mobile rings.  His nervousness shows in the way he fumbles to catch it in his pocket.
The man's eyes crinkle, surgeons' version of a smile.  John regrets he cannot remember his name, nor the one of the A & E doctor who took care of him in stabilisation.  There will be time for that, though.
John is amazed to find himself grunting, marvelling at the assault of sensations.  He lets Sherlock push him on his back until he's stretched on the couch, so that Sherlock can settle over him, aligning their bodies just right. John makes himself pliant.  He's used to taking the lead -has always had a dominant side in bed- but right now, he holds back, letting Sherlock decide what he wants and how he wants it.  It seems to work, because Sherlock is overtaken by a whole body-shudder, and for a moment, he stops moving altogether.  He presses his forehead against John's, plastering himself against his body. Then, short of breath, he smiles -a soft, shy smile. John smiles back, sharing the air between them, rubbing at Sherlock's back with his hands, pressing them here and there because he needs so much.  Needs to be in contact with as much skin as possible, feeling the hot, lean body so close, like he doesn't know where he himself ends and Sherlock begins anymore.
Sherlock decides then to push John away, literally, planting both hands on his chest and going for it with a growl.  John stumbles back, falling in his chair so violently it almost flips backward.
John thinks.  Fast.  Sherlock has gone back to his previous state, panicked silence.  It is only interrupted by a short but violent bout of coughs.  That’s what gets John into action.
John can easily imagine a tiny head of curls, babbling and laughing.  He wonders if he would have been able to do so when Sherlock was still his new mad sociopathic friend.  Probably not.
It takes two seconds of reading before he gasps in shock.  Mycroft is staring at him without disdain or exasperation, giving a rare glimpse at who hides behind that mask.  He's anxious, and uncertain, and yes... emotional.  His eyes are shining.  He swallows several times in a row.
"Tonight," Sherlock says, almost shyly.  "I can give you a quick recap of the latest developments.  I didn't think you would want to be part of it."
John stays close, a few centimetres separating him from Sherlock.  Sherlock’s eyes are shut tight.  He licks his lips.
"Come on, John.  Sherlock already has copies of the majority of our cold cases, some dating back to the sixties.  I can't commit a murder just so he isn't bored.  I would, you know.  Just found out my dentist has charged me seven hundred and fifty quid more than necessary for my daughter's braces.  Bloody bandit.  What is he thinking?  He knows I'm a freaking police inspector, and he still tries to con me as if..."
John is by now used enough to assisting Sherlock to know what is about to happen.  He will give them several pieces of information while examining the body, then the crime scene, but with no explanation as to how he deduced them.  He doesn't like being interrupted while he's deducing.  John has learned to be patient, but given how exasperated Lestrade looks each and every time, he still hasn't.
(The only smile Sherlock allows himself is when he notices a small table filled with food, for an eventual break.  John can hear him whisper "Gingernut biscuits" as if he was saying the name of a lover.)
Sherlock tries to repress a lopsided smile without success.   John is about to suggest they move the massage to the bedroom when suddenly, Sherlock's feet slip away from his hold.  He looks up to see him standing straighter, one hand resting on his belly.  Sherlock's eyes are open wide and he frowns, seemingly concentrating on something.
"I enjoyed the war, Sherlock.  I hated it, but I was addicted to it.  I didn't became a soldier because I'm a good person.  I did it because I needed the adrenaline.
They have barely made it outside when Sherlock stops dead.  "Gavin?  Yes.  Yes.  You are looking for an immigrant or a refugee, someone who's presence here wasn't registered."
He feels honoured, although he can’t quite understand that someone as exceptional as Sherlock Holmes wants this. Wants
Sherlock opens the door to 221a, and freezes, a shocked expression slackening his features.  He pales at an alarming rate, and John stays close, just in case.
Given how complicated it has been to choose an androcologist, John is just happy to finally sit in her office with Sherlock.  Her name is Amy Brown -call me Amy, please- and she's in her mid-thirties.  She's a confident but easy-going and naturally chatty petite blonde, with glasses that seem too huge for her small, pointy face.  He likes her.  As for Sherlock, his face is, for the moment, impassive.  Unreadable.  He is too tense.
"Oh I am sorry, Sherlock, if I haven't considered those deductions, which would have been difficult since you haven't told me anything!" John replies, lifting his arms in exasperation."I am working nonstop to make you as comfortable and happy as possible, yet you haven't even noticed all the cleaning I've been doing, and the grocery shopping and buying the bloody couch, when you know how much I hate shopping!  And all the while you get to be the world's only consulting detective and I'm not even your blogger anymore, I am your housekeeper for Christ’s sake!"
Sherlock still seems to be in shock, unable to stop blinking.  John stretches his arm and caresses his belly, pressing softly under his navel.  “That’s where she is,” he explains.  “She’s already engaged.  This is excellent news, as far as delivery goes.  It means she hasn’t shifted position at the last moment, and that she’s already done some of the work ahead of the pushing phase.”
“Nonsense.  You are amazing.  Listen, I’m sorry to insist, but you need to let go.  You are working way too hard to keep yourself under control.  I know breathing through the pain is hard but-“
"I have a very personal reason to dislike the subject," he states.  "I am not considered, legally speaking, as an independent adult.  Mycroft became my legal guardian when I was twenty six.  He still is."
It might be shock, John thinks.  He doesn't quite know what to do but he figures the least is to give Sherlock space to digest the news.   It isn't like he's alright himself.  He knows what is coming.  Sherlock has made it clear from the start he doesn't want kids -and well, John hasn't been thinking about it for a long time.  Their lifestyle isn't suitable for raising children.  Sherlock is a handful already so imagine if...
Sherlock is raised on his elbows, staring at him with wide eyes.  John tries to smile; he hopes it comes out correctly, because he doesn’t feel like smiling.  At all.
"Harassing you?" John burst out laughing.  "Oh, you are precious, Sherlock.  Drop you damn phone, will ya?  This is the first time we're sleeping in your parent's house, it's Christmas, you are doing better.  Let's celebrate."
John tries to settle more comfortably, his eyes never leaving Sherlock's face.  He looks miserable.  His hair is flattened on one side, the curls drenched in sweat, his eyelids are swollen, his cheeks a deep red while the rest of his face is of a pasty white.  He snores because of the congestion, his breathing loud and laboured, his mouth opened. His nostrils are red and irritated, crusted with mucus.  A trickle of saliva is sliding from the right corner of his chapped lips, pooling on his chin. Sherlock Holmes.  So bloody human, and imperfect.  Weak, sick, scared. But also, more beautiful than John can ever remember seeing before.
"Nothing is wrong.  Well, my perception is, but that is a brain trick I am not immune to, obviously."
"Sherlock, I won't last long," John warns, taking a handful of hair and tugging to get Sherlock's mouth in kissing range.
It's hard to explain but Sherlock is... quieter.  It’s not at all like he’s brooding, those long days spend on the couch, barely moving, speaking only to provoke a reaction from John, when he’s in need of attention to say how miserable he is, and how boring life can be when surrounded by idiots and criminals that seem to do everything to get caught.  No, Sherlock isn’t moody, he’s just quiet. There is no other word John can find that describe it better.  With the quietness also comes a visible effort to act more like a normal flatmate.  He greets John when he comes back from work, sometimes even going to the length of asking how was his day.  He’s more polite, adding “please” and “thank you” when he does orders John around, once the cast is gone.  He will more likely spend time with him watching telly on rainy evenings instead of analysing fungus he’s been growing in Tupperware in the fridge.  Of course, for that last part, John is divided between pleasure and frustration, since Sherlock is prone to yell at stupid telly shows, guess the plot of movies, then yell some more when he doesn’t get it right, because
Sherlock pushes John away and lets himself slide on the floor, where he kneels, his upper body resting on the sofa.  He shoves his head between his arms and lets out a long, painful moan.  John is quick to kneel next to him, but when he starts massaging his back, Sherlock snaps at him in a shaky voice, “don’t touch me!”
"And since when do we follow the rules?  Listen.  It's clear that part of your life is still painful even to think of.  I never talk about my time in Afghanistan, and you never ask.  Why?"
In the ACD novels and short stories, Sherlock Holmes never mention his parents, but once speaks of his grandmother, from which Mycroft and him have inherited the intelligence.   He says she is part of an old french family.  Her name isn't said anywhere, though.
He will sleep, John can tell.  In the comfortable silence settling between them, Harry's phone call comes back in his thoughts, but he decides to let it slip for now.  He isn't sure what Sherlock's intentions were, or what his are, for that matter.  It can wait, though.  Right now, everything but Sherlock pressed close to him can wait.
“I do not think she has the tiniest of imperfections,” Sherlock goes on, avoiding John’s gaze.  “I observed her very carefully, but it seems I now have to make-do with a new lens added to my perception filter.”
next move instead of the other way around.  When Lestrade and John had found him, he was starting to show signs of hypothermia and lack of oxygen.  The doctor part of John's brain had insisted on analysing the situation.  Another hour and they would have found Sherlock's body.
"So that’s why you did it, then. You wanted to have - at least - the impression you were still in control."
Here’s the dilemma.  John has only two choices.  If he tries to make something up, Sherlock will figure out he’s lying and will quickly deduce what Mycroft wanted with John so soon after his own drunk confession. Then, well... there really is no way of knowing how he will react.
John mentally blocks Sherlock's nervous babbling and lays both hands on his belly, softly pushing Sherlock's one, and widening his fingers so that he covers most of it.  The skin is soft, and warm, but nothing can be felt besides Sherlock's breathing -he's not holding it but it is very shallow, surely to give John a better chance.
“While I think it’s not wise but reasonable to visit this Beeks guy tonight, you are the genius after all, and you would never have suggested it if you weren't convinced there was no danger, not after my...um... incident with that knife-wielding girl."
"I really was looking forward to it," Sherlock complains, moving his arse with intent, just to get John going.  As if he needs any incentive besides Sherlock being... well,
And here they are, absolute beginners, an ex-soldier turned blogger for a mad genius solving crimes, who found themselves insanely in love with each other, now about to have a child, like the most bizarre romantic comedy ever.
And John has the loveliest view as Sherlock grabs a pad on his desk and bends down to scribble some notes.  He wishes he was thirty again, so that he could take him right there and then, for sloppy seconds.
Sherlock has yelled the last few words, his faces inches away from John.  And God knows John would like nothing better than to indulge him, but the matter must be addressed. More time won't do them any good.
The spell is broken abruptly by a long, wet coughing spell.  It's harsh enough to have Sherlock struggling to breathe.  John helps him into a sitting position and softly rubs his back, telling him to breath and not to panic in a soothing voice.  When it ends, Sherlock takes a couple of shaky breaths and lies back down, a perplexed expression on his face.
John nods.  Sherlock has revealed himself very skilled when it comes to feeling their daughter and identifying the different positions she's been adopting ever since she was big enough to allow it.  John figures he finds comfort in it. It's knowledge, after all, and knowledge has always been Sherlock's ultimate weapon against fear and insecurities.  Given that with a pregnancy, so many facts remain unknown, of course Sherlock will try to reduce that list as much as possible.
Mycroft nods and moves swiftly to John's chair.  His face is a little pale and his grip deadly on the umbrella's handle.  The next quick look Sherlock gives John is one of surprise, mixed with a bit of confusion.
"Yes," Sherlock admits bluntly.  "Nevertheless, if you think we should wait until tomorrow, I will follow your lead."
Something completely unexpected happens. Laura McMasters doesn't turn left, or right.  She stops, makes a 180-degree pivot and...
John goes to Sherlock and grabs his hand.  He needs to be solid, needs to be the rock on which Sherlock can lean.  He finds he still is able - at least partially- to separate himself from his emotions, an old trick he learned in Afghanistan. Well, not so much learned as developed unconsciously.  You cannot care for a patient with the world exploding around you if you’re unable to compartmentalize.
The thing is, when I first began writing this story, I needed to imagine how Sherlock and John had become a couple, and it was so important to me I couldn't just fit it in a couple of flash back, if I  had began the story with Sherlock already pregnant, does that makes sens?  So I decided the first part would be the boys getting togehter, and it also allowed me to settle them in a time and universe I wanted them to be.  That's why, amongst other things, I began by killing Moriarty, because if I did want Sherlock and John to have been working together and gotten to know each other as in canon, I didn't want the shadow of Moriarty looming over them -and eventually their child.
"Hum... Puppeteer isn't the correct term for Moriarty.  He was a predator.  Yes.  A spider tending a gigantic web and playing with the flies caught in it at his convenience.  He did not lead a luxurious life, wasn't looking for power, or fame.   The only desire Moriarty had was to spread chaos, death and misery.  Once the puppet show was over, all he had to do was to retreat in the darkness while other people paid for the crimes he was consulted for.  There would always be another representation, Moriarty made sure of it.  Why? Moriarty did all this because he liked it.  He was a psychopath with a genius mind, and boredom was slowly but surely killing him. Doing what he did not only made his brain work to its full potential but helped alleviate the apathy that was plaguing him.  Long story short, he did it for the simple pleasure of it.  Oh, Donovan, I see how eager you are to point out how much alike  Moriarty and I are.  Please let me help you with that.  As I'm referring myself to the only consultant detective in the world, he was the perfect antagonist, being the only consultant criminal in the world -well, as far as we know anyway, right?  He was a psychopath, and I a sociopath, and although the terms are meant to have different meaning, they are constantly muddled up, even amongst specialists, because of the very subtle differences between the two.  Moriarty's genius was the only reason he became interested in me in the first place, because he felt we were the same.  It is true that carrying the burden of a superior mind can isolate oneself when amongst ordinary people, and...  Where are you going?  It is quite rude to leave in the middle of discussion."
John, too, has been scared.  He has known cases of severe morning sickness that had been resistant to every treatment, one in particular where the birth of the baby had had to be induced, two months in advance, because both the mother’s and the child’s lives were at risk. Luckily for Sherlock, the drugs are efficient.  He's been taking them for a week now and has only been sick twice.  He follows the doctor's orders carefully, eating small meals several times a day, taking vitamin supplements and resting as much as he can -not that he really had the opportunity to do otherwise, with how weak he had become.
Sherlock is hurt, underneath his sudden coldness.  What a stupid misunderstanding.  John would be upset at Louisa Holmes, except he knows very well what it’s like to know an addict closely.  How many times did Harry promise she was stopping for good,
John decides to let it go and leaves Sherlock to dress himself.  He's visibly overwhelmed and needs time to process.  Hell, John himself does. Seeing the living proof of the beginning of a life, rather than just
While the paramedic is busy following his orders, John gets Sherlock's trousers and pants down.  "Sorry," he murmurs, rubbing Sherlock's cold leg soothingly.  "Can you bend your legs for me, Sherlock?"
The cab driver seems to be the chatty type.  John closes the window between them before he can start talking.  With what might be unnecessary force.  He feels nervous.
“Sir!” A police officer yells at him, using the megaphone.  “Please remain at a safe distance.  We can’t assure your safety.”
John sighs in contentment.  Everything he feels right now brings him pretty damn close to happiness.  Sherlock being a carrier stays at the back of his mind, though.  If John did imagine himself as a father when he thought the key of his happiness was the whole wife-kids-house-in-the-suburbs package, the idea had slowly but surely lost its appeal when he began living with Sherlock.
There is too much noise for John to hear what Sherlock is saying, but he can easily imagine the conversation, how he seems to speak too quickly for Lestrade to understand, and the detective's annoyed expression confirms it.  The only difference is the handful of tissues Sherlock presses against his nose here and there.  It is strange, John thinks, how it gets to him.  Day after day, the duality that is Sherlock's personality reveals itself a little more.  As much as he adores Sherlock Holmes, the world's only consulting detective, too brilliant, mad and beautiful (in all his aspects) for John to be worthy of him, he loves the other just as much.  Sherlock, a thirty-six-year-old man, human (so much more than he lets on), achingly fragile and imperfect.  Sherlock who whimpers sometimes when he sleeps, who drools all over his pillow when he's tired.
John thanks him, then begins apologising, but Lestrade stops him mid-sentence.  "I think it's a bloody right to fall asleep in someone’s company when you've just survived death."
Sherlock obeys, and by the redness of his face and the breaking of his voice, it's necessary.  He's panting now, licking his dried lips.  If John is honest, he hasn't followed the whole tirade, mind blank except for the simple fact that Sherlock is pregnant.  Funny, right?  He's known it for five days but now...
"Sherlock, what would you do?  You've just said  you are not good with free time, and we've only been here for two weeks... Imagine, oh, I don't know, your entire existence?"
John covers Sherlock’s lower body with a sheet and looks up at him.  Sherlock is staring back over the swell of his belly, looking wild, but calmer.
"No, it is ours.  Please, John, something as tedious as money doesn't mean a thing to me, you know that."
While speaking, Sherlock has dragged himself slowly to the new couch and dropped on it without his usual grace (that grace that becomes rarer each day that passes.  Even though Sherlock had stated early on that he would not became one of those pregnant waddling people, it seems he cannot escape a certain clumsiness).
And before John can answer, Mycroft gets away, runs almost, to the stairs which he climbs four by four.
Although John is always eager to insert himself between an assailant and Sherlock, he knows, objectively, that Sherlock is perfectly capable of defending himself.  He's seen him fight: he is precise and strong; his hits are few but almost always efficient.  When someone goes after him, he doesn't try to escape.  He faces his adversary, always ready to fight.
John doesn't do a andrological exam. Better not to put the birth canal under unnecessary stress, it could worsen the bleeding.  All he does is evaluate the state of it.  It is still normal.  Sherlock's testicles are a bit swollen, but it happens frequently with male carriers into their third trimester.  Blood is still seeping out, but it's a very thin trickle mixed with sweat.  There are no clots, and the smell is normal.  John asks Maria for an amniotic liquid tester stick; the small absorbent paper will turn pink if there is amniotic liquid in the substance analysed.  He sighs in relief when the test is negative, as it means the blood is not coming from the uterus, and Sherlock's waters haven't broken.
"You are extraordinary," John murmurs, kissing the damp curls at the base of his neck.  "And you're mine, and I promise always to come when you call me back home.”
It came to John's knowledge, when he pushed the issue, that Sherlock had been terrified by a tale Mycroft used to tell him, about tiny aliens hiding inside kid's navels so that they could eat them while they slept.  He had been so scared he would cover his belly button with layers of tape before going to bed.  Sherlock might have admitted it when he'd been drunk on three glass of wine - aah, Sherlock drunk is so mellow and likeable, tipsy, funny, with that light lisp from his childhood worsening gradually.  His arrogance turns paternalistic and indulgent, as it did that one time when the people from the Yard succeeded in dragging Sherlock to the pub.
Sherlock shivers and, annoyed at his reaction, keeps staring at the ceiling.  But he also touches his lips, something he does when he gets aroused.  John loves it, how young he seems, then, running his index finger over his swollen lower lip, his eyes darkening.  It's a shame he cannot see them.
"So it means the chances of having twins is more important, given your genetic heritage," Amy Brown joins in, as if John didn't know it already.
“Sherlock, you should widen you stance a little, it will allow the ishial spine to pull back,” Mycroft instructs.
"Sherlock, what is this about?" Mycroft complains, closing the door behind him.  "You very well know I have no time for your stupid little guessing games, this better be-"
This isn't just hesitation.  This is a decision that has been made.  It might have already been made five days ago.  John tries to find the right words, but he can't.  He had known it would be difficult, but was also convinced that Sherlock would go through with the abortion, in the end.  What he had feared were the consequences of it, and how Sherlock would deal with the aftermath.
Sherlock is working on his experiment outside, and has to be called in so that he won't skip dinner.  The sun is warm enough to have left a pink tint on his cheeks. He has a soil stain on his chin, and the old jumper he's wearing is covered in dead grass.  This is such a unfamiliar look for him John feels the first tendrils of desire rising from his lower belly, and wonders if he'll ever get used to it, to Sherlock revealing himself without artifices, without armour or mask.  Maybe not, and maybe that is how you feel when you love someone so completely.
Sherlock is silent, looking out the window, for the first few minutes of the cab ride.  He isn't locking himself away, as he has taken John's hand and is holding it, playing with his fingers.
It is finally over.  A nurse and an orderly take John out of surgery and into the elevator to get him to his room. On the way, a realisation strikes him, cutting his breath short.
Sherlock yawns until his jaw snaps.  He tries to stare at John, but his eyes keep rolling back, just like a baby fighting to stay awake.
John bends toward him so that their faces are inches away from each other.  He hasn’t let go of his hand.
Which is why he finds himself speechless when he can see Sherlock's nape, completely clean, most probably done with a clipper.  His long pale neck is exposed, the delicate skin scattered with red blotches, probably due to the edge of the plastic cover-up used to protect his clothes.  Not only is his neck exposed, but his ears as well: there, again, a clipper has been used on the hair around them.
Sherlock, who was barely irritated with Anderson's reaction, doesn't know how to take this sudden act of kindness.  He grabs his punched shoulder very slowly and blinks.  For at least three seconds.
“Of course, here we go.  That’s it.  Better?”  He asks, his voice back to the calm, controlled tone he has been careful to use.
Sherlock turns away from his mother and walks past John without even casting him a look.  John doesn't try to hold him back, just watches him disappear inside. He supposes the pregnancy surprise is more or less ruined by now, anyway.  He might have underestimated how sick Sherlock actually looks.  It's always like this, with the people you see every day.  Any change that is gradual goes unnoticed because you don't have the necessary detachment.
"I will judge myself," Sherlock cuts him off harshly.  "We need to do what is best for our daughter; there is no other option for me."
John had tried to bring the subject up a couple of times when he had realised that the more time passed, the more difficult it would be to discuss their confrontation, but Sherlock had cut his tentative attempts short, because it was "distracting him from the case."
"Well, Amy recommended we do not huh... practice penetration -on your part of course, but she assured me anything else was safe as long as the physical exertion isn't exaggerated.  And, you know, even penetration is, theoretically, inoffensive, but she preferred to stay on the safe side."
“I know you. You’ll occupy yourself by sneaking into other patients’ rooms to deduce their illness, or you’ll find a way to steal cigarettes -which is, by the way, a euphemism for
The contraction is over.  Sherlock turns his head to look at John.  His eyes are still huge, and more scared than John has ever seen them, except maybe for that time John had been stabbed in the thigh.
I've seen the best of people whenever it happened.  And the worst.  I began to realize that, if most of the people in need of help were sincere and reluctant to receive it, others were using the generosity of others to ask for money for the most ridiculous reasons.  One person in particular would regularly beg for money, as if internet was a viable source of revenue, and she would snap at anyone pointing out she was abusing. Others would ask only once, but they weren't in any kind of difficulty : it was to finance the decoration of their office, or to be able to buy a fifth photo op at a convention.  It was sad to see how an act of kindness could quickly become a way for manipulators to get money when they felt like it.
John smiles at Sherlock's confusion.  The detective doesn't see it, busy searching his mind for a potential fault he might have committed.
They’ve tried the most common position, which has the patient lying on his left side, with his right legs propped up by pillows (or in this case, Mycroft) but Sherlock didn’t like it.  He’s back to kneeling on the sofa, his upper body supported by the armrest.  It isn’t an easy position for John, who has to kneel too, head tilted to the side to have a clear view of his birth canal, but the pushes are extremely efficient that way.
"Because you didn't want me to take it in the first place, and after what happened at the crime scene, I figured you might think it was better not to get involved.  I had no choice, though.  There was an important amount of information I had gathered at the crime scene and had no chance to communicate to Lestrade.  I thought all I would do was make sure he had everything and then step out.  As if," Sherlock shakes his head with a small sarcastic smile.  "Of course, for every piece of information I gave Gerald, he had a dozen follow-up questions, and he kept sending me pictures and new pieces of evidence and facts.  I got caught up in it despite my best intentions.  It is baffling to think the Yard does solve some crimes correctly from time to time.  Their incompetence is egregious."
"Yes," Sherlock shouts, although they are inches away from each other.  "Yes, I am, but I refuse to think about this.  Why are you forcing me to go back?"
As always with Sherlock, it generated from an accumulation of small stuff.  Should have seen it coming.  John knows that, after two whole weeks without a case, he's basically tip-toeing around a time bomb.  Sherlock's ennui and frustration have been growing steadily and reach the point where anything is a pretext to pick up a fight, with the first person that crosses his path.  Given John's status as flatmate and lover, well...  yeah.  John knows his patience with Sherlock puts people in awe.  He's been asked so many times: "how do you put up with him?" he would be stupid not to have realized it.
That is where John makes a mistake.  The snort that escapes out of him isn't voluntary.  Put it to nervousness; he is certain he wasn't finding it funny until his body decided otherwise.
"I know." John kisses the top of his head.  "That is why I enrolled us in a couple of prenatal classes."
"But how can I think about anything else?  My mind keeps suggesting scenarios of all the different ways it could have gone wrong..."
Sherlock sighs and lays back on the bed.  "I am going to rest.  I might have caught cold, again, which is highly unpleasant.  It will be the third one in the span of six months.  Ridiculous."
are good.  John feels as if they've just reached another step in their relationship maturity.  It is almost scary how much they have talked about the real things lately.  Scary but, yes, good.
John is very glad, then, that Sherlock loses interest in scaring Anderson and walks quickly towards the body, because he does not hear one of the cops murmuring.  "Yeah, the freak definitely needs some space," referring of course to Sherlock's weight.
This is part 6, accomplishment, and it's complete.  It's been done for a while now, because I wanted the beta work to be all done and now I am able to post each chapter one after the other, give or take a few hours.  I will at the end of chapter four write a note specifically about the choices I have made writing Sherlock's labour and delivery.
"Let's say we do start a relationship," John murmurs, getting out of his thoughts.  "Wouldn't I be like work for him, something he would become addicted to?"
"I don't even realise I'm doing it," he admits.  "It is such an old defence mechanism I am having a hard time getting rid of it."
.  Just admitting this to himself makes it easy to push back his silly fears of being abandoned if he isn't needed.  Sherlock doesn't love him because John reminds him to eat and sleep, or to be polite and considerate.  Sherlock loves John for everything he is and everything he isn't.  And he deserves to come to terms with his old demons, to realise how wonderfully human and compassionate he is when he thinks and acts according to his heart.  They are going to have a little girl.  Sherlock has to believe in himself, and stop worrying about his competency, or absence of.  There is no doubt he is going to be an amazing father.  John needs to make him understand that loving isn't about learning how to do it correctly.  All you need is a big enough heart, and this, he already possesses.
“John.  Calm down.  I am waiting for my assistant to call me back.  We are getting Sherlock out of here.”
"Sherlock, we've had our fun.  And by the way, the fact that our idea of fun is robbing your brother of hundreds of pounds is worrying me.  Anyway, this is our daughter, I would very much prefer if we use our money and share the costs."
"It's... " Sherlock swallows hard and shoves his head in the crook of John's neck.  "It makes me feel... exposed.  Right now it is still easily concealable, but frankly John, I doubt I'll ever get use to it."
A shiver goes through John’s body at the memory of the man’s crazy voice, going up and down, his disconcerting dead brown eyes, and how he had appeared to him at the corner of the street, smiling like a lunatic before using a Taser on him.
Sherlock has other ideas.  As soon as the flat’s door closes behind them, he takes off his shoes and walks to the living room, dropping his coat on the floor where he takes it off.  By the time John joins him, he's pacing, with both hands pressed together in a prayer position and tucked under his chin.
Sherlock shakes his head.  "No.  I intend to make the most of our free time.  We'll have to go back to London, eventually."
Sherlock sighs and stares at John, searching for something he cannot figure out.  Soon enough, though, the rolling table is out of the way, John's bedrail is lowered, and Sherlock sits by his side.  He bends forward and stares at John, still with intensity and concentration.  Then, softly, very softly, he kisses him.  Light, quick brushes of his lips, first on his forehead, then on his nose, and cheeks, and finally on his mouth.  John cannot help the relieved sigh he lets out. He feels so good with Sherlock close to him, safe and warm and... present. Having Sherlock's complete attention is a bit like being illuminated by the sun, its brightness and warmth.  It is only when it stops that you realise how cold and lonely you are without it.
, John thinks, clearly.  He wants to reassure Sherlock.  He is pregnant, he has to be careful. Stress isn't good, neither for him, nor the baby.
That won't do.  John grabs Sherlock's arm and pulls until he doesn't have any other choice than to sit/fall on his lap.  He still pouts but settles himself comfortably, his long legs stretched on one side, his upper body pressed against John's chest, waiting for John to wrap an arm around his back, which he does.
John finds himself blushing.  He can see the pleased smile Sherlock tries to hide, and decides he will definitely keep telling him.  They are both silent for a while, which is surprising.  John had thought Sherlock would get back on his phone as soon as they were out, or at least start babbling non-stop about the case.
, is what he meant to say.  John's doesn't know what he's imagining right now, but he is certain it is full of realistic details and scarily accurate. The blinks keep coming, ever so slowly, and as long seconds strech without any change, John snaps his fingers in front of him, worried.
This time, a whole five minutes passes before another contraction starts.  Sherlock refuses to move from his spot.  The best John can do is slide a cushion under his knees.  He encourages him to rest while he can, caressing his hair –it’s always done wonders to calm him down.  Meanwhile, Mycroft is walking back and forth, taking to the bedroom everything John asked him to.  It would almost be funny to watch him half walking, half running, with none of the slow, lazy elegance he usually displays –John is too worried to laugh, though.  He’s anxious to get Sherlock settled in the bedroom and to evaluate his progression, which won’t happen until after the next contraction.  When it finally comes, John can immediately tell it is a bad one, by the way Sherlock clenches his teeth as tears of pain slide down his cheeks.  The quiet moans are stuck in his throat.  He’s working hard not to be too loud, which has him breathing way too superficially, and must be physically exhausting.
Of course, I am going to ask for your understanding regarding the last 1.5k of the chapter (which begins when Sherlock and John go for a walk) because there will be mistakes.  If some of you want to point them out in the comments, I have absolutely no problem with it, just so you know, I will add the corrections anyway as soon as JJ finds a way to send me the beta'd version.  I hope the mistakes and grammatical errors won't prevent you for enjoying the chapter.  Thank you for your patience!
"Because right now I'm starting to think you have considered another option," John says, unable to turn his eyes away from Sherlock's stomach.
"What, no one told you?" John asks finally, when it seems the staring contest isn't going to resolve itself.
Sherlock is practically pleading, like he's convinced John cannot understand -something that, in the end, is so simple, so human.  This is how people end up having kids, after all, when logic and practicality fly out the window, replaced by dreams and desire, love and emotion.
Sherlock whines, covering his face with one of his arms.  He knows what John wants, but still fights it.  It's incredibly hot to hear him speak dirty, blushing at himself and swallowing the words.  So far, it’s true, John hasn't been able to get any real vulgarity out of him -
.  John shifts on his feet, looking at his lover squinting at deceptively insignificant plastic tube.  Guilt for what he just thought makes his ears burn.  It's so easy to go with the everyday routine (or absence of, in their case) and to forget, from time to time, how precious what's between them is.  Sherlock has let himself be, so simply, despite how scared he's been -still is, sometimes, John can tell- to give way to his feelings. John knows how much effort he has to put into their relationship, just so he has the impression he behaves like a companion and a lover should behave.  And although John keeps assuring him he wants it all -the mad genius in all his contradiction, Sherlock keeps thinking he's not any good at it. John knows -he can read it in his eyes after sex, or in the middle of the night, when Sherlock wakes him up from a nightmare, so insecure, convinced he won't be able to give John what he needs.
He takes off his dressing gown, revealing his beautiful but definitely too-thin pale body, his stomach still hollow despite the pregnancy.  Sherlock is wearing nothing underneath.  Recently, he has taken up sleeping in the nude -as it apparently was his habit when he was living alone.  John loves it.  He takes his spot, lying on his left side and widening his arm in invitation. Sherlock joins him, folding himself easily into the little spoon position while John covers the both of them.
Sherlock opens his mouth but John doesn't give him time to answer.  "You will let me talk," he roars, summoning all his decreasing strength.
John smiles and keeps caressing Sherlock's hair, observing him to ensure he isn't caught in another nightmare.  Sherlock is frowning, but ever so slightly, like he does when he is impatient, or maybe exasperated.  John would kiss him if he wasn't feeling like a slug.
"It's okay, we're in no rush," John lies.  Well, kind of; his cock is definitely impatient to be taken care of.  But John also wishes to let Sherlock bask in his afterglow and relax, feel the marvellous boneless fatigue that follows an orgasm.  Sherlock, though, won't have any of it.  He manages to unbutton John's trousers and slide a hand inside his pants, wrapping it around John's shaft.  They both shiver.
“It is very strange to see my brother in this current predicament,” Mycroft whispers, just behind John, startling him. “The imperfection of the human brain, I suppose, but I have difficulties imagining him other than heavily pregnant.  It has changed him.  A lot more than I thought it would.”
Sherlock nods but it takes long seconds before he moves himself off John's lap.  He's still avoiding his eyes.
"I don't want tea," Sherlock snarls at him, like tea is the most disgusting thing.  "I want to stop acting like an idiot."
The sonogram is Sherlock's breaking point.  He has managed superbly, so far, given that early ultrasounds are performed internally and he finds himself in a hospital gown lying on a table, with his legs spread in stirrups and Dr. Brown's right arm disappearing under an almost translucent sheet covering his lower body.  Somehow, Sherlock's dignity is still intact.  He stays perfectly still, his head turned to the left so he can stare at the sonogram screen, his chin still raised in defiance as if John would burst out laughing regarding his position at any given time.  He listens to Amy Brown's explanations, clearly refraining himself from cutting her out because he already is an expert on prenatal development.  John watches him closely as the little bean (the
John is up and supporting him in no time.  Sherlock shakes.  Yes, more than time to go home.  He's going to have him eat a chocolate bar on the way back.
The only thing contrasting with it is the fact that Sherlock wears scrubs and that he looks exhausted, his eyes swollen and reduced to slits, a long scratch on his cheek, his curls a mess of strands standing in every direction.  God, he looks. So…
For Sherlock, it was.  He would have never admitted such vulnerability before, not so candidly.  John had felt how lost and scared he was and had tried to comfort him the best he could.  His due date was still almost two weeks away, after all, and it wouldn’t be long before Blair would be caught, not with so many people working on the case.  Blair had no experience with clandestine life, no helpful contact on the outside.  It was almost a done deal.  All they could do was wait.  They would be back in Baker Street soon enough.
"Yes, it is," Sherlock agrees with the same soft voice.  "But by then they were... say... at loss of what to do with me.  A judge once told me he was scared of what I could do with... What did he say?  That sick, incredible mind I had been gifted with, when I would lose control for good."
Well, maybe John himself won’t be much better.  He doesn’t have more experience.  Anyway, it’s not like they have the choice.  Suddenly, John knows exactly how he will occupy the next couple of weeks, and he decides, right then, that he won’t spare Sherlock.  It should be interesting.
Mrs. Hudson steps to the side and calls Sherlock, who is standing on the pavement, calm and composed.
"Oh god, will you just shut up, already." John covers his face with his hands.  "I don't have a fetish, I just like it, alright?"
In the hallway, while they walk toward the living room, a timid head peaks out of a door to their left.  It's a young woman with the typical features of someone with Down syndrome.  As soon as John looks at her, she lowers her head, her thin, almost baby-soft pale hair falling into her eyes.  Sherlock observes her with interest, and something almost imperceptible washes over his face, like a half second of enlightenment.
"He is because he gets bored, and sleep is a waste of time when he could be thinking, so I am not sure it counts."
“It’s only a supposition, of course,” Amy had said with a malicious smile, “but something tells me this little one will be a handful.”
"Of course I am.  I... this is... because of what I have become.  Tonight, I have taken decisions base upon my emotions only.  My... intuition," Sherlock almost spits that last word.
...well, lettuce.  Except of course, Sherlock isn't having a fit over lettuce.  Sherlock is upset because he's thirty-six weeks pregnant.  He's clumsy, has trouble sleeping, needs to visit the bathroom every couple of hours andhas a very difficult relationship with his digestive system.   Then there is the shortness of breath, and his brand new clothes already showing some strain over his ever-changing body.  John honestly thinks that if he were in Sherlock's place, he would spend his days crying in a foetal position.  So no, seeing Sherlock losing it over a vegetable isn't a reason formockery.  If you ask John, Sherlock deserves a bloody medal for not throwing fits all the time.
was allowed to criticise people in her own family, which Sherlock wasn't part of, and that "Gertrude has an artistic temperament, that is all."
"It does not mean the fear is gone, but it is... it feels... comforting, thinking of those couples."
As soon as the contraction is over, John wraps an arm around Sherlock’s shoulder and presses a cold flannel - brought by Mycroft at some point- against his face.  Sherlock leans into it, his eyes opened to slits.  “It’s... ah ....getting... extraordinarily painful... More than I ever allowed myself to imagine,”he pants, trying to smile at John.
Something in Sherlock's cold expression shifts, as if he can't keep the mask on.  Red blotches appear on his cheeks.  His lower lip is trembling.
John is in the middle of sitting up when a thought crosses his mind.  He smirks.  "Mrs Holmes?  You wouldn't happen to have a picture of that time he was running naked after the dog?"
Amy smiles and rubs his arm.  "I do know how it is to be a doctor and have someone close to you needing medical attention.  But it's more than that."
Hum... Surprise!?  My beta reader being made of awesomness, she took the time to work on the next chapter between Christmas and New Year's eve.  I have to warn you guys, it is 9.5 k and I know it's longer than the other ones but I couldn't cut back anything or split the story otherwise, because the chapter in itself works better that way.
"I propose we take Mycroft's credit card and drive to Babies R Us – such a ridiculous name - on Friday morning, before it gets too crowded.  We can achieve the list in two hours."
Instead, he tries to grab at Sherlock's shirt, needs him closer, needs his face to be the only thing John can see.
", John knows better.  He had seen the softness of his expression.  It is like here, in contrast to London, Sherlock's brain has slowed down a little, adjusting to their environment.  So far, Lestrade hasn't text or call for help, but it doesn't even seem to bother him.  He seems content to go through -again- his thick folder where he keeps old, unsolved cases. He has also begun an experiment in the backyard.  John hadn't asked what it was, or why it needed to be outside. When it comes to Sherlock and experiments, it sometimes is wiser not to know.  There will be time for wondering what the strange smell is, or why all the plants are suddenly glowing in the dark.
Sherlock blushes, it's visible from the kitchen.  John puts the teapot away and goes back to him.  "No, seriously," he snorts, trying stop his giggles.  "Thank you, Sherlock.  I am glad you like it."
John can't help himself, he bursts out laughing.  Sherlock stops mid-sentence, frowns, then throws him an outraged look and begins to protest.
It's not only the experiments.  Sherlock does not touch his website, or his folder of unsolved affairs.  He even texts Lestrade to let him know he is only available for "real" emergencies.  Lestrade text John back in a frenzy, worried something is wrong.  The answer doesn't seem to satisfy him.  He, too, has never known a Sherlock who would voluntarily take some time off to rest.
Sherlock does, with what seems to be a lot of effort to get his head and eyes to cooperate.  He's still blushing, how is it even possible.  His lower lip is shaking as well, and in his too wide eyes there is all the fear of rejection in the world.
Although Sherlock makes a point of not mentioning Moriarty again, to prove he's done with him, John knows the mad man is still pretty much alive in his mind, and that if Sherlock had just wanted to piss Sergeant Donovan off by establishing the resemblance between him and Moriarty, the thought is nevertheless quite disagreeable to him.
"I am not giving you a reason to call me an idiot," John protests.  "Is there anything else unusual?"
John sits up in shock.  Against his stomach, Sherlock's belly has been crossed by a strong wave, followed by a series of upward pushes, and as he looks, its shape shifts again, as if, for a second, only the right side of Sherlock's stomach is indeed containing the baby.
The realisation that this man is, in fact, Margaret Grey's nephew pops into John's mind like a firecracker.  He hadn't been with Sherlock when he had met the man, but everything in his behaviour practically yells his identity.
"That's not how it works, Sherlock," John explains.  He tries to catch his lover's eyes, but they are fixed on an empty space behind his shoulders, it seems.  "We fight, sometimes, it's normal.  And then we fix it and we go on.  Like everybody."
"I'll have Cheerios," Sherlock mumbles finally.  "John, stop hiding. I am not about to eat you out of spite."
"Of course I am bloody right!" Sherlock roars.  "But what would you know, huh?  It is so easy for you to comfort me and to stand by, acting like a damn idiot in front of a computer screen, father to be, witnessing the MIRACLE OF LIFE!  At the end of the day, nothing has changed for you.  Nothing."
It had been a long day, with much to think about.  That is how the morning after, John is going through the papers once more to be certain everything is in order when he hears the first note of one of Sherlock's own compositions. It is a new one he has entitled
There is a light sound, a polite throat clearing.  John gets out of his own head and sees Mycroft looking back at him, both eyebrows raised.  He is probably thinking about the tediousness of letting goldfish brains work at their own, deplorable rhythm.
John tries to find a correct answer.  He knows Amy is right, and he does trust her.  It's no revelation that Sherlock's own trust in their androcologist relies heavily on John's opinion.  What is really getting to him is Sherlock's fear and worries.  Gosh.  How much does he keep to himself, refraining from talking about it because he thinks it is not normal, it isn't how a normal human being is supposed to react to being pregnant?  And the worse thing is John might already know this, at some subconscious level at least.    He might know it, and be too damn cowardly to try to fix it, because he doesn't know if he can, and it sends him back to his own fear.  If something were to happen, god... If something were to happen to Sherlock, or the baby...
"I don't care.  He'll tell me when he's ready.  Now, you really expect me to believe you cannot use your influence to set him free without having him submitted to a new examination?"
The tugging in itself has the effect of an electric shock.  Sherlock lets out a yelp and tilt his head back, panting loudly.  Too bad for the kiss, John thinks, and doesn't care.  He could easily finish just by watching Sherlock coming apart.
John doesn't even try to hide his irritation.  It has been a while since Sherlock had enjoyed dismissing his own very average intelligence.  As it turns out, it still stings a little.
He loved her, and she kept saying the only time she ever felt safe was with him.  Then, she fell pregnant, and it seemed that, for a while, she was more relaxed, almost happy.  She agreed to go to all of her doctor's appointment and even took a prenatal class with Beeks.  She was excited to be a mother.  After the baby's birth, though, things took a turn for the worst.  She was transferring her fears to Sophie, and began to worry that if her father found her, what would happen to the baby?  Despite Stephen Beeks' promising he would protect them both, she refused to hire a nanny, or to go back to work, and left the house even less often.  She loved Sophie, but she expressed, on more than one occasion, regret at have given birth to her, to have condemned her to a life of fear.  Beeks knew she was mentally unstable, and he kept telling himself she needed professional help.
Or maybe worrying about Sherlock is only, for John, an excuse to push back his own feelings (panic and fear, not necessarily in that order) and pretending he is the reasonable one of the pair.
- that would be the physical resonance of their love for each other, as romantic and cliché at is sounds, has a way of sneaking at the back of John's mind.
John lays the baby on Sherlock’s chest, careful not to compress the umbilical cord. He grabs another towel and gets on with cleaning the fluids and vernix, going at it quite vigorously to stimulate the blood circulation.  Sage is crying still, squirming on Sherlock’s deflated stomach and chest, the bluish tint of his skin receding rapidly to turn to a healthy pink.
“It is quite exceptional,” Sherlock agrees, using the same quiet tone.  “How can it be otherwise, though.  Isn’t today the birth of an exceptional human being?”
"It is your body, your decision, and you are right, we have decided together early on it wouldn't happen.  I told you, I love our lives."
A few seconds later, Sherlock says he’s ready.  They succeed in getting him up.  Sherlock’s legs are still shaking, but he holds his head high, trying to disguise his embarrassment at being half naked while John quickly wraps a sheet over his hips.
Mycroft finally arrives, and John can see Sherlock sigh in relief.  After their appointment, he had refused to sit down, asking instead to go wait for his brother outside. It would be nice, he had said, to stretch his legs and muscles.  He hadn't taken into account the too-warm temperature, and how his body would tire easily after two weeks of inaction.  By the way he's leaning against the brick wall, he's already exhausted.
"You keep your bloody eyes open, you hear me?" Sherlock spits, looking so damn angry, and that won't do, not at all.
Of course, Sherlock had done a personal investigation regarding Alexandra’s family, and had found that her father was now incapacitated, living in a nursing home.  He had assured Beek that no one was coming for his young daughter.  Alexandra would havean official funeral as soon as the body was released from the morgue.  Beeks was adamant on doing everything properly.
The position Sherlock hints at was one of his favourites when they first began their sexual relationship, and John suspects that it was more relaxing for him, needing not to sustain his gaze, when everything was new and too intense.  Once he's undressed they keep spooning.  John wraps an arm around Sherlock's waist and finds his cock filling up quickly.  He just holds it in his hand, marvelling at the pressure that grows steadily, the blood flow warming the skin, while tiny jerks course through it each time John moves his fingers.  Sherlock sighs deeply, turning his head to get a kiss, which John provides, groaning in his throat at how good it feels.  Two weeks.  It's been too long -not only for sex, of course, but yes... John has missed the sex.  He begins stroking Sherlock's penis, getting him to moan in pleasure, which makes him turn his head back to shove it in the pillow.  John is almost as hard, now, moving his hips with agility to make his cock nudge between Sherlock's arse cheeks until it gets trapped between them and slides in easily, aided by the abundant natural lubricant Sherlock secretes.  The smell is stronger, the fluids thicker, and it will remain that way until the end of the pregnancy.  John sometimes feels drunk on it, and tastes it each time he has a chance.
can hear the music?" He asks, letting his hand wander from the small of Sherlock's back to his neck, caressing the fine, downy hair there.
Sherlock is always eager, but rarely voices it so boldly. John sees the pool of precome sticking to his stomach and runs his tongue softly from Sherlock's balls to his glans, feeling the incredible hardness beneath the soft, burning skin.
Sherlock drags him down the bed on his back and nestles against him.  "Oh, the intellectual agony of a modest brain," he mocks.
John lifts her up, Sherlock’s voice coming to him like a distorted echo, pleading to see her, asking if she is fine.  His blue eyes stare into John, then at the small bundle in his hands, just in time to hear her first wail.
John fears the worst for this one, though, so long since the last case, but strangely, Sherlock doesn't complain once.  He has started a new series of experiments on the porosity of human fingernails and, at least to him, it is fascinating.  John, for himself, even agrees to give his own samples, as long as it keeps Sherlock happy.
"Go ahead," John says, willing himself to calm down.  "Solve your case.  This is absurd.  I was waiting for you to snap from the minute Amy Brown told us about the bed rest...and then it's
"What?  No, you're not.  I feel the same as you, Sherlock.  And it's okay to be a little overwhelmed.  You do not have to be ashamed of feelings things, you know."
After the fire is set to his satisfaction, John grabs his laptop and settles to write in the journal of Sherlock's pregnancy he keeps on his blog, on the private entries section.
Their joined panting echoes in the room.  Sherlock bends down and kisses John long and hard, before getting both hands on his chest while rotating his hips slowly.  John curses and grips his lover's waist, fingers digging into the pale skin.
He turns his attention toward the writing on the wall, trying to figure out a clue, something, and not worrying about Sherlock too much.  After a few seconds, Lestrade joins him.
Outside, thunder rumbles, and lightning strikes abound.  It has begun quite suddenly.  John wonders if it’s the same back in London, or wherever the secret army helicopter is located, and if it could take off as planned.  Mycroft’s phone has rung a couple of times, but he didn’t answer, finally discarding his mobile by throwing it haphazardly on the floor.
Mycroft nods, and goes for a tentative semi-smile that looks more like a grimace.  John has his hand on the door's handle when the other man calls him back.
John Watson hates Moriarty for all the hurt and pain he had caused to people, all the deaths he is accountable for, and he hates him even more for two specific reasons, the first one being how he had played Sherlock and enjoyed doing so, putting John’s friend under incredible strain by forcing him to follow his deathly, crimson trail.  The second reason, the most personal one, is because he had forced doubt in John’s mind, his actions making John wonder if, in fact, Sherlock and Moriarty were the same at the end of the day, like two sides of a coin.  For a few, dreadful hours, John had regarded Sherlock in the most horrid light, and had feared the feeling that was twisting his guts was
"You are getting better," he says, bending toward Sherlock so that he can kiss him properly this time, on the mouth.
Sherlock doesn’t wait another second and pushes, three short but strong pushes, before he collapses against Mycroft, still sobbing.  John tries to reassure him the best he can.  He had hoped the head would be out, and it almost did, but really, it’s a matter of minutes.  He coats his finger in lubricant and tries to circle the skin, but the head doesn’t leave him room, and when Sherlock yells, actually yells from pain, he stops.
"Damn if I know," Sherlock whispers, shifting from his "thinking" pose to a more relaxed one.  He crosses his arms over his chest and pouts, a true, almost cliché of a pout, his lower lip turned down and his eyes dark.
John stares at Mycroft for a long time.  He thinks he gets it.  That's how it goes with addictive personalities.  It's rarely just a single addiction.  It's a way of living.  It doesn't matter in the end, the level of seriousness, or danger, of said addiction, it all comes back to one's determination and capacity to resist.
"Why are you so shocked? You knew quite accurately what we were doing here," he states, tilting his head at Sherlock.  “I imagine you hadn't considered that I would take such an interest in John's project, not enough to provide some improvements of my own.  You thought about a microscope, maybe a working table and a fresh coat of paint, but nothing of this scale."
"No, I don't think he is," John murmurs, his voice breaking over the incredible amount of relief flowing through him.  The alcohol he's been ingesting since noon seems to double its effects, as John's body melts into his chair.
"See?  In a way, it makes you so damn oblivious to the most basics rules of human interaction it's a god damn handicap-"
Sherlock rolls his eyes.  "John," he says slowly, as if speaking to someone especially stupid.  "Would you, if you please, lie down in a comfortable position so that I can suck your cock properly?"
John knows one of the participants has been getting on Sherlock's nerves since the beginning.  She's a tall, red-headed woman with a loud, nasal voice, the type of person who has the impression she has to share her personal story for the benefit of humanity.  Lisa something, or Lila something, had been interrupting the teacher almost constantly during the presentation, and now that discussion is allowed, she has her grain of salt to add to everyone else’s comments, mostly to put herself in a positive light.  As soon as the blond  is finished, once again, she's ready to fire back.
"How can you imagine I would prefer you stay here out of... selfishness, so that I do not have to take care of you?"
Sherlock looks up at John, eyes wide and lost.  John isn't ready to share, to comfort, to be what Sherlock needs.  He cannot simply ignore what has just happened. He has an excuse, right?  After all, he isn't good with those things.  Neither is Sherlock, anyway.
"As for you, my dear John, I am sure one of the surgeries around here would be more than happy to hire someone with your competences.  If you would prefer a hospital, there are a couple in Brighton, which isn't that far from here."
"When I said I was hoping the shock would kill him, I wasn't being literal,” he whispers while John plugs the kettle.  "No, not Earl Grey.  Mycroft only swears by English Breakfast.  Double the infusion time."
It takes John a long second before he realises Sherlock has spoken, determined as he is to concentrate on the supper and forget his stupid behaviour.
They get Sherlock back on the sofa in a seat carry and lay him on his back.  He is panting quickly, through his teeth, and it is apparent the urge to push is overwhelming and difficult to fight.
A quick look at the toilet confirms what Sherlock has just said. The mucus plug is, basically, a thick cluster of mucus serving as a supplementary layer of protection at the uterus’ entry.  It can fall days before labour actively starts, but this time, it clearly has been dragged by the amniotic liquid.  It appears healthy, filled with bright red cells.
John wants to question Sherlock's sincerity, but it's too hard to form words.  His hand drops on the sheet.  He yawns.
"I cannot tell what you are thinking, but it is about me, and I am not sure I like it," Sherlock says, stretching his legs over John's thighs on the couch.
"Don't call it that!  How can I get over my bloody guilt if you address it like it's alive, like it matters?  A cluster of cells.  An early stage embryo.  It is nothing and I have to get rid of it."
Sherlock sighs and puts his empty plate on the floor besides him, tilting his head back and closing his eyes.
He's thinking he got away with it and congratulating himself when all of sudden, Sherlock's body tenses and he moves away from John, fighting to sit up.
So, what John does is to slide his hands, slowly, from Sherlock's hips to his stomach, where he leaves them, below Sherlock's navel, his fingers entangled.  Sherlock tenses, but then relaxes.
Sherlock nods, lifting his head to look at John.  He seems unsure and hesitant.  John waits patiently for what he's almost sure is going to come next.
The Church is not only abandoned, but isolated one mile into a deep wooded area, and it is clear, by the less than smooth driving, that the road isn't maintained anymore.  The pale gibbous moon of a very dark night -it's barely two in the morning- shines over the Church's tower, painting an almost supernatural landscape.
Sherlock frowns at him. "The second most commonly used definition of the word "hybrid" is, and I quote, a thing made by combining two different elements, a mixture."
"Well, thank god.  He needs to rest," John replies, guessing Amy had been a bit apprehensive about the subject and wanting to let her know she's off the hook.
Sherlock doesn't wait, he's already moving against John's hips, his pelvis tilting forward, then backward in a desperate attempt to take control.  John doesn't have to be told twice.  He grabs Sherlock's hips with both hands and moves, pushing and pulling and again, faster, stronger... and, in just a few seconds...
Sherlock stretches his long legs while devouring a Bakewell tart -he's always had a weak spot for them.  The spread sheet is open on his thighs and he's looking around the room.
"Oh, yes, of course," Mrs Hudson steps back and let them in.  "Besides, I need to get started on my knitting now.  A girl, what a nice surprise," she babbles happily.  "Now I can’t wait to shove Mrs Turner’s face in it."
It goes downhill from there.  The two next contractions provide no progress.  The head doesn’t move, despite Sherlock pushing with everything he has, and John knows what is happening.  God.  After the fourth push without progress, he cannot keep encouraging Sherlock and act like everything is under control.
it.  Wants to take care of Sherlock through it all, wants to hold in his arms a wailing little boy, and wonder if he will take after his brilliant father, or his more down to earth daddy.  He wants to wrap his arms around Sherlock's swollen stomach, cradle it softly, and let the world know he's the one who did that.  He's the one to whom Sherlock give himself wholly, with a trust so deep there is no going back.
John bursts out laughing at that.  "No, you stupid git, the couch!  How do you like it?  Is it comfortable?  What do you think of the colour? And the table I added as I surprise, do you like the table?"
John tries not to feel hurt -at least not to show it.  He fails, because Sherlock casts him a very soft look, his cheeks turning red once more.  “Yes, I know.  Let me explain to you John, that I never imagined my feelings could be reciprocated.  I am fabulously ignorant when it comes to intimate relationships, which I am sure comes as no surprise for you.  I never... I never had friends, only acquaintances, and it was crucial for me not to let my infatuation destroy what I came to understand was the most important thing in my life.”
May sixteenth is a windy day, struck by a rain shower around noon.  The temperature drops afterwards. John is glad; they have their second prenatal class after supper, and Sherlock suffers so much from the heat he would have ended up with a tired and grumpy pregnant fiancé, ankles swollen to twice their size.
A little side note : I have not yet seen the first episode of Sherlock season 4 and I don't know when I'll be able to watch it, which of course I'd prefer to be spoiler-free.  Also, and the last sentence of this note is a spoiler in itself, although it has appeared in all the pictures, clips and promo for season four.  So, it's a warning, what I am about to say contain a spoiler, if some of you want to skip it.
John bursts out laughing, high on adrenaline and love.  He's looking forward to the cab drive back home, when Sherlock will explain in detail the logic behind his deductions, eyes bright, a little short of breath.  John loves those moments.  He had figured out he was in love during a cab drive, noticing at the same time how much his praised affected Sherlock.
“SHERLOCK.”  John doesn’t raise his voice; he just adds more authority to it.  This time, Sherlock freezes mid-sentence and turns to look at him, mouth slightly open.  His lips are trembling.
"Stop scolding me, we're not in primary school," Sherlock murmurs raggedly.  "It is. A. Bloody. plastic.  Doll."
“Ok,” he murmurs afterward, “ok, it is almost over... god, that one felt... different, and not in a good way.”
John knows he sounds like a petulant kid, and hell, maybe he is.  All he had wanted to do was to assist Amy.  He had to, just to make sure she didn't miss anything.  After all, no one knows Sherlock better than him and...
"Yes, that's extraordinary," John says, his voice heavy with sarcasm.  "What's wrong, why you don't want to tell me?"
Sherlock complies, deciding to sulk instead.  The worst thing in this situation is that John isn't certain the class will be as great as he tries to... well, yes, sell it. The program is composed of two-hours classes addressing an array of subjects. Future parents can choose to pick only the classes they are interested in, or to follow the full course. The classes are discussion-oriented, leaving space for the participants to express themselves and share their experience. Tonight's subject is about the management of pain during childbirth.  John's hope is that Sherlock will feel comforted, hearing the other participants speak of their fears, their doubts and uncertainties, all on different level, of course, but at its core, what Sherlock is going through emotionally is quite universal.
"On the contrary, has it occurred to you that it might be crucial?  We have a woman dead for months, but no one in the missing person registry corresponds to her, and that is extremely unlikely, given that the victim is the mother of a now orphan baby.  In all probability we should be able to identify her, but so far, nothing has come up.  There is a very real possibility that the reason her disappearance wasn't made official is because her family, the people who would have reported it, have been killed too.  A signature on a crime scene, even as stupid as someone calling himself The Sussex Vampire, is very suggestive of a serial killer, or an aspiring one.  Who says he is not out there right now, ready to kill again?  So, yes, a few minutes can make a difference."
But then John gets caught up by his own reaction, surprised by its intensity.  This isn't, by a long shot, the first sonogram he’s seen, but it doesn't change the fact that the six millimetre shrimp with a giant head he sees is a human being in the making: his and Sherlock's own personal miracle.  A son.  A daughter.  Already equipped with everything it needs to develop into a perfectly formed baby in a few months, then a child, and an adult.  A
"John, I'm-" Sherlock chokes, his hips snapping forward.  He downright shouts, then, loud and unabashed, the cry ending on a long, trembling moan.  His sperm fills John's mouth, and he barely manages to swallow it all.  It is a huge amount, almost twice as usual, coating his mouth in five powerful spurts.
John rubs at his eyes and wonders if this observation session means Sherlock might not be so completely at peace with the changes his body is going through.  Now that there are only two months left, all those changes will accelerate.  His bump is consistent with a watermelon cut in half and it will at least grow to almost twice its current size as the baby gets ready to be born and concentrates on storing up some fat.
“Yes, I know,” Sherlock whispers, licking his dry lips.  “I... we can maybe try, but I feel another contraction already, so maybe after?”
"I see it all the time on people's faces, their anger or hate toward me, and God only knows I do not care.  I enjoy triggering this reaction."
There is, like always before he comes, a divine second where Sherlock's body arches and he sobs a series of agonizing moans. John uses it to push his shaft as much as he can, just in time to have Sherlock's muscles clamp up.  He's coming, then, trapping John's cock in a series of strong contractions that wring his orgasm out of him, punching the breath out of his lungs.  John's body reacts so strongly it hurts, all of his muscles tightening, and his nerves on fire.  He has to concentrate to get his breathing back to normal and he is still a little dizzy when he opens his eyes, feeling endorphins starting their miraculous work.
John nods.  Sort of.  His eyes close.  It feels good, to finally be able to welcome the oblivion of sleep.
In the afternoon, John decides to join him, bringing with him his porch rocking chair and a book he's owned for six months that he has never got around to starting. Sherlock, as he does every time he's deeply concentrating on something, is completely oblivious to his presence.  John soon abandons his book to just observe him, which is an activity one might think he would have given up after they got together, but has only become even more agreeable.  Before, of course, there was the admiration and fascination, but it was tinted with the certainty that Sherlock would always remain at a distance, unattainable. Now, watching him, just as fascinated as before, John can think of sweaty nights and morning kisses, of sharing a shower, and of those peculiar sometimes blue, sometimes green eyes looking back at him as if he's worth all the love and adoration he sees in them.  Sherlock is his.  Now, John doesn't have to watch out not to get caught staring.  He is allowed.
Sherlock sighs, rolling his eyes.  "What can I do about it?  I mean, you have very clearly described the reasons I am struggling with my fears right now.  Surely you know of a way to alleviate my negative emotions."
is the key word here.  John knows Sherlock can be dangerously strong, even though he's not at the top of his game.  Still, in the meantime, it is so damn hard to resist holding him all the time, shielding him away from the world.
Sherlock's nervous blinking is out full force, and his legs are shaking, visibly.  John grabs a chair nearby and forces him to sit.  Sherlock does, still blinking, his body rigid and his expression unreadable.
Sherlock stands up, giving John a quick look of reassurance that he is all right, he won't collapse on the floor.  He grabs Mycroft's shoulder awkwardly, forcing the older man to look up, his eyes widening comically.
After successfully working the generator, Mycroft has opted to give them space.  He’s in the kitchen, almost constantly on the phone.  He tries to keep his voice down, and John is glad.  Sherlock doesn’t need to hear conversations that could upset him or give him false hope.
He wishes Lestrade would have spoken to him before contacting Sherlock, and at the same time, he knows it wouldn't have changed anything.  What would he have said?
And now, it will be even more difficult not to think about the minuscule embryo lodged deeply inside the love of his life.  It is nothing but a cluster of cells.
It's hilarious, how they are both way out of their depth when they have touched and tasted each other in the most intimate way.  Context is everything.
John obeys, and is sensitive enough not to mention it when, less than an hour later, Sherlock eats a whole plate of cinnamon swirls with his tea.  Oh, the upcoming weeks will be all kind of interesting, John thinks.  Sherlock is very careful about his physical appearance.   He states that it is all a question of perception: wearing tailored clothes influences people, who have a tendency to take him more seriously; having his hair done and always being clean shaven speaks of someone who is professional in every sphere of his life. So, yes, Sherlock has the perfect, flawless answer to explain an apparent vanity.  Everything for the sake of the Work.
“Yes,” Sherlock answers honestly.  He’s speaking through his teeth.  “But it is bearable.  Just, get on with it please.”
, he thinks, and the enormity of his epiphany makes it hard to breath.  Sherlock.  He's it for me.  I can never go back to before.  I won't.  How can there be someone else after him?  Jesus, how can there even be an after him?
John snorts and hands a cup of decaffeinated tea to Sherlock.  “It’s not something I could forget, even if I tried.”
- but it's a feat in itself to have Sherlock announcing his impending orgasm by saying something else than... well... his orgasm being impending.
“Oh my god,” Mycroft whispers, his awed expression making him look ten years younger. He covers his mouth with both hands, looking shocked and shaken like John has never see before.
John's throat gets tight, suddenly.  It's like the rebound of Sherlock's crying fit hitting him only now.  He embraces it, because it also means facing the future, and the future is scary and complicated and unknown, but as long as...
Despite what he states, Sherlock's cock is getting pink and plumped, arousal has already changed his breathing.
To his surprise, Sherlock does not seem to hear the discreet, electronic "click" of the mobile.  John takes another chance, and another step.  He now has the perfect view of Sherlock playing, his eyes closed, his features relaxed, except for a little frown of concentration.  As he is trying to hold his violin correctly, he has no choice but to tilt his back slightly backward, exposing his lovely belly, all round and firm and
John doesn't  ask how he can be hungry one hour after eating four Bakewell tarts.  It's cute.  Besides, as Sherlock orders a large portion, he's daring him silently, with a challenging look, to actually say something... like how surprising is his sudden love for chips, and that pregnancy craving are a real thing, nothing to be ashamed of.  John doesn't bite.  He feels excessively protective of Sherlock, after their difficult conversation.  He cannot let go, although he won't mention it to him.  There must be a way to free Sherlock of his pupil status without putting him through an ordeal.  It's hard to believe Mycroft really is unable to work one of his tricks.
"Strange," he says, and his eyes laugh, and he has never been more beautiful and vulnerable and happy, not that John can remember.  "That you mention it, because it is my second reason, too.”
Sherlock superbly ignores him.  "...As I was saying, I was a picky eater and she knew she would get me to eat with saltimboccas."
...And yes.  John had admitted to himself that it was stupid letting his alpha male side be offended.  The best way to keep Sherlock safe was to flee.
"I am behaving just like you want me to," Sherlock hisses, his mouth quirking into an ugly grimace, his eyes full of angry tears.
Sherlock nods, and for the first time since John has known him, does not try to play the "John-is-a-doctor-he-can-watch-over-me-at-home" card.  He must be very scared still to accept a hospital stay, even for one night.
"Aren't you relieved we have told your parents?"  He directs his mind -and the conversation- elsewhere.
Sherlock nods.  It appears this time, they will be successful.  At least he seems to wants to move to the bedroom.  They take a couple of steps when suddenly, Sherlock’s knee buckles.  He appears equally surprised, if his panicked expression is any indication. Luckily, Mycroft and John are holding him up.
“Sherlock has fallen asleep in the sitting room.  It would be good if we kept quiet.  He needs it,” John explains.
"What are you still doing here?  Don't you have to stop the impending apocalypse or something?" Sherlock snaps.
John begins to walk slowly, hands shoved in his pocket.  Sherlock catches up with him, looking pretty pleased with himself to have gotten  away with his digression so easily.  He takes a crunching bite out of a ginger nut biscuit.
Better to try to change the subject.  Sherlock might be able to find out the answer to Mycroft's secret even if John doesn't have a clue.
"Sometimes I do project myself into the future, taking into account all the variables possible." Sherlock says, missing the fact that the question is one of those that does not need answers. Lovely.
It is John's turn to freeze in place, mouth gaping open.  He always  offers tea, although Mycroft has never once agreed to a cup while visiting them.  As if he always wants to be ready to leave at any moment when Sherlock starts annoying him.
“I am not disappointed in you,” John states as loud as he can, although it sounds weak, barely a murmur.
John runs his fingers into Sherlock’s wild curls.  He wishes he could stay right there with him, and not worry about the rest.  Sadly, he can see Sherlock straightening his back and rising on his knees, and right on cue, Mycroft is back.  With regret, John kisses Sherlock once more and goes back to his spot at the other end of the chaise-longue.
He wears jeans.  He had them when they had arrived, new jeans -a paternity cut-, and when he put them on, he had silently challenged John to say something, evidently embarrassed by his new look.  Which is ridiculous.  He is sexy, even out of his skin and his element, his grace trying to adapt to a more casual style.  Later, he had explained to John that he didn't really have a choice: the trousers he's ordered from his tailor aren't ready, and not really fitting for the country, anyway. John hopes he will keep wearing the jeans once in a while in London.
The first three days of Sherlock's bed rest go smoothly.  He sleeps a lot, because he is still fighting his cold, and when he doesn't, he spends his time texting back and forth with Lestrade about the case of the Sussex Vampire, as John has come to call it in his head.  Sherlock does not involve John, and John doesn't ask to be involved.  If the case is worth it, it will happen, eventually. Anyway, John doesn't have difficulties busying himself, despite having decided to take the next two weeks off the surgery.  Sherlock's protest had been more for show than anything else.  John might come off as overprotective, but he really doesn't want Sherlock to be left alone for long periods of time, not when he's stuck in bed doing nothing and thinking.  Mrs.  Hudson had offered to keep him company but John had declined.  Sherlock's pregnancy is something, he feels, that belongs to the both of them.  John's lizard brain urges him to protect his nest; it is as simple as this.
"No, don't worry," Sherlock replies quickly, and John realises he has switched on full-panic mode instantly.  "It is nothing of the sort."
"... playing those games with me, boy.  You might impress your clients and the cops, but I am your mother."
"Even you, the great Sherlock Holmes, cannot make a baby  by yourself.  Now, listen to me, okay? I am taking half the burden you're carrying.  Right now.  There. You should feel lighter already.  Even more so, I refuse to blame myself so don't inflict it upon you.  It's an accident.  Those things happen.  Contraceptives are efficient but they are not infallible.  You certainly won't be the first person to become pregnant that way."
And this, this is scary, to admit to himself the power he has over someone with such a formidable mind.  Sherlock doesn't trust his emotional self;  the insecurity is engraved deep in him, with roots that go way farther than his time with John.  And now, he cannot go back to whom he was before, because that man never truly existed.  Sherlock's refusal to acknowledge his feelings has never been, after all, an absence of said feelings.  He always felt, so much and so deeply.  John knows.  It's the only explanation, this duality, for  the man he is today.
"I agree.  He was right in the middle of a panic attack when the medication started working, and he couldn't stop talking, out of stress and nervousness.  That is why he told me how he felt, how scared he was.   He never would have discussed his feelings with me if he had been in a normal state."
Sherlock, having caught his phone, doesn't look at it, even though the way he flips it in his hand indicate he's dying to do so.  He's staring at John, not angry or even  irritated.  A little surprised, maybe?
"I want to feel like myself for at least a couple of minutes, that would be nice," Sherlock adds, and his pace slows down.  A little.
John thinks, feeling his own tears finally letting loose as he keeps the pressure, unable to comfort or encourage Sherlock, his throat too tight with fear and sorrow, at everything that could go wrong, at the ordeal Sherlock has endured for hours.
There is a shift in Sherlock's breathing pattern.  It takes some time, but he finally manages to nod.
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively.  "Something Mycroft says, sometimes.  Because of our intellectual superiority.  He likes to tell me he lives in a world of goldfish.”
But of course, Sherlock had been very upset to be forced to leave Baker Street.  He had told John how it makes him feel even more vulnerable.  There is now a passivity to him that gets to John and twists his guts –something so utterly fragile and human it hurts a bit, just to think about it.
Sherlock straightens his back and closes his notebook.  The only clue so far that he isn't as calm as he pretends to be, is the way he blinks, slowly, intentionally, three times in a row.
All John wants is to curl around Sherlock and succumb to sleep himself, but there is work to do, and besides, he’s not cruel enough to wake Sherlock up and drag him to their bedroom - the chances he would find sleep again are too slim.  With a groan, John stretches, then goes to work.
John smiles at the elaborate answer.  He licks his lips, tasting Sherlock on them, which has his neglected cock twitching desperately.  He thinks about asking, maybe just his hand, just to feel him close.  Nevertheless, watching Sherlock relaxed, his body settled, immobile as if he's a rag doll, he decides to keep silent.  Sherlock needs his sleep, first and foremost.
She nods to herself, then sends John off. John takes the corridor to the examination room and sees Mycroft leaving.
"Sexual intercourse," Sherlock exclaims as if it is somehow evident.  "I already told you what it does to my... numerous chains of thought."
"She is getting ready," John says, his hands remaining splayed on Sherlock's belly.  "Another few weeks and we'll have her with us.  Can you imagine?"
"What I mean to say is that you should be happy now, the news is out.  Oh.  I didn't mean to sound resentful.  My apologies, I am quite tired.  I shouldn't point out Lestrade's lack of open-mindedness while we are both indebted to him, as there is no doubt his knowledge of the tourniquet method and unshakable calm during tonight's events are the reason you are here with me and not... not..."
Sherlock pulls his penis to the side; John examines his swollen sac, finding it has worsened since the last time he checked.  The skin also seems tighter.
In that specific case, though, I really would have been giving away the solution to that part of the plot, and I couldn't.  Again, it was never my intention to hurt or offend anyone.
"I will never hate you," John whispers.  "I think I made it quite clear that I'm so freaking mad about you I would do anything, absolutely anything and everything, to make you happy.  And it isn't the first time we're having this conversation, so I guess I need to repeat it again and again until you have it carved on a wall in your ridiculous mind palace."
“I... can’t...” Sherlock rasps, trembling all over, still pushing, while John frees a tiny shoulder, then the other.
Sherlock makes an annoyed sound.  He stops for a second and blinks slowly -three times, they always come in threes, those nervous blinks.
A very tiny nod.  Sherlock closes his eyes for long seconds, and when he opens them again, the way they shine tell of his efforts not to start crying.  It's enough for John to feel his throat swell, and he swallows a few times to get over the sensation.  Sherlock is a force of nature, as if he's too great for his own body to contain, but he can be so bloody vulnerable, laid bare as he is right now.  It is like there is no in-between, like he cannot find an accommodating state between the repressing armour and the overflowing bareness of his soul.  It must be so tiring to be him.
"About what?  Sherlock, if you just want to enjoy some free time, there is nothing wrong with it. You're right.  You're not obliged to them.  Plus, I kind of like-"
And each and every time, I made sure to show my disdain and explain to them in no delicate terms that feelings don’t solve crime, let them be in the guts or elsewhere.”
"Especially for myself, John.  I can turn it off, of course, if I find myself in a delicate position.  Obviously, most of the time it doesn't work like that -the deduction will have been made before I realise I shouldn't have.  You think I really want to know you have masturbated in the shower when I see you eating breakfast afterwards?"  Count on Sherlock to find the most humiliating example, and then complaining like a bloody martyr.  "I've been perfecting my science for so long now that I'm not even conscious I am doing it.  The gears in my head, they can't be stopped that easily."
“Listen, Sherlock,” John says, wanting to get his attention before nervousness has him yelling at Mycroft.   “We’ll be at the hospital in less than half an hour.  They will check you as soon as we arrive.  In the meantime, you’re with me.  I’m a bloody doctor, remember? I’m going to take care of you, and you’re going to be great.  I’m calling Amy.”
He then hands over his phone.  John looks at the list. He has to scroll down.  Twice.  Everything is there, from pacifiers to baby formula, a stroller, a portable bed, "stimulating toys", a bottle steriliser, and so many other things -enough for John to realise, right on the spot, how little he knows about babies, really, which, he should have thought about sooner.  There are only three months left before his daughter's birth and gosh, he isn't ready.  He has never felt less ready in his life, including the first time he was deployed.
Nevertheless, the simple fact that Sherlock - who at first had the stupid idea that John could do the follow-up and deliver the baby himself (
He sighs, thinking he should go start the supper, when Sherlock stirs.  Eyes still closed, he gasps, then grimaces.  His belly changes shape suddenly, and an impressive bump appears on the left, close to his navel.  Sage’s moving has become very uncomfortable.  During their last appointment, Amy had found it funny that their daughter didn’t follow the usual pattern of reducing her movement progressively, as she became too big to have any space left to move, like most foetus.Not Sage.  She is determined to be active as much as possible, hence Sherlock and John new nickname for her.  She is indeed their little acrobat.
He shouldn't worry.  Sherlock is angry.  Plus, he tends to lose all sense of time when he's at the morgue's laboratory.
Another series of blinks.  Although Sherlock seems to be present, John isn't fooled.  His brain has shifted into high gear.  He's losing himself in too many chains of thoughts and letting the real world fade away.
The small plant stem Sherlock shows John isn't familiar, nor does it have anything special, just small leaves, with the underside showing some kind of purple tint.  There had been flowers, although all that remains after the winter are small brown cold-burned bundles.
John had picked five of the practicing androcologists in the London area after a quick swipe of their competences, history and reputation.  He had built files, with references to articles, or the name of the colleagues he had talked too, citing them as "sources."  Then, he had given them to Sherlock and had told him to pick one -Sherlock had actually seemed impressed by John's work.  Three hours later, he came back with Amy Brown's file.  "I did have my own system of classification, so I have to let you know she came second best, so if you want to argue about my choice, I will of course consider your objections."
"Hum, yes, just like coffee.  He asked me about it, and had me buy him decaffeinated tea, but then he found a way to withdraw the caffeine himself from his favourite brands."
Beeks sights.  His lips are reduced to a thin white line, his eyes still staring at his daughter's room door.
Part of John's brain analyses the situation, detached and logical.  It's textbook. There was a time where tourniquet was taught as a first aid technique to stop blood flow, but there were too many complications because of inexperience, sometimes resulting in the loss of a member and tissue necrosis, when the blood flow was cut off for too long.  That is when it was decided it was better to teach how to apply pressure on a bleeding wound until the arrival of competent medical workers.  Lestrade should know how to do it safely, though, the Yard's police force is highly trained, and even if John was to lose a leg, still better than dying right?
writer, finds this part especially difficult.  Luckily, he’s only the narrator of Sherlock Holmes’ exploits, and he can spare himself the intellectual pain of context and exposure.  Of course, he tries, in a paragraph or two, to add texture at the beginning of each new case, ,but it’s still pretty thin.
"I think you lied to Sherlock when you told him there is nothing you can do to free him of your guardianship."
John blocks Sherlock's rant, and smiles into his pillow.  He still has three days to make him change his mind - not about the plaster, god, no - and figures it is a challenge he could very well win.
John puts his cup down and looks at Sherlock until the younger man feels his gaze on him and lifts his head.
“How can she not?” Mycroft says, smiling, and then quickly straightens himself, casting John a quick look, as if he’s been caught saying something indecent.  When John does not react more than a knowing smile, it seems to encourage him to continue. “Sherlock will hold himself to impossible standards, and I fear he will constantly beat himself up over it.”
