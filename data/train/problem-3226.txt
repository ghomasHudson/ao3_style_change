"But I used to be… more. I had skills, abilities that I've lost over the years since meeting Dean. He blames himself for my 'fall from glory,' so to speak. Would I still have them if I'd never met Dean? Yes. But it's not his fault. I
“I'm afraid sometimes Dean just pretends to be happy with me, the same way he did with her, that he just fakes how he feels and what he wants. I love Dean, and we’re both trying to be better and more honest with each other, but he has always acted from a place of duty, of obligation, not true desire.” Cas stopped to take a deep breath.
Then Dean felt Cas stiffen, back straightening unnaturally, shoulders tensing. The air buzzed, crackling with electric tension.
"Oh, this is just the sweetest thing," she crooned, leaning over the remaining covers, a little too close for comfort. Dean tightened his arms around Cas and gave her a death glare. Behind her, Sam walked through the door with an apologetic look on his face.
also odd note but ik there’s a lot of ppl who disagree w the fanon that cas is somehow inherently different than the other angels, like he was “built wrong”, etc. honestly i don’t have a strong opinion either way BUT i do think cas at this point holds the opinion that there is something wrong w him so yeah. that’s why that’s in there
Man, Castiel really was one of the sweetest people Erin had ever met. He also had to be one of the most unfortunate people she’d ever met. She motioned across the table to let Castiel know he was welcome to come sit with her, and he pulled out a chair, placing the baby carrier next to him on the ground. Erin bent down and leaned towards Jack, lightly tracing her finger over his chubby palm. “He’s so cute. He lives with you?”
Anxiety and panic burned hot in Dean’s body, making his skin prickle sharply, violently. “It’s,” He took a deep breath. “It’s okay, Jack,” he said through gritted teeth. “It’s not your fault. I’m just really worried.” His words were accentuated by a loud, hiccuping sniffle from Cas, his chirps and repeated ‘Dee’s sending rumbling vibrations through his chest. Dean could feel something wet starting to soak through his shirt; he couldn't tell if it was tears, snot or sweat. Probably some combination of all three. This realization did nothing to soothe the fear searing through his soul, and he looked at Jack desperately. “Can you go explain this to Sam so he can text Rowena about it? And tell him to make it quick.”
“I-I know things are weird and different for you right now, but you’re still my dad, and if Dean hadn’t been so desperate to do it alone, I would’ve taken you out of the Empty myself. I would’ve done it because you don’t belong there, you belong with us, with me. With your family.”
"No, no, Cas. Hold on." He grabbed a stool, pulled it over towards the table, and sat down in front of Cas so they were both at eye level.
"M'kay, bath time, kiddo." Cas sniffed and flapped his wings lightly, wincing at the movement. "Hey, don't do that. You're gonna make it worse," Dean said, softly smoothing down the feathers before standing and walking towards the bathroom. Cas simply huffed, turning his face away.
“You read my mind, baby. Lead the way.” Jasmine quickly grabbed his hand and they exited the building, Dean keeping an eye on the supposed stalker. After a minute of crossing the parking lot, she stopped in front of a little red car and unlocked it before turning to look back.
Cas responded by pointing at the light switch and shaking his head. "No," he repeated again, voice wavering a little.
Castiel still had his eyes closed, swaying slightly on the spot as though a sneeze could blow him over. It didn’t look like he expected Erin to respond, so she turned around and made his coffee. How else was she supposed to react, really?
Cas nods. “Yes. I was all that was left for this concept of eternal rest, this sense of cosmic finality to imbue itself in. Death, the Empty, whatever you want to call it. The name is inconsequential. It’s all just one now, as it should’ve been from the beginning. I am simply,” he waves his hand, “the end.”
"No. No, Cas." He felt Dean's hands cupping his face, thumb rubbing slow circles on his cheekbone. A sob was working its way up his throat. "Look at me."
“Dean really does act like a second father to Jack; he’s helped me feed him, change his diapers, give him baths, rock him to sleep. He was a lifesaver in the beginning, as I didn’t know the first thing about caring for a baby beyond what I’d read in parenting books. And Jack loves him as well. I’m extremely lucky they get along the way they do.” Castiel weaved his fingers together and rested his hands on the table top. He was staring at Jack, a guilty expression briefly flitting across his face.
Castiel looked a little sheepish and shrugged defensively, still holding Jack in his lap. He readjusted the baby, turning him around until he was facing Erin. “Yes. It’s not ideal, of course, but it works for the time being.” Castiel glanced around the room and suddenly dropped his head closer to Erin’s, as though he was about to share a secret. He spoke in a hushed tone.
alive, safe, by being here for us. You're the only reason this house hasn't collapsed on us yet, the only reason I'm not eating peanut butter jelly sandwiches and instant ramen every night. We need you here—not just because of what you do, but because we love you and
"Fine, fine," she grumbled. She turned around to Jasmine. "You gotta take Jack then, okay? I'll give you the carrier, you can hold him in the passenger seat."
Then Dean was in Hell. He was flying to the Pit, hacking at demons the whole way down. His white wings were being scorched by hellfire, blackened by the creatures trying to yank his feathers, desperately grabbing at him for salvation. Dean (Cas) spotted a light in the darkness, a faint glow that sang to him, calling him, irresistible in its pull. He descended further until he was face to face with the real Dean, brandishing a bloody knife, bits of flesh caught on the serrated edge.
His brother hasn’t used the damn ‘sock on the door’ for years, and Sam is pretty sure he has never ever used it in the bunker.
“I miss you too,” Cas answers right away, the softness in his voice sending goosebumps into Dean’s skin. “All the time.”
He does the breathing exercise that Jimmy tried so hard to teach him but fails miserably. He can already feel how his eyes start to water. How his heart seems ready to burst, and he decides that fuck it, maybe the best-case scenario is to let it all out after all.
And for the last time, I’m really sorry, Dean. I thought I was doing it to protect you both. I thought I was doing it for you, but it turned out I was doing it for me, and I can see it as clear as day now.
“You can open that, if you want. They’re-” he interrupts himself to brush another kiss on Cas’ cheek before moving away again, to the spot he’s been occupying for two hours already. “...letters that I wrote to you while I was- well. While we weren’t together.”
A year ago when the ultimatum between staying behind a desk and pushing paper for the rest of his career at DEVGRU or leaving with severance pay was offered to him, there was no talk about Dean ever being able to return to combat, even less so about him returning as a member of a SEAL Team platoon. But now here he is, a year later, having almost fully completed his recovery despite the numerous “
“Why do you let him use this shit?” he finally asks in hushed tones, his gaze fixated on his brother. “Why do you let him take it at all?”
He stops there for a minute, trying to gather up his thoughts. Dean seems to extend the same courtesy as Cas previously did, and chooses not to interrupt him. He looks at him instead, his hands still reassuringly holding onto his.
for beta'ing this story like a champ even after I dropped this 10k chapter on her lap less than 20 hours before uploading. Buddy pal, they would NOT be any story without you. Other special thanks include the smut brigade that are my best friends Camille and Sarah 💜
It’s been boiling within him all day. He woke up to Dean packing his duffel bag and saying he needed some time to process. Cas nodded as he made his way to the door and slumped against the kitchen counter when he heard the front door click shut.
And for the second time that night as he watches his brother shutting down in front of him, shame creeping through his bones, and something in James Novak snaps. He pushes himself off the door he’s been propped against and reaches for his duffel bag. Castiel looks at him curiously, one eyebrow raised as he watches his brother gather the few belongings scattered around the room.
“What?” Dean asks in disbelief, not sure he’s heard that correctly since he’s basically been tuning out for the most part of the past hour.
Dean stiffens at that, and Cas knows he’s hurt him. But he can’t stop, not when everything hurts so much. Not when their fragile balance is about to shatter.
Dean’s heart makes a leap inside his chest. That’s when he sees it; the hurt dancing alongside the fury in Bobby’s eyes.
It doesn’t change how Jimmy feels about it all. It doesn’t change the guilt that squirms at the bottom of his gut. It doesn’t change the pain of knowing he’s the reason the two people he loves the most are apart. It doesn’t change the look on his face when he looks at himself in the mirror.
Thanks for all the kudos, subscriptions and comments received here and on Tumblr praising this story. It truly means the world to be able to discuss this with you all, and I look forward to hearing about you in the comment section after this one :)
And for a moment, right there cradled into Cas’ arms, Dean allows himself to breath in the hope in front of him. Allows the mountains of doubts and uncertainty to vanish, holding those three little words close to his heart.
“Yeah it’s, uh,” Dean stammers, already hating himself for his inability to put on a mask with Benny even when he’s thousands of miles away. “It’s C- his name is Cas. Castiel.”
Whatever. Airports still suck. Coffee still tastes like shit. And Dean’s heart still sinks inside his chest as they reach security.
Ever since he became human- which was the only way to drag him out of the Empty- Cas has been dealing with a flow of emotions he wasn’t used to, and in such, he’s been a lot more susceptible to outbursts of every kind. That means he laughs harder and gets angrier than he used to. It also means he cries more, and even if Dean knows that’s just inherent to Castiel’s newfound humanity, it breaks his heart every single time. There’s something about the sight of Cas crying that undoes him in a way that nothing else can, a dull aches that rise from his guts and can send him into panic if he doesn’t manage to control it.
It had been sitting there ever since; unmoved and untouched; the crisp white of the envelope Benny had put it in a reminder that it was still here waiting to be opened every time Dean walked up into the room.
He’s spent several days thinking about it. Cas has been working his ass off all week, and Dean decided that a romantic dinner was exactly what they both needed. He even bought candles and wine to go with the homemade risotto he was planning on making tonight. The whole stupid romantic shebang.
Jimmy sighs. “I do, but how am I supposed to do that? Dean is never going to want to listen to me, and Cas is more likely to slam the door in my face than anyone else.”
If he does, he’s afraid he might start cracking all over again, and they can’t afford that. Not now, with Cas sitting next to him with bruises and cuts all over him.
Cas had been waiting patiently for Dean to feel comfortable enough to ask for this. He knew it’d be coming, relying on their past sex life a decade back. Sex had been easy for them, but Dean hadn’t been able to let go just yet, still too in need of control. Cas didn’t mind. As long as Dean wanted him, no matter the way, this was good enough for him.
All this time spent thinking Jimmy had erased Dean from his memory, had thrown away their pictures, effectively erasing him from their collective history- only to find out that they had been talking all this time. And that Jimmy kept them close- all three of them- to his heart, tucked away in a little box underneath his bed.
“I understand what it means,” Cas cuts him off. “But does it really work? I know you, I know you have a conscience. I know you’re probably still thinking of these… people at night.”
He’s standing in the middle of a hospital. There are kids crying and monitors beeping, a nurse that’s looking at him like she’s seconds away from calling a doctor to check up on the idiot in front of her. That’s when Dean Winchester, the broken boy from Westdale Road, the soldier that marched through battlefields with his heart on his sleeve, the man that loved so deeply that he agreed to let go of the only person that made him feel like he was worth something; realizes that this is it.
“What happened?” he asks, shoving him into the corridor and up to the room they’ve been sharing for years. “Tell me what happened.”
I can’t say that I don’t miss being stateside, but there’s something different about being deployed. Mostly, it’s dusty and too hot, but sometimes it almost feels pure. I can’t say that running around with a target on your back is especially pleasant, but we’re fighting the good fight here. Together, as a team.
He scoffs, trying hard to keep his composure as he stares at his hands, fidgeting with the hospital sheet before he reaches for Cas’.
It’s not that bad, but it’s not particularly good either. Cas sports several huge bruises, a notably gigantic one located on his ribs on his left side. Dean grazes it lightly with the pads of his fingers and Cas hisses, visibly in pain. His bottom lip is split, so is his left brow ridge. Dean can’t help but thumb at Cas’ cheekbone, the other man gasping softly as Dean follows the line to his neck and touches the scratches there.
“I’m okay,” Cas interrupts, eyes snapping open again- icy blues meeting his in the soft light of the living room around them. “But I think-”
It’s a dance they’ve been doing for months. Dean will then ask for Cas to promise he won’t go. Cas will promise, every single time.
The sound of the quiet rings finally rips him out of his mist and he realizes he’s dialed up Charlie’s number in the panic right when she answers.
And he knows, deep down, that he’s reacting unfairly, that nothing Cas has done could ever push him to think he’s going to leave him behind- hell quite the contrary actually.
He’d asked his doctor earlier during his physical therapy session, worried about what had happened during the night, knowing that untreated PTSD on top of all of his other issues would be the death blow. It had already festered for months, because Dean was unable to let go of his stupid sense of pride. The goddamn ‘
For so long now, I have been so scared of endings that I would run before they had the chance to find me. I would embrace only the temporary; to stop the idea of forever from breaking my heart. But life doesn’t work like that;
” before heading to the shower. Benny comes back while Cas is still in the shower, Chinese food in hands they eat together on the coffee table while the Great British Bake Off keeps them busy. Dean watches in awe as Benny and Cas bicker over which candidate is the best, enjoying Cas’ weight against him as he presses closer and closer against his side.
But Balthazar doesn’t know. No one except Jimmy and a handful of people he doesn’t see anymore knows. It’s something that Cas has tried so hard to bury deep inside his soul. Because talking about it did more harm than good.
He pauses in the doorframe, unable to stop the soft smile to appear on his lips as he finds Dean lying down on Cas’ side of the bed, clutching the pillow he knows is his tighter against him.
“You’re not a serial killer, are you?” Balthazar asks, one eyebrow raised in a comical gesture that gets Dean to laugh for the first time in 24 hours.
“I removed the bandages because I wanted to take a shower but it looks fine to stay that way, I think.”
“Cas?” he groans, voice still thick with sleep, trying really hard to make it make sense. “Whatcha doing here, buddy?”
“I don’t have time for this,” Dean grumbles, checking the time on his phone. “We’re leaving in 5 right?”
“I don’t know. Fucking this up. I just-” Dean stops there, looking lost for a second before he picks it up again. “I need you to know that just because we’re here and we’re- I don’t know, doing something about it. Moving on or whatever. I’m- it still scares the shit out of me.”
“Oh man. I’m sorry, are you okay?” Dean asks with concern, grabbing his shoulder. That drags Cas back into the present. “Cas?”
Cas releases him then, fingers returning to petting his hair softly as Dean suckles at the tip, catching his breath back. He’s not even touching himself, his cock still trapped inside his boxers where he slightly ruts against the sheet, searching for friction.
Welcome back to another update, and thank you for the kudos/comments/subscriptions. It always means the world to me to see people enjoy my work!
“We tracked down the son of a bitch that killed him. It took us weeks. And when we finally found him, I put a bullet through him.”
“I don’t really know. Until it stops hurting I guess. If it ever stops,” Dean huffs, his eyes falling to his feet. “I mean, there’s a reason I was offered a desk job or a discharge after all.”
It’s the same hand that leads him to open his eyes again, the pain still radiating through him as it slips tenderly through his hair, down the line of his neck, fingers ghosting over his collarbone to finally rest on his heart, warm and heavy. Dean can’t help the smile that appears on his lips as he turns his head slowly to finally stare at the man lying beside him.
Then it becomes a tradition. Once a week, usually on Friday, Dean gets out of work early, picks Castiel up from his new job at the library (looking as dashing as ever in his new clothes that they picked together; clothes that fit him, that typically tend to get Dean’s heartbeat to accelerate. And he usually has to remember that
Castiel nuzzles against his jaw then, tearing himself away from the sky to hide his face in the crook of his neck, and Dean just holds onto him tighter, pressing him closer.
what to think. I come home in the middle of the night to him being high as fuck and you literally petting his hair instead of taking his needle away from him,” Jimmy says, gaze fixed on Dean’s. Trying to ignore the litany of “
Of course, Dean's grand plan to announce his reciprocated love got blown outta the water as soon as he and Cas came back. Didn't exactly feel right to confess his feelings to a two, maybe three year old who may not even be of sound mind. He hadn't known if little Cas remembered anything before the Empty; Dean still couldn't tell if he remembered any specific events but it sure seemed as though he felt the same as before. Dean wondered if Cas would blow out the lights again the first time he gets told
"He…" Cas swallowed. "He stopped. He stopped crying." Suddenly Erin was left holding empty air as Cas practically flew down the hall. She followed him tentatively, lingering a few steps behind where he'd stopped in one of the rooms. It'd been painted sky blue, light streaming in from a window close to a crib.
"Shhh." An unfamiliar voice came from above Dean, startling away whatever grogginess remained. He whipped his neck around to see Cas, glaring at Sam and Jack before looking back down at him, face full of concern and affection. He slowly realized that his head was in Cas’s lap, resting on top of the folded up trenchcoat. One of Cas’s hands was carefully carding through his hair, the other cradling his cheek with a light touch.
it. Before Dean could ruin whatever illusion they had going on, Cas burrowed further into his chest, making himself very small. It was going to be so much worse, going back to how they were before, knowing
the reason Cas died. Dean took sole responsibility for that death sentence. But he had shit he needed to say to Cas, and as much as he loved Sam and Jack, there are just some things they’re not meant to hear. Dean snorted.
when he mentioned you, he told me you bought local honey therefore he knew you'd like the honey tea, he acted all eager like he cared about what you'd think of it… I'm telling you, if you'd been there you'd believe me.”
Cas. Angel or not. I’m not gonna leave you just because you’re freaked out.” His voice begins to shake, just a little bit. “And I’m not gonna let you leave because you’re being stupid. I don’t know what I gotta say to make you stay but I need you to not leave me. I can’t handle that shit anymore.”
"You'll make me wish I'd never been born, you'll put a bullet in my brain before I even get the chance to blink, so on and so forth, etcetera, etcetera. I get the point." Rowena tsked. "You Winchester boys really are so predictable."
me,” Erin whispered, relieved she hadn’t accidentally suffocated him or let him scream himself to death. “Not that I’m ungrateful for the quiet, but give a girl a little warning next time, please?”
comes back, not even Knights of Hell, not even archangels. So for that broken, useless, pathetic excuse of an angel to get a redo? Absolutely fucking unheard of."
had bounced around in Dean's thoughts like his head was a pinball machine. In the weeks that followed, he spent dozens of nights on his laptop, rewatching the bunker’s footage of the moment.
"Hey, uh, Jack," he started, "Cas's grace isn't gonna run out, right? Like when he heals me, will that drain him of his powers?"
All remaining thoughts of nightmares and darkness and the void disappeared as Cas smiled brightly and agreed.
has beef with the Winchesters, directly or indirectly. Figured I should see for myself what all the fuss is about." Jasmine crossed her arms in front of her chest, cocking her hip out slightly.
ok next chapter will be a bit more plotty i promise!!! like always feedback is v much appreciated :) sorry again abt the late update <3
“Hi, baby,” he whispered, smoothing down the feathery blonde tufts of Jack’s hair before kissing his forehead. “How’d you get all the way over here, hmm? Did my sweet, perfect baby boy use his little nephil wings for the first time? Did he?” Jack just giggled and buried his face in Cas’s chest. Cas held him there as he looked back up to Erin, as though just now remembering that she was there too. They stared at each other, both unsure of what to say.
A couple weeks later, Erin woke up at the asscrack of dawn full of regret and a hatred of capitalism. Against her better judgement, she had agreed to take the earliest shift as a favor to one of her coworkers. Whoever decided Starbucks needed to open at five in the motherfucking morning was a sick, sick bastard. No one fucking lives in Lebanon anyways; they don’t even start getting customers until well after 8am, if not later.
from his perspective 'cause he wanted to show me what my soul looked like." He tilted his head towards the floor, away from their faces.
Instantly Jack's head perked up. "Me! Can I go? I just need a minute, I'm almost done with my picture."
"Yeah, will do," Dean grunted as Sam walked out the door, shutting it behind him. He turned back towards Cas, still hiding in his nest. Guilt and frustration were mounting in his body and he put his head in his hands, heels pressing against his eyes til he saw stars.
“Orion, huh?” Dean echoes, trying to follow Cas’s finger. He thinks he sees it, the three little stars, all lined up in a row.
Dean pauses, breathes in and out. He’s scared—he’s always scared, he’s never stopped being scared, not since he was four years old—but he knows in his heart that Cas will say yes. He knows it.
hands are the ones that made the thing is good enough for me. Besides," Dean added, grinning, "I think it's kinda cute you like using my crap."
, conforming to the shape of what appeared to be a squirming lump in its center. Eyes widening, Dean could only watch as a tuft of black hair emerged from the heap, rising above the collar. In a second, he found himself staring into a pair of very familiar baby blues, their foreheads and noses almost touching.
"Now us angels and demons might not know much about where we go if we end up biting it, but one thing we can all agree on is that once you're dead, that's it.
An impulse shot through Erin like a strike of lighting. She lunged towards Castiel, grabbing his arm before he could walk away. “Hey, I’m serious about everything I said earlier. I’m sure the opinion of your local barista means jack shit to you and I definitely care about this way more than I should but you need to know you deserve good things too. You deserve to hear it. You deserve to get what you want, to be happy.” She inhaled deeply. “I actually like you, Castiel. Yeah, I think you might be kind of insane, but you also have a really big heart. I'm lucky to have met you. Jack is lucky to have you, and Dean would be too.”
"When you told me I couldn't stay, I blamed myself. At first I was hurt, confused, and then I realized how much of a burden I would've been. I was useless, worthless, of course you wouldn't want me around without my powers. I was nothing but dead weight. I couldn't fault you." Cas could feel Dean's jaw wobbling against his head. He reached up blindly to touch Dean's cheek, fingers tracing over wet lines.
Dean’s not breathing. The world is spinning and they’re outside but he still can’t get enough air and Jesus
"Hello, sweetie. This is for you, special custom-made." Cas, however, did not seem interested, and turned away, hiding his face in Dean's shoulder.
"It's—it's fine, Erin. Thank you for making me dinner." Cas picked up his spoon but still kept looking into the soup, searching the noodle letters like they held the answers to all his problems. "Dean makes good soup, you know," he said slowly. "We had spicy tomato basil the night before he left. It was a new recipe."
hiiii i'll probably delete this chapter in like a week lol but i just wanted to let all yall who have been following this and wanted more know i posted the first chapter of a
"Hey, Cas, you good with some Alex Trebek?" When she didn't get a response, she turned to see Cas sitting cross-legged on the bed, facing a mirror in the corner of the room. He appeared to be staring at his reflection, studying himself as though he was observing a specimen behind the glass. Detached, almost clinical. He looked down at his hands, palms up, flexing his fingers as though he was unfamiliar with using them.
"Wanna f-feel it,” Cas mumbled, shivering hard. Willpower apparently gone, he grabbed the front of Dean’s shirt and kept him close as he buried his face in his chest. Worry wormed its way back into Dean’s bloodstream, and he dropped to his knees, putting himself on the same level as Cas.
Dean finally noticed the pressure on his arm and looked down to find Cas close to tears, clutching the shirt to his chest. He kept his big blue eyes fixed on Dean, sad and distressed.
The second time Erin saw Dean, she was minutes away from closing. She had spent the past half hour cleaning in the empty cafe, wiping tables and sweeping. She was about to take out the trash when she heard voices outside; one pleading, growing increasingly distressed, the other exhausted and slightly annoyed.
“Dean.” He tightens his arms around Dean’s waist as Dean’s throat closes again. Jesus Christ, how many times is he gonna cry today? “I already told you. I’m not leaving. Even—even if I think it would be better for you, I’m not leaving, okay? I promise. And I’m sorry for hurting you. That was never my intention.” Cas pauses, raises a thumb to Dean’s face and swipes it under his left eye, catching a stray tear.
Bingo. It was shit like this that puzzled Erin to no end. Cas had vehemently denied that Dean was anything but straight (“Look, all I'm saying is no heterosexual man obsesses over Dr. Sexy like that.” “Erin.
Immediately after the words left his mouth, an ear-splitting shriek rang through the room, causing everyone to flinch and cover their ears. Blinding light enveloped where Cas had been standing just a second ago, and Dean's blood ran cold in fear and panic. Gradually, the light died down, shrinking to reveal a little boy laying flat on his back, still and quiet.
If Dean were thinking rationally, he would've realized immediately that there was no way Erin was being serious; she was clearly too young for Cas by a good decade or two, not to mention that Cas looked absolutely mortified by her insinuations. Unfortunately for Dean (and fortunately for Erin), he was not thinking rationally. His face turned a lovely shade of red, and he whipped around towards Cas, who still hadn't moved a muscle.
Sam laughed. "Okay, looks like it's someone's nap time." Dean just stared at Cas, now settled against his legs, wings wrapped around himself like a feathery blanket. Despite how many times it’d happened recently, Dean would always find it unnerving to see the angel sleep.
Another squeeze of his fingers forced Cas to look back up at Dean. Still radiant, still beautiful as ever. Dean exhaled a laugh.
Jasmine just shook her head, trembling against the wall. "I-I tortured someone, I cut into them and beat them and someone came to save them, the—the man with the blue eyes—" She gasped and looked at Erin, expression pleading and terrified. "Is he okay? Did I k-kill him?"
He grimaced as soon as the thought popped into his mind; the real question was since when do angels return from the Empty in fucking age-regressed vessels, seemingly both physically and mentally? God. He needed a fucking drink.
"No, not as of yet. I haven't checked my phone since last night though, so maybe there's something new? I doubt it though," he said sadly, dipping the spoon into the baby food and positioning it in front of Jack, who gurgled and stuck out his tongue in a clear sign of rejection.
"I don't know how to convince you I genuinely had no idea it would pain Castiel that badly, but I didn't, I promise," Rowena said with ostensible sincerity. When Dean's face remained stony and cold, she sighed.
“Cas, you gotta wake up," Dean said, louder this time. He tentatively reached over and grabbed Cas’s shoulder, shaking him gently. “C’mon, you’re just having a bad dream.”
A faint burning sensation crept into Dean's cheeks as he looked down, still kinda embarrassed. "Yeah, sorry for being weird when you guys came home. It's really not that big of a deal," he mumbled. "Dunno why I was such a mess earlier."
It's meant to be light, teasing, but it hits Dean like a shot to the heart, because Cas is wrong. He's so wrong.
this. But those baby blues went from the color of the ocean on a sunny July day to harsh, unforgiving waves of a storm, dark as night and twice as scary.
"No." Cas pressed his forehead further against Erin. "No, I haven't. And I don't know what to do about it." They stood there for a minute, just leaning on each other. Erin struggled to come up with something to say, but Cas ended up beating her to the punch.
Erin snorted. “Yeah, I know our conversations aren't exactly normal. That's what I like about you, though.”
"Mm, I think I'm adorable." He braced himself for the hit he assumed was coming, but Jasmine lowered her hand with a smirk.
Dean grunted. "Yeah, fair enough." They reached the map room a few seconds later, greeted by Sam and Rowena's backs. Dean almost snorted at their absurd silhouettes; it was like seeing a mouse next to an elephant, a pixie next to a giant.
As Dean first brushed over his feathers, Cas bristled but quickly melted into the touch. Holding out the pinky on his other hand for Cas to grab like he had that morning, Dean gently nudged his palm. Cas wrapped a fist around his finger right away. "We good now, kiddo?"
"For real, Cas, it's no big deal. You know I love taking care of Jack anyways." Erin grinned at Cas again. "And we all know I'm his favorite. Really, you should've texted me sooner. I am somewhat of a baby whisperer." Of course, Jack took that as an opportune moment to let out an ear-piercing scream. Erin wouldn't have been surprised if her hearing was permanently damaged.
insult me by devaluing yourself. You deserve all the love I bestow on you and more." Cas reached for Dean's shaking hands, holding them reverently in both of his.
And how is it that one word could make Dean want to burst into tears again so badly? He dropped his chin to his chest, jaw beginning to tremble again. God, this was embarrassing. Even if he wanted to speak, he didn't trust himself to open his mouth without letting a sob escape. His eyes screwed shut without him even thinking about it, his mind trying to pretend that Dean was the only one in the room. Maybe if he stayed still for long enough, everyone else would eventually leave him alone.
“I don’t understand how this could’ve happened.” Jack paced back and forth, immensely distressed. "Nothing about the portal should've changed him."
You’re fucking kidding yourself if you really thought your domestic wet dream could ever work. Maybe you didn’t get the memo but I’m not fucking gay, and I sure as hell ain’t father material. For fuck’s sake, Cas, Jack’s not even your fucking kid.”
Something soft brushed against Dean's cheek as Cas simply continued to press against his heart. He realized that they were feathers, and that Cas was essentially petting his face with his wingtip. The kid angel closed his eyes and hummed before proceeding to drape his wings over Dean's shoulders. They radiated warmth, vibrating with electric energy, and when Cas reopened his eyes they glowed blue with grace. He gently removed his hand from Dean's chest, then violently smacked it against Dean's forehead. He flattened his palm, dead center, fingers spread.
She sighed, reluctant to give up the warm bundle resting against her chest. Jack's presence was grounding, steadying, and Erin didn't want to have to return to the endless drifting between brewing and cleaning and taking orders.
"Yeah, I think so." Jasmine pushed herself up, using the wall and Erin's arm for support. She wobbled for the first few moments on her feet, her grip on Erin tightening almost painfully, but she managed to start taking steps without falling over.
“What the h—” A sharp popping noise interrupted Erin, and she screamed as one of the lights shattered only inches to the left of where she stood, stray flecks of broken lightbulb brushing her shoulders.
Dean was about to leave the library when Cas stopped him.  “I hear something behind this shelf.”  Cas pointed to the one he was talking about.
“Call Crowley.  See if there is a tie between the mayor and the victims.  Cas, you’re with me.  We’ve got some ingredients to buy.”
“That...that’s great.  Why am I just learning about it now?”  Sam walked over to them and shook his head.  “You know what, it doesn’t matter.  I’m glad you’re home, Cas.”
Vamps looked over in surprise as the hunters spilled through the door.  Surprise quickly turned to rage and the vampires bared their teeth.
The man turned around.  “What-”  A gunshot cut him off and he dropped to his knees with a scream, covering his crotch.  Blood seeped out between his fingers.
Dean savored each kiss.  He memorized how it felt.  Cas’ skin under his hands, his lips, everything.  He hadn’t felt this good in two years and he’d be damned if he was going to miss a second of it.
Dean tore the pictures out of Sam’s hands.  “That was rude,” he said.  He smirked at Sam’s exasperated sigh.  “Alright, Cas, ready?” he said, tucking the pictures into his jacket.
Cas took a few steps closer.  He pursed his lips and didn’t look Dean in the eyes.  “You are pretty enough to kiss,” he whispered.
Dean grinned and hugged Cas.  “You’re really back.  I can’t believe it.”  Dean took a deep breath.  “Oh, Cas.”
Dean nodded.  “You might be onto something.”  He opened his computer again and typed on it for a while.  “Oh, hey, remember the new mayor?  Apparently, the first thing she did after being elected was buy all three of those trees and make an orchard of them in her backyard.”
The brothers put on their suits while Cas went in search of news papers regarding the victims.  When he returned, Sam and Dean were out by the car preparing the arsenal.  He walked up to them and handed Dean the papers he’d collected.  “Here, they have pictures,” he said.
“Come on Sammy.  It’ll be just like the good old days.”  Dean stopped, stunned for a moment.  “Did I really just say that?”
Cas didn’t get much reading done either.  The headache and occasional nausea were quite distracting.
Cas stepped into the light.  He stared at the body as he walked over to Dean.  He took his hand and sighed.  “Can we go home now?”
Sam checked the bathroom, tearing open the cupboards under the sink and unscrewing the faucet.  Flower buds were starting to grow as Sam opened the toilet tank and found the hex bag floating in the water.  He squeezed out as much water as he could before flicking open his lighter and setting the bundle ablaze.
Cas turned to the desk and started rummaging through the drawers.  He almost immediately disregarded the unlocked ones.  He managed to pry open the locked drawers with a knife.  As he set the knife back on the desk it dawned on him.
Cas glanced at Sam.  Sam wasn’t looking at them but Cas knew he was listening.  “I don’t know.  I just feel...scared.”
There’s so much that’s wrong right about now that Cas is not sure where he should begin. He takes a breath instead. Bathes in Dean’s scent for just a second longer.
Dean stirs up in bed and immediately tenses up at the utter silence bathing the entire condo into an eerie doom and gloom. Call it a sixth sense or some sort of lucky coincidence, but a little voice in the back of his mind is telling him there’s something wrong with the calm surrounding him, and his heartbeat instantly picks up.
Dean has fetched his medical kit from his room and it’s solidly waiting for them on the coffee table as Cas sits on the couch, his eyes hazy. Dean makes his way to him and starts examining his hands while he sits on the table.
“Doesn’t surprise me,” Dean smiles, carefully following the edge of the river, making a point of walking a slow pace not to fuck his leg up.
Cas knows that he’s hurt him at the core of his pride, and he knows this is Dean’s knee-jerk reaction to being contradicted. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, especially with the look Dean throws at him before he turns his back on him and makes his way to the kitchen. He starts taking things out of the fridge, presumably to start with dinner, but he all but throws the things on the kitchen island, making a point of making loud noises.
“You have no idea what I’ve done before,” Dean interrupts, his voice so cold that it sends shivers down Cas’ spine. “And you don’t think I’m capable of fixing cars anymore?”
“The Navy, probably. Dad was a Marine, I feel like he’d be proud of me if I managed to join the Navy. Who knows, maybe I can go the Navy SEAL route.”
“Really? We’ve got the house to ourselves and this is what you choose to do with our free time?” Dean chuckles as he drops on their bed.
Dean feels like he’s been simultaneously rolled over by a garbage truck and mixed through a fucking blender. Next to him, Cas doesn’t register the crestfallen look on Dean’s face and keeps going.
He doesn’t flinch when he feels a warm body pressing against his back. He recognizes the cologne and the soft press of hands as they graze his hips before wrapping around his waist and squeezing him lightly. Dean kisses his cheek softly before pressing his chest flush against his back, the side of his head against his neck.
He thinks of Cas last night, tightly wrapped around him and begging him to stay with all the love he could gather.
Dean turns on his side to watch Cas carefully. The faint light coming from the street illuminates the room just enough so that he can distinguish his friend in the darkness. Cas’ eyes are locked on the ceiling.
It takes Cas a couple of minutes to calm down, and as Jimmy reaches out to remove the needle carefully, Cas looks up to him, tears running down his face.
“Okay, well I’m not listening to that, that’s for su—“ Dean extends his hand to turn the radio off but Cas flicks him away in one simple gesture.
“Right, yeah,” Cas says, and Jimmy realizes too late that in just 5 words he’s managed to hurt his brother in the core of his heart.
He forces himself to open his eyes then, to look into Cas’. He hates the way hurt instantly colors his face, how deeply sad and watery his eyes immediately grow.
For now though, I can’t bear the thought of losing this. So I’ll write again, now and there. About how you were the light when I knew nothing but darkness. About how you made me feel safe when my entire life was blowing away around me. Even when loving me meant giving more than you could afford to lose, you kept trying to piece me back together with parts of yourself.
Dean smiles widely at the deep moan that leaves Cas’ mouth as he gently circles his hole, slicking it thoroughly before pushing one finger in slowly. Cas’ hands curl around his shoulders, holding on to him for dear life, Dean revels in watching the journey on Cas’ face as he slowly opens him up. After a little while Cas takes one more finger in, and gradually starts riding his hand as more curses start leaving his mouth.
He finally winds up in the ER. It’s packed, understandably so since it’s pushing 10 AM. There are families and kids and people waiting; nurses in their blue gowns going from boxes to boxes. Like a hive of bees swarming around.
It’s weird, seeing it like this. When Cas and Jimmy moved in all those years ago, the place was already furnished. And although over the years and after both brothers had gotten rid of the original furniture to replace with their own- Jimmy had a thing for long, impromptu trips to IKEA-, Dean had never seen the space so bare.
It takes him more time than he would’ve liked to tear them away, and once he does, it feels like he might pass out. Balthazar seems to notice, his arm suddenly curling around his shoulder, forcing Cas to look at him.
A white envelope. And Dean doesn’t know why his heart accelerates at the sight. He ponders for a second before grabbing it and opening it.
secrets safe no matter what, but it runs both ways. It was Jimmy’s story to tell, and I’m really sorry that he never did, but I don’t know more than what I told you. And I’m sorry I enabled the lie, but I wanted Jimmy to have a chance at redemption here.”
He shakes his head, trying to clear his mind. Takes a deep breath, and looks up at the sky to try and find the strength to keep going. If this is the night for him to finally say his piece, he’s not about to let it go.
They’re silent for a while, Cas not moving from Dean’s embrace, his head still resting in the V shape of his neck where it’s warm and welcoming. Dean doesn’t move. His breath is even, and Cas knows him enough to know that he’s slowly coming back to the realm of the living.
But of all the people I’ve been, all the words I’ve held beneath my tongue and claimed as my own, I remember those with you most fondly. You made me feel like the man I found with you was who I was supposed to be, like I could finally stop looking.
He barely hears the answer as he finally catches a glimpse of blond hair in the same direction the nurse at the desk indicates. A messy bun, blue nurse’s gown, he’d recognize her anywhere —
Dean smiles at him, this time with more warmth and Cas can see something being set back alive inside his eyes.
It’s Dean’s concerned voice, Cas realizes as Dean crouches down to lock eyes with him. His hand slips from his shoulder to grip his forearm as he turns to look at Charlie, who seems mortified.
“Okay,” Dean chuckles when Cas drops his head against his shoulder, brushing a kiss against his hairline. “Let’s get you to bed. We can finish up tomorrow morning before the movers come in.”
That single image, a younger Dean on his knees sucking the living shit out of him is enough to send a bolt of electricity through Cas’ muscles, phantom desire of a long lost time coursing through his veins.
It takes everything in Charlie not to clap her hands. Instead, she raises up on her feet, declares that she’s getting some pie for Dean (he doesn’t have the heart to tell her he’s unable to eat anything), and leaves both brothers to their bickering.
This simple sentence acts like a punch to Dean’s gut and he has to retrieve the urge to curse Balthazar.
“Goddammit Dean, stop interrupting me for a second would you?” Benny complains, but the steel in his voice that’s part of him being an exceptional team leader on top of an outstanding Master Chief makes Dean stop.
Jimmy doesn’t ask anything out of Dean. He doesn’t tell him Cas relapsed. He listens to him babble about Virginia and how cool Green Team is as they have their monthly phone call a couple of weeks after instead. He listens to Dean excitedly telling him that he’s gearing up to his first deployment as a Navy SEAL, ignoring the way his stomach curls and the urge he has to scream.
What he cannot deal with, though, is having to go back to the grocery store for the 5th (FIFTH!) time in less than 24 hours, all because Dean suddenly decided that they absolutely
“But you’re not a kid anymore, and Cas is fine!” Charlie argues, her voice going a little higher- a sign that she’s likely on the verge of tears. “ He’s
“Yeah, well,” Cas raises an eyebrow at him, a sudden look of defiance painted on his face that makes Dean’s heart rate suddenly raise, “if you don’t start making sure the cardboard and plastic packaging don’t get mixed up with the rest, we’re definitely not having sex anymore.”
Dean doesn’t even stop to acknowledge the broken tableware and Cas freezes, all but too used to these types of situations from more than a decade ago. If Dean notices, he doesn’t seem to care as he continues, his eyes glimmering with fury.
I’ve officially been gone 9 years as of today, and it still hurts like it was just yesterday. I’ve heard time and time again that pain is supposed to ease with time, that your brain is wired so that it subsides just a little, day by day. It’s a lie. The woe is more dull ache than flared nerves, sure. But it’s still there, woven into every single thing I do. Hell, I’m sitting outside the barack in J-Bad, right in the middle of a warzone, and it still hurts more thinking about you than anything else.
“You’re gonna have to let him go, buddy. And it’s going to be tough, I’m not gonna lie to you,” Dean slowly says, crafting each and every word carefully in an attempt to soothe him. “It’s gonna hurt like a son of a bitch, and you’re gonna want to punch people in the face. You’re gonna want to tear your own heart out sometimes.”
Alright, enough talking (lol one day I'll be able to write beginning notes that don't look like an entire prologue, I swear to God). I'll see you in the comment section. 💜
Dean knows he doesn’t stand a chance lying to Benny. He most likely will know right away that Dean is not telling him the truth, and then will proceed to roast him for the rest of the day. Dean’s been there and done that a countless amount of time already. So instead he just comes clean on the spot, heart crumpling on itself inside his chest.
Truth be told, it shouldn’t phase him. It’s not the first time it happens and it certainly isn’t going to be the last. But somehow anxiety starts rising inside his guts the minute he decides he’s not gonna go through it tonight.
And even though it’s the same word, the same name said again and again, every time Dean pants his name into his ear it has a whole new world of meaning that takes Castiel’s breath away and throws him into another dimension.
Dean gently slides his hand from Cas’ hair down the side of Cas’ face, grazing the line of his cheekbone tenderly. At that Cas closes his eyes again and pushes into Dean’s palm, chasing the contact.
What’s uncommon is Dean deciding to take their order at the bar instead of waiting for a waitress to come to their table, before crossing back to the booth they’re occupying next to the jukebox with two beer bottles in one hand and two colorful cocktails in the other.
“I don’t care. ‘Cause guess what? You don’t get to have an opinion here,” Dean answers, voice heavy with contempt as he slowly walks toward the kitchen counter and leans on it. “You don’t get a vote. It’s
Castiel enters the Gold Bridge Treatment Center in Louisburg, Kansas, about a week after his overdose. He completes his 30-Days program without any troubles, and is back home like nothing happened after that. He enrolls in community college a few months later, meets a friend that got his back whatever happens, and is doing pretty great all things considered.
“Fuck-” Cas whines against him as Dean mouths underneath his jaw, relishing the little moans that come out of Cas’ mouth.
“What if I’m not enough?” Dean lets out, and it feels like such a huge thing to finally get off his chest that the breath he takes after that feels huge.
“I shouldn’t have talked to you like that. I know you’re just worried, I know you just want to protect me. I didn’t-,” he sucks in a breath. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I never want to hurt you.”
The letter had landed at Sam’s a few weeks after Dean had moved in with Charlie. He didn’t make a big deal out of it. He carefully picked it up from Sam’s and tossed it on the desk of the guest room he was occupying, and blatantly decided to ignore absolutely everything about it.
“I don’t think the issue here is about you reacting this way. I’m pretty sure Dean understands where it’s coming from. And I haven’t met him yet, but I know he’s a clever guy. I know he’s been willing to put in the work to make this relationship work.”
“Yeah Jack, sure,” Sam says as he answers their son, laughing even more as he sees the look of pain on Dean’s face, “Oh, come on! Don’t knock it until you try it!”
“Who told you that you’re failing?” Bobby asks, his voice smooth, careful. A striking contrast to his usual grunt, abrupt tone.
“Come on Cas, live a little! We’ll be back in no time, and in the meantime we can enjoy some peace and quiet.”
He starts the coffeemaker and is about to sit on the counter until it’s done when he eyes a piece of paper on the kitchen island with something scribbled on it. He smiles as he reads Benny’s words letting them know that he’s gone for a run and will probably return around 10. Eyeing the clock on the wall of the kitchen tells Cas they’ve got roughly 2 hours before their friend comes back, which gives them plenty of time to do what they want. Cas hums as various ideas cross his mind.
Next week is, uh........ Well. I don't have words, but the few friends that have read chapter 13 have basically told me they "don't want to be friends anymore", sooooo. Make of that what you will. 😬
Cas was silent in the car. He was silent when Dean left for PT at 5, and he’s been quiet ever since Dean came back too.
“Now you’re overselling it, sweetheart,” Dean smiles as Cas turns his head on the pillow to look at him. “Sleep was overrated whenever I was on deployment or on OPs, but I did enjoy my sleep once I got back home. I just don’t have anything that heavy on my conscience that pushes me to get up early and go
“Come here,” Cas urges, not moving from the spot Dean has just laid him down on and opening his arms for him.
He stops, breathing in, and Dean keeps his gaze locked on him, unwavering. When Cas picks up, his voice seems clearer, lighter.
Cas' tone is harsh although his voice is measured and as toneless as possible. Dean bites a kiss underneath his jaw, trying to convey as much tenderness and love as he possibly can. Cas doesn’t push him away or tell him off, which tells Dean enough about how much he’s willing to accept his touches but not enough to actually react to any of them.
Jimmy sighs. He’s so exhausted. By work, sure. But also exhausted about the silence he’s been keeping, about the hurt that it has caused. He’s come so close to telling both Cas and Dean so many times. But every time something ended up happening — Cas’ relapse, Dean getting severely injured during his free time (Jimmy knows it most likely happened during an OP, but Dean wasn’t allowed to say), Cas graduating and getting wasted as fuck to the point where he had to drag him to bed and watch him all night. But he kept it shut, always looking for a better time, a better place.
“I swear to God if you say that’s not a stupid name I will make you sleep on Holli’s bed and he’ll be sleeping in here instead of you,” Cas interrupts him with a wide smile, raising his head to look at Dean.
“If he doesn’t, you have my permission to kick his ass. Hell, I’ll fly out to Kansas on short notice.”
If Dean had been worried about his lack of sex before, he certainly isn’t anymore. It feels like being reborn again, discovering Cas’ and his own body in ways he never had before, and even if he isn’t ready to switch positions quite yet, he’s starting to grow more comfortable and assured in bed that he probably ever was (to Cas’ great delight). Even his physical therapist chips in, telling him that “
Jimmy ponders for a minute as he sips his hot cocoa. Charlie’s looking at him but she doesn’t seem as mad as before.
Dean pants against Cas before licking along the sensitive skin of his throat and delighting in the shiver that courses through Cas’ body. He’s beautiful like that, completely disheveled and at Dean’s mercy.
There’s a flash of pain as Dean raises his head to look at him, but Cas has learned by now that Dean is a master at concealing his emotions from appearing on his face and he once again makes great use of that skill.
Turns out he now has a plan for today, and suddenly it’s like his body is living out of his own volition. He’s off to take a shower without even realizing until he’s halfway to the bathroom. He gets dressed in next to no time before snatching Baby’s keys from the motel’s table.
No air-conditioning? No thank you. Garden? Not a turn-off, but not a necessity either. An apartment above a bar? Probably not a good idea right now.
Modesto, California. They arrived a couple of days ago, tracking a pack of werewolves. Last night was the culmination of their case, they managed to trick the pack they’d been after into their hideout and wipe them out. It’s then that it happened. One of them got the upper hand on Dean and managed to toss him all the way across the room after mistaking his back for a scratching post. That’s where he laid down for a while, the hustle and bustle of battle around him fainting as he slowly sank into unconsciousness, blood slowly dripping from his back and onto the cold floor.
Dean has never been a believer, but if he was, he’d say he probably pissed someone off big time upstairs at some point to end up being this
more than half a plate. You think I don’t notice the circles growing darker under your eyes, or how your shirts are starting to look too wide for you? You drink twelve coffees a day, and you pretend that it’s because you’re addicted to caffeine but it’s really because you don’t sleep the amount of time you pretend to. And if you think I don’t pay attention to the empty bottles that started pilling up the
“Yeah, we’ll be fine,” Dean nods against him before leaning back to take a look at Cas’, both hands framing his face. “We’ll be
Balthazar sighs loudly, sinking further into the couch. Cas watches, waiting for his friend to come up with something,
Sometimes Cas thinks that Balthazar is going to end up with cognitive disorder from rolling his eyes this hard. His friends then proceeds to smirk at him, which does
The sound of Cas’ heart, breaking and stitching back together in a single beat. Dean turns his head just enough so that Cas can see his profile, and suddenly his nose finds the hollow of Dean’s throat, the other man pushing into the warmth of him, needing the touch and reassurance. Cas closes his eyes, tightening his hold on his waist, the weight of Dean’s hand in his a reassuring presence.
Cas’ lips turn upwards into a slight smile before he adds, “It’s not like you to say no to pie. I don’t recall this happening… ever.”
He tells himself that it’s the room climate, that Fall is his worst enemy. That he hates rain and misses Summer.
“Where the hell have you been?” Dean says, finally letting go of Castiel that doesn’t seem to understand why Dean is acting like this. “We were worried.”
“I know you’re a journalist and you very likely don’t need this for work anyway, but,” Dean starts as Cas stares at the teal blue polaroid that Dean carefully handpicked a couple of days before Christmas. “When we were kids you were always going off about wanting one of those, and when you finally got one you couldn’t stop taking pictures of everything. I still have that one of you tucked away in my wallet somewhere. So I got you this one, in the hope that we can both make some new memories with it.”
“Cas…” Dean says, and Castiel closes his eyes for a while, enjoying the peace and quiet inside of him, the slow and heavy buzz within him. “Did you… What… Is that heroin?”
Holli had been with them for less than a month at that point, and he was already keeping his and Dean’s hands full, so the mere thought of adopting another animal hadn’t even crossed Cas’ mind. It all changed eventually when they passed a little black cat in one of the stalls, and her stellar green eyes attracted Cas’ attention immediately.
Patient Love "the book" will be available in a couple of days. Keep your eyes peeled for a link dropping on my social media and on the front page of this story. I won't be making any profit from the book, but if you do want to support me, my ko-fi link is at the bottom of the page. You will be buying it off the printer's website, so I also won't be handling any kind of transaction or shipping; that means unless you tell me, I won't know you've gotten the book! Feel free to show me if you get it :)
“Okay spill,” he presses on. Then rolls his eyes so hard that Cas thinks he might have brain damage afterward. “Come on, I know this is about him. What’s up?”
Cas smiles again, brushing a thumb along the line of Dean’s stubbled jaw, going down the crease of his neck, the line of his throat. Every touch is an echo of how much he missed this, missed him. How much he still feels.
“We should head back inside,” Dean whispers against him, “We really are going to catch a cold, and I’m not sure I want to see you get sick as a human for the first time, it’ll be horrendous.”
Dean watches, mesmerized, his hands squeezing Cas’ tightly. Hoping that this won’t shatter their already fragile balance.
God, I miss the way you used to look at the world, and the way I saw it when I was next to you. Before you, I would look at the night sky and call it darkness, but you saw nothing but stars; nothing but light.
It’s only an hour later that Dean texts him, asking him where the hell he is, that Sam finally grins at his phone while answering.
He can’t help the low growl that comes out of his throat, can’t help his hand from finding Cas’ head and thread through his messed-up hair, can’t help the shivers that rocket through him once Cas finally closes his mouth around the head of his cock.
“Woah, and I’m the dramatic piece of shit?” Dean says as he pretends to ignore the way his heart just accelerated.
As a follow-up to that, I'm actually considering going through printing this story in book form, once I'm done releasing it on AO3. As such, I created a
Which is why Cas dives in without a second thought, morning breath be damned. He’s dreamed of this far too many times in the past years to give a fuck.
And Cas thinks he’s quite lucky, in the end, when he sinks into sleep easily one last time in the darkness of their room.
Well, Dean had Castiel, and Castiel had Dean. And for once, things were actually looking up. Which, all things considered, made Dean a little uneasy, not used to the feeling
Cas can feel him melt against him, his weight gradually pushing into him as he let go of the tension running through his entire body. He presses his face against Dean’s nape, his nose breathing the soft scent of him, both of his arms wrapped around Dean’s waist, and braces himself for what’s to come.
“That’s not —,” he starts before he shakes his head and scoffs. “Yeah, it would be terrible. For him.”
Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen that look on Castiel’s face before. The sheer excitement mixed with wonder, something twinkling furiously in those baby blues.
“I don’t know if you remember, but he was pretty pissed when I left,” Dean answers, carefully sipping and humming appreciatively. “Plus, I don’t know if I can still do the job, not with that bad leg and the way my body still hurts.”
5 minutes and a lot of whining from Dean later, Cas is back on the road, holding the wheel to his very own truck with his very own (whiny) boyfriend in the passenger seat, and Lizzo’s singing about men being great until they gotta be great.
It’s sincere. Whatever happens, whatever shit comes their way, there’s one thing Cas knows for sure; Dean is the love of his life. Even when he’s acting like a dick, even when he hurts him. Which isn’t an excuse, but it’s a reality he’s aware of.
But she just nods while taking the money he’s handing her, an easy smile on her face. “That was a no-brainer. I miss him too. He’d swing by every couple of days, hit on a different girl every single time.”
“I love you,” Cas whispers against Dean lips, pressing a soft kiss there before he follows the line of his jaw down his throat and mouth at the skin there.
The banter with Benny also helps, and although Dean knows he’s obviously overdoing it for the sake of keeping his mind off things, he appreciates the sentiment.
And yet, I felt safe because you were next to me. Because there was nothing but skin between our bones. For the longest time, your skin was home to me.
Dean is silent for a moment while they all go back to eating in silence. Dean then excuses himself to go to the bathroom. Cas watches him go, not letting his eyes off him until he’s out of sight, and then goes back to looking at Charlie. Who’s eyeing him curiously.
Dean is still lying on his back in his own bed, his gaze glued to his ceiling, wondering what he did to deserve to be thrown into literal Hell when his phone starts buzzing. He sighs loudly wondering what else is about to be thrown down on him, and answers without even looking at the ID call.
“Jimmy told me, “don’t you remember? Back when we were little, when mom was still here and we were living in Chicago, she brought translucent stars home one night and we spent the night sticking them to the ceiling in our bedroom. She said that way the stars would always watch over us”.”
But it’s right here now, orange bottles full of benzos staring at him right in the face.  He knows, he
Dean nodded and pulled out the other two photos.  “What about these ones?  Did you see them this past month?”
Eventually, they all got bored of the arcade and Cas directed them to the bar he’d mentioned.  They got seats near the makeshift stage and listened to the band.  A poster on the wall told them it was called Radiance. The three of them chattered away about nothing and everything.  They discussed the good times and exchanged stories about solo hunts.  The waiters just kept the drinks coming.
Takhar reached out an arm and picked up Crowley.  “I don’t have the slightest clue why god made you disgusting
Cas couldn’t get Crowley’s words out of his head.  He turned them over in his head for a while, pondering.  Finally he decided to speak, “Dean, have you ever read Chuck’s books?”
As Sam looked around a smile grew.  “Guys, this was probably used during prohibition to hide a bar.  The clothing shop was just a front,” he said.  The higher pitch in his voice betrayed his excitement.
Dean could have gotten up and stormed out.  He thought about it but he looked at Sam.  The usual look of pity had vanished.  It was replaced with a look of hope.  Dean conceded.  “Fine.  I’ll talk to the doctor.  But, don’t expect anything.”
“I’m not really sure.  The details are a bit fuzzy so I can’t really explain it.  How have you and Dean been?”
“Yeah, can’t imagine that’s the most comfortable way to sleep.  Come on, we’ve got a ghost to hunt.”
Cas’ voice was tight as he spoke trying to control himself.  “Dean, it’s not like that...”  Tears began to blur his vision.
“Oh, I doubt they are unrelated.  Luckily, the self proclaimed King of the Crossroads is our bitch.”
After finding and cleaning out the vampire nest, the brothers packed up their things to go back to the bunker.
“It looks like there’s a vamp nest here in town.  There have been attacks tracing all the way back to the 1920s.  They’ve spiked in the last few months though,” Sam explained.
Sam sighed, looking over the newspapers, sorting out the useless parts.  “Nope, just a bunch of people dying weird deaths.”
“I see.”  Cas continued flipping through the book.  Some of the scenes scared him, some were surprisingly comedic.  He loved the drawings of himself the most.  They were remarkably detailed.  Finally he reached the last one and recognized his wings immediately.  He ran his fingers over the graphite.  “I’m sorry I did that to you,” he whispered.
at the house.  You never do that and even if we do have to split up, you’re never that far from me.  Something’s changed between us.”  Dean’s voice rose.  “Why don’t you just tell me if you want to break up?  When this whole thing started between us, we promised honesty, above all else.  So what happened?”
There was an edge to Dean’s voice as he continued.  “Let’s review the past few days.”  It was something between anger and sorrow.  “You stay out all night without a word, which is not at all like you.  You’ve flinched away anytime I get near you.  Cas you suggested we
“Um, nightmares.  I had kind of a lot of them after you died.  Surprisingly, it’s hard to think about it when you’re drawing them.”
Dean stirred and looked around.  He saw Cas, dripping wet, at the foot of the bed.  “Cas, what happened?  Is it Crowley?”
Dean met Sam and Cas at the bar.  Sam looked at him in surprise when he stepped out of the car.  “She must have not been too thrilled about that,” he said as Dean walked up.
“No.  That’s actually why I’m here.  I want to know who else is granting wishes.  I can’t be having any competition.”
Dean could feel the tears threatening to spill over but his walls were broken as it was so he continued on.  “I held him.  I told him I loved him, I told him we would fix it, and that it...  He knew he was dying and he promised he’d come back, that he’d fight God to get back to me.  I wasn’t paying attention to anything else, didn’t even realize Sam had arrived until Cas was gone.  He didn’t know about us.”
Crowley watched him leave.  “Shoulda known he’d react like that.”  He shrugged to himself and ordered another drink.
“I should call you Dad,” Dean said, “That’s basically what you are.  ‘Course, my other dad would probably object.”  Dean thought for a moment.  “He’s dead though, right?”
Something flickered in Dean’s stomach, butterflies stirred.  He leaned forward in his chair.  “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Bobby sighed.  “Ok, give me a couple minutes and I’ll see what I can do.”  Bobby rummaged through his bag and pulled out a book.  He opened it up and flipped through it.  “Damn my instincts are good,” he said.  He turned the book so Sam and Cas could read it.
Cas started to walk away but turned back.  He jabbed a finger at the demon.  “If...if he...” Cas stopped and took a breath.  “This is a mistake,” Cas muttered and he went to sit down with Sam.  He decided he’d wait until Dean came back.  That would give him a chance to calm his nerves.
Dean grinned and they climbed into bed.  Dean pulled Cas closed to his chest.  “You know, I held you so many times in my dreams,” he whispered, “but it never felt like this.  God, I missed you.”
“Justice is not for you to decide!”  Takhar rushed at them, wooden claws aimed to tear through them.
Dean was slightly disappointed when Cas relocated but his hands remained firmly attached to the trench coat.  “I know, Cas.  I love you too,” he said.  He tipped his head back, exposing more skin to Cas’ roaming mouth.  He sucked in a breath as Cas’ hands slipped under his shirt, exposing his skin to the cold air.  It was gone in an instant though, as Cas closed the space between them.
Cas ran over and touched Dean’s forehead.  He could feel something growing in Dean as his lips began to turn blue.  He tried to keep Dean breathing, keeping the plant tendrils creeping out of Dean’s mouth and nose at bay with his powers.  “Hurry, Sam!”
Dean shook his head.  “Listen, Doc, I already have to relive it everynight in my dreams.  I don’t much care to do it while I’m awake.”
“Dean, I don’t think this is necessary,” Cas protested as Dean dragged him into their medbay, as Dean had called it, “It’ll heal fine on its own.”
Dean was slightly taken aback.  He reached out but hesitated.  His hand hovered over Cas’ shoulder.  “Cas, what-”
The house had been thoroughly stripped from years of neglect and theft.  Some of the cupboards didn’t even have shelves.  Cas looked around the upper floor sitting room.  There were doors on either side and a fireplace opposite the stairwell.  Cas picked the door to the right.  It opened into a hallway with four attached rooms, three on the sides and one at the end.
“Yup.  Each of the victims had publicly stated that they were against the new mayor.  The ones that got wishes granted, all had said they were
They got in the car and waved to Bobby as they rumbled down the driveway.  Once they were on the main road, Dean turned to Sam.  “Where did you say this next hunt was?” he asked.
“Not great, honestly.  Dean didn’t cope well with you gone.  At first it was fine.  He waited for you to come back but at some point...something changed.  It was just downhill from there.  It was ugly.”
They stayed there for a while.  Dean chatted up a woman who had sat down next to him while Cas asked around about the missing people.
“Nah, I’m jus’ fine.”  Cas tried to walk towards the door and stumbled a second time.  “Perhaps you coul’ help me a bit though.”
Cas and Dean laid in bed.  Dean had an arm wrapped around Cas while the angel traced the scars on Dean’s chest.  “I definitely needed that.”
Cas felt something tug in his gut as Dean carefully wrapped it back up.  He looked at Dean who was carefully avoiding eye contact.  He’d gotten good at ignoring the feeling when Dean was too close or too far away.  Dean finished and his hands hesitated over the pins for a moment.  The feeling grew stronger before snapping like a twig.
Cas moved down, placing kisses along Dean’s jaw and down his neck.  “I love you, Dean,” he whispered against Dean’s stubble.
Cas ignored the question.  He saw Sam standing on the other side of the room, watching them.  He felt Dean’s hand on his shoulder and turned to face him.  He looked at the hand, then at Dean.
Cas shot Sam a terrified, angry look.  He would have said something had Dean not been so hysterical.
When they arrived, Dean sauntered in while Cas followed more slowly, taking note of the people around them.  Dean walked up to the bar and ordered a beer.
With a gasp, air reached his lungs again and his eyes snapped open.  He lay still for a moment, listening to the rattle of the motel room AC.  He realised his hand was behind his head.
There was a part of himself that Dean had always ignored.  He shoved it into the farthest reaches of his mind and did his best to keep it there.  John had always told him to, so that’s what he always did.  Despite his best efforts, this instinct escaped its bonds on occasion.  Much to his dismay, tonight was one such occasion.
Dr. Scriff looked at him gently.  “Dean, we’re all adults here.  You’re allowed to say things like that.”  When Dean didn’t reply, he asked another question.  “You said he died, yes?  Would you be comfortable telling me what happened?”
“I, uh, lost someone a few years ago.  He thinks I’m not dealing with it well and maybe I’m not but that’s my problem.”
“I can ask the guy in the office.  Small town like this, he probably knows.”  Dean went and talked to the man in the motel office.  He came back with a grin.  “Got directions.  Let’s go.”
Dean rolled his eyes.  “Whatever.  I’m gonna call him and see what he knows.  Keep an eye on Cas.”  Pulling out his phone, Dean stepped outside.
Cas sighed and settled down at the desk with his book.  He figured he would read until the brothers woke up.  It was unlikely he’d get much sleep anyway.
“Whatever you say, man.”  Sam stood and took the keys.  “Come on, Crowley.  You said you were bored.”
The shot went off and the man sprawled forward on the ground.  “You can come out now,” Dean murmured, “He can’t hurt you anymore.”
Cas looked at the pages with a sort of strange reverence.  He saw collages of his face, hands, clothes, etc. covering some of the pages.  Others had scenes he didn’t remember, words he’d never said.  “What are these?”
“But I did!  We had agreed to meet up.  I knew it was dangerous but I thought I would get there before him.  I was late, the demons got the jump on him, and when I got there he was on the ground, bleeding out.”
Sam opened one.  It had the same things as the first one.  He opened the others.  “They’re all the same.  Bones, seeds, stick, leaf.”
Crowley rolled his eyes.  “Fine then.”  He headed to the door and looked back.  “Castiel, are you coming?”
Sam grumbled something under his breath and got out of bed.  He stifled a laugh when he saw Cas.  “Dean, that’s your shirt, isn’t it?”
“That’s because I was to blame.  It’s my job to protect people.  When they die, it’s my fault.  I wasn’t even there when it happened.  I should have been there.”  Dean felt more than heard his voice break and knew he had already said too much.
The door opened and Dean walked back in with Crowley following him.  “Hello, boys,” Crowley said, smiling at Sam and Cas.
Sam snatched them from Dean and opened them up.  He quickly tore out the photos and tossed the rest of the papers in the trunk.
Cas moved to one of the chairs and flicked on the police scanner.  He turned the volume down and listened for anything of importance.
As soon as the door closed behind Sam, Dean stopped drawing.  He set the pencil between the pages and closed his eyes.  “Cas?  Are you there?  Listen, I need you to come back to me.  Please, you said you’d come back.  You promised.”  He paused, not sure what else to say.  “I’m…I’m losing hope.  I believe you but come on, it's been two goddamn years.  Please, if you’re out there,
"Sometimes I think I like you better when you don't talk," he growled, but his words held no bite. Erin nudged his shoulder playfully.
Erin smiled. Her quirky, lovestruck, trenchcoated dork of a friend was gonna be alright. Despite the odds, Cas and Dean and Jack found themselves a home, and they're gonna be alright.
A few seconds passed in stunned silence. “Well, I guess that’s one less thing we have to worry about,” Dean mused, looking down at Cas, still resting his head against his chest. His hands slid from Cas’s waist, gently circling his wrists as he pulled away. “Wanna go to bed? You seem pretty worn out and I’m tired as fuck, we can come back in the morning to clean up the glass ‘n shit.”
"Alright, kiddo, you still hungry?" Jack simply blinked in response, allowing Dean to reposition him in his arms. Now his head was supported by the crook of Dean's elbow, his forearm carrying the rest of his body. "M'kay, just a second." Dean angled the bottle and smiled down at Jack, who babbled back before starting to suck.
erin: rip to cas/benny/crowley/every other monster and character psychosexually obsessed and infatuated with dean winchester but i’m different <3 he is literally just some guy <333
"Fuck, that's painful," Erin cursed, and to her surprise and delight, Jasmine giggled. Even more of the fear and uneasiness between them dissolved away, and she couldn't help the way her heart felt a million times lighter.
Dean lifted a hand to his face, intertwining his fingers with Cas's. "I'm still—I'm still sorry. I'm gonna do better, I'm not gonna let you fall again. You're not dead weight, you're not a burden. Never. You know that, right?" His eyes searched Cas's, pleading, shining.
"No way to tell, dear." That's it. He was going to be sick. "However, some part of Castiel has to know you. You possess a teeny-tiny sliver of his grace."
"No, Dean wouldn't just ignore you like that." Sure, he could be an asshole, cruel even, but Erin didn't think this kind of behavior was particularly on-brand for him. "Even if he did, he'd at least respond to Sam, right?" Not that she knew Dean very well, but if there's one thing she'd learned about him from Cas, it's that Sam comes first.
"Cas? What's up?" Dean asked softly. Cas chirped a couple times, distressed and fragile, before stopping with a deep breath.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Shut up, Sammy. He doesn't even talk." He stood up from his crouching stance, bracing for his knees to pop like they always do now, but the creaky joint pain he was expecting never hit him. Instead, he felt Cas slap a palm on each knee and send out a surge of grace, easing his bones. He almost fell over in surprise.
"Sure thing. You better watch me do it a coupla times first, it can be kinda tricky." Scooping out some batter, Dean filled a measuring cup and held it out for Jack. He motioned to take it but paused, looking at Cas.
"You get to be the damsel-in-distress, the bait for the big guy. See, I'm gonna send an SOS text to your bitch," she picked up Dean's phone and waved it in the air, "and he's gonna see how fucked up you are and get his ass over here pronto. And he's gonna bring the nephil with him and hand it over 'cuz if he doesn't I'll kill you. Slowly. While he watches." Jasmine put the phone back down on the table, pausing before turning back towards Dean and kicking him in the gut. He doubled over, gasping for air.
scared of being rejected, he can already feel the bile flooding his throat. But Cas is looking at him with soft blue eyes, eyes that have seen the mysteries of the universe and still find Dean to be something worth seeing, eyes that searched for Dean in Hell and found something worth saving, and he thinks maybe this time he can be brave. For Sam.
"Sometimes I feel like that's all we've done, all these years," he whispered. "Maybe we never even got past that point."
Dean's frown deepened. "What the hell, Cas? Of course I meant it. You really think I—I'd just change my mind when we got home? That I'd just pretend we didn't sort our shit out? Ignore the fact that we finally said what we should've already said fuckin' years ago? The fuck's wrong with you?"
Erin stifled a laugh. "Nah, it wasn't too bad, you know I got mad baby skills. Besides, you really needed a break."
Dean snorted incredulously, much to Rowena's amusement. She laughed, eyes still on Cas. "Aye, what can I say? I did always have a bit of a soft spot for the wee ones. I'll see what I can do about Castiel's grace. If I find anything, you'll hear from me." With that, she ascended up the stairs and left the bunker, heels clacking on the hard surfaces. The noise echoed through the main room, and Cas stirred at the sound.
Cas gave her a deadly serious look. "Of course. I will send them as often as I can." Erin couldn't tell whether he was joking or not; she sincerely hoped he wasn't. "Have a good day, Erin." With that, she watched him pick up Jack's carrier and walk through the cafe doors. The carrier swayed back and forth, Jack strapped snugly in the middle, still out like a rock.
for once. Where once Dean was Cas’s charge, and now Cas is dependent on Dean. He didn’t mind—he would gladly take care of Cas, anytime, anywhere, but he hated that Cas was like this involuntarily. It wasn't fair, that after all he'd sacrificed this was his reward. Being reduced to a fraction of what he once was, just a child with wings, dependent on a couple of washed-up hunters and a nephil with God powers.
It takes Dean a few tries to flick the lighter on because his hands are shaking that badly. He drops it into the small silver bowl, watches the stained fabric catch aflame with the other ingredients for the summoning spell. Smoke shimmers in the air above, and for a second everything is still.
"I mean, here I am, little ole me, just looking to make a run-of-the-mill crossroads deal or two. But then who do I see walking into my usual hunting grounds? A fucking
Dean knew what agony sounded like. After his decades in Hell, tortured and torturing on the racks, he'd heard just about every single pained noise possible and then some. He knew what it sounded like when you choked someone with their own intestines. He knew the noises a person made when you sliced into their body with their own sharpened rib, splitting their skin slowly, deliciously. He was very well acquainted with the sounds of suffering.
"Alright y'all, here's your order." The waitress interrupted their conversation as she returned with plates of fresh food, setting them down on the table with an impressive amount of grace. "Salad for you, darlin," placing the dish in front of Sam, "chicken for this handsome young man," winking at Jack, "and a burger for the guy with the cute kid," turning towards Dean last. She spotted Cas dozing on his lap and smiled, eyes crinkling at the edges.
