“John.” Sherlock’s voice was hoarse with emotion and he felt close to tears again. He didn’t know where it came from, but he suddenly felt like everything was going to be okay.
They would be able to survive for over a year without Sherlock having to work. He wanted to, of course, but not with his usual clients. He knew he left an impression with people and his name was rather noticeable, especially because the Holmes family was popular with charities and was mentioned in magazines quite often.
“Thank you, Mrs Hudson. And don’t let Leanna come up, please. Maybe”, he looked at the little girl already entering Mrs Hudson flat, “Janine will come, I don’t want Leanna to see her.”
In the midst of passion, John was conscious enough to take the time to make it easier for Sherlock. Alpha’s instincts were powerful, the tall man had to stay full of pleasure and desire, so that oxytocin, endorphins, and pheromones would be potent enough to trick Sherlock’s body into accepting John in his most vulnerable place.
Finally, those indescribable eyes opened for him, John felt himself falling into profound blue grey eyes. A new and wonderful dream world was opening for him, at this moment, John’s amorous feeling came all at once, it was overwhelming.
John waited… and waited but after 30 minutes without any patient's, John went out, there was no such thing as no patient in A&E… There was a problem.
Two pairs of grey eyes glowed with anger. Sherlock looked so much like Violet, especially when furious.
“What is it love?” John asked with a smile.
“With the voices!” Leanna added.
“Obviously.” And Leanna sound so much like Sherlock copying his favourite default answer it made John laughed long after Leanna went back to her play.
“John! Since when do I do anything I don’t want to do! I am sure, very, very sure! I want to try! Please! I will beg if you want me to!”
“Harry! It’s not like that!”
“I love you so much, Leanna. No matter what happens, you are my everything and I love you.”
“Papa?” Leanna suddenly appeared in the doorway, “What are you doing to John?”
“And Leanna is flourishing here too; I can assure you she wasn’t so happy when living with her mother. She has made a lot of progress”
Just right one cue, John’s phone call buzzed.
“And…What do you want me to do?” John finally chose to ask.
“Oh and how do you feel about that?” asked Ella.
“John, my John, I want you! You’re wonderful, so good! John! My alpha, so so good”
The betaed version will be up soon
Since his move into Baker Street a month ago, John had seen Ella only once. He hadn’t made a new appointment and he didn’t feel particularly hurried to do so.

Watching a naked John Watson walk off to the bathroom, Sherlock knew he would marry this man one day.
Harry began to cry and John gave her quickly a handkerchief,
“I…I don’t know how to tell her…I don’t want to disappoint her…” Harry admitted while chewing her lips and running her hands trough her hair.
“I am sorry, John, it should have been a nice evening… Roger is usually not so bad; I think he feels a little threatened by you. He is an alpha but never has been the head of a pack, and he knows you could do his job better than him… After everything you’ve lived, I…”
“Do you know what you have done to me? How people think I scared you off? How they judge me?” Janine yelled, voice high pitched with anger now.
Professor Adler also gave tips on which lawyers were specialised on supporting omegas in a divorce and the steps that omegas could take to keep themselves safe and healthy during the process, especially with heats.
“Sherlock, calm down. I am not angry at all, look at me, you’re right about him and I am definitely not angry. Well, I am angry, but not at you, at him. I hate him!”
“You told me Sarah needs your scent to increase the health of the embryo so I have been working on this for some time. Three bottles should last her for at least six months.”
Every parcel of his alpha’s cell were screaming to just go and save his mate, the love one in front of him which he could save. Would save! He had time to cry about it later.
“My John, can we buy the candy canes to decorate the tree?”
“An Italian restaurant! Oh my god Sherlock, when you want to do something romantic you don’t do it in half measure!” This time John’s exclamation was enthusiastic. Trust Sherlock to be really thorough when he went to do something.
“You... you amazing, amazing, utterly brilliant man. God, Sherlock, the things you do for me, for Sarah. I love you.” John kissed him deeply. “I love you so much. I wasn't sure whether you even want Sarah to have this child and now you...god.” Deep kisses again and John poured all of his gratefulness and love into them and they were intoxicating.
“And if that doesn't convince you, I advise you to look up Sebastian Moran. He's the leader of John's former pack now. And do you know how he got there? He shot your handsome, little doctor. It wasn't a stray bullet. We can do that again, make it look like an accident. And this time he won't survive, just to make that clear. Moriarty knows Moran quite well. They will find a way.”
Sherlock looked at him fiercely and snapped “People don’t like me, John! Harry will hate me!”
“I am a recovering idiot, remember?”
“Yes. It’s the best present ever! Thank you love!”
“Not true.” Leanna turned away and began to nestle into her father’s arm. “Do we go back to the hotel?”
“Yes, for when you need them most.”
Sherlock lifted his head, pressing a kiss to John's mouth. Communicating via kisses was definitely more John's strong suit and they got lost in the slow movement of their lips for a while.
It was very much… satisfying!
No. She had turned to Moriarty one more time.
“Who said you were killed by us? No, you were the unfortunate victim of a tragic accident. Your cabbie you see, lost the control of his car and fell in the Thames. All my brother had to do was to change the license plate and an old footage becomes the last recording of your life! So you see, your Sherlock is in no state to do any sleuthing of any sort, too occupied to mourn you. My spies reported to me the great detective is completely broken by your death and has not left 221B since.”
“Sarah will need even more help than we first envisioned…”
Mycroft looked at Anthea and to Sherlock's surprise she made her way to the kitchen.
Sherlock went to Janine's bedroom that was intended to be theirs and got a case out of the wardrobe. His things were packed in ten minutes. Just a few clothes, his violin and some medical books. Then he went through Leanna's room. She would need clothes as well, a few toys and her favourite stuffed animals. He got their toothbrushes and a few necessities out of the bathroom. Then he hid the suit case behind some curtains in the hallway.
Sherlock ignored him.
Sherlock grabbed John's thighs to spread them a little wider.
He wanted to yell at John, tell him that it would have been better to let Sherlock take the poison in exchange for Sarah’s life… But it is what it is… It was too late and all he could do was being here for John, be his moral support in order to help him cope with this ordeal...
As always, JustBecause did an amazing job beta reading.
“Found Sarah?“ Leanna’s voice was tiny, full of worry he never wanted to hear in her again.
“She is with Molly tonight… We will need to talk Sherlock. Really. I had some deep thought and… I want to make sure we are on the same page. We are both alphas, you’re right, I tend to forget it sometimes, I think… I…
“What are you saying, John? Who?”
And John saw stars indeed, entire galaxy even in the hot and warm mouth of Sherlock. This wondrous man had challenged him to come in less than two minutes. John didn’t think he had lasted more than one before Sherlock had collected all his seed…
Molly furrowed her brows. “They are in good nick. I'd say they were pretty new...” she whispered, clearly unsure of herself. Before Sherlock could react, John added his deduction.
“Stop being a drama queen, John. I called you several times. You weren’t listening.” She justified and came to sit in front of him.
John put once more his hands on the lovely face, but much more carefully, almost reverently, “Sherlock, you are the greatest man I have ever known, and I love you. I don’t need safe. I need you. All I ask is your promise that you will always try your hardest to come back to me, as I promise you the same.”
The moment he had kissed John for the first time.
This time, her smile was candid.
Walking towards Baker Street, John stopped  to look at his boyfriend.
Immediately, John knelt down to pick them up. Sherlock knew tidiness helped John whenever his feelings were chaotic and Sherlock let him.
“You’re leaving? Now? We are talking!”
“John?” Sherlock had obviously realised that his compagnon wasn’t listening properly.
Leanna had eaten half of the sandwich, cheek's red while the rest of her face was paler than usual. He should take her to see a doctor.
“Yes. Love you, Papa.”
And what about him? He was feeling guilty too because watching the detective deduce so quickly, observe his brilliance. He couldn’t deny that he like to watch it! He too felt the adrenaline running in his body…
Downstairs in the kitchen, he made himself something to eat and then brought one of the sandwiches upstairs. His little lioness was still asleep. Her temperature hadn't changed, which was good. He couldn't plan and execute an escape with a child who had high fever.
Sarah’s hand on his shoulder stopped him, “Let him go John, you shouldn’t put your job at risk for him” she then look at Roger “If I hear one more word degrading alphas or omegas from you, I will fire you! I won’t tolerate this behaviour in my service!”
Sherlock was the one to help her to her feet and she found herself holding him and crying into his chest.
“I suspected it was something about his vocal cords, I know babies are all different but his sister is making a lot of noise when he is very quiet. Babies usually cry to communicate, but with him I already identified three distinct faces he is making to express he is hungry.” Sherlock continued his explanations looking with soft eyes at the sleeping baby, “There are four courses for learning sign language in London, I will ask Mycroft help to identify the most proficient one…”
John's finger ran through Sherlock's curls.
(See the end of the chapter for
The older Holmes brother ignored the comment, walking towards the window, umbrella clicking against the floor.
“You can’t tell me something like this and not be sure, Mycroft.”
Sherlock had spent the whole day packing, forcing himself not to think about John. He failed. Everything in the flat reminded him of the man he loved.
“Hmm, okay, you win. First, I am still working in the A&E, second I may have the emergency doctor post, and finally, I have…flatmates, I suppose…” He knew he was smiling like a lunatic but he didn’t care.
The day Leanna was born.
The back of the watch was a little darker, some oxidation maybe? John tried to clean it by rubbing it with his thumb. That’s how he felt it, there were a carving, so thin it wasn’t visible but he could feel it. John felt a rush of adrenaline at the discovery. What was it? Something Sherlock had secretly engraved? Or just a scratch? But no John had been very careful with it and there was definitely a pattern. It was thrilling, a secret message… So like Sherlock!
Fall. He liked the concept.
“Leanna! You must warn me when you do that! I could drop you!” John’s smile demented his words, he knew, but couldn’t help himself.
“Yes. That. I just called you my doctor fish.”
“You have unguarded access to the morgue and the labs for 3 months at Barts.” John was quite proud of this gift. He had thought long and hard about something meaningful to give and had contacted his old friend Mike Stamford. He had been able to help orchestrated the whole things. John had promised to pay all the pints at the pub in the future for the favour.
Sherlock pulled John closer and buried his nose in the blonde’s hair. They hadn't talked about Moran yet, not with Leanna around. “Are you alright?”
They went back to Baker Street tired and mostly content. John promised himself that if an opportunity presented itself, he would do something about his…attraction.
“Too many nights apart.”
“John! Just, just get on with it! I told you, I prepared my… AAH!”
Sherlock was tempted to ignore the question. Of course, his little one. As if he would tell a story to his wife, or his lawyer.
Sherlock seemed shocked by the sudden soft music resonating, “John, you will wake up Leanna.”
How do I know somebody is romantically interested in me? SH
Sherlock finally shut up, out of breath.
“Did the orgasm make you this adept in expressing yourself?”
“I don’t guess, John… I don’t have enough data…”
“I am …” He didn’t finish his sentence when the nurse had already fled his office. His name was Peter if he remembered correctly. He must have been present in the pub, or worse, rumours had spread. Alphas weren’t very common in the health sector, except in surgery maybe.
“So John means tiger? Because you call me lioness because that's what Leanna means.”
They were going to shop for new Christmas decorations, John had nothing and he wanted Leanna’s first Christmas at Baker Street to be fairy-tale like. He had a very funny argument with Sherlock about introducing Santa to the little girl.
Malo never loved his big sister more than. She was epic!
first I wanted to thank you for all the amazing comments on "Three make a heart". They made us even more excited to write part 2 "Two growing hearts" and they absolutely made our day every time. It is an amazing feeling when someone likes what you wrote so much, they get emotional about it. That's the biggest compliment a writer can get.
“Mrs. Monkford?”
He felt better with every mile added to the distance between him and the Holmes Manor. Leanna stared out of the window, sniffling and rubbing her eyes from time to time. He felt guilty for dragging her out of bed, when she felt so horrible, but this was his only chance. Leaving would become harder with a nanny in the house. And if he was honest with himself, he would probably lose his courage to do this soon. Leaving his parents wasn't that hard, he had never been one for sentiment, but the prospect of raising Leanna on his own, always watching his back, made him doubt himself. It was better than Leanna growing up with a heartless mother.
The waiting room was full. They were a little early. John began to play with the watch Sherlock gave him for his birthday. It was a work of art. It was a new habit to look at it when he was bored, Sarah was too occupied texting with a smile on her lips.
“Then Someone else must have done it. I am so sorry Sarah, so very sorry!” He couldn’t look at her. This was close to a rape, for her…and for him. They hadn’t chosen this, not given consent in any way.
“I can ask Lestrade if we could question the suspect if you want to.”
John woke up suddenly from Sherlock jerking in his sleep.
“John, divorce exists. And anyway, he clearly doesn’t feel anything for his wife… John, I hope the alpha/beta pairing doesn’t make you hesitate!”
John giggled, pressing kisses to Sherlock's clothed shoulder. “Well, it's just that I don't want to dance with you, whenever we're alone. Not dressed, anyway.” They both giggled and Sherlock's hands travelled down to John's bum, squeezing it gently.
John interrupted the long explanation by kissing his glorious man.
Closer. Too close.
Sherlock. He had to tell him, reassure him too, Mycroft had probably told him everything...
“Nobody thought so – nobody except me. I was only a kid myself. I read about it in the papers. The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out it was too late. But there was something wrong; something I couldn’t get out of my head.”
“John!” Sarah said loudly.
John nodded, closing the bracelet around Sherlock's left wrist.
He was really glad to see her, not because he particularly liked her, but because Leanna did and that was the most important.
Sometimes, Sherlock imagined John going on cases with him. Not, that the doctor was exceptionally clever, but he was less of an idiot than most people. And Sherlock had always wanted an assistant. Keeping a low profile had priority right now, so he didn't take cases anyway. Still, he played with the idea in his mind palace when he was bored. It happened rarely, these days, to his own surprise.
“Don’t listen to your fathers Leanna, come with me, I will read it to you properly” Uncle My was not very good with the voices but Leanna thank him and praised him for his very serious effort.
They came back home with lots of Christmas decorations and a tree that was to be delivered the day after. Sherlock was already home and he needed only a few seconds to see that something had happened. It was something John really appreciated, he didn’t need to say anything, Sherlock already knew they needed to talk later.
“Sherlock, love. Let me take Leanna to Mrs Hudson, and we will talk.”
After a quick lunch, John opened all the windows, Sherlock had put his Beta’s scent today, but more days than not, he didn’t bother at home and the flat was full of his alpha’s scent. Sherlock had sad eyes when he looked at John. It wasn’t fair, he knew, but his sister and Clara didn’t know about Sherlock, and they had decided it should stay this way for the moment.
But John wasn’t listening. There was a distinctive scent lingering on the sleeping man. A smell which sent him back to more than a year ago in Afghanistan.
Birthday present to myself: toture our readers :P ~ Vany aka Strange_Johnlock
What? John couldn’t believe he had just blurted out his proposal now! He could feel himself blush… Oh God. He had wanted to do this properly, he had wanted to give a wonderful memory…
Sherlock sighed, “You can’t expect me to obey your orders, John. You can’t ask me to never do something. I can’t make that kind of promise. It would be a lie. I don’t want to do that to you.”
“Of course,” Sherlock thought, “no one can know that we can't stand each other. Perfect little family.” And then a more shocking discovery, as he looked at his omega's face. She had forgotten.
Leanna was asleep, her little face red and the stains of tears on her cheeks. Sherlock felt her face, she was a little feverish. His poor little girl. He wondered why Molly hadn’t try to call him to warn him about Janine firing her… Hadn’t time for that now, not his priority, maybe he would try to find out more later.
“John.”, Leanna turned to her father, “Papa, we are not leaving? Promise?” Leanna was still a little distraught about the whole leaving or not thing. She had been very strong with her Papa, but she had cried the day before when they told her they wouldn’t move out..
John finally came back with two cups of tea and a fruit juice. He had the scan in his hands and gave it to Sherlock.
“You're mine, Sherlock. I wanted to be yours.”
“It’s not… It’s not what I want! I meant to say… I want you to choose the safest path, because… Sherlock, I can’t imagine living my life without you in it… I don’t want to lose you to some petty criminal… Knowing I could maybe save you… I would never be able to forgive myself if I lost you because I wasn’t there to protect you. I am sorry if you felt like I don’t trust you to protect yourself. Please forgive me…”
“A month after your birthday, little mouse. Babies take a long time to get big enough to come out.”
“There are clear signs. I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago and that’s what the staff of Janus cars spread on the seats. They provide a very special service. If you’ve got any kind of a problem – money troubles, bad marriage, whatever – Janus Cars will help you disappear. Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in some kind of trouble – financial, at a guess; he’s a banker. Couldn’t see a way out. But if he were to vanish, if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver’s seat ...”
“Papa?” Leanna set up and rubbed her eyes. “Oh. Is that…?”
He was so focused; he didn’t hear the detective come back. The man was most of the time very loud in his movement but when he wanted to do so, he was nearly undetectable. And Sherlock used his talent to sneak behind him and kiss him softly under the ear.
“No.” John's voice didn't leave any room for discussion as he stood in the doorway, Leanna in his arms. His face was that of the soldier, the army pack leader and in any other situation, Sherlock's body would have... reacted to that. Right now, he knew he had made John angry and that was not good.
“What?” John exclaimed. He had expected a lot of things, but not that. “Why are you asking that?”
After coming back from cleaning up, he noticed he had a missed call on his mobile phone. Sarah? Strange… He should call her while he had time.
“Hamish, get out of here. I am sure Harry didn’t invite you here to cause trouble. So just go without fuss for once.” John’s smile was predatory.
Scorned with such blood to stain his claws :
Firstly Sherlock had seemed to forget what size he wore. His shirts were unbelievably tight! He had asked him about it, but the git had just ignored his inquiry “I don’t know what you’re talking about John. Now, could you buy some milk, I finished the last bottle for an experiment.”
The arrival of the twins in Baker Street changed their lives, which was something Sherlock had, of course, expected. John, Leanna and he went over to the girls’ flat a lot and if they were in 221B for once, neither of them could stop talking about the babies. Leanna was especially in love with her little brother, who was a little weaker than Matilda was. Sherlock was so proud to see her full of the care for others he had lacked his whole life and had found in her and John.
“You kiss me because you like me?”
He could here John taking a few steps towards him.
“Try to do what I do.”
Moriarty had threatened Sherlock, his mate… something scaring him enough to not speak of it with John. The ex soldier kept pacing inside the living room, now anxiety rivaling with his anger… If only he had made Sherlock talk to him, truly talk to him last night.
Sherlock screamed. He screamed and screamed, until he was finally alone, throat sore and fist clenched into the sofa cushions.
John watched the train leaving with a heavy heart. He knew Leanna would have a wonderful holiday with Mrs Hudson and her sister in the countryside. She would discover all the farm animals with delight and curiosity so similar to her father’s. John almost regretted their decision to stay at Baker Street and not go with her, Mrs Hudson had offered after all… But it was a golden opportunity for him and Sherlock to be alone and…experiment together more…intensely… about their relationship and coupling. It was important he thought that they had some experience as just a …simple couple. Who was he kidding? As if anything involving Sherlock could ever be simple!
Leanna would be perfectly safe with John Watson, Sherlock realised.
Sherlock knew that the best lies were those closest to the truth, especially with a toddler around, who didn't get the concept of a lie quite yet. And why shouldn't he be honest, except for the fact that he had to hide a few facts about his identity, like his second gender and surname? He couldn’t risk it all…
“They are kissing!” John shouted with joy.
But his dark thoughts were interrupted by a small voice, “Moriarty? Who is he? What does he want with Sarah?”
“I am not the only one to think that you know. There are lots of omegas working here because Sarah is the boss and she tries to maintain good work-relationship. But her boss is a neuro surgeon alpha and not very careful with abusive behaviour. It’s nice to know the new alpha doctor isn’t a dick! Even my beta co-worker agrees with me.”
“Sherlock, it is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard… And you created it? For me? I don’t have words to explain what I feel. Sherlock, my love, let me show you, let me make love to you, I want to imprint my love on your body, on your soul, just like you did to me… Please” John had interrupted his speech with small kisses on Sherlock’s neck and was progressing to his jaw, his eyelids, his nose…
When he opened his eyes again, he was ready. Henry Garrideb, not so much.
Why was he always the one getting kidnapped? It was becoming very tedious indeed. John could already hear Sherlock gloating at the coming Christmas party about rescuing him… again.
Luckily, Sarah’s bag was like the Alibaba’s cavern!
John felt so much relief that he could have laughed. He hugged Leanna tightly instead.
“She is alive.” Molly finally said. “She is awfully pale… but she doesn’t seem hurt… Right John? She looks…fine.”
John asked the cabby to hurry and felt his anxiety grow with Sherlock not responding his texts.
John was sure his heart stopped beating for a second. “What… What did you do to Sherlock? If you hurt him, I swear, I will end you.”
“John! You must keep calm. You just said it, it’s a taunt to make you lose your mind, keep you from thinking, you have to listen to me…”
Sherlock’s petulance made John laugh and he took the detective’s hand in his and slowly massaged it with his thumb. He was delighted to see Sherlock’s ears turn red. John loved to see all the little ways he could make the tall and usually impassive man react to him. It was exhilarating and he could feel adrenaline run in his body as if had just run after a suspect.
“What do you mean, about us?!”
John was flabbergasted. The biscuits looked like bees, they were so cute! But wait, birthday?
John heard a growl behind him and soon, Sherlock was right next to him.
“John!” And the detective, for the first time without word, just kissed him. It was a happy kiss, John and Sherlock were smiling too much to make it more.
“Molly colour the bird. Here, in green.”
“I am not too sure about letting strangers touch me, but I am looking forward to the rest of it.”
“Well, I am just giving us some extra help to be able to find each other.”
Mycroft lifted his eyes from the floor to look at his younger brother. “Seeing you happy was all he needed to be happy himself. He was an adult able to make is own choices. Don’t be too hard on yourself and go to see Leanna. You know you need her now.”
Real life has been quite busy for us, and we couldn't get the chapters beta read. Sorry :(
Sherlock sat in his armchair in front of a wall of newspaper. They only part of his husband he could see was the top of his head, silver hair combed to the sides. John had been reading for almost half an hour and Sherlock had spend his time deducing what the articles were about by the way John’s hands twitched and the little sounds he made from time to time. A scandal in the royal family, the current sport results, four crimes NSY had been clever enough to solve.
“Love, Sherlock, are you…are you sure? Really sure? I don’t need that you know… We can do…other things, we are not…obliged.”
Sebastian didn't sound the least bit tired, even at 3:30 in the morning.
She turned away to put on gloves.
The gynaecologist was visibly surprised but soon found his composure again, “Alright. You know it’s not the ideal situation for a healthy pregnancy. It will be hard. The omega’s body is adapted to assured pregnancy while bonded. Your body will lack the hormonal input from a bonding bite and the presence of a mate. The risk of miscarriage is a lot higher.”
https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f3/02/ab/f302ab5fe488a32b63aae5097bdf0ec2.jpg
The tall man approached him slowly and took his throbbing erection in his hand, “Don’t worry John, I know how to make you see all sorts of stars” He whispered darkly in his ears before pushing him on the bed.
John was furious. How could this sorry excuse of human being dared insult Sherlock! He was going to make him regret each of his heinous word with his fists if he needed to. He couldn’t control anything anymore, he didn’t even want too…
And right on cue, the little girl appeared at their door, a big excited smile on her face.
“John! I’m sorry I’m late! There was a problem on the tube and no phone service. I hope you didn’t wait too long.”
John took refuge in Sarah’s flat. Now that they knew there could never be anything else between them, Sarah had become a very good friend. John thought about that infamous date with a few weeks ago. God, it had been catastrophic. He had barely been able to follow Sarah’s conversation, looking at his phone every 5 minutes, wondering and worrying about Sherlock. Sarah hadn’t been fooled and quickly put an end to his masquerade. She told John she didn’t want to lose him as a friend and clearly, this couldn't go further. He was so grateful for her understanding and so sorry to be unable to care for her like she deserved to be.
Sherlock couldn't stop thinking about his mother and her stupid expectations. He hadn't told John about meeting her to not ruin the Christmas mood for him or Leanna. John still sensed that something was wrong with him, but didn't mention it, for which Sherlock was glad. They had so
“Balthazar!”
He made his way to the bedroom and stopped two steps from the bedroom door. That sound, he knew that sound. Fast breaths, getting faster, the rustle of the sheets. John must have decided to start without him.
Leanna didn't seem too keen on leaving John's embrace, but for whatever reason she liked Mycroft.
“There are so many things I love about making love to you” he whispered right into John's ear. “I love that you treat me like I'm the most beautiful man you have ever seen. It's in your eyes and your kisses.”
“You think she murdered her husband?”
“You don't take care of yourself. You don't eat, you sleep too little and now you let someone stab you. This is going to stop. You are not getting yourself into danger again. Ever. Because I can't lose you and Leanna can't lose you. Not to a five, or a nine. No. more. Cases. On. Your. Own.”
“See, you even need a beta to help you! You’re no true Alpha!”
And as the sun rose over London making its way through the window and over the floor to their bed, painting their sheets and golden skin, John and Sherlock reached orgasm in each other’s arms and it felt like flying.
“How is Sarah?”
“Daddy! Look what we did with Papa!” The little girl approached still very careful to not drop a single biscuit, “It’s for you! Happy Birthday!”
“My omega and I are trying for children. We've been married for a year now and....” Sherlock stopped listening, concentrating on the picture of Leanna in his mind. He would need to buy her a birthday present while in Dublin. He was caught up in the thought of books about bees he had read as a child, when they arrived at the police department.
Sherlock's POV
With that she was gone, the sound of her footsteps fading. Sherlock had held back, until she was gone. He fell to his knees, tears filling his eyes as he cried silently.
Sherlock ignored John's warning and kneeled down next to them, fishing in his pockets for his magnifying glass.
“I see… Your concerns are valid, I’m afraid…” Sherlock thought hard and added “She called you my John?”
The younger huffed. “I know a hundred reasons why it is. Leaving Janine is the first.”
“You don’t know anything about our parents! We are not freaks!” She shouted, furious. Malo tried to calm his sister putting an hand on her shoulder but she ignored him.
Sarah was right, he shouldn’t let his fears and social norms dictated his live anymore. He definitely was in love with Sherlock Holmes. The answer was plain to see on his face. John was a soldier at heart. Once a decision made, he would assure it, no going back.
Oh indeed, John thought before throwing the man on the mattress and lavishing him with love and dedicated attention.
The detective had been so understanding it hurt. John felt asleep in those strong arms, secure.
“What? No, no it’s not…”
Sherlock hung up. He went into the bedroom and got his clothes, all the while trying to avoid waking John. His boyfriend needed the sleep; he was in constant fear for his children and Sarah’s lives.
Their cuddle was interrupted by a little voice, “Papa? John? I'm hungry”. Leanna had come downstairs on her own, her new bee cuddly toy in her arms.
“You like it? Good. I deduce it from your photograph and well… Harry may have told me about a lost watch you loved…”
“Yes.”
“Petronilla!”
“Jawn!” He moaned, “You…I am not beautiful!” He tried to protest, “I am not soft like an omega, I am just tall, bony and…”

Sorry, we are late this week.
“If you could open your shirt a little, she can profit from your body heat.”
“I read your texts…Those you sent to me while I was…away… Sherlock, I am so sorry for what I make you go thought… Will you really be able to forgive me?” John’s voice was wavering at the end, he felt so weak.
Sherlock wanted to scream. He wanted to tell her that Molly had been the only constancy in their daughter’s life for more than a year, after Janine had stopped her tendency to fire their nannies every two months. He wanted to tell her that Molly loved Leanna more than Janine did and that her only love was the one she had for herself.
“You are bonded to another omega! You can’t stay here with Sherlock! So give him back! What sorry excuse of an alpha are you?”
“Will a cuddle help make it better?”
Angelo brought their panna cotta a while later and they started eating.
John realised Sherlock just made a very important confession about himself. It was a gift. A little light shone into Sherlock’s mind. John did what he wanted to do for a long time, took Sherlock in his arms and hugged him.
The ting of the pink phone made Sherlock sit up suddenly. It was still dark outside and it took a second for him to realize what was happening.
Idiot! As if John could live in a world without Sherlock! The void… It was already invading him… No, it wasn’t fair! A life for a life? What kind of sick choice was that? But John was a man of action, always the soldier. His mate was in danger and he would save him. John would NOT stay there, watching the love of his life dying in the fragile hope that Moriarty would keep his promise! Sherlock deserved… everything good, not… this…
John wiped Sherlock tearing eyes, and covered his love with small kisses in all this adorable face. John knew Sherlock’s comment was a joke, a way to diffuse the tension, but the idea of a proposal had been planted, if it could calm Sherlock’s insecurities, he should think about it… It was to early now, of course, but some day.
“I love you, too.”
“Leanna wants to see you.”
“John… I like you, a lot. It would have been worse if a stranger or someone I despise and want to take my liberty away from me. You have Sherlock, you love him. If you didn’t, you would have lost it completely and bit me or try to kiss me. There is no question here, no bonding! We are just friends.”
Sherlock clearly read too many magazines but John would not tease him about it now, definitely wouldn’t do to shoot himself down by vexing his love! And well, all the romance and arrangements were, without the shadow of a doubt, working for him. He didn’t need to be seduced but it was nice nonetheless, and very, very sexy…
Christmas in July :P
He knew the phone. The case was pink.
So, he send a mail to Professor Adler, expert on second genders and bonds. They had worked together on a case years ago. He gave her all he had found out and the thesis he had come up with. She didn’t seem too interested at first, but contacted him weeks later. They talked over the phone and she really considered doing a study on the topic.
When the doctor turned around he smiled one of those smiles that signalled he would soon punch something.
“Yes. Yes, you’re right. Tomorrow. Hold me Sherlock, please, and don’t let go.”
John came back half an hour after leaving, running like he had the devil behind him.
Sherlock reached out to touch her nose carefully.”Hello you. I’m… your Papa. You are so beautiful.”
John quick apology was cut off by a soft kiss. “John. You are always my priority. You, Leanna and the future twins... Always”
John kissed his boyfriend hello. He had been a little hesitant first to kiss Sherlock in front of Leanna but her father had not had such reservations. “She must get used to seeing us together John, we told her we were, she won’t understand otherwise!”
Sarah had a glint in her eye, she wouldn’t take no as an answer.
“Yes. We will do what we can to assure their well being.”
“Yes, yes, I suppose so. Mrs Hudson on the other hand…”
Mycroft, already standing by the door tried to smile again, failing.
“I… Of course I appreciate living here John! You make me laugh and… yes, and you… Hmm, you’re my friend. And the experiments, if they … bother you I can change, find something else, I…”
“Hmm. Patience John, not yet.”
“Molly.”
“John…oh, yes. John.” They hadn't done this a lot, not this way around, with Sherlock's cock in John's mouth and maybe John wasn't the best at giving blow jobs, maybe he wasn't even good, but it was perfect for Sherlock.
Sherlock decided to be honest. John deserved that in a vulnerable moment like this.
The detective looked at him with fear in the eye.
“Agreed. I'm sorry.”
John Watson, alpha in the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, doctor, not bonded. He seemed to have taken Sherlock and Leanna under his protection. She wondered what Sherlock had told him. She had wanted to meet him, to convince him that it was in Sherlock and Leanna best interest for them to come back with her. He was an alpha, she could manipulate him. But Moriarty had categorically refused. He said John Watson would never agree to that, he knew the type, so they had to be more cunning. It turned out, Moriarty knew Watson because he had already worked on his profile; someone had paid him to find a way to discredit the man. The only solution he had find had been to eliminate him, all the others thing to try and corrupted him had failed. No, the only way Sebastian Moran could have what he wanted was to kill or hurt the alpha permanently.
John remembered when they had arrived to the Holmes’ Manor. Sarah was already with the paramedics, ready to go to the hospital. She was a mess, obviously tired and pale from lack of sleep and sunlight, a river of tears falling from her eyes, silently. It seemed then that she would never be able to stop crying, her hands protective around her belly. But John just felt such a joy and relief seeing her. She was alive! Gods, she was alive, John hadn’t caused her demise by choosing Sherlock after all, they still all had a chance to be a family, to be happy when time had passed to ease the painful memories.
What was Sherlock doing?
Tiny fingers closed around his, when he touched her hand. God, he was already in love.
Sherlock collapsed against John, “My daughter just saw me groping you.”
“Dashing? Really? Should I worry?” John tried to joke. But she was right, as usual… Smelling Sarah’s pregnancy was…difficult…He had impulses, he wanted to protect her, take care of her needs, be near. He had stopped himself smelling her more profoundly several times. He knew it was normal, a biological imperative all alphas felt with their pregnant omega. Except she wasn’t his. He didn’t want her to be. And even more important, he didn’t want Sherlock feeling insecure or threaten in their relationship. But he wanted that baby. All those contradictive feelings were at war inside him, not a very comfortable situation to be in.
Sarah and Molly both looked tired, but they had that motherly glow about them that made them beautiful. Especially Molly had gained a lot of self confidence over the last few weeks, caring for Sarah in hospital and now the babies.
Sherlock's eyes snapped open, his breathing fast and his heart racing.
John finally got up, he just couldn’t sleep, too much… excitement? Nope, don’t think about it, get up and have a cup of tea. It should calm his nerves.
John nodded. “Yes, Dr Watson. But who will do all the work then? Someone will need to cook and clean and change the light bulb.”
“John! I need… I need more! Please!”
Sherlock was still as fascinating as he was on the first day. His quirks and little experiments were a delight most of the time. There had been this one time when Sherlock had found the way to almost destroy his table top… John hadn’t found it funny at all and Sherlock had sulked the whole evening, but he couldn’t stay cross with Sherlock very long. The morning after Sherlock had apologised and John had bought a resistant and more durable table covering.
“I can't say the same about you, James.”
John spilled the beans. He told his friend everything except that Sherlock was in fact an alpha, it wasn’t his secret to tell.
John wanted the best for hime. John was his protector. And Sherlock was grateful for it. John looking out for him and sometimes taking control in the bedroom didn't make Sherlock less of an alpha. Neither did the sex.
Dropping his robe, Sherlock got underneath duvet, it smelled of a mixture of both his and John's mingled scents, which was enough to start the spark in Sherlock. Hands wandering over his own body, down and down, ignoring his growing erection. Once John was here, Sherlock would lose the patience for preparation and he had the time now, so he started by inserting one finger into himself. He had done this before, mostly while wanking in the shower, so he soon went and added another. In and out. In and out. He wanted John to be here, to watch him as he got ready for his cock. He had thought about the knot before. Alphas only knotted their omegas during heat, it wasn't a part of everyday sex, but Sherlock would never be able to take the knot. An Alpha's body wasn't made for penetration, lacking it's own lubricant and even preparation wouldn't spread Sherlock wide enough for John's swelling. They would have to talk about that, but for their first time this would be enough.
John looked him in awe, kissing the knuckles of his left hand. “God, love. I could come from you talking like this alone.”
John's cock was beautiful, thick and flushed pink and Sherlock couldn't hold back, he needed to feel him, taste him. Sherlock pressed a kiss to the round gland, precome wet against his lips and Sherlock was addicted. He had never done this before, but he wanted to do it so badly right now. He kissed and licked down the shaft and up again, eyes on John's face. The doctor's eyes were closed, head thrown back, as he cursed and moaned. Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, they all had nothing to the symphonies John could compose in his arousal.
He wanted to try and make his presence known to Sherlock so that they could… What? What was Moriarty saying?
“Well, when I have such a wonderful specimen of alpha in my bed, I can’t resist! And we still have time…” And to make a point he took the member already a bit engorged in his mouth.
“John. Is there something wrong?”
“…Yes. I saw her phone call. There weren’t many reasons for her to call so late. You were asleep.”
“Neither do I, little lioness.” They had been so happy. A week ago, before the article, they had been so happy. There had been fights, as in any relationships, in any family, but they had been happy. Now that happiness was in danger with only a little article by a brilliant criminal. Brilliant and dangerous
Throughout the trial, something had been odd. Now that she was let away, he finally realized.
“From what Molly just told me and what I know from Sarah’s schedule at work, she disappeared while she was still working, if she died we would know already. Sarah is an intelligent woman, she wouldn’t have put herself in danger or go somewhere alone. If she went unnoticed, she must have been in a good health. People are extremely aware of a pregnant omega. It’s biology. No, I am sure she is alive. But John…”
“Sherlock! Sarah called me, they need me to replace a doctor! I’ll be back in 2 hours! When does Molly bring Leanna back? Tonight or tomorrow?”
It was dark again, when Sherlock came home. He didn't wait in the living room. He needed John.
The man seemed to hear him in spite of the waterfall noise. He turned around and John felt struck down by the intensity in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock deep voice broke John’s apathy and he quickly followed after the man.
“I love you too Sherlock. We will deal with whatever happens together. I won’t let anything make you doubt again.”
“It's her birthday,” Sherlock burst out and his wife put her finger to her lips.
Sherlock sat down on the sofa, watching the two ladies of 221 Baker Street walked down the first flight of stairs. The brothers continued their conversation when Leanna's babbling had faded.
Sherlock wanted to punch someone. He usually wasn't one for violence, but the doctor had been more than incompetent. He had told him Leanna had a common cold, but his daughter was worse now after the visit at the surgery. He spent the day cuddling her as she napped, looking for flats on his phone. The internet connection at the hotel was horrible and he wanted to yell at the woman at the reception, but he knew he had to keep a low profile.
“We are undercover, Molly. That's why Papa's called Scott now. Even John don't know,”
“Idiot.”
Unusual for the detective to state the obvious, John couldn’t pass up the opportunity to tease a little, “Yep, a wonderful orgasm, one of the best! Good deduction, that!” But John’s smile flattered a little when Sherlock’s flabbergasted face didn’t move. “Sherlock? You okay?”
The woman was throwing the weight of her body against the wall, minding her swollen belly as much as she could. The old man almost lost the grip on his gun when he saw she was handcuffed and gagged. When she saw him she froze, her eyes wide with surprise and something close to hope.
Sherlock hit the door behind him, his knuckles burning with pain.
“Daddy? I can call my John Daddy?” Leanna looked very excited by the new word. “Marco has a daddy too, I am happy I will have one too!” And she literally jumped to John and kissed him before hugging him using all the strength she had.
“Yes, love?” He took off his gloves to pet her hair and she leaned into him. “Nana said mummys and daddys have a baby because they love each other really much. But Daddy loves you, why does he have a baby with Sarah?”
“Right back at you!” John laughed, “So, how far are these magnetic stones of ours effective?”
“Hmm, very sweet indeed.” He rumbled, before continuing visibly amused “You forgot it was your birthday.”
“Did she tell the truth?”
“You…you told me…Janine was right. I was a freak, obsessed with disgusting corpses and murder and…I could not provide you what you needed, and I was not worth the…trouble.”
“Hello, John.” Sherlock's voice sounded dark even to his own ears and he pressed his lips to John’s temple, as the doctor pulled him into an embrace.
John didn’t have a job anymore. Considering the altercation with Roger and the media storm around his relationship with another alpha, he was more a liability than an asset to the clinic. If this situation had first angered him, he could now see the advantages too. He was free to follow Sherlock even if right now they were keeping a low profile. Being jobless wasn’t easy for him but it had its perks!
Hi everyone!
“Sherlock, it’s…it’s perfect! How…How did you know?”
A bottle of beta spray usually lasted Sherlock two months, three now that he only put it on when he left the flat. He got the bottles from the wardrobe in the bedroom and exactly replicated his prior steps until he had three litres of John scent.
“We can’t all have a leash on our feelings all the time!” John answered now getting angry too, but before he could continue, Molly stopped him, putting her hand on his shoulder.
“Sherlock, would you do me a favour and dance with me?”
I hope you still enjoy the story.
“He would maim them”, Sherlock said with a smirk, “maybe not permanently.”
“Tweens?” Leanna tried to repeat.
At the touch, Sherlock violently jerked away, his eyes blown open.
Sherlock grabbed John's hand and pulled him out of the hospital and onto the street. He hailed a cab and they paid the cabbie extra so he would hurry. Sherlock phoned Mrs. Hudson to make sure she was home and when they arrived they ushered her to the empty basement flat.
“He is NOT my boyfriend,” Sherlock spurted out, Janine had just hit his weak spot. John was his protector and at the same time he made Sherlock vulnerable.
“And?”
Smiling, John kissed him again, stroking his hair with the hand that was not currently working on his cock. “Of course, love. Anything.”
“Yes, my love?” Sherlock went to join them, nicking one of the biscuits from the plate on the kitchen counter. Mrs. Hudson slapped him on the fingers playfully.
“Hello. My name is Doctor Leanna Watson. Your friend had a horrible accident in the kitchen, but I was able to fix it. I'm the best doctor there is.”
John quickly turned around and took Sherlock’s head in his hands to make him bend and kissed him fervently.
“Good.”
“Leanna, this is my friend from work, Sarah. She is a doctor like me.” Daddy introduced her a lady with brown hair and a kind smile. She felt really intimidated, she didn’t know why.
Mycroft Holmes forced a bitter smile on his face and Anthea knew him well enough not to wait for an answer.
Sherlock put the Petri dish back on the table to kiss John again, just because he could and because a confused John looked absolutely adorable. Sherlock's cock, still hard, was pressed between them, but this was not about sex, not yet.
The little girl crawled up John's chest and took the thermometer out of her patient's moth.
“Because he was the one who killed him.”
“How much blood was on that seat, would you say?” Sherlock didn't even say hello.
And what the fuck had Leanna just told him?! He didn’t dare believe his ears.
“Sleeping is boring. I saw your old medical books, thought they would be an interesting read.
Sherlock helped his flat mate with the dishes only because he didn't want to have to wait for John and then they sat down on the sofa, the glasses of wine soon forgotten.
“Hmm.” John smiled, temple pressed to Sherlock's chin as he looked at the little girl in his arms.
Janine noticed him and he wanted to throw up at the fake smile on her face.
Sherlock made a decision. This was the perfect time and god, he had wanted it for such a long time. He moved from the window and into their bathroom. He showered for twenty minutes, cleaning himself thoroughly. Wrapped in only his robe, he went to the living room and moved their arm chairs to the sides. It took a while for him to move the large mattress from their bedroom onto the living room floor and he had almost tipped over the Christmas tree. He closed the curtains and got the duvet from their bedroom.
She spent the dinner playing and sitting on the laps of different peoples. Here with Daddy, she could eat whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted, which hadn't been possible when they were living with Mother.
“I didn’t ignore you! Just… I am sorry okay, I had to deal with work, tidying up the flat and other… things. I was going to call you, I promise” His excuses sounded weak even to his own ears, but Harry seemed to accept them. She had a very faint scent, as all betas, but he could now perceive the familiar smell and it felt strangely soothing. She was his big sister, they used to be best friends when they were toddlers. When their second genders were as yet unknown.
“I'm not complaining.” John stroked his hair, tangling his fingers in it, which sent sparks through Sherlock. Getting his hair pulled always did and his cock, which had been mostly uninterested due to Sherlock's thoughts about Moriarty, began to fill. Softly biting and licking John's left nipple, Sherlock slowly started moving his hips, so that his growing erection rubbed against John's thigh and John's against his belly.
He hesitated…But, god, he was so confused! Maybe if he could speak about his very bothering and constant thoughts about one detective he would be able to see more clearly.
John saw the light glee in his love’s eye, Sherlock came closer and kissed him deeply, tasting the honey on his tongue.
“Mein Herz. And I won't tell you what it means. You will have to figure it out yourself.”
Mycroft’s voice was calm as he spoke. “You saved Sarah’s life and those of her unborn children. Both Doctor Watson and Sherlock are very grateful. No One could have known that they had hidden Ms Sawyer here. The last place Sherlock would come and look for her.”
“Second stone? What are talking about?”
god, I hate Roger ~ Vany aka Strange_Johnlock
“John, always the charmer! And you little girl, you must be Leanna!” Harry took her by the hand and showed her where the other children were already playing. She seemed a little shy first but there were so many toys, she quickly ran with the others.
John nodded, pressing kisses to Sherlock's neck. “Mycroft told me about Moran. That they think he shot me on purpose. Janine said something like that to you, didn't she?”
“Don’t apologise Sarah, I shouldn’t have done that… It won’t happen again. I am going to walk home, some fresh air will help me cool down”.
“Of course! I will not tell!”
“Okay, let's spice this up a little bit.” John laid down next to Sherlock, propping up his head with both their pillows. “Sit on my chest, yes, like that. I think you'll like to take control of the speed. Just try not to... choke me, alright?”
John spent the rest of the morning finishing decorating and setting the table while Sherlock was cooking. They had found the perfect place for the mistletoe not far from the Christmas tree and Leanna started drawing again, stars and little Santas.
They talk about Sherlock’s cases; his research and John even shared some of his army’s anecdote. They had a laugh. How long since John had really laughed with someone? Well past midnight, Sherlock finally said “You should go to sleep John, the frequency of your yawns has increased over the last twenty minutes”.
Finally the deep voice said “You’re an army doctor, an alpha, used to think quickly under stress, competent, you’ll do. I am Sherlock … Scott. My daughter has had high temperature since this morning, I don’t know what to do anymore!”
Except that Sherlock wasn’t at the restaurant still. He had texted him, Lestrade knew to not bother him today… Why wasn’t Sherlock here? John was beginning to worry…
“I will. Right now, thank you. This is amazing. I'm a father, Leanna’s father. I mean officially. This is amazing.”
John giggled and it was Sherlock's favourite sound in the world. “Not necessary. There'll be another thief someday. Or a crazy axe murderer. And we'll catch them together.”
“What?”
“You,… really?” Sherlock looked at him, and “Oh… John, did he… did he hit you when you were a child?”
Now, as he waited for one of his agents to get in contact, Mycroft couldn't keep himself from thinking about Anna and the way Mummy had made sure the both of them wouldn't be happy together. Anna was married to another Beta by now and they had children. Mycroft still loved her, always would in some way, and he feared Sherlock would suffer as much as he did once Violet Holmes had torn the two Alphas apart in her effort to fulfil the norms of the elite. He would try to support his little brother as much as he could and right now that meant getting Sebastian Moran behind bars, the man that had shot Dr Watson to become leader of his military pack.
“Exactly!!! You are the smartest girl ever! John and I would like to propose Dad or Daddy, what do you think?”
“Good. I have some work to do. Moran is here, if you need something. And stay away from the window.”
“Sherlock?”
“Git! I haven’t celebrated my birthday since… forever… Thank you love! I can’t believe I totally forgot the day! So all the whispering these days… It was about my birthday?”
It was an instinct to pull John closer, press his lips to John's temple. “That's how Moriarty thinks. I know that we have the power of two Alphas to fend them off, well, three. You fight for two when you are angry.”
Jim could hear him pacing. He was hot when he was angry.
“Sex.”
With a squeal, Leanna turned around and ran towards him, almost tripping over her own feet in the process.
The day after, Leanna came to see John. She had the little blue dress she loved best on.
Daddy was very impressed with her drawings, he had said something about how she held the pen well and was very precocious when it came to perspectives. It felt good to hear John felicitation's whenever she drew something. She wasn’t used to it. Papa always told her when it was good, but she craved positive feedback, she had tried so hard to have Mother’s attention and affection before, without any success. She needed John's, Daddy’s encouragement. Her heart felt so much warmer when he told her how brilliant she was. The fear to disappoint was always here, but much less than before. Daddy always took time to listen to her, and when he couldn’t, he always explained why. He had never dismissed her.
“Oh.” John first reflex was to deny. He was progressive. He had always tried to be an alpha open minded and tolerant. But…Well… Something sounded correct in Sherlock’s analysis… And if he was honest with himself…He did felt apprehension at the thought of bottoming for Sherlock. Maybe his need to see Sherlock submit to him came from this fear…to lose himself to Sherlock…
Sherlock slid out of him, unable to move as thousands of thoughts made his brain overload. John got off the bed and onto his feet, cock flaccid and eyes wide.
“You did come from me talking like this less than five minutes ago.”
Bingo! Trust his sister to get right to the point. John took a deep breath, and tried to back pedal
He had totally lost it. He had assaulted another doctor. Made everyone afraid of him. He had indeed became a rogue, angry and uncontrollable alpha at his workplace.
John had kissed him stupid that night. He was so full of love for this man who was willing to bend his mind and principles for his little girl’s well-being. John couldn’t be more smitten and he wanted it to be known.
A littel visual for the curious ^^
Leanna nodded, reaching out for John. It warmed Sherlock's heart how the two most important people in his world loved each other. Would he love the twins the same? If they are still alive a sinister voice in his head said and Sherlock had to close his eyes for a second. If he believed the anger and erratic beating of his heart, he had begun to form some sort of attachment to the twins… He had surprised himself thinking about names before crushing the thought, feeling it wasn’t his place…
The balance or probability was merciless. Sarah was pregnant.
“It's alright, John. We'll take it slow. Just...”
John couldn’t let him continue and put his mouth on Sherlock’s nipple and sucked. He felt Sherlock almost fall from the shock and secured him by encircling him in his still strong arms. Sherlock’s chest arched from John’s mouth’s attention, it was glorious.
John was still looking at his phone when he noticed two feet.
“I can't believe I'm being the rational one. A movie at 11 am?”
“Oh, sorry. Sorry, love. That was … oh you talented thing.”
Sherlock has already started some tests and as the computer was working he was looking at the shoes again and then at a particle under the microscope. So far there had been no matches and Sherlock felt slightly annoyed. This was a good puzzle, his brain is fully satisfied with having a lot of thinking to do, but his heart knows every second gone by was a second wasted.
Independent.
But John was still out of job with no hope of finding another one anytime soon. Mycroft had suggested he helped them, but John had refused categorically. No way he would let anyone help him find a job! And Sherlock’s cases were very few and well they were keeping a low profile with the police at the moment…
“Don’t. Please. He is not worthy of your time.” Sherlock tried to calm him.
“John, boyfriend? really? How old are you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly squeaked, seeming excited. “But... there’s traces of a name inside in felt-tip. Adults don’t write their names inside their shoes, so these belonged to a child.”
“What?” he asked weakly.
Leanna, who would be a big sister to her...boys, girls. She wanted the gender of the little ones to be a surprise and after some convincing John had agreed. God, if her first Alpha had been like this...
“What? When? Why didn’t you tell me!” John was astonished by the news, he had believed Harry’s job was secure, she had told him she liked the job it.
John couldn’t sleep. He had heard Sherlock coming back late, past midnight. He hadn’t come to bed. Sherlock had preferred to sleep on the couch or his stupid chair rather than sleep with him. It hurt. Nothing had hurt more than this in this all hateful day! His ego and heart bruised in just a few hours, a little too much for the alpha.
Sherlock came and surprise he pulled out,  and there was come all over John's lips and cheeks. The doctor's finger was still pressing against his prostate and Sherlock realized that was what had made him come.
John came. Closing his eyes, pressing a wet kiss to the detective's cheek, John came and he looked so beautiful, Sherlock pressed his cock to his doctor's belly and pumped his hips once, twice, three times, before he ejaculated, moaning into John's neck.
Before they left, John saw Sherlock beside his father’s body. A new wave of anger and sadness almost overwhelmed him. If he could he would resurrect Moran to be able to kill him again and again… Just to be absolutely sure the bastard was dead, John went to watch his body. It had been kept away from Sarah and Violet, when he opened the body bag, John recognised immediately the face. Sebastian Moran. Once John had cared for him, considered him part of his army pack, how could he have been so wrong about him then ? Moran had betrayed him, caused his dismissal from the army. He had already taken everything he held dear once and had tried to do it a second time… almost succeeded in destroying his family… The look on the face was surprise, he hadn't seen his death coming. At least Violet had had some kind of revenge… But it wouldn't do much for her and son's future grief...
“I just wanted you to know they were risks for the pregnancy and the mother. Now, I will help you as much as I can. You will have enough hardship without me adding to them, I assure you I am not bigoted. Well, first, when was your last heat?”
“Good, fine. We will discuss how to make it works later.” John felt compelled to ask Sarah how she felt, how was the morning sickness and if she had already seen a gynaecologist.
The biscuits were honey flavoured, it was very sweet, maybe too much for his own taste, but he raved about how good it was.
Sherlock who had been so shy about interacting with people was now having a proper conversation with several other guests. And now, a young beta girl who had been very impressed by his deductions was … asking him to dance…
When John came to his senses again, he tried to roll over, to not crash Sherlock under his weight. But Sherlock refused to let him go.
“Oh god, your voice, Sherlock.”
John was dead to the world, but Sherlock was still too high from the case to fall asleep just yet. He took time looking at John sleeping next to him, a hand on his stomach. This nonchalance was beautiful. A trustful John was beautiful.
can't believe this is the second to last chapter of "two growing hearts"
The detective shook his head in an attempt to get rid of the pictures for a moment. There was more important things to concentrate on right now and if he was able to finish that soon, he could crawl back under the blankets with John and maybe they could do it again. Well, not the penetrative part, Sherlock could barely sit due to the burning sensation in his … bum. John always called it the world's most perfect bum. Sherlock smiled at that as he leaned over his microscope again.
Suddenly, the living room was full of men in black suits. They took a screaming Janine downstairs and into a car. Mycroft’s men were efficient. John was so angry he couldn’t really listen to what they had to say to him.
“No, Papa. You need to wake up. Malo wants breakfast and presents,” Leanna yelled, apparently as excited for the twins birthday as much as he had been for her own over a week ago. “Foo”, Matilda added to emphasise that she wanted breakfast as well. Malo just used Sherlock’s hips as leverage to jump higher.
John, still singing, had just checked on the biscuits currently in the oven and was now coming over, taking Sherlock by the hands. They started moving slowly in the small kitchen, chest to chest, John's chin against Sherlock's shoulder, humming into the detective's ear. This wasn't really dancing, it was some ridiculous movement to even more ridiculous music but somehow everything became less preposterous when it involved John. Especially if said John had his arms wrapped around Sherlock's neck.
John woke up alone in their bed, something that hadn’t happened often since he and Sherlock were… a thing. Where was his detective? Why had he left? John hoped Sherlock wasn’t bored about him yet… But it was probably his own insecurities talking, Sherlock had seemed happy those past few weeks. They had shared more and their sexual life was… extremely satisfying.
“John” Sherlock’s deep voice surprised him and made him drop the paper. Sherlock took it and frown before he turned white reading it.
John growled and almost took the phone to destroy him.
“Hmm. I know John. I know you don't. Just know I will try my best to listen if you feel the need to.”
Some days later, John and Leanna were doing the shopping while Sherlock was experimenting at the morgue. They hadn’t yet talked to her about John’s future child, they thought it was too soon and preferred to wait after the 1st semester of Sarah’s pregnancy passed. It would be a high-risk pregnancy, they didn’t want to have to explain an eventual miscarriage to the innocent little girl.
A knock on the door made John look up from his notes and he didn’t even have the time to tell the person to come in before Mycroft Holmes had already made his way into the small office.
“The sole has been well-worn, so the owner must have had them for a while.”
They soon were skin against skin and it was perfect. John mouth was occupied by sucking and marking Sherlock where a bondmark would have been while his hand had wandered to the plush ass and grabbed it. John was rewarded by a loud moan, dark and sinful. God, he loved how Sherlock could be so uninhibited with him. He loved hearing his partner moan, lost in pleasure.
“Good. Don't want my Leanna to get sick right before her birthday.”
“This is not about sex, Sherlock. This is about you being reckless with your own life. Don't bring sex into this. Our sex life is great and you are not bottoming because you want to please me, you like it too...”
“I am fine, better than fine. It was beautiful Sherlock, never heard anything like that, what is it?”
The tall man had entirely plastered himself against John’s backside, his mouth had found one more time this delicious zone on his neck, where he would be bitten if he was an omega. One hand was maintaining him while the other travelled from one nipple to the other before going south…
“Ha. It means my doctor fish, doesn't it?” John joked.
Mrs Hudson, angel she was, took care of their household and the groceries and also watched over the renovations when they were in hospital.
Sherlock got up and pressed a quick kiss to John's cheek. They never talked about their childhoods, not really. There was the future to concentrate on.
It was almost seven, John's day off. Sherlock left him a note at the kitchen table, hurrying upstairs to get dressed.
Sherlock let himself fall into his armchair as Mycroft and Anthea lingered in the doorway.
“Ooh. Sorry.” Sherlock didn’t look sorry at all…, “I do want to discuss something important with you though.”
I've been sick since Sunday. Uploading for the Advent calender is the highlight of my day :D
“Sherlock, are you...?”
After some time, Sherlock calmed down and John carefully led him to the couch. Sherlock had found new composure and sat very straight.
It took a while for Mycroft to answer, but he totally ignored Sherlock's insult.
“Read it to me, uncle My? Please?”
“I'm not weird by the way. I just can't keep myself from wanting to help people.”
No beta yet, sorry
English is a second language to both of us, so bear with us please :D
“Yes. Can go play, Papa?”
“They’re not retro – they’re original. Limited edition: two blue stripes, nineteen eighty-nine.”
Leana smiled at him. “Hello, Papa.” she whispered, before continuing her song,
“I need... I can't face your brother right now. I... I need fresh air. Can... I will take Leanna, if that's okay with you, just go to the park or something. Is that okay for you?”
With John came the scent of citron and Sarah and all of Sherlock's plan to apologize was forgotten. Someone had touched his John and Sherlock went into full alpha mode. The doctor had barely made it into the flat when the detective's body crashed against his, grey eyes filled with anger and hurt and something Sherlock hadn't experienced before he had met John, something that felt a lot like jealousy.
“Actually, yes, I am, I know it from a very knowledgeable person!”
He cursed himself for wishing he could one day play with and win against someone like James Moriarty. Back then he had not thought there would be so much to lose. How could he have imagined John Watson. He may be brilliantly clever, but he lacked the imagination, the heart of a poet. He Had thought he lacked a heart. It would have been better if he did.
“Doubt seemed to distill in his eyes, “I didn’t ask, hope you don’t mind?”
And Sherlock wanted this to go on forever.
John slowly got up, absently licking his lips. “What are you talking about?” Why did members of the Holmes family have to talks in riddles most of the time?
“Sherlock, what the hell is... oh my god, you are bleeding. What...?”
“What is it, John?”
“After weeks in a hospital I’m not particularly picky.”
It was photography of Sherlock and John dancing together a few month ago at Clara’s birthday party. They were both looking at each other with love and tenderness, smiling. When John had seen the photography, he had wondered how Sherlock hadn’t deduced his love right away back then. He was obviously smitten on this photo…and Sherlock seemed…content, at peace, John understood now what Harry had found them so obvious.
“John, you like me?” Leanna asks and began eating.
“Oh.”
Sherlock went on two small cases in the first week and loved John even more for supporting his decision, even as the doctor stayed at home.
” (see notes). They used pears instead, just to be rebellious. Sherlock had given Leanna the squeeze bottle and she had enjoyed it a lot, squealing as foam filled the bowl they were working in. John would appreciate the bowl; else he would be the one ending up cleaning the kitchen table.
“Love, you’re overthinking again. She doesn’t care, it’s just magic, that’s the trick, no explanation needed.” John had laughed at Sherlock sceptical face. The detective had given up about telling the truth about Santa after seeing Leanna’s joy when Molly had given her the costume.
His modern view about Alphas and Omega came from his parents. They were activist in alpha-omega-beta equality movement. But the society still asked their alphas to be strong and commanding, their omegas to be pretty and have lots of children and their betas to follow an alpha lead without complaining.
“My sons.. tell them.. love them. Sorry Vi..”
“They just came out! Told you John, the world is changing.”
Mycroft found a little café with no CCTV cameras around, so they didn't need to invite her to Baker Street. Sherlock knew his daughter missed her former nanny and he wanted to surprise her.
John nodded. “Thank you, Angelo.”
“…It’s not about depriving! It’s just…so unbelievable! How Santa could possibly visit all the houses of the world, in one single night!”
There's so much fluff and smut coming, you can look foreward to it :D
He didn't tell Lestrade about the cut, knowing it would only cause him to end up at A&E and he wasn't to keen on that. John was a doctor and stitching wounds was his easiest exercise.
“And I am very happy to have you here little mouse. It’s your home now, you understand?” John reiterated, to be sure Leanna would never have any doubt about her rights living here. He felt her nodding against him; her soft hair ticking his jaw. He never wanted to let go.
John was happy. He knew finding a good balance between them would be difficult sometimes. But he had never back down when challenged, they will find a way to be fulfilled both as alphas and lovers.
The soldier began probing at Sherlock’s bottom again and added one more finger.
Taking a few breaths after his tirade, John realised what he just said. The detective wasn’t looking at him.
“Okay.” She got off his lap, back to her bed and started nibbling at her sandwich, obviously without really being hungry.
He stared at his father's chest, light blue pajama top drenched in blood at the chest, where it had been pierced by the bullet. Someone had closed his eyes as a gesture of respect.
They walked along Baker Street and bought flowers for Sarah. Leanna picked sunflowers, because she liked the colour and then they took a cab to the hospital.
After a quick trip to the Yard Sherlock came home to an empty flat and he knew just where to look for his family.
“Sherlock” John’s voice was rough from arousal. He could see the immediate effect it had on Sherlock whose eyes quickly darkened.
“No.”
John sounded surprised. “Twenty years?”
There was a lot of noise and the kids were all excited, running around and discovering the new classroom.
Cold anger slowly replaced the fear. Captain Watson knew how to use it to trigger an adrenaline shot. Anger was a very useful tool he had learned to use in a fight.
“I think you will be an angel,” Leanna insisted.
The powerful voice of Sherlock stopped John’s determined walk to Roger.
We had too many ideas, so we decided to write a second part named “Two growing Hearts”. It is 3/4 written, we think we will upload the 1st chapter the 19th of July
“Of course. Cuddles make everything better. How about we order pizza and watch a movie and cuddle. The rest can wait.” John smiled at Leanna.
With that he walked away. He knew he shouldn't be this excited, but he loved the puzzles. Moriarty probably knew he did.
“Don’t patronize me! I know how people are around me!”
“Yes, it’s very telling about myself I know!”
But watching them make being away from Sherlock all the more harder. Maybe he should call back, ask Sherlock to come now finally and bond together as family, as pack… They were still risks… but hope and love were the best to help recovering…
Beta read now. Thank you to JustBecause
Harry was very active in their political movement. He felt like she never really forgave him for being an alpha and above all, his choice to join the army. The army was the most prejudiced system still existing. His parents had been more accepting of his choice, but Harry had been furious. How could he do this to her? John tried to explain it wasn’t against her or their principles but they hadn’t been listening to each other for a long time. The Watsons’ temper didn’t help either, he probably shouldn’t have spoken about her drinking problem while angry and hurt…
“Is your experiment time dependent?” John finally asked.
Sherlock froze. “Babies? As in multiple?”
Prologe
While John had a very inward-looking pensive conversation with himself, a shadow was following him.
John heart couldn’t be more full of love. Daddy, he will be a daddy for Leanna. Somehow, it was one of the greatest titles he had ever earned.
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock's nose and forehead. “I know, my love. I know. And it makes me so happy. I wish I could have resisted Sarah. I tried to fight it.”
No Sherlock loved him. Truly. He couldn’t doubt it. Sherlock had made love to him yesterday. John hadn’t been the only one defenseless then. Something had happened. He had been so vulnerable and afraid… Maybe… Maybe John being attacked hadn’t been the only reason for Sherlock’s fear… The more John thought about it, the more it appeared obvious that Moriarty must be the one behind Sherlock’s irrational fear. That psychopath knew how to elicit this before unknown feeling like no one else in the detective head… or heart...
“Yes.”
“Shh, you’re safe now. It wasn’t your fault… I am so sorry it happened…” John was feeling inadequate in his tentative reassuring world. His emotions too strong and conflicted, a mixed of relief, happiness to find Sarah in one piece and so much anger against Moran and worry for Sherlock, sadness for Siger’s death… It was all such a mess… How was he suppose to manage it!
“So, John. Will you finally explain to me why you are hiding in my home?”
Molly was half laughing and sobbing when she add, “You are lucky I was there, Sarah have strange taste about babies name, without me there would have been names like Hildegard on this list…”
The detective came back from Leanna’s room before he could hide the gift. No turning back now.
“Sorry, sir. I'm only treating Omega's and Betas. My colleague, Dr Harris will be glad to help you.”
“There was a fire. 7 men died. Sebastian Moran is said to be one of them. His dog tags were found, nothing more.”
“Mummy. What happened?” Violet could hear he was crying as well and she tightened her grip on him.
This chapter has a lot of fluff, a little smut and a tiny bit of angst :D
“And you surprise me. No one ever surprises me, but you do. Sometimes by being tender, sometimes by being rough. Always by being wonderfully attentive to my needs.”
“Yes, John. I have to, now. I don't have time for games or your emotions. I need to save Sarah and the twins and I don't mind hurting the feelings of some random woman if it gets me closer to solving the puzzle.”
Understanding hit him like a bullet. Sarah was alive. But someone else had taken her place. Siger Holmes, Sherlock’s father had died. Moriarty had won finally, someone had lost his life for them…
“You should run while you can,” John spat. The calm and tranquility he could read on the man was unnerving him more than any clear threat.
John couldn't stop smiling. He and Sarah must have looked ridiculous, smiling, but not at each other. His phone buzzed in his pocket and John retrieved it, the watch still in his left hand.
“Only sometimes John?” There was teasing in Sherlock voice and John allowed himself to smile.
“A list of name for the babies…” She sobbed, “We made it one night, feels like an eternity, but it was just a few days ago…”
Sherlock huffed frustrated. “I wouldn't. This is about pretending to....”
Sherlock squeezed John's hand in his, which was shaking slightly at the news and as they walked on, the dimension of the change sank into him. Two children.
Ember88
Sherlock held John close, kissed his face to reassure him. He didn’t know what to say, what to do. When he saw the blood flowing out of John’s neck, he took care of it like the doctor had… Licking gently, thoroughly, he hoped lovingly…
“No, well, yes, he is handsome but he is becoming a very good friend. Even my best friend maybe, too soon to tell, but I don’t want to jeopardise anything with a romantic relationship. And he is married, his wife isn’t… in the picture right now, not my story to tell, but it’s complicated. Besides, I don’t think Sherlock is interested in…that.” He finished lamely.
“Okay,” John got up, took their cups to the sink and before go into his bedroom, he looked at Sherlock still sitting in his chair, yes His chair then added “You should go to sleep soon too Sherlock. And thank you for the very pleasant night. I really appreciate the company. Good night.”
Moving back, he felt heat rising to his cheeks.
They had decided, and Leanna had been excited, that their little girl would go to Mrs. Hudson's sister with their landlady for two days. They wanted Leanna not tobe constricted to Baker Street, and for her to meet other people and children. And, if they were honest, they also wanted time on their own, for the first time in their relationship.
When she came over to discuss some facts with him, Sherlock was glad the kids were over with the girls, because damn, jealousy made John even better in bed.
When he left, John felt some nurses’ eyes on him. He didn’t think Janine’s trial and what had happened between him and Sarah had filtered out yet, but rumours where already forming and spreading. In the medical circles, gossip was unavoidable, it would spread one day, it was inevitable. John wondered about finding work somewhere else…It would be very difficult for he and Sarah in few months, when the pregnancy will be noticeable. The scents will tell people all they needed to know about who impregnated her…
John felt ecstatic. Sherlock wanted to stay. Sherlock wanted to stay here. With his daughter. With him.
“I was thinking that I want this for the rest of our lives,” Sherlock said, only realising how big those words were when John's eyes widened in surprise, right before his face softened into a loving smile.
“I…Really?”
“Hello Matilda, Hello Malo.” Leanna kissed her siblings on the cheeks.
“Not really no… It's been a year since I came back from the front, I'm not going to physiotherapy anymore, it should be getting better. Don't you think it should be getting better?" John couldn’t help feeling even more inadequate because of his limping. After passing all the exams I could possibly think about, he had been forced to accept that the pain in his leg was psychosomatic… He was a doctor; he knew it has nothing to do with willpower, so why did he feel so ashamed?
“So, not so bad so far, yeah?” John asked
John came closer and played his last card. He put his hand gently on Sherlock’s cheek and made him look at him.
“Of course I see him. I have perfect eyesight for my age!”
His own phone vibrated in his pocket.
Do not worry.
“Git! You’re not helping! I am in a serious…situation here!”
“I don’t think Mrs Hudson will be shocked by this…But we are going to have to speak with Leanna about...us.”
They had joked and talked about lighter subject next. Sherlock has soon come back to them, and as Harry had anticipated, he went right next to him, a protective and possessive arm around John’s shoulders.
Realisation came with a wave of arousal. John wanted him to fuck him. Of course, Sherlock had thought about it before, especially after their fight, but he would have never thought John would want to do that.
“Yes, love. I will explain. And your papa and I don’t beat bad people…we stop them from doing bad things… And those ladies you heard, they were saying that because I and Papa love each other without hiding, other couples will be able to do the same too.”
“…Of course.”
Their shirts were left on the floor in the hallway and they discarded their trousers and pants in front of the bed. God, John was beautiful, hiding a strong, muscular body behind old men's clothing and Sherlock loved it, loved how he was the one to know John's secret.
John giggled against Sherlock, rubbing his nose against his cheek. “You want to have sex for one and a half days straight? I mean, I love the sex, of course I do, but there has to be other things we can do.”
After a few minutes, Sherlock calmed down, his face hidden in John’s neck.
Sherlock eyes were dark with pleasure. He seemed to like the endearment, John took note of it. He would maybe try his own experiment later, about all the other names he could come up with, and see which ones were most effective.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn't know about that private detective and his... unusual ways. I'm sorry for that omega, but Janine was desperate and I supported her pursuit to get you back home.”
Carefully taking John's wrist in his hand, he guided the finger out of him and collapsed on John, breathing hard.
“Oh.” Sherlock's eyes darkened at the implication and didn't wait for more incentive to kiss John passionately. “What... What do you... What do you want?” Sherlock managed to ask between fervent kisses.
As promised, the day at the planetarium had been fun. But Sherlock wasn’t done spoiling him rotten. They had just left Leanna with Molly for the night, clearly the brilliant man had some other ideas in mind for the evening.
“Don’t worry about my back, love, you should worry about what I am going to do to you. We have approximately an hour before we will have to get Leanna, I intend to use every minute of it!”
“You are a marvel!” John exclaimed, “The English vocabulary is too…poor to express how much I love it!” He took Sherlock by the back of the neck and forcibly made him bend to kiss him soundly.”
“What?”
“The doctor Watson hasn’t given his consent to be filmed, I am erasing this material and I hope you will refrain from publishing it.” Sherlock was using his posh and commanding voice, his behaviour radiating alpha and asking submission.
“Thank you! Let me introduce you to Molly. She is Leanna’s nanny and she likes the same author you talk about all the time and that I don’t seem to be able to remember the name” John teased.
Sherlock dug his finger nails into his palm hard. It always helped to put a hurt expression on his face. John has never seen him doing this and it would be funny if it wasn't for Jim Moriarty.
“Sherlock, please, love, are you really alright?” A frightened Sherlock was insupportable for John, he had to be able to do something…
“They are kissing.”
A fight about this had been unavoidable. Alphas were stubborn by nature and maybe their lives had been too happy to be real.
He had just finished checking Leanna and explained to Sherlock she had mild strep. It wasn’t a serious yet case but there would be a 5 day course of antibiotics, just to be safe.
It was, from Sherlock, a very concrete love declaration. And John felt more in love than ever. He wanted to yell it to the world. Sherlock Holmes loved him, boring John, despite all the complications and difficulties of their second gender, and his heart was overflowing from warm and fuzzy feelings.
Oh, thought John, it would seem Sherlock was trying to…convince him about to keep their arrangement? His emotions were on a roller-coaster, he just wished Sherlock would get to the point!
“Hmm. There's more. But yes, this is the best one out of the bunch.”
If anyone is interested in beta reading for us, please leave a comment. We would appreciate it.
“Sherlock? Sherlock where are you?” John yelled.
John's ability to make an intelligible respond was gone, galvanized by Sherlock begging, he positioned himself between Sherlock’s leg, and finally he could feel their cocks sliding together. He could feel Sherlock’s hand move to his ass to impose a more punishing rhythm while his mouth was nibbling to John’s bite mark. John loved it, to have a partner not afraid to take what he wanted. He never had a sexual partner kissing his neck, it was a very alpha’s behaviour, but it was exhilarating. All those stimulations were beginning to become too much, John wouldn’t be able to keep himself from coming very long if he let it continue.
When he finally climbed the stairs, what a sight was waiting for him! The candles, a warm fire and most important of all, a very naked and visibly aroused Sherlock!
John got up first and took the adorable little girl in his arms. He hoped she hadn’t heard anything. “Come, sweetheart, let's make some hot chocolate for you.”.
But as if Sherlock knew his thoughts, Sherlock put one hand at the back of his head to improve the angle even more and John’s mind went blank, nothing left to think about except for the feeling of Sherlock against him.
“I love you,” he whispered against John's neck, carefully scissoring his fingers, moving them in and out, careful not yet to brush the prostate as to not overwhelm John.
Sherlock opened the envelope. Adoption papers.
“No.”
“Don’t worry Dr Watson. I am not a murderer, I won’t kill you. All we needed was for Sherlock Holmes to believe you dead.”
“SHUT UP! Have to? HAVE TO? What the fuck do you think you understand? Its ME and SARAH who’ve been attacked because of YOU. Don’t tell me to keep calm! I am going to ripe him apart and find my omega!”
John spent most of his time in the hospital now, even had his own bed there, as he was crucial to Sarah’s and especially the twins recovery. Their one night together had been wonderful, making love without having to worry about a thing, having breakfast together in the morning. Letting John go had been hard for Sherlock, especially now that Moriarty was dead and the game over and couldn’t do anything to help the situation, help John or Sarah.
Who'd think the lion could e'er require his aid ?
John carried Leanna down the stairs. They put both Mrs. Hudson's and Leanna's suitcases into the trunk and watched for a moment, until the car was out of sight. Sherlock felt the tears on his cheeks and he closed his eyes for a moment. Focus. He needed to focus, to not let sentiment cloud his judgement.
John looked at Sarah with a little awe. Then, a thought crossed his mind, “Hmm, Sarah? You realise that…Sherlock and I, we are two alphas…it doesn’t bother you?”
John was back in less than two minutes, kneading his hands nervously.
“Sherlock, calm down. It’s just dislocated. I will need your help to put it back in its socket.” John tried to reassure his friend who was frantically checking him everywhere he could put his hands on. If Sherlock wasn’t so clearly distressed, John would have actually enjoyed it.
love,
“John. That’s…fascinating…quite extraordinary…Twins… I never saw Leanna’s scan, Janine thought it wasn’t my concern…”
John felt his heart skip a beat hearing the threat from Moriarty, but nothing could have prepared him for what happened next.
“Santa will definitely love your gift!” Papa exclaimed. Daddy was looking at him with a big smile, it was one of the thing she had first liked about the doctor. He treated her father with kind words. She remembered that before, Mother or Grandma were often angry when talking to her Papa, she didn’t like it.
Leanna nodded, curls bobbing. “Like it here. John is very nice. And good to live with a doctor, Mrs. Hudson say.”
Sherlock put her in her bed for a nap. John couldn’t let the melancholy settled, he went to their room and took one of the present he wanted to give to Sherlock. He felt a curious mix of excitement and apprehension about his mate’s reaction to his gift. It wasn’t much but he hoped it would keep Sherlock’s mind away from his gender deception and Moriarty’s case. And that he, well…wouldn’t feel it was too romantic or cheesy of him… Oh great, now he was beginning to have second thoughts…Maybe it wasn’t such a good idea…But when Harry had shown it to him, he had thought it would be a good gift for Sherlock…
“I love that about you. I love you.”
Sherlock rolled off John, staying closely pressed to his side, as he continued speaking.
“Oh Sherlock, I love you to the moon and back!” He declared and before Sherlock could note the absurdity of this idiom, John kissed him, and kissed him and kissed him. It was his turn after all to give a mind-blowing orgasm, wasn’t it?
John put the newspaper down a few inches. He looked adorable in his new reading glasses. “How…? Why am I still asking that. I don’t know why. We’ll need to ask her.”
“John?” he knew it wasn't a good moment, but he couldn't waste another moment second. The doctor was by his side immediately. “Do you know where this is?”
“I mean... a year ago I was going to therapy, because I felt depressed. I was bored and without a pack and now I have a pack, a strange one, but a pack. Because of you I can be the father to a wonderful little girl and you... I love you so much, Sherlock.”
“Nope.”
Stupid, stupid fight… Now he felt like crying… He had to do something… He couldn’t let their relationship deteriorate any longer. For the first time, he felt like his relationship was in danger… And now that all his anger had cooled down, he could see Sherlock’s point…
“Papa?” Leanna sounded tired and curious at the same time. She had practiced the bilabial “p” sound before the “d”, smacking her lips constantly as a toddler, the only reason she didn't call him by the more common “Daddy”. He liked it. He wasn't a common father.
Groaning, Sherlock rolled off of him and John climbed out of bed, just after he stroked Sherlock's hair.
“Yes, of course I want that! This child will be lucky to know you! And Leanna! I must already be a mess of hormones, I can’t stop crying, but it’s happy tears, I promise!”
Sherlock smiled seeing the excited face of his daughter, “Nicely observed, you are a very good junior detective, already!” He complimented, “I am proud you noticed I'm in disguised today! But shush, it’s a secret! Can you keep a secret?”
“Ah, found it then!” John continued to massagethis bundle of nerves that was the prostate with glee. “I want you delirious with pleasure before you take me all, my love, my sweet darling, my so, so clever detective!”
“Sherlock.” He whispered with horror. He couldn’t believe he had really jeopardized everything by losing his temper.
“John! Did you sleep well?” Sherlock eluded.
John came back with a new lube bottle and his present for Sherlock. The man had been very obedient and john had a perfect view on his back side. Oh this was going to be such a sweet torture… He sat on Sherlock ass and began to massage his backside, under his finger John could feel muscles quickly surrender, melting under his care. The work of the previous professional masseur had obviously helped to relax all the tension and John soon had a pliant and relaxed Sherlock under him. Time to update his game.
As their guests continued celebrating, Sherlock and Janine shared her first heat and the alpha in Sherlock took over, bonding her to himself.
John looked at all the people in the room, some patients he had healed before, his colleagues some he thought were his friends… They were just staring, a mix of guilt, shame, hate, disgust in all those eyes… Now that the anger had left him, he just felt tired… he wanted to go home to Sherlock and Leanna and forget all the drama for a while.
“Yes?”
He must have finally fallen asleep because he woke up in a start. The bed still desperately Sherlock free…
John felt his inside twisted painfully. It was worse than anything, really. Mix of unbearable jealousy, a feeling he wasn’t very used to feel about his previous lover, and anger, aggressiveness even considering he wanted to rip apart anyone approaching Sherlock, it didn't matter that they were imaginary. Not an acceptable reality. Not the one he wanted.
“Clostridium botulinum!”
It was Mycroft who made it possible for Sherlock to meet up with Molly. He had hesitated to contact her. She wasn't a very strong person and he feared Mummy Holmes or Janine could manipulate her into revealing their whereabouts.
“And…If she wanted to? If she wants this baby and asks you to bond with her? Will you? Then?”
John mumbled something and wrapped his arms around him, pressing a kiss to Sherlock's hair.
John smiled at this, because John was amazing like that. Tonight, Sherlock would give him another present, even if it wasn't John's birthday today.
NO! Sherlock’s face was closed and determined… It didn’t look good at all! Would Sherlock really sacrifice himself for the chance of saving everyone? The moment John had this question, the answer was clear. Yes. Oh my god… Yes, Sherlock was loyal and loving… and self loathing enough to do something like that. Be the hero… whatever the man said, he definitely had some hero complex…
With the rebuttal, John straightened up and focused on the girl.
“Of course.”
Sherlock knew this topic was hurtful. Mycroft had really loved Anna, not being able to marry her because of their social status. It had destroyed their relationship and Mummy had made sure they broke up. Anna had been the daughter of a rather poor family, who lived in a small flat above the cafe she worked at. They had met right there, as Mycroft had given into his desire for cake. That had been ten years ago. Mycroft had never loved anyone after that.
With that he turned around and left.
We hope you will like what we stewed for you ^^
“John…”
“Happy birthday, Papa. Wake up, we made breakfast.” Pecking his cheeks and nose, the little lioness seemed more excited about the birthday then Sherlock.
“Don’t worry Harry, I understand. And I know you hated him at least as much as I did when we were kids, you were merciful, it’s not your fault he didn’t deserve it. Go back to Clara and your guests… Wait, who's that with Sherlock… Harry! You didn’t tell me our parents would be here!”
“I'm yours,” John simply said, kissing his sweaty forehead, “I love you.”
John kissed Sherlock’s misty eyes. “John” the detective sighed, “I love you too.”
“You’re co-workers learnt about your relationship with an alpha. No one of them did understabdand rumours ran wild. You didn’t support the slide remarks and whisperings…oh! It was more than that! You were ostracized…
The day had been perfect. Sherlock had loved his present, and when John had attached the wristband to Sherlock’s wrist, he had this image of himself putting a ring in his finger… One day… He had made sure with the jeweller to make this wristband very resistant and with a strong clasp… It wouldn’t come off easily… And they were some other secrets hidden in it, but he had wanted to wait for the both of them to be alone…and maybe give Sherlock the chance to try and find out for himself what the wristband could also do.
They had a little time ahead but after the new year, they will need to think seriously about what they will tell to their co-workers and how to manage people’s judgments and expectations…
“Sherlock… Am I really too…commanding with you? Do you feel I don’t respect you in your alpha persona?”
“Mrs Hudson, I am sorry, but could you keep Leanna until tomorrow? We have some…issues to take care of.”
And it was laughing and happy that they came in the living room to see Leanna.
Congratulations to Ian Monkford on his relocation to Colombia. SH
“Leanna, why do you call John, My John?” asked her father, bluntly.
“No, no, no, Sherlock, I’m not dead, I’m here!”
Thank you again for reading it, we hope you will like what come next…
“John! You have too many clothes! Please!!!” Sherlock was desperately trying to take John’s jumper off.
“Your fucking child. She will end up being a freak like you. Already looks like you. Little freakish girl. Scared off one nanny after another. And you blame me for not getting along with her.”
“Hello, little one. So good to see you.”
“Come here Leanna, I have something very important to tell you.” Sherlock took her to the couch. John sat next to them.
2. Knowing
The questions were ridiculous and he threw them into the next rubbish bin.
Sherlock took John to a quiet park and John was eating his fish and chips while the detective told him what happened with Mrs Hudson, stealing some of John’s chips. It hit him then, how much he loved the man next to him, how happy he was just the two of them, Sherlock talking, John listening…
John was pacing the living room. Sherlock knew he wanted to go out, walk the streets of London to calm down a little, but they feared Moriarty could harm John as well. John's scent filled the room, angry and sharp and full of danger. In this moment there was no doubt that John Watson had been the Alpha of a military pack.
Sherlock was dragged to their bedroom by the sleeve of his robe and shoved into the room.
“It’s okay, sweetheart. You’re fine, that’s all I need” John whispered in his little mouse’s dark curls. He looked at the lady who had kindly taken care of the little girl, “Thank you, I was so worried when I turned around and she was gone. I thought I would go insane.”
The detective was on Sarah’s computer when John entered.
“Love, how are you? Do you want to stop?”
“Sorry, who?” John stepped closer to him again, hand on Sherlock's shoulder.
“Oh, that’s great!”
“But I DO, Sherlock. I worry, when my reckless boyfriend gets himself into danger. Because my boyfriend does have a daughter to take care of! And this was the last time, Sherlock.”
They won’t keep her in tonight. SH
“Feelings? YOU are talking about feelings to ME?” she yelled. Violet went back to many years before, when she had just married and bonded Siger. He was a handsome omega then, she had thought she was lucky in their arranged marriage, it could have been worse. She even thought she was in love. But it was before she learnt about Siger’s secret relationship with a woman beta the first years of their joining. It had been a cold awakening. Something had broken inside her then. Oh, Siger had tried to make amends, but she never would be able to trust him again. She could not divorce him, it wasn’t an option then, all she could do was to save the appearance of a happy and fulfilled alpha/omega bonded life. She had shared Siger’s heat but allowed nothing else.
Sherlock slowly slipped off the chair and turned around in John's arms, kissing John slowly, arms wrapped around his neck. “It was not finished this morning and it is not a present for you, directly.”
Just as he had reached that thought, his phone vibrated in his pocket.
“I didn’t eat the last cookie!” the little girl blurted.
“Stop Sherlock, I was teasing, I’m sorry. Of course I want you and Leanna to stay here! I was downright panicking not 5 minutes ago because I thought you wanted to find your own flat, had found your own flat, wanted to leave ...me!” he managed to not say the last word out lout, “And I don’t want you to change anything! You’re my friend of course I like you just as you are. And Leanna’s well-being is important to me too. I love her. I am sorry if I made you doubt that!”
He fell asleep, the sheer variety of his emotions exhausting him onto the point of unconsciousness. He dreamed of John. And blood.
Multiples were not unusual in an alpha/omega pairing, quite the opposite. Leanna as a single child was the exception. He should have considered the possibility, it shouldn't come as such a shock. Two little Johns. Two new human beings created by Sarah Sawyer and John Watson. Two. Twins.
“Oh, here is the other freak! Kyle, you shouldn’t play with him. They are freaks ! His fathers are two alphas! I heard my mom said it was unnatural! And see! He is red haired. Only witches have red hair!”
John was cooking the thing with the peas like Sherlock always called it and very much liked even if he would never admit to enjoy eating something. But he never refused to eat it.
“I’m sorry, who? I don’t think he ever mentioned you.”
Violet stepped even closer to her son, face red, fists clenched until she suddenly stopped.
Sherlock was surprised it took his brother four whole weeks to find them. Mycroft Holmes let himself into the flat when no one was home. Sherlock found him sitting in John's preferred arm chair when he came home from a trip to Regents Park, a babbling and giggling Leanna by his side. Mrs. Hudson was out and John was meeting with his sister. Sherlock had hoped for a little experiment after dinner. Leanna had wanted him to read her new Gruffalo book. She loved that one ever since John had started calling her little mouse.
“Sure. I'll be right back, loves.”
“But you are my sweetheart, Seb.”
“Let's go to our bedroom, okay? More space there and less land lady.”
“Oh, I am not. Sorry that is. I was quite enjoying your…attention…But it’s the morning now and Leanna will soon want to open her gifts.”
There was a smirk on John's face as he rolled to his side and over Sherlock. “Make up sex?” He pressed kisses to Sherlock's neck.
“Hey, I should be the one asking the questions, it’s not me who traveled three weeks in Europe!”
They caught their breath, John's hands in Sherlock's hair again, soft this time.
John was furious. How dare they insinuate they should punish the children for defending themselves!
John and Sherlock had had a three very busy weeks. Lestrade had called them again on a case and they had a lot of chasing around London. Content. Sherlock was content. Cases and his amazing John and wonderful Leanna. What more could he want? Sherlock even kept the sulking to a minimum, Leanna cuddling him on the sofa, John making tea for him, until he felt better.
When John woke up, he was alone in his, no their bed. Sherlock had left. The panic didn’t settle when he saw the message he let him on the night stand.
Upload for Part 2 start on the 19th of July (2 chapters weekly)
“Of course John.”
Sherlock put his violin back into the case. “No need to worry, John.”
“I didn’t let you” Sherlock cut him off, “I couldn’t deal with your emotions… so I did what I know best, closed myself against it, focus on the cases, on facts, clues that can’t be disturbed from an emotional mind.” The detective continued with a soft voice, weak from all the crying.
Tomorrow. He would pack their things and leave tomorrow, so he wouldn't have to see John again. The newly bonded couple would surely appreciate that.
“Carl Powers, John. It’s where I began.”
“What were you thinking, William Sherlock Scott Holmes? Leaving with the Holmes heir. Do you know what kind of rumours are going around about your marriage and our family?”
“Ah.. ehhm. It's like when I call you little lioness. A nickname,” he stuttered, taking the fruit from his daughter so she could climb on the chair again.
“Your little one?”
“Leanna.”
Deep satisfaction. That was the first words that came at his mind to describe how John felt seeing the dead man. He knew anguish and sorrow would come, but now… now he had killed the man who had threaten Sherlock’s life!
Hands shaking, he buried his finger in John's shirt, which was the same he had worn the day of their kiss.
“John…it’s Barts access card…What?” Sherlock asked disbelievingly looking at it.
“Did I get it all right?”
“Nope, you definitely come! Besides I didn’t think of pre-eclampsia with the pregnant women beta yesterday, you saved the day and I owe you a drink! Come on; don’t say otherwise, you know I can be insufferable if you don’t do what I want!”
“John, his children, Leanna, Sarah, they will not be hurt. You can end me, but they will live in peace.” He took Jim's hand to find his fingers brushing against glass.
John took a deep breath, “…Sorry, you’re right. I don’t want to yell at you. Just… I am not good with…doing nothing…”
He was preparing his tea when a deep voice interrupted him. “You can’t sleep John?”
A flash of light, the blindfold being removed, John could see the face of the eldest of the brothers. The man was clearly very pleased with himself. Not a inch of worry on this face. What the hell?
“I'm pleased to see you too, Mummy.”
“Wasn’t it? Interesting.“
She was still the alpha dominant, she would make Sherlock come back and if he was hurt while doing it, he would survive. After all, she had, and he was her son.
“Okay…”
“I am serious, John. I suspected…hoped it would be good…but it was so much more …You were in me, you, my alpha, my partner…” Sherlock hide his face in John’s neck, as if talking about his emotions and looking at John at the same time were too much.
“I have told you about the article. It is not very common for two Alphas to love each other, that's why I have been hiding as a Beta, as you know. After the article Daddy has experienced people judging us. That makes him sad. And angry. He cares about what people think and he doesn’t want them to think we are...strange.”
“No, I don't think so. You will have to ask Harriet about that, when you see her again.”
“Sherlock, bed, please!” John found standing up really hard and he wanted, desperately now, to feel the tall man against him without any clothes in the way.
Sherlock seemed to share the same idea because John soon found himself on the bed, naked.
Leanna watched him as he joned aunty Harry's and Papa's discussion, but her attention quickly moved back to her play. Sarah and Molly were very good at playing and following instruction, all Leanna’s shyness and apprehension disappeared completely.
The bathroom door opened and Sherlock exited, wearing nothing more than his over expensive dressing gown. John almost gaped.
There was something he had never heard in his big brother’s voice. Sentiment.
He ignored the thought. Right now he was a child mourning for the loss of a parent and it didn’t matter how difficult his relationship with his father had been, especially over the last few years. Death was always harder for those who had to live on.
He was still chuckling when Sherlock came back. Well, maybe there was hope after all. Society may be ready to accept what he and Sherlock had. There were many positives comments on his blog lately, maybe he should concentrate more on them than the few angry ones.
Not helpful. SH
Poison.
And to see he was still able to make Sherlock blush… well it made wonders to his ego and… his lower parts was becoming interested in the conversation.
Sherlock smiled at her, pressing a kiss to her cheek. “Sorry, Mrs. Hudson, but they smell amazing and I had to test the quality.”
“Molly? You saw Molly? She had talked about Sherlock? What did she say?” John suddenly came back to life.
“We’re in the middle of London. I wouldn’t call this fresh air.” John smirked, holding the door open for Sarah and she got in.
“Objectively. You utter cock. This is about Leanna and how much she loves you, needs you. You are not leaving her behind.”
They finally met :D
“Just… John… You associate your alpha persona with topping… You feel it’s who you are and I have no problem with that. At all. I promise. And I know you don’t think less of me because I like feeling you inside me, but… I think…subconsciously… you feel like you need to reaffirm your position as an alpha by asking me to submit to you outside of the bedroom…”
Since their failure at penetrative intercourse, Sherlock’s choice of words, and damn, it shouldn’t sound so arousing when he said that! Since John tried bottoming, they had made love of course (thank god for that!)  At first John exclusively topped, they definitely both loved it, but after a few times, they had decided to try and introduce John to the joy of bottoming little by little. Help his inner alpha to accept being on the receiving end, help his body to catch up with his mind… or maybe it was the reverse? John didn’t really know if his previous panic attack was because his alpha felt… Threatened? Or if it was his own mental block as a leading alpha in the army which he needed to break down.
John sighed in relief. “Good. That’s good. I need to stay here, with Sarah. She needs me, my scent. It’s… the fight is not over yet. Something could still go wrong.”
John suddenly found himself on an isolated beach. Behind him a green and luxurious forest, in front of him, nothing but sea. No trace of human life. John paced a bit and quickly realized it was an island. He had no mobile phone, no way to contact Sherlock. John felt anxious, he was panicking. How will he be able to get out of here?
Yes. Sherlock wanted to do exactly that, go with John. It was the most rational decision. His family would realise he was in London and look for him in the hotels first. Less risk of finding them with the former army doctor. And little Leanna would be protected by two alphas. Perfect hiding place.
Exasperated, Sherlock made them roll on their sides, took John’s left hand and guided it to his bottom. John felt all air leave his lungs. Sherlock’s hole was loose and wet with lube.
“Kept scratching it. Obviously irritating him, and bleeding. Why? Because he’d recently had a booster jab. Hep-B, probably. Difficult to tell at that distance. Conclusion: he’d just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia. Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance and she splits it with Janus Cars.”
“No?”
“Good? It’s not good, John!” The ex-soldier felt his heart stop at Sherlock’s exclamation. “It’s extraordinary, John! The most gorgeous thing I ever saw! You were beautiful John, and so powerful, even when you are at your most vulnerable! I made you like that? Do you think you could do it again? Was it the prostate’s or nipple’s stimulation that did it? Or both? JOHN! We have to experiment how sensitive you are exactly!”
“Yes, love?” He could barely hear John through the door and with the water running.
That seemed to shut the detective long enough to enable him to do it.
Harry greeted  them enthusiastically, “John! I'm so happy you’re here! And you mister, must be Sherlock! And wow, John you didn’t exaggerate about those cheekbones!”
“Yes!!! I am going to get my things!” And Sherlock bolted before John could add anything more.
He recognised the magnetic stone immediately, but he was surprised by the beautiful changes John had made to it. Well, the jeweller, not John. Now on a simple but elegant leather band, the head of a lioness had been carved into the stone.
The door to 221 opened and the two curly-heads stepped out. Sherlock gestured them to join them on the pavement, opening the door.
“I am not sure, it’s just a guess… I would prefer to be wrong but… I fear… I fear Sarah’s been kidnapped.” Sherlock finally exhaled.
“Well, I'm a soldier. I take orders.” They giggled again and then John's grabbed handful of Sherlock's arse and they both moaned, as the movement brought their cocks together. Sherlock's knees went weak. This felt more intimate than days of coitus with Janine had ever ever had. The doctor braced his knees and they both started rocking their hips in a slow rhythm.
“God, fresh air.” Sarah leaned her head back so she could feel the sun on her skin.
“Mycroft! You will have to speak to your brother! And make him see reason! It will affect you too, you have a promising career in the government, don’t let him jeopardise your chance!”
“Pity. Moriarty told me you've been lusting after him for weeks. He has someone else now, Sherlock. Bet they are already fucking like rabbits.”
Sherlock didn’t even look at her, just waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. She chuckled and walked away.
Sherlock had went rigid beside him before going back to his mother.
“Nice vocabulary, Dr Watson, you should be a writer!”
So he went on, not stopping John from avoiding the topic. Sherlock knew John constantly thought about it, trying to process the fact that he would be a father in less than nine months and he also knew that he, as a boyfriend, should try to help him, at least listen to him. But John didn't talk, there was nothing to listen to. So Sherlock tried to support him in the only way he could. He avoided sulking, he cleaned up after his experiments (at least most times) and he told Leanna that John needed a lot of cuddles.
But it was just wishful thinking on his part.
Whatever, Sherlock was covering his body and it was bliss! The weight of his body on him, feeling his engorged cock, rutting against him, knowing HE was the reason for Sherlock’s increased libido… well he was definitely aroused and very much not panicking, it was perfect!
“Yes! Good idea! I’m sure Sherlock and Molly will have good ideas… Maybe Leanna could participate too? She is the big sister, she should be able to give her opinion…”
The pack. Not my pack. Sherlock and Leanna were John's pack now.
John took the paper Molly presented him with shaking hands, there were two columns, one for boys and one for girls. Leon, Lana, Martial, Magery, Martin those were just a few names he could read before his own eyes became misty and he couldn’t read anymore.
Sherlock smiled around the Doctor's cock, sucking again and then starting to move up and down the shaft in the same rhythm John's hips moved shallowly, just giving him impulses.
John  paused. He was impressed by Molly capacity to care. If it were him, if Sherlock had been the one kidnapped, he would be out of his mind with worry and don’t give a fuck about how other people in his life cope with it.
Shit. John’s internally screamed in his head. His idea to keep Sherlock out of any dark thoughts had come back to bite him.
“Okay you won, but if Leanna asks me if Santa is real, I won’t lie to her…”
“You make the most wonderful noises, love.” John praised, he had learnt Sherlock’s weakness to compliments, and indeed, the blush increased, his chest became a lovely shade of pink. Thank god for their soundproof bedroom!
“Feelings? For me ?” John’s heart had nearly stopped at Sherlock’s little speech and was now about to jump out of his chest.
“Good! I had to ask. Especially after you and Sherlock questioned me about my job and Clara!”
Sherlock went to the receptionist, Karen, the omega nurse who had been the first to defend him months ago when he had begun the job was here. He could see a flash of fear in her eyes when she saw them. He felt compelled to reassure her.
“I…I couldn’t tell you. You had your own problems…”
Talking about Sarah had been curiously easier after. Harry had been a little miffed he hadn’t told her about the forced heat earlier, but she understood his reason. She was sorry such a thing happened to them, John felt unbelievably relieved when his sister didn’t consider him irresponsible or a bad because he wanted to stay with Sherlock and Leanna.
Nope, too soon to let Sherlock try anything involving his ass, but John was nothing if knowledgeable and creative. He encouraged Sherlock to get behind him, on their right side so that his shoulder wouldn’t bear too much weight. John sent his dominant hand in a mission: find Sherlock’s cock and put it between his thighs.
Some cute weather watching in 221B
“Do you want tea?”
“Yes, with Papa and Nanna. Papa chose the mold, I help to mix and I made the colours!” Leanna explained proudly.
“I know Sarah, I know you didn’t trick me. Could the suppressants be defective?
“Sherlock…my love, my heart, what did I tell you in your dream?” John coaxed.
“John, are you alright?” Sherlock put a protective arm around John’s shoulder, sheltering him from any prying eyes.
It had been a sweet hell, to get to watch his strong and beautiful man in nothing more than a swimsuit… But Leanna was a very good distractor and he had successfully not embarrassed himself in this very public swimming pool…
John looked at her, hesitated and …
Two famous british actors known for being and playing strong alpha lead roles in movies were sitting in what seemed to be a talk show setting. John didn’t understand immediately. He was a little slow sometimes.
The detective closed his eyes, looking at the shoes in his mind palace. He has every detail saved there.
There weren’t many other words after that. Their mouths much more interested in knowing each other intimately.
Sherlock couldn't keep himself from spouting out some deductions, but luckily there was a sick child to focus on. Not that he usually cared about what people thought. John Watson was different, something was hiding behind those ridiculous jumpers. A protective alpha and a man desperate to help at the same time. On instinct, he trusted this doctor with his daughter's life.
“Of course, which one do you want to open first?”
Sherlock beat him to answer Molly’s question, “He is the madman who manipulated John and Sarah into sharing a heat in order to make me go back to Janine. I’ve been looking for him for months without success… I am sorry… I am so sorry Molly… John… If I had been cleverer… I should have thought he would try to get back to me for exposing him and his black network…”
Leanna lifted her head, kissing his cheek. She laid back down on the mattress. “You should talk to Daddy. He feels better when you do. I always feel better.” In moments like these, Leanna seemed so much older than she actually was, so much wiser.
“I love you, little lioness,” he whispered and kissed her cheek.
“Yes” Sherlock closed his eyes and let John pet his head.
“Harry?” John released her quickly. “Are you okay? Forget that, why the fuck would you follow me like that? I could have seriously hurt you!”
“John!” Sherlock panted, “I am … I am going to…”
Sherlock blushed, listening as John sang his praise to everyone.
Sherlock, who had just changed into his pyjamas and was currently putting on his dressing gown for when he would join John in the living room later, braised himself for what would come next. God, his little girl was way too clever for her own good.
“Ah, John. Sarah’s bag and keys are still here, she was definitely taken from here unexpectedly. There is nothing more here for me. I need more data. I found who was present when Sarah was working yesterday. I checked the cameras; she disappeared from all the videos at 5pm. Maybe the doctor or patients who were there at the same time saw something. The kidnapper must have created a diversion to be able to take Sarah without anyone noticing anything… Ah here, let’s begin with this one!” And Sherlock quickly got up, trusting John to follow.
“Yesh!”
“What do you need, birthday boy. Tell me.” Blushing, which was strange because he had been the one to make a list of sex position, Sherlock closed his eyes for a second.
“I am sorry, I should have explained after, apologies…”
“Agreed.”
Working on this was so much fun :D
John smiled at him, as Leanna began throwing the snippets into the air like confetti.
“John!” He exclaimed, “You mean it! But how? It’s forbid… Oh! Mycroft! Mycroft told you it would soon be possible for same second gender people to marry each other! Too many people coming out in the past years for the government to ignore it! I should have deduce it sooner!”
Sherlock ended the call, wrapping his arms around John and kissing his hair. “She’s alive. She… we can go see her now.”
“Uncle My said, Moriarty do something bad again. That's why Papa and Daddy are upset.”
“Amazing, as usual. Yes, you’re right. The lady was suspicious of me because Leanna told her I wasn’t her father but her John. And I realised I couldn’t prove my relation to her. She could have called the police and the social service could have been involved next and it could have been very difficult for us. Our relationship could have become public then, and god knows what it would mean for Leanna…”
“What about her?”
John’s face was full of pain, but now there was hope again.
This chapter was completely written by ember88. Leave her some love <3
“It’s not important,” Violet interrupted, “I will talk to you later about what I want you to do about Sherlock's little rebellion.”
mentions of sexual intercourse :D
“I want to taste you.”
“…yeah… Well. You said all of it, I think. John, I want to keep the baby but I don’t expect anything from you. I know you are with Sherlock, I won’t become a threat to your relationship. I just want to be honest, I tell you.”
“Yes.” John blurted, “That…hmm, that would be… good” God, he wasn’t more eloquent than Sherlock when overwhelmed by his feelings.
A clumsy kiss shared between moans and sighs, as they slid against each other, the tip of John's cock bumping against Sherlock's shaft over and over again. God, he wanted to do this forever, arousal building inside of him almost painfully slow. It took all that he had in him to stop. He kissed John's shoulder, the scar.
Sherlock talked about their last case and John praised him and held his hand on the table.
Oh. Well. John couldn’t honestly get angry now. He was just disappointed… After all the preparation with Angelo, he would have to reschedule.
“Good idea. I’ll ask her. I love you.”
“We know all that, Dr Mirakian, we are doctors too.” John responded a little annoyed, “What advices do you have to increase our chance to conduct this pregnancy at terms?”
Sherlock looked at John, who seemed a bit lost and then walked up to the victim's wife. There was something off about her, even as she cried and pleaded with Donavan to please find her husband.
“Sorry”
Oooh devious Ms Hudson! She was very good, he shouldn’t have believed for one second she would let it pass when he had rebuff her a few days ago about the mistletoe.
He was infuriated by all this… Why couldn’t Sherlock  understand him? It wasn’t overbearing to ask him to be more careful! How dare Sherlock insinuate that John wanted to control him! He let the man do whatever he pleased in the kitchen for his experiments, cleaned up without a complaint…most of the time… And he always trusted Sherlock on a case, let him lead! How could Sherlock think his reprimands were unjustified?
Half an hour later John was back on his feet, cooking dinner. Mrs. Hudson came up and they ate together. His former life with Janine had lacked this kind of comfortable domesticity and simple fun. Life at Baker Street felt cosy and familiar, like they had been living here for years rather than the meager six short weeks it had been.
