manuscript would’ve been rejected outright. Even with his reputation, the publishers had still required him to add in a message of hope to the whole thing. There had to be a chance of reconciliation, an open door at the end of the long, dark hallway.
“Boy, didja walk here?”
Castiel was pretty sure Jimmy had no idea exactly how little he was helping diffuse the situation. When Claire got like this, it was always easier to just let her be a tornado than it was to try and reign in her energy. She was a lot like Castiel in that way.
He knew he was still in love with Dean. That thought was what had inspired every single one of his novels so far, and it wasn’t a stretch to believe that Dean’s touch would still have that effect on him. What confused him was the fact that Dean didn’t hate him.
Castiel knew Dean wouldn’t appreciate having him around. They hadn’t really left things on a great note all those years ago, and the few interactions they’d had in the interim had been unpleasant, to say the least.
He told her all about how Cas was back, how Dean felt at the coffee shop the day before, how his heart still skipped a freakin’ beat everytime they made eye contact.
The shop that had gone belly-up just a few years after Dean’s mother had died.
“Where’s Jimmy,”
Bobby had been in Dean’s life for longer than he could remember. Bobby’s wheelchair had been a part of Bobby’s life since before Dean was born.
Cas nodded, a slight dip of his head.
He remembered Baby. Everyone remembered Baby. The classic Impala was pretty hard to forget, and Dean made it even harder by taking such great care of her. She shined under the snow, her glossy black paint almost mirror-like in its perfect condition.
“Maybe you should tell her outright, man,”
Cas didn’t even spare him a glance as he sat down, holding himself stiffly upright in his chair. Dean noticed that it seemed like Cas was doing his damnedest to not accidentally brush up against Dean, despite the close quarters the table provided.
Dean sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
haven't lived in kansas since I was a kid. anyways, this chapter's shorter than usual because I got a promotion at work and haven't had as much time to write. originally, I was gonna combine this chapter and the concept for the next one into one massive chapter, but at this point, i don't have time.
He took a deep breath and rubbed and his eyes. There was a strange wetness that he realized a few moments later was the blood from his thumb.
Dean seemed to choke on his words, although it was difficult for Castiel to be sure over the phone.
Without turning to look at Cas, he whispered, “Hey, be honest with me… Is Jimmy okay? I’m worried about him,”
The water clinging to his skin froze immediately in the cold air. Cas stood before him, a mixture of terror and panic and anger warring on his face. He didn’t say anything, just pulled a flare out of his chest pocket, loaded it into the flare gun, and fired it high into the sky.
“Okay, I’ll go with you,”
That being said, chapter four probably won't be updated on Monday (02/01/2021), and I'm sorry for that. Mondays will probably remain my usual upload days, because I write most of my chapters on Sunday nights, but I'm going to have to hold off on confirming that for sure.
Still, it didn’t make the walk any less uncomfortable. This was the closest to
It was also where Dean had kissed Cas for the first time, all those years ago.
“I’d say you probably wouldn’t want to go out behind the wheel, huh?”
A draft breezed in through the corner of the kitchen door where the liner was cracked. He made a mental note to let Jimmy know when he got back. Because he was coming back later. When he got back from his business trip. The trip he’d forgotten to tell Castiel about. Of course.
His voice had sounded desperate, even to him.
“Sorry, Cas, I forgot about your whole… thing,”
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyes were the worst part. Even in the dim reflection, he could see how the worry weighed on his brows, dragging them down into a pathetic expression of fear.
“Fine,”
“Alright, man, I’ll see ya tomorrow then,”
“I highly doubt that,”
Of course, I'm going to do my best to maintain my schedule, and I'll actually start having real weekends again starting this week (I haven't had more than 32 hours off consecutively in almost three months), but please give me some time to figure out my new writing schedule.
“Hey, speaking of Jimmy… where is he?”
Shrugging the thoughts away, he continued to methodically stab his way through the icy mud, cursing under his breath every time he so much as thought he lost his balance. Hard work, indeed.
Dean felt a little relief at those words, glad he didn’t have to fight Cas over it.
“Bobby, I’m gonna get lunch from the diner. Want anything?”
Almost.
Someone cleared their throat.
“No, they haven’t. How about you do the honors?” He lifted an eyebrow at her, knowing she wouldn’t be able to see the smirk behind his scarf.
Off-handedly, he found himself deliberating over their current situation. In the span of a few days, Dean had gone from his ex-boyfriend whom he’d left behind on the dance floor, kneeling with a ring in his hand, to the man driving him to search for his missing brother. Castiel was thrown off by how natural it felt, just being in Dean’s presence. The strangeness of their estrangement should not have been solved by a few measly jokes, some forced camaraderie, and a missing persons case, but here they were. Side by side in the car Castiel had practically spent half his childhood and most of his teen years in, listening to the same tapes he’d listened to as a kid. Dean’s thumbs tapped on the steering wheel, more in a nervous tic than any attempt to match the song’s drum beat. He wasn’t even close to being correct about the rhythm.
Still, there were plenty of people of people who looked up to the public image of kindness and goodness that Michael and Naomi had peddled in their lifetimes. Castiel was pretty sure he brought the flowers for those people. The ones who needed to believe that true kindness existed outside of fairy tales and bedtime stories.
He was a little sad to be the only one here today, sad that Jimmy had opted to prepare for his meeting later that night with Dean instead of coming to their parents’ grave. Sad that Claire had gone on vacation instead of tagging along.
“Yeah, you do that,”
Dean was halfway through debating whether he could fake an emergency to get out of the meeting when Cas showed up, stupid trench coat billowing in the breeze on his way in, snowflakes stuck in his dark hair. His cheeks were pink from the cold, and his eyes were bright, glittering in the artificial light of the community center.
An hour later, and less than a hundred feet away from the front door of their house, Jimmy stopped short.
She rolled her eyes, her lower lip pouted out in an almost pitiful display.
“Then maybe it’s time to try to move on. Closure or whatever,”
Castiel didn’t deserve that. He had no right to expect Dean to listen to his worries, his concerns over his brother’s whereabouts.
“I get it. Or at least, I think I get it. Still,” she pulled off a particularly large chip of paint, “I know how much the two of you meant to each other. I remember what it was like before the two of you split,” her eyes were focused on her nails. A little too focused, as if she were trying to avoid making eye contact with Dean at all costs.
Dean wasn’t quite sure what had spurred the change in their dynamic. Maybe nothing really had changed. Even after everything Cas had put him through, he’d never wanted to lose him. Never wanted a life where Cas wasn’t a part of it.
Castiel had said no.
Dean did a very, very good job of not rolling his eyes.
Dean placed the phone is Castiel’s hand. It felt like a cold lump. Castiel pressed the power button, more on instinct than anything else. There was no way it had survived its trip down the river, even if the weather proof case it was sporting seemed undamaged.
Mercifully, the house came into view, and Castiel was saved from having to respond. Claire had the car door thrown open before Castiel had even slid the car into park, an action that nearly gave him a heart attack.
There was no response.
She had died when Dean was ten. Sammy had been six.
He watched as Jimmy bit back words that rested on the tip of his tongue.
He made his way back into the kitchen, absentmindedly counting floral arrangements as he passed them.
Cas extended a hand for a handshake.
He and Dean had talked. It had been awkward.
Dean was pretty sure Jimmy hadn’t just asked for help. Jimmy continued without hesitation.
Butterflies fluttered through Dean veins when Cas said his name. Actual fucking butterflies.
“Duh,”
“I know, bud, it’s not ideal. But you want to check everywhere, right?”
Dean’s irritation began to melt into sympathy. He didn’t have kids of his own, but he had basically raised Sammy after their mother had died. He understood.
The loveseat was smaller than Dean had initially realized, and he cursed himself internally for not opting to sit in a larger chair. Cas’ oversized trenchcoat was brushing Dean’s leg, sending sparks straight to the base of his spine.
“I think,” He began hesitantly, “That the town would probably enjoy a fireworks display,”
“Well,” Bobby said gruffly, “I’ll let you two lovebirds get at it,”
Trips to Lawrence weren’t usually this bad.
Charlie huffed.
Castiel still remembered the look on Dean’s face when he’d said no. How his eyes had fallen, his hand with the ring in it drooping. It haunted Castiel’s nightmares to this day.
Dean couldn’t argue with them. How was Cas supposed to call him if he didn’t know what Dean’s schedule was? Hell, did Cas even know his phone number?
The lights overhead seemed to grow brighter in his eyes, the electricity humming in his ears.
Castiel cut him off.
The passenger seat was a cherished memory that very few people got to have. Her interior smelled like leather and sandalwood, combined with the pinewood smell of Dean’s aftershave. Her leather seats were comfortable, soft enough to sleep on if one needed to. Her dashboard was spotless, not a speck of dust in sight.
“It’s important because I’m getting concerned that no one’s seen him since I left him on the pier yesterday?”
Jimmy rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands, taking a calming breath. Before he got the chance to say anything, Claire turned on her heel and stalked off, obviously annoyed at having been yelled at by her father.
He was concerned about Jimmy.
“No kidding. Work’s been slow since we finished up Jimmy’s car the other day. Just a few oil changes and tire pressures that needed checking. Nothin’ much otherwise,”
“Cas?” Came the questioning voice.
So. I got a second job. I now work in two separate covid labs, handling and testing specimens. I have significantly less time to write than I did before. If you give me like... a few weeks I'll be able to manage my schedule better, but for now, please expect chapters to be a day or two late sometimes. I'm not planning on abandoning this fic (I actually really happen to like this one so far) but I am warning you that if you're expecting me to consistently update on the same day, it may not work out like that.
Dean sighed, exasperation lacing his breath. Damn Novaks.
“Well, you should’ve thought of that before you wait ‘til the last minute to pack!”
“Dean, you and Cas can handle your property, right?” Jody’s voice gave him something to concentrate on, but he was still too distracted to process the fact that she’d paired him and Dean up.
It wasn’t a far walk, maybe a mile or so, but they stretched it out as much as they could.
She had been a kind woman, from what he could remember. Sarcastic, funny, sweet. A little prone to losing her temper, but quick to apologize.
He hadn’t stopped thinking about it since he saw Castiel laying in a hospital bed in the aftermath of the accident.
They needed a communication method.
As he’d sped off, Castiel had made his way into the house, the worry stone pinched in his hand.
If he could survive Michael’s sermons about how he was going to hell for his sexual inclinations, he could survive a short drive to Jimmy’s home.
With a sigh, he leaned the driver’s seat as far back as it would go and pushed his ear plugs into his ears until they were just short of hurting. Heaving his arm up to cover his face, he squeezed his eyes shut tight and let the feeling wash over him.
Another long squeeze.
Castiel began slinking towards his room, hoping to avoid getting caught in the middle of whatever was going on. He wasn’t an expert on human behavior, but he was pretty sure they were actually fighting about more than just Claire’s packing.
. In the book, the jilted couple reunited and lived happily ever after. That wasn’t happening between him and Dean. Jensen got the girl in the end. Castiel did not get the boy.
And that was it. The segue his brain was looking for.
Jody and Dean retrieved their orders.
“Fine,” he suppressed a groan at the teasing he knew was coming, “I’ll buy the damn book,”
Castiel wished he knew where the lilies came from.
Before Dean could stop himself, he was on his feet.
“You were saying something?”
She’d attached a blurry shot of Dean from a low angle, obviously taken without his knowledge. In the photo, he’d been just as beautiful as ever, with his hands wrapped awkwardly around a small green item. Castiel’s new book. He was smiling, the small smile Castiel knew he reserved for the people who he truly cared about. Castiel’s heart warmed as he realized that meant Dean truly cared about Claire. He was glad the girl had people looking out for her, especially people as loyal as Dean. She had a habit of getting into trouble, and she could use every ally she could find. Dean had always doted on her when she was younger, and Castiel was glad that he still cared enough about her despite the fact that they were no longer together.
It was a chilly day outside, colder than he had thought it would be when he left. Still, it beat the cramped closet of a breakroom at Bobby’s shop. He tightened his scarf around his neck and pulled his gloves more firmly onto his hands as he sat down at a worn-down picnic table tucked behind the restrooms. The spot was the best one for days like this, with the building providing a buffer from the icy breeze. Still, it afforded him a direct view of the cemetery, and the sight depressed him a little.
Dean had never told Cas that he had been the one to do the work on his parents’ car before they had gotten in the accident. He’d never told him about how they had brought it in for some routine maintenance, an oil change and some new brake lines and pads. He hadn’t thought much about it, just did the repairs and sent them on their way.
“Stop that,” His voice was gentle but commanding all the same.
Dean should’ve known better. Bobby never said please.
“No, I want to see it myself,”
She ignored him.
He was so distracted by the sensation of everything, the overwhelming nature of his brain in meltdown mode that he almost missed the phone call. As it was, he was barely able to hit the ANSWER button on his phone screen.
Beside him, Castiel rubbed his hand absently at the junction of his wrist and forearm where his graft scars were. It was a nervous tic he had developed a few weeks after his car accident, and he only did it when he was getting overwhelmed.
Without another word, Jimmy went inside, leaving Castiel alone with his thoughts.
“That’s bullshit. It’s not Dean you’re worried about, it’s yourself,” She paused for a second, chewing over her next few words, “Besides, you’re the one who hurt him in the first place,”
He unloaded onto her for a while.
That wasn’t what Castiel had been expecting him to say.
Castiel regretted the text as soon as he sent it. He had no right to just ask Dean for a ride home, let alone to expect him to agree to it over a medium as rude as a text. His heart had hammered in his chest until Dean had reappeared in the doorway, a lopsided smile on his face.
“Okay, now the other one,” They repeated the process.
“Then how’d he get to Kansas City?”
His ex-boyfriend-slash-ex-bestfriend usually made an appearance in town around this time of year. Dean only ever knew about it from the local papers.
“You actually gonna read it this time?”
“Yeah, well, let’s get this thing on the road,”
Sometimes, being autistic fucking sucked.
“You’re not the only mechanic around, you know. I can ask any of them to do this for me,”
“Now, hold on,” He reached out to grab her arm, narrowly snagging the edge of her sleeve cuff, “Have Cas come over here. He needs to say hi. Politeness and all that,”
Dean immediately felt guilty. Eileen was insistent that their child be able to sign with both parents, and with its uncle. It was a totally fair thing for her to ask for, and Dean was doing his best to comply with the request, as was Sam. Still, language just wasn’t something he was good at. What only took Sam twenty minutes to learn could sometimes take Dean a full day. Still, he was trying. He just… needed a little more time.
The downside of living in a small town? Everyone knew your business. Everyone knew when to send condolence flowers and anniversary wishes.
“Gettin’ cocky, boy,”
It was incredibly difficult to not call Jimmy an idiot.
Castiel frowned at him.
The coffee cut through the cold in his body, but couldn’t shake the shivery feeling rocking through him every time his thoughts returned to Jimmy.
He watched the trio as they progressed through the rows of headstones, vases and floral arrangements clutched in their hands. Even from where Dean sat, he could see the furrow in Cas’ brow, the way his eyes squinted like they did when he was lost in thought. Knowing him, he probably was lost in thought. Pensive, adorable bastard.
“Wow, Cas,” The words blurted out before Dean could stop himself, “Sufficient. Handy. You tryin’ to write my resume over there?”
“Is, uh… Is Jimmy around?”
The air between them was tentative, fragile. There was hope there, though. It was resting between them like a gift, one that both of them were too scared to open. Both of them hoping the other would open it first.
Dean held out a hand and helped Cas up. When Cas didn’t make a move to unsnap the shoulder straps holding the waders up, Dean did it for him. The waders pooled around Cas’ ankles. He still didn’t move.
“Why, yes, Sammy, I do happen to think murdering a bunch of people because of one idiot’s harebrained idea is a little overdramatic, thank you for noticing,”
He couldn’t even read the dedication page, too terrified of the names he’d see written there. Would Cas have a new boyfriend he’d written the story for? He wrote romances, after all. That’s all Dean knew, though. Was there someone out there he’d be writing those love stories for?
“Look, Cas, what I’m trying to say is this: you broke things off with your best friend after he proposed to you, and then never spoke to him again. At least, not for longer than thirty seconds,” He clarified when he Castiel started to interrupt him, “The two of you were attached at the hip for your entire lives. Everyone in town was convinced you would be just like that until you were both buried in the ground. You don’t talk about what happened to anyone outside of saying ‘He proposed and I said turned him down’. The first time I got details was when I read
He grabbed Jimmy’s rental car keys off the hook near the door and shrugged on his overcoat. Its thin canvas material wasn’t exactly enough to block out the Midwest winter wind, but it was better than nothing. He knew he should really invest in some better winter gear, but if he was only spending two weeks out of the year here and the rest in Los Angeles, it really wasn’t worth it to splurge.
Jimmy stared at him, irritation evident in his face. Dean’s body felt like a live wire, ready to set something ablaze at any moment.
Jimmy walked up and down the pier, pointing out ideas to Dean about how they could best monopolize the space. He wanted boats lined up on the water and anchored down so they couldn’t be pulled away, and he wanted to shoot the fireworks off from a hill in the distance about a mile upstream. Dean couldn’t deny that the river would be the best place for a view if that was the shooting point, but he still knew it was a damned stupid idea.
If Cas responded, Dean didn’t see it. He was too busy counting the flecks of mud on the floor, trying desperately to think about anything other than the fact that his ex-boyfriend was about to expose himself.
“Did you hear me?”
Castiel knew if he opened the glove compartment, he’d find a cardboard box full of Dean’s old mixtapes.
Her father, Jimmy, was a nice guy. That was really the only word Dean had to describe him. Nice. Even though he and Cas were identical in appearance – technically – they couldn’t have been more different in mannerisms. Where Cas was awkward and nerdy and weird, Jimmy was just average. An average guy with an average life and an average job. The most exciting thing to ever happen to him was Claire. How someone like Jimmy, the salesman whose most interesting feature was his relation to Cas, managed to produce Claire, the girl who accidentally burned down a barn last summer while trying to hotwire an old car, Dean would never know.
Even in his current state, Castiel didn’t have to think too hard to realize that that’s probably what she was calling about.
This wasn’t the distraction Castiel had been hoping for.
When he finally got home, Dean beelined it for his bedroom, stripping out of his winter gear on the way in and discarding it as he walked. The book in his hands felt like it grew heavier the closer he got to his bedroom.
“I don’t know how to help you, Dean”
“Look, Dean, I trust you with the car. Please don’t ruin the surprise, but I’m planning to pass it off to Claire pretty soon here, just as soon as I get myself a new one,” Dean didn’t have to see Jimmy’s face to know he was smiling, that signature Novak twinkle in his eye. All of them had it. Claire, Cas, Jimmy. That little mischievous sparkle that sucked you in and made you want to help them with their crazy schemes.
Jimmy laughed, nothing more than a huff of air with almost no amusement.
One minute.
about overdramatic love confessions, but he pushed on.
Cas considered that for a moment. Dean watched as his eyebrows knit together and his lips pursed in concentration, before the look cleared and Cas spoke again.
Castiel rubbed at the skin on his hands where Jimmy had just touched. He hated being touched. It always made it feel like there were miniature fireworks under his skin, like little ants were trailing the touch all the way up into his spine.
Cas squeezed his hand in rapid succession, three quick pulses. He did remember. Their secret childhood code. Three short squeezes for yes, one long one for no.
Dean didn’t miss the flash of worry in Cas’ eyes.
“Does it need to be Jimmy who signs?”
Mary Winchester had died when Dean was a child, just four years old. His brother, Sammy, had been no more than a baby. It had been a freak accident. At least, that’s how the firefighter captain had described it: a freak accident. A live wire sparked at just the wrong time and Mary Winchester had gone up in smoke.
“Stupid, actually,” Dean didn’t turn to see how Cas took his words.
about being stuck here.
He sighed shakily, switching off his phone and taking a sip of his unknown drink.
Chuck Shurley, washed-up-romance-novelist turned town drunk and owner of the local bookstore, had gotten it into his head one night that he wanted to get a better view of the moon. Connect with his muse, or some stupid mumbo jumbo like that. Dean was pretty sure he just tossed back a few too many rum-and-cokes. He had stolen a canoe from one of his neighbors and paddled it onto the river, attempting to find that perfect angle for viewing when his canoe flipped, sending his under water.
Stories were easier to understand. They had moving parts that locked and fit together perfectly, a puzzle where each narrative device added a piece. When you were done, you could go back to the beginning and appreciate the whole structure for what it was.
“I know he was planning on giving the car to Claire sometime soon. Maybe you could convince him it would be best for her safety?”
Jimmy pressed on.
Dean glanced around the shop, pointedly looking at the lack of a line for orders.
“No, I walked,”
“That makes sense,” Cas’ voice betrayed nothing of his emotions. Dean had never seen someone with such a good poker face. The man was made of stone, as far as he was concerned. At least, he was made of stone when he wanted to be. It made Dean sad to realize that Cas was probably purposely keeping those walls up. He missed the old Cas, the one he’d know his whole life. Warm, funny, and dorky as all hell. Not the intimidating mask of a man standing before him now.
He couldn’t see much through the layers of scarves and hats and jackets, but from what he could see, he looked terrible. Unsurprisingly, after the sleepless night he’d had. Nightmares of rivers and drowning had plagued him for hours, and he’d tossed and turned in bed until the sun rose.
He shook his head, as if he could dislodge the thoughts from his brain. He needed a distraction.
Or worse, the young man he had been when Dean had fallen in love with him.
leather jacket! The one with the patches all over it!”
Jimmy didn’t look at him. Instead, his eyes focused on the reflection of the moon on the water.
“Because,” Jimmy’s excitement was palpable through the phone, “I want to take boat tours out onto the river, and I need your help getting them set up. There’s a whole set of old rowing boats from the high school that I want to get set up with motors so people can steer themselves, and I th-“
Bobby wheeled around the corner, and laughed when he saw the mess Dean had made.
Dean didn’t miss the way Cas’ eyes drifted to him when he said that.
Dean knew that regardless of what Bobby asked for, Dean would also have to pick up something warm for him. Chicken soup and some coffee, maybe? Anything other than the swill he kept by the shop coffee machine.
Bobby scoffed, and Dean was pretty sure he heard the old man call him an idiot under his breath as he walked away, but he couldn’t say for certain.
“Thank you, Dean. I promise I’ll text next time,”
Dean wasn’t sure what Jimmy wasn’t understanding. It wasn’t a pay thing or a skill level thing. It was a safety thing. There was no way in hell he’d set up a series of death traps on an icy river. It wasn’t happening.
Cas continued, “If you wanted help with the committee, Dean would be a sufficient choice. Very handy,”
Jimmy wasn’t home when Castiel woke up.
“What? You said you wanted sweet,” Charlie’s voice was all sugar.
“Yeah, I’m sure. I’ll be fine. Go home, I’ll see you tomorrow,”
So why was he early?
Dean knew what was coming next before it happened.
Bobby eyed the plug with a look of disdain.
Dean was filthy, even by mechanic standards. Normally, it wasn’t unusual for him to be absolutely covered in oil and grime, all part of the usual hazards of the job, but today was different. Today, he had gotten completely doused in oil when the drain plug under Ellen’s car had gotten stuck and refused to budge. Even the impact driver hadn’t helped. So he’d spent a solid thirty minutes just working at the plug, trying to get it loose when suddenly, it twisted. It twisted out, and Dean realized it was a lot shorter than a plug should be. Significantly shorter. So short that all it took was one half turn of his socket wrench, and bam. Dirty motor oil right to the face.
“She’s right, you know?” He asked, eyes a thousand miles away.
“So, when you leave, just take a left out of the lot. GPS will tell you to take a right. Don’t listen to it,”
After a moment, Cas nodded. Their hands slowly unclasped.
God must be out to get him or something, because of course Cas would show up when Dean had a grease stain down his face and motor oil in his hair.
Well, almost everyone.
“No,” Dean said quietly. Was that worry in his tone? Castiel wasn’t quite sure. “Is everything okay?”
Claire looked up at him.
He hated being this painfully awkward. What the hell was he supposed to say? How was he supposed to make this less weird? His brain was going a mile a minute in one direction, and completely empty in the other. Dean couldn’t have been faring any better.
What was Dean doing? This was already more than they’d talked in years. Castiel’s heart fluttered in his chest everytime Dean so much as breathed too loud into the phone. They didn’t chat. They didn’t call each other just to talk. They certainly didn’t call each other to
“How many other ‘repairs’ has he done recently?” He knew he sounded cranky, but he was pretty sure Bobby would understand why. A trail of oil leaked down the side of his face, tickling the skin.
He left his bouquet of lies there on the dirt, all twelve of the buds frosted gold in the pale morning sunlight.
He fell asleep on his bed, stripped down to his boxers, with the book held close to his chest.
“You should’ve told me, man. I would’ve picked you up,”
“I don’t know, Mom, I guess I just never realize how much I miss him until I see him again,”
If he hadn’t just minded his own business and stuck to his fucking guns about saying no to Jimmy about the stupid boats.
“How did you know that?” He didn’t even bother trying to lie. He wasn’t very good at it, and he knew Jimmy would see through him in an instant.
“Why is it interesting?”
“So we switched out the suspension system, just the standard shocks, springs, and anti-sway bars. Jimmy didn’t request us to fix anything else, so I left most of it alone, but it looks like something happened to the front right quarter panel. Has he mentioned accidentally hitting something recently? Maybe a fender bender?”
“Yes, it is,” He tried to keep his voice low, though he knew it didn’t matter. The Novaks were too far away to hear him speak over all the din in the coffee shop, “Now can you make something super sweet and sugary. Tons of whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Not too much caffeine,”
Dean was concerned about the depth of the water. He didn’t want to risk getting water in his waders. That was a one-way ticket to hypothermia.
“I got it in this super cool crystal shop. Charlie would’ve loved it. Super new-agey crap,” Dean had said when he’d presented Castiel with the stone.
Dean smirked.
“Did he take his rental with him?”
Claire bounced off, grabbed Cas’ sleeve and dragged him back over to where their little trio was sitting before pushing him lightly into the seat beside Dean. He felt the weight shift the cushions on the loveseat. His hands were shaking, a response he always had when he was near Cas. He wrapped both of them around his coffee mug, hoping to hide his nerves.
Castiel’s ears caught on Jimmy’s name, and it was enough of a jolt to keep him from getting upset over being signed up for a meeting without his knowledge. It was weird that Jimmy hadn’t told him about it, though.
“You know, if you want to read a book, you gotta open it first,” a teasing voice broke through Dean’s focus.
He was only two minutes away from the house, but he had to pull the car off to the side of the road and shut it off. He fumbled the pair of earplugs he kept on hand out of his pocket, and shoved them into his ears.
Normally, it didn’t rock him the way this conversation was currently doing.
“Yeah well, remember that spot behind Rufus’ old booth, the little alcove behind the tree?”
lastly, friendly reminder that I am autistic, and this fic is based off of my personal experiences with autism and its less savory aspects.
“Sorry you had to see that,” Dean’s voice was quiet. Castiel almost jumped. They didn’t do this. They didn’t talk. This wasn’t normal.
He kept digging at the skin around his thumbnail, wincing when he pulled a little too hard at a piece of skin that wasn’t quite ready to come loose yet.
“Check for yourself,” Bobby called from his office.
“Thanks, Jody,”
“I - ,” Cas cut himself off, “Yes, I would agree that that’s the logical outcome of the givens you’ve listed,”
He didn’t know what Cas’ new book was about. Hell, he didn’t know what any of Cas’ books were about. All he knew is that he was going to sit here for the next hour with the book in his hands, too scared to even think about cracking the cover open.
The very few times someone had put up a fuss over the couple, Jody and Donna had shut it down instantly, the latter with kindness and the former with her signature smile and a reminder that she had a badge and a gun, and she wasn’t afraid to use either.
“Yeah, that’d be the logical thing to do, huh?”
As the hours ticked by, and the night grew shorter, Castiel felt his nerves ratcheting up more and more. Every minute that passed was another minute that Jimmy was out of his reach. Castiel could feel his blood pressure getting higher and higher as the moon descended on the sky and the beginnings of dawn creeped at the horizon.
“No, I just – Ugh, Claire, please. Please stay out of my non-relationship with Dean. He’s a good person and I don’t want him to get hurt,”
Jimmy acquiesced, putting his hands up in surrender.
Thanks and love y'all.
In fairness, it had been willed to both of them. Their parents had probably intended for them to sell it and then use the money they made to put down payments on new houses, one for each of them. In practice, though, Castiel hadn’t had it in him to force his brother into following through on that plan. Then, as the years went by, Jimmy just sort of
Dean awkwardly rubbed at the grease splotch.
“I can’t help it, Dad! I’ve gotta find my stuff!”
,” Claire snapped.
Cas gave no indication that he’d heard Dean.
“One,” Dean ticked up a finger, “I’m the best mechanic around. Two,” another finger, “Any mechanic worth his salt will turn you down when he finds out why you wanna do this,”
“Why is that important?”
His parents’ social status in the community hadn’t helped things either. The devoted pastor and his wife. In small-town Kansas, being a man of God carried weight. Being a messenger of God? Even more so.
Dean held his breath as he accepted it.
Dean gaped at his brother.
Now, he was sitting on Dean’s couch, a soft blanket wrapped around his shoulders, wearing Dean’s clothes, cupping a mug of cocoa. Dean had retrieved Castiel’s worry stone from the pocket of his jeans, and it was resting on his knee.
that punctuated his words.
There were a lot of things Dean loved about his house.
“He’s gonna be alright,” Dean tried to soothe him.
It took twenty more minutes, and several more falls from Jimmy before Dean put his foot down and called it.
“Care to elaborate?”
Dean knew his internal bargaining was just a desperate attempt to avoid dealing with his own guilt. He fucking knew it. Didn’t mean he was going to stop begging.
“Oh, come on, Dad, loosen up,”
He sighed, watching as Ellen began conducting the meeting.
Dean wasn’t unused to hard work. Hell, he’d practically grown up a hard worker under his father’s thumb. He still had nightmares about long days spent working side-by-side with John, learning the mechanics of each and every car that came into the family’s shop.
Claire’s voice broke through his thoughts.
“Is that such a bad thing?”
Of course, now that they had to wade into a freezing cold river, with the sun long gone behind the horizon and the stars peeking out overhead, now was the time Cas went nonverbal again. Dean couldn’t blame him. This whole situation had to be incredibly overwhelming. Hell, Dean wasn’t related to Jimmy and he was still freaking the fuck out as it was. He couldn’t imagine what it was like for Cas.
Not until he felt like the skin was melting off of his bones.
He honestly wasn’t sure if he’d ever loved his parents, sometimes.
Cas’ rough voice was even more stilted than normal, an achievement that Dean figured had to be hard to reach.
“Dude, that’s a horrible idea,”
Dean’s heart sank. Cas was going to ask him to build the stupid boats, and Dean wouldn’t be able to say no. How could he say no to Cas?
“Then you should finish saying it,”
She nodded.
Castiel wasn’t quite sure what was
Claire was a whirlwind of destruction, tearing apart organized cabinets and storage bins in her attempts to find the perfect clothes and items to take with her on vacation.
Jimmy slipped almost immediately once he stepped onto the mud. Dean barely caught him by the crook of his arm, setting him back upright as gently and quickly as possible.
Jimmy launched into his elevator pitch.
He had rolled his eyes when his agent had sent him the articles. Luckily, Dean had always been a rather private person, so no reporter had managed to figure it out just yet. All the better. Castiel knew Dean wouldn’t be comfortable with any undue media attention, especially if it had anything to do with the man who had humiliated him publicly and broken his heart.
He grunted at her.
“Of course, it is,” Claire twirled a lock of hair around her finger, “Why else would you write about it,”
When the screen lit up, it caught Castiel off guard, shocked that it still worked. A few long moments passed, and the phone turned on completely.
There was the box of tapes, of course. A handful of old polaroids. Dean and his brother, Sam, Dean and Charlie, Sam and Charlie, Dean with Bobby and Ellen. He stopped short on the last photo. Dean had his arm slung over Castiel’s shoulders, a kiss pressed to Castiel’s cheek. He glanced at Dean, relieved to see the man hadn’t turned to look at him. Castiel shoved the pictures back in the glove box. No point in snooping if you didn’t know you would be comfortable with what you found.
“Yeah, whatever,”
“I’m doing good!” Jimmy hesitated, ever so slightly, “Just about to go pick my brother up from the airport,”
He gave himself two minutes to process the elation, pain, and nerves.
“Yeah, okay, I’ll see you there,”
“I apologize, it seems I didn’t phrase my thoughts properly,” He paused, “I merely meant to say that Dean would be a helpful addition to the committee,”
It wasn’t until Dean was behind the wheel of his car that he finally opted to text Jimmy.
“Ah, that’s what this call’s about,” Dean could hear the quiet smile. Jimmy may have been a very boring person, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t nice. If anything, he was one of the nicest people Dean knew. The complete opposite of Cas’ tendency towards surly hostility. Yeah, Cas and Jimmy were two very different people.
He liked it when it snowed. It reminded him of when he was younger, before the realities of life had caught up to him. When it snowed, he could close his eyes and imagine what it was like as a child, when his mom would wrap him up in a warm scarf and send him outside to play, promising hot chocolates for him and Cas when they got back. The memories were a nice buffer against the cold. They were also a nice thing to focus on when he was trying to avoid thinking about how much shoveling he’d have to do later.
“He’s not,” Castiel knew he sounded terse. It was something he had trouble with, the unspoken way most people seemed to understand how to properly express their feelings. He wasn’t upset with Dean for calling, not annoyed in any way, and yet he knew that his tone probably said otherwise. He just… didn’t quite see the point in trying to make his voice warm, friendly in the way his brother had mastered as a child.
Dean didn’t blame him. He felt the same way.
“Boys, do you have something to add?” Ellen sounded annoyed. Dean shook his head, sheepish.
“Dude, it’s like, one in the afternoon,”
Castiel had spent so much of his life trying – and failing – to be the son his parents had wanted. To be Jimmy. He had failed in every way imaginable. His parents had been pillars of the community’s social hierarchy. He was autistic. His parents had been staunchly devoted Christians. He was a gay atheist. His parents had wanted him to follow them down the path of righteousness. He had become a writer with a slight alcohol problem. The list went on.
“How did you know about that?”
“Hey,”
“Yeah, we’ve got it covered,”
Castiel bit his lip.
The schedule was printed out and pinned to the corkboard in the main shop room, just a simple time table with customer name, vehicle information, and job description. Bobby’s “no frills” attitude towards work extended into his paperwork to an almost annoying degree. The bare bones descriptors often meant Dean had to spend an extended amount of time under the vehicle, figuring out what needed to be done, and calling the vehicle owner to ensure the right parts were installed. He didn’t want to accidentally screw a customer over by giving them work they couldn’t afford.
“Maybe I don’t want help,” Dean groused.
Castiel nodded, eyes trained on his hangnail.
“No, I don’t,”
Castiel’s heart sank in his chest. It was getting harder and harder to deny the fact that Jimmy’s absence was worrying. The longer he was gone, the more concerned Castiel got. He shook the thoughts away.
Dean was being so kind. Kinder than Castiel had deserved. In any other circumstances, he wouldn’t accept what Dean was offering. In all honesty, he wasn’t sure exactly what Dean was offering here. Kindness? Friendship? A shoulder to cry on?
Dean had dropped him off without much more conversation, just a reminder to call him if he needed a ride and a pointed look at Jimmy’s rental car that was past due on its return.
He almost wished he had work to get done, even if he knew he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on anything right now. He usually reserved his trips back to Lawrence for leisure, telling his agent to leave him alone until he got back to his apartment back in California, but now all he wanted was for something to focus on. A meeting to plan, a signing to go to, a manuscript to plot out.
He looked at the joint headstone, shared between his mother and father, Naomi on one side and Michael on the other.
“I’m just saying,” Sam started, “That maybe, you don’t have to lie about finding a compromise. Maybe – I don’t know – go meet up with him down by the pier and at least scope out the area and see if you can come up with a way to meet in the middle,”
Ellen continued talking.
“Sounds like a plan,”
Cas didn’t acknowledge him.
There it was. The verbal acknowledgment of Castiel’s nerves regarding his brother. Castiel shook his head.
got Castiel’s attention. He snapped his gaze to his brother.
His mind went in circles like that while Jimmy talked, the more romantic side of his brain warring with the much more logical mechanic side.
“Hey, remember when we were kids?” Dean risked a glance in Cas’ direction, “How we’d always say we were gonna skip the parade?”
Bobby didn’t have to use it all the time, a fact that left some people confused and others angry.
“I…,” He paused, as though debating what to say, “I don’t know,” he finally admitted, “I haven’t seen him since yesterday,”
He itched to pick at the skin around his fingers, to feel the pull and give of flesh as he made himself bleed. The feel the clarity that the sting of pain could provide, the concentration afforded to him by the injury.
“Alright, fair enough. Wanna listen to music?”
Since that night on the tennis court, Castiel realized with a jolt.
“Anytime,”
Dean settled in for the story, sensing the hushed nature of Jimmy’s words.
The silence hung heavy.
Castiel made his way over to the bar to order himself a drink to-go.
Cas grimaced.
This morning, his hesitation to leave the warmth of his bed was compounded by the fact that he knew he had to walk to work. His sleep addled brain wanted to strangle his awake brain for that genius decision. Fuck.
They were harder to talk to. How do you talk to someone you indirectly killed?
Jimmy knew Castiel better than anyone else. Well, almost anyone else.
“Me too,” Castiel breathed out.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean whispered, “I brought you some clothes. Are you good to get changed?”
The Christmas holidays weren’t the only reason for Castiel’s yearly return to Lawrence.
“I’m just worried,” Dean said simply. He navigated the car around a bend, onto the street with Jimmy’s house.
As Dean watched the flare explode overhead, all he could think was Wow, Jimmy was right. Fireworks on the river would’ve been beautiful.
There it was. There was the yearly visit announcement.
“Not you, too,”
“Great! Now, wouldn’t you agree that fireworks are better when you have the best view possible of them?”
Castiel went to turn the phone off, but it started ringing before he had the chance.
He wasn’t getting that person back.
“I don’t know,” Cas paused, “I’m worried too,”
That was, until Bobby got his knee busted out by a bullet.
He wanted his face to get stuck like this. He wanted them to know he was decidedly
Cas’ eyebrow quirked.
The search party took too long to organize, the sun long gone by the time everyone was at the meeting point. The call time to meet in the square was four o’clock, according to Jody. Four hours to get everyone in town who was willing to help together. Four hours from the time she called Castiel until they were all standing in the middle of town, circled around a fucking gazebo, waiting for Jody to give out locations. It wasn’t hard to guess where Jimmy had probably ended up. There were only a handful of drop off spots along the river, and even fewer places in between where he could’ve surfaced.
Amelia, Claire’s mom, had been too good for Jimmy. Funny, bright, and sarcastic as hell. Dean had always liked her. She’d died too young, as far as he was concerned. Claire had never even gotten to really know her.
Bobby wheeled off, leaving Dean and Cas alone. Fucking asshole.
The garage wasn’t that far of a walk, only eight minutes away on a good day, but the blustery winds definitely made the eight minutes miserable. The Midwest winter winds had a way of cutting through even the thickest jackets, stabbing at his bare skin with a thousand knives, making Dean regret ever having walked outside in the first place. He wrapped his scarf tighter around his face.
The knock on the door brought reality crashing down around him.
Castiel would never understand how people could say any scene in one of his books was unrealistic when this current situation was something that was happening in his real, actual life. Somehow, this whole event felt more contrived than anything he’d ever written, and that was saying something, if the opinions of his harshest critics were anything to go by.
Jimmy was fine. He was being overly dramatic.
He never actually managed to read anything aside from the title.
“Yeah, what’s up?” He cringed at how reedy and thin his voice was.
They were standing on the river dock.
Dean visited his mom’s grave first. She was the easier one to talk to.
it is,” Jimmy’s voice was hard, “Look, Cas, I know you try really hard to understand her, but honestly, you don’t know the first thing about parenthood. Please stop telling me how to parent my daughter,”
He pushed away from the counter and pulled out his phone to text Jimmy.
Sam’s phone rang, cutting the conversation short.
Dean’s head swiveled, following her eyes.
A rustling noise.
“How could you possibly have known that my face represented ‘wistful joy’?”
“Yeah, the other day,”
It was different when he was writing. Characters weren’t people. Dialogue wasn’t a conversation. It was all a puzzle, one that he actually enjoyed putting together. He still remembered Jimmy’s words after he’d published his first novel.
He had to be.
“I read your book. You miss him,”
It only took one look at Jimmy’s upset face for Dean to make a stupid, impulsive decision.
He wasn’t sure why he continued to come here every year. Hell, he wasn’t sure why he ever came here in the first place. He and his parents had never gotten along. They had never truly understood him. Sure, his autism probably had something to do that. He’d be stupid to deny it. Still, he couldn’t help but think it probably went deeper than that. He wasn’t the child they had wanted. Jimmy had been. He sometimes wondered if they’d have been happier if only Jimmy had been born. They’d certainly still be alive if that were the case.
Dean helped Jimmy clamber back up onto the pier, and got blasted with mud for his troubles. He was thankful for the tread on his boots and he braced himself under Jimmy’s weight.
, their respective epitaphs read. Castiel could’ve laughed.
Dean rolled his eyes.
That got Cas’ attention.
Dean was one of the few people Castiel could get any semblance of a read on. It wasn’t perfect – his understanding of people’s quirks and motivations never was – but it was better than it was with most people. Maybe it was because of how long Castiel had known him. Maybe it was because Dean wore his heart and feelings on his sleeve, a proud badge of honor that had been hard-won over the years. Whatever the reason, Castiel knew Dean was pissed right now. Rightfully so, after all.
into the house, like he belonged. Castiel moved to Los Angeles. He still owned the house, or half of it, but he was just as much of a stranger there now as he had been as a child, growing up under its roof. An uncomfortable piece of a puzzle that didn’t want to be put together.
Of course, he did. No wonder his face had been so chilled when he got in.
Castiel shook his head.
Dean groaned. Fucking Novaks.
“Yeah, no problem,” His voice was gruff.
Castiel nodded, eyes trailing to the window behind the kitchen sink. It was a sunny day outside, sky wide open and clear the way only Kansas could manage.
Castiel’s jaw fell to the floor.
“That would be nice,” Cas’ voice sounded relieved, as if he’d been expecting Dean to turn him down.
“Boring, isn’t it?” Cas’ whisper caught him off guard.
“Oh come on, Cas, all I want is a few boats set up on the river so people can watch the show!”
. That had been the part of his novel that had gotten the most media buzz. Who was the mysterious ex that the great Castiel Novak had dedicated a break up story to?
have a relationship then,”
“Oh yes I can,”
. He walked away before Cas had a chance to say no.
Snow was falling as he walked home, flakes gently catching on his eyelashes.
He just needed to check it. He needed to prove to himself that Jimmy wasn’t here. If he wasn’t here, then that meant he was in Kansas City.
Everyone knew that the fourteenth of December would mark the thirteenth anniversary of the car crash that had taken Naomi and Michael Novak.
He didn’t have to meet Cas’ gaze to know what his face looked like. His head was probably tilted at that angle he always cocked it to when he was confused, blue eyes squinted, lips pursed. When they had been together, Dean would egg Cas on into making that face on purpose.
“Yeah, well,” He rubbed absently at the back of his hand with his dirty rag, dragging streak of grease across his wrist, “Let’s go check out the car,”
He hung up before Castiel had the chance to respond.
He never understood why people craved fireworks in their romances. It was a detail that always seemed to work in his favor in his stories. A story with a dashing hero, a beautiful love interest, and fireworks when they kissed. People went crazy for it every time. They never got tired of sparks flying.
“Tell Ellen to stop letting Ash touch her fuckin’ car!”
His hands were shaking. He didn’t like how being caught off guard could leave him feeling like this.
He could only hope Dean wasn’t planning on reading his book. He knew it was a stupid wish.
Before too long, Castiel was loaded into Dean’s car with a pack full of meager searching supplies. There were flares, a reflective vest, some handwarmers, an extra set of gloves, and a flashlight.
“No,” Dean corrected, “you want rowboats to be converted with an engine so that people can steer out onto an icy river in the middle of winter to watch the show. It’s a death trap. I’m not doing it,”
Dean clutched at straws.
Castiel shook his head again.
“What’d you tell him?”
Dean breathed in relief.
“You sure?”
He smiled.
Dean eyed him skeptically.
“I’m sure he’s fine. He’s probably in the city,”
“Do what?”
Cas managed to get through the bandaid and started pulling at the skin around his cuticle.
“Alright, so, let’s get to business,” Ellen stood at the far end of the table opposite of Dean and Cas. In her hands, she held thick packets of paper, which she courteously distributed amongst the group. When Dean received his, he noticed it appeared to be an amalgamation of various land surveys, business contact information, and scans of newspaper articles about parades in past years.
Castiel, on the other hand, stimmed by rocking his head back, picking at his fingers, and a whole host of other, less palatable habits. He certainly looked the part of an autist. Dean passed as neurotypical, albeit as a neurotypical with authority issues.
“That’s what Castiel said this morning,”
He shot a glare at Bobby’s office when he was sure the man couldn’t see before pulling a chair up in front of the phone and grabbing a pen and some paper. This was going to take a minute.
“It was nice to see you,” Cas’ voice was gruff, deeper than it had been a few moments ago.
“That was inappropriate, and you know it,”
“He’ll stay here tonight,”
And so, he found himself pulled over on the side of the road, two minutes from his destination, with ear plugs in and an arm thrown over his face in a desperate attempt to deal with the side effects of his brain’s neurochemistry.
Three short squeezes.
“Just like who?”
Dean cut Jimmy off.
“No, but I tried texting him,”
Fuck, he needed to stop thinking of Cas as his ex-boyfriend. The man was his own damn person, after all.
Castiel nodded.
Leave it to Jimmy to disappear on the day when he’s needed. Fucking small town mechanic shops. Castiel pressed his shoulder up against the phone, freeing his hand up to worry at his hangnail.
Charlie attempted to bait him into gossip for the entire time she made Cas’ drink, sending him little teasing glances and telling stories about everyone they knew in Lawrence. She was halfway through a tale about some cute girl she had met in Kansas City a few weeks earlier when she finally finished the monstrosity that was Cas’ drink.
“Thank you, Dean,”
He was going to die here.
“If I give you Jimmy’s phone now, is it gonna trigger something?”
Why the hell was Cas here in the first place?
“Well,” Claire’s voice was so self-satisfied, Dean could’ve slapped her, “this is an interesting turn of events,”
Dean could not believe he was doing this. He could not fucking believe Bobby had had the guts to trick him.
Even Castiel caught the humor in her words.
“Whatever?” Jimmy didn’t seem to catch the shift in the mood, “Don’t ‘whatever’ me. I don’t have to let you go on this trip,”
The awkwardness was increasing, a pressure that rose around Castiel’s neck, almost choking him. He genuinely thought he might lose the ability to breathe.
“Okay?”
“Dad told me,”
His head fell back against the seat’s headrest.
“Busy,”
He pulled on the rag in his hands, tugging it as hard as he could as he debated how best to go about getting the oil out of his hair. He could just give himself a sink bath, use the soap in there to get it out. He almost winced at the crick it would put in his neck, though. Otherwise, he could just stick to running his dirty towel through his hair and hope it didn’t leave any grime behind. That wasn’t likely though.
“No,”
“I’ll get you one,” He said quickly, the words leaving him in a rush of breathlessness. He didn’t have a set plan; all he knew was he needed to get
Romantic, though. College kids would go nuts for it.
No reason to panic.
It wasn’t that he didn’t feel anxiety over Jimmy’s disappearance. His brother had never pulled a move like this before. Jimmy was the very picture of the modern American man. Perfect hair, perfect job, perfect clothes, even perfect teeth. His life had honestly been perfect until Amelia had died.
“All business, then, huh? Alright, well, Jimmy told me you’d be coming to the meeting tonight. Is that still the plan?”
Jody nodded.
“You’ve got something on your face,”
Jody rolled her eyes, but opened the door anyways, dramatically waving her arms to gesture for him to enter.
Castiel wanted Dean to break the tension. He didn’t know how to do it himself.
If Dean weren’t so frazzled from the whole situation, he’d say that there was warmth in them, too.
Dean ignored her irritable complaints. Jody could put up with losing fifteen minutes of sleep, and he knew she was whining as a way to make conversation and not to bash on Cas.
“Hey, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get you worked up,”
Was he losing his mind, or was there the tiniest hint of a smile on Cas’ lips?
, and unfortunately, he’d also been heavily based on Dean. The story had been similar to his own, childhood best friends to lovers to exes. Except there had been one crucial difference in
In less than a moment, he had scooped Cas up onto his shoulders in a fireman-carry, thanking God that he still had the strength to do it.
He knew for sure that his parents had never loved him.
He rolled out of bed with a sigh, wincing as the cover of Cas’ book poked him in the ribs. He grabbed it and placed it on his nightstand, promising himself he’d find a better spot for it later.
They showed up every year, just as beautiful and macabre as ever. The ever-present reminder that someone else in town cared enough to show up every year with flowers for his parents. Not flowers for him and Jimmy like the rest of the town did. Just for his parents.
He groaned and jiggled in his leg in a desperate attempt to set some of the spiders crawling along his nerves free.
He drained his drink, letting the sweet whiskey mixture settle over his tongue and soothe his nerves. The warmth flooded through his body almost instantly, as he placed the glass back on the bar top.
If he hadn’t watched Jimmy slip and fall over and over.
“Dad, I really have to go. Now,”
He knew he shouldn’t be thinking about Dean this much. It was painful.
“What are you gonna do?” Eileen asked, hands moving in signs that Dean didn’t recognize. Sam’s eyes stayed on her the whole time.
He usually tried to avoid public spaces during Cas’ visitation time. He felt like there was this unspoken understanding between the two of them that they should just try to avoid each other whenever possible.
On an almost weekly basis, he had to put on his mud boots, grab his trash picker, and pluck bits and pieces of debris from the river bank that were deposited on the edge of a particularly rough bend in the river’s path. It was hard work, sweaty in the summer, and slippery, potentially deadly work in the winter. Slipping into a swift-moving, ice-cold river in the middle of a Midwest winter? Not a good idea. Plus, there was no telling where the next river deposit point was. He could get dragged for miles and no one would know where to find him.
“Hey Cas,”
“The oil light had me a little scared to get behind the wheel again,”
“Oooo, so you and Dean
what is with me and always making the last scene of every chapter super short?? anyways thanks for reading!
It wasn’t that he was intentionally an asshole. He just had trouble communicating with people. Autism, apparently. At least, that’s what the psychiatric evaluation had said when he was a child. Asperger’s, specifically, though he preferred not to call it that. Autism had a better ring to it, it got the point across clearer. It also felt better in his mouth, but that wasn’t something he’d tell anyone else. At least, not anyone aside from the one person he had told. The person he’d told all his secrets to, a long time ago.
“Hey bud, where’d you go?”
He stayed quiet for a few moments before answering with a simple, “It’s okay,”
Eileen interrupted him.
Castiel blushed.
Thankfully – no,
He twirled the stone in his hand as he looked out the window at the dreary day and felt the draft blow over his bare feet. Just outside the house, the branches of one of the many pecan trees swayed in the wind, the dead remnants of pecans that hadn’t fallen clinging on, dried out shells that had cracked open and resembled strange, skeletal flowers peppering the otherwise bare branches. It was a depressing sight. Castiel flicked the wooden shutters shut.
Dean cursed. He needed to be more careful. Needed to watch where he was going.
Today, it seemed like the cold might’ve been getting to Bobby, judging by the way he’d hunched himself up in his office right in front of the ancient space heater dish he’d bought for Ellen when she visited.
“When Amelia died, Claire just… I don’t know… Stopped liking the water. Maybe she associated it with her mom, maybe she just got too old for it. I don’t know. All I know is she’s getting older, and pretty soon, she’ll be off at college, and I won’t have an opportunity to spend this much time with her again. I want to give her this gift sooner rather than later. I want to give her the river back,”
Castiel had always wondered what had happened to it. Leave it to Dean to keep something for weird, sentimental reasons.
Fuck, if Castiel could do it all over again, he would’ve married that man in a heartbeat, if only to wake up to that damn smile every day. To see those eyes staring at him when he woke up in the mornings.
“There’s fourteen full-size bouquets,” Jimmy’s voice echoed from the adjacent room, “And two smaller ones, I think,”
And now, he was kneeling on one knee, in the middle of the fucking tennis court, staring at the Christmas lights lining the edge of the event tent over his head, wondering what the fuck had just happened.
His mind idly fixated on his mother as he continued to pick up trash, not really outright focusing on anything about her in particular. It was something he liked to do when he had to muddle his way through anything mildly unpleasant. Her vague memory offered warmth, a glow in his chest that very few other things could, and that warmth was enough to cut through the icy wind chill and river water splashing his legs.
Jimmy snapped his fingers.
“I get it if you don’t want to talk about it. I do. But don’t you think that talking about it might be… I don’t know… healthy? You’ve never really talked about it before. You just said – “
seat – a fucking assigned seat – at the little plastic folding table in the community center that Ellen had set up for the parade committee meeting that evening, and he was not happy about it.
“I’m telling you, Dean, it’ll be fine. I just need you to install the damn engines. I’ll pay you extra, if that’s what you need,”
Cas’ volume rose, interrupting Ellen and drawing the committee’s attention to them.
“Nothin’,”
His watch beeped, a sign that the new hour had started. He checked it, more out of habit than necessity. Seven AM. It was time to leave for work.
“Exactly what it fuckin’ sounds like, Cas! You treat people like characters. Hell, people
Eileen waved a hand at him, before tapping both her index and middle fingers against her thumb, the rest of her fingers curled in towards her palm.
“Guess who I caught smoking back there last week?”
It was hard for Castiel to remember sometimes that Jimmy had actually had a good relationship with their parents. As willing as he was to be flexible about their visits here, the act of visiting their graves still held more emotional weight for Jimmy than it did Castiel.
“What do you want then?”
He rolled his eyes, his own bouquet of red roses seemed almost romantic alongside the lilies. Like the pair belonged together.
Dean saw a face, right below the surface, so pale that the beam of his flashlight reflected off of it like a beacon.
Dean eyed him, and reached out to touch Castiel’s nose, wiping something away. He froze a moment later, as if realizing what he had just done.
Dean cut Claire off before she could respond.
“How can I help you?”
“Hey Bobby, did you bother to ask Jimmy what his budget was for his suspension?”
Trash. Dead fish. The felled tree.
“I’m okay,” Dean said through his chattering teeth when Cas’ hand didn’t loosen it’s stranglehold on his.
“Look, bud, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. That was wrong of me. I just think that you and Dean would do well to start speaking again,”
“I’m not saying it is,”
dead when he stumbled across the body that morning.
“Yes, okay, we’re on our way right now. Meet you there,”
It was a little ritual he had, a private one he indulged in whenever Cas announced a new novel on his website. He’d grab a coffee from the little shop next to the bookstore, wander around for about half an hour poking at books he’d never even think about reading, before eventually building up the courage to head back to the front of the store and grab Cas’ new book from the table the shop set up for releases they wanted to push hard. Then, he’d take the book and his coffee, find a chair somewhere, and sit with the book in his hands until his coffee went cold, trying to muster up the courage to open the damn thing up and just fucking read his ex-boyfriend’s stories already.
“Claire…” Castiel warned, quietly.
It used to happen after a particularly bad fight with his parents, or after a bully had said something that struck a chord.
“I’m just gonna… I’m gonna grab us some cocoa, okay?”
There were flowers on the kitchen counter top, small and large bouquets scattered across its surface in mismatched vases.
Jimmy bit his lip.
“Well,” Claire said after a long moment, “That went better than I expected it to,”
He squeezed his eyes shut, cutting the stimulus off at its source, before turning on his heels and heading to the guest room.
“Let’s walk,”

When he finally made it through the boarding process and onto the plane, he ordered himself another drink. Anything to steel his nerves against the visit back to Lawrence.
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but he was pretty sure the reason he didn’t want to find out was because that would mean admitting the books were never dedicated to him.
“Thanks, Vanna White,”
It was an ostentatious thing, chocolatey and covered in whipped cream and rainbow sprinkles. Dean quirked an eyebrow at Charlie.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Between my jobs (yes, plural) and actually having to rewrite this chapter a handful of times (it was way too graphic originally), this one took longer than expected. I also went back and copyedited the first chapter and plan on doing the other ones soon, since I’ve noticed a considerable uptick in story interest this week and I finally found a reason to make sure my writing is legible.
“Well, I’ll see the two of you later. My ticket out of here just arrived and I’m cashing it in,”
She’d been right, after all. He wasn’t exactly the resident Jimmy expert that he’d been when they lived under the same roof year-round. He didn’t know his brother as well as he thought he did. He wondered if he ever had.
Castiel rubbed at his eyes, weariness weighing down his shoulders. He felt like Atlas, bearing the burden of the sky.
Cas looked up at him.
“Get me one of them chicken salad sandwiches,”
“I said, let’s go check out the water line from here. I wanna see how the river level looks,”
It wouldn’t be an easy thing to reach. He hadn’t been joking when he said he didn’t know what the current was like. Luckily, the bend in the river on his property didn’t run too deep, maybe chest-height at the worst, but it was more than enough to suck a grown man under if there were any wayward eddies he didn’t know about. Hell, water above the knees was dangerous, especially in the parts of the river without rocks lining the bottom. The silt could easily suck them down if they weren't careful. Dean could admit he was nervous about what they were going to do.
Castiel chewed over his brother’s words. He couldn’t quite meet Jimmy’s eyes, instead focusing on the bridge of Jimmy’s nose, the perfect spot to look when avoiding eye contact.
“Why can’t you just ask your brother?” Ellen cut straight to the point in that special way she had of peeling away layers of bullshit.
Jimmy sounded positively diabolical. He knew if Dean said no, especially in front of Cas, he’d look like a dick. Fucking asshole salesman, backing him into a corner. Leave it to Jimmy to notice that Dean still cared about Cas’ opinion of him.
“It’s not cocky to expect a drain plug to act like normal,” Dean groused. He wiped the offending item off with a spare rag in his pocket and tossed it over to Bobby.
