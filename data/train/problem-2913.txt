“Meet me downstairs when you’re ready,” Cas calls from the hallway. “No rush.”
Cas moves to the edge of the bed and takes a seat. “You, of all people, are uniquely equipped to handle this scenario. You’ve dealt with more angels than most humans ever have or will. And you are a capable man who has experience with everything from childcare to apocalypses.”
The clerk grabs a bottle marked SAMPLE and unscrews the top. He dips two thin wooden spoons into the honey and holds one out. As Dean takes it, he watches, mesmerized, as the clerk slides the second spoon between his own lips and over his tongue. “Quality control,” the man says with a wink and tosses the garbage into a nearby can.
“Wow. That’s… Well, that’s really awesome of you, Cas. Raising a kid on your own can’t be easy.”
When Dean came to, he was lying on his memory foam with the comforter tucked over him and a bandage wrapped snugly around his arm. He was woozy and stiff, but the worst of the vertigo had passed. He turned his head and found Castiel snoozing at an uncomfortably crooked angle in a chair beside the bed. It didn’t seem real. Had they actually done it? Or had Dean died in the dungeon and this image was just the last electrical impulses of his failing brain?
is another drink. Actually, just give me the rest of the bottle.”
“Today is the six-month anniversary of the day you...well, you know. That probably doesn’t mean anything to someone who’s been al— around as long as you,” he’d almost said
“Fine, but put ‘em in the sink to soak and that’s all the work you’re allowed to do.” A finger waggles at Cas in mock threat.
“No, yeah, man. Thanks,” Dean replies, eloquence lost to emotion. “Have a good night, Cas.”
“In that case, what would you say to coming by and taste testing it for me? I’ll even make dinner and we can watch a movie you haven’t seen yet. Just name the day.” He groans internally, bracing for rejection or at least an excuse because he’s said too much, too quickly. He must’ve sounded pathetic.
With a huff, Cas settles back against his seat. “Perhaps. There does seem to be an unusual amount of electricity lingering after each strike…”
Castiel purses his lips into a frown. He knows Dean is stubborn. That much is clear from the way he’d walked into Castiel’s life and refused to leave. The way he can’t ignore someone in need. The way he puts his all into his work and gives and gives and gives of himself for those he loves.
When they finally break apart, both breathing a bit heavier, Dean sighs. “Man, you’re makin’ me wanna call off the opening just so you can have your way with me upstairs.”
Dean stares at Cas with wide eyes, awed and unsure what to say. He finally settles on the ever eloquent, “Wow.”
The resort itself was three stories of wood and white brick that seemed to glow in the early morning light. Above the entrance, the roof rose in three recessing gables, each taller than the one before it, so that it resembled the mountain peaks in the distance. Large evergreen trees towered over each side of the building and Dean could just make out what looked like a shovelled pathway through them. With the fresh dusting of snow it looked damn near picturesque. If the outside was this beautiful he couldn’t wait to see what his room looked like, even if he did have to share with one of the other male chaperones.
The boys go skiing
“I, uh-.”
Once their duffles were in the back of the Impala, Dean brought the engine to life. It was 4:23 and they had more than enough time to make the trip to school so he let the engine warm-up and began shuffling through the box of tapes for appropriate tunes. Nothing said pre-dawn like Zeppelin IV.
I will stand with Team Cas Loves Taylor Swift until the end.
Green eyes met blue in the dim light of the car. “Say it again.”
“How are you holding up?” Castiel asked, making sure to stand with a reasonable distance between them which just felt
“Next time we are out in the snow you better watch your back Winchester,” Castiel growled, his blue eyes dark and glinting with mischief. Dean was so screwed.
matter Dean,” Cas growled as he fist his hands in the front of Dean’s flannel and pulled, crashing their lips together in a bruising kiss.
A hand on his elbow stopped him. “Don’t worry man,” Jo said, her voice kind as she gave him a small smile. “Take a second to relax.”
Please feel free to drop me a comment and let me know what you think! Comments and kudos give me life!
Taking a deep breath, Dean pushed forward until he felt the tip of his cock breach Castiel’s opening. After a little bit of resistance, Castiel opened easily under him and Dean slid the rest of the way in one smooth slide. Castiel let out a small whine as Dean bottomed out and leaned forward to rest his hands on either side of Castiel’s shoulders.
Thanks again to my lovely beta Arianllyn who makes sure that I remember that grammar is a thing that exists in this world!
As the gondola slowed as he approached the top he began to psych himself up to dismount. He’d done it on the baby version down below, just stand and push off, simple right? But as his chair approached the drop off point he began to panic. This thing was still moving way too fast. Was it broken? Did they really think that he could just hop off like it was no big deal?
“We are never moving again,” Castiel grumbled, turning his head into Dean’s chest.
With a flat tongue, Dean licked up the underside of Castiel’s cock. Castiel bit back a whine and two hands flew out to tangle in Dean’s hair. His hips rocked slightly forward as he sought out the heat of Dean’s mouth. “I got you sweetheart,” Dean purred before his tongue darted out to taste the precome that glistened at the tip.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Bossy,” Dean replied before taking Castiel’s earlobe between his teeth as he snapped his hips forward, pushing a gasp out of Castiel.
With a snort, Sam went to grab them both bowls. By the time he had the cereal out and poured, the coffee was blissfully done brewing. Dean poured each of them a mug and followed Sam to the table. They ate and drank in relative silence, each Winchester too tired to care about much more than getting food into their mouth.
Once he stood, Dean fumbled for his own belt buckle as he turned towards the bed. All the air in his lungs punched out of him in a strangled curse. Castiel was laying back on the pristine sheets of the bed, stretched out languorously like the six foot sex god he was. One hand trailed his chest while the other was wrapped loosely around his cock which still glistened in the low light from Dean’s spit. With one knee up and his other leg cocked to the side, Dean had the perfect vantage point for what was definitely the sexiest thing he’d ever seen.
Dean slumped down onto the couch, wincing at the twinge of pain from his sore muscles. Castiel had healed his cracked ribs, shattered nose, and broken leg but there wasn’t enough mojo in the world to erase the ache he felt from the bruises that had once littered his skin.
“Just go see if Rufus needs another, okay?” Dean snipped, without turning to look at her. He couldn’t fight the smile that was breaking across his face. He felt a knot in his gut loosen at the sight of Castiel here, in the Roadhouse, part of Dean’s world for once.
He walked through the aisle, looking for an empty spot. He found one three rows in and grinned. “Is this seat taken?”
“Well, I guess that depends on what you like?”
Castiel leaned in and cut off Dean’s rambling with a kiss. The kiss was soft, sweet, and over far too quickly for Dean’s liking. “No more apologizing, you had no way to know.”
Dean’s thoughts stuttered, his brain seeming to freeze as he stared down at the man below him. Cas had shimmied his pants down just enough to pull his cock out and
He settled back against the headrest and let his head roll towards Castiel as he tried to get some shut eye. Just as soon as he closed his eyes, he felt something press against his lap. Looking down, he saw a tablet settled on his and Castiel’s knees. Castiel watched him put two and two together, expectantly holding out an earbud.
“Are you going to stare all night or get over here?” Castiel teased.
“Need you Cas,” Dean groaned. He was desperate to show Castiel how he felt and how much he wanted him. How much he loved him even if he couldn’t say it right now. He tugged at the buttons of Castiel’s pea coat before he pushed it over his shoulders, off his arms, and onto the growing pile of clothes on the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel studied him momentarily, his fingers aimlessly tracing through the condensation on his glass once again. “Yes,” he hummed. “I’m certainly lucky to have you in my life.”
It turned out that while his fellow chaperones were all significantly older and wealthier than him, they were all perfectly friendly to the newcomer to their group. Apparently half the table played something called ‘Bunco’ together and had decided as a group to sign up for the trip. When they inevitably asked Dean what he did for a living they didn’t even turn up their noses at him for being a mechanic. Instead, one of the fathers, Charles, leaned in and started discussing classic Mustangs. Maybe the Benbrook parents were
Jo glanced between them once more before backing away. “You’re not the boss of me Winchester.”
“We are doing exactly what the children are prohibited from doing,” Castiel gasped around his laughter. “We are officially the worst role models.”
With a final soft smile, Castiel turned and was gone. As Dean watched him leave, he couldn’t help but be glad that the other man hadn’t put on his coat yet. Somehow, in the last two weeks, he had forgotten just how attractive Cas was. And if he thought Castiel’s ass looked great in khakis, that was nothing to how the jeans he wore now hugged every curve of his hips.
Cas grabs the back of his neck and pulls him in for another kiss. When he pulls back, he leans his forehead against Dean’s and whispers, “¿Por que no los dos?”
A shrug lifts Dean’s shoulders. “Man, I dunno. I hope so.”
Chuck was still out there and as long as Dean had breath in his body, he would do what he had always done. Beaten and broken, he would continue to stand up until he couldn’t stand anymore. He would keep fighting for everyone he had loved and lost, for his family both given and found.
“Very good,” Cas approves. “I’ll be the only one to touch the hives. Also, no running around like crazy and if any part of being out there frightens you, make sure you let me know. It sounds cliché , but bees can literally smell fear. That said, they should be fairly docile since it’s almost winter.”
The call goes dead and Gabriel doubles over, howling until he’s crying. Meanwhile, Cas slides off the table and flops onto his back on the dining room rug, observing the popcorn ceiling as if it holds the answers to all mysteries of life.
Dean parks his Impala.
Backpedaling to brake, he pauses in front of the house. He’d seen how it had looked before Dean moved in, dirty and unloved. But now there is a fresh coat of gray-blue paint and the stairs have been pressure washed. A sign—new as of that afternoon—rests above the entry. Castiel quirks a lip at the name: Eyes on the Pies. So this Dean is a man of good taste
“Beeeees!” Jack cheers.
He knows that Gabe means well, but, honestly, Castiel would have much more fun just watching documentaries in his underwear all night. There was a new nature show airing on ABC narrated by Helen Mirren. How could someone
He ran a hand down his face. This was stupid. Like talking to a ghost who had already moved on. But he couldn’t stop himself. His waking moments were filled with grief and his guilt wouldn’t let him sleep, so he had to try something.
“Hello, Dean. What’s brought you in today?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Gabriel says, silently acknowledging the irony in telling his little brother The Drama Queen not to worry when that’s one of his defining traits. “Just don’t be surprised to find an on-demand movie charged to your account next month!”
“Oh? You think he has a nice laugh, do you?” Gabe says, snatching the phone from the counter. Cas glares at him, and starts to make his way around the counter to get it, but Gabe hightails it to the dining room. “What else do you like about my friend Cas?”
Stroking faster, Dean rubbed his thumb across the heads of their cocks with every upstroke. Below him, Cas was making soft keening noises that were driving Dean insane; driving him to the edge and threatening to push him over. Nipping at Castiel’s kiss swollen bottom lip, Dean tried to ignore the way his stomach tightened in warning and the way his legs began to shake. Christ he was close but wanted Cas to come first.
“We should probably get inside and clean up before we freeze,” Dean said, pulling back and moving to refasten his jeans. “I think that shirt might be ruined though.”
Dean took a step closer and grabbed Castiel by the scarf and gently pulled until they were chest to chest. “Everything is perfect,” Dean whispered before pulling Castiel in for a kiss.
Angel.
What he didn’t see was the knowing smile Jo shot in his direction as she ducked behind the bar and back into the office. Still caught up in the soft smile tugging at Castiel’s lips and the way Castiel looked up at him through dark lashes, Dean failed to notice as the music switched back to their normal playlist.
With a snort of laughter, Dean had to grip tightly to the back of the couch as he fought for breath around his quiet laughter. “I’m sorry but did you just call me
“Is everything okay?” Castiel asked, a warm cloud of air from his mouth visible in the night air.
The snow was still falling in flurries as they stepped outside. Castiel pulled on that damn adorable beanie, leaving a few locks of hair sticking out to curl around his ears and lay against his forehead. Dean’s fingers itched with the urge to touch him so he stuffed them deep inside the pockets of his jacket. He felt like a teenager again, allowed to look, but not touch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean did his best to suppress a grin. “You know you’re a giant nerd right?”
“Did you mean it?” Castiel’s question was so soft Dean almost couldn’t hear it over the sound of his heart pounding in his ears.
’. His brain screeched to a halt and for a moment his eyesight began to tunnel. He had known this moment was coming and he thought he had been ready, he really did, but here he was completely frozen in fear. He’d never told anyone but family that he loved them and that was rare enough as it was.
Their shoulders brushed, flannel against canvas, as Dean pushed past his friend and out the door leading to the salvage yard. As he stomped down the stairs leading up to the front porch and out into the wreck of cars the frigid night air cut through his shirt, chilling the frustrated heat that was still singing through his veins. He glanced up at the sky, the stars at Bobby’s house always caught him off guard. There was something about it that made him feel like if he was just a little taller he could reach up and pluck one from the sky.
HELLO! This Chapter was accidentally not posted in the correct order so if you're already read chapter 7, I am SO sorry.
“You’re incredible Cas,” he murmured as he turned to look at the other man.
In the low light Castiel’s normally ocean blue eyes were almost completely black, pupils blown wide with lust. His tongue darted out to wet his lower lip as he moved to get inside the Impala and damn, Dean couldn’t help but lean back in to chase that tongue with his own. They fell backward, Dean throwing out his arms as he tried to catch himself before he landed completely on the other man.
“Dean-,” Cas huffed, his hips shifting against the seat. Blue eyes fluttered shut as Cas palmed his own dick and
***UPDATE: I fucked up when I posted chapters and forgot to post the REAL chapter 6. Please take a second to go back and read about our boys on their first date and maybe this chapter will make more sense. I'm so embarrassed and so colossaly sorry for the confusion. I love every one of you
“Okay, I’ll set the alarm for six which gives us plenty of time to shower and for me to sneak back to my room.”
Dean felt a wave of emotion build in his chest but the words stayed stuck in his throat. “Yeah Cas,” he softly replied, hoping Castiel knew what he meant. “Yeah.”
Irritation swept through Dean, his green eyes turning hard as he thought back to this morning. “They had kids Bobby! You didn’t have to watch as they unloaded a bus full of terrified second graders and lined them up in the warehouse like a fucking all you can eat buffet.” The sound of the children’s screams echoed in his mind, their terrified faces permanently scarring him. Yeah, he was going to be adding that to his list of recurring nightmares.
Sam opened his mouth to reply before thinking better of it and closing it with a click of his teeth. The muscle in his jaw twitched as he clenched it before he turned and stormed off, boots thudding against the stairs.
“I thought it was obvious, I’m here to chaperone some little shits.” Dean smirked
When they got a chance, Dean would lean against the bar and swap stories. Castiel had more than a few stories about outrageous things his students had written in papers or asked in class. Dean replied in turn with stories that Sam would kill him for sharing. It was nice, the conversation flowing easily, in a way that Dean didn’t often feel with others. If he could forget about the way he kept getting pulled away, it almost felt like a date.
Naomi got up in the front to once again put the fear of God in the students to guarantee an orderly check in process. Dean groaned as he popped his back once he was off the bus. Those bucket seats had nothing on his Baby. Letting out a low whistle, he turned to give the resort a once over. The Mount Crescent Ski Area and Resort was far nicer than anywhere Dean could have imagined taking a vacation.
“Well that’s a load of bullshit,” Dean grumbled, trying to hide his disappointment. Maybe over the last month, he’d imagined him and Castiel riding the gondola together up the hill, their hands held through thick mittens in their brief moment of privacy.
“Cas, buddy,” Dean started, letting his neck arch back so he could try to find the North Star. “Can we not do this right now?”
Dean could feel the beginnings of Castiel’s erection pressing against a thigh and bit back a moan. He wanted the man in his arms so desperately, but he was also starting to lose feeling in his fingers. Regretfully, he pulled back, breaking the kiss to shove his hands in his pockets.
Not one to ignore a direct request, Dean pulled out almost all the way before slowly pushing back inside. If he thought Castiel felt tight around his fingers, that was nothing to the way that those hot walls felt squeezing around his cock. Dean had often imagined this moment, but he’d had no idea just how good it would feel.
“You’re really going to just sit there like nothing happened?” Sam asked, taking the glass of whiskey Bobby passed him.
“Right back at you assbutt,” Castiel replied, his voice perfectly even.
Thank you so much for all the love for the last chapter. I love this supportive community. Hope y'all enjoyed this one just as much.
“I know you don’t want to talk about it,” Cas started, his fingers brushing against Dean’s where they rested on metal.
“Dean please,” Castiel gasped, doing his best to stay quiet since they were still pressed against the door. The thought that anyone could walk by and hear them only made Dean want to make the man above him lose control even more.
“Heya, Cas, how’s the boring dead guy?” He asked, casually leaning over the back of the couch.
With his cock getting impossibly harder, Dean moaned and leaned in for another kiss. “Yes, definitely yes.” He kissed him again before pulling back. “Wait, we need stuff for that, I didn’t bring anything.”
As the chair came around and scooped him up, Dean did his best to focus on how he wished Sam could have been there with him instead of the fact that he was hundreds of feet off the ground on a rickety contraption suspended by a cable that could break at any second. No big deal.
I never went on cool field trips like this as a teenager so I'm winging it as to how chaperones work. Feel free to let me know if I've got it wrong! I promise to get the next chapter up as soon as possible!!!! <3
Without turning to look, Dean took a small sip. “Drinking on the job teach?”
So in case you didn't see it on the other chapter, I fucked up and skipped posting chapter 6. Please take a second to go back and read it before you continue. I promise you'll like it and it's really important for Dean's development.
“You look like crap,” a teasing voice called.
Massive shout out to my new and beautiful beta Arianllyn. She's done wonders to improve my deplorable grammar so send your thanks her way. Also go check out what she's written as well!
“Sure, bring on the Doctor,” Dean replied, nodding to the tablet.
vamp, just one,” Sam replied, his voice raising in frustration. “With a little more recon we may have known that we were up against a whole nest! There were almost twenty of those neck biters! Oh and how can I forget the best part, you running in there alone!”
,” Dean groaned, burying his head in the crook of Castiel’s neck as he came. “Love you so much.”
The laughter faded into a comfortable silence. It was nice to have Castiel in his arms and his chest felt full. He knew he loved Castiel, now he just needed to figure out how to say it.
“How are there 9 Doctors if there has only been one season?”
“Nice performance Winchester,” Jo called before ducking into the office to turn the music back down.
Dean raised a brow, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips. “Oh yeah, next time?”
“Fuck, I didn’t even think of that! Cas, sweetheart I’m so sorry-.”
“Stop giving me that pissy bitch face Sammy,” Dean huffed. “It was a hunt, accidents happen sometimes okay?”
Dean hummed in response, his hands shoved deeply in his pockets so he would remember to keep his hands to himself for three days. The mountains really were beautiful. What they lacked in height, they made up for in the beauty of a fresh blanket of soft snow. Thankfully, the entire back wall of the lodge was covered in floor to ceiling windows so you could look out on the slopes from anywhere.
“Is that the titular new hope?” Cas asks, deadpan. Dean gives him a confused look, trying to decide if Cas is pulling his leg or being completely serious. “Careful, Dean. Your face might get stuck that way.”
“Oh, well, I uh— thought I’d come back for a few more bottles of that cinnamon honey. I used it to test out a mini pie last night and ended up eating the whole thing myself. Soooo I’m gonna need a bunch if it’s going to be part of my best seller.”
Flicking the blinker, Dean maneuvers the Impala up the sloped driveway leading to their podunk motel. “And if he’s going for human, what’s with the wings?”
, Castiel thinks as he reflects Dean’s smile.
“You wouldn’t dare,” Dean growls, his eyes narrowing dangerously.
“That beauty is in the eyes of the bee-holder.” It’s probably the worst pun he’s ever made, but he just couldn’t pass up the timing.
Dean didn’t even pull away as he replied, fist still full of beige fabric and voice barely a whisper, “Ain’t no mountain high enough, Cas.” He found himself wanting to bury his face in the heat of Castiel’s neck, to inhale his scent and be held, clinging to the vitality of the angel’s heartbeat.
He puts the phone on speaker as Castiel hisses an angry, “I do
Gabe gives Sam a once-over. “What the hell, Cassie? You’ve been holding out on me. Why didn’t you tell me he had such a tall drink of water for a brother?”
Cas throws his head back and downs the rest of his mead. He stands as the crowd cheers him on. “Assbutt,” he mutters grumpily in Gabriel’s direction, and his brother has the audacity to pat him on the back, gloating.
“Yeah,
Cas hands the bottle over.
Dean reciprocates with a smile and pulls back his hand, stuffing it into the familiar safety of a pocket but not before noticing the specter of the man’s touch lingering on his fingers.
Walking toward where he chained his bike, Castiel pulls out his phone to check his messages. He finds a picture waiting for him of a toddler with paint spread all over his outstretched hands and in a few splotches on his face and shirt. The accompanying text says, “
Dean can’t speak. Can barely breathe. He’s spent his whole life watching people walk away. How can Cas look at him—just as damaged as the furniture downstairs—and see anything worth staying for?
Sam flinched but it served him right for being manipulative. “Just think about it. Please? I’ve seen you die in too many ways. Don’t make me watch you destroy
Apparently, angel walkie-talkie is more visual.
When the following Saturday rolls around, Castiel is up early, aflutter with anticipation of the day’s activities. He’s already set out the birthday tablecloth and balloons. He runs through a thorough written checklist and timeline of everything else needing to get done: clean the kitchen, set the table, wrap Jack’s gifts, prep the snacks,
When Dean moves to put the key into the lock, the slight pressure alone swings open the entire door without a turn of the knob. Distantly, he realizes he must have left it unlocked when he was carrying the cake to the car. He steps forward into the darkness of the shop but stops short at the discordant crunch of glass between boot and concrete. “What the…”
“You said that happiness isn’t in the having, but you can’t tell me this isn’t better,” Dean reflected when they finally parted, foreheads resting together. “You can have me, Cas. All of me.”
Castiel jogs forward to where Dean is huddled in on himself. When Dean lifts his head from his knees, Castiel can see he’s got his broken phone in one hand and, with a gasp, the other hand wrapped clumsily with a dish towel soaked in blood.
“Don’t.” Castiel stopped him, one hand reaching out to gently grab Dean’s wrist. “Don’t apologize. I want this. It’s better this way.”
“Why not?”
“Thank you, Dean.” Stepping in from the chilly autumn weather, Cas runs a hand through his helplessly windswept hair. He surveys the shop for a moment, taking in the half-finished subway tile backsplash, modern industrial display cases, dangling edison bulbs, bare concrete flooring, and four sets of tables with two chairs each lining the wall across from the sales counter. Another week or two and this place should be ready to open. “I wish I had seen the state this place was in before you took hammer and chisel to it, but it looks like it’s coming along nicely. I’m impressed.”
The early morning voice grows concerned at the sound of a sniffle. “What’s the matter, Dean?” Cas pulls his head back just enough to scan Dean’s face, baby blues opened wide like searchlights.
The floor drops out from under Dean. His stomach goes with it. Oh god, he really needs some water. And some grease.
“Why not? You needa get some. It’ll loosen you up.”
“Likewise,” Cas says, returning the handshake with an easy smile that Dean really hopes means Cas doesn’t think he’s ashamed of him.
Oh, how he wanted to hear that voice again. He didn’t care if Castiel sat and prattled on about the migratory habits of marine mammals or the threatened existence of indigenous plants or the formation of sedimentary rocks. It would mean he was where he belonged, whole, more than a smear on Dean’s sleeve. But Castiel, fearsome and brave celestial warrior, loving and loyal companion, had been reduced to a violent sanguine stain and a hunter’s heartache.
of this,” he says, gesturing to his outfit with his free hand.
“You look like it, too!” Charlie retorts.
“Technically, that was my friend Gabe,” Cas interjects.
“Yeah ‘n’ don’t get me
Cas looks up, sky blues downright stormy as he takes note of Dean’s concern. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to bring down the mood.”
cookies. How’s that sound?”
be intimidated?
Cas, the jackass, just grins widely at Dean’s flustered babbling and whispers, lust-rough against his ear, “Neither have I.”
“What?” Gabriel sounds a little alarmed. “What’s wrong?”
A couple of squad cars pull in then, and the officers meet Dean on the front porch where he gives them all of the meager details he has. After they conduct their own sweep of the place, they tell him to document the damages and contact his insurance company with photographs and leave him with a copy of the police report.
Snagging the paper boat with his order from the burger truck, Dean follows Cas. They head down the stairs all the way to the nearly full front row, settling into two seats off to the left.
, slotted together. Cas gave a small jerk of his hips, his head pushing back against the seat with a groan.
Suddenly Castiel burst into a fit of giggles, his shoulders shaking under Dean’s arm. Dean looked at him like he’d gone mad. “What’s so funny?”
In the dining room, Dean was pleased to see that all 10 of his charges were clustered around two tables. Across the room he could see Sam’s head poking up above his shorter classmates. He did a quick check in with his students before ignoring all of his brotherly instincts to embarrass his brother and walking over to the teacher and chaperone table. Naomi was blissfully missing, but unfortunately so was Castiel. Dean took a deep breath and put on what he hoped was a convincing smile before sitting down at the last empty spot.
Dean was pretty sure he’d never seen anything more appealing. “Are you just going to sit there all night watch?”
Oh it was on. As subtly as possibly, Dean slid his freezing fingers along the back of the couch to rest just behind his boyfriend’s neck. “I bet you can’t summarize that book in a way that wouldn’t make me want to fall asleep,” Dean replied as he wrapped his cold fingers around the back of Castiel’s neck.
“I guess time really does fly when you’re having fun,” Dean teased as he picked up the empty glass, glad to have something to do with his hands. “I only have an hour and a half left in my shift!”
Dean heard Castiel snort softly in the seat next to him before his phone buzzed again.
“Shit, I didn’t realize it was so late,” he muttered, rubbing the back of his neck nervously. He was a little embarrassed at how caught up in Castiel’s attention he had been. He was going to majorly owe Jo for pulling his share of the weight.
Dean was pretty sure that his heart completely stopped at those three little words. ‘
Humming softly, Castiel thought for a moment. “I don’t care for anything that has too much hops and is very bitter, but I’m not partial to beers that barely taste like more than water either.”
The rest of the trip passed smoothly and almost too quickly for Dean’s liking. Even if they had to hide, it was nice just sitting there watching tv with Castiel. Dean loved how Castiel would get excited for certain moments and he smiled everytime he caught Castiel watching his reactions instead of the screen. Just minutes after the Doctor successfully saved the planet from the Daleks, the bus rolled to a stop in front of the resort.
“Proust is not a ‘boring dead guy’ Dead,” Castiel scolded, not even looking up from his book.
“Cas,” Dean gasped, his head rolling to the side as the Angel gently nipped his ear.
“Fuck,” Dean huffed before bracing a hand against the door and leaning in to capture soft lips in a bruising kiss.
He added their bags to the large pile before making his way over to the group of adults. His heart sunk when he didn’t see anyone who looked like Castiel but it was hard to tell with everyone so bundled up.
“So beautiful Cas,” he mumbled, nosing along the Angel’s jaw. “I want you to come for me, can you do that baby?”
“Did you want something when you came over here or are you just here to distract me from my book?” Castiel asked, giving him a long suffering sigh.
Any who. This chapter is way longer than the others so I hope that makes up for the time a litter. I'll try to get myself back on schedule but give me a little slack. I love you all so much! Okay enough blabbing, on with the story!!
She did not look amused in the slightest, focusing instead on her clipboard. “Good, you’re our last chaperone. In about five minutes we will load the students onto the bus. If you need to use the restroom, I suggest you step inside because you do
Dean rolled his eyes as he finished pouring a beer. “Thanks Jo, you look stunning as usual.”
Dean frowned slightly, trying to figure out his response, when a wave from one of the tables caught his attention. “Duty calls, I’ll be right back.” He paused, giving Castiel a quick once over. “Don’t go anywhere.”
Please enjoy their first date.
“Are you Dean Winchester?”
“But I assume we’re going to.” Dean ran a hand through his hair as he spoke. “Fine. I don’t understand why everyone can’t get over this. It was a hunt, sometimes hunts go wrong. We never know if we are going to come back home or not. It’s happened a hundred times, what does it matter?”
His lips were cold and chapped from the wind, but they quickly warmed under Dean’s. Dean lazily ran his tongue across Castiel’s bottom lip, taking time to explore, more than asking for permission. Castiel apparently did not have the same patience as Dean and swept his tongue into Dean’s mouth, tangling them together. Hand’s gripped tightly at Dean’s hips, holding them close as the kiss turned hot and heated.
Suddenly, Dean felt like a bit of a dick. Nudging Castiel’s hand with his arm, Dean watched him with a small, fond smile. “I guess it’s a good thing you have me around then. Someone has to fill in the, frankly, astounding gaps in your education.”
“Heya, Cas,” Dean said with his best ‘aren’t I adorable’ grin.
A loud crash echoed through the mostly empty bar, the noise shocking Dean from his almost trance like state. He glanced over to where Jo was cursing at their waiter Ash over an upturned tray of glasses on the floor. “I should probably-”
“Yeah, we thought it was
“9 o’clock,” Castiel mumbled, his face tucked against Dean’s shoulder.
“Was that a yes?” Castiel huffed.
He could see from the crinkles next to Castiel’s eyes that the other man was smiling so before he could make an ass of himself again he began to pull away. Long fingers briefly wrapped around his wrist, keeping him in place. “Enjoy your skiing Dean,” Castiel said softly before releasing him.
The hunter caught on quick and pulled the door open before flipping their positions. “Lay down,” he said, pushing Castiel back towards the open bench.
The other man looked stunning in the moonlight. His nose and cheeks were pink from the cold and there were snowflakes caught in his hair and on his eyelashes. “God you’re gorgeous,” Dean breathed, running a cold finger across Castiel’s jawline.
are you a chaperone?”
Dean turned and raised a brow. “I’m sorry, but is this your attempt at flirting?”
Holy fuck guys. I am SO SORRY. I know it's been like... 6 months. I promised when I started this fic that I wasn't going to abandon it and I totally did. It's been one hell of a crappy year, for the world, but also just in my personal life so I sort of lost interest in everything. I love all of you who are willing to come back to this story after that long break. I promise to be better from here on out. I have the next couple of chapters written so I will try to slowly put them out while I finish the rest.
With a strangled “
So sorry this wasn't up yesterday. Life got crazy and I had to go see Jonathan Van Ness be amazing.  I hope it's worth the wait!
Castiel dissolved into a fit of laughter as Dean reached around to smack him with one of the throw pillows. “Your face!”
“Cas, dude, you can’t tell me you like this crap,” Dean groaned, trying to focus on the absurdity of the situation and not how good Castiel looked, moving to the beat as though he didn’t have a care in the world.
“Dean-,” Sam started, watching as his brother made his way to the fridge and pulled out a beer.
“Great, you’ve got more to say too.” Dean shook his head and pushed off the counter. “I don’t want to hear it Cas.”
“Dean-,”
“Seriously, man?” Dean asked again in disbelief. How did this charming, educated, and ridiculously attractive man not recognize the band that served as a major cornerstone of classic rock? “It’s
Once the warmth began to seep out of the car, Dean took a deep breath and steeled himself. He could deal with kids and their annoying parents if it meant he got a weekend with Castiel. He grabbed both his and Sam’s luggage before double checking that his Baby was locked and safe for the weekend.
“Why does four am even exist?” Dean groaned, slumping back against the counter as the coffee machine gurgled softly behind him.
Hey guys! So I feel like I owe you all an explanation as to why I disappeared for 3 weeks. I 'm battling some mental health issues and was inpatient for a week. I'm now in a residential program. I'm still writing but things are going a lot slower after all day therapy!
Castiel hummed again as he lifted the glass for another sip. Dean was momentarily entranced as he watched the muscles in Castiel’s throat work. “So, you mentioned having a brother?” Dean asked as he leaned back against the far side of the bar, putting a little distance between himself and Castiel.
Strong arms wrapped around his shoulders and held him tight. Dean slid his hands into the pockets of Castiel’s jacket and tucked his face against his scarf covered neck. “It’s okay Dean. We have all the time in the world.”
Dean glanced at his phone, it was almost 11 o’clock but he still felt full of energy. Being around Castiel made it feel like electricity was zapping through his limbs and he wasn’t ready to give that up for the night. Pulling on his own leather jacket, Dean nodded. “Yeah let’s do it.”
“Oh man, that’s going to be your new name in my phone,” Dean said as he clutched the stitch in his side he’d developed from laughing so hard.
Castiel’s hands flew to Dean’s hips, pushing his open jeans and boxers down until Cas could knead the bare flesh of his ass. Dean gasped into his Angel’s mouth as their erections, finally, fucking
After Castiel’s phone buzzed for the last time, he slipped it back in his pocket and pressed play on his tablet. The show started right away and though it was a little slow for Dean’s liking, he quickly got more and more into the story. The Doctor was a little surly and wore a leather jacket so he got an automatic pass in Dean’s book.
Castiel huffed out a laugh. “I guess we will just have to find the time.”
Castiel let out a small yelp and squirmed in his seat to get away from the sudden cold. He whipped around in his seat to glower up at Dean who had collapsed over the back over the seat as he laughed. Thankfully, the lobby was mostly empty so they only garnered a few unimpressed looks.
“Look at you down there,” Dean murmured as he watched Cas squirm, ignoring the desperate ache in his jeans.
Dean snorted and turned to rest his hip against the hood as he studied his friend’s face in the moonlight. He tried to hold on to his irritation from earlier but it was hard when Cas was so close and dammit, Dean was
Taking a running start, Dean hopped up onto the bartop and slid on his knees. His eyes were closed as he crooned along to the song and wildly fingered his air guitar. The patrons of the bar had all turned to watch but the only eyes Dean felt were Castiel’s. “Valhalla, I am coming!”
With a wink, Dean turned and made his way back upstairs to his room to change and dry off. As he waited for the elevator his hands flexed with the desire to go back and run through Castiel’s hair and along his warm skin until they finished warming up. Maybe once they came out into the open after Sam’s graduation they could come back for a proper ski trip.
If you have a second, please leave a comment or kudos and let me know how I'm doing!
“Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh!” The lyrics faded away as the final chords echoed through the room. As the song transitioned, a round of applause and whistles sounded throughout the bar.
Dean’s shoulders sagged and he fell forward to rest his head on Castiel’s shoulder. “I don’t know why I can’t say it.”
Dean stood with a start and cast a quick look around the bar. Sure enough, their regulars had started to filter out for the night, just a few parties lingering in booths along the walls. How had almost three hours passed already?
Leaning on the edge of his desk, Bobby glowered at the Hunter on his couch. “You think you’re damn near invincible boy. Maybe you forgot but Gordon got turned into a vamp. Sure he was a dick, but he was a damn good hunter too.”
Sam dropped into the chair across from him with a heavy sigh, running a hand through his hair as he shot Dean a ‘look’. Castiel hovered nearby, tension and anger rolling off him in waves as he shifted anxiously from foot to foot. If Dean didn’t know better, he would probably find the Angel’s stance intimidating.
With a tug on Dean’s belt, Cas slowly walked them backwards around to the side of the car as he licked and kissed along Dean’s jaw. It was far from graceful, their feet tangling as they walked, too caught up in each other to care.
He quickly wet a hand towel and gave himself a cursory wipe before making his way back out to the bedroom. With hair sticking up in every direction and an array of hickies across his collarbone, Castiel looked well and truly fucked and Dean loved knowing that he was the one who did that to him.
Castiel’s hand flew out and grabbed his wrist tightly. “Dean Winchester if you move from this bed I will come without you and leave you to your own devices,” he growled.
?” he asks, the S sounds whistling a bit through the gaps where the tooth fairy has already claimed some baby teeth.
Dean pads outside while Cas puts the kid to bed, pantomiming a phone call as he holds up his cell. He’d gotten that feeling again, that feeling of
“That’s the shit!”
“What lesson is this children’s program supposed to teach? There’s no such thing as a ‘weremole.’ And the city they live in doesn’t even exist. It’s not at all practical,” Cas scoffs.
Cas slides back onto the bed, planting each muscled thigh, toned from so many trips cycling to and from the farmer’s market, on either side of Dean’s legs. Propped up on his elbows, Dean meets Cas and his slicked mouth halfway in another kiss, slower and more passionate, reaching down as their bodies slot together to take both of them into his uninjured hand.
But when he pressed play, the screen issued an error:
Time and again, everything Dean thought he knew had been upended and cast into doubt. But one thing remained certain: he would defeat Chuck and bring back Castiel and all the rest, or he would die trying.
“I will treasure this memory until the end of my days,” Gabe says, wiping tears from his eyes and setting the phone on the table. He moves to stand over his supine friend and extends an arm to help him up. “Need a hand?”
Dean snorts and chances an affectionate glance at the Dork of the Lord occupying his passenger seat. “Not what I meant, Bill Nye. It’s just sudden. That’s all.”
“Pink puffy love couches, huh?”
Jack peers around Castiel’s other leg and takes in the sight of the Impala, eyes going wide at the goofy shape of his face mirrored in the shiny chrome hubcaps and accents. He nods to Dean, who straightens upright again.
“Fuck you, Charlie,” he hisses.
“Sweet. I bet it’ll still be enough to feel a little
“Actually, you’d be doing me a big favor by taking the rest of this home.” Dean pulls tin foil from a drawer and tears off a large piece to wrap over the leftover pie.
“Let’s do this!” Gabriel reaches into the open top of the box and rustles his hand around for a moment before withdrawing a single sliver of paper. The band gives him a drumroll as he straightens it out and flips it around to read properly. “Looks like our first game is...The Bench! Who wants to play?”
Thankful for rear-wheel drive, Dean backs away from the blast zone and speeds off into the evening. Raindrops on the windshield somehow give way to a cloudless starry sky, like the storm hadn’t happened at all. He can sense the angel’s eyes on him even as he keeps his own on the road.
“What?” Now Castiel is wearing his surprised face, but the agitation is still there, so he just looks like a sad puppy.
you—Agh! Careful!” He almost flings his food when Castiel smacks him in the arm (equally for the comment and the nickname), so he quickly shoves the bite into his mouth. “Oh my god. You have got to keep this guy.” That earns Gabriel a follow-up smack, but Castiel is smiling now, engrossed in replying to his phone.
“Hey, at least I’ve got the inches where it counts.”
The subtle twitch south of the border decides it: definitely more turned on than intimidated.
“Shit, Cas, you’re so fucking hot. Feels s’good,” Dean moans, relishing the sensations, chin angling upward with a backward toss of his head.
to apologize, even if Cas doesn’t hate him for what he said. So he forces himself to keep eye contact and takes a deep breath.
Cas takes the pie tin from Dean and whistles quietly at the number of films to watch in just one franchise. And Dean hadn’t even mentioned the multiple cartoon series or the live action show, but if he could get Cas hooked on the lore, he’d have to show him the rest. For context, of course.
Cas dips his head knowingly. “It’s not easy to start anew. I’ve been there. I’m very thankful for the support I had, even if most of my family is highly dysfunctional.” He takes another sip from his own cup, slower with his imbibing.
?” he whispers, horrified.
They’re both silent for a moment before Cas’s brain catches up with reality, and he clears his throat and takes a couple quick steps back. And then remembers to drop Dean’s hand. Dean lets out a laugh that sounds half hysterical and it almost seems like his cheeks flush even
Evening finds Dean and Castiel chatting from opposite ends of the couch with Jack sprawled between them and wrapped in his new blanket, Gabriel having stolen the recliner at the start of a movie that no one is watching. The cartoon only drawing his attention in short bursts, Jack is busied with a coloring book, pausing every so often to show off to his seated audience. In the meantime, Gabriel has fallen into a sugar coma, snoring softly and muttering something about cherry stems.
“Don’t move,” Dean threatens, a dark edge to his words that makes Castiel believe Dean’s had to use that tone before.
“No, it’s really me. Look, I can’t stay long. But Dean, don’t lose faith. Amara and I have roamed through dozens of other dimensions, and we think we’ve found one last workaround to save Castiel. One that the Empty won’t be able to stop.”
Maybe the smartest guy Dean had ever been that close in contact with. Seriously. Sam went on a week-long fanboy exhibition when he found out Dean was going to be at KU with “the most renowned ornithologist of North America and leading researcher in migratory flight patterns of the albatross.”
He failed to keep Sam in one piece. He abandoned Ben. He’d been helpless to save his own daughter from herself. Even the shapeshifter kid had been taken from right out of his arms. How could he ever hope to keep a child as important as
Well, apparently
—that Jo likes her, too. Far be it for Charlie to believe
“You good?” Cas asks, clearly not wanting to push Dean into something he isn’t ready for.
The frown slants upward as Cas smiles. “Would you still do this if I
“Man, about that phone call—”
The floor is littered with scraps of wrapping paper from Jack tearing into his presents: a suspiciously on the nose dinosaur plushie and a pair of multicolored light-up sneakers from Gabriel (“No, I didn’t
“Give it to me straight, doc, I gotta settle something,” Dean
Castiel narrows his eyes. “I’m sure you picked her up somewhere innocent like the library and
“Dean?” Castiel looked at him in dazed disbelief, pushing up onto one elbow. Despite swimming vision and only one good arm, Dean crawled over and wrapped him into a breathless hug. “Getting me out should’ve been impossible with the deal I made.”
He debates how much longer he can reasonably linger in bed when an angry stomach rumble makes up his mind for him. Gathering a blanket around his shoulders like a cape, he traipses out of his room to start the coffee machine.
“Cas, buddy.” Dean’s voice shook. “Say something...please,” he implored, face pallid. There was a pounding in his ears and he suddenly couldn’t get enough air. The room swirled and tilted sideways in a nauseating whorl, vision going dark from the outside in.
Cas recites the phone number quickly. Tapping away at his phone to enter the new contact, Dean looks up just in time to see Cas lift lashes from a staring contest with his shoelaces.
, Dean. No, that’s not what I meant at all. I’m talking about
Thanking the cashier, Dean turns and notices a shop across the way with a large sign proclaiming it to be The Stand of Milk and Honey. He smirks in appreciation of the pun. Wood-carved bumble bee figurines dangle from the sign at random lengths and intervals. Inside, metal shelves lining both sides of the booth are filled with dozens of jars of honey in a variety of flavors as well as homemade beeswax soap, candles, and lip balms. In one corner, a refrigerated display cabinet holds jars of fresh milk.
, though. And Jo won’t get over herself and believe Dean
“C-coulda fooled me,” Dean stutters as Cas nuzzles along his jaw, sucking kisses down the stretch of his neck, fingers roaming across his body and pausing just at his waistband. Dean groans at the delay, jeans uncomfortably tight at the zipper.
When all was said and done, Jack wished them luck and asked them to give Castiel his love. The fire faltered and blew out, leaving only a broken map table as evidence of the godly presence. Sam and Dean stood quietly, processing.
“Dean. Allow me,” Cas says, sliding a hand into the small denim square on the front of Dean’s jeans. In one smooth motion, he retrieves the card and turns to swipe it through the reader. The move is so intimate, so familiar that Dean fights a blush threatening to overtake him from scalp to shoulders. Either Cas is as oblivious as ever, or he
“Where did you learn to do that?” Castiel isn’t sure he wants to know the answer, but he can’t help asking. He’s never seen anyone fight like it came so naturally.
He fills a thermos for Jack (who has a tendency to make a mess when he gets excited) and two mugs with steamed milk. “It’s still hot. Don’t drink it yet. Just hold it,” Dean warns after stirring in the cocoa packet and attaching the top securely to Jack’s drink.
part.
“You move,” Dean says, already forcing himself up.
Castiel blinks once. Then again.
It’s like the clouds part when those eyes smile. Cas abandons his flowery yellow mug and reaches for the carafe. “The only thing I need you to do…”
Although loath to leave the sheets and his present company, especially in the nude, Castiel slinks stealthily off the edge of the bed.
“Aww, his birthday’s soon? How old is he turning?” Dean spins around and leans against the counter behind him, crossing his legs at the ankles and leaning back on his elbows.
By the time the credits roll, Jack has passed out on the floor, cuddled up with a plushie he’d brought. Dean removes his fingers from where they’ve been carding through Cas’s dark tangles and sits up to turn off the television. Cas kisses his cheek and stretches before bending—inadvertently showing off the finer points of his runner’s body, much to Dean’s appreciation—to gather Jack into his arms, stuffed animal and all.
Given the time of night and the backwater roads, the speed with which Castiel reaches Dean’s residence feels like a snap of the fingers. From a distance, he notes that the building’s first-floor lights are off and as he pulls in, he finds the Impala parked in its usual place, nothing out of the ordinary there. But when he hops out of the truck, he notices a hunched form curled into the banister at the top of the steps. “Dean?”
Gabriel.
“He wants you to know he’s thankful for you watching out for him,” Cas says from the far side of the bed. He’s smiling again, and Dean is suddenly overwhelmed at how right this moment feels.
Instead of stepping back to give Dean more room, Cas traps him at the bottom of the ladder by moving his hands away from the metal to wrap around Dean’s hips, fingertips sliding into the back pockets of his jeans. “Oh, I like those plenty. But I like them more inside your head where they belong, so don’t go busting your pretty melon either.”
Dean whispers something in the guy’s ear that Castiel can’t hear, and the kid agrees with a vigorous nod. Dean grip eases and he releases his hold, but keeps the knife trained on the boy. He waits, likely trying to buy the other kid time. “Alright, get the hell out of here and don’t let me catch you again.”
, his hands coming up to wrap around Cas’ shoulders, and Cas can’t help himself. His grip on Dean’s hips spasms and he uses that leverage to push his hips against Dean’s with a growl. Dean
have to deal with the repercussions of Cas having heard those things leave his mouth.
“Stalactites form on cave ceilings. If I were stuck to the floor, I would’ve been a stalagmite.”
Castiel glances at the shelves, considering. “My best seller, part of another best seller? I like the sound of that.”
for using their mutual inebriation as a means to start a conversation he’d much rather be having sober. Besides, gorgeous or not, Castiel doesn’t feel right listening to someone’s thoughts when they can’t fully consent to him hearing.
Dean fishes his phone out of his jeans and types a speedy message before sending it off with a chime.
But something nags at him as he stares down at his flour-coated hands rolling fresh dough. In fact, he doesn’t notice how absorbed he is in the thought until Cas walks through the door and it strikes him that he’s finished preparing the pastries for the next day, placed them on their designated overnight racks, and washed his hands clean without even realizing his evening tasks are complete. He’d been on autopilot.
freaked out. But I trust you, Cas. I’d like to believe we’re both past all the lying to each other. If you say we gotta do this,” Dean continues, turning toward where Cas is almost touching him from shoulder to hip on the seat. “I’m all in. Besides, I’d rather have the kid battin’ for our team. We’ve got enough entities gunning for us.”
“You really think you’d be up for hosting the chaos that is a four-year-old in a new environment? You’re a braver man than most,” Cas jokes.
All previous traces of moping disappear. With a devilish twinkle in his eye, Dean runs his hands along Cas’s spine—relishing the resultant shiver—and squeezes the flesh right above his waistline. “Are you just saying that so I’ll shut up and take you upstairs?”
, Dean? I know you’re particularly fond of the intro.” Cas sits on the far side of the couch and sets his cocoa on the side table, lip twitching with restrained amusement as Dean shoots him a glare above Jack’s head. Way to crucify a guy for having feelings he’d never fess up to.
“Bitch!” Dean mutters softly, so as not to be overheard given their present setting, and kicks at Sam’s shins in a move his brother’s giraffe legs easily avoid.
“Hey, don’t even start. You’re the one who won’t use the cat bed I bought you.” Nougat gives an indignant chirp as Castiel reaches down to grant a cursory scritch.
When they reach the top of the stairs, Jack is sitting smack in the middle of the couch with his legs criss-crossed, holding the remote in both hands and thumbing the rocker switch to shift between two options on the screen as if he can’t make up his mind. Sure enough, he can be heard mumbling to himself, “What to choose… What to choose…” while he alternately displays the title cards for
doesn’t have fuckin’ feet?”
“Where is he?” Cas asks, a hint of concern tinting the question.
The Sam voice drew closer, incredulous. “And that requires talking?” He obviously didn’t buy Dean’s bullshit.
They continue into the house, Castiel holding open the door like the gentleman he is. “After you.”
Instead, he clears his throat, excusing himself from the intensity of the moment and the enormity of his emotions by turning back to the steering wheel and putting the car into reverse.
“Thank you,” Dean whispers into the dark tendrils surrounding his lips.
Blue-sky eyes darken, sending a lightning flash through Dean’s veins and he shivers with need. In the next instant, he’s leading Cas out of the bathroom and down the hall, past the couch where they shared pie and cocoa. Dean slams into the handle of his bedroom door with such ferocity, he may have one more thing to replace in the morning, but that’s future Dean’s problem.
“You are absolutely the least fun best friend in all existence and I hope you know that,” Charlie huffs, rolling her eyes as she heads toward the edge of the parking lot where Dean always parks Baby. He isn’t taking any chances with these hooligans scratching her paint, okay? She is as far out of harm’s way as she can get without Dean just leaving her at home, and he will walk the extra five minutes out of the way if it keeps her that way.
Grabbing his keys from the table, Gabriel makes a hasty retreat out the front door, laughing a goodbye as he goes.
“Yeah.”
Dean pumps with each upward thrust of his hips, adding to the building lubrication between their lengths. Gripping one of Dean’s shoulders in each hand, thumbs pressed into the meat beneath the collar bone, Cas breaks the kiss to push his partner into the pillow, lips parted in rapture as he rocks into Dean’s palm. The power of Cas’s strength holding him in place makes Dean swell as his release closes in.
“Of course, you’re so much more than just your angel mojo. Because even when you were completely human, you were still Cas. And, sure, Jimmy mighta been a good-lookin’ guy, but you were always more than that vessel, too. You were in the crinkles around your face when you laughed. You were in that fierce glare behind those baby blues, whether  shinin’ with grace or just reflecting the sunshine.” He closed his eyes, trying to remember Castiel’s. “The depth of your voice—or, I guess, your true voice filtered through human vocal cords so that you wouldn’t make my ears bleed.”
A tense moment passes before Dean snaps closed his shocked mouth and all of the defensiveness he’d been building deflates. He’s heard Cas warn Gabe about his joking and he’s heard him put on his parenting voice with Jack, but Dean has never seen this commanding side of Cas.
Cas rolls his eyes but his mouth gives away his amusement. “Beehive yourself.”
“I mean, I know he’s trying to establish himself as a new business owner in town and all, but I legitimately think he cares about other people more than himself. I watched him rescue some teenager from being beat up on our way home from improv night. Most people would’ve just called the cops or kept walking. But Dean jumped in like it was his job. Completely diffused the situation.” Castiel realizes he’s pretty much babbling, but it’s the expression Gabriel’s wearing now, a cross between smug and amused, that makes him pause.
“—and I
“What?”
,” The Ghost of Dean Past reminds him. “
Finally picking up the smoker, Castiel sprays several puffs of smoke into the slotted beehive. Unlike Dean and Jack, he isn’t wearing gloves so that he can avoid squishing any of the insects in his care. Carefully, he reaches into the box and lifts out one honeycombed slat. A few hundred bees coat each side, most of them barely moving between the settling effect of the smoke and the slight chill in the air. “Here we are. Aren’t they fabulous?”
“What the hell happened?” Castiel takes a seat beside Dean and the liberty of pulling him close. Dean leans into the touch and scoffs but doesn’t answer. He’s shaking, but something tells Castiel it isn’t just from the cold. “You’re freezing. What are you doing out here?”
The one thing Dean had wanted, once upon a time, was also something he now knew he couldn’t have. He’d tried with Lisa and Ben. Dean was a caregiver through and through, and he’d always been good with kids. At least, he’d thought so until Jack came along.
Willingly drowning in the depths of Cas’s ocean blues, Dean doesn’t realize he’s crying again until Cas reaches up and runs a thumb over the defiant droplet. Without thinking, Dean lifts the hand not held and uses it to press his cheek further into Cas’s palm, eyes closing. When he looks again, Cas has closed the gap between them, a rosiness to his cheeks that can’t be explained away by cold or booze this time.
“I came home to all this.” Dean bows his head as if repentant, restrained but still seething. “Forgot to lock the door. Might as well have left it wide open for those bastards.” He pulls away then, tossing his useless phone onto the countertop and running his good hand through his hair and leaving it there. “I should have fucking known better.”
“You know.”
Cas leans in. “Dean, it’s not intruding if you’re invited.”
“Really? So, no
“That’s it, baby. Don’t stop.”
Jack had become the new god with a capital G, and Baby’s First Holy Act was to bring back all the people who’d been Thanos-snapped by Chuck. Then, he’d simply peaced out—something Dean still struggled to accept. How could Jack be hands-off when his surrogate father, the one who’d cared for him as if he were his own since before he was born, the one who offered his chance at happiness in exchange for Jack, was trapped in the Empty? Jack had told him it wasn’t possible to rescue Castiel, not right now. And to the kid’s credit, he did seem remorseful. But they’d all done the impossible a hundred times over. Castiel had been brought back from the Empty a number of times before. It was hard to believe that Jack had the power of all creation and yet couldn’t do anything. Dean tried to see him the way Castiel had seen him, and he decidedly loved the kid in his own way, but he sure as hell didn’t pretend to understand him.
“Are you okay?” she signed one-handed, surveying the room for danger and assessing the damage. Evidently, the boom had been felt all the way across the bunker. “What happened?”
, you know Cas?” Dean’s saying.
“Gabe…” Cas warns, crossing his arms.
Those same hands rub tender circles, spilling cool water over the split flesh, cleansing away dried blood, patting the skin dry, applying protective ointment.
That catches Gabriel’s attention. He sits up straight and tries to lean over Castiel to catch a glimpse of his phone. Castiel leans away from him and Gabe literally faceplants on the sofa cushion in between them. If Cas wasn’t having an aneurysm, he’d probably be giggling. But as it is, his brain is melting.
From the kitchen, Sam retrieved two painkillers and a glass of water, setting them beside the bed. He stared down at Dean ruefully, thinking how peaceful his face seemed despite the never-easing storm inside. He tugged the covers over his brother and switched off the lamp, wishing he could do something more. “Happy birthday, Dean.”
him? Guy’s got eyes that could climb mountains.”
“Don’t you dare use Cas against me,” Dean threatened, looking like he wanted to drop-kick Sam even as the steam ran out of his words and he lowered his gaze to Madagascar. “I never should’ve told you.”
Dean plops down on Jack’s left and accepts his mug from Cas’s outstretched hand, their fingers brushing with a tender look shared as Dean relaxes against the couch. He kicks one ankle atop the opposite knee and takes a tentative sip. “Hey, bud. Need some help deciding?” Jack nods. “How about
“We’ll just have to make this a regular event, then. Besides, you’ve got another…” Dean pauses to do quick mental math, reaching behind him and picking up the wrapped pie. “...ten
As if Mondays weren’t horrifying enough.
As Jack dumps the measured scoop of semi-sweet morsels into the batter, Cas happens to raise his eyes to find Dean soaking up their endearing family bonding moment.
Two audience members with their hands in the air are selected and they race out of their seats and up the stairs on the side of the stage. Backstage crew members bring out two chairs and place them side by side for the newly selected actors. “For this game, one of you is going to secretly be given an annoying trait and then the two of you will converse as you would if you were chatting up a stranger while waiting for a bus. The ‘normal’ person will have to guess what the ‘annoying’ person’s trait is. Once that happens, you will switch roles. Got it?”
Grabbing another cloth and some cleaning solution, he doused the fabric and ran it over a blade covered in crusty monster gunk from an earlier hunt.
intimate, and it gives Cas a burst of confidence that he may never have been able to find otherwise.
Cas smiles gently, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes, and his arms come up to cross against his chest.
and programmed the number into his phone. Just in case. He’d never gotten the courage to actually
One club they pass has a queue of people waiting to get in. The thumping bass booming from inside forms enough of a beat that a few pre-gamed partiers are raging right there on the sidewalk. A young woman in a short, tight dress dances suggestive circles around her date. Castiel and Dean sidestep the partiers and continue down the road.
“I’m sure Ja—”
Dean usually let Miracle into his room at night to snuggle on the bed, but his door was closed. Earlier, he’d said he just wanted to get some sleep for his birthday and Sam had reluctantly agreed. Dean hadn’t taken Rowena’s news well, though he’d tried to hide it. Sam could see the way his brother’s jaw had ground his molars together and how his eyes had glistened as he heard the witch queen’s regretful reply. Sam knew better than anyone what that meant.
“Man, you have a great laugh,” Dean says softly, and Castiel abruptly stops laughing. And Gabe starts.
Dean chuckles. “Reminds me of pranks Sammy and I used to play on each other.”
“What do you want to do about it?”
As Dean got to his feet, Sam assured her he was fine and that he had no idea what was going on. Stepping closer, Dean realized the burning wreckage wasn’t giving off any heat, nor was the table itself being eaten by the crackling flames. Aside from having been torn asunder, it was completely fine.
“Like Anna’s tree,” Dean says, remembering the enormous oak that had sprouted after she had ripped out her grace and fallen.
Charlie snorts, then winces.
Jack, bless his heart, tilts his head and squints in confusion—a spitting image of Cas that warms Dean into his soul. Shrugging out of his jacket sleeves, Jack turns his face toward his uncle. “What’s a
references. They’d rewatched the original trilogy a handful of times already. “Guess that makes me the princess.”
“I hope he likes what I got him,” Dean says, shutting the back door and opening the front. Reaching into the shotgun spot, he carefully drags a cake box out of the car and shifts it so that it’s balanced in his grip. “You mind getting that door for me?”
? That phone call is all I'm going to talk about for the rest of my
“Thunderstorms are a product of warm, wet air rising into the atmosphere and—” Castiel is interrupted by a crack of lightning so close, deafening thunder rattles the car almost immediately. He glares past Dean and out the driver’s side window as if offended by the force of nature surrounding them.
. The memories of last night are too vivid, too evident to have been anything but real.
He paused, considering what he really wanted to say. “Honestly, I just hated seeing all the angel shit everywhere. It was like a slap in the face wherever I turned.” It had felt like such a cheap imitation of the real thing and all for the sake of capitalism.
require a vessel.”
Gabriel pulls another prompt from the box. “Well, here we go. This is a new one. An old country line dance! For this part, I’m going to need eight victi— I mean volunteers.” He hops down from the stage and dashes between the rows, high-fiving a half-dozen people before making his way back toward the front. He stops in front of Cas and Dean.
Several minutes later, as he reaches into the pastry case to retrieve part of an order, a tiny face appears on the other side of the glass, nose and hands smooshed hard enough to leave smudges. Good thing the shop is stocked on glass cleaner. Dean laughs as he stands, glancing over to see Gabe having joined Cas by the window. “Hey, Jack. How ya doin’, munchkin?”

Also, I'm in need of a new beta reader. If anyone is interested you can comment here or message me on tumblr at ScienceofSociopaths.
“Come on Cas,” Dean groaned, his own hips stuttering forward.
Each gasp and groan was like a punch to the gut and Dean had to release his hold on Castiel’s hip to palm himself through his jeans. With newfound freedom, Castiel pushed his hips forward, driving his cock into Dean’s mouth until it hit the back of his throat. Dean swallowed around it, doing his best not to gag as Castiel cried out. “Dean! Fuck, Dean, stop!”
With Dean still frozen, Castiel took a small step back and let his hands slide from Dean’s hips. “I’m sorry Dean. I know you wanted to wait for the right time and I just thought here with the snow and -.”
Desperate to keep his hands slightly warm, Dean kept them tucked in his jacket pockets as they walked back towards the lodge, but their shoulders brushed together on every other stride. The silence between them wasn’t comfortable any more, but charged with emotion and words unsaid. When the lodge came into sight and Castiel took a step to put more distance between them, Dean wasn’t sure if he was relieved or disappointed.
Smiling bright, Cas gives a gentle squeeze of the flesh through Dean’s pockets. “Oh, it’s real,” he affirms, tugging Dean in for a kiss that makes his heart slam against his ribs.
Gabriel, in an unnatural fit of agility, launches himself over the kitchen counter as he answers the phone.
Every “
voice—is deep and sort of rough, and a shiver runs down Castiel’s spine before he can really register what’s happening. “This the— the bird inspector?”
Dean’s stomach twists with a mix of anxiety and curiosity at the thought of Cas staying. At the thought of him
Cas takes the name calling as an endearment and slides in beside Dean, triumphant. “You love me.”
A few blinks later, Dean’s circuits reconnect and he finds Cas picking repeatedly at the same mutilated section of pie, the tips of his ears just a shade redder than the rest of him. Dean decides not to say anything and forces himself to relax against the couch as if nothing had happened.
Cas is silent from where he’s still standing across from Dean. If Dean couldn’t see his classy wingtip shoes from where he’s staring at the tile flooring, Dean would think Cas had walked away. Then suddenly, those shoes are right in front of his and he looks up directly into bright,
“Booty call?” Gabe asks instantly, because of course he does.
Castiel tugged something out of his pocket and extended his free hand. Face-up in his grip was his cellphone with the screen unlocked.
Mouth formed into a circle of interest, Jack leans forward and onto his tiptoes to peer at the bees trudging slowly past one another. On the other hand, Dean can’t seem to tear his gaze away from Cas, currently distracted by his nephew’s innocent curiosity. When he finally looks up and catches Dean staring, Cas smiles wider.
At the mention of his name, Jack leans his head back to look at Castiel upside-down and holds up his book.
Cas, on the other hand, is red across the cheeks as he tries to keep up. Whether that’s from the alcohol or abashment is anyone’s guess, but Dean thinks Gabriel may want to skip town for a while after this is all over.
you drunk. This is not it. Plus, you’ve only had two glasses of wine and your alcohol tolerance is higher than an elephant's.”
As Dean moves to pull away, Chaz dives forward, wrapping his tiny arms around Dean’s torso and staring up with shining eyes and a bright smile. “Woah, hey. I guess that means you dig the jammies?” Dean tousles the kid’s hair with one hand and places the other between the upper wings, returning the hug.
” Cas says, and he can feel his voice flip from
“No, no. I’m sorry, Cas. Here,” Dean says, still beet red but reaching out. Cas gingerly accepts the outstretched hand. As there are still no other guests in line, Dean takes the opportunity to meet and looks up at his yeti of a little brother.
Castiel shook his head. “Sam said as much when he explained what you two had done, but... the spell took more than a mere slice of your soul. It split it in two. The half it claimed from you wasn’t just borrowed. It merged with what was left of my grace and became something entirely new. Something the Empty didn’t like the taste of. I think— I think I’m human now. Or, at least as close to human as a celestial being like me can get.”
“Well, that sure was something! Great job, ladies,” Gabriel calls out to their retreating backs with a twinkle in his tone. “Come see me after the show for your prizes.”
“Please be careful, Dean,” Cas says in that impossibly husky voice he has before morning coffee that melts Dean’s insides.
Castiel nods, considering Dean’s words and what they mean for the struggles Dean must have gone through growing up. Dean talks like someone who had to learn parenting far too young, and not in the oops-I-knocked-up-my-girlfriend kind of way. Even though Castiel never found himself without food or shelter as a child, he understands the importance of home. “I want to make sure he feels like he always has a place where he belongs. A family who loves him.”
He was met by a chorus of ‘yes’ and nods. “Okay, go with your two assigned chaperones and get checked in. If everything goes as planned we can have you on the slopes in no time.”
Breaking their kiss, Dean reached down to take them both in hand. His hips stuttered forward as he gave a twist of his wrist. The friction between them was almost too much but at the same time, not enough.
I am SO sorry about how late this is! I got super sick and then Christmas happened and yeah. Thank you so much for all the love I've gotten in the mean time. Every comment and kudo and bookmark makes my day so much brighter.
“Bitch.”
“I’m headed out for the beginners classes if you want to join me, it looks like you’re clearly on your off duty shift.”
“You want to take the trail?” Dean said, nodding his head in the direction to the paved trail through the trees.
“Well this is uncomfortable,” Deam grumbled, kicking his feet up on the coffee table. If looks could kill, Dean would have been dead three times over as all eyes snapped to him.
“Okay she’s probably the one exception. Now can we please not discuss my boss while I’m trying to flirt with you?”
“No problem man,” Dean said as he climbed up the steps in front of the bus driver, Eric.
Castiel covered his smirk with the hand that wasn’t holding his beer safely away from Dean’s thrashing limbs, but nothing could dim the spark in those ocean deep eyes. Dean tore his gaze away as he fumbled over lyrics, letting his eyes flutter shut. This way, there was nothing but him, Castiel and the music.
Castiel arched a brow at him. “First of all, it’s my trauma so it’s my choice how I cope with it. Secondly, I’ve been in therapy for six years Dean. I’m not perfect but I’m in a good place. Third, you’re not quite as stealthy in those boots of yours as you think you are.”
Dean nodded and placed a kiss on the bolt of Castiel’s jaw. “That sounds perfect sweetheart.”
With a frustrated sigh, Dean popped the cap off his bottle. “Sam, just stop okay? I’m done with the chick flick moments for the night.”
Dean’s eyes flew open as he suddenly remembered where he was. Thankful that the low lighting of the bar hid how flushed his cheeks were, Dean tried to gracefully slide back off the bartop. “I’ll be here all night, ladies and gents!”
if that wasn’t the most beautiful sight Dean had ever seen. He was long and thick, the flushed skin dark in contrast where it lay, leaking precome against the pale skin of Castiel’s stomach. Biting back a whimper, Dean watched as the Angel ran a thumb over the slit, swiping a bead of precome that had gathered.
Jo came around the corner with a big grin, her head bobbing slightly to the music, as she made her way across the room.
Castiel turned onto his side until he was facing Dean. He cupped Dean’s face and pulled him in for a soft kiss. “I love you,” he whispered, his eyes closed and his lips brushing against Dean’s as he spoke.
Thanks again to the lovely Arianllyn for being a wonderful beta. She ups my grammar game y'all.
“Kansas needs to grow some closer mountains,” Dean grumbled. Three hours on a bus full of high schoolers. Hopefully this ski resort had a bar.
Chapter 13 Friday, January 13th
“Hurry up, we are ready to get the students on the bus!” Naomi called as soon as they stepped outside.
Dean took a long gulp of whiskey, focusing instead on the burn in his throat instead of the point of heat on his leg. “Shut up.”
Dean just stands there, processing, until Cas saves him from the awkward silence.
“Man, it’s freezing,” Dean gripes. He digs through his dresser for warm pajamas. It’s simply too cold for anything other than extra layers, a fact he laments all the more when he watches Cas step out of his jeans and into sweatpants of his own. Shivering, he crawls under the comforter and sheets, yanking everything over his head, and waits for Cas to join him in the burrow. After several seconds of silence, Dean calls out, “Are you a frozen stalactite out there?”
“As a sort of faculty meeting thing, or...?” Dean asks, and while he says it like it’s a joke, Cas can see a sort of
Castiel speaks first.
Jack hums a repeated buzzing sound as they walk up to Castiel.
Gracefully, Cas lets it slide with a simple, “That would make me very happy,” and another quick peck on the lips before breaking away from Dean to grab their mugs.
At the end of his shift, Castiel pulls the tarp closure down over the booth and ties it off. He takes a moment to press his fingers into a sore spot in his neck before he sets about pulling the shelved product forward and straightening things people have moved out of place throughout the day. He checks the dates on the dairy case and removes a few bottles that are past their freshness. Finally, he unlocks the register and removes the day’s cash and most of the coins, rubberbanding the bills together and dumping it all into a thick plastic zip bag which he shoves into the bottom of a backpack. After locking the register again, he removes his shop apron, hangs it from a wooden coat rack, and swings the backpack across his back, adjusting the weight on tired shoulders.
